- <i>307 en route from Kreskie and Pine.</i>
- D4, 17.

00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:13,185
<i>307 to 309. Male, white, elderly.</i>

00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:14,252
<i>Black high-tops...</i>

5
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:16,357
Whoa!

6
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,191
Fuck!

7
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:25,298
Dispatch, I got a hit and run.

8
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,401
Blue van. Pulling on Raylene and Kreskie.

00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:31,473
<i>Dispatching officer to intercept.</i>

10
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:50,456
<i>Lead him over to Washington.</i>

11
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,457
<i>All units divert to Washington.</i>

12
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:55,530
<i>All units divert to Washington.</i>

13
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:01,069
<i>Eastbound, now on Washington.</i>

14
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:15,114
<i>Crossing Jackson. All units
intercept at Magnolia.</i>

15
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:16,584
That's good!

16
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:39,372
- Out of the van, now!
- <i>Possible 10-79, bomb threat.</i>

17
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,142
Dispatch, we need a bomb
squad here right away.

18
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:49,481
Sir, wait! There could be a bomb.

19
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:50,716
Fuck the bomb.

20
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:52,585
Son of a bitch just ruined my car.

21
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:54,687
You!

22
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,058
Step out of the van!

23
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:00,394
Hands where I can see them!

24
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:03,632
On the ground now!

25
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:19,264
Hi. Christi Davies.

26
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:21,699
Thank you for agreeing
to do this, Detective.

27
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:24,269
Well, the way the chief put it,

28
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:26,504
I didn't really have much of a choice.

29
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:30,377
Guess I drew the proverbial short straw.

30
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:38,216
So, what exactly are
you hoping to get here?

31
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:41,586
Well, with all the tension between

32
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,956
civilians and police officers lately,

33
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,192
my goal is to get some honest insight

34
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:47,826
into what it's really
like to be a police officer

35
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:49,928
in the heart of America.

36
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,964
I'm not here to choose a side,
just be true to my subject.

37
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,899
And I figured my hometown
was as good a place as any...

38
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:56,569
All right, listen. Look.

39
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:59,605
I'm sure that shit reads
great on the page. Okay?

40
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,376
But if you want me to be open with you,
you just got to give it to me straight.

41
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:05,847
I have my reasons, Detective.

42
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:13,154
How'd you get your scar?

43
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,290
Being a <i>New York Times</i>
investigative journalist

44
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:20,658
isn't always just awards and accolades.

45
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,795
Sometimes finding out the truth...

46
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,300
leaves scars.

47
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,937
Do you mind if I film you for
this portion of the interview?

48
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,843
Sure.

49
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:46,788
Do you like your job, Detective Ruiney?

50
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:52,992
Well, it's all right. I guess.

51
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:56,862
I think I used to like it more.

52
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:58,566
You like yours?

53
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:03,605
Yeah. I do.

54
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,740
Place has changed a lot since I left.

55
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:12,778
Yeah, a lot's changed.

56
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,385
The place used to be all farms.
Now it's condos, development.

57
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,287
That's America.

58
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:25,293
<i>All units, 10-54,
Bancroft Elementary.</i>

59
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:49,781
You first on the scene?

60
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,785
Yeah, no one's come in or out.

61
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:12,370
- Stay here.
- Can I...

62
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,708
Sir, backup is on its way.

63
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:56,483
Police! Show me your hands!

64
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,866
Are those mannequins?

65
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:20,105
What the hell are you
doing? I almost shot you.

66
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:22,975
The officer you left me
with went around the back.

67
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:24,743
So...

68
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:28,514
I told you to stay put.

69
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,883
Listen, your captain signed off on this

70
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:33,918
and I didn't sign up for
this to sit on the sidelines.

71
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,559
So... I'm sorry, but I'm coming in.

72
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:41,795
Fine.

73
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:55,643
Game of Hangman.

74
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:02,516
Two dummies playing the game.

75
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:10,925
925 is your badge number.

76
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:16,727
I'm good with numbers.

77
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:17,664
I remember yours.

78
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,668
Who's the other number?

79
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:50,962
Hmm...

80
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:03,075
Yeah.

81
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:05,210
- Hey.
- Hey.

82
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,158
You know, most people go
fishing in retirement, Archer.

83
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,262
Do they?

84
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:26,097
People don't go fishing when they retire.

85
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:29,000
No. What they do is

86
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:31,235
they hang around waiting for their...

87
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:33,171
pension checks to kick in,

88
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:36,744
and then wonder, "Whatever
happened to my life?"

89
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,248
- Still doing crosswords, huh?
- Why not?

90
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,116
You're doing them in Latin?

91
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:48,052
Well, yeah. I'm an altar boy.

92
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,721
Way back. That's where I learned my Latin.

93
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:53,191
Once an altar boy,
always an altar boy, huh?

94
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:54,860
Oh, that was funny.

95
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:56,161
Never thought of it that way.

96
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:58,730
How have you been?

97
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:00,032
- Good.
- You look prosperous.

98
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:02,100
Yeah, you too, man.

99
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:03,335
You're looking good.

100
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:05,039
- Well...
- You working out?

101
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:09,843
Am I working out?

102
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,754
So this is it, huh?

103
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:25,190
Thirty-six years working Homicide,

104
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:29,695
and you end up outside a dive
bar doing crossword puzzles.

105
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:32,597
That upsets you in some way?

106
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,332
- Doesn't upset me.
- I'm very happy with it.

107
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:37,235
You know, I like to watch the world.

108
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:40,938
Because, uh, I never sleep.

109
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,174
Yeah.

110
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,943
Yeah, me neither.

111
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:47,613
Yeah?

112
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:49,981
You want to talk some
more about this nonsense

113
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:52,085
or you want to tell me what's on your mind?

114
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:58,090
There's a body over at Wayward Elementary.

115
00:12:58,092 --> 00:12:59,890
Female. Late 20's.

116
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:01,963
Hanged with an "O" cut into her.

117
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,099
Almost perfect circle.

118
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:09,070
He took his time doing it.

119
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:13,337
Displaying her. For us.

120
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,341
For us?

121
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:21,379
Both our badge numbers were
etched onto a desk at the scene.

122
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,984
- Serious?
- You tell me.

123
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,654
Autopsy's this morning.

124
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:31,923
Why don't you come on down,

125
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:34,860
take a peek at the vic, crime scene photos.

126
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:37,262
See if you can figure out

127
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:39,968
why this perp is calling us out.

128
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:46,240
Does it remind you of anything?

129
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,207
I don't think so. At least it...

130
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,747
- Doesn't look familiar?
- There's a different MO.

131
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,850
Hey. Donut shop's open.

132
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:01,286
- I'm buying.
- Free donuts.

133
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:03,120
You got 'em last time.

134
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:05,222
That's the highlight of my day.

135
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:07,725
<i>Well, you know,</i>

136
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,193
<i>it took a bit of getting used to.</i>

137
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:12,330
<i>I mean, local PD is
nothing like the FBI.</i>

138
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:15,332
<i>Some of my, uh, former colleagues</i>

139
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,402
<i>thought I was crazy
to move back here.</i>

140
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,403
<i>A demotion in their eyes.</i>

141
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:22,974
<i>But, you know, for
me it's all the same.</i>

142
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:25,777
<i>Still, uh, catching bad guys.</i>

143
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:26,848
<i>What brought you back?</i>

144
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:33,217
<i>Personal reasons.</i>

145
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:36,388
<i>Look, let's just keep
this about the job, okay?</i>

146
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,792
<i>I'm just trying to get a
better sense of who you are.</i>

147
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:43,798
<i>Audiences really connect with
personal stories of their subjects.</i>

148
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,200
<i>Yeah, I'm sure they do.</i>

149
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,072
- <i>There's no information.</i>
- Oh, am I bothering you?

150
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,774
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
There's no information.</i>

151
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,744
Well, you just let me know when finding out

152
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:01,178
what happened to my wife
is a priority, asshole.

153
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,350
Miss Davies.

154
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:07,852
I trust that my detective

155
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,988
is giving you everything you need.

156
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,456
Oh, yeah. We're, uh, tethered at the hip.

157
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:16,495
Miss Davies, I just want to remind you

158
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:20,264
that the body that you saw was a person.

159
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:23,835
With a family, friends, a life.

160
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:26,904
So I trust that you'll
treat anything that you saw

161
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:28,440
with absolute sensitivity.

162
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,808
Definitely.

163
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,278
And you know, the mayor may have signed off

164
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,016
on this all access pet
project, but I didn't.

165
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:40,152
If you print anything

166
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:43,288
that compromises the work of
my detectives in this case,

167
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,023
you will find yourself
standing in a court of law.

168
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:48,159
Do I make myself clear?

169
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,730
Yes.

170
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:52,364
"Yes, Captain."

171
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:53,965
Yes, Captain.

172
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,966
Can you excuse us, please?

173
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:58,036
Thank you.

174
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:59,907
Let me talk to you about Archer.

175
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:08,379
<i>Dr. Parker, please report to
pathology, room number one.</i>

176
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,482
- Hello. Anybody home?
- <i>Dr. Parker.</i>

177
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:16,221
Uh, you know, most people go fishing.

178
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:19,124
Oh, you know, Ruiney tried
that joke on me earlier.

179
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:23,327
- Ah, damn it.
- Didn't work then. Hi.

180
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,462
- So good to see you.
- It's just like old times.

181
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:27,400
I missed your hugs.

182
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,302
- So...
- Oh.

183
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:32,070
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

184
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:35,539
Yeah, get that press pass out of my face.

185
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:39,211
Last time we had paparazzi on
a case, evidence went missing.

186
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:42,214
Sir, I've been nominated for a Pulitzer.

187
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:44,416
- Archer.
- Yeah.

188
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:45,386
You recognize her?

189
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,923
No, I don't.

190
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:53,524
Kerry Cooper, 24.

191
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,894
Foreign language teacher. No record.

192
00:16:56,896 --> 00:17:00,065
Parents filed a Missing
Persons three days ago.

193
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,533
Right...

194
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,402
So, Abby, what do you got to say?

195
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:07,205
Oh, well, cause of death
is definitely asphyxiation,

196
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:10,041
which isn't at all, you know, surprising.

197
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:11,876
Time of death?

198
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:15,547
Well, the body was still
warm when it got to us.

199
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,350
I'd say sometime between
10:30 and midnight.

200
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:25,923
And I can tell you she was actually
still alive when this happened.

201
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:28,425
You see the uneven strokes?

202
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,097
She struggled.

203
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:34,098
Any idea what was used?

204
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,667
A large knife. A box cutter maybe?

205
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:39,403
I can't be sure until I have
something to compare it to.

206
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:42,073
Oh, also, it looks like

207
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,978
the killer redressed her after the fact.

208
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,413
Meticulous. Purposeful.

209
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,448
Oh, and also, uh,

210
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,451
you know, she has seen her
fair share of the inside of ER.

211
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:57,388
She's had everything from a broken
pelvis to several broken ribs.

212
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,259
They've healed, but
they're all fairly recent.

213
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,362
What are you thinking? Like,
what, domestic violence?

214
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,867
Uh... perhaps.

215
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,372
What about these, uh, contusions here?

216
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:16,540
Oh, uh, severe blows to the head.

217
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,946
I mean, I can only presume that
was to knock Miss Cooper out.

218
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,416
Okay. Thanks, Abby.

219
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,152
Yeah, sure.

220
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:41,465
Looks like she was quite the smoker.

221
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,468
Nasty habit.

222
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,372
So what is it you guys
are looking for exactly?

223
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:51,643
Well... I'm not quite sure.

224
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:53,981
We're just looking.

225
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:59,116
Oh, look at this.

226
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:01,054
Look what I found.

227
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,360
Joey Truman.

228
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,394
Her parents said

229
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:12,463
she went out on a date with Joey.

230
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,633
- Joey...
- Archer.

231
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:19,073
Hey, Ruiney. Let's get an
address on this guy Joey.

232
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:34,088
I think I'm gonna be sick.

233
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:11,524
Joey.

234
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:15,259
You think that's our guy?

235
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:16,998
Oh, I don't know.

236
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:22,767
You know, parents didn't give me much.

237
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,239
They said they knew him,
but they never met him.

238
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:30,411
Oh, hello.

239
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:45,126
Let's get Forensics in here.

240
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:06,211
- Then why the badge numbers?
- I don't know why,

241
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:09,480
but it's big enough to
get me out of retirement.

242
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:11,449
Help you with something?

243
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:14,486
Yeah, you can.

244
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:18,388
I'm looking for a fella named Joey Truman.

245
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,458
Would he be around somewhere?

246
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,694
What do you want with Joey?

247
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,530
I don't want anything,
just want to talk to him.

248
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:29,701
Huh. Yeah, yeah, he's inside.

249
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:31,135
Knock yourself out.

250
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,238
- Oh, okay. Thank you.
- Wait here.

251
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,407
Hey, Joey! The cops are here!

252
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:38,643
Police! Don't move!

253
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:39,747
Don't move!

254
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,785
Stay down!

255
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:49,686
I didn't do anything.

256
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:51,291
Shut up! Stay down!

257
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:03,634
Detectives!

258
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:05,369
Detectives!

259
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,843
- You all right?
- Yeah.

260
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,330
- I'm sorry.
- Joey, what's wrong?

261
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:35,735
- Joey.
- I'll explain later. I'll explain later.

262
00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:58,224
Hey, I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!

263
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:20,444
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa!

264
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:23,250
Help me out, guys! Help me out!

265
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,596
Okay, honey. Honey!

266
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,266
- Honey, hold it, hold it...
- All right!

267
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:43,034
Still prefer retirement, Archer?

268
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:45,539
I never preferred retirement.

269
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,875
Well...

270
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:54,545
it looks like the abuse

271
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:55,913
wasn't the only thing

272
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:57,684
Kerry kept from her parents.

273
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:02,386
She doesn't look worried.

274
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:05,690
Yeah, she didn't even ask
why she was being brought in.

275
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:08,292
Better let me do the questioning,

276
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,827
otherwise her attorney
will have a field day.

277
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:13,867
Your show, buddy. Your show.

278
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:22,006
Look, I'm sorry I ran. Okay?

279
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:23,740
I was scared.

280
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:25,843
You didn't look scared.

281
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,511
Right, you didn't look scared.

282
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,681
Look, I've been doing so good.

283
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:31,548
Okay? I just been clean
for a couple months,

284
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,718
and I just slipped up.

285
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,586
"Slipped up"? That's a bit of an
understatement, don't you think?

286
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:39,390
What are you talking about?

287
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:40,791
I'm talking about your girlfriend,

288
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:42,795
Miss Kerry Cooper.

289
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:50,968
No, no. She liked it rough sometimes.

290
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,038
Okay? And you have it
backwards. She was the aggressor.

291
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,607
You don't think I have my own
bumps and bruises from her?

292
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,544
It went both ways.

293
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,515
Well, that's comforting to hear.

294
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:07,518
Look, I don't expect you to understand.

295
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,420
I don't.

296
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:10,988
I never met anybody like her.

297
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,423
And she didn't treat me
like I was some screw-up.

298
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:17,461
- Yeah.
- So I was scared I was gonna lose her.

299
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:20,434
I freaked out, okay? We got into a fight...

300
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,002
Did it get physical?

301
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:29,039
Yeah, yeah, but it wasn't like that. Okay?

302
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,041
And I apologized like crazy.

303
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,478
And we're working things out.

304
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,383
When was the last time you saw her?

305
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,083
Last week.

306
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:40,785
Dropped her off at the school.

307
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:42,119
She said she would call,

308
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:45,458
but... she just needed some time.

309
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,726
Look, call her.

310
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:50,798
You'll see. I didn't
hurt her again. I swear.

311
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:56,099
So...

312
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:58,435
should we ask her now?

313
00:25:58,437 --> 00:25:59,473
I think it's too late.

314
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,348
This is not Kerry.

315
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:13,151
That's not... That's not her.

316
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:15,019
- It's what we're dealing with here.
- That's not...

317
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:16,788
- No, no, no.
- That's not Kerry.

318
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,591
What's the matter with you?

319
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,528
I need to see her.

320
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,829
Right now! I need to see her right now!

321
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:28,766
Is she dead?

322
00:26:28,768 --> 00:26:31,067
Yes, she's dead.

323
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,770
No. She's not dead.

324
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:36,173
Please don't tell me that.
Please don't tell me that.

325
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:40,010
That's not Kerry. That's not her!

326
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:42,613
I need to see her right now!

327
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:44,147
Let me see her!

328
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,817
- That can't happen.
- Please.

329
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:48,786
Please don't tell me that she's...

330
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:50,855
Archer.

331
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:53,691
Please tell me...

332
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:03,201
Let's just, uh,

333
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:04,471
take a little break here.

334
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,738
That's not her.

335
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,105
You want a drink?

336
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:11,642
How 'bout I get you a water or a soda?

337
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:13,079
I'll get you a soda.

338
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,959
So...

339
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:31,194
You still think she did it?

340
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:34,598
Well, she just admitted to playing rough.

341
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,133
But does that make her a murderer?

342
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:37,902
I don't know. Who knows?

343
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:40,637
You know, sometimes they
start playing and then

344
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:42,138
it escalates.

345
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,807
I've seen it.

346
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:45,876
No, this doesn't track.

347
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:48,813
Habitual domestic violence
is impulsive in nature.

348
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:51,051
Our perp is calculated, methodical.

349
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:55,185
She's not our guy.

350
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:57,855
Oh, my God. Detectives!

351
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:58,923
Oh, my God!

352
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,159
Fuck!

353
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:41,767
What the hell were you two thinking
leaving a soda can in the room?

354
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,835
Especially with Lois
Lane outside your door.

355
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:46,136
Have you ever heard of a paper cup?

356
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:49,039
Because we have 150 of
them in the break room.

357
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,275
Yeah, look. I'm sorry. I screwed up.

358
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:52,980
Yeah, you're damn right you screwed up.

359
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:58,281
Look, Ruiney. I know what you're
still going through, all right?

360
00:28:58,283 --> 00:29:01,018
But you have got to get
your head in the case.

361
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,321
In this case.

362
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:06,891
Or you're gonna have to
take some more time off.

363
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:09,926
No, I got this. It's good. I got it.

364
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:13,830
So do you have any idea,
Captain, how the girl's doing?

365
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:16,767
The doctor said she was touch and
go for a while, but she's stable now.

366
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:18,669
That's good.

367
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:22,173
She was also able to give
an alibi, which checks out.

368
00:29:22,175 --> 00:29:26,078
And Ray, you're here as a courtesy.

369
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:32,115
You're not a cop anymore. So don't push it.

370
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:34,951
Okay, Captain.

371
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:37,957
Both of you, get the hell out of
my office before I change my mind.

372
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:52,336
So, Forensics found traces of human blood

373
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:56,007
mixed with animal blood in Kerry's bedroom.

374
00:29:56,009 --> 00:30:00,144
Got a DNA hit on it, and comes up...

375
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:03,314
a felon named David Green.

376
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:06,049
This is the right place?

377
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:09,086
I don't know, honey. Your
guess is as good as mine.

378
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:12,423
I looked in the PO file
and this was the address.

379
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:14,224
This place has become quite popular

380
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:16,292
with ex-cons over the past year.

381
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:19,763
Ex-cons finding Jesus.

382
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:22,602
- I like that.
- Hallelujah.

383
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,218
Did you hear that?

384
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,688
Yeah.

385
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,022
Where's it coming from?

386
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:47,194
Yeah, this way.

387
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:03,809
Oh, God. I can't believe
I'm back in the church again.

388
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,750
Archer!

389
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:15,019
- You okay?
- Oh, you okay?

390
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:17,954
Yeah. What happened?

391
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:19,490
You stop right there!

392
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:22,326
Don't you move! Christi, how's Archer?

393
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:24,428
- Don't move, don't move, don't move.
- Christi?

394
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,298
- I don't know, maybe he...
- No, it's my back, my back.

395
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,301
- Your back? Ruiney!
- I think I may have... just, just my back.

396
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:34,337
- Come here.
- Dispatch, we got an officer down at Sacred Heart Mausoleum.

397
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:36,307
- Suspect on foot. Over.
- What do we got here?

398
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:38,843
What is that?

399
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:41,181
I... I don't know.

400
00:31:48,154 --> 00:31:51,221
So, you see anything?

401
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:55,893
I didn't get a good look
at him. It was too dark.

402
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:57,528
What about you, Ruiney?

403
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,431
No, I was too busy saving your ass.

404
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:02,335
Thank you.

405
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,038
Well...

406
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:08,942
it does confirm it, doesn't it?

407
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:14,278
What?

408
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,213
Monroe's got a serial killer.

409
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:20,017
Yeah.

410
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,153
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

411
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:24,387
The victim was Gene Wilson.

412
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:27,391
Recent parolee who did a
three-year stint for armed robbery.

413
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:31,060
Okay, get a BOLO out on David Green.

414
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:34,097
- No need to, Detect...
- Hmm?

415
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:37,567
Sorry, old habits. He just got here.

416
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:41,905
- He's here?
- He's over there.

417
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:46,277
Uh, David Green? That's you?

418
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:49,413
- Yes, that's, uh...
- You're David Green?

419
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:51,981
Yeah, I'm David Green.

420
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,287
Well, that's good.

421
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:59,792
"God... who gives joy".

422
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:05,328
So Reverend, how does a convicted felon

423
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,498
become a reverend?

424
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,134
God forgives.

425
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:14,038
The church? Not so much.

426
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,538
I had to jump through a lot of hoops

427
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,441
in order to do the Lord's work.

428
00:33:17,443 --> 00:33:20,411
Um, even now, I'm only
allowed to work with ex-cons

429
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:23,012
trying to start over.

430
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:26,150
Well, Reverend, we got a problem here.

431
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:28,484
Actually, we got two problems.

432
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,321
Two? I don't... I don't follow.

433
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,124
You see, Reverend, there's a dead guy

434
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:35,859
swinging in your church.

435
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:38,061
You knew him, right? Gene Wilson?

436
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:40,631
Yeah, he was the janitor.

437
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:43,433
What was he doing here so late?

438
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:45,435
He cleans whenever he can.

439
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:50,075
He... he was just released and
was looking for a fresh start.

440
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:56,916
What are you thinking?

441
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:01,317
Uh...

442
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,356
Reverend, we're gonna
need you to write down

443
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:10,227
exactly your whereabouts
the last three days.

444
00:34:10,229 --> 00:34:12,395
Okay. Yeah, that's not a problem.

445
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:15,065
Um, I was in Springfield,

446
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,366
uh, giving a guest sermon

447
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:18,635
at the Unitarian Universal Church.

448
00:34:18,637 --> 00:34:20,403
Um, I just got back tonight...

449
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:23,039
Okay. Okay.

450
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:26,109
How about Miss Kerry Cooper?

451
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:28,279
How did you know her?

452
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:31,247
Cooper, I don't... I
don't... I don't believe I do.

453
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:34,250
- You don't know her?
- No.

454
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:37,053
Well, you're gonna have
to do some explaining then

455
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:38,488
because your blood

456
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,424
was in her apartment.

457
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,363
My blood in her... I
don't... I don't have...

458
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:52,004
Y-Y-You're not
gonna believe this.

459
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:59,176
Frankly, I... I... I still
don't understand it myself.

460
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:01,712
But, um, a couple of months ago,

461
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:03,714
I woke up in the middle of the night

462
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:05,549
with someone standing over me.

463
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:07,183
A man.

464
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:09,352
And he... I struggled,

465
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:13,723
but he put something over... over my face.

466
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:16,660
And eventually, I passed out.

467
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:19,064
When I woke up...

468
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:25,368
...there was... there was blood coming out of
my arm. I mean, it was dripping down my arm.

469
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,705
Like I'd gotten a shot or something. So...

470
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:32,977
Okay, so you're telling us that a guy

471
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:36,513
broke into your house and stole your blood?

472
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:37,982
That's the story you're telling?

473
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:40,017
That's... I told you...

474
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:41,120
I told you you wouldn't believe me.

475
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,290
Well, I've heard some stories.

476
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:49,459
But you know, this rings a bell to me.

477
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:52,428
Yeah, it's kind of a
coincidence when you think of it.

478
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,499
Last Thursday... I
don't know if I told you.

479
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,301
<i>I</i> woke up in
the middle of the night.

480
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:00,404
And for some reason,

481
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,075
I had a pink tutu on.

482
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:07,644
And a serious fuzzy feather
sticking out of my ass.

483
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:12,348
You know, you're right.

484
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,584
I don't believe you.

485
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:58,298
These days, you know, he can't bring
himself to look inside that file.

486
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:04,368
But he's unable to let it go.

487
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,373
That's why he keeps it so close.

488
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:12,544
Archer, there's something that
I think you need to look at.

489
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:16,446
You want me to look at that?

490
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,050
Please.

491
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,557
You and I both know you're not
supposed to be anywhere near here.

492
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:29,095
This is important to this case.

493
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:32,164
Please.

494
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:40,437
At first, it just looks
like random slash marks.

495
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:42,442
Oh, shit!

496
00:37:44,176 --> 00:37:45,645
I don't know. I think...

497
00:37:47,646 --> 00:37:49,281
I'm so... so sorry.

498
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,624
I missed it.

499
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:02,792
I missed it.

500
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:06,566
So much was going on at the
time, you know, it was...

501
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,202
It was all...

502
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:15,742
You had no way of knowing then.

503
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:29,218
You know, I introduced them to each other.

504
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,258
She asked me to walk her down the aisle...

505
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:37,363
...to give her away.

506
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:43,299
I don't see how

507
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:44,868
I could have missed it.

508
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,774
You didn't even know what you
were looking for back then.

509
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,477
You were too close to it.

510
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,185
Okay.

511
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:06,292
Good work, Christi.

512
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:22,573
There are at least a dozen witnesses

513
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:24,975
that can place him in
that church in Springfield.

514
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:28,377
And I checked out the
report from three months ago.

515
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,480
Turns out Reverend Green
is telling the truth.

516
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:34,850
Lab found traces of
chloroform in his blood.

517
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:37,254
No items were reported missing?

518
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:39,223
The only thing missing was his DNA.

519
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:40,857
This doesn't make any sense.

520
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,526
No, Captain, it does.

521
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:45,328
He wanted us to go to that church.

522
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,830
This guy is definitely a psychopath.

523
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:50,566
But I would classify him
as an organized killer.

524
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:54,004
There's nothing random or spontaneous,
frenzied, about these attacks.

525
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:57,640
They're planned. He leaves a
controlled scene for us to find.

526
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,910
I think we're looking for
a white male, 25-to-35.

527
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:01,778
Extremely high IQ.

528
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,281
And what about this...
this pig head business?

529
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:09,953
Pigs. Cops. Maybe he's
just taunting you guys.

530
00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:12,855
Okay, this information doesn't leave
this room. Do you understand me?

531
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,725
- Of course.
- If the media gets a hold of this,

532
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:16,859
they're gonna turn this
into a frenzy in seconds.

533
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,566
And if I had it my way,
you would go home now.

534
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:24,901
So with Reverend Green's alibi
checking out, then what does that mean?

535
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:27,703
I mean, does this mean
we're back to square one?

536
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,742
We're not even on square one.

537
00:40:32,711 --> 00:40:34,714
You see, it's all about the hangman game.

538
00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:41,685
So far, we have two homicides.

539
00:40:41,687 --> 00:40:45,258
But... we have three letters.

540
00:40:46,658 --> 00:40:48,658
Which means...

541
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,029
we haven't even found the first victim yet.

542
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:55,935
And, judging by the game board...

543
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,569
he's gonna kill seven more people.

544
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:04,674
Same pattern as previous victim.

545
00:41:04,676 --> 00:41:06,575
Petechial hemorrhages in the eyes,

546
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:09,613
look, the ligature marks around the neck.

547
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:14,817
Cause of death was asphyxiation again.

548
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,354
Our perp's been leaving
us clues to the next vic.

549
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:19,723
So far, we haven't got much to go on.

550
00:41:19,725 --> 00:41:21,825
Have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary?

551
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:24,560
- No, nothing.
- Time of death?

552
00:41:24,562 --> 00:41:27,830
Uh, sometime between ten
and midnight last night.

553
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,801
It was eleven p.m. sharp.

554
00:41:30,803 --> 00:41:34,571
Well, it's a little
difficult to be that precise.

555
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:39,075
Well, his Rolex broke.
Right there. Eleven p.m.

556
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:42,345
But clearly last night,
that watch didn't fit him.

557
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:44,680
I don't know too much about Rolexes,

558
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:47,452
except I do know janitors aren't
running around wearing them.

559
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:50,687
That's not his watch.

560
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:54,091
- Yeah. You want to dust this for prints?
- Sure.

561
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:56,859
No, he's too smart for that.

562
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:59,062
Tell me. Eleven p.m.,

563
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,131
that'd fit into the time frame
for all the victims, right?

564
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:04,437
Yeah. That would be correct, Detective.

565
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:10,475
- What?
- Twenty-four hours.

566
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:19,149
Hangman is gonna kill someone
at eleven p.m. every 24 hours.

567
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:24,888
So that gives us two and a half
hours before the next victim falls.

568
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,656
Come on, guys. What are we missing?
There's got to be something.

569
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:29,125
Oh, wait. Uh, the ligature marks,

570
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:32,028
they weren't like the previous victim.

571
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,131
- Why?
- Well, okay,

572
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:38,000
see, they were made of the pigskin.

573
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:40,002
- Pigskin?
- Yeah.

574
00:42:40,004 --> 00:42:41,971
I think I can help here.

575
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:46,910
The FDA stamps serial
numbers on all their meat,

576
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,915
so in case of contamination,
they can trace it.

577
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:54,084
That's it.

578
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:56,388
Let's get the captain to wake up the FDA.

579
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:00,459
Good stuff, Abby.

580
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:11,066
- You okay?
- Yeah.

581
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:13,705
I just need to talk to you
about something after this.

582
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:50,008
Go that way. Stay here.

583
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:02,488
Well, this is fun.

584
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:17,836
Guys?

585
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:48,033
Archer!

586
00:45:24,736 --> 00:45:26,172
Did you guys do that?!

587
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:33,646
Guys!

588
00:45:36,214 --> 00:45:37,517
Guys!

589
00:45:39,984 --> 00:45:41,750
Holy...!

590
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,223
Christi!

591
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:08,278
- I saw... I saw him! I saw him, I saw him!
- You all right?

592
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,714
I think I saw him.

593
00:46:15,787 --> 00:46:19,055
Yeah, because I did lock it up at night.

594
00:46:19,057 --> 00:46:22,024
We got rigor mortis already?

595
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:24,861
Uh, no. He's actually frozen stiff.

596
00:46:24,863 --> 00:46:27,229
Identifying our vic is gonna take time.

597
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:29,265
I'll have to warm up the
body before doing the autopsy.

598
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:30,933
That could take up to a week.

599
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:33,770
Wait. We don't got a week.

600
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:35,071
I know.

601
00:46:35,073 --> 00:46:36,805
We're lucky we even have 24 hours.

602
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:38,140
Eh, Will?

603
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:43,081
Hey, how come the meat isn't frozen?

604
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:47,017
How cold is it in here?

605
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:49,084
There's a thermostat over there.

606
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:51,120
It's, uh, 37 degrees.

607
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:54,957
Oh, well none of that
meat's frozen in there.

608
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,993
So how come our guy's frozen stiff?

609
00:46:57,995 --> 00:47:01,330
Well, he's not a-a slab of meat.

610
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:04,868
And he has more water density.

611
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,303
So, any prolonged
exposure, even at that temp,

612
00:47:07,305 --> 00:47:08,904
would cause him to decompose.

613
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:11,674
Well, hasn't been here long, has he?

614
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:15,678
How long has he been here?
This place been open all day.

615
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,015
You know, you would think someone

616
00:47:19,017 --> 00:47:22,185
might have seen a stiff,
dead guy hanging in here.

617
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:25,790
- Don't you think?
- I agree, yes.

618
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:29,091
Now, if his body was wet,

619
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:31,361
would that make him freeze faster?

620
00:47:31,363 --> 00:47:33,729
Yes, of course it would.

621
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:35,330
Archer, what are you thinking?

622
00:47:35,332 --> 00:47:38,033
Well, I'm thinking...

623
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:42,272
when I want my beer to chill faster,

624
00:47:42,274 --> 00:47:46,776
I wrap it in a wet paper towel.

625
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:48,243
He was already wet before
he was brought in here.

626
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:49,749
There you go.

627
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:56,218
I think this boy wants
us to sweep the river.

628
00:48:03,095 --> 00:48:05,761
Archer, I think you should tell him.

629
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:09,966
Yeah. You know how many
hundreds of families

630
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:13,403
I had to tell these grotesque stories

631
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:15,807
of how their loved ones died.

632
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:19,345
But it was nothing like this.

633
00:48:22,847 --> 00:48:25,180
Okay, so, uh, can you give me a minute?

634
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:26,515
Yeah, of course.

635
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:28,319
- Yeah.
- Here's the photo.

636
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:41,363
This is taking too long.

637
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:44,366
Eight hours, 46 minutes left.

638
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:46,372
Bullshit game.

639
00:48:49,207 --> 00:48:52,341
I know that look, Archer.
Just say what you got to say.

640
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,313
I need to... I need to show you something.

641
00:48:57,082 --> 00:48:59,381
- What?
- From Jess's file.

642
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:01,283
Jess's file?

643
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:03,453
It's a photo.

644
00:49:03,455 --> 00:49:04,988
A photo from Jess's file?

645
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,923
Archer, what the hell are you doing?

646
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:09,158
Well...

647
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,361
look, we both know she put up a fight.

648
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,196
We missed it.

649
00:49:14,198 --> 00:49:15,365
Missed what?

650
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:16,901
Here.

651
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:24,240
There's a letter "V" carved in her chest.

652
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:27,176
This was his first victim.

653
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:30,180
- No, Arch, no. This is...
- What?

654
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:32,182
This is a completely different MO, Archer.

655
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:33,816
She wasn't hung.

656
00:49:33,818 --> 00:49:36,451
We didn't know the MO
at the time we found her.

657
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:39,189
Archer, it's a different
MO. She wasn't hung.

658
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:42,895
She wasn't hung because...

659
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:49,165
he was interrupted from his ritual.

660
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,937
He didn't get a chance to
hang her, you understand?

661
00:49:55,573 --> 00:49:57,841
Why don't you walk me through what happened

662
00:49:57,843 --> 00:50:01,013
right before you went through the door.

663
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:05,917
Go ahead.

664
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:20,395
Jess called me up...

665
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:23,198
and told me to come home.

666
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,236
Said we should try and work things out.

667
00:50:27,238 --> 00:50:32,441
So, I got home, I parked
my car in the driveway...

668
00:50:32,443 --> 00:50:35,912
went down the back,

669
00:50:35,914 --> 00:50:39,885
picked some... tulips to give her.

670
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:44,419
You know, just like I used to.

671
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:47,223
That would've given him a
chance to know someone was there,

672
00:50:47,225 --> 00:50:49,828
and that would've stopped him.

673
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,167
Or he was still in the house
while she was in my arms.

674
00:51:19,691 --> 00:51:22,392
Guys, get me somebody to...

675
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:23,459
Move!

676
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:24,997
Whoa! Whoa!

677
00:51:40,412 --> 00:51:42,948
Eric Anderson.

678
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:56,426
Easy, Ruiney, easy.

679
00:51:56,428 --> 00:51:58,026
No time, Archer.

680
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:03,602
Where's that sound...

681
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:06,604
...coming from?

682
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:13,211
Basement.

683
00:52:46,211 --> 00:52:47,546
Oh, man.

684
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:51,513
Look at this.

685
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:54,450
This is Cooper's school.

686
00:52:54,452 --> 00:52:57,488
This is a replica of Monroe.

687
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:02,424
I think I know now

688
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:04,694
where we're gonna find our next victim.

689
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:06,966
This is the Fostoria Line. Let's go.

690
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:20,676
NS/Fostoria Line at Columbia and Harrison.

691
00:53:20,678 --> 00:53:23,214
This is an emergency. Shut that line down.

692
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,651
He may still be alive, because
we beat this psycho's timeline.

693
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:30,520
- Ruiney!
- Yes, I see it.

694
00:53:30,522 --> 00:53:33,192
There he is.

695
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:40,264
Ruiney. Ruiney, there's nothing you can do!

696
00:53:41,633 --> 00:53:43,135
Ruiney! The train!

697
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:48,770
He's still alive!

698
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:51,339
- We need to get up there to help him!
- It's a steel cable!

699
00:53:56,414 --> 00:53:58,413
Come on!

700
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:01,551
- Get him!
- Come on, get it off your neck!

701
00:54:01,553 --> 00:54:04,453
Get it off your neck! Come on!

702
00:54:04,455 --> 00:54:05,754
Gotta get off the track!

703
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:07,557
I'm not leaving him!

704
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,625
- Train's coming! Come on!
- I'm not leaving him!

705
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:11,694
Archer!

706
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:13,863
Freeze now! Freeze!

707
00:54:13,865 --> 00:54:16,399
- Freeze!
- Come on, you guys! We got to go!

708
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:19,201
Just get it off! Get it off!

709
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:21,537
- We got to go!
- I'm not leaving him!

710
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:24,272
Ruiney! We got to get off that track now!

711
00:54:46,464 --> 00:54:48,763
- Christi!
- Christi?

712
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:51,600
Guys! Are you okay?

713
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:53,401
Holy shit!

714
00:54:53,403 --> 00:54:55,540
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

715
00:55:06,517 --> 00:55:08,618
What the hell were you doing?

716
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,319
I could've saved him.

717
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:13,622
He was dead before the train hit him.

718
00:55:13,624 --> 00:55:15,524
That is bullshit!

719
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:17,627
You're the only one who
could've been saved here.

720
00:55:17,629 --> 00:55:20,196
That was not your call to make.
It was not your call to make!

721
00:55:20,198 --> 00:55:23,799
It was my call. You know,
I'll tell you what my call is.

722
00:55:23,801 --> 00:55:27,636
My call is... that you're chasing a ghost.

723
00:55:27,638 --> 00:55:30,173
You're chasing a ghost, buddy.

724
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:32,810
And that will get you
killed. That's for sure.

725
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:38,381
Is that what you want?

726
00:55:38,383 --> 00:55:39,881
Look, I don't give a fuck.

727
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:41,484
That's right, don't give a fuck.

728
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:43,553
Don't give a fuck about what? Your life?

729
00:55:43,555 --> 00:55:45,720
You don't care if you die, do you?

730
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:49,758
Let's all die. Come on. That's easy.

731
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,694
Then we don't have to
worry about Jessica anymore.

732
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:53,395
Or the Hangman.

733
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:55,698
Let's all die.

734
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,968
I should've never told
you. That was a mistake.

735
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:01,671
- What?
- You are cracking.

736
00:56:01,673 --> 00:56:03,272
- I'm cracking?
- Yes, you are.

737
00:56:03,274 --> 00:56:04,640
- I'm cracking?!
- That's right!

738
00:56:04,642 --> 00:56:05,908
- You're the one who left, okay?!
- Oh...

739
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,509
- You left!
- I left.

740
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:08,578
I stayed on the force! You left!

741
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,613
You're rewriting history!

742
00:56:10,615 --> 00:56:12,714
I retired. I didn't quit!

743
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:14,283
You guys, knock it off!

744
00:56:14,285 --> 00:56:18,587
You begged me to get back! I came back!

745
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:20,855
And I've been with you ever since.

746
00:56:20,857 --> 00:56:22,825
And I'm glad. I am.

747
00:56:22,827 --> 00:56:24,826
I have no regrets here.

748
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:28,300
I have no regrets about being back.

749
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:35,638
Listen, Will.

750
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,875
Listen to me.

751
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,678
I know how much it means
to you to catch this guy.

752
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,281
I know that.

753
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:49,618
And, I feel like that myself.

754
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,785
You understand?

755
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,654
I loved Jessica...

756
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:55,790
like she was my child.

757
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:56,894
You know that.

758
00:57:00,932 --> 00:57:03,299
Sorry, man. I...

759
00:57:03,301 --> 00:57:05,935
We're gonna find this guy.
You understand what I'm saying?

760
00:57:05,937 --> 00:57:08,337
I messed up, man. I messed up. I'm sorry.

761
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:11,376
We're gonna find him. I promise you that.

762
00:57:14,879 --> 00:57:18,417
Well, what have we got here?

763
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:28,790
<i>Right now we're breaking into your regular
programming for this emergency report.</i>

764
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:31,727
<i>We're told there's a serial
killer loose in Monroe.</i>

765
00:57:31,729 --> 00:57:33,995
<i>One of the most
shocking serial killers.</i>

766
00:57:33,997 --> 00:57:35,730
<i>Residents are living in fear,</i>

767
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:38,033
<i>as another gruesome
discovery has been made.</i>

768
00:57:38,035 --> 00:57:40,803
<i>Police are finding
victims hung by a noose...</i>

769
00:57:40,805 --> 00:57:44,740
<i>There's a serial killer loose
in Monroe. Full story at eleven.</i>

770
00:57:44,742 --> 00:57:47,442
<i>...carved in the bodies. The public
is dubbing the killer the Hangman.</i>

771
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:49,812
Let's turn that shit off.

772
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:53,616
Okay. What do we got?

773
00:57:53,618 --> 00:57:58,087
Well, Forensics are
still scraping the tracks.

774
00:57:58,089 --> 00:57:59,988
You know they're not coming up with much.

775
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:02,892
The lab reports came in.

776
00:58:02,894 --> 00:58:04,826
There's nothing on the shirt.

777
00:58:04,828 --> 00:58:06,028
Blood? DNA?

778
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:08,096
Victim's.

779
00:58:08,098 --> 00:58:10,665
Well, there must be something.
Let's run some more tests.

780
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:12,435
There's nothing. There's no fibers,

781
00:58:12,437 --> 00:58:14,406
there's no animal hair... there's nothing.

782
00:58:16,908 --> 00:58:18,277
Where you going?

783
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:24,747
We have less than 30 minutes! Okay?

784
00:58:24,749 --> 00:58:27,049
Nobody goes home tonight! Keep working!

785
00:58:27,051 --> 00:58:28,987
Find something!

786
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:33,788
I take it you didn't get any rest?

787
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,024
No. You?

788
00:58:35,026 --> 00:58:38,397
I don't rest. Ever.

789
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:45,834
This damn game.

790
00:58:45,836 --> 00:58:49,437
Every scene has a lead to the next
vic. But this one, I just can't see it.

791
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:52,073
Well, I think he's just
messing with us, Ruiney.

792
00:58:52,075 --> 00:58:54,977
We outsmarted him at the track.

793
00:58:54,979 --> 00:58:59,013
You outsmarted him. Got
ahead of the timeline.

794
00:58:59,015 --> 00:59:02,151
Tide would have revealed that car
when it was too late to stop him.

795
00:59:02,153 --> 00:59:05,620
He doesn't want us to save anyone.
He wants the game to continue.

796
00:59:05,622 --> 00:59:07,857
Well, we got pretty close.

797
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:10,959
We almost saved that guy... let's face it.

798
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:13,129
Tell that to his family.

799
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:15,798
Do you guys think it means anything,

800
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,834
all the other victims were
left hanging for us to see.

801
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:23,506
But this victim got taken out by the train.

802
00:59:23,508 --> 00:59:25,743
The Hangman wanted us to see him get hit.

803
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,046
Train.

804
00:59:31,682 --> 00:59:33,982
Wait a minute. How did he know?

805
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:35,884
Know what?

806
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:38,486
How did he know that Eric Anderson

807
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:41,823
had a model train set in his basement?

808
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:44,093
I mean, there's gotta be a connection.

809
00:59:44,095 --> 00:59:46,694
Detective Ruiney? Forensics finally
found a finger on the tracks.

810
00:59:46,696 --> 00:59:48,631
They got a hit off the prints.

811
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:50,732
Forty-six years old, Nathan Shine.

812
00:59:50,734 --> 00:59:54,602
- Nathan Shine?
- Nathan Shine.

813
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:58,874
Hold it. Hold it. Did the captain
come in today?! Is the captain here?!

814
00:59:58,876 --> 01:00:00,142
No, sir. She's not here today.

815
01:00:00,144 --> 01:00:01,676
Who the hell's Nathan Shine?

816
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:04,078
Nathan Shine is the drunk

817
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,781
that run her off the road, crippling her.

818
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,484
He's got her!

819
01:00:08,486 --> 01:00:10,455
He's got the captain! Let's go!

820
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:20,895
How long for SWAT?

821
01:00:20,897 --> 01:00:22,798
Five away. Keep this perimeter locked down.

822
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,002
No one in or out. Christi, stay here.

823
01:00:26,803 --> 01:00:28,572
Ruiney, she's still alive.

824
01:00:32,176 --> 01:00:34,542
Archer, stop! Stop!

825
01:00:34,544 --> 01:00:37,515
Trip wires. Son of a bitch
has got the place rigged.

826
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:45,488
Dispatch. Ruiney. Probable 10-89. Over.

827
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:47,526
- Grab her here.
- I got her. I got her.

828
01:00:51,828 --> 01:00:53,595
Oh!

829
01:00:53,597 --> 01:00:55,798
- Get it off!
- Let's get this thing off her.

830
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,935
Get if off!

831
01:01:00,104 --> 01:01:03,138
Breathe. Just breathe. That's it.

832
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:06,140
- Here, breathe.
- Okay, let's get her down.

833
01:01:06,142 --> 01:01:10,613
He never finished carving
the letter. He's still here.

834
01:01:10,615 --> 01:01:12,714
Suspect's still on site.

835
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:14,283
Send in backup.

836
01:01:14,285 --> 01:01:16,919
Be advised, there are trip wires.

837
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:58,259
You in the bathroom,

838
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:01,600
move out slowly with your
hands where I can see 'em.

839
01:02:27,124 --> 01:02:29,660
Archer, I got a deceased male!

840
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:32,897
All clear.

841
01:02:38,269 --> 01:02:39,803
Archer! He's a cop!

842
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:49,011
There! There! There!

843
01:02:49,013 --> 01:02:50,582
- Wait! Stop! Hold on!
- Wait! Hold on there!

844
01:02:52,883 --> 01:02:54,618
Son of a bitch.

845
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,694
<i>Dispatch, we need an EMT...</i>

846
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:14,169
Dispatch, we're in pursuit
of a blue Honda motorcycle

847
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:16,841
heading east on Jefferson.
All units respond.

848
01:03:19,176 --> 01:03:21,680
<i>Suspect on a motorcycle.</i>

849
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:27,252
<i>Ruiney in pursuit,
eastbound on Jefferson.</i>

850
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:40,791
Partner, what the hell ya doin'?

851
01:04:44,294 --> 01:04:46,060
What are you doing, Ruiney?! Come on!

852
01:04:46,062 --> 01:04:47,831
Ruiney! Stop! Ruiney! Stop!

853
01:04:51,836 --> 01:04:54,102
- What are you doing!
- Ruiney, stop!

854
01:05:23,234 --> 01:05:25,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

855
01:05:25,002 --> 01:05:26,267
How ya holdin' up?

856
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:28,470
Slight concussion, but no big deal.

857
01:05:28,472 --> 01:05:30,272
How are you?

858
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:32,908
You know, I feel like
I've been hit by a truck.

859
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:35,243
Thank you.

860
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:38,312
Christi, listen, uh...

861
01:05:38,314 --> 01:05:40,082
I've been thinking.

862
01:05:40,084 --> 01:05:41,950
Maybe you should walk away.

863
01:05:41,952 --> 01:05:45,386
Ya know? This is getting dangerous.

864
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:47,758
I just feel like we were lucky, you know?

865
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:52,026
One scar's enough already.

866
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:55,132
Hey, babes, we gotta move.

867
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:59,133
So what are we gonna do with the captain?

868
01:05:59,135 --> 01:06:01,203
I mean, I think she should be questioned.

869
01:06:01,205 --> 01:06:03,138
She's the only one who saw the Hangman.

870
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,839
Already did. She didn't get a look.

871
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:06,508
She was jumped from behind.

872
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:09,011
What a fight she put up, huh?

873
01:06:09,013 --> 01:06:10,511
In a wheelchair.

874
01:06:10,513 --> 01:06:14,515
Yeah, wheelchair, no
wheelchair, that's one tough cop.

875
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:17,218
Got nothing from the
motorcycle. Stolen. No prints.

876
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,022
Figures with this guy.

877
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:28,296
How you doing, Christi?

878
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:29,934
You okay?

879
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:41,609
I was doing this piece on drug cartels,

880
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:45,613
and it was in the middle of nowhere, and...

881
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:47,417
I was going to my car late at night.

882
01:06:49,419 --> 01:06:52,620
And...

883
01:06:52,622 --> 01:06:54,958
I just felt like something
bad was gonna happen.

884
01:06:57,361 --> 01:07:00,127
There was this guy,

885
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:03,365
and he just came up, um, behind me

886
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:06,104
and he knocked me down and...

887
01:07:07,937 --> 01:07:10,040
he just started beating me.

888
01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:14,109
He had a knife to my neck.

889
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:17,080
I didn't know if I was gonna live or not.

890
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:24,453
The detective who was
assigned to the case...

891
01:07:24,455 --> 01:07:28,156
Detective Michaels,

892
01:07:28,158 --> 01:07:31,196
he vowed to find the
guy who did this to me.

893
01:07:33,097 --> 01:07:34,499
I don't know why.

894
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:38,836
I don't know why he cared so much.

895
01:07:44,908 --> 01:07:47,177
But he did. He found him. He found the guy.

896
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,048
And the guy shot him.

897
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:57,155
Detective Michaels had a wife...

898
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:02,159
...and a little girl.

899
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:10,464
People don't understand

900
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:13,567
why you guys do what you do.

901
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:16,537
They don't understand how much you give up

902
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:18,508
and how much you sacrifice.

903
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:25,479
So, this story,

904
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:27,985
it's not about me, it's about...

905
01:08:29,953 --> 01:08:32,587
It's about him. It's about you.

906
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:35,026
It's about you guys.

907
01:08:37,494 --> 01:08:40,031
So I'm not... I'm not giving up.

908
01:08:43,066 --> 01:08:44,968
I guess you guys are stuck with me.

909
01:08:48,404 --> 01:08:49,670
Okay.

910
01:09:01,217 --> 01:09:05,519
He's killed four people in four days,

911
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:07,421
one every 24 hours.

912
01:09:07,423 --> 01:09:10,524
He doesn't stop. That's part of the game.

913
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:14,563
He kills Jessica and
he stops... for a year.

914
01:09:14,565 --> 01:09:18,300
You want to put a new
team on Jessica's murder?

915
01:09:18,302 --> 01:09:20,669
Archer, we had four homicides in four days.

916
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:23,005
We don't have the resources
to put a team on a homicide

917
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:25,439
- that happened a year ago.
- Please, it not about resources, man.

918
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:27,608
Something happened. It's very obvious.

919
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:30,411
- Look, I agree with you.
- There's a gap...

920
01:09:30,413 --> 01:09:33,314
- I know, there's a gap.
- ...between murders. So let's just talk about it.

921
01:09:33,316 --> 01:09:36,518
- What does it mean?
- Okay, look.

922
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,389
There are only three reasons
why a serial killer stops.

923
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:43,392
One, they die. That hasn't happened.

924
01:09:43,394 --> 01:09:46,463
Two, we catch them. That hasn't happened.

925
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:50,098
Or three,

926
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,403
they're in prison on an unrelated charge.

927
01:09:54,404 --> 01:09:56,670
Well, sounds possible.

928
01:09:56,672 --> 01:10:00,509
In jail for some unrelated charge.

929
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:03,344
So, why don't we get one of the techies

930
01:10:03,346 --> 01:10:05,346
to look at everybody who was put in prison

931
01:10:05,348 --> 01:10:07,081
from the time that Jess was murdered

932
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,582
to the time Reverend
Green's blood was taken?

933
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:10,385
Nine-month period.

934
01:10:10,387 --> 01:10:12,754
That's gonna yield
hundreds, maybe thousands.

935
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:15,090
Yeah, that's the problem.
We don't have the time.

936
01:10:15,092 --> 01:10:17,792
So we need to figure out
a way to refine the search.

937
01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:21,095
But, I think that this
is personal to you guys.

938
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:23,532
He put your badge numbers
on that desk for a reason.

939
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:26,801
She's right. He called us out.

940
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:31,173
So, let's refine the search to us.

941
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:33,442
Everyone you arrested this past year,

942
01:10:33,444 --> 01:10:34,379
and everyone I arrested.

943
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:37,315
Detectives?

944
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:28,756
That son of a bitch killed Joey,

945
01:12:28,758 --> 01:12:31,561
as a payback to us for saving the captain.

946
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:35,429
He's that kinda guy.

947
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:38,366
Please, tell me you got something.

948
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,902
I searched the records and used the
filters for the date range you gave me.

949
01:12:40,904 --> 01:12:44,238
- Yeah, and?
- 26 arrests in your time parameters.

950
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,773
Five released in time to be your guy.

951
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:47,511
- Put it up.
- That's all right.

952
01:12:49,579 --> 01:12:52,680
So...

953
01:12:52,682 --> 01:12:55,684
who might that be fits the profile?

954
01:12:55,686 --> 01:12:58,819
- Adam Kellerman.
- Adam Kellerman.

955
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:00,688
Pull up Adam Kellerman.

956
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:06,564
Yeah, here we go. Kellerman,
Adam. Assault with a deadly weapon.

957
01:13:08,699 --> 01:13:11,499
Look at his address. And home.

958
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:13,635
Toys N More.

959
01:13:13,637 --> 01:13:17,339
Eric Anderson. Eric Anderson's
basement was full of toys.

960
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:19,443
Give us those shots
from, uh, from Anderson.

961
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,815
This familiar?

962
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:29,783
Train set.

963
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:32,823
Son of a bitch sold it to him, I'll bet.

964
01:13:46,837 --> 01:13:48,372
Let's go.

965
01:13:56,445 --> 01:13:57,845
Clear!

966
01:13:57,847 --> 01:13:59,583
It's clear, Detective!

967
01:14:09,726 --> 01:14:11,362
Holy shit!

968
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:16,764
Get Westlin down here.

969
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:19,401
Get the prints off the wall.

970
01:14:19,403 --> 01:14:20,702
Run 'em against Kellerman.

971
01:14:20,704 --> 01:14:22,903
This is Ruiney.

972
01:14:22,905 --> 01:14:25,275
Let's get Forensics up here.
We have a deceased male.

973
01:14:34,818 --> 01:14:37,320
No powder residue on his face.

974
01:14:41,091 --> 01:14:43,261
And residue on his hands.

975
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:02,446
Oh. Got his paint bucket there.

976
01:15:15,025 --> 01:15:18,462
Oh, look what we found.

977
01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:22,600
Will? Will?

978
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:51,696
I think we got the son of a bitch.

979
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:57,732
You know, maybe it's
not the way we wanted it,

980
01:15:57,734 --> 01:15:59,704
but it's better than him...

981
01:16:02,806 --> 01:16:06,006
...winding up in some prison
playing cards every night

982
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:07,877
to his heart's content.

983
01:16:09,044 --> 01:16:10,681
So it's over?

984
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:14,549
Over?

985
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:16,818
Yes, it could be.

986
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:19,754
I think maybe

987
01:16:19,756 --> 01:16:22,189
I should check down at the station house

988
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:24,928
and go over Kellerman's background.

989
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:32,966
You know, Christi, why don't
you go on back home, honey?

990
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,737
I think, uh, it's been a long day.

991
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:38,376
I'll get an officer here to take you back.

992
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:43,911
Call me if you guys find anything.

993
01:16:43,913 --> 01:16:46,050
Yeah, sure.

994
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:52,655
Officer, make sure she gets
back to her place safely.

995
01:16:55,225 --> 01:16:59,861
This guy went to extreme
lengths to get our attention.

996
01:16:59,863 --> 01:17:03,100
Made sure we followed every
lead, found every victim.

997
01:17:05,735 --> 01:17:09,804
So why off yourself before
the game is finished?

998
01:17:09,806 --> 01:17:11,973
I mean, we don't even
know what the word is.

999
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,108
Guys like this,

1000
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:16,710
like Bundy, Gacy, Ramirez,

1001
01:17:16,712 --> 01:17:18,715
they don't just stop, Archer.

1002
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,483
So what are you saying to me?

1003
01:17:22,485 --> 01:17:27,221
You want this thing to
make some kind of sense?

1004
01:17:27,223 --> 01:17:29,957
Tie it up in some way?

1005
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:32,960
That's not the world, you know.

1006
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:35,496
You're still young enough to believe it is,

1007
01:17:35,498 --> 01:17:38,933
but things like sense and logic,

1008
01:17:38,935 --> 01:17:42,569
well, they, uh...

1009
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:46,508
they quit having any effect.

1010
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:49,710
I could never look at things from
your perspective. I never will.

1011
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:51,578
I'm not asking you to.

1012
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:54,515
Maybe you're not ready to
let this whole thing go.

1013
01:17:54,517 --> 01:17:55,950
Because that would mean, in a way,

1014
01:17:55,952 --> 01:17:59,457
that you're giving up on Jessica.

1015
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:06,863
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1016
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:11,965
Maybe I'm not.

1017
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,969
But I need to be sure, Archer.

1018
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:17,707
I need to be sure.

1019
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:24,912
That's an impossible wish, but go for it.

1020
01:18:24,914 --> 01:18:27,615
Let's go see Christi.

1021
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:30,952
Listen to her recordings.
Maybe she's got something.

1022
01:18:30,954 --> 01:18:34,154
Sure, why not?

1023
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:38,926
Spirit of sense and logic. I will go.

1024
01:18:38,928 --> 01:18:41,865
<i>Did you guys do that?!</i>

1025
01:18:43,033 --> 01:18:44,898
<i>Guys?!</i>

1026
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,068
<i>Holy sh...!</i>

1027
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:48,202
<i>Christi?!</i>

1028
01:18:48,204 --> 01:18:49,804
<i>Yeah!</i>

1029
01:18:49,806 --> 01:18:51,872
<i>One scar's not enough for you.</i>

1030
01:18:51,874 --> 01:18:53,142
<i>Guys!</i>

1031
01:19:18,301 --> 01:19:21,071
Ahh!

1032
01:19:24,341 --> 01:19:26,910
No, she's still not answering.

1033
01:19:38,154 --> 01:19:39,656
Christi!

1034
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:42,290
Christi!

1035
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:44,194
Come on. Shit.

1036
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:48,161
Goddamn it.

1037
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:50,197
I'm gonna run a trace on her phone.

1038
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:51,933
Yeah. Oh...

1039
01:19:51,935 --> 01:19:55,335
Hold it, hold it. Won't do any good.

1040
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:56,903
Son of a bitch.

1041
01:19:56,905 --> 01:19:59,141
Goddamn it, I told her to walk away.

1042
01:20:03,012 --> 01:20:04,781
Oh, fuck.

1043
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:14,024
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1044
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:21,161
I know who the killer is. Call dispatch.

1045
01:20:21,163 --> 01:20:25,768
Have them run a check on the
guy that sideswiped me last year.

1046
01:20:38,347 --> 01:20:41,017
I wouldn't move around
too much if I were you.

1047
01:20:47,356 --> 01:20:49,791
You know something?

1048
01:20:49,793 --> 01:20:53,294
We have a lot more in
common than you realize.

1049
01:20:53,296 --> 01:20:57,165
Scars... tell stories.

1050
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:03,170
Hmm... So, I think,

1051
01:21:03,172 --> 01:21:06,741
seeing as you've had to
focus on me this whole time,

1052
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:09,844
that it's only fair that
I turn the camera on you.

1053
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:11,712
So come on, Christi.

1054
01:21:11,714 --> 01:21:15,148
Let's have a little smile.
Our viewers are waiting.

1055
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,419
They're gonna track that feed,
and they're gonna come for me.

1056
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:20,188
Can you hear them? Can
you hear them coming?

1057
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:21,889
Can you?

1058
01:21:21,891 --> 01:21:24,192
Never came for me.

1059
01:21:24,194 --> 01:21:26,094
You think I didn't think of that?

1060
01:21:26,096 --> 01:21:28,395
You see, the thing is...

1061
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:31,198
we have plenty of time
before the cops show up.

1062
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,202
But, um, unfortunately,

1063
01:21:34,204 --> 01:21:36,437
- you don't.
- <i>He was part of the foster system.</i>

1064
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:39,206
- Next of kin?
- Next of kin, next of kin.

1065
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:41,876
Veronica Townsend was
his last foster parent.

1066
01:21:41,878 --> 01:21:44,112
Uh-huh. How about birth parents?

1067
01:21:44,114 --> 01:21:47,215
Birth parents, uh...
Dorothy Stewart, OD'd '97.

1068
01:21:47,217 --> 01:21:49,117
Uh, George Stewart, '98 suicide.

1069
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:52,152
Oh! George Stewart...

1070
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:53,187
hung himself.

1071
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:55,156
Hung himself.

1072
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:58,091
I think I know where he's
gonna take her, and why.

1073
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:00,995
What's the date of his father's death?

1074
01:22:00,997 --> 01:22:04,165
Wait a minute. October 9, 1998.

1075
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:07,768
He's celebrating the anniversary
of the death of his father.

1076
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,138
That's twenty years to the day!

1077
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,340
Holy shit.

1078
01:22:12,342 --> 01:22:13,844
Archer, where are we going?

1079
01:22:22,217 --> 01:22:24,050
Goddamn it! Fuckin' shit!

1080
01:22:24,052 --> 01:22:26,554
He hung himself in front of his child.

1081
01:22:26,556 --> 01:22:30,291
He did it at one of them pig farms off 28.

1082
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:32,960
Pig farm off 28? Archer,
Christi's not there.

1083
01:22:32,962 --> 01:22:35,129
What do you mean?

1084
01:22:35,131 --> 01:22:36,363
Those pig farms are
gone, man. They're gone.

1085
01:22:38,066 --> 01:22:40,167
What are you saying to me?

1086
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:42,002
That whole place got developed.
They're condos and golf courses.

1087
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:43,371
You serious?

1088
01:22:43,373 --> 01:22:45,139
- Ruiney.
- Hey, guys!

1089
01:22:45,141 --> 01:22:46,307
Okay, we've got visual confirmation

1090
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:48,376
that Christi is still alive

1091
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:51,344
from a live feed that he is
broadcasting on the Internet.

1092
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:53,313
Son of a bitch. You
guys got a trace on that?

1093
01:22:53,315 --> 01:22:57,184
No time for a trace,
Captain! What are you seeing?

1094
01:22:57,186 --> 01:22:59,187
<i>It's hard to say. I see...</i>

1095
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:01,988
<i>I see marble walls.
Um, I see plaques.</i>

1096
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:04,992
- <i>There's lots of plaques.</i>
- Oh, my God. Ruiney, where's he buried?

1097
01:23:04,994 --> 01:23:07,995
- Where's his father buried?
- Okay, so it's the state's responsibility

1098
01:23:07,997 --> 01:23:10,363
to bury the destitute
in a public graveyard.

1099
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:12,500
So where's the closest public graveyard?

1100
01:23:12,502 --> 01:23:15,068
Public mortuaries. We got
St. Catherine's, St. Joseph's.

1101
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:19,139
<i>Holy shit. Archer,
Sacred Heart Mausoleum.</i>

1102
01:23:19,141 --> 01:23:20,407
That's it.

1103
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:22,076
It's coming together.

1104
01:23:22,078 --> 01:23:24,045
He wants us there, Ruiney.

1105
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:26,546
Only we got to beat his timeline.

1106
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:28,616
That's how he knew the Reverend Green.

1107
01:23:28,618 --> 01:23:31,251
- How far away is SWAT?
- Approximately 20 minutes out.

1108
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:33,187
So please, please tell me
that you guys are closer!

1109
01:23:33,189 --> 01:23:35,223
<i>We'll be there in seven.</i>

1110
01:23:35,225 --> 01:23:37,394
I want all my units at that location now.

1111
01:23:39,061 --> 01:23:41,062
Now! Go! Go! Go!

1112
01:23:41,064 --> 01:23:44,130
Let's have a talk.

1113
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:46,166
Come on, Christi.

1114
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:49,937
You haven't figured this out yet?

1115
01:23:49,939 --> 01:23:53,006
Why the... Why the game?
Why the hangman game?

1116
01:23:53,008 --> 01:23:57,344
I dunno. This one just kinda stuck with me.

1117
01:23:57,346 --> 01:24:01,581
And also, there's a slight
thrill in being in control.

1118
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:04,885
You know, it's an
exhilarating feeling, you know,

1119
01:24:04,887 --> 01:24:08,288
being able to tell who lives and who dies.

1120
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,323
<i>And that justifies
killing innocent people?</i>

1121
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:12,660
You should really feel privileged

1122
01:24:12,662 --> 01:24:15,196
because I'm about to give
you a double value letter.

1123
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:17,497
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

1124
01:24:17,499 --> 01:24:20,968
I have more questions.

1125
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:23,970
Why do you redress the-the people?

1126
01:24:23,972 --> 01:24:27,008
If you just kill them,
why do you redress them?

1127
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:30,544
I used to work nights
in a department store.

1128
01:24:30,546 --> 01:24:34,081
<i>I used to dress the mannequins.</i>

1129
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:35,582
<i>They had to be perfect.</i>

1130
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:39,319
And I was in control.

1131
01:24:39,321 --> 01:24:43,057
S-So it's all about control.

1132
01:24:43,059 --> 01:24:45,393
And I get that. I get that.

1133
01:24:45,395 --> 01:24:47,661
Something happened to you in your past,

1134
01:24:47,663 --> 01:24:50,264
and you want to make it right.

1135
01:24:50,266 --> 01:24:52,133
You think you understand?

1136
01:24:52,135 --> 01:24:53,533
You think you understand?

1137
01:24:53,535 --> 01:24:55,937
You don't know shit!

1138
01:24:55,939 --> 01:24:57,638
You people don't know anything!

1139
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:01,041
You want to see control?!
You want to see control?!

1140
01:25:01,043 --> 01:25:03,710
I mean, I'll flick the switch
now. I don't have to wait!

1141
01:25:03,712 --> 01:25:05,947
Ten fifty-eight. Two minutes.

1142
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:08,081
I don't need that. You want to see control?

1143
01:25:09,718 --> 01:25:11,484
- <i>Watch...</i>
- <i>Fuck you!</i>

1144
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:13,720
If you're gonna kill me, just
kill me! Just do it already!

1145
01:25:13,722 --> 01:25:17,358
Now that's the spirit.

1146
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,031
<i>Yeah. We're just waiting
for one more player.</i>

1147
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,399
Can you feel it?

1148
01:25:26,401 --> 01:25:27,535
Huh?

1149
01:25:27,537 --> 01:25:30,173
One minute to go.

1150
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:42,616
He's not coming to save you.

1151
01:25:46,722 --> 01:25:49,525
I always thought journalists
smelled like pig shit.

1152
01:25:52,462 --> 01:25:54,495
Your time is up.

1153
01:25:54,497 --> 01:25:56,697
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! It's Archer!

1154
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:58,733
Oh, oh, Jimmy. No, no, no.

1155
01:25:58,735 --> 01:26:03,170
Just hold it, hold it a second.

1156
01:26:03,172 --> 01:26:04,975
It's me.

1157
01:26:06,508 --> 01:26:10,111
Don't, Detective.

1158
01:26:10,113 --> 01:26:14,115
Let's just talk for a
minute. You and I, Jimmy.

1159
01:26:14,117 --> 01:26:16,584
I remember the last time I saw you.

1160
01:26:16,586 --> 01:26:17,718
You were just up to here.

1161
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,356
Just a little boy.

1162
01:26:21,156 --> 01:26:23,390
About five or six years old.

1163
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:26,096
<i>I was a cop. I was doing my job.</i>

1164
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:29,563
Is that your daddy?

1165
01:26:29,565 --> 01:26:32,700
<i>When that day was over...</i>

1166
01:26:32,702 --> 01:26:34,602
I washed my hands of you.

1167
01:26:34,604 --> 01:26:36,036
I did. I know I did.

1168
01:26:36,038 --> 01:26:38,505
And I know now that was a mistake.

1169
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:40,541
It was a tragic mistake.

1170
01:26:40,543 --> 01:26:43,411
Jimmy, I remember those little eyes

1171
01:26:43,413 --> 01:26:47,514
looking at me as if...

1172
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:49,649
I was the one who killed
your father. But I didn't.

1173
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:50,718
I didn't do it.

1174
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,585
He hung himself.

1175
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:54,721
I was there, Jimmy.

1176
01:26:54,723 --> 01:26:57,323
I was there witnessing that trauma

1177
01:26:57,325 --> 01:26:58,792
that changed your whole life.

1178
01:26:58,794 --> 01:27:00,795
Don't you patronize me.

1179
01:27:00,797 --> 01:27:03,397
Oh, come on now. You don't need to do it.

1180
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:05,232
- I'm not gonna do anything!
- Don't you take another step!

1181
01:27:05,234 --> 01:27:07,300
What am I gonna do to you? You tell me.

1182
01:27:07,302 --> 01:27:09,370
I left you, Jimmy. I know.

1183
01:27:09,372 --> 01:27:13,773
And I forgot whatever
happened to that little boy.

1184
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:15,843
You want to know what happened
to that little boy Jimmy?

1185
01:27:15,845 --> 01:27:21,314
After losing my father and that house

1186
01:27:21,316 --> 01:27:25,251
I went through years of brutal pain.

1187
01:27:25,253 --> 01:27:28,154
Pain that you could only read about
in your stupid fuckin' police files.

1188
01:27:28,156 --> 01:27:31,559
But you got no idea, do you? No idea.

1189
01:27:33,596 --> 01:27:35,595
If I'd have done something,
if I had followed through,

1190
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:38,832
if I had inquired even about
how you were you doing, it was...

1191
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:42,335
- It would've been different, I'm sure...
- You know what, fuck you!

1192
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:44,572
<i>I've achieved heights of greatness</i>

1193
01:27:44,574 --> 01:27:47,207
that flatfoots like you only dream of.

1194
01:27:47,209 --> 01:27:51,211
And you know what? You know
who's to thank, Detective?

1195
01:27:51,213 --> 01:27:55,483
You know who kept me going through
all those years of abuse and neglect?

1196
01:27:55,485 --> 01:27:57,154
You know who that was?

1197
01:27:58,855 --> 01:28:03,691
It's you, Detective Archer. It's you.

1198
01:28:03,693 --> 01:28:07,495
I could've helped you. I know
that deep inside my heart.

1199
01:28:07,497 --> 01:28:11,665
Let me take this young woman's place.

1200
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:13,437
Don't.

1201
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:17,505
I was too damn callous.

1202
01:28:17,507 --> 01:28:19,473
I had no empathy.

1203
01:28:19,475 --> 01:28:22,242
And that is unforgiveable.

1204
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:26,714
I'm not asking for forgiveness. All
I'm asking you to do for me now...

1205
01:28:26,716 --> 01:28:29,383
let this woman go.

1206
01:28:29,385 --> 01:28:31,919
Do you really need her when you want me?

1207
01:28:31,921 --> 01:28:36,456
That's why this whole game
has taken place, because of me.

1208
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:38,526
Don't you mind-fuck me!

1209
01:28:38,528 --> 01:28:40,827
<i>I'm not doing that
at all. Listen to me.</i>

1210
01:28:40,829 --> 01:28:44,234
<i>Let's be fair. I'll stand
in her place right now.</i>

1211
01:28:46,302 --> 01:28:49,636
Don't do it, Jimmy.

1212
01:28:49,638 --> 01:28:53,174
Let's take her down and away.

1213
01:28:53,176 --> 01:28:56,210
Should she die for what I did?

1214
01:28:56,212 --> 01:28:58,912
- No, no, no. Jimmy, don't.
- Hey!

1215
01:29:07,323 --> 01:29:09,226
- You got her?!
- I got her.

1216
01:29:39,521 --> 01:29:40,653
Ahh!

1217
01:29:58,373 --> 01:29:59,473
Ruiney!

1218
01:29:59,475 --> 01:30:00,573
Ruiney!

1219
01:30:02,011 --> 01:30:03,847
Archer!

1220
01:30:06,681 --> 01:30:08,581
Archer. Hey.

1221
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:10,751
Archer, hey.

1222
01:30:10,753 --> 01:30:15,622
Hey, hang in there. Hey...

1223
01:30:15,624 --> 01:30:16,624
It's over.

1224
01:30:16,626 --> 01:30:18,925
The game is over.

1225
01:30:18,927 --> 01:30:20,960
Yeah, it's over. We got him.

1226
01:30:20,962 --> 01:30:23,563
I was...

1227
01:30:23,565 --> 01:30:24,932
the "I."

1228
01:30:24,934 --> 01:30:26,733
What?

1229
01:30:26,735 --> 01:30:29,803
Evict...

1230
01:30:29,805 --> 01:30:34,377
<i>Evictionem.</i>

1231
01:30:37,445 --> 01:30:40,350
I was... the "I."

1232
01:30:42,818 --> 01:30:46,553
No. Archer? Archer?

1233
01:30:46,555 --> 01:30:48,225
Archer!

1234
01:32:08,704 --> 01:32:10,603
Honor!

1235
01:32:10,605 --> 01:32:12,773
Ready!

1236
01:32:12,775 --> 01:32:14,575
Port!

1237
01:32:14,577 --> 01:32:15,811
Pull!

1238
01:32:17,879 --> 01:32:19,348
Ready!

1239
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:22,715
Fire!

1240
01:32:22,717 --> 01:32:25,454
Aim! Fire!

1241
01:32:26,721 --> 01:32:28,154
Aim!

1242
01:32:28,156 --> 01:32:30,590
Fire!

1243
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,328
Up and...

1244
01:33:50,972 --> 01:33:52,574
Hey, Mister.
