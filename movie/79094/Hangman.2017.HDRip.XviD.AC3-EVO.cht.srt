I'm just trying to get a better sense of who you are.

142
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:43,798
觀眾喜歡聯繫實際
Audiences really connect with personal stories of their subjects.

143
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:46,636
肯定的
Yeah, I'm sure they do.

144
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,769
沒有信息 -  我打擾你了嗎?
There's no information. - Oh, am I bothering you?

145
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,774
對不起 警官 沒有信息
I'm sorry, sir. There's no information.

146
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,744
有更新就通知我
Well, you just let me know when finding out

147
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:01,178
我妻子的事是當務之急 混蛋
what happened to my wife is a priority, asshole.

148
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:04,092

149
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:07,852
我相信那位警探
I trust that my detective

150
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,200
給了你所需要的一切
is giving you everything you need.

151
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,562
對 我們如坐針氈
Oh, yeah. We're, uh, tethered at the hip.

152
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:16,495
戴維斯小姐 我想提醒你
Miss Davies, I just want to remind you

153
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:19,669
你看到的屍體曾經是人

154
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:23,339
有家人 朋友 生活
With a family, friends, a life.

155
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,474
所以我相信你會對之
So I trust that you'll treat anything that you saw

156
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:28,440
施以絕對的關注
with absolute sensitivity.

157
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:29,846
肯定的
Definitely.

158
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:33,255
市長可能已經簽署同意了
And you know, the mayor may have signed off

159
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,016
所有的寵物項目 但我沒有
on this all access pet project, but I didn't.

160
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:40,152
如果你發表
If you print anything

161
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:43,288
中傷本案本局警探的文章
that compromises the work of my detectives in this case,

162
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,023
你會上法庭的
you will find yourself standing in a court of law.

163
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:48,159
我說得夠清楚嗎?
Do I make myself clear?

164
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,730
是的
Yes.

165
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:52,364
"是 隊長"
"Yes, Captain."

166
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:53,965
是 隊長
Yes, Captain.

167
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,621
請原諒
Can you excuse us, please?

168
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:56,551
謝謝
Thank you.

169
00:15:58,584 --> 00:15:59,792
我跟你說說阿徹
Let me talk to you about Archer.

170
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:08,379
派克醫生 請到病理科 一號房間
Dr. Parker, please report to pathology, room number one.

171
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,482
你好 有人在家嗎? - 派克醫生
Hello. Anybody home? - Dr. Parker.

172
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:16,221
大多數人都去釣魚
Uh, you know, most people go fishing.

173
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:19,124
魯內 以前給我說過此笑話
Oh, you know, Ruiney tried that joke on me earlier.

174
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:23,327
見鬼 - 現在不好笑了 你好
Ah, damn it. - Didn't work then. Hi.

175
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,462
見到你真好 - 就像以前一樣
So good to see you. - It's just like old times.

176
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:27,400
我想念你的擁抱
I missed your hugs.

177
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:31,741
抱歉
Whoa. - Sorry.

178
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:35,233
記者別在我面前晃
Yeah, get that press pass out of my face.

179
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:39,188
上次狗仔隊的案子 證據不見了
Last time we had paparazzi on a case, evidence went missing.

180
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:42,214
先生 我被提名為普利策獎
Sir, I've been nominated for a Pulitzer.

181
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:44,416
阿徹
Archer. - Yeah.

182
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:45,386
你認得她?
You recognize her?

183
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,923
不認得
No, I don't.

184
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:53,524
凱瑞·庫珀 24歲
Kerry Cooper, 24.

185
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,894
外語教師 沒有案底
Foreign language teacher. No record.

186
00:16:56,896 --> 00:17:00,065
父母三天前 申報此人失蹤
Parents filed a Missing Persons three days ago.

187
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,402
艾比 你有什麼要說的?
So, Abby, what do you got to say?

188
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:07,205
死因是窒息
Oh, well, cause of death is definitely asphyxiation,

189
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:09,387
這不奇怪
which isn't at all, you know, surprising.

190
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,308
死亡時間?
Time of death?

191
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:15,547
屍體當時還溫熱的
Well, the body was still warm when it got to us.

192
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,350
估計介於10:30到午夜
I'd say sometime between 10:30 and midnight.

193
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:25,923
我認為 當時她還活著
And I can tell you she was actually still alive when this happened.

194
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:28,425
看到不平衡的筆觸嗎?
You see the uneven strokes?

195
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,760
她掙扎過
She struggled.

196
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,803
知道用的什麼?
Any idea what was used?

197
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:36,395
大刀 也許是開箱刀?
A large knife. A box cutter maybe?

198
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,154
不能肯定 我得比較一下
I can't be sure until I have something to compare it to.

199
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:42,073
看起來像
Oh, also, it looks like

200
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,978
兇手在事後 重新替她裝扮過
the killer redressed her after the fact.

201
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:47,983
細緻 有目的
Meticulous. Purposeful.

202
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,652
還有
Oh, and also, uh,

203
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,451
她最近去過醫院急診室
you know, she has seen her fair share of the inside of ER.

204
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:57,388
骨盆骨折 肋骨斷了幾根
She's had everything from a broken pelvis to several broken ribs.

205
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,259
雖已痊癒 但都是最近才有的
They've healed, but they're all fairly recent.

206
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,362
你有什麼想法?家庭暴力?
What are you thinking? Like, what, domestic violence?

207
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,503
也許
Uh... perhaps.

208
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,372
這些挫傷呢?
What about these, uh, contusions here?

209
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:16,540
頭部嚴重打擊
Oh, uh, severe blows to the head.

210
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,946
只能假設 庫珀小姐是被敲擊致死
I mean, I can only presume that was to knock Miss Cooper out.

211
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,416
OK 謝謝 艾比
Okay. Thanks, Abby.

212
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,152
不客氣
Yeah, sure.

213
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:41,465
看起來她很像吸煙者
Looks like she was quite the smoker.

214
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,468
壞習慣
Nasty habit.

215
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,400
你們到底在找什麼?
So what is it you guys are looking for exactly?

216
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,643
我不太確定
Well... I'm not quite sure.

217
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,981
隨便找找
We're just looking.

218
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:58,262
看看這個
Oh, look at this.

219
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:00,473
看我找到了什麼
Look what I found.

220
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,360
喬伊·楚門
Joey Truman.

221
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,394
她的父母說
Her parents said

222
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:12,463
她和喬伊出去約會了
she went out on a date with Joey.

223
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,633
喬伊  - 阿徹
Joey... - Archer.

224
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:19,073
魯內 去查查這個喬伊的地址
Hey, Ruiney. Let's get an address on this guy Joey.

225
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:34,088
我要吐了
I think I'm gonna be sick.

226
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:11,524
喬伊
Joey.

227
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:14,572
是那傢伙的?
You think that's our guy?

228
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:16,998
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

229
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,767
她父母沒有給我太多線索
You know, parents didn't give me much.

230
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,239
他們說認識他 但從沒見過他
They said they knew him, but they never met him.

231
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:30,411
你好
Oh, hello.

232
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:45,126
我們去取證
Let's get Forensics in here.

233
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:06,211
徽章號碼是什麼意思? - 不知道
Then why the badge numbers? - I don't know why,

234
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:09,480
但問題足夠大 足以讓我退休也不安寧
but it's big enough to get me out of retirement.

235
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:11,449
需要幫忙嗎?
Help you with something?

236
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:14,486
你可以
Yeah, you can.

237
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:18,388
我在找一個叫喬伊·楚門的傢伙
I'm looking for a fella named Joey Truman.

238
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,458
他會在某個地方嗎?
Would he be around somewhere?

239
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,531
你要喬伊做什麼?
What do you want with Joey?

240
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,530
我不想什麼 只想談談
I don't want anything, just want to talk to him.

241
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,701
他在裏面
Huh. Yeah, yeah, he's inside.

242
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:31,135
請自便
Knock yourself out.

243
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,238
謝謝 - 在這裏等著
Oh, okay. Thank you. - Wait here.

244
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,407
喬伊 警察來了
Hey, Joey! The cops are here!

245
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:38,643
警察 別動
Police! Don't move!

246
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:39,747
別動
Don't move!

247
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,972
趴下
Stay down!

248
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:49,686
我什麼都沒做
I didn't do anything.

249
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:51,291
閉嘴 趴下
Shut up! Stay down!

250
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:03,634
警探
Detectives!

251
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:05,369
警探
Detectives!

252
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,843
你沒事吧? 沒事
You all right? - Yeah.

253
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,330
對不起 - 喬伊 怎麼了?
I'm sorry. - Joey, what's wrong?

254
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:35,735
喬伊 - 我稍後再解釋
Joey. - I'll explain later. I'll explain later.

255
00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:58,224
我什麼都沒做
Hey, I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything!

256
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:23,250
幫我 夥計們 幫我
Help me out, guys! Help me out!

257
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,596
親愛的
Okay, honey. Honey!

258
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,266
親愛的 別動 - 我放棄
Honey, hold it, hold it... - All right!

259
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:43,034
更喜歡退休 阿徹?
Still prefer retirement, Archer?

260
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:45,539
我從來不喜歡退休
I never preferred retirement.

261
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,545
看起來
it looks like the abuse

262
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:55,913
不單虐待
wasn't the only thing

263
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:57,684
凱瑞還有很多瞞著父母的事
Kerry kept from her parents.

264
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:02,386
她看起來毫無擔憂
She doesn't look worried.

265
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:05,690
沒錯 她甚至沒問她為什麼被帶進來
Yeah, she didn't even ask why she was being brought in.

266
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,292
最好讓我來審問
Better let me do the questioning,

267
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,827
讓她的律師好好忙活一陣子
otherwise her attorney will have a field day.

268
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:13,867
你盡情表演吧
Your show, buddy. Your show.

269
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:21,168
我很抱歉跑路的事情
Look, I'm sorry I ran. Okay?

270
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:23,740
我害怕了
I was scared.

271
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:25,172
你看起來沒有害怕
You didn't look scared.

272
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,511
你看起來根本不害怕
Right, you didn't look scared.

273
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:28,967
我一直很好
Look, I've been doing so good.

274
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:31,548
我剛淨身幾個月
Okay? I just been clean for a couple months,

275
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,718
我疏忽了
and I just slipped up.

276
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,586
"疏忽"?這有點輕描淡寫 你不覺得嗎?
"Slipped up"? That's a bit of an understatement, don't you think?

277
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:39,390
你在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

278
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:40,791
說的是你女朋友
I'm talking about your girlfriend,

279
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:42,795
凱瑞·庫珀小姐
Miss Kerry Cooper.

280
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:50,968
不 她有時喜歡粗暴
No, no. She liked it rough sometimes.

281
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,601
你顛倒了 她是侵略者
Okay? And you have it backwards. She was the aggressor.

282
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:57,255
你不覺得我有腫塊和瘀傷嗎?
You don't think I have my own bumps and bruises from her?

283
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:58,956
這是雙向的
It went both ways.

284
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,515
聽起來有理
Well, that's comforting to hear.

285
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:07,518
我不指望你能理解
Look, I don't expect you to understand.

286
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,216
沒錯
I don't.

287
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,807
我從沒見過像她這樣的人
I never met anybody like her.

288
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:12,703
她把我當人看
And she didn't treat me like I was some screw-up.

289
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,724
所以我害怕失去她
Yeah. - So I was scared I was gonna lose her.

290
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:20,434
我嚇壞了 當時我們吵架了
I freaked out, okay? We got into a fight...

291
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,441
有沒有身體傷害?
Did it get physical?

292
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:27,943
有 但並非我弄的
Yeah, yeah, but it wasn't like that. Okay?

293
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,610
我像瘋了一樣道歉
And I apologized like crazy.

294
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,865
我們正設法解決問題
And we're working things out.

295
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:36,734
你最後一次見到她是什麼時候?
When was the last time you saw her?

296
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,083
上個星期
Last week.

297
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,785
把她送到學校
Dropped her off at the school.

298
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:41,790
她說她會打電話來
She said she would call,

299
00:25:41,815 --> 00:25:45,152
但是 她需要一些時間
but... she just needed some time.

300
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,726
給她打電話
Look, call her.

301
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:51,008
你會知道的 我又沒傷害她 我發誓
You'll see. I didn't hurt her again. I swear.

302
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:56,099
所以
So...

303
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:58,435
我們現在可以問她嗎?
should we ask her now?

304
00:25:58,437 --> 00:25:59,850
我想已經太晚了
I think it's too late.

305
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:07,816
這不是凱瑞
This is not Kerry.

306
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:13,151
那不是她
That's not... That's not her.

307
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:15,019
我們所要處理的 - 這不是...
It's what we're dealing with here. - That's not...

308
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:16,408
不 - 那不是凱瑞
No, no, no. - That's not Kerry.

309
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:17,636
你怎麼了?
What's the matter with you?

310
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,123
我要見她
I need to see her.

311
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,829
馬上 我要馬上見她
Right now! I need to see her right now!

312
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:27,503
她死了嗎?
Is she dead?

313
00:26:28,768 --> 00:26:30,798
是 她死了
Yes, she's dead.

314
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,467
不 她沒死
No. She's not dead.

315
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:36,173
拜託別告訴我
Please don't tell me that. Please don't tell me that.

316
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,010
那不是凱瑞 絕不是她
That's not Kerry. That's not her!

317
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:42,017
我要馬上見她
I need to see her right now!

318
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:43,644
讓我看看她
Let me see her!

319
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,438
不可能 - 拜託
That can't happen. - Please.

320
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,786
別告訴我她...
Please don't tell me that she's...

321
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:49,817
阿徹
Archer.

322
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:52,194
請告訴我
Please tell me...

323
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:01,703
我們就
Let's just, uh,

324
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:04,471
先休息一下
take a little break here.

325
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,738
那不是她
That's not her.

326
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,105
要喝一杯嗎?
You want a drink?

327
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:11,642
水或汽水怎麼樣?
How 'bout I get you a water or a soda?

328
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:13,882
我給你拿杯汽水
I'll get you a soda.

329
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:27,959
所以
So...

330
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:30,090
你還認為是她幹的?
You still think she did it?

331
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:33,360
她只是承認玩得很粗暴
Well, she just admitted to playing rough.

332
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,133
但那會讓她成為殺人犯嗎?
But does that make her a murderer?

333
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:37,902
我不知道 鬼知道
I don't know. Who knows?

334
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:39,908
有時她們開始玩 然後
You know, sometimes they start playing and then

335
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:41,786
升級
it escalates.

336
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,807
我見識過
I've seen it.

337
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:45,876
不 這不合理
No, this doesn't track.

338
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:48,813
習慣性的家庭暴力在本質上衝動
Habitual domestic violence is impulsive in nature.

339
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:51,051
我們的罪犯 有算計 有條理
Our perp is calculated, methodical.

340
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:54,406
她不是我們要找的人
She's not our guy.

341
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:57,855
上帝 警探
Oh, my God. Detectives!

342
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:58,923
上帝
Oh, my God!

343
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,159
操
Fuck!

344
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:41,261
房間裏的汽水 你們動動腦子好嗎?
What the hell were you two thinking leaving a soda can in the room?

345
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,702
還留露易絲·萊恩一個人
Especially with Lois Lane outside your door.

346
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:46,136
你不知道用紙杯嗎?
Have you ever heard of a paper cup?

347
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:49,039
休息室裏起碼有150個紙杯
Because we have 150 of them in the break room.

348
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,275
對不起 我搞砸了
Yeah, look. I'm sorry. I screwed up.

349
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:52,980
你說得對 你搞砸了
Yeah, you're damn right you screwed up.

350
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:58,281
魯內 我知道你還沒緩過來
Look, Ruiney. I know what you're still going through, all right?

351
00:28:58,283 --> 00:29:01,018
但你真應埋頭破案
But you have got to get your head in the case.

352
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,100
特別是本案
In this case.

353
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:06,891
否則你最好再休息一段時間
Or you're gonna have to take some more time off.

354
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:09,106
不 我行
No, I got this. It's good. I got it.

355
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:13,830
你有什麼想法嗎 隊長 那女孩怎麼樣了?
So do you have any idea, Captain, how the girl's doing?

356
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:16,767
醫生說她情勢危急 但現在穩定了
The doctor said she was touch and go for a while, but she's stable now.

357
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:18,669
很好
That's good.

358
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:22,173
她也能給出不在場證明
She was also able to give an alibi, which checks out.

359
00:29:22,175 --> 00:29:26,078
雷 你來這裏是因為禮貌
And Ray, you're here as a courtesy.

360
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:32,115
你不再是警察了所以別經手
You're not a cop anymore. So don't push it.

361
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,339
好的 隊長
Okay, Captain.

362
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:37,957
你們倆 在我改變主意前 離開辦公室
Both of you, get the hell out of my office before I change my mind.

363
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:52,336
鑒證科發現了人類血液
So, Forensics found traces of human blood

364
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:56,007
與凱瑞臥室裏的動物血混在一起

00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:09,086
我不知道 親愛的 咱倆彼此彼此
I don't know, honey. Your guess is as good as mine.

我看了人事文件 這是地址

374
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,218
你聽到了嗎?

這邊
Yeah, this way.

378
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:03,809
天啊 真不敢相信我又回到教堂了
Oh, God. I can't believe I'm back in the church again.

379
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,750

00:33:17,443 --> 00:33:20,411
即使是現在 我只允許和前犯人一起
Um, even now, I'm only allowed to work with ex-cons

419
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:22,083
試圖重新開始
trying to start over.

420
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:25,253
神父 我們有麻煩了
Well, Reverend, we got a problem here.

421
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:28,484
事實上我們有兩個問題
Actually, we got two problems.

422
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,321
兩個?我不明白
Two? I don't... I don't follow.

423
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:33,929
你看 神父 有個死人
You see, Reverend, there's a dead guy

424
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:35,687
在你的教堂裏搖擺
swinging in your church.

425
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:37,912
你認識他 對吧?吉恩·威爾遜?
You knew him, right? Gene Wilson?

426
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:40,631
他是看門的
Yeah, he was the janitor.

427
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:43,433
他怎麼這麼晚才來?
What was he doing here so late?

428
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:45,435
他隨時都可以打掃
He cleans whenever he can.

429
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:50,426
他剛剛獲釋 正在尋找一個新的開始
He... he was just released and was looking for a fresh start.

430
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:56,916
你在想什麼?
What are you thinking?

431
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,356
神父 我們要你寫下
Reverend, we're gonna need you to write down

432
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:10,227
你最近三天的行蹤
exactly your whereabouts the last three days.

433
00:34:10,229 --> 00:34:12,395
這不成問題
Okay. Yeah, that's not a problem.

434
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:15,065
我在斯普林菲爾德
Um, I was in Springfield,

435
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,366
給客人布道
uh, giving a guest sermon

436
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:18,635
在一神教世界教會
at the Unitarian Universal Church.

437
00:34:18,637 --> 00:34:20,403
我今晚才回來
Um, I just got back tonight...

438
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:22,394
OK
Okay. Okay.

439
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:26,109
凱瑞·庫珀小姐呢?
How about Miss Kerry Cooper?

440
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:28,279
你怎麼認識她的?
How did you know her?

441
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:31,247
庫珀 我似乎不認識
Cooper, I don't... I don't... I don't believe I do.

442
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:34,250
你不認識她? - 不
You don't know her? - No.

443
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:37,053
那你就得做些解釋
Well, you're gonna have to do some explaining then

444
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:38,488
因為你的血
because your blood

445
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,745
在她的公寓裏
was in her apartment.

446
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,707
我的血在她...  我沒有
My blood in her... I don't... I don't have...

447
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:52,004
你肯定不會相信的
Y-Y-You're not gonna believe this.

448
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:58,497
坦率地說 我自己都不明白
Frankly, I... I... I still don't understand it myself.

449
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:01,712
但是幾個月前
But, um, a couple of months ago,

450
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:03,714
我半夜醒來
I woke up in the middle of the night

451
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:05,549
有人站在我旁邊
with someone standing over me.

452
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:06,563
一個男人
A man.

453
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:09,352
他  我掙扎
And he... I struggled,

454
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:13,723
但他朝我臉上噴了些東西
but he put something over... over my face.

455
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,989
最終我昏倒了
And eventually, I passed out.

456
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:19,064
當我醒來
When I woke up...

457
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:25,368
我的手臂上有血  我意思是 血滴下我的胳膊
...there was... there was blood coming out of my arm. I mean, it was dripping down my arm.

458
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,917
就像我中了一槍什麼的
Like I'd gotten a shot or something. So...

459
00:35:28,254 --> 00:35:32,524
你是說有個人
Okay, so you're telling us that a guy

460
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:36,513
闖進你家 偷走了你的血?
broke into your house and stole your blood?

461
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:37,982
這就是你要講的故事?
That's the story you're telling?

462
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:39,095
我剛才說了
That's... I told you...

463
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,706
我說過你不會相信我的
I told you you wouldn't believe me.

464
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,290
我聽過一些故事
Well, I've heard some stories.

465
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,459
但這倒提醒我
But you know, this rings a bell to me.

466
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:52,192
想起來 這算一種巧合
Yeah, it's kind of a coincidence when you think of it.

467
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,611
上星期四  我不知道我是否告訴過你
Last Thursday... I don't know if I told you.

468
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,472
我半夜醒來
I woke up in the middle of the night.

469
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,891
出於某種原因
And for some reason,

470
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,852
我穿著粉紅色的芭蕾舞短裙
I had a pink tutu on.

471
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:08,249
有羽毛伸出我的屁股
And a serious fuzzy feather sticking out of my ass.

472
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,486
你說得對
You know, you're right.

473
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:14,130
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

474
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:58,298
這些天  他不讓自己看這些文件
These days, you know, he can't bring himself to look inside that file.

475
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:04,368
但他不能放手
But he's unable to let it go.

476
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,427
所以他才緊閉信封
That's why he keeps it so close.

477
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:12,544
阿徹 我想你應該看看
Archer, there's something that I think you need to look at.

478
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:16,446
你想讓我看看?
You want me to look at that?

479
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,050
請吧
Please.

480
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:25,076
你我都知道 你不應出現在附近的
You and I both know you're not supposed to be anywhere near here.

481
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:29,095
這對本案很重要
This is important to this case.

482
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:32,164
拜託
Please.

483
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:40,437
起初 看起來像隨機的斜線標記
At first, it just looks like random slash marks.

484
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:42,442
媽的
Oh, shit!

485
00:37:44,176 --> 00:37:45,645
我不知道 我認為
I don't know. I think...

486
00:37:47,646 --> 00:37:49,281
我很抱歉
I'm so... so sorry.

487
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,624
我錯過了
I missed it.

488
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:01,596
我錯過了
I missed it.

489
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:06,566
當時發生了這麼多事情
So much was going on at the time, you know, it was...

490
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,202
全都是...
It was all...

491
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:15,742
你不是先知
You had no way of knowing then.

492
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,681
我是介紹人
You know, I introduced them to each other.

493
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,258
她讓我帶她去過道
She asked me to walk her down the aisle...

494
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:37,363
把她送走
...to give her away.

495
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:43,299
我沒有看出來
I don't see how

496
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:44,868
我本可以錯過的
I could have missed it.

497
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,774
你都不知道自己在找什麼
You didn't even know what you were looking for back then.

498
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,477
你離它太近了
You were too close to it.

499
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,185
OK
Okay.

500
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:06,292
幹得好 克裏斯蒂
Good work, Christi.

501
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:22,573
至少有十幾個目擊者
There are at least a dozen witnesses

502
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:24,975
見證他在斯普林菲爾德的教堂裏
that can place him in that church in Springfield.

503
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:28,377
我查了三月前的報告
And I checked out the report from three months ago.

504
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,480
格林神父說的是真話
Turns out Reverend Green is telling the truth.

505
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:34,850
實驗室在他的血液裏發現了氯仿
Lab found traces of chloroform in his blood.

506
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:37,254
有沒有報告丟失的東西?
No items were reported missing?

507
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:39,223
唯一丟失的就是他的DNA
The only thing missing was his DNA.

508
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:40,857
這毫無意義
This doesn't make any sense.

509
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,526
不 隊長
No, Captain, it does.

510
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:45,328
他想讓我們去教堂
He wanted us to go to that church.

511
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,830
這傢伙絕對是個神經病
This guy is definitely a psychopath.

512
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:50,566
但我會把他歸類為有條理的殺手
But I would classify him as an organized killer.

513
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:54,004
這些襲擊 絕非隨機或自發的狂熱
There's nothing random or spontaneous, frenzied, about these attacks.

514
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:57,640
他們已經計劃好了 他設置了受控場景 讓我們去找
They're planned. He leaves a controlled scene for us to find.

515
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,910
我們要找的是一個25到35的白人男性
I think we're looking for a white male, 25-to-35.

516
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:01,778
極高的智商
Extremely high IQ.

517
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,281
這豬頭怎麼辦?
And what about this... this pig head business?

518
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:09,953
豬頭 警察 也許他只是在嘲弄你們
Pigs. Cops. Maybe he's just taunting you guys.

519
00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:12,855
所有信息不得離開此房間 懂嗎?
Okay, this information doesn't leave this room. Do you understand me?

520
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,725
當然 - 如果被媒體獲取
Of course. - If the media gets a hold of this,

521
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:16,859
他們會在幾秒鐘內把這變成狂熱
they're gonna turn this into a frenzy in seconds.

522
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,566
如果我有決定權 你現在就得回家
And if I had it my way, you would go home now.

523
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:24,901
格林神父的不在場證明 那是什麼意思?
So with Reverend Green's alibi checking out, then what does that mean?

524
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:27,703
這是否意味著我們又回到了起點?
I mean, does this mean we're back to square one?

525
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,742
我們根本沒有起點
We're not even on square one.

526
00:40:32,711 --> 00:40:34,714
這都是劊子手遊戲
You see, it's all about the hangman game.

527
00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:41,685
到目前為止 我們有兩起兇殺案
So far, we have two homicides.

528
00:40:41,687 --> 00:40:45,258
但是 我們有三個字母
But... we have three letters.

529
00:40:46,658 --> 00:40:48,658
這意味著
Which means...

530
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,029
我們還沒找到第一個受害者
we haven't even found the first victim yet.

531
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:55,935
而且 根據遊戲板判斷
And, judging by the game board...

532
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,569
他會再殺七人
he's gonna kill seven more people.

533
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:04,674
與以前的受害者相同的模式
Same pattern as previous victim.

534
00:41:04,676 --> 00:41:06,575
眼睛點狀出血
Petechial hemorrhages in the eyes,

535
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:09,613
脖子上有繃帶痕跡
look, the ligature marks around the neck.

536
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:13,621
死因:再次窒息
Cause of death was asphyxiation again.

537
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,354
罪犯給下一個受害者留下了線索
Our perp's been leaving us clues to the next vic.

538
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:19,723
目前為止 我們還有很多事要做
So far, we haven't got much to go on.

539
00:41:19,725 --> 00:41:21,825
你有沒有注意到有什麼異常?
Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?

540
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:24,560
沒有 - 死亡時間?
No, nothing. - Time of death?

541
00:41:24,562 --> 00:41:27,830
昨晚十點到午夜的時候
Uh, sometime between ten and midnight last night.

542
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,238
23點准
It was eleven p.m. sharp.

543
00:41:30,803 --> 00:41:34,571
很難那麼精確
Well, it's a little difficult to be that precise.

544
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:38,454
他的勞力士壞了 停在了23點
Well, his Rolex broke. Right there. Eleven p.m.

545
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:41,916
但很明顯 昨晚那塊表壞了
But clearly last night, that watch didn't fit him.

546
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:44,680
我對勞力知之甚少
I don't know too much about Rolexes,

547
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:47,452
但我知道校工不會戴著名表到處亂跑
except I do know janitors aren't running around wearing them.

548
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:50,687
那不是他的表
That's not his watch.

549
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:54,091
你想把這個給打印出來嗎? - 當然
Yeah. You want to dust this for prints? - Sure.

550
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:56,859
他太聰明了
No, he's too smart for that.

551
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:59,062
告訴我 23點
Tell me. Eleven p.m.,

552
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,131
符合所有受害者的時間範圍對吧?
that'd fit into the time frame for all the victims, right?

553
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:04,437
正確 警探
Yeah. That would be correct, Detective.

554
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:10,475
幹嘛? - 24小時
What? - Twenty-four hours.

555
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:19,149
劊子手每24小時就會在23點殺一個人
Hangman is gonna kill someone at eleven p.m. every 24 hours.

556
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:24,888
下一個受害者倒下前 還有2.5小時
So that gives us two and a half hours before the next victim falls.

557
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,656
夥計們 我們遺漏了什麼?一定的
Come on, guys. What are we missing? There's got to be something.

558
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:29,125
等等 繃帶痕跡
Oh, wait. Uh, the ligature marks,

559
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:32,028
不像以前的受害者
they weren't like the previous victim.

560
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,131
為什麼? - OK
Why? - Well, okay,

561
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:38,000
看 是豬皮做的
see, they were made of the pigskin.

562
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:40,000
豬皮? - 對
Pigskin? - Yeah.

563
00:42:40,004 --> 00:42:41,971
我能幫上忙
I think I can help here.

564
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:46,910
食監局在豬肉上貼有序列號
The FDA stamps serial numbers on all their meat,

565
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,915
以防在污染的情況下 能跟蹤
so in case of contamination, they can trace it.

566
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:54,084
就是這樣
That's it.

567
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:56,388
讓隊長傳食監局
Let's get the captain to wake up the FDA.

568
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:00,459
幹的好 艾比
Good stuff, Abby.

569
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:11,066
你沒事吧?- 沒事
You okay? - Yeah.

570
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:13,705
我稍後想跟你談談
I just need to talk to you about something after this.

571
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:50,008
你那邊 - 呆在這
Go that way. Stay here.

572
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:02,488
很有趣
Well, this is fun.

573
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:17,836
夥計們?
Guys?

574
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:48,033
阿徹
Archer!

575
00:45:24,736 --> 00:45:26,172
是你們幹的嗎?
Did you guys do that?!

576
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:33,646
夥計們
Guys!

577
00:45:36,214 --> 00:45:37,517
夥計們
Guys!

578
00:45:39,984 --> 00:45:41,750
媽的
Holy...!

579
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,223
克裏斯蒂
Christi!

580
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:08,278
我看見他了 - 你沒事吧?
I saw... I saw him! I saw him, I saw him! - You all right?

581
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,714
我看到他了
I think I saw him.

582
00:46:15,787 --> 00:46:19,055
因為我晚上鎖門的
Yeah, because I did lock it up at night.

583
00:46:19,057 --> 00:46:22,024
已經死後僵直了?
We got rigor mortis already?

584
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:24,861
沒有 他是真的凍僵
Uh, no. He's actually frozen stiff.

585
00:46:24,863 --> 00:46:27,229
確定死者的身份要花時間
Identifying our vic is gonna take time.

586
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:29,265
驗屍前我得先把屍體預熱一下
I'll have to warm up the body before doing the autopsy.

587
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:30,933
可能需要一個星期
That could take up to a week.

588
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:33,770
等等 我們沒有一周
Wait. We don't got a week.

589
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:35,071
我知道
I know.

590
00:46:35,073 --> 00:46:36,805
很幸運 我們又有24小時了
We're lucky we even have 24 hours.

591
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:38,140
威爾?
Eh, Will?

592
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:43,081
為什麼肉不凍?
Hey, how come the meat isn't frozen?

593
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:45,745
這裏有多冷?
How cold is it in here?

594
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:48,581
那邊有個恆溫器
There's a thermostat over there.

595
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:50,583
37度
It's, uh, 37 degrees.

596
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:54,957
那可凍不住肉
Oh, well none of that meat's frozen in there.

597
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,189
為什麼人凍僵了?
So how come our guy's frozen stiff?

598
00:46:57,995 --> 00:47:01,330
他不是一塊肉
Well, he's not a-a slab of meat.

599
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:04,868
他水密度更大
And he has more water density.

600
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,303
任何長期暴露 即使在那個溫度
So, any prolonged exposure, even at that temp,

601
00:47:07,305 --> 00:47:08,904
會使他腐爛
would cause him to decompose.

602
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:10,911
沒過多久吧?
Well, hasn't been here long, has he?

603
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:14,832
他在這裏多久了?這地方全天都開著
How long has he been here? This place been open all day.

604
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,902
也許有人
You know, you would think someone

605
00:47:18,704 --> 00:47:21,872
看到僵硬的死人掛在這裏了
might have seen a stiff, dead guy hanging in here.

606
00:47:22,538 --> 00:47:24,283
是不是? - 我同意
Don't you think? - I agree, yes.

607
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,466
如果屍體是濕的
Now, if his body was wet,

608
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:30,931
凍僵會快一點嗎?
would that make him freeze faster?

609
00:47:31,363 --> 00:47:33,267
當然會
Yes, of course it would.

610
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:35,330
阿徹 你在想什麼?
Archer, what are you thinking?

611
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,463
我在想
Well, I'm thinking...

612
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:40,841
我想迅速冰鎮啤酒的時候
when I want my beer to chill faster,

613
00:47:42,274 --> 00:47:44,971
我用濕紙巾把啤酒包起來
I wrap it in a wet paper towel.

614
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:48,220
他被帶到這裏之前就已經濕了
He was already wet before he was brought in here.

615
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:49,749
沒錯
There you go.

616
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:56,218
我想這傢伙要我們搜河
I think this boy wants us to sweep the river.

617
00:48:03,095 --> 00:48:05,761
阿徹 我想你應該告訴他
Archer, I think you should tell him.

618
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:09,966
有多少個家庭
Yeah. You know how many hundreds of families

619
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:13,403
我得轉告去這些怪誕故事
I had to tell these grotesque stories

620
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:15,807
關於他們的親人是怎麼死的
of how their loved ones died.

621
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:19,345
但不應如此
But it was nothing like this.

622
00:48:22,847 --> 00:48:25,180
OK 給我幾分鐘
Okay, so, uh, can you give me a minute?

623
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:26,515
當然
Yeah, of course.

624
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:28,319
照片來了
Yeah. - Here's the photo.

625
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:40,835
這太花時間了
This is taking too long.

626
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:43,821
還剩8小時46分鐘
Eight hours, 46 minutes left.

627
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:45,823
狗屁遊戲
Bullshit game.

628
00:48:49,207 --> 00:48:52,341
我知道那表情 阿徹你直說
I know that look, Archer. Just say what you got to say.

629
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,313
我要給你看點東西
I need to... I need to show you something.

630
00:48:57,082 --> 00:48:59,381
什麼? - 來自傑西的檔案
What? - From Jess's file.

631
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:01,283
傑西的檔案?
Jess's file?

632
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,453
是張照片
It's a photo.

633
00:49:03,455 --> 00:49:04,988
傑西檔案裏的照片?
A photo from Jess's file?

634
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:07,444
阿徹 你到底在幹什麼?
Archer, what the hell are you doing?

635
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,361
我們都知道她打了一架
look, we both know she put up a fight.

636
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,196
我們錯過了
We missed it.

637
00:49:14,198 --> 00:49:15,365
錯過了什麼?
Missed what?

638
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:16,901
這裏
Here.

639
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:23,669
在她的胸口刻著一個字母 "V"
There's a letter "V" carved in her chest.

640
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:27,176
這是他的第一個受害者
This was his first victim.

641
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:30,180
不 阿奇 - 什麼
No, Arch, no. This is... - What?

642
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:32,182
完全不同的伎倆 阿徹
This is a completely different MO, Archer.

643
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:33,816
她沒有被吊死
She wasn't hung.

644
00:49:33,818 --> 00:49:36,451
我們發現她的時候 還不知道伎倆
We didn't know the MO at the time we found her.

645
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:39,189
阿徹 不同的伎倆 她沒有被吊死
Archer, it's a different MO. She wasn't hung.

646
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,546
她沒有吊死 是因為
She wasn't hung because...

647
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:47,343
他被打斷了儀式
he was interrupted from his ritual.

648
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,496
他沒有機會吊死她 你明白嗎?
He didn't get a chance to hang her, you understand?

649
00:49:55,573 --> 00:49:57,841
你何不重新排演一下
Why don't you walk me through what happened

650
00:49:57,843 --> 00:50:01,013
就在你進門之前
right before you went through the door.

651
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:05,917
來吧
Go ahead.

652
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:18,332
傑西打電話給我
Jess called me up...

653
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:22,086
讓我回家
and told me to come home.

654
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,190
說我們應該試著解決問題
Said we should try and work things out.

655
00:50:26,925 --> 00:50:30,803
所以 我回到家 我把車停在車道上
So, I got home, I parked my car in the driveway...

656
00:50:32,794 --> 00:50:34,215
走了後門
went down the back,

657
00:50:35,914 --> 00:50:39,885
摘了一些鬱金香給她
picked some... tulips to give her.

658
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:44,419
就像我以前那樣
You know, just like I used to.

659
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:47,223
這樣他就有機會知道 有人在那裏
That would've given him a chance to know someone was there,

660
00:50:47,225 --> 00:50:49,828
那會阻止他的
and that would've stopped him.

661
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,167
她在我懷裏的時候 他還在屋裏
Or he was still in the house while she was in my arms.

662
00:51:19,691 --> 00:51:22,392
夥計們 給我找個人
Guys, get me somebody to...

663
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:23,459
讓開
Move!

664
00:51:40,412 --> 00:51:42,948
埃裏克·安德森
Eric Anderson.

665
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:56,426
放鬆 魯內 放鬆
Easy, Ruiney, easy.

666
00:51:56,428 --> 00:51:58,026
沒時間了 阿徹
No time, Archer.

667
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:03,602
那聲音
Where's that sound...

668
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:06,604
來自哪裏
...coming from?

669
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:13,211
地下室
Basement.

670
00:52:46,211 --> 00:52:47,546
夥計
Oh, man.

671
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:51,513
看看這個
Look at this.

672
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:53,462
庫珀的學校
This is Cooper's school.

673
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,488
這是門羅市的模型
This is a replica of Monroe.

674
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:02,424
我現在知道了
I think I know now

675
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:04,694
去哪裏找下一個受害者
where we're gonna find our next victim.

676
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:06,966
福斯托裏亞鐵路 我們走
This is the Fostoria Line. Let's go.

677
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:20,676
北向南的福斯托裏亞鐵路 哥倫比亞和哈里森站
NS/Fostoria Line at Columbia and Harrison.

678
00:53:20,678 --> 00:53:23,214
緊急情況 關閉該鐵道線
This is an emergency. Shut that line down.

679
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,651
他可能還活著 因為我們打破了這個神經病的時間線
He may still be alive, because we beat this psycho's timeline.

680
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:30,520
魯內 - 我看到了
Ruiney! - Yes, I see it.

681
00:53:30,522 --> 00:53:33,192
他在那兒
There he is.

682
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:40,264
魯內 你什麼也做不了
Ruiney. Ruiney, there's nothing you can do!

683
00:53:41,633 --> 00:53:43,135
魯內 火車
Ruiney! The train!

684
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:47,307
他還活著
He's still alive!

685
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:51,339
我們得上去幫他 - 這是鋼絲繩
We need to get up there to help him! - It's a steel cable!

686
00:53:56,414 --> 00:53:57,551
快
Come on!

687
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:01,551
抓住他 - 快點 把它從脖子上拿下來
Get him! - Come on, get it off your neck!

688
00:54:01,553 --> 00:54:04,453
從脖子上取下 快
Get it off your neck! Come on!

689
00:54:04,455 --> 00:54:05,754
快離開鐵道
Gotta get off the track!

690
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:07,557
我不會扔下他的
I'm not leaving him!

691
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,625
火車來了 快 - 我不會扔下他
Train's coming! Come on! - I'm not leaving him!

00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:11,694
阿徹
Archer!

693
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:13,863

快拿開
Just get it off! Get it off!

696
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:21,537
我們得離開 - 我不會扔下他
We got to go! - I'm not leaving him!

697
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:24,272
魯內 我們得馬上離開鐵道
Ruiney! We got to get off that track now!

698
00:54:46,464 --> 00:54:48,763
克裏斯蒂 克裏斯蒂?
Christi! - Christi?

699
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:51,600
夥計們 你沒事吧?
Guys! Are you okay?

700
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:52,664
我靠
Holy shit!

701
00:54:53,403 --> 00:54:55,540
我靠 上帝
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

702
00:55:06,517 --> 00:55:08,618
你到底在幹什麼?
What the hell were you doing?

703
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,165
我本可以救他的
I could've saved him.

704
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:13,622
火車撞到他之前 他已經死了
He was dead before the train hit him.

705
00:55:13,624 --> 00:55:15,524
胡說
That is bullshit!

706
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:17,627
你是唯一可以被救的人
You're the only one who could've been saved here.

707
00:55:17,629 --> 00:55:20,196
那不是你的使命
That was not your call to make. It was not your call to make!

708
00:55:20,198 --> 00:55:23,799
是我的使命 我會告訴你我的使命
It was my call. You know, I'll tell you what my call is.

709
00:55:23,801 --> 00:55:27,636
我的使命是...你在追鬼魂
My call is... that you're chasing a ghost.

710
00:55:27,638 --> 00:55:30,173
你在追鬼魂 夥計
You're chasing a ghost, buddy.

711
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:32,810
你會送命的 肯定
And that will get you killed. That's for sure.

712
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:37,568
這就是你想要的嗎?
Is that what you want?

713
00:55:38,383 --> 00:55:39,881
我才不在乎
Look, I don't give a fuck.

714
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:41,484
沒錯 別管了
That's right, don't give a fuck.

715
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:43,553
不管什麼?你的生命?
Don't give a fuck about what? Your life?

716
00:55:43,555 --> 00:55:45,720
沒命 自然不需要管了
You don't care if you die, do you?

717
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:47,995
我們都死了最好
Let's all die. Come on. That's easy.

718
00:55:49,408 --> 00:55:51,342
那我們就不用再擔心傑西卡了
Then we don't have to worry about Jessica anymore.

719
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:53,395
或者劊子手
Or the Hangman.

720
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:55,335
我們全都去死好了
Let's all die.

721
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,968
我不該告訴你的 那是個錯誤
I should've never told you. That was a mistake.

722
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:01,316
什麼? - 你在崩潰
What? - You are cracking

723
00:56:01,673 --> 00:56:02,760
我要崩潰了? - 沒錯
I'm cracking? - Yes, you are.

724
00:56:03,274 --> 00:56:04,640
我要崩潰了? - 沒錯
I'm cracking?! - That's right!

725
00:56:04,642 --> 00:56:05,908
是你離開的
You're the one who left, okay?! - Oh...

726
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,509
你走了 - 我走了
You left! - I left.

727
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:08,578
我留在警隊 你走了
I stayed on the force! You left!

728
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,017
你在改寫歷史
You're rewriting history!

729
00:56:10,615 --> 00:56:12,714
我退休了 我沒有放棄
I retired. I didn't quit!

730
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:14,283
夥計們 別鬧了
You guys, knock it off!

731
00:56:14,285 --> 00:56:17,149
你求我回來 我回來了
You begged me to get back! I came back!

732
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:20,855
從那時起 我就和你在一起

733
00:56:20,857 --> 00:56:22,825
我很高興

我是說 一定有聯繫
I mean, there's gotta be a connection.

我們很幸運

一個傷疤已經夠了

853
01:05:59,135 --> 01:06:01,203
她應該受到審問
I mean, I think she should be questioned.

854

她是唯一看到劊子手的人

位於偏僻的地方

我預感有壞事要發生

869
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:58,998
有個傢伙
There was this guy,

870
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:03,365
他就在我後面
and he just came up, um, behind me

871
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:06,104
他把我打倒在地
and he knocked me down and...

872
01:07:07,937 --> 01:07:10,040

用刀架在我脖子上

被分派到本案的警探
The detective who was assigned to the case...

876
01:07:24,455 --> 01:07:26,109

他發誓要找到兇手

我不知道他為什麼這麼在乎

他找到那傢伙了

為什麼你們要這麼做

他們不明白你放棄了多少

這個故事
So, this story,

889
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:27,985
不是關於我的 而是關於..

We don't have the resources to put a team on a homicide

902
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:25,439

連環殺手停止的原因只有三個

908

909
01:09:43,394 --> 01:09:46,463
二 我們抓住他們 也不可能

912
01:09:54,404 --> 01:09:56,670
聽起來很有可能

913
01:09:56,672 --> 01:10:00,509
因為一些不相關的指控而入獄

看看所有被關進監獄的人
to look at everybody who was put in prison

917
01:10:05,348 --> 01:10:07,081
從傑西被謀殺的那段時間起

921
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:15,090
這就是問題所在 我們沒時間了
Yeah, that's the problem. We don't have the time.

922
01:10:15,092 --> 01:10:17,792
我們需要一種方法來完善搜索
So we need to figure out a way to refine the search.

923
01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:21,095
但是 我認為這人是針對你們的
But, I think that this is personal to you guys.

924
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:23,532

He put your badge numbers on that desk for a reason.

925
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:25,997
她說的對 他叫我們出去
She's right. He called us out.

926
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:29,917
所以 讓我們來完善搜索
So, let's refine the search to us.

927
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:33,442
過去一年裏 你逮捕的每一個人

932
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:34,809
他就是那種人
He's that kinda guy.

933
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:38,366
拜託 告訴我你有發現

01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:22,600
威爾
Will? Will?

964
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:51,696
我們抓到了那個狗娘養的
I think we got the son of a bitch.

965
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:57,732
也許並非我們的預料
You know, maybe it's not the way we wanted it,

966
01:15:57,734 --> 01:16:00,139
但起碼比他...
but it's better than him...

967
01:16:02,806 --> 01:16:06,006
每晚在監獄裏玩紙牌要好
...winding up in some prison playing cards every night

968
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:07,877
他的良心
to his heart's content.

969
01:16:09,044 --> 01:16:10,681
結束了?
So it's over?

970
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:13,386
結束?
Over?

971
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:16,818
可能
Yes, it could be.

972
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,891
我想也許
I think maybe

973
01:16:19,756 --> 01:16:22,189
我應該去車站看看
I should check down at the station house

974
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:24,928
調研凱勒曼的背景
and go over Kellerman's background.

975
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:32,966
克裏斯蒂 你為什麼不回家 親愛的?
You know, Christi, why don't you go on back home, honey?

976
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,737
漫長的一天
I think, uh, it's been a long day.

977
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:38,376
我會讓警官帶你回去
I'll get an officer here to take you back.

978
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:43,911
如果你們發現什麼就打電話給我
Call me if you guys find anything.

979
01:16:43,913 --> 01:16:46,050
當然
Yeah, sure.

980
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:52,655
警官 確保她能安全地回到住處
Officer, make sure she gets back to her place safely.

981
01:16:55,225 --> 01:16:59,306
這傢伙竭盡全力引起我們的注意
This guy went to extreme lengths to get our attention.

982
01:16:59,331 --> 01:17:02,568
確保我們跟蹤每個線索 找到每個受害者
Made sure we followed every lead, found every victim.

983
01:17:05,735 --> 01:17:09,066
在比賽結束之前 你為什麼要離開?
So why off yourself before the game is finished?

984
01:17:09,806 --> 01:17:11,973
我們都不知道這個詞是什麼
I mean, we don't even know what the word is.

985
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,108
像這樣的人
Guys like this,

986
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:16,710
像邦迪 加西 拉米雷斯
like Bundy, Gacy, Ramirez,

987
01:17:16,712 --> 01:17:18,715
他們不會住手的 阿徹
they don't just stop, Archer.

988
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,483
你在跟我說什麼?
So what are you saying to me?

989
01:17:22,485 --> 01:17:27,221
你想讓這合理化?
You want this thing to make some kind of sense?

990
01:17:27,223 --> 01:17:29,957
用某種方式;聯繫起來?
Tie it up in some way?

991
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:31,881
世界不是這樣的
That's not the world, you know.

992
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:35,496
你還年輕到足以相信
You're still young enough to believe it is,

993
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:38,933
但感覺和邏輯
but things like sense and logic,

994
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,390
他們
well, they, uh...

995
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:46,508
他們不再有任何影響
they quit having any effect.

996
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:49,415
我從來沒有從你的角度看問題 我永遠不會
I could never look at things from your perspective. I never will.

997
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,000
我不是在要求你
I'm not asking you to.

998
01:17:51,025 --> 01:17:53,960
也許你還沒準備好讓這一切過去
Maybe you're not ready to let this whole thing go.

999
01:17:53,985 --> 01:17:56,881
因為這意味著 在某種程度上
Because that would mean, in a way,

1000
01:17:58,086 --> 01:17:59,691
你要放棄傑西卡
that you're giving up on Jessica.

1001
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:06,849
也許你是對的
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1002
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:11,965
也許我不是
Maybe I'm not.

1003
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,969
但我需要確定 阿徹
But I need to be sure, Archer.

1004
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:17,707
我需要確定
I need to be sure.

1005
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:24,116
不可能的願望 但去吧
That's an impossible wish, but go for it.

1006
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,615
我們去看看克裏斯蒂
Let's go see Christi.

1007
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:30,952
聽她的錄音 也許她有什麼東西
Listen to her recordings. Maybe she's got something.

1008
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,734
當然 為什麼不?
Sure, why not?

1009
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:37,947
理智和邏輯 我會去的
Spirit of sense and logic. I will go.

1010
01:18:38,928 --> 01:18:41,865
是你們幹的嗎?
Did you guys do that?!

1011
01:18:43,033 --> 01:18:44,898
夥計們?
Guys?!

1012
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,068
天啊
Holy sh...!

1013
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:48,202
克裏斯蒂?
Christi?!

1014
01:18:49,806 --> 01:18:51,872
一個傷疤對你來說還不夠
One scar's not enough for you.

1015
01:18:51,874 --> 01:18:53,142
夥計們
Guys!

1016
01:19:24,341 --> 01:19:26,910
她還是不接電話
No, she's still not answering.

1017
01:19:38,154 --> 01:19:39,656
克裏斯蒂
Christi!

1018
01:19:41,436 --> 01:19:42,670
克裏斯蒂
Christi!

1019
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,194
快 媽的
Come on. Shit.

1020
01:19:45,477 --> 01:19:47,106
該死的
Goddamn it.

1021
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:50,197
我要跟蹤她的手機
I'm gonna run a trace on her phone.

1022
01:19:51,935 --> 01:19:55,335
等等 不會有什麼好處的
Hold it, hold it. Won't do any good.

1023
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:56,903
狗娘養的
Son of a bitch.

1024
01:19:56,905 --> 01:19:59,141
該死 我叫她走開
Goddamn it, I told her to walk away.

1025
01:20:03,012 --> 01:20:04,781
媽的
Oh, fuck.

1026
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:14,024
上帝
Oh, my God.

1027
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:21,161
我知道兇手是誰 呼叫調度
I know who the killer is. Call dispatch.

1028
01:20:21,163 --> 01:20:25,768
讓他們查一下去年撞我的那個傢伙
Have them run a check on the guy that sideswiped me last year.

1029
01:20:38,347 --> 01:20:41,017
如果我是你 我不會移動太多
I wouldn't move around too much if I were you.

1030
01:20:47,356 --> 01:20:49,791
你知道些什麼?
You know something?

1031
01:20:49,793 --> 01:20:53,294
我們的共同點比你想像的要多
We have a lot more in common than you realize.

1032
01:20:53,296 --> 01:20:57,165
傷疤...有故事
Scars... tell stories.

1033
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:03,170
所以我想
Hmm... So, I think,

1034
01:21:03,172 --> 01:21:06,741
既然你一直都在關注我
seeing as you've had to focus on me this whole time,

1035
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:09,844
我把相機對準你是公平的
that it's only fair that I turn the camera on you.

1036
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:11,712
來吧 克裏斯蒂
So come on, Christi.

1037
01:21:11,714 --> 01:21:15,148
微笑一下 觀眾在等著呢
Let's have a little smile. Our viewers are waiting.

1038
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,419
他們會追蹤信號 他們會來找我的
They're gonna track that feed, and they're gonna come for me.

1039
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:20,188
你能聽到嗎?你能聽到他們來了?
Can you hear them? Can you hear them coming?

1040
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:21,889
你能嗎?
Can you?

1041
01:21:21,891 --> 01:21:24,192
從沒找到我
Never came for me.

1042
01:21:24,194 --> 01:21:26,094
你以為我沒想到嗎?
You think I didn't think of that?

1043
01:21:26,096 --> 01:21:28,395
你看 問題是
You see, the thing is...

1044
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:31,198
在警察出現之前 我們有的是時間
we have plenty of time before the cops show up.

1045
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,202
但是不幸的是
But, um, unfortunately,

1046
01:21:34,204 --> 01:21:36,437
你沒有時間了 - 他是寄養制度的一部分
you don't. - He was part of the foster system.

1047
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:39,206
近親? - 近親
Next of kin? - Next of kin, next of kin.

1048
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:41,876
維羅妮卡·湯森是他最後的養母
Veronica Townsend was his last foster parent.

1049
01:21:41,878 --> 01:21:44,112
親生父母怎麼了?
Uh-huh. How about birth parents?

1050
01:21:44,114 --> 01:21:47,215
親生父母  多蘿茜·斯圖爾特 死於97年

喬治·斯圖爾特
Oh! George Stewart...

1053
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:53,187
上吊自殺

1054
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:55,156
上吊自殺
Hung himself.

1055
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:58,091
我想我知道他要帶她去哪裏
I think I know where he's gonna take her, and why.

1056
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:00,995
他父親去世的日期是幾時?
What's the date of his father's death?

1057
01:22:00,997 --> 01:22:04,165
等一會 1998年10月9日
Wait a minute. October 9, 1998.

1058
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:07,768
他在慶祝他父親逝世的週年紀念日
He's celebrating the anniversary of the death of his father.

1059
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,138
等了20年 為那一天
That's twenty years to the day!

1060
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,340
我靠
Holy shit.

1061
01:22:12,342 --> 01:22:13,844
阿徹 我們要去哪裏?
Archer, where are we going?

1062
01:22:22,217 --> 01:22:24,050
該死的
Goddamn it! Fuckin' shit!

1063
01:22:24,052 --> 01:22:26,554
他把自己吊死在孩子面前
He hung himself in front of his child.

1064
01:22:26,556 --> 01:22:30,291
就在其中一個養豬場
He did it at one of them pig farms off 28.

1065
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:32,960
養豬場?阿徹 克裏斯蒂不在那裏
Pig farm off 28? Archer, Christi's not there.

1066
01:22:32,962 --> 01:22:35,129
你是什麼意思?
What do you mean?

1067
01:22:35,131 --> 01:22:36,363
那些豬場沒有了 夥計 消失了
Those pig farms are gone, man. They're gone.

1068
01:22:38,066 --> 01:22:40,167
你在跟我說什麼?
What are you saying to me?

1069
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:42,002
整個地方都被開發了 現在是公寓和高爾夫球場
That whole place got developed. They're condos and golf courses.

1070
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:43,371
你說真的?
You serious?

1071
01:22:43,373 --> 01:22:45,139
魯內 -  夥計們
Ruiney. - Hey, guys!

克裏斯蒂還活著
that Christi is still alive

1074
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:51,344
他在網上實況轉播
from a live feed that he is broadcasting on the Internet.

1075
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:53,313
狗娘養的 你們能跟蹤嗎?
Son of a bitch. You guys got a trace on that?

1076
01:22:53,315 --> 01:22:57,184
沒時間跟蹤了 隊長 你在看什麼?
No time for a trace, Captain! What are you seeing?

1077
01:22:57,186 --> 01:22:59,187
一言難盡
It's hard to say. I see...

1078
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:01,988
我看到了大理石牆 我看到了瓷磚
I see marble walls. Um, I see plaques.

1079
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:04,992
有很多瓷磚 - 天哪 魯內 他葬在哪裏?
There's lots of plaques. - Oh, my God. Ruiney, where's he buried?

1080
01:23:04,994 --> 01:23:07,995
他父親葬在哪裏? - 這是國家的責任
Where's his father buried? - Okay, so it's the state's responsibility

1081
01:23:07,997 --> 01:23:10,363
赤貧者 埋葬在公共墓地

就是它
That's it.

1086
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:22,076
合理了
It's coming together.

1087

他要我們去那邊 魯內
He wants us there, Ruiney.

1088
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:26,546
我們必須擊敗他的時間表
Only we got to beat his timeline.

1089
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:28,616
他就是這麼認識格林神父的
That's how he knew the Reverend Green.

1090
01:23:28,618 --> 01:23:31,251

How far away is SWAT? - Approximately 20 minutes out.

1091
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:33,187
說你們更近了

來吧 克裏斯蒂
Come on, Christi.

1097
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:48,440
你還沒想通?
You haven't figured this out yet?

1098
01:23:49,782 --> 01:23:52,849
為什麼遊戲?劊子手遊戲為了什麼?
Why the... Why the game? Why the hangman game?

1099
01:23:53,008 --> 01:23:56,156
我不知道原因
I dunno. This one just kinda stuck with me.

1100
01:23:57,346 --> 01:24:01,581
在控制中有輕微的快感
And also, there's a slight thrill in being in control.

1101
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:04,289
令人振奮的感覺
You know, it's an exhilarating feeling, you know,

1102
01:24:04,314 --> 01:24:07,715
能夠予取予奪
being able to tell who lives and who dies.

1103
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,323
這就意味著殺無辜的人?
And that justifies killing innocent people?

1104
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:12,660
你真的應該感到榮幸
You should really feel privileged

1105
01:24:12,662 --> 01:24:15,196
因為我要給你雙重字母
because I'm about to give you a double value letter.

1106
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:17,497
等等
Wait. Wait.

1107
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,347
我有更多問題
I have more questions.

1108
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:23,970
你何必替那些人換裝?
Why do you redress the-the people?

1109
01:24:23,972 --> 01:24:26,170
如果你只為殺人 何必換裝?
If you just kill them, why do you redress them?

1110
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:30,544
我以前在百貨公司夜班
I used to work nights in a department store.

1111
01:24:30,546 --> 01:24:34,081
我過去常給模特穿衣服
I used to dress the mannequins.

1112
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:35,582
他們必須是完美的
They had to be perfect.

1113
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:38,807
盡在我的掌控之中
And I was in control.

1114
01:24:39,321 --> 01:24:43,057
這一切都是關於控制的
S-So it's all about control.

1115
01:24:43,059 --> 01:24:45,393
我明白了
And I get that. I get that.

1116
01:24:45,395 --> 01:24:47,291
你的過去怎麼了
Something happened to you in your past,

1117
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:49,917
你想糾正
and you want to make it right.

1118
01:24:50,266 --> 01:24:52,133
你以為你明白?
You think you understand?

1119
01:24:52,135 --> 01:24:53,533
你以為你明白?
You think you understand?

1120
01:24:53,535 --> 01:24:55,616
你什麼都不知道
You don't know shit!

1121
01:24:55,939 --> 01:24:57,638
你們這些人什麼都不知道
You people don't know anything!

1122
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:01,041
你想看控制?
You want to see control?! You want to see control?!

1123
01:25:01,043 --> 01:25:03,710
我現在就開關 我無需等待
I mean, I'll flick the switch now. I don't have to wait!

1124
01:25:03,712 --> 01:25:05,947
1058 兩分鐘
Ten fifty-eight. Two minutes.

1125
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:08,081
我不需要 你想看控制?
I don't need that. You want to see control?

1126
01:25:09,718 --> 01:25:11,484
看著 - 操你
Watch... - Fuck you!

1127
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:13,720
要殺就殺 就這樣吧
If you're gonna kill me, just kill me! Just do it already!

1128
01:25:13,722 --> 01:25:16,345
就是這調調
Now that's the spirit.

1129
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,031
我們再等一個玩家
Yeah. We're just waiting for one more player.

1130
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,399
你能感覺到嗎?
Can you feel it?

1131
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,173
還有一分鐘
One minute to go.

1132
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:42,616
他不會來救你的
He's not coming to save you.

1133
01:25:46,722 --> 01:25:49,525
我一直以為記者聞起來像豬糞
I always thought journalists smelled like pig shit.

1134
01:25:52,462 --> 01:25:54,495
你的時間到了
Your time is up.

1135
01:25:54,497 --> 01:25:56,697
吉米 我是阿徹
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! It's Archer!

1136
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:58,733
吉米 不
Oh, oh, Jimmy. No, no, no.

1137
01:25:58,735 --> 01:26:03,170
等一下
Just hold it, hold it a second.

1138
01:26:03,172 --> 01:26:04,975
是我
It's me.

1139
01:26:06,508 --> 01:26:08,897
不要 警探
Don't, Detective.

1140
01:26:10,113 --> 01:26:14,115
我們先聊一會 你和我 還有吉米
Let's just talk for a minute. You and I, Jimmy.

1141
01:26:14,117 --> 01:26:16,584
我記得上次見你的時候
I remember the last time I saw you.

1142
01:26:16,586 --> 01:26:17,718
你剛到這裏
You were just up to here.

1143
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,356
只是個小男孩
Just a little boy.

1144
01:26:21,156 --> 01:26:23,390
大約五或六歲
About five or six years old.

1145
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:26,096
我曾經是警察 履行職責
I was a cop. I was doing my job.

1146
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:29,563
那是你爸爸嗎?
Is that your daddy?

1147
01:26:29,565 --> 01:26:31,728
當那天結束的時候
When that day was over...

1148
01:26:32,545 --> 01:26:34,445
我棄你於不顧
I washed my hands of you.

1149
01:26:34,604 --> 01:26:36,036
是我幹的
I did. I know I did.

1150
01:26:36,038 --> 01:26:38,505
我現在知道這是個錯誤
And I know now that was a mistake.

1151
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:40,541
悲劇性的錯誤
It was a tragic mistake.

1152
01:26:40,543 --> 01:26:43,411
吉米 我記得那些小眼睛
Jimmy, I remember those little eyes

1153
01:26:43,413 --> 01:26:45,867
看著我 彷彿
looking at me as if...

1154
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:49,649
是我殺了你父親 但我沒有
I was the one who killed your father. But I didn't.

1155
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:50,718
不是我幹的
I didn't do it.

1156
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,585
他上吊自殺的
He hung himself.

1157
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:54,721
我當時在那裏 吉米
I was there, Jimmy.

1158
01:26:54,723 --> 01:26:57,323
我親眼目睹了創傷
I was there witnessing that trauma

1159
01:26:57,325 --> 01:26:58,792
這改變了你的一生
that changed your whole life.

1160
01:26:58,794 --> 01:27:00,795
你不要高我一等
Don't you patronize me.

1161
01:27:00,797 --> 01:27:03,397
別這樣 你不需要這麼做
Oh, come on now. You don't need to do it.

1162
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:05,232
我什麼也不會做 - 別再走了
I'm not gonna do anything! - Don't you take another step!

1163
01:27:05,234 --> 01:27:07,300
我要怎麼對你?你告訴我
What am I gonna do to you? You tell me.

1164
01:27:07,302 --> 01:27:09,370
我扔下了你 吉米
I left you, Jimmy. I know.

1165
01:27:09,372 --> 01:27:13,773
我忘了那個小男孩發生了什麼
And I forgot whatever happened to that little boy.

1166
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:15,843
你想知道那個小男孩吉米怎麼了嗎?
You want to know what happened to that little boy Jimmy?

1167
01:27:15,845 --> 01:27:20,135
在失去父親和那房子之後
After losing my father and that house

1168
01:27:21,316 --> 01:27:24,781
我經歷了多年的殘酷痛苦
I went through years of brutal pain.

1169
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:28,131
你只能警察檔案裏讀到的痛苦
Pain that you could only read about in your stupid fuckin' police files.

1170
01:27:28,156 --> 01:27:31,559
但你絕不知道
But you got no idea, do you? No idea.

1171
01:27:33,596 --> 01:27:35,595
如果我當時有跟進
If I'd have done something, if I had followed through,

1172
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:38,832
如果我詢問過你的感覺
if I had inquired even about how you were you doing, it was...

1173
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:42,335
將會不同 我相信  - 去你媽的
It would've been different, I'm sure... - You know what, fuck you!

1174
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:44,572
我已經達到了偉大的高度
I've achieved heights of greatness

1175
01:27:44,574 --> 01:27:47,207
你那種警察夢寐以求的高度
that flatfoots like you only dream of.

1176
01:27:47,209 --> 01:27:51,211
知道嗎?該感謝誰 警探?
And you know what? You know who's to thank, Detective?

1177
01:27:51,213 --> 01:27:55,483
是誰讓我經歷了這麼多年的虐待和忽視?
You know who kept me going through all those years of abuse and neglect?

1178
01:27:55,485 --> 01:27:57,154
知道那是誰嗎?
You know who that was?

1179
01:27:58,855 --> 01:28:03,691
是你 阿徹警探 是你
It's you, Detective Archer. It's you.

1180
01:28:03,693 --> 01:28:07,495
我本可以幫你的 我內心深處知道
I could've helped you. I know that deep inside my heart.

1181
01:28:07,497 --> 01:28:11,665
讓我取代這個年輕女人
Let me take this young woman's place.

1182
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:13,437
不要
Don't.

1183
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:17,505
我太無情了
I was too damn callous.

1184
01:28:17,507 --> 01:28:19,473
我沒有同情心
I had no empathy.

1185
01:28:19,475 --> 01:28:22,242
不可原諒
And that is unforgiveable.

1186
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:26,714
我不是在請求寬恕 我現在要你
I'm not asking for forgiveness. All I'm asking you to do for me now...

1187
01:28:26,716 --> 01:28:29,383
放走這個女人
let this woman go.

1188
01:28:29,385 --> 01:28:31,919
你想抓我 你真的需要她嗎?
Do you really need her when you want me?

1189
01:28:31,921 --> 01:28:36,456
整個遊戲都都因為我
That's why this whole game has taken place, because of me.

1190
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:38,526
別騙我
Don't you mind-fuck me!

1191
01:28:38,528 --> 01:28:40,827
我絕不會的 聽我說
I'm not doing that at all. Listen to me.

1192
01:28:40,829 --> 01:28:44,234
公平一點 我取代她
Let's be fair. I'll stand in her place right now.

1193
01:28:46,302 --> 01:28:48,198
別這樣 吉米
Don't do it, Jimmy.

1194
01:28:49,638 --> 01:28:52,410
放了她
Let's take her down and away.

1195
01:28:53,176 --> 01:28:56,210
她應該為我的所作所為而死嗎?
Should she die for what I did?

1196
01:28:56,212 --> 01:28:58,912
不 吉米 不要
No, no, no. Jimmy, don't. - Hey!

1197
01:29:07,323 --> 01:29:09,226
你抓住她了? - 我抓到她了
You got her?! - I got her.

1198

堅持一下
Hey, hang in there. Hey...

1204
01:30:15,624 --> 01:30:16,624
結束了
It's over.

1205
01:30:16,626 --> 01:30:18,925
遊戲結束了
The game is over.

1206
01:30:18,927 --> 01:30:20,960
結束了 我們抓到他了
