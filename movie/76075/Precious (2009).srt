00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,733
那就好
Okay.

143
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,889
我不知道什么是选修学校
I don't know what alternative school is.

144
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:33,890
不过我想知道
I feel I wanted to know.

145
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:38,126
我的内心无比温暖
My heart is all warm inside.

146
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,292
因为维彻先生认为我是好学生
Mr. Wicher thinks I'm a good student.

147
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:44,735
我知道了人生的意义
I knew the life mean.

148
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:06,892
学校帮不了白痴
School ain't gonna help nut.

149
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,283
你给我好好混混救济金就行
Take your ass down to the welfare.

150
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,279
你他妈的以为她是谁
Who the fuck you think she is?

151
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:15,713
你现在是不是觉得自己很可爱啊
So I guess you think you are cute now, right?

152
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:18,296
丑陋的婊子
Oh, ugly bitch.

153
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,798
你他妈的早该把嘴闭紧了
You should have kept your fucking mouth shut!

154
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,393
只管生你的孩子就行
Just keep on giving you more children to give me.

155
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,548
你他妈的还以为自己很特别啊
You think you are some fucking special?

156
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:29,657
你们全他妈给我滚蛋
Fuck you and fuck him!

157
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,390
珍爱
Precious!

158
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,549
珍爱
Precious!

159
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,356
珍爱
Precious!

160
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,478
你给我下来  贱人
Get down here, bitch!

161
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:44,952
你都把那个白人带来了
You brought that white bitch up into my house!

162
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,895
你怎么不让那婊子直接进来啊
You, why don't you bring that bitch up in here!

163
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:48,932
不是我带来的
I didn't bring her here.

164
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,140
那她为什么不停地按我的门铃
So why the fuck did she ring my buzzer?

165
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:54,755
珍爱  我听不清你说的
I can't hear you, Precious,

166
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,839
你他妈给我靠近一点
Since you got so much motherfucka mouth.

167
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,605
你不希望她进这个屋子
And you won't bring that bitch up in my house.

168
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:00,843
那她为什么不停地按那该死的门铃
Why would that bitch ring my god damn buzzer?

169
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:02,437
又不是我叫她来的
I didn't call her to come here.

170
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:03,905
你现在是不是觉着
See, I think...right now,

171
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:06,172
自己是个成熟的女人了
You feel like you've become a little grown woman?

172
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:08,205
我可看见了你在厨房干的好事
'Cause I shot you porn in the kitchen.

173
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,107
我真不应该饶了你
I should have fuck you up,

174
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,659
但我还是放过你了
but I let you walk away.

175
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,625
让你自己去整理这一切
And I let you come to get yourself together,

176
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:14,837
贱人  我可警告你了
but bitch, I'm gonna let you know

177
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:16,801
如果你再把屎盆子扣我头上
if you even pour that shit on me again,

178
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:19,476
你他妈就死定了
that would be your last motherfucking day standing.

179
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:20,507
我保证
I promise you that.

180
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:23,142
你竟然把一个白种女人引来
You wanna send a white bitch to my motherfucker buzzer,

181
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,853
谈什么高等教育
talk about some higher education.

182
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:26,362
你真他妈的脑子有问题
You are a dummy bitch.

183
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:28,106
你什么都不知道
You will never know shit,

184
00:12:28,107 --> 00:12:30,631
没人想要你  没人需要你
Don't know nobody want you, don't know nobody need you.

185
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:33,227
你他妈跟我男人有一腿
You know fucking around fuck my mother fucking man

186
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:35,269
还操他妈的有了2个孩子
and had two motherfucking children.

187
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,081
其中一个还跟畜生一个样
And one of them is a godamm animal,

188
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:39,870
到处鬼混
running around looking crazy as a mother fucker.

189
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,180
婊子  我觉得...
Bitch, you know what, see I think you...

190
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:44,601
我觉得你这是在考验我
I think you try me,

191
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,219
我觉得你真的是在玩弄我
I think you really try to fuck with me.

192
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,778
你他妈的浪费我的钱
You are fucking with my money

193
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,009
你竟然那么高高在上地看着我
and you would stand up there looking down at me

194
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,667
你他妈的以为你是钱啊
like your mother fucking money.

195
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:54,658
我得给你颜色看看
I'll show you what real women do bitch!

196
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,255
你他妈的不知道一个做娘的重担
So you don't know what real mother fucking woman do.

197
00:12:57,256 --> 00:12:59,255
你他妈的不知道一个女人牺牲了多少
Real mother fucking woman sacrifice.

198
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:01,671
当初真该他妈的把你做了
I should have aborted your mother fucking ass

199
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:02,808
我操你妈个逼的
'cause you were shit.

200
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:05,457
我还记得你出生那天
I know the day the doctor puts you my goddamn head.

201
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,040
你他妈的不是个东西
You wasn't a goddamn thing.

202
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,215
那时你还洋洋得意  贱人
You had that smug on your face, bitch!

203
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:11,169
你给我滚出去
Get outta fucking here.

204
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:12,598
给我笑一笑
Now smile about that!

205
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,733
你给我笑一笑  你个肥婊子
Smile about that, you fat bitch!

206
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:17,313
婊子
Bitch!

207
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:20,167
我得给你点颜色瞧瞧
I'm gonna tell you bitch!

208
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:05,633
你真的该睡了
You really need to get some rest.

209
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,514
明天可是个大日子
You have such a big day ahead of you tomorrow.

210
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:12,161
记着  妈妈爱你
And remember, Mommy loves you.

211
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:26,914
珍爱  你知道我爱你
Precious, you know I love you.

212
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:30,064
我会把那个白人赶出去
I'm gonna kick that whitey outta my house.

213
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:31,829
搬来跟我一起住吧
Move you in with me.

214
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:33,851
想住在西彻斯特吗
Wanna live West Chester?

215
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,814
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

216
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,909
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

217
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:28,440
别忘了付我的赊账  记得拿上找零
Make sure you pay my 8.52 and tell them in bucks.

218
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:33,721
再买些糖回来
And get some candy lit.

219
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,037
回来的路上别忘了
After where you at.

220
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:45,777
珍爱  我们玩什么呢
Precious, where are we going to play?

221
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,956
小孩儿  离开这儿
Girl, get the fuck out of here.

222
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:48,187
你不是该待在学校吗...
Aren't you suppose to be at school, so...

223
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,680
你说会跟我一块儿玩的
You said we are gonna play.

224
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,266
那可不是原先的计划
That's exactly not what we gonna plan.

225
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,059
我可没那么说过
I've never say nothing like that.

226
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,059
特丽莎宾馆

226
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,491
你既然没那个意思
You are saying some shit like that

227
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:58,898
干吗那么说
to me and you don't even mean it?

228
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:01,622
不  我可不是跟你玩
No, I'm not playing with you.

229
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:04,170
不是  如果她过来...你等等
No, if she comes...hold on.

230
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:06,962
一对一教学  请等一下
Each one teach one. Hold please.

231
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:09,595
是的  她打过电话去我家
Yes, she called my house.

232
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,574
我知道她不应该承担
I know it wasn't just as a traeger.

233
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,636
因为那不是她
Because it wasn't her.

234
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:19,388
这儿是干吗的
What this is here?

235
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,909
一对一教学
Each one teach one.

236
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:24,479
那选修学校在哪儿
What about the alternative school?

237
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:26,085
这就是选修的
This is an alternative.

238
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,018
选修学校是什么意思
What an alternative is?

239
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,784
你到底想问什么
What exactly are you asking me?

240
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,272
我以前学校的一名女士叫我来这儿的
The lady at my old school told me to come here.

241
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:34,769
特丽莎宾馆
Hotel Theresa.

242
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,616
这儿就是选修学校吗
This is alternative school?

243
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,242
选修学校
An alternative school

244
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:40,802
就好比是你的一个选择
is like a...is like a choice.

245
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,790
让你换种方式去做事
A different way of doing things.

246
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,538
我需要你的退学证明
So I need your discharge papers saying that they discharge you.

247
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,944
我怀孕了  所以被逐出了学校
I got kicked out of school because I was pregnant.

248
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,247
那你还是得出示退学文件
Well, I still need your discharge paper,

249
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:52,489
否则我们不能让你入学
otherwise we can't let you in.

250
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,598
桑德拉老师没说过啊
Mrs. Sondra didn't say all that.

251
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,619
你知道她打过电话来了?
You know what she called about?

252
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,207
你就是克拉丽丝·珍爱·琼斯?
Claireece P. Jones?

253
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:04,120
你的退学文件以及相关资料已经送来了
They already sent over all your discharge papers and stuff.

254
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,751
今天就都送来了吗
All the stuff today?

255
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:07,128
是的
Yupe.

256
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,537
你在接受家庭子女资助项目的资助吗
Are you currently receiving AFDC?

257
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,390
我和我女儿的资助款由我妈掌管
My mother gets AFDC for me and my daughter.

258
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:14,507
那你妈妈是你和你女儿的监护人
So your mother has the custody for you and your daughter,

259
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:15,903
她掌管着你们的财政  对吗
and you're on her budget?

260
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,016
那好  我需要你妈妈财政预算的复印件
Okay, well. I will need a copy of your mother's budget

261
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,764
你的电话费和日常生活账单的复印件
and a copy of your phone bill and your utility bill.

262
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,318
我们得对你进行一些测试
We gotta give you a few tests.

263
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,296
测试一下你的阅读和数学能力
Test your reading and your math level,

1
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,058
看看把你安排在哪个班合适
see where to place you.

2
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:28,885
等会儿  亲爱的
Hold on, baby.

3
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:30,602
一教一教学  请稍等
Each one teach one. Hold.

4
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,264
要想进入普通教育开发班
To enter to the GED classes,

5
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:36,026
你就得拿到8分以上
You gotta get a 8.0 or a better on the tab.

6
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,009
克拉丽丝·珍爱·琼斯

7
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:54,971
天空中有黑云...

8
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:04,990
C选项  快乐

9
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,922
因为我从来不会做这些测验
Cause it's always something wrong with these tests.

10
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:15,351
这些测验只会让我显得很没大脑
These tests playing a pitch of me with no brain.

11
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,439
这些让我和我妈妈都显得愚蠢
These tests played a pitch with me and my mother,

12
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,838
我全家人都缺钱
My whole family is less than dough.

13
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,652
我们只是大家想赶走的丑陋的黑胖子
Just ugly black grease to be wiped away.

14
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:25,508
只是用来找份工作的
Find a job for.

15
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,723
有时候我真希望自己死了
Sometimes I wished I was dead.

16
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,390
我真的觉得这样很好

00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:11,665
我怎么吃不放色拉料的猪脚
Like that, how am I supposed to eat pigs with no colour grains?

46
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:14,839
而且这猪脚上怎么还有那么多毛
And why on the fuck does that pig's feet has so much hair in it?

47
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,843
你给我吃了它
You eat it.

48
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,086
你来吃这狗屎
You come eat this shit.

49
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:20,058
我不饿
I'm not hungry though.

50
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:21,508
你就是饿了
Yes, you is.

51
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,835
珍爱  如果你不吃这些东西...
Precious, if you don't get this god damn plate...

52
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:31,802
你吃完以后再做吃的给我
Just fix mine when you get done.

53
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:34,032
既然你搞砸了  你就得吃完
Since you fuck it up, you will eat it up.

54
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,705
快点吃  珍爱
Hurry up and eat, Precious.

55
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:38,290
我也很饿啊
I'm fucking hungry too.

56
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:41,997
不要让它冷了  因为冷的
And don't let it get cold, cause cold

57
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:43,815
猪脚就像坨屎
leg pig's feet is as nasty as shit.

58
00:42:01,363 --> 00:42:03,020
你打算吃什么

59
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,534
我不饿

60
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:07,454
吃吧  吃吧

61
00:42:07,455 --> 00:42:09,902
妈妈

62
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:12,992
把你的肥臀放下  坐好

63
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,991
快点吃  要凉了

64
00:42:25,436 --> 00:42:29,246
或许你并不了解我...

65
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:32,018
吃你的吧  婊子

66
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:36,256
妈妈

67
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:55,798
和我说说你的家庭生活
So, tell me...tell me about your home life.

68
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:01,233
谈这个对我们都没有好处
It's nothing good for us to talk about.

69
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:04,606
你现在很安全  放心说吧
You're in a safe place, just talk.

70
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:06,323
你的家庭生活怎样
What's going on?

71
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:07,771
当你想到家时  脑海里浮现的
What's the first thing that came to your mind

72
00:44:07,772 --> 00:44:09,422
第一件事是什么
when you think about home?

73
00:44:09,972 --> 00:44:13,829
我希望在我的房间里有自己的电视
I wish I have my own TV so I can watch in my room.

74
00:44:14,356 --> 00:44:15,912
如果我有自己的电视
And if I have my own TV so I won't

75
00:44:15,913 --> 00:44:17,378
就不用和我妈妈一起看了
have to watch it with my mother.

76
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,242
你和你妈妈一起看电视是什么感觉
What is it like watching TV with your mother?

77
00:44:20,913 --> 00:44:23,019
你经常和你妈妈看电视吗
You usually watch TV with your mother?

78
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,283
我需要知道你的家庭生活
I need to know about your home life.

79
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:27,976
我需要知道你生活的地方是什么样的
I need to know what's it like where you live.

80
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:31,829
我妈就像一条坐在沙发上的鲸鱼
My mother is like a whale on the couch.

81
00:44:31,948 --> 00:44:33,595
她说我总是在吃
She said I eat all the time.

82
00:44:33,596 --> 00:44:35,439
可是她一直逼我吃
But she's always making me eat.

83
00:44:36,022 --> 00:44:38,021
而且她叫我"肥臀"
And she calls me a fat ass.

84
00:44:38,353 --> 00:44:40,548
她说因为我这是小问题
She says the problem is little because of me

85
00:44:41,537 --> 00:44:44,267
当她不得不出门时
And the time she have to leave

86
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,172
她总让我每天都呆坐在家里
Look at I can just sit in the house for every day.

87
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,870
但她错了
But she is wrong.

88
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,270
看电视  吃  看电视  吃
Watch TV, eat, watch TV, eat again.

89
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:55,630
从不会有任何帮助
Never help with that.

90
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,218
我们可以说点别的吗
Can we talk about something else?

91
00:45:06,422 --> 00:45:08,193
说说你的第一个孩子  可以吗
How about your first born?

92
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:09,558
傻子?
Mongo?

93
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:13,603
傻子?  这是...
Mongo? Is that…?

94
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:17,382
傻子是对先天愚型的简称
Mongo. The short for Mongoloid.

95
00:45:17,854 --> 00:45:22,215
你是这样叫她起的名字  还是...昵称呢
Is that what you call her? Or that...what is that? A nickname?

96
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:24,538
她有唐氏综合症
She got Down's syndrome.

97
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:34,135
过得怎么样啊  珍爱
How you are doing, Precious?

98
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:36,777
当社工来时  我奶奶会带
My grandmother will take Mongo over my house

99
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:38,749
傻子来我家
when the social workers come.

100
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,621
这样看起来像是她和我们住一起
So it looks like she live with us.

101
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,415
你他妈的傻啦
What are you fucking doing?

102
00:45:46,304 --> 00:45:47,867
瞧你做的好事
Look! See what you did!

103
00:45:48,086 --> 00:45:48,775
真该死
God damn it!

104
00:45:48,776 --> 00:45:51,994
这样我妈就能从我和傻子这儿拿到钱和食物
So that my Mom get the money and food for me and Mongo.

105
00:45:51,995 --> 00:45:53,017
谁啊
Who is it?

106
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,556
特纳女士

Why didn't you tell me that

109
00:45:59,185 --> 00:46:00,580
那婊子会来那么早啊
the bitch is coming so fucking early?

110
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:03,794
假发  快拿我的假发来

111
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:05,588
上来吧

113
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:30,024
放开我
Get off of me.

114
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:31,893
请对孩子友善点
Treat that child nice please.

115
00:46:31,894 --> 00:46:33,620
关你屁事啊

但你还是需要和别人谈起这事

194
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:55,747
如果你想得到支票  亲爱的

我也去见"吸血鬼"

他们晚上会打给我

他们会下到地面上
And then they go downstairs to the floor.

200
00:50:24,997 --> 00:50:26,381
那些需要我们供给的人

205
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:40,054
他们都没有家

这会很好
It's nice.

208
00:50:48,758 --> 00:50:52,875
那些医生就知道钱
Those the doctors look for money only.

209
00:50:56,264 --> 00:50:57,152
你都不知道我怎么

我妈猛踢我的屁股

你会把这些告诉我妈吗

在福利支票上
That's in the welfare cheques.

214
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:17,814
我真的没法撒谎

215
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,374
我该说我不是个演员
I should have said I'm not an act.

216
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:25,330
我妈会杀了我

217
00:51:39,482 --> 00:51:40,745
我们要做什么
What are we doing?

00:51:41,313 --> 00:51:42,993
我今天不和你一起

之前从未有人像这样牵过我的手

223
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:15,790
我不能说民主选举
I can't say the democratic nominations

224
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:19,207
美利坚合众国的主席是...

227
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,806
我仍然有个梦想

我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的...

235
00:52:57,644 --> 00:52:59,837
看这  这是胡扯  胡扯

童话的开头就该是那样的

她是砰一下生出宝宝了吗
Was she like pop the baby out...

66
00:57:15,023 --> 00:57:16,779
乔安  别恶心了
Jo Ann, don't be nasty!

67
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:18,854
那是什么感觉  你尖叫了吗

很疼的

69
00:57:19,994 --> 00:57:21,747
你这么坚强的女孩还叫?
Tough gal like you scream?

70
00:57:21,748 --> 00:57:23,686
宝宝出生的时候就没那么坚强了
Not so tough for the baby coming out of me.

71
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:24,348
是很疼的

00:57:25,163 --> 00:57:25,991
你结婚了吗

74
00:57:25,992 --> 00:57:27,324
-你结婚了吗  -闭嘴
- Are you married? - Shut up.

75
00:57:27,325 --> 00:57:28,550
你有女朋友吗
Do you get a girl friend?

10076
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:30,907
你有问题吗  他不喜欢你

77
00:57:30,908 --> 00:57:31,861
-你怎么知道的  -闭嘴吧
- How would you know? - Shut up.

10078
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:33,473
你怎么就不能消停个10分钟  别像个婊子
Why don't you stop being a whore for 10 minutes?

79
00:57:33,474 --> 00:57:34,680
这些人怎么回事
What's wrong with these people?

80
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:35,957
你不喜欢她的对吧
You don't want her, right?

10081
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:38,461
我希望我是那杯子里的哈密瓜
I wish I was that cantaloup  in that cup.

82
00:57:39,078 --> 00:57:40,407
那他就可以吃你了?
Oh...So that he can eat you?

83
00:57:40,912 --> 00:57:42,501
不行  我要走了

84
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:44,808
-我要走了  -可你还没吃完呢
- I gotta go. - But you haven't finish eating.

85
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:46,832
没关系  没关系
That's alright. That's alright.

86
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:52,653
我也能得到一个吻吗  约翰护士
Hey, can I get a kiss too, nurse John?

87
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:53,723

91
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:04,505
在树上歌唱
Singing in the tree.

10092
00:58:04,633 --> 00:58:08,295
乱搞进行中
F-u-c-k-i-n-g.

93
00:58:11,982 --> 00:58:13,860
他已经在这儿过夜了哦
He has spent a night over here.

94
00:58:16,863 --> 00:58:19,392
现在她准备把约翰护士写进她的本子了
Now she gonna write nurse John into her book.

95
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,080
亲爱的瑞恩小姐  我在课堂上这么多年
Dear Ms. Rain, all the years I sit in class,

96
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,183
从来没学到什么
I never learnt.

97
00:58:26,821 --> 00:58:29,697
可现在我又有了一个我父亲的孩子
But now I got a baby again by my father.

98
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,827
我希望我像其他女孩一样有个男朋友
I wish I had a boy friend like other girls.

99
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:35,815
那样我就能对退学有个合理解释了
Then I feel right that I have to quit school.

100
00:58:36,478 --> 00:58:40,090
我爱我的宝宝  可我也想上学
I love my baby but I wanna school too.

101
00:58:40,105 --> 00:58:42,525
社工问我愿不愿意把我的小傻子
Social worker asked if I wanna get my little Mongo

102
00:58:42,526 --> 00:58:44,444
给人领养
for an adoption.

103
00:58:44,878 --> 00:58:48,069
我都想杀了她  她从来就没帮上忙
I can kill her. She never helped before.

104
00:58:48,262 --> 00:58:50,336
现在她又想带走我的孩子
Now she wanna take my kids away.

105
00:58:50,937 --> 00:58:54,205
如果她带走阿卜杜勒  我就一无所有了
If she takes Abdul, I won't have nothing no more.

106
00:58:54,206 --> 00:58:55,607
亲爱的珍爱
Dear Precious,

107
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,640
我认为你的首要责任是照顾你自己
I think your first responsibility has to be to yourself.

108
00:58:59,641 --> 00:59:02,025
如果你任其发展  也许真会什么都没有
If you keep that doing, you might have nothing.

109
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,824
你学习阅读和写作  那就是一切
You learn to read and write, that's everything.

110
00:59:04,998 --> 00:59:07,373
你出院了就回学校来
You come back to school when you get out of the hospital.

111
00:59:07,782 --> 00:59:09,001
你才17岁
You are only 17.

112
00:59:09,002 --> 00:59:11,731
这真像个他妈的安全套
This is like a big ass condom.

113
00:59:13,302 --> 00:59:14,925
你当然知道了
You definite know.

10114
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:16,924
别这样
Not looking like that.

115
00:59:16,925 --> 00:59:18,188
你头发看起来一团糟
Your hair looks a mess.

10116
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:19,567
去死啦
I'm giving you a shit

117
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:20,814
闭嘴吧
Shut up.

118
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:22,340
我把你的日记本带来了
I got your journal.

119
00:59:22,463 --> 00:59:23,681
谢谢
Thank you.

120
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:30,383
怎么了

121
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:31,978
没什么
Nothing.

122
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:33,341
真的?
Are you sure?

123
00:59:33,894 --> 00:59:34,864
是的  真的
Yeah, I'm sure.

124
00:59:34,865 --> 00:59:37,770
好吧  我好无聊  我要走了
Alright. I'm bored and about to leave.

125
00:59:38,736 --> 00:59:39,909
再见
Bye.

126
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:42,695
再见  希拉夫人
Bye Mrs. Sheila.

127
00:59:43,423 --> 00:59:45,017
你有张讨厌的臭嘴

128
00:59:45,018 --> 00:59:47,094
你有顶讨厌的臭帽子
You got a nasty ass hat.

129
00:59:49,463 --> 00:59:51,817
你和这样的婊子混在一起是不对的
This was wrong in hanging out with bitches like that.

130
00:59:52,345 --> 00:59:53,615
这是你的宝宝
This is your baby.

10131
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:56,260
说不定你最后一次见他了
You probably last time you gotta see him.

132
00:59:56,649 --> 00:59:58,605
外婆来看我们
Grandma will come and visit us to

133
00:59:58,606 --> 01:00:00,561
只是想收养宝宝再走人
only adopt the baby and walk off.

134
01:00:00,778 --> 01:00:02,024
甚至都不算收养
Not even adopt.

10135
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:04,900
说的也是  都算不上收养
Say later, not even adopt.

136
01:00:05,098 --> 01:00:07,466
我为你自豪  你一点不像你妈
I'm proud of you. You ain't nothing like your mother.

137
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:10,678
当你爸爸侮辱你的时候  你外婆在哪儿
Where was your grandmother when your father was abusing you?

138
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:13,076
小傻子现在在哪儿

139
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,076
在这种状况下  什么才对你最好
What is going to be the best thing for you in this situation?

140
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:19,263
瑞恩小姐  你问了我这么多问题
Ms. Rain, you ask so many questions.

141
01:00:19,494 --> 01:00:21,461
有些时候  我都希望你能做个摘要
Sometimes I wish you check this out brief.

142
01:00:22,048 --> 01:00:23,671
我只是想当个好妈妈
I just wanna be a good mother.

143
01:00:25,415 --> 01:00:27,974
当个好妈妈说不定意味着让阿卜杜勒
Being a good mother might mean letting Abdul

144
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:30,677
被条件更好  更能满足他需要的人抚养

145
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:36,346

社会福利就帮了我妈妈

152
01:01:05,163 --> 01:01:06,189
你可以上大学

我能抱抱吗

161
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,065

166
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:46,220
把你的那些垃圾放下  给我弄点喝的
Put all the shit down and go get me something to drink.

167
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:07,063

我的社会福利被毁了

175
01:05:19,504 --> 01:05:21,997
就因为你那张天杀的笨嘴乱讲话

我也没抢你男人
I ain't take your man!

178
01:05:24,477 --> 01:05:25,811
是你男人强奸了我

179
01:05:25,812 --> 01:05:27,450
就你那破样  他强奸你...

婊子  别把你的脏手放我身上

10182
01:05:50,641 --> 01:05:52,955
不要  不要动她
No, leave that gal alone.

183
01:06:31,312 --> 01:06:32,690
我现在可以看你的宝宝了吗
Can I see your baby now?

184
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:05,272
购物时节

告诉我你在后面看到了什么
Tell me what you see back there.

10188
01:09:42,005 --> 01:09:43,772
我理解瑞恩小姐的表情
I could tell my Ms. Rain's face.

189
01:09:43,773 --> 01:09:45,671
我真的无家可归了
I am no homeless no more.

190
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,692
只是不知道我下场会如何
I just don't know where I end up thou.

191
01:09:48,693 --> 01:09:49,889
我会搞定

192
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,645
我觉得对不起她
I feel bad for her.

193
01:09:53,967 --> 01:09:55,972
她只是个教语言的老师
She's just a ABC teacher.

194
01:09:56,088 --> 01:09:57,793
也不是什么社工
She ain't no social worker.

195
01:09:59,353 --> 01:10:00,556
怎么回事
What's going on?

196
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:01,899
可她是唯一能帮我的人
But she's all I can think of.

197
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,527
听着  等其他孩子们到了
Look, when the other kids here,

198
01:10:03,528 --> 01:10:04,458
让她们先开始写作
tell them to start writing.

199
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:06,777
你们中年纪大的负责一下行吗
And which one of you is older is in charge okay?

200
01:10:06,778 --> 01:10:08,135
孔苏埃洛  我知道不是你  过来
Consuelo, I know it's not you. Come here.

201
01:10:08,136 --> 01:10:10,286
瑞恩小姐  我不能待在这儿  我跟你说过...
Ms. Rain, I can't stay. I told you...

202
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:11,931
孔苏埃洛  你不能不上课
Consuelo, you are not leaving class

203
01:10:11,932 --> 01:10:13,262
我现在也没法处理这个问题
and I'm not dealing with this now.

10204
01:10:13,263 --> 01:10:15,210
拿着钱  给珍爱买些衣服穿
Take this money, go get something for Precious to wear.

206
01:10:16,555 --> 01:10:18,131
把找的零钱带回来

一个刚出生3天的婴儿

我们会给你找到住处的

212

乔安  你迟到了
Jo Ann, you are late.

213
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,661
朗达  你又不是老师
Rhonda, you aren't the teacher.

214
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:41,237
乔安  瑞恩小姐今天在忙珍爱的事
Jo Ann, Ms. Rain is busy with Precious today.

215
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:43,473

乔安  你看看宝宝的包裹  有什么感想
Hey Jo Ann, you wanna say when you wrapped the baby.

219
01:10:50,171 --> 01:10:51,777
宝宝在这儿干吗
What's the baby doing here?

10220
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:53,317
乔安就是个包袱
Jo Ann is a wrappy.

221
01:10:53,539 --> 01:10:54,317
她很好的  她会帮你的

222
01:10:54,318 --> 01:10:59,537
为什么宝宝裹在一个沾着血的毯子里?
Why...why is the baby wrapped up in a blood covered blanket?

223
01:10:59,538 --> 01:11:01,092
乔安  有什么好笑的
Jo Ann, what's so funny?

224

告诉我  到底发生什么事了
Tell me, what's really happened?

225
01:11:02,473 --> 01:11:03,971
你不会想知道的 是...
You don't wanna know. It's...

226
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:05,189
你知道你有什么问题吗  乔安
You know what's your problem is, Jo Ann?

227
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:07,060
那就是你什么都不能认真对待
That is you can't take anything serious enough.

228
01:11:07,061 --> 01:11:08,590
杰梅因  我还以为你会好一点的
Jermaine, I expect better from you.

229
01:11:08,591 --> 01:11:09,395

拜托  告诉我发生什么事了

234
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:21,440
不  那不好玩
No, it's not funny.

235
01:11:21,441 --> 01:11:22,118
那宝宝...
The baby...

236
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:24,841
但是  乔安  宝宝流血一点都不好笑
But Jo Ann, it's not funny about a baby with blood on it.

237
01:11:24,842 --> 01:11:26,584
我有个西部朋友是议会成员

238
01:11:26,585 --> 01:11:28,809
我看看她能不能帮上忙  等一下

01:11:40,059 --> 01:11:42,437
我还想昨天拿到这个的

244
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:43,848
一张狗屎
Piece of shit.

245
01:11:45,071 --> 01:11:45,977
对不起
I'm sorry.

246
01:11:45,978 --> 01:11:47,406
我要回我办公桌去  能否请你等一等
I'm going back to my desk. Can you please hold?

247

你是出什么问题了  珍爱
Something's wrong with you, Precious.

248
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:52,094
这个宝宝真臭

249
01:11:52,194 --> 01:11:53,481
可是我们没有纸尿裤

01:11:57,387 --> 01:11:58,578
首先...
The first thing...

254
01:11:58,579 --> 01:11:59,454
没事
It's alright.

01:12:07,132 --> 01:12:08,617
你为什么让朗达负责这个班

不过在找到住处之前

拜托  我一直都...
Oh, come on. I always...

50
01:13:59,143 --> 01:13:59,966
你该知道自己有多不稳当
You know how you are,

51
01:13:59,966 --> 01:14:02,275
装饰圣诞树你挂的东西一半都会掉下来
so you only put up the tree and drop half off the top...

52
01:14:02,276 --> 01:14:04,201

57
01:14:14,157 --> 01:14:15,506
为什么这些素昧平生的人
Why people barely know me

58
01:14:15,507 --> 01:14:18,241
对我比我自己的爸妈还好

我感觉很温暖

-相安无事  -那就好
- They're fine. - Okay.

64

外婆害怕妈妈

65
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,501
所以她不敢让我去跟她住
I know that is why she ain't let me stay with her.

66
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:33,645
如果是罗纳德·麦当劳来经营...
If Ronald MacDonald is running things...

67
01:14:33,646 --> 01:14:35,953
瑞恩小姐说  什么都别怕
Ms. Rain say don't be afraid of nothing.

68
01:14:36,248 --> 01:14:37,161
...汉堡包的价格...
...the price of hamburgers...

69
01:14:37,162 --> 01:14:39,189
她一定不怕妈妈
I bet she ain't scared of Mama.

70
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:42,461
你不觉得这有点可疑吗
Wouldn't you be a little bit of suspicious?

71
01:14:42,462 --> 01:14:43,726
你写本书吧

72
01:14:43,727 --> 01:14:44,887
写了有谁看呢
Well, who's gonna read it?

73
01:14:44,888 --> 01:14:46,628
你不写当然没人看

74
01:14:47,145 --> 01:14:49,060
知道吗  珍爱每天都在写

75
01:14:49,061 --> 01:14:50,333
你也该试试
You should try it.

76
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:51,881
是吗
Is that right?

77
01:14:52,623 --> 01:14:54,485
你写些什么  珍爱
What did you write about, Precious?

78
01:14:54,637 --> 01:14:55,764

还有阿卜杜勒...
Abdul...

81
01:15:01,896 --> 01:15:04,039
你们怎么都不爱吃麦当劳
How come you all don't like McDonald?

82
01:15:04,112 --> 01:15:06,188
凯瑟琳只是在使用比喻
Katherine is just trying comparison,

83
01:15:06,189 --> 01:15:08,845
这样她的想法就更容易听懂些
so that her point could be more easily understood.

84
01:15:08,845 --> 01:15:09,349
没错
Yes

85
01:15:09,394 --> 01:15:11,869
她们的交谈就好像电视里看到的一样
They talked like tv channels on a watch.

87
01:15:12,766 --> 01:15:13,496
天哪...
Oh my...

88
01:15:13,497 --> 01:15:15,846
我很高兴阿卜杜勒能在这儿听她们说话
I'm glad Abdul is here listening to them now

89
01:15:15,847 --> 01:15:17,436
因为我知道她们都是聪明人
'Cause I know they are smart.

90
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,421
他以前烟抽得很凶  像个烟囱
He used to smoke like a chimney.

91
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:21,356
而且嗜酒如命
And drink like a fish.

92
01:15:21,357 --> 01:15:23,312
她们说的我一句都听不懂
I don't understand a word they are saying.

93
01:15:23,408 --> 01:15:24,565
知道吗
Do you understand?

94
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:29,872
你们看奥普拉的脱口秀吗
You all have been watching Oprah?

95
01:15:29,873 --> 01:15:31,264
我不怎么看
No. I don't actually.

96
01:15:31,265 --> 01:15:33,001
你知道我下班回到家都几点了吗
You know what time I get back home from work?

97
01:15:33,002 --> 01:15:33,596
我有看
I watched it.

98
01:15:33,597 --> 01:15:35,278
妈妈说同性恋没有好人
Mama said the homo are bad people.

99
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:36,824
...她应该在写的...
...when she should be writing....

100
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:39,318
可是妈妈  同性恋可没有强奸我
But Mama, homos are not the ones who raped me

101
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:40,953
而你呢
And what do that make you?

102
01:15:41,896 --> 01:15:43,522
同性恋可没有在课堂里
Homos are not the ones who let me sit in class

103
01:15:43,522 --> 01:15:45,532
因为我没学过什么而取笑我
and are amused that I never learned that thing.

104
01:15:45,914 --> 01:15:47,506
同性恋也没有像那些家伙
The homos are not the one who sell

105
01:15:47,507 --> 01:15:49,053
在哈姆莱贩卖毒品
crack to those peoples in Harlem.

106
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:50,937
告诉她
Tell her.

107
01:15:50,938 --> 01:15:53,047
对此奥普拉会作何评论呢
What do Oprah got to say about that?

108
01:15:53,737 --> 01:15:56,074
瑞恩小姐是那个将粉笔放入我手中
Ms. Rain is the one who put chalk in my hand,

109
01:15:56,145 --> 01:15:58,342
让我感到学习乐趣的人
make me queen with my ABCs.

110
01:16:01,511 --> 01:16:03,519
搬进"中途之家"后
After I settle in the half-way house,

111
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,006
我学习非常用功
I work my hardest as if my alert sounds.

112
01:16:06,007 --> 01:16:09,106
写日记  阅读各种书籍
Write in journal and read small and fat books.

113
01:16:09,137 --> 01:16:12,469
市长办公室还因为我取得的进步
Then I found out Mayor's Office gave me a literacy award

114
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,219
给我颁了一个识字奖  还有奖金
and a cheque for the progress.

115
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,610
1  2  3
One, two, three.

116
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:20,254
我们开了个庆祝派对
The party is on.

117
01:16:25,311 --> 01:16:26,515
让我们看看你得到的是什么
Let's see what you got.

118
01:16:27,343 --> 01:16:28,613
所有人都来了
Everybody come.

119
01:16:28,893 --> 01:16:32,951
约翰护士  康若斯...还有全体教职员
Nurse John, Cornrows...all the staff office.

120
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:34,762
连凯瑟琳小姐都来了
Even Ms. Katherine showed up.

121
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:36,827
珍爱
Precious.

122
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:38,822
我们是不是该拿过去...
Shall we bring it over...

123
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:41,066
什么事
What's up?

124
01:16:42,213 --> 01:16:43,062
这是什么
What's that?

125
01:16:44,206 --> 01:16:45,292
看上去像什么
What'd it look like?

126
01:16:45,928 --> 01:16:47,602
一个塑料烂苹果
Plastic stupid apple.

127
01:16:51,042 --> 01:16:52,294
这是我的一点小礼物
A little something for you.

128
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:53,658
里面是钱吗
Is there more money in it?

129
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:55,026
你怎么这么贪心啊
Why are you so greedy?

130
01:16:55,559 --> 01:16:58,076
那边那人是谁
Yo, uhm...who's that?

131
01:17:01,349 --> 01:17:02,107
怎么了
What?

132
01:17:05,374 --> 01:17:06,190
什么意思
What?

133
01:17:06,809 --> 01:17:07,691
跟我来
Come on.

134
01:17:07,806 --> 01:17:10,268
珍爱  你带我去哪儿
Precious, where are you taking me?

135
01:17:11,787 --> 01:17:13,268
那我该怎么做  美女
What am I supposed to do, diva?

136
01:17:13,382 --> 01:17:14,427
是的  是女子的
Yeah, women.

137
01:17:14,428 --> 01:17:15,470
稍等一下
Hold on, girl.

138
01:17:15,613 --> 01:17:16,506
什么事  珍爱...
Yeah, Prec...

139
01:17:21,289 --> 01:17:23,035
我妈妈昨天给我打电话了
My Mom called last night.

140
01:17:26,073 --> 01:17:29,481
其实我们之间没什么来往
And uh...We don't really have a relationship.

141
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:32,627
我们互不讲话  她确实有她的问题
We don't talk. She really has her problem.

142
01:17:32,628 --> 01:17:35,818
有些人藏了很多秘密  说出来能吓别人一跳
Some folks got a lot around when they shock other peoples.

143
01:17:36,511 --> 01:17:39,149
我想  一些人就好像是在隧道里
I think maybe some of them was in tunnels.

144
01:17:39,641 --> 01:17:40,633
在隧道里
And in that tunnel,

145
01:17:40,855 --> 01:17:43,743
也许唯一一丝光亮只存于他们心里
maybe the only light they have was inside them.

146
01:17:44,103 --> 01:17:46,590
我想  你得多坚强才行啊
I thought about how strong you had to be.

147
01:17:50,076 --> 01:17:53,735
于是  即便在他们走出隧道后很久
And then, even long after they escape that tunnel.

148
01:17:55,051 --> 01:17:56,561
我来打扫吧
I will do the clean up.

149
01:17:57,276 --> 01:17:58,251
好
Okay.

150
01:17:58,601 --> 01:18:01,523
他们内心仍会与世人隔绝
They still shut off everybody else.

151
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:07,417
瑞恩小姐和我就是这样的
That's Ms. Rain and me.

152
01:18:12,329 --> 01:18:13,651
我在书中写道
In the book I wrote,

153
01:18:13,683 --> 01:18:15,952
那位女士跑出来搬入了"中途之家"
This lady escape to a half-way house.

154
01:18:16,064 --> 01:18:17,251
当她来到这里
And when she was there,

155
01:18:17,252 --> 01:18:19,431
她问什么是"中途之家"
she asks people there what a half-way house was.

156
01:18:19,453 --> 01:18:21,178
那里的人告诉她
And they told her,

157
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:23,075
因为这正是她告别过去的生活
It was a half way between her old life

158
01:18:23,075 --> 01:18:24,517
通往她想要的新生活的途中
and where she wanna be.

159
01:18:24,773 --> 01:18:25,990
这听起来不错
That sounds nice.

160
01:18:28,501 --> 01:18:30,828
但也意味着我不能永远待在这儿
That also mean that I can't stay here forever.

161
01:18:31,579 --> 01:18:33,016
总是要离开的
There's still a way to go.

162
01:18:34,462 --> 01:18:36,552
也许有一天我会拥有自己的公寓
Maybe someday I'll get my own apartment.

163
01:18:38,305 --> 01:18:40,836
阿卜杜勒9个月大了  都快能走了
Abdul is 9 months and almost walking.

164
01:18:40,943 --> 01:18:42,251
他也很聪明
He's smart too.

165
01:18:42,378 --> 01:18:44,835
从他一出生起我就念东西给他听
I've been reading to him since the day he was born.

166
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:47,829
他还不太会说话  但已经能数数了
He's barely talking, but he's already counting.

167
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,460
妈妈  爸爸
Mama, Daddy,

168
01:18:52,178 --> 01:18:57,006
我似乎忘却了所有的不快
I ask seems like all bad dreams.

169
01:18:58,841 --> 01:19:01,022
我希望能在这儿重新开始
I wish it could just start out here.

170
01:19:01,219 --> 01:19:02,759
我还有阿卜杜勒
I still have Abdul.

171
01:19:04,178 --> 01:19:05,828
我还要把傻子也接来
I'm gonna get Mongo too.

172
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:08,783
我必须把傻子接来
I gotta get Mongo back.

173
01:19:10,423 --> 01:19:11,598
你好  道奇女士
Hey. Ms. Dodgy

174
01:19:11,599 --> 01:19:13,733
你好  珍爱  楼下有人找
Hey Precious, somebody downstairs for you.

175
01:19:13,734 --> 01:19:15,674
-是谁  -我没问她叫什么
- Who is it? - I didn't ask her who she was.

176
01:19:15,675 --> 01:19:17,040
需要我帮你看着孩子吗
Want me to watch the baby for you?

177
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:19,666
不用  反正我要下去接他
Nuh. I gotta go down to get him anyway.

178
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:55,575
你爸爸死了
Your Daddy's dead.

179
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,000
就这事吗
That's all.

180
01:20:04,454 --> 01:20:06,361
他感染了艾滋病
He had AIDS virus.

181
01:20:21,926 --> 01:20:23,300
女士  又来到梦想世界了
Lady, go dream again.

183
01:20:27,429 --> 01:20:28,662
你听见我说什么了吗
Did you hear what I said?

184
01:20:33,294 --> 01:20:34,518
你有吗
You got it?

185
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:37,158
有什么
Got what?

186
01:20:37,716 --> 01:20:39,925
-艾滋病  -没有
- The AIDS virus. - No.

187
01:20:40,551 --> 01:20:41,676
你怎么知道
How'd you know?

188
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:44,828
我们从不肛交  所以不会有
We never did it up in the ass so I know.

189
01:20:49,695 --> 01:20:51,564
妈妈  你最好去看下医生
You better get to a doctor, Ma.

190
01:20:54,879 --> 01:20:56,147
你回家吗
You coming home?

191
01:21:13,593 --> 01:21:14,815
珍爱
Yo, Precious.

192
01:21:33,715 --> 01:21:34,532
丽塔
Rita.

193
01:21:35,114 --> 01:21:37,508
当作者用"无休止地"来形容某种境遇时
What do I mean when I say the author describes

194
01:21:37,509 --> 01:21:42,007
这是什么意思呢
her botaganist circumstances as unrelenting

195
01:21:42,433 --> 01:21:44,460
我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

196
01:21:47,055 --> 01:21:49,465
这就是说...就好比说丽塔吧
It's like saying if uh...like if Rita.

197
01:21:49,466 --> 01:21:50,808
她想要做什么事
She is trying to do something,

198
01:21:50,809 --> 01:21:52,262
她一直做  一直做
And she'll go on, go on,

199
01:21:52,263 --> 01:21:54,171
我想阻止她  可她就是不停下来
And when I try to stop her, she ain't stop.

200
01:21:54,172 --> 01:21:55,576
她就这样一直做一直做
She just keep on and go on.

201
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:58,653
大概就这意思  一直
Well, at least, on.

202
01:22:51,277 --> 01:22:53,829
晚上见
I'll see you tonight. Bye.

203
01:23:40,385 --> 01:23:41,576
[为什么是我]

204
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:43,714
跟我来一下
Come with me.

205
01:23:45,766 --> 01:23:46,954
珍爱?
Precious?

206
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:50,112
你听到没有
Excuse me.

207
01:23:52,267 --> 01:23:54,658
他们说我HIV呈阳性
They say I'm HIV positive.

208
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:03,130
我今天没什么可写的
I have nothing to write today.

209
01:24:05,318 --> 01:24:07,009
你的宝宝还好吗
Is your baby okay?

210
01:24:08,045 --> 01:24:09,206
是的  我...
Yeah. I...

211
01:24:09,507 --> 01:24:11,671
我准备停止喂他母乳了
I'm gonna stop breast feeding him.

212
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:16,757
我记得你曾告诉过我
I remember you once told me

213
01:24:17,776 --> 01:24:20,113
你永远都不会讲你的事
you never really got to tell your story,

214
01:24:22,354 --> 01:24:23,226
对吗
Right?

215
01:24:23,227 --> 01:24:24,420
去你妈的
Fuck you!

216
01:24:24,676 --> 01:24:26,857
你根本不了解我承受了什么
You know nothing what I've been thru.

217
01:24:28,818 --> 01:24:31,159
我从来没有男朋友
I never had no boy friend.

218
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,558
我爸爸说他会娶我
My Dad says he's going to marry me.

219
01:24:37,241 --> 01:24:40,229
我后来才知道那是乱伦
I got to know that fucking would be illegal.

220
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:57,817
写下来
Write.

221
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:02,886
我活得好累  瑞恩小姐
I'm tired. Ms. Rain.

222
01:25:03,529 --> 01:25:06,747
你不是为了你自己  是为了爱你的人
You are not for yourself, and for the people who love you.

223
01:25:06,748 --> 01:25:08,453
没有人爱我
Nobody love me.

224
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:10,680
当然有人爱你  珍爱
People do love you, Precious.

225
01:25:11,298 --> 01:25:14,010
别骗我了  瑞恩小姐
Please don't lie to me, Ms. Rain.

226
01:25:14,618 --> 01:25:16,736
爱没有给我任何好处
Love ain't done nothing for me.

227
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:21,647
爱只会让我挨打  害我被强暴
Love beat me, rape me,

228
01:25:22,886 --> 01:25:24,576
把我叫做畜生
call me an animal,

229
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:27,017
让我觉得自己毫无价值
make me feel worthless,

230
01:25:27,568 --> 01:25:29,372
让我感到恶心
make me sick.

231
01:25:31,397 --> 01:25:33,449
那不是爱  珍爱
That wasn't love, Precious.

232
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:37,352
你的孩子爱你
Your baby loves you.

233
01:25:40,715 --> 01:25:42,175
我也爱你
I love you.

234
01:25:49,536 --> 01:25:50,695
写吧
Write.

235
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,976
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

236
01:26:03,911 --> 01:26:08,414
你从没告诉过我  你和你妈妈的关系如何
You never told me about your relationship with your mother.

237
01:26:10,713 --> 01:26:12,311
我是没说过
I didn't, did I?

238
01:26:13,174 --> 01:26:15,091
真的  我是来帮你的
Really, I'm here to help you.

239
01:26:15,886 --> 01:26:17,033
你可以跟我讲
You could talk to me.

240
01:26:17,034 --> 01:26:18,773
这里说话很安全
This is a safe environment.

241
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:21,743
你说得对
You are right.

242
01:26:21,768 --> 01:26:24,199
或者你谈谈你爸爸也行
You could talk about your Daddy, instead.

243
01:26:24,447 --> 01:26:28,470
我们可以谈我妈我爸我姨
We can talk about my mother, my father, my aunt,

244
01:26:28,471 --> 01:26:29,942
或者我兄弟姐妹
or my sister, my brother.

245
01:26:29,943 --> 01:26:32,071
但这不会对你有任何帮助
But none of it is gonna help you.

246
01:26:32,434 --> 01:26:33,982
你根本不喜欢我
You don't even like me.

247
01:26:33,983 --> 01:26:38,675
我们差不多有一年没坐在一起
Have we not been in this room together for like a year,

248
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:40,452
讨论你的生活了吧
discussing your life?

249
01:26:40,453 --> 01:26:43,489
我讲了我的生活  我们就能喜欢对方吗
Is that mean we like each other cause I discuss my life?

250
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:45,060
我没法替你讲
I can't speak for you,

251
01:26:45,061 --> 01:26:46,948
我说话只能代表自己
I can always speak for me.

252
01:26:47,391 --> 01:26:50,001
我挺喜欢你的  真的
And I do like you. I do.

253
01:26:50,103 --> 01:26:51,593
如果你贴着标签
So if you're a tag, you know,

254
01:26:51,594 --> 01:26:53,500
标签上写着你是什么颜色呢
What--what colour are you in...

255
01:26:53,501 --> 01:26:55,642
你是黑人吗  还是西班牙人的
Are you some type of black, or Spanish?

256
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,892
你觉得我是什么颜色的呢
What colour do you think I am?

257
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:02,413
那我们就说说看  你觉得我是什么颜色
Now let's know what colour do you think I am?

258
01:27:04,063 --> 01:27:05,760
我嗓子很干
My throat is dry.

259
01:27:06,689 --> 01:27:08,349
嗓子很干?
Your throat is dry?

260
01:27:08,711 --> 01:27:10,205
这里太热了
It's really hot in here.

261
01:27:10,488 --> 01:27:12,276
是有点热
It is kinda hot in here.

262
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,406
我去拿点汽水
I'm gonna get a soda.

263
01:27:14,407 --> 01:27:15,711
你喝什么
What do you want?

264
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,269
就汽水吧
Soda sounds fine.

265
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:19,289
好的
Alright.

266
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:51,290
谢谢
Thank you.

267
01:27:52,326 --> 01:27:53,416
不客气
No problem.

268
01:27:57,487 --> 01:28:00,901
我必须和你谈谈你妈妈
So, I have to talk to you about your mother.

269
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,328
不知道你会有什么感受
And I don't know how you're gonna feel about this.

1
01:28:03,329 --> 01:28:06,370
可是  她说她想见你
But, uhm...she says she wants to see you

2
01:28:06,473 --> 01:28:11,263
她希望跟你以及你的孩子重组家庭
and she wants to be reunited with you and her grandchildren.

3
01:28:11,651 --> 01:28:14,622
她想来这里与你谈一谈
She wanna come in here and have a session with you.

4
01:28:14,772 --> 01:28:16,054
你怎么跟她说的
What did you tell her?

5
01:28:16,408 --> 01:28:18,608
我说我得先问问你
I said I'd just speak to you about it.

6
01:28:21,955 --> 01:28:23,172
你看怎么办
It's up to you.

7
01:28:23,454 --> 01:28:25,653
我不知道  我之前从来没有想过这个
I don't know I never thought about it before.

8

魏斯女士说她知道我感染了HIV
Ms. Weiss said she's found I got an HIV.

9
01:28:30,523 --> 01:28:32,589
她想领养孩子

10
01:28:33,082 --> 01:28:34,773
我不担心那个
I ain't worry about that.

11
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:39,245
我只担心怎么抚养起我的孩子们

12
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:43,288
我正在写个计划

我想开个诊所
I wanna open up this clinic,

14
01:28:45,436 --> 01:28:49,106
可以接待那些母亲以及她们的孩子

15
01:28:49,522 --> 01:28:52,272
就像病友之家
You know, just these sicks' home like that.

16
01:28:52,273 --> 01:28:55,235
我一直想做这个来着
I have always wanted to do that.

17
01:28:55,252 --> 01:28:56,379
为社会做这个
Give those to the community.

18
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:59,213
因为我知道我妈妈会为此骄傲

19
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:00,778

22
01:29:07,414 --> 01:29:09,871
-怎么样  -真不错
- So...what about it? - It's so nice.

23
01:29:12,944 --> 01:29:16,087
我不想把这些全读出来
Well, I aim't gonna read all the whole thing.

24
01:29:16,088 --> 01:29:18,147
我就说一下大体意思
I just wanna say what it's about.

25
01:29:19,749 --> 01:29:23,377
顾问来过我家了
Okay, the councellors have in some house.

26
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:27,708
不是因为我父母
It's not because my mother and father, right?

27
01:29:27,809 --> 01:29:29,397
与他们无关
It's not really about them.

28
01:29:29,634 --> 01:29:31,657
他们想让我填个人的工作空缺
They try to get me into a work fill.

29
01:29:31,828 --> 01:29:33,513
他们想让我去给一家人当保姆
They want me to be a home's tending

30
01:29:33,514 --> 01:29:36,679

- How did you know? - Cause I stole my file and I read it.

31
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,681
他们只想让我工作
All they want me to do is work.

32
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,324
我确实想工作
And I do wanna work.

33
01:29:40,337 --> 01:29:42,058
只不过不想为一份救济款工作
Well,but not for a welfare cheque.

34
01:29:42,059 --> 01:29:43,452
这种评估有什么用呢
What kinda assess that mean?

35
01:29:43,453 --> 01:29:45,041
是让像珍爱这样的人
For somebody like Precious to quit school

36
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:46,403
在完成GED之前退学
before she got her GED

37
01:29:46,404 --> 01:29:49,032
去伺侯某个老白人吗
and go work for some old white people's home anywhere?

38
01:29:49,033 --> 01:29:50,610
她只要还没有摆脱现在的处境
She ain't going to be nothing if

39
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:52,335
就肯定一事无成
she's stuck in some shit like that.

40
01:29:52,336 --> 01:29:53,893
她为什么要请保姆呢
Why did she use her home tending.

41
01:29:53,894 --> 01:29:56,391
她就是要当这么个大婊子
She's in all the way to be a brillian bitch.

42
01:29:57,402 --> 01:30:00,574
好吧  不用整日整夜工作
Okay, rather than working all day and night.

43
01:30:00,575 --> 01:30:02,396
她轮班  对吧
She gotta call, right?

44
01:30:02,936 --> 01:30:05,906
她每小时挣6.37块钱
She makes 6.37 an hour.

45
01:30:05,907 --> 01:30:07,591
但只按8小时付
But only for 8 hours.

46
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:10,474
也就是50.96块钱
That equals to 50 dollars and 96 cents.

47
01:30:10,903 --> 01:30:12,346
但这钱并不多
But that's not a lot of money.

48
01:30:12,347 --> 01:30:15,546
尤其是实际上她要24小时待命
Especially because for real she gotta have 24 hours.

49
01:30:15,547 --> 01:30:20,281
所以  50.96除以24
So, 50.96 divided by 24

50
01:30:20,282 --> 01:30:22,895
一小时挣2元12分
is 2 dollars and 12 cents an hour.

51
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:24,313
这可不算很多钱
That's not a lot of money.

52
01:30:24,314 --> 01:30:26,297
她是个老摇铃老三八
She is that old bitch who rings a bell.

53
01:30:26,298 --> 01:30:28,836
真正的午夜凶铃
A real night action bell.

54
01:30:28,837 --> 01:30:30,638
半夜三更的她想从她那里得到什么呢
What does she want something from her in the middle of the night?

55
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:31,413
你不会想做这个的  珍爱
You doesn't want to do that, Precious.

56
01:30:31,414 --> 01:30:32,657
是吧  朗达
Rhonda, Is that true?

57
01:30:32,748 --> 01:30:33,540
朗达
Rhonda!

58
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:36,524
家庭护理员一周工作6天
If my home tend works me 6 days a week.

59
01:30:36,675 --> 01:30:38,732
我只能星期天看阿卜杜勒
I only see Abdul on Sunday.

60
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:40,895
还有什么吗
What is exactly left?

61
01:30:40,896 --> 01:30:43,572
这可不行  你不能退学
Well, that's not an option. You are not leaving class.

62
01:30:44,323 --> 01:30:46,777
这跟我父亲"强健"我的时候差不多
But that's almost going on insects involving me as

63
01:30:46,778 --> 01:30:47,524
不
No.

64
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,929
强奸
Incest.

65
01:30:50,681 --> 01:30:51,624
我就是说的这个
That is what I said.

66
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:53,267
不  你说的是"强健"
No. You say insects.

67
01:30:54,452 --> 01:30:55,636
有什么区别啊
What's the difference?

68
01:30:55,787 --> 01:30:57,593
一个是你家人猥亵你
Well, one is your family molest you,

69
01:30:57,594 --> 01:31:00,464
另一个就像是...小强
The other is a...like a roach or bugs.

70
01:31:03,193 --> 01:31:04,214
你是科学家吗
So, you are the scientist now?

71
01:31:04,215 --> 01:31:05,754
我只是说一下
I'm just saying to you...

72
01:31:05,823 --> 01:31:06,991
不要紧
No, that's cool.

73
01:31:07,006 --> 01:31:08,388
谢谢你  谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

74
01:31:14,768 --> 01:31:17,893
很难跟其他人提起我父亲做了些什么
It was hard to tell strangers what my father did.

75
01:31:18,398 --> 01:31:19,957
这样也好
Sometimes feels good.

76
01:31:25,682 --> 01:31:27,492
上周  瑞恩小姐让我们写下
Last week, Ms. Rain asked us to write

77
01:31:27,493 --> 01:31:28,961
我们希望自己是什么样子

我写道我希望自己苗条
And I wrote that I'll be really skinny

79
01:31:34,596 --> 01:31:37,282
容光焕发  长发飘飘
with light skin and long hair.

80
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,047

上去
Go on back there.

82
01:31:42,281 --> 01:31:44,257
瑞恩小姐说我现在这样就很美
And Ms. Rain said I'm beautiful like I am.

83
01:31:44,258 --> 01:31:46,603
可这个计划里没小孩福利
There is no kids welfare in this plan.

84
01:31:49,932 --> 01:31:51,697
那你就闭嘴  坐在这里等我
Then shut up and sit down there.

85
01:31:52,129 --> 01:31:54,580
我得去跟那女的谈谈  别把我给挤掉了
I'll talk to that lady before my shit get cut off.

86
01:31:55,465 --> 01:31:56,570
但不知为什么
But somehow,

87
01:31:58,016 --> 01:31:59,045
就是现在
Right now,

88
01:32:00,007 --> 01:32:01,441
我不知道为什么
I don't know why but

01:32:03,388 --> 01:32:04,766
但我想她是对的
I think she's right.

90
01:32:11,541 --> 01:32:12,542
给你
Here.

克拉丽丝·琼斯

01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:30,283
我想她是对的
I think she's right.

01:32:36,263 --> 01:32:37,341
约翰逊太太
Okay, Mrs. Johnson,

94
01:32:37,342 --> 01:32:38,321
我们谈一下家里的问题
let's talk about the abuse.

95
01:32:38,322 --> 01:32:40,248
我家里没有毒品
There was no drugs in my house.

我屋里没有毒品

01:32:42,536 --> 01:32:44,332
珍爱知道的  她要是带

99
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:46,065
毒品回家我会抽她

100
01:32:46,066 --> 01:32:47,724
你知道我在说什么

101
01:32:49,513 --> 01:32:52,807
我指的是对珍爱身体的

102
01:32:55,261 --> 01:32:57,566
性侵犯行为
Involving Precious.

103
01:32:57,751 --> 01:32:59,094
你说这个
Wow, you are saying that?

104
01:33:04,106 --> 01:33:05,976
你想知道什么
What...what'd you wanna know?

105
01:33:05,977 --> 01:33:08,120
根据珍爱的档案
According to Precious's files,

106
01:33:08,121 --> 01:33:12,240
她现在有两个孩子  都是你男朋友

107
01:33:12,241 --> 01:33:15,594
卡尔·肯特乌的

108
01:33:15,595 --> 01:33:17,061
他也是她的父亲
who also her father.

109
01:33:22,893 --> 01:33:23,510
是的
Yeah.

110

114
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,952
说你想与珍爱

115
01:33:34,953 --> 01:33:36,612
及你的外孙重组家庭
and your grandchild.

116
01:33:36,613 --> 01:33:40,285
我需要知道你们家里曾经发生过什么
Now I really need to know what's going on in that home.

117
01:33:40,286 --> 01:33:42,293
魏斯女士  我了解你为什么要讨论这个
Ms. Weiss, I understand why you discuss it.

118
01:33:42,294 --> 01:33:43,997
但我得告诉你
But I'm just telling you,

119
01:33:43,998 --> 01:33:45,509
你说我打电话过来
you said I've been calling here

120
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:48,277
我想看珍爱和我的外孙
and I've been wanting to see Precious and my grandson.

121
01:33:48,278 --> 01:33:49,820
确实如此  我想看他们
You are god damn right I wanna see 'em

122
01:33:49,821 --> 01:33:52,804
因为他们属于我  对吧
Because they belong to me, okay?

123
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:54,028
有一段时间
Now there was a time

124
01:33:54,029 --> 01:33:55,935
珍爱霸占了一切
Precious had everything

125
01:33:55,936 --> 01:33:57,474
而我容忍了这个
And I'd tolerate that.

126
01:33:57,804 --> 01:34:00,368
我与卡尔  我们爱珍爱
And me and Carl, we love Precious.

127
01:34:00,496 --> 01:34:01,600
你得知道这个
And you need to know that.

128
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:04,380
我们爱珍爱  我们有憧憬
We love Precious and we had dreams.

129
01:34:04,418 --> 01:34:07,146
珍爱大约是在
Precious was born around the same time,

130
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:09,517
桑女士遇害的时候出生的
Mrs. Son got killed.

131
01:34:10,614 --> 01:34:11,728
夏天的时候
The summer time.

132
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:14,751
她夏天出生...
She was born...the summer time.

133
01:34:14,752 --> 01:34:16,293
记得...记得这个吗
Remember...remember that?

134
01:34:16,939 --> 01:34:18,750
我11月出生的
I was born in November.

135
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:22,792
11月  对
November. Yeah.

136
01:34:23,609 --> 01:34:24,829
是的
That's right.

137
01:34:25,597 --> 01:34:27,273
我的学校手册
My school bill jam.

138
01:34:29,599 --> 01:34:33,418
你也知道的  学校手册...
You know, school bill, they can...

139
01:34:34,767 --> 01:34:36,141
他们可能耍花招的
They can be tricky.

140
01:34:36,993 --> 01:34:39,968
我不是说...我不是说他们撒谎
And I'm not saying...I'm not saying that they lie.

141
01:34:40,598 --> 01:34:42,019
我不是这个意思
I'm not saying that.

142
01:34:42,156 --> 01:34:43,997
但你得小心检查一下
But you just gotta watch.

143
01:34:48,009 --> 01:34:52,251
我们...我们能谈一下
Can we...can we talk about the actual acts

144
01:34:52,388 --> 01:34:55,035
发生在你家里的
of physical and sexual abuses

145
01:34:55,036 --> 01:34:57,838
性侵犯事件吗
that incurred in your household?

146
01:34:58,146 --> 01:34:59,752
它什么时候开始的
When it first began?

147
01:34:59,753 --> 01:35:02,843
在哪里发生  你怎么反应的
Where it happened and how did you respond?

148
01:35:09,137 --> 01:35:11,101
珍爱还是个小姑娘的时候
Precious was a little girl.

149
01:35:12,769 --> 01:35:15,680
仔细回想一下你认为她当时多大
Try and remember how old you think she was.

150
01:35:20,082 --> 01:35:21,516
3岁
She was 3.

151
01:35:26,216 --> 01:35:29,983
那时候她在用奶瓶吃奶
And I had began to give her the bottle.

152
01:35:29,998 --> 01:35:31,168
我正在让卡尔吸我的奶
And I was giving Carl the titty,

153
01:35:31,661 --> 01:35:36,291
因为我一直没有断奶
because my milk hadn't dried up in my breasts.

154
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:40,705
不是因为她  是因为卡尔...
But not for her, because Carl was...

155
01:35:41,603 --> 01:35:43,388
卡尔一直在吃我的奶
Because Carl was sucking on them.

156
01:35:43,389 --> 01:35:47,619
所以我一直没有断奶
And that's what kept my milk in my breasts.

157
01:35:50,067 --> 01:35:52,962
我考虑到卫生问题
Then I thought that was for hygiene.

158
01:35:53,732 --> 01:35:56,998
我妈妈说这是我应该为孩子做的事
I did what my mother told me,

159
01:35:57,097 --> 01:35:59,934
我照着做了
that I was supposed to do with my child,

160
01:35:59,935 --> 01:36:01,366
我做了
So that's what I did.

161
01:36:01,456 --> 01:36:03,078
而你坐在这里
And you are sitting up there,

162
01:36:03,079 --> 01:36:04,295
对我品头论足...
and you are trying to judge me and you...

163
01:36:04,296 --> 01:36:05,586
我没有对你品头论足
I'm not judging you.

164
01:36:05,587 --> 01:36:07,048
但你来找我要钱
But you're asking me for money

165
01:36:07,049 --> 01:36:09,670
你要求我让你跟你的孙子重组家庭...
and you asked me to reunited your grandson...

166
01:36:09,671 --> 01:36:10,976
但魏斯女士
But Ms. Weiss,

167
01:36:10,977 --> 01:36:12,152
我不喜欢你这样看我
I don't like you looking at me like that.

168
01:36:12,153 --> 01:36:14,068
你让这个婊子这样看着我
You got this bitch looking at me

169
01:36:14,069 --> 01:36:15,632
好像我他妈的是个很烂的母亲
like I'm some kinda fucking Ma.

170
01:36:15,633 --> 01:36:17,724
我办公室里面不说脏话  行吗
We don't talk like this in my office, okay?

171
01:36:17,725 --> 01:36:21,218
我不想他吸奶之后喂她  因为那个很脏
I don't want her sucking behind him because that was nasty.

172
01:36:21,219 --> 01:36:25,377
这事它...那很脏  魏斯女士
And the thing it was...it was just nasty, Ms. Weiss.

173
01:36:27,746 --> 01:36:32,077
我有个男人...
I...I...I had a man,

174
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:34,730
还有个小孩
And I have a child.

175
01:36:36,118 --> 01:36:40,168
我得照顾他们俩
And I had to take care both of them, Okay.

176
01:36:41,572 --> 01:36:43,337
我不想让卡尔
Did I want Carl

177
01:36:45,159 --> 01:36:46,817
碰我的小孩
to touch my baby.

178
01:36:48,681 --> 01:36:50,775
我准备把她放在...
Because I would lay my baby...

179
01:36:50,997 --> 01:36:54,244
我准备把她放在我旁边
I would lay her on the side of me,

180
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:56,348
放在枕头上
on this pillow.

181
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:00,120
枕头是粉红的
And it was pink.

182
01:37:00,432 --> 01:37:03,145
上面有个白色的小标签
And they had this little white write

183
01:37:03,146 --> 01:37:05,332
写着她的名字
note on it that had her name.

184
01:37:06,383 --> 01:37:08,011
因为她是珍爱
Cause she was Precious.

185
01:37:08,544 --> 01:37:10,962
我把我的小孩放在枕头上
And I would let my baby on that pillow.

186
01:37:11,068 --> 01:37:14,925
卡尔会躺在另一边
And Carl would be lying on the other side.

187
01:37:15,758 --> 01:37:18,903
然后我们...我们就...
And then we would...we would...uh...

188
01:37:18,904 --> 01:37:22,020
可以做了  可是他翻过去
start doing it and he reached over

189
01:37:24,207 --> 01:37:26,202
摸我女儿
and he touch my baby.

190
01:37:26,289 --> 01:37:28,002
我问他
And I asked him.

191
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:30,937
我说  卡尔  你在做什么
I said, "Carl, what are you doing?"

192
01:37:31,315 --> 01:37:35,650
他让我闭嘴  闭上我的臭嘴
And he told me to shut...to shut my fat ass up

193
01:37:35,651 --> 01:37:36,728
说这样对她好
and it was good for her.

194
01:37:36,729 --> 01:37:37,753
然后你做了什么
And what did you do then?

195
01:37:37,754 --> 01:37:39,874
我闭上了我的臭嘴
I shut my fat ass up

196
01:37:40,672 --> 01:37:42,833
我不想让你坐在这里评判我
And I don't want you to sit there

197
01:37:42,834 --> 01:37:44,163
魏斯女士
and judge me, Ms. Weiss.

198
01:37:44,164 --> 01:37:46,031
你闭嘴了  任由他侵犯你的女儿
You shut up and you let him to abuse your daughter.

199
01:37:46,032 --> 01:37:47,962
我不想让他侵犯我的女儿
I did not want him to abuse my daughter.

200
01:37:47,963 --> 01:37:49,046
我不想让他...
I did not want want him to...

201
01:37:49,047 --> 01:37:50,265
但你放任他伤害她
But you allowed him to hurt her.

202
01:37:50,266 --> 01:37:51,447
什么也没做
Do nothing to her.

203
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:53,352
我想让他跟我做爱
I wanted him to make love to me.

204
01:37:53,353 --> 01:37:56,367
那是我的男人  那操他妈是我的男人
That was my man. That was my fucking man.

205
01:37:56,692 --> 01:37:59,813
那是我的男人  而他想要我的女儿
That was my man and he wanted my daughter.

206
01:38:00,911 --> 01:38:03,162
这就是为什么我恨她
And that's why I hated her.

207
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:06,382
因为我的男人  他应该爱我
Because my man who was supposed to be loving me,

208
01:38:06,383 --> 01:38:09,248
应该与我做爱...

209
01:38:10,153 --> 01:38:12,310
他却干了我的女儿
was fucking my baby.

210
01:38:12,311 --> 01:38:16,524
她勾引了他  她勾走了他
She made him leave, she made him go away.

211
01:38:16,731 --> 01:38:18,060
那这些都是谁的错呢
So whose fault was it then?

212
01:38:18,061 --> 01:38:19,084
都是这个小婊子的错
It's this bitch's fault!

213
01:38:19,085 --> 01:38:22,720
她让我的男人干她  她什么也没说
Cause she let my man have her and she didn't say nothing.

214
01:38:22,721 --> 01:38:24,981
她没有尖叫  她什么也没做
And she didn't scream and she didn't do nothing.

215
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:28,417
她说我对她做的那些事情...
So those things she told you I did to her...

216
01:38:28,418 --> 01:38:31,974
谁...谁来爱我
Who...who was gonna love me?

217
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:36,296
即然你学识高
Since you got your degree,

218
01:38:36,597 --> 01:38:38,277
你无所不知
and you know every fucking thing.

219
01:38:38,278 --> 01:38:39,801
请你告诉我  谁来爱我

谁...谁来让我感觉好点

她勾引了他  你知道吗
You know, she made him go away?

223
01:38:48,096 --> 01:38:53,034
你坐在这里  在你的本子上圈圈画画
So when you sit there, you write those fucking notes in your pad

224
01:38:53,247 --> 01:38:55,030
记下你对我的印象以及为什么我
about who you think I am

225
01:38:55,031 --> 01:38:58,127
那么做  而这一切
and why I did it and all of that.

226
01:38:58,578 --> 01:39:00,650
只是因为我碰上了
Because I am there.

227
01:39:08,554 --> 01:39:12,774
听着  一对一教学机构的人
Look, uhm...that people from each one teach one,

234
