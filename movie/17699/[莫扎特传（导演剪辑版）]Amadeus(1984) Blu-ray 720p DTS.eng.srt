1
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:28,327
Mozart!

2
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:40,012
Mozart!

3
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:42,779
Forgive your assassin!

4
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:46,984
I confess, I killed you!

5
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:50,161
Si, I killed you, Mozart.

6
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:57,765
Mozart, pieta! Forgive your assassin!

7
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:01,336
Forgive me, Mozart!

8
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,276
Signore Salieri,
open the door, be good now!

9
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:10,785
Signore, we have
something special for you.

10
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,155
Something you're going to love.

11
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,263
Is that good!

12
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:25,260
Signore, believe me...

13
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:29,805
...this is the most delicious thing
I ever ate in my life!

14
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,908
Really, you don't know
what you're miss...

15
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:42,758
All right, that's enough!
Open the door.

16
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:49,697
Signore, if you don't
open this door...

17
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,767
...we're gonna leave nothing
for you.

18
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:56,168
And I'm never gonna come
see you again!

19
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,481
Good morning, Father.

20
00:05:26,957 --> 00:05:28,720
Herr Salieri?

21
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,295
Leave me alone.

22
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:14,272
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

23
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:17,747
Do you know who I am?

24
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:22,150
That makes no difference.

25
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,581
All men are equal in God's eyes.

26
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:32,129
Are they?

27
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:35,664
Offer me your confession.

28
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,835
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

29
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:49,050
How well are you trained in music?

30
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:55,524
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.

31
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,989
- Where?
- Here in Vienna.

32
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:03,232
Then you must know this.

33
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,314
I can't say that I do.

34
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:16,709
What is it?

35
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,081
It was a very popular tune in its day.

36
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,485
I wrote it.

37
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:26,993
Here, how about this?

38
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:33,468
This one brought down the house
when we played it.

39
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:20,726
Well?

40
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:27,061
I regret it is not too familiar.

41
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:29,499
Can you recall no melody of mine?

42
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:33,404
I was the most famous composer
in Europe.

43
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:36,578
I wrote 40 operas alone.

44
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:40,011
Here!

45
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,583
What about this one?

46
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,068
Yes, I know that!

47
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,868
That's charming!

48
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:06,070
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you wrote that.

49
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:08,673
I didn't.

50
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:18,157
That was Mozart.

51
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:22,123
Wolfgang...

52
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:26,065
...Amadeus Mozart.

53
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:30,967
The man you accuse yourself
of killing.

54
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,541
You've heard that?

55
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,819
Is it true?

56
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:50,499
For God's sake, my son...

57
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:57,438
...if you have something to confess,
do it now.

58
00:09:57,876 --> 00:10:00,504
Give yourself some peace.

59
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,251
He...

60
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:09,518
...was my idol.

61
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,824
Mozart.

62
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:19,628
I can't think of a time
when I didn't know his name.

63
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:21,631
I was playing games...

64
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:26,103
...when he was playing music
for kings and emperors.

65
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,006
Even the pope in Rome.

66
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:35,148
I admit, I was jealous...

67
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:38,686
...when I heard the tales
they told about him.

68
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:41,223
Not of the brilliant prodigy...

69
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:46,455
...but of his father,
who had taught him everything.

70
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:50,067
My father, he did not care for music.

71
00:10:50,638 --> 00:10:52,105
When I told him...

72
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:55,798
...how I wished I could be
like Mozart...

73
00:10:56,011 --> 00:11:00,471
...he would say, "Why? Do you want
to be a trained monkey?

74
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:05,643
You'd like me to drag you around,
doing tricks like a circus freak?"

75
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:11,723
How could I tell him...

76
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,627
...what music meant to me?

77
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:32,981
While my father
prayed earnestly to God...

78
00:11:33,188 --> 00:11:35,850
...to protect commerce...

79
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:38,259
...I would offer up...

80
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:40,759
...secretly...

81
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:44,362
...the proudest prayer
a boy could think of.

82
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:48,868
"Lord, make me a great composer.

83
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:53,067
Let me celebrate your glory
through music...

84
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,076
...and be celebrated myself.

85
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,179
Make me famous through the world.

86
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,083
Make me immortal.

87
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,825
After I die...

88
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:10,896
...let people speak my name
with love for what I wrote.

89
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,293
In return...

90
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:18,405
...I will give you my chastity...

91
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:21,007
...my industry...

92
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,381
...my deepest humility,
every hour of my life.

93
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:30,513
Amen."

94
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:34,148
And do you know what happened?

95
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:36,520
A miracle!

96
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:57,044
My life changed forever.

97
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:01,555
I knew God had arranged it all.
That was obvious.

98
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,957
One minute I was a frustrated boy...

99
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:09,065
...in an obscure little town.
The next I was here...

100
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:12,431
...in Vienna, city of musicians...

101
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:17,375
...and Emperor Joseph,
the musical king.

102
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:22,572
In a few years, I was his court
composer. Isn't that incredible?

103
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:25,878
Every night I sat with
the emperor of Austria...

104
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:27,953
...playing duets with him...

105
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:30,785
...correcting the royal sight-reading.

106
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:37,656
Actually, the man had no ear at all.

107
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,031
But what did it matter?

108
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,706
He adored my music.

109
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:47,309
Tell me...

110
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,878
If you had been me...

111
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,044
...wouldn't you have thought
God had accepted your vow?

112
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,290
And believe me, I honored it.

113
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:02,195
I was a model of virtue.

114
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:04,730
I kept my hands off women.

115
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:09,428
I worked hours every day
teaching students, many for free!

116
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,838
Sitting on endless committees
to help poor musicians.

117
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:17,674
Work, that was all my life.

118
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:20,009
And it was wonderful.

119
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:22,710
Everybody liked me.

120
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:26,884
I liked myself.

121
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:32,526
Until he came.

122
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:38,870
He came to Vienna to play
some of his music...

123
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:45,539
...at the residence
of the prince archbishop of Salzburg.

124
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:50,251
Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.

125
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,491
That night...

126
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,527
...changed my life.

127
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,370
As I wandered through the salon...

128
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,265
...I played a little game with myself.

129
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:13,971
This man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4...

130
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:19,142
...his first symphony at 7,
a full-scale opera at 12!

131
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:21,879
Did it show?

132
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:26,120
Is talent like that...

133
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,197
...written on the face?

134
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:33,093
Which one of them...

135
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:37,071
...could he be?

136
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,180
Mozart is not here.

137
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:48,657
- Stop it!
- I am.

138
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:51,264
- Stop it!
- I am stopping it.

139
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:55,564
I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.

140
00:17:55,773 --> 00:18:00,369
There. You see? I've stopped.

141
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,809
- Now we're going back.
- No!

142
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,245
Yes! You don't know where you are.

143
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,984
Here, everything goes backwards.

144
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:13,116
People walk and dance and sing
and even talk backwards.

145
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:18,390
- That's stupid.
- Why? People fart backwards.

146
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:22,266
Say I'm sick!

147
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:24,432
Say I'm sick!

148
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,938
Yes, you are. You are very sick.

149
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:30,635
No! Say it backwards, shitwit!

150
00:18:31,214 --> 00:18:33,079
Saa-I'm-sick...

151
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:35,652
Sick, kiss.

152
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,321
I'm, my. Saa...

153
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:42,118
Kiss my ass.

154
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:44,358
Eem-iram!

155
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:47,294
- I'm not playing!
- Say it, it's serious.

156
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,899
It's very serious.

157
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:53,631
Iram...

158
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,201
Marry me.

159
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,974
I'm not gonna marry you.
You're a fiend.

160
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,549
Ooy-vol-l-tub...

161
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:07,046
Tub...

162
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:09,122
...but I...

163
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:12,891
Love...

164
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,565
But I love you?

165
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,768
- Tish I'm tee.
- What?

166
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:33,046
- Eat.
- Eat.

167
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:36,246
- I'm, my.
- My.

168
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,250
Tish. Eat my shit.

169
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,054
You filthy fiend!

170
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,199
You filthy...

171
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,733
My music.

172
00:19:52,043 --> 00:19:54,443
They've started without me.

173
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:11,062
That was Mozart!

174
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:17,535
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

175
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,069
- I think that went well, don't you?
- Indeed.

176
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,810
The Viennese know good music,
don't you think?

177
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,010
Certainly.

178
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,752
Your Grace.

179
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:36,190
Ah, Mozart.

180
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:40,298
- Why?
- Why what, sir?

181
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:44,440
Why must I be humiliated
in front of my guests...

182
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:47,133
...by one of my own servants?

183
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:50,746
The more license I allow you,
the more you take.

184
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,886
If His Grace is not satisfied,
he can dismiss me.

185
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:59,286
I wish you to return immediately
to Salzburg.

186
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:03,225
- Your father is waiting for you there.
- No, Your Grace!

187
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:08,835
I would prefer you dismissed me.
It's obvious I don't satisfy.

188
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:14,407
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service...

189
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:17,273
...and learn your place.

190
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,587
On the page it looked...

191
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:57,624
Nothing!

192
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:01,822
The beginning simple, almost comic.

193
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:04,625
Just a pulse.

194
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:08,500
Bassoons, basset horns...

195
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,734
...like a rusty squeezebox.

196
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:17,208
And then, suddenly...

197
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,614
...high above it...

198
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,620
...an oboe.

199
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:29,128
A single note, hanging there,
unwavering.

200
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:33,163
Until...

201
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,272
...a clarinet took it over...

202
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:43,138
...sweetened it into a phrase
of such delight.

203
00:23:47,153 --> 00:23:51,385
This was no composition
by a performing monkey.

204
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:57,560
This was a music I had never heard.

205
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:04,295
Filled with such longing,
such unfulfillable longing.

206
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:09,775
It seemed to me I was hearing
the voice of God.

207
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,208
Excuse me.

208
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,481
But why?

209
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:20,224
Why would God choose an obscene child
to be his instrument?

210
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:22,956
It was not to be believed.

211
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:27,827
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.

212
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,564
It better be.

213
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:37,245
How good is he, this Mozart?

214
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:42,850
He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an
extraordinary opera of his last month.

215
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:46,518
- Idomeneo, King of Crete.
- That?

216
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:49,857
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.

217
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:51,754
Tiresome?

218
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:56,963
A young man trying to impress
beyond his abilities.

219
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,502
Too much spice.

220
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,907
Too many notes.

221
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,874
Majesty...

222
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,571
...it was the most promising work
I've heard in years.

223
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:11,378
Well, then, we should make
some effort to acquire him.

224
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:15,920
We could use a good German composer
in Vienna, surely?

225
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:20,789
I'm sure he could be tempted
with the right offer. Say...

226
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:25,056
...an opera in German
for our National Theater.

227
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:26,463
Excellent, sire!

228
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:30,464
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.

229
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:34,942
Italian is the proper language
for opera.

230
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:37,977
All educated people agree on that.

231
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:44,522
What do you think, chamberlain?

232
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:49,358
In my opinion, it's time
we had a piece in our own language.

233
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:54,093
Plain German for plain people.

234
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:59,641
Kapellmeister?

235
00:25:59,843 --> 00:26:01,435
Majesty...

236
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,876
...I must agree with Herr Direttore.

237
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:08,614
German is...

238
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:15,527
...too brute for singing.

239
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,464
Court composer...

240
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:24,294
...what do you think?

241
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:29,404
I think it's an interesting notion
to keep Mozart in Vienna.

242
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:32,341
It should infuriate the archbishop...

243
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:35,578
...if that is Your Majesty's
intention.

244
00:26:35,786 --> 00:26:39,347
You are cattivo, court composer.

245
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:46,553
I want to meet this young man.
Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

246
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:49,829
Well, there it is!

247
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,638
This is a beautiful wig for you.

248
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:29,872
It looks so marvelous and I love it.

249
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,311
The other one.

250
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,821
Here is the other one.
I think you will love it.

251
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:43,862
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.

252
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:47,661
- How do you like it?
- They're all so beautiful!

253
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:50,669
Why don't I have three heads?

254
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:54,102
This is funny!

255
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:55,603
Three heads!

256
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:58,143
Gentlemen.

257
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:01,318
- Good morning.
- Morning, Your Majesty.

258
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:06,847
What do you have for me today?

259
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:11,196
- Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
- Yes, what about him?

260
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,367
He's here.

261
00:28:15,671 --> 00:28:17,536
Well, there it is. Good!

262
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:23,303
I hope you won't find it improper,
but I've written a march in his honor.

263
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:27,540
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?

264
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,150
Just a...

265
00:28:29,353 --> 00:28:32,015
Just a trifle, of course.

266
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:35,619
May I try it?

267
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:42,165
Let's have some fun.

268
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,849
Delightful, court composer!

269
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,717
May I play it when he comes in?

270
00:29:04,728 --> 00:29:08,494
- You do me too much honor.
- Bring in Herr Mozart.

271
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:10,360
But slowly.

272
00:29:10,568 --> 00:29:13,128
I need a minute to practice.

273
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:37,960
Good, continue.

274
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,731
G, Majesty.

275
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:47,770
Excellent!

276
00:29:49,514 --> 00:29:51,607
Good, Majesty.

277
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:55,318
Continue. Very good.

278
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:59,186
Very good, Majesty.

279
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:03,959
Tempo! Up.

280
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:07,896
Lightly, then strongly!
It's a march, Majesty.

281
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:09,798
Again.

282
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,782
Bravo, Majesty!

283
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:56,684
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.

284
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:05,396
No, please. It's not a holy relic.

285
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:12,210
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.

286
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:17,213
You don't recall. You were only 6.
He was giving a delightful concert!

287
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,451
As he got off the stool, he fell.

288
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:24,386
My sister Antoinette helped him up.
Know what he did?

289
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:29,758
He jumped into her arms and said,
"Will you marry me? Yes or no?"

290
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:37,504
You know all these gentlemen.
The Baron Van Swieten.

291
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:41,439
- I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.

292
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:43,239
Kapellmeister Bonno.

293
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:50,384
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

294
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,855
Sir, yes. The honor is mine,
absolutely!

295
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:59,296
Here is our
illustrious court composer...

296
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,366
...Maestro Salieri.

297
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,098
At last, such immense joy!

298
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:10,070
I know your work well.

299
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,876
You know, I composed some variations
on a melody of yours.

300
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:18,055
- Really? Which one?
- "Mio Caro Adone."

301
00:32:18,256 --> 00:32:19,621
I'm flattered.

302
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:22,953
A funny tune,
but it yielded some good things.

303
00:32:23,162 --> 00:32:26,029
And now he has returned
the compliment.

304
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:29,794
Herr Salieri composed
this little march for you.

305
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:31,698
Really?

306
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:35,565
Well, there it is.

307
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:41,009
Down to business. We're going
to commission an opera from you.

308
00:32:41,316 --> 00:32:43,113
What do you say?

309
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:47,885
Did we vote in the end
for German or Italian?

310
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:53,893
Sire, if you remember,
we did finally incline to Italian.

311
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:55,791
Did we?

312
00:32:57,235 --> 00:33:01,137
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.

313
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:06,942
- German. Please let it be German.
- Why so?

314
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:10,878
Because I've already found
the most wonderful libretto.

315
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,378
Have I seen it?

316
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:18,151
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.
It's quite new.

317
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,729
- I'll show it to you immediately.
- I think you'd better.

318
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:24,298
Well...

319
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:28,827
...tell us about it.
Tell us the story.

320
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:35,106
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.

321
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:39,944
It's set...
The whole thing is set in a...

322
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:48,120
Yes? Where?

323
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:52,357
In a harem, Majesty.
In a seraglio.

324
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:55,934
- You mean in Turkey?
- Yes, exactly.

325
00:33:57,073 --> 00:34:01,442
Then why especially
does it have to be in German?

326
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:07,139
It doesn't, especially. It could be
in Turkish if you really want.

327
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:12,449
No, my dear fellow, the language
is not finally the point.

328
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:18,222
Do you really think that subject
is appropriate for a national theater?

329
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,400
Why not? It's charming.

330
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:27,866
I mean, I won't actually show
concubines exposing their...

331
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,009
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.

332
00:34:32,214 --> 00:34:34,876
It's full of proper German virtues.

333
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:39,350
Excuse me, Majesty, but what
do you think these could be?

334
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:42,286
Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.

335
00:34:43,193 --> 00:34:46,492
Well, tell him, Mozart.

336
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:49,258
Name us a German virtue.

337
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:52,494
- Love, sire.
- Oh, love!

338
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:56,106
Of course, in Italy
we know nothing about love.

339
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:02,104
No, I don't think you do.

340
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:06,947
Watching Italian opera,
all those male sopranos screeching...

341
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:13,153
...fat couples rolling their eyes
about. That's not love. It's rubbish!

342
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:17,867
Majesty, you choose the language.

343
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:22,665
I'll set it to the finest music
ever offered a monarch.

344
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:26,469
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.

345
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:30,079
This is yours.

346
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:32,979
Keep it.
It's already here in my head.

347
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:36,380
What? On one hearing only?

348
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,855
I think so, sire. Yes.

349
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:44,994
Show us.

350
00:36:14,902 --> 00:36:17,234
The rest is the same, isn't it?

351
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,970
Doesn't really work, does it?

352
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:27,842
Did you try...?

353
00:36:29,953 --> 00:36:32,547
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?

354
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:34,785
Or this?

355
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,018
This. Yes.

356
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:44,128
Better?
What do you think?

357
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:39,892
All I ever wanted
was to sing to God.

358
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:43,502
He gave me that longing...

359
00:37:44,074 --> 00:37:47,134
...and then made me mute.
Why?

360
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:50,481
Tell me that.

361
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:55,349
If he didn't want me
to praise him with music...

362
00:37:55,554 --> 00:37:58,387
...why implant the desire...

363
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:01,592
...like a lust in my body?

364
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:04,561
And then deny me the talent?

365
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:11,530
Madame Cavalieri is here
for her lesson, sir.

366
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,401
Maestro.

367
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:17,134
Well...?

368
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:21,510
How do you like it?

369
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:24,578
It's Turkish.

370
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:28,918
My hairdresser said everything
this year's going to be Turkish.

371
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:30,754
Does he?

372
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:37,496
What else did he tell you today?

373
00:38:39,673 --> 00:38:43,302
Come, come!
Give me some gossip.

374
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,674
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.

375
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,388
News travels fast in Vienna.

376
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:59,217
And he's been commissioned
to write an opera. Is it true?

377
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:02,262
- Yes.
- Is there a part in it for me?

378
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:06,128
- No.
- How do you know?

379
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:10,069
- Do you know where it's set, my dear?
- Where?

380
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:12,107
In a harem.

381
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:15,977
- What's that?
- A brothel.

382
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:21,752
Come.

383
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:24,514
Let's begin.

384
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:28,818
- What does he look like?
- Mozart?

385
00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:31,693
- You might be disappointed.
- Why?

386
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:36,938
Looks and talent don't always
go together, Katerina.

387
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,938
Looks don't concern me, maestro.

388
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:44,410
Only talent interests
a woman of taste.

389
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,114
Shall we continue?

390
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,830
There she was.

391
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:33,105
I don't know where they met or how.
There she stood!

392
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:35,673
On stage, for all to see.

393
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:39,903
Showing off like
the greedy songbird she was.

394
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:17,917
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios!

395
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:22,655
Whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground.

396
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,876
Understand, I was
in love with the girl.

397
00:41:37,816 --> 00:41:39,909
Or at least in lust.

398
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,389
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.

399
00:41:49,663 --> 00:41:55,067
All the same, I couldn't bear
to think of anyone else touching her.

400
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,171
Least of all, "the creature."

401
00:43:41,796 --> 00:43:46,495
Brava, madame!
You are an ornament to our stage.

402
00:43:47,803 --> 00:43:48,963
Your Majesty.

403
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:55,602
Well, Herr Mozart.
A good effort.

404
00:43:55,812 --> 00:43:57,302
Well, decidedly that.

405
00:43:57,514 --> 00:44:01,450
An excellent effort!
You have shown us something...

406
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:06,587
...quite new tonight.
- It is new.

407
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,192
- It is, isn't it, sire?
- Yes, indeed.

408
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:13,798
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?

409
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,992
Well, of course I did!
It's very good!

410
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:21,231
Of course, now and then...
Just now and then...

411
00:44:21,443 --> 00:44:24,071
...it seemed a touch...

412
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:27,312
What do you mean, sire?

413
00:44:27,516 --> 00:44:31,816
Well, I mean, occasionally,
it seems to have...

414
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:34,955
How shall one say...?

415
00:44:37,695 --> 00:44:40,129
How shall one say, direktor?

416
00:44:40,331 --> 00:44:43,630
- Too many notes, Majesty?
- Exactly. Very well put.

417
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:48,364
- Too many notes.
- I don't understand.

418
00:44:48,675 --> 00:44:52,907
There are as many notes as
are required, neither more nor less.

419
00:44:53,113 --> 00:44:55,707
My dear fellow, there are in fact...

420
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:59,943
...only so many notes
the ear can hear in an evening.

421
00:45:01,857 --> 00:45:05,293
I'm right in saying that,
aren't I, court composer?

422
00:45:07,263 --> 00:45:10,755
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.

423
00:45:11,435 --> 00:45:12,959
This is absurd!

424
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,072
Young man, don't take it too hard.
Your work is ingenious.

425
00:45:17,275 --> 00:45:19,334
It's quality work.

426
00:45:19,544 --> 00:45:24,777
There are simply too many notes.
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

427
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,477
Which few did you have in mind?

428
00:45:28,255 --> 00:45:30,246
Wolfgang!

429
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:34,089
Wolfgang, my dear!

430
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,826
- Wolfgang!
- Majesty, this is Frau Weber.

431
00:45:40,035 --> 00:45:42,526
She's my landlady.

432
00:45:44,974 --> 00:45:50,641
- Enchanted, madame.
- Sire, such an honor!

433
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,552
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.

434
00:45:57,756 --> 00:46:01,522
- She's the fianc? E of Herr Mozart.
- Really?

435
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:09,127
How charming. Please.

436
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:29,615
Well, when do you marry?

437
00:46:32,263 --> 00:46:35,790
We haven't exactly received
my father's consent yet.

438
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:40,131
Not entirely. Not altogether.

439
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:47,506
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
- Twenty-six.

440
00:46:48,149 --> 00:46:52,449
My advice is for you to marry
this charming young lady...

441
00:46:52,654 --> 00:46:56,021
...and stay with us in Vienna.
- You see?

442
00:46:56,225 --> 00:46:59,251
I told him that,
but he won't listen to me.

443
00:46:59,462 --> 00:47:03,364
Your Majesty,
you give such wonderful...

444
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,260
...such royal advice. May I...?

445
00:47:17,616 --> 00:47:20,483
Well, there it is.

446
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,556
Get some water!

447
00:47:26,494 --> 00:47:29,292
Will you get some water, please?

448
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,570
Wolfie, get some water!

449
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:47,850
Excuse me. Excuse me.

450
00:47:55,328 --> 00:47:57,159
Did you know?

451
00:47:58,532 --> 00:48:00,864
- What?
- The marriage.

452
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:06,069
What does it matter to you?

453
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:10,904
Nothing. He can marry who he pleases,
I don't give a damn.

454
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:15,309
How was I?

455
00:48:16,786 --> 00:48:18,651
You were sublime.

456
00:48:19,156 --> 00:48:22,148
And what did you think of the music?

457
00:48:23,294 --> 00:48:25,285
Extremely clever.

458
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:28,491
Katerina, l...

459
00:48:28,734 --> 00:48:30,326
Excuse me.

460
00:48:31,237 --> 00:48:34,764
Is that woman still lying
on the floor?

461
00:48:34,974 --> 00:48:40,378
- No, she's fine.
- Oh, I'm so relieved.

462
00:48:41,149 --> 00:48:44,084
Dear Mozart,
my sincere congratulations.

463
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:48,685
- Did you like it then?
- How could I not?

464
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:52,427
It's the best music
in Vienna today, agree?

465
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:55,462
She must be dazzling in bed.

466
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:01,865
I assume she's the virtuoso
in that department.

467
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:05,600
No other reason why
you'd marry someone like that.

468
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:08,936
Come in.

469
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:15,785
Excuse me.
Wolfie, Mom isn't feeling very well.

470
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,457
- Can we go home?
- Yes.

471
00:49:17,758 --> 00:49:20,921
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.

472
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:23,893
This is his night.

473
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,693
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?

474
00:49:27,003 --> 00:49:29,904
Excuse us, Fraulein.
Good night.

475
00:49:32,142 --> 00:49:37,170
At that moment I knew,
beyond any doubt...

476
00:49:37,382 --> 00:49:39,543
...he'd had her.

477
00:49:39,751 --> 00:49:43,312
The creature had
had my darling girl.

478
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:53,661
It was incomprehensible!

479
00:49:54,102 --> 00:49:56,832
What was God up to?

480
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:01,267
Was it possible I was being tested?

481
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:07,008
Was God expecting me
to offer forgiveness...

482
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:10,015
...in the face of every offense?

483
00:50:10,221 --> 00:50:12,018
No matter how painful?

484
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:19,661
It's very possible.
But why him?

485
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:25,201
Why choose Mozart
to teach me lessons in humility?

486
00:50:25,872 --> 00:50:27,737
My heart was filling up...

487
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,342
...with such hatred
for that little man.

488
00:50:32,847 --> 00:50:36,339
For the first time in my life,
I began to know...

489
00:50:36,551 --> 00:50:38,246
...really...

490
00:50:38,921 --> 00:50:41,048
...violent thoughts.

491
00:50:42,024 --> 00:50:47,257
Every day, sometimes for hours,
I would pray.

492
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,123
Lord...

493
00:50:51,269 --> 00:50:52,793
...please...

494
00:50:53,972 --> 00:50:55,735
...send him away...

495
00:50:55,941 --> 00:50:58,637
...back to Salzburg.

496
00:51:00,513 --> 00:51:02,777
For his sake...

497
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:06,084
...as well as mine.

498
00:51:08,255 --> 00:51:11,691
- No! I won't have him back.
- But, Your Grace...

499
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:17,730
Your son is an unprincipled,
spoiled, conceited brat!

500
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:21,126
Yes, sir...

501
00:51:21,905 --> 00:51:24,066
...that is the truth.

502
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:30,537
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.

503
00:51:30,748 --> 00:51:33,683
I was too indulgent with him.

504
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,153
Please, Your Grace?

505
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,254
Give him one more chance?

506
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:43,886
You have leave to try.

507
00:51:44,131 --> 00:51:48,295
God bless, Your Grace!
I thank Your Grace.

508
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:50,471
I thank you!

509
00:51:54,142 --> 00:51:58,579
I write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.

510
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:02,649
Take no further steps
towards marriage until we meet.

511
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:06,983
As you honor the father who has
devoted his life to yours...

512
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:10,127
...do as I bid,
and await my coming.

513
00:52:23,545 --> 00:52:27,481
I now join you in the holy bonds
of matrimony.

514
00:52:28,617 --> 00:52:31,279
Those whom God hath joined together...

515
00:52:31,754 --> 00:52:34,518
...let no man put asunder.

516
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,437
Beloved father:

517
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:55,136
You say Vienna is the musicians' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.

518
00:52:55,348 --> 00:52:58,749
With my wife I can do it.
One day, when I'm wealthy...

519
00:52:58,953 --> 00:53:02,889
...you'll come and live with us,
and we'll be so happy.

520
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:17,166
Good morning.
This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.

521
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:18,363
Your Highness.

522
00:53:18,576 --> 00:53:21,807
She's asked me to recommend
a musical instructor.

523
00:53:22,013 --> 00:53:25,881
- I've come up with an excellent idea.
- Your Majesty!

524
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:29,077
It would be such a tremendous honor!

525
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:33,550
I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?

526
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:38,560
It's an interesting idea, Majesty.
But...

527
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:41,359
Yes?

528
00:53:41,903 --> 00:53:45,339
My concern is to protect you...

529
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:49,237
...from any hint of favoritism.

530
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:55,474
Favoritism.

531
00:53:55,686 --> 00:53:58,086
- What is this?
- What is what?

532
00:53:58,523 --> 00:54:04,360
Why must I submit samples of my work
to a committee, to teach a girl?

533
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:07,225
Because His Majesty wishes it.

534
00:54:08,368 --> 00:54:10,768
Is the emperor angry with me?

535
00:54:11,271 --> 00:54:14,729
- On the contrary.
- Then why not appoint me to the post?

536
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:18,709
Mozart, you're not
the only composer in Vienna.

537
00:54:18,913 --> 00:54:22,371
No. But I'm the best.

538
00:54:23,252 --> 00:54:25,186
Mozart.

539
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:30,086
A little modesty
might suit you better.

540
00:54:37,169 --> 00:54:39,160
Who is on this committee?

541
00:54:39,638 --> 00:54:44,268
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count
Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.

542
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:49,005
Naturally, the Italians!
Of course, always the Italians!

543
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,010
They're all musical idiots!

544
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:58,390
- And you want them to judge my music?
- Young man...

545
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:02,724
...the issue is quite simple.
If you want this position...

546
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:07,062
...you must submit your stuff
along with all your colleagues.

547
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,363
Must I?

548
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:12,609
Well, I won't.

549
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,301
How are we supposed to live?

550
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:19,745
Do you want me to beg on the streets?

551
00:55:19,952 --> 00:55:21,920
Don't be stupid.

552
00:55:22,922 --> 00:55:25,789
- All they want to see is your work.
- Shit.

553
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:30,862
- What's wrong with that?
- Shut up! Just shut up.

554
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:34,796
One royal pupil,
and all of Vienna will come flocking.

555
00:55:35,337 --> 00:55:37,828
They'll come anyway.

556
00:55:38,374 --> 00:55:42,037
- No, they won't.
- They love me here.

557
00:55:42,246 --> 00:55:46,182
- I know how things work in this city.
- You know everything.

558
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:17,212
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.

559
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,412
- A lady insists on talking to you.
- Who?

560
00:56:20,623 --> 00:56:24,059
She didn't say,
but she says it's urgent.

561
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,628
Excuse me, my dear.

562
00:56:33,272 --> 00:56:35,069
Your Excellency.

563
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:38,872
How can I help you?

564
00:56:43,852 --> 00:56:47,948
- Frau Mozart?
- I've come on behalf of my husband.

565
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:53,253
I brought samples of his work so he
can be considered for the appointment.

566
00:56:55,432 --> 00:56:59,493
How charming,
but why did he not come himself?

567
00:57:01,272 --> 00:57:04,070
He's terribly busy, sir.

568
00:57:07,646 --> 00:57:08,943
I understand.

569
00:57:11,985 --> 00:57:14,545
I'll look at them the moment I can.

570
00:57:14,754 --> 00:57:18,781
It will be an honor.
Please give him my warmest regards.

571
00:57:18,993 --> 00:57:23,555
Would it be too much trouble
to ask you to look at them now?

572
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:27,726
- While I wait.
- I'm afraid I'm not at leisure...

573
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:30,770
...this precise moment.

574
00:57:30,973 --> 00:57:34,204
Leave them.
I assure you, they will be safe.

575
00:57:35,612 --> 00:57:38,479
I really cannot do that, sir.

576
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:42,842
You see, he doesn't know I'm here.

577
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,117
He didn't send you?

578
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:50,888
No, sir. This was my own idea.

579
00:57:53,266 --> 00:57:56,997
- I see.
- Sir, we're desperate.

580
00:57:57,905 --> 00:58:01,363
We really need this job.

581
00:58:01,576 --> 00:58:04,841
My husband spends far more
than he can ever earn.

582
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:09,211
I don't mean that he's lazy,
because he works all day long.

583
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:13,947
It's just that he's not practical.

584
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:18,556
Money simply slips through
his fingers. It's ridiculous.

585
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,495
Let me offer you some refreshment.

586
00:58:24,704 --> 00:58:26,934
Do you know what these are?

587
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:32,009
Capezzoli di Venere!
Nipples of Venus.

588
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:38,017
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied
sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!

589
00:58:38,353 --> 00:58:40,651
They're quite surprising.

590
00:58:45,628 --> 00:58:47,562
They're wonderful!

591
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:52,433
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

592
00:58:52,636 --> 00:58:55,366
Don't keep calling me that.

593
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:58,938
Keeps me at such a distance.

594
00:58:59,778 --> 00:59:02,747
I wasn't born a court composer,
you know.

595
00:59:02,948 --> 00:59:05,109
I'm from a small town.

596
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:07,512
Just like your husband.

597
00:59:09,955 --> 00:59:12,753
Are you sure you can't...

598
00:59:13,058 --> 00:59:16,255
...leave this and come back again?

599
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,830
It's very tempting, sir.

600
00:59:21,032 --> 00:59:24,331
But it's impossible, I'm afraid.

601
00:59:24,903 --> 00:59:27,929
He'd be frantic
if he knew they were missing.

602
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,938
You see, they're all originals.

603
00:59:32,077 --> 00:59:35,274
- Originals?
- Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

604
00:59:46,992 --> 00:59:48,892
These...

605
00:59:49,094 --> 00:59:50,459
...are originals?

606
01:00:27,032 --> 01:00:28,397
Astounding!

607
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:32,403
It was actually...
It was beyond belief.

608
01:00:33,205 --> 01:00:35,833
These were first and only...

609
01:00:36,408 --> 01:00:38,535
...drafts of music.

610
01:00:39,878 --> 01:00:45,475
But they showed no corrections
of any kind. Not one.

611
01:00:48,253 --> 01:00:50,983
He had simply written down music...

612
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,625
...already finished in his head.

613
01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:00,521
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.

614
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:09,263
And music...

615
01:01:09,741 --> 01:01:13,472
...finished as no music
is ever finished.

616
01:01:16,615 --> 01:01:19,243
Displace one note...

617
01:01:19,618 --> 01:01:22,314
...and there would be diminishment.

618
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:27,855
Displace one phrase,
the structure would fall.

619
01:01:31,529 --> 01:01:34,020
It was clear to me...

620
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:38,601
...that sound I had heard
in the archbishop's palace...

621
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:41,772
...had been no accident.

622
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:47,567
Here again
was the very voice of God.

623
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,851
I was staring through the cage...

624
01:01:55,053 --> 01:01:58,318
...of those meticulous ink strokes...

625
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:03,721
...at an absolute beauty.

626
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,078
Is it not good?

627
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:27,642
It is miraculous!

628
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:35,990
Yes, he's very proud of his work.

629
01:02:38,396 --> 01:02:40,660
So you will help us?

630
01:02:42,867 --> 01:02:45,802
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening.

631
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:49,607
One word from me and the post is his.

632
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,504
Thank you, Your Excellency!
Thank you!

633
01:02:52,911 --> 01:02:55,141
Come back tonight.

634
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,014
- Tonight?
- Alone.

635
01:03:01,686 --> 01:03:02,846
What for?

636
01:03:04,522 --> 01:03:07,980
Some service
deserves service in return.

637
01:03:09,894 --> 01:03:11,759
No?

638
01:03:13,064 --> 01:03:16,830
- What do you mean?
- Isn't it obvious?

639
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,467
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

640
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,941
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.

641
01:03:25,577 --> 01:03:28,341
I'm a married woman, sir.

642
01:03:28,546 --> 01:03:30,207
Then don't.

643
01:03:30,715 --> 01:03:32,683
It's up to you.

644
01:03:33,318 --> 01:03:36,549
And not to be vague,
that is the price.

645
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,033
There is no God of mercy, Father.

646
01:03:54,339 --> 01:03:57,240
Just a God of torture.

647
01:04:03,415 --> 01:04:05,440
Evening came.

648
01:04:06,484 --> 01:04:10,818
I sat there,
not knowing whether she'd return.

649
01:04:11,823 --> 01:04:16,726
I prayed as I have
never prayed before.

650
01:04:17,695 --> 01:04:19,959
Dear God...

651
01:04:20,165 --> 01:04:22,565
...enter me now.

652
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:27,397
Fill me with one piece of true music.

653
01:04:27,605 --> 01:04:32,668
One piece with your breath in it,
so I know that you love me.

654
01:04:33,144 --> 01:04:39,105
Show me one sign of your favor,
and I will show mine to Mozart.

655
01:04:39,818 --> 01:04:43,879
I will get him the royal position.

656
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,086
Enter me.

657
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:48,225
Please.

658
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,755
Please!

659
01:04:58,503 --> 01:04:59,663
Yes?

660
01:05:03,908 --> 01:05:05,637
That lady is back, sir.

661
01:05:11,182 --> 01:05:12,342
Show her in.

662
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,417
Well?

663
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:51,087
I'm here.

664
01:05:54,692 --> 01:05:58,059
My husband has gone to a concert.

665
01:05:58,763 --> 01:06:01,459
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

666
01:06:12,443 --> 01:06:14,968
Well, where shall we go?

667
01:06:16,481 --> 01:06:19,245
Should we stay here?

668
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:22,479
Well...

669
01:06:25,924 --> 01:06:28,119
You still want to look at these?

670
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:34,089
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

671
01:06:36,901 --> 01:06:39,768
Suppose we don't, really.

672
01:07:36,728 --> 01:07:38,787
Show this woman out.

673
01:08:00,351 --> 01:08:01,818
Stanzi.

674
01:08:03,488 --> 01:08:05,388
Stanzi.

675
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:12,858
What is it?

676
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:17,662
What's the matter?
Tell me.

677
01:08:28,112 --> 01:08:30,376
I love you.

678
01:08:31,215 --> 01:08:34,013
I love you.

679
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:38,554
From now on, we are enemies.

680
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:40,520
You and I.

681
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:42,989
You choose for your instrument...

682
01:08:43,194 --> 01:08:48,461
...a boastful, lustful,
smutty, infantile boy...

683
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:54,605
...and give me for reward only the
ability to recognize the incarnation.

684
01:08:55,239 --> 01:08:58,208
Because you are unjust...

685
01:08:58,576 --> 01:09:00,237
...unfair...

686
01:09:01,245 --> 01:09:03,475
...unkind...

687
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,444
...I will block you.

688
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:08,278
I swear it.

689
01:09:08,486 --> 01:09:11,785
I will hinder and harm
your creature on earth...

690
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:14,287
...as far as I am able.

691
01:09:14,792 --> 01:09:17,920
I don't like to talk
against a fellow musician.

692
01:09:18,129 --> 01:09:19,824
Of course not.

693
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,295
I have to tell you.

694
01:09:23,234 --> 01:09:28,536
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted
alone with young ladies.

695
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,571
Really?

696
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:34,871
One of my own pupils,
a very young singer...

697
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:37,138
...Maria Theresa Paradis...

698
01:09:37,348 --> 01:09:39,543
...told me she was...

699
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:43,346
Well...

700
01:09:45,323 --> 01:09:47,587
Well, what?

701
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,717
Molested, Majesty.

702
01:09:50,928 --> 01:09:54,125
Twice, in the course of
the same lesson.

703
01:09:59,003 --> 01:10:03,269
There is a Herr Mozart
waiting for you in the salon.

704
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:10,112
- Whom did they choose?
- Herr Zummer.

705
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,606
Herr Zummer?

706
01:10:12,817 --> 01:10:16,480
But the man's a fool!
He's a total mediocrity.

707
01:10:16,687 --> 01:10:21,556
No, no. He has yet
to achieve mediocrity.

708
01:10:23,561 --> 01:10:27,190
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.

709
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,991
Excellency, please.

710
01:10:31,169 --> 01:10:35,162
Let's go to the palace.
You can talk to the emperor...

711
01:10:35,373 --> 01:10:39,537
...and tell him that Herr Zummer
is an awful choice.

712
01:10:39,744 --> 01:10:42,804
He could do musical harm
to the princess.

713
01:10:43,147 --> 01:10:48,483
Between us, no one in the world
could do musical harm to the princess.

714
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:54,048
Look...

715
01:10:54,258 --> 01:10:56,089
...I must have pupils.

716
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:59,593
Without pupils, I can't manage.

717
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:02,960
You don't mean
you're living in poverty?

718
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:06,534
No, but I'm broke.

719
01:11:06,904 --> 01:11:08,997
Well, how is this possible?

720
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:12,176
I hear your concerts are
quite successful.

721
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:15,738
They're stupendously successful.

722
01:11:16,013 --> 01:11:19,949
You can't get a seat.
The trouble is, no one will hire me.

723
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:25,851
They won't let me teach their
daughters, as if I was a fiend.

724
01:11:31,796 --> 01:11:34,094
Seriously...

725
01:11:34,298 --> 01:11:37,665
...is there any chance
you could manage a loan?

726
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:42,199
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.

727
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:46,302
You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?

728
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:49,911
As a matter of fact, I do.

729
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:55,778
I am working on something that will
explode like a bomb all over Europe.

730
01:11:55,987 --> 01:12:01,015
I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
I'll pay you back double.

731
01:12:01,492 --> 01:12:03,323
You name the terms.

732
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,791
Well, how exciting.

733
01:12:06,163 --> 01:12:08,688
Tell me more.

734
01:12:10,301 --> 01:12:11,859
It's a bit of a secret.

735
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:17,105
- Come, come. I'm interested.
- This is delicious. What is it?

736
01:12:17,975 --> 01:12:20,739
Cream cheese mixed with sugar...

737
01:12:20,912 --> 01:12:25,246
...suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.

738
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:27,110
Italian.

739
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:31,745
Forgive me. We all have
patriotic feelings of some kind.

740
01:12:32,123 --> 01:12:33,784
Two thou...

741
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:37,526
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need.

742
01:12:39,597 --> 01:12:41,155
A hundred.

743
01:12:43,534 --> 01:12:45,525
Fifty.

744
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:49,172
What exactly are you working on?

745
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:55,034
Really, I can't say.

746
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:01,312
I don't think you should become known
in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.

747
01:13:08,659 --> 01:13:10,251
However...

748
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:14,724
...I know a distinguished
gentleman I can recommend, and...

749
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,297
...he has a daughter.

750
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:24,097
Quiet! Quiet!

751
01:13:24,308 --> 01:13:26,071
Herr Mozart.

752
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:30,179
Welcome. Pay no attention,
they're impossible.

753
01:13:30,381 --> 01:13:33,578
I treat them just like
my own children.

754
01:13:34,352 --> 01:13:37,287
Which of them do you
wish me to teach?

755
01:13:40,658 --> 01:13:42,819
That's funny.

756
01:13:43,527 --> 01:13:46,291
You're a funny fellow.

757
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:50,924
This is the instrument.
I hope it will be to your satisfaction.

758
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:54,298
Of course it'll be
to his satisfaction.

759
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:58,340
Come, we're going to listen
to some music. Come!

760
01:13:59,043 --> 01:14:01,034
Good boy.

761
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,174
Now.

762
01:14:08,386 --> 01:14:12,584
Please play me something,
just to give me an idea.

763
01:14:13,557 --> 01:14:15,752
Anything will do.

764
01:14:17,094 --> 01:14:18,322
Just go ahead.

765
01:14:18,529 --> 01:14:21,498
Just as if we weren't here.

766
01:14:22,967 --> 01:14:27,734
Part of music, getting used
to an audience. Right, Herr Mozart?

767
01:14:27,938 --> 01:14:31,499
Perhaps it would be better
if we were left alone.

768
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:33,734
We're both a little shy.

769
01:14:33,944 --> 01:14:35,172
Play.

770
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,645
- I said play!
- Michael, please.

771
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:43,115
Perhaps if I play first,
it might encourage the Fraulein.

772
01:14:43,621 --> 01:14:45,953
Why don't you let me try?

773
01:14:55,733 --> 01:14:57,030
Stop it! Stop!

774
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,761
He always howls when he hears music.

775
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:02,666
We've got to break him of that habit.

776
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:06,309
We've got to break them
of their habit!

777
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:07,841
Play. Please.

778
01:15:08,245 --> 01:15:12,477
Herr Mozart, play.
Please, I beg you.

779
01:15:19,857 --> 01:15:21,552
That's it.

780
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:27,327
Keep playing!

781
01:15:33,304 --> 01:15:36,330
Keep playing!
That's it!

782
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:59,024
Mozart, that's wonderful!
Wonderful!

783
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:04,094
Next time you wish me to instruct
another of your dogs, let me know.

784
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:07,896
Goodbye, Fraulein. Goodbye, madam.
Goodbye, sir.

785
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,027
Papa?

786
01:17:10,868 --> 01:17:12,529
Papa!

787
01:17:16,574 --> 01:17:18,508
Why are you here?

788
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:20,404
Am I not welcome?

789
01:17:20,611 --> 01:17:25,207
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome! Welcome!

790
01:17:46,837 --> 01:17:48,600
You're thin.

791
01:17:48,806 --> 01:17:50,637
Doesn't your wife feed you?

792
01:17:50,808 --> 01:17:52,901
Feed! Of course she feeds me.

793
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:56,204
She stuffs me like a goose, all day!

794
01:17:56,413 --> 01:17:59,905
- Is she not here?
- No, she had to help her mother.

795
01:18:00,117 --> 01:18:01,914
She's like that.

796
01:18:02,086 --> 01:18:05,055
Her mother's a very sweet woman.

797
01:18:13,097 --> 01:18:15,793
I didn't know you were home.

798
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,331
Stanzi, this is my father.

799
01:18:21,805 --> 01:18:25,241
We'll wait. We'll wait.

800
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:29,907
Why don't you get up now, my darling?

801
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,954
She's very tired, poor creature.

802
01:18:39,156 --> 01:18:41,124
You know me.
I'm such a pig.

803
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:44,261
It's not easy cleaning up after me.

804
01:18:44,995 --> 01:18:46,963
Don't you have a maid?

805
01:18:47,164 --> 01:18:49,325
Oh. No.

806
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:51,125
We could if we wanted...

807
01:18:51,335 --> 01:18:54,736
...but Stanzi insists on doing
everything herself.

808
01:18:56,073 --> 01:18:58,303
How is your...

809
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:01,600
...financial situation?

810
01:19:01,812 --> 01:19:03,541
Couldn't be better.

811
01:19:04,915 --> 01:19:06,883
That's not what I hear.

812
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:08,381
What do you mean?

813
01:19:08,585 --> 01:19:10,018
It's wonderful.

814
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:13,883
Really, it's marvelous!
People love me here.

815
01:19:15,159 --> 01:19:17,320
They say you have debts.

816
01:19:18,362 --> 01:19:19,386
Who?

817
01:19:20,364 --> 01:19:21,854
Who says that?

818
01:19:22,599 --> 01:19:24,726
That's a malicious lie!

819
01:19:25,102 --> 01:19:26,831
Do you have pupils?

820
01:19:27,838 --> 01:19:30,363
I don't want pupils!

821
01:19:31,075 --> 01:19:33,270
They get in the way.

822
01:19:34,712 --> 01:19:37,374
I have to have time for composition.

823
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,742
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.

824
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:42,714
That one will.

825
01:19:43,554 --> 01:19:45,419
What's that?

826
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:48,724
It's a secret.

827
01:19:48,959 --> 01:19:51,951
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.

828
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,558
No, no, no!

829
01:19:54,732 --> 01:19:58,964
Please! I don't want anyone to see it.

830
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:00,830
You'll be so proud of me.

831
01:20:01,038 --> 01:20:05,338
It's going to be the
best thing that I've ever done.

832
01:20:08,245 --> 01:20:09,337
There she is!

833
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:12,606
Look at her!
Isn't she beautiful?

834
01:20:12,783 --> 01:20:13,772
Confess it.

835
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:18,752
- Could you want a prettier daughter?
- Stop it, Wolfie!

836
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:21,051
I look dreadful.

837
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:26,561
Are you expecting?

838
01:20:26,964 --> 01:20:30,695
- Yes, I am.
- Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.

839
01:20:31,735 --> 01:20:36,195
- May I offer you some tea?
- Who wants tea? Let's go out!

840
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:39,865
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you?

841
01:20:40,077 --> 01:20:44,639
I know! Let's go dancing.
Papa loves parties, don't you?

842
01:20:44,848 --> 01:20:48,249
How can you be so boring? Tea!

843
01:20:52,489 --> 01:20:53,956
Come on, Papa. Hurry!

844
01:20:54,158 --> 01:20:56,388
Here we go. Good day.

845
01:21:38,969 --> 01:21:40,300
Now!

846
01:21:46,176 --> 01:21:50,636
I name the penalty!

847
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,448
And the penalty is...

848
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:58,247
- Give her a good one!
- Show us your legs!

849
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:05,255
Come on, come on!

850
01:22:17,908 --> 01:22:20,240
It's just a game, Papa.

851
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:03,679
Herr Mozart, why don't you
name your son's penalty?!

852
01:23:06,056 --> 01:23:08,957
Yes, Papa. Name it.

853
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:12,594
I'll do anything you say. Anything.

854
01:23:15,299 --> 01:23:19,201
I want you to come back
to Salzburg with me.

855
01:23:19,403 --> 01:23:22,998
The penalty must be
performed in the room.

856
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,203
I'm tired of this game.

857
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:30,070
But my penalty!
I've got to have a penalty!

858
01:23:34,685 --> 01:23:36,846
I name a penalty!

859
01:23:39,756 --> 01:23:41,155
The penalty is...

860
01:23:41,959 --> 01:23:43,859
...you shall play our tune...

861
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:48,725
...in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach!

862
01:24:15,726 --> 01:24:17,785
Turn him over!

863
01:24:20,464 --> 01:24:22,830
Now you play it backwards!

864
01:24:50,694 --> 01:24:53,254
Another one! Give me another one!

865
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,124
Play like Gluck!

866
01:24:55,332 --> 01:24:56,697
Boring. Another!

867
01:24:56,867 --> 01:24:57,856
Handel!

868
01:24:58,035 --> 01:25:01,198
I don't like him! Another one!

869
01:25:01,371 --> 01:25:03,396
Play Salieri.

870
01:25:04,207 --> 01:25:07,870
Now that is a challenge!
That is a challenge.

871
01:25:08,278 --> 01:25:10,974
Please! Please!

872
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:48,484
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!

873
01:25:53,557 --> 01:25:56,287
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.

874
01:25:56,493 --> 01:25:58,120
That was God.

875
01:25:58,328 --> 01:26:02,924
That was God laughing at me
through that obscene giggle.

876
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:08,728
Go on, signore.
Laugh.

877
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:13,137
Show my mediocrity for all to see.

878
01:26:14,511 --> 01:26:17,412
One day I will laugh at you.

879
01:26:20,517 --> 01:26:23,418
Before I leave this earth...

880
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:26,418
...I will laugh at you.

881
01:26:48,211 --> 01:26:50,839
- Wolfie?
- What?

882
01:26:52,015 --> 01:26:54,813
There's a young girl here to see you.

883
01:26:55,018 --> 01:26:56,508
What does she want?

884
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:01,555
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.

885
01:27:02,793 --> 01:27:04,226
Damn.

886
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:10,430
Yes?

887
01:27:12,402 --> 01:27:15,269
- Are you Herr Mozart?
- That's right.

888
01:27:17,073 --> 01:27:20,873
My name is Lorl, sir.
I'm a maidservant.

889
01:27:21,077 --> 01:27:25,036
I was asked to come here
and offer my services to you.

890
01:27:25,248 --> 01:27:30,379
They'll be paid for by an admirer
of yours who wishes to remain...

891
01:27:30,587 --> 01:27:32,555
...anonymous.

892
01:27:33,356 --> 01:27:35,756
Is this your idea, Papa?

893
01:27:37,093 --> 01:27:38,526
Mine?

894
01:27:38,728 --> 01:27:42,858
- Are you playing a trick on me?
- I've never seen this girl.

895
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,368
- Is this a joke?
- Not at all, sir.

896
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:50,003
Young woman, this won't do.

897
01:27:50,207 --> 01:27:54,644
My son can't accept such an offer,
no matter how generous...

898
01:27:54,845 --> 01:27:59,339
...unless he knows who's behind it.
- I can't tell you that, sir.

899
01:27:59,549 --> 01:28:02,780
- This is ridiculous!
- What is ridiculous?

900
01:28:02,953 --> 01:28:05,547
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.

901
01:28:05,755 --> 01:28:08,724
People send us gifts all the time.

902
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:11,958
You cannot accept her
without references.

903
01:28:12,128 --> 01:28:14,790
This is none of your business.

904
01:28:15,365 --> 01:28:18,994
- Whoever sent you is going to pay?
- That's right.

905
01:28:19,202 --> 01:28:23,605
Splendid! Now we're going
to let a stranger into our house.

906
01:28:23,773 --> 01:28:26,867
Who is we?
Who is letting who...?

907
01:28:30,647 --> 01:28:33,946
- Could you please wait outside?
- Yes, ma'am.

908
01:28:34,885 --> 01:28:36,079
Look, old man!

909
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:40,813
We spend a fortune on you,
and all you do is criticize.

910
01:28:40,991 --> 01:28:42,185
- And now...
- Stanzi!

911
01:28:42,392 --> 01:28:44,724
No! He should hear!

912
01:28:44,928 --> 01:28:46,953
I'm sick to death of it.

913
01:28:47,163 --> 01:28:50,621
We can't do anything
right for you, can we?

914
01:28:50,834 --> 01:28:54,702
You won't have to do anything
for me ever again.

915
01:28:54,905 --> 01:28:56,372
I'm leaving.

916
01:28:56,573 --> 01:28:59,906
- No, Papa.
- I won't stay and be a burden.

917
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:02,203
No one calls you that.

918
01:29:02,412 --> 01:29:05,677
She does.
She says I sleep all day.

919
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,713
And so you do!

920
01:29:07,984 --> 01:29:11,147
The only time you come out is to eat.

921
01:29:12,422 --> 01:29:14,686
Well, what do you expect?

922
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:21,727
Do you expect anyone to walk out
into a mess like this every day?

923
01:29:21,932 --> 01:29:26,028
- Now I'm a bad housekeeper!
- So you are. It's a pigsty.

924
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:29,163
When can you start?

925
01:29:29,372 --> 01:29:31,499
- Right away, ma'am.
- Good.

926
01:29:58,802 --> 01:30:01,532
They're out every night, sir.

927
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,908
Thank you, sir.

928
01:30:06,576 --> 01:30:09,477
Do any pupils come to the house?

929
01:30:11,748 --> 01:30:13,716
Not that I've seen.

930
01:30:13,883 --> 01:30:16,875
Then how does he pay for all this?

931
01:30:17,754 --> 01:30:20,052
Does he work at all?

932
01:30:20,256 --> 01:30:23,453
Yes, sir. All day long.

933
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,258
He never leaves until evening.

934
01:30:26,463 --> 01:30:29,432
He just sits there,
writing and writing.

935
01:30:29,632 --> 01:30:31,361
Really!

936
01:30:32,769 --> 01:30:35,169
What is he writing?

937
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:40,575
I wouldn't know that, sir.

938
01:30:40,777 --> 01:30:42,574
Of course not.

939
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:44,542
You're a good girl.

940
01:30:44,748 --> 01:30:47,444
You're very kind to do this.

941
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:50,483
Next time you're sure
they'll be out...

942
01:30:50,687 --> 01:30:52,814
...let me know.

943
01:30:59,129 --> 01:31:01,689
Thank you, sir.

944
01:32:41,064 --> 01:32:44,261
I think I found out
about the money, sir.

945
01:32:45,135 --> 01:32:48,002
Yes? What?

946
01:32:48,204 --> 01:32:52,937
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.

947
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:55,341
And now look.

948
01:32:55,712 --> 01:32:57,737
There's only one left.

949
01:32:58,982 --> 01:33:01,507
Where does he work?

950
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:04,616
In there, sir.

951
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,927
I've just heard some news
that may be of interest to you.

952
01:33:55,738 --> 01:33:57,365
What?

953
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:01,806
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.

954
01:34:02,412 --> 01:34:04,642
Italian?

955
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:09,613
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.

956
01:34:10,286 --> 01:34:13,016
The Marriage of Figaro.

957
01:34:13,289 --> 01:34:16,781
He's setting that play to music?

958
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,452
Yes.

959
01:34:19,729 --> 01:34:23,187
What is this Marriage of Figaro?

960
01:34:23,399 --> 01:34:26,857
It's a French play, Kapellmeister.

961
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:30,267
It has been banned by the emperor.

962
01:34:30,473 --> 01:34:32,532
You're absolutely sure?

963
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:41,475
Gentlemen, sit down.

964
01:34:46,322 --> 01:34:48,017
Mozart.

965
01:34:50,026 --> 01:34:53,427
Are you aware that I have
declared Figaro...

966
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:56,190
...unsuitable for our theater?

967
01:34:57,767 --> 01:34:59,394
Yes, sire.

968
01:34:59,802 --> 01:35:04,296
Yet we hear you're making an
opera from it. Is this true?

969
01:35:08,611 --> 01:35:10,579
Who told you this, Majesty?

970
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:15,240
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?

971
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,185
Yes...

972
01:35:18,288 --> 01:35:20,756
I admit it is.

973
01:35:22,659 --> 01:35:25,184
Would you tell me why?

974
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:29,731
Majesty, it is only a comedy.

975
01:35:29,932 --> 01:35:32,730
What you think
is scarcely the point.

976
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:36,666
It's what His Majesty thinks
that counts.

977
01:35:37,006 --> 01:35:38,997
But, Your Majesty...

978
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:41,140
Mozart...

979
01:35:41,344 --> 01:35:43,539
...I am a tolerant man.

980
01:35:43,746 --> 01:35:48,706
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.

981
01:35:49,585 --> 01:35:52,554
Figaro is a bad play.

982
01:35:53,356 --> 01:35:55,916
It stirs up hatred between classes.

983
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:59,094
In France, it has caused
only bitterness.

984
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:04,699
My sister Antoinette is beginning
to be frightened of her own people.

985
01:36:04,867 --> 01:36:08,428
I swear, there's nothing like
that in the piece.

986
01:36:08,705 --> 01:36:13,642
I've taken out everything that could
give offense. I hate politics.

987
01:36:13,843 --> 01:36:16,368
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.

988
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:21,676
In these dangerous times I cannot
afford to provoke our people...

989
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:24,283
...simply over a theater piece.

990
01:36:24,454 --> 01:36:29,391
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
A piece about love.

991
01:36:29,592 --> 01:36:31,685
"Love." Again!

992
01:36:32,228 --> 01:36:33,752
And it's new!

993
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:37,991
It's entirely new.
The people will go mad for it.

994
01:36:38,201 --> 01:36:40,431
I have scenes...

995
01:36:41,237 --> 01:36:43,762
The end of act two, for example.

996
01:36:43,973 --> 01:36:47,568
It starts as a duet.
A husband and wife quarreling.

997
01:36:47,777 --> 01:36:53,306
Suddenly, the scheming maid comes in.
It's a very funny situation.

998
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,347
Duet turns into trio.

999
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:58,385
Then the husband's valet comes in.

1000
01:36:58,588 --> 01:37:00,385
Trio turns into quartet.

1001
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:03,559
Then a gardener.
Quartet becomes quintet.

1002
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,819
And so on, on and on.

1003
01:37:05,995 --> 01:37:08,555
Sextet, septet, octet.

1004
01:37:08,765 --> 01:37:12,360
How long do you think
I can sustain that?

1005
01:37:13,302 --> 01:37:14,826
I have no idea.

1006
01:37:15,004 --> 01:37:16,369
Guess.

1007
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:18,739
Guess, Your Majesty.

1008
01:37:18,941 --> 01:37:21,933
Imagine the longest
it could be sustained...

1009
01:37:22,111 --> 01:37:23,874
...then double it.

1010
01:37:24,847 --> 01:37:26,337
Well...

1011
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,450
Six...

1012
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:32,354
...seven minutes?

1013
01:37:35,258 --> 01:37:39,695
- Eight minutes?
- Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes!

1014
01:37:39,862 --> 01:37:43,889
Twenty minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!

1015
01:37:44,767 --> 01:37:47,065
Sire, only opera can do this.

1016
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:51,172
In a play, if more than one person
speaks at once...

1017
01:37:51,374 --> 01:37:53,399
...it's just noise.

1018
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:56,101
But with opera, with music...

1019
01:37:56,312 --> 01:38:00,339
...you can have 20 individuals
all talking at the same time.

1020
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:03,713
It's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony!

1021
01:38:04,287 --> 01:38:07,313
Mozart, music is not the issue here.

1022
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:12,723
No one doubts your talent. It's your
literary judgment that's in question.

1023
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:19,061
Even with the politics taken out of it,
it would still remain a vulgar farce.

1024
01:38:19,235 --> 01:38:21,829
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

1025
01:38:22,038 --> 01:38:26,168
Surely you can choose more
elevated themes.

1026
01:38:26,542 --> 01:38:29,705
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?

1027
01:38:29,912 --> 01:38:33,643
I am fed to the teeth
with these...

1028
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:37,342
...elevated things.
Old dead legends.

1029
01:38:37,553 --> 01:38:41,284
Why must we go on forever
writing of gods and legends?

1030
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:43,584
Because they do.

1031
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:46,693
They go on forever.

1032
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:51,365
At least what they represent:
The eternal in us.

1033
01:38:51,567 --> 01:38:54,365
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.

1034
01:38:54,537 --> 01:38:57,700
You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.

1035
01:39:01,944 --> 01:39:06,108
"Bello, bello, bello."
Come on now, be honest!

1036
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:10,613
You'd rather listen to your
hairdressers than Hercules.

1037
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,617
Or Horatius, or Orpheus.

1038
01:39:12,788 --> 01:39:16,224
So lofty, they sound
as if they shit marble!

1039
01:39:17,627 --> 01:39:19,288
What!

1040
01:39:19,729 --> 01:39:23,756
Govern your tongue, Mozart!
How dare you!

1041
01:39:28,271 --> 01:39:31,069
Forgive me, Majesty.

1042
01:39:32,275 --> 01:39:34,766
I'm a vulgar man...

1043
01:39:34,977 --> 01:39:38,174
...but I assure you,
my music is not.

1044
01:39:41,751 --> 01:39:45,016
You are passionate, Mozart...

1045
01:39:45,221 --> 01:39:50,124
...but you do not persuade.

1046
01:39:51,594 --> 01:39:55,530
Sire, the whole opera is finished.

1047
01:39:55,765 --> 01:39:58,495
Do you know how much work
went into it?

1048
01:39:59,268 --> 01:40:05,264
His Majesty has been
more than patient, signore.

1049
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:11,976
- How can I persuade Your Majesty?
- That will do, Herr Mozart.

1050
01:40:14,216 --> 01:40:17,083
Just let me tell how it begins.

1051
01:40:17,253 --> 01:40:18,618
May I just do that?

1052
01:40:18,788 --> 01:40:21,655
Show how it begins?
Just that?

1053
01:40:27,096 --> 01:40:28,085
Please.

1054
01:40:28,931 --> 01:40:30,831
Look...

1055
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:34,599
There's a servant on his knees.
Do you know why?

1056
01:40:34,804 --> 01:40:38,205
Not from oppression.
He's measuring a space.

1057
01:40:38,374 --> 01:40:40,433
Do you know what for?

1058
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:43,306
His bed. His wedding bed.

1059
01:40:43,512 --> 01:40:45,673
To see if it will fit!

1060
01:40:54,657 --> 01:40:55,646
Late.

1061
01:40:58,361 --> 01:40:59,453
Late!

1062
01:41:00,062 --> 01:41:01,620
On the beat.

1063
01:41:01,831 --> 01:41:02,923
Good!

1064
01:41:05,635 --> 01:41:07,193
Yes!

1065
01:41:13,709 --> 01:41:15,267
Early!

1066
01:41:19,615 --> 01:41:23,415
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.

1067
01:41:28,491 --> 01:41:31,483
In that case, gentlemen, I think...

1068
01:41:35,865 --> 01:41:38,857
I think we should
help Mozart all we can.

1069
01:41:42,471 --> 01:41:45,565
And protect him against
the emperor's anger.

1070
01:41:45,775 --> 01:41:47,003
What anger?

1071
01:41:47,843 --> 01:41:49,970
About the ballet.

1072
01:41:50,746 --> 01:41:53,078
What ballet?

1073
01:41:53,582 --> 01:41:55,777
Excuse me, but...

1074
01:41:55,985 --> 01:41:59,546
...didn't His Majesty specifically...

1075
01:41:59,755 --> 01:42:02,223
...forbid the ballet at his opera?

1076
01:42:38,294 --> 01:42:40,660
- Herr Mozart!
- Yes?

1077
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:42,125
A word with you.

1078
01:42:42,331 --> 01:42:43,958
Certainly, Herr Direktor.

1079
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:46,134
Now, Herr Mozart!

1080
01:42:47,336 --> 01:42:50,737
Five minutes, please.

1081
01:42:52,141 --> 01:42:53,233
Yes?

1082
01:42:53,442 --> 01:42:59,074
Do you not know that His Majesty has
expressly forbidden ballet in operas?

1083
01:42:59,281 --> 01:43:01,681
It's not a ballet, it's a dance.

1084
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:04,409
Exactly. A dance.

1085
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:09,182
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean
no dancing when it's in the story.

1086
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:14,385
It's dangerous to interpret his
edicts. Give me your score, please.

1087
01:43:23,873 --> 01:43:25,568
Thank you.

1088
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:31,770
What are you doing, Herr Direktor?

1089
01:43:31,981 --> 01:43:35,644
Taking out what you should
never have put in.

1090
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:39,711
Please. Please!

1091
01:43:39,922 --> 01:43:41,981
I have no one else to turn to.

1092
01:43:42,191 --> 01:43:45,024
- What is it?
- It's unbelievable.

1093
01:43:45,327 --> 01:43:49,457
The direktor has actually torn up
a huge section of my music.

1094
01:43:49,665 --> 01:43:52,463
They say I have to rewrite the opera.

1095
01:43:53,536 --> 01:43:55,800
But it's perfect as it is.

1096
01:43:56,272 --> 01:43:57,534
I can't...

1097
01:43:57,740 --> 01:44:00,265
...rewrite what's perfect.

1098
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:03,476
Please.

1099
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:05,476
Can't you talk to him?

1100
01:44:06,515 --> 01:44:07,914
Please.

1101
01:44:08,117 --> 01:44:10,847
Why bother? He's no friend of yours.

1102
01:44:11,053 --> 01:44:14,819
I could kill him!
I mean, really! Kill him!

1103
01:44:16,759 --> 01:44:20,627
I threw the score into
the fire, he made me so angry.

1104
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:22,195
You burned it?

1105
01:44:22,398 --> 01:44:26,391
No, my wife took it out in time.

1106
01:44:28,137 --> 01:44:29,399
Thank God.

1107
01:44:31,106 --> 01:44:35,566
It's unfair that a man like that
should have power over our work!

1108
01:44:37,479 --> 01:44:40,505
But there are those who
have power over him.

1109
01:44:42,618 --> 01:44:45,917
I think I'll take this up
with the emperor.

1110
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:49,381
Excellency...

1111
01:44:49,592 --> 01:44:50,752
...would you?

1112
01:44:52,461 --> 01:44:55,259
With all my heart, Mozart.

1113
01:44:56,365 --> 01:44:58,890
Thank you.

1114
01:44:59,101 --> 01:45:03,435
Please, Herr Mozart.
"Please, it's not a holy relic."

1115
01:45:06,242 --> 01:45:10,838
I don't need to tell you I said
nothing, whatever, to the emperor.

1116
01:45:11,046 --> 01:45:15,915
I went to the theater to tell
Mozart something, anything...

1117
01:45:17,419 --> 01:45:19,182
...when suddenly...

1118
01:45:20,122 --> 01:45:22,181
...in the middle of the third act...

1119
01:45:22,391 --> 01:45:25,554
...to my astonishment, the emperor...

1120
01:45:25,761 --> 01:45:30,255
...who never attended
rehearsals, suddenly appeared.

1121
01:45:49,018 --> 01:45:51,145
What is this?

1122
01:45:53,622 --> 01:45:55,590
I don't understand.

1123
01:45:56,625 --> 01:45:58,092
Is it modern?

1124
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:00,790
Majesty...

1125
01:46:00,996 --> 01:46:02,759
...the Herr Direktor...

1126
01:46:02,965 --> 01:46:05,900
...he has removed un balletto...

1127
01:46:06,101 --> 01:46:10,561
...that would have occurred
at this place.

1128
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:12,973
Why?

1129
01:46:13,309 --> 01:46:15,209
It's your regulation, sire.

1130
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:18,539
No ballet in your opera.

1131
01:46:24,486 --> 01:46:25,544
Salieri.

1132
01:46:27,823 --> 01:46:29,347
Do you like this?

1133
01:46:31,727 --> 01:46:35,493
It's not a question
of liking, Majesty.

1134
01:46:35,698 --> 01:46:38,758
Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

1135
01:46:40,536 --> 01:46:42,766
Well, look at them!

1136
01:46:44,907 --> 01:46:48,104
No! This is nonsense!

1137
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:52,041
- Let me see the scene with the music.
- But, sire!

1138
01:46:52,614 --> 01:46:54,047
Oblige me!

1139
01:46:54,249 --> 01:46:56,274
Yes, Majesty.

1140
01:47:05,527 --> 01:47:08,621
Can we see the scene
with the music, please?

1141
01:47:08,831 --> 01:47:09,820
Certainly!

1142
01:47:10,032 --> 01:47:12,159
Certainly, Herr Direktor!

1143
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,631
Bring the palace set back in, please.

1144
01:47:58,614 --> 01:48:00,309
The restored third act...

1145
01:48:00,516 --> 01:48:02,984
...was bold, brilliant.

1146
01:48:03,786 --> 01:48:05,777
The fourth...

1147
01:48:08,223 --> 01:48:10,214
...was astounding.

1148
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:19,731
I saw a woman...

1149
01:48:19,935 --> 01:48:23,098
...disguised in her maid's clothes...

1150
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:25,769
...hear her husband speak the first...

1151
01:48:25,974 --> 01:48:29,273
...tender words he's
offered her in years.

1152
01:48:29,478 --> 01:48:33,812
Simply because he thinks
she is someone else.

1153
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:40,115
I heard the music of true
forgiveness filling the theater...

1154
01:48:40,656 --> 01:48:45,150
...conferring on all who
sat there, perfect absolution.

1155
01:48:45,828 --> 01:48:49,059
God was singing through
this little man...

1156
01:48:49,264 --> 01:48:51,494
...to all the world.

1157
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,368
Unstoppable.

1158
01:48:54,636 --> 01:49:00,006
Making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar.

1159
01:49:38,213 --> 01:49:40,977
And then,
do you know what happened?

1160
01:49:44,286 --> 01:49:45,719
A miracle!

1161
01:49:52,928 --> 01:49:54,190
With that yawn...

1162
01:49:54,596 --> 01:49:58,589
...I saw my defeat
turn into a victory.

1163
01:50:03,005 --> 01:50:06,133
Mozart was lucky
the emperor yawned only once.

1164
01:50:06,341 --> 01:50:07,831
Three yawns...

1165
01:50:08,043 --> 01:50:10,807
...and the opera would
fail the same night.

1166
01:50:11,013 --> 01:50:14,642
Two yawns within a week at most.

1167
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:19,753
With one yawn, the composer
could still get...

1168
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:24,926
Nine performances!
That's all it's had! Withdrawn!

1169
01:50:26,428 --> 01:50:28,828
I know, I know.

1170
01:50:29,031 --> 01:50:30,828
It's outrageous.

1171
01:50:32,401 --> 01:50:36,337
Still, if the public
doesn't like one's work...

1172
01:50:36,538 --> 01:50:39,098
...one has to accept
the fact gracefully.

1173
01:50:39,308 --> 01:50:42,106
But what is it they don't like?

1174
01:50:43,078 --> 01:50:45,273
I can speak for the emperor.

1175
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:48,608
You make too many demands
on the royal ear.

1176
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:53,753
He can't concentrate for more than
an hour. You gave him four.

1177
01:50:59,528 --> 01:51:02,053
What did you think of it yourself?

1178
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:04,465
Did you like it at all?

1179
01:51:06,602 --> 01:51:08,661
I thought it was marvelous.

1180
01:51:09,504 --> 01:51:13,099
Of course.
It's the best opera yet written.

1181
01:51:13,442 --> 01:51:14,966
I know it!

1182
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,638
Why didn't they come?

1183
01:51:22,451 --> 01:51:26,182
I think you overestimate
our dear Viennese, my friend.

1184
01:51:26,388 --> 01:51:29,619
You didn't give them
a bang at the end of songs...

1185
01:51:29,825 --> 01:51:32,259
...to let them know when to clap.

1186
01:51:33,328 --> 01:51:35,523
I know.

1187
01:51:35,931 --> 01:51:38,729
You should give me lessons in that.

1188
01:51:40,535 --> 01:51:41,832
I wouldn't presume.

1189
01:51:46,174 --> 01:51:49,166
Nevertheless,
at the risk of imposing...

1190
01:51:49,378 --> 01:51:51,903
...l'd like you
to see my new piece.

1191
01:51:53,682 --> 01:51:55,843
It would be an honor for me.

1192
01:51:56,184 --> 01:51:58,709
No, the honor would be all mine.

1193
01:53:24,906 --> 01:53:26,533
I believe...

1194
01:53:27,976 --> 01:53:29,671
I believe...

1195
01:53:29,945 --> 01:53:33,938
...it is the best opera
yet written, my friends.

1196
01:53:35,951 --> 01:53:37,612
Salieri!

1197
01:53:39,054 --> 01:53:40,851
You are the brightest star...

1198
01:53:41,056 --> 01:53:42,819
...in the musical firmament.

1199
01:53:43,024 --> 01:53:44,582
You do honor to Vienna...

1200
01:53:45,227 --> 01:53:46,819
...and to me.

1201
01:54:13,588 --> 01:54:14,816
Herr Mozart!

1202
01:54:15,824 --> 01:54:18,884
- It was good of you to come.
- How could I not?

1203
01:54:19,094 --> 01:54:20,857
Bravo, maestro.

1204
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:23,993
Did my work please you?

1205
01:54:26,468 --> 01:54:30,427
I never knew that music
like that was possible.

1206
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:34,336
- You flatter me.
- No.

1207
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:37,643
One hears such sounds and...

1208
01:54:37,846 --> 01:54:40,110
...what can one say but:

1209
01:54:40,315 --> 01:54:41,304
Salieri!

1210
01:54:48,623 --> 01:54:52,024
Everybody's here and we've got guests.

1211
01:54:52,227 --> 01:54:54,252
Bravo! I've got some more.

1212
01:54:54,463 --> 01:54:57,796
You remember my good
friend Schikaneder. Come in.

1213
01:54:57,999 --> 01:54:59,557
Come in! Don't be shy.

1214
01:54:59,768 --> 01:55:04,137
- This is a very nice girl, and this...
- Wolfie?

1215
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:07,165
Yes, my love?

1216
01:55:07,776 --> 01:55:09,869
These men are from Salzburg.

1217
01:55:10,145 --> 01:55:11,203
Salzburg?

1218
01:55:12,481 --> 01:55:15,314
We were just talking about Salzburg.

1219
01:55:17,652 --> 01:55:20,177
Your father is dead.

1220
01:55:42,577 --> 01:55:47,207
So rose the dreadful ghost,
from his next...

1221
01:55:47,415 --> 01:55:49,747
...and blackest opera.

1222
01:55:55,257 --> 01:55:59,421
There on the stage,
stood the figure of a dead commander.

1223
01:55:59,628 --> 01:56:01,255
And I knew...

1224
01:56:01,463 --> 01:56:03,192
...only I understood...

1225
01:56:03,598 --> 01:56:06,692
...that the horrifying apparition
was Leopold...

1226
01:56:06,902 --> 01:56:08,597
...raised from the dead!

1227
01:56:38,133 --> 01:56:42,001
Wolfgang had actually
summoned up his own father...

1228
01:56:42,203 --> 01:56:46,105
...to accuse his son
before all the world!

1229
01:56:47,442 --> 01:56:49,342
It was...

1230
01:56:49,544 --> 01:56:52,911
...terrifying and wonderful to watch.

1231
01:57:57,078 --> 01:57:58,545
And now...

1232
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:07,054
...the madness began in me.

1233
01:58:09,424 --> 01:58:12,985
The madness of a man
splitting in half.

1234
01:58:16,498 --> 01:58:18,966
Through my influence, I saw to it...

1235
01:58:19,167 --> 01:58:22,568
...Don Giovanni was played
only five times in Vienna.

1236
01:58:23,204 --> 01:58:27,766
But, in secret,
I went to every one of those five.

1237
01:58:28,343 --> 01:58:33,212
Worshiping sound
I alone seemed to hear.

1238
01:59:19,894 --> 01:59:23,352
And as I stood there,
understanding how that...

1239
01:59:23,565 --> 01:59:27,160
...bitter old man still
possessed his poor son...

1240
01:59:27,368 --> 01:59:30,030
...even from beyond the grave...

1241
01:59:30,238 --> 01:59:32,172
...I began to see a way...

1242
01:59:32,373 --> 01:59:34,204
...a terrible way...

1243
01:59:34,409 --> 01:59:36,877
...I could finally triumph...

1244
01:59:37,545 --> 01:59:39,376
...over God.

1245
02:02:49,908 --> 02:02:51,603
Herr Mozart?

1246
02:02:54,546 --> 02:02:57,276
I have come to commission
work from you.

1247
02:02:59,084 --> 02:03:03,418
- What work?
- A Mass for the dead.

1248
02:03:03,688 --> 02:03:05,019
What dead?

1249
02:03:06,291 --> 02:03:08,088
Who is dead?

1250
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:12,797
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass,
and never got one.

1251
02:03:13,331 --> 02:03:16,630
- Who are you?
- I am only a messenger.

1252
02:03:17,035 --> 02:03:18,593
Do you accept?

1253
02:03:19,471 --> 02:03:21,462
You will be well paid.

1254
02:03:29,414 --> 02:03:31,177
Do you accept?

1255
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:43,759
Work fast.

1256
02:03:43,962 --> 02:03:46,522
And be sure to tell no one
what you do.

1257
02:03:46,932 --> 02:03:49,025
You will see me again soon.

1258
02:04:25,837 --> 02:04:27,304
Wolfie?

1259
02:04:38,483 --> 02:04:42,419
My plan was so simple...

1260
02:04:42,621 --> 02:04:44,612
...that it terrified me.

1261
02:04:47,025 --> 02:04:50,483
First, I must get the death Mass,
and then...

1262
02:04:53,031 --> 02:04:55,329
...I must achieve his death.

1263
02:04:57,469 --> 02:04:58,902
What?

1264
02:04:59,905 --> 02:05:02,032
His funeral!

1265
02:05:03,041 --> 02:05:05,839
Lmagine it! The cathedral...

1266
02:05:06,044 --> 02:05:08,911
...all Vienna sitting there.
His coffin...

1267
02:05:09,114 --> 02:05:12,982
...Mozart's little coffin
in the middle.

1268
02:05:13,785 --> 02:05:15,412
And then...

1269
02:05:16,087 --> 02:05:18,351
...in that silence...

1270
02:05:20,525 --> 02:05:22,459
...music.

1271
02:05:23,762 --> 02:05:26,026
A divine music...

1272
02:05:26,231 --> 02:05:29,200
...bursts out over them all.

1273
02:05:29,801 --> 02:05:33,498
A great Mass of death.

1274
02:05:34,839 --> 02:05:38,775
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.

1275
02:05:39,010 --> 02:05:43,208
Composed by his devoted friend...

1276
02:05:43,648 --> 02:05:46,412
...Antonio Salieri.

1277
02:05:47,319 --> 02:05:48,843
What sublimity!

1278
02:05:49,054 --> 02:05:51,887
What depth!

1279
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:54,923
What passion in the music!

1280
02:05:55,894 --> 02:05:59,762
Salieri has been
touched by God at last...

1281
02:05:59,965 --> 02:06:02,627
...and God forced to listen!

1282
02:06:04,102 --> 02:06:07,629
Powerless to stop it!

1283
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:11,273
I, for once, in the end,
laughing at him!

1284
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:23,050
The only thing that worried me
was the actual killing.

1285
02:06:23,254 --> 02:06:25,051
How does one do that?

1286
02:06:26,391 --> 02:06:28,689
How does one kill a man?

1287
02:06:30,395 --> 02:06:32,386
It's one thing to...

1288
02:06:32,597 --> 02:06:34,531
...dream about it.

1289
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:38,363
Very different when you...

1290
02:06:40,739 --> 02:06:42,798
...when you have to do it...

1291
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:48,110
...with your own hands.

1292
02:06:57,656 --> 02:07:00,454
Come in!

1293
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:20,604
I've come to dinner

1294
02:07:21,046 --> 02:07:23,537
Dinner! Are you mad?
I'm a nobleman!

1295
02:07:23,748 --> 02:07:27,184
I only ever dine with
people of my own height!

1296
02:07:27,385 --> 02:07:29,182
Stop it!

1297
02:07:30,021 --> 02:07:31,579
Be careful
Be careful

1298
02:07:31,790 --> 02:07:35,123
Hold tight

1299
02:07:35,593 --> 02:07:38,118
I'm a famous...

1300
02:07:38,329 --> 02:07:40,854
...horseman

1301
02:07:41,066 --> 02:07:45,332
And we're a famous horsy

1302
02:07:47,372 --> 02:07:51,365
Give me a hoof, my darling

1303
02:07:51,576 --> 02:07:56,741
And I'll give you my heart

1304
02:07:56,948 --> 02:08:01,442
Take me to your stable

1305
02:08:01,653 --> 02:08:04,986
And never more we'll part

1306
02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:15,090
Kill me
Kill me

1307
02:08:36,421 --> 02:08:42,223
We're going to make a soprano stew

1308
02:08:46,364 --> 02:08:49,492
And when you make a soprano stew

1309
02:08:49,701 --> 02:08:52,169
Shut up!

1310
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:55,100
I'm sick to death of that tune!

1311
02:09:14,025 --> 02:09:17,620
Give him some hay, my darling

1312
02:09:17,829 --> 02:09:21,424
And I'll give you my heart

1313
02:09:21,633 --> 02:09:23,828
Leporello! Some hay!

1314
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:21,215
We hope
You're contented

1315
02:10:22,493 --> 02:10:29,490
With what
We've presented

1316
02:10:30,335 --> 02:10:37,002
And love our dove of peace

1317
02:11:02,233 --> 02:11:03,359
What did you think?

1318
02:11:03,735 --> 02:11:04,827
Wonderful!

1319
02:11:05,103 --> 02:11:07,071
He liked the little people.

1320
02:11:07,272 --> 02:11:09,172
It's all in good fun.

1321
02:11:10,575 --> 02:11:12,566
I liked the horse.

1322
02:11:23,821 --> 02:11:27,257
I tell you, if you played
Don Giovanni here...

1323
02:11:27,792 --> 02:11:30,761
...you would have had
a wonderful success.

1324
02:11:30,962 --> 02:11:33,055
You belong here.

1325
02:11:33,264 --> 02:11:36,825
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.

1326
02:11:37,068 --> 02:11:41,471
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want, fantasy.

1327
02:11:42,206 --> 02:11:43,571
You write...

1328
02:11:43,775 --> 02:11:48,041
...a proper part for me.
A couple of catchy songs...

1329
02:11:48,246 --> 02:11:52,649
...I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!

1330
02:11:53,318 --> 02:11:56,014
- What do you say?
- How much will you pay him?

1331
02:11:59,457 --> 02:12:02,915
Well! I see you brought
your manager with you.

1332
02:12:04,762 --> 02:12:06,889
Well, madame...

1333
02:12:07,098 --> 02:12:08,429
...how about...

1334
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,297
...half the receipts?

1335
02:12:10,735 --> 02:12:12,168
Half the receipts!

1336
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:15,038
- Stanzi!
- I'm talking about now.

1337
02:12:15,239 --> 02:12:18,436
How much will you pay him now?
Down payment.

1338
02:12:18,643 --> 02:12:20,508
Down payment?

1339
02:12:21,813 --> 02:12:25,078
Who do you think I am, the emperor?

1340
02:12:26,184 --> 02:12:27,583
I have to go.

1341
02:12:27,919 --> 02:12:30,945
Stay, you'll enjoy this next one.

1342
02:12:32,824 --> 02:12:33,984
You won't do this.

1343
02:12:34,258 --> 02:12:35,953
- Why? Half the house!
- When?

1344
02:12:36,294 --> 02:12:40,754
We need money now! He pays
you now, or you don't do it.

1345
02:12:41,299 --> 02:12:42,789
I don't trust him.

1346
02:12:42,967 --> 02:12:46,232
I don't like what he did
to your opera. It was common.

1347
02:12:46,404 --> 02:12:47,598
You liked it.

1348
02:12:48,006 --> 02:12:49,667
Monkey, punky, flunky!

1349
02:12:50,041 --> 02:12:51,269
Half the house.

1350
02:12:51,609 --> 02:12:55,875
We'll never see a penny.
I want it here in my hand.

1351
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:58,241
I'll put it here in your hand.

1352
02:12:58,683 --> 02:12:59,741
Shut up!

1353
02:12:59,951 --> 02:13:03,717
You won't put a thing in my hand
until I see some money!

1354
02:13:03,888 --> 02:13:04,820
It's embarrassing.

1355
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:09,687
Can you think of anyone
who can do something for him?

1356
02:13:10,495 --> 02:13:14,090
I'm afraid Mozart is
a lost cause, baron.

1357
02:13:14,966 --> 02:13:19,403
He has succeeded in alienating
practically all of Vienna.

1358
02:13:19,604 --> 02:13:21,265
He never pays his debts.

1359
02:13:21,773 --> 02:13:25,539
I can't think of anyone
to whom I'd dare recommend him.

1360
02:13:25,743 --> 02:13:29,702
Herr Mozart. What a surprise!

1361
02:13:31,249 --> 02:13:33,479
What can I do for you?

1362
02:13:34,819 --> 02:13:39,256
Is my pupil still interested
in learning the art of music?

1363
02:13:40,825 --> 02:13:45,592
Your pupil is married and
living in Manheim, young man.

1364
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:47,822
Really?

1365
02:13:53,471 --> 02:13:55,200
Perhaps your...

1366
02:13:55,506 --> 02:13:59,067
...dear wife might care to
profit from my instruction.

1367
02:13:59,544 --> 02:14:01,774
What is it, Mozart?

1368
02:14:02,113 --> 02:14:04,343
What's the matter with you?

1369
02:14:04,849 --> 02:14:06,407
Well, since...

1370
02:14:06,684 --> 02:14:10,848
...it appears no one is eager
to hire my services...

1371
02:14:11,823 --> 02:14:15,281
...could you favor me with
a little money instead?

1372
02:14:18,696 --> 02:14:19,993
What for?

1373
02:14:21,532 --> 02:14:25,127
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

1374
02:14:29,073 --> 02:14:31,940
That's hardly the way to go about it.

1375
02:14:33,010 --> 02:14:36,446
You are right, sir. You are right.

1376
02:14:36,647 --> 02:14:41,016
But you see, I am endowed with
talent, and you with money.

1377
02:14:41,219 --> 02:14:43,016
If I offer mine...

1378
02:14:43,387 --> 02:14:45,753
...you should offer yours.

1379
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:51,524
I'm sorry, no.

1380
02:14:54,265 --> 02:14:55,755
Please.

1381
02:14:57,768 --> 02:15:00,362
My answer is no, Mozart.

1382
02:15:06,611 --> 02:15:08,511
Please.

1383
02:15:12,717 --> 02:15:14,878
Please!

1384
02:15:51,689 --> 02:15:53,122
Don't answer it.

1385
02:15:55,726 --> 02:15:57,091
Why?

1386
02:15:59,664 --> 02:16:01,359
Tell him...

1387
02:16:02,667 --> 02:16:04,692
Tell him I'm not here.

1388
02:16:08,005 --> 02:16:10,405
Tell him I'm working on it.

1389
02:16:11,576 --> 02:16:13,441
Come back later.

1390
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:31,760
Am I interrupting something?

1391
02:16:31,963 --> 02:16:33,931
- No.
- Good.

1392
02:16:34,432 --> 02:16:35,956
Where's our friend?

1393
02:16:36,167 --> 02:16:37,998
He's not here.

1394
02:16:38,369 --> 02:16:42,203
But he's working on it,
he told me to tell you.

1395
02:16:42,974 --> 02:16:44,635
Is that it?

1396
02:16:50,848 --> 02:16:53,214
Is he happy with it?

1397
02:16:56,354 --> 02:16:59,380
What's this? A Requiem Mass?

1398
02:16:59,590 --> 02:17:02,081
You think I'm in the funeral business?

1399
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:03,727
Put it down!

1400
02:17:03,928 --> 02:17:05,418
It's not for you!

1401
02:17:05,863 --> 02:17:07,091
I'm sorry.

1402
02:17:09,133 --> 02:17:10,828
What have you got for me?

1403
02:17:11,736 --> 02:17:13,294
Finished?

1404
02:17:14,705 --> 02:17:19,335
- What?
- The vaudeville, what do you think?

1405
02:17:20,111 --> 02:17:21,100
Yes.

1406
02:17:21,812 --> 02:17:23,404
Can I see it?

1407
02:17:23,614 --> 02:17:25,172
No.

1408
02:17:25,516 --> 02:17:27,245
Why not?

1409
02:17:27,451 --> 02:17:30,045
Because there's nothing to see.

1410
02:17:38,362 --> 02:17:39,954
Look...

1411
02:17:40,931 --> 02:17:46,927
...I asked you if we could start
rehearsals next week and you said yes.

1412
02:17:48,205 --> 02:17:52,471
- We can.
- So let me see it. Where is it?

1413
02:17:53,477 --> 02:17:54,466
Here.

1414
02:17:56,113 --> 02:17:58,513
It's all right here in my noodle.

1415
02:17:58,749 --> 02:18:01,616
The rest is just scribbling.

1416
02:18:01,919 --> 02:18:05,480
Scribbling and bibbling,
bibbling and scribbling.

1417
02:18:08,426 --> 02:18:11,020
- Like a drink?
- Look, you little cunt!

1418
02:18:11,228 --> 02:18:13,560
Do you know how many
people I've hired?

1419
02:18:13,764 --> 02:18:14,628
Leave him alone!

1420
02:18:14,899 --> 02:18:16,423
I'm paying these people!

1421
02:18:16,634 --> 02:18:17,760
He's doing his best.

1422
02:18:17,968 --> 02:18:20,937
I'm paying them to wait.
It's ridiculous!

1423
02:18:21,138 --> 02:18:25,234
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto!

1424
02:18:25,443 --> 02:18:28,276
Only an idiot would ask Wolfie
to work on that!

1425
02:18:28,479 --> 02:18:30,743
Twelve-foot snakes, magic flutes?

1426
02:18:31,148 --> 02:18:33,708
What's so intelligent about a Requiem?

1427
02:18:33,918 --> 02:18:36,352
Money. Money.

1428
02:18:40,057 --> 02:18:41,922
You're mad.

1429
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:44,025
She's mad.

1430
02:18:44,395 --> 02:18:48,559
- Oh, yes?
- Wolfie, write it down.

1431
02:18:48,766 --> 02:18:50,700
Just write it down.

1432
02:18:50,901 --> 02:18:52,892
On paper.

1433
02:18:53,204 --> 02:18:56,332
It's no use to anybody in your head.

1434
02:18:56,507 --> 02:19:00,034
To hell with your death Mass!

1435
02:19:01,045 --> 02:19:03,775
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?

1436
02:19:04,081 --> 02:19:06,015
I won't work there anymore.

1437
02:19:06,217 --> 02:19:07,445
What happened?

1438
02:19:08,652 --> 02:19:11,382
You don't know what it's like.

1439
02:19:11,889 --> 02:19:14,915
Herr Mozart frightens me.

1440
02:19:15,159 --> 02:19:17,059
He drinks all day...

1441
02:19:17,495 --> 02:19:20,862
...then takes all that medicine
and it makes him worse.

1442
02:19:21,065 --> 02:19:22,532
Is he working?

1443
02:19:24,368 --> 02:19:27,098
Oh, I am frightened, sir, really!

1444
02:19:27,872 --> 02:19:31,399
- When he speaks, he makes no sense.
- Is he working?

1445
02:19:34,512 --> 02:19:36,309
I suppose so.

1446
02:19:37,248 --> 02:19:41,446
He sits there all the time,
doing some silly opera.

1447
02:19:41,786 --> 02:19:42,775
Opera?

1448
02:19:42,987 --> 02:19:45,285
Don't ask me to go back again.

1449
02:19:45,489 --> 02:19:48,720
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!

1450
02:19:48,926 --> 02:19:51,986
Are you sure it's an opera?

1451
02:21:35,733 --> 02:21:38,065
I don't have it yet.

1452
02:21:38,869 --> 02:21:41,997
Are you neglecting my request?

1453
02:21:42,673 --> 02:21:45,801
No. No, I...

1454
02:21:46,644 --> 02:21:48,635
I promise you...

1455
02:21:49,146 --> 02:21:52,343
...l'll give you a wonderful
piece, the best I ever...

1456
02:21:56,854 --> 02:21:59,652
This is my wife, Stanzi.

1457
02:22:00,758 --> 02:22:04,091
I've been sick,
but I'm all right now, aren't I?

1458
02:22:04,295 --> 02:22:05,990
Yes, sir.
He's all right.

1459
02:22:06,730 --> 02:22:09,893
And he's working on it very hard.

1460
02:22:11,235 --> 02:22:14,500
Give me two more weeks. Please.

1461
02:22:15,205 --> 02:22:17,230
The sooner you finish...

1462
02:22:17,441 --> 02:22:21,241
...the greater your reward. Work.

1463
02:22:30,588 --> 02:22:32,112
Wolfie.

1464
02:22:34,425 --> 02:22:37,223
I think you really are going mad.

1465
02:22:39,263 --> 02:22:43,393
You slave for that actor
who won't give you a penny!

1466
02:22:43,601 --> 02:22:44,898
And here...

1467
02:22:45,102 --> 02:22:46,660
This is not a ghost!

1468
02:22:46,870 --> 02:22:51,170
This is a real man,
who puts down real money.

1469
02:22:52,910 --> 02:22:56,004
Why on earth won't you finish it?

1470
02:22:56,880 --> 02:23:00,680
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?

1471
02:23:02,720 --> 02:23:04,551
It's killing me.

1472
02:23:08,759 --> 02:23:11,250
You're drunk, aren't you?

1473
02:23:11,562 --> 02:23:14,395
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.

1474
02:23:16,967 --> 02:23:21,870
It's not fair. I worry about you
all the time.

1475
02:23:22,306 --> 02:23:25,707
I do everything I can to help you.

1476
02:23:25,943 --> 02:23:30,312
And all you do is drink and
talk nonsense, and frighten me.

1477
02:23:30,547 --> 02:23:32,879
Go back to bed!

1478
02:23:42,292 --> 02:23:43,657
Please.

1479
02:23:45,029 --> 02:23:48,726
Let me...
Let me sit here.

1480
02:23:51,902 --> 02:23:53,961
Let me stay here with you.

1481
02:26:27,524 --> 02:26:30,391
I did it!
And I was proud to do it.

1482
02:26:30,594 --> 02:26:31,959
"Leave!" I said.

1483
02:26:32,229 --> 02:26:35,528
"Take the child with you!
Go to the spa...

1484
02:26:35,732 --> 02:26:38,929
...and get your health back."
I was shocked.

1485
02:26:39,436 --> 02:26:41,904
Shocked to my foundation
when I saw her.

1486
02:26:42,172 --> 02:26:44,936
I couldn't believe my eyes,
poor little thing.

1487
02:26:45,509 --> 02:26:49,411
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?

1488
02:26:49,613 --> 02:26:52,343
You and your music. I warned her.

1489
02:26:52,549 --> 02:26:55,040
"Choose a man, not a baby," I said.

1490
02:26:55,619 --> 02:27:00,784
"You marry him, you won't have a pot
to piss in." You selfish thing!

1491
02:27:00,991 --> 02:27:02,788
Selfish, that's what you are.

1492
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:05,494
Simply selfish! Do you hear me?

1493
02:30:48,985 --> 02:30:50,282
Pick him up.

1494
02:30:50,487 --> 02:30:51,954
Pick him up!

1495
02:30:54,291 --> 02:30:56,521
Be careful! Come with me!

1496
02:30:56,927 --> 02:30:58,519
You, follow me.

1497
02:31:26,123 --> 02:31:29,024
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over. It's over.

1498
02:31:31,661 --> 02:31:32,685
Go!

1499
02:32:14,738 --> 02:32:15,966
Go, go. Go.

1500
02:32:17,474 --> 02:32:18,736
Go! Go!

1501
02:32:48,305 --> 02:32:49,966
Where is your wife?

1502
02:32:53,410 --> 02:32:55,640
Where is your wife?

1503
02:32:58,181 --> 02:33:02,345
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.

1504
02:33:03,753 --> 02:33:06,017
You are so good to me.

1505
02:33:06,590 --> 02:33:09,354
Truly. Thank you.

1506
02:33:10,093 --> 02:33:11,424
Please!

1507
02:33:12,596 --> 02:33:16,430
No, I mean to come to my opera.

1508
02:33:16,833 --> 02:33:21,930
You... You are the only colleague
of mine who came.

1509
02:33:24,874 --> 02:33:26,364
Mozart.

1510
02:33:27,877 --> 02:33:31,574
I would never miss anything
you had written.

1511
02:33:32,182 --> 02:33:35,481
- It's just a vaudeville.
- No, no!

1512
02:33:35,819 --> 02:33:37,753
It's a sublime piece.

1513
02:33:38,955 --> 02:33:41,116
The grandest operone!

1514
02:33:50,233 --> 02:33:52,030
I tell you...

1515
02:33:52,502 --> 02:33:56,461
...you are the greatest
composer known to me.

1516
02:34:00,543 --> 02:34:01,805
Do you mean it?

1517
02:34:07,884 --> 02:34:09,715
- It's him!
- Who?

1518
02:34:10,287 --> 02:34:11,879
The man.

1519
02:34:12,455 --> 02:34:13,979
He's here.

1520
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:19,325
Tell him to go away.

1521
02:34:19,529 --> 02:34:23,932
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.

1522
02:34:24,734 --> 02:34:26,326
No, no. Wait!

1523
02:34:27,203 --> 02:34:31,264
Ask him if he would
give me some money now.

1524
02:34:31,508 --> 02:34:34,477
Tell him it will help me finish it.

1525
02:34:53,863 --> 02:34:55,091
Salieri?

1526
02:34:55,365 --> 02:34:56,627
Yes.

1527
02:34:58,101 --> 02:35:02,060
- Can we come in?
- Better not. He's sleeping.

1528
02:35:02,972 --> 02:35:06,430
- He's all right?
- Yes, he's just exhausted.

1529
02:35:06,643 --> 02:35:09,612
He became dizzy, that's all.

1530
02:35:10,313 --> 02:35:12,804
Tell him we came by, won't you?

1531
02:35:13,350 --> 02:35:14,783
Of course.

1532
02:35:15,251 --> 02:35:18,448
Give him this. That's his share.

1533
02:35:19,289 --> 02:35:21,985
- That should cheer him up.
- Indeed!

1534
02:35:22,192 --> 02:35:25,559
And now, good night to you all.
It was...

1535
02:35:25,829 --> 02:35:27,729
...perfection, truly.

1536
02:35:27,931 --> 02:35:29,398
Thank you.

1537
02:35:40,009 --> 02:35:41,806
What happened?

1538
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:52,620
He said to give you this.

1539
02:35:53,823 --> 02:35:57,054
And if you finish by tomorrow night...

1540
02:35:57,460 --> 02:36:00,952
...he will pay you
another hundred ducats.

1541
02:36:01,631 --> 02:36:03,189
Another...?

1542
02:36:04,067 --> 02:36:07,127
That's too soon. Tomorrow night...

1543
02:36:08,805 --> 02:36:10,773
It's impossible.

1544
02:36:14,177 --> 02:36:16,407
Did he say 100?

1545
02:36:16,679 --> 02:36:18,112
Yes.

1546
02:36:22,852 --> 02:36:24,410
It's too soon.

1547
02:36:27,056 --> 02:36:28,614
Can I...?

1548
02:36:29,225 --> 02:36:31,125
Could I help you?

1549
02:36:33,797 --> 02:36:35,628
Would you?

1550
02:36:39,302 --> 02:36:40,929
Actually, you could.

1551
02:36:48,411 --> 02:36:50,777
- I want to go.
- Where?

1552
02:36:51,448 --> 02:36:52,779
Back to Vienna.

1553
02:36:53,349 --> 02:36:54,646
Now?

1554
02:36:54,851 --> 02:36:56,375
- Yes.
- Why?

1555
02:36:58,822 --> 02:37:00,619
I feel wrong.

1556
02:37:02,158 --> 02:37:04,649
I feel wrong being here.

1557
02:37:07,530 --> 02:37:11,159
- Where did I stop?
- The end of the Recordare.

1558
02:37:11,334 --> 02:37:12,824
So now confutatis...

1559
02:37:19,909 --> 02:37:22,241
How would you translate that?

1560
02:37:22,445 --> 02:37:24,675
"Consigned to flames of woe."

1561
02:37:27,450 --> 02:37:29,509
Do you believe in it?

1562
02:37:29,719 --> 02:37:31,448
What?

1563
02:37:31,654 --> 02:37:35,488
A fire which never dies,
burning you forever.

1564
02:37:36,926 --> 02:37:38,120
Oh, yes.

1565
02:37:39,729 --> 02:37:41,390
Possible.

1566
02:37:43,132 --> 02:37:45,100
Come, let's begin.

1567
02:37:45,401 --> 02:37:46,925
We ended in F major.

1568
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:50,401
- Yes.
- So, now, A minor.

1569
02:37:58,281 --> 02:38:01,375
- A minor.
- Yes.

1570
02:38:04,187 --> 02:38:07,156
Confutatis. A minor.

1571
02:38:09,492 --> 02:38:11,392
Start with the voices.

1572
02:38:11,594 --> 02:38:12,925
Basses first.

1573
02:38:13,129 --> 02:38:14,994
- Second beat of the...
- Time?

1574
02:38:15,164 --> 02:38:18,793
Common time.
Second beat of the first measure.

1575
02:38:20,537 --> 02:38:21,902
On A.

1576
02:38:23,973 --> 02:38:26,100
Second measure, second beat.

1577
02:38:27,010 --> 02:38:28,204
You see?

1578
02:38:28,411 --> 02:38:30,709
- Yes. D sharp?
- Of course.

1579
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:33,678
Second beat of the
third measure, on E.

1580
02:38:40,657 --> 02:38:43,057
Do you have me? Show me.

1581
02:39:02,979 --> 02:39:05,277
Good. Good.

1582
02:39:05,648 --> 02:39:07,138
Now the tenors.

1583
02:39:07,450 --> 02:39:10,442
Fourth beat of the first measure.
On C.

1584
02:39:12,855 --> 02:39:15,790
Second measure, fourth beat. D.

1585
02:39:19,028 --> 02:39:20,689
- All right?
- Yes, continue.

1586
02:39:20,897 --> 02:39:23,866
Second beat of the
fourth measure, on F.

1587
02:39:31,007 --> 02:39:34,966
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon,
bass trombones, basses.

1588
02:39:35,178 --> 02:39:37,738
Identical notes and rhythm.

1589
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:43,519
First bassoon, tenor trombones,
with tenors.

1590
02:39:49,926 --> 02:39:53,657
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?

1591
02:39:53,896 --> 02:39:56,922
- Bassoon to trombone what?
- The tenors.

1592
02:39:57,533 --> 02:40:00,730
- Identical?
- The instruments doubling the voices.

1593
02:40:00,903 --> 02:40:02,564
Trumpets and timpani.

1594
02:40:02,772 --> 02:40:04,672
Trumpets in D. Listen.

1595
02:40:04,874 --> 02:40:06,705
- I don't understand!
- Listen!

1596
02:40:07,343 --> 02:40:11,871
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant,
first and third beats.

1597
02:40:13,016 --> 02:40:15,007
It goes with the harmony!

1598
02:40:21,491 --> 02:40:23,152
Yes. Yes, yes!

1599
02:40:32,935 --> 02:40:35,369
I understand. And that's all?

1600
02:40:35,538 --> 02:40:38,701
No, now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.

1601
02:40:38,908 --> 02:40:41,240
Ostinato on A. Like this.

1602
02:40:44,714 --> 02:40:46,705
Next measure is rising.

1603
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:50,852
Do you have it? Show me.

1604
02:40:58,528 --> 02:41:01,088
- It's wonderful!
- Yes, yes. Go on.

1605
02:41:08,304 --> 02:41:10,295
- Write that down!
- Yes, yes.

1606
02:41:14,544 --> 02:41:16,910
"Call me among the blessed."

1607
02:41:17,714 --> 02:41:18,942
C major.

1608
02:41:19,382 --> 02:41:24,115
Sopranos and altos in thirds.
Altos on C, sopranos above.

1609
02:41:36,833 --> 02:41:39,666
Sopranos up to F on the second voca?

1610
02:41:39,836 --> 02:41:45,536
And on dictus. And underneath,
just violins. Arpeggios.

1611
02:41:46,175 --> 02:41:49,508
Descending scale in
eighth notes, back to ostinato.

1612
02:41:49,679 --> 02:41:51,840
- Do you have it?
- You go too fast.

1613
02:41:52,048 --> 02:41:55,313
- Do you have it?
- One moment, please!

1614
02:41:59,188 --> 02:42:02,385
Show me the whole thing
from the beginning.

1615
02:44:06,582 --> 02:44:09,050
Do you want to rest a bit?

1616
02:44:09,252 --> 02:44:11,345
No, I'm not tired at all.

1617
02:44:17,326 --> 02:44:20,056
We'll stop for a moment.

1618
02:44:20,229 --> 02:44:24,825
- Then we'll finish the Lacrimosa.
- I can keep going.

1619
02:44:25,568 --> 02:44:29,163
Will you stay with me
while I sleep a little?

1620
02:44:30,606 --> 02:44:32,631
I'm not leaving you.

1621
02:44:40,349 --> 02:44:42,544
I'm so ashamed.

1622
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:45,854
Of what?

1623
02:44:46,489 --> 02:44:48,616
I was foolish.

1624
02:44:49,158 --> 02:44:53,185
I thought you did not care
for my work, or me.

1625
02:44:57,333 --> 02:44:59,130
Forgive me.

1626
02:45:03,940 --> 02:45:06,033
Forgive me.

1627
02:46:03,833 --> 02:46:06,063
What are you doing here?

1628
02:46:08,504 --> 02:46:11,496
Your husband took sick.

1629
02:46:12,842 --> 02:46:14,673
I brought him home.

1630
02:46:16,746 --> 02:46:18,077
Why you?

1631
02:46:19,582 --> 02:46:22,517
Because, madame, I was at hand.

1632
02:46:26,555 --> 02:46:29,786
Well, thank you very much.
You can go now.

1633
02:46:32,328 --> 02:46:34,262
He needs me, ma'am.

1634
02:46:34,864 --> 02:46:36,627
No, he doesn't.

1635
02:46:36,866 --> 02:46:39,061
And I don't want you here.

1636
02:46:39,368 --> 02:46:40,835
Just go, please.

1637
02:46:41,637 --> 02:46:44,504
- He asked me to stay.
- And I'm ask...

1638
02:47:14,637 --> 02:47:16,502
I'm back.

1639
02:47:19,809 --> 02:47:22,369
I missed you so much.

1640
02:47:26,415 --> 02:47:28,042
If you'd just...

1641
02:47:29,652 --> 02:47:32,280
...show me that you need me.

1642
02:47:38,461 --> 02:47:40,827
And I'll try to do better too.

1643
02:47:53,609 --> 02:47:55,236
What is this?

1644
02:47:58,647 --> 02:48:03,084
No, Wolfie, not this. Not this.

1645
02:48:06,689 --> 02:48:10,250
You're not to work on this ever again.

1646
02:48:11,193 --> 02:48:13,127
I've decided.

1647
02:48:17,166 --> 02:48:19,566
This is not his handwriting.

1648
02:48:21,604 --> 02:48:23,162
It's mine.

1649
02:48:24,373 --> 02:48:25,897
I was assisting him.

1650
02:48:27,676 --> 02:48:30,736
He's not to work on this anymore.

1651
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:33,275
- It's making him ill.
- But...

1652
02:48:36,318 --> 02:48:38,149
Good night.

1653
02:48:40,923 --> 02:48:45,087
I regret we have no servants
to show you out, Herr Salieri.

1654
02:48:45,294 --> 02:48:48,161
Please respect my wish and go.

1655
02:48:48,664 --> 02:48:50,461
Madame...

1656
02:48:50,666 --> 02:48:53,066
...I will respect his.

1657
02:52:57,679 --> 02:53:00,375
Your merciful God.

1658
02:53:03,786 --> 02:53:09,088
He destroyed his own beloved,
rather than let a mediocrity...

1659
02:53:09,291 --> 02:53:13,125
...share in the smallest part
of his glory.

1660
02:53:14,696 --> 02:53:16,357
He killed Mozart.

1661
02:53:16,965 --> 02:53:19,297
And kept me alive to torture.

1662
02:53:20,035 --> 02:53:23,732
Thirty-two years of torture.
Thirty-two years...

1663
02:53:24,373 --> 02:53:28,275
...of slowly watching myself
become extinct.

1664
02:53:28,477 --> 02:53:30,707
My music...

1665
02:53:30,913 --> 02:53:32,608
...growing fainter.

1666
02:53:33,048 --> 02:53:35,209
All the time fainter...

1667
02:53:36,051 --> 02:53:38,383
...till no one plays it at all.

1668
02:53:39,955 --> 02:53:41,286
And his...

1669
02:53:43,158 --> 02:53:47,686
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.

1670
02:53:48,464 --> 02:53:53,060
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls. He loves those.

1671
02:53:53,602 --> 02:53:56,298
Fresh sugar rolls.

1672
02:53:56,505 --> 02:53:59,030
I will speak for you, Father.

1673
02:53:59,241 --> 02:54:02,472
I speak for all mediocrities
in the world.

1674
02:54:02,878 --> 02:54:05,676
I am their champion.

1675
02:54:05,881 --> 02:54:08,611
I am their patron saint.

1676
02:54:18,861 --> 02:54:21,659
Mediocrities everywhere...

1677
02:54:23,332 --> 02:54:25,596
...I absolve you.

1678
02:54:27,636 --> 02:54:29,160
I absolve you.

1679
02:54:30,472 --> 02:54:32,633
I absolve you.

1680
02:54:38,647 --> 02:54:41,514
I absolve you all.
