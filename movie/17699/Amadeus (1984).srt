2
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:40,601
Mozart!

3
00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:43,653
Forgive your assassin!

4
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,858
I confess, I killed you!

5
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:51,108
<i>Sì, I killed you, Mozart.</i>

6
00:00:54,992 --> 00:00:58,733
<i>Mozart, pietà!
Forgive your assassin!</i>

7
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:02,237
Forgive me, Mozart!

8
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:08,296
<i>Signore Salieri,
open the door, be good now!</i>

9
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:11,717
<i>Signore, we have
something special for you.</i>

10
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:15,064
Something you're going to love.

11
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,989
Is that good!

12
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:25,856
<i>Signore, believe me...</i>

13
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:30,657
...this is the most delicious thing
I ever ate in my life!

14
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:34,902
Really, you don't know
what you're miss...

15
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,919
All right, that's enough!
Open the door.

16
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:50,257
<i>Signore, if you don't
open this door...</i>

17
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:53,343
...we're gonna leave nothing
for you.

18
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:57,134
And I'm never gonna come
see you again!

19
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:58,223
Good morning, Father.

20
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:29,589
<i>Herr Salieri?</i>

21
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,070
Leave me alone.

22
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:15,449
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

23
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:18,488
Do you know who I am?

24
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:22,951
That makes no difference.

25
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:26,491
All men are equal in God's eyes.

26
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:32,878
Are they?

27
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:36,533
Offer me your confession.

28
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:42,779
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

29
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:50,008
How well are you trained in music?

30
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:56,521
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.

31
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:59,874
- Where?
- Here in Vienna.

32
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:04,272
Then you must know this.

33
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:15,112
I can't say that I do.

34
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,361
What is it?

35
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:21,682
It was a very popular tune in its day.

36
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:23,159
I wrote it.

37
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,760
Here, how about this?

38
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,765
This one brought down the house
when we played it.

39
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,391
Well?

40
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:27,624
I regret it is not too familiar.

41
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,284
Can you recall no melody of mine?

42
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:34,381
I was the most famous composer
in Europe.

43
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:37,433
I wrote 40 operas alone.

44
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:40,596
Here!

45
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:43,402
What about this one?

46
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,659
Yes, I know that!

47
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,411
That's charming!

48
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:06,956
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you wrote that.

49
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,521
I didn't.

50
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:19,074
That was Mozart.

51
00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:22,764
Wolfgang...

52
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:27,243
...Amadeus Mozart.

53
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:31,947
The man you accuse yourself
of killing.

54
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:37,278
You've heard that?

55
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,593
Is it true?

56
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:51,494
For God's sake, my son...

57
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:57,888
...if you have something to confess,
do it now.

58
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:01,453
Give yourself some peace.

59
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:07,039
He...

60
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:10,269
...was my idol.

61
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:15,641
<i>Mozart.</i>

62
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:20,240
<i>I can 't think of a time
when I didn 't know his name.</i>

63
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:22,242
<i>I was playing games...</i>

64
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:26,747
<i>... when he was playing music
for kings and emperors.</i>

65
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:29,897
<i>Even the pope in Rome.</i>

66
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,964
<i>I admit, I was jealous...</i>

67
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:39,384
<i>... when I heard the tales
they told about him.</i>

68
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:41,970
<i>Not of the brilliant little prodigy...</i>

69
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:46,771
<i>... but of his father,
who had taught him everything.</i>

70
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,047
<i>My father, he did not care for music.</i>

71
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,732
When I told him...

72
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:56,486
...how I wished I could be
like Mozart...

73
00:10:56,487 --> 00:11:01,115
<i>"... he would say, " Why? Do you want
to be a trained monkey?</i>

74
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:05,916
<i>You'd like me to drag you around,
doing tricks like a circus freak?"</i>

75
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:12,335
How could I tell him...

76
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:16,767
...what music meant to me?

77
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:33,607
<i>While my father
prayed earnestly to God...</i>

78
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,735
<i>... to protect commerce...</i>

79
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,862
<i>... I would offer up...</i>

80
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,422
<i>... secretly...</i>

81
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,995
<i>... the proudest prayer
a boy could think of.</i>

82
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:49,541
<i>"Lord, make me a great composer."</i>

83
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,712
<i>Let me celebrate your glory
through music...</i>

84
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,010
<i>... and be celebrated myself.</i>

85
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,844
<i>Make me famous through the world.</i>

86
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,994
<i>Make me immortal.</i>

87
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,474
<i>After I die...</i>

88
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:11,275
...let people speak my name
with love for what I wrote.

89
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,060
In return...

90
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,070
...I will give you my chastity...

91
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,827
...my industry...

92
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:27,403
...my deepest humility,
every hour of my life.

93
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,284
<i>"Amen. "</i>

94
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,836
<i>And do you know what happened?</i>

95
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,298
<i>A miracle!</i>

96
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:58,000
My life changed forever.

97
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:02,157
I knew God had arranged it all.
That was obvious.

98
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:05,577
One minute I was a frustrated boy...

99
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:09,665
...in an obscure little town.
The next I was here...

100
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:13,357
...in Vienna, city of musicians...

101
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,881
<i>... and Emperor Joseph,
the musical king.</i>

102
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:22,682
<i>In a few years, I was his court
composer. Isn 't that incredible?</i>

103
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:26,515
<i>Every night I sat with
the emperor of Austria...</i>

104
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:28,558
<i>... playing duets with him...</i>

105
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,661
<i>... correcting the royal sight-reading.</i>

106
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:38,693
Actually, the man had no ear at all.

107
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:41,739
But what did it matter?

108
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,628
He adored my music.

109
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,954
Tell me...

110
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:50,760
If you had been me...

111
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,758
...wouldn't you have thought
God had accepted your vow?

112
00:13:57,256 --> 00:14:00,049
And believe me, I honored it.

113
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,760
I was a model of virtue.

114
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:05,263
I kept my hands off women.

115
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:09,935
I worked hours every day
teaching students, many for free!

116
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:14,736
Sitting on endless committees
to help poor musicians.

117
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:18,193
Work, that was all my life.

118
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:20,571
And it was wonderful.

119
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:23,476
Everybody liked me.

120
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:27,636
I liked myself.

121
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,315
Until he came.

122
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:39,595
He came to Vienna to play
some of his music...

123
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:45,101
...at the residence
of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.

124
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:51,169
<i>Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.</i>

125
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:56,173
<i>That night...</i>

126
00:14:57,526 --> 00:15:00,233
<i>... changed my life.</i>

127
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:06,910
<i>As I wandered through the salon...</i>

128
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:09,829
<i>... I played a little game with myself.</i>

129
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,459
<i>This man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4...</i>

130
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,260
<i>... his first symphony at 7,
a full-scale opera at 12!</i>

131
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:22,500
<i>Did it show?</i>

132
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:26,681
<i>Is talent like that...</i>

133
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:29,979
<i>... written on the face?</i>

134
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,855
<i>Which one of them...</i>

135
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:37,923
<i>... could he be?</i>

136
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:42,896
Mozart is not here.

137
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:49,160
- Stop it!
- I am.

138
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:51,746
- Stop it!
- I am stopping it.

139
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:56,042
I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.

140
00:17:56,043 --> 00:18:00,715
There. You see? I've stopped.

141
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:02,925
- Now we're going back.
- No!

142
00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:05,803
Yes! You don't know where you are.

143
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:08,806
Here, everything goes backwards.

144
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,690
People walk and dance and sing
and even talk backwards.

145
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:19,112
- That's stupid.
- Why? People fart backwards.

146
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,950
Ssa-ym-ssik!

147
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:24,905
Ssa-ym-ssik!

148
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,492
Yes, you are. You are very sick.

149
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:31,496
No! Say it backwards, shitwit!

150
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:33,761
Ssa-ym-ssik.

151
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,168
Ssik, kiss.

152
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:39,121
Ym, my. Ssa.

153
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,940
Kiss my ass.

154
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:44,926
Em-yrram!

155
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:47,846
- I'm not playing!
- Say it, it's serious.

156
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:49,471
It's very serious.

157
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:54,290
Yrram.

158
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:57,851
Marry me.

159
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:01,527
I'm not gonna marry you.
You're a fiend.

160
00:19:01,528 --> 00:19:03,153
Uoy-evol-l-tub.

161
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:07,617
Tub.

162
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:09,783
But I...

163
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:13,414
...love...

164
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:16,319
But I love you?

165
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:26,552
- Tihs-ym-tae.
- What?

166
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:33,601
- Eat.
- Eat.

167
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:36,813
- Ym, my.
- My.

168
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:38,930
Tihs. Eat my shit.

169
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,567
You filthy fiend!

170
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:45,014
You filthy...!

171
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,469
My music.

172
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:55,193
They've started without me.

173
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:12,079
That was Mozart!

174
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:17,504
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

175
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,547
- I think that went well, don't you?
- Indeed.

176
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:26,259
The Viennese know good music,
don't you think?

177
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,491
Certainly.

178
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,448
Your Grace.

179
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:37,036
Ah, Mozart.

180
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:40,817
- Why?
- Why what, sir?

181
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:44,946
Why do I have to be humiliated
in front of my guests...

182
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:47,490
...by one of my own servants?

183
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:51,244
The more license I allow you,
the more you take.

184
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:55,832
If His Grace is not satisfied,
he can dismiss me.

185
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,627
I wish you to return immediately
to Salzburg.

186
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:04,090
- Your father is waiting for you there.
- No, Your Grace!

187
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:08,891
I would prefer you dismissed me.
It's obvious I don't satisfy.

188
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:14,104
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service...

189
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:18,044
...and learn your place.

190
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,061
<i>On the page it looked...</i>

191
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:58,063
<i>Nothing!</i>

192
00:22:58,064 --> 00:23:02,837
The beginning simple, almost comic.

193
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:05,153
Just a pulse.

194
00:23:05,154 --> 00:23:08,990
Bassoons, basset horns...

195
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:12,535
...like a rusty squeezebox.

196
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:17,707
And then, suddenly...

197
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,317
...high above it...

198
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:24,337
...an oboe.

199
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:29,989
A single note, hanging there,
unwavering.

200
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,641
Until...

201
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:37,086
...a clarinet took it over...

202
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:43,697
...sweetened it into a phrase
of such delight.

203
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:52,206
This was no composition
by a performing monkey.

204
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,509
This was a music I had never heard.

205
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:05,310
Filled with such longing,
such unfulfillable longing.

206
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:10,219
<i>It seemed to me I was hearing
the voice of God.</i>

207
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,696
Excuse me.

208
00:24:12,974 --> 00:24:15,017
<i>But why?</i>

209
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:19,818
<i>Why would God choose an obscene child
to be his instrument?</i>

210
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:23,443
It was not to be believed.

211
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:28,244
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.

212
00:24:32,244 --> 00:24:34,164
It better be.

213
00:24:34,955 --> 00:24:37,540
How good is he, this Mozart?

214
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:42,341
He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an
extraordinary opera of his last month.

215
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,367
<i>- Idomeneo, King of Crete.
- That?</i>

216
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:50,553
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.

217
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:52,239
Tiresome?

218
00:24:52,973 --> 00:24:57,435
A young man trying to impress
beyond his abilities.

219
00:24:57,436 --> 00:25:00,241
Too much spice.

220
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:02,412
Too many notes.

221
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:04,233
Majesty...

222
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:07,987
...it was the most promising work
I've heard in years.

223
00:25:07,988 --> 00:25:11,825
Then, we should make
some effort to acquire him.

224
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:16,413
We could use a good German composer
in Vienna, surely?

225
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:21,214
I'm sure he could be tempted
with the right offer. Say...

226
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:25,506
...an opera in German
for our National Theater.

227
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:26,934
Excellent, sire!

228
00:25:27,675 --> 00:25:30,928
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.

229
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,516
Italian is the proper language
for opera.

230
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:38,716
All educated people agree on that.

231
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:45,212
What do you think, chamberlain?

232
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:50,119
In my opinion, it's time
we had a piece in our own language.

233
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:55,041
Plain German for plain people.

234
00:25:57,331 --> 00:26:00,083
Kapellmeister?

235
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:01,876
Majesty...

236
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:05,717
<i>...I must agree with Herr Direttore.</i>

237
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:09,234
German is...

238
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:16,383
...too brute for singing.

239
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:20,914
Court composer...

240
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:24,936
...what do you think?

241
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:29,864
I think it's an interesting notion
to keep Mozart in Vienna.

242
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:33,112
It should infuriate the archbishop...

243
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,078
...if that is Your Majesty's
intention.

244
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,214
<i>You are cattivo, court composer.</i>

245
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:46,635
I want to meet this young man.
Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

246
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,525
Well, there it is!

247
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:26,130
This is a beautiful wig for you.

248
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:30,301
It looks so marvelous and I love it.

249
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:31,778
The other one.

250
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:37,675
Here is the other one.
I think you will love it.

251
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:44,273
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.

252
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:48,152
- How do you like it?
- They're all so beautiful!

253
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:51,402
Why don't I have three heads?

254
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,576
This is funny!

255
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:56,054
Three heads!

256
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:58,580
Gentlemen.

257
00:27:58,581 --> 00:28:02,076
- Good morning.
- Morning, Your Majesty.

258
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:07,533
What do you have for me today?

259
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:11,677
<i>- Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
- Yes, what about him?</i>

260
00:28:11,678 --> 00:28:13,941
He's here.

261
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:18,017
Well, there it is. Good!

262
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:22,818
I hope you won't find it improper,
but I've written a march in his honor.

263
00:28:23,732 --> 00:28:27,985
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?

264
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:29,570
Just a...

265
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:32,722
Just a trifle, of course.

266
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:36,053
May I try it?

267
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:42,796
Let's have some fun.

268
00:28:56,892 --> 00:29:00,583
Delightful, court composer!

269
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:04,455
May I play it when he comes in?

270
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:08,903
<i>- You do me too much honor.
- Bring in Herr Mozart.</i>

271
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:10,780
But slowly.

272
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:13,881
I need a minute to practice.

273
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,465
Good, continue.

274
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:43,322
G, Majesty.

275
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,360
Excellent!

276
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:52,114
Good, Majesty.

277
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:56,151
Continue. Very good.

278
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,911
Very good, Majesty.

279
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:04,377
Tempo! Up.

280
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:08,297
Lightly, then strongly!
It's a march, Majesty.

281
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:10,218
Again.

282
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:51,327
Bravo, Majesty!

283
00:30:51,676 --> 00:30:56,476
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.

284
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:06,275
No, please. It's not a holy relic.

285
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:12,529
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.

286
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:17,330
You don't recall. You were only 6.
He was giving a delightful concert!

287
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,954
As he got off the stool, he fell.

288
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:25,043
My sister Antoinette helped him up.
Know what he did?

289
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:29,844
He jumped into her arms and said,
"Will you marry me? Yes or no?"

290
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:37,890
You know all these gentlemen.
The Baron Van Swieten.

291
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:41,852
- I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.

292
00:31:41,853 --> 00:31:43,822
Kapellmeister Bonno.

293
00:31:45,524 --> 00:31:46,982
My pleasure.

294
00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:50,820
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

295
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:54,610
Sir, yes. The honor is mine,
absolutely!

296
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:59,704
Here is our
illustrious court composer...

297
00:31:59,705 --> 00:32:01,968
...Maestro Salieri.

298
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:07,061
At last, such immense joy!

299
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:10,464
I know your work well.

300
00:32:10,465 --> 00:32:15,261
You know, I composed some variations
on a melody of yours.

301
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:18,431
<i>- Really? Which one?
- "Mio Caro Adone."</i>

302
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,015
I'm flattered.

303
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:23,352
A funny tune,
but it yielded good things.

304
00:32:23,353 --> 00:32:26,440
And now he has returned
the compliment.

305
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:30,235
<i>Herr Salieri composed
this little march for you.</i>

306
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:32,204
Really?

307
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,949
Well, there it is.

308
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,750
Down to business. We're going
to commission an opera from you.

309
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:43,712
What do you say?

310
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:48,703
Did we vote in the end
for German or Italian?

311
00:32:48,796 --> 00:32:53,596
Sire, if you remember,
we did finally incline to Italian.

312
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:56,631
Did we?

313
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:02,016
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.

314
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:07,065
- German. Please let it be German.
- Why so?

315
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:11,527
Because I've already found
the most wonderful libretto.

316
00:33:11,528 --> 00:33:13,940
Have I seen it?

317
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:18,535
<i>I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.
It's quite new.</i>

318
00:33:18,536 --> 00:33:23,123
- I'll show it to you immediately.
- I think you'd better.

319
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:24,749
Well...

320
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:29,768
...tell us about it.
Tell us the story.

321
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:35,469
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.

322
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,270
It's set...
The whole thing is set in a...

323
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:48,524
Yes? Where?

324
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:52,736
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.

325
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:56,724
- You mean in Turkey?
- Yes, exactly.

326
00:33:57,242 --> 00:34:02,042
Then why especially
does it have to be in German?

327
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:07,172
It doesn't, especially. It could be
in Turkish if you really want.

328
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:12,802
No, my dear fellow, the language
is not finally the point.

329
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:17,642
Do you really think that subject
is appropriate for a national theater?

330
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,017
Why not? It's charming.

331
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:26,818
I mean, I won't actually show
concubines exposing their...

332
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:32,403
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.

333
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,406
It's full of proper German virtues.

334
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:39,952
Excuse me, Majesty, but what
do you think these could be?

335
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:43,372
Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.

336
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,917
Well, tell him, Mozart.

337
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,628
Name us a German virtue.

338
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,798
- Love, sire.
- Oh, love!

339
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,982
Of course, in Italy
we know nothing about love.

340
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,516
No, I don't think you do.

341
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:07,314
Watching Italian opera,
all those male sopranos screeching...

342
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:12,115
...stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes
about. That's not love. It's rubbish!

343
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:18,283
Majesty, you choose the language.

344
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:23,038
I'll set it to the finest music
ever offered a monarch.

345
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,320
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.

346
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,420
This is yours.

347
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:33,340
Keep it.
It's already here in my head.

348
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:36,760
What? On one hearing only?

349
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:40,600
I think so, sire. Yes.

350
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:45,510
Show us.

351
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:18,364
The rest is just the same, isn't it?

352
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:25,052
That doesn't really work, does it?

353
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:28,247
Did you try...?

354
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:33,235
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?

355
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:35,154
Or this?

356
00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:37,517
This. Yes.

357
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:44,810
Better? What do you think?

358
00:37:30,921 --> 00:37:34,120
<i>Grazie, Signore.</i>

359
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:40,304
<i>All I ever wanted
was to sing to God.</i>

360
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:44,144
He gave me that longing...

361
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:47,861
...and then made me mute. Why?

362
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:51,003
Tell me that.

363
00:37:51,692 --> 00:37:55,737
If he didn't want me
to praise him with music...

364
00:37:55,738 --> 00:37:58,865
...why implant the desire...

365
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:02,285
...like a lust in my body?

366
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:05,142
And then deny me the talent?

367
00:38:08,543 --> 00:38:11,878
Madame Cavalieri is here
for her lesson, sir.

368
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:13,848
Maestro.

369
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:17,485
Well...?

370
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,169
How do you like it?

371
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,725
It's Turkish.

372
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:29,521
My hairdresser said everything
this year's going to be Turkish.

373
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:31,638
Does he?

374
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:38,185
What else did he tell you today?

375
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:44,066
Come, come! Give me some gossip.

376
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:49,488
<i>Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.</i>

377
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:54,882
News travels fast in Vienna.

378
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:59,683
And he's been commissioned
to write an opera. Is it true?

379
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,515
- Yes.
- Is there a part in it for me?

380
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:06,435
- No.
- How do you know?

381
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:10,314
- Do you know where it's set, my dear?
- Where?

382
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:12,480
In a harem.

383
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:17,054
- What's that?
- A brothel.

384
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:22,278
Come.

385
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,209
Let's begin.

386
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:29,083
- What does he look like?
- Mozart?

387
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:32,233
- You might be disappointed.
- Why?

388
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:37,175
Looks and talent don't always
go together, Katerina.

389
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:40,178
Looks don't concern me, maestro.

390
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:44,849
Only talent interests
a woman of taste.

391
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,606
Shall we continue?

392
00:40:24,975 --> 00:40:27,238
There she was.

393
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:33,316
<i>I don 't know where they met or how.
There she stood!</i>

394
00:40:33,317 --> 00:40:35,902
<i>On stage, for all to see.</i>

395
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:40,677
<i>Showing off like
the greedy songbird she was.</i>

396
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:17,699
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios!

397
00:41:18,613 --> 00:41:23,413
<i>Whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground.</i>

398
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:37,593
Understand, I was
in love with the girl.

399
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:40,303
Or at least in lust.

400
00:41:41,054 --> 00:41:45,854
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.

401
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:54,487
All the same, I couldn't bear
to think of anyone else touching her.

402
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:58,722
Least of all, "the creature."

403
00:43:41,803 --> 00:43:46,603
Brava, madame!
You are an ornament to our stage.

404
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,243
Your Majesty.

405
00:43:52,522 --> 00:43:55,857
<i>Well, Herr Mozart. A good effort.</i>

406
00:43:55,858 --> 00:43:57,776
Well, decidedly that.

407
00:43:57,777 --> 00:44:02,157
An excellent effort!
You have shown us something...

408
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,619
...quite new tonight.
- It is new.

409
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,414
- It is, isn't it, sire?
- Yes, indeed.

410
00:44:09,415 --> 00:44:14,001
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?

411
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:17,213
Well, of course I did! It's very good!

412
00:44:17,214 --> 00:44:21,468
Of course, now and then,
just now and then...

413
00:44:21,469 --> 00:44:24,520
...it seemed a touch...

414
00:44:25,473 --> 00:44:27,558
What do you mean, sire?

415
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,359
Well, I mean, occasionally,
it seems to have...

416
00:44:32,564 --> 00:44:35,418
How shall one say...?

417
00:44:37,694 --> 00:44:40,320
<i>How shall one say, direktor?</i>

418
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:44,074
- Too many notes, Majesty?
- Exactly. Very well put.

419
00:44:44,075 --> 00:44:48,495
- Too many notes.
- I don't understand.

420
00:44:48,496 --> 00:44:53,250
There are just as many notes
as I required, neither more nor less.

421
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:56,128
My dear fellow, there are in fact...

422
00:44:56,129 --> 00:45:00,757
...only so many notes
the ear can hear in an evening.

423
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:06,602
I think I'm right in saying that,
aren't I, court composer?

424
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:11,394
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.

425
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:13,188
This is absurd!

426
00:45:13,189 --> 00:45:17,650
Young man, don't take it too hard.
Your work is ingenious.

427
00:45:17,651 --> 00:45:19,527
It's quality work.

428
00:45:19,528 --> 00:45:24,328
And there are simply too many notes.
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

429
00:45:25,409 --> 00:45:27,968
Which few did you have in mind?

430
00:45:28,496 --> 00:45:30,612
Wolfgang!

431
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,588
Wolfgang, my dear!

432
00:45:35,753 --> 00:45:40,006
<i>- Wolfgang!
- Majesty, this is Frau Weber.</i>

433
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:42,961
She's my landlady.

434
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:49,812
- Enchanted, madame.
- Sire, such an honor!

435
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,734
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.

436
00:45:57,735 --> 00:46:02,214
<i>- She's the fiancée of Herr Mozart.
- Really?</i>

437
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:09,734
How charming. Please.

438
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,546
Well...

439
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:30,556
...when do you marry?

440
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:36,148
We haven't exactly received
my father's consent yet.

441
00:46:36,149 --> 00:46:40,824
Not entirely. Not altogether.

442
00:46:42,822 --> 00:46:47,622
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
- 26.

443
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,707
My advice is for you to marry
this charming young lady...

444
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:56,210
...and stay with us in Vienna.
- You see?

445
00:46:56,211 --> 00:46:59,547
I told him that,
but he won't listen to me.

446
00:46:59,548 --> 00:47:03,760
Your Majesty,
you give such wonderful...

447
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:08,561
...such royal advice. May I...?

448
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:20,955
Well, there it is.

449
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:24,875
Wolfie, will you get some water?

450
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,551
Will you get some water, please?

451
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,036
Wolfie, get some water!

452
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:48,373
Excuse me. Excuse me.

453
00:47:55,314 --> 00:47:57,676
Did you know?

454
00:47:58,526 --> 00:48:01,233
- What?
- The marriage.

455
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:06,241
What does it matter to you?

456
00:48:06,242 --> 00:48:11,042
Nothing. He can marry who he pleases,
I don't give a damn.

457
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:15,717
How was I?

458
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:18,967
You were sublime.

459
00:48:19,088 --> 00:48:22,484
And what did you think of the music?

460
00:48:23,259 --> 00:48:25,867
Extremely clever.

461
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:28,763
Katerina, I...

462
00:48:28,764 --> 00:48:30,585
Excuse me.

463
00:48:31,183 --> 00:48:34,936
Is that woman still lying
on the floor?

464
00:48:34,937 --> 00:48:39,737
- No, she's fine.
- Oh, I'm so relieved.

465
00:48:41,154 --> 00:48:44,598
Dear Mozart,
my sincere congratulations.

466
00:48:44,866 --> 00:48:49,161
- Did you like it then?
- How could I not?

467
00:48:49,162 --> 00:48:52,998
It's the best music
in Vienna today, don't you agree?

468
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:56,690
She must be dazzling in bed.

469
00:48:58,254 --> 00:49:02,049
I assume she's the virtuoso
in that department.

470
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:06,626
No other reason why
you'd marry someone like that.

471
00:49:07,472 --> 00:49:09,194
Come in.

472
00:49:11,768 --> 00:49:15,771
Excuse me.
Wolfie, Mom isn't feeling very well.

473
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:17,647
- Can we go home?
- Yes.

474
00:49:17,648 --> 00:49:21,109
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.

475
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:24,071
This is his night.

476
00:49:24,072 --> 00:49:26,865
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?

477
00:49:26,866 --> 00:49:31,198
<i>Excuse us, Fräulein.
Good night, signore.</i>

478
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:36,881
<i>At that moment I knew,
beyond any doubt...</i>

479
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:39,712
<i>... he'd had her.</i>

480
00:49:39,713 --> 00:49:43,896
The creature had had my darling girl.

481
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:54,090
It was incomprehensible!

482
00:49:54,103 --> 00:49:57,252
What was God up to?

483
00:49:58,107 --> 00:50:01,846
Was it possible I was being tested?

484
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:07,119
Was God expecting me
to offer forgiveness...

485
00:50:07,158 --> 00:50:10,160
...in the face of every offense?

486
00:50:10,161 --> 00:50:12,326
No matter how painful?

487
00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:16,611
It's very possible.

488
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:19,318
But why him?

489
00:50:19,796 --> 00:50:24,596
Why choose Mozart
to teach me lessons in humility?

490
00:50:25,886 --> 00:50:27,887
My heart was filling up...

491
00:50:27,888 --> 00:50:31,579
...with such hatred
for that little man.

492
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,479
For the first time in my life,
I began to know...

493
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,498
...really...

494
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:41,368
...violent thoughts.

495
00:50:42,153 --> 00:50:46,953
<i>Every day, sometimes for hours,
I would pray.</i>

496
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:50,355
Lord...

497
00:50:51,245 --> 00:50:53,066
...please...

498
00:50:53,914 --> 00:50:55,915
...send him away...

499
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:59,165
...back to Salzburg.

500
00:51:00,504 --> 00:51:03,211
For his sake...

501
00:51:03,591 --> 00:51:06,543
...as well as mine.

502
00:51:08,012 --> 00:51:12,307
- No! I won't have him back.
- But, Your Grace...

503
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:17,108
Your son is an unprincipled,
spoiled, conceited brat!

504
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:21,477
Yes, sir...

505
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,419
...that is the truth.

506
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:30,289
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.

507
00:51:30,702 --> 00:51:34,197
I was too indulgent with him.

508
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,686
Please, Your Grace?

509
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,619
Give him one more chance?

510
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,091
You have leave to try.

511
00:51:44,092 --> 00:51:48,470
God bless, Your Grace!
I thank Your Grace.

512
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:50,784
I thank you!

513
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:58,730
<i>I write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.</i>

514
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:02,818
<i>Take no further steps
towards marriage until we meet.</i>

515
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:07,155
<i>As you honor the father who has
devoted his life to yours...</i>

516
00:52:07,156 --> 00:52:10,602
<i>... do as I bid, and await my coming.</i>

517
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:28,175
I now join you
in the holy bonds of matrimony.

518
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,472
Those whom God hath joined together...

519
00:52:31,473 --> 00:52:35,066
...let no man put asunder.

520
00:52:48,073 --> 00:52:49,657
<i>Beloved father:</i>

521
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:54,458
<i>You say Vienna is the musicians ' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.</i>

522
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:59,375
<i>With my wife I can do it.
One day, when I'm wealthy...</i>

523
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:03,462
<i>... you'll live with us,
and we'll be so happy.</i>

524
00:53:13,267 --> 00:53:17,312
Good morning.
This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.

525
00:53:17,313 --> 00:53:18,772
Your Highness.

526
00:53:18,773 --> 00:53:22,317
She's asked me to recommend
a music instructor.

527
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:26,279
- I've come up with an excellent idea.
- Your Majesty!

528
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,407
It would be such a tremendous honor!

529
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:34,208
<i>I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?</i>

530
00:53:35,206 --> 00:53:39,094
It's an interesting idea,
Majesty, but...

531
00:53:39,752 --> 00:53:41,720
Yes?

532
00:53:41,837 --> 00:53:45,465
My concern is to protect you...

533
00:53:45,466 --> 00:53:50,043
...from any hint of favoritism.

534
00:53:53,933 --> 00:53:55,642
Favoritism.

535
00:53:55,643 --> 00:53:58,478
- What is this?
- What is what?

536
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:03,279
Why must I submit samples of my work
to a committee to teach a girl?

537
00:54:04,528 --> 00:54:07,775
Because His Majesty wishes it.

538
00:54:08,365 --> 00:54:10,950
Is the emperor angry with me?

539
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:15,579
- Quite the contrary.
- Then why not appoint me to the post?

540
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,999
You are not
the only composer in Vienna.

541
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,888
No. But I'm the best.

542
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:25,477
Mozart.

543
00:54:26,384 --> 00:54:30,665
A little modesty
might suit you better.

544
00:54:37,145 --> 00:54:39,507
Who is on this committee?

545
00:54:39,564 --> 00:54:44,364
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count
Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.

546
00:54:44,402 --> 00:54:49,202
Naturally, the Italians!
Of course, always the Italians!

547
00:54:49,407 --> 00:54:52,409
They're all musical idiots!

548
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:57,670
- And you want them to judge my music?
- Young man...

549
00:54:58,584 --> 00:55:02,795
...the issue is quite simple.
If you want this position...

550
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:07,425
...you must submit your stuff,
along with all your colleagues.

551
00:55:07,426 --> 00:55:09,641
Must I?

552
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:12,035
Well, I won't.

553
00:55:12,765 --> 00:55:15,717
How are we supposed to live?

554
00:55:16,852 --> 00:55:19,896
Do you want me to beg on the streets?

555
00:55:19,897 --> 00:55:22,308
Don't be stupid.

556
00:55:22,691 --> 00:55:25,943
- All they want to see is your work.
- Shit.

557
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:30,744
- What's wrong with that?
- Shut up! Just shut up.

558
00:55:31,075 --> 00:55:35,578
One royal pupil,
and all of Vienna will come flocking.

559
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:38,188
They'll come anyway.

560
00:55:38,332 --> 00:55:42,168
- No, they won't.
- They love me here.

561
00:55:42,169 --> 00:55:46,969
- I know how things work in this city.
- You know everything, don't you?

562
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:17,372
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.

563
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:20,542
- A lady insists on talking to you.
- Who?

564
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:24,726
She didn't say,
but she says it's urgent.

565
00:56:26,298 --> 00:56:28,857
Excuse me, my dear.

566
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,345
Your Excellency.

567
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,209
How can I help you?

568
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:48,070
<i>- Frau Mozart?
- I've come on behalf of my husband.</i>

569
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:52,871
I brought samples of his work so he
can be considered for the appointment.

570
00:56:55,328 --> 00:57:00,128
How charming,
but why did he not come himself?

571
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,530
Well, he's terribly busy, sir.

572
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,090
I understand.

573
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:14,764
I will look at them the moment I can.

574
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:19,352
It will be an honor.
Please give him my warmest regards.

575
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:24,024
Would it be too much trouble
to ask you to look at them now?

576
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:27,903
- While I wait.
- I'm afraid I'm not at leisure...

577
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:30,655
...this precise moment.

578
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:35,283
Leave them with me.
I assure you, they will be safe.

579
00:57:35,537 --> 00:57:39,180
I really cannot do that, sir.

580
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:43,376
You see, he doesn't know I'm here.

581
00:57:44,463 --> 00:57:47,131
Then he didn't send you?

582
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:51,464
No, sir. This was my own idea.

583
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:57,560
- I see.
- Sir, we're desperate.

584
00:57:57,851 --> 00:58:01,145
We really need this job.

585
00:58:01,146 --> 00:58:04,941
My husband spends far more
than he can ever earn.

586
00:58:04,942 --> 00:58:09,487
I don't mean that he's lazy,
because he works all day long.

587
00:58:09,488 --> 00:58:14,283
It's just that he's not practical.

588
00:58:14,284 --> 00:58:19,084
Money simply slips through
his fingers. It's ridiculous.

589
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:24,502
Let me offer you some refreshment.

590
00:58:24,503 --> 00:58:27,259
Do you know what these are?

591
00:58:28,507 --> 00:58:32,544
<i>Capezzoli di Venere!
Nipples of Venus.</i>

592
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:37,771
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied
sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!

593
00:58:38,143 --> 00:58:41,145
They're quite surprising.

594
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:47,839
They're wonderful!

595
00:58:49,447 --> 00:58:52,657
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

596
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:55,807
Don't keep calling me that.

597
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,319
Keeps me at such a distance.

598
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:02,876
I wasn't born a court composer,
you know.

599
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:05,211
I'm from a small town.

600
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:07,722
Just like your husband.

601
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,886
Are you sure you can't...

602
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:17,218
...leave this and come back again?

603
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:20,852
It's very tempting, sir.

604
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:24,565
But it's impossible, I'm afraid.

605
00:59:24,566 --> 00:59:27,943
He'd be frantic
if he knew they were missing.

606
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:31,292
You see, they're all originals.

607
00:59:31,698 --> 00:59:35,685
- Originals?
- Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

608
00:59:46,797 --> 00:59:48,798
These...

609
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,521
...are originals?

610
01:00:26,755 --> 01:00:28,478
<i>Astounding!</i>

611
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:32,842
It was actually...
It was beyond belief.

612
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:36,112
These were first and only...

613
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:38,775
<i>... drafts of music.</i>

614
01:00:39,685 --> 01:00:44,485
<i>But they showed no corrections
of any kind. Not one.</i>

615
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,612
<i>He had simply written down music...</i>

616
01:00:51,613 --> 01:00:54,866
...already finished in his head.

617
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:59,667
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.

618
01:01:07,087 --> 01:01:09,449
And music...

619
01:01:09,548 --> 01:01:14,027
...finished as no music
is ever finished.

620
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:19,475
Displace one note...

621
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:22,675
...and there would be diminishment.

622
01:01:23,396 --> 01:01:28,196
Displace one phrase,
and the structure would fall.

623
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:34,323
<i>It was clear to me...</i>

624
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:38,620
<i>... that sound I had heard
in the archbishop 's palace...</i>

625
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:42,115
<i>... had been no accident.</i>

626
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:47,216
<i>Here again
was the very voice of God.</i>

627
01:01:51,592 --> 01:01:54,511
I was staring through the cage...

628
01:01:54,512 --> 01:01:58,843
...of those meticulous ink strokes...

629
01:01:59,517 --> 01:02:04,242
...at an absolute beauty.

630
01:02:18,912 --> 01:02:21,766
Is it not good?

631
01:02:26,044 --> 01:02:27,767
It is miraculous.

632
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:36,308
Yes, he's very proud of his work.

633
01:02:38,265 --> 01:02:40,922
So you will help us?

634
01:02:42,602 --> 01:02:45,855
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening.

635
01:02:45,856 --> 01:02:49,525
One word from me and the post is his.

636
01:02:49,526 --> 01:02:52,820
Thank you, Your Excellency!
Thank you!

637
01:02:52,821 --> 01:02:55,528
Come back tonight.

638
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:59,256
- Tonight?
- Alone.

639
01:03:01,414 --> 01:03:02,890
What for?

640
01:03:04,293 --> 01:03:08,722
Some service
deserves service in return.

641
01:03:09,715 --> 01:03:11,683
No?

642
01:03:12,843 --> 01:03:17,321
- What do you mean?
- Isn't it obvious?

643
01:03:17,473 --> 01:03:20,975
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

644
01:03:20,976 --> 01:03:25,438
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.

645
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,357
I'm a married woman, sir.

646
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:30,327
Then don't.

647
01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:32,882
It's up to you.

648
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:36,952
And not to be vague,
that is the price.

649
01:03:48,504 --> 01:03:52,440
<i>There is no God of mercy, Father.</i>

650
01:03:54,135 --> 01:03:57,581
Just a God of torture.

651
01:04:03,228 --> 01:04:05,639
Evening came.

652
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:11,156
<i>I sat there, not knowing
whether she would return or not.</i>

653
01:04:11,653 --> 01:04:16,453
<i>I prayed as I had
never prayed before.</i>

654
01:04:17,534 --> 01:04:19,993
<i>Dear God...</i>

655
01:04:19,994 --> 01:04:22,579
<i>... enter me now.</i>

656
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:27,380
<i>Fill me with one piece of true music.</i>

657
01:04:27,419 --> 01:04:32,219
<i>One piece with your breath in it,
so I know that you love me.</i>

658
01:04:33,008 --> 01:04:37,808
<i>Show me one sign of your favor,
and I will show mine to Mozart.</i>

659
01:04:39,682 --> 01:04:44,060
<i>I will get him the royal position.</i>

660
01:04:44,061 --> 01:04:46,104
Enter me.

661
01:04:46,105 --> 01:04:48,369
Please.

662
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:51,960
Please!

663
01:04:58,243 --> 01:04:59,719
Yes?

664
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:06,996
That lady is back, sir.

665
01:05:10,922 --> 01:05:12,399
Show her in.

666
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,817
Well?

667
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:51,267
I'm here.

668
01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:58,496
My husband has gone to a concert.

669
01:05:58,597 --> 01:06:02,091
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

670
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,617
Well, where shall we go?

671
01:06:16,323 --> 01:06:19,572
Should we stay here?

672
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:22,587
Well...

673
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:29,187
Do you still want to look at these?

674
01:06:31,463 --> 01:06:35,303
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

675
01:06:36,594 --> 01:06:40,040
Suppose we don't, really.

676
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:39,000
Show this woman out.

677
01:08:00,097 --> 01:08:01,966
Stanzi.

678
01:08:03,308 --> 01:08:05,572
Stanzi.

679
01:08:10,982 --> 01:08:13,296
What is it?

680
01:08:13,777 --> 01:08:17,960
What's the matter? Tell me.

681
01:08:20,617 --> 01:08:22,883
Tell me.

682
01:08:27,959 --> 01:08:30,616
I love you.

683
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:33,794
I love you.

684
01:08:34,632 --> 01:08:38,552
From now on, we are enemies.

685
01:08:38,553 --> 01:08:40,387
<i>You and I.</i>

686
01:08:40,388 --> 01:08:43,432
<i>Because you choose
for your instrument...</i>

687
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:48,233
<i>... a boastful, lustful,
smutty, infantile boy...</i>

688
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:53,321
<i>... and give me for reward only the
ability to recognize the incarnation.</i>

689
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:58,406
<i>Because you are unjust...</i>

690
01:08:58,407 --> 01:09:00,375
<i>... unfair...</i>

691
01:09:01,118 --> 01:09:03,494
<i>... unkind...</i>

692
01:09:03,495 --> 01:09:05,496
<i>... I will block you.</i>

693
01:09:05,497 --> 01:09:07,564
<i>I swear it.</i>

694
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:11,794
<i>I will hinder and harm
your creature on earth...</i>

695
01:09:11,795 --> 01:09:14,505
<i>... as far as I am able.</i>

696
01:09:14,506 --> 01:09:18,260
I don't like to talk
against a fellow musician.

697
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:19,970
Of course not.

698
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:22,580
I have to tell you.

699
01:09:23,099 --> 01:09:27,899
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted
alone with young ladies.

700
01:09:28,563 --> 01:09:30,647
Really?

701
01:09:30,648 --> 01:09:34,902
One of my own pupils,
a very young singer...

702
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:37,154
...Maria Theresa Paradis...

703
01:09:37,155 --> 01:09:39,763
...told me she was...

704
01:09:41,034 --> 01:09:43,544
Well...

705
01:09:45,163 --> 01:09:47,820
Well, what?

706
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,751
Molested, Majesty.

707
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:54,640
Twice, in the course of
the same lesson.

708
01:09:58,718 --> 01:10:03,518
<i>There is a Herr Mozart
waiting for you in the salon.</i>

709
01:10:07,018 --> 01:10:10,396
<i>- Whom did they choose?
- Herr Zummer.</i>

710
01:10:10,397 --> 01:10:12,649
<i>Herr Zummer?</i>

711
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:16,529
But the man's a fool!
He's a total mediocrity.

712
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:21,330
No, no. He has yet
to achieve mediocrity.

713
01:10:23,412 --> 01:10:28,212
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.

714
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:31,043
Excellency, please.

715
01:10:31,044 --> 01:10:35,256
Let's go to the palace.
You can talk to the emperor...

716
01:10:35,257 --> 01:10:39,635
<i>...and tell him that Herr Zummer
is an awful choice.</i>

717
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:42,888
He could do musical harm
to the princess.

718
01:10:42,889 --> 01:10:47,689
Between us, no one in the world
could do musical harm to the princess.

719
01:10:52,357 --> 01:10:54,150
Look...

720
01:10:54,151 --> 01:10:56,193
...I must have pupils.

721
01:10:56,194 --> 01:10:59,530
Without pupils, I can't manage.

722
01:10:59,531 --> 01:11:03,200
You don't mean
you're living in poverty?

723
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:06,747
No, but I'm broke.

724
01:11:06,748 --> 01:11:09,040
Well, how is this possible?

725
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:12,377
I hear your concerts are
quite successful.

726
01:11:12,378 --> 01:11:15,630
They're stupendously successful.

727
01:11:15,631 --> 01:11:19,593
You can't get a seat.
But no one will hire me.

728
01:11:19,594 --> 01:11:21,595
They want to hear me play...

729
01:11:21,596 --> 01:11:26,396
...but they won't let me teach
their daughters, as if I was a fiend.

730
01:11:31,606 --> 01:11:33,815
Seriously...

731
01:11:33,816 --> 01:11:37,803
...is there any chance
you could manage a loan?

732
01:11:37,904 --> 01:11:42,325
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.

733
01:11:42,326 --> 01:11:46,829
You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?

734
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,981
As a matter of fact, I do.

735
01:11:50,334 --> 01:11:55,134
I am working on something that will
explode like a bomb all over Europe.

736
01:11:55,839 --> 01:12:00,639
I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
I'll pay you back double. Anything.

737
01:12:01,346 --> 01:12:03,555
You name the terms.

738
01:12:03,556 --> 01:12:06,016
Well, how exciting.

739
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:08,674
Tell me more.

740
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:14,191
- It's a bit of a secret.
- Come, come. I'm interested.

741
01:12:14,192 --> 01:12:17,293
This is delicious. What is it?

742
01:12:17,654 --> 01:12:20,781
It's cream cheese mixed with sugar...

743
01:12:20,782 --> 01:12:25,369
<i>...suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.</i>

744
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:27,162
Italian.

745
01:12:27,163 --> 01:12:31,917
Forgive me. We all have
patriotic feelings of some kind.

746
01:12:31,918 --> 01:12:33,919
Two thou...

747
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,055
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need.

748
01:12:39,342 --> 01:12:41,310
A hundred.

749
01:12:43,221 --> 01:12:44,944
Fifty.

750
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,528
What exactly are you working on?

751
01:12:51,396 --> 01:12:55,383
Really, I can't say.

752
01:12:55,484 --> 01:13:00,284
I don't think you should become known
in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.

753
01:13:08,414 --> 01:13:10,499
However...

754
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,879
...I know a distinguished
gentleman I can recommend, and...

755
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,406
...he has a daughter.

756
01:13:21,011 --> 01:13:23,888
Quiet! Quiet!

757
01:13:23,889 --> 01:13:26,182
<i>Herr Mozart.</i>

758
01:13:26,183 --> 01:13:30,102
Welcome. Pay no attention,
they're impossible.

759
01:13:30,103 --> 01:13:33,942
I treat them just like
my own children.

760
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:37,693
Which of them do you wish me to teach?

761
01:13:40,572 --> 01:13:43,131
That's funny.

762
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:46,411
You're a funny fellow.

763
01:13:46,412 --> 01:13:51,124
This is the instrument.
I hope it's to your satisfaction.

764
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:54,377
Of course it'll be
to his satisfaction.

765
01:13:54,378 --> 01:13:58,924
Come, we're going to listen
to some music. Come!

766
01:13:58,925 --> 01:14:01,287
Good boy.

767
01:14:06,557 --> 01:14:08,266
Now.

768
01:14:08,267 --> 01:14:13,067
Please play me something,
just to give me an idea.

769
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:16,048
Anything will do.

770
01:14:16,984 --> 01:14:18,485
Just go ahead.

771
01:14:18,486 --> 01:14:21,930
Just as if we weren't here.

772
01:14:22,698 --> 01:14:27,498
<i>Part of music, getting used
to an audience. Right, Herr Mozart?</i>

773
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:31,623
Perhaps it would be better
if we were left alone.

774
01:14:31,624 --> 01:14:33,834
We're both a little shy.

775
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:35,294
Play.

776
01:14:35,295 --> 01:14:38,714
- I said play!
- Michael, please.

777
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:43,512
<i>Perhaps if I play first,
it might encourage the Fräulein.</i>

778
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:46,269
Why don't you let me try?

779
01:14:55,608 --> 01:14:59,736
Stop it! Stop!
He always howls when he hears music.

780
01:14:59,737 --> 01:15:02,781
We've got to break him of that habit.

781
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:06,452
We've got to break them
of their habit!

782
01:15:06,453 --> 01:15:07,978
Play. Please.

783
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:13,004
<i>Herr Mozart, play. Please, I beg you.</i>

784
01:15:19,799 --> 01:15:22,408
That's it. That's it.

785
01:15:24,971 --> 01:15:27,678
Keep playing!

786
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:36,774
Keep playing! That's it!

787
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:59,130
Mozart, that's wonderful!
Wonderful!

788
01:15:59,131 --> 01:16:03,931
Next time you wish me to instruct
another of your dogs, let me know.

789
01:16:04,221 --> 01:16:08,552
<i>Goodbye, Fräulein. Goodbye, madam.
Goodbye, sir.</i>

790
01:17:05,116 --> 01:17:07,331
Papa?

791
01:17:10,788 --> 01:17:12,806
Papa!

792
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:18,628
Why are you here?

793
01:17:18,629 --> 01:17:20,589
Am I not welcome?

794
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:25,390
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome! Welcome!

795
01:17:46,743 --> 01:17:50,704
You're very thin.
Doesn't your wife feed you?

796
01:17:50,705 --> 01:17:55,505
Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me like a goose all day!

797
01:17:56,127 --> 01:18:00,047
- Is she not here?
- No, she had to help her mother.

798
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:02,049
She's like that.

799
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:05,643
Her mother's a very
sweet woman, you'Il...

800
01:18:13,019 --> 01:18:16,711
I didn't know you were home.

801
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:19,943
Stanzi, this is my father.

802
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:25,864
We'll wait. We'll wait.

803
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:30,900
Why don't you get up now, my darling?

804
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:41,260
She's very tired, poor creature.
You know me. I'm such a pig.

805
01:18:41,298 --> 01:18:44,744
It's not easy cleaning up after me.

806
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:47,303
Don't you have a maid?

807
01:18:47,304 --> 01:18:51,224
Oh. No. We could if we wanted...

808
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:56,021
...but Stanzi insists on doing
everything herself.

809
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:58,681
How is your...

810
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,819
...financial situation?

811
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,280
Couldn't be better.

812
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:07,032
That's not what I hear.

813
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:10,203
What do you mean? It's wonderful.

814
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:15,004
Really, it's marvelous!
People love me here.

815
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:18,253
They say you have debts.

816
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,026
Who?

817
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:22,507
Who says that?

818
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:25,051
That's a malicious lie!

819
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:27,661
Do you have pupils?

820
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:31,099
I don't want pupils!

821
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,954
They get in the way.

822
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:37,814
I have to have time for composition.

823
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:40,942
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.

824
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,257
That one will.

825
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,744
What's that?

826
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:48,784
It's a secret.

827
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:52,329
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.

828
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:58,047
No! Please! I don't want you to see it.
I don't want anyone to see it.

829
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:01,129
You'll be so proud of me.

830
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:05,930
It'll be the best thing I've
ever done. The best thing anyone...

831
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:09,514
There she is!

832
01:20:09,515 --> 01:20:13,893
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?
Now, Papa, confess it.

833
01:20:13,894 --> 01:20:18,694
- Could you want a prettier daughter?
- Stop it, Wolfie!

834
01:20:19,358 --> 01:20:21,869
I look dreadful.

835
01:20:22,654 --> 01:20:24,404
Are you...

836
01:20:24,405 --> 01:20:26,782
...expecting?

837
01:20:26,783 --> 01:20:31,458
- Yes, I am.
- Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.

838
01:20:31,704 --> 01:20:36,333
- May I offer you some tea?
- Who wants tea? Let's go out!

839
01:20:36,334 --> 01:20:40,337
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you?

840
01:20:40,338 --> 01:20:44,842
I know! Let's go dancing.
Papa loves parties, don't you?

841
01:20:44,843 --> 01:20:48,731
How can you be so boring? Tea!

842
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:54,518
Come on, Papa. Hurry!

843
01:20:54,519 --> 01:20:56,635
Here we go. Good day.

844
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:40,809
Now!

845
01:21:46,155 --> 01:21:50,955
I name the penalty!
I name the penalty!

846
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:54,581
And the penalty is...

847
01:21:54,582 --> 01:21:59,382
- Give her a good one!
- Show us your legs!

848
01:22:03,049 --> 01:22:05,756
Come on, come on!

849
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:21,039
It's just a game, Papa.

850
01:22:33,329 --> 01:22:35,297
Thank you.

851
01:22:59,606 --> 01:23:04,406
<i>Herr Mozart, why don't you
name your son's penalty?!</i>

852
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:09,657
Yes, Papa. Name it.

853
01:23:09,658 --> 01:23:14,458
Name it. I'll do anything
you say. Anything.

854
01:23:15,331 --> 01:23:19,418
I want you to come back
to Salzburg with me.

855
01:23:19,419 --> 01:23:23,172
The penalty must be
performed in the room.

856
01:23:23,173 --> 01:23:25,436
I'm tired of this game.

857
01:23:25,508 --> 01:23:30,308
But my penalty!
I've got to have a penalty!

858
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,201
I name a penalty!

859
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:41,314
The penalty is...

860
01:23:41,609 --> 01:23:44,027
...you shall play our tune...

861
01:23:44,028 --> 01:23:48,828
...in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach!

862
01:24:15,559 --> 01:24:19,005
- Turn him over!
- Over?!

863
01:24:20,439 --> 01:24:23,688
Now you play it backwards!

864
01:24:50,596 --> 01:24:55,308
- Another one! Give me another one!
- Play it like Gluck!

865
01:24:55,309 --> 01:24:58,270
- Boring. Another!
- Handel!

866
01:24:58,271 --> 01:25:01,174
I don't like him! Another one!

867
01:25:01,232 --> 01:25:03,841
Play Salieri.

868
01:25:04,193 --> 01:25:08,238
Now that is a challenge!
That is a challenge.

869
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:11,488
Please! Please!

870
01:25:45,527 --> 01:25:48,923
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!

871
01:25:53,368 --> 01:25:56,454
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.

872
01:25:56,455 --> 01:25:58,289
That was God.

873
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:03,090
That was God laughing at me
through that obscene giggle.

874
01:26:06,216 --> 01:26:08,926
<i>Go on, Signore. Laugh.</i>

875
01:26:08,927 --> 01:26:13,727
Show my mediocrity for all to see.

876
01:26:14,516 --> 01:26:17,911
One day I will laugh at you.

877
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,608
Before I leave this earth...

878
01:26:23,609 --> 01:26:26,906
...I will laugh at you.

879
01:26:48,175 --> 01:26:51,326
- Wolfie?
- What?

880
01:26:51,887 --> 01:26:55,014
There's a young girl here to see you.

881
01:26:55,015 --> 01:26:56,724
What does she want?

882
01:26:56,725 --> 01:27:01,525
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.

883
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:04,461
Damn.

884
01:27:09,113 --> 01:27:10,639
Yes?

885
01:27:12,283 --> 01:27:15,727
<i>- Are you Herr Mozart?
- That's right.</i>

886
01:27:16,997 --> 01:27:21,041
My name is Lorl, sir.
I'm a maidservant.

887
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:25,212
I was asked to come here
and offer my services to you.

888
01:27:25,213 --> 01:27:30,013
They'll be paid for by an admirer
of yours who wishes to remain...

889
01:27:30,594 --> 01:27:32,908
...anonymous.

890
01:27:33,222 --> 01:27:36,618
Is this your idea, Papa?

891
01:27:37,059 --> 01:27:38,518
Mine?

892
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:43,319
- Are you playing a trick on me?
- I've never seen this girl.

893
01:27:43,775 --> 01:27:47,611
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Not at all, sir.

894
01:27:47,612 --> 01:27:50,197
Young woman, this won't do.

895
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:54,826
My son can't accept such an offer,
no matter how generous...

896
01:27:54,827 --> 01:27:59,539
...unless he knows who's behind it.
- I can't tell you that, sir.

897
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,959
- This is ridiculous!
- What is ridiculous?

898
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,879
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.

899
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,840
People send us gifts all the time.

900
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:12,094
You cannot accept her
without references.

901
01:28:12,095 --> 01:28:15,264
Well, this is none of your business.

902
01:28:15,265 --> 01:28:19,227
- Whoever sent you is going to pay?
- That's right.

903
01:28:19,228 --> 01:28:23,815
Splendid! Now we're going
to let a stranger into our house.

904
01:28:23,816 --> 01:28:27,555
Who is we? Who is letting who...?

905
01:28:30,572 --> 01:28:34,700
- Could you please wait outside?
- Yes, ma'am.

906
01:28:34,701 --> 01:28:36,244
Look, old man!

907
01:28:36,245 --> 01:28:40,957
We spend a fortune on you,
and all you can do is criticize.

908
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:42,416
- And now...
- Stanzi!

909
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:47,130
No! It's right that he should hear!
I'm sick to death of it.

910
01:28:47,131 --> 01:28:50,842
We can't do anything
right for you, can we?

911
01:28:50,843 --> 01:28:54,887
You won't have to do anything
for me ever again.

912
01:28:54,888 --> 01:28:56,764
I'm leaving.

913
01:28:56,765 --> 01:29:00,102
- No, Papa.
- I won't stay and be a burden.

914
01:29:00,103 --> 01:29:02,229
No one calls you that.

915
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:05,900
She does. She says I sleep all day.

916
01:29:05,901 --> 01:29:08,027
And so you do!

917
01:29:08,028 --> 01:29:11,720
The only time you come out is to eat.

918
01:29:12,408 --> 01:29:15,065
Well, what do you expect?

919
01:29:16,871 --> 01:29:21,671
Do you expect anyone to walk out
into a mess like this every day?

920
01:29:21,917 --> 01:29:26,717
- So now I'm a bad housekeeper!
- So you are. It's a pigsty.

921
01:29:26,922 --> 01:29:29,340
When can you start?

922
01:29:29,341 --> 01:29:31,950
- Right away, ma'am.
- Good.

923
01:29:58,705 --> 01:30:01,954
They're out every night, sir.

924
01:30:03,835 --> 01:30:06,197
Thank you, sir.

925
01:30:06,421 --> 01:30:10,162
Do any pupils come to the house?

926
01:30:11,635 --> 01:30:13,886
Not that I've seen.

927
01:30:13,887 --> 01:30:17,184
Then how does he pay for all this?

928
01:30:17,682 --> 01:30:20,226
Does he work at all?

929
01:30:20,227 --> 01:30:25,027
Yes, sir. All day long. He never
leaves the house till evening.

930
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:29,611
He just sits there,
writing and writing.

931
01:30:29,612 --> 01:30:31,728
Really?

932
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:35,447
What is it he's writing?

933
01:30:38,037 --> 01:30:40,789
I wouldn't know that, sir.

934
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:42,791
Of course not.

935
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:45,001
You're a good girl.

936
01:30:45,002 --> 01:30:47,629
You're very kind to do this.

937
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:52,430
The next time you're sure they'll
be out of the house, let me know.

938
01:30:59,143 --> 01:31:02,145
Thank you, sir.

939
01:32:40,956 --> 01:32:44,942
I think I found out
about the money, sir.

940
01:32:45,127 --> 01:32:47,878
Yes? What?

941
01:32:47,879 --> 01:32:52,679
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.

942
01:32:53,343 --> 01:32:55,594
And now look.

943
01:32:55,595 --> 01:32:58,105
There's only one left.

944
01:32:58,807 --> 01:33:01,661
Where does he work?

945
01:33:02,727 --> 01:33:05,386
In there, sir.

946
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:54,280
Gentlemen, I've just
heard some news...

947
01:33:54,281 --> 01:33:57,533
...that may interest you.
- What?

948
01:33:57,534 --> 01:34:02,334
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.

949
01:34:02,414 --> 01:34:04,973
Italian?

950
01:34:05,334 --> 01:34:10,134
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.

951
01:34:10,214 --> 01:34:13,216
<i>The Marriage of Figaro.</i>

952
01:34:13,217 --> 01:34:17,178
He's setting that play to music?

953
01:34:17,179 --> 01:34:18,655
Yes.

954
01:34:19,681 --> 01:34:23,351
<i>What is this Marriage of Figaro?</i>

955
01:34:23,352 --> 01:34:27,021
It's a French play, Kapellmeister.

956
01:34:27,022 --> 01:34:30,442
It has been banned by the emperor.

957
01:34:30,443 --> 01:34:32,855
You're absolutely sure?

958
01:34:36,074 --> 01:34:38,829
<i>Herr Mozart.</i>

959
01:34:39,369 --> 01:34:41,879
Gentlemen, sit down.

960
01:34:46,293 --> 01:34:48,262
Mozart.

961
01:34:49,213 --> 01:34:53,675
<i>Are you aware that I have declared
the French play Figaro...</i>

962
01:34:53,676 --> 01:34:57,072
...unsuitable for our theater?

963
01:34:57,721 --> 01:34:59,722
Yes, sire.

964
01:34:59,723 --> 01:35:04,523
Yet we hear you're making an
opera from it. Is this true?

965
01:35:08,524 --> 01:35:10,942
Who told you this, Majesty?

966
01:35:10,943 --> 01:35:15,743
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?

967
01:35:15,823 --> 01:35:18,185
Yes, I...

968
01:35:18,242 --> 01:35:20,949
I admit it is.

969
01:35:22,622 --> 01:35:25,625
Would you tell me why?

970
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:29,879
Majesty, it is only a comedy.

971
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:32,882
What you think is scarcely the point.

972
01:35:32,883 --> 01:35:36,969
It's what His Majesty thinks
that counts.

973
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:39,221
But, Your Majesty...

974
01:35:39,222 --> 01:35:41,307
Mozart...

975
01:35:41,308 --> 01:35:43,726
...I am a tolerant man.

976
01:35:43,727 --> 01:35:48,527
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.

977
01:35:49,524 --> 01:35:53,068
<i>Figaro is a bad play.</i>

978
01:35:53,153 --> 01:35:56,071
It stirs up hatred between classes.

979
01:35:56,072 --> 01:35:59,325
In France, it has caused
only bitterness.

980
01:35:59,326 --> 01:36:04,126
My sister Antoinette is beginning
to be frightened of her own people.

981
01:36:04,873 --> 01:36:08,667
I swear, there's nothing
like that in the piece.

982
01:36:08,668 --> 01:36:13,468
I've taken out everything that could
give offense. I hate politics.

983
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:16,552
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.

984
01:36:16,553 --> 01:36:21,353
In these dangerous times I cannot
afford to provoke our people...

985
01:36:21,892 --> 01:36:24,435
...simply over a theater piece.

986
01:36:24,436 --> 01:36:29,236
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
A piece about love.

987
01:36:29,691 --> 01:36:32,053
"Love." Again!

988
01:36:32,069 --> 01:36:33,945
And it's new!

989
01:36:33,946 --> 01:36:38,199
It's entirely new.
The people will go mad for it.

990
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,857
I have scenes...

991
01:36:41,203 --> 01:36:43,913
The end of Act II, for example.

992
01:36:43,914 --> 01:36:48,126
It starts as a duet.
A husband and wife quarreling.

993
01:36:48,127 --> 01:36:52,927
Suddenly, the scheming maid comes in.
It's a very funny situation.

994
01:36:53,465 --> 01:36:55,508
Duet turns into trio.

995
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:58,594
Then the husband's valet comes in.

996
01:36:58,595 --> 01:37:00,596
Trio turns into quartet.

997
01:37:00,597 --> 01:37:03,766
Then a gardener.
Quartet becomes quintet.

998
01:37:03,767 --> 01:37:05,977
And so on, on and on.

999
01:37:05,978 --> 01:37:08,771
Sextet, septet, octet.

1000
01:37:08,772 --> 01:37:13,203
How long do you think
I can sustain that?

1001
01:37:13,319 --> 01:37:14,987
I have no idea.

1002
01:37:14,988 --> 01:37:16,612
Guess.

1003
01:37:17,323 --> 01:37:18,991
Guess, Your Majesty.

1004
01:37:18,992 --> 01:37:23,792
Imagine the longest time
it could be sustained, then double it.

1005
01:37:24,831 --> 01:37:26,799
Well...

1006
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,764
Six...

1007
01:37:30,295 --> 01:37:32,952
...seven minutes?

1008
01:37:35,258 --> 01:37:39,888
- Eight minutes?
- Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes!

1009
01:37:39,889 --> 01:37:44,684
Twenty minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!

1010
01:37:44,685 --> 01:37:47,270
Sire, only opera can do this.

1011
01:37:47,271 --> 01:37:51,399
In a play, if more than one person
speaks at once...

1012
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,568
...it's just noise.

1013
01:37:53,569 --> 01:37:56,321
But with opera, with music...

1014
01:37:56,322 --> 01:38:00,700
...you can have 20 individuals
all talking at the same time.

1015
01:38:00,701 --> 01:38:04,121
It's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony!

1016
01:38:04,122 --> 01:38:07,458
Mozart, music is not the issue here.

1017
01:38:07,459 --> 01:38:12,259
No one doubts your talent. It's your
literary judgment that's in question.

1018
01:38:12,964 --> 01:38:17,764
Even with the politics taken out,
it would still remain a vulgar farce.

1019
01:38:19,221 --> 01:38:22,264
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

1020
01:38:22,265 --> 01:38:26,519
Surely you can choose more
elevated themes.

1021
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,897
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?

1022
01:38:29,898 --> 01:38:33,859
I am fed to the teeth with these...

1023
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:37,321
...elevated things. Old dead legends.

1024
01:38:37,322 --> 01:38:41,659
Why must we go on forever
writing of gods and legends?

1025
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:44,022
Because they do.

1026
01:38:44,162 --> 01:38:47,116
They go on forever.

1027
01:38:47,415 --> 01:38:51,585
At least what they represent:
The eternal in us.

1028
01:38:51,586 --> 01:38:54,547
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.

1029
01:38:54,548 --> 01:38:59,348
You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.

1030
01:39:01,931 --> 01:39:06,731
<i>"Bello, bello, bello."
Come on now, be honest!</i>

1031
01:39:06,895 --> 01:39:11,695
You'd rather listen to your hairdresser
than Hercules, Horatius or Orpheus.

1032
01:39:12,776 --> 01:39:17,550
People so lofty, they sound
as if they shit marble!

1033
01:39:17,614 --> 01:39:19,632
What!

1034
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:24,473
Govern your tongue, Mozart!
How dare you!

1035
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:31,554
Forgive me, Majesty.

1036
01:39:32,254 --> 01:39:34,881
I'm a vulgar man...

1037
01:39:34,882 --> 01:39:38,671
...but I assure you, my music is not.

1038
01:39:41,722 --> 01:39:45,141
You are passionate, Mozart...

1039
01:39:45,142 --> 01:39:49,817
...but you do not persuade.

1040
01:39:51,608 --> 01:39:55,694
Sire, the whole opera is finished.

1041
01:39:55,695 --> 01:39:59,239
Do you know how much work
went into it?

1042
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:04,040
<i>His Majesty has been
more than patient, Signore.</i>

1043
01:40:05,747 --> 01:40:09,208
How can I persuade if I can't show it?

1044
01:40:09,209 --> 01:40:12,801
<i>That will do, Herr Mozart.</i>

1045
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:17,216
Just let me tell you how it begins.

1046
01:40:17,217 --> 01:40:21,793
May I just do that, Majesty?
Show you how it begins? Just that?

1047
01:40:26,601 --> 01:40:28,225
Please.

1048
01:40:28,978 --> 01:40:31,064
Look...

1049
01:40:31,065 --> 01:40:34,734
There's a servant on his knees.
Do you know why?

1050
01:40:34,735 --> 01:40:38,363
Not from oppression.
He's measuring a space.

1051
01:40:38,364 --> 01:40:40,615
Do you know what for?

1052
01:40:40,616 --> 01:40:43,535
His bed. His wedding bed.

1053
01:40:43,536 --> 01:40:46,244
To see if it will fit!

1054
01:40:54,464 --> 01:40:56,384
Late.

1055
01:40:58,009 --> 01:40:59,929
Late!

1056
01:41:00,053 --> 01:41:01,887
On the beat.

1057
01:41:01,888 --> 01:41:03,857
Good!

1058
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,569
Yes!

1059
01:41:13,733 --> 01:41:15,702
Early!

1060
01:41:19,656 --> 01:41:24,086
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.

1061
01:41:28,498 --> 01:41:32,337
In that case, gentlemen, I think...

1062
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:39,620
I think we should help
Mozart all we can.

1063
01:41:42,305 --> 01:41:45,765
And protect him against
the emperor's anger.

1064
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,851
What anger?

1065
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:50,509
About the ballet.

1066
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:53,569
What ballet?

1067
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:56,027
Excuse me...

1068
01:41:56,028 --> 01:42:00,828
...but didn't His Majesty specifically
forbid the ballet in his opera?

1069
01:42:38,321 --> 01:42:40,864
<i>- Herr Mozart!
- Yes?</i>

1070
01:42:40,865 --> 01:42:44,201
<i>- A word with you.
- Certainly, Herr Direktor.</i>

1071
01:42:44,202 --> 01:42:46,417
<i>Now, Herr Mozart!</i>

1072
01:42:47,038 --> 01:42:49,081
Five minutes, please.

1073
01:42:49,082 --> 01:42:50,706
Five minutes!

1074
01:42:52,085 --> 01:42:53,544
Yes?

1075
01:42:53,545 --> 01:42:58,345
Do you not know that His Majesty has
expressly forbidden ballet in operas?

1076
01:42:59,509 --> 01:43:04,309
- It's not a ballet, it's a dance.
- Exactly. A dance.

1077
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:09,439
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean
no dancing when it's in the story.

1078
01:43:09,519 --> 01:43:14,319
It's dangerous to interpret his
edicts. Give me your score, please.

1079
01:43:23,868 --> 01:43:25,886
Thank you.

1080
01:43:28,748 --> 01:43:31,959
<i>What are you doing, Herr Direktor?</i>

1081
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:36,242
Taking out what you should
never have put in.

1082
01:43:36,715 --> 01:43:39,800
Please. Please!

1083
01:43:39,801 --> 01:43:42,470
I have no one else to turn to.

1084
01:43:42,471 --> 01:43:45,347
- What is it?
- It's unbelievable.

1085
01:43:45,348 --> 01:43:49,727
<i>The direktor has torn up
a huge section of my music.</i>

1086
01:43:49,728 --> 01:43:53,517
They say I have to rewrite the opera.

1087
01:43:53,565 --> 01:43:56,275
But it's perfect as it is.

1088
01:43:56,276 --> 01:43:57,735
I can't...

1089
01:43:57,736 --> 01:44:00,787
...rewrite what's perfect.

1090
01:44:02,115 --> 01:44:03,699
Please.

1091
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:06,505
Can't you talk to him?

1092
01:44:06,578 --> 01:44:08,037
Please.

1093
01:44:08,038 --> 01:44:11,040
Why bother?
He's no friend of yours.

1094
01:44:11,041 --> 01:44:15,421
I could kill him!
I mean, really! Kill him!

1095
01:44:16,755 --> 01:44:21,091
I threw the entire score into
the fire, he made me so angry.

1096
01:44:21,092 --> 01:44:25,892
- You burned the score?
- No, my wife took it out in time.

1097
01:44:27,975 --> 01:44:29,600
Thank God.

1098
01:44:31,062 --> 01:44:35,862
It's unfair that a man like that
should have power over our work!

1099
01:44:37,443 --> 01:44:41,430
But there are those
who have power over him.

1100
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:46,476
I think I'll take this up
with the emperor.

1101
01:44:47,787 --> 01:44:49,497
Excellency...

1102
01:44:49,498 --> 01:44:50,974
...would you?

1103
01:44:52,417 --> 01:44:55,813
With all my heart, Mozart.

1104
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:59,090
Thank you.

1105
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:03,891
<i>Please, Herr Mozart.
"Please, it's not a holy relic."</i>

1106
01:45:06,265 --> 01:45:11,065
I don't need to tell you I said
nothing, whatever, to the emperor.

1107
01:45:11,228 --> 01:45:16,028
I went to the theater to tell
Mozart something, anything...

1108
01:45:17,443 --> 01:45:22,243
<i>... when suddenly,
in the middle of the third act...</i>

1109
01:45:22,365 --> 01:45:25,742
<i>... to my astonishment, the emperor...</i>

1110
01:45:25,743 --> 01:45:30,543
<i>... who never attended rehearsals,
suddenly appeared.</i>

1111
01:45:49,017 --> 01:45:51,527
What is this?

1112
01:45:53,605 --> 01:45:55,918
I don't understand.

1113
01:45:56,608 --> 01:45:58,281
Is it modern?

1114
01:45:59,068 --> 01:46:01,028
Majesty...

1115
01:46:01,029 --> 01:46:02,946
<i>...the Herr Direktor...</i>

1116
01:46:02,947 --> 01:46:06,074
<i>...he has removed un balletto...</i>

1117
01:46:06,075 --> 01:46:10,875
...that would have occurred
at this place.

1118
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:13,263
Why?

1119
01:46:13,292 --> 01:46:15,669
It is your regulation, sire.

1120
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:19,263
No ballet in your opera.

1121
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:26,538
Salieri.

1122
01:46:27,599 --> 01:46:29,617
Do you like this?

1123
01:46:31,728 --> 01:46:35,731
It's not a question
of liking, Majesty.

1124
01:46:35,732 --> 01:46:39,325
Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

1125
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:43,186
Well, look at them!

1126
01:46:44,908 --> 01:46:48,327
No! This is nonsense!

1127
01:46:48,328 --> 01:46:52,581
- Let me see the scene with the music.
- But, sire!

1128
01:46:52,582 --> 01:46:54,250
Oblige me!

1129
01:46:54,251 --> 01:46:56,662
Yes, Majesty.

1130
01:47:05,346 --> 01:47:08,849
Can we see the scene
with the music, please?

1131
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:12,786
<i>Certainly! Certainly, Herr Direktor!</i>

1132
01:47:17,775 --> 01:47:21,024
Bring the palace set back in, please.

1133
01:47:58,610 --> 01:48:00,527
The restored third act...

1134
01:48:00,528 --> 01:48:03,382
...was bold, brilliant.

1135
01:48:03,781 --> 01:48:06,143
The fourth...

1136
01:48:08,244 --> 01:48:10,558
...was astounding.

1137
01:48:18,254 --> 01:48:19,922
<i>I saw a woman...</i>

1138
01:48:19,923 --> 01:48:24,723
<i>... disguised in her maid's clothes
hear her husband speak the first...</i>

1139
01:48:25,929 --> 01:48:29,556
<i>... tender words he has
offered her in years.</i>

1140
01:48:29,557 --> 01:48:34,357
<i>Simply because he thinks
she is someone else.</i>

1141
01:48:34,938 --> 01:48:39,738
<i>I heard the music of true forgiveness
filling the theater...</i>

1142
01:48:40,610 --> 01:48:45,410
<i>... conferring on all who sat there,
perfect absolution.</i>

1143
01:48:45,865 --> 01:48:49,243
<i>God was singing through
this little man...</i>

1144
01:48:49,244 --> 01:48:52,247
<i>... to all the world.</i>

1145
01:48:52,414 --> 01:48:54,582
<i>Unstoppable.</i>

1146
01:48:54,583 --> 01:48:59,383
<i>Making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar.</i>

1147
01:49:38,211 --> 01:49:41,460
And then, do you know what happened?

1148
01:49:44,134 --> 01:49:46,005
A miracle!

1149
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:54,435
<i>With that yawn...</i>

1150
01:49:54,604 --> 01:49:59,279
<i>... I saw my defeat
turn into a victory.</i>

1151
01:50:02,361 --> 01:50:06,364
<i>Mozart was lucky
the emperor yawned only once.</i>

1152
01:50:06,365 --> 01:50:08,033
<i>Three yawns...</i>

1153
01:50:08,034 --> 01:50:11,286
...and the opera
would fail the same night.

1154
01:50:11,287 --> 01:50:14,831
Two yawns, within a week at most.

1155
01:50:14,832 --> 01:50:19,632
With one yawn, the composer
could still get...

1156
01:50:21,506 --> 01:50:26,306
Nine performances! Nine!
That's all it's had! Withdrawn!

1157
01:50:26,511 --> 01:50:29,054
I know, I know.

1158
01:50:29,055 --> 01:50:31,122
It's outrageous.

1159
01:50:32,433 --> 01:50:36,521
Still, if the public
doesn't like one's work...

1160
01:50:36,522 --> 01:50:39,274
...one has to accept
the fact gracefully.

1161
01:50:39,275 --> 01:50:42,861
But what is it that they don't like?

1162
01:50:42,862 --> 01:50:45,447
I can speak for the emperor.

1163
01:50:45,448 --> 01:50:48,867
You make too many demands
on the royal ear.

1164
01:50:48,868 --> 01:50:53,668
The poor man can't concentrate for
more than an hour. You gave him four.

1165
01:50:59,504 --> 01:51:02,548
What did you think of it yourself?

1166
01:51:02,549 --> 01:51:05,501
Did you like it at all?

1167
01:51:06,636 --> 01:51:09,471
I thought it was marvelous.

1168
01:51:09,472 --> 01:51:13,433
Of course.
It's the best opera yet written.

1169
01:51:13,434 --> 01:51:15,304
I know it!

1170
01:51:17,897 --> 01:51:19,964
Why didn't they come?

1171
01:51:22,485 --> 01:51:26,405
I think you overestimate
our dear Viennese, friend.

1172
01:51:26,406 --> 01:51:30,117
You didn't give them a bang
at the end of songs...

1173
01:51:30,118 --> 01:51:33,022
...to let them know when to clap.

1174
01:51:33,330 --> 01:51:35,999
I know, I know.

1175
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,084
Maybe you should give me
some lessons in that.

1176
01:51:40,504 --> 01:51:43,458
I wouldn't presume.

1177
01:51:46,135 --> 01:51:49,387
Nevertheless,
at the risk of imposing...

1178
01:51:49,388 --> 01:51:52,932
...I'd like you to see my new piece.

1179
01:51:53,684 --> 01:51:56,060
It would be an honor for me.

1180
01:51:56,061 --> 01:51:59,212
No, the honor would be all mine.

1181
01:53:24,903 --> 01:53:26,874
I believe...

1182
01:53:27,949 --> 01:53:29,950
I believe...

1183
01:53:29,951 --> 01:53:34,626
...it is the best opera
yet written, my friends.

1184
01:53:35,999 --> 01:53:37,918
Salieri!

1185
01:53:39,043 --> 01:53:43,297
You are the brightest star
in the musical firmament.

1186
01:53:43,298 --> 01:53:47,432
You do honor to Vienna and to me.

1187
01:54:13,411 --> 01:54:15,084
<i>Herr Mozart!</i>

1188
01:54:15,664 --> 01:54:19,083
- It was good of you to come.
- How could I not?

1189
01:54:19,084 --> 01:54:21,446
Bravo, maestro.

1190
01:54:22,213 --> 01:54:25,559
Did my work please you?

1191
01:54:26,467 --> 01:54:31,142
I never knew that music
like that was possible.

1192
01:54:31,639 --> 01:54:34,838
- You flatter me.
- No.

1193
01:54:35,267 --> 01:54:37,852
One hears such sounds...

1194
01:54:37,853 --> 01:54:41,889
...and what can one say but: Salieri!

1195
01:54:48,656 --> 01:54:53,456
Everybody's here and we've got guests.
Bravo! Well, I've got some more.

1196
01:54:54,454 --> 01:54:58,415
You remember my good
friend Schikaneder. Come in.

1197
01:54:58,416 --> 01:54:59,917
Don't be shy.

1198
01:54:59,918 --> 01:55:04,718
- This is a very nice girl, and this...
- Wolfie?

1199
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:07,543
Yes, my love?

1200
01:55:07,634 --> 01:55:11,868
- These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
- Salzburg?

1201
01:55:12,473 --> 01:55:15,819
We were just talking about Salzburg.

1202
01:55:17,645 --> 01:55:20,599
Your father is dead.

1203
01:55:42,587 --> 01:55:45,422
So rose the dreadful ghost...

1204
01:55:45,423 --> 01:55:50,223
...from his next and blackest opera.

1205
01:55:55,057 --> 01:55:59,644
<i>There on the stage,
stood the figure of a dead commander.</i>

1206
01:55:59,645 --> 01:56:01,438
I knew...

1207
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:03,399
...only I understood...

1208
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:06,944
...that the horrifying apparition
was Leopold...

1209
01:56:06,945 --> 01:56:08,914
...raised from the dead!

1210
01:56:38,186 --> 01:56:42,397
Wolfgang had actually
summoned up his own father...

1211
01:56:42,398 --> 01:56:46,778
...to accuse his son
before all the world!

1212
01:56:47,445 --> 01:56:49,530
It was...

1213
01:56:49,531 --> 01:56:53,567
...terrifying and wonderful to watch.

1214
01:57:57,059 --> 01:57:58,831
And now...

1215
01:58:04,025 --> 01:58:07,716
...the madness began in me.

1216
01:58:09,405 --> 01:58:13,588
The madness of a man
splitting in half.

1217
01:58:16,454 --> 01:58:19,372
Through my influence, I saw to it...

1218
01:58:19,373 --> 01:58:23,460
<i>... Don Giovanni was played
only five times in Vienna.</i>

1219
01:58:23,461 --> 01:58:28,261
But, in secret,
I went to every one of those five.

1220
01:58:28,299 --> 01:58:33,099
<i>Worshiping sound
I alone seemed to hear.</i>

1221
01:59:19,894 --> 01:59:23,564
<i>And as I stood there,
understanding how...</i>

1222
01:59:23,565 --> 01:59:27,359
...that bitter old man was
still possessing his poor son...

1223
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,279
<i>... even from beyond the grave...</i>

1224
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:32,406
<i>... I began to see a way...</i>

1225
01:59:32,407 --> 01:59:34,408
<i>... a terrible way...</i>

1226
01:59:34,409 --> 01:59:37,578
...I could finally triumph...

1227
01:59:37,579 --> 01:59:39,696
...over God.

1228
02:02:49,443 --> 02:02:51,461
<i>Herr Mozart?</i>

1229
02:02:54,114 --> 02:02:57,806
I have come to commission
work from you.

1230
02:02:58,619 --> 02:03:03,206
- What work?
- A Mass for the dead.

1231
02:03:03,207 --> 02:03:05,520
What dead?

1232
02:03:05,584 --> 02:03:07,877
Who is dead?

1233
02:03:07,878 --> 02:03:12,678
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass
and never got one.

1234
02:03:12,758 --> 02:03:16,512
- Who are you?
- I am only a messenger.

1235
02:03:16,513 --> 02:03:19,014
Do you accept?

1236
02:03:19,015 --> 02:03:21,869
You will be well paid.

1237
02:03:28,984 --> 02:03:31,643
Do you accept?

1238
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:43,498
Work fast.

1239
02:03:43,499 --> 02:03:46,459
And be sure tell no one what you do.

1240
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:49,414
You will see me again soon.

1241
02:04:25,417 --> 02:04:27,140
Wolfie?

1242
02:04:38,055 --> 02:04:41,401
My plan was so simple...

1243
02:04:41,934 --> 02:04:44,886
...that it terrified me.

1244
02:04:46,522 --> 02:04:51,197
First, I must get the death Mass,
and then...

1245
02:04:52,444 --> 02:04:56,037
...I must achieve his death.

1246
02:04:56,990 --> 02:04:58,961
What?

1247
02:04:59,452 --> 02:05:01,962
His funeral!

1248
02:05:02,413 --> 02:05:03,915
Imagine it!

1249
02:05:03,916 --> 02:05:07,252
The cathedral,
all Vienna sitting there.

1250
02:05:07,253 --> 02:05:12,053
His coffin.
Mozart's little coffin in the middle.

1251
02:05:13,259 --> 02:05:15,277
And then...

1252
02:05:15,636 --> 02:05:18,293
...in that silence...

1253
02:05:20,057 --> 02:05:22,370
...music.

1254
02:05:23,310 --> 02:05:25,812
A divine music...

1255
02:05:25,813 --> 02:05:29,257
...bursts out over them all.

1256
02:05:29,358 --> 02:05:33,738
A great Mass of death.

1257
02:05:34,363 --> 02:05:38,533
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.

1258
02:05:38,534 --> 02:05:43,204
Composed by his devoted friend...

1259
02:05:43,205 --> 02:05:46,454
...Antonio Salieri.

1260
02:05:46,917 --> 02:05:48,835
What sublimity!

1261
02:05:48,836 --> 02:05:51,629
What depth!

1262
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:55,273
What passion in the music!

1263
02:05:55,426 --> 02:05:59,555
Salieri has been touched
by God at last...

1264
02:05:59,556 --> 02:06:02,657
...and God forced to listen!

1265
02:06:03,643 --> 02:06:07,396
Powerless to stop it!

1266
02:06:07,397 --> 02:06:11,482
I, for once, in the end,
laughing at him!

1267
02:06:18,283 --> 02:06:22,786
The only thing that worried me
was the actual killing.

1268
02:06:22,787 --> 02:06:25,594
How does one do that?

1269
02:06:25,917 --> 02:06:29,214
How does one kill a man?

1270
02:06:29,921 --> 02:06:32,130
It's one thing...

1271
02:06:32,131 --> 02:06:34,716
...to dream about it.

1272
02:06:34,717 --> 02:06:38,556
Very different when you...

1273
02:06:40,306 --> 02:06:43,111
When you have to do it...

1274
02:06:45,269 --> 02:06:48,123
...with your own hands.

1275
02:06:57,199 --> 02:07:00,496
Come in!

1276
02:07:15,509 --> 02:07:20,304
<i>I've come to dinner</i>

1277
02:07:20,305 --> 02:07:23,307
Dinner! Are you mad?
I'm a nobleman!

1278
02:07:23,308 --> 02:07:26,978
I only ever dine
with people of my own height!

1279
02:07:26,979 --> 02:07:29,045
Stop it!

1280
02:07:29,439 --> 02:07:31,774
<i>Be careful
Be careful</i>

1281
02:07:31,775 --> 02:07:35,152
<i>Hold tight</i>

1282
02:07:35,153 --> 02:07:37,613
<i>I'm a famous...</i>

1283
02:07:37,614 --> 02:07:40,616
<i>... horseman</i>

1284
02:07:40,617 --> 02:07:45,417
<i>And we're a famous horsy</i>

1285
02:07:46,958 --> 02:07:51,129
<i>Give me a hoof, my darling</i>

1286
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:55,930
<i>And I'll give you my heart</i>

1287
02:07:56,510 --> 02:08:01,222
<i>Take me to your stable</i>

1288
02:08:01,223 --> 02:08:05,111
<i>And never more we'll part</i>

1289
02:08:11,609 --> 02:08:15,201
<i>Kill me
Kill me</i>

1290
02:08:35,966 --> 02:08:40,766
<i>We're going to make a soprano stew</i>

1291
02:08:41,014 --> 02:08:45,814
<i>We're going to make a soprano stew</i>

1292
02:08:45,894 --> 02:08:49,855
<i>And when you make a soprano stew</i>

1293
02:08:49,856 --> 02:08:51,941
Shut up!

1294
02:08:51,942 --> 02:08:55,141
I'm sick to death of that tune!

1295
02:09:13,588 --> 02:09:17,425
<i>Give me some hay, my darling</i>

1296
02:09:17,426 --> 02:09:21,179
<i>And I'll give you my heart</i>

1297
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:23,789
Leporello! Some hay!

1298
02:10:14,276 --> 02:10:16,569
<i>We hope...</i>

1299
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:21,370
<i>... you're contented</i>

1300
02:10:22,034 --> 02:10:24,869
<i>With what...</i>

1301
02:10:24,870 --> 02:10:29,670
<i>... we've presented</i>

1302
02:10:29,876 --> 02:10:34,676
<i>And love our dove of peace</i>

1303
02:11:01,742 --> 02:11:04,702
- What did you think?
- It was wonderful!

1304
02:11:04,703 --> 02:11:09,503
- He liked the little people.
- It's all in good fun.

1305
02:11:10,084 --> 02:11:12,741
I liked the horse.

1306
02:11:23,265 --> 02:11:27,351
<i>I tell you, if you played
Don Giovanni here...</i>

1307
02:11:27,352 --> 02:11:30,521
...you would've had
a wonderful success.

1308
02:11:30,522 --> 02:11:32,481
You belong here.

1309
02:11:32,482 --> 02:11:36,902
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.

1310
02:11:36,903 --> 02:11:41,703
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want: Fantasy.

1311
02:11:41,908 --> 02:11:45,327
You write a proper part for me...

1312
02:11:45,328 --> 02:11:47,830
...a couple of catchy songs...

1313
02:11:47,831 --> 02:11:52,631
...I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!

1314
02:11:52,836 --> 02:11:57,636
- What do you say?
- How much will you pay him?

1315
02:11:58,884 --> 02:12:03,115
Well! I see you brought
your manager with you.

1316
02:12:04,347 --> 02:12:06,682
Well, madame...

1317
02:12:06,683 --> 02:12:10,270
...how about half the receipts?

1318
02:12:10,271 --> 02:12:12,063
Half the receipts!

1319
02:12:12,064 --> 02:12:14,609
- Stanzi!
- I'm talking about now.

1320
02:12:14,610 --> 02:12:18,279
How much will you pay him now?
Down payment.

1321
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:20,642
Down payment?

1322
02:12:21,366 --> 02:12:25,550
Who do you think I am, the emperor?

1323
02:12:25,829 --> 02:12:27,622
I have to go.

1324
02:12:27,623 --> 02:12:31,314
Stay here, you'll enjoy this next one.

1325
02:12:32,294 --> 02:12:33,878
You won't do this.

1326
02:12:33,879 --> 02:12:36,464
- Why not? Half the house!
- When?

1327
02:12:36,465 --> 02:12:40,718
We need money now! He pays
you now, or you don't do it.

1328
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:42,553
I don't trust that man.

1329
02:12:42,554 --> 02:12:46,390
I don't like what he did
with your opera. It was common.

1330
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:49,602
You liked it. Monkey, punky, flunky!

1331
02:12:49,603 --> 02:12:51,354
Half the house.

1332
02:12:51,355 --> 02:12:55,650
You'll never see a penny.
I want it here in my hand.

1333
02:12:55,651 --> 02:12:59,529
- I'll put it here in your hand.
- Shut up!

1334
02:12:59,530 --> 02:13:04,205
You won't put a thing in my hand
until I see some money!

1335
02:13:04,743 --> 02:13:09,543
It's embarrassing. Can't you think of
anyone who can do something for him?

1336
02:13:09,999 --> 02:13:14,503
I'm afraid Mozart
is a lost cause, baron.

1337
02:13:14,504 --> 02:13:18,966
He has succeeded in alienating
practically the whole of Vienna.

1338
02:13:18,967 --> 02:13:21,051
He never pays his debts.

1339
02:13:21,052 --> 02:13:25,305
<i>I can 't think of anyone
to whom I'd dare recommend him.</i>

1340
02:13:25,306 --> 02:13:30,106
<i>Herr Mozart. What a surprise!</i>

1341
02:13:30,687 --> 02:13:33,394
What can I do for you?

1342
02:13:34,315 --> 02:13:39,115
Is my pupil still interested
in learning the art of music?

1343
02:13:40,364 --> 02:13:45,164
Your pupil is married
and living in Mannheim, young man.

1344
02:13:45,786 --> 02:13:47,804
Really?

1345
02:13:53,002 --> 02:13:57,802
Perhaps your dear wife might care
to profit from my instruction.

1346
02:13:59,091 --> 02:14:01,593
What is it, Mozart?

1347
02:14:01,594 --> 02:14:04,471
What's the matter with you?

1348
02:14:04,472 --> 02:14:06,223
Well...

1349
02:14:06,224 --> 02:14:11,024
...since it appears no one
is eager to hire my services...

1350
02:14:11,271 --> 02:14:15,701
...could you favor me
with a little money instead?

1351
02:14:18,069 --> 02:14:19,742
What for?

1352
02:14:21,072 --> 02:14:25,872
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

1353
02:14:28,622 --> 02:14:32,263
That's hardly the way to go about it.

1354
02:14:32,626 --> 02:14:36,212
You are right, sir. You are right.

1355
02:14:36,213 --> 02:14:40,883
But you see, I am endowed
with talent, and you with money.

1356
02:14:40,884 --> 02:14:43,010
If I offer mine...

1357
02:14:43,011 --> 02:14:46,160
...you should offer yours.

1358
02:14:48,850 --> 02:14:51,409
I'm sorry, no.

1359
02:14:53,813 --> 02:14:55,782
Please.

1360
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:00,411
My answer is no, Mozart.

1361
02:15:06,161 --> 02:15:08,376
Please.

1362
02:15:12,292 --> 02:15:14,851
Please!

1363
02:15:51,332 --> 02:15:53,842
Don't answer it.

1364
02:15:55,336 --> 02:15:57,305
Why?

1365
02:15:59,215 --> 02:16:01,282
Tell him...

1366
02:16:02,051 --> 02:16:04,660
Tell him I'm not here.

1367
02:16:04,679 --> 02:16:06,943
Tell him...

1368
02:16:07,599 --> 02:16:10,601
Tell him I'm working on it.

1369
02:16:11,144 --> 02:16:13,654
Come back later.

1370
02:16:29,413 --> 02:16:32,624
- Am I interrupting something?
- No.

1371
02:16:32,625 --> 02:16:35,668
Good. Where's our friend?

1372
02:16:35,669 --> 02:16:38,031
He's not here.

1373
02:16:38,172 --> 02:16:42,257
But he's working on it,
he told me to tell you.

1374
02:16:42,593 --> 02:16:44,907
Is that it?

1375
02:16:50,393 --> 02:16:53,347
Is he happy with it?

1376
02:16:55,899 --> 02:16:59,109
What's this? A Requiem Mass?

1377
02:16:59,110 --> 02:17:03,531
- You think I'm in the funeral business?
- Leave that alone!

1378
02:17:03,532 --> 02:17:08,285
- Put it down! It's nothing for you!
- I'm sorry.

1379
02:17:08,286 --> 02:17:10,648
What have you got for me?

1380
02:17:11,289 --> 02:17:13,209
Finished?

1381
02:17:14,292 --> 02:17:19,092
- What?
- The vaudeville, what do you think?

1382
02:17:19,506 --> 02:17:21,327
Yes.

1383
02:17:21,424 --> 02:17:23,983
- Can I see it?
- No.

1384
02:17:25,053 --> 02:17:27,012
Why not?

1385
02:17:27,013 --> 02:17:30,114
Because there's nothing to see.

1386
02:17:37,983 --> 02:17:39,805
Look...

1387
02:17:40,486 --> 02:17:45,286
...I asked you if we could start
rehearsals next week and you said yes.

1388
02:17:47,785 --> 02:17:52,585
- Well, we can.
- So let me see it. Where is it?

1389
02:17:52,957 --> 02:17:54,926
Here.

1390
02:17:55,544 --> 02:18:00,344
It's all right here in my noodle.
The rest is just scribbling.

1391
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:05,729
Scribbling and bibbling.
Bibbling and scribbling.

1392
02:18:08,056 --> 02:18:10,808
- Like a drink?
- Look, you little cunt!

1393
02:18:10,809 --> 02:18:13,686
Do you know how many
people I've hired?

1394
02:18:13,687 --> 02:18:16,397
- Leave him alone!
- I'm paying them!

1395
02:18:16,398 --> 02:18:20,902
- He's doing his best.
- Paying them to wait. It's ridiculous!

1396
02:18:20,903 --> 02:18:24,614
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto!

1397
02:18:24,615 --> 02:18:27,992
Only an idiot would ask him
to work on that!

1398
02:18:27,993 --> 02:18:30,745
Twelve-foot snakes, magic flutes?

1399
02:18:30,746 --> 02:18:33,832
What's so intelligent about a Requiem?

1400
02:18:33,833 --> 02:18:37,279
Money. Money.

1401
02:18:39,672 --> 02:18:41,789
You're mad.

1402
02:18:42,091 --> 02:18:43,814
She's mad.

1403
02:18:43,968 --> 02:18:48,347
- Oh, yes?
- Wolfie, write it down.

1404
02:18:48,348 --> 02:18:50,474
Just write it down.

1405
02:18:50,475 --> 02:18:52,768
On paper.

1406
02:18:52,769 --> 02:18:56,146
It's no use to anybody in your head.

1407
02:18:56,147 --> 02:19:00,692
To hell with your death Mass!

1408
02:19:00,693 --> 02:19:03,695
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?

1409
02:19:03,696 --> 02:19:07,634
- I won't work there anymore.
- What happened?

1410
02:19:08,243 --> 02:19:11,495
You don't know what it's like.

1411
02:19:11,496 --> 02:19:14,748
<i>Herr Mozart frightens me.</i>

1412
02:19:14,749 --> 02:19:16,750
He drinks all day...

1413
02:19:16,751 --> 02:19:20,671
...then takes all that medicine
and it makes him worse.

1414
02:19:20,672 --> 02:19:22,395
Is he working?

1415
02:19:23,926 --> 02:19:27,263
Oh, I am frightened, sir, really!

1416
02:19:27,264 --> 02:19:32,064
- When he speaks, he makes no sense.
- Is he working?

1417
02:19:34,062 --> 02:19:36,719
I suppose so.

1418
02:19:36,857 --> 02:19:41,657
He sits there all the time,
doing some silly opera.

1419
02:19:41,736 --> 02:19:45,114
- Opera?
- Don't ask me to go back again.

1420
02:19:45,115 --> 02:19:48,576
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!

1421
02:19:48,577 --> 02:19:52,316
Are you sure it's an opera?

1422
02:21:35,311 --> 02:21:38,362
I don't have it yet.

1423
02:21:38,439 --> 02:21:42,131
Are you neglecting my request?

1424
02:21:42,235 --> 02:21:45,926
No. No, I...

1425
02:21:46,197 --> 02:21:48,699
I promise you...

1426
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:53,425
...I'll give you a wonderful piece,
the best I ever...

1427
02:21:56,457 --> 02:22:00,335
This is my wife, Stanzi.

1428
02:22:00,336 --> 02:22:04,172
I've been sick,
but I'm all right now, aren't I?

1429
02:22:04,173 --> 02:22:06,466
Yes, sir. He's all right.

1430
02:22:06,467 --> 02:22:10,160
And he's working on it very hard.

1431
02:22:10,806 --> 02:22:14,685
Give me two more weeks. Please.

1432
02:22:14,686 --> 02:22:19,231
The sooner you finish,
the greater your reward.

1433
02:22:19,232 --> 02:22:21,644
Work.

1434
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:31,981
Wolfie.

1435
02:22:33,997 --> 02:22:37,688
I think you really are going mad.

1436
02:22:38,668 --> 02:22:43,464
You slave for that idiot actor
who won't give you a penny!

1437
02:22:43,465 --> 02:22:46,467
And here,
this is not a ghost!

1438
02:22:46,468 --> 02:22:51,193
This is a real man,
who puts down real money.

1439
02:22:52,474 --> 02:22:56,067
Why on earth won't you finish it?

1440
02:22:56,436 --> 02:23:00,964
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?

1441
02:23:02,318 --> 02:23:04,828
It's killing me.

1442
02:23:08,366 --> 02:23:10,867
You're drunk, aren't you?

1443
02:23:10,868 --> 02:23:14,461
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.

1444
02:23:16,707 --> 02:23:21,507
It's not fair.
I worry about you all the time.

1445
02:23:21,921 --> 02:23:25,507
I do everything I can to help you.

1446
02:23:25,508 --> 02:23:30,095
And all you do is drink
and talk nonsense, and frighten me.

1447
02:23:30,096 --> 02:23:33,048
Go back to bed!

1448
02:23:41,859 --> 02:23:43,728
Please.

1449
02:23:44,570 --> 02:23:49,146
Let me...
Let me sit here.

1450
02:23:51,451 --> 02:23:53,912
Let me stay here with you.

1451
02:26:27,153 --> 02:26:30,155
I did it.
And I was proud to do it.

1452
02:26:30,156 --> 02:26:34,327
"Leave! " I said. "Right away.
Take the child with you!

1453
02:26:34,328 --> 02:26:39,041
Go to the spa and get
your health back. " I was shocked."

1454
02:26:39,042 --> 02:26:42,044
Shocked to my foundation
when I saw her.

1455
02:26:42,045 --> 02:26:45,589
I couldn't believe my eyes,
poor little thing.

1456
02:26:45,590 --> 02:26:49,259
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?

1457
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:52,137
You and your music. I warned her.

1458
02:26:52,138 --> 02:26:55,182
"Choose a man, not a baby," I said.

1459
02:26:55,183 --> 02:26:59,983
"You marry him, you won't have a pot
to piss in. " You selfish thing!

1460
02:27:00,563 --> 02:27:05,363
Selfish, that's what you are.
Simply selfish! Do you hear me?

1461
02:30:48,589 --> 02:30:50,089
Pick him up.

1462
02:30:50,090 --> 02:30:52,108
Pick him up!

1463
02:30:53,803 --> 02:30:56,472
Be careful. Come with me.

1464
02:30:56,473 --> 02:30:58,589
You, follow me.

1465
02:31:25,878 --> 02:31:30,210
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over. It's over.

1466
02:31:31,008 --> 02:31:32,731
Go!

1467
02:32:14,344 --> 02:32:16,362
Go, go. Go.

1468
02:32:17,097 --> 02:32:19,313
Go! Go!

1469
02:32:47,879 --> 02:32:50,192
Where is your wife?

1470
02:32:53,009 --> 02:32:55,913
Where is your wife?

1471
02:32:57,806 --> 02:33:02,606
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.

1472
02:33:03,354 --> 02:33:06,109
You are so good to me.

1473
02:33:06,190 --> 02:33:09,692
Truly. Thank you.

1474
02:33:09,693 --> 02:33:11,859
Please!

1475
02:33:12,238 --> 02:33:16,491
No, I mean to come to my opera.

1476
02:33:16,492 --> 02:33:21,292
You. You are the only colleague
of mine who came.

1477
02:33:24,458 --> 02:33:26,673
Mozart.

1478
02:33:27,461 --> 02:33:31,756
I would never miss anything
you had written.

1479
02:33:31,757 --> 02:33:35,385
- It's just a vaudeville.
- No, no!

1480
02:33:35,386 --> 02:33:37,699
It's a sublime piece.

1481
02:33:38,597 --> 02:33:41,107
<i>The grandest operone!</i>

1482
02:33:49,860 --> 02:33:51,927
I tell you...

1483
02:33:52,113 --> 02:33:56,788
...you are the greatest composer
known to me.

1484
02:34:00,121 --> 02:34:01,647
Do you mean it?

1485
02:34:07,461 --> 02:34:09,627
- It's him!
- Who?

1486
02:34:09,922 --> 02:34:11,891
The man.

1487
02:34:12,091 --> 02:34:14,208
He's here.

1488
02:34:16,929 --> 02:34:19,180
Tell him to go away.

1489
02:34:19,181 --> 02:34:23,981
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.

1490
02:34:24,312 --> 02:34:26,771
No, no. Wait!

1491
02:34:26,772 --> 02:34:30,984
Ask him if he would
give me some money now.

1492
02:34:30,985 --> 02:34:35,168
Tell him if he would,
it will help me to finish it.

1493
02:34:53,467 --> 02:34:56,222
- Salieri?
- Yes.

1494
02:34:57,679 --> 02:35:02,306
- Can we come in?
- Better not. He's sleeping.

1495
02:35:02,392 --> 02:35:06,520
- He's all right, though?
- Yes, he's just exhausted.

1496
02:35:06,521 --> 02:35:09,857
He became dizzy, that's all.

1497
02:35:09,858 --> 02:35:14,658
- Well, tell him we came by, won't you?
- Of course.

1498
02:35:14,822 --> 02:35:18,563
Give him this. That's his share.

1499
02:35:18,868 --> 02:35:21,787
- That should cheer him up.
- Indeed!

1500
02:35:21,788 --> 02:35:25,415
And now, good night to you all.
It was...

1501
02:35:25,416 --> 02:35:27,543
...perfection, truly.

1502
02:35:27,544 --> 02:35:29,266
Thank you.

1503
02:35:39,598 --> 02:35:41,763
What happened?

1504
02:35:49,858 --> 02:35:53,009
He said to give you this.

1505
02:35:53,404 --> 02:35:57,292
And if you finish by tomorrow night...

1506
02:35:57,616 --> 02:36:01,209
...he will pay you
another hundred ducats.

1507
02:36:01,287 --> 02:36:03,058
Another...?

1508
02:36:03,664 --> 02:36:07,257
That's too soon. Tomorrow night...

1509
02:36:08,460 --> 02:36:10,774
It's impossible.

1510
02:36:13,757 --> 02:36:17,400
- Did he say a hundred?
- Yes.

1511
02:36:22,433 --> 02:36:24,746
It's too soon.

1512
02:36:26,645 --> 02:36:28,712
Can I...?

1513
02:36:28,814 --> 02:36:31,226
Could I help you?

1514
02:36:33,445 --> 02:36:35,610
Would you?

1515
02:36:39,035 --> 02:36:40,757
Actually, you could.

1516
02:36:48,127 --> 02:36:51,004
- I want to go.
- Where?

1517
02:36:51,005 --> 02:36:54,466
- I want to go back to Vienna.
- Now?

1518
02:36:54,467 --> 02:36:56,337
- Yes.
- Why?

1519
02:36:58,471 --> 02:37:00,538
I feel wrong.

1520
02:37:01,766 --> 02:37:04,718
I feel wrong being here.

1521
02:37:07,146 --> 02:37:10,982
<i>- Where did I stop?
- The end of the Recordare.</i>

1522
02:37:10,983 --> 02:37:12,903
<i>So now Confutatis...</i>

1523
02:37:19,492 --> 02:37:22,077
How would you translate that?

1524
02:37:22,078 --> 02:37:25,424
"Consigned to flames of woe."

1525
02:37:27,084 --> 02:37:30,283
- Do you believe in it?
- What?

1526
02:37:31,046 --> 02:37:35,846
A fire which never dies,
burning you forever.

1527
02:37:36,468 --> 02:37:37,944
Oh, yes.

1528
02:37:39,429 --> 02:37:41,349
Possible.

1529
02:37:42,766 --> 02:37:46,811
- Come, let's begin.
- We ended in F major.

1530
02:37:46,812 --> 02:37:50,748
- Yes.
- So, now, A minor.

1531
02:37:57,948 --> 02:38:01,541
- A minor.
- Yes.

1532
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:07,374
<i>Confutatis. A minor.</i>

1533
02:38:09,127 --> 02:38:11,253
Start with the voices.

1534
02:38:11,254 --> 02:38:14,756
- Basses first. Second beat of the...
- Time?

1535
02:38:14,757 --> 02:38:18,990
Common time.
Second beat of the first measure.

1536
02:38:19,721 --> 02:38:22,035
On A.

1537
02:38:23,559 --> 02:38:26,216
Second measure, second beat.

1538
02:38:26,562 --> 02:38:28,021
You see?

1539
02:38:28,022 --> 02:38:30,023
- Yes. G-sharp?
- Of course.

1540
02:38:30,024 --> 02:38:33,912
Second beat
of the third measure, on E.

1541
02:38:40,284 --> 02:38:43,040
Do you have me? Show me.

1542
02:39:02,389 --> 02:39:05,183
Good. Good.

1543
02:39:05,184 --> 02:39:06,976
Now the tenors.

1544
02:39:06,977 --> 02:39:10,817
Fourth beat
of the first measure, on C.

1545
02:39:12,316 --> 02:39:16,353
Second measure, fourth beat. D.

1546
02:39:18,031 --> 02:39:20,533
- All right?
- Yes, continue.

1547
02:39:20,534 --> 02:39:24,373
Second beat
of the fourth measure, on F.

1548
02:39:30,586 --> 02:39:34,798
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon,
bass trombones, basses.

1549
02:39:34,799 --> 02:39:37,801
Identical notes and rhythm.

1550
02:39:40,429 --> 02:39:45,229
First bassoon, tenor trombones,
with the tenors.

1551
02:39:49,564 --> 02:39:53,525
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?

1552
02:39:53,526 --> 02:39:56,945
- Bassoon to trombone what?
- With the tenors.

1553
02:39:56,946 --> 02:40:00,574
- Identical?
- The instruments doubling the voices.

1554
02:40:00,575 --> 02:40:04,452
Trumpets and timpani.
Trumpets in D. Listen.

1555
02:40:04,453 --> 02:40:07,122
- I don't understand!
- Listen!

1556
02:40:07,123 --> 02:40:11,923
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant,
first and third beats.

1557
02:40:12,588 --> 02:40:14,950
It goes with the harmony!

1558
02:40:21,054 --> 02:40:23,860
Yes. Yes, yes!

1559
02:40:32,566 --> 02:40:35,151
I understand. And that's all?

1560
02:40:35,152 --> 02:40:38,738
No, now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.

1561
02:40:38,739 --> 02:40:41,986
Ostinato, on A. Like this:

1562
02:40:44,286 --> 02:40:46,648
Next measure is rising.

1563
02:40:48,123 --> 02:40:50,879
Do you have it? Show me.

1564
02:40:58,092 --> 02:41:01,735
- It's wonderful!
- Yes, yes. Go on.

1565
02:41:07,937 --> 02:41:10,250
- Write that down!
- Yes, yes.

1566
02:41:14,109 --> 02:41:17,237
"Call me among the blessed."

1567
02:41:17,238 --> 02:41:19,072
C major.

1568
02:41:19,073 --> 02:41:23,873
Sopranos and altos in thirds.
Altos on C, sopranos above.

1569
02:41:36,465 --> 02:41:39,467
<i>Sopranos up to F on the second voca?</i>

1570
02:41:39,468 --> 02:41:44,268
<i>And on dictus. And underneath,
just violins. Arpeggios.</i>

1571
02:41:45,683 --> 02:41:49,269
Scale in eighth notes,
then back to ostinato.

1572
02:41:49,270 --> 02:41:51,646
- Do you have it?
- You go too fast.

1573
02:41:51,647 --> 02:41:55,486
- Do you have it?
- One moment, please!

1574
02:41:58,863 --> 02:42:03,392
Good. Show me the whole thing
from the beginning.

1575
02:44:05,995 --> 02:44:08,830
Do you want to rest a bit?

1576
02:44:08,831 --> 02:44:11,390
No, I'm not tired at all.

1577
02:44:16,881 --> 02:44:19,841
We'll stop for a moment.

1578
02:44:19,842 --> 02:44:24,642
<i>- Then we'll finish the Lacrimosa.
- I can keep going. I assure you.</i>

1579
02:44:25,139 --> 02:44:29,322
Will you stay with me
while I sleep a little?

1580
02:44:30,185 --> 02:44:32,844
I'm not leaving you.

1581
02:44:39,905 --> 02:44:42,660
I'm so ashamed.

1582
02:44:43,533 --> 02:44:45,945
Of what?

1583
02:44:46,077 --> 02:44:48,704
I was foolish.

1584
02:44:48,705 --> 02:44:53,505
I thought you did not care
for my work, or me.

1585
02:44:56,963 --> 02:44:59,277
Forgive me.

1586
02:45:03,511 --> 02:45:05,972
Forgive me.

1587
02:46:03,407 --> 02:46:06,310
What are you doing here?

1588
02:46:08,078 --> 02:46:11,868
Your husband took sick.

1589
02:46:12,416 --> 02:46:14,778
I brought him home.

1590
02:46:16,169 --> 02:46:18,286
Why you?

1591
02:46:19,089 --> 02:46:22,928
Because, madame, I was at hand.

1592
02:46:26,139 --> 02:46:30,027
Well, thank you very much.
You can go now.

1593
02:46:31,936 --> 02:46:34,313
He needs me, ma'am.

1594
02:46:34,314 --> 02:46:36,398
No, he doesn't.

1595
02:46:36,399 --> 02:46:41,194
And I don't want you here.
Just go, please.

1596
02:46:41,195 --> 02:46:44,691
- He asked me to stay.
- And I'm ask...

1597
02:47:14,230 --> 02:47:16,592
I'm back.

1598
02:47:19,401 --> 02:47:22,798
I missed you so much.

1599
02:47:26,034 --> 02:47:28,249
If you'd just...

1600
02:47:29,287 --> 02:47:32,831
...show me that you need me.

1601
02:47:38,213 --> 02:47:42,052
And I'll try to do better too.

1602
02:47:53,228 --> 02:47:55,344
What is this?

1603
02:47:58,233 --> 02:48:03,033
No, Wolfie, not this. Not this.

1604
02:48:06,283 --> 02:48:10,713
You're not to work on this ever again.

1605
02:48:11,122 --> 02:48:13,287
I've decided.

1606
02:48:16,753 --> 02:48:19,904
This is not his handwriting.

1607
02:48:21,174 --> 02:48:23,291
It's mine.

1608
02:48:23,969 --> 02:48:26,725
I was assisting him.

1609
02:48:27,264 --> 02:48:30,600
He's not to work on this anymore.

1610
02:48:30,601 --> 02:48:33,209
- It's making him ill.
- But...

1611
02:48:35,606 --> 02:48:38,164
Good night.

1612
02:48:40,277 --> 02:48:45,072
<i>I regret we have no servants
to show you out, Herr Salieri.</i>

1613
02:48:45,073 --> 02:48:48,242
Please respect my wish and go.

1614
02:48:48,243 --> 02:48:50,244
Madame...

1615
02:48:50,245 --> 02:48:53,247
...I will respect his.

1616
02:52:57,250 --> 02:53:00,596
Your merciful God.

1617
02:53:03,381 --> 02:53:08,181
He destroyed his own beloved,
rather than let a mediocrity...

1618
02:53:08,887 --> 02:53:13,562
...share in the smallest part
of his glory.

1619
02:53:14,309 --> 02:53:16,229
He killed Mozart.

1620
02:53:16,937 --> 02:53:19,897
And kept me alive to torture.

1621
02:53:19,898 --> 02:53:22,274
Thirty-two years of torture.

1622
02:53:22,275 --> 02:53:27,075
Thirty-two years of slowly
watching myself become extinct.

1623
02:53:28,156 --> 02:53:30,616
My music...

1624
02:53:30,617 --> 02:53:32,743
...growing fainter.

1625
02:53:32,744 --> 02:53:35,788
All the time fainter...

1626
02:53:35,789 --> 02:53:39,235
...till no one plays it at all.

1627
02:53:39,669 --> 02:53:41,145
And his...

1628
02:53:42,838 --> 02:53:47,638
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.

1629
02:53:47,802 --> 02:53:52,602
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls. He loves those.

1630
02:53:53,307 --> 02:53:56,185
Fresh sugar rolls.

1631
02:53:56,186 --> 02:53:58,896
I will speak for you, Father.

1632
02:53:58,897 --> 02:54:02,525
I speak for all mediocrities
in the world.

1633
02:54:02,526 --> 02:54:05,486
I am their champion.

1634
02:54:05,487 --> 02:54:08,686
I am their patron saint.

1635
02:54:18,584 --> 02:54:21,979
Mediocrities everywhere...

1636
02:54:22,921 --> 02:54:25,875
...I absolve you.

1637
02:54:27,175 --> 02:54:29,045
I absolve you.

1638
02:54:30,095 --> 02:54:32,951
I absolve you.

1639
02:54:34,893 --> 02:54:37,993
I absolve you.

1640
02:54:38,229 --> 02:54:41,822
I absolve you all.
