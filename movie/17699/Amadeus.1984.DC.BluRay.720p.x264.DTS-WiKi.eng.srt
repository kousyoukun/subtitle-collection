332
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,741
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

333
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,161
Sir, yes. The honor is mine,
absolutely!

334
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:59,625
Here is our
illustrious court composer...

335
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,752
...Maestro Salieri.

336
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,590
At last, such immense joy!

337
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,344
I know your work well.

338
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:15,182
You know, I composed some variations
on a melody of yours.

339
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,352
-Really? Which one?
-"Mio Caro Adone."

340
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,937
I'm flattered.

341
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,273
A funny tune,
but it yielded good things.

342
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,360
EMPEROR: And now he has returned
the compliment.

343
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:30,155
Herr Salieri composed
this little march for you.

344
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,032
Really?

345
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,159
MOZART:
Grazie, signore.

346
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,869
Well, there it is.

347
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:41,375
Down to business. We're going
to commission an opera from you.

348
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,377
What do you say?

349
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,628
Majesty!

350
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:48,215
Did we vote in the end
for German or Italian?

351
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:54,137
Sire, if you remember,
we did finally incline to Italian.

352
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,390
Did we?

353
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,395
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.

354
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,688
Oh.

355
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,984
-German. Please let it be German.
-Why so?

356
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:11,238
Because I've already found
the most wonderful libretto.

357
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,699
Have I seen it?

358
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,412
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.
It's quite new.

359
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:23,041
-I'll show it to you immediately.
-I think you'd better.

360
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,584
Well...

361
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,172
...tell us about it.
Tell us the story.

362
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,387
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.

363
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:40,308
It's set--
The whole thing is set in a....

364

Yes? Where?

365
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:52,612
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.

366
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,241
-You mean in Turkey?
-Yes, exactly.

367
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,747
Then why especially
does it have to be in German?

368
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:07,544
It doesn't, especially. It could be
in Turkish if you really want.

369
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,758
No, my dear fellow, the language
is not finally the point.

370
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:18,555
Do you really think that subject
is appropriate for a national theater?

371
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,641
Why not? It's charming.

372
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:28,148
I mean, I won't actually show
concubines exposing their....

373
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,319
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.

374
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,322
It's full of proper German virtues.

375
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,868
Excuse me, Majesty, but what
do you think these could be?

376
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,996
Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.

Well, tell him, Mozart.

-Love, sire.
-Oh, love!

380
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,468
Of course, in Italy
we know nothing about love.

No, I don't think you do.

all those male sopranos screeching...

383
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:13,443
...stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes
about. That's not love. It's rubbish!

Majesty, you choose the language.

385
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,953
I'll set it to the finest music
ever offered a monarch.

Well, there it is.
Let it be German.

This is yours.

Keep it.
It's already here in my head.

I think so, sire. Yes.

That doesn't really work, does it?

Did you try...?

396
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,981
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?

SALIERI: All I ever wanted
was to sing to God.

403
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,677
He gave me that longing...

404
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,430
...and then made me mute. Why?

405

Tell me that.

00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,123
I'm from a small town.

650
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,459
Just like your husband.

651
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,798
Are you sure you can't...

652
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:16,677
...leave this and come back again?

653
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,806
It's very tempting, sir.

654
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,309
But it's impossible, I'm afraid.

655
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,854
He'd be frantic
if he knew they were missing.

656
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,941
You see, they're all originals.

657
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,195
-Originals?
-Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

658
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,709
These...

659
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,377
...are originals?

660
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,005
Mm-hm.

661
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,373
SALIERI:
Astounding!

662
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,377
It was actually--
It was beyond belief.

663
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,756
These were first and only...

664
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,550
...drafts of music.

665
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:45,390
But they showed no corrections
of any kind. Not one.

666
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:51,563
He had simply written down music...

667
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,733
...already finished in his head.

668
01:00:55,026 --> 01:01:00,530
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.

669
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,247
And music...

670
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,460
...finished as no music
is ever finished.

671
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:19,257
Displace one note...

672
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,302
...and there would be diminishment.

673
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:27,766
Displace one phrase,
and the structure would fall.

674
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,980
It was clear to me...

675
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:38,568
...that sound I had heard
in the archbishop's palace...

676
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,697
...had been no accident.

677
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:47,577
Here again
was the very voice of God.

678
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,459
I was staring through the cage...

679
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:58,296
...of those meticulous ink strokes...

680
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:03,635
...at an absolute beauty.

681
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,486
Is it not good?

682
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,659
It is miraculous.

683
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:36,042
Yes, he's very proud of his work.

684
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,672
So you will help us?

685
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,761
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening.

686
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:49,431
One word from me and the post is his.

687
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,434
Thank you, Your Excellency!
Thank you!

688

Come back tonight.

689
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,940
-Tonight?
-Alone.

690
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,778
What for?

691
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:08,200
Some service
deserves service in return.

692
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,536
No?

693
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:16,750
-What do you mean?
-Isn't it obvious?

694
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,879
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

695
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:25,050
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.

696
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:28,261
I'm a married woman, sir.

697
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,180
Then don't.

698
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,682
It's up to you.

699
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,478
And not to be vague,
that is the price.

There is no God of mercy, Father.

Just a God of torture.

01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:05,423
Evening came.

703
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:11,137
I sat there, not knowing
whether she would return or not.

704
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:16,643
I prayed as I had
never prayed before.

...enter me now.

707
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:27,320
Fill me with one piece of true music.

708
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:32,826
One piece with your breath in it,
so I know that you love me.

709
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:39,040
Show me one sign of your favor,
and I will show mine to Mozart.

710
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:43,837
I will get him the royal position.

711
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,006
Enter me.

712
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,133
Please.

01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,651
That lady is back, sir.

717
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,324
Show her in.

Well?

01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,029
I'm here.

720
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:58,036
My husband has gone to a concert.

721
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,706
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

722

Well, where shall we go?

723
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,224
Should we stay here?

Well....

725
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,775
Do you still want to look at these?

726
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,864
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

What's the matter? Tell me.

You and I.

738
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,368
Because you choose
for your instrument...

739
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:48,373
...a boastful, lustful,
smutty, infantile boy...

740
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:54,546
...and give me for reward only the
ability to recognize the incarnation.

741
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,133
Because you are unjust...

742

I will hinder and harm
your creature on earth...

...as far as I am able.

against a fellow musician.

Of course not.

I have to tell you.

751
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:28,454
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted
alone with young ladies.

-Whom did they choose?
-Herr Zummer.

Herr Zummer?

763
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:16,461
But the man's a fool!
He's a total mediocrity.

764
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:21,507
No, no. He has yet
to achieve mediocrity.

You can talk to the emperor...

01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:39,525
...and tell him that Herr Zummer
is an awful choice.

769
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,820
He could do musical harm
to the princess.

Between us, no one in the world
could do musical harm to the princess.

They're stupendously successful.

01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:19,524
You can't get a seat.
But no one will hire me.

Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.

You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?

786

As a matter of fact, I do.

I am working on something that will
explode like a bomb all over Europe.

right for you, can we?

973

You won't have to do anything
for me ever again.

974

-No, Papa.
LEOPOLD: I won't stay and be a burden.

976

MOZART:
No one calls you that.

977
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:05,881

978
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,924
And so you do!

979
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:11,345
The only time you come out is to eat.

980
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,848
LEOPOLD:
Well, what do you expect?

981
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:21,897
Do you expect anyone to walk out
into a mess like this every day?

982
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:26,902
CONSTANZE: Now I'm a bad housekeeper!
LEOPOLD: So you are. It's a pigsty.

983
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:29,321
When can you start?

984
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,740
-Right away, ma'am.
CONSTANZE: Good.

985
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:01,645
LORL:
They're out every night, sir.

986
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:05,982
Thank you, sir.

987
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:09,778
Do any pupils come to the house?

988
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,865
Not that I've seen.

989
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,868
Then how does he pay for all this?

990
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:20,163
Does he work at all?

991
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:26,336
Yes, sir. All day long. He never
leaves the house till evening.

992
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:29,589
He just sits there,
writing and writing.

993
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:31,591
Really?

994
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,178
What is it he's writing?

995
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:40,767
I wouldn't know that, sir.

996
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,769
Of course not.

997
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,980
You're a good girl.

998
01:30:45,189 --> 01:30:47,607
You're very kind to do this.

999
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:53,029
The next time you're sure they'll
be out of the house, let me know.

1000
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:01,872
Thank you, sir.

1001
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:44,516
I think I found out
about the money, sir.

1002
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:47,811
Yes? What?

1003
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:53,066
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.

1004
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:55,569
And now look.

1005
01:32:55,778 --> 01:32:57,904
There's only one left.

1006
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,408
Where does he work?

1007
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,161
In there, sir.

1008
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:54,002
Gentlemen, I've just
heard some news...

1009
01:33:54,378 --> 01:33:57,505
-...that may interest you.
-What?

1010
01:33:57,715 --> 01:34:02,093
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.

1011
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,721
Italian?

1012
01:34:05,514 --> 01:34:09,726
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.

1013
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:13,188
The Marriage of Figaro.

1014
01:34:13,397 --> 01:34:16,900
He's setting that play to music?

1015
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,610
Yes.

1016
01:34:19,862 --> 01:34:23,323
What is this Marriage of Figaro?

1017
01:34:23,532 --> 01:34:26,993
It's a French play, Kapellmeister.

1018
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:30,413
It has been banned by the emperor.

1019
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,666
You're absolutely sure?

1020
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:38,588
Herr Mozart.

1021
01:34:39,548 --> 01:34:41,675
Gentlemen, sit down.

1022
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:48,139
EMPEROR:
Mozart.

1023
01:34:49,392 --> 01:34:53,645
Are you aware that I have declared
the French play Figaro...

1024
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:56,731
...unsuitable for our theater?

1025
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,693
Yes, sire.

1026
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:05,073
Yet we hear you're making an
opera from it. Is this true?

1027
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,912
Who told you this, Majesty?

1028
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:15,792
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?

1029
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,961
Yes, I....

1030
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:20,714
I admit it is.

1031
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,301
Would you tell me why?

1032
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,806
Majesty, it is only a comedy.

1033
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:32,809
ROSENBERG:
What you think is scarcely the point.

1034
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:36,813
It's what His Majesty thinks
that counts.

1035
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,190
But, Your Majesty--

1036
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,276
Mozart...

1037
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:43,695
...I am a tolerant man.

1038
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:48,825
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.

1039
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:52,704
Figaro is a bad play.

1040
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,999
It stirs up hatred between classes.

1041
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,294
In France, it has caused
only bitterness.

1042
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:04,841
My sister Antoinette is beginning
to be frightened of her own people.

1043
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:08,636
I swear, there's nothing
like that in the piece.

1044
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:13,767
I've taken out everything that could
give offense. I hate politics.

1045
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:16,519
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.

1046
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:21,858
In these dangerous times I cannot
afford to provoke our people...

1047
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,360
...simply over a theater piece.

1048
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:29,657
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
A piece about love.

1049
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:31,868
"Love." Again!

1050
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:33,870
MOZART:
And it's new!

1051
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:38,166
It's entirely new.
The people will go mad for it.

1052
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:40,627
I have scenes....

1053
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:43,880
The end of Act II, for example.

1054
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:48,051
It starts as a duet.
A husband and wife quarreling.

1055
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:53,389
Suddenly, the scheming maid comes in.
It's a very funny situation.

1056
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:55,475
Duet turns into trio.

1057
01:36:55,684 --> 01:36:58,561
Then the husband's valet comes in.

1058
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:00,563
Trio turns into quartet.

1059
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:03,733
Then a gardener.
Quartet becomes quintet.

1060
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:05,902
And so on, on and on.

1061
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:08,738
Sextet, septet, octet.

1062
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:12,700
How long do you think
I can sustain that?

1063
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,911
I have no idea.

1064
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:16,538
Guess.

1065
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:18,915
Guess, Your Majesty.

1066
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:24,170
Imagine the longest time
it could be sustained, then double it.

1067
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:26,673
Well....

1068
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,592
Six...

1069
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:32,720
...seven minutes?

1070
01:37:35,432 --> 01:37:39,853
-Eight minutes?
-Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes!

1071
01:37:40,062 --> 01:37:44,399
Twenty minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!

1072
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:47,235
Sire, only opera can do this.

1073
01:37:47,444 --> 01:37:51,364
In a play, if more than one person
speaks at once...

1074
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,533
...it's just noise.

1075
01:37:53,742 --> 01:37:56,286
But with opera, with music...

1076
01:37:56,453 --> 01:38:00,623
...you can have 20 individuals
all talking at the same time.

1077
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:03,877
It's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony!

1078
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:07,422
VAN SWIETEN:
Mozart, music is not the issue here.

1079
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:12,927
No one doubts your talent. It's your
literary judgment that's in question.

1080
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:19,142
Even without the politics,
it would remain a vulgar farce.

1081
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:22,228
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

1082
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:26,482
Surely you can choose more
elevated themes.

1083
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:29,861
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?

1084
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:33,823
I am fed to the teeth with these...

1085
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:37,285
...elevated things. Old dead legends.

1086
01:38:37,494 --> 01:38:41,623
Why must we go on forever
writing of gods and legends?

1087
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:43,833
Because they do.

1088
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:46,836
They go on forever.

1089
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:51,507
At least what they represent:
the eternal in us.

1090
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:54,510
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.

1091

You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.

1092
01:38:58,015 --> 01:39:01,351
Bello. Veramente.

1093
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:06,856
"Bello, bello, bello."
Come on now, be honest!

1094

...growing fainter.

1768
02:53:32,819 --> 02:53:35,654
All the time fainter...

1769
02:53:35,863 --> 02:53:38,824
...till no one plays it at all.

1770
02:53:39,742 --> 02:53:40,992
And his....

1771
02:53:42,954 --> 02:53:47,541
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.

1772
02:53:47,875 --> 02:53:52,838
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls. He loves those.

1773
02:53:53,381 --> 02:53:56,049
Fresh sugar rolls.

1774
02:53:56,259 --> 02:53:58,760
I will speak for you, Father.

1775
02:53:59,011 --> 02:54:02,180
I speak for
all mediocrities in the world.

1776
02:54:02,598 --> 02:54:05,350
I am their champion.

1777
02:54:05,560 --> 02:54:08,270
I am their patron saint.

1778
02:54:18,698 --> 02:54:21,533
Mediocrities everywhere...

1779
02:54:23,035 --> 02:54:25,537
...I absolve you.

1780
02:54:27,248 --> 02:54:28,874
I absolve you.

1781
02:54:30,209 --> 02:54:32,586
I absolve you.

1782
02:54:35,006 --> 02:54:37,591
I absolve you.

1783
02:54:38,301 --> 02:54:41,386
I absolve you all.

1784
02:54:48,227 --> 02:54:51,646
