1
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,923
莫札特
Mozart!

2
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:43,501
莫札特，原谅我的罪行
Mozart!Forgive your assassin!

3
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:47,636
我承认是我害死你的
I confess, I kiIIed you!

4
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:52,843
我杀了你，莫札特，原谅我
Si, I kiIIed you, Mozart.

5
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:58,852
慈悲...莫札特，原谅杀你的人
Mozart, pietu! Forgive your assassin!

6
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:01,482
原谅我，莫札特
Forgive me, Mozart!

7
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:06,856
萨列里先生，快开门，乖一点
Signore Salieri,open the door, be good now!

8
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,598
先生，我们为你准备特别的
Signore, we have something speciaI for you.

9
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:13,568
这是你一定会喜欢的
Something you're going to Iove.

10
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,441
好好吃
Is that good!

11
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:29,951
相信我，这是我一辈子吃过最好吃的东西
Signore, beIieve me...
...this is the most delicious thing I ever ate in my Iife!

12
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:33,457
你不知道你错过了什么
ReaIIy, you don't know
what you're miss--

13
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:41,925
别闹了，先生，快开门
AII right, that's enough!
Open the door.

14
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:52,909
先生，如果你不开门
我们会吃光所有的甜点
Signore, if you don't
open this door...
...we're gonna Ieave nothing
for you.

15
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,309
我们什么都不留给你
而且我也不来看你了
And I'm never gonna come
see you again!

16
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:59,439

00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,992
早安，神父
Good morning, Father.

24
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,657
萨列里先生
Herr Salieri?.

25
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:04,489
不要理我
Leave me aIone.

26
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,495
我不能不去理受到折磨的灵魂
I cannot Ieave aIone a souI in pain.

27
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:22,243
你知道我是谁吗
这没什么差别
Do you know who I am?
That makes no difference.

28
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:25,282
在上帝的眼中
众生都是平等的
AII men are equaI in God's eyes.

29
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:35,754
是吗
向我忏悔吧
Are they?
Offer me your confession.

30
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,624
我可以让上帝宽恕你
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

31
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:49,298
你对音乐的了解有多深
How weII are you trained in music?

32
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,577
一些，我年轻时学过
是在哪里学的
I know a IittIe.
I studied it in my youth.

33
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:59,410
就在维也纳
-Where?
-Here in Vienna.

34
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:03,579
那你一定听过这首
Then you must know this.

35
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:13,894
我好像没有听过
I can't say that I do.

36
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,195
这是什么
What is it?

37
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:22,970
当时是非常受欢迎的歌曲
这是我写的
It was a very popuIar tune in its day.
I wrote it.

38
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,644
那这一首呢
Here, how about this?

39
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:33,580
我们第一次演奏时
这首获得满堂贺彩
This one brought down the house
when we pIayed it.

40
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,555
怎么样
WeII?

41
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,533
对不起，这首也不是很熟悉
I regret it is not too famiIiar.

42
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:30,268
你没听过我任何一首歌曲吗
Can you recaII no meIody of mine?

43
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,310
我原来是
全欧洲最有名的作曲家
I was the most famous composer
in Europe.

44
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:36,076
我一个人写了40出歌剧
I wrote 40 operas aIone.

45
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:40,079
Here!

46
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:41,680
这一首怎么样
What about this one?

47
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,664
这首我听过
Yes, I know that!

48
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:02,303
真是太棒了
That's charming!

49
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,403
对不起，我不知道这是你写的
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you wrote that.

50
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,607
这一首不是我写的
I didn't.

51
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,715
这是莫札特的
That was Mozart.

52
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:26,164
伍尔夫阿玛迪斯莫札特
WoIfgang...
...Amadeus Mozart.

53
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,192
你就是你责怪自己谋杀的人
The man you accuse yourseIf
of kiIIing.

54
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,833
你听说了
You've heard that?

55
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,168
这是事实吗
Is it true?

56
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:50,047
看在老天的份上
For God's sake, my son...

57
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,351
如果你有忏悔的需要
...if you have something to confess,
do it now.

58
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,557
现在忏悔吧，让自己能够心安
Give yourseIf some peace.

59
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:09,869
他是我的偶像
He...
...was my idoI.

60
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:14,175
莫札特
Mozart.

61
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:19,676
他的名字
随时随地都在我心中响起
I can't think of a time
when I didn't know his name.

62
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,877
我在玩游戏的时候
I was playing games...

63
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:29,054
他就在帮帝王，国王
罗马的教宗演奏
... when he was playing music
for kings and emperors.
Even the pope in Rome.

64
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:35,931
我承认，我嫉妒
I admit, I was jealous...

65
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,662
人们告诉我有关他的传闻
... when I heard the tules
they told about him.

66
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:46,501
人们不是说这个神童
而是教导他一切的父亲
Not of the brilliant prodigy...
...but of his father,
who had tuught him everything.

67
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:50,778
我的父亲根本不在乎音乐
My father, he did not care for music.

68
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:56,013
当我告诉他
我多么希望能像莫札特一样
When I toId him...
...how I wished I couId be
Iike Mozart...

69
00:10:56,121 --> 00:11:00,820
他会说，你为什么
想当马戏团的猴子
...he would say, ''Why? Do you want
to be a trained monkey?

70
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:05,953
你希望我把你当成马戏团怪物
去全欧洲表演特技吗
You'd like me to drag you around,
doing tricks like a circus freak?''

71
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:15,667
我要如何告诉他
音乐对我有多重要
How couId I teII him...
...what music meant to me?

72
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:33,412
我父亲诚心向上帝祷告
While my father
prayed earnestly to God...

73
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:41,364
希望能够生意兴隆时
我会偷偷的祷告
...to protect commerce...
...I would offer up...
...secretly...

74
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:44,492
那是一个小男孩
最骄傲的祷告词
...the proudest prayer
a boy could think of.

75
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:49,130
上帝，使我成为伟大的作曲家
''Lord, make me a great composer.

76
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,267
让我透过音乐赞美您的荣耀
Let me celebrate your glory
through music...

77
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:56,245
让我自己也能因此得到荣耀
...and be celebrated myself.

78
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:03,779
亲爱的上帝，使我闻名全世界
使我永垂不朽
Make me famous through the world.
Make me immortal.

79
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:10,926
我身亡之后
让所有的人赞美我的音乐
After I die...
...Iet peopIe speak my name
with Iove for what I wrote.

80
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:18,793
为了回报
我愿意献出我的贞洁
In return...
...I wiII give you my chastity...

81
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:27,538
我的努力，我的谦卑
我每一刻的生命
...my industry...
...my deepest humiIity,
every hour of my Iife.

82
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,008
阿门
Amen. ''

83
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,545
你知道后来怎么了吗
奇迹发生了
And do you know what happened?
A miraclel

84
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:44,922
法兰西斯...

85
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:56,404
我的人生永远改变了
My Iife changed forever.

86
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,872
我知道这全是上帝的安排
这是很明显的
I knew God had arranged it aII.
That was obvious.

87
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:13,918
一下子我是个
小镇里沮丧的男孩
一下子我就来到了维也纳
那是属于音乐家的城市
One minute I was a frustrated boy...
...in an obscure IittIe town.
The next I was here...
...in Vienna, city of musicians...

88
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:17,654
约瑟夫帝王，音乐之王
...and Emperor Joseph,
the musical king.

89
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:20,356
在几年之内
我就成了他的御用作曲家
In a few years, I was his court
composer. 

90
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:21,989
是不是很不可思议
Isn't that incredible?

91
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,334
几年来我每晚坐在
奥地利皇帝的身旁
Every night I sat with
the emperor of Austria...

92
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:31,340
与他一起二重奏
教导陛下读乐谱
...playing duets with him...
...correcting the royal sight-reading.

93
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:37,576
事实上他根本没有任何听力
ActuaIIy, the man had no ear at aII.

94
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:44,719
那有什么关系
他热爱我的音乐
But what did it matter?
He adored my music.

95
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:55,056
告诉我，如果你是我的话
你敢以上帝之名发誓吗
TeII me....
If you had been me...
...wouIdn't you have thought
God had accepted your vow?

96
00:13:57,035 --> 00:14:04,739
相信我，我是坐怀不乱
美色诱惑不了我的
And beIieve me, I honored it.
I was a modeI of virtue.
I kept my hands off women.

97
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:09,173
我日以继夜地教音乐
很多人我都免费教授
I worked hours every day
teaching students, many for free!

98
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:17,783
帮助那些无助的穷困音乐家
无穷无尽地工作
Sitting on endIess committees
to heIp poor musicians.
Work, that was aII my Iife.

99
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,754
感觉真的是很棒
And it was wonderfuI.

100
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,985
大家都喜欢我
Everybody Iiked me.

101
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,990
我也喜欢我自己
I Iiked myseIf.

102
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,729
直到他出现
UntiI he came.

103
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:38,805
他来到维也纳
演奏自己的音乐
He came to Vienna to pIay
some of his music...

104
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:45,176
他当时是沙兹堡主教的门客
...at the residence
of the prince archbishop of SaIzburg.

105
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,646
我立刻去那里找他
Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.

106
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:59,526
那一个晚上
改变了我的一生
That night...
...changed my life.

107
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:09,505
我穿过宴客厅的时候
开始与自己玩游戏
As I wandered through the salon...
...I played a little game with myself.

108
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:14,237
这个男人在4岁的时候
创作了第一首协奏曲
This man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4...

109
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:16,472
在7岁的时候
又写出第一首交响乐
...his first symphony at 7,

110
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,674
12岁时就创作第一出歌剧
a full-scale opera at 1 2l

111
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:29,755
这种才华是不是
会很明显地写在脸上呢
Did it show?
Is tulent like that...
... written on the face?

112
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:37,500
他到底是哪一位仁兄呢
Which one of them...
...could he be?

113
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,589
找不到莫札特
Mozart is not here.

114
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:51,398
别闹了
没闹...
-Stop it!
-I am.
-Stop it!
-I am stopping it.

115
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:54,027
我没有闹...
I am! I'm stopping it. SIowIy.

116
00:17:54,138 --> 00:18:00,509
慢慢的，看到了没有
我停下来了
There. You see? I've stopped.

117
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:03,774
现在我们又要开始了
不要...
-Now we're going back.
-No!

118
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:08,318
你不知道你身在何处
这里一切都是本末倒置的
Yes! You don't know where you are.
Here, everything goes backwards.

119
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:11,882
人们倒着走
倒着跳舞，倒着唱歌
PeopIe waIk and dance and sing

120
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,513
甚至倒着说话
and even taIk backwards.

121
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:18,553
这真的是太愚蠢了
为什么，人们倒着放屁
-That's stupid.
-Why? PeopIe fart backwards.

122
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:24,432
你说，我生病了
Say I'm sick!
Say I'm sick!

123
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,033
是的，你是病的很严重
Yes, you are. You are very sick.

124
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:30,437
不，倒过来说
No! Say it backwards, shitwit!

125
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:42,347
重严很的病
音同亲我屁股
Saa-I'm-sick....
Sick, kiss.
I'm, my. Saa....
Kiss my ass.

126
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:47,252
你再说...
我不要玩
Eem-iram!
-I'm not pIaying!
-Say it, it's serious.

127
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,724
快说，这是很严肃的
说，我给嫁
It's very serious.

128
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:57,158
嫁...嫁给我
Iram....
Marry me.

129
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:01,233
我才不要嫁给你呢
你是个魔鬼
I'm not gonna marry you.
You're a fiend.

130
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:05,776
你爱我是可
Ooy-voI-I-tub....

131
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:15,752
可...是...我...爱...你...
Tub...
...but I....
Love....
But I Iove you?

132
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,394
便大的我吃
什么
-Tish I'm tee.
-What?

133
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:27,157
便大的我吃
-Tish I'm tee.

134
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:39,137
吃我的大便...
-Eat.
-Eat.
-I'm, my.
-My.
Tish. Eat my shit.

135
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,609
你这只肮脏的猪
You fiIthy fiend!

136
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,703
你这个肮脏...
You fiIthy--

137
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,482
我的音乐
My music.

138
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:53,784
他们没有我就开始了
They've started without me.

139
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:10,267
那就是莫札特
That was Mozart!

140
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:17,467
那个嬉笑怒骂
心中充满邪恶的怪物
That giggIing, dirty creature

141
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,807
刚刚还在地板上爬着
I'd just seen crawIing on the fIoor.

142
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:22,374
我认为演奏会进行的很顺利
没错
-I think that went weII, don't you?
-Indeed.

143
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,971
维也纳人
就是会欣赏优美的音乐
The Viennese know good music,
don't you think?

144
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:27,141
你不认为吗
当然
CertainIy.

145
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,378
阁下
Your Grace.

146
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,118
莫札特
Ah, Mozart.

147
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:38,961
为什么
-Why?

148
00:21:39,063 --> 00:21:40,257
阁下，什么为什么
-Why what, sir?

149
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:47,333
为什么我要在我的宾客面前
受仆人的羞辱
Why must I be humiIiated
in front of my guests...
...by one of my own servants?

150
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:50,999
你真的是太得寸进尺了
The more Iicense I aIIow you,
the more you take.

151
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:54,703
如果阁下对我不满意
可以让我走
If His Grace is not satisfied,
he can dismiss me.

152
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:59,444
我要你立刻回去沙兹堡
I wish you to return immediateIy
to SaIzburg.

153
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,519
你父亲在那里
很有耐心的等着你
-Your father is waiting for you there.
-No, Your Grace!

154
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:09,025
不，阁下，我宁可你让我走
很明显的我没做好
I wouId prefer you dismissed me.
It's obvious I don't satisfy.

155
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:11,720
我不打算让你走
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You wiII remain in my service...

156
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:17,194
你仍然要当我的仆人
但是要多学些行为规范
...and Iearn your pIace.

157
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:57,704
在纸张上看起来平凡无奇
On the page it looked....
Nothingl

158
00:22:57,808 --> 00:23:02,302
一开始很简单
几乎有点可笑
The beginning simpIe, aImost comic.

159
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:11,645
低音管，低音号
好像生锈的铁盒子一样
Just a puIse.
Bassoons, basset horns...
...Iike a rusty squeezebox.

160
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:19,686
然后突然出现了高音
And then, suddenIy...
...high above it...

161
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,524
单一的双簧管
...an oboe.

162
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:28,666
一个音符不变的飘浮着
A singIe note, hanging there,
unwavering.

163
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:36,178
直到被黑管取代
UntiI...
...a cIarinet took it over...

164
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:42,685
变成了如此悦耳的音乐
...sweetened it into a phrase
of such deIight.

165
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:51,024
这可不是马戏团猴子
所写出来的乐曲
This was no composition
by a performing monkey.

166
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:56,766
这是我前所未听的音乐
This was a music I had never heard.

167
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:05,035
充满了如此的情感
无法满足的欲求
FiIIed with such Ionging,
such unfuIfiIIabIe Ionging.

168
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,943
我似乎是听到了上帝的声音
It seemed to me I was hearing
the voice of God.

169
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:11,272
失陪
Excuse me.

170
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:20,123
上帝为什么要选择
这愚蠢的孩子做为她的工具
But why?
Why would God choose an obscene child
to be his instrument?

171
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:27,724
我想不可讳言的
这一定是个意外事件
It was not to be beIieved.
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.

172
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:33,436
最好是这样
It better be.

173
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:37,400
莫札特有多厉害
How good is he, this Mozart?

174
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:39,806
他非常杰出，陛下
He's remarkabIe, Majesty.

175
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,175
上个月我听过
他相当杰出的歌剧
 I heard an
extraordinary opera of his Iast month.

176
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,180
叫做“克里特王”的歌剧
-Idomeneo, King of Crete.
-That?

177
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:50,811
那真的是最平凡的作品
我也听过了
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.

178
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:52,752
最平凡的
Tiresome?

179
00:24:52,857 --> 00:25:02,528
一个年轻人不自量力
太多的音符...
A young man trying to impress
beyond his abiIities.
Too much spice.
Too many notes.

180
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:07,661
陛下，我认为这是多年来
我听过最有潜力的作品
Majesty...
...it was the most promising work
I've heard in years.

181
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:11,207
也许我们应该想办法把他找来
WeII, then, we shouId make
some effort to acquire him.

182
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:15,635
维也纳也需要有一位
优秀的德国作曲家
We couId use a good German composer
in Vienna, sureIy?

183
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:19,410
只要价码合理
我相信他会有兴趣的
I'm sure he couId be tempted
with the right offer. Say...

184
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:25,251
为了我们的国家歌剧院
做一曲德文的歌剧
...an opera in German
for our NationaI Theater.

185
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:27,290
太好了，陛下
ExceIIent, sire!

186
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:30,554
不能用德文的，求求你，陛下
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.

187
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:34,893
意大利文才是得体的歌剧语文
ItaIian is the proper Ianguage
for opera.

188
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,797
这是知识份子的共识
AII educated peopIe agree on that.

189
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:44,130
内廷大臣，你认为怎么样
What do you think, chamberIain?

190
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:49,977
我认为现在该是
有国语歌剧的时候了
In my opinion, it's time
we had a piece in our own Ianguage.

191
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,846
让老百姓听德文
PIain German for pIain peopIe.

192
00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:59,347
卡普麦斯特
Kapellmeister?

193
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:05,853
陛下，我赞成部长的看法
Majesty...
...I must agree with Herr Direttore.

194
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,865
德文...
German is...

195
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,626
真是失礼了

196
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:17,062
不够优雅，不适合歌剧
...too brute for singing.

197
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:24,170
御用作曲家，你的看法呢？
Court composer...
...what do you think?

198
00:26:25,282 --> 00:26:29,548
我认为请莫札特来维也纳
是很有趣的构想
I think it's an interesting notion
to keep Mozart in Vienna.

199
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,659
这会使得大主教非常的愤怒
也许这是陛下的企图
It shouId infuriate the archbishop...
...if that is Your Majesty's
intention.

200
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,660
你说对了，御用作曲家
You are cattivo, court composer.

201
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:43,328
我要见见这位年轻人
I want to meet this young man.

202
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,868
内廷大臣
为他安排一个欢迎会
Arrange a pIeasant weIcome for him.

203
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:50,105
就这样子了
WeII, there it is!

204
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:15,755
谢谢主

205
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:27,735
这顶假发太适合你了
看起来实在太棒了
This is a beautifuI wig for you.

206
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:29,736
我真的好喜欢
It Iooks so marveIous and I Iove it.

207
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,442
换一顶
The other one.

208
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:37,346
这就是另一顶
我想你一定会喜欢的
Here is the other one.
I think you wiII Iove it.

209
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:43,654
就是这个样子
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.

210
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:47,754
你觉得怎么样
这些都好漂亮
-How do you Iike it?
-They're aII so beautifuI!

211
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,924
我为什么没有三个头
Why don't I have three heads?

212
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:54,332
真是幽默...
This is funny!

213
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:55,462
Three heads!

214
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,345
各位，早安
陛下，早安
怎么样
GentIemen.
-Good morning.
-Morning, Your Majesty.

215
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:06,110
今天为我准备了什么
What do you have for me today?

216
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:08,978
陛下，莫札特先生
-Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.

217
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:10,610
怎么样
-Yes, what about him?

218
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:12,788
他来了
He's here.

219
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,661
就这样子了，很好
WeII, there it is. Good!

220
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:23,529
陛下，希望您不会觉得不得体
可是我写了一首歌欢迎他
I hope you won't find it improper,
but I've written a march in his honor.

221
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:26,660
这样真好，给我看看
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?

222
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:31,868
这只是一个小品
Just a....
Just a trifIe, of course.

223
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:37,845
我可以试试看吗
陛下...
May I try it?

224
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:41,546
我们来开心一下
Let's have some fun.

225
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,034
太棒了，御用作曲家
DeIightfuI, court composer!

226
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,163
他进来的时候
可不可以让我演奏
May I pIay it when he comes in?

227
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:06,867
那我真是太荣耀了，陛下
-You do me too much honor.
-Bring in Herr Mozart.

228
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:10,606
让莫札特先生进来
慢慢的...
But sIowIy.

229
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,511
我需要练习一下
I need a minute to practice.

230
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:30,966
C调...

231
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:38,231
很好，继续
Good, continue.

232
00:29:40,677 --> 00:29:42,201
陛下，G调
G, Majesty.

233
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,048
太好了
ExceIIent!

234
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:51,446
Good, Majesty.

235
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:55,156
非常棒
Continue. Very good.

236
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:58,083
非常棒，陛下
Very good, Majesty.

237
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,231
节奏...
Tempo! Up.

238
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:09,633
轻轻的...有力的
再来一次，陛下
LightIy, then strongIy!
It's a march, Majesty.
Again.

239
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:51,643
太棒了，陛下...
Bravo, Majesty!

240
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:56,412
各位，请不要这么热情，谢谢
GentIemen, pIease.
A IittIe Iess enthusiasm, I beg you.

241
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:01,080
莫札特
陛下

242
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:04,959
这可不是圣物
No, pIease. It's not a hoIy reIic.

243
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:12,429
我们曾经见过面
就在这间房间里
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.

244
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,766
也许你不记得
那时候你只有6岁
You don't recaII. You were onIy 6.

245
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:18,000
那时候他演奏了最棒的协奏曲
He was giving a deIightfuI concert!

246
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:20,576
他从凳子上
爬下来时还滑了一跤
As he got off the stooI, he feII.

247
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,009
我的妹妹安东妮扶他起来
My sister Antoinette heIped him up.

248
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:24,580
你知道他做了什么吗
Know what he did?

249
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:28,708
他跳入她的怀中
问她，你愿不愿意嫁给我
He jumped into her arms and said,
''WiII you marry me? Yes or no?''

250
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:36,282
你一定认识这些男士
You know aII these gentIemen.

251
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:37,553
范史威登公爵
The Baron Van Swieten.

252
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:41,495
年轻人，我相当喜欢你的作品
谢谢
-I'm a great admirer of yours.
-Thank you.

253
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:44,999
卡普麦斯特
先生
Kapellmeister Bonno.

254
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:46,534
我的荣幸
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

255
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:54,567
我们的歌剧院长，罗森保伯爵
这绝对是我的荣幸
Sir, yes. The honor is mine,
absoIuteIy!

256
00:31:54,878 --> 00:32:02,114
这是我们的御用作曲家
萨列里大师
Here is our
iIIustrious court composer...
...Maestro SaIieri.

257
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,152
这真的是令人喜悦
At Iast, such immense joy!

258
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:10,289
我很熟悉您的作品
I know your work weII.

259
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:14,330
我事实上修改过
您的一首作品
You know, I composed some variations
on a meIody of yours.

260
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:18,197
真的，哪一首
MIOCAROADONE
-ReaIIy? Which one?
-''Mio Caro Adone. ''

261
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:19,633
我真是受宠若惊
I'm fIattered.

262
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:23,103
这是一首奇怪的小品
不过有一些不错的结果
A funny tune,
but it yieIded some good things.

263
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:26,073
他现在回报了你的赞美
And now he has returned
the compIiment.

264
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:29,804
萨列里为你写了这首
欢迎你的进行曲
Herr Salieri composed
this IittIe march for you.

265
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:31,574
真的吗
ReaIIy?

266
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:33,909
谢谢你，先生

267
00:32:34,017 --> 00:32:36,645
就是这样子了
现在我们来谈正事
WeII, there it is.

268
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:42,921
年轻人，我们要你写一出歌剧
你觉得怎么样
Down to business. We're going
to commission an opera from you.
What do you say?

269
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,658
陛下

270
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:48,561
我们最后有没有投票
决定德文还是意大利文
Did we vote in the end
for German or ItaIian?

271
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:53,659
陛下，最后我们是
倾向于意大利文的
Sire, if you remember,
we did finaIIy incIine to ItaIian.

272
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:55,494
是吗
Did we?

273
00:32:57,174 --> 00:33:00,507
我认为这还没有决定，陛下
I don't think it was reaIIy decided,
Your Majesty.

274
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:06,906
拜托...我们写德文的
为什么
-German. PIease Iet it be German.
-Why so?

275
00:33:07,017 --> 00:33:10,111
因为我已经找到最精彩的歌词
Because I've aIready found
the most wonderfuI Iibretto.

276
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,552
我有没有见过
Have I seen it?

277
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:17,953
院长阁下应该没有
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.

278
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,829
这是很新的
我会立刻拿来给你看
It's quite new.-I'II show it to you immediateIy.

279
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:22,762
你最好赶快拿来
-I think you'd better.

280
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:28,896
介绍一下，介绍一下故事
WeII...
...teII us about it.
TeII us the story.

281
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:34,768
这是很有趣的，陛下
WeII, it's quite amusing, Majesty.

282
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:40,948
整个故事的背景...
It's set--
The whoIe thing is set in a....

283
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:47,654
在哪里
Yes? Where?

284
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:52,421
整个故事在妓院里发展
In a harem, Majesty.
In a seragIio.

285
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:56,522
你的意思是土耳其
没有错
-You mean in Turkey?
-Yes, exactIy.

286
00:33:57,034 --> 00:34:04,133
那为什么要用德文
其实也不一定要
Then why especiaIIy
does it have to be in German?

287
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:06,932
如果你们喜欢的话
也可以用土耳其文
It doesn't, especiaIIy. It couId be
in Turkish if you reaIIy want.

288
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:12,338
亲爱的朋友
语文已经不是重点了
No, my dear feIIow, the Ianguage
is not finaIIy the point.

289
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:17,546
你认为这个主题
很适合国家剧院吗
Do you reaIIy think that subject
is appropriate for a nationaI theater?

290
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:21,323
有何不可，故事很精彩
Why not? It's charming.

291
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:27,559
我又不会真的让妓女露出...
I mean, I won't actuaIIy show
concubines exposing their....

292
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:32,327
这绝对不是非礼的
这是非常崇高的，陛下
It's not indecent.
It's highIy moraI, Majesty.

293
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:34,996
充满了德意志精神与价值观
It's fuII of proper German virtues.

294
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:39,508
对不起，陛下
什么是德意志精神
Excuse me, Majesty, but what
do you think these couId be?

295
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:41,873
我是一个外国人
我想要学习
Being a foreigner, I'd Iove to Iearn.

296
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,246
告诉他，莫札特
什么是德意志精神
WeII, teII him, Mozart.
Name us a German virtue.

297
00:34:49,352 --> 00:34:50,478
爱，陛下
-Love, sire.
-Oh, Iove!

298
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:55,890
当然是爱
我们意大利人不懂爱
Of course, in ItaIy
we know nothing about Iove.

299
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:02,157
我不认为你们懂
No, I don't think you do.

300
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:07,202
看意大利歌剧时
那么多的高音在吼，尖叫
Watching ItaIian opera,
aII those maIe sopranos screeching...

301
00:35:07,304 --> 00:35:09,238
一对肥胖的情侣
在那里翻白眼，抛媚眼
...fat coupIes roIIing their eyes
about. 

302
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:12,399
那不是爱情，那是垃圾
That's not Iove. It's rubbish!

303
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:17,835
陛下，你选择语文
Majesty, you choose the Ianguage.

304
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:22,749
我的责任是
使这成为最优秀的歌剧
I'II set it to the finest music
ever offered a monarch.

305
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:24,252
就这样子了
WeII, there it is.

306
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:26,545
那就选德文吧
Let it be German.

307
00:35:26,656 --> 00:35:29,856
这是你的
This is yours.

308
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:33,219
留下来吧，陛下
这已经印在我的脑中了
Keep it.
It's aIready here in my head.

309
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:39,631
你只有听过一次
我想是吧，陛下
What? On one hearing onIy?
I think so, sire. Yes.

310
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:45,106
秀给我们看
Show us.

311
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:16,601
其余的都是一样的，是不是
The rest is the same, isn't it?

312
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:23,276
这里好像不太顺
Doesn't reaIIy work, does it?

313
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,242
你有没有试过...
Did you try...?

314
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:31,715
是不是应该比较...
ShouIdn't it be a bit more...?

315
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:37,992
这样子比较好...对...就这样
Or this?
This. Yes.

316
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:43,294
好听吗？你们认为如何
Better?
What do you think?

317
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:33,207
谢谢主

318
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:40,088
我所要的只是歌颂上帝
All I ever wanted
was to sing to God.

319
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:46,887
她给了我这种欲望
可是又使我哑巴
He gave me that Ionging...
...and then made me mute.
Why?

320
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:50,233
为什么，告诉我
TeII me that.

321
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:55,234
如果她不要我用音乐去赞美她
If he didn't want me
to praise him with music...

322
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:57,670
为什么要给我欲望
...why impIant the desire...

323
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:04,569
就好像是生理上的欲望
却又不给我才华
...Iike a Iust in my body?
And then deny me the taIent?

324
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:11,482
卡瓦里瑞夫人来上课了，大师
Madame CavaIieri is here
for her Iesson, sir.

325
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,149
Maestro.

326
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:17,482
怎么样
WeII...?

327
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:20,323
你喜欢吗
How do you Iike it?

328
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:24,561
这是土耳其式的
It's Turkish.

329
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:28,160
我的美发师说
今年流行的是土耳其风格
My hairdresser said everything
this year's going to be Turkish.

330
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:30,336
是吗
Does he?

331
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:37,772
他今天还告诉你什么
What eIse did he teII you today?

332
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:42,815
告诉我最新的传闻
Come, come!
Give me some gossip.

333
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:48,813
听说你见过莫札特先生
WeII, I heard you met Herr Mozart.

334
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:54,592
维也纳的消息传的真快
News traveIs fast in Vienna.

335
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:59,260
听说他被聘用要写一出歌剧
And he's been commissioned
to write an opera. Is it true?

336
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:01,097
是的
-Yes.

337
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:05,867
有没有留给我的角色
没有
-Is there a part in it for me?
-No.

338
00:39:04,874 --> 00:39:06,273
你怎么知道
-How do you know?

339
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,708
你知道故事的剧情是什么吗
-Do you know where it's set, my dear?
-Where?

340
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:11,844
是什么
妓院
In a harem.

341
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:17,147
那是什么
妓女院
-What's that?
-A brotheI.

342
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:24,249
来，我们开始吧
Come.
Let's begin.

343
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:27,853
他的外表怎么样
莫札特吗
-What does he Iook Iike?
-Mozart?

344
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:31,459
你也许会失望
为什么
-You might be disappointed.
-Why?

345
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:36,066
外表与才华往往不是搭配的
Looks and taIent don't aIways
go together, Katerina.

346
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,909
我可不管外表，大师
Looks don't concern me, maestro.

347
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:43,809
有品味的女人在乎的只是才华
OnIy taIent interests
a woman of taste.

348
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:46,547
我们要不要继续
ShaII we continue?

349
00:40:24,788 --> 00:40:26,221
她就在台上
There she was.

350
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:31,153
我不知道他们在哪儿认识
是怎么认识的
I don't know where they met or how.
There she stoodl

351
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:35,664
她就站在台上，给大家看
On stuge, for all to see.

352
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:39,427
像个贪婪的黄莺一样
炫耀给大家看
Showing off like
the greedy songbird she was.

353
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:17,934
十分钟的音阶
Ten minutes of ghastIy scaIes.
Arpeggios!

354
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:21,943
上上下下，好像游乐场的烟火
Whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground.

355
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:36,616
请你了解
当时我爱上了这位小姐
Understand, I was
in Iove with the girI.

356
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:39,688
至少我渴望她
Or at Ieast in Iust.

357
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:44,890
可是我对你发誓
我碰都没有碰过她
And I swear to you,
I never Iaid a finger on her.

358
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:54,944
不管如何，我无法忍受
任何人去碰她
AII the same, I couIdn't bear
to think of anyone eIse touching her.

359
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:58,571
特别是那个怪物
Least of aII, ''the creature.''

360
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:38,236
快走...

361
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:43,709
太棒了，夫人
Brava, madame!

362
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:47,081
你真是我们舞台上的珠宝
You are an ornament to our stage.

363
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:49,057
陛下
Your Majesty.

364
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:58,358
莫札特先生，杰作
不，这真的是太杰出了
WeII, Herr Mozart.
A good effort.
WeII, decidedIy that.

365
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,136
你今天晚上令我们...
An exceIIent effort!
You have shown us something...

366
00:44:03,206 --> 00:44:05,436
大开眼界
-...quite new tonight.
-It is new.

367
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:09,102
这是很新颖的，是不是
是的
-It is, isn't it, sire?
-Yes, indeed.

368
00:44:09,212 --> 00:44:16,846
那您真的喜欢吗
当然喜欢，太精彩了
So then, you Iiked it?
You reaIIy Iiked it, sire?
WeII, of course I did!
It's very good!

369
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:25,186
只不过偶尔有一点...
Of course, now and then--
Just now and then...
...it seemed a touch....

370
00:44:25,294 --> 00:44:27,023
您是什么意思，陛下
What do you mean, sire?

371
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:32,267
偶尔有一点...
WeII, I mean, occasionaIIy,
it seems to have....

372
00:44:32,368 --> 00:44:34,734
这该怎么说
How shaII one say...?

373
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,772
这该怎么说，院长
How shaII one say, direktor?

374
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:42,544
太多的音符，陛下
正是
-Too many notes, Majesty?
-ExactIy. Very weII put.

375
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:45,443
说的好，太多的音符
-Too many notes.
-I don't understand.

376
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:52,820
我不了解，音符是我所要的
没有更多也没有更少
There are as many notes as
are required, neither more nor Iess.

377
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:59,618
亲爱的朋友，一个晚上
人只能听那么多的音符
My dear feIIow, there are in fact...
...onIy so many notes
the ear can hear in an evening.

378
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:05,260
我想这么说应该对吧
御用作曲家
I'm right in saying that,
aren't I, court composer?

379
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:09,036
是的...
Yes. 

380
00:45:09,138 --> 00:45:11,231
整体来说，是的，陛下
On the whoIe, yes, Majesty.

381
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,898
这真是太荒谬了
This is absurd!

382
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:19,175
年轻人，别难过
你的作品非常的杰出
Young man, don't take it too hard.
Your work is ingenious.
It's quaIity work.

383
00:45:19,282 --> 00:45:24,219
只不过音符实在太多了
少一点音符就完美了
There are simpIy too many notes.
Just cut a few and it'II be perfect.

384
00:45:25,288 --> 00:45:27,222
您希望少多少音符，陛下
Which few did you have in mind?

385
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:33,929
伍尔夫...亲爱的
WoIfgang!
WoIfgang, my dear!

386
00:45:35,465 --> 00:45:37,262
伍尔夫
-WoIfgang!
-Majesty, this is Frau Weber.

387
00:45:37,366 --> 00:45:42,193
陛下，这是韦伯夫人
她是我的房东
She's my IandIady.

388
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:52,213
荣幸，夫人
陛下，真是荣幸
-Enchanted, madame.
-Sire, such an honor!

389
00:45:53,382 --> 00:46:01,186
这是我的女儿，康丝汀
她是莫札特先生的未婚妻
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.
-She's the fiancae of Herr Mozart.

390
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,748
真的吗
-ReaIIy?

391
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:07,489
真是迷人
How charming.

392
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:09,087
请
 PIease.

393
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:26,714
怎么样
WeII, 

394
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:29,278
你们什么时候要结婚
when do you marry?

395
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:35,821
这个...
我们还没有得到父亲的同意
We haven't exactIy received
my father's consent yet.

396
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:39,452
还没有万事具备
Not entireIy. Not aItogether.

397
00:46:42,665 --> 00:46:47,568
对不起，你几岁了
26岁
-Excuse me, but how oId are you?
-Twenty-six.

398
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:52,302
我对你的建议是
娶了这位迷人的小姐
My advice is for you to marry
this charming young Iady...

399
00:46:52,408 --> 00:46:54,273
和我们一起待在维也纳
-...and stay with us in Vienna.
-You see?

400
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:59,110
我对他说过了，陛下
可是他不听我的话
I toId him that,
but he won't Iisten to me.

401
00:46:59,215 --> 00:47:06,144
陛下，你真的是提供了
这么棒的皇家建议
Your Majesty,
you give such wonderfuI...

402
00:47:03,452 --> 00:47:08,382
我可不可以...
...such royaI advice. May I...?

403
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,098
就是这样子了
WeII, there it is.

404
00:47:21,337 --> 00:47:23,396
可不可以去拿一点水来
Get some water!

405
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,775
请你拿一点水来
WiII you get some water, pIease?

406
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,148
伍尔夫，快拿水来
WoIfie, get some water!

407
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:47,926
借过...
Excuse me. Excuse me.

408
00:47:55,137 --> 00:47:56,502
你知道这件事吗？
Did you know?

409
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,139
知道什么？
-What?

410
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:00,436
这个婚事
-The marriage.

411
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:05,207
这跟你有何关系？
What does it matter to you?

412
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:09,975
没关系，我才不管他要娶谁
Nothing. He can marry who he pIeases,
I don't give a damn.

413
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,613
我表现的如何？
How was I?

414
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,584
实在太好了
You were subIime.

415
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:20,690
你觉得曲写得好吗
And what did you think of the music?

416
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:24,589
非常的棒
ExtremeIy cIever.

417
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:27,893
卡夫人，我...
Katerina, I--

418
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:30,769
对不起
Excuse me.

419
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:33,769
那个肥女人还躺在舞台上吗
Is that woman stiII Iying
on the fIoor?

420
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:36,612
醒了，没事
-No, she's fine.

421
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:39,640
那我就放心了
-Oh, I'm so reIieved.

422
00:48:41,017 --> 00:48:44,350
莫札特，我衷心的恭喜你
Dear Mozart,
my sincere congratuIations.

423
00:48:44,754 --> 00:48:46,244
你喜欢吗
-Did you Iike it then?

424
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:47,617
我爱极了
-How couId I not?

425
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:52,318
这可说是世界级的水准，是吗
It's the best music
in Vienna today, agree?

426
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:55,022
她的床上功夫一定非常棒
She must be dazzIing in bed.

427
00:48:58,034 --> 00:49:01,731
我想她还是个处女吧
I assume she's the virtuoso
in that department.

428
00:49:01,837 --> 00:49:04,806
否则你怎么会
想要娶这样的女人呢
No other reason why
you'd marry someone Iike that.

429
00:49:07,243 --> 00:49:08,540
请进
Come in.

430
00:49:11,747 --> 00:49:15,239
打扰了，妈妈觉得不舒服
Excuse me.
WoIfie, Mom isn't feeIing very weII.

431
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:17,376
我们可以回家了吗？
当然
-Can we go home?
-Yes.

432
00:49:17,486 --> 00:49:23,520
不...他还不能走呢
今天是他的好日子
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.
This is his night.

433
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:25,987
你不介绍一下未婚妻吗？
Won't you introduce us, WoIfgang?

434
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:29,196
失陪了，晚安，各位
Excuse us, Fraulein.
Good night.

435
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:39,167
那一刻我就知道
毫无疑问地，他掌握了她
At that moment I knew,
beyond any doubt...
...he'd had her.

436
00:49:39,408 --> 00:49:42,434
那个怪物夺走了我的宝贝
The creature had
had my darling girl.

437
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,915
这真的是无法理解
It was incomprehensibIe!

438
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:56,314
上帝到底有何意图
What was God up to?

439
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,986
上帝是否在测试我？
Was it possibIe I was being tested?

440
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:09,634
想要让我了解宽恕的意义
而不要心生攻击
Was God expecting me
to offer forgiveness...
...in the face of every offense?

441
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:11,839
不管有多么地痛苦
No matter how painfuI?

442
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:15,939
这很有可能
It's very possibIe.
But why him?

443
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:24,818
为何是他，选他来测试我
太没人性了
Why choose Mozart
to teach me Iessons in humiIity?

444
00:50:25,654 --> 00:50:30,957
我心中充满了
对那年轻人的恨意
My heart was fiIIing up...
...with such hatred
for that IittIe man.

445
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:40,661
这是我一生中第一次
心中有了残暴的想法
For the first time in my Iife,
I began to know...
...reaIIy...
...vioIent thoughts.

446
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:46,164
每天，甚至隔几个小时
我就祷告
Every day, sometimes for hours,
I would pray.

447
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:55,345
主啊，请求你，让他走吧
Lord...
...pIease...
...send him away...

448
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:57,719
就此打住
...back to SaIzburg.

449
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:05,693
为了他好，也是为了我好
For his sake...
...as weII as mine.

450
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,457
不，我不接纳他
阁下
-No! I won't have him back.
-But, Your Grace--

451
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:17,005
你的儿子没有道德
被宠坏了，自大
Your son is an unprincipIed,
spoiIed, conceited brat!

452
00:51:18,874 --> 00:51:23,671
阁下，这是事实
Yes, sir...
...that is the truth.

453
00:51:25,247 --> 00:51:30,275
可是不要责怪他
这全都是我的错
But don't bIame him.
The fauIt is mine, entireIy.

454
00:51:30,586 --> 00:51:32,645
我太宠他了
I was too induIgent with him.

455
00:51:34,056 --> 00:51:39,857
求求你，阁下
再给他一次机会
PIease, Your Grace?
Give him one more chance?

456
00:51:41,197 --> 00:51:47,896
我准许你去试试看
上帝保佑您，阁下
You have Ieave to try.
God bIess, Your Grace!
I thank Your Grace.

457
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:50,072
感谢您，阁下
I thank you!

458
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:58,210
我有紧急的要事告诉你
我要来维也纳了
I write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.

459
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:02,345
直到我们见面
不准进行婚事
Take no further steps
towards marriage until we meet.

460
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:10,487
我是把一生都奉献给你的父亲
请你等待我的来临
As you honor the father who has
devoted his life to yours...
...do as I bid,
and await my coming.

461
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:28,238
我宣布你们二人结为夫妻
I now join you in the hoIy bonds
of matrimony.

462
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:34,111
上帝所结合的二人
没有任何人能够拆散
Those whom God hath joined together...
...Iet no man put asunder.

463
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:40,647
以天父，天子，圣灵之名

464
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:52,760
亲爱的父亲，你曾经说过
维也纳是音乐家的城市
Beloved father:

465
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:54,961
能够征服这里
就是征服全欧洲
You say Vienna is the musicians' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.

466
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,867
有了我的妻子
现在我办得到
With my wife I can do it.

467
00:52:56,972 --> 00:52:58,735
不久后，当我发财了
One day, when I'm wealthy...

468
00:52:58,841 --> 00:53:01,537
你可以过来和我们一起住
我们会非常的快乐
...you'll come and live with us,
and we'll be so happy.

469
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:16,913
早安，御用作曲家
这是我的侄女伊莉莎白公主
Good morning.
This is my niece, Princess EIizabeth.

470
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:18,084
殿下
Your Highness.

471
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:25,465
她请我去见一位音乐老师
我有了一个很好的构想
She's asked me to recommend
a musicaI instructor.
-I've come up with an exceIIent idea.
-Your Majesty!

472
00:53:24,266 --> 00:53:28,660
陛下，这真的是我的荣幸
It wouId be such a tremendous honor!

473
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:33,198
我本来想的是莫札特先生
你有什么看法
I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?

474
00:53:34,977 --> 00:53:40,940
这个构想很有趣，可是...
怎么说
It's an interesting idea, Majesty.
But....
Yes?

475
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:48,817
我所关切的是
免得您被人们说闲话
My concern is to protect you...
...from any hint of favoritism.

476
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:55,093
徇私
Favoritism.

477
00:53:55,331 --> 00:53:58,027
怎么了，内廷大臣
什么怎么了
-What is this?
-What is what?

478
00:53:58,133 --> 00:54:03,571
为什么我的作品要送交委员会
又要教一个13岁女孩音乐
Why must I submit sampIes of my work
to a committee, to teach a girI?

479
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,470
这是陛下的旨意
Because His Majesty wishes it.

480
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,735
陛下生了我的气吗
Is the emperor angry with me?

481
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,144
正好相反
那他为什么不指派我
-On the contrary.
-Then why not appoint me to the post?

482
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:18,652
莫札特，你不是
维也纳唯一的作曲家
Mozart, you're not
the onIy composer in Vienna.

483
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:22,019
没错，可是我是最好的
No. But I'm the best.

484
00:54:23,092 --> 00:54:24,218
莫札特
Mozart.

485
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:28,857
谦虚一点对你也许比较好
A IittIe modesty
might suit you better.

486
00:54:36,972 --> 00:54:39,031
委员会有哪一些委员
Who is on this committee?

487
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:44,176
卡普麦斯特，罗森保伯爵
还有御用作曲家萨列里
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count
Orsini-Rosenberg and SaIieri.

488
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,944
当然，那些意大利人
总是那些意大利人
NaturaIIy, the ItaIians!
Of course, aIways the ItaIians!

489
00:54:49,184 --> 00:54:51,152
他们都是音乐白痴
They're aII musicaI idiots!

490
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:56,053
你要他们来评论我的音乐
-And you want them to judge my music?
-Young man...

491
00:54:56,158 --> 00:55:02,290
年轻人，问题很简单
...the issue is quite simpIe.
If you want this position...

492
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:06,895
如果你要这份职位
和同行一起拿出作品送审
...you must submit your stuff
aIong with aII your coIIeagues.

493
00:55:07,002 --> 00:55:08,401
我必须吗
Must I?

494
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:12,429
我不干
WeII, I won't.

495
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:15,066
我们要如何过活呢，伍尔夫？
How are we supposed to Iive?

496
00:55:16,812 --> 00:55:19,110
你要我上街乞讨吗？
Do you want me to beg on the streets?

497
00:55:19,682 --> 00:55:20,944
笨蛋
Don't be stupid.

498
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:25,449
他们只是想要看你的作品
-AII they want to see is your work.
-Shit.

499
00:55:25,688 --> 00:55:27,019
那样有什么不好
-What's wrong with that?

500
00:55:27,122 --> 00:55:29,522
闭嘴，给我闭嘴
-Shut up! Just shut up.

501
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:34,957
那些皇家贵族
怎么可能来求你呢？
One royaI pupiI,
and aII of Vienna wiII come fIocking.

502
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:36,588
他们就是会来的
They'II come anyway.

503
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,397
不会的
-No, they won't.

504
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:41,830
他们喜欢我
-They Iove me here.

505
00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:43,131
我知道这里行事规范
-I know how things work in this city.

506
00:55:43,238 --> 00:55:45,502
你真是个万事通
-You know everything.

507
00:56:16,038 --> 00:56:17,062
对不起
-Yes?
-Excuse me, sir.

508
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:19,640
外面有一位女子要见您
-A Iady insists on taIking to you.

509
00:56:19,742 --> 00:56:21,232
是谁？
不知道
-Who?
She didn't say,

510
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:23,243
她说有紧急的事情要见您
but she says it's urgent.

511
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:27,742
失陪一下，亲爱的
Excuse me, my dear.

512
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:34,622
先生阁下
Your ExceIIency.

513
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:37,653
我能帮你什么忙
How can I heIp you?

514
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,089
莫札特太太
-Frau Mozart?

515
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:47,794
我是为了我丈夫来的
-I've come on behaIf of my husband.

516
00:56:47,903 --> 00:56:52,931
我带来他的作品
让他有机会得到皇室的工作
I brought sampIes of his work so he
can be considered for the appointment.

517
00:56:55,043 --> 00:57:00,276
这真的是太好了
他为什么没有自己来
How charming,
but why did he not come himseIf?

518
00:57:00,816 --> 00:57:04,013
先生，他非常的忙
He's terribIy busy, sir.

519
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:09,480
这个我了解
I understand.

520
00:57:10,793 --> 00:57:16,026
我一有时间我就会看
这是我的荣幸
I'II Iook at them the moment I can.

521
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:18,691
请代我向他致意
It wiII be an honor.
PIease give him my warmest regards.

522
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:22,635
如果你现在就看会不会太麻烦
WouId it be too much troubIe
to ask you to Iook at them now?

523
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:25,501
我在这里等
-WhiIe I wait.
-I'm afraid I'm not at Ieisure...

524
00:57:25,607 --> 00:57:30,309
我现在这一刻恐怕没有时间
...this precise moment.

525
00:57:30,646 --> 00:57:33,638
放在我这里
我保证一定会很安全的
Leave them.
I assure you, they wiII be safe.

526
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:37,712
我恐怕不能这么做
I reaIIy cannot do that, sir.

527
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:46,358
他不知道我来了
你不是他派来的
You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
He didn't send you?

528
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:51,160
不是，这是我的想法
No, sir. This was my own idea.

529
00:57:53,035 --> 00:57:54,525
我明白了
-I see.
-Sir, we're desperate.

530
00:57:54,636 --> 00:58:00,897
先生，我们穷途末路了
我们真的需要这份工作
We reaIIy need this job.

531
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:04,704
我的先生花的钱
超出他所赚到的
My husband spends far more
than he can ever earn.

532
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:06,940
我不是说他懒懒
他一点都不懒
I don't mean that he's Iazy,
because he works aII day Iong.

533
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:13,750
他一整天都在工作
只是他不实际
It's just that he's not practicaI.

534
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:18,048
他就是守不住钱
这真是太可笑了
Money simpIy sIips through
his fingers. It's ridicuIous.

535
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:26,463
要不要吃点糖
你知道这是什么吗
Let me offer you some refreshment.
Do you know what these are?

536
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:32,272
这是维娜斯的乳头
Capezzoli di Venere!
NippIes of Venus.

537
00:58:32,941 --> 00:58:36,035
这是包白兰地糖的核桃
你吃一颗
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied
sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!

538
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:40,178
吃吃看，非常的美味
They're quite surprising.

539
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:47,011
好好吃
They're wonderfuI!

540
00:58:49,424 --> 00:58:54,890
谢谢你，阁下
不要这么叫我
Thank you very much, Your ExceIIency.
Don't keep caIIing me that.

541
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:57,762
这样子有距离感
Keeps me at such a distance.

542
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:02,595
我不是一出生
就是御用作曲家的
I wasn't born a court composer,
you know.

543
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:06,935
我和你丈夫一样都是小镇人
I'm from a smaII town.
Just Iike your husband.

544
00:59:09,811 --> 00:59:15,681
你确定你不能留下这个
稍后再回来
Are you sure you can't...
...Ieave this and come back again?

545
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:23,754
虽然听起来很不错
可是这是不可能的
It's very tempting, sir.
But it's impossibIe, I'm afraid.

546
00:59:24,726 --> 00:59:27,752
如果他知道这不见了
他一定会发疯的
He'd be frantic
if he knew they were missing.

547
00:59:27,863 --> 00:59:29,387
这是原稿
You see, they're aII originaIs.

548
00:59:31,733 --> 00:59:35,225
原稿
他从来不会复写
-OriginaIs?
-Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

549
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:50,474
这些是原稿
These...
...are originaIs?

550
01:00:26,755 --> 01:00:31,826
太不可思议了
那根本超越理解
Astoundingl
It was actuaIIy--
It was beyond beIief.

551
01:00:32,928 --> 01:00:37,958
这是唯一的版本
These were first and onIy...
...drafts of music.

552
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:43,196
完全没有任何的修正
But they showed no corrections
of any kind. 

553
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:44,636
一点都没有
Not one.

554
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:54,108
他只是写出脑中的音乐
He had simply written down music...
...aIready finished in his head.

555
01:00:54,783 --> 01:01:00,221
一页接着一页
好像他在听写一样
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.

556
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:12,959
而这是前所未见的悦耳音乐
And music...
...finished as no music
is ever finished.

557
01:01:16,438 --> 01:01:21,737
换了一个音符就不完美
DispIace one note...
...and there wouId be diminishment.

558
01:01:23,278 --> 01:01:27,408
换了一段音节
结构就会瓦解
DispIace one phrase,
the structure wouId faII.

559
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:41,254
我现在了解在大主教公馆
所听到的音乐不是意外
It was clear to me...
...that sound I had heard
in the archbishop's palace...
...had been no accident.

560
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:47,300
我又听到了上帝的天籁
Here again
was the very voice of God.

561
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:58,004
我透过音符所架成的铁笼看到
I was staring through the cage...
...of those meticuIous ink strokes...

562
01:01:59,347 --> 01:02:03,750
最纯粹的美
...at an absoIute beauty.

563
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:20,201
这个不够好吗
Is it not good?

564
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:27,103
这简直太棒了
It is miracuIous!

565
01:02:31,446 --> 01:02:34,813
是的，他对他的作品引以为傲
Yes, he's very proud of his work.

566
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,917
你会帮助我们吗
So you wiII heIp us?

567
01:02:42,491 --> 01:02:49,030
明晚我与陛下共进晚餐时
可以帮他提一下
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening.
One word from me and the post is his.

568
01:02:49,164 --> 01:02:52,395
谢谢，阁下
Thank you, Your ExceIIency!
Thank you!

569
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:53,861
今晚再过来
Come back tonight.

570
01:02:56,438 --> 01:02:57,666
晚上？
-Tonight?

571
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:58,931
独自过来
-AIone.

572
01:03:01,243 --> 01:03:02,335
为什么？
What for?

573
01:03:04,246 --> 01:03:07,044
天下没有白吃的晚餐
Some service
deserves service in return.

574
01:03:09,484 --> 01:03:10,712
懂吗？
No?

575
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,147
什么意思？
-What do you mean?
-Isn't it obvious?

576
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:19,890
还不明白吗？这是游戏规则
It's a post aII Vienna seeks.

577
01:03:20,762 --> 01:03:23,959
如果你想帮你丈夫
晚上再过来
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.

578
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:28,000
我是已婚妇人
I'm a married woman, sir.

579
01:03:28,103 --> 01:03:29,934
那就不要来了
Then don't.

580
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:31,704
随便你
It's up to you.

581
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:36,273
没有付出那有收获
And not to be vague,
that is the price.

582
01:03:48,456 --> 01:03:50,856
这不是上帝的怜悯
There is no God of mercy, Father.

583
01:03:54,062 --> 01:03:56,553
上帝是要折磨我
Just a God of torture.

584
01:04:03,171 --> 01:04:04,900
夜晚到来了
Evening came.

585
01:04:06,174 --> 01:04:09,974
我真希望她不要来了
I sat there,
not knowing whether she'd return.

586
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:15,613
我从未如此认真的祈祷
I prayed as I have
never prayed before.

587
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:19,718
亲爱的上帝
Dear God...

588
01:04:19,821 --> 01:04:26,820
给予我能力
让我写出真正的音乐
...enter me now.
Fill me with one piece of true music.

589
01:04:27,195 --> 01:04:31,598
让我知道你还是会眷顾我的
One piece with your breath in it,
so I know that you love me.

590
01:04:32,901 --> 01:04:39,431
让我感受你的爱
也让我能回馈你
Show me one sign of your favor,
and I will show mine to Mozart.

591
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:43,238
我就会协助莫札特进入委员会
I will get him the royal position.

592
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:47,648
给我能力，请求你
Enter me.
PIease.

593
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:51,549
请求你
PIease!

594
01:04:58,159 --> 01:04:59,353
什么事？
Yes?

595
01:05:03,465 --> 01:05:05,490
那位女士又来了
That Iady is back, sir.

596
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:12,204
请她进来
Show her in.

597
01:05:45,674 --> 01:05:47,073
怎样
WeII?

598
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:50,208
我来了
I'm here.

599
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:57,350
我先生去听音乐会
My husband has gone to a concert.

600
01:05:58,186 --> 01:06:00,882
He didn't think I wouId enjoy it.

601
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,929
我们要去哪里
WeII, where shaII we go?

602
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:18,162
在这里吗
ShouId we stay here?

603
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:21,902
WeII....

604
01:06:25,613 --> 01:06:27,911
你还要看这作品吗？
You stiII want to Iook at these?

605
01:06:31,252 --> 01:06:33,812
或是可以省了
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

606
01:06:36,624 --> 01:06:40,116
因为不需要这样看了...
Suppose we don't, reaIIy.

607
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:37,741
把这个女人赶出去
Show this woman out.

608
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:02,134
亲爱的
Stanzi.

609
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:04,811
Stanzi.

610
01:08:10,819 --> 01:08:12,184
怎么了
What is it?

611
01:08:13,655 --> 01:08:14,849
什么事情？
What's the matter?

612
01:08:15,457 --> 01:08:16,549
告诉我
TeII me.

613
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:21,759
告诉我
TeII me.

614
01:08:27,702 --> 01:08:33,766
我爱你...
I Iove you.
I Iove you.

615
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:37,306
从此以后我们誓不两立
From now on, we are enemies.

616
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:39,946
你和我
You and I.

617
01:08:40,482 --> 01:08:48,753
因为你选择了自大，色情，下流
幼稚的男孩做为你的工具
You choose for your instrument...
...a boastful, lustful,
smutty, infantile boy...

618
01:08:48,857 --> 01:08:53,726
你所给我的奖励
是让我能够了解他的才华
...and give me for reward only the
ability to recognize the incarnation.

619
01:08:54,729 --> 01:09:00,861
因为你不公道，不公平
Because you are unjust...
...unfair...

620
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:04,867
不仁慈，我拒绝你
...unkind...
...I will block you.

621
01:09:05,373 --> 01:09:08,171
我发誓，我要去伤害
你在世上的代言人
I swear it.

622
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:14,237
我要尽我的能力去害他
我要毁了你的工具
I will hinder and harm
your creature on earth...
...as far as I am able.

623
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:17,709
陛下，我不是个爱说
说别的音乐家坏话的人
I don't Iike to taIk
against a feIIow musician.

624
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:19,081
当然
Of course not.

625
01:09:19,587 --> 01:09:21,452
我必须向您禀报
I have to teII you.

626
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:27,352
年轻的女孩子是不能
与莫札特独处在一起
Mozart is not entireIy to be trusted
aIone with young Iadies.

627
01:09:28,296 --> 01:09:29,786
真的吗？
ReaIIy?

628
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:34,665
事实上，我有一位学生
非常年轻的女声乐家
One of my own pupiIs,
a very young singer...

629
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:38,966
卡瓦里瑞夫人告诉我，她...
...Maria Theresa Paradis...
...toId me she was....

630
01:09:40,642 --> 01:09:42,769
WeII....

631
01:09:44,946 --> 01:09:46,811
说了什么？
WeII, what?

632
01:09:47,815 --> 01:09:53,583
至少已经跟她发生两次的关系
MoIested, Majesty.
Twice, in the course of
the same Iesson.

633
01:09:58,593 --> 01:10:02,495
主人，莫札特先生在书房等您
There is a Herr Mozart
waiting for you in the saIon.

634
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:08,199
他们选了谁？
-Whom did they choose?

635
01:10:08,937 --> 01:10:10,029
桑摩
-Herr Zummer.

636
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:12,103
桑摩
Herr Zummer?

637
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,671
他只是个平庸的人
But the man's a fooI!
He's a totaI mediocrity.

638
01:10:15,777 --> 01:10:20,305
不...他连平庸都不如
No, no. He has yet
to achieve mediocrity.

639
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:27,417
无论如何
我一定要争取到这个职位
I can't Iose this post.
I simpIy can't.

640
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:38,960
阁下，拜托，我们去面圣
告诉陛下，选桑摩是大错特错
ExceIIency, pIease.
Let's go to the paIace.
You can taIk to the emperor...
...and teII him that Herr Zummer
is an awfuI choice.

641
01:10:39,367 --> 01:10:42,825
这对伊莉莎白公主的音乐品味
影响甚巨
He couId do musicaI harm
to the princess.

642
01:10:42,937 --> 01:10:48,307
私底下老实跟你说
公主根本没有音乐品味
Between us, no one in the worId
couId do musicaI harm to the princess.

643
01:10:52,113 --> 01:10:53,080
这样
Look...

644
01:10:53,848 --> 01:10:59,016
我必须要教学生了
否则我活不下去了
...I must have pupiIs.
Without pupiIs, I can't manage.

645
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:02,551
你的生活不是一切如常吗
You don't mean
you're Iiving in poverty?

646
01:11:02,824 --> 01:11:05,452
没有，我已经破产了
No, but I'm broke.

647
01:11:06,494 --> 01:11:08,155
这怎么可能呢？
WeII, how is this possibIe?

648
01:11:08,796 --> 01:11:12,095
你所写的作品都很成功啊
I hear your concerts are
quite successfuI.

649
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,464
就是因为太成功了
They're stupendousIy successfuI.

650
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,299
这无法得到工作
You can't get a seat.

651
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:19,669
问题就是没人有意愿请我
The troubIe is, no one wiII hire me.

652
01:11:19,774 --> 01:11:25,337
只想听我弹奏，不敢请我教音乐
觉得我太神圣了
They won't Iet me teach their
daughters, as if I was a fiend.

653
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:37,088
说真格的
您是否可以借我一些钱呢
SeriousIy...
...is there any chance
you couId manage a Ioan?

654
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:42,255
只要六个月
或是八个月之后就还你
OnIy for six months.
Eight, at the most.

655
01:11:42,363 --> 01:11:45,594
你是说八个月后你就会变富有了
You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?

656
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:48,967
事实上是真的
As a matter of fact, I do.

657
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:55,538
我现在脑子里面
有个爆炸性的作品
I am working on something that wiII
expIode Iike a bomb aII over Europe.

658
01:11:55,643 --> 01:11:57,770
一旦完成
我就会变成维也纳最富有的人
I'II be the richest man in Vienna.

659
01:11:57,879 --> 01:12:00,507
到时我就可以加倍奉还
I'II pay you back doubIe.

660
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:02,640
你说要几倍都可以
You name the terms.

661
01:12:03,117 --> 01:12:04,414
这真好
WeII, how exciting.

662
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,252
告诉我你在做什么
TeII me more.

663
01:12:10,191 --> 01:12:11,954
抱歉，这是个小秘密
It's a bit of a secret.

664
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,687
说啊...我很有兴趣
-Come, come. I'm interested.

665
01:12:13,795 --> 01:12:15,763
这真好吃，是什么点心？
-This is deIicious. What is it?

666
01:12:17,565 --> 01:12:18,998
这是奶油起司
Cream cheese mixed with sugar...

667
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:25,039
加上一颗一颗的糖，打起泡泡
极品，真的很好吃
...suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.

668
01:12:25,139 --> 01:12:26,299
真不错
ItaIian.

669
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:31,535
当然
每个人都喜欢自己国家的食品
Forgive me. We aII have
patriotic feeIings of some kind.

670
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:36,949
我...只需要200元
Two thou--
Two hundred fIorins.
That's aII I need.

671
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:40,686
100元就好
A hundred.

672
01:12:42,957 --> 01:12:44,356
50元好了
Fifty.

673
01:12:45,393 --> 01:12:47,361
你到底在做什么？
What exactIy are you working on?

674
01:12:49,597 --> 01:12:51,497
我...

675
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:53,794
我实在不能告诉你？
ReaIIy, I can't say.

676
01:12:55,203 --> 01:13:01,335
在维也纳你不能只光靠
莫札特三个字行走
I don't think you shouId become known
in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.

677
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:15,781
尽管如此，我可以介绍个人
给你认识，他有个女儿
However...
...I know a distinguished
gentIeman I can recommend, and...
...he has a daughter.

678
01:13:20,962 --> 01:13:23,522
安静
Quiet! Quiet!

679
01:13:23,931 --> 01:13:25,193
莫札特
Herr Mozart.

680
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:29,934
他们太紧张了，不要理他们
WeIcome. Pay no attention,
they're impossibIe.

681
01:13:30,037 --> 01:13:32,733
我待他们就像自己的孩子一般
I treat them just Iike
my own chiIdren.

682
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:35,804
我要教哪一个？
Which of them do you
wish me to teach?

683
01:13:40,581 --> 01:13:42,048
好笑
That's funny.

684
01:13:43,317 --> 01:13:44,978
你真是幽默
You're a funny feIIow.

685
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,188
这里就是音乐房
This is the instrument.

686
01:13:48,289 --> 01:13:50,883
我希望你会满意
I hope it wiII be to your satisfaction.

687
01:13:50,992 --> 01:13:53,222
他当然会满意
Of course it'II be
to his satisfaction.

688
01:13:53,327 --> 01:14:00,457
来吧...我们来听音乐
过来...来
Come, we're going to Iisten
to some music. Come!
Good boy.

689
01:14:06,374 --> 01:14:07,500
好了
Now.

690
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:11,508
现在弹你最擅长的
PIease pIay me something,
just to give me an idea.

691
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:14,942
随便你弹
Anything wiII do.

692
01:14:16,784 --> 01:14:20,921
弹吧，简单地弹一弹
Just go ahead.
Just as if we weren't here.

693
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:26,854
就当我们是音乐厅的观众
是不是这样
Part of music, getting used
to an audience. Right, Herr Mozart?

694
01:14:27,595 --> 01:14:33,659
或许让我们独自在此弹奏就好
我们都很害羞
Perhaps it wouId be better
if we were Ieft aIone.
We're both a IittIe shy.

695
01:14:33,768 --> 01:14:38,535
弹吧，叫你弹
麦可，不要这样
PIay.
-I said pIay!
-MichaeI, pIease.

696
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:42,200
或许我应该先来示范一曲
Perhaps if I pIay first,
it might encourage the Fraulein.

697
01:14:43,044 --> 01:14:45,376
Why don't you Iet me try?

698
01:14:55,456 --> 01:14:56,753
不要叫
Stop it! Stop!

699
01:14:56,858 --> 01:14:59,691
每次听到音乐就叫
He aIways howIs when he hears music.

700
01:14:59,794 --> 01:15:05,858
受不了你，真是的
不要叫了，宝贝
We've got to break him of that habit.
We've got to break them
of their habit!

701
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:11,900
请弹吧...莫札特，请弹
PIay. PIease.
Herr Mozart, pIay.
PIease, I beg you.

702
01:15:19,614 --> 01:15:21,013
就这样
That's it.

703
01:15:22,884 --> 01:15:24,613
乖

704
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,380
继续弹
Keep pIaying!

705
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,086
继续弹，就这样
Keep pIaying!
That's it!

706
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:39,765
好棒

707
01:15:53,147 --> 01:15:55,945
好乖...

708
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,348
莫札特，太好了
Mozart, that's wonderfuI!
WonderfuI!

709
01:15:59,186 --> 01:16:03,816
如果还需要用音乐指导你的狗
请再通知我
Next time you wish me to instruct
another of your dogs, Iet me know.

710
01:16:03,925 --> 01:16:06,416
再见，再见了各位
Goodbye, Fraulein. Goodbye, madam.
Goodbye, sir.

711
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:06,446
爸爸
Papa?

712
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:11,758
爸爸
Papa!

713
01:17:16,197 --> 01:17:17,926
你到这里做什么？
Why are you here?

714
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:20,128
我不能来吗？
Am I not weIcome?

715
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:25,001
当然可以来，爸爸，欢迎...
Of course, weIcome.
Papa, weIcome! WeIcome!

716
01:17:46,627 --> 01:17:47,753
你好瘦
You're thin.

717
01:17:48,462 --> 01:17:50,396
你的太太难道不喂你吗
Doesn't your wife feed you?

718
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:55,627
她当然会喂好
一整天好像填鸭子一样
Feed! Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me Iike a goose, aII day!

719
01:17:56,203 --> 01:17:57,670
她不在家吗
-Is she not here?
-No, she had to heIp her mother.

720
01:17:57,772 --> 01:18:01,640
她要去帮母亲的忙
她就是这样的人
She's Iike that.

721
01:18:01,742 --> 01:18:03,869
她母亲是个很好的人
Her mother's a very sweet woman.

722
01:18:12,853 --> 01:18:15,253
我不知道你在家
I didn't know you were home.

723
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:18,851
史坦丝，这是我的父亲
Stanzi, this is my father.

724
01:18:21,395 --> 01:18:24,421
我们等一下...
We'II wait. We'II wait.

725
01:18:26,967 --> 01:18:29,868
你现在起床好吗，达令
Why don't you get up now, my darIing?

726
01:18:36,343 --> 01:18:38,709
她实在是累死了
可怜的女人
She's very tired, poor creature.

727
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:40,847
你也知道我懒的要死
我很邋遢
You know me.
I'm such a pig.

728
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:43,143
帮我打扫可不是一件容易的事
It's not easy cIeaning up after me.

729
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:46,209
你们难道没有女佣吗
Don't you have a maid?

730
01:18:46,821 --> 01:18:49,813
没有，我们想要的话也可以有
Oh. No.

731
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:54,327
但是史坦丝不愿意
她坚持一切都要自己做
We couId if we wanted...
...but Stanzi insists on doing
everything herseIf.

732
01:18:55,796 --> 01:19:02,964
你们的经济方面怎么样
不可能更好了
How is your...
...financiaI situation?
CouIdn't be better.

733
01:19:04,572 --> 01:19:07,804
这和我昨天说的不一样
这是什么意思
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean?

734
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:09,606
一切都很好
It's wonderfuI.

735
01:19:09,977 --> 01:19:13,208
真的，这里的人非常喜欢我
ReaIIy, it's marveIous!
PeopIe Iove me here.

736
01:19:15,116 --> 01:19:16,845
他们说你欠了很多钱
They say you have debts.

737
01:19:18,052 --> 01:19:19,314
是谁？
Who?

738
01:19:20,187 --> 01:19:21,347
谁说的
Who says that?

739
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:24,189
这是恶意的谎言
That's a maIicious Iie!

740
01:19:24,825 --> 01:19:26,224
你有学生吗
Do you have pupiIs?

741
01:19:27,728 --> 01:19:32,693
我不要学生，他们会防碍我
I don't want pupiIs!
They get in the way.

742
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:36,426
我必须空出时间来作曲
I have to have time for composition.

743
01:19:37,972 --> 01:19:40,634
作曲是赚不到钱的
你也知道的
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.

744
01:19:40,741 --> 01:19:42,106
这首可以赚的到
That one wiII.

745
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:44,370
那是什么
What's that?

746
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,777
秘密
It's a secret.

747
01:19:48,883 --> 01:19:51,750
什么秘密，你不需要对我保密
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.

748
01:19:51,852 --> 01:19:55,151
不...
No, no, no!

749
01:19:54,155 --> 01:19:58,783
拜托你，我不要你看
我不要任何人看
PIease! I don't want anyone to see it.

750
01:19:58,893 --> 01:20:00,952
但是你一定
会为我骄傲的，爸爸
You'II be so proud of me.

751
01:20:01,061 --> 01:20:04,656
这即将是我最棒的杰作
这是有史以来最...
It's going to be the
best thing that I've ever done.

752
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:12,496
她来了，看看她
她是不是最美的人
There she is!
Look at her!
Isn't she beautifuI?

753
01:20:12,606 --> 01:20:15,439
爸爸，承认吧
她是不是最美丽的媳妇
Confess it.
-CouId you want a prettier daughter?

754
01:20:15,543 --> 01:20:17,135
别闹了...
-Stop it, WoIfie!

755
01:20:19,213 --> 01:20:20,840
我看起来糟糕极了
I Iook dreadfuI.

756
01:20:22,349 --> 01:20:27,651
你是不是怀孕了
是的
Are you expecting?

757
01:20:26,387 --> 01:20:30,155
是不是棒极了
我们非常的高兴
-Yes, I am.
-Isn't it marveIous? We're deIighted.

758
01:20:31,492 --> 01:20:33,221
莫札特先生
可不可以帮你倒杯茶
-May I offer you some tea?

759
01:20:33,327 --> 01:20:36,125
茶，谁要喝茶，我们出去吧
-Who wants tea? Let's go out!

760
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:39,427
我们应该吃大餐
你不会想喝茶吧，爸爸
This caIIs for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you?

761
01:20:39,533 --> 01:20:43,128
我知道，我们去跳舞
爸爸热爱宴会
I know! Let's go dancing.
Papa Ioves parties, don't you?

762
01:20:43,237 --> 01:20:47,672
伍尔夫
什么，真是无聊，喝茶
How can you be so boring? Tea!

763
01:20:51,912 --> 01:20:53,379
Come on, Papa. Hurry!

764
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:55,811
Here we go. Good day.

765
01:21:38,592 --> 01:21:39,786
现在...
Now!

766
01:21:46,233 --> 01:21:50,260
我来决定怎么处罚...
I name the penaIty!

767
01:21:51,038 --> 01:21:55,970
我们的处罚方法是
想一个好一点的
And the penaIty is....

768
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:57,670
把腿露出来
-Give her a good one!
-Show us your Iegs!

769
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,349
快一点...
Come on, come on!

770
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:19,928
这只是个游戏，爸爸
It's just a game, Papa.

771
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:34,305
谢谢

772
01:22:47,594 --> 01:22:49,027
现在...

773
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:54,993
不...

774
01:22:59,306 --> 01:23:02,901
莫札特先生
你来决定儿子的处罚
Herr Mozart, why don't you
name your son's penaIty?!

775
01:23:05,779 --> 01:23:08,771
爸爸，你来决定吧
Yes, Papa. Name it.

776
01:23:09,483 --> 01:23:12,646
你要什么我都照办
随便什么都可以
I'II do anything you say. Anything.

777
01:23:15,022 --> 01:23:17,820
我要你和我回去沙兹堡，儿子
I want you to come back
to SaIzburg with me.

778
01:23:17,925 --> 01:23:23,124
爸爸，规则是
处罚必须在这里能够执行
The penaIty must be
performed in the room.

779
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:24,629
我觉得这个游戏很无聊
我不想玩下去了
I'm tired of this game.

780
01:23:25,132 --> 01:23:29,296
我的处罚是什么...
必须要处罚我...
But my penaIty!
I've got to have a penaIty!

781
01:23:31,505 --> 01:23:37,171
我来决定处罚...
I name a penaIty!

782
01:23:39,813 --> 01:23:48,148
你的处罚是用巴哈的风格
来演奏我们的小调
The penaIty is...
...you shaII pIay our tune...
...in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach!

783
01:24:15,682 --> 01:24:18,014
现在把他翻过来...
Turn him over!

784
01:24:20,354 --> 01:24:22,151
让他翻过来弹琴
Now you pIay it backwards!

785
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:53,219
再来一曲...
Another one! Give me another one!

786
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,120
和格拉克一样的演奏
无聊
PIay Iike GIuck!
Boring. Another!

787
01:24:56,323 --> 01:25:00,621
演奏韩德尔
我不喜欢他，换一个
HandeI!
I don't Iike him! Another one!

788
01:25:01,095 --> 01:25:02,585
演奏萨列里的
PIay SaIieri.

789
01:25:03,964 --> 01:25:07,832
这可是一个挑战
Now that is a chaIIenge!
That is a chaIIenge.

790
01:25:08,102 --> 01:25:09,933
请让让...
PIease! PIease!

791
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:48,936
继续吧，取笑我吧，笑吧
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!

792
01:25:53,213 --> 01:25:57,582
笑我的不是莫札特
是上帝，神父
That was not Mozart Iaughing, Father.
That was God.

793
01:25:58,085 --> 01:26:02,021
那是上帝
透过那荒唐的笑声取笑我
That was God Iaughing at me
through that obscene giggIe.

794
01:26:05,959 --> 01:26:08,223
继续笑吧，先生
Go on, signore.
Laugh.

795
01:26:08,662 --> 01:26:12,598
笑我，把我的平庸
展现给大家看
Show my mediocrity for aII to see.

796
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:16,500
有一天我会笑你的
One day I wiII Iaugh at you.

797
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:26,042
在我离开人世之前
我会笑你的
Before I Ieave this earth...
...I wiII Iaugh at you.

798
01:26:47,901 --> 01:26:49,266
伍尔夫
-WoIfie?

799
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:51,435
什么事
-What?

800
01:26:51,805 --> 01:26:54,171
有一个小女孩要找你
There's a young girI here to see you.

801
01:26:54,741 --> 01:26:56,402
她有什么事
What does she want?

802
01:26:56,543 --> 01:27:00,570
她不愿意对我说
她说，她有话要对你说
She won't taIk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.

803
01:27:02,549 --> 01:27:03,709
该死
Damn.

804
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:10,187
什么事
Yes?

805
01:27:12,092 --> 01:27:15,528
你是莫札特先生吗
是的
-Are you Herr Mozart?
-That's right.

806
01:27:16,797 --> 01:27:20,790
我的名字是萝拉
我是一个女佣
My name is LorI, sir.
I'm a maidservant.

807
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:24,860
我被指派来这里为您服务
I was asked to come here
and offer my services to you.

808
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:31,978
你的崇拜者愿意出钱
但是他希望能够匿名
They'II be paid for by an admirer
of yours who wishes to remain...
...anonymous.

809
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,743
这是你的主意吗，爸爸
Is this your idea, Papa?

810
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:38,283
我的主意？
Mine?

811
01:27:38,385 --> 01:27:40,717
你是不是在和我开玩笑
-Are you pIaying a trick on me?

812
01:27:41,288 --> 01:27:43,279
我这一辈子没见过这个女孩
-I've never seen this girI.

813
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:46,718
这是某种玩笑吗
不是的，先生
-Is this a joke?
-Not at aII, sir.

814
01:27:47,394 --> 01:27:49,589
小女孩，这是不可能的
Young woman, this won't do.

815
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:54,833
我的儿子不可能接受这种做法
不管这有多么的慷慨
My son can't accept such an offer,
no matter how generous...

816
01:27:54,935 --> 01:27:59,133
除非他知道幕后的人是谁
可是我真的不能告诉你
-...unIess he knows who's behind it.
-I can't teII you that, sir.

817
01:27:59,239 --> 01:28:02,140
这真的是太荒谬了
什么荒谬
-This is ridicuIous!
-What is ridicuIous?

818
01:28:02,509 --> 01:28:05,376
伍尔夫在维也纳
有许多的崇拜者
WoIfie has many admirers in Vienna.

819
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:07,174
大家都很喜欢他

820
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:08,908
总是有人送我们礼物
PeopIe send us gifts aII the time.

821
01:28:09,016 --> 01:28:11,712
但是没有调查清楚
不能够把她留下来
You cannot accept her
without references.

822
01:28:11,818 --> 01:28:17,222
这不关你的事
派你来的人会付薪水吧
This is none of your business.-Whoever sent you is going to pay?

823
01:28:14,788 --> 01:28:23,028
没有错，夫人
太好了
-That's right.
SpIendid! 

824
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,227
现在我们要让一个陌生人
进入我们的家
Now we're going
to Iet a stranger into our house.

825
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:26,128
谁是我们...
Who is we?
Who is Ietting who--?

826
01:28:30,437 --> 01:28:33,201
请你在外面等一下
好的，夫人
-CouId you pIease wait outside?
-Yes, ma'am.

827
01:28:34,741 --> 01:28:37,710
老头子，我们在你身上
花了很多的钱
Look, oId man!

828
01:28:35,776 --> 01:28:40,837
你只会从早到晚抱怨
We spend a fortune on you,
and aII you do is criticize.

829
01:28:40,947 --> 01:28:42,073
现在你认为...
史坦丝
-And now--
-Stanzi!
No! He shouId hear!

830
01:28:42,182 --> 01:28:46,778
不，他应该要听到
我真的是感到很厌倦了
I'm sick to death of it.

831
01:28:46,887 --> 01:28:50,288
我们为你做什么
你都不会觉得满意
We can't do anything
right for you, can we?

832
01:28:50,624 --> 01:28:53,092
你们再也不必为我做事了
You won't have to do anything
for me ever again.

833
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:55,926
我走了
I'm Ieaving.

834
01:28:56,296 --> 01:28:57,490
不要，爸爸
-No, Papa.

835
01:28:57,597 --> 01:28:59,792
别担心
我不会待在这里拖累你们
-I won't stay and be a burden.

836
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,336
没有人认为你是负担
她认为是
No one caIIs you that.

837
01:29:01,835 --> 01:29:05,530
她说我只会一整天睡觉
She does.
She says I sIeep aII day.

838
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:10,570
你也差不多啊
你只会离开房间吃东西
And so you do!
The onIy time you come out is to eat.

839
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:13,840
你期待什么呢
WeII, what do you expect?

840
01:29:16,683 --> 01:29:20,346
你觉得人们应该每天走进
这么脏的屋子里吗
Do you expect anyone to waIk out
into a mess Iike this every day?

841
01:29:21,655 --> 01:29:25,751
现在要说我不会管家了
事实上如此
-Now I'm a bad housekeeper!
-So you are. It's a pigsty.

842
01:29:26,727 --> 01:29:28,558
你何时可以上班？
When can you start?

843
01:29:28,662 --> 01:29:30,220
现在
-Right away, ma'am.
-Good.

844
01:29:58,525 --> 01:30:00,152
每天晚上开派对
They're out every night, sir.

845
01:30:03,697 --> 01:30:04,925
谢谢你，先生
Thank you, sir.

846
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,665
家里有没有学生上门
Do any pupiIs come to the house?

847
01:30:11,471 --> 01:30:13,234
我没有见过
Not that I've seen.

848
01:30:13,707 --> 01:30:15,470
那他怎么会有钱花
Then how does he pay for aII this?

849
01:30:17,444 --> 01:30:19,344
他有工作吗
Does he work at aII?

850
01:30:20,013 --> 01:30:23,642
有，一整天的工作
Yes, sir. AII day Iong.

851
01:30:23,817 --> 01:30:25,876
他要等到晚上才会出门
He never Ieaves untiI evening.

852
01:30:26,186 --> 01:30:30,784
他坐在那里不停的写
真的吗
He just sits there,
writing and writing.
ReaIIy!

853
01:30:32,559 --> 01:30:34,151
他在写什么
What is he writing?

854
01:30:37,831 --> 01:30:41,997
这个我不知道，先生
当然不知道
I wouIdn't know that, sir.
Of course not.

855
01:30:42,469 --> 01:30:46,997
你是个好女孩
你为我这么做太好了
You're a good girI.
You're very kind to do this.

856
01:30:47,307 --> 01:30:50,538
下一次你确定他们不在家时
Next time you're sure
they'II be out...

857
01:30:50,644 --> 01:30:52,043
让我知道
...Iet me know.

858
01:30:58,919 --> 01:31:00,386
谢谢你，先生
Thank you, sir.

859
01:32:40,754 --> 01:32:43,120
我想我发现了钱的事情
I think I found out
about the money, sir.

860
01:32:44,991 --> 01:32:47,118
怎么说
Yes? What?

861
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:52,662
他这里有七个鼻烟盒
我发誓这全都是纯金的
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I couId swear they were aII goId.

862
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:57,431
你看，现在只剩下一个了
And now Iook.
There's onIy one Ieft.

863
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:00,433
他在哪里工作
Where does he work?

864
01:33:02,609 --> 01:33:04,474
在里面，先生
In there, sir.

865
01:33:47,053 --> 01:33:49,749
费加洛的婚礼

866
01:33:49,856 --> 01:33:53,348
各位，我听到了
各位会感兴趣的消息
I've just heard some news
that may be of interest to you.

867
01:33:55,595 --> 01:33:56,857
什么新闻
What?

868
01:33:57,230 --> 01:34:01,098
莫札特在写一出新的歌剧
意大利文的歌剧
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An ItaIian opera.

869
01:34:02,235 --> 01:34:04,760
意大利文的...
ItaIian?

870
01:34:05,171 --> 01:34:10,336
而且不只如此
他选择费加洛做为主角
That's not aII.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.

871
01:34:10,443 --> 01:34:12,172
费加洛的婚礼
The Marriage of Figaro.

872
01:34:13,113 --> 01:34:18,346
他要为那出舞台剧编曲
是的
He's setting that pIay to music?
Yes.

873
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:23,146
什么是费加洛的婚礼
What is this Marriage of Figaro?

874
01:34:23,256 --> 01:34:30,128
那是一出法国的戏剧
是帝王禁止上演的
It's a French pIay, Kapellmeister.
It has been banned by the emperor.

875
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:32,289
你真的确定吗
You're absoIuteIy sure?

876
01:34:35,969 --> 01:34:37,459
莫札特先生

877
01:34:39,139 --> 01:34:40,538
各位请坐
GentIemen, sit down.

878
01:34:46,179 --> 01:34:47,612
莫札特
Mozart.

879
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:56,015
你知不知道我宣布
法国戏剧费加洛的婚礼不得体
Are you aware that I have
decIared Figaro...
...unsuitabIe for our theater?

880
01:34:57,457 --> 01:34:59,186
知道，陛下
Yes, sire.

881
01:34:59,592 --> 01:35:04,256
我们听说你在写这出歌剧
这是不是事实
Yet we hear you're making an
opera from it. Is this true?

882
01:35:08,268 --> 01:35:10,395
这是谁告诉你的，陛下
Who toId you this, Majesty?

883
01:35:10,503 --> 01:35:15,202
现在你没有资格问问题
这是不是事实
It is not your pIace to ask questions.
Is it true?

884
01:35:15,675 --> 01:35:17,802
是的...
Yes....

885
01:35:18,078 --> 01:35:19,636
我承认
I admit it is.

886
01:35:22,482 --> 01:35:24,382
你可不可以告诉我为什么
WouId you teII me why?

887
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,648
陛下，这只是一出喜剧
Majesty, it is onIy a comedy.

888
01:35:29,756 --> 01:35:36,184
你的看法不是重点，莫札特
陛下的想法才重要
What you think
is scarceIy the point.
It's what His Majesty thinks
that counts.

889
01:35:36,696 --> 01:35:38,687
可是，陛下
But, Your Majesty--

890
01:35:39,065 --> 01:35:45,732
莫札特，我是一个有耐心的人
我不会随便下禁令的
Mozart...
...I am a toIerant man.

891
01:35:43,169 --> 01:35:48,535
我做这种决定是有理由的
I do not censor things IightIy.
When I do, I have good reason.

892
01:35:49,075 --> 01:35:55,844
费加洛的婚礼是不好的戏剧
挑拨阶级之间的冲突
Figaro is a bad pIay.
It stirs up hatred between cIasses.

893
01:35:55,949 --> 01:35:58,008
在法国只有造成憎恨
In France, it has caused
onIy bitterness.

894
01:35:58,118 --> 01:36:04,489
我的亲妹妹安东妮告诉我
她现在很害怕自己的子民
My sister Antoinette is beginning
to be frightened of her own peopIe.

895
01:36:04,591 --> 01:36:08,357
陛下，我对你发誓
歌剧里没有这种成份
I swear, there's nothing Iike
that in the piece.

896
01:36:08,461 --> 01:36:13,489
我把这些都删掉了
我憎恨政治
I've taken out everything that couId
give offense. I hate poIitics.

897
01:36:13,666 --> 01:36:16,032
你可能有一点点幼稚
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.

898
01:36:16,336 --> 01:36:18,236
在这种动荡的时期
In these dangerous times I cannot
afford to provoke our peopIe...

899
01:36:18,338 --> 01:36:24,277
我不可能为了一出歌剧
影响到贵族以及子民
...simpIy over a theater piece.

900
01:36:24,377 --> 01:36:29,314
陛下，这只是一出喜剧
主题是有关爱情的
Majesty, this is just a froIic.
A piece about Iove.

901
01:36:29,415 --> 01:36:31,280
又是爱情
''Love.'' Again!

902
01:36:32,051 --> 01:36:37,414
这是新的，全新的
And it's new!
It's entireIy new.
The peopIe wiII go mad for it.

903
01:36:34,554 --> 01:36:40,459
这种事是会使人们疯狂的
我有一场戏
I have scenes....

904
01:36:40,794 --> 01:36:45,493
比如说第二幕的最后
一开始是男女对唱
The end of act two, for exampIe.

905
01:36:43,396 --> 01:36:47,623
只是一对夫妻在吵架
It starts as a duet.
A husband and wife quarreIing.

906
01:36:47,734 --> 01:36:53,172
突然，有阴谋的女佣走进来
这是很有趣的情景
SuddenIy, the scheming maid comes in.
It's a very funny situation.

907
01:36:53,273 --> 01:36:55,264
二重唱变成了三重唱
Duet turns into trio.

908
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:58,469
然后丈夫的侍者走进来
他与女佣有阴谋
Then the husband's vaIet comes in.

909
01:36:58,578 --> 01:37:00,478
三重唱变成四重唱
Trio turns into quartet.

910
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:03,515
愚蠢的老园丁走进来
四重唱变成五重唱
Then a gardener.
Quartet becomes quintet.

911
01:37:03,616 --> 01:37:05,550
然后不断的延伸下去...
And so on, on and on.

912
01:37:05,652 --> 01:37:08,018
六重唱，七重唱，八重唱
Sextet, septet, octet.

913
01:37:08,488 --> 01:37:12,049
你认为我可以维持多久，陛下
How Iong do you think
I can sustain that?

914
01:37:13,059 --> 01:37:18,292
我不知道
你猜猜看...
I have no idea.
Guess.
Guess, Your Majesty.

915
01:37:18,765 --> 01:37:23,297
想想看这种过程可以维持多久
然后再加一倍
Imagine the Iongest
it couId be sustained...
...then doubIe it.

916
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:25,760
WeII....

917
01:37:27,307 --> 01:37:32,074
6...7分钟
Six...
...seven minutes?

918
01:37:35,014 --> 01:37:38,450
8分钟
陛下，20分钟
-Eight minutes?
-Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes!

919
01:37:39,485 --> 01:37:43,387
20分钟不断的音乐
完全没有对白
Twenty minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!

920
01:37:44,557 --> 01:37:47,048
陛下，这是只有歌剧办的到的
Sire, onIy opera can do this.

921
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:49,754
在戏剧中如果不只一个人说话
In a pIay, if more than one person
speaks at once...

922
01:37:49,863 --> 01:37:53,196
那就只能听的到噪音
没有人可以了解一句对话
...it's just noise.

923
01:37:53,299 --> 01:37:55,460
可是透过歌剧，或是音乐
But with opera, with music...

924
01:37:56,035 --> 01:37:59,869
音乐可以让20个人
同时的说话
...you can have 20 individuaIs
aII taIking at the same time.

925
01:37:59,973 --> 01:38:03,136
这不只不是噪音
而且是完美的旋律
It's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony!

926
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:08,674
莫札特，重点不是音乐
没有人质疑你的才华
Mozart, music is not the issue here.

927
01:38:06,913 --> 01:38:12,146
现在的重点是
你对于文学的判断
No one doubts your taIent. It's your
Iiterary judgment that's in question.

928
01:38:12,685 --> 01:38:18,317
就算没有政治的成份
这还是很低俗的题材
Even with the poIitics taken out of it,
it wouId stiII remain a vuIgar farce.

929
01:38:18,758 --> 01:38:25,591
为什么要把精神放在这里
你可以选择更崇高的主题
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
SureIy you can choose more
eIevated themes.

930
01:38:25,565 --> 01:38:29,592
崇高，什么是崇高的主题
EIevated!
What does that mean, eIevated?

931
01:38:29,702 --> 01:38:34,833
我非常的厌倦这些崇高的主题
I am fed to the teeth
with these...

932
01:38:33,273 --> 01:38:37,239
古老，没有生命力的传说
...eIevated things.
OId dead Iegends.

933
01:38:37,343 --> 01:38:41,211
我们为什么要不断的
只去写有关神的传说
Why must we go on forever
writing of gods and Iegends?

934
01:38:41,314 --> 01:38:51,315
因为这是永恒的
至少她们代表我们心中的永恒
Because they do.
They go on forever.
At Ieast what they represent;
the eternaI in us.

935
01:38:51,424 --> 01:38:54,222
歌剧是为了
使我们更高尚的，莫札特
Opera is here to ennobIe us, Mozart.

936
01:38:54,327 --> 01:38:57,785
你和我，还有陛下
都是一对的
You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.

937
01:38:57,897 --> 01:39:01,264
说的真美，公爵...
这就是真理

938
01:39:01,367 --> 01:39:06,430
美...别这样，我们诚实一点
''Bello, bello, bello. ''
Come on now, be honest!

939
01:39:06,539 --> 01:39:10,066
你们谁比较喜欢听海克力斯
而不是美发师的话
You'd rather Iisten to your
hairdressers than HercuIes.

940
01:39:10,576 --> 01:39:12,510
赫拉提斯，奥菲斯也一样
Or Horatius, or Orpheus.

941
01:39:12,612 --> 01:39:15,638
这些崇高的人
连大便都是大理石
So Iofty, they sound
as if they shit marbIe!

942
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:18,649
什么
What!

943
01:39:19,585 --> 01:39:22,577
注意你的用语，莫札特
你太放肆了
Govern your tongue, Mozart!
How dare you!

944
01:39:27,994 --> 01:39:29,859
原谅我，陛下
Forgive me, Majesty.

945
01:39:31,965 --> 01:39:37,961
我是个低俗的人
可是我保证音乐不低俗
I'm a vuIgar man...
...but I assure you,
my music is not.

946
01:39:41,441 --> 01:39:44,239
你是很有热情的人，莫札特
You are passionate, Mozart...

947
01:39:45,011 --> 01:39:50,074
可是你说服不了我们
...but you do not persuade.

948
01:39:51,184 --> 01:39:58,420
陛下，这出已经写了
你知道我有多努力吗
Sire, the whoIe opera is finished.
Do you know how much work
went into it?

949
01:39:58,524 --> 01:40:04,952
陛下已经太有耐心了
His Majesty has been
more than patient, signore.

950
01:40:05,865 --> 01:40:08,527
陛下，如果不演奏给你听
我怎么能说服你
-How can I persuade Your Majesty?

951
01:40:08,634 --> 01:40:11,467
够了，莫札特先生
-That wiII do, Herr Mozart.

952
01:40:14,007 --> 01:40:16,669
让我告诉你是怎么开始的
Just Iet me teII how it begins.

953
01:40:16,976 --> 01:40:21,078
我可不可以这么做，陛下
只是提一下开头
May I just do that?
Show how it begins?
Just that?

954
01:40:26,986 --> 01:40:27,509
请便
PIease.

955
01:40:28,354 --> 01:40:30,254
Look....

956
01:40:31,057 --> 01:40:34,493
有一个仆人跪在地上
您知道为什么吗
There's a servant on his knees.
Do you know why?

957
01:40:34,594 --> 01:40:38,257
不是因为任何的压迫
是因为他在测量
Not from oppression.
He's measuring a space.

958
01:40:38,364 --> 01:40:43,267
你知道测量什么吗
他结婚用的床
Do you know what for?
His bed. His wedding bed.

959
01:40:43,369 --> 01:40:45,098
看看床是否放的下
To see if it wiII fit!

960
01:40:54,614 --> 01:40:55,979
晚一点...
Late.

961
01:40:58,117 --> 01:40:59,106
晚一点
Late!

962
01:40:59,919 --> 01:41:01,079
节奏...
On the beat.

963
01:41:01,821 --> 01:41:02,788
很好
Good!

964
01:41:05,391 --> 01:41:06,380
好
Yes!

965
01:41:08,961 --> 01:41:09,859
好
Yes!

966
01:41:13,533 --> 01:41:14,795
太早了
EarIy!

967
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:22,875
莫札特已经开始采排了吗
WeII, Mozart is aIready rehearsing.

968
01:41:28,247 --> 01:41:31,341
既然如此，各位，我想...
In that case, gentIemen, I think....

969
01:41:35,621 --> 01:41:38,215
我们应该尽量帮忙莫札特
I think we shouId
heIp Mozart aII we can.

970
01:41:42,328 --> 01:41:45,525
让他不会遭到陛下的处份
And protect him against
the emperor's anger.

971
01:41:45,631 --> 01:41:49,393
什么处份
芭蕾舞的事
What anger?
About the baIIet.

972
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:52,461
什么芭蕾舞
What baIIet?

973
01:41:53,372 --> 01:42:01,646
对不起，陛下是不是禁止
歌剧院里上演芭蕾舞
Excuse me, but...
...didn't His Majesty specificaIIy...
...forbid the baIIet at his opera?

974
01:42:36,048 --> 01:42:40,083
莫札特先生...
-Herr Mozart!
-Yes?

975
01:42:39,585 --> 01:42:42,213
什么事
可不可以借一步说话
A word with you.

976
01:42:42,321 --> 01:42:45,557
当然可以，院长先生
现在...
CertainIy, Herr Direktor.
Now, Herr Mozart!

977
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:50,160
莫札特先生
休息五分钟
休息五分钟
Five minutes, pIease.

978
01:42:51,931 --> 01:42:53,125
什么事
Yes?

979
01:42:53,266 --> 01:42:58,636
你难道不知道陛下
禁止歌剧院上演芭蕾舞吗
Do you not know that His Majesty has
expressIy forbidden baIIet in operas?

980
01:42:59,038 --> 01:43:01,632
这不是芭蕾
这是费加洛的婚礼舞蹈
It's not a baIIet, it's a dance.

981
01:43:01,741 --> 01:43:04,505
没有错，舞蹈
ExactIy. A dance.

982
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:09,104
陛下一定不会禁止
与剧情有关的舞蹈
SureIy, His Majesty didn't mean
no dancing when it's in the story.

983
01:43:09,215 --> 01:43:12,343
随意去诠释陛下的命令
是很危险的
It's dangerous to interpret his
edicts. 

984
01:43:12,451 --> 01:43:14,248
请把乐谱给我
Give me your score, pIease.

985
01:43:23,763 --> 01:43:25,094
谢谢你
Thank you.

986
01:43:28,534 --> 01:43:30,263
院长先生，你在做什么
What are you doing, Herr Direktor?

987
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:34,604
你在做什么
删掉你不该加进去的
Taking out what you shouId
never have put in.

988
01:43:36,509 --> 01:43:41,404
求求你
我没有任何人可以去找
PIease. PIease!
I have no one eIse to turn to.

989
01:43:41,314 --> 01:43:43,248
伍尔夫，什么事
-What is it?
-It's unbeIievabIe.

990
01:43:43,349 --> 01:43:49,049
这真的不可思议
院长删掉我大部份的歌剧
The direktor has actuaIIy torn up
a huge section of my music.

991
01:43:49,255 --> 01:43:55,421
他们说我必须重写歌剧
可是现在很完美了
They say I have to rewrite the opera.
But it's perfect as it is.

992
01:43:55,995 --> 01:44:00,091
我无法重写完美的作品
I can't...
...rewrite what's perfect.

993
01:44:01,867 --> 01:44:07,464
你不能去找他谈谈吗
求求你...
PIease.
Can't you taIk to him?
PIease.

994
01:44:07,907 --> 01:44:10,774
为什么要去管罗森保
他很明显的不是你的朋友
Why bother? He's no friend of yours.

995
01:44:10,876 --> 01:44:14,539
我真的想杀了他...
I couId kiII him!
I mean, reaIIy! KiII him!

996
01:44:16,549 --> 01:44:20,280
他使我好愤怒
把所有的乐谱丢进火炉
I threw the score into
the fire, he made me so angry.

997
01:44:20,586 --> 01:44:25,853
你把乐谱烧掉了吗
我太太即时救了回来
You burned it?
No, my wife took it out in time.

998
01:44:27,893 --> 01:44:29,190
谢天谢地
Thank God.

999
01:44:30,963 --> 01:44:34,763
这种人能控制我们的作品
真是不公平
It's unfair that a man Iike that
shouId have power over our work!

1000
01:44:37,303 --> 01:44:40,238
可是有些人能够控制他
But there are those who
have power over him.

1001
01:44:42,475 --> 01:44:44,875
这件事我去和陛下谈
I think I'II take this up
with the emperor.

1002
01:44:47,613 --> 01:44:51,105
太好了，真的吗
ExceIIency...
...wouId you?

1003
01:44:52,184 --> 01:44:54,516
我全心全意的去做，莫札特
With aII my heart, Mozart.

1004
01:44:56,122 --> 01:44:57,714
谢谢
Thank you.

1005
01:44:58,291 --> 01:45:03,194
请你不要这样，莫札特先生
这不是圣物
PIease, Herr Mozart.
''PIease, it's not a hoIy reIic.''

1006
01:45:05,831 --> 01:45:09,995
我不需要告诉你
我根本没有对陛下提
I don't need to teII you I said
nothing, whatever, to the emperor.

1007
01:45:10,803 --> 01:45:14,830
我去歌剧院准备要告诉莫札特
I went to the theater to teII
Mozart something, anything...

1008
01:45:17,176 --> 01:45:22,136
可是突然听到第三幕时
... when suddenly...
...in the middle of the third act...

1009
01:45:22,281 --> 01:45:27,583
我非常惊讶
从来不来采排的陛下
...to my astonishment, the emperor...

1010
01:45:25,184 --> 01:45:29,678
他突然出现了
... who never attended
rehearsals, suddenly appeared.

1011
01:45:48,908 --> 01:45:50,398
这是什么
What is this?

1012
01:45:53,379 --> 01:45:54,778
我不明白
I don't understand.

1013
01:45:56,382 --> 01:45:58,282
这是现代舞吗
Is it modern?

1014
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:03,483
陛下，院长先生...
Majesty...
...the Herr Direktor...

1015
01:46:02,388 --> 01:46:11,325
他删掉了这时候
应该有的芭蕾舞曲
...he has removed un balletto...
...that wouId have occurred
at this pIace.

1016
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:12,954
为什么
Why?

1017
01:46:13,099 --> 01:46:18,969
这是您的禁令
歌剧院里不准上演芭蕾舞
It's your reguIation, sire.
No baIIet in your opera.

1018
01:46:24,176 --> 01:46:25,939
萨列里
SaIieri.

1019
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:29,639
你喜欢这样吗
Do you Iike this?

1020
01:46:31,484 --> 01:46:35,352
这与喜不喜欢无关，陛下
It's not a question
of Iiking, Majesty.

1021
01:46:35,454 --> 01:46:38,651
这是您所下的禁令
Your own Iaw decrees it, I'm afraid.

1022
01:46:40,292 --> 01:46:42,852
看看他们
WeII, Iook at them!

1023
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:51,464
不...这太荒谬了
配上音乐再让我看看
No! This is nonsense!
-Let me see the scene with the music.
-But, sire!

1024
01:46:50,269 --> 01:46:54,069
可是，陛下...
遵守我的命令
ObIige me!

1025
01:46:54,206 --> 01:46:55,571
是的，陛下
Yes, Majesty.

1026
01:46:58,911 --> 01:47:00,105
对不起，陛下

1027
01:47:05,217 --> 01:47:08,516
可不可以配上音乐
再给我们看一次
Can we see the scene
with the music, pIease?

1028
01:47:08,621 --> 01:47:11,556
当然，院长先生
CertainIy!
CertainIy, Herr Direktor!

1029
01:47:17,863 --> 01:47:20,058
彼德，把皇宫的背景换回来
Bring the paIace set back in, pIease.

1030
01:47:58,404 --> 01:48:03,432
结果的第三幕大胆，精彩
The restored third act...
...was boId, briIIiant.

1031
01:48:03,542 --> 01:48:09,708
第四幕...简直不可思议
The fourth...
...was astounding.

1032
01:48:18,257 --> 01:48:22,557
我看到伪装成女佣的女子
I saw a woman...
...disguised in her maid's clothes...

1033
01:48:23,329 --> 01:48:28,961
多年来首次听到
丈夫说出他的爱意
...hear her husband speak the first...
...tender words he's
offered her in years.

1034
01:48:29,268 --> 01:48:33,762
那只是因为他以为她是别人
Simply because he thinks
she is someone else.

1035
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:39,837
我听到了真正充满宽恕的音乐
在整个剧院里响起
I heard the music of true
forgiveness filling the theater...

1036
01:48:40,412 --> 01:48:45,509
让人们都能理解救赎
...conferring on all who
sat there, perfect absolution.

1037
01:48:45,751 --> 01:48:51,621
上帝透过这个小子对我歌唱
被全世界歌颂
God was singing through
this little man...
...to all the world.

1038
01:48:51,724 --> 01:48:54,215
简直是无法阻挡
Unstoppable.

1039
01:48:54,393 --> 01:49:00,662
每一个音符
都使我的挫折更深刻
Making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar.

1040
01:49:37,836 --> 01:49:41,203
然后你知道怎么了吗
And then,
do you know what happened?

1041
01:49:44,009 --> 01:49:45,874
奇迹
A miracIe!

1042
01:49:52,785 --> 01:49:58,189
那个哈欠使我看到
我的失败变成了胜利
With that yawn...
...I saw my defeat
turn into a victory.

1043
01:50:02,461 --> 01:50:05,953
莫札特运气很好
陛下只有打一次哈欠
Mozart was lucky
the emperor yawned only once.

1044
01:50:06,065 --> 01:50:10,695
打三次哈欠
这天晚上歌剧就完了
Three yawns...
...and the opera wouId
faiI the same night.

1045
01:50:10,803 --> 01:50:14,705
打两次哈欠
大概有一周的期限
Two yawns within a week at most.

1046
01:50:14,807 --> 01:50:19,574
一次哈欠...
作曲家还是可以得到
With one yawn, the composer
couId stiII get....

1047
01:50:21,213 --> 01:50:24,182
九次演出的机会...
Nine performances!
That's aII it's had! Withdrawn!

1048
01:50:24,283 --> 01:50:28,251
现在就被取消了
我知道...
I know, I know.

1049
01:50:28,988 --> 01:50:31,081
这真的是太令人气愤了
It's outrageous.

1050
01:50:32,224 --> 01:50:39,130
如果大众不喜欢作品
还是必须优雅的接受
StiII, if the pubIic
doesn't Iike one's work...
...one has to accept
the fact gracefuIIy.

1051
01:50:39,231 --> 01:50:41,062
他们不喜欢哪一点
But what is it they don't Iike?

1052
01:50:42,801 --> 01:50:45,167
我可以替陛下说话
I can speak for the emperor.

1053
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:48,535
你使陛下的耳朵承受太多了
You make too many demands
on the royaI ear.

1054
01:50:48,674 --> 01:50:53,111
他无法集中精神超过一小时
你却让他听了四小时
He can't concentrate for more than
an hour. You gave him four.

1055
01:50:59,218 --> 01:51:01,015
你有什么看法
What did you think of it yourseIf?

1056
01:51:02,321 --> 01:51:03,720
你喜欢吗
Did you Iike it at aII?

1057
01:51:06,392 --> 01:51:08,087
我认为棒极了
I thought it was marveIous.

1058
01:51:09,228 --> 01:51:13,221
当然，这是有史以来
最杰出的歌剧
Of course.
It's the best opera yet written.

1059
01:51:13,332 --> 01:51:14,856
我知道这一点
I know it!

1060
01:51:17,803 --> 01:51:19,668
他们为什么没有来
Why didn't they come?

1061
01:51:22,474 --> 01:51:25,739
你可能太高估
维也纳人了，朋友
I think you overestimate
our dear Viennese, my friend.

1062
01:51:26,011 --> 01:51:31,682
你在歌曲结尾时
都没有给他们鼓掌的暗示
You didn't give them
a bang at the end of songs...
...to Iet them know when to cIap.

1063
01:51:33,085 --> 01:51:38,152
我知道...这点你可以教我几招
I know.
You shouId give me Iessons in that.

1064
01:51:40,392 --> 01:51:42,053
我不敢这么做
I wouIdn't presume.

1065
01:51:45,931 --> 01:51:51,801
虽然我知道有点冒犯
我想请你看我的新作品
NevertheIess,
at the risk of imposing...
...I'd Iike you
to see my new piece.

1066
01:51:53,305 --> 01:51:55,535
这是我莫大的荣耀
It wouId be an honor for me.

1067
01:51:56,041 --> 01:51:59,010
不，这才是我的荣耀
No, the honor wouId be aII mine.

1068
01:52:01,847 --> 01:52:03,678
谢谢你，伍尔夫

1069
01:52:03,949 --> 01:52:07,749
谢谢你，安东尼先生

1070
01:53:24,329 --> 01:53:25,956
I beIieve....

1071
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:34,602
这真的是有史以来
最好的歌剧
I beIieve...
...it is the best opera
yet written, my friends.

1072
01:53:35,741 --> 01:53:37,231
萨列里
SaIieri!

1073
01:53:38,877 --> 01:53:42,813
你真的是
音乐界最闪亮的明星
You are the brightest star...
...in the musicaI firmament.

1074
01:53:42,915 --> 01:53:46,749
你为我以及维也纳增添了荣耀
You do honor to Vienna...
...and to me.

1075
01:53:58,897 --> 01:54:00,194
走吧

1076
01:54:13,412 --> 01:54:18,307
莫札特先生
你能来真是太好了
Herr Mozart!
-It was good of you to come.
-How couId I not?

1077
01:54:17,716 --> 01:54:19,445
我怎么可能不来
Bravo, maestro.

1078
01:54:19,918 --> 01:54:23,718
你喜欢我的作品吗
Did my work pIease you?

1079
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:30,026
我没有想到
有人能写出这种音乐
I never knew that music
Iike that was possibIe.

1080
01:54:31,396 --> 01:54:34,388
你太夸耀我了
不...
-You fIatter me.
-No.

1081
01:54:34,967 --> 01:54:39,961
听到这种音乐时，只能说...
One hears such sounds and...
...what can one say but;

1082
01:54:40,172 --> 01:54:41,799
萨列里
SaIieri!

1083
01:54:48,046 --> 01:54:51,911
大家都在这里
我们还有客人
Everybody's here and we've got guests.

1084
01:54:52,017 --> 01:54:54,281
太好了，我带来更多的客人
Bravo! I've got some more.

1085
01:54:54,386 --> 01:54:58,254
史坦丝，你记得我的好朋友
史克尼，进来...
You remember my good
friend Schikaneder. Come in.

1086
01:54:58,357 --> 01:54:59,551
不用害羞...
Come in! Don't be shy.

1087
01:54:59,658 --> 01:55:03,094
这是一位...好女孩...
-This is a very nice girI, and this--

1088
01:55:03,195 --> 01:55:06,687
伍尔夫
是的，亲爱的
-WoIfie?
Yes, my Iove?

1089
01:55:07,499 --> 01:55:11,629
这两位先生是沙兹堡来的
沙兹堡
These men are from SaIzburg.
SaIzburg?

1090
01:55:12,271 --> 01:55:15,502
我们刚刚才谈到沙兹堡
伍尔夫
We were just taIking about SaIzburg.

1091
01:55:17,342 --> 01:55:20,243
你的父亲去世了
Your father is dead.

1092
01:55:42,401 --> 01:55:49,273
可怕的鬼魂站了起来
那是他最黑暗的一出歌剧
So rose the dreadfuI ghost,
from his next...
...and bIackest opera.

1093
01:55:55,113 --> 01:55:58,947
舞台上有一位死去的军官
There on the stuge,
stood the figure of a dead commander.

1094
01:55:59,418 --> 01:56:03,411
我知道，只有我了解
And I knew...
...onIy I understood...

1095
01:56:03,522 --> 01:56:08,983
那可怕的鬼魂
就是死中复活的里奥波
...that the horrifying apparition
was LeopoId...
...raised from the dead!

1096
01:56:38,056 --> 01:56:41,389
莫札特唤醒了他的父亲
WoIfgang had actuaIIy
summoned up his own father...

1097
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:45,523
在世人的面前指责他的儿子
...to accuse his son
before aII the worId!

1098
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:52,636
这看起来又恐怖
又不可思议的美妙
It was...
...terrifying and wonderfuI to watch.

1099
01:57:56,902 --> 01:57:58,301
那时候
And now...

1100
01:58:03,975 --> 01:58:06,068
我开始疯狂
...the madness began in me.

1101
01:58:09,047 --> 01:58:12,244
一个精神分裂的人开始发狂
The madness of a man
spIitting in haIf.

1102
01:58:16,421 --> 01:58:17,979
我透过我的影响力
Through my infIuence, I saw to it...

1103
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:22,789
使得“唐乔文尼”
在维也纳只有演出五场
...Don Giovanni was pIayed
onIy five times in Vienna.

1104
01:58:22,894 --> 01:58:27,388
可是我每一场都偷偷的去听
But, in secret,
I went to every one of those five.

1105
01:58:28,166 --> 01:58:33,536
我去崇拜那些
只有我听得到的音乐
Worshiping sound
I alone seemed to hear.

1106
01:59:19,851 --> 01:59:23,218
我站在那里时
我了解他的父亲
And as I stood there,
understunding how that...

1107
01:59:23,321 --> 01:59:29,453
就算是死了以后
还是控制了自己的儿子
...bitter oId man stiII
possessed his poor son...
...even from beyond the grave...

1108
01:59:30,128 --> 01:59:38,799
我终于找到了战胜上帝的方法
...I began to see a way...
...a terrible way...
...I couId finaIIy triumph...
...over God.

1109
02:02:49,294 --> 02:02:50,693
莫札特先生
Herr Mozart?

1110
02:02:53,865 --> 02:02:56,163
我有工作要委托你做
I have come to commission
work from you.

1111
02:02:58,336 --> 02:02:59,667
什么工作
-What work?

1112
02:03:00,672 --> 02:03:02,503
为死者写安魂曲
-A Mass for the dead.

1113
02:03:03,074 --> 02:03:07,040
什么死者，谁死了
What dead?
Who is dead?

1114
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:12,082
一位应该有安魂曲的人
只不过他没有
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass,
and never got one.

1115
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:15,380
你是谁
我只是个信差
-Who are you?
-I am onIy a messenger.

1116
02:03:16,354 --> 02:03:17,878
你接受吗
Do you accept?

1117
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:20,724
你会得到很高的酬劳
You wiII be weII paid.

1118
02:03:28,867 --> 02:03:30,266
你接受吗
Do you accept?

1119
02:03:41,713 --> 02:03:46,150
快一点，绝对不能
告诉任何人你做什么
Work fast.
And be sure to teII no one
what you do.

1120
02:03:46,251 --> 02:03:48,776
你会再次看到我的
You wiII see me again soon.

1121
02:04:25,156 --> 02:04:26,817
伍尔夫
WoIfie?

1122
02:04:37,769 --> 02:04:40,101
我的阴谋那么的简单
My pIan was so simpIe...

1123
02:04:41,806 --> 02:04:43,797
可是却使我非常的害怕
...that it terrified me.

1124
02:04:46,244 --> 02:04:49,702
首先我必须去买死亡面具
然后...
First, I must get the death Mass,
and then...

1125
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:54,113
我必须使他死亡
...I must achieve his death.

1126
02:04:56,654 --> 02:04:58,144
什么
What?

1127
02:04:59,290 --> 02:05:04,791
那是葬礼，想想看
His funeraI!
Imagine it! The cathedraI...

1128
02:05:03,828 --> 02:05:07,863
大教堂，全维也纳人坐在那里
...aII Vienna sitting there.
His coffin...

1129
02:05:07,065 --> 02:05:12,503
中间就是莫札特的小棺材
...Mozart's IittIe coffin
in the middIe.

1130
02:05:13,071 --> 02:05:21,536
然后在沉默中音乐响起
And then...
...in that siIence...
...music.

1131
02:05:23,147 --> 02:05:28,744
突然冒出了天籁般的音乐
A divine music...
...bursts out over them aII.

1132
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:33,284
这是伟大的死亡弥撒
A great Mass of death.

1133
02:05:34,092 --> 02:05:38,028
伍尔夫莫札特的安魂曲
Requiem Mass for WoIfgang Mozart.

1134
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:45,527
由他忠实的朋友
安东尼萨列里所写的
Composed by his devoted friend...
...Antonio SaIieri.

1135
02:05:46,671 --> 02:05:54,874
真是太美的，太有深度的
那么热情的音乐
What subIimity!
What depth!
What passion in the music!

1136
02:05:55,246 --> 02:05:59,342
萨列里终于受到了上帝的感召
SaIieri has been
touched by God at Iast...

1137
02:05:59,450 --> 02:06:07,050
上帝被迫要去听
没有任何的力量可以阻止
...and God forced to Iisten!
PowerIess to stop it!

1138
02:06:07,158 --> 02:06:10,719
最后我终于有机会去取笑他
I, for once, in the end,
Iaughing at him!

1139
02:06:17,969 --> 02:06:21,769
唯一使我担心的是
如何实际下手杀他
The onIy thing that worried me
was the actuaI kiIIing.

1140
02:06:22,540 --> 02:06:24,098
这到底要怎么去做
How does one do that?

1141
02:06:25,743 --> 02:06:27,836
到底要怎么样去杀人
How does one kiII a man?

1142
02:06:29,647 --> 02:06:33,811
这是人们可以去梦想的事
It's one thing to...
...dream about it.

1143
02:06:34,519 --> 02:06:47,125
可是要亲手去做时
却是非常不同的
Very different when you...
...when you have to do it...
...with your own hands.

1144
02:06:57,008 --> 02:06:59,533
请进...
Come in!

1145
02:07:09,921 --> 02:07:15,416
唐乔文尼

1146
02:07:15,526 --> 02:07:20,225
我来吃晚餐了
I've come to dinner

1147
02:07:20,331 --> 02:07:23,300
晚餐，你疯了吗
我是一个贵族
Dinner! Are you mad?
I'm a nobIeman!

1148
02:07:23,401 --> 02:07:26,302
我只和与我身高相当的人用餐
I onIy ever dine with
peopIe of my own height!

1149
02:07:26,404 --> 02:07:28,770
别踢了
Stop it!

1150
02:07:28,906 --> 02:07:34,075
小心...
Be careful
Be careful
Hold tight

1151
02:07:35,013 --> 02:07:40,508
我是一位有名的骑士
I'm a famous...
...horseman

1152
02:07:40,618 --> 02:07:45,385
我们是有名的小马
And we're a famous horsy

1153
02:07:46,858 --> 02:07:50,885
给我一个马蹄，达令
Give me a hoof, my darling

1154
02:07:50,995 --> 02:07:56,365
我就会把我的心找给你
And I'll give you my heart

1155
02:07:56,467 --> 02:08:04,932
带我去你的马廊
我们永不分离
Take me to your stuble
And never more we'll part

1156
02:08:11,716 --> 02:08:16,176
杀我...
Kill me
Kill me

1157
02:08:35,373 --> 02:08:41,175
We're going to make a soprano stew

1158
02:08:45,316 --> 02:08:48,444
And when you make a soprano stew

1159
02:08:48,653 --> 02:08:51,121
住口
Shut up!

1160
02:08:51,889 --> 02:08:54,221
我厌倦这首曲子
I'm sick to death of that tune!

1161
02:09:12,977 --> 02:09:16,572
Give him some hay, my darling

1162
02:09:16,781 --> 02:09:20,376
And I'll give you my heart

1163
02:09:21,052 --> 02:09:25,614
里奥波，干草，快一点
LeporeIIo! Some hay!

1164
02:10:13,671 --> 02:10:20,167
We hope
You're contented

1165
02:10:21,445 --> 02:10:28,442
With what
We've presented

1166
02:10:29,287 --> 02:10:35,954
And love our dove of peace

1167
02:11:01,752 --> 02:11:02,878
你认为怎么样
What did you think?
WonderfuI!

1168
02:11:02,987 --> 02:11:06,423
棒极了，他喜欢那些侏儒
是不是
He Iiked the IittIe peopIe.

1169
02:11:06,524 --> 02:11:09,516
这真的很有趣
It's aII in good fun.

1170
02:11:09,927 --> 02:11:11,554
我喜欢马
I Iiked the horse.

1171
02:11:23,074 --> 02:11:30,173
如果你能够在这里演奏
“唐乔文尼”一定会很轰动的
I teII you, if you pIayed
Don Giovanni here...
...you wouId have had
a wonderfuI success.

1172
02:11:30,281 --> 02:11:35,777
你属于这里
而不是高傲的宫廷
You beIong here.
Not at the snobby court.

1173
02:11:35,052 --> 02:11:36,417
你可以随心所欲
You couId do anything you Iike.

1174
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:38,647
越不可思议的越好
The more fantastic, the better.

1175
02:11:38,756 --> 02:11:41,520
这就是人们所要的，幻想
That's what peopIe want, fantasy.

1176
02:11:41,626 --> 02:11:47,531
你为我写一个好的角色
几首好的曲子
You write...
...a proper part for me.
A coupIe of catchy songs...

1177
02:11:47,632 --> 02:11:52,126
我保证你一定会轰动的
...I guarantee you a triumph deIuxe!

1178
02:11:52,603 --> 02:11:54,070
你认为怎么样
-What do you say?

1179
02:11:54,238 --> 02:11:56,103
你付他多少钱
-How much wiII you pay him?

1180
02:11:58,776 --> 02:12:02,268
原来你带经纪人来了
WeII! I see you brought
your manager with you.

1181
02:12:04,282 --> 02:12:10,016
夫人，收入的一半如何
WeII, madame...
...how about...
...haIf the receipts?

1182
02:12:10,121 --> 02:12:13,990
收入的一半如何，史坦丝
HaIf the receipts!
-Stanzi!
-I'm taIking about now.

1183
02:12:12,556 --> 02:12:17,388
我说的是现在
你现在付他多少钱
How much wiII you pay him now?
Down payment.

1184
02:12:16,594 --> 02:12:20,086
订金
订金...
Down payment?

1185
02:12:21,098 --> 02:12:23,896
你认为我是谁，帝王吗
Who do you think I am, the emperor?

1186
02:12:24,535 --> 02:12:29,897
我必须走了
待下来好好享受下去
I have to go.
Stay, you'II enjoy this next one.

1187
02:12:32,410 --> 02:12:34,844
你不可以这么做
为什么，一半
You won't do this.
-Why? HaIf the house!

1188
02:12:34,946 --> 02:12:37,312
什么时候才有收入
我们现在需要钱
-When?
We need money now! 

1189
02:12:37,415 --> 02:12:38,609
他现在不付你钱
你就不能做
He pays
you now, or you don't do it.

1190
02:12:38,716 --> 02:12:42,413
史坦丝
我不信任那个人
I don't trust him.

1191
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:44,715
我不喜欢他这样子
演奏你的歌剧
I don't Iike what he did
to your opera. It was common.

1192
02:12:44,822 --> 02:12:47,290
真是庸俗
可是你喜欢，不是吗
You Iiked it.

1193
02:12:47,391 --> 02:12:49,450
猴子，热热闹闹的
Monkey, punky, fIunky!

1194
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:52,859
一半的收入
你一毛钱都看不到
HaIf the house.

1195
02:12:50,561 --> 02:12:54,827
我要亲手拿到钱
We'II never see a penny.
I want it here in my hand.

1196
02:12:54,699 --> 02:12:57,793
史坦丝
我会把钱放在你手中的
I'II put it here in your hand.

1197
02:12:57,902 --> 02:13:02,999
直到你拿钱出来
我才不准你抱我
Shut up!
You won't put a thing in my hand
untiI I see some money!

1198
02:13:03,307 --> 02:13:03,796
这实在太丢人了
It's embarrassing.

1199
02:13:05,309 --> 02:13:08,437
难道没有人能够帮忙吗
Can you think of anyone
who can do something for him?

1200
02:13:09,847 --> 02:13:12,975
莫札特已经江郎才尽
I'm afraid Mozart is
a Iost cause, baron.

1201
02:13:14,218 --> 02:13:18,120
老是跟市井小民瞎搅和
He has succeeded in aIienating
practicaIIy aII of Vienna.

1202
02:13:18,990 --> 02:13:21,049
莫札特从不清偿债务
He never pays his debts.

1203
02:13:21,158 --> 02:13:24,992
我实在想不出有谁帮得上忙
I can't think of anyone
to whom I'd dare recommend him.

1204
02:13:25,096 --> 02:13:28,532
莫札特，真是想不到
Herr Mozart. What a surprise!

1205
02:13:30,601 --> 02:13:32,193
你有什么事情吗？
What can I do for you?

1206
02:13:34,138 --> 02:13:38,040
我的学生
是否还有兴趣学习音乐
Is my pupiI stiII interested
in Iearning the art of music?

1207
02:13:40,311 --> 02:13:44,213
你的学生已经结婚
嫁到夫家去了
Your pupiI is married and
Iiving in Manheim, young man.

1208
02:13:45,616 --> 02:13:47,174
真的吗
ReaIIy?

1209
02:13:52,857 --> 02:13:58,523
或许你可爱的妻子
会想要学习音乐
Perhaps your...
...dear wife might care to
profit from my instruction.

1210
02:13:58,996 --> 02:14:00,554
莫札特，干什么？
What is it, Mozart?

1211
02:14:01,432 --> 02:14:03,024
你是怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

1212
02:14:04,235 --> 02:14:09,800
既然没有人需要我服务
WeII, since...
...it appears no one is eager
to hire my services...

1213
02:14:11,075 --> 02:14:13,942
是否可以施舍一些钱给我
...couId you favor me with
a IittIe money instead?

1214
02:14:17,982 --> 02:14:19,574
为什么？
What for?

1215
02:14:20,985 --> 02:14:24,250
男人赚不到钱只有用借的
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

1216
02:14:28,492 --> 02:14:30,722
能够说出这番话也是厉害
That's hardIy the way to go about it.

1217
02:14:32,396 --> 02:14:35,729
你说得对，没错
You are right, sir. You are right.

1218
02:14:35,833 --> 02:14:40,361
我有我的才能
而你的是财富
But you see, I am endowed with
taIent, and you with money.

1219
02:14:40,471 --> 02:14:42,803
我把我的才能给你
If I offer mine...

1220
02:14:42,907 --> 02:14:44,636
你也该给我你的才能
...you shouId offer yours.

1221
02:14:48,646 --> 02:14:50,705
很抱歉，我不要给你钱
I'm sorry, no.

1222
02:14:53,651 --> 02:14:55,175
求求你
PIease.

1223
02:14:57,054 --> 02:14:59,545
我的回答是，不要
My answer is no, Mozart.

1224
02:15:05,996 --> 02:15:07,827
求求你
PIease.

1225
02:15:12,002 --> 02:15:14,766
求求你
PIease!

1226
02:15:38,462 --> 02:15:39,793
伍尔夫...

1227
02:15:44,435 --> 02:15:45,868
伍尔夫...

1228
02:15:51,075 --> 02:15:52,269
不要开门
Don't answer it.

1229
02:15:55,079 --> 02:15:56,273
为什么
Why?

1230
02:15:59,016 --> 02:16:03,644
告诉他...我不在家
TeII him....
TeII him I'm not here.

1231
02:16:04,555 --> 02:16:09,357
告诉他我在工作
TeII him I'm working on it.

1232
02:16:10,995 --> 02:16:12,553
请他晚一点再回来
Come back Iater.

1233
02:16:29,246 --> 02:16:32,238
我是不是打扰了
没有
Am I interrupting something?

1234
02:16:30,915 --> 02:16:33,441
很好
-No.
-Good.

1235
02:16:33,951 --> 02:16:36,950
我们的朋友在哪里
他不在家
Where's our friend?
He's not here.

1236
02:16:37,855 --> 02:16:40,517
他要我告诉你，他正在努力
But he's working on it,
he toId me to teII you.

1237
02:16:42,326 --> 02:16:43,987
就是这个吗
Is that it?

1238
02:16:50,401 --> 02:16:52,232
他感到满意吗
Is he happy with it?

1239
02:16:55,639 --> 02:16:56,867
这是什么
What's this? A Requiem Mass?

1240
02:16:57,174 --> 02:17:01,033
安魂曲
他以为我是开殡仪馆的吗
You think I'm in the funeraI business?

1241
02:17:00,578 --> 02:17:01,545
不要碰这个
Put it down!

1242
02:17:01,645 --> 02:17:04,614
放下来...
这不是给你的
It's not for you!

1243
02:17:04,715 --> 02:17:06,910
对不起...
I'm sorry.

1244
02:17:08,586 --> 02:17:10,349
你为我做了些什么
What have you got for me?

1245
02:17:11,088 --> 02:17:12,612
做完了吗
Finished?

1246
02:17:14,258 --> 02:17:18,126
什么
歌剧，你认为呢
-What?
-The vaudeviIIe, what do you think?

1247
02:17:19,463 --> 02:17:21,055
做完了
Yes.

1248
02:17:21,265 --> 02:17:22,596
可以给我看看吗
Can I see it?

1249
02:17:22,933 --> 02:17:24,230
不行
No.

1250
02:17:24,835 --> 02:17:26,029
为什么不行
Why not?

1251
02:17:26,904 --> 02:17:28,804
因为没有什么给你看的
Because there's nothing to see.

1252
02:17:37,781 --> 02:17:46,280
我问你下周是否
可以开始采排，你说可以
Look...
...I asked you if we couId start
rehearsaIs next week and you said yes.

1253
02:17:47,358 --> 02:17:51,192
我们是可以
那就让我看看，在哪里
-We can.
-So Iet me see it. Where is it?

1254
02:17:52,763 --> 02:17:57,564
这里，全在我脑里
Here.
It's aII right here in my noodIe.

1255
02:17:58,168 --> 02:18:04,971
其他只是拼命的写...
The rest is just scribbIing.
ScribbIing and bibbIing,
bibbIing and scribbIing.

1256
02:18:08,178 --> 02:18:10,612
要不要喝一杯
你这个小丑...
-Like a drink?
-Look, you IittIe cunt!

1257
02:18:10,714 --> 02:18:13,182
你知道我请了多少人
有多少人在等你
Do you know how many
peopIe I've hired?

1258
02:18:13,284 --> 02:18:15,844
别烦他
你知道我要付这些人钱吗
Leave him aIone!
I'm paying these peopIe!

1259
02:18:15,953 --> 02:18:16,783
他在尽力了
He's doing his best.

1260
02:18:16,887 --> 02:18:19,048
我要付这些人钱
他尽力了
I'm paying them to wait.
It's ridicuIous!

1261
02:18:19,156 --> 02:18:20,487
这真的是太荒谬了
You know what's ridicuIous?

1262
02:18:20,591 --> 02:18:24,584
你知道什么才荒谬
你们的歌舞剧
Your Iibretto!

1263
02:18:24,695 --> 02:18:27,755
只有白痴
才会叫伍尔夫写这种作品
OnIy an idiot wouId ask WoIfie
to work on that!

1264
02:18:27,865 --> 02:18:30,356
12尺长的蛇，魔笛
TweIve-foot snakes, magic fIutes?

1265
02:18:30,467 --> 02:18:33,265
写安魂曲有什么了不起的
What's so inteIIigent about a Requiem?

1266
02:18:33,370 --> 02:18:36,771
钱...
Money. Money.

1267
02:18:39,476 --> 02:18:40,966
你疯了
You're mad.

1268
02:18:42,112 --> 02:18:44,808
伍尔夫，她疯了
是的
She's mad.

1269
02:18:43,347 --> 02:18:52,048
伍尔夫，赶快写下来
写在纸上
-Oh, yes?
-WoIfie, write it down.
Just write it down.
On paper.

1270
02:18:52,589 --> 02:18:55,990
在你的脑海里
没有任何人能够用
It's no use to anybody in your head.

1271
02:18:56,093 --> 02:18:59,654
不要去管你的死亡弥撒了
To heII with your death Mass!

1272
02:19:00,397 --> 02:19:03,264
冷静一点，你怎么了
CaIm yourseIf.
What's the matter with you?

1273
02:19:03,367 --> 02:19:05,494
我不去那里工作了
I won't work there anymore.

1274
02:19:05,602 --> 02:19:07,160
发生了什么事
What happened?

1275
02:19:07,971 --> 02:19:13,932
你不知道那是什么样的地方
莫札特先生使我害怕
You don't know what it's Iike.
Herr Mozart frightens me.

1276
02:19:14,445 --> 02:19:20,247
他一整天喝酒
吃了药以后更糟糕
He drinks aII day...
...then takes aII that medicine
and it makes him worse.

1277
02:19:20,351 --> 02:19:21,875
他有工作吗
Is he working?

1278
02:19:23,620 --> 02:19:31,354
先生，我真的好害怕
他说话时都语无伦次
他在工作吗
Oh, I am frightened, sir, reaIIy!
-When he speaks, he makes no sense.
-Is he working?

1279
02:19:33,864 --> 02:19:36,094
我想是吧
I suppose so.

1280
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:39,936
他总是坐在那里写无聊的歌剧
He sits there aII the time,
doing some siIIy opera.

1281
02:19:41,472 --> 02:19:44,839
歌剧
请你不要让我回去
Opera?
Don't ask me to go back again.

1282
02:19:44,942 --> 02:19:48,002
我真的好害怕...
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!

1283
02:19:48,112 --> 02:19:50,774
你确定那是歌剧吗
Are you sure it's an opera?

1284
02:21:35,219 --> 02:21:36,982
我还没有写好
I don't have it yet.

1285
02:21:38,222 --> 02:21:40,816
你是不是忽略了我的工作
Are you negIecting my request?

1286
02:21:41,959 --> 02:21:48,296
不...我答应你
No. No, I....
I promise you...

1287
02:21:48,432 --> 02:21:51,993
我会给你很好的作品
我最棒的作品
...I'II give you a wonderfuI
piece, the best I ever--

1288
02:21:56,173 --> 02:21:59,301
这是我的太太史坦丝
This is my wife, Stanzi.

1289
02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:03,211
我生病了
可是现在没事了，对不对
I've been sick,
but I'm aII right now, aren't I?

1290
02:22:03,614 --> 02:22:08,845
先生，他没事了
他最近非常的努力
Yes, sir.
He's aII right.
And he's working on it very hard.

1291
02:22:10,554 --> 02:22:13,785
再给我两星期
Give me two more weeks. PIease.

1292
02:22:14,558 --> 02:22:18,756
你越早能够完成
能得到的奖励越大
The sooner you finish...

1293
02:22:16,393 --> 02:22:20,393
赶快工作
...the greater your reward. Work.

1294
02:22:29,907 --> 02:22:31,169
伍尔夫
WoIfie.

1295
02:22:33,810 --> 02:22:36,472
我真的认为你要疯了
I think you reaIIy are going mad.

1296
02:22:38,649 --> 02:22:41,117
你为那个白痴演员
像奴隶一般的工作
You sIave for that actor

1297
02:22:41,218 --> 02:22:42,913
他一毛钱都不付给你
who won't give you a penny!

1298
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:50,122
这可不是鬼魂
这是一个带钱来的真人
And here....
This is not a ghost!
This is a reaI man,
who puts down reaI money.

1299
02:22:52,229 --> 02:22:55,824
你为什么还不做完
Why on earth won't you finish it?

1300
02:22:56,333 --> 02:23:00,064
你可不可以告诉我
一个我可以理解的理由
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?

1301
02:23:02,105 --> 02:23:03,766
我快被工作给杀死了
It's kiIIing me.

1302
02:23:08,078 --> 02:23:10,137
你是不是喝醉了
You're drunk, aren't you?

1303
02:23:10,847 --> 02:23:13,509
老实的告诉我
你是不是又喝酒
Be honest, teII me.
You've been drinking.

1304
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:18,147
这样不公平
It's not fair. I worry about you
aII the time.

1305
02:23:18,689 --> 02:23:24,787
我总是在担心你
我尽我的能力去帮助你
I do everything I can to heIp you.

1306
02:23:25,228 --> 02:23:29,790
你只会喝酒
语无伦次使我害怕
And aII you do is drink and
taIk nonsense, and frighten me.

1307
02:23:29,900 --> 02:23:31,458
回去睡觉
Go back to bed!

1308
02:23:41,678 --> 02:23:48,049
求求你，让我坐在这里
PIease.
Let me....
Let me sit here.

1309
02:23:51,321 --> 02:23:53,881
让我陪你
Let me stay here with you.

1310
02:25:58,381 --> 02:25:59,575
史坦丝

1311
02:26:09,726 --> 02:26:11,353
史坦丝

1312
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:26,803
史坦丝

1313
02:26:26,910 --> 02:26:29,936
是我做的，而且我很骄傲
I did it!
And I was proud to do it.

1314
02:26:30,046 --> 02:26:34,480
我叫她立刻离开
带着孩子走
''Leave!'' I said.
''Take the chiId with you!
Go to the spa...

1315
02:26:33,283 --> 02:26:37,881
我给你钱，你去度个假
好好的休养身体
...and get your heaIth back.''
I was shocked.

1316
02:26:36,787 --> 02:26:41,486
我看到她的时候
简直是大吃了一惊
Shocked to my foundation
when I saw her.

1317
02:26:41,591 --> 02:26:44,822
我简直是不敢相信我的眼睛
她太可怜了
I couIdn't beIieve my eyes,
poor IittIe thing.

1318
02:26:44,928 --> 02:26:48,694
你这个怪物
除了你，根本没有任何人重要
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?

1319
02:26:48,799 --> 02:26:50,733
你和你的音乐
You and your music. I warned her.

1320
02:26:50,834 --> 02:26:53,428
我警告过她
选一个男人不能选一个婴儿
''Choose a man, not a baby,'' I said.

1321
02:26:53,537 --> 02:27:00,236
我说过，你嫁给他
连小便都没马桶
你真的是太自私了...
''You marry him, you won't have a pot
to piss in.'' You seIfish thing!

1322
02:27:00,343 --> 02:27:05,280
你就是这么的自私
SeIfish, that's what you are.
SimpIy seIfish! Do you hear me?

1323
02:30:48,405 --> 02:30:50,906
把他扶起来...
Pick him up.
Pick him up!

1324
02:30:53,710 --> 02:30:57,703
小心一点，跟我来
你和我来
Be carefuI! Come with me!
You, foIIow me.

1325
02:31:25,642 --> 02:31:26,540
结束了吗
-Is it over?

1326
02:31:26,643 --> 02:31:28,338
结束了...
-Yes, it's over. It's over.

1327
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:32,177
快走...
Go!

1328
02:32:13,990 --> 02:32:15,651
走吧...
Go, go. go.

1329
02:32:16,593 --> 02:32:18,458
走啦
Go! Go!

1330
02:32:47,757 --> 02:32:49,281
你的妻子在哪里...
Where is your wife?

1331
02:32:52,896 --> 02:32:54,454
你的妻子呢？
Where is your wife?

1332
02:32:57,534 --> 02:33:01,231
她身体也不舒服，她去度假了
She's not weII either.
She went to the spa.

1333
02:33:02,872 --> 02:33:05,170
你对我实在太好了
You are so good to me.

1334
02:33:05,942 --> 02:33:09,070
真的，谢谢你
TruIy. Thank you.

1335
02:33:09,546 --> 02:33:16,042
请不要...
不，我的意思是听我的歌剧
PIease!
No, I mean to come to my opera.

1336
02:33:16,319 --> 02:33:21,313
你...你是唯一来的音乐家
You.... You are the onIy coIIeague
of mine who came.

1337
02:33:24,227 --> 02:33:26,218
莫札特
Mozart.

1338
02:33:27,230 --> 02:33:30,199
我不会错过任何你的作品
I wouId never miss anything
you had written.

1339
02:33:31,467 --> 02:33:37,770
这只是歌舞剧
不，这是杰作
-It's just a vaudeviIIe.
-No, no!
It's a subIime piece.

1340
02:33:38,341 --> 02:33:40,366
这是最精彩的歌剧
The grandest operone!

1341
02:33:49,652 --> 02:33:55,413
你是我所认识最杰出的作曲家
I teII you...
...you are the greatest
composer known to me.

1342
02:34:00,063 --> 02:34:01,655
这是你的真心话吗
Do you mean it?

1343
02:34:07,270 --> 02:34:09,636
是他
是谁？
-It's him!
-Who?

1344
02:34:09,739 --> 02:34:11,036
那个男人
The man.

1345
02:34:11,908 --> 02:34:13,068
他来了
He's here.

1346
02:34:16,846 --> 02:34:18,609
叫他离开
TeII him to go away.

1347
02:34:18,915 --> 02:34:22,544
告诉他我还在努力
不要让他进来
TeII him I'm stiII working on it.
Don't Iet him in.

1348
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:26,315
不...等一下
No, no. Wait!

1349
02:34:26,623 --> 02:34:30,855
问他可不可以先给我一点钱
Ask him if he wouId
give me some money now.

1350
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:33,554
如果他可以给我钱
我可以快一点写好
TeII him it wiII heIp me finish it.

1351
02:34:53,283 --> 02:34:55,979
萨列里先生
是的
SaIieri?
Yes.

1352
02:34:57,453 --> 02:34:59,648
我们可以进来吗
最好不要
-Can we come in?
-Better not. He's sIeeping.

1353
02:34:59,756 --> 02:35:05,382
他睡着了
他没事吧
-He's aII right?
-Yes, he's just exhausted.

1354
02:35:03,726 --> 02:35:09,392
他只是累极了，有点头昏
He became dizzy, that's aII.

1355
02:35:09,499 --> 02:35:14,232
告诉他我们来过了
当然
TeII him we came by, won't you?
Of course.

1356
02:35:14,404 --> 02:35:18,704
把这个交给他，这是他的份
Give him this. That's his share.

1357
02:35:18,808 --> 02:35:21,504
这应该会使他开心的
没错
-That shouId cheer him up.
-Indeed!

1358
02:35:21,678 --> 02:35:27,344
大家晚安，真的是太完美了
And now, good night to you aII.

1359
02:35:27,450 --> 02:35:28,815
谢谢
Thank you.

1360
02:35:39,395 --> 02:35:40,885
怎么了
What happened?

1361
02:35:49,739 --> 02:35:51,639
他要我把这个交给你
He said to give you this.

1362
02:35:53,142 --> 02:35:55,736
如果你明天晚上之前
把工作做完
And if you finish by tomorrow night...

1363
02:35:56,979 --> 02:35:59,607
他会再给你100
...he wiII pay you
another hundred ducats.

1364
02:36:01,017 --> 02:36:03,042
还有...
Another...?

1365
02:36:03,486 --> 02:36:05,181
但是太快了
That's too soon. Tomorrow night....

1366
02:36:05,288 --> 02:36:09,725
明天晚上，这是不可能的
It's impossibIe.

1367
02:36:13,529 --> 02:36:17,064
他说100吗
是的
Did he say 100?
Yes.

1368
02:36:22,238 --> 02:36:23,967
太赶了
It's too soon.

1369
02:36:26,409 --> 02:36:30,402
我可以帮你忙吗
Can I...?
CouId I heIp you?

1370
02:36:33,349 --> 02:36:34,782
你愿意吗
WouId you?

1371
02:36:39,055 --> 02:36:39,953
事实上你可以
ActuaIIy, you couId.

1372
02:36:47,764 --> 02:36:49,823
我要走了
去哪里
-I want to go.
-Where?

1373
02:36:51,033 --> 02:36:53,598
我想回去维也纳
现在吗
Back to Vienna.
Now?

1374
02:36:54,370 --> 02:36:55,064
是的
-Yes.
-Why?

1375
02:36:55,171 --> 02:36:59,767
为什么
我觉得不对
I feeI wrong.

1376
02:37:01,511 --> 02:37:03,672
我留在这里觉得不对
I feeI wrong being here.

1377
02:37:06,916 --> 02:37:08,440
我停在哪里
-Where did I stop?

1378
02:37:08,651 --> 02:37:10,551
上一段的结束
-The end of the Recordare.

1379
02:37:10,653 --> 02:37:11,779
不是的...
So now confututis....

1380
02:37:11,888 --> 02:37:14,618
拉丁文

1381
02:37:19,295 --> 02:37:24,062
这个要怎么翻译
被悲哀的火焰燃烧
How wouId you transIate that?
''Consigned to fIames of woe.''

1382
02:37:27,069 --> 02:37:28,468
你相信这个吗
Do you beIieve in it?

1383
02:37:29,105 --> 02:37:30,470
什么
What?

1384
02:37:30,907 --> 02:37:34,741
永远不会熄灭的火焰
永远燃烧着你
A fire which never dies,
burning you forever.

1385
02:37:36,379 --> 02:37:37,937
当然
Oh, yes.

1386
02:37:39,348 --> 02:37:40,781
这有可能吗
PossibIe.

1387
02:37:42,585 --> 02:37:43,916
我们开始吧
Come, Iet's begin.

1388
02:37:44,954 --> 02:37:46,854
我们是以F大调结束的
是的
We ended in F major.

1389
02:37:46,956 --> 02:37:49,186
现在...降A调
-Yes.
-So, now, A minor.

降A调
Confututis. A minor.

02:38:26,462 --> 02:38:27,656
看到了没有
You see?

1398
02:38:27,763 --> 02:38:29,924
是不是升半音
当然
-Yes. D sharp?
-Of course.

1399
02:38:30,032 --> 02:38:32,592

02:38:40,076 --> 02:38:41,373
你记下来了吗
好像有
Do you have me? 

1402
02:38:41,477 --> 02:38:42,569
给我看
Show me.

1403
02:39:02,265 --> 02:39:04,665

Good. Good.

02:39:12,174 --> 02:39:15,473
第二段第四拍D调
Second measure, fourth beat. D.

1407
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:20,014
很好
是的...
-AII right?
-Yes, continue.

1408
02:39:20,116 --> 02:39:22,744
第四段的第二拍F调
Second beat of the
fourth measure, on F.

1409
02:39:30,593 --> 02:39:31,719
现在交响乐响起
Now the orchestra. 

1410
02:39:31,827 --> 02:39:34,625
第二簧管，低音管，和低音一起

1411
02:39:34,730 --> 02:39:36,721
同样的音符与节奏
IdenticaI notes and rhythm.

1412
02:39:40,236 --> 02:39:43,728
第一簧管，高音喇叭加上高音
First bassoon, tenor trombones,
with tenors.

1413
02:39:49,645 --> 02:39:53,240
你的速度太快了
你有没有记下来...
-You go too fast.
-Do you have it?

1414
02:39:53,349 --> 02:39:54,509
第一簧管，高音喇叭加上什么
-Bassoon to trombone what?

1415
02:39:54,617 --> 02:39:56,278
加上高音
-The tenors.

1416
02:39:56,953 --> 02:40:00,320
一样的吗
当然，乐器与歌声一样
-IdenticaI?
-The instruments doubIing the voices.

1417
02:40:00,423 --> 02:40:02,084
现在是喇叭
Trumpets and timpani.

1418
02:40:02,191 --> 02:40:04,955
喇叭是D调，听我说...
我无法理解
Trumpets in D. Listen.

1419
02:40:03,826 --> 02:40:06,494
注意听
-I don't understand!
-Listen!

1420
02:40:06,696 --> 02:40:10,757
现在主要是喇叭D调
第一与第三拍
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant,
first and third beats.

1421
02:40:12,168 --> 02:40:14,534
这和韵律是结合的
It goes with the harmony!

1422
02:40:20,910 --> 02:40:23,378
对了...
Yes. Yes, yes!

1423
02:40:32,488 --> 02:40:34,752
现在我理解了...
就是这样子吗
I understand. And that's aII?

1424
02:40:34,857 --> 02:40:40,295
现在才是高潮
弦乐现在一起A调
No, now for the reaI fire.
Strings in unison.
Ostinato on A. Like this.

1425
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:46,034
接下来越来越高昂
Next measure is rising.

1426
02:40:48,070 --> 02:40:49,435
你记下来了吗
是的...
Do you have it? 

1427
02:40:49,538 --> 02:40:50,630
给我看...
Show me.

1428
02:40:57,913 --> 02:41:01,314
真的是棒极了
是的...继续
-It's wonderfuI!
-Yes, yes. Go on.

1429
02:41:04,654 --> 02:41:06,019
柔和...

1430
02:41:07,623 --> 02:41:10,490
写下来
好的...
-Write that down!
-Yes, yes.

1431
02:41:13,496 --> 02:41:15,862
''CaII me among the bIessed.''

1432
02:41:17,033 --> 02:41:23,666
C大调，中音与高音
中音是C调，高音更高
C major.
Sopranos and aItos in thirds.
AItos on C, sopranos above.

1433
02:41:27,977 --> 02:41:31,413
拉丁文

1434
02:41:36,018 --> 02:41:39,146
第二段时，高音是不是F调
是的
Sopranos up to F on the second voca?

1435
02:41:39,255 --> 02:41:43,783
下一段也一样...
还有快节奏的小提琴
And on dictus. And underneath,just vioIins. Arpeggios.

1436
02:41:45,861 --> 02:41:47,761
八个音符的降音阶
Descending scaIe in
eighth notes, back to ostinato.

1437
02:41:47,863 --> 02:41:50,525
现在回到原点
就是这样，可以了吗
-Do you have it?
-You go too fast.

1438
02:41:50,633 --> 02:41:51,861
你太快了
你写下来了吗
-Do you have it?

1439
02:41:51,967 --> 02:41:54,629
你的速度太快了
请等一下...
-One moment, pIease!

1440
02:41:57,873 --> 02:41:58,532
好了

1441
02:41:58,641 --> 02:42:01,405
很好，全部给我看
从一开头
Show me the whoIe thing
from the beginning.

1442
02:44:05,835 --> 02:44:07,325
你要不要休息一下
不，我一点都不累
Do you want to rest a bit?

1443
02:44:08,204 --> 02:44:10,297
No, I'm not tired at aII.

1444
02:44:15,678 --> 02:44:21,674
我们休息一下
等一下再结束这一段
We'II stop for a moment.

1445
02:44:19,181 --> 02:44:24,082
我可以继续下去
-Then we'II finish the Lacrimosa.
-I can keep going.

1446
02:44:24,987 --> 02:44:28,081
我睡一下，你可不可以陪我
WiII you stay with me
whiIe I sIeep a IittIe?

1447
02:44:29,892 --> 02:44:31,951
我不会丢下你的
I'm not Ieaving you.

1448
02:44:39,835 --> 02:44:44,806
我觉得好羞愧
为什么
I'm so ashamed.
Of what?

1449
02:44:45,841 --> 02:44:52,804
我好愚蠢，我以为你不喜欢我
我的作品
I was fooIish.
I thought you did not care
for my work, or me.

1450
02:44:56,886 --> 02:44:58,285
原谅我
Forgive me.

1451
02:45:03,292 --> 02:45:04,657
原谅我
Forgive me.

1452
02:46:03,052 --> 02:46:04,883
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

1453
02:46:07,389 --> 02:46:10,790
你的丈夫生病了
Your husband took sick.

1454
02:46:12,061 --> 02:46:13,494
我把他送回家
I brought him home.

1455
02:46:15,965 --> 02:46:17,557
为什么是你
Why you?

1456
02:46:18,901 --> 02:46:22,393
夫人，因为当时我在场
Because, madame, I was at hand.

1457
02:46:26,041 --> 02:46:28,032
我非常的感谢你
现在你可以走了
WeII, thank you very much.
You can go now.

1458
02:46:31,580 --> 02:46:33,172
他需要我，夫人
He needs me, ma'am.

1459
02:46:34,183 --> 02:46:36,014
他不需要你
No, he doesn't.

1460
02:46:36,251 --> 02:46:40,847
我不希望你留在这里
请你走吧
And I don't want you here.
Just go, pIease.

1461
02:46:41,056 --> 02:46:42,421
他叫我待下来
-He asked me to stay.

1462
02:46:42,524 --> 02:46:44,515
我请你...
-And I'm ask--

1463
02:47:02,378 --> 02:47:03,970
伍尔夫

1464
02:47:09,418 --> 02:47:10,851
伍尔夫

1465
02:47:14,123 --> 02:47:15,681
我回来了
I'm back.

1466
02:47:19,228 --> 02:47:22,026
我好想你
I missed you so much.

1467
02:47:26,201 --> 02:47:31,662
如果你告诉我你需要我
If you'd just...
...show me that you need me.

1468
02:47:38,047 --> 02:47:41,016
我也会努力做的更好
And I'II try to do better too.

1469
02:47:52,995 --> 02:47:54,690
这是什么
What is this?

1470
02:47:58,167 --> 02:48:02,866
不，伍尔夫，这个不行...
No, WoIfie, not this. Not this.

1471
02:48:06,041 --> 02:48:08,874
我不准你再写这个
You're not to work on this ever again.

1472
02:48:10,446 --> 02:48:11,708
我已经做了决定
I've decided.

1473
02:48:16,452 --> 02:48:18,386
这不是他的笔迹
This is not his handwriting.

1474
02:48:20,989 --> 02:48:22,251
是我的
It's mine.

1475
02:48:23,659 --> 02:48:25,490
我在帮助他
I was assisting him.

1476
02:48:26,995 --> 02:48:31,455
他不能继续写这个
这使他不舒服
He's not to work on this anymore.

1477
02:48:30,032 --> 02:48:32,966
可是...
-It's making him iII.
-But--

1478
02:48:35,671 --> 02:48:36,933
晚安
Good night.

1479
02:48:40,142 --> 02:48:44,545
对不起
我们没有仆人送你出去
I regret we have no servants
to show you out, Herr Salieri.

1480
02:48:44,646 --> 02:48:47,274
萨列里先生
请尊重我的意愿赶快走吧
PIease respect my wish and go.

1481
02:48:47,983 --> 02:48:52,018
夫人，我尊重
Madame...
...I wiII respect his.

1482
02:48:54,890 --> 02:48:56,448
伍尔夫...

1483
02:48:59,061 --> 02:49:00,289
伍尔夫...

1484
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,058
伍尔夫...

1485
02:49:11,440 --> 02:49:11,906
伍尔夫...

1486
02:49:14,109 --> 02:49:15,667
伍尔夫...

1487
02:49:17,579 --> 02:49:19,376
伍尔夫...

1488
02:49:21,316 --> 02:49:24,046
伍尔夫...

1489
02:51:50,966 --> 02:51:57,929
以天父，天子，圣灵之名

1490
02:52:07,716 --> 02:52:09,206
阿门

1491
02:52:57,165 --> 02:53:00,566
你那仁慈的上帝
Your mercifuI God.

1492
02:53:03,138 --> 02:53:05,936
她毁了她自己最爱
He destroyed his own beIoved,
rather than Iet a mediocrity...

1493
02:53:06,174 --> 02:53:12,443
而不让一个庸才
去分享她荣耀的一部份
...share in the smaIIest part
of his gIory.

1494
02:53:14,049 --> 02:53:19,180
她杀死了莫札特
可是使我活着，折磨我
He kiIIed Mozart.
And kept me aIive to torture.

1495
02:53:19,621 --> 02:53:23,751
她折磨了我32年
Thirty-two years of torture.
Thirty-two years...

1496
02:53:23,859 --> 02:53:27,795
我慢慢的看到我自己消失
...of sIowIy watching myseIf
become extinct.

1497
02:53:27,896 --> 02:53:32,390
我的音乐慢慢的消失
My music...
...growing fainter.

1498
02:53:32,567 --> 02:53:37,595
直到没有人再去演奏
AII the time fainter...
...tiII no one pIays it at aII.

1499
02:53:39,608 --> 02:53:41,166
而他的...
And his....

1500
02:53:42,711 --> 02:53:46,374
教授，早安
现在是上厕所的时候
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water cIoset.

1501
02:53:47,883 --> 02:53:50,044
我们准备了你最喜欢的早餐
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar roIIs. He Ioves those.

1502
02:53:50,152 --> 02:53:55,283
甜面包，他最喜欢
新鲜的甜面包
Fresh sugar roIIs.

1503
02:53:55,891 --> 02:53:58,724
我会替你美言的，神父
I wiII speak for you, Father.

1504
02:53:58,827 --> 02:54:02,126
我代表全世间所有的庸才
I speak for aII mediocrities
in the worId.

1505
02:54:02,230 --> 02:54:07,600
我是他们的英雄
我是他们的圣人
I am their champion.
I am their patron saint.

1506
02:54:18,413 --> 02:54:20,574
到处都是庸才
Mediocrities everywhere...

1507
02:54:22,551 --> 02:54:24,849
我宽恕你的罪
...I absoIve you.

1508
02:54:26,922 --> 02:54:28,412
我宽恕你的罪
I absoIve you.

1509
02:54:29,825 --> 02:54:31,224
我宽恕你的罪
I absoIve you.

1510
02:54:34,663 --> 02:54:36,688
我宽恕你的罪
I absoIve you.

1511
02:54:37,999 --> 02:54:40,866
我宽恕你们的罪
I absoIve you aII.
