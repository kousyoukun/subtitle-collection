1
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,380
Mozart!

2
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,260
Mozart!

3
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,380
Forgive your assassin!

4
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,500
I confess,I killed you!

5
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,060
"S?,I killed you,Mozart.

6
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,700
Mozart,"piet?! Forgive your assassin!

7
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,180
Forgive me,Mozart!

8
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,940
Signore Salieri, open the door,be good now!

9
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,380
"Signore",we have something special for you.

10
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,980
Something you're going to love.

11
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,100
Is that good!

12
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,500
"Signore",believe me...

13
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,780
...this is the most delicious thing I ever ate in my life!

14
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,780
Really,you don't know what you're miss...

15
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,780
All right,that's enough! Open the door.

16
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,900
"Signore",if you don't open this door...

17
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,980
...we're gonna leave nothing for you.

18
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,980
And I'm never gonna come see you again!

19
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,260
Good morning,Father.

20
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,700
Herr Salieri?

21
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,140
Leave me alone.

22
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,980
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

23
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,580
Do you know who I am?

24
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,620
That makes no difference.

25
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,380
All men are equal in God's eyes.

26
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,020
Are they?

27
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,500
Offer me your confession.

28
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,660
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

29
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,900
How well are you trained in music?

30
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,460
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.

31
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,940
- Where? - Here in Vienna.

32
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,100
Then you must know this.

33
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,540
I can't say that I do.

34
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,020
What is it?

35
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,300
It was a very popular tune in its day.

36
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,380
I wrote it.

37
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,780
Here,how about this?

38
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,540
This one brought down the house when we played it.

39
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,500
Well?

40
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,260
I regret it is not too familiar.

41
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,580
Can you recall no melody of mine?

42
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,020
I was the most famous composer in Europe.

43
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,380
I wrote 40 operas alone.

44
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,220
Here!

45
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,420
What about this one?

46
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,300
Yes,I know that!

47
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,060
That's charming!

48
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,860
I'm sorry,I didn't know you wrote that.

49
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,580
I didn't.

50
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,020
That was Mozart.

51
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,380
Wolfgang...

52
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,980
...Amadeus Mozart.

53
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,820
The man you accuse yourself of killing.

54
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,900
You've heard that?

55
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,660
Is it true?

56
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,380
For God's sake,my son...

57
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,940
...if you have something to confess, do it now.

58
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,380
Give yourself some peace.

59
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,740
He...

60
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,340
...was my idol.

61
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,860
Mozart.

62
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,860
I can't think of a time when I didn't know his name.

63
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,860
I was playing games...

64
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,380
... when he was playing music for kings and emperors.

65
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,860
Even the pope in Rome.

66
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,580
I admit,I was jealous...

67
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,020
... when I heard the tales they told about him.

68
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,580
Not of the brilliant little prodigy...

69
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,700
... but of his father, who had taught him everything.

70
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,740
My father,he did not care for music.

71
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,340
When I told him...

72
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,100
...how I wished I could be like Mozart...

73
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,740
... he would say,"Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey?

74
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:07,500
You'd like me to drag you around, doing tricks like a circus freak?"

75
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,980
How could I tell him...

76
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,500
...what music meant to me?

77
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,220
While my father prayed earnestly to God...

78
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,380
... to protect commerce...

79
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,500
... I would offer up...

80
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,180
... secretly...

81
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,620
... the proudest prayer a boy could think of.

82
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,180
"Lord,make me a great composer."

83
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,340
"Let me celebrate your glory through music...

84
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,540
... and be celebrated myself."

85
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,460
"Make me famous through the world."

86
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,940
"Make me immortal."

87
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,100
"After I die...

88
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,260
...let people speak my name with love for what I wrote."

89
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,060
"In return...

90
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,700
...I will give you my chastity...

91
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,820
...my industry...

92
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,220
...my deepest humility, every hour of my life."

93
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,660
"Amen."

94
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,460
And do you know what happened?

95
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,340
A miracle!

96
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,940
My life changed forever.

97
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,780
I knew God had arranged it all. That was obvious.

98
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,220
One minute I was a frustrated boy...

99
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,300
...in an obscure little town. The next I was here...

100
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,540
...in Vienna,city of musicians...

101
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,500
... and Emperor Joseph, the musical king.

102
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,700
In a few years,I was his court composer. Isn't that incredible?

103
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,140
Every night I sat with the emperor of Austria...

104
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,180
... playing duets with him...

105
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,620
... correcting the royal sight-reading.

106
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,420
Actually,the man had no ear at all.

107
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,380
But what did it matter?

108
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,460
He adored my music.

109
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,580
Tell me...

110
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,580
If you had been me...

111
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,900
...wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow?

112
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,660
And believe me,I honored it.

113
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,380
I was a model of virtue.

114
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,900
I kept my hands off women.

115
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,580
I worked hours every day teaching students,many for free!

116
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,980
Sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians.

117
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,820
Work,that was all my life.

118
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,180
And it was wonderful.

119
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,460
Everybody liked me.

120
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,660
I liked myself.

121
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,260
Until he came.

122
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,940
He came to Vienna to play some of his music...

123
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:46,820
...at the residence of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.

124
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,980
Eagerly,I went there to seek him out.

125
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,180
That night...

126
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,220
... changed my life.

127
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,540
As I wandered through the salon...

128
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,460
... I played a little game with myself.

129
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,100
This man had written his first concerto at the age of 4...

130
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,460
... his first symphony at 7, a full-scale opera at 12!

131
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,500
Did it show?

132
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,300
Is talent like that...

133
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,460
... written on the face?

134
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,860
Which one of them...

135
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,780
... could he be?

136
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,860
Mozart is not here.

137
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,780
- Stop it! - I am.

138
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,380
- Stop it! - I am stopping it.

139
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,660
I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.

140
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,340
There. You see? I've stopped.

141
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,540
- Now we're going back. - No!

142
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,420
Yes! You don't know where you are.

143
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,500
Here,everything goes backwards.

144
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,940
People walk and dance and sing and even talk backwards.

145
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:20,140
- That's stupid. - Why? People fart backwards.

146
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,700
Ssa-ym-ssik!

147
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,540
Ssa-ym-ssik!

148
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,100
Yes,you are. You are very sick.

149
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,100
No! Say it backwards,shitwit!

150
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,620
Ssa-ym-ssik.

151
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,780
Ssik,kiss.

152
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,460
Ym,my. Ssa.

153
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,020
Kiss my ass.

154
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,540
Em-yrram!

155
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,460
- I'm not playing! - Say it,it's serious.

156
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,620
It's very serious.

157
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,060
Yrram.

158
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,820
Marry me.

159
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,140
I'm not gonna marry you. You're a fiend.

160
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,300
Uoy-evol-I-tub.

161
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,220
Tub.

162
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,860
But I...

163
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,020
...love...

164
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,300
But I love you?

165
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,420
- Tihs-ym-tae. - What?

166
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,220
- Eat. - Eat.

167
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,420
- Ym,my. - My.

168
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,860
Tihs. Eat my shit.

169
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,180
You filthy fiend!

170
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,900
You filthy...!

171
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,900
My music.

172
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,140
They've started without me.

173
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,300
That was Mozart!

174
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,540
That giggling,dirty creature I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

175
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,180
- I think that went well,don't you? - Indeed.

176
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,860
The Viennese know good music, don't you think?

177
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,700
Certainly.

178
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,020
Your Grace.

179
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,420
Ah,Mozart.

180
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,420
- Why? - Why what,sir?

181
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,540
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests...

182
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,100
...by one of my own servants?

183
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,860
The more license I allow you, the more you take.

184
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,460
If His Grace is not satisfied, he can dismiss me.

185
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,220
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg.

186
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,700
- Your father is waiting for you there. - No,Your Grace!

187
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,900
I would prefer you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.

188
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:14,500
I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service...

189
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,980
...and learn your place.

190
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,660
On the page it looked...

191
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,660
Nothing!

192
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,980
The beginning simple,almost comic.

193
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,780
Just a pulse.

194
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,620
Bassoons,basset horns...

195
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,380
...like a rusty squeezebox.

196
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,300
And then,suddenly...

197
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,340
...high above it...

198
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,340
...an oboe.

199
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,780
A single note,hanging there, unwavering.

200
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,260
Until...

201
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,980
...a clarinet took it over...

202
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:44,820
...sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.

203
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:53,060
This was no composition by a performing monkey.

204
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,220
This was a music I had never heard.

205
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,980
Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing.

206
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,820
It seemed to me I was hearing the voice of God.

207
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,580
Excuse me.

208
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,620
But why?

209
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:20,580
Why would God choose an obscene child to be his instrument?

210
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,060
It was not to be believed.

211
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:29,460
This piece had to be an accident. It had to be.

212
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,580
It better be.

213
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,140
How good is he,this Mozart?

214
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,980
He's remarkable,Majesty. I heard an extraordinary opera of his last month.

215
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,140
-Idomeneo,King of Crete.  - That?

216
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,380
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.

217
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,580
Tiresome?

218
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,060
A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.

219
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Too much spice.

220
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,380
Too many notes.

221
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,860
Majesty...

222
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,580
...it was the most promising work I've heard in years.

223
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,420
Then,we should make some effort to acquire him.

224
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,020
We could use a good German composer in Vienna,surely?

225
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,500
I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say...

226
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,100
...an opera in German for our National Theater.

227
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,300
Excellent,sire!

228
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,540
But not German. I beg,Your Majesty.

229
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,140
Italian is the proper language for opera.

230
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,620
All educated people agree on that.

231
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,940
What do you think,chamberlain?

232
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,860
In my opinion,it's time we had a piece in our own language.

233
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,740
Plain German for plain people.

234
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,700
Kapellmeister?

235
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,500
Majesty...

236
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,540
...I must agree with "Herr Direttore".

237
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,260
German is...

238
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,180
...too brute for singing.

239
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,100
Court composer...

240
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,140
...what do you think?

241
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,460
I think it's an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna.

242
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,780
It should infuriate the archbishop...

243
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,700
...if that is Your Majesty's intention.

244
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,980
You are "cattivo",court composer.

245
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,020
I want to meet this young man. Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

246
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,460
Well,there it is!

247
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,740
This is a beautiful wig for you.

248
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,900
It looks so marvelous and I love it.

249
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,940
The other one.

250
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,460
Here is the other one. I think you will love it.

251
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,860
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.

252
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,740
- How do you like it? - They're all so beautiful!

253
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,820
Why don't I have three heads?

254
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,180
This is funny!

255
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,740
Three heads!

256
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,180
Gentlemen.

257
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,940
- Good morning. - Morning,Your Majesty.

258
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,140
What do you have for me today?

259
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,260
- Your Majesty,"Herr Mozart". - Yes,what about him?

260
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,980
He's here.

261
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,620
Well,there it is. Good!

262
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,340
I hope you won't find it improper, but I've written a march in his honor.

263
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,580
What a charming idea,court composer. May I see?

264
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,180
Just a...

265
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,620
Just a trifle,of course.

266
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,220
May I try it?

267
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,780
Let's have some fun.

268
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,940
Delightful,court composer!

269
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,540
May I play it when he comes in?

270
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,500
- You do me too much honor. - Bring in "Herr Mozart".

271
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,380
But slowly.

272
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,780
I need a minute to practice.

273
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,620
Good,continue.

274
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,340
G,Majesty.

275
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,380
Excellent!

276
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,700
Good,Majesty.

277
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,260
Continue. Very good.

278
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,820
Very good,Majesty.

279
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,980
Tempo! Up.

280
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,900
Lightly,then strongly! It's a march,Majesty.

281
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,300
Again.

282
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,260
Bravo,Majesty!

283
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:58,260
Gentlemen,please. A little less enthusiasm,I beg you.

284
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,980
No,please. It's not a holy relic.

285
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,140
You know,we have met before. In this very room.

286
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,700
You don't recall. You were only 6. He was giving a delightful concert!

287
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,540
As he got off the stool,he fell.

288
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,620
My sister Antoinette helped him up. Know what he did?

289
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:31,340
He jumped into her arms and said, "Will you marry me? Yes or no?"

290
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,500
You know all these gentlemen. The Baron Van Swieten.

291
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,460
- I'm a great admirer of yours. - Thank you.

292
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,900
Kapellmeister Bonno.

293
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,580
My pleasure.

294
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,420
The Director of Opera, Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

295
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,420
Sir,yes. The honor is mine, absolutely!

296
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,300
Here is our illustrious court composer...

297
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,700
...Maestro Salieri.

298
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,860
At last,such immense joy!

299
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,060
I know your work well.

300
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,860
You know,I composed some variations on a melody of yours.

301
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,020
- Really? Which one? - "Mio Caro Adone."

302
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,620
I'm flattered.

303
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,940
A funny tune, but it yielded good things.

304
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,020
And now he has returned the compliment.

305
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,820
"Herr Salieri" composed this little march for you.

306
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,300
Really?

307
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,540
Well,there it is.

308
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:41,100
Down to business. We're going to commission an opera from you.

309
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,260
What do you say?

310
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,380
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?

311
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,820
Sire,if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.

312
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,980
Did we?

313
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:02,380
I don't think it was really decided, Your Majesty.

314
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,660
- German. Please let it be German. - Why so?

315
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,100
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto.

316
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,860
Have I seen it?

317
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,140
I don't think you have,"Herr Direktor". It's quite new.

318
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,700
- I'll show it to you immediately. - I think you'd better.

319
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,620
Well...

320
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,420
...tell us about it. Tell us the story.

321
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,060
Well,it's quite amusing,Majesty.

322
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:41,580
It's set... The whole thing is set in a...

323
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,100
Yes? Where?

324
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,340
In a harem,Majesty. In a seraglio.

325
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,820
- You mean in Turkey? - Yes,exactly.

326
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,980
Then why especially does it have to be in German?

327
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,580
It doesn't,especially. It could be in Turkish if you really want.

328
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,420
No,my dear fellow,the language is not finally the point.

329
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:18,220
Do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater?

330
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,620
Why not? It's charming.

331
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:28,340
I mean,I won't actually show concubines exposing their...

332
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,980
It's not indecent. It's highly moral,Majesty.

333
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,980
It's full of proper German virtues.

334
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,540
Excuse me,Majesty,but what do you think these could be?

335
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,940
Being a foreigner,I'd love to learn.

336
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,500
Well,tell him,Mozart.

337
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,220
Name us a German virtue.

338
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,380
- Love,sire. - Oh,love!

339
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:57,740
Of course,in Italy we know nothing about love.

340
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,100
No,I don't think you do.

341
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,900
Watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching...

342
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:14,140
...stupid,fat couples rolling their eyes about. That's not love. It's rubbish!

343
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,860
Majesty,you choose the language.

344
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,620
I'll set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.

345
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:28,020
Well,there it is. Let it be German.

346
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,980
This is yours.

347
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,900
Keep it. It's already here in my head.

348
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,340
What? On one hearing only?

349
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,380
I think so,sire. Yes.

350
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,540
Show us.

351
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,220
The rest is just the same,isn't it?

352
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,900
That doesn't really work,does it?

353
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,380
Did you try...?

354
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,820
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?

355
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,740
Or this?

356
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,540
This. Yes.

357
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,700
Better? What do you think?

358
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,980
Grazie,Signore.

359
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,860
All I ever wanted was to sing to God.

360
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,860
He gave me that longing...

361
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,260
...and then made me mute. Why?

362
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,260
Tell me that.

363
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,340
If he didn't want me to praise him with music...

364
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,420
...why implant the desire...

365
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,860
...like a lust in my body?

366
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,100
And then deny me the talent?

367
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,460
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson,sir.

368
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,900
Maestro.

369
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,620
Well...?

370
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,700
How do you like it?

371
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,300
It's Turkish.

372
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:29,100
My hairdresser said everything this year's going to be Turkish.

373
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,700
Does he?

374
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,980
What else did he tell you today?

375
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,780
Come,come! Give me some gossip.

376
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,220
Well,I heard you met "Herr Mozart".

377
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,460
News travels fast in Vienna.

378
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:59,660
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?

379
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,100
- Yes. - Is there a part in it for me?

380
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,020
- No. - How do you know?

381
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,900
- Do you know where it's set,my dear? - Where?

382
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,660
In a harem.

383
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,820
- What's that? - A brothel.

384
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,580
Come.

385
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,980
Let's begin.

386
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,660
- What does he look like? - Mozart?

387
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,220
- You might be disappointed. - Why?

388
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,740
Looks and talent don't always go together,Katerina.

389
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,740
Looks don't concern me,maestro.

390
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,420
Only talent interests a woman of taste.

391
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,540
Shall we continue?

392
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,260
There she was.

393
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,900
I don't know where they met or how.  There she stood!

394
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,460
On stage,for all to see.

395
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:41,300
Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.

396
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,180
Ten minutes of ghastly scales. Arpeggios!

397
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:24,060
Whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.

398
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,420
Understand,I was in love with the girl.

399
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,620
Or at least in lust.

400
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:46,780
And I swear to you, I never laid a finger on her.

401
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,860
All the same,I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her.

402
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,540
Least of all,"the creature".

403
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:47,340
Brava,madame! You are an ornament to our stage.

404
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,380
Your Majesty.

405
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,420
Well,"Herr Mozart". A good effort.

406
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,340
Well,decidedly that.

407
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:02,860
An excellent effort! You have shown us something...

408
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,180
...quite new tonight. - It is new.

409
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,980
- It is,isn't it,sire? - Yes,indeed.

410
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,580
So then,you liked it? You really liked it,sire?

411
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,780
Well,of course I did! It's very good!

412
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:21,020
Of course,now and then, just now and then...

413
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,020
...it seemed a touch...

414
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,140
What do you mean,sire?

415
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,140
Well,I mean,occasionally, it seems to have...

416
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,340
How shall one say...?

417
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,900
How shall one say,"direktor"?

418
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,660
- Too many notes,Majesty? - Exactly. Very well put.

419
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:48,060
- Too many notes. - I don't understand.

420
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,820
There are just as many notes as I required,neither more nor less.

421
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,700
My dear fellow,there are in fact...

422
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,420
...only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.

423
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:06,820
I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I,court composer?

424
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,980
Yes. On the whole,yes,Majesty.

425
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,740
This is absurd!

426
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,220
Young man,don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious.

427
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,100
It's quality work.

428
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,980
And there are simply too many notes. Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

429
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,060
Which few did you have in mind?

430
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,860
Wolfgang!

431
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,460
Wolfgang,my dear!

432
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,580
- Wolfgang! - Majesty,this is "Frau Weber".

433
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,860
She's my landlady.

434
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:52,020
- Enchanted,madame. - Sire,such an honor!

435
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,300
This is my dear daughter,Constanze.

436
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,900
- She's the fiancée of "Herr Mozart". - Really?

437
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,500
How charming. Please.

438
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,420
Well...

439
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,500
...when do you marry?

440
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,700
We haven't exactly received my father's consent yet.

441
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:41,460
Not entirely. Not altogether.

442
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:47,700
- Excuse me,but how old are you? - 26.

443
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,260
My advice is for you to marry this charming young lady...

444
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,780
...and stay with us in Vienna. - You see?

445
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,100
I told him that, but he won't listen to me.

446
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,340
Your Majesty, you give such wonderful...

447
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:09,620
...such royal advice. May I...?

448
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,100
Well,there it is.

449
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,740
Wolfie,will you get some water?

450
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,340
Will you get some water,please?

451
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,940
Wolfie,get some water!

452
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:49,220
Excuse me. Excuse me.

453
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,100
Did you know?

454
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,180
- What? - The marriage.

455
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,820
What does it matter to you?

456
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:12,420
Nothing. He can marry who he pleases, I don't give a damn.

457
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,300
How was I?

458
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,660
You were sublime.

459
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,820
And what did you think of the music?

460
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,060
Extremely clever.

461
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,340
Katerina,I...

462
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,740
Excuse me.

463
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,500
Is that woman still lying on the floor?

464
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:40,700
- No,she's fine. - Oh,I'm so relieved.

465
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,420
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.

466
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,740
- Did you like it then? - How could I not?

467
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,540
It's the best music in Vienna today,don't you agree?

468
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,500
She must be dazzling in bed.

469
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,620
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department.

470
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:07,300
No other reason why you'd marry someone like that.

471
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,300
Come in.

472
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,340
Excuse me. Wolfie,Mom isn't feeling very well.

473
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,220
- Can we go home? - Yes.

474
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,660
No,no,no. You can't take him away now.

475
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,620
This is his night.

476
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,420
Won't you introduce us,Wolfgang?

477
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:31,900
Excuse us,"Fräulein". Good night,"signore".

478
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,980
At that moment I knew, beyond any doubt...

479
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,260
... he'd had her.

480
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:44,620
The creature had had my darling girl.

481
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,660
It was incomprehensible!

482
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,660
What was God up to?

483
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,900
Was it possible I was being tested?

484
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,700
Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness...

485
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,740
...in the face of every offense?

486
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,340
No matter how painful?

487
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,260
It's very possible.

488
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,340
But why him?

489
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:25,460
Why choose Mozart to teach me lessons in humility?

490
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,460
My heart was filling up...

491
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:32,380
...with such hatred for that little man.

492
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:36,020
For the first time in my life, I began to know...

493
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,420
...really...

494
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,700
...violent thoughts.

495
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:48,100
Every day,sometimes for hours, I would pray.

496
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,820
Lord...

497
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,460
...please...

498
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,460
...send him away...

499
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,020
...back to Salzburg.

500
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,140
For his sake...

501
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,460
...as well as mine.

502
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:11,860
- No! I won't have him back. - But,Your Grace...

503
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:18,620
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled,conceited brat!

504
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,420
Yes,sir...

505
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,020
...that is the truth.

506
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:30,260
But don't blame him. The fault is mine,entirely.

507
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,860
I was too indulgent with him.

508
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,500
Please,Your Grace?

509
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,940
Give him one more chance?

510
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,660
You have leave to try.

511
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:48,020
God bless,Your Grace! I thank Your Grace.

512
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,780
I thank you!

513
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,300
I write to you with urgent news.  I'm coming to Vienna.

514
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,380
Take no further steps towards marriage until we meet.

515
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,700
As you honor the father who has devoted his life to yours...

516
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,420
... do as I bid,and await my coming.

517
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,020
I now join you in the holy bonds of matrimony.

518
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:31,020
Those whom God hath joined together...

519
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:35,860
...let no man put asunder.

520
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,220
Beloved father:

521
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:54,940
You say Vienna is the musicians' city.  To conquer here is to conquer Europe.

522
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,940
With my wife I can do it.  One day,when I'm wealthy...

523
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:04,180
... you'll live with us, and we'll be so happy.

524
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,860
Good morning. This is my niece,Princess Elizabeth.

525
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,340
Your Highness.

526
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,860
She's asked me to recommend a music instructor.

527
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,820
- I've come up with an excellent idea. - Your Majesty!

528
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,980
It would be such a tremendous honor!

529
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,740
I was thinking of "Herr Mozart". What is your view?

530
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:39,300
It's an interesting idea, Majesty,but...

531
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,380
Yes?

532
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,020
My concern is to protect you...

533
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:50,700
...from any hint of favoritism.

534
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,180
Favoritism.

535
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,020
- What is this? - What is what?

536
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:04,100
Why must I submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?

537
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,900
Because His Majesty wishes it.

538
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,500
Is the emperor angry with me?

539
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:15,140
- Quite the contrary. - Then why not appoint me to the post?

540
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,540
You are not the only composer in Vienna.

541
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,780
No. But I'm the best.

542
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,940
Mozart.

543
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:31,340
A little modesty might suit you better.

544
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,100
Who is on this committee?

545
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,940
Kapellmeister Bonno,Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.

546
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,940
Naturally,the Italians! Of course,always the Italians!

547
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,420
They're all musical idiots!

548
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:58,140
- And you want them to judge my music? - Young man...

549
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,340
...the issue is quite simple. If you want this position...

550
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:06,980
...you must submit your stuff, along with all your colleagues.

551
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,340
Must I?

552
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,300
Well,I won't.

553
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,620
How are we supposed to live?

554
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,460
Do you want me to beg on the streets?

555
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,260
Don't be stupid.

556
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,500
- All they want to see is your work. - Shit.

557
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:30,620
- What's wrong with that? - Shut up! Just shut up.

558
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:35,140
One royal pupil, and all of Vienna will come flocking.

559
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,900
They'll come anyway.

560
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,740
- No,they won't. - They love me here.

561
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:48,300
- I know how things work in this city. - You know everything,don't you?

562
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,940
- Yes? - Excuse me,sir.

563
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,100
- A lady insists on talking to you. - Who?

564
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:25,420
She didn't say, but she says it's urgent.

565
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,820
Excuse me,my dear.

566
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,340
Your Excellency.

567
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,140
How can I help you?

568
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:47,620
- Frau Mozart? - I've come on behalf of my husband.

569
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:55,020
I brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment.

570
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,780
How charming, but why did he not come himself?

571
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,340
Well,he's terribly busy,sir.

572
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,180
I understand.

573
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,300
I will look at them the moment I can.

574
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:18,900
It will be an honor. Please give him my warmest regards.

575
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:23,580
Would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?

576
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,460
- While I wait. - I'm afraid I'm not at leisure...

577
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,220
...this precise moment.

578
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:35,100
Leave them with me. I assure you,they will be safe.

579
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,820
I really cannot do that,sir.

580
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:44,100
You see,he doesn't know I'm here.

581
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,660
Then he didn't send you?

582
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:52,140
No,sir. This was my own idea.

583
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,380
- I see. - Sir,we're desperate.

584
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,700
We really need this job.

585
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,500
My husband spends far more than he can ever earn.

586
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,420
I don't mean that he's lazy,because he works all day long.

587
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:13,220
It's just that he's not practical.

588
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:19,100
Money simply slips through his fingers. It's ridiculous.

589
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,380
Let me offer you some refreshment.

590
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,500
Do you know what these are?

591
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:31,820
"Capezzoli di Venere"! Nipples of Venus.

592
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:37,020
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar. Try one. Go on,try one!

593
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:41,340
They're quite surprising.

594
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:48,140
They're wonderful!

595
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,500
Thank you very much,Your Excellency.

596
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,980
Don't keep calling me that.

597
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:58,380
Keeps me at such a distance.

598
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,740
I wasn't born a court composer,you know.

599
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,060
I'm from a small town.

600
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,980
Just like your husband.

601
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,740
Are you sure you can't...

602
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:16,580
...leave this and come back again?

603
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,700
It's very tempting,sir.

604
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,420
But it's impossible,I'm afraid.

605
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,820
He'd be frantic if he knew they were missing.

606
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,540
You see,they're all originals.

607
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:35,740
- Originals? - Yes,sir. He doesn't make copies.

608
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,660
These...

609
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,900
...are originals?

610
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,620
Astounding!

611
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:31,860
It was actually... It was beyond belief.

612
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,140
These were first and only...

613
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,540
... drafts of music.

614
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:45,940
But they showed no corrections of any kind. Not one.

615
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,460
He had simply written down music...

616
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,740
...already finished in his head.

617
01:00:53,980 --> 01:01:01,020
Page after page of it. As if he were just taking dictation.

618
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,420
And music...

619
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:13,980
...finished as no music is ever finished.

620
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:18,340
Displace one note...

621
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,260
...and there would be diminishment.

622
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:28,300
Displace one phrase,and the structure would fall.

623
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,260
It was clear to me...

624
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:37,460
... that sound I had heard in the archbishop's palace...

625
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,260
... had been no accident.

626
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:48,060
Here again was the very voice of God.

627
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,380
I was staring through the cage...

628
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:58,380
...of those meticulous ink strokes...

629
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:04,180
...at an absolute beauty.

630
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,980
Is it not good?

631
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,140
It is miraculous.

632
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:36,580
Yes,he's very proud of his work.

633
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,180
So you will help us?

634
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,700
I dine with the emperor tomorrow evening.

635
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:48,380
One word from me and the post is his.

636
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:51,660
Thank you,Your Excellency! Thank you!

637
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:55,300
Come back tonight.

638
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:59,460
- Tonight? - Alone.

639
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,300
What for?

640
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:08,700
Some service deserves service in return.

641
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:11,700
No?

642
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,340
- What do you mean? - Isn't it obvious?

643
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:19,820
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

644
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:24,300
If you wish it for your husband,come tonight.

645
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,220
I'm a married woman,sir.

646
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,420
Then don't.

647
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,980
It's up to you.

648
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:37,020
And not to be vague,that is the price.

649
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:52,500
There is no God of mercy,Father.

650
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:57,700
Just a God of torture.

651
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,220
Evening came.

652
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,500
I sat there,not knowing whether she would return or not.

653
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:16,380
I prayed as I had never prayed before.

654
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,860
Dear God...

655
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,420
... enter me now.

656
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:26,260
Fill me with one piece of true music.

657
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:31,860
One piece with your breath in it,so I know that you love me.

658
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:38,540
Show me one sign of your favor,and I will show mine to Mozart.

659
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:42,900
I will get him the royal position.

660
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,940
Enter me.

661
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,260
Please.

662
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,220
Please!

663
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:00,140
Yes?

664
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:07,140
That lady is back,sir.

665
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,820
Show her in.

666
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,860
Well?

667
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:51,540
I'm here.

668
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:57,460
My husband has gone to a concert.

669
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:02,220
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

670
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:15,180
Well,where shall we go?

671
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:19,740
Should we stay here?

672
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:22,940
Well...

673
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:29,300
Do you still want to look at these?

674
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:35,380
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

675
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:40,140
Suppose we don't,really.

676
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:39,260
Show this woman out.

677
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:02,340
Stanzi.

678
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,860
Stanzi.

679
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,620
What is it?

680
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:17,980
What's the matter? Tell me.

681
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,180
Tell me.

682
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:29,940
I love you.

683
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,460
I love you.

684
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,380
From now on,we are enemies.

685
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,220
You and I.

686
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,260
Because you choose for your instrument...

687
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:47,380
... a boastful,lustful,smutty,infantile boy...

688
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:53,900
... and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation.

689
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,260
Because you are unjust...

690
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,980
... unfair...

691
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,340
... unkind...

692
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,340
... I will block you.

693
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,940
I swear it.

694
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,660
I will hinder and harm your creature on earth...

695
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:13,340
... as far as I am able.

696
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:17,100
I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.

697
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,820
Of course not.

698
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,940
I have to tell you.

699
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:27,420
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.

700
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,500
Really?

701
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:33,740
One of my own pupils,a very young singer...

702
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,020
...Maria Theresa Paradis...

703
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:40,020
...told me she was...

704
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:43,780
Well...

705
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,940
Well,what?

706
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,580
Molested,Majesty.

707
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:54,700
Twice,in the course of the same lesson.

708
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:03,740
There is a "Herr Mozart" waiting for you in the salon.

709
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:09,260
- Whom did they choose? - Herr Zummer.

710
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,500
Herr Zummer?

711
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:15,380
But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.

712
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:22,060
No,no. He has yet to achieve mediocrity.

713
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:27,660
I can't lose this post. I simply can't.

714
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,900
Excellency,please.

715
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:34,100
Let's go to the palace. You can talk to the emperor...

716
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:38,460
...and tell him that "Herr Zummer" is an awful choice.

717
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:41,740
He could do musical harm to the princess.

718
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:48,940
Between us,no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess.

719
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,980
Look...

720
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,020
...I must have pupils.

721
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,380
Without pupils,I can't manage.

722
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:02,060
You don't mean you're living in poverty?

723
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,580
No,but I'm broke.

724
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,900
Well,how is this possible?

725
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:11,220
I hear your concerts are quite successful.

726
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:14,460
They're stupendously successful.

727
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:18,420
You can't get a seat. But no one will hire me.

728
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,420
They want to hear me play...

729
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:26,980
...but they won't let me teach their daughters,as if I was a fiend.

730
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,660
Seriously...

731
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:36,740
...is there any chance you could manage a loan?

732
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:41,180
Only for six months. Eight,at the most.

733
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:45,660
You expect your fortunes to change in six or eight months?

734
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:49,180
As a matter of fact,I do.

735
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:54,700
I am working on something that will explode like a bomb all over Europe.

736
01:11:54,940 --> 01:12:00,180
I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything.

737
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,380
You name the terms.

738
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,860
Well,how exciting.

739
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,900
Tell me more.

740
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:13,020
- It's a bit of a secret. - Come,come. I'm interested.

741
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,500
This is delicious. What is it?

742
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:19,620
It's cream cheese mixed with sugar...

743
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:24,220
...suffused with rum. Crema Mascarpone Speciale.

744
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,020
Italian.

745
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:30,740
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.

746
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,780
Two thou...

747
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:38,060
Two hundred florins. That's all I need.

748
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,660
A hundred.

749
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,500
Fifty.

750
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:49,580
What exactly are you working on?

751
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,340
Really,I can't say.

752
01:12:54,580 --> 01:13:02,300
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor,Mozart.

753
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,340
However...

754
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:13,700
...I know a distinguished gentleman I can recommend,and...

755
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:16,820
...he has a daughter.

756
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,740
Quiet! Quiet!

757
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:25,020
Herr Mozart.

758
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,940
Welcome. Pay no attention,they're impossible.

759
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:32,980
I treat them just like my own children.

760
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:37,780
Which of them do you wish me to teach?

761
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:42,260
That's funny.

762
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,260
You're a funny fellow.

763
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,980
This is the instrument. I hope it's to your satisfaction.

764
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:53,220
Of course it'll be to his satisfaction.

765
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,780
Come,we're going to listen to some music. Come!

766
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,540
Good boy.

767
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,100
Now.

768
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:12,260
Please play me something,just to give me an idea.

769
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:15,820
Anything will do.

770
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,340
Just go ahead.

771
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:21,540
Just as if we weren't here.

772
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:26,700
Part of music,getting used to an audience. Right,"Herr Mozart"?

773
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,460
Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone.

774
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,660
We're both a little shy.

775
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,140
Play.

776
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:37,540
- I said play! - Michael,please.

777
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:42,340
Perhaps if I play first,it might encourage the "Fräulein".

778
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:46,460
Why don't you let me try?

779
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,580
Stop it! Stop! He always howls when he hears music.

780
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,620
We've got to break him of that habit.

781
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:05,300
We've got to break them of their habit!

782
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,020
Play. Please.

783
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:13,100
"Herr Mozart",play. Please,I beg you.

784
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:22,620
That's it. That's it.

785
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,900
Keep playing!

786
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:36,860
Keep playing! That's it!

787
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:57,980
Mozart,that's wonderful! Wonderful!

788
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:03,060
Next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs,let me know.

789
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:08,500
Goodbye,"Fräulein". Goodbye,madam. Goodbye,sir.

790
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:07,620
Papa?

791
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:13,140
Papa!

792
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,460
Why are you here?

793
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,420
Am I not welcome?

794
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:25,820
Of course,welcome. Papa,welcome! Welcome!

795
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:49,540
You're very thin. Doesn't your wife feed you?

796
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:54,940
Of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day!

797
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,860
- Is she not here? - No,she had to help her mother.

798
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,860
She's like that.

799
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:05,700
Her mother's a very sweet woman,you'll...

800
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,780
I didn't know you were home.

801
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:20,100
Stanzi,this is my father.

802
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:25,860
We'll wait. We'll wait.

803
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:30,940
Why don't you get up now,my darling?

804
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:40,140
She's very tired,poor creature. You know me. I'm such a pig.

805
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:43,820
It's not easy cleaning up after me.

806
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,140
Don't you have a maid?

807
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:50,060
Oh. No. We could if we wanted...

808
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:54,860
...but Stanzi insists on doing everything herself.

809
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,900
How is your...

810
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,660
...financial situation?

811
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,580
Couldn't be better.

812
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:05,860
That's not what I hear.

813
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:09,020
What do you mean? It's wonderful.

814
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:13,940
Really,it's marvelous! People love me here.

815
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:17,100
They say you have debts.

816
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,180
Who?

817
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,340
Who says that?

818
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,860
That's a malicious lie!

819
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,660
Do you have pupils?

820
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,940
I don't want pupils!

821
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:33,460
They get in the way.

822
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:36,660
I have to have time for composition.

823
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,780
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.

824
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,340
That one will.

825
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:45,660
What's that?

826
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,620
It's a secret.

827
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:52,060
Secret? You don't have secrets from me.

828
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:57,700
No! Please! I don't want you to see it. I don't want anyone to see it.

829
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,940
You'll be so proud of me.

830
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:06,260
It'll be the best thing I've ever done. The best thing anyone...

831
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,340
There she is!

832
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:12,740
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Now,Papa,confess it.

833
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:18,180
- Could you want a prettier daughter? - Stop it,Wolfie!

834
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,460
I look dreadful.

835
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:23,220
Are you...

836
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,620
...expecting?

837
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:30,540
- Yes,I am. - Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.

838
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:35,140
- May I offer you some tea? - Who wants tea? Let's go out!

839
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:39,180
This calls for a feast. You don't want tea,do you?

840
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:43,660
I know! Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties,don't you?

841
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:48,740
How can you be so boring? Tea!

842
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,340
Come on,Papa. Hurry!

843
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:56,940
Here we go. Good day.

844
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:41,140
Now!

845
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:50,420
I name the penalty! I name the penalty!

846
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:53,420
And the penalty is...

847
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:59,300
- Give her a good one! - Show us your legs!

848
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:05,940
Come on,come on!

849
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:21,180
It's just a game,Papa.

850
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:35,620
Thank you.

851
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:04,540
"Herr Mozart",why don't you name your son's penalty?!

852
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:08,460
Yes,Papa. Name it.

853
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:14,140
Name it. I'll do anything you say. Anything.

854
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:18,220
I want you to come back to Salzburg with me.

855
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,980
The penalty must be performed in the room.

856
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,340
I'm tired of this game.

857
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:30,660
But my penalty! I've got to have a penalty!

858
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:37,420
I name a penalty!

859
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,420
The penalty is...

860
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,860
...you shall play our tune...

861
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:49,260
...in the manner of Johann Sebastian Bach!

862
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:19,100
- Turn him over! - Over?!

863
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:23,820
Now you play it backwards!

864
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:54,140
- Another one! Give me another one! - Play it like Gluck!

865
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:57,100
- Boring. Another! - Handel!

866
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:00,060
I don't like him! Another one!

867
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:03,020
Play Salieri.

868
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:07,060
Now that is a challenge! That is a challenge.

869
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:11,620
Please! Please!

870
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:49,020
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!

871
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:55,260
That was not Mozart laughing,Father.

872
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,100
That was God.

873
01:25:57,340 --> 01:26:03,580
That was God laughing at me through that obscene giggle.

874
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,740
Go on,"Signore". Laugh.

875
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:13,340
Show my mediocrity for all to see.

876
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:18,020
One day I will laugh at you.

877
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:22,420
Before I leave this earth...

878
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:27,020
...I will laugh at you.

879
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:50,700
- Wolfie? - What?

880
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,820
There's a young girl here to see you.

881
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,540
What does she want?

882
01:26:55,780 --> 01:27:01,500
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.

883
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:04,780
Damn.

884
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:11,020
Yes?

885
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,820
- Are you "Herr Mozart"? - That's right.

886
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:19,860
My name is Lorl,sir. I'm a maidservant.

887
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:24,020
I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.

888
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:29,420
They'll be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain...

889
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:32,020
...anonymous.

890
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:35,860
Is this your idea,Papa?

891
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,340
Mine?

892
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:42,580
- Are you playing a trick on me? - I've never seen this girl.

893
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:46,420
- Is this some kind of joke? - Not at all,sir.

894
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:49,020
Young woman,this won't do.

895
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:53,820
My son can't accept such an offer,no matter how generous...

896
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:58,500
...unless he knows who's behind it. - I can't tell you that,sir.

897
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:01,220
- This is ridiculous! - What is ridiculous?

898
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:04,140
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.

899
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,420
People send us gifts all the time.

900
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:11,380
You cannot accept her without references.

901
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,540
Well,this is none of your business.

902
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:17,500
- Whoever sent you is going to pay? - That's right.

903
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:23,100
Splendid! Now we're going to let a stranger into our house.

904
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:27,060
Who is we? Who is letting who...?

905
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:32,980
- Could you please wait outside? - Yes,ma'am.

906
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:34,500
Look,old man!

907
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:39,220
We spend a fortune on you,and all you can do is criticize.

908
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:40,700
- And now... - Stanzi!

909
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:45,420
No! It's right that he should hear! I'm sick to death of it.

910
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:49,100
We can't do anything right for you,can we?

911
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:53,140
You won't have to do anything for me ever again.

912
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:55,020
I'm leaving.

913
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:58,380
- No,Papa. - I won't stay and be a burden.

914
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,500
No one calls you that.

915
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:04,180
She does. She says I sleep all day.

916
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:06,300
And so you do!

917
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:10,660
The only time you come out is to eat.

918
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:14,740
Well,what do you expect?

919
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:20,180
Do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day?

920
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:25,180
- So now I'm a bad housekeeper! - So you are. It's a pigsty.

921
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,620
When can you start?

922
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:31,620
- Right away,ma'am. - Good.

923
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:02,740
They're out every night,sir.

924
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:05,940
Thank you,sir.

925
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:10,900
Do any pupils come to the house?

926
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,380
Not that I've seen.

927
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:17,180
Then how does he pay for all this?

928
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,740
Does he work at all?

929
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:25,860
Yes,sir. All day long. He never leaves the house till evening.

930
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,100
He just sits there,writing and writing.

931
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:32,260
Really?

932
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:36,340
What is it he's writing?

933
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:40,300
I wouldn't know that,sir.

934
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:42,300
Of course not.

935
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:44,500
You're a good girl.

936
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:47,140
You're very kind to do this.

937
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:53,580
The next time you're sure they'll be out of the house,let me know.

938
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:02,980
Thank you,sir.

939
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:44,620
I think I found out about the money,sir.

940
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:47,380
Yes? What?

941
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:52,860
He kept seven snuffboxes in here. I could swear they were all gold.

942
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,100
And now look.

943
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:58,300
There's only one left.

944
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:02,220
Where does he work?

945
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:06,260
In there,sir.

946
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:53,780
Gentlemen,I've just heard some news...

947
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:57,020
...that may interest you. - What?

948
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:01,900
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.

949
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,820
Italian?

950
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:09,700
That's not all. He has chosen for his subject,Figaro.

951
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:12,700
The Marriage of Figaro.

952
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:16,700
He's setting that play to music?

953
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:19,180
Yes.

954
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,860
What is this "Marriage of Figaro"?

955
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:26,540
It's a French play,Kapellmeister.

956
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:29,940
It has been banned by the emperor.

957
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:33,780
You're absolutely sure?

958
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:38,860
Herr Mozart.

959
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:42,780
Gentlemen,sit down.

960
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,700
Mozart.

961
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:53,180
Are you aware that I have declared the French play "Figaro"...

962
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:57,220
...unsuitable for our theater?

963
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:59,220
Yes,sire.

964
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:06,180
Yet we hear you're making an opera from it. Is this true?

965
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,460
Who told you this,Majesty?

966
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:15,340
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?

967
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:17,740
Yes,I...

968
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:21,820
I admit it is.

969
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:26,460
Would you tell me why?

970
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,380
Majesty,it is only a comedy.

971
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:32,380
What you think is scarcely the point.

972
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:36,460
It's what His Majesty thinks that counts.

973
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,740
But,Your Majesty...

974
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:40,820
Mozart...

975
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,220
...I am a tolerant man.

976
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:49,020
I do not censor things lightly. When I do,I have good reason.

977
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:52,660
"Figaro" is a bad play.

978
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:55,580
It stirs up hatred between classes.

979
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:58,820
In France,it has caused only bitterness.

980
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:04,380
My sister Antoinette is beginning to be frightened of her own people.

981
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:08,180
I swear,there's nothing like that in the piece.

982
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:13,300
I've taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.

983
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:16,060
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.

984
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:21,380
In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our people...

985
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:23,940
...simply over a theater piece.

986
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:29,180
Majesty,this is just a frolic. A piece about love.

987
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,580
"Love". Again!

988
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,460
And it's new!

989
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:37,700
It's entirely new. The people will go mad for it.

990
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:40,700
I have scenes...

991
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:43,420
The end of Act Il,for example.

992
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:47,620
It starts as a duet. A husband and wife quarreling.

993
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:52,980
Suddenly,the scheming maid comes in. It's a very funny situation.

994
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,020
Duet turns into trio.

995
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:58,100
Then the husband's valet comes in.

996
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:00,100
Trio turns into quartet.

997
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:03,260
Then a gardener. Quartet becomes quintet.

998
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,460
And so on,on and on.

999
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,260
Sextet,septet,octet.

1000
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:12,820
How long do you think I can sustain that?

1001
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,500
I have no idea.

1002
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:16,820
Guess.

1003
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,500
Guess,Your Majesty.

1004
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:24,340
Imagine the longest time it could be sustained,then double it.

1005
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:26,980
Well...

1006
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:29,780
Six...

1007
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:33,820
...seven minutes?

1008
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:39,380
- Eight minutes? - Twenty,sire. Twenty minutes!

1009
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:44,180
Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives!

1010
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:46,780
Sire,only opera can do this.

1011
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:50,900
In a play,if more than one person speaks at once...

1012
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:53,060
...it's just noise.

1013
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,820
But with opera,with music...

1014
01:37:56,060 --> 01:38:00,180
...you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time.

1015
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:03,620
It's not noise. It's a perfect harmony!

1016
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:06,940
Mozart,music is not the issue here.

1017
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:12,460
No one doubts your talent. It's your literary judgment that's in question.

1018
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:18,700
Even with the politics taken out,it would still remain a vulgar farce.

1019
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:21,740
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

1020
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:26,020
Surely you can choose more elevated themes.

1021
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:29,380
Elevated! What does that mean,elevated?

1022
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:33,340
I am fed to the teeth with these...

1023
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:36,820
...elevated things. Old dead legends.

1024
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:41,140
Why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?

1025
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:43,660
Because they do.

1026
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:46,900
They go on forever.

1027
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:51,060
At least what they represent: the eternal in us.

1028
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:54,060
Opera is here to ennoble us,Mozart.

1029
01:38:54,300 --> 01:39:00,380
You and me,just the same as His Majesty.

1030
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:06,380
"Bello,bello,bello." Come on now,be honest!

1031
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:12,260
You'd rather listen to your hairdresser than Hercules,Horatius or Orpheus.

1032
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:17,100
People so lofty,they sound as if they shit marble!

1033
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:19,180
What!

1034
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:25,020
Govern your tongue,Mozart! How dare you!

1035
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:31,740
Forgive me,Majesty.

1036
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:34,380
I'm a vulgar man...

1037
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:39,380
...but I assure you,my music is not.

1038
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:44,620
You are passionate,Mozart...

1039
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:50,380
...but you do not persuade.

1040
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:55,180
Sire,the whole opera is finished.

1041
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:58,740
Do you know how much work went into it?

1042
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:05,220
His Majesty has been more than patient,"Signore".

1043
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,700
How can I persuade if I can't show it?

1044
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:13,540
That will do,"Herr Mozart".

1045
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:16,700
Just let me tell you how it begins.

1046
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:22,380
May I just do that,Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?

1047
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:28,460
Please.

1048
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:30,540
Look...

1049
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:34,220
There's a servant on his knees. Do you know why?

1050
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:37,860
Not from oppression. He's measuring a space.

1051
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,100
Do you know what for?

1052
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:43,020
His bed. His wedding bed.

1053
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:47,100
To see if it will fit!

1054
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:57,380
Late.

1055
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,540
Late!

1056
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:01,380
On the beat.

1057
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:04,820
Good!

1058
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:08,540
Yes!

1059
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:16,700
Early!

1060
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:24,700
Well,Mozart is already rehearsing.

1061
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:33,020
In that case,gentlemen,I think...

1062
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:40,340
I think we should help Mozart all we can.

1063
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:45,260
And protect him against the emperor's anger.

1064
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,340
What anger?

1065
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:50,300
About the ballet.

1066
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:53,100
What ballet?

1067
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,500
Excuse me...

1068
01:41:55,780 --> 01:42:02,540
...but didn't His Majesty specifically forbid the ballet in his opera?

1069
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,340
- Herr Mozart! - Yes?

1070
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:43,700
- A word with you. - Certainly,"Herr Direktor".

1071
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:46,540
Now,"Herr Mozart"!

1072
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,580
Five minutes,please.

1073
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:51,740
Five minutes!

1074
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,020
Yes?

1075
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:58,980
Do you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?

1076
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:04,140
- It's not a ballet,it's a dance. - Exactly. A dance.

1077
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:09,020
Surely,His Majesty didn't mean no dancing when it's in the story.

1078
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:16,260
It's dangerous to interpret his edicts. Give me your score,please.

1079
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:26,860
Thank you.

1080
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:31,460
What are you doing,"Herr Direktor"?

1081
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:36,180
Taking out what you should never have put in.

1082
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,300
Please. Please!

1083
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,940
I have no one else to turn to.

1084
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:44,820
- What is it? - It's unbelievable.

1085
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:49,220
The "direktor" has torn up a huge section of my music.

1086
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:53,060
They say I have to rewrite the opera.

1087
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:55,740
But it's perfect as it is.

1088
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,220
I can't...

1089
01:43:57,460 --> 01:44:01,580
...rewrite what's perfect.

1090
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,180
Please.

1091
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:06,060
Can't you talk to him?

1092
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:07,540
Please.

1093
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:10,540
Why bother? He's no friend of yours.

1094
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:16,020
I could kill him! I mean,really! Kill him!

1095
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:20,580
I threw the entire score into the fire,he made me so angry.

1096
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:27,660
- You burned the score? - No,my wife took it out in time.

1097
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:30,620
Thank God.

1098
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:36,940
It's unfair that a man like that should have power over our work!

1099
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:42,100
But there are those who have power over him.

1100
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:47,140
I think I'll take this up with the emperor.

1101
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:48,980
Excellency...

1102
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:52,020
...would you?

1103
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:55,860
With all my heart,Mozart.

1104
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:58,580
Thank you.

1105
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:05,340
Please,"Herr Mozart". "Please,it's not a holy relic."

1106
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:10,700
I don't need to tell you I said nothing,whatever,to the emperor.

1107
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:16,940
I went to the theater to tell Mozart something,anything...

1108
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:21,860
... when suddenly,in the middle of the third act...

1109
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:25,220
... to my astonishment,the emperor...

1110
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:31,620
... who never attended rehearsals,suddenly appeared.

1111
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:52,420
What is this?

1112
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:56,100
I don't understand.

1113
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:58,540
Is it modern?

1114
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:00,500
Majesty...

1115
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:02,420
...the "Herr Direktor"...

1116
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:05,540
...he has removed "un balletto"...

1117
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:11,020
...that would have occurred at this place.

1118
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:12,780
Why?

1119
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:15,140
It is your regulation,sire.

1120
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:19,980
No ballet in your opera.

1121
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:27,060
Salieri.

1122
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,580
Do you like this?

1123
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:35,220
It's not a question of liking,Majesty.

1124
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:40,060
Your own law decrees it,I'm afraid.

1125
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:44,060
Well,look at them!

1126
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:47,820
No! This is nonsense!

1127
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:52,060
- Let me see the scene with the music. - But,sire!

1128
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:53,740
Oblige me!

1129
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:57,580
Yes,Majesty.

1130
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:08,340
Can we see the scene with the music,please?

1131
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:13,460
Certainly! Certainly,"Herr Direktor"!

1132
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:21,780
Bring the palace set back in,please.

1133
01:47:58,340 --> 01:48:00,020
The restored third act...

1134
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:03,260
...was bold,brilliant.

1135
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:07,060
The fourth...

1136
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:11,460
...was astounding.

1137
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:19,380
I saw a woman...

1138
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:25,420
... disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first...

1139
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:29,020
... tender words he has offered her in years.

1140
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:34,420
Simply because he thinks she is someone else.

1141
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:40,100
I heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theater...

1142
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:45,340
... conferring on all who sat there,perfect absolution.

1143
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:48,700
God was singing through this little man...

1144
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:51,900
... to all the world.

1145
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:54,060
Unstoppable.

1146
01:48:54,300 --> 01:49:01,260
Making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.

1147
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:42,220
And then,do you know what happened?

1148
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:46,980
A miracle!

1149
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:54,060
With that yawn...

1150
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:59,820
... I saw my defeat turn into a victory.

1151
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:05,820
Mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once.

1152
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,500
Three yawns...

1153
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:10,740
...and the opera would fail the same night.

1154
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:14,300
Two yawns,within a week at most.

1155
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:21,060
With one yawn,the composer could still get...

1156
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:25,980
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had! Withdrawn!

1157
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:28,540
I know,I know.

1158
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:32,060
It's outrageous.

1159
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,980
Still,if the public doesn't like one's work...

1160
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:38,740
...one has to accept the fact gracefully.

1161
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:42,340
But what is it that they don't like?

1162
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:44,900
I can speak for the emperor.

1163
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:48,340
You make too many demands on the royal ear.

1164
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:55,460
The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour. You gave him four.

1165
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:02,020
What did you think of it yourself?

1166
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:06,300
Did you like it at all?

1167
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:08,940
I thought it was marvelous.

1168
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:12,900
Of course. It's the best opera yet written.

1169
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:16,300
I know it!

1170
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:20,900
Why didn't they come?

1171
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:25,860
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese,friend.

1172
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:29,580
You didn't give them a bang at the end of songs...

1173
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:32,780
...to let them know when to clap.

1174
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:35,460
I know,I know.

1175
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:39,980
Maybe you should give me some lessons in that.

1176
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:44,260
I wouldn't presume.

1177
01:51:45,860 --> 01:51:48,860
Nevertheless,at the risk of imposing...

1178
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:53,140
...I'd like you to see my new piece.

1179
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:55,540
It would be an honor for me.

1180
01:51:55,780 --> 01:51:59,980
No,the honor would be all mine.

1181
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:27,420
I believe...

1182
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:29,420
I believe...

1183
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:35,180
...it is the best opera yet written,my friends.

1184
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:38,500
Salieri!

1185
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:42,780
You are the brightest star in the musical firmament.

1186
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:48,060
You do honor to Vienna and to me.

1187
01:54:13,140 --> 01:54:15,140
"Herr Mozart"!

1188
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:18,540
- It was good of you to come. - How could I not?

1189
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:21,660
Bravo,maestro.

1190
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:25,940
Did my work please you?

1191
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:31,100
I never knew that music like that was possible.

1192
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:34,740
- You flatter me. - No.

1193
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:37,300
One hears such sounds...

1194
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:42,540
...and what can one say but: Salieri!

1195
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:53,900
Everybody's here and we've got guests. Bravo! Well,I've got some more.

1196
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:57,860
You remember my good friend Schikaneder. Come in.

1197
01:54:58,140 --> 01:54:59,380
Don't be shy.

1198
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:04,580
- This is a very nice girl,and this... - Wolfie?

1199
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:07,100
Yes,my love?

1200
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:11,940
- These gentlemen are from Salzburg. - Salzburg?

1201
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:16,580
We were just talking about Salzburg.

1202
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:21,420
Your father is dead.

1203
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:44,900
So rose the dreadful ghost...

1204
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:51,020
...from his next and blackest opera.

1205
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:59,100
There on the stage,stood the figure of a dead commander.

1206
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:00,900
I knew...

1207
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:02,860
...only I understood...

1208
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:06,420
...that the horrifying apparition was Leopold...

1209
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:09,860
...raised from the dead!

1210
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:41,940
Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father...

1211
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:47,020
...to accuse his son before all the world!

1212
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:49,100
It was...

1213
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:54,300
...terrifying and wonderful to watch.

1214
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:59,900
And now...

1215
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:08,500
...the madness began in me.

1216
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:14,300
The madness of a man splitting in half.

1217
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:18,940
Through my influence,I saw to it...

1218
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:23,020
... "Don Giovanni" was played only five times in Vienna.

1219
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:27,860
But,in secret,I went to every one of those five.

1220
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:34,580
Worshiping sound I alone seemed to hear.

1221
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:23,100
And as I stood there,understanding how...

1222
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:26,900
...that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son...

1223
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:29,820
... even from beyond the grave...

1224
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:31,980
... I began to see a way...

1225
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:33,980
... a terrible way...

1226
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:37,140
...I could finally triumph...

1227
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:40,740
...over God.

1228
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:52,500
"Herr Mozart"?

1229
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:58,180
I have come to commission work from you.

1230
02:02:58,420 --> 02:03:02,740
- What work? - A Mass for the dead.

1231
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:05,140
What dead?

1232
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:07,420
Who is dead?

1233
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:12,300
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.

1234
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:16,060
- Who are you? - I am only a messenger.

1235
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:18,580
Do you accept?

1236
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:22,780
You will be well paid.

1237
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:32,580
Do you accept?

1238
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:43,060
Work fast.

1239
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:46,020
And be sure tell no one what you do.

1240
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:50,300
You will see me again soon.

1241
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:28,220
Wolfie?

1242
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:41,460
My plan was so simple...

1243
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:45,780
...that it terrified me.

1244
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:51,820
First,I must get the death Mass,and then...

1245
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:56,540
...I must achieve his death.

1246
02:04:56,780 --> 02:04:58,980
What?

1247
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:01,940
His funeral!

1248
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:03,460
Imagine it!

1249
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:06,780
The cathedral,all Vienna sitting there.

1250
02:05:07,060 --> 02:05:12,820
His coffin. Mozart's little coffin in the middle.

1251
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:15,180
And then...

1252
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:19,220
...in that silence...

1253
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:22,860
...music.

1254
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:25,340
A divine music...

1255
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:28,900
...bursts out over them all.

1256
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:33,900
A great Mass of death.

1257
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:38,060
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.

1258
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:42,740
Composed by his devoted friend...

1259
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:46,460
...Antonio Salieri.

1260
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:48,380
What sublimity!

1261
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:51,180
What depth!

1262
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:54,980
What passion in the music!

1263
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:59,100
Salieri has been touched by God at last...

1264
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:03,180
...and God forced to listen!

1265
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:06,940
Powerless to stop it!

1266
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:12,180
I,for once,in the end,laughing at him!

1267
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:22,340
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing.

1268
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:25,460
How does one do that?

1269
02:06:25,700 --> 02:06:29,460
How does one kill a man?

1270
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:31,660
It's one thing...

1271
02:06:31,940 --> 02:06:34,260
...to dream about it.

1272
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:39,300
Very different when you...

1273
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:44,020
When you have to do it...

1274
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:49,020
...with your own hands.

1275
02:06:56,980 --> 02:07:01,340
Come in!

1276
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:19,860
I've come to dinner

1277
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:22,860
Dinner! Are you mad? I'm a nobleman!

1278
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:26,500
I only ever dine with people of my own height!

1279
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:28,980
Stop it!

1280
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:31,300
Be careful Be careful

1281
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:34,700
Hold tight

1282
02:07:34,940 --> 02:07:37,140
I'm a famous...

1283
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:40,140
... horseman

1284
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:46,260
And we're a famous horsy

1285
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:50,660
Give me a hoof,my darling

1286
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:56,060
And I'll give you my heart

1287
02:07:56,300 --> 02:08:00,780
Take me to your stable

1288
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:05,860
And never more we'll part

1289
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:15,980
Kill me Kill me

1290
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:40,540
We're going to make a soprano stew

1291
02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:45,420
We're going to make a soprano stew

1292
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:49,380
And when you make a soprano stew

1293
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:51,460
Shut up!

1294
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:55,980
I'm sick to death of that tune!

1295
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:16,980
Give me some hay,my darling

1296
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:20,700
And I'll give you my heart

1297
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:24,740
Leporello! Some hay!

1298
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:16,100
We hope...

1299
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:21,580
... you're contented

1300
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:24,420
With what...

1301
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:29,420
... we've presented

1302
02:10:29,660 --> 02:10:37,860
And love our dove of peace

1303
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:04,220
- What did you think? - It was wonderful!

1304
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:09,620
- He liked the little people. - It's all in good fun.

1305
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:13,660
I liked the horse.

1306
02:11:23,060 --> 02:11:26,900
I tell you,if you played "Don Giovanni" here...

1307
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:30,060
...you would've had a wonderful success.

1308
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:32,020
You belong here.

1309
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:36,420
Not at the snobby court. You could do anything you like.

1310
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:41,460
The more fantastic,the better. That's what people want: fantasy.

1311
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:44,860
You write a proper part for me...

1312
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:47,380
...a couple of catchy songs...

1313
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:52,380
...I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!

1314
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:58,300
- What do you say? - How much will you pay him?

1315
02:11:58,660 --> 02:12:03,780
Well! I see you brought your manager with you.

1316
02:12:04,140 --> 02:12:06,220
Well,madame...

1317
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:09,820
...how about half the receipts?

1318
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:11,580
Half the receipts!

1319
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:14,140
- Stanzi! - I'm talking about now.

1320
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:17,820
How much will you pay him now? Down payment.

1321
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:20,900
Down payment?

1322
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:25,380
Who do you think I am,the emperor?

1323
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:27,140
I have to go.

1324
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:32,060
Stay here,you'll enjoy this next one.

1325
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:33,420
You won't do this.

1326
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:35,980
- Why not? Half the house! - When?

1327
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:40,260
We need money now! He pays you now,or you don't do it.

1328
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:42,100
I don't trust that man.

1329
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:45,940
I don't like what he did with your opera. It was common.

1330
02:12:46,180 --> 02:12:49,140
You liked it. Monkey,punky,flunky!

1331
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:50,900
Half the house.

1332
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:55,180
You'll never see a penny. I want it here in my hand.

1333
02:12:55,420 --> 02:12:59,060
- I'll put it here in your hand. - Shut up!

1334
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:04,260
You won't put a thing in my hand until I see some money!

1335
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:09,540
It's embarrassing. Can't you think of anyone who can do something for him?

1336
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:14,020
I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause,baron.

1337
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:18,500
He has succeeded in alienating practically the whole of Vienna.

1338
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:20,580
He never pays his debts.

1339
02:13:20,820 --> 02:13:24,820
I can't think of anyone to whom I'd dare recommend him.

1340
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:30,220
"Herr Mozart". What a surprise!

1341
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:33,860
What can I do for you?

1342
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:40,140
Is my pupil still interested in learning the art of music?

1343
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:45,300
Your pupil is married and living in Mannheim,young man.

1344
02:13:45,580 --> 02:13:48,820
Really?

1345
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:58,620
Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction.

1346
02:13:58,860 --> 02:14:01,100
What is it,Mozart?

1347
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:04,020
What's the matter with you?

1348
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:05,740
Well...

1349
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:10,780
...since it appears no one is eager to hire my services...

1350
02:14:11,060 --> 02:14:16,340
...could you favor me with a little money instead?

1351
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:20,820
What for?

1352
02:14:20,860 --> 02:14:26,580
If a man cannot earn,he must borrow.

1353
02:14:28,420 --> 02:14:32,140
That's hardly the way to go about it.

1354
02:14:32,420 --> 02:14:35,740
You are right,sir. You are right.

1355
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:40,420
But you see,I am endowed with talent,and you with money.

1356
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:42,540
If I offer mine...

1357
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:47,020
...you should offer yours.

1358
02:14:48,620 --> 02:14:52,340
I'm sorry,no.

1359
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:56,820
Please.

1360
02:14:57,140 --> 02:15:01,260
My answer is no,Mozart.

1361
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:09,340
Please.

1362
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:15,780
Please!

1363
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:54,780
Don't answer it.

1364
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:58,340
Why?

1365
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:01,580
Tell him...

1366
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:04,220
Tell him I'm not here.

1367
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:07,100
Tell him...

1368
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:10,660
Tell him I'm working on it.

1369
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:14,580
Come back later.

1370
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:32,140
- Am I interrupting something? - No.

1371
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:35,180
Good. Where's our friend?

1372
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:37,700
He's not here.

1373
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:42,100
But he's working on it,he told me to tell you.

1374
02:16:42,340 --> 02:16:45,860
Is that it?

1375
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:54,220
Is he happy with it?

1376
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:58,620
What's this? A Requiem Mass?

1377
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:03,060
- You think I'm in the funeral business? - Leave that alone!

1378
02:17:03,300 --> 02:17:07,820
- Put it down! It's nothing for you! - I'm sorry.

1379
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:10,820
What have you got for me?

1380
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:13,820
Finished?

1381
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:19,020
- What? - The vaudeville,what do you think?

1382
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:20,940
Yes.

1383
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:24,580
- Can I see it? - No.

1384
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:26,540
Why not?

1385
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:30,940
Because there's nothing to see.

1386
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:40,020
Look...

1387
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:47,300
...I asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes.

1388
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:52,460
- Well,we can. - So let me see it. Where is it?

1389
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:55,060
Here.

1390
02:17:55,300 --> 02:18:00,820
It's all right here in my noodle. The rest is just scribbling.

1391
02:18:01,060 --> 02:18:06,340
Scribbling and bibbling. Bibbling and scribbling.

1392
02:18:07,820 --> 02:18:10,340
- Like a drink? - Look,you little cunt!

1393
02:18:10,580 --> 02:18:13,180
Do you know how many people I've hired?

1394
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:15,900
- Leave him alone! - I'm paying them!

1395
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:20,420
- He's doing his best. - Paying them to wait. It's ridiculous!

1396
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:24,140
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto!

1397
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:27,500
Only an idiot would ask him to work on that!

1398
02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:30,260
Twelve-foot snakes,magic flutes?

1399
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:33,340
What's so intelligent about a Requiem?

1400
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:38,060
Money. Money.

1401
02:18:39,460 --> 02:18:41,620
You're mad.

1402
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:43,500
She's mad.

1403
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:47,860
- Oh,yes? - Wolfie,write it down.

1404
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:49,980
Just write it down.

1405
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:52,300
On paper.

1406
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:55,660
It's no use to anybody in your head.

1407
02:18:55,900 --> 02:19:00,220
To hell with your death Mass!

1408
02:19:00,460 --> 02:19:03,220
Calm yourself. What's the matter with you?

1409
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:07,780
- I won't work there anymore. - What happened?

1410
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:11,020
You don't know what it's like.

1411
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:14,260
"Herr Mozart" frightens me.

1412
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:16,260
He drinks all day...

1413
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:20,180
...then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.

1414
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:23,460
Is he working?

1415
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:26,780
Oh,I am frightened,sir,really!

1416
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:33,460
- When he speaks,he makes no sense. - Is he working?

1417
02:19:33,820 --> 02:19:36,380
I suppose so.

1418
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:41,260
He sits there all the time,doing some silly opera.

1419
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:44,620
- Opera? - Don't ask me to go back again.

1420
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:48,100
I'm frightened. I'm very,very frightened!

1421
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:53,060
Are you sure it's an opera?

1422
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:37,940
I don't have it yet.

1423
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:41,740
Are you neglecting my request?

1424
02:21:42,020 --> 02:21:45,700
No. No,I...

1425
02:21:45,980 --> 02:21:48,220
I promise you...

1426
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:54,020
...I'll give you a wonderful piece,the best I ever...

1427
02:21:56,220 --> 02:21:59,860
This is my wife,Stanzi.

1428
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:03,660
I've been sick,but I'm all right now,aren't I?

1429
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:05,980
Yes,sir. He's all right.

1430
02:22:06,220 --> 02:22:10,340
And he's working on it very hard.

1431
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:14,180
Give me two more weeks. Please.

1432
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:18,740
The sooner you finish,the greater your reward.

1433
02:22:18,980 --> 02:22:22,580
Work.

1434
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:33,020
Wolfie.

1435
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:38,420
I think you really are going mad.

1436
02:22:38,420 --> 02:22:42,980
You slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny!

1437
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:45,980
And here,this is not a ghost!

1438
02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:51,780
This is a real man,who puts down real money.

1439
02:22:52,220 --> 02:22:55,940
Why on earth won't you finish it?

1440
02:22:56,180 --> 02:23:01,580
Can you give me one reason I can understand?

1441
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:05,740
It's killing me.

1442
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:10,380
You're drunk,aren't you?

1443
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:15,220
Be honest,tell me. You've been drinking.

1444
02:23:16,460 --> 02:23:21,420
It's not fair. I worry about you all the time.

1445
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:25,020
I do everything I can to help you.

1446
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:29,620
And all you do is drink and talk nonsense,and frighten me.

1447
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:33,900
Go back to bed!

1448
02:23:41,620 --> 02:23:44,100
Please.

1449
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:49,740
Let me... Let me sit here.

1450
02:23:51,220 --> 02:23:54,860
Let me stay here with you.

1451
02:26:26,900 --> 02:26:29,660
I did it. And I was proud to do it.

1452
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:33,820
"Leave!" I said. "Right away. Take the child with you!"

1453
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:38,540
"Go to the spa and get your health back." I was shocked.

1454
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:41,540
Shocked to my foundation when I saw her.

1455
02:26:41,820 --> 02:26:45,100
I couldn't believe my eyes,poor little thing.

1456
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:48,780
You monster! No one exists but you,do they?

1457
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:51,660
You and your music. I warned her.

1458
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:54,660
"Choose a man,not a baby",I said.

1459
02:26:54,940 --> 02:27:00,060
"You marry him,you won't have a pot to piss in." You selfish thing!

1460
02:27:00,300 --> 02:27:06,820
Selfish,that's what you are. Simply selfish! Do you hear me?

1461
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:49,580
Pick him up.

1462
02:30:49,820 --> 02:30:53,100
Pick him up!

1463
02:30:53,540 --> 02:30:55,980
Be careful. Come with me.

1464
02:30:56,220 --> 02:30:59,540
You,follow me.

1465
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:30,500
- Is it over? - Yes,it's over. It's over.

1466
02:31:30,740 --> 02:31:33,740
Go!

1467
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:16,580
Go,go. Go.

1468
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:20,260
Go! Go!

1469
02:32:47,620 --> 02:32:51,100
Where is your wife?

1470
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:56,740
Where is your wife?

1471
02:32:57,540 --> 02:33:02,860
She's not well either. She went to the spa.

1472
02:33:03,100 --> 02:33:05,660
You are so good to me.

1473
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:09,180
Truly. Thank you.

1474
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:11,740
Please!

1475
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:15,980
No,I mean to come to my opera.

1476
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:22,780
You. You are the only colleague of mine who came.

1477
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:26,940
Mozart.

1478
02:33:27,180 --> 02:33:31,260
I would never miss anything you had written.

1479
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:34,860
- It's just a vaudeville. - No,no!

1480
02:33:35,140 --> 02:33:38,100
It's a sublime piece.

1481
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:42,020
The grandest "operone"!

1482
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:51,620
I tell you...

1483
02:33:51,860 --> 02:33:57,340
...you are the greatest composer known to me.

1484
02:33:59,860 --> 02:34:02,700
Do you mean it?

1485
02:34:07,180 --> 02:34:09,420
- It's him! - Who?

1486
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:11,580
The man.

1487
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:15,180
He's here.

1488
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:18,660
Tell him to go away.

1489
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:23,820
Tell him I'm still working on it. Don't let him in.

1490
02:34:24,060 --> 02:34:26,260
No,no. Wait!

1491
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:30,460
Ask him if he would give me some money now.

1492
02:34:30,740 --> 02:34:35,820
Tell him if he would,it will help me to finish it.

1493
02:34:53,180 --> 02:34:57,100
- Salieri? - Yes.

1494
02:34:57,420 --> 02:35:01,900
- Can we come in? - Better not. He's sleeping.

1495
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:06,020
- He's all right,though? - Yes,he's just exhausted.

1496
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:09,340
He became dizzy,that's all.

1497
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:14,300
- Well,tell him we came by,won't you? - Of course.

1498
02:35:14,580 --> 02:35:18,340
Give him this. That's his share.

1499
02:35:18,620 --> 02:35:21,260
- That should cheer him up. - Indeed!

1500
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:24,900
And now,good night to you all. It was...

1501
02:35:25,140 --> 02:35:27,020
...perfection,truly.

1502
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:30,300
Thank you.

1503
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:42,700
What happened?

1504
02:35:49,580 --> 02:35:52,900
He said to give you this.

1505
02:35:53,140 --> 02:35:57,100
And if you finish by tomorrow night...

1506
02:35:57,340 --> 02:36:00,780
...he will pay you another hundred ducats.

1507
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:03,140
Another...?

1508
02:36:03,420 --> 02:36:07,980
That's too soon. Tomorrow night...

1509
02:36:08,180 --> 02:36:11,700
It's impossible.

1510
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:18,100
- Did he say a hundred? - Yes.

1511
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:25,660
It's too soon.

1512
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:28,300
Can I...?

1513
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:32,140
Could I help you?

1514
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:36,580
Would you?

1515
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:41,780
Actually,you could.

1516
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:50,500
- I want to go. - Where?

1517
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:53,940
- I want to go back to Vienna. - Now?

1518
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:57,340
- Yes. - Why?

1519
02:36:58,180 --> 02:37:01,500
I feel wrong.

1520
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:05,540
I feel wrong being here.

1521
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:10,460
- Where did I stop? - The end of the "Recordare".

1522
02:37:10,740 --> 02:37:13,900
So now "Confutatis"...

1523
02:37:19,220 --> 02:37:21,580
How would you translate that?

1524
02:37:21,820 --> 02:37:26,180
"Consigned to flames of woe."

1525
02:37:26,820 --> 02:37:30,540
- Do you believe in it? - What?

1526
02:37:30,780 --> 02:37:35,940
A fire which never dies,burning you forever.

1527
02:37:36,180 --> 02:37:38,980
Oh,yes.

1528
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:42,340
Possible.

1529
02:37:42,500 --> 02:37:46,300
- Come,let's begin. - We ended in F major.

1530
02:37:46,540 --> 02:37:51,420
- Yes. - So,now,A minor.

1531
02:37:57,660 --> 02:38:02,260
- A minor. - Yes.

1532
02:38:03,580 --> 02:38:08,100
"Confutatis". A minor.

1533
02:38:08,860 --> 02:38:10,740
Start with the voices.

1534
02:38:10,980 --> 02:38:14,260
- Basses first. Second beat of the... - Time?

1535
02:38:14,500 --> 02:38:19,180
Common time. Second beat of the first measure.

1536
02:38:19,460 --> 02:38:22,940
On A.

1537
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:26,060
Second measure,second beat.

1538
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:27,500
You see?

1539
02:38:27,740 --> 02:38:29,500
- Yes. G-sharp? - Of course.

1540
02:38:29,740 --> 02:38:34,580
Second beat of the third measure,on E.

1541
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:43,900
Do you have me? Show me.

1542
02:39:02,140 --> 02:39:04,660
Good. Good.

1543
02:39:04,900 --> 02:39:06,460
Now the tenors.

1544
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:11,500
Fourth beat of the first measure,on C.

1545
02:39:12,060 --> 02:39:17,020
Second measure,fourth beat. D.

1546
02:39:17,780 --> 02:39:20,020
- All right? - Yes,continue.

1547
02:39:20,260 --> 02:39:25,060
Second beat of the fourth measure,on F.

1548
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:34,300
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon,bass trombones,basses.

1549
02:39:34,540 --> 02:39:38,620
Identical notes and rhythm.

1550
02:39:40,180 --> 02:39:45,900
First bassoon,tenor trombones,with the tenors.

1551
02:39:49,300 --> 02:39:53,020
- You go too fast. - Do you have it?

1552
02:39:53,260 --> 02:39:56,420
- Bassoon to trombone what? - With the tenors.

1553
02:39:56,660 --> 02:40:00,060
- Identical? - The instruments doubling the voices.

1554
02:40:00,300 --> 02:40:03,940
Trumpets and timpani. Trumpets in D. Listen.

1555
02:40:04,180 --> 02:40:06,620
- I don't understand! - Listen!

1556
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:12,060
Trumpets in D,tonic and dominant,first and third beats.

1557
02:40:12,300 --> 02:40:15,860
It goes with the harmony!

1558
02:40:20,780 --> 02:40:24,700
Yes. Yes,yes!

1559
02:40:32,300 --> 02:40:34,620
I understand. And that's all?

1560
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:38,220
No,now for the real fire. Strings in unison.

1561
02:40:38,460 --> 02:40:42,780
Ostinato,on A. Like this:

1562
02:40:44,020 --> 02:40:47,580
Next measure is rising.

1563
02:40:47,860 --> 02:40:51,740
Do you have it? Show me.

1564
02:40:57,820 --> 02:41:02,460
- It's wonderful! - Yes,yes. Go on.

1565
02:41:07,660 --> 02:41:11,180
- Write that down! - Yes,yes.

1566
02:41:13,820 --> 02:41:16,700
"Call me among the blessed."

1567
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:18,540
C major.

1568
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:25,020
Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C,sopranos above.

1569
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:38,940
Sopranos up to F on the second "voca"?

1570
02:41:39,180 --> 02:41:45,180
And on "dictus". And underneath,just violins. Arpeggios.

1571
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:48,740
Scale in eighth notes,then back to ostinato.

1572
02:41:48,980 --> 02:41:51,140
- Do you have it? - You go too fast.

1573
02:41:51,380 --> 02:41:56,180
- Do you have it? - One moment,please!

1574
02:41:58,580 --> 02:42:03,980
Good. Show me the whole thing from the beginning.

1575
02:44:05,700 --> 02:44:08,300
Do you want to rest a bit?

1576
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:12,260
No,I'm not tired at all.

1577
02:44:16,620 --> 02:44:19,300
We'll stop for a moment.

1578
02:44:19,580 --> 02:44:24,620
- Then we'll finish the "Lacrimosa". - I can keep going. I assure you.

1579
02:44:24,860 --> 02:44:29,660
Will you stay with me while I sleep a little?

1580
02:44:29,900 --> 02:44:33,700
I'm not leaving you.

1581
02:44:39,620 --> 02:44:43,020
I'm so ashamed.

1582
02:44:43,260 --> 02:44:45,540
Of what?

1583
02:44:45,820 --> 02:44:48,180
I was foolish.

1584
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:54,540
I thought you did not care for my work,or me.

1585
02:44:56,660 --> 02:45:00,180
Forgive me.

1586
02:45:03,220 --> 02:45:06,860
Forgive me.

1587
02:46:03,140 --> 02:46:07,140
What are you doing here?

1588
02:46:07,780 --> 02:46:11,900
Your husband took sick.

1589
02:46:12,140 --> 02:46:15,660
I brought him home.

1590
02:46:15,900 --> 02:46:18,580
Why you?

1591
02:46:18,820 --> 02:46:23,620
Because,madame,I was at hand.

1592
02:46:25,860 --> 02:46:30,700
Well,thank you very much. You can go now.

1593
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:33,780
He needs me,ma'am.

1594
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:35,860
No,he doesn't.

1595
02:46:36,100 --> 02:46:40,660
And I don't want you here. Just go,please.

1596
02:46:40,900 --> 02:46:45,420
- He asked me to stay. - And I'm ask...

1597
02:47:13,940 --> 02:47:17,500
I'm back.

1598
02:47:19,140 --> 02:47:23,540
I missed you so much.

1599
02:47:25,740 --> 02:47:28,740
If you'd just...

1600
02:47:29,020 --> 02:47:33,540
...show me that you need me.

1601
02:47:37,940 --> 02:47:42,740
And I'll try to do better too.

1602
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:56,300
What is this?

1603
02:47:57,940 --> 02:48:03,860
No,Wolfie,not this. Not this.

1604
02:48:06,020 --> 02:48:10,580
You're not to work on this ever again.

1605
02:48:10,820 --> 02:48:14,220
I've decided.

1606
02:48:16,460 --> 02:48:20,660
This is not his handwriting.

1607
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:23,420
It's mine.

1608
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:26,740
I was assisting him.

1609
02:48:26,980 --> 02:48:30,060
He's not to work on this anymore.

1610
02:48:30,300 --> 02:48:34,060
- It's making him ill. - But...

1611
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:39,020
Good night.

1612
02:48:39,980 --> 02:48:44,540
I regret we have no servants to show you out,"Herr Salieri".

1613
02:48:44,780 --> 02:48:47,700
Please respect my wish and go.

1614
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:49,700
Madame...

1615
02:48:49,980 --> 02:48:54,060
...I will respect his.

1616
02:52:56,940 --> 02:53:01,340
Your merciful God.

1617
02:53:03,100 --> 02:53:08,340
He destroyed his own beloved,rather than let a mediocrity...

1618
02:53:08,580 --> 02:53:13,780
...share in the smallest part of his glory.

1619
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:16,380
He killed Mozart.

1620
02:53:16,660 --> 02:53:19,340
And kept me alive to torture.

1621
02:53:19,620 --> 02:53:21,740
Thirty-two years of torture.

1622
02:53:21,980 --> 02:53:27,620
Thirty-two years of slowly watching myself become extinct.

1623
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:30,060
My music...

1624
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:32,180
...growing fainter.

1625
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:35,260
All the time fainter...

1626
02:53:35,500 --> 02:53:39,140
...till no one plays it at all.

1627
02:53:39,380 --> 02:53:42,180
And his...

1628
02:53:42,540 --> 02:53:47,260
Good morning,professor. Time for the water closet.

1629
02:53:47,500 --> 02:53:52,780
Then we have your favorite breakfast. Sugar rolls. He loves those.

1630
02:53:53,020 --> 02:53:55,660
Fresh sugar rolls.

1631
02:53:55,900 --> 02:53:58,340
I will speak for you,Father.

1632
02:53:58,620 --> 02:54:01,980
I speak for all mediocrities in the world.

1633
02:54:02,220 --> 02:54:04,940
I am their champion.

1634
02:54:05,180 --> 02:54:09,460
I am their patron saint.

Mediocrities everywhere...

1636
02:54:22,620 --> 02:54:26,660
...I absolve you.

1637

I absolve you.

1638
02:54:29,820 --> 02:54:33,780
I absolve you.

1639
02:54:34,580 --> 02:54:37,660
I absolve you.

1640
02:54:37,940 --> 02:54:42,500
I absolve you all.
