1
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,713
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,218
It's a wonderful article in the paper about you,
Sir Oliver. Wonderful, Sir!

3
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:33,971
Good morning, Professor,
or I should say, Sir Oliver.

4
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:37,475
- Long article about you on page two.
- Is there? Well, well, well.

5
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,977
I think they made a mistake
about your age.

6
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,956
Paper! Paper!

7
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,335
- Paper! Paper!
- Paper!

8
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:10,424
Aye, it's such an honor
for Edinburgh, Sir Oliver.

9
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:12,843
- I cannot take your money.
- Thank you.

10
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,429
Paper! Paper!

11
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,354
Congratulations,
Professor.

Sorry.

23
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:27,334
Sir Oliver,
since you've been created a knight,

24
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,837
I've given your
students a holiday,

25
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,672
a day for a knight,
so to speak.

26
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,384
First, however, there's
to be a presentation.

27
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:38,512
Will the lad
of Glendarick step forward?

28
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,642
Sir Oliver,
in the name of the whole student body,

29
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:46,103
in gratitude for the knowledge
you have imparted to us...

30
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:49,315
That's enough obituary prose.

31
00:04:50,107 --> 00:04:51,192
An inkwell, I presume.

32
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:53,152
A very handsome thing.

33
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:56,530
Hellish to dust.

34
00:04:56,614 --> 00:04:59,491
I thank you all from
the bottom of my heart,

35
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,619
and now, off to
the playing fields, all of you!

36
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,288
- Yay!
- Yay!

37
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,228
- Ah.
- It cost £4.17.

38
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:30,397
- I was on the committee that made the collection.
- I thank you for your efforts, McEwan.

39
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:33,400
£5 was subscribed.
That left three shillings.

40
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:35,611
You're not going to give me
the change, are you?

41
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:37,613
I expended it on this,

42
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:40,532
a little extra token
I thought you might fancy.

43
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:44,912
I saw it during Easter week in
a window in Glasgow, a curiosity shop.

44
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:48,374
It seemed to whisper to me,
"Buy me for Professor Lindenbrook."

45
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:49,500
Aye, what did you reply?

46
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,836
I said, "Only if you can
be bought for three shillings."

47
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,922
I had to argue with the owner
all through Good Friday.

48
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:56,840
- It's lava, of course.
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,260
But exceptionally heavy.

50
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:00,886
It could serve
as a paperweight.

51
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,429
Do you like it,
Professor?

52
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:04,473
It's a scholar's choice.

53
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,142
Where are you eating tonight?

54
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:10,854
Oh, this being Tuesday,
I'm not eating.

55
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:15,859
- Oh?
- I find it healthy to eat only every other night.

56
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:19,113
Be at my house at 8:00.
I'm entertaining some members of the faculty.

57
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,573
Professor,
I do not think I could.

58
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:23,017
What's the matter with you,
McEwan?

59
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:25,077
You used to come to
my house quite regularly.

60
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,705
Is it those frayed cuffs
that are worrying you?

61
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,291
I won't get back my other shirt
from the wash till Friday.

62
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,126
8:00 sharp!

63
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:33,544
We're scientists, aren't we?

64
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,088
That's one society where
frayed cuffs don't matter.

65
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:39,800
- We've all had 'em.
- Yes, Sir Oliver.

66
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:41,385
8:00.

67
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,764
Lava?

68
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:47,933
I swear there's
something inside.

69
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,469
There's Uncle now, Kirsty.

70
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,554
And high time too!

71
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,436
I-I thought it was
Uncle Oliver.

72
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,190
I want it thoroughly understood not
a single stitch I'm wearing belongs to me.

73
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:38,859
- Good evening, Miss Jenny.
- Good evening, Alec McEwan.

74
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,694
I'm early. But I trust
I'm not too early.

75
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:43,113
I didn't know
you were coming.

76
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:46,325
Well, your uncle...
I should say, Sir Oliver ordered me to come.

77
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:48,202
Oh, where is he?

78
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:49,870
He's never been late
like this. Never.

79
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:53,707
I don't know,
but to return to the subject of my clothes,

80
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,960
...they're the property of my classmate,
the young lad of Glendarick.

81
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:00,381
"You can't go to dinner dressed like that,"
said the young lad.

82
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:04,676
"The professor knows my wardrobe,"
I replied and went to take my bath.

83
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,556
Uh, when I returned,
my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted.

84
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,352
I want to make it clear,
I have no claim to the Glendarick tartan.

85
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:15,687
You've explained
your magnificence.

86
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:19,650
Kirsty, there will be
one more guest.

87
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:23,195
I'll seat you between
the dean and the rector.

88
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:26,782
- Couldn't I sit next to you?
- Certainly not.

89
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,536
You'll pardon my being personal,
Miss Jenny,

90
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:34,081
but I notice a certain harshness
in your attitude toward me.

91
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:39,169
What attitude do you expect when it takes a command
from my uncle to bring you to this house?

92
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:43,799
Miss Jenny,
why should I torture myself and on purpose?

93
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:46,885
Two years more I have to study
for my master's degree,

94
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:49,221
then four years more
as a laboratory assistant.

95
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:51,682
Then there's the money I have
to give back to my relatives.

96
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,267
They're paying
for my schooling.

97
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,727
You are very logical,
Mr. McEwan.

98
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,896
It's the logic of an empty purse.

99
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,982
How like a Scotsman!

100
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,067
I am a Scotsman.

101
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,111
I know of one whose purse
was not empty,

102
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:06,280
because he didn't even
have a purse.

103
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:08,115
His name was
Robert Burns.

104
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:09,783
Do you know what he said?

105
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:12,161
Miss Jenny,
the time of poetry is over.

106
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:14,037
If this is true,
Alec McEwan,

107
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,748
what are you doing
with your hand on my knee?

108
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,462
Miss Jenny...

109
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:23,964
Now you just wait in there.

110
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,758
Kirsty, I'll set
the extra place.

111
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,355
Is there something
you want?

112
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:43,692
- Uh, a key is stuck.
- But that's impossible.

113
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,652
It was just tuned
last month.

114
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,197
Which one?

115
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,199
This one.
Can't you see?

116
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:52,201
No, I can't.

117
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:54,620
At least you can see
how unhappy I am.

118
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:58,540
You know how I've felt ever since
that first day you entered the classroom.

119
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:00,626
Brought your uncle
the galoshes he forgot.

120
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,921
You looked like spring

00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:28,195

you were settin' the table.

126
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,698
There's a key stuck.
Mr. McEwan is fixing it.

140
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,287
Miss Jenny,
you're crying.

141
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,707
I-I bent over the goose.
The fumes.

142
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:12,132
Good evening, Miss Jenny.

143
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,717
G-Good evening, gentlemen.

144
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,219
We were just worrying about
Professor Lindenbrook.

145
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,013
Yes, we were.
Isn't he with you?

146
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,891
- Isn't he here?
- No.

147
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,360
Careful it doesn't
go too high, Paisley.

148
00:12:31,443 --> 00:12:33,487
It's just about the limit now,
Sir Oliver.

149
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:37,491
I gave no permission
for visitors!

150
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:40,661
Oh, it's you, McEwan. Good lad.
You can lend Paisley a hand.

151
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,871
Uncle Oliver,
your guests are waiting.

152
00:12:42,954 --> 00:12:45,707
If you don't come,
the goose will be completely spoil...

153
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,752
- Oh, goose, goose, goose.
- Tell him, Alec.

154
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,921
This lump of lava you gave me
is 1 in 10 million.

155
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,047
I've been at it all day.

156
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,675
Aye, without a pause
for lunch or tea.

157
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,386
You've had three semesters
of petrology. Now then,

158
00:12:57,469 --> 00:13:00,722
from which volcano could
this piece of lava have emerged?

159
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,849
- Fujiyama?
- No.

160
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:04,309
- Mt. Etna?
- Very close.

161
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:08,355
The Mediterranean.
The Lipari Islands group off the coast of Italy.

162
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:10,315
But theirs
is a very light lava.

163
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,858
That's exactly
what stumped me,

164
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,568
because inside
must be something

165
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:16,029
the weight of the heaviest rock
in existence.

166
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:18,865
But professor,
that would be Icelandic peridotite.

167
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:20,742
Precisely.

168
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:22,619
- There's a piece chipped off.
- By me.

169
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:24,705
What's the rock inside?

170
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,540
Icelandic peridotite, naturally.

171
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,751
When I saw this,
I stopped chipping.

172
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,171
There's some marks
on the surface.

173
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:35,465
It looks like a letter
or some notches.

174
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,468
Three notches made
by the hand of man.

175
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:43,598
But how could
a rock from Iceland

176
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:47,394
possibly pop out of
a volcano across the world?

177
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:48,979
What's your conclusion?

178
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,273
Science does not
jump to conclusions.

179
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,567
Science is not
a guessing game.

180
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,236
We're going to melt off
the crust of lava.

181
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,113
Mr. Paisley.

182
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:07,247
Add 10 cc of aqua regia.
Not too fast, you know.

183
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:11,793
I shall write to Professor
Göteborg of Stockholm about this.

184
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:14,296
He's the world's leading authority
on volcanoes.

185
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,590
How long is all this
going to take?

186
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:18,633
A typically female question.

187
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:21,595
To melt lava will take as long
as it takes lava to melt.

188
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:23,638
Maybe two hours.
Maybe four hours.

189
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:25,265
Two hours?
Four hours?

190
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,434
Maybe the whole night.
Who cares?

191
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:35,859
Jenny!

192
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,113
Are you all right?

193
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:56,630
That was entirely
my fault, Sir Oliver.

194
00:14:56,713 --> 00:14:58,273
I don't know how it
could have happened.

195
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:04,721
Mr. Paisley, by your slip you've rendered
an inestimable service to science.

196
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:08,600
Alec!

197
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:12,437
See this?
What would you call it?

198
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:15,315
As you said,
it's a man-made object.

199
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:16,608
It looks like a-a top,

200
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,110
a surveyor's instrument,
a plumb bob.

201
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:21,822
Not only looks like.
It is a plumb bob.

202
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:24,658
There are letters on it.

203
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,327
It's an inscription,
a message, perhaps.

204
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,329
Can you make out
what it says, Professor?

205
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,542
It's in some
Nordic tongue.

206
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,085
The hand that
wrote this trembled.

207
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,170
Perhaps it was
a dying hand.

208
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:40,799
I wonder what it's written in.
Paint? Ink?

209
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:42,634
Perhaps blood.

210
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:44,803
Possibly.

211
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:47,264
Look at this side, sir!
A signature!

212
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:52,018
Arne Saknussemm.

213
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:54,020
Arne Saknussemm!

214
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:59,985
I hope it isn't too much to suggest
that you take me home now, Uncle Oliver.

215
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,903
Or do I have to
go alone?

216
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:05,156
Alone. Alone!

217
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,825
It's unthinkable,
but it must be true.

218
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:08,285
A man took some tools...

219
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,705
and went where no human being
has ever set foot,

220
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:15,709
alone into the interior
of the earth, alone.

221
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,794
Who? What is
he talking about?

222
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:21,047
- Arne Saknussemm, the Icelandic scientist.
- The greatest of his day.

223
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:24,801
He was laughed at when he claimed there
must be some kind of a world down below.

224
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:28,138
The laughter stopped when he disappeared,
never to be heard from...

225
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:33,351
until tonight.

226
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,402
Get out of here, woman.
I didn't ask for tea!

227
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:45,614
I don't want any tea!
All I want is my post.

228
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:48,241
There's no use shouting at me,
Sir Oliver!

229
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:51,161
I can shout
just as loud as you can!

230
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,497
For the past two weeks,
you've had nothing to eat, and you haven't slept.

231
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,333
Out, woman!

232
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,627
Here's your post,
Uncle Oliver.

233
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:10,764
Another day,
and still nothing!

234
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:13,058
Can you believe that?
No answer.

235
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:17,771
- And where is Alec McEwan?
- He went to the university in case there are some letters there.

236
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:20,649
How long does it take for a letter to get
from Stockholm to Edinburgh?

237
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:22,567
- Answer the bell.
- Did it ring?

238
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,322
We have to speak
to Sir Oliver.

239
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:29,449
And don't tell us
he's busy.

240
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:32,953
Callers?
Callers! That's all I need.

241
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:37,415
Oliver, we all know
your reputation for rudeness.

242
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:40,168
You also have a reputation
as a conscientious man.

243
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,712
But you've skipped
every lecture in the past two weeks.

244
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:44,798
I'm involved in something important.

245
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:47,050
More important
than our university?

246
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,636
Something any university
in the world would envy us.

247
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,972
Ah, yes!

248
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:53,807
You laugh!

249
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,893
What does the name
Arne Saknussemm mean to you?

250
00:17:58,103 --> 00:17:59,604
Saknussemm, Saknussemm.

251
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:04,067
Wasn't he the one who wrote
about the lost city of Atlantis?

252
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,819
That was an early
phase of his career.

253
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:09,489
His real fame rests on
his study of volcanoes.

254
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:12,158
Out of a volcano
came this message from him.

255
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:13,994
It lay unnoticed
for 100 years

256
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,079
was probably picked up
by some peasant,

257
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,165
gathered dust in a curiosity shop
till it came to me.

258
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:21,918
Here is a translation
of the words.

259
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:25,255
"I am dying, but my life's work
must not be lost.

260
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:28,049
Whoever descends into the crater
of <i>Snæfellsjökull</i>

261
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:30,010
can reach the center of the Earth.

262
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:32,345
I did it.
Arne Saknussemm."

263
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:35,015
- The center of the Earth?
- <i>Snæfellsjökull?</i>

264
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:36,683
That's an extinct volcano
in Iceland.

265
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:40,520
According to this, there must be a direct route
from it to a region no man has ever seen.

266
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,981
But Oliver,
this is sheer fantasy.

267
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:45,817
You haven't heard all of it.
There's a postscriptum.

268
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,610
"At sunrise
on the last day of May,

269
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,946
the mountain Scartaris
will point the path."

270
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:54,492
What do you say now?

271
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,828
- I'm more mystified than ever.
- Scartaris?

272
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,205
Scartaris is a mountain peak
near the volcano.

273
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,125
This is some kind of student's hoax.
You should know better.

274
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,670
Wait a second, rector.
Let's not take that tone.

275
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,173
Let's assume it's authentic.

276
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:10,175
Isn't the correct
procedure

277
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:13,178
to write a paper and submit it
to the university officially?

278
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,680
You must consult
other experts.

279
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:17,682
A thing like this
needs verification.

280
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:19,684
Here is my paper.

281
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:23,188
I've written to
the foremost authority in Europe.

282
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:25,023
The Royal
Geological Society?

283
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:27,692
More eminent still.
Professor Göteborg of Stockholm.

284
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:30,195
Oh? And what
does he say?

285
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:32,697
Unfortunately, I've not yet
received his reply.

286
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:35,200
I've written to him twice!

287
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,000
Well, then, I suggest
we relax on the matter

288
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,748
until your famous correspondent
sees fit to answer you.

289
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:44,709
In the meantime, we could do
with a cup of tea.

290
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:47,378
I know you two
think I'm daft!

291
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:50,215
Think whatever you want!

292
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:52,717
Jenny, tea!

293
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,011
When did you get here?

294
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:57,555
Just this moment,
Sir Oliver. Look.

295
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:01,518
It's from Stockholm.

296
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,781
Well, he's got his letter
from Stockholm.

297
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:16,366
Did you see the shine
in his eyes?

298
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,326
There'll never
be a better moment than today.

299
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:20,745
I'm going to tell him about
our feelings for each other.

300
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:22,205
He'll say yes
almost inadvertently.

301
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,707
What if he says no
advertently?

302
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:29,754
You wait and see how firm my voice
can be when I speak of you.

303
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:42,809
Blast and damnation!

304
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,687
The devil blast it!

305
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,065
What is it, Oliver?
Don't keep us in the dark.

306
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:51,901
- Bad news, sir?
- I am stricken.

307
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:54,863
The University of Stockholm
informs me

308
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:57,866
that Professor Göteborg
has vanished from Sweden.

309
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,785
His disappearance
follows closely the date

310
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:04,706
when my communication
must have reached him...

311
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:06,207
with all my material.

312
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,460
He evidently didn't think it
important enough to answer.

313
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:11,838
Or too important.

314
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:14,549
McEwan, go to the shipping offices.
No, go directly to the harbor!

315
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:16,509
Find out when
the next ship leaves for Iceland.

316
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:19,888
- Oliver, Oliver.
- I will not be beaten to my goal.

317
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:22,515
- What is your goal?
- Can you ask that?

318
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,225
You heard
Saknussemm's message.

319
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,021
- Oliver, you're seriously ill.
- I am seriously well!

320
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:30,023
What are you waiting for?
I told you to hurry.

321
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:32,358
If you'll excuse me,
I must start packing my things.

322
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:35,528
- To go where?
- To Iceland, to begin with.

323
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:38,114
- And then?
- Where Arne Saknussemm went.

324
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:41,242
- Oliver!
- Will you kindly stop saying Oliver?

325
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:43,536
You don't think I can sit
in my classroom

326
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,790
while a scoundrel named Göteborg exploits
what I foolishly placed in his hands.

327
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,792
Don't you see
what's at stake?

328
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:53,087
The ultimate aim of all science,
to penetrate the unknown.

329
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:56,299
Do you realize we know less
about the earth we live on

330
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,968
than about the stars
and galaxies of outer space?

331
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:01,471
The greatest mystery
is right here.

332
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,181
Right under our feet.

333
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:06,517
And now, if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen.

334
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:15,526
- I must have a word with you.
- I have no time for words.

335
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,320
You must take time
for this, sir.

336
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,240
- What are you so urgent about?
- This is the most urgent moment of my life.

337
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:21,866
For you,
but not for me.

338
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,576
I have to be in Iceland
before the week's over.

339
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,120
So must I.
I'm going with you, sir.

340
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:29,666
- Where?
- To the center of the Earth, naturally.

341
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:30,500
Oh!

342
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:51,562
<i>♪ My heart's
in the Highlands ♪</i>

343
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:53,564
<i>♪ A-chasing the deer ♪</i>

344
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:57,819
<i>♪ A-hunting the wild deer ♪</i>

345
00:22:57,902 --> 00:23:00,238
<i>♪ And chasing the roe ♪</i>

346
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:04,784
<i>♪ My heart's
in the Highland ♪</i>

347
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,495
<i>♪ Wherever I go ♪</i>

348
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:12,000
By now all Iceland must be aware
that the Scots have arrived.

349
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,961
I wish I could sing loud enough
for Jenny to hear me.

350
00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:16,462
Homesick already?

351
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:20,133
It's a bit painful to leave your fiancée
on the first day of your engagement.

352
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:24,137
But to come back as a world famous scientist,
that's not to be sneezed at.

353
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,389
Come here. Take a look.

354
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,105
Did you expect a flight of
stairs with a red carpet?

355
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:39,652
I neglected to tell you, sir,
I have a nervous fear of heights.

356
00:23:39,736 --> 00:23:43,614
Well, you'll get over that after
the first million fathoms or so.

357
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:45,908
Million fathoms.

358
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,127
Alec!
He's been here!

359
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:06,512
He's been surveying here.
This is fresh-cut wood.

360
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:09,932
- Your revered colleague from Stockholm.
- He isn't wasting any time.

361
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,226
Do you think
he's already gone down?

362
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,730
No. Saknussemm stipulated
the last day of May.

363
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:18,941
Take a carriage
back to Reykjavik.

364
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,693
Buy every foot of rope
that's available.

365
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:24,864
Stock up on hardtack, salted beef,
chocolate and medical supplies.

366
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:28,659
But more than anything,
inquire whether they have Ruhmkorff lamps.

367
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:31,871
Have another carriage waiting for me
at the foot of the slope at sunset.

368
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:34,165
You think we can prepare it
all so quickly?

369
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:36,626
We must.
We're in a race.

370
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,544
What's that you're taking?

371
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,546
Jenny's farewell gift.

372
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,801
I'll keep it
with me always.

373
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:01,526
Scartaris!

374
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,106
- Back to my hotel.
- <i>Ja,</i> Professor Göteborg.

375
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:06,466
Ah, there, my good man.

376
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,259
I assume my assistant
sent you.

377
00:26:08,342 --> 00:26:11,971
No, thank you.
Nobody carries the soldier's weapons.

378
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,974
And take your time.
These instruments are delicate.

379
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:47,632
Easy, coachman! Easy!

380
00:26:52,053 --> 00:26:54,764
This isn't the same road
we came by this morning!

381
00:26:55,556 --> 00:26:57,016
I said, slow down, man!

382
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,691
You're out of your senses!

383
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:07,693
Stop your horses, man!

384
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,695
This is not a request,
it's a command!

385
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:15,952
Can't you hear me?
Slow down!

386
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:20,248
Stop, you fool!

387
00:27:28,297 --> 00:27:30,258
Whoa!

388
00:27:36,305 --> 00:27:40,851
If you've ruined my instruments,
I'll horsewhip you, so help me.

389
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:46,357
And where are we?

390
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,651
This certainly
is not my hotel.

391
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:05,835
- Professor!
- Alec!

392
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:10,756
Where are we?

393
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,426
Apparently in
an eider feather storehouse.

394
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:17,763
- How did you get here?
- I don't know what happened. It went so fast.

395
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:21,350
I was clubbed. I was overpowered before
I knew there was a struggle.

396
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:25,396
- Did you see who did it?
- No. I was just walking trying to get done with your errands.

397
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:28,649
When I said Professor Göteborg was a scoundrel,
I flattered him. He's a criminal!

398
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:31,235
Likely all his life long,
he's dreamed of such a project.

399
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,529
Your letter was the key
to the door of fame.

400
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,489
Hush. Did you hear that?

401
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:38,909
- What?
- Some tapping.

402
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:42,038
Don't get your hopes up, Professor.
There's not a soul around.

403
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,749
Everybody's in Iceland
is in the market square.

404
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:48,085
- Why? It isn't Sunday!
- Tomorrow the fishing fleet goes out for the first haul.

405
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:50,289
You couldn't make our purchases.
The shops are closed.

406
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:53,716
No. The shops are open,
but every piece of rope, every lamp,

407
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,427
everything we'd need
was sold in the last two days.

408
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,803
To Professor Göteborg!

409
00:28:57,887 --> 00:29:01,682
He's staying in the inn where
we have our rooms.

410
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:06,228
This time I heard it too.

411
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:09,065
A fellow prisoner,
do you suppose?

412
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:10,816
He's giving us signals.

413
00:29:13,694 --> 00:29:15,946
- It's a code.
- Morse?

414
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:20,076
I can't just make it out.
Jot this down.

415
00:29:23,704 --> 00:29:27,249
Dash, dash, dot,
dot, dot, dot, long dash.

416
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,336
It doesn't make sense.

417
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:31,712
Perhaps it's in Icelandic.

418
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:33,756
I don't think so.

419
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:42,139
We've established contact.

420
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:45,267
I still can't make it out.

421
00:29:47,103 --> 00:29:49,313
My esteemed friend,
whoever you are,

422
00:29:49,397 --> 00:29:50,815
let me introduce myself,

423
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:53,776
Professor Oliver Lindenbrook,
University of Edinburgh.

424
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,867
May I ask you
to interrupt your tapping and listen?

425
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,705
In what language
would you like me to speak?

426
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:10,000
Apparently,
he doesn't understand English.

427
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:12,086
I'll try French.

428
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:13,713
<i>Mon cher ami,</i>

429
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:16,674
<i>vous et nous sonnes dans
une situation abominable!</i>

430
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:23,180
It's no good, sir.
It sounds more Russian.

431
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:35,067
Gertrude!

432
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:41,282
Gertrude!
Gertrude!

433
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,289
- It's a female prisoner.
- And her lover.

434
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:57,423
Professor, they're kissing.

435
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:01,469
I'm sorry,
but for once we must dispense with tact.

436
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:06,974
Much as I regret to disturb this tender moment,
can you get us out of here?

437
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:21,197
Oh, Gertrude.

438
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:27,161
It's a duck!

439
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:31,165
And I was just about
to try Latin.

440
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,921
Young man with the gold tooth,
I'll give you more gold

441
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:39,340
if you'll guide us
to Reykjavik.

442
00:31:39,423 --> 00:31:42,134
Ah. <i>Ja,</i> Reykjavik.

443
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:44,804
You take us to Reykjavik.

444
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:05,658
I understand that Professor Göteborg
from Stockholm is stopping here.

445
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:10,996
- A friend...
- A friend of yours? Professor Göteborg?

446
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,457
Let's say a colleague.

447
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:14,708
May I be of help?

448
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,838
- He is at home, isn't he?
- Yes. I...

449
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:22,758
Oh, he is not at home.
He is not to be disturbed.

450
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:26,262
Don't tell me he's asleep
with all this going on.

451
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:29,849
You cannot see him.
I'm sorry.

452
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:32,852
Here are your coins.
And here is my card.

453
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:37,523
If you'd be good enough to put it in
his box so he'll know that I'm around.

454
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:38,774
Thank you so much.

455
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:50,536
Göteborg,
I know you're in there!

456
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:52,663
Open up!
This is Lindenbrook.

457
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:07,761
Göteborg.

458
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:27,239
Do you see
what this is, laddie?

459
00:33:27,323 --> 00:33:29,742
The very last word
in equipment.

460
00:33:29,825 --> 00:33:32,536
- Ruhmkorff lamps!
- Oh!

461
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,371
Self-generating.

462
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,836
- How long will they burn, Professor?
- My guess is indefinitely.

463
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,173
As long as they're wound up,
the induction coil will give off current.

464
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,343
Breathing devices,

465
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:49,386
the kind they use
in coal mines in Wales.

466
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:53,474
All the instruments needed for
exploring the world below,

467
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:55,225
whatever it may be!

468
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:59,772
I shall wait here
till Göteborg returns.

469
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,482
You...

470
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:02,858
wait too.

471
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,569
Göteborg may be
a strong man.

472
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:19,083
More treasure, sir.
Climbing boots,

473
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,835
alpenstocks,

474
00:34:22,836 --> 00:34:24,254
blankets.

475
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,760
Food for months.

476
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:36,767
A chart with...

477
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:43,440
P-P-Professor!

478
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,071
What?

479
00:34:56,996 --> 00:35:01,542
Well, Göteborg, it seems there's
such a thing as justice, after all.

480
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:06,547
So you wanted to
push in ahead of us?

481
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,590
Fate took care of him.

482
00:35:09,091 --> 00:35:11,510
Why didn't they
tell us at the desk?

483
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:15,264
Hotels rarely advertise the fact
that they have corpses lying around.

484
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,311
The Icelander
teaches us a lesson.

485
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:26,567
All right. We'll observe one minute of
silence in memory of a great scientist,

486
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,944
even if he was
a blasted thief.

487
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:01,685
Alec,
you mentioned fate.

488
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:03,562
Slight correction...

489
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:06,982
Fate plus a few grains
of potassium cyanide.

490
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,446
He was against us.
Someone was even more against him.

491
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:14,490
Who?

492
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:48,357
I'm the wife of
Professor Göteborg.

493
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,027
- Oh, my dear.
- What is it?

494
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:55,697
I was surprised my husband
wasn't at the pier to meet me.

495
00:36:56,532 --> 00:37:00,410
- Is something wrong?
- Won't you sit down for a minute before you go up?

496
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:03,956
Please, my dear.

497
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:11,296
He seemed so well.
Early in the morning, he went to the mountain.

498
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,884
He came back for lunch and received
his guest in the lobby. I saw him myself.

499
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:18,846
They went up to his room and ate.

500
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:23,642
What are you trying to tell me?
That my husband is...

501
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:28,689
His guest left about 4:00.

502
00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:31,608
In the evening,
when the maid went to make the bed...

503
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:34,069
Oh, dear God.

504
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:37,447
As long as I can remember
no one ever died in my inn.

505
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:43,495
Of course, we called a doctor,
but it was too late.

506
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:47,082
We left him up there because we knew
you were due in on the morning boat.

507
00:37:55,424 --> 00:38:01,638
Just 10 days ago,
he was joking on the pier in Stockholm.

508
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:06,435
The moment he arrived here,
he sent me a message

509
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:09,855
just with one word: "Come.”

510
00:38:20,574 --> 00:38:23,410
Madam, my deep sympathy.

511
00:38:23,493 --> 00:38:26,997
My name is Oliver Lindenbrook
of Edinburgh University.

512
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,416
I take it you're familiar
with that name.

513
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,294
Professor Lindenbrook.

514
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,129
I see you are.

515
00:38:35,756 --> 00:38:37,799
I must ask you a question.

516
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:40,177
It's just as well that
Madam Göteborg be present.

517
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:43,663
This will be difficult for you, madam.
But it must be faced.

518
00:38:44,848 --> 00:38:47,559
Who was the last person
to see Professor Göteborg alive?

519
00:38:47,643 --> 00:38:50,479
- His luncheon guest.
- Who was that?

520
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:56,318
- Count Saknussemm.
- Count Saknussemm?

521
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,654
I didn't realize the Saknussemm family
still existed.

522
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:02,407
The Saknussemms are
the oldest family in this whole land.

523
00:39:02,491 --> 00:39:05,327
A descendant of Arne Saknussemm.

524
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,538
And a scientist, too,
in his own right.

525
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:10,666
It was he who lunched
with Professor Göteborg?

526
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,376
They saw each other
every day.

527
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:14,461
They worked together
in his room

528
00:39:14,544 --> 00:39:17,464
with all those charts
and instruments.

529
00:39:17,547 --> 00:39:20,550
I suggest that you have
an autopsy performed immediately.

530
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:25,889
You think there's something
suspicious about my husband's death?

531
00:39:25,973 --> 00:39:30,227
Your husband came to Iceland for
the same reasons that brought me.

532
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:33,021
Neither he nor I
could possibly suspect

533
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:35,899
there was a third party would
stop at nothing to forestall us.

534
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:40,153
- He was killed?
- Poisoned.

535
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:42,948
- Oh.
- This is now a matter for the police.

536
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:44,992
Send for them at once.

537
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:47,536
To your room first, madam.

538
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,875
Uh, just one second, if you please.
Thank you.

539
00:39:58,547 --> 00:40:01,008
I'm deeply distressed
by your husband's death.

540
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:02,509
I fully understand
your feelings.

541
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:06,013
However, I must ask you
one question.

542
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:11,435
How do you plan to dispose of
the equipment your husband assembled up there?

543
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:12,978
What does it matter now?

544
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:16,023
Precisely. Don't give it another thought.
I'll take it off your hands.

545
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:20,485
- We can discuss it later.
- We cannot discuss it later. Time is running out.

546
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:24,072
My expedition must start
within 24 hours.

547
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:27,200
- Your expedition?
- Exactly.

548
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,495
I only know of
the Göteborg Expedition.

549
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:33,999
Husbands don't always
tell their wives everything.

550
00:40:34,082 --> 00:40:36,501
I don't wish to blacken
the memory your husband.

551
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:40,047
However, because I'm under pressure,
I must change my request to a demand.

552
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,341
I have a right to that equipment
and I claim it.

553
00:40:42,424 --> 00:40:46,636
A right to take over the work
of another man's lifetime?

554
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,058
- He died for that idea!
- An idea he stole from me.

555
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:52,517
That is a lie.

556
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:55,312
- Madam.
- An unforgivable lie.

557
00:40:57,356 --> 00:41:02,611
I would rather destroy every pound of
that equipment than let you have it.

558
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,626
"Incredible encounter!

559
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,712
A Saknussemm
descendant turns up,

560
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:23,048
acts as if he were
King of Volcanoes,

561
00:41:23,131 --> 00:41:26,259
tries to force me to surrender
his ancestor's secret.

562
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:30,389
Saknussemm called again.

563
00:41:30,472 --> 00:41:32,224
New complication!

564
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:36,937
My real adversary arrives,
Lindenbrook,

565
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,564
undoubtedly to claim his rights.

566
00:41:39,648 --> 00:41:42,067
Must fight him somehow."

567
00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:00,085
Oh, uh, young man,
would you come here a moment, please?

568
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:05,006
Who are those for?

569
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:09,511
Professor Lindenbrook.

570
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:13,515
Ah-ha.

571
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,018
<i>Ja,</i> madam.

572
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:28,405
Oh, at least we have some rope.
That's a beginning.

573
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:35,036
Tell him to stop jabbering
and go shopping.

574
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,038
What about lamps?

575
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:44,337
Uh, lamps. Lamps.
What about, uh, picks?

576
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:46,882
Oh, and provisions, food.

577
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:50,260
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

578
00:42:50,343 --> 00:42:52,179
Put me down.
Put me down, big ox!

579
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:54,347
Tell him to put me down!
Put me down!

580
00:42:56,725 --> 00:42:59,060
Somebody please
explain this outrage.

581
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:01,980
Are we to be abducted
every day in Iceland?

582
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:06,860
<i>Ja,</i> madam.

583
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:12,073
- She speaks Icelandic.
- I do,

584
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:15,660
but I wish to apologize to you
in plain English.

585
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:19,498
I went through
my husband's diary.

586
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:23,460
Some of his remarks led me to believe you.
I did you an injustice.

587
00:43:23,543 --> 00:43:26,546
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- Don't give it another thought. I shan't.

588
00:43:27,756 --> 00:43:30,217
I'm Sir Oliver's assistant.
My name is Alec McEwan.

589
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,553
This whole expedition began
thanks to this lad.

590
00:43:33,637 --> 00:43:35,972
Began and that's
all it has done.

591
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:40,769
Sir Oliver, this morning you asked me for these.
If you still want them, they're yours.

592
00:43:42,062 --> 00:43:43,104
Will you say that again?

593
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:47,651
I shall not stand in the way
of the Lindenbrook Expedition.

594
00:43:56,826 --> 00:44:00,455
- Madam.
- My husband had these boots made specially.

595
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:02,165
I hope they fit you.

596
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:04,042
Mine will be ready
without delay.

597
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:06,294
I told your man to order
some for me immediately.

598
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:08,838
Good, good.

599
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:12,008
What was that?

600
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:13,885
Why would you need
boots like this?

601
00:44:13,969 --> 00:44:15,929
I can't very well go in these.

602
00:44:16,972 --> 00:44:19,391
- Go where, madam?
- Don't say it.

603
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:22,519
Naturally,
I'm coming along.

604
00:44:22,602 --> 00:44:25,855
That's why I'm giving you all of this.
That's a condition. I thought you understood.

605
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:27,816
You didn't mention
any condition.

606
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:30,652
Then I do now.

607
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:35,240
- Whom did you intend to take besides this young man?
- The big Icelander.

608
00:44:35,323 --> 00:44:38,952
Then I'll be very useful.
He doesn't understand English.

609
00:44:39,035 --> 00:44:43,248
- You can't come along! You're a woman!
- What has my sex to do with this?

610
00:44:43,331 --> 00:44:47,043
We're not contemplating a stroll down
Piccadilly or the <i>Champs-Élysées.</i>

611
00:44:48,295 --> 00:44:52,215
Professor Lindenbrook,
I've just lost my husband.

612
00:44:52,299 --> 00:44:55,260
I have nothing else to live for
up here.

613
00:44:55,343 --> 00:44:58,555
Down there,
I can at least represent his name.

614
00:44:58,638 --> 00:45:01,600
Unfortunately,
the decision is not yours to make.

615
00:45:01,683 --> 00:45:04,603
The police require your presence for
the investigation into your husband's death.

616
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:07,022
I have already given
my testimony.

617
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,278
But madam, quite apart from the appalling danger,
think of the inconvenience.

618
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:15,655
The lack of privacy!

619
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:18,116
In short, you don't want all of this.
Is that it?

620
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:22,162
I may be mad on the subject of this journey,
but I am not stupid!

621
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:25,206
To burden myself with
a female is sheer stupidity.

622
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,669
I resent that word. I may have been
a disturbance to men, never a burden.

623
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:34,049
This is
an absolute holdup.

624
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:38,094
I assure you you will not receive
one iota of extra consideration.

625
00:45:38,178 --> 00:45:42,015
You'll sleep where we sleep,
you'll eat what we eat and wash when we wash.

626
00:45:42,098 --> 00:45:44,351
Then you accept
my proposition?

627
00:45:46,603 --> 00:45:48,605
Oh!

628
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:21,179
Professor, look!

629
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:47,288
There's our gateway.

630
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:24,409
Thank you, Scartaris.

631
00:47:24,492 --> 00:47:27,412
Never was there
a brighter sunrise.

632
00:47:27,495 --> 00:47:29,831
Now, we descend
into oblivion,

633
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:35,044
or we enter
the great book of history.

634
00:47:35,128 --> 00:47:39,048
- Roll call.
- Carla Göteborg.

635
00:47:39,132 --> 00:47:42,510
- Alexander McEwan.
- Hans <i>und</i> Gertrude Bjelke.

636
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:45,055
Oliver S. Lindenbrook.

637
00:47:47,348 --> 00:47:48,892
What did he say?
Hans and who?

638
00:47:48,975 --> 00:47:51,394
And Gertrude.

639
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:02,113
Professor!

640
00:48:05,074 --> 00:48:07,827
Professor!

641
00:48:09,078 --> 00:48:11,289
All right,
you've arrived.

642
00:48:17,086 --> 00:48:21,049
- Rather an alarming descent.
- I found it exhilarating.

643
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:25,481
I wonder if Madam Göteborg will
change her mind as the last moment.

644
00:48:25,553 --> 00:48:28,014
You make
my mouth water.

645
00:48:28,097 --> 00:48:30,517
Hans is tying the rope
on her.

646
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:35,772
I'm a fool. I should have told him to tie her to one
of the mules and send her back where she belongs.

647
00:48:35,855 --> 00:48:38,316
In what language would you have
told him that, Sir Oliver?

648
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,319
She may be of some use
in that respect.

649
00:48:41,402 --> 00:48:44,906
Then there's always the blessed
chance the rope may break.

650
00:48:58,002 --> 00:49:00,046
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- Oh, quite.

651
00:49:00,129 --> 00:49:03,007
Hans insisted
on a double rope.

652
00:49:03,591 --> 00:49:05,385
Did he indeed?
How solicitous.

653
00:49:05,468 --> 00:49:08,096
But that was for Gertrude.

654
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:11,516
Poor Sir Oliver,
stuck with a woman.

655
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:14,686
If only you
could see your face.

656
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:16,521
That's my consolation, madam.

657
00:49:16,604 --> 00:49:18,565
I don't have to look at it.
You do.

658
00:49:43,506 --> 00:49:45,425
There isn't enough rope
in all Europe!

659
00:49:45,508 --> 00:49:47,677
Perhaps we made a mistake
and this is the wrong entrance.

660
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,554
The sign was unmistakable.

661
00:49:49,637 --> 00:49:52,181
But there's no
other way to continue.

662
00:49:52,265 --> 00:49:56,561
Gertrude!

663
00:49:56,644 --> 00:49:58,813
Gertrude!

664
00:50:13,995 --> 00:50:15,705
Oh, madam!
Madam!

665
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:20,960
He says there's a tunnel
on the other side.

666
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:26,174
- Slanting downhill, but walkable.
- Eureka!

667
00:50:29,677 --> 00:50:31,804
Oh, thank you.

668
00:50:38,478 --> 00:50:41,272
Now then,
a general summary.

669
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:45,818
A: We must never use more than
two Ruhmkorff lamps at a time.

670
00:50:46,527 --> 00:50:49,947
B: We'll not be needing our breathing
equipment for a long stretch.

671
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:52,951
Nevertheless, never
take a step without it.

672
00:50:53,034 --> 00:50:56,496
C: Use our canteens freely
for the present.

673
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:58,539
There'll be plenty of
springs on our way.

674
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:00,583
As my husband's charts
indicated.

675
00:51:02,043 --> 00:51:05,046
Is Professor Göteborg to be
with us on our entire journey?

676
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:08,132
Sorry.

677
00:51:09,384 --> 00:51:13,054
Well, every journey
begins with a first step.

678
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:15,848
May the good Lord
be with us. Onward!

679
00:51:18,726 --> 00:51:21,771
And let's have some music.
Alec, will you start us off?

680
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:39,580
<i>♪ La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la ♪</i>

681
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:43,084
<i>♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪</i>

682
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,253
<i>♪ Boom-boom
boom-boom ♪</i>

683
00:52:20,621 --> 00:52:22,373
Miss Jenny!

684
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:28,796
I saw you turn pale when
the dominie spoke of those in peril

685
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,174
at the far ends
of the earth.

686
00:52:31,257 --> 00:52:33,718
Far ends of the earth,
at least that would be somewhere.

687
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:38,222
There was a clipping
in a Stockholm paper,

688
00:52:38,306 --> 00:52:40,725
a dispatch
from Reykjavik.

689
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:43,519
I can only read their names.
I had it translated.

690
00:52:43,603 --> 00:52:47,023
The last news of them was
that they went up Mount Sneffels

691
00:52:47,106 --> 00:52:49,901
- with some heavily-laden donkeys.
- Yes?

692
00:52:49,984 --> 00:52:53,321
And then the animals
came down without their packs.

693
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:55,364
- And?
- And that's all.

694
00:52:57,742 --> 00:53:01,162
Oliver S. Lindenbrook,
Alexander McEwan,

695
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:04,582
Hans Bjelke,
and Madam...

696
00:53:04,665 --> 00:53:08,127
- What's...
- Why, it seems a woman went with them.

697
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:11,172
A woman!

698
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:01,139
You know what
they'll call that

699
00:54:01,222 --> 00:54:03,099
in the Royal Observatory
at Greenwich?

700
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:08,312
"A slight tremor coming
from undefined regions."

701
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:13,651
Well, we've lived through a slight tremor.
Let us proceed.

702
00:54:35,923 --> 00:54:38,342
It seems to be
moving away from us.

703
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,050
Madam, in these regions,
I'd never venture to say

704
00:54:41,095 --> 00:54:44,682
anything is moving away
or coming towards us.

705
00:54:44,765 --> 00:54:48,186
The only thing we can be certain of
is that danger is always with us.

706
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:50,771
We might as well
ignore it.

707
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:11,542
Run!

708
00:55:48,162 --> 00:55:49,538
Jump!

709
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:50,665
Aah! Oh!

710
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:11,560
The three notches.

711
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:18,943
- The three notches of Arne Saknussemm.
- What does that mean?

712
00:56:19,026 --> 00:56:21,404
We've been shown the right path.
We have a guide.

713
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:23,322
Alec, the plumb bob.

714
00:56:24,657 --> 00:56:29,453
Look! Without these marks,
we would have gone astray.

715
00:56:29,537 --> 00:56:31,539
We'd have wasted months
exploring endlessly.

716
00:56:33,582 --> 00:56:36,127
We might have taken
any one of these channels.

717
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:39,547
But our great colleague
maketh a path for our feet.

718
00:56:47,346 --> 00:56:49,432
Well, you all
deserve a rest.

719
00:56:49,515 --> 00:56:53,853
Let's have tea with
a double ration of raisins.

720
00:56:56,439 --> 00:56:59,734
- May I comb my hair first, Professor?
- Oh!

721
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:02,778
Ladies on the left.
Gentleman on the right.

722
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:23,591
Oh!

723
00:57:26,052 --> 00:57:28,179
- What is it, madam?
- Shh!

724
00:57:28,262 --> 00:57:30,639
If we'd known
you were subject to nightmares,

725
00:57:30,723 --> 00:57:33,017
we'd have made different
sleeping arrangements.

726
00:57:36,562 --> 00:57:38,898
Someone is walking
up there.

727
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,902
I heard footsteps, human footsteps.

728
00:57:42,985 --> 00:57:44,403
Madam, since the beginning
of time,

729
00:57:44,487 --> 00:57:47,365
all women have heard footsteps...
up there.

730
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:49,825
My hearing is
extremely acute.

731
00:57:50,618 --> 00:57:53,329
The hearing of all women
is extremely acute.

732
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:55,498
My wife used to hear
rats in the attic,

733
00:57:55,581 --> 00:57:58,209
usually, on the nights before
I had an important lecture.

734
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:00,127
I used to go up,
armed with a broom.

735
00:58:01,462 --> 00:58:04,423
Alec, go up and find out.
Hans...

736
00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:06,675
Madam, will you leave those men alone?
They need rest.

737
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:12,014
Moreover, it was stipulated
that I give the orders.

738
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:15,393
There's no need to use
that patient voice with me, Professor.

739
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:17,728
Would you rather I used
an impatient voice?

740
00:58:17,812 --> 00:58:22,108
Professor Lindenbrook,
I am a member of this expedition.

741
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:25,319
As such, I intend to report
any observations I make.

742
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:30,241
Alec, put it down
in the record

743
00:58:30,324 --> 00:58:35,329
that a member of the expedition
reported rats in the attic.

744
00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:36,664
Lights out!

745
00:58:53,514 --> 00:58:55,141
Don't be afraid, madam.
I'm right here.

746
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,235
Conceal these marks completely.

747
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:55,576
I'll give them
some new ones.

748
01:00:32,363 --> 01:00:35,115
This is steeper than
anything we've encountered.

749
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,493
It's just as well we all
had a good night's rest.

750
01:00:38,118 --> 01:00:42,790
Alec, take this down.
21st day of our descent,

751
01:00:43,624 --> 01:00:47,628
starting from an estimated depth
of 129 kilometers,

752
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:49,964
limestone formation
continues.

753
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:52,633
Aye, aye, Professor!

754
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:55,302
- Here are the three notches again.
- Good!

755
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:05,396
Gertrude!
Wrong turn.

756
01:01:05,479 --> 01:01:07,773
Let's see.
What have we here?

757
01:01:08,649 --> 01:01:11,026
One heads 220 degrees
south-southwest,

758
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,238
the other 160 degrees
south-southeast. Strange.

759
01:01:14,321 --> 01:01:17,658
I would have wagered
we'd have to bear in that direction.

760
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:19,994
That was Gertrude's
feeling too.

761
01:01:21,328 --> 01:01:22,830
Are you sure
your compass is right?

762
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:25,457
Quite.

763
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:38,679
Madam...

764
01:01:44,018 --> 01:01:45,185
What's he saying?

765
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:49,690
Hans is wondering about
the ultimate goal of our expedition.

766
01:01:50,733 --> 01:01:51,817
He's asking, "Why?"

767
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,528
Alec, suppose
you tell him.

768
01:01:56,363 --> 01:02:01,368
Well, why does man freeze to death
trying to reach the North Pole?

769
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:06,790
Why does man suffer
the steam and heat of the Amazon?

770
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,629
Why does he stagger his mind
with the mathematics of the sky?

771
01:02:12,463 --> 01:02:15,007
Once a question mark has
arisen in the human brain,

772
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:19,553
the answer must be found if it takes
a hundred years, a thousand years.

773
01:02:19,637 --> 01:02:23,474
Let's hear you render that into
a few well-chosen Icelandic words.

774
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:27,269
Why not simply tell him scientists
have bats in their belfries?

775
01:02:27,353 --> 01:02:28,354
Oh!

776
01:02:39,531 --> 01:02:41,241
Are you all right?

777
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:45,037
Can you unhook yourself?
Yes! Hans!

778
01:02:59,259 --> 01:03:01,929
- Grab his hand.
- I didn't see it! I didn't see it!

779
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:05,766
Never mind about that.

780
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:09,269
How is it possible?

781
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:10,854
This way was
clearly indicated.

782
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:15,359
There must have been a quake
since Arne Saknussemm's day.

783
01:03:15,442 --> 01:03:18,654
This is no recent fissure.
This has been here since the beginning of time.

784
01:03:19,822 --> 01:03:22,700
I was not in a position
to observe it scientifically.

785
01:03:22,783 --> 01:03:25,661
We made a mistake
somewhere, but where?

786
01:03:47,307 --> 01:03:50,352
What are you doing here, madam?
We're supposed to stay together.

787
01:03:50,436 --> 01:03:52,730
You know we must never have
more than two lamps at a time.

788
01:03:52,813 --> 01:03:56,567
We've been tricked,
tricked into the wrong tunnel.

789
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:59,653
Those three notches
are not Arne Saknussemm's.

790
01:04:00,612 --> 01:04:02,156
She's right, Professor.

791
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:04,408
Someone has passed through
before us.

792
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:07,244
No need to ask who.

793
01:04:07,327 --> 01:04:10,414
Madam heard him
last night.

794
01:04:10,497 --> 01:04:12,583
Now she's saying,
"I told you so."

795
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,752
Silently, I admit,
but she's saying it.

796
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:19,047
When I wish to say something,
I say it aloud.

797
01:04:19,798 --> 01:04:21,300
In view of
this new development,

798
01:04:21,383 --> 01:04:23,927
I have no choice but
to break up the expedition.

799
01:04:24,011 --> 01:04:26,096
- We must return.
- Why?

800
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:29,183
You don't strike me as
a man who frightens easily.

801
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:32,060
I'm not thinking of myself.
You know that.

802
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:33,437
I must think of you:
A woman!

803
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,939
We agreed I was to be
one of your men.

804
01:04:36,648 --> 01:04:38,408
But if there is a madman
is loose in these...

805
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:42,529
He's against all of us,
against the very concept of this journey.

806
01:04:48,494 --> 01:04:50,496
What's happened now?
What's he saying?

807
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:53,540
He said we should go back
to where Alec fell.

808
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,628
But it's not
on our route.

809
01:04:57,711 --> 01:05:00,964
If we're to go ahead,
we've no time for detours.

810
01:05:01,048 --> 01:05:03,217
Then you wait here.

811
01:05:31,912 --> 01:05:34,373
If only my Jenny
were here to see this.

812
01:05:38,252 --> 01:05:39,628
<i>♪ La, la, la ♪</i>

813
01:05:39,711 --> 01:05:42,130
<i>♪ La-la, la-la-la ♪</i>

814
01:05:42,214 --> 01:05:43,632
<i>♪ La, la, la ♪</i>

815
01:05:43,715 --> 01:05:45,551
<i>♪ Bum dee bum bum ♪</i>

816
01:05:45,634 --> 01:05:48,011
<i>♪ Bum dee dum ♪</i>

817
01:05:48,095 --> 01:05:51,056
Madam, now that
the boy has gone

818
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:52,659
and Hans doesn't
understand English,

819
01:05:52,724 --> 01:05:56,353
I must ask
a delicate question.

820
01:05:56,436 --> 01:05:58,230
I'm blushing already.

821
01:05:58,939 --> 01:06:01,775
You're wearing stays,
are you not?

822
01:06:02,401 --> 01:06:03,277
Professor!

823
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,780
Yes, I thought so.
I can hear them creaking as you walk.

824
01:06:06,864 --> 01:06:08,699
What I wear is not
your business!

825
01:06:08,782 --> 01:06:10,576
Everything here
is my business.

826
01:06:10,659 --> 01:06:13,036
Hans and I will look the other way
while you discard them.

827
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,872
Professor,
you go too far.

828
01:06:14,955 --> 01:06:17,374
We're approaching regions where
the heat will be excessive.

829
01:06:17,457 --> 01:06:19,793
Nothing must impede
anyone's breathing.

830
01:06:44,484 --> 01:06:47,237
Alec!
Leaving in a few minutes!

831
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:03,105
I've got to take a specimen
of this back to Edinburgh,

832
01:08:03,188 --> 01:08:06,233
if it's the last thing I do.

833
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:17,953
Unique.
Inexplicable.

834
01:08:24,126 --> 01:08:28,505
Ready to go, if that boy Alec
would be good enough to appear.

835
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,841
Where the devil is he?

836
01:08:55,115 --> 01:08:57,075
It's a blind alley!

837
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,205
Keep back!

838
01:09:34,654 --> 01:09:36,114
Professor!

839
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:55,592
Hans!

840
01:10:46,852 --> 01:10:47,853
Good God!

841
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:01,533
Hold on.
Hold on to my arm.

842
01:11:01,616 --> 01:11:04,619
My shoulder.
Hold on to me.

843
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:14,296
Oh, praise the Lord.

844
01:11:19,718 --> 01:11:20,719
Oh!

845
01:11:32,606 --> 01:11:33,857
Oh!

846
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,066
Oh.

847
01:12:18,985 --> 01:12:19,986
Alec.

848
01:12:29,788 --> 01:12:31,539
Professor!

849
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:09,119
Hello! Hello!

850
01:13:10,203 --> 01:13:12,414
Professor,
here I am!

851
01:13:12,497 --> 01:13:14,249
Here I am!

852
01:16:06,546 --> 01:16:08,590
Salt!

853
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:40,348
Alec!

854
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:45,603
Alec!

855
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:52,110
Professor, you can't
go on this way.

856
01:17:53,361 --> 01:17:55,530
I've kept track of the passage of days.
You haven't.

857
01:17:55,613 --> 01:17:57,574
We'll try that channel
over there.

858
01:17:57,657 --> 01:18:01,327
We were in that channel yesterday.
We left marks.

859
01:18:01,411 --> 01:18:02,954
You won't find him there.

860
01:18:03,037 --> 01:18:05,456
I've got to find him.
I'm responsible.

861
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:09,502
Oh.

862
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:20,763
No need to translate.
I can see this is a recent break.

863
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:23,224
Alec!

864
01:18:29,522 --> 01:18:32,025
Can you hear me?

865
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:36,029
If you're down there, give us a sign!

866
01:18:36,863 --> 01:18:38,781
Alec, listen carefully.

867
01:18:38,865 --> 01:18:42,118
When the echoes stop,
you must try to answer.

868
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:46,456
If you're injured,
if you can't talk, make an effort.

869
01:18:46,539 --> 01:18:49,542
Pick up a pebble and scratch the rock.
We'll hear you.

870
01:18:49,626 --> 01:18:53,713
I promise you.
Just give us a sign!

871
01:19:12,774 --> 01:19:15,276
A phosphorescent pool.

872
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,403
Strange grave
for a young Scot.

873
01:19:21,157 --> 01:19:23,409
Professor,
there's no use.

874
01:19:24,285 --> 01:19:26,496
How can I live
with myself?

875
01:19:26,579 --> 01:19:31,084
Accept his loss like one soldier
accepts the loss of another soldier.

876
01:19:31,709 --> 01:19:36,714
You must continue what you started.
You must go on with the Lindenbrook Expedition.

877
01:19:37,423 --> 01:19:39,509
The Lindenbrook
Expedition.

878
01:19:39,592 --> 01:19:40,968
Yes.

879
01:19:41,052 --> 01:19:43,554
Go on with it.

880
01:19:43,638 --> 01:19:46,432
It was his project,
as much as it was yours.

881
01:19:47,809 --> 01:19:49,519
Yes, you're right.

882
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:53,272
We will proceed,

883
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:56,818
but we won't call it
the Lindenbrook Expedition anymore.

884
01:19:58,111 --> 01:20:01,989
From now on,
it's the Alec McEwan Expedition.

885
01:20:40,611 --> 01:20:42,530
No broken bones?

886
01:20:43,156 --> 01:20:44,741
Ribs all right?

887
01:20:44,824 --> 01:20:46,993
Good. Get up.

888
01:20:50,997 --> 01:20:53,666
Down there, food and water.
Refresh yourself.

889
01:20:57,336 --> 01:20:59,297
So you lost
your friends?

890
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,340
Just as well.

891
01:21:10,683 --> 01:21:12,351
It's my servant.

892
01:21:14,604 --> 01:21:19,192
Too much heat, too much load,
ltoo much fear.

893
01:21:19,984 --> 01:21:21,903
You're younger.
You'll do to carry my things.

894
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:27,283
I'm not your servant,
Count Saknussemm.

895
01:21:27,366 --> 01:21:30,536
Pride?
Rather out of place here.

896
01:21:31,537 --> 01:21:33,956
Eat, drink and pick up those things.
I'm in a hurry.

897
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,875
To steal
the professor's project?

898
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:39,295
Steal?
Listen, young foreigner.

899
01:21:39,378 --> 01:21:42,465
I don't have to steal
what belongs to me.

900
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:45,802
You're in my world now.

901
01:21:53,226 --> 01:21:54,685
Stop!

902
01:21:54,769 --> 01:21:57,146
I need someone to
carry my equipment!

903
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,899
You'll never find
your companions or your way out.

904
01:22:01,067 --> 01:22:02,819
You need me
as much as I need you.

905
01:22:02,902 --> 01:22:04,946
You found me.
My friends could find me too.

906
01:22:05,029 --> 01:22:08,241
Very well,
you'll carry it with one arm, not two!

907
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,920
A hail of bullets.

908
01:22:21,003 --> 01:22:24,340
No, no! It's a multiple echo
reverberating through the rock chambers.

909
01:22:26,092 --> 01:22:29,095
The last echo
will give us the direction.

910
01:22:34,809 --> 01:22:36,936
166 degrees south-southeast.

911
01:22:56,455 --> 01:22:57,665
Alec. Alec.

912
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:02,962
Alec. Alec!

913
01:23:05,131 --> 01:23:08,467
We'd given you up,
but you're alive, laddie.

914
01:23:09,302 --> 01:23:10,803
You're alive!

915
01:23:14,223 --> 01:23:18,269
Professor.
Carla. Hans.

916
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:21,147
Just to see y...

917
01:23:24,191 --> 01:23:25,693
Where was he?

918
01:23:26,485 --> 01:23:30,573
I-I didn't think he'd shoot,
but he did.

919
01:23:30,656 --> 01:23:31,908
Of course I did.

920
01:23:33,326 --> 01:23:37,079
What did you expect?
You are trespassers here.

921
01:23:37,163 --> 01:23:39,081
I am the owner
of this domain.

922
01:23:41,959 --> 01:23:45,087
You are also
the murderer of my husband.

923
01:23:45,171 --> 01:23:48,090
I claimed my rights.
He would not listen.

924
01:23:48,174 --> 01:23:51,761
Count Saknussemm,
in the name of your great ancestor,

925
01:23:51,844 --> 01:23:53,554
put down that preposterous gun.

926
01:23:53,638 --> 01:23:56,349
No harm will come
if you accept my terms.

927
01:23:56,432 --> 01:23:59,018
You will go back
the way you came,

928
01:23:59,101 --> 01:24:02,563
but you will leave equipment
I need and that man.

929
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:08,527
Sir Oliver, you are not going
to listen to a murderer.

930
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:10,404
Never interrupt
a murderer, madam.

931
01:24:10,488 --> 01:24:13,366
I resent that
bourgeois classification.

932
01:24:14,116 --> 01:24:16,410
I'll spare your lives.

933
01:24:16,494 --> 01:24:18,913
You have
my word of honor.

934
01:24:21,999 --> 01:24:23,501
Give me
your hand on that.

935
01:24:30,883 --> 01:24:33,886
A bourgeois trick.
So sorry.

936
01:24:40,518 --> 01:24:43,938
All right, before
we continue on our journey,

937
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:46,440
we must perform
a solemn duty.

938
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:48,901
We have
to hold court.

939
01:24:52,613 --> 01:24:55,616
Here, hundreds of kilometers
beneath the surface of the earth,

940
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,618
we are the law.

941
01:24:58,786 --> 01:25:01,706
The defendant stands accused
of one murder

942
01:25:01,789 --> 01:25:03,374
and one act of mayhem.

943
01:25:03,457 --> 01:25:06,669
To preserve legal formalities,
I must ask you, as jurors,

944
01:25:06,752 --> 01:25:08,713
is the defendant
guilty or not guilty?

945
01:25:09,463 --> 01:25:10,965
Guilty.

946
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:13,968
Guilty.

947
01:25:14,969 --> 01:25:15,469
Hans.

948
01:25:28,024 --> 01:25:29,442
Guilty.

949
01:25:32,486 --> 01:25:34,905
Then the mandatory
sentence...

950
01:25:34,989 --> 01:25:36,949
is death.

951
01:25:38,659 --> 01:25:39,739
There are two bullets left.

952
01:25:39,785 --> 01:25:44,040
Madam,
will you be good enough to explain to Hans?

953
01:25:44,123 --> 01:25:46,625
We will follow the route
marked by the notches.

954
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:49,879
He is to wait here for 10 minutes,
then carry out the sentence.

955
01:25:55,468 --> 01:25:57,303
No, no, no, no, no.

956
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:00,014
Professor, I can carry
something with my left hand.

957
01:26:00,097 --> 01:26:02,858
You can carry yourself for a couple of days.
That's all we can expect.

958
01:26:05,686 --> 01:26:08,230
Sir Oliver,
there's a slight problem.

959
01:26:08,314 --> 01:26:11,567
Our friend
Hans refuses to shoot the count.

960
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:14,737
What do you mean, refuses?
It's a court order.

961
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:18,699
It seems his family have been loyal
to the Saknussemms for generations.

962
01:26:18,783 --> 01:26:20,743
And, well, he cannot touch the gun.

963
01:26:20,826 --> 01:26:23,245
This is contempt of court.

964
01:26:25,164 --> 01:26:26,332
All right, Alec.

965
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:28,626
Oh, no, no, Profess...
I mean, Sir Oliver.

966
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:31,003
You mustn't look at me.
I, um...

967
01:26:31,087 --> 01:26:33,214
I couldn't pull the trigger
with my left hand.

968
01:26:38,511 --> 01:26:43,307
Oh, no. You... You couldn't consider
for a moment that I could do it.

969
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:44,433
After all, I'm a woman!

970
01:26:44,517 --> 01:26:48,521
I see. For weeks
you've been denying your sex.

971
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:50,731
And now you fall back on it.

972
01:26:51,398 --> 01:26:53,859
I would say
the natural executioner

973
01:26:53,943 --> 01:26:55,543
would be the leader
of the expedition.

974
01:26:57,404 --> 01:26:59,949
We must face
the truth, sir.

975
01:27:00,032 --> 01:27:04,370
We're much too civilized to-to do away
with a fellow human being.

976
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:07,164
What do you propose?
Drag him along with us? Feed him?

977
01:27:07,248 --> 01:27:09,875
Let him share our glory?
Stop fiddling with those lamps!

978
01:27:10,626 --> 01:27:15,005
Oh, Madam...

979
01:27:15,089 --> 01:27:16,966
What's he jabbering about?

980
01:27:17,633 --> 01:27:19,552
I'll tell you
what he's saying.

981
01:27:19,635 --> 01:27:23,973
The lamps are giving out.
And I'll give you the reason.

982
01:27:24,056 --> 01:27:26,600
The induction coils
have been corroded by the salt.

983
01:27:26,684 --> 01:27:30,646
To save what we can,
I insist that we leave these regions at once.

984
01:27:30,729 --> 01:27:31,856
You insist?

985
01:27:37,486 --> 01:27:39,405
As a matter of fact,
he's bloody well right.

986
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:41,407
Let's be off.

987
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:54,962
You realize, Professor,
Saknussemm's unfastened himself from the rope again

988
01:27:55,045 --> 01:27:56,547
and gone off?

989
01:27:57,381 --> 01:28:00,342
Oh, what's the harm?
He'll be back when it's time to eat.

990
01:28:00,426 --> 01:28:02,553
The harm is, Madam,
he's wasting a lamp.

991
01:28:33,292 --> 01:28:35,294
Madam, will you
try your lamp, please?

992
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:47,848
- It's dead.
- Yours, Alec?

993
01:28:53,604 --> 01:28:56,273
When these things are gone,
they're really gone.

994
01:28:58,442 --> 01:29:02,112
Madam, make a final note while
there is still light enough to write by.

995
01:29:02,947 --> 01:29:04,657
Let me.
My arm's well now.

996
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,408
No need.

997
01:29:07,618 --> 01:29:10,246
Covered another
92 kilometers.

998
01:29:10,329 --> 01:29:13,791
Temperature
dropped seven degrees.

999
01:29:13,874 --> 01:29:16,502
Surprisingly cooler
than anticipated.

1000
01:29:18,379 --> 01:29:21,423
The darkness is
closing about us.

1001
01:29:21,507 --> 01:29:22,800
This may be
our last entry.

1002
01:29:29,306 --> 01:29:31,767
Hans and I can cut some rope
into torches.

1003
01:29:32,309 --> 01:29:34,186
That's a good idea.

1004
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:37,773
What puzzles me is that the three notches
of Arne Saknussemm...

1005
01:29:37,856 --> 01:29:39,984
still keep pointing
our way.

1006
01:29:40,567 --> 01:29:42,820
What kind of a lamp
did he have?

1007
01:29:43,404 --> 01:29:46,282
Perhaps my ancestor
did not require a lamp.

1008
01:29:46,365 --> 01:29:50,661
From here on, neither do you, Sir Oliver.
Why don't you turn it off?

1009
01:29:52,538 --> 01:29:55,165
Yes,
just switch it off.

1010
01:30:02,047 --> 01:30:04,300
Why,
it's miraculous.

1011
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,138
Look at this.

1012
01:30:16,895 --> 01:30:17,980
What is it, sir?

1013
01:30:18,063 --> 01:30:20,816
A form of algae with
a property of luminescence.

1014
01:30:20,899 --> 01:30:24,820
Light without heat.
A cool chemical light.

1015
01:30:24,903 --> 01:30:28,240
You've seen fireflies, Madam,
and glowworms

1016
01:30:28,324 --> 01:30:31,827
and forms of life in the sea
that generate their own light?

1017
01:30:32,411 --> 01:30:34,496
The same principle
is involved here.

1018
01:31:10,324 --> 01:31:13,118
256th day.

1019
01:31:14,495 --> 01:31:18,582
The phenomenal winds vanished
as abruptly as they came.

1020
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:23,545
We are now in a stupendous
deposit of cinnabar.

1021
01:31:25,172 --> 01:31:27,841
What's that curious little mark
you make on every page?

1022
01:31:27,925 --> 01:31:31,595
M.E.: McEwan Expedition.

1023
01:31:31,678 --> 01:31:34,556
You mean that whenever
I've said Lindenbrook Expedition,

1024
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,809
you've written
McEwan Expedition?

1025
01:31:38,685 --> 01:31:40,729
May I remind you
that months ago,

1026
01:31:40,813 --> 01:31:43,315
you gave me explicit orders
to that effect?

1027
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:48,278
You may not remind me.
I do not wish to be corrected by you incessantly.

1028
01:31:48,362 --> 01:31:49,571
Is that what I'm doing?

1029
01:31:49,655 --> 01:31:52,408
You're doing it with your looks,
with the inflection of your voice,

1030
01:31:52,491 --> 01:31:54,118
the very posture
of your body.

1031
01:31:54,201 --> 01:31:58,080
Your entire presence is
a constant criticism of me.

1032
01:31:58,163 --> 01:31:59,832
I'm tired of it.
I've had enough!

1033
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:03,710
You've had enough!

1034
01:32:05,587 --> 01:32:10,426
Let me tell you,
you dried-up walnut of a man!

1035
01:32:10,509 --> 01:32:12,177
If anyone's had enough,
it's me!

1036
01:32:12,261 --> 01:32:13,387
It's I.

1037
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:16,849
It's I! It's me!
It's Carla Göteborg.

1038
01:32:16,932 --> 01:32:19,309
I quit!
I'm leaving!

1039
01:32:21,687 --> 01:32:24,398
May I send for
madam's horse and carriage?

1040
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:39,705
Well, at least you know
I have a temper.

1041
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:43,041
Alec will
keep the charts. Alec!

1042
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:45,294
Alec!

1043
01:32:45,377 --> 01:32:47,504
Why can't he stay around?

1044
01:33:30,339 --> 01:33:33,425
Aye, aye, aye, aye-o!

1045
01:33:45,646 --> 01:33:48,148
Mushrooms!
A forest of mushrooms.

1046
01:33:48,232 --> 01:33:51,443
They might be hundreds of years old,
but the small ones we can eat.

1047
01:33:51,527 --> 01:33:52,986
They're delicious!

1048
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:59,284
To think they grew without sun
this far under the earth!

1049
01:34:07,626 --> 01:34:09,586
All the food we can eat!

1050
01:34:16,301 --> 01:34:17,803
It's tougher
than leather.

1051
01:34:20,806 --> 01:34:23,850
We'll have new soles
for our shoes.

1052
01:34:27,396 --> 01:34:28,397
Ooh!

1053
01:34:29,147 --> 01:34:30,691
It's like an oak tree!

1054
01:35:12,858 --> 01:35:15,235
Ah! Madam,
you're magnificent.

1055
01:35:15,319 --> 01:35:19,698
Mushroom steak,
mushroom soup, mushroom hash.

1056
01:35:19,781 --> 01:35:22,784
Let me say this: If we'd had one more week
of that salted beef,

1057
01:35:22,868 --> 01:35:24,453
I would have perished.

1058
01:35:24,536 --> 01:35:26,038
Don't be too happy.

1059
01:35:26,121 --> 01:35:29,958
After some months of this,
you'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef.

1060
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:32,753
Yes. Months, months.

1061
01:35:32,836 --> 01:35:35,088
If we only knew
how many more.

1062
01:35:35,172 --> 01:35:38,008
There's no term
to the work of a scientist.

1063
01:35:38,091 --> 01:35:41,595
Let me say this, Madam,
if you hadn't been along,

1064
01:35:41,678 --> 01:35:43,930
this whole journey
would have been unbearable.

1065
01:35:45,307 --> 01:35:47,351
But that's not Professor
Lindenbrook's feeling.

1066
01:35:48,477 --> 01:35:49,978
It's mine.

1067
01:35:50,812 --> 01:35:55,233
You see, we have no sun,
no moon, no stars,

1068
01:35:57,027 --> 01:35:58,528
but then you're here.

1069
01:36:01,865 --> 01:36:04,076
And what is the name
of the girl you love?

1070
01:36:05,243 --> 01:36:06,828
I beg your pardon?

1071
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,456
The girl you love.
What's her name?

1072
01:36:10,666 --> 01:36:13,835
Jenny. But why would you
want to know that just now?

1073
01:36:13,919 --> 01:36:16,755
Oh, dear Alec.

1074
01:36:16,838 --> 01:36:21,927
There are times when it's advisable to
jog a young man's memory.

1075
01:36:30,268 --> 01:36:31,353
Professor!

1076
01:36:33,438 --> 01:36:36,525
Here's some hot mushroom porridge
for you, Sir Oliver.

1077
01:36:49,371 --> 01:36:52,582
I slept as I'd never slept
in Edinburgh.

1078
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:55,794
No street noises,
no church bells,

1079
01:36:55,877 --> 01:36:59,631
no clatter of pans
from the kitchen.

1080
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:02,300
I may move here
permanently.

1081
01:37:07,097 --> 01:37:10,183
What's our large friend
doing over there?

1082
01:37:10,267 --> 01:37:14,396
I don't know.
Special command of His Majesty.

1083
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:17,190
Is that madman
still giving orders?

1084
01:37:18,150 --> 01:37:19,818
This is supposed to be
his rest period.

1085
01:37:19,901 --> 01:37:24,865
The minute you fell asleep,
he went off in that direction, through the tunnel.

1086
01:37:25,657 --> 01:37:28,910
He came back long enough to order
the felling of the mushrooms.

1087
01:37:37,627 --> 01:37:39,671
What in the world can he want
with all those?

1088
01:38:09,701 --> 01:38:13,371
You've come to ask me
why I didn't take my rest period.

1089
01:38:13,455 --> 01:38:15,373
I don't sleep.

1090
01:38:15,457 --> 01:38:18,460
I hate those little
slashes of death.

1091
01:38:18,543 --> 01:38:22,297
- It's a sea.
- It's an ocean with waves and currents.

1092
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:24,800
The ocean
of the underworld.

1093
01:38:24,883 --> 01:38:27,761
Some earthquake before
the beginning of history

1094
01:38:27,844 --> 01:38:29,930
cracked wide open
the great sea,

1095
01:38:30,013 --> 01:38:32,390
and, through the fissures,
poured this.

1096
01:38:33,058 --> 01:38:35,477
The fissures closed again.

1097
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:38,939
No map ever recorded
the Saknussemm Ocean.

1098
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:43,318
I so christened it
while you were asleep.

1099
01:38:43,401 --> 01:38:47,447
It's the prerogative of the discoverer.
I congratulate you.

1100
01:38:47,531 --> 01:38:51,785
You realize, Lindenbrook,
from now on there will be no more notches to follow.

1101
01:38:51,868 --> 01:38:55,038
That's why you ordered a raft.
I approve.

1102
01:39:10,178 --> 01:39:13,849
- A Dimetrodon!
- If I had my gun, we'd have fresh meat for dinner.

1103
01:39:13,932 --> 01:39:16,768
That's what he's saying!
He's a flesh-eater!

1104
01:39:21,898 --> 01:39:23,817
Can he swim?

1105
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:25,360
No, thank God.

1106
01:43:17,383 --> 01:43:19,886
The wind blows
down the high street.

1107
01:43:21,179 --> 01:43:22,806
Here.

1108
01:43:22,889 --> 01:43:25,350
I brought you
some nice apples.

1109
01:43:28,603 --> 01:43:30,605
I wonder if it's cold
where they are.

1110
01:43:30,688 --> 01:43:32,941
Where they are, indeed!

1111
01:43:33,858 --> 01:43:36,027
Are they anyplace?

1112
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,631
McEwan, put that toy away
and take over the rudder.

1113
01:43:56,714 --> 01:43:58,967
Yes, sir.

1114
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:01,094
I didn't tell you to
throw it away!

1115
01:44:01,177 --> 01:44:02,595
It blew out of my hand!

1116
01:44:04,055 --> 01:44:06,015
My watch!

1117
01:44:07,725 --> 01:44:09,561
The instruments!
Save the instruments!

1118
01:44:11,521 --> 01:44:14,023
My ring!
My wedding ring!

1119
01:44:14,107 --> 01:44:18,403
A field of force that snatches gold away.
This is it. This is it!

1120
01:44:18,486 --> 01:44:22,240
The junction of magnetic forces
from the North to the South Pole!

1121
01:44:22,323 --> 01:44:24,033
The center of the Earth!

1122
01:44:35,461 --> 01:44:37,255
Hang on!

1123
01:44:47,932 --> 01:44:50,435
Hold on to your rope,
Alec! Hold on!

1124
01:45:14,959 --> 01:45:15,459
No!

1125
01:45:53,623 --> 01:45:54,666
Is everyone here?

1126
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,878
Madam Göteborg,
Alec,

1127
01:45:59,462 --> 01:46:00,755
Hans.

1128
01:46:03,841 --> 01:46:05,593
Gertrude.

1129
01:46:06,636 --> 01:46:08,805
And His Highness
over there.

1130
01:46:12,267 --> 01:46:13,935
So...

1131
01:46:14,018 --> 01:46:19,399
the expedition with all
the names ends like this.

1132
01:46:19,482 --> 01:46:20,650
We're alive, aren't we?

1133
01:46:22,068 --> 01:46:24,946
After all, we did hit
the center of the Earth.

1134
01:46:25,029 --> 01:46:26,656
It hit us, laddie.

1135
01:46:33,121 --> 01:46:37,208
No need to tell us.
He wants to know where we go from here.

1136
01:46:38,793 --> 01:46:41,587
Tired minds
don't plan well.

1137
01:46:41,671 --> 01:46:43,256
Sleep first, plan later.

1138
01:46:48,553 --> 01:46:51,514
When I refused to eat my porridge
when I was a boy,

1139
01:46:51,597 --> 01:46:54,142
my mother,
like all mothers, used to say,

1140
01:46:54,225 --> 01:46:59,772
"Oliver, the day may come when you'd
very much like to have that porridge."

1141
01:47:02,066 --> 01:47:05,903
Why do you look so surprised?
Is it incredible that I ever had a mother?

1142
01:47:08,448 --> 01:47:11,492
I was just thinking
how proud she'd be

1143
01:47:11,576 --> 01:47:13,911
of that little boy
who wouldn't eat his porridge.

1144
01:48:11,677 --> 01:48:13,221
Here, duck.

1145
01:48:14,389 --> 01:48:16,140
Here, duck.

1146
01:48:28,653 --> 01:48:30,488
Gertrude.

1147
01:48:34,659 --> 01:48:35,952
Gertrude.

1148
01:48:43,835 --> 01:48:45,128
Gertrude?

1149
01:48:48,464 --> 01:48:50,258
Gertrude!

1150
01:48:58,933 --> 01:49:00,435
Gertrude!

1151
01:49:05,773 --> 01:49:08,484
Gertrude! Gertrude!

1152
01:49:08,568 --> 01:49:09,902
Gertrude!

1153
01:49:51,819 --> 01:49:53,988
Hans! Hans!

1154
01:50:00,244 --> 01:50:03,581
Why do you look at me
like that?

1155
01:50:03,664 --> 01:50:05,791
Hans!

1156
01:50:06,626 --> 01:50:09,921
I needed food,
so I took it.

1157
01:50:10,838 --> 01:50:14,717
Professor, tell your man
to calm himself.

1158
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,513
I'm not in the mood to engage in
a dispute about a slaughtered duck.

1159
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:20,932
Professor!
Stop him!

1160
01:50:21,682 --> 01:50:22,934
Stop this fool!

1161
01:50:23,017 --> 01:50:25,019
- Hans!
- Hans!

1162
01:50:37,406 --> 01:50:40,826
You ingrates!
What can you do without me?

1163
01:50:40,910 --> 01:50:44,789
Only I can show you the way
out of this realm of mine.

1164
01:50:44,872 --> 01:50:45,873
Look out!

1165
01:51:18,155 --> 01:51:21,492
This is
the sunken city.

1166
01:51:21,576 --> 01:51:27,331
After 5,000 years,
men behold a fragment of the lost Atlantis.

1167
01:51:38,175 --> 01:51:40,428
All we know about it
comes from the Greek.

1168
01:51:41,512 --> 01:51:46,100
The floor of the sea opened up and swallowed
the whole island of Atlantis.

1169
01:51:49,395 --> 01:51:51,856
This must have been
the market square.

1170
01:51:54,066 --> 01:51:55,901
Professor!

1171
01:51:55,985 --> 01:51:59,196
Professor, this looks like
some sort of inn.

1172
01:52:00,823 --> 01:52:03,701
It is an inn,
an eating place, certainly.

1173
01:52:04,869 --> 01:52:08,706
Eating. What a word.
What a wonderful word.

1174
01:52:11,542 --> 01:52:15,338
Well, we've learned one thing
about the inhabitants of Atlantis.

1175
01:52:16,797 --> 01:52:18,799
They ate oysters.

1176
01:52:32,647 --> 01:52:34,148
Stale bread.

1177
01:52:34,774 --> 01:52:36,317
We must speak
to the baker.

1178
01:52:37,151 --> 01:52:38,069
Madam!

1179
01:52:38,152 --> 01:52:39,070
Madam!

1180
01:52:40,321 --> 01:52:41,572
<i>Ja?</i>

1181
01:52:45,743 --> 01:52:48,162
He's asking if that was
a temple to their god?

1182
01:52:48,245 --> 01:52:49,622
Yes, I'm sure it is.

1183
01:52:53,626 --> 01:52:57,254
It's some sort of altar stone
where the sacred flame burned.

1184
01:52:57,338 --> 01:52:58,547
It's serpentine,
isn't it?

1185
01:52:58,631 --> 01:53:01,842
Exactly.
A massive form of asbestos.

1186
01:53:01,926 --> 01:53:04,345
To think that
at a moment like this,

1187
01:53:04,428 --> 01:53:06,931
I've no pad and pencil
to record it all.

1188
01:53:14,522 --> 01:53:16,107
Turn around, madam.
Don't look.

1189
01:53:17,191 --> 01:53:18,442
What is it?

1190
01:53:21,070 --> 01:53:23,823
The great Arne Saknussemm,
I presume.

1191
01:53:25,783 --> 01:53:28,160
So this is
as far as he came.

1192
01:53:28,244 --> 01:53:32,123
What's the matter with you two?
Say "How do you do" to a brave man.

1193
01:53:33,916 --> 01:53:36,168
He must have dragged himself here
with a broken leg.

1194
01:53:36,252 --> 01:53:37,920
Look at that tibia.

1195
01:53:39,630 --> 01:53:41,632
You won't find anything edible
in there.

1196
01:53:41,716 --> 01:53:44,677
Why not?
The Chinese eat eggs over 400 years old.

1197
01:53:47,805 --> 01:53:49,306
Gunpowder.

1198
01:53:50,224 --> 01:53:55,312
Professor, look at his right hand.
It's pointing somewhere.

1199
01:53:57,815 --> 01:54:00,109
To that shaft
over there.

1200
01:54:38,355 --> 01:54:42,443
Of course! Of course!
This is what the pointing finger meant!

1201
01:54:42,526 --> 01:54:46,113
This is the way up.
He couldn't make it, but we can.

1202
01:54:47,031 --> 01:54:48,866
This is a volcanic chimney.

1203
01:54:48,949 --> 01:54:51,410
The violent updraft can mean
only one thing.

1204
01:54:51,494 --> 01:54:53,871
A direct hatchway
to the surface.

1205
01:54:53,954 --> 01:54:55,247
We can climb up!

1206
01:54:55,331 --> 01:54:57,208
Madam, explain to Hans.

1207
01:54:57,291 --> 01:55:00,127
Let him venture a hundred meters
or so and reconnoiter.

1208
01:55:00,211 --> 01:55:02,171
The updraft
can't carry him away.

1209
01:55:03,005 --> 01:55:05,883
Hans...

1210
01:55:27,822 --> 01:55:30,658
Now I'd say let's roll up our sleeves,
if we had any.

1211
01:55:30,741 --> 01:55:32,159
We mustn't hope
for too much.

1212
01:55:32,243 --> 01:55:33,994
This light won't be with us
all the way.

1213
01:55:34,078 --> 01:55:35,996
We'll have to provide
some kind of light.

1214
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,415
And food.
I'll go see what I can find.

1215
01:55:38,499 --> 01:55:40,918
I'll comb every inch of Atlantis.

1216
01:56:13,784 --> 01:56:15,953
If we only had some shears,
we could cut it off.

1217
01:56:16,036 --> 01:56:18,122
Could we?

1218
01:56:32,136 --> 01:56:33,929
Aye, aye! Aye, aye!

1219
01:56:34,972 --> 01:56:37,266
Aye, aye!
Aye, aye!

1220
01:56:38,976 --> 01:56:42,187
Flints!
I found some flints.

1221
01:56:43,314 --> 01:56:44,231
Good lad.

1222
01:56:45,149 --> 01:56:47,234
We won't be walking
in darkness.

1223
01:56:48,110 --> 01:56:51,488
Madam!

1224
01:57:02,291 --> 01:57:03,918
I wish I had
better news for you.

1225
01:57:04,001 --> 01:57:07,004
It gives every indication
of being a perfect passage upward,

1226
01:57:07,087 --> 01:57:10,716
straighter than the one
we descended, but...

1227
01:57:10,799 --> 01:57:12,676
But? But?

1228
01:57:13,844 --> 01:57:18,307
There's an obstacle,
a gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway.

1229
01:57:18,849 --> 01:57:21,602
Hans said only a landslide
could ever move it.

1230
01:57:46,418 --> 01:57:47,920
No. Let him be.

1231
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:51,382
If all his hopes
hadn't been so high.

1232
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:58,472
- Alec!
- Yes, sir?

1233
01:57:59,306 --> 01:58:02,768
The haversack.
Arne Saknussemm's haversack. Get it!

1234
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:07,648
If God is with us,
and that gunpowder has kept its ginger over the years,

1235
01:58:07,731 --> 01:58:10,734
we'll make that
landslide ourselves.

1236
01:58:55,195 --> 01:58:58,866
Now, my wonderful companions,
you realize, I hope,

1237
01:58:58,949 --> 01:59:01,160
that we're taking
an enormous chance.

1238
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:03,454
But it's our only chance.

1239
01:59:04,204 --> 01:59:07,875
I guarantee that this will
blow up the obstructing rock.

1240
01:59:07,958 --> 01:59:12,212
Whether the surrounding rocks will take
the disturbance lightly, that I cannot guarantee.

1241
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:17,217
Let's get what protection we can.
Into the altar stone.

1242
01:59:38,614 --> 01:59:42,493
Dear God,
ruler of heaven and the Earth...

1243
01:59:42,576 --> 01:59:44,912
Don't set any limit
to his realm, laddie.

1244
01:59:48,248 --> 01:59:51,877
God of the universe,
we are in thy merciful hands.

1245
02:00:14,358 --> 02:00:16,985
- Look out!
- Run, Professor! A monster!

1246
02:00:22,366 --> 02:00:23,617
Let me go!

1247
02:01:14,751 --> 02:01:16,753
We started an earthquake.

1248
02:02:23,445 --> 02:02:26,198
The lava
is pushing us up!

1249
02:02:55,519 --> 02:02:57,938
It's an earthquake
of unusual magnitude!

1250
02:02:58,021 --> 02:03:00,065
More likely,
it's a volcanic eruption.

1251
02:03:00,148 --> 02:03:04,987
Listen to this:
"Stromboli, Italy, first eyewitness report.

1252
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:06,947
The capsule
of the dead volcano

1253
02:03:07,030 --> 02:03:09,866
broke under
a tremendous explosion.

1254
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:13,912
Rocks of extraordinary size
are being spewed out into the sea."

1255
02:03:39,563 --> 02:03:40,772
<i>Dammi una mano.</i>

1256
02:03:44,526 --> 02:03:47,112
<i>Piano, eh? Piano.</i>

1257
02:03:54,369 --> 02:03:55,787
<i>Passami vino.</i>

1258
02:03:55,871 --> 02:03:57,122
<i>Ecco.</i>

1259
02:03:57,205 --> 02:03:59,249
<i>Signora, beva, beva.</i>

1260
02:04:03,378 --> 02:04:05,297
Where's Alec?

1261
02:04:11,094 --> 02:04:15,766
Hans says Alec was thrown
from the altar stone

1262
02:04:17,476 --> 02:04:19,811
long before
we hit the water.

1263
02:04:23,857 --> 02:04:26,151
<i>Non Si preoccupi,
abbiamo lo scalino!</i>

1264
02:04:26,234 --> 02:04:28,070
I'm most grateful, ladies.

1265
02:04:28,153 --> 02:04:31,114
But my immediate need is not a ladder.
I need trousers!

1266
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:33,533
<i>- Che dice?</i>
- Pants!

1267
02:04:33,617 --> 02:04:35,285
Pantaloons!
Pantaloons!

1268
02:04:36,286 --> 02:04:38,246
<i>Oh, vuole pantalone!</i>

1269
02:04:38,330 --> 02:04:40,916
<i>Pantalone? Oh!</i>

1270
02:04:40,999 --> 02:04:42,292
Don't bring them
yourselves.

1271
02:04:42,376 --> 02:04:44,294
Send a friar, a monk.

1272
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:47,005
- Oh!
- Oh!

1273
02:04:47,089 --> 02:04:49,132
Oh!

1274
02:04:53,136 --> 02:04:54,971
Excuse me, ladies.

1275
02:04:57,641 --> 02:04:59,434
Excuse me.

1276
02:05:06,858 --> 02:05:10,445
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!

1277
02:05:10,529 --> 02:05:14,449
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!

1278
02:05:14,533 --> 02:05:16,785
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!

1279
02:05:16,868 --> 02:05:18,829
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!

1280
02:05:18,912 --> 02:05:21,581
Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!

1281
02:05:21,665 --> 02:05:23,500
Speech! Speech!

1282
02:05:26,503 --> 02:05:27,921
Hello, Scots!

1283
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:33,552
If these shouts of yours express some pleasure
that we've returned alive,

1284
02:05:33,635 --> 02:05:35,053
I thank you deeply.

1285
02:05:36,263 --> 02:05:41,059
However, if they're meant as praise
for a successful scientist,

1286
02:05:41,143 --> 02:05:42,519
I must disclaim that honor.

1287
02:05:42,602 --> 02:05:45,772
- No!
- No!

1288
02:05:46,690 --> 02:05:51,570
No. A scientist who cannot prove what
he has accomplished has accomplished nothing.

1289
02:05:51,653 --> 02:05:54,573
I have no records,
no shred of evidence.

1290
02:05:54,656 --> 02:05:57,534
I will never embarrass
this distinguished university

1291
02:05:57,617 --> 02:05:59,411
by asking
that it take my word.

1292
02:06:00,495 --> 02:06:02,664
Let me say only this.

1293
02:06:02,747 --> 02:06:04,583
300 years ago,

1294
02:06:04,666 --> 02:06:07,586
a daring man undertook
a perilous journey

1295
02:06:07,669 --> 02:06:09,504
and never came back.

1296
02:06:09,588 --> 02:06:11,631
We followed his path
and returned...

1297
02:06:11,715 --> 02:06:15,135
by the grace of God
and a heathen altar stone.

1298
02:06:15,844 --> 02:06:18,513
One day, someone else,

1299
02:06:18,597 --> 02:06:22,726
it may be you, my boy,
or your sons or grandsons

1300
02:06:22,809 --> 02:06:24,269
will pick up
where we left off.

1301
02:06:25,270 --> 02:06:26,855
This I know.

1302
02:06:26,938 --> 02:06:30,108
The spirit of man
cannot be stopped!

1303
02:06:36,072 --> 02:06:38,992
- Splendid, Oliver.
- Thank you.

1304
02:06:39,075 --> 02:06:42,537
Professor, here's someone
who wants to say good-bye.

1305
02:06:42,621 --> 02:06:44,164
His ship sails at 4:00.

1306
02:06:45,415 --> 02:06:48,793
Hans, old friend,
we never could have done without you.

1307
02:06:48,877 --> 02:06:51,087
He has a speech.

1308
02:06:51,796 --> 02:06:52,881
Uh...

1309
02:06:52,964 --> 02:06:56,051
Hello, sir. If you...

1310
02:06:56,134 --> 02:06:59,554
If you'll ever go
down there again,

1311
02:06:59,638 --> 02:07:02,432
the center Earth,
Hans will go too.

1312
02:07:03,141 --> 02:07:04,809
Thank you.

1313
02:07:06,102 --> 02:07:09,981
Did you get your injuries when
the volcano blew up, in the hot lava?

1314
02:07:10,065 --> 02:07:12,025
Oh, no. It happened in Edinburgh,
at our wedding.

1315
02:07:12,108 --> 02:07:16,112
He was in such a hurry leaving
the church he fell down the steps.

1316
02:07:16,196 --> 02:07:20,951
You poor wee bride,
after all that waiting,

1317
02:07:21,034 --> 02:07:22,661
it's been no marriage
for you at all.

1318
02:07:22,744 --> 02:07:25,539
You underestimate Alec.

1319
02:07:27,999 --> 02:07:32,045
I'm taking the night train to
London and then back to Stockholm.

1320
02:07:32,128 --> 02:07:34,714
Stockholm?
But you have a job to do right here.

1321
02:07:34,798 --> 02:07:35,507
I?

1322
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:37,259
I intend to write my memoirs.

1323
02:07:37,342 --> 02:07:40,178
You don't think I can remember
everything that happened alone.

1324
02:07:40,262 --> 02:07:43,181
Oh, I see.
What you need is a widow

1325
02:07:43,265 --> 02:07:46,351
who can jog your memory
and take dictation.

1326
02:07:46,434 --> 02:07:50,230
I suppose I'm to report every day from
9:00 till 12:00? From 2:00 to 6:00?

1327
02:07:50,313 --> 02:07:52,774
No. None of that nonsense.
You can stay in my house.

1328
02:07:54,526 --> 02:07:56,403
And what would
Edinburgh say?

1329
02:07:56,486 --> 02:08:00,740
It's one thing to spend one's days and
nights with a man under the earth,

1330
02:08:00,824 --> 02:08:03,868
another under one roof
in Scotland.

1331
02:08:03,952 --> 02:08:06,371
Well, uh,
what do you propose?

1332
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:10,417
Oh, that's not a word
I bandy about, Professor.

1333
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:12,919
What did I say?
Which word?

1334
02:08:13,003 --> 02:08:17,591
I thought it would
catch in your throat.

1335
02:08:18,508 --> 02:08:19,884
Uh, madam!

1336
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:22,053
Madam.
Oh, thank you.

1337
02:08:22,137 --> 02:08:23,388
Uh, Madam Göteborg!

1338
02:08:23,471 --> 02:08:25,223
Frau Göteborg. Carla!

1339
02:08:28,184 --> 02:08:30,228
Yes, Oliver?

1340
02:08:30,312 --> 02:08:31,980
Carla.

1341
02:08:33,982 --> 02:08:35,901
I warn you.

1342
02:08:36,401 --> 02:08:38,737
I'm wearing stays again.
