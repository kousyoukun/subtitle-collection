1
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,800
I've got to take a specimen of
this back to Edinburgh,

2
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,901
if it's the last thing
I do.

3
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,253
Unique.

4
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,755
Inexplicable.

5
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:46,259
Ready to go,
if that boy Alec

6
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:49,767
would be good enough
to appear.

7
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:52,268
Where the devil
is he?

8
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:17,728
It's a blind alley!

9
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,267
Keep back!

10
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,766
Professor!

11
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:15,809
Hans!

12
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:54,256
Ah!

13
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,503
Good God!

14
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,337
Aah!

15
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:12,501
Aah!

16
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:14,010
Oh. Aah!

17
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:22,218
Hold on to my arm.

18
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,879
My shoulder.

19
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,684
Hold on.

20
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,860
Oh, praise the Lord.

21
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:54,513
Oh!

22
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:55,712
Oh.

23
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:40,596
Alec.

24
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:52,206
Professor!

25
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:26,609
Hello!

26
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:28,270
Hello! Hello!

27
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:29,779
Hello! Hello!

28
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,781
Professor,
here I am!

29
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,909
- Here I am!
- Here I am!

30
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:37,079
Here I am!

31
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,331
Salt!

32
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:10,204
Ah!

33
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:28,184
Ah!

34
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,334
Oh!

35
00:09:57,922 --> 00:10:00,356
Alec!

36
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,353
Alec!

37
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,953
Alec!Alec!
Alec!

38
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:11,801
Professor, you can't
go on this way.

39
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:15,805
I've kept track of
the passage of days.

40
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,864
Try that channel
there.

41
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:19,807
We were there
yesterday.

42
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,310
We left marks.

43
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:23,312
He's not there.

44
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,814
I've got
to find him.

45
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:27,817
I'm responsible.

46
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:29,318
Oh.

47
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,994
I can see this
is a recent break.

48
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:42,327
Alec!

49
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,333
Alec!
Alec!Alec!

50
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:51,340
Can you hear me?

51
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,342
Can you
hear me?

52
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,344
Give us a sign!

53
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:57,346
Give us
a sign!

54
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,348
Alec, listen carefully.

55
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,852
When the echoes stop,
try to answer.

56
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,855
If you're injured,
make an effort.

57
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:09,791
Pick up a pebble
and scratch the rock.

58
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,794
We'll hear you.

59
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:14,296
Just give us a sign!

60
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:16,799
Give us
a sign!

61
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:34,817
A phosphorescent pool.

62
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:38,082
Strange grave
for a young Scot.

63
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:43,326
Professor,
there's no use.

64
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:46,329
How can I live
with myself?

65
00:11:46,397 --> 00:11:48,331
Accept his loss

66
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,335
like one soldier accepts
the loss of another.

67
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,337
You must continue.

68
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:57,340
You must go on with
the Lindenbrook Expedition.

69
00:11:57,408 --> 00:11:59,672
The Lindenbrook
Expedition.

70
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,176
Yes.

71
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,839
Go on with it.

72
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:07,042
It was his project,
as much as yours.

73
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:10,620
Yes.
You're right.

74
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,790
We will proceed,

75
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,292
but we won't
call it

76
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,294
the Lindenbrook
Expedition anymore.

77
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,296
From now on,

78
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,299
it's the Alec McEwen
Expedition.

79
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,839
No broken bones?

80
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,535
Ribs all right?

81
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,543
Good. Get up.

82
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:13,313
Down there,
food and water.

83
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:15,318
Refresh yourself.

84
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:19,822
So you've lost
your friends?

85
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,824
Just as well.

86
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:33,067
It's my servant.

87
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,331
Too much heat,
too much load,

88
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:40,343
too much fear.

89
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:41,844
You're younger.

90
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:44,847
You'll do
to carry my things.

91
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:48,043
I'm not your servant,
Count Saknussemm.

92
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,348
Pride? Rather
out of place here.

93
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:53,015
Eat, drink, and
pick up those things.

94
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,853
I'm in a hurry.

95
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:57,359
To steal
the professor's project?

96
00:13:57,428 --> 00:13:59,362
Steal? Listen,
young foreigner.

97
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,866
I don't have to steal
what belongs to me.

98
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:05,493
You're in
my worid now.

99
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:15,377
Stop!

100
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:17,914
I need someone to
carry my equipment!

101
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,644
You'll never find
your companions.

102
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:22,379
We need each other.

103
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:25,684
You found me.
My friends will, too.

104
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:28,384
You'll carry it with
one arm, not two!

105
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,903
A hail of bullets.

106
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:42,905
A remarkable echo

107
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,100
reverberating from
the rock chambers.

108
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,406
The last echo
will give us the direction.

109
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:57,420
166 degrees
south-southeast.

110
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,372
Alec!

111
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,408
Alec!

112
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:19,407
Alec.

113
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:22,879
Alec!

114
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:24,880
Alec!

115
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:27,382
We'd given you up,

116
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:29,385
but you're
alive, laddie.

117
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:31,387
You're alive!

118
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,654
Professor.
Carla.

119
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,888
Hans.

120
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:41,897
Just to see you!

121
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:46,402
Where was he?

122
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,405
I didn't think
he'd shoot,

123
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:51,065
but he did.

124
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:52,608
Of course I did.

125
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:55,270
What did you expect?

126
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:57,836
You are
trespassers here.

127
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,780
I own this domain.

128
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:05,850
You are also
the murderer of my husband.

129
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,892
I claimed my rights.
He would not listen.

130
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,451
In the name of
your great ancestor,

131
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,292
put down that
preposterous gun.

132
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:17,094
No harm will come if
you accept my terms.

133
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,761
You will go back
the way you came,

134
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:24,365
but leave equipment
I need and that man.

135
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,644
You won't listen
to a murderer.

136
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:31,146
Never interrupt
a murderer, madam.

137
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:34,116
I resent that
bourgeois classification.

138
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:36,152
I'll spare
your lives.

139
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,745
You have my word
of honor.

140
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:44,254
Give me
your hand on that.

141
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:47,121
Aah!

142
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,660
A bourgeois trick.

143
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:55,671
So sorry.

144
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:04,681
All right, before
we continue on our journey,

145
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:07,182
we must perform
a solemn duty.

146
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:09,617
We have
to hold court.

147
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:13,622
Here, hundreds
of kilometers

148
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,625
beneath the surface
of the earth,

149
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,627
we are the law.

150
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:21,630
The defendant stands accused
of one murder

151
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:24,132
and one act of mayhem.

152
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:27,136
I must ask you,
as jurors,

153
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:30,139
is the defendant
guilty or not guilty?

154
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:31,640
Guilty.

155
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,643
Guilty.

156
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,145
Hans.

157
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,158
Guilty.

158
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,664
Then the mandatory
sentence...

159
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:57,666
is death.

160
00:17:57,734 --> 00:18:00,498
There are
two bullets left.

161
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:03,165
Madam, please
explain to Hans.

162
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,108
We will follow the route
marked by the notches.

163
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:10,112
He will wait here
for 10 minutes,

164
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,375
then carry out
the sentence.

165
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:17,513
No, no, no.

166
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:20,022
I can carry
with my left hand.

167
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,682
Carry yourself
for a while.

168
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,385
That's all
we can expect.

169
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,993
Sir Oliver, there's
a slight problem.

170
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,399
Hans refuses
to shoot the count.

171
00:18:32,469 --> 00:18:35,529
What do you mean?
It's a court order.

172
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,631
His family's been loyal

173
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,142
to the Saknussemms
for generations.

174
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,541
He cannot touch the gun.

175
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:44,638
This is contempt
of court.

176
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,649
All right, Alec.

177
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:48,651
No, no,
Sir Oliver.

178
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:50,653
Don't look at me.

179
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:53,155
I couldn't
pull the trigger

180
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:55,157
with my left hand.

181
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,662
Oh, no.

182
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:02,665
I couldn't do it.

183
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,201
After all,
I'm a woman!

184
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,102
For weeks you've
denied your sex.

185
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:10,639
Now you
fall back on it.

186
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:13,107
I would say
the natural executioner

187
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:16,270
would be the leader
of the expedition.

188
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:19,110
We must face
the truth, sir.

189
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:21,116
We're much too civilized

190
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:25,120
to do away with
a fellow human being.

191
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:27,622
Should we
drag him along?

192
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:29,158
Feed him?

193
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,285
Stop fiddling
with those lamps!

194
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,634
What's he
jabbering about?

195
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:40,397
I'll tell you
what he's saying.

196
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,132
The lamps are
giving out.

197
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:47,336
The induction coils
have been corroded by the salt.

198
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:51,313
I insist we leave
here at once.

199
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:52,507
You insist!

200
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:00,155
He's bloody well right.

201
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:02,157
Let's be off.

202
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,605
Saknussemm's unfastened
himself from the rope again

203
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,003
and gone off.

204
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:18,166
What's the harm?

205
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:21,108
He'll be back when
it's time to eat.

206
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,506
The harm is he's
wasting a lamp.

207
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:56,163
Madam, will you
try your lamp, please?

208
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:07,147
It's dead.

209
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:08,649
Yours, Alec.

210
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,154
When these things
are gone,

211
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:19,160
they're really gone.

212
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:21,162
Madam,
make a final note

213
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,664
while there
is still light.

214
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:26,065
Let me.
My arm's well.

215
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:27,102
No need.

216
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:31,066
Covered another
92 kilometers.

217
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,598
Temperature
dropped seven degrees.

218
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:38,078
Surprisingly cooler
than anticipated.

219
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,615
The darkness is
closing about us.

220
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:43,584
This may be
our last entry.

221
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:53,628
Hans and I
can cut rope into torches.

222
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:55,630
That's a good idea.

223
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:57,632
What puzzles me

224
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,634
is that
Saknussemm's notches

225
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:01,636
keep pointing
our way.

226
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:04,138
What lamp
did he have?

227
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:07,108
Perhaps he didn't
require a lamp.

228
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:09,542
From here on,
neither do you, Sir Oliver.

229
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:11,341
Why don't you
turn it off?

230
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:15,584
Yes, just
switch it off.

231
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:25,089
Why,
it's miraculous.

232
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,764
Look at this.

233
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,105
What is it, sir?

234
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:39,607
A form of algae

235
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:41,609
with a property
of luminescence.

236
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:43,611
Light without heat.

237
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,647
A cool
chemical light.

238
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:48,115
You've seen fireflies
and glowworms

239
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:50,118
and forms of sea life

240
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:52,620
that generate
their own light?

241
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:55,282
The same principle
is involved here.

242
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:33,095
256th day...

243
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:37,064
the phenomenal winds

244
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:39,363
vanished as abruptly
as they came.

245
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:45,096
We are now in a stupendous
deposit of cinnabar.

246
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,109
What's that little mark
you make?

247
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,613
M.E.-
McEwen Expedition.

248
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:56,118
Whenever I've said
Lindenbrook Expedition,

249
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,119
you've written
McEwen Expedition?

250
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,122
May I remind you
that months ago,

251
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,125
you gave me explicit
orders to that effect?

252
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,627
You may not
remind me.

253
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,630
I don't wish your
correcting me incessantly.

254
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,632
Is that what
I'm doing?

255
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,634
You're doing it
with your looks,

256
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,636
with the posture
of your body.

257
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,935
Your entire presence is
a constant criticism of me.

258
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:19,269
I'm tired of it!

259
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:20,604
I've had enough!

260
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,472
You've had enough!

261
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:27,646
Let me tell you...

262
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:30,151
you dried-up walnut
of a man!

263
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,983
If anyone's had enough,
it's me!

264
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,181
It's I.

265
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:35,815
It's I! It's me!

266
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,621
It's Carla Goetaborg.

267
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:39,160
I quit!

268
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,162
I'm leaving!

269
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:46,167
May I send for
madam's horse and carriage?

270
00:24:55,244 --> 00:25:00,147
Well, at least you know
I have a temper.

271
00:25:00,216 --> 00:25:02,684
Alecwill
keep the charts.

272
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,185
Alec!

273
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,686
Alec!

274
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,814
Why can't he
stay around?

275
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,193
Aye aye aye aye
aye-o!

276
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:07,077
Mushrooms! A forest
of mushrooms.

277
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,117
They might be hundreds
of years old,

278
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:11,915
but the small ones
we can eat.

279
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:12,920
They're delicious!

280
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,092
To think they grew
without sun

281
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,355
this far
under the earth.

282
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,639
All the food
we can eat!

283
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,645
Ha ha ha!

284
00:26:36,712 --> 00:26:39,146
It's tougher
than leather.

285
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:41,547
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

286
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:44,643
We'll have new soles
for our shoes.

287
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:48,747
Ooh!

288
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:51,657
It's like
an oak tree!

289
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:35,603
Ah! Madam,
you're magnificent.

290
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:39,107
Mushroom steak,
mushroom soup, mushroom hash.

291
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:40,608
Let me say this-

292
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:44,112
If we'd had one more week
of that salted beef,

293
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,613
I would have perished.

294
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:48,115
Don't be too happy.

295
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,617
After some months
of this,

296
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,152
you'll want
salt beef again.

297
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,653
Yes. Months...months.

298
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:55,657
If we only knew
how many more.

299
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:58,660
There's no term
to the work of a scientist.

300
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:01,162
If you hadn't
been along,

301
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,666
this whole journey
would have been unbearable.

302
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:08,170
But that's not Professor
Lindenbrook's feeling.

303
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:09,898
It's mine.

304
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:13,066
You see, we have no sun...

305
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:17,078
and no moon...no stars,

306
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:19,273
but then you're here.

307
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:24,886
And what is the name
of the girl you love?

308
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,013
I beg your pardon?

309
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:30,252
The girl you love-
what's her name?

310
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:34,729
Jenny. But why would you
want to know that just now?

311
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,788
Oh, dear Alec.

312
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:39,801
There are times
when it's advisable

313
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:42,667
to jog
a young man's memory.

314
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:52,138
Professor!

315
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:57,986
Here's some hot mushroom porridge
for you, Sir Oliver.

316
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:14,102
I slept as I'd never
slept in Edinburgh.

317
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,604
No street noises,
no church bells,

318
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,608
no clatter of pans
from the kitchen.

319
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,110
I may move here
permanently.

320
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,442
What's our large friend
doing over there?

321
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,217
I don't know.
Special command of His Majesty.

322
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:38,283
Is that madman
still giving orders?

323
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,624
This is
his rest period.

324
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,630
When you fell asleep,

325
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,633
he went off
through the tunnel.

326
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:49,728
He came back and ordered
the mushrooms felled.

327
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,146
What in the worid

328
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:01,149
can he want
with all those?

329
00:30:28,677 --> 00:30:31,111
You've come
to ask me

330
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,114
why I didn't rest?

331
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:35,116
I don't sleep.

332
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:38,620
I hate those little
slashes of death.

333
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:40,621
It's a sea.

334
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:43,123
It's an ocean
with currents.

335
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:45,626
The ocean
of the underworid.

336
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:49,130
Some earthquake before
the beginning of history

337
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:51,632
cracked wide open
the great sea,

338
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,635
and, through the fissures,
poured this.

339
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:56,637
The fissures
closed again.

340
00:30:56,705 --> 00:31:00,141
No map ever recorded
the Saknussemm Ocean.

341
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:04,145
I so christened it
while you were asleep.

342
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:07,080
It's the prerogative
of the discoverer.

343
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:08,582
I congratulate you.

344
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:12,587
There will be no more
notches to follow.

345
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:15,590
That's why
you ordered a raft.

346
00:31:15,658 --> 00:31:16,716
I approve.

347
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:35,443
If I had my gun,
we'd have fresh meat.

348
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:36,978
That's what
he's saying!

349
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:38,513
He's a flesh-eater!

350
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:44,609
Can he swim?

351
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:46,120
No, thank God.

352
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:50,109
Ah!

353
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,264
Ah!

354
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,141
Aah!

355
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,641
Ahh!

356
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:41,984
The wind is blowing
down the street.

357
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,684
Here...

358
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:47,489
I brought you
some nice apples.

359
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,498
I wonder if it's cold
where they are.

360
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,193
Where they are...

361
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:54,701
indeed!

362
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:56,862
Are they anyplace?

363
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:17,522
McEwen, put that toy away
and take over the rudder.

364
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,924
Yes, sir.

365
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:21,963
I didn't say
throw it away!

366
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,463
It blew
out of my hand!

367
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,831
My watch!

368
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,399
Save the instruments!

369
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:33,339
My ring!

370
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,773
My wedding
ring!

371
00:36:34,843 --> 00:36:37,778
A field of force
that snatches gold away.

372
00:36:37,846 --> 00:36:39,780
This is it. This is it!

373
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:41,782
The junction
of magnetic forces

374
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,114
from the North
to the South Pole...

375
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:46,346
the center of the earth!

376
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,126
Aah!

377
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:56,254
Aah!

378
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:58,128
Hang on!

379
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:11,278
Hold on
to your rope, Alec!

380
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,856
Aah!

381
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,828
No! Aah!

382
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,572
Is everyone here?

383
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:17,611
Madam Goetaborg,

384
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,112
Alec...

385
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,671
Hans.

386
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:26,483
Gertrude.

387
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,648
And His Highness
over there.

388
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:37,764
So the expedition
with all the names

389
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:39,857
ends like this.

390
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,561
We're alive,
aren't we?

391
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:45,868
After all, we did hit
the center of the earth.

392
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,567
It hit us, laddie.

393
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:58,145
He probably wants to know
where we go next.

394
00:38:59,654 --> 00:39:02,088
Tired minds
don't plan well.

395
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:04,125
Sleep first,
plan later.

396
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:11,589
When I refused
to eat my porridge

397
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:14,100
when I was a boy,

398
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:18,105
my mother used to say,
"Oliver, the day may come

399
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:20,607
when you'll very much
want that porridge."

400
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,812
Are you surprised
that I had a mother?

401
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:30,282
I was thinking
how proud she'd be

402
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:34,651
of that little boy
who wouldn't eat his porridge.

403
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,446
Here, duck.

404
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,950
Here, duck.

405
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,623
Gertrude!

406
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:55,928
Gertrude!

407
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,205
Gertrude!

408
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,442
Gertrude!

409
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,952
Gertrude!

410
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:28,465
Gertrude! Gertrude!

411
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:30,231
Gertrude!

412
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,806
Hans!

413
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,405
Hans!

414
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:24,454
Why do you look
at me like that?

415
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,686
Hans!

416
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:31,664
I needed food,
so I took it.

417
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:35,225
Professor, tell your man
to calm himself.

418
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,294
I won't engage
in a dispute

419
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:39,397
about
a slaughtered duck.

420
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,463
Professor!

421
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:41,803
Stop him!

422
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:43,844
Stop this fool!

423
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:44,843
Hans!

424
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:45,970
Hans!

425
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,085
You ingrates!

426
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,685
What can you do
without me?

427
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:05,665
Only I can show you the way
out of this, my realm.

428
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:06,791
Look out!

429
00:43:06,868 --> 00:43:09,302
Aah!

430
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:42,048
This is
the sunken city.

431
00:43:42,116 --> 00:43:44,550
After 5,000 years,

432
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:48,577
men behold a fragment
of the lostAtlantis.

433
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,067
All we know about it
comes from the Greek.

434
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:03,569
The floor
of the sea opened up

435
00:44:03,637 --> 00:44:07,300
and swallowed the whole
island of Atlantis.

436
00:44:09,977 --> 00:44:12,502
This must have been
the market square.

437
00:44:14,348 --> 00:44:15,508
Professor!

438
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:20,577
Professor, this looks like
some sort of inn.

439
00:44:20,654 --> 00:44:25,091
This is an inn,
an eating place, certainly.

440
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:27,093
Eating...what a word.

441
00:44:27,161 --> 00:44:30,653
What a wonderful word.

442
00:44:30,731 --> 00:44:32,858
Well, we've
learned one thing

443
00:44:32,933 --> 00:44:36,266
about the inhabitants
of Atlantis-

444
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:39,306
they ate oysters.

445
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:55,020
Stale bread.

446
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:58,024
We must speak
to the baker.

447
00:44:58,092 --> 00:44:59,024
Madam!

448
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:00,025
Madam!

449
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:02,521
Ja?

450
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:09,035
He's asking if that was
a temple to their god?

451
00:45:09,103 --> 00:45:11,367
Yes, I'm
sure it is.

452
00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:15,908
It's some sort
of altar stone

453
00:45:15,976 --> 00:45:18,536
where the
sacred flame burned.

454
00:45:18,612 --> 00:45:20,546
It's serpentine,
isn't it?

455
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:23,048
Exactly.
A massive form of asbestos.

456
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:24,550
At a moment like this,

457
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:28,918
I have no pad and pencil
to record this!

458
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:31,013
Ah!

459
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:38,061
Turn around, madam.
Don't look.

460
00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:39,360
What is it?

461
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:44,795
The greatArne Saknussemm,
I presume.

462
00:45:44,872 --> 00:45:49,138
So this is
as far as he came.

463
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,647
Say " How do you do"
to a brave man.

464
00:45:53,714 --> 00:45:56,148
He must have
dragged himself

465
00:45:56,217 --> 00:45:58,151
with a broken leg.

466
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:00,153
Look at that tibia.

467
00:46:00,221 --> 00:46:03,156
There is nothing edible
in there.

468
00:46:03,224 --> 00:46:04,657
Why not?

469
00:46:04,725 --> 00:46:08,991
The Chinese eat eggs
over 400 years old.

470
00:46:09,063 --> 00:46:10,325
Gunpowder.

471
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:12,282
Professor, look
at his right hand.

472
00:46:12,317 --> 00:46:14,167
Professor, look
at his right hand.

473
00:46:14,235 --> 00:46:16,226
It's pointing somewhere.

474
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:21,173
To that shaft
over there.

475
00:46:58,779 --> 00:47:03,648
Of course! This is what
the pointing finger meant!

476
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:06,151
This is the way up.

477
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,656
He couldn't make it,
but we can.

478
00:47:09,723 --> 00:47:12,157
This is a volcanic chimney.

479
00:47:12,226 --> 00:47:13,716
The violent updraft means

480
00:47:13,794 --> 00:47:15,728
a direct hatchway
to the surface.

481
00:47:15,796 --> 00:47:16,888
We can climb up!

482
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,397
Madam,
explain to Hans.

483
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:22,162
Let him venture up
and reconnoiter.

484
00:47:22,236 --> 00:47:25,171
The updraft
can't carry him away.

485
00:47:47,428 --> 00:47:48,861
We'd roll up
our sleeves,

486
00:47:48,929 --> 00:47:50,362
if we had any.

487
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:53,127
We mustn't hope
for too much.

488
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,135
We'll have to provide
some kind of light.

489
00:47:56,203 --> 00:47:59,468
And food.
I'll go look around.

490
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,475
I'll comb every inch
of Atlantis.

491
00:48:32,906 --> 00:48:35,340
If we only had
some shears,

492
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:37,343
we could
cut it off.

493
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:38,343
Could we?

494
00:48:54,595 --> 00:48:55,857
Aye-aye!

495
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:58,124
Aye-aye!
Aye-aye!

496
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:01,366
Flints!

497
00:49:01,435 --> 00:49:03,369
I found some flints.

498
00:49:03,437 --> 00:49:05,200
Good lad.

499
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:09,002
We won't be walking
in darkness.

500
00:49:09,076 --> 00:49:10,168
Madam!

501
00:49:21,955 --> 00:49:24,890
I wish I had
better news for you.

502
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:27,984
It gives every indication
of a perfect passage upward,

503
00:49:28,062 --> 00:49:31,691
straighter than the one
we descended, but...

504
00:49:31,765 --> 00:49:33,665
But? But?

505
00:49:33,734 --> 00:49:35,725
There's an obstacle,

506
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:39,739
a gigantic block of stone
obstructs the passageway.

507
00:49:39,807 --> 00:49:43,243
Hans said only a landslide
could ever move it.

508
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,297
No. Let him be.

509
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:12,305
If all his hopes
hadn't been so high.

510
00:50:16,377 --> 00:50:17,537
Alec!

511
00:50:17,611 --> 00:50:20,171
Yes, sir?

512
00:50:20,247 --> 00:50:22,147
Arne Saknussemm's
haversack.

513
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:23,706
Get it!

514
00:50:23,784 --> 00:50:26,150
If God is with us,

515
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,654
and that gunpowder
has kept its ginger,

516
00:50:28,722 --> 00:50:32,317
we'll make that
landslide ourselves.

517
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:18,337
Now, my wonderful
companions,

518
00:51:18,405 --> 00:51:19,872
you realize, I hope,

519
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,374
that we're taking
an enormous chance,

520
00:51:22,443 --> 00:51:24,377
but it's our only chance.

521
00:51:24,445 --> 00:51:28,313
I guarantee that this will
blow up the obstructing rock.

522
00:51:28,382 --> 00:51:30,247
Whether
the surrounding rocks

523
00:51:30,317 --> 00:51:32,308
will take
the disturbance lightly,

524
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:33,819
that I cannot guarantee.

525
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:38,153
For protection,
get into the altar stone.

526
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,016
Dear God, ruler of
heaven and earth-

527
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:08,180
Don't set any limit
to his realm, laddie.

528
00:52:08,255 --> 00:52:10,155
God of the universe,

529
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:12,818
we are in
thy merciful hands.

530
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:36,371
Look out!

531
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,917
Run, Professor!
A monster!

532
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:43,356
Let me go!

533
00:53:34,942 --> 00:53:36,671
We started
an earthquake.

534
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:45,714
Aah!

535
00:54:44,378 --> 00:54:47,074
The lava
is pushing us up!

536
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:18,909
It's an earthquake
of unusual magnitude!

537
00:55:18,979 --> 00:55:21,004
More likely, it's
a volcanic eruption.

538
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:22,912
Listen to this-

539
00:55:22,983 --> 00:55:25,417
"Stromboli, Italy,
first eyewitness report.

540
00:55:25,485 --> 00:55:27,919
"The capsule
of the dead volcano

541
00:55:27,988 --> 00:55:30,354
"broke under
a tremendous explosión.

542
00:55:30,424 --> 00:55:31,857
" Rocks of
extraordinary size

543
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:34,792
are being spewed out
into the sea."

544
00:55:59,786 --> 00:56:01,720
Dammi la mano.

545
00:56:05,459 --> 00:56:08,053
Piano, eh? Piano.

546
00:56:15,302 --> 00:56:16,735
Passa mi vino.

547
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:18,065
Ecco.

548
00:56:18,138 --> 00:56:20,732
Signora,
beva, beva.

549
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:26,176
Where's Alec?

550
00:56:31,585 --> 00:56:36,682
Hans says Alecwas thrown
from the altar stone

551
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:40,523
long before
we hit the water.

552
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:47,089
Non si preoccupi,
abbiamo lo scalino!

553
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,493
My immediate need
is not a ladder.

554
00:56:50,563 --> 00:56:52,053
I need trousers.

555
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:54,532
Che dice?

556
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:56,228
Pantaloons!
Pantaloons!

557
00:56:56,302 --> 00:56:59,271
Oh, vuole
pantalone!

558
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:01,204
Pantalone? Oh!

559
00:57:01,274 --> 00:57:03,265
Don't bring them
yourselves.

560
00:57:03,343 --> 00:57:05,174
Send a friar, a monk.

561
00:57:08,014 --> 00:57:09,879
- Oh!
- Oh!

562
00:57:13,353 --> 00:57:15,287
Excuse me, ladies.

563
00:57:18,024 --> 00:57:19,685
Excuse me.

564
00:57:27,867 --> 00:57:30,495
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!

565
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:33,596
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!

566
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:36,403
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!

567
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:39,741
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!

568
00:57:39,812 --> 00:57:40,904
Speech! Speech!

569
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,447
Speech! Speech!

570
00:57:42,515 --> 00:57:44,380
Speech! Speech!

571
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:48,920
Hello, Scots!

572
00:57:48,988 --> 00:57:50,922
If these shouts of yours

573
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:53,925
express some pleasure
that we've returned alive,

574
00:57:53,993 --> 00:57:55,426
I thank you deeply.

575
00:57:55,495 --> 00:57:59,932
However, if they're
meant as praise

576
00:57:59,999 --> 00:58:01,432
for a successful scientist,

577
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:03,435
I must disclaim that honor.

578
00:58:03,503 --> 00:58:06,063
- No!
- No!

579
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:10,439
No. A scientist who cannot prove
what he has accomplished

580
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,943
has accomplished nothing.

581
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:14,946
I have no records,
no shred of evidence.

582
00:58:15,014 --> 00:58:17,448
I will never embarrass
this distinguished university

583
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:20,213
by asking
that it take my word.

584
00:58:20,286 --> 00:58:22,948
Let me say only this.

585
00:58:23,022 --> 00:58:24,956
300 years ago,

586
00:58:25,024 --> 00:58:27,959
a daring man undertook
a perilous journey

587
00:58:28,027 --> 00:58:29,892
and never came back.

588
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:32,397
We followed his path
and returned...

589
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:36,026
by God's grace
and a heathen altar stone.

590
00:58:36,102 --> 00:58:38,900
One day, someone else,

591
00:58:38,972 --> 00:58:42,999
it may be you, my boy,
or your sons or grandsons

592
00:58:43,076 --> 00:58:45,169
will pick up
where we left off.

593
00:58:45,245 --> 00:58:47,236
This I know.

594
00:58:47,313 --> 00:58:50,248
The spirit of man
cannot be stopped!

595
00:58:56,389 --> 00:58:58,084
Splendid,
Oliver.

596
00:58:58,157 --> 00:58:59,351
Thank you.

597
00:58:59,425 --> 00:59:02,917
Professor, here's someone
who wants to say goodbye.

598
00:59:02,996 --> 00:59:05,055
His ship
sails at 4:00.

599
00:59:05,131 --> 00:59:06,428
Hans, old friend,

600
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:09,434
we never could have
done without you.

601
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:11,993
He has a speech.

602
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:13,265
Uh...

603
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:16,433
Hello, sir.
If you...

604
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:19,945
if you'll ever go
down there again,

605
00:59:20,013 --> 00:59:21,605
the center earth,

606
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:23,342
Hans will go, too.

607
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:25,714
Thank you.

608
00:59:25,785 --> 00:59:29,221
Did you get your injuries
when the volcano blew up,

609
00:59:29,289 --> 00:59:30,756
in the hot lava?

610
00:59:30,823 --> 00:59:32,381
No. It happened
at our wedding.

611
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:34,892
He was hurrying
from the church

612
00:59:34,961 --> 00:59:37,020
and fell
down the steps.

613
00:59:37,096 --> 00:59:40,190
You poor wee bride,
after all that waiting,

614
00:59:40,266 --> 00:59:43,565
it's been no marriage
for you at all.

615
00:59:43,636 --> 00:59:45,900
You underestimate
Alec.

616
00:59:48,274 --> 00:59:50,401
I'm taking the night train
to London

617
00:59:50,476 --> 00:59:51,909
then back
to Stockholm.

618
00:59:51,978 --> 00:59:55,072
But you have a job
to do right here.

619
00:59:55,148 --> 00:59:56,410
I?

620
00:59:56,482 --> 00:59:57,915
I'm writing my memoirs,

621
00:59:57,984 --> 01:00:00,350
but I can't remember
everything that happened.

622
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,218
I see.
You need a widow

623
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:07,225
who can jog your memory
and take dictation.

624
01:00:07,293 --> 01:00:11,127
I suppose I'm to report
every day from 9:00 to 12:00?

625
01:00:11,197 --> 01:00:13,688
No. You can stay
in my house.

626
01:00:13,766 --> 01:00:15,666
What would
Edinburgh say?

627
01:00:15,735 --> 01:00:21,696
It's one thing to be with
a man under the earth,

628
01:00:21,774 --> 01:00:24,743
and another under one roof
in Scotland.

629
01:00:24,811 --> 01:00:27,279
Well, uh.
What do you propose?

630
01:00:27,347 --> 01:00:31,306
That's not a word
I bandy about, Professor.

631
01:00:31,384 --> 01:00:33,875
What did I say?
Which word?

632
01:00:33,953 --> 01:00:38,447
I thought it would
catch in your throat.

633
01:00:39,525 --> 01:00:40,890
Uh, madam!

634
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,892
Madam-

635
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:43,053
Oh, thank you.

636
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:44,289
Uh, Madam Goetaborg!

637
01:00:44,364 --> 01:00:46,093
Madam Goetaborg. Carla!

638
01:00:48,768 --> 01:00:51,134
Yes, Oliver?

639
01:00:51,204 --> 01:00:52,831
Carla.

640
01:00:54,974 --> 01:00:56,908
I warn you.

641
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:59,740
I'm wearing stays again.

642
01:01:01,748 --> 01:01:05,946
Here's to the prof
of geology

643
01:01:06,018 --> 01:01:10,216
Master of all
natural history

644
01:01:10,289 --> 01:01:12,780
Rare boy, he

645
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:15,123
And rare boys, we

646
01:01:15,194 --> 01:01:19,358
To know such
a big curiosity

647
01:01:19,432 --> 01:01:22,060
To the prof,
aye aye aye aye

648
01:01:22,135 --> 01:01:24,228
To the best,
aye aye aye aye

649
01:01:24,303 --> 01:01:26,396
To the next,
aye aye aye aye

650
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:28,030
Aye aye aye aye

651
01:01:28,107 --> 01:01:32,441
Aye
