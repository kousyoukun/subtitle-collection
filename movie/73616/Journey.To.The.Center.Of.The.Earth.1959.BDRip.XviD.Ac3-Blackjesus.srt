00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000


1
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,002
Congratulations.

2
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,634
Thank you.

3
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,351
It's a wonderful article
in the paper about you.

4
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,533
Good morning,
Sir Oliver.

5
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,800
Long article about you
on page two.

6
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,434
Is there?

7
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:38,248
They made a mistake
about your age.

8
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:53,886
Paper!

9
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,518
Paper!

10
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:57,793
Paper!

11
00:02:57,862 --> 00:02:58,755
Paper!

12
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,902
It's such an honor
for Edinburgh.

13
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,943
I cannot take
your money.

14
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:06,908
Thank you.

15
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:07,956
Paper! Paper!

16
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,983
Congratulations,
Professor.

17
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:13,455
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

18
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:14,863
I'm sorry.

19
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:18,309
Since you've been
created a knight,

20
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,716
I've given your
students a holiday...

21
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:23,365
a day for a knight,
so to speak.

22
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:26,247
First, there's to
be a presentation.

23
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:30,369
Will the lad
of Glen Darrick step forward?

24
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,957
In gratitude
for the knowledge

25
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,362
you have
imparted to us...

26
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:37,281
That's enough
obituary prose.

27
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:41,179
An inkwell, I presume.

28
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,035
A very handsome thing.

29
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:44,956
Hellish to dust.

30
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:48,531
I thank you all from
the bottom of my heart,

31
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:51,186
and now, off to the playing
fields, all of you!

32
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,710
- Yay!
- Yay!

33
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,671
Ah.

34
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:14,849
It cost £4.17.

35
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,570
I was on the committee
that made the collection.

36
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,784
I thank you,
McEwen.

37
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,543
£5 was subscribed.

38
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:22,303
That left
three shillings.

39
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,745
You won't give me
the change?

40
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,664
I expended it on this,

41
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,800
a little extra token
I thought you might fancy.

42
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:31,895
I saw it in
a curiosity shop in Glasgow.

43
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,540
It whispered, " Buy me
for Professor Lindenbrook."

44
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,071
What did you reply?

45
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:40,918
I said, "Only if you can
be bought for three shillings."

46
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:42,291
I argued with the owner.

47
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:43,883
It's lava,
of course.

48
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,810
But exceptionally
heavy.

49
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,946
It could serve
as a paperweight.

50
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:49,805
Do you like it,
Professor?

51
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:51,247
It's a scholar's choice.

52
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:53,929
Where are you
eating tonight?

53
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:57,541
Oh, this being Tuesday,
I'm not eating.

54
00:05:57,613 --> 00:05:58,921
Oh?

55
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:02,334
It's healthy to eat
every other night.

56
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,196
Be at my house at 8:00.

57
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,506
I'm entertaining
some faculty.

58
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,841
I don't think I could.

59
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,152
What's the matter,
McEwen?

60
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,909
You used to visit
my house regularly.

61
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,833
Do those frayed cuffs
worry you?

62
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:16,191
My other shirt
is at the wash.

63
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,661
8:00 sharp!

64
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:18,870
We're scientists.

65
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:21,459
That's one society where
frayed cuffs don't matter.

66
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,741
We've all had them.

67
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:24,599
Yes, Sir Oliver.

68
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,519
8:00.

69
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:30,357
Lava?

70
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,908
I swear there's
something inside.

71
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,162
There's Uncle now,
Kirsty.

72
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:09,082
And high time,
too!

73
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:13,557
Ohh!

74
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:16,436
I thought it was
Uncle Oliver.

75
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,315
Nothing I'm wearing
belongs to me.

76
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:20,754
Good evening,
Miss Jenny.

77
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,194
Good evening,
Alec McEwen.

78
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,632
I'm early.

79
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:26,510
I didn't know
you were coming.

80
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:29,388
Your uncle
ordered me to come.

81
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:30,533
Where is he?

82
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,491
He's never been late
like this.

83
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:36,098
To return to the subject
of my clothes,

84
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,942
they belong to the lad
of Glen Darrick.

85
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:43,713
"Don't go to dinner
dressed like that," he said.

86
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,592
I went
to take my bath.

87
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,348
When I returned,

88
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:51,316
my clothes were gone
and these substituted.

89
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:54,388
I have no claim to
the Glen Darrick tartan.

90
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:57,143
You've explained
your magnificence.

91
00:07:57,212 --> 00:08:00,504
Kirsty, there will be
one more guest.

92
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,341
I’ll seat you between
the dean and the rector.

93
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,218
Couldn't I sit
next to you?

94
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:09,138
Certainly not.

95
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,536
I notice
a certain harshness

96
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,933
in your attitude
toward me.

97
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:20,161
What do you expect when it takes
a command to bring you here?

98
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:23,529
Miss Jenny, why should
I torture myself?

99
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:27,366
Two years more I have to study
for my master's degree,

100
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,284
then four more as
a laboratory assistant.

101
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,730
Then there's the money
I must repay my relatives.

102
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,518
You are very logical,
Mr. McEwen.

103
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:38,397
It's the logic
of an empty purse.

104
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,317
How like a Scotsman!

105
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:41,690
I am a Scotsman.

106
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:45,050
I know one who didn't even
have a purse.

107
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:46,968
His name was
Robert Burns.

108
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,845
Do you know
what he said?

109
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,884
Miss Jenny, the time
of poetry is over.

110
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,640
If this is true,
Alec McEwen,

111
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:59,439
what are you doing with
your hand on my knee?

112
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,879
Miss Jenny...

113
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:02,798
Just wait in there.

114
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:05,195
Kirsty, I'll set
the extra place.

115
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,667
Is there something
you want?

116
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,586
A key is stuck.

117
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,505
But that's impossible.

118
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,382
It was just tuned
last month.

119
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:25,821
Which one?

120
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:28,220
This one.
Can't you see?

121
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:29,658
No, I can't.

122
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:32,024
You can see
I'm unhappy.

123
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:34,936
You know
how I've felt

124
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:38,773
ever since that first day
I saw you.

125
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:40,909
You looked
like spring.

126
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,716
Miss Jenny, set the table.

127
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:07,357
Mr. McEwen is fixing
a stuck key.

128
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:17,082
Shh.

129
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:32,393
Miss Jenny,
you're crying.

130
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,684
I bent over the goose...
the fumes.

131
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,710
Good evening,
Miss Jenny.

132
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:45,271
Good evening, gentlemen.

133
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,678
We were just worrying about
Professor Lindenbrook.

134
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:49,432
We were.
Isn't he with you?

135
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:51,356
Isn't he here?

136
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:52,947
No.

137
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:01,523
Careful it doesn't
go too high, Paisley.

138
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,271
It's just about
the limit now.

139
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:08,137
I gave no permission
for visitors!

140
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:11,139
Oh, it's you, McEwen.

141
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:13,220
Uncle Oliver,
your guests are waiting.

142
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:16,257
If you don't come,
the goose will spoil...

143
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:17,854
Oh, goose,
goose, goose.

144
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:19,302
Tell him, Alec.

145
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,536
This lava
is 1 in 10 million.

146
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,939
I've been at it
all day.

147
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,213
No pause
for lunch or tea.

148
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:27,136
You've had three semesters
of petrology.

149
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:30,331
From which volcano could
this lava have emerged?

150
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,381
Fujiyama?

151
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:32,348
No.

152
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:33,788
Mt. Etna?

153
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,227
Very close.
The Mediterranean.

154
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:37,625
The Lipari Islands
near Italy.

155
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,697
But their lava
is light.

156
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,459
That's what
stumped me

157
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,381
because inside
must be something

158
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:45,779
the weight of the heaviest rock
in existence.

159
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:47,699
That would be
Icelandic peridotite.

160
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:48,657
Precisely.

161
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,097
There's a piece
chipped off.

162
00:12:50,163 --> 00:12:51,339
By me.

163
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,318
What's
the rock inside?

164
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:55,114
Icelandic peridotite,
naturally.

165
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:58,181
When I saw this,
I stopped chipping.

166
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:01,098
There's some marks
on the surface.

167
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,648
It looks like a letter
or notches.

168
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:07,647
Three notches made
by the hand of man.

169
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:10,531
But how could
a rock from Iceland

170
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:15,034
possibly pop out of
a volcano across the world?

171
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:16,598
What's your conclusion?

172
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:19,321
Science does not
jump to conclusions.

173
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:21,723
Science is not
a guessing game.

174
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,308
We'll melt off
the crust of lava.

175
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,327
Mr. Paisley.

176
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,692
Add 10 cc of aqua regia.

177
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,611
Not too fast now.

178
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:37,970
I shall write to Professor
Goetaborg of Stockholm on this.

179
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:40,846
He's the world's leading
authority on volcanoes.

180
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,114
How long
will this take?

181
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:45,003
A typically
female question.

182
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:47,881
Melting lava takes
maybe two hours,

183
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:49,801
maybe four hours.

184
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,426
Two hours?
Four hours?

185
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,609
Maybe
the whole night.

186
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,572
Who cares?

187
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,464
Jenny.

188
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,326
Are you all right?

189
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,820
That was entirely
my fault.

190
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:22,925
I don't know how it
could have happened.

191
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,343
Mr. Paisley, by your slip
you've rendered

192
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:29,198
an inestimable service
to science.

193
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:33,579
Alec!

194
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:34,691
See this?

195
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:36,617
What would
you call it?

196
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:39,300
As you said,
it's a manmade object.

197
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,613
It looks like a top,

198
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:43,013
a surveyor's instrument,
a plumb bob.

199
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:45,531
It is
a plumb bob.

200
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:47,937
There are letters
on it.

201
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:50,815
It's an inscription,
a message, perhaps.

202
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:54,653
Can you make out
what it says, Professor?

203
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,051
It's in some
Nordic tongue.

204
00:14:57,117 --> 00:14:59,929
The hand that
wrote this trembled.

205
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,848
Perhaps it was
a dying hand.

206
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:04,115
Was it written
in paint? Ink?

207
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:05,676
Perhaps blood.

208
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,125
Possibly.

209
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,044
Look at this side, sir!

210
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,962
A signature!

211
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:14,473
Arne Saknussemm.

212
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:16,453
Arne Saknussemm!

213
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:20,071
Will you take me
home now, Uncle Oliver,

214
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:23,270
or do I have to
go alone?

215
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:25,321
Alone.

216
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:26,312
Alone!

217
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,678
It's unthinkable,
but it must be true.

218
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,085
A man took tools

219
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:34,402
and went where no human being
has ever set foot...

220
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,248
alone into the interior
of the earth. Alone.

221
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:39,200
Who? What is he
talking about?

222
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:40,669
Arne Saknussemm,
the Icelandic scientist.

223
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:42,556
The greatest
of his day.

224
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:44,954
He was laughed at
when he claimed

225
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:47,353
there was a world
down below.

226
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,231
The laughter stopped
when he disappeared,

227
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:52,150
never to be
heard from...

228
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:53,775
until tonight.

229
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:02,223
Get out of here,
woman!

230
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:04,621
I don't want any tea!

231
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:06,541
I only want my post.

232
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:07,849
Don't shout at me!

233
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:10,729
I can shout
just as loud as you!

234
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:14,370
For two weeks,
you haven't eaten or slept.

235
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,130
Out, woman!

236
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,532
Here's your post,
Uncle Oliver.

237
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:28,062
Another day,
and still nothing!

238
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:30,014
Can you believe that?
No answer.

239
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,850
And where is Alec McEwen?

240
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,289
At the university.

241
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:36,728
How long does it take

242
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,647
to get a letter from
Stockholm to England?

243
00:16:39,672 --> 00:16:41,263
Answer the bell.

244
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:46,193
We have to speak
to Sir Oliver.

245
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,591
Don't tell us
he's busy.

246
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:51,274
Callers? That's
all I need.

247
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,822
Oliver, we all know your
reputation for rudeness.

248
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:57,225
You're also
a conscientious man.

249
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:00,606
But you've skipped
every lecture for two weeks.

250
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:02,655
I'm involved in
something important.

251
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:04,767
More important
than our university?

252
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,422
Something any university
would envy us.

253
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,866
Ah, yes!
Ha ha!

254
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:10,010
You laugh!

255
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:14,106
What does the name
Arne Saknussemm mean to you?

256
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:16,760
Saknussemm, Saknussemm.

257
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:20,887
Didn't he write about
the lost city of Atlantis?

258
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,809
That was
his early career.

259
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:25,458
He's famous for
his study of volcanoes.

260
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:28,341
Out of a volcano
came this message from him.

261
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:30,739
It lay unnoticed
for 100 years

262
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:33,137
until picked up
by some peasant,

263
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:36,136
gathered dust in a curiosity shop
until it came to me.

264
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,542
Here is a translation
of the words.

265
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:41,901
"I'm dying, but my life's work
must not be lost.

266
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:44,778
"Whoever descends into the crater
of Sneffels Yocul

267
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,697
"can reach the center
of the earth.

268
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,136
I did it.
Arne Saknussemm."

269
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:49,095
Center of the earth?

270
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:50,087
Sneffels
Yocul?

271
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,288
That's an extinct volcano
in Iceland.

272
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,447
According to this, it
must lead to an unknown region.

273
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:57,595
But this is
sheer fantasy.

274
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,520
You haven't heard
all of it.

275
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:00,762
There's a postscriptum.

276
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:04,312
"At sunrise on
the last day of May,

277
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,195
the mountain Scartaris
will point the path."

278
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:08,753
What do you say now?

279
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:10,614
I'm more mystified
than ever.

280
00:18:10,682 --> 00:18:11,696
Scartaris?

281
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,939
Scartaris is a mountain
peak near the volcano.

282
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,275
This is
a student's hoax.

283
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:18,163
Wait a second,
rector.

284
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,561
Let's not take
that tone.

285
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:22,480
Let's assume
it's authentic.

286
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:24,399
Isn't the correct
procedure

287
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:27,277
to submit a paper
to the university officially?

288
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:29,675
You must consult
other experts.

289
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,594
This needs
verification.

290
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,514
Here is my paper.

291
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,872
I've written to
the foremost authority in Europe.

292
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:38,113
The Royal
Geological Society?

293
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,393
More eminent still.

294
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:41,184
Professor Goetaborg
of Stockholm.

295
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,586
Oh? And what
does he say?

296
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:45,983
I haven't
received his reply.

297
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,382
I've written
to him twice!

298
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:51,261
Well, then, I suggest
we relax on the matter

299
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:54,139
until your famous correspondent
sees fit to answer you.

300
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:57,497
Meanwhile, we could do
with some tea.

301
00:18:57,563 --> 00:19:00,856
I know you two
think I'm daft.

302
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,773
Think whatever
you want.

303
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,171
Jenny, tea!

304
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,407
When did you
get here?

305
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:09,482
Just this moment,
Sir Oliver.

306
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:11,407
Look.

307
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:13,446
It's
from Stockholm.

308
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:24,359
He's got his letter
from Stockholm.

309
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:27,618
Did you see the shine
in his eyes?

310
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:29,060
There'll never
be a better moment.

311
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,024
I’ll tell him about
our feelings for each other.

312
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:33,472
He'll say yes
almost inadvertently.

313
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,870
What if he says no
advertently?

314
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:39,230
You'll see how firm
my voice can be

315
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:42,106
when I speak
of you.

316
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:53,233
Blast
and damnation!

317
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:55,055
That devil!
Blast it!

318
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,648
What is it?

319
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:59,371
Don't keep us
in the dark.

320
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,814
Bad news,
sir?

321
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,733
I am stricken.

322
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,610
The University of Stockholm
informs me

323
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:08,488
that Professor Goetaborg
has vanished from Sweden.

324
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,408
His disappearance
follows closely the date

325
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:14,179
when my communication
must have reached him...

326
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,620
with all my material.

327
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:18,979
He evidently didn't think it
important enough to answer.

328
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:21,082
Or too important.

329
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:25,820
McEwen, find out when
the next ship leaves for Iceland.

330
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:29,495
I will not be beaten
to my goal.

331
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,254
What is your goal?

332
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:33,177
You heard
Saknussemm's message.

333
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:35,095
Oliver, you're
seriously ill.

334
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:36,534
I am
seriously well.

335
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,453
Don't wait.
I said hurry.

336
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,372
I must
start packing.

337
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:41,811
To go where?

338
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,729
To Iceland,
to begin with.

339
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:45,168
And then?

340
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:47,088
Where Arne Saknussemm went.

341
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:48,527
Oliver!

342
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:52,363
I can't wait while
that scoundrel named Goetaborg

343
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:55,241
exploits what I
foolishly gave him.

344
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:57,639
Don't you see
what's at stake?

345
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:00,573
The ultimate aim
of all science...

346
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:02,435
to penetrate
the unknown.

347
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:04,835
We know less
about our earth

348
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:07,233
than about the stars
and outer space.

349
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,264
The greatest mystery
is right here under our feet.

350
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:13,400
And now, if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen.

351
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:19,481
I must speak
with you.

352
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,488
I have no time
for words.

353
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:24,428
You must
take time, sir.

354
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:26,640
This is urgent.

355
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,114
Not for me.

356
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:30,600
I have to
go to Iceland.

357
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:32,584
I'm going with you.

358
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,550
Where?

359
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:35,622
To the center
of the earth.

360
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:37,385
Oh!

361
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:14,260
All Iceland
must be aware

362
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:16,179
that the Scots
have arrived.

363
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:18,577
I wish Jenny
could hear me.

364
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:19,536
Homesick already?

365
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:21,935
It's painful
to leave your fiancée

366
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,332
on the first day
of your engagement.

367
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:27,692
But to come back
as a world famous scientist,

368
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:30,721
that's not
to be sneezed at.

369
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:35,840
Did you expect
a fight of stairs

370
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:37,404
with a red carpet?

371
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:39,680
I neglected
to tell you

372
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:42,746
I have a nervous fear
of heights.

373
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,476
You'll get over that

374
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:46,519
after the first
million fathoms or so.

375
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:48,532
Million fathoms.

376
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:57,301
Alec!

377
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,342
He's been here!

378
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:06,481
He's been
surveying here.

379
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:08,400
This is
fresh-cut wood.

380
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:10,319
Your revered colleague
from Stockholm.

381
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:12,237
He isn't wasting
any time.

382
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:15,114
Do you think he's
already gone down?

383
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:17,992
No. Saknussemm stipulated
the last day of May.

384
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,432
Go back to Reykjavik.

385
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:22,016
Buy every foot of rope
that's available.

386
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:25,500
Stock up on hardtack, bread,
chocolate, and medical supplies.

387
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:26,947
But more than anything,

388
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:28,866
inquire whether they
have Ruhmkorf lamps.

389
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,306
Have another carriage
waiting

390
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:33,335
at the foot of
the slope at sunset.

391
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:35,577
Can we prepare it
that quickly?

392
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,653
We must.
We're in a race.

393
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:39,098
What's that
you're taking?

394
00:23:39,165 --> 00:23:41,018
Jenny's
farewell gift.

395
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:45,807
I’ll keep it
with me always.

396
00:23:59,311 --> 00:24:01,164
Scartaris!

397
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:36,243
Back to my hotel.

398
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,097
Ja, Professor Goetaborg.

399
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,392
Ah, my good man.

400
00:25:03,457 --> 00:25:06,269
I assume my assistant
sent you.

401
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:08,188
No, thank you.

402
00:25:08,254 --> 00:25:10,108
Nobody carries
the soldier's weapons.

403
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:11,546
And take your time.

404
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:12,986
These instruments
are delicate.

405
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:42,784
Easy, coachman!
Easy!

406
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:49,658
This isn't the same road
we came by this morning!

407
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,801
I said, slow down, man!

408
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:00,154
You're out
of your senses!

409
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:02,072
Stop your horses,
man!

410
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:03,991
This is a command!

411
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,302
Can't you hear me?

412
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:10,063
Slow down!

413
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:14,064
Stop, you fool!

414
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:23,658
Whoa!

415
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:31,811
If you've ruined
my instruments,

416
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:34,690
I'll horsewhip you,
so help me.

417
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:38,527
And where are we?

418
00:26:38,593 --> 00:26:41,405
This certainly
is not my hotel.

419
00:26:55,478 --> 00:26:56,404
Professor!

420
00:26:56,469 --> 00:26:57,810
Alec!

421
00:26:57,876 --> 00:26:59,979
Ah-choo!

422
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,424
Where are we?

423
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,099
Apparently in
an eider feather storehouse.

424
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,758
How did
you get here?

425
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,454
I don't know
what happened.

426
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:09,734
It went so fast.

427
00:27:09,804 --> 00:27:12,039
I was clubbed
and overpowered.

428
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,920
Did you see
who did it?

429
00:27:14,985 --> 00:27:17,317
No. I was
just walking.

430
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:19,715
Professor Goetaborg
is a criminal!

431
00:27:19,782 --> 00:27:22,594
Probably he's always
dreamed of fame.

432
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,992
Your letter
opened the door.

433
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:27,064
Did you hear that?

434
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:28,346
Some tapping.

435
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:31,228
Don't get your hopes up,
Professor.

436
00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:32,668
There's
nobody around.

437
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:35,065
Everybody's in
the market square.

438
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:38,228
Tomorrow the fishing feet
goes out.

439
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:40,400
The shops
are closed?

440
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:42,259
No. They are open,

441
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,179
but everything
we need

442
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,099
was sold already.

443
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,656
To Professor Goetaborg!

444
00:27:47,763 --> 00:27:51,305
He stayed in the inn
where we're staying.

445
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:55,627
This time,
I heard it, too.

446
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:58,986
A fellow prisoner,
do you suppose?

447
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:02,180
He's giving us
signals.

448
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:04,102
It's a code.

449
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,376
Morse?

450
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:07,452
I can't
make it out.

451
00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:08,930
Jot this down.

452
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:15,766
Dash, dash, dot,
dot, dot, dot, long dash.

453
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,692
It doesn't make
sense.

454
00:28:17,758 --> 00:28:20,091
Perhaps it's
in Icelandic.

455
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,010
I don't think so.

456
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,131
We've established
contact.

457
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:33,097
I still can't
make it out.

458
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,920
My esteemed friend,
whoever you are,

459
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:37,839
let me introduce
myself,

460
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:39,594
Professor
Oliver Lindenbrook,

461
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:41,221
University
of Edinburgh.

462
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:45,511
May I ask you

463
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:48,926
to interrupt your tapping
and listen?

464
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:54,333
In what language
would you like me to speak?

465
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:56,770
Apparently, he doesn't
understand English.

466
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:58,776
I’ll try French.

467
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,704
Mon cher ami,

468
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:03,254
vous et nous
sommes dans

469
00:29:03,328 --> 00:29:04,920
une situation
abominable!

470
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:06,778
It's no good, sir.

471
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,396
It sounds
more Russian.

472
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:12,375
Kak tvoe imia?

473
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:15,253
My c toboi tovarishchi
polushashche?

474
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:20,781
Gertrude!

475
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:25,196
Gertrude!

476
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,757
Gertrude!

477
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:31,048
It's a female prisoner.

478
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:33,503
And her lover.

479
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:42,204
Professor,
they're kissing.

480
00:29:42,277 --> 00:29:44,664
I'm sorry,
but for once

481
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,520
we must dispense
with tact.

482
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,885
I regret
to disturb you.

483
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,245
Can you get us
out of here?

484
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,246
Oh, Gertrude...

485
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,943
It's a duck!

486
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:14,572
And I was just about
to try Latin.

487
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:18,505
You with
the gold tooth,

488
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:20,905
I'll give you
more gold

489
00:30:20,972 --> 00:30:23,784
if you'll guide us
to Reykjavik.

490
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:25,222
Ja, Reykjavik.

491
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:27,620
You take us
to Reykjavik.

492
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:45,305
I understand

493
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:47,703
that Professor Goetaborg
from Stockholm

494
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:50,101
is stopping here,
a friend...

495
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:52,980
A friend of yours,
Professor Goetaborg?

496
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:54,899
Let's say a colleague.

497
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:56,370
May I help?

498
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:59,216
He is at home,
isn't he?

499
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:00,229
Yes. L...

500
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:02,190
He isn't at home.

501
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:04,009
He can't
be disturbed.

502
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:07,371
He's asleep with
all this going on?

503
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:10,248
You cannot see him.
I'm sorry.

504
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:13,126
Here are your coins.
Here is my card.

505
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:15,524
Put it in his box

506
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,922
so he'll know
I'm around.

507
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:19,330
Thank you so much.

508
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:29,305
Goetaborg,

509
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:31,826
I know you're
in there.

510
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,752
This is
Lindenbrook.

511
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:47,120
Goetaborg.

512
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:05,827
Do you see
what this is, laddie?

513
00:32:05,893 --> 00:32:08,225
The very last word
in equipment.

514
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,664
Ruhmkorf lamps!

515
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,874
Oh!

516
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:12,634
Self-generating lamps.

517
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:15,893
How long will they burn,
Professor?

518
00:32:15,966 --> 00:32:17,819
My guess is indefinitely.

519
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:21,177
As long as
they're wound up,

520
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:24,054
the induction coil
will give off current.

521
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,493
Breathing devices,

522
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,891
like those used
in coal mines in Wales.

523
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:29,331
All the instruments needed

524
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:31,250
for exploring
the world below,

525
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,689
whatever it may be!

526
00:32:32,754 --> 00:32:37,060
I shall wait here
till Goetaborg returns.

527
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:38,627
You...

528
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:39,912
wait, too.

529
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:42,532
Goetaborg may be
a strong man.

530
00:32:52,357 --> 00:32:54,210
More treasure, sir.

531
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:56,129
Climbing boots,

532
00:32:56,195 --> 00:32:59,007
alpenstocks,

533
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:00,445
blankets.

534
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:05,721
Food for months.

535
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:12,437
A chart with a...

536
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,827
P- P-Professor!

537
00:33:22,065 --> 00:33:23,470
What?

538
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,060
Well, Goetaborg,

539
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:35,461
it seems there's
such a thing

540
00:33:35,528 --> 00:33:36,836
as justice,
after all.

541
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:41,154
So you wanted to
push in ahead of us?

542
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,552
Fate took care
of him.

543
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,951
Why didn't they
tell us?

544
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:49,309
Hotels rarely advertise
that they have corpses.

545
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:54,578
The Icelander
teaches us a lesson.

546
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:57,463
We'll observe one
minute of silence

547
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:00,341
in memory of
a great scientist,

548
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:03,700
even if he was
a blasted thief.

549
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,663
Alec,
you mentioned fate.

550
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:35,036
Slight correction...

551
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:38,875
Fate plus a few grains
of potassium cyanide.

552
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,795
He was against us.

553
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,672
Someone was even more
against him.

554
00:34:43,738 --> 00:34:45,111
Who?

555
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:18,525
I'm the wife of
Professor Goetaborg.

556
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:20,600
Oh, my dear.

557
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:22,526
What is it?

558
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:26,362
My husband didn't
meet me at the pier.

559
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,282
Is something wrong?

560
00:35:28,347 --> 00:35:31,760
Please sit a minute
before you go up.

561
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,489
Please, my dear.

562
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,853
He seemed so well.

563
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:40,211
Early in the morning,
he went to the mountain.

564
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:43,589
He came back and received
a luncheon guest in the lobby.

565
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:44,940
I saw him myself.

566
00:35:45,008 --> 00:35:48,834
They went up to his room
and ate.

567
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,907
What are you trying
to tell me?

568
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:53,865
That my husband is...

569
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,514
His guest left
about 4:00.

570
00:35:56,585 --> 00:36:00,356
When the maid went
to make the bed...

571
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:01,795
Oh, dear God.

572
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:07,007
I can't remember anyone
ever dying in my inn.

573
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:10,780
We called a doctor,
but it was too late.

574
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:14,805
We left him up there
because you were coming.

575
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:24,495
Just 10 days ago,

576
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:28,785
he was joking on the pier
in Stockholm.

577
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:30,987
The moment
he arrived here,

578
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:33,388
he sent me a message

579
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:36,584
just with one word...
"Come."

580
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:48,258
Madam,
my deep sympathy.

581
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:50,657
My name is
Oliver Lindenbrook

582
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:52,575
of Edinburgh University.

583
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:56,413
I take it you're familiar
with that name?

584
00:36:56,478 --> 00:36:58,167
Professor Lindenbrook.

585
00:36:58,237 --> 00:36:59,926
I see you are.

586
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:02,329
I must ask a question.

587
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:05,687
I would like
Madam Goetaborg to stay.

588
00:37:05,753 --> 00:37:08,849
This will be difficult
for you, madam.

589
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:12,777
Who was the last person
to see him alive?

590
00:37:12,852 --> 00:37:14,639
His luncheon guest.

591
00:37:14,706 --> 00:37:15,598
Who?

592
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,006
Count Saknussemm.

593
00:37:17,073 --> 00:37:18,958
Count Saknussemm?

594
00:37:19,024 --> 00:37:20,877
I didn't realize

595
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:23,428
the Saknussemm family
still existed.

596
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,985
They are the land's
oldest family.

597
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:29,122
A descendant of
Arne Saknussemm.

598
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,078
And a scientist, too,

599
00:37:31,143 --> 00:37:32,897
in his own right.

600
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:34,939
He lunched
with Goetaborg?

601
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:37,629
They saw each other
every day.

602
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:40,031
They worked together
in his room

603
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:42,713
with all those charts
and instruments.

604
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:45,780
I suggest you request
an autopsy immediately.

605
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:47,705
Is there
something suspicious

606
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:49,526
about
my husband's death?

607
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:51,535
Your husband
came to Iceland

608
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:53,778
for the same reasons
that brought me.

609
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:56,180
Neither of us
could possibly suspect

610
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:59,692
a third party would stop
at nothing to forestall us.

611
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:01,453
He was killed?

612
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:02,415
Poisoned.

613
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:03,375
Oh.

614
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:05,926
This is now
a police matter.

615
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:07,853
Send for them.

616
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,250
To your room first,
madam.

617
00:38:12,715 --> 00:38:16,007
Uh... just one second,
if you please.

618
00:38:16,073 --> 00:38:17,446
Thank you.

619
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,242
I'm deeply distressed by
your husband's death.

620
00:38:22,308 --> 00:38:24,640
I fully understand
your feelings.

621
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:28,000
However, I must ask you
one question.

622
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:32,795
How do you plan to dispose
of your husband's equipment?

623
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:34,714
What does it matter?

624
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,592
I’ll take it
off your hands.

625
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:39,989
We can
discuss it later.

626
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:41,811
Time is
running out.

627
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:45,259
My expedition must start
within 24 hours.

628
00:38:45,332 --> 00:38:46,705
Your expedition?

629
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:48,145
Exactly.

630
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,437
I only know of
the Goetaborg Expedition.

631
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:54,372
Husbands don't always
tell wives everything.

632
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:58,218
I don't wish to blacken
your husband's memory.

633
00:38:58,284 --> 00:39:00,616
However, I demand
that equipment.

634
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:02,851
I have a right
to it.

635
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:05,406
A right to take over
another's life work?

636
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:08,291
He died for that idea!

637
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:11,169
He stole that idea
from me.

638
00:39:11,235 --> 00:39:12,575
That is a lie.

639
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,048
Madam.

640
00:39:14,113 --> 00:39:15,966
An unforgivable lie.

641
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:17,885
I would rather destroy

642
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:20,283
every pound
of that equipment

643
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:22,616
than let you have it.

644
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:35,730
"Incredible encounter!

645
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:37,964
"A Saknussemm descendant
turns up,

646
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:40,846
"acts as if he were
king of volcanoes,

647
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:44,870
"tries to force me to surrender
his ancestor's secret.

648
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:48,898
"Saknussemm called again.

649
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,593
"New complication!

650

"My real adversary arrives,

651
00:39:53,862 --> 00:39:57,634
"undoubtedly to claim his rights.

00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,999
Must fight him somehow."

653
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:13,944
Oh, uh, young man,

654
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:17,302
would you come here
a moment, please?

655
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,154
Who are those for?

656
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:26,351
Professor Lindenbrook.

657
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:27,790
Ah-ha.

658
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:33,546
Ja, madam.

659
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:43,139
Oh, at least
we have some rope.

660
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:45,059
That's a beginning.

661
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:50,814
Tell him to stop jabbering
and go shopping.

662
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,733
What about lamps?

663
00:40:54,717 --> 00:40:56,570
Ah, lamps... lamps.

664
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:59,449
What about...
ah... picks?

665
00:40:59,515 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh, and provisions,
food.

666
00:41:03,352 --> 00:41:05,205
What are you doing?

667
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,821
Big ox.

668
00:41:07,893 --> 00:41:09,996
Put me down.

669
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,399
Somebody please
explain this outrage.

670
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:16,652
Are we to be abducted
every day in Iceland?

671
00:41:19,597 --> 00:41:21,450
Ja, madam.

672
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:25,287
She speaks
Icelandic.

673
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:26,562
I do,

674
00:41:26,632 --> 00:41:30,557
but I wish to apologize
to you in plain English.

675
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:33,441
I went through
my husband's diary.

676
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:37,759
I believe I have
done you an injustice.

677
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:40,157
Don't give it
another thought.

678
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:43,035
I'm Sir Oliver's assistant,
Alec McEwen.

679
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,433
This expedition began
thanks to this lad.

680
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:48,311
Began... that's all
it has done.

681
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:51,189
If you still want
the equipment,

682
00:41:51,256 --> 00:41:52,879
it's yours.

683
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:56,046
Will you
say that again?

684
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:58,449
I won't stand in the way

685
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:00,367
of the Lindenbrook
Expedition.

686
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:09,418
Madam.

687
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:12,295
My husband had
boots made specially.

688
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,669
I hope they fit.

689
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:16,602
Mine will be
ready without delay.

690
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:18,269
Your man's ordering
some for me.

691
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:20,706
Good, good.

692
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,145
What was that?

693
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,663
Why would you need
boots like this?

694
00:42:24,737 --> 00:42:27,452
I can't go in these.

695
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,892
Go where, madam?

696
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:30,386
Don't say it.

697
00:42:30,462 --> 00:42:31,889
Naturally,
I'm coming along.

698
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:35,092
That's why I'm giving you
all of this.

699
00:42:35,162 --> 00:42:37,015
That's a condition.

700
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:38,901
You didn't mention
any condition.

701
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:40,372
Then I do now.

702
00:42:40,438 --> 00:42:43,402
Whom were you taking
besides this young man?

703
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:46,027
The big Icelander.

704
00:42:46,098 --> 00:42:47,558
Then I'll be very useful.

705
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:48,810
He doesn't
understand English.

706
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,042
You can't come.
You're a woman!

707
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,403
What has my sex
to do with it?

708
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:58,117
We're not contemplating
a stroll down Piccadilly.

709
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:02,275
Professor Lindenbrook,
I've just lost my husband.

710
00:43:02,343 --> 00:43:05,242
I have nothing else
to live for up here.

711
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:08,348
Down there, I can
represent his name.

712
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,272
The decision
is not yours.

713
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:14,197
The police need you
for the investigation.

714
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:16,440
I have already given
my testimony.

715
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,803
But madam, quite apart
from the appalling danger,

716
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:21,721
think of
the inconvenience.

717
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:24,085
The lack
of privacy!

718
00:43:24,152 --> 00:43:26,387
In short,
you don't want this?

719
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:28,755
I may be mad
about this journey,

720
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:32,975
but to burden myself with
a female is sheer stupidity.

721
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,854
I may have been
a disturbance to men,

722
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,187
never a burden.

723
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:40,424
This is
an absolute holdup.

724
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,826
I assure you
you will not receive

725
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:45,224
one iota of extra
consideration.

726
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,623
You'll sleep
where we sleep,

727
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:50,020
you'll eat
what we eat.

728
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:52,420
Then you accept
my proposition?

729
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:55,614
Oh!

730
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:27,053
Professor, look!

731
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:52,536
There's our gateway.

732
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:27,392
Thank you, Scartaris.

733
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:31,036
Never was there
a brighter sunrise.

734
00:45:31,107 --> 00:45:33,625
Now, we descend
into oblivion,

735
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:37,949
or we enter
the great book of history.

736
00:45:38,014 --> 00:45:39,387
Roll call.

737
00:45:39,453 --> 00:45:41,306
Carla Goetaborg.

738
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:43,280
Alexander McEwen.

739
00:45:43,355 --> 00:45:45,492
Hans und
Gertrude Belka.

740
00:45:45,562 --> 00:45:47,926
Oliver S. Lindenbrook.

741
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:51,437
What did he say?
Hans and who?

742
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:53,928
And Gertrude.

743
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:04,203
Professor!

744
00:46:07,115 --> 00:46:08,488
Professor!

745
00:46:10,952 --> 00:46:12,958
All right,
you've arrived.

746
00:46:18,627 --> 00:46:20,480
Rather an alarming
descent.

747
00:46:20,546 --> 00:46:22,399
I found it
exhilarating.

748
00:46:22,464 --> 00:46:24,797
I wonder
if Madam Goetaborg

749
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:26,715
will change her mind.

750
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:29,113
You make
my mouth water.

751
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:31,512
Hans is tying the rope
on her.

752
00:46:31,578 --> 00:46:32,591
I'm a fool.

753
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,630
I should have told him
to tie her to a mule

754
00:46:35,704 --> 00:46:36,782
and send her home.

755
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:38,991
What language
would you have used?

756
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:41,873
She may be of some use
in that respect,

757
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:45,710
then there's always the blessed
chance the rope may break.

758
00:46:56,457 --> 00:46:58,365
Are you all right,
ma'am?

759
00:46:58,439 --> 00:46:59,812
Oh, quite.

760
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:02,626
Hans insisted
on a double rope.

761
00:47:02,693 --> 00:47:05,854
Did he indeed?
How solicitous.

762
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,514
But that was for Gertrude.

763
00:47:07,585 --> 00:47:10,779
Poor Sir Oliver,
stuck with a woman.

764
00:47:10,848 --> 00:47:13,879
If only you
could see your face.

765
00:47:13,949 --> 00:47:15,573
That's my consolation,
madam.

766
00:47:15,645 --> 00:47:18,457
I don't have to
look at it. You do.

767
00:47:40,459 --> 00:47:42,562
There's not enough rope
in all Europe!

768
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:45,446
Perhaps this is
the wrong entrance.

769
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:47,234
The sign was
unmistakable.

770
00:47:47,304 --> 00:47:49,757
But there's no
other way to continue.

771
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,855
Gertrude!

772
00:47:53,923 --> 00:47:56,092
Gertrude!

773
00:48:09,592 --> 00:48:11,379
Oh, madam!
Madam!

774
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:17,937
He says there's a tunnel
on the other side.

775
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:21,295
Slanting downhill,
but walkable.

776
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,733
Eureka!

777
00:48:25,678 --> 00:48:28,294
Oh, thank you.

778
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,835
Now then,
a general summary...

779
00:48:36,901 --> 00:48:38,558
A... We must never use

780
00:48:38,628 --> 00:48:42,334
more than two Ruhmkorf lamps
at a time.

781
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:45,149
B... We won't need our
breathing equipment immediately.

782
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:48,061
Nevertheless, never
take a step without it.

783
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:49,913
C... Use our canteens freely.

784
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,662
There'll be many
springs on our way.

785
00:48:52,731 --> 00:48:55,314
As my husband's charts
indicated.

786
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:59,538
Is he to be with us
on our entire journey?

787
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:02,482
Sorry.

788
00:49:03,795 --> 00:49:07,273
Well, every journey
begins with a first step.

789
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,960
May the good Lord
be with us.

790
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,436
Onward!

791
00:49:11,502 --> 00:49:13,442
Let's have
some music.

792
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:16,383
Alec, will you
start us off?

793
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:13,695
Miss Jenny!

794
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,325
I saw you turn pale
when the dominie spoke

795
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,765
of those in peril

796
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:23,163
at the far ends
of the earth.

797
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,603
Far ends of the earth.

798
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:26,522
At least that
would be somewhere.

799
00:50:26,587 --> 00:50:29,399
There was a clipping
in a Stockholm paper,

800
00:50:29,466 --> 00:50:31,319
a dispatch
from Reykjavik.

801
00:50:31,384 --> 00:50:33,237
I can only read
their names.

802
00:50:33,303 --> 00:50:34,676
I had it translated.

803
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,114
The last news
of them was

804
00:50:36,181 --> 00:50:37,968
that they went
up Mount Sneffels

805
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,334
with some heavily laden
donkeys.

806
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:41,545
Yes?

807
00:50:41,616 --> 00:50:44,680
And then the animals
came down without their packs.

808
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:45,643
And?

809
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,530
And that's all.

810
00:50:47,597 --> 00:50:50,890
Oliver S. Lindenbrook,
Alexander McEwen,

811
00:50:50,954 --> 00:50:54,148
Hans Belka,
and Madam...

812
00:50:54,216 --> 00:50:55,197
What's...

813
00:50:55,272 --> 00:50:58,565
Why, it seems a woman
went with them.

814
00:50:58,629 --> 00:51:00,482
A woman!

815
00:51:46,149 --> 00:51:48,831
You know what
they'll call that

816
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,712
in the Royal Observatory
at Greenwich?

817
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:55,071
A slight tremor coming
from undefined regions.

818
00:51:55,135 --> 00:51:59,638
Well, we've lived
through a slight tremor.

819
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:01,082
Let us proceed.

820
00:52:21,678 --> 00:52:24,010
It seems to be
moving away from us.

821
00:52:24,076 --> 00:52:26,408
In these regions,
I don't venture to say

822
00:52:26,474 --> 00:52:29,286
anything is moving away
or coming towards us.

823
00:52:29,352 --> 00:52:31,619
The only thing
we can be certain of

824
00:52:31,686 --> 00:52:34,019
is that danger
is always with us.

825
00:52:34,086 --> 00:52:36,026
We might as well
ignore it.

826
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:55,827
Run!

827
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:32,316
Jump!

828
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:33,307
Aah! Oh!

829
00:53:51,569 --> 00:53:53,356
The three notches.

830
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,378
The three notches
of Arne Saknussemm.

831
00:53:58,444 --> 00:53:59,817
What does that mean?

832
00:53:59,884 --> 00:54:01,737
We've been shown
the right path.

833
00:54:01,802 --> 00:54:03,175
We have a guide.

834
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,614
Alec,
the plumb bob.

835
00:54:05,895 --> 00:54:09,886
Look! Without these marks,
we would have gone astray.

836
00:54:09,956 --> 00:54:12,539
We'd have wasted months
exploring endlessly.

837
00:54:12,611 --> 00:54:16,918
We might have taken
any one of these channels.

838
00:54:16,991 --> 00:54:21,461
But our great colleague
maketh a path for our feet.

839
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,646
Well, you all
deserve a rest.

840
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:35,727
Let's have tea with
a double ration of raisins.

841
00:54:35,795 --> 00:54:38,607
May I comb my hair first,
Professor?

842
00:54:38,672 --> 00:54:39,565
Oh!

843
00:54:39,632 --> 00:54:41,005
Ladies
on the left.

844
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:42,445
Gentleman
on the right.

845
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:01,243
Oh!

846
00:55:03,776 --> 00:55:05,629
What is it,
madam?

847
00:55:05,695 --> 00:55:06,839
Shh!

848
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:09,296
If we'd known
you had nightmares,

849
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,411
we'd have made different
sleeping arrangements.

850
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:17,293
Someone is walking
up there.

851
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:18,794
I heard footsteps,

852
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,210
human footsteps.

853
00:55:20,277 --> 00:55:22,609
Since the beginning
of time,

854
00:55:22,676 --> 00:55:25,227
all women have heard footsteps...
up there.

855
00:55:25,298 --> 00:55:27,597
My hearing is
extremely acute.

856
00:55:27,663 --> 00:55:30,956
The hearing of all women
is extremely acute.

857
00:55:31,022 --> 00:55:34,216
My wife used to hear
rats in the attic,

858
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:38,655
usually, on the nights before
I had an important lecture.

859
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:39,938
Alec,
go find out.

860
00:55:40,008 --> 00:55:40,901
Hans...

861
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:42,656
Will you leave
those men alone!

862
00:55:42,726 --> 00:55:43,739
They need rest.

863
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:46,494
Moreover,
it was stipulated

864
00:55:46,563 --> 00:55:48,862
that I
give the orders.

865
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,091
Don't use that
patient voice with me.

866
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:54,361
How about
an impatient voice?

867
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:58,834
I am a member
of this expedition.

868
00:55:58,907 --> 00:56:01,588
As such, I intend to report
any of my observations.

869
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:04,208
Alec...

870
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:06,318
put it down
in the record

871
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,754
that a member
of the expedition

872
00:56:08,821 --> 00:56:11,153
reported rats
in the attic.

873
00:56:11,218 --> 00:56:12,427
Lights out!

874
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:28,805
Don't be afraid,
madam.

875
00:56:28,871 --> 00:56:30,146
I'm right here.

876
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:21,018
Conceal these marks
completely.

877
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:27,261
I’ll give them
some new ones.

878
00:58:02,663 --> 00:58:05,956
This is steeper than
anything we've encountered.

879
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:09,630
It's just as well we all
had a good night's rest.

880
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:11,552
Alec, take this down.

881
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:14,168
21st day
of our descent,

882
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:17,945
starting from an estimated depth
of 129 kilometers,

883
00:58:18,013 --> 00:58:20,149
limestone formation
continues.

884
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:22,744
Aye-aye,
Professor!

885
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:25,141
Here are the three
notches again.

886
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:26,582
Good!

887
00:58:32,498 --> 00:58:34,984
Gertrude!
Wrong turn.

888
00:58:35,057 --> 00:58:37,226
Let's see.
What have we here?

889
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:39,529
One heads 220 degrees
south-southwest,

890
00:58:39,598 --> 00:58:43,457
the other 160 degrees
south-southeast. Strange.

891
00:58:43,531 --> 00:58:46,725
I would have wagered
we should go that way.

892
00:58:46,793 --> 00:58:48,962
That was Gertrude's
feeling, too.

893
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:51,680
Are you sure
your compass is right?

894
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,174
Quite.

895
00:59:10,937 --> 00:59:12,626
What's he saying?

896
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:17,427
Hans is wondering about the
ultimate goal of our expedition.

897
00:59:17,493 --> 00:59:19,498
He's asking, "Why?"

898
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:21,195
Alec, suppose
you tell him.

899
00:59:23,344 --> 00:59:26,538
Well, why does man
freeze to death

900
00:59:26,607 --> 00:59:29,419
trying to reach
the North Pole?

901
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:31,371
Why does man suffer

902
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:33,855
the steaming heat
of the Amazon?

903
00:59:33,929 --> 00:59:36,316
Why does he
stagger his mind

904
00:59:36,392 --> 00:59:39,172
with the mathematics
of the sky?

905
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:40,547
Once a question mark

906
00:59:40,613 --> 00:59:42,466
has arisen in
the human brain,

907
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:43,905
the answer
must be found

908
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:46,205
if it takes
a thousand years.

909
00:59:46,273 --> 00:59:49,848
Render that into
a few Icelandic words!

910
00:59:49,982 --> 00:59:51,475
Tell him
that scientists

911
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,652
have bats in
their belfries.

912
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:54,617
Oh!

913
01:00:05,237 --> 01:00:07,308
Are you all right?

914
01:00:07,378 --> 01:00:09,231
Can you
unhook yourself?

915
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:10,442
Hans!

916
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:25,957
I didn't see it!

917
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,876
I didn't see it!

918
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:29,794
Never mind
about that.

919
01:00:31,299 --> 01:00:33,152
How is it possible?

920
01:00:33,218 --> 01:00:35,257
This way was
clearly indicated.

921
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:37,945
There must
have been a quake

922
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,868
since
Arne Saknussemm's day.

923
01:00:39,933 --> 01:00:42,745
This is no
recent fissure.

924
01:00:42,812 --> 01:00:45,144
I wasn't
in a position

925
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:46,582
to observe it
scientifically.

926
01:00:46,648 --> 01:00:49,460
We made a mistake somewhere,
but where?

927
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:12,431
What are you
doing here, madam?

928
01:01:12,497 --> 01:01:15,319
We were supposed
to stay together.

929
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:16,762
We've been tricked,

930
01:01:16,828 --> 01:01:18,687
tricked into
the wrong tunnel.

931
01:01:18,754 --> 01:01:20,613
Those three notches

932
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:22,538
are not
Arne Saknussemm's.

933
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:24,463
She's right, Professor.

934
01:01:24,529 --> 01:01:27,351
Someone has passed through
before us.

935
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,757
No need
to ask who.

936
01:01:29,824 --> 01:01:31,683
Madam heard him
last night.

937
01:01:31,749 --> 01:01:34,571
Now she's saying,
"I told you so."

938
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:36,617
Silently, I admit,
but she's saying it.

939
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,380
When I wish
to say something,

940
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:41,309
I say it aloud.

941
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:44,196
In view of
this new development,

942
01:01:44,263 --> 01:01:46,602
I must end
the expedition.

943
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:50,453
But you're not a man
who frightens easily.

944
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:52,597
I'm not thinking
of myself,

945
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,561
but of you...
a woman!

946
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,088
I'm one
of your men.

947
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:59,206
If a madman
is loose...

948
01:01:59,279 --> 01:02:00,941
He's against us all,

949
01:02:01,012 --> 01:02:03,833
against the concept
of this journey.

950
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:10,989
What's happened now?
What's he saying?

951
01:02:11,056 --> 01:02:14,840
He said we should go back
to where Alec fell.

952
01:02:14,906 --> 01:02:17,246
It's not
on our route.

953
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:19,172
If we're to go ahead,

954
01:02:19,238 --> 01:02:21,578
we've no time
for detours.

955
01:02:21,644 --> 01:02:23,689
Then you wait here.

956
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:53,537
If only my Jenny
were here to see this.

957
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,157
Now that
the boy has gone

958
01:03:09,228 --> 01:03:11,567
and Hans doesn't
understand English,

959
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:14,455
I must ask
a delicate question.

960
01:03:14,521 --> 01:03:16,380
I'm blushing
already.

961
01:03:16,447 --> 01:03:19,750
You're wearing stays,
are you not?

962
01:03:19,816 --> 01:03:21,193
Professor!

963
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:23,599
I can hear
them creaking.

964
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,525
It's not
your business!

965
01:03:25,592 --> 01:03:27,931
Everything here
is my business.

966
01:03:27,998 --> 01:03:30,819
We'll look away
while you discard them.

967
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:32,744
You go too far.

968
01:03:32,811 --> 01:03:35,632
The heat
will soon be excessive.

969
01:03:35,698 --> 01:03:38,038
Nothing must impede
anyone's breathing.

970
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:02,836
Alec!
Leaving in a few minutes!

971
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,560
I've got to take a specimen of
this back to Edinburgh,

972
01:05:17,632 --> 01:05:20,534
if it's the last thing
I do.

973
01:05:29,089 --> 01:05:30,463
Unique.

974
01:05:30,529 --> 01:05:31,904
Inexplicable.

975
01:05:36,002 --> 01:05:39,101
Ready to go,
if that boy Alec

976
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:42,464
would be good enough
to appear.

977
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:44,864
Where the devil
is he?

978
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:09,283
It's a blind alley!

979
01:06:12,709 --> 01:06:14,595
Keep back!

980
01:06:45,352 --> 01:06:46,726
Professor!

981
01:07:03,529 --> 01:07:04,991
Hans!

982
01:07:40,525 --> 01:07:41,866
Ah!

983
01:07:53,743 --> 01:07:55,531
Good God!

984
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,250
Aah!

985
01:07:58,319 --> 01:07:59,366
Aah!

986
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,814
Oh. Aah!

987
01:08:06,352 --> 01:08:08,686
Hold on to my arm.

988
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:10,280
My shoulder.

989
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:12,010
Hold on.

990
01:08:18,672 --> 01:08:20,810
Oh, praise the Lord.

991
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:39,661
Oh!

992
01:08:39,731 --> 01:08:40,811
Oh.

993
01:09:22,967 --> 01:09:23,860
Alec.

994
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,996
Professor!

995
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,994
Hello!

996
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:09,587
Hello! Hello!

997
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,034
Hello! Hello!

998
01:10:11,099 --> 01:10:12,953
Professor,
here I am!

999
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,954
- Here I am!
- Here I am!

1000
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:18,035
Here I am!

1001
01:13:01,803 --> 01:13:03,177
Salt!

1002
01:13:41,103 --> 01:13:42,379
Ah!

1003
01:13:58,544 --> 01:13:59,624
Ah!

1004
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,359
Oh!

1005
01:14:28,147 --> 01:14:30,481
Alec!

1006
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,315
Alec!

1007
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:36,810
Alec! Alec!
Alec!

1008
01:14:38,164 --> 01:14:41,459
Professor, you can't
go on this way.

1009
01:14:41,524 --> 01:14:45,299
I've kept track of
the passage of days.

1010
01:14:45,365 --> 01:14:47,274
Try that channel
there.

1011
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:49,136
We were there
yesterday.

1012
01:14:49,205 --> 01:14:50,579
We left marks.

1013
01:14:50,645 --> 01:14:52,499
He's not there.

1014
01:14:52,565 --> 01:14:54,899
I've got
to find him.

1015
01:14:54,966 --> 01:14:56,820
I'm responsible.

1016
01:14:56,886 --> 01:14:58,260
Oh.

1017
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:09,459
I can see this
is a recent break.

1018
01:15:09,527 --> 01:15:10,738
Alec!

1019
01:15:10,808 --> 01:15:12,662
Alec!
Alec! Alec!

1020
01:15:17,528 --> 01:15:19,383
Can you hear me?

1021
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:21,302
Can you
hear me?

1022
01:15:21,368 --> 01:15:23,222
Give us a sign!

1023
01:15:23,289 --> 01:15:25,143
Give us
a sign!

1024
01:15:25,209 --> 01:15:27,063
Alec, listen carefully.

1025
01:15:27,129 --> 01:15:30,424
When the echoes stop,
try to answer.

1026
01:15:30,488 --> 01:15:33,303
If you're injured,
make an effort.

1027
01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:37,079
Pick up a pebble
and scratch the rock.

1028
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:39,000
We'll hear you.

1029
01:15:39,066 --> 01:15:41,400
Just give us a sign!

1030
01:15:41,466 --> 01:15:43,800
Give us
a sign!

1031
01:15:58,748 --> 01:16:01,082
A phosphorescent pool.

1032
01:16:01,148 --> 01:16:04,214
Strange grave
for a young Scot.

1033
01:16:07,388 --> 01:16:09,242
Professor,
there's no use.

1034
01:16:09,309 --> 01:16:12,123
How can I live
with myself?

1035
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:14,043
Accept his loss

1036
01:16:14,109 --> 01:16:17,884
like one soldier accepts
the loss of another.

1037
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,804
You must continue.

1038
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:22,685
You must go on with
the Lindenbrook Expedition.

1039
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,921
The Lindenbrook
Expedition.

1040
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,365
Yes.

1041
01:16:26,431 --> 01:16:28,918
Go on with it.

1042
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:31,991
It was his project,
as much as yours.

1043
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,421
Yes.
You're right.

1044
01:16:36,607 --> 01:16:38,462
We will proceed,

1045
01:16:38,528 --> 01:16:40,862
but we won't
call it

1046
01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:42,781
the Lindenbrook
Expedition anymore.

1047
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,702
From now on,

1048
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:47,583
it's the Alec McEwen
Expedition.

1049
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:25,507
No broken bones?

1050
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:28,093
Ribs all right?

1051
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:30,019
Good. Get up.

1052
01:17:33,318 --> 01:17:35,554
Down there,
food and water.

1053
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:37,475
Refresh yourself.

1054
01:17:39,462 --> 01:17:41,796
So you've lost
your friends?

1055
01:17:41,862 --> 01:17:43,716
Just as well.

1056
01:17:51,782 --> 01:17:54,499
It's my servant.

1057
01:17:56,679 --> 01:17:59,548
Too much heat,
too much load,

1058
01:17:59,623 --> 01:18:01,477
too much fear.

1059
01:18:01,544 --> 01:18:02,918
You're younger.

1060
01:18:02,984 --> 01:18:05,799
You'll do
to carry my things.

1061
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:08,864
I'm not your servant,
Count Saknussemm.

1062
01:18:08,936 --> 01:18:11,075
Pride? Rather
out of place here.

1063
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:13,632
Eat, drink, and
pick up those things.

1064
01:18:13,704 --> 01:18:15,394
I'm in a hurry.

1065
01:18:15,465 --> 01:18:17,799
To steal
the professor's project?

1066
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:19,720
Steal? Listen,
young foreigner.

1067
01:18:19,786 --> 01:18:23,080
I don't have to steal
what belongs to me.

1068
01:18:23,147 --> 01:18:25,602
You're in
my world now.

1069
01:18:33,707 --> 01:18:35,082
Stop!

1070
01:18:35,147 --> 01:18:37,514
I need someone to
carry my equipment!

1071
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,133
You'll never find
your companions.

1072
01:18:40,204 --> 01:18:41,797
We need each other.

1073
01:18:41,868 --> 01:18:44,967
You found me.
My friends will, too.

1074
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:47,556
You'll carry it with
one arm, not two!

1075
01:18:57,710 --> 01:18:59,564
A hail of bullets.

1076
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:01,484
A remarkable echo

1077
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,590
reverberating from
the rock chambers.

1078
01:19:03,662 --> 01:19:06,761
The last echo
will give us the direction.

1079
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:15,405
166 degrees
south-southeast.

1080
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:34,541
Alec!

1081
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:35,536
Alec!

1082
01:19:35,601 --> 01:19:36,494
Alec.

1083
01:19:37,937 --> 01:19:39,824
Alec!

1084
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:41,744
Alec!

1085
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:44,143
We'd given you up,

1086
01:19:44,209 --> 01:19:46,064
but you're
alive, laddie.

1087
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,984
You're alive!

1088
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,996
Professor.
Carla.

1089
01:19:54,067 --> 01:19:55,179
Hans.

1090
01:19:56,211 --> 01:19:58,065
Just to see you!

1091
01:20:00,531 --> 01:20:02,385
Where was he?

1092
01:20:02,451 --> 01:20:05,265
I didn't think
he'd shoot,

1093
01:20:05,332 --> 01:20:06,859
but he did.

1094
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:08,339
Of course I did.

1095
01:20:08,405 --> 01:20:10,892
What did you expect?

1096
01:20:10,964 --> 01:20:13,353
You are
trespassers here.

1097
01:20:13,429 --> 01:20:15,217
I own this domain.

1098
01:20:16,533 --> 01:20:21,040
You are also
the murderer of my husband.

1099
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:23,957
I claimed my rights.
He would not listen.

1100
01:20:24,021 --> 01:20:27,369
In the name of
your great ancestor,

1101
01:20:27,446 --> 01:20:29,136
put down that
preposterous gun.

1102
01:20:29,206 --> 01:20:31,824
No harm will come if
you accept my terms.

1103
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:34,382
You will go back
the way you came,

1104
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:38,797
but leave equipment
I need and that man.

1105
01:20:40,088 --> 01:20:42,902
You won't listen
to a murderer.

1106
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:45,302
Never interrupt
a murderer, madam.

1107
01:20:45,368 --> 01:20:48,150
I resent that
bourgeois classification.

1108
01:20:48,216 --> 01:20:50,103
I'll spare
your lives.

1109
01:20:50,168 --> 01:20:52,590
You have my word
of honor.

1110
01:20:55,288 --> 01:20:57,874
Give me
your hand on that.

1111
01:20:59,577 --> 01:21:00,624
Aah!

1112
01:21:04,474 --> 01:21:06,895
A bourgeois trick.

1113
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,824
So sorry.

1114
01:21:14,171 --> 01:21:17,465
All right, before
we continue on our journey,

1115
01:21:17,532 --> 01:21:19,866
we must perform
a solemn duty.

1116
01:21:19,931 --> 01:21:22,200
We have
to hold court.

1117
01:21:24,187 --> 01:21:26,041
Here, hundreds
of kilometers

1118
01:21:26,107 --> 01:21:28,922
beneath the surface
of the earth,

1119
01:21:28,988 --> 01:21:30,842
we are the law.

1120
01:21:30,908 --> 01:21:33,723
The defendant stands accused
of one murder

1121
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:36,122
and one act of mayhem.

1122
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:39,003
I must ask you,
as jurors,

1123
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:41,883
is the defendant
guilty or not guilty?

1124
01:21:41,948 --> 01:21:43,323
Guilty.

1125
01:21:44,828 --> 01:21:46,203
Guilty.

1126
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:48,604
Hans.

1127
01:21:59,742 --> 01:22:01,084
Guilty.

1128
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,364
Then the mandatory
sentence...

1129
01:22:06,432 --> 01:22:08,286
is death.

1130
01:22:08,352 --> 01:22:11,003
There are
two bullets left.

1131
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,559
Madam, please
explain to Hans.

1132
01:22:13,631 --> 01:22:17,341
We will follow the route
marked by the notches.

1133
01:22:17,409 --> 01:22:20,224
He will wait here
for 10 minutes,

1134
01:22:20,289 --> 01:22:22,393
then carry out
the sentence.

1135
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:27,322
No, no, no.

1136
01:22:27,393 --> 01:22:29,728
I can carry
with my left hand.

1137
01:22:29,793 --> 01:22:31,320
Carry yourself
for a while.

1138
01:22:31,394 --> 01:22:32,954
That's all
we can expect.

1139
01:22:35,266 --> 01:22:38,332
Sir Oliver, there's
a slight problem.

1140
01:22:38,402 --> 01:22:41,599
Hans refuses
to shoot the count.

1141
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:44,601
What do you mean?
It's a court order.

1142
01:22:44,675 --> 01:22:46,616
His family's been loyal

1143
01:22:46,691 --> 01:22:49,025
to the Saknussemms
for generations.

1144
01:22:49,092 --> 01:22:50,368
He cannot touch the gun.

1145
01:22:50,435 --> 01:22:53,337
This is contempt
of court.

1146
01:22:53,412 --> 01:22:55,266
All right, Alec.

1147
01:22:55,332 --> 01:22:57,186
No, no,
Sir Oliver.

1148
01:22:57,252 --> 01:22:59,106
Don't look at me.

1149
01:22:59,172 --> 01:23:01,506
I couldn't
pull the trigger

1150
01:23:01,573 --> 01:23:03,427
with my left hand.

1151
01:23:07,334 --> 01:23:08,708
Oh, no.

1152
01:23:08,773 --> 01:23:10,627
I couldn't do it.

1153
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,060
After all,
I'm a woman!

1154
01:23:13,126 --> 01:23:15,842
For weeks you've
denied your sex.

1155
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:18,276
Now you
fall back on it.

1156
01:23:18,343 --> 01:23:20,644
I would say
the natural executioner

1157
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:23,678
would be the leader
of the expedition.

1158
01:23:23,751 --> 01:23:26,402
We must face
the truth, sir.

1159
01:23:26,471 --> 01:23:28,325
We're much too civilized

1160
01:23:28,392 --> 01:23:32,166
to do away with
a fellow human being.

1161
01:23:32,231 --> 01:23:34,565
Should we
drag him along?

1162
01:23:34,632 --> 01:23:36,039
Feed him?

1163
01:23:36,104 --> 01:23:38,078
Stop fiddling
with those lamps!

1164
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:44,167
What's he
jabbering about?

1165
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:46,818
I'll tell you
what he's saying.

1166
01:23:46,889 --> 01:23:49,442
The lamps are
giving out.

1167
01:23:49,513 --> 01:23:53,474
The induction coils
have been corroded by the salt.

1168
01:23:53,546 --> 01:23:57,287
I insist we leave
here at once.

1169
01:23:57,355 --> 01:23:58,434
You insist!

1170
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,768
He's bloody well right.

1171
01:24:05,835 --> 01:24:07,689
Let's be off.

1172
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:20,586
Saknussemm's unfastened
himself from the rope again

1173
01:24:20,653 --> 01:24:21,929
and gone off.

1174
01:24:21,996 --> 01:24:23,043
What's the harm?

1175
01:24:23,116 --> 01:24:25,866
He'll be back when
it's time to eat.

1176
01:24:25,933 --> 01:24:28,109
The harm is he's
wasting a lamp.

1177
01:24:56,463 --> 01:24:59,431
Madam, will you
try your lamp, please?

1178
01:25:08,656 --> 01:25:09,965
It's dead.

1179
01:25:10,032 --> 01:25:11,407
Yours, Alec.

1180
01:25:16,914 --> 01:25:19,564
When these things
are gone,

1181
01:25:19,633 --> 01:25:21,488
they're really gone.

1182
01:25:21,554 --> 01:25:23,408
Madam,
make a final note

1183
01:25:23,474 --> 01:25:25,808
while there
is still light.

1184
01:25:25,873 --> 01:25:28,110
Let me.
My arm's well.

1185
01:25:28,179 --> 01:25:29,106
No need.

1186
01:25:30,354 --> 01:25:32,907
Covered another
92 kilometers.

1187
01:25:32,979 --> 01:25:36,295
Temperature
dropped seven degrees.

1188
01:25:36,372 --> 01:25:39,633
Surprisingly cooler
than anticipated.

1189
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,067
The darkness is
closing about us.

1190
01:25:42,132 --> 01:25:44,914
This may be
our last entry.

1191
01:25:50,773 --> 01:25:54,548
Hans and I
can cut rope into torches.

1192
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:56,467
That's a good idea.

1193
01:25:56,533 --> 01:25:58,387
What puzzles me

1194
01:25:58,454 --> 01:26:00,308
is that
Saknussemm's notches

1195
01:26:00,374 --> 01:26:02,228
keep pointing
our way.

1196
01:26:02,293 --> 01:26:04,627
What lamp
did he have?

1197
01:26:04,694 --> 01:26:07,476
Perhaps he didn't
require a lamp.

1198
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:09,811
From here on,
neither do you, Sir Oliver.

1199
01:26:09,879 --> 01:26:11,536
Why don't you
turn it off?

1200
01:26:12,759 --> 01:26:15,606
Yes, just
switch it off.

1201
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:24,723
Why,
it's miraculous.

1202
01:26:27,352 --> 01:26:29,206
Look at this.

1203
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:37,208
What is it, sir?

1204
01:26:37,273 --> 01:26:38,647
A form of algae

1205
01:26:38,713 --> 01:26:40,568
with a property
of luminescence.

1206
01:26:40,633 --> 01:26:42,487
Light without heat.

1207
01:26:42,553 --> 01:26:44,440
A cool
chemical light.

1208
01:26:44,505 --> 01:26:46,807
You've seen fireflies
and glowworms

1209
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:48,728
and forms of sea life

1210
01:26:48,793 --> 01:26:51,127
that generate
their own light?

1211
01:26:51,194 --> 01:26:53,682
The same principle
is involved here.

1212
01:27:28,062 --> 01:27:29,948
256th day...

1213
01:27:30,015 --> 01:27:33,757
the phenomenal winds

1214
01:27:33,822 --> 01:27:35,960
vanished as abruptly
as they came.

1215
01:27:37,183 --> 01:27:41,460
We are now in a stupendous
deposit of cinnabar.

1216
01:27:41,535 --> 01:27:44,350
What's that little mark
you make?

1217
01:27:44,416 --> 01:27:47,711
M. E...
McEwen Expedition.

1218
01:27:47,776 --> 01:27:52,031
Whenever I've said
Lindenbrook Expedition,

1219
01:27:52,097 --> 01:27:53,951
you've written
McEwen Expedition?

1220
01:27:54,017 --> 01:27:56,832
May I remind you
that months ago,

1221
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:59,712
you gave me explicit
orders to that effect?

1222
01:27:59,777 --> 01:28:02,111
You may not
remind me.

1223
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:04,031
I don't wish your
correcting me incessantly.

1224
01:28:04,097 --> 01:28:05,951
Is that what
I'm doing?

1225
01:28:06,017 --> 01:28:07,871
You're doing it
with your looks,

1226
01:28:07,937 --> 01:28:09,792
with the posture
of your body.

1227
01:28:09,858 --> 01:28:12,957
Your entire presence is
a constant criticism of me.

1228
01:28:13,026 --> 01:28:14,236
I'm tired of it!

1229
01:28:14,306 --> 01:28:15,516
I've had enough!

1230
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:19,226
You've had enough!

1231
01:28:21,027 --> 01:28:22,271
Let me tell you...

1232
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,673
you dried-up walnut
of a man!

1233
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:27,390
If anyone's had enough,
it's me!

1234
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:28,540
It's I.

1235
01:28:28,612 --> 01:28:30,106
It's I! It's me!

1236
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,837
It's Carla Goetaborg.

1237
01:28:31,908 --> 01:28:33,315
I quit!

1238
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,234
I'm leaving!

1239
01:28:35,301 --> 01:28:40,036
May I send for
madam's horse and carriage?

1240
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:53,444
Well, at least you know
I have a temper.

1241
01:28:53,509 --> 01:28:55,876
Alec will
keep the charts.

1242
01:28:55,942 --> 01:28:57,316
Alec!

1243
01:28:57,383 --> 01:28:58,757
Alec!

1244
01:28:58,822 --> 01:29:00,796
Why can't he
stay around?

1245
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,637
Mushrooms! A forest
of mushrooms.

1246
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:59,595
They might be hundreds
of years old,

1247
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:02,278
but the small ones
we can eat.

1248
01:30:02,348 --> 01:30:03,242
They're delicious!

1249
01:30:06,349 --> 01:30:08,203
To think they grew
without sun

1250
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:10,374
this far
under the earth.

1251
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:20,237
All the food
we can eat!

1252
01:30:24,111 --> 01:30:25,997
Ha ha ha!

1253
01:30:26,064 --> 01:30:28,398
It's tougher
than leather.

1254
01:30:28,463 --> 01:30:30,699
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

1255
01:30:30,768 --> 01:30:33,670
We'll have new soles
for our shoes.

1256
01:30:36,624 --> 01:30:37,606
Ooh!

1257
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,397
It's like
an oak tree!

1258
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:22,546
Ah! Madam,
you're magnificent.

1259
01:31:22,612 --> 01:31:25,907
Mushroom steak,
mushroom soup, mushroom hash.

1260
01:31:25,972 --> 01:31:27,347
Let me say this...

1261
01:31:27,413 --> 01:31:30,708
If we'd had one more week
of that salted beef,

1262
01:31:30,773 --> 01:31:32,147
I would have perished.

1263
01:31:32,213 --> 01:31:34,547
Don't be too happy.

1264
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:35,988
After some months
of this,

1265
01:31:36,054 --> 01:31:37,461
you'll want
salt beef again.

1266
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:38,900
Yes. Months... months.

1267
01:31:38,966 --> 01:31:41,781
If we only knew
how many more.

1268
01:31:41,846 --> 01:31:44,661
There's no term
to the work of a scientist.

1269
01:31:44,726 --> 01:31:47,060
If you hadn't
been along,

1270
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:50,421
this whole journey
would have been unbearable.

1271
01:31:50,487 --> 01:31:53,782
But that's not Professor
Lindenbrook's feeling.

1272
01:31:53,847 --> 01:31:55,440
It's mine.

1273
01:31:56,472 --> 01:31:58,479
You see, we have no sun...

1274
01:31:58,552 --> 01:32:02,326
and no moon... no stars,

1275
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:04,431
but then you're here.

1276
01:32:05,592 --> 01:32:09,815
And what is the name
of the girl you love?

1277
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:11,855
I beg your pardon?

1278
01:32:11,929 --> 01:32:14,963
The girl you love...
what's her name?

1279
01:32:15,033 --> 01:32:19,255
Jenny. But why would you
want to know that just now?

1280
01:32:19,322 --> 01:32:21,231
Oh, dear Alec.

1281
01:32:21,305 --> 01:32:24,120
There are times
when it's advisable

1282
01:32:24,186 --> 01:32:26,870
to jog
a young man's memory.

1283
01:32:34,907 --> 01:32:35,954
Professor!

1284
01:32:37,307 --> 01:32:41,562
Here's some hot mushroom porridge
for you, Sir Oliver.

1285
01:32:53,245 --> 01:32:57,020
I slept as I'd never
slept in Edinburgh.

1286
01:32:57,085 --> 01:32:59,419
No street noises,
no church bells,

1287
01:32:59,485 --> 01:33:03,260
no clatter of pans
from the kitchen.

1288
01:33:03,325 --> 01:33:05,659
I may move here
permanently.

1289
01:33:10,302 --> 01:33:13,651
What's our large friend
doing over there?

1290
01:33:13,728 --> 01:33:17,273
I don't know.
Special command of His Majesty.

1291
01:33:17,343 --> 01:33:20,212
Is that madman
still giving orders?

1292
01:33:20,288 --> 01:33:22,459
This is
his rest period.

1293
01:33:22,527 --> 01:33:24,381
When you fell asleep,

1294
01:33:24,447 --> 01:33:27,262
he went off
through the tunnel.

1295
01:33:27,328 --> 01:33:31,189
He came back and ordered
the mushrooms felled.

1296
01:33:37,409 --> 01:33:39,263
What in the world

1297
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:42,145
can he want
with all those?

1298
01:34:08,548 --> 01:34:10,882
You've come
to ask me

1299
01:34:10,948 --> 01:34:12,802
why I didn't rest?

1300
01:34:12,869 --> 01:34:14,723
I don't sleep.

1301
01:34:14,789 --> 01:34:18,084
I hate those little
slashes of death.

1302
01:34:18,149 --> 01:34:20,003
It's a sea.

1303
01:34:20,069 --> 01:34:22,403
It's an ocean
with currents.

1304
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:24,804
The ocean
of the underworld.

1305
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:28,164
Some earthquake before
the beginning of history

1306
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:30,564
cracked wide open
the great sea,

1307
01:34:30,631 --> 01:34:33,446
and, through the fissures,
poured this.

1308
01:34:33,511 --> 01:34:35,365
The fissures
closed again.

1309
01:34:35,431 --> 01:34:38,726
No map ever recorded
the Saknussemm Ocean.

1310
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:42,566
I so christened it
while you were asleep.

1311
01:34:42,631 --> 01:34:45,381
It's the prerogative
of the discoverer.

1312
01:34:45,448 --> 01:34:46,822
I congratulate you.

1313
01:34:46,887 --> 01:34:50,662
There will be no more
notches to follow.

1314
01:34:50,728 --> 01:34:53,543
That's why
you ordered a raft.

1315
01:34:53,608 --> 01:34:54,623
I approve.

1316
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:12,586
If I had my gun,
we'd have fresh meat.

1317
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:14,057
That's what
he's saying!

1318
01:35:14,122 --> 01:35:15,529
He's a flesh-eater!

1319
01:35:19,467 --> 01:35:21,376
Can he swim?

1320
01:35:21,451 --> 01:35:22,826
No, thank God.

1321
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:21,684
Ah!

1322
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:46,770
Ah!

1323
01:37:52,122 --> 01:37:54,325
Aah!

1324
01:37:58,106 --> 01:37:59,600
Ahh!

1325
01:39:05,408 --> 01:39:08,986
The wind is blowing
down the street.

1326
01:39:09,057 --> 01:39:10,617
Here...

1327
01:39:10,689 --> 01:39:14,267
I brought you
some nice apples.

1328
01:39:14,337 --> 01:39:18,112
I wonder if it's cold
where they are.

1329
01:39:18,178 --> 01:39:19,738
Where they are...

1330
01:39:19,809 --> 01:39:21,184
indeed!

1331
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:23,257
Are they anyplace?

1332
01:39:39,396 --> 01:39:43,073
McEwen, put that toy away
and take over the rudder.

1333
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:45,376
Yes, sir.

1334
01:39:45,444 --> 01:39:47,331
I didn't say
throw it away!

1335
01:39:47,396 --> 01:39:48,771
It blew
out of my hand!

1336
01:39:50,245 --> 01:39:52,000
My watch!

1337
01:39:53,765 --> 01:39:55,422
Save the instruments!

1338
01:39:57,348 --> 01:39:58,242
My ring!

1339
01:39:58,309 --> 01:39:59,618
My wedding
ring!

1340
01:39:59,685 --> 01:40:02,500
A field of force
that snatches gold away.

1341
01:40:02,565 --> 01:40:04,420
This is it. This is it!

1342
01:40:04,486 --> 01:40:06,340
The junction
of magnetic forces

1343
01:40:06,406 --> 01:40:08,577
from the North
to the South Pole...

1344
01:40:08,646 --> 01:40:10,718
the center of the earth!

1345
01:40:16,902 --> 01:40:19,139
Aah!

1346
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:20,222
Aah!

1347
01:40:20,295 --> 01:40:22,018
Hang on!

1348
01:40:31,816 --> 01:40:34,631
Hold on
to your rope, Alec!

1349
01:40:49,387 --> 01:40:51,491
Aah!

1350
01:40:58,186 --> 01:41:00,095
No! Aah!

1351
01:41:34,575 --> 01:41:36,297
Is everyone here?

1352
01:41:36,366 --> 01:41:38,253
Madam Goetaborg,

1353
01:41:38,318 --> 01:41:39,693
Alec...

1354
01:41:39,759 --> 01:41:42,148
Hans.

1355
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:46,762
Gertrude.

1356
01:41:46,832 --> 01:41:49,799
And His Highness
over there.

1357
01:41:52,432 --> 01:41:57,582
So the expedition
with all the names

1358
01:41:57,649 --> 01:41:59,590
ends like this.

1359
01:41:59,665 --> 01:42:01,226
We're alive,
aren't we?

1360
01:42:01,297 --> 01:42:05,355
After all, we did hit
the center of the earth.

1361
01:42:05,425 --> 01:42:06,986
It hit us, laddie.

1362
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:17,131
He probably wants to know
where we go next.

1363
01:42:18,578 --> 01:42:20,912
Tired minds
don't plan well.

1364
01:42:20,979 --> 01:42:22,866
Sleep first,
plan later.

1365
01:42:26,644 --> 01:42:30,026
When I refused
to eat my porridge

1366
01:42:30,099 --> 01:42:32,433
when I was a boy,

1367
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:36,274
my mother used to say,
"Oliver, the day may come

1368
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:38,674
when you'll very much
want that porridge."

1369
01:42:40,916 --> 01:42:44,626
Are you surprised
that I had a mother?

1370
01:42:44,694 --> 01:42:47,955
I was thinking
how proud she'd be

1371
01:42:48,022 --> 01:42:52,146
of that little boy
who wouldn't eat his porridge.

1372
01:43:47,163 --> 01:43:48,537
Here, duck.

1373
01:43:50,043 --> 01:43:51,897
Here, duck.

1374
01:44:03,965 --> 01:44:05,012
Gertrude!

1375
01:44:09,021 --> 01:44:10,101
Gertrude!

1376
01:44:17,885 --> 01:44:18,998
Gertrude!

1377
01:44:22,975 --> 01:44:24,022
Gertrude!

1378
01:44:32,576 --> 01:44:34,102
Gertrude!

1379
01:44:39,553 --> 01:44:41,308
Gertrude! Gertrude!

1380
01:44:41,377 --> 01:44:43,002
Gertrude!

1381
01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:24,796
Hans!

1382
01:45:24,869 --> 01:45:26,331
Hans!

1383
01:45:31,845 --> 01:45:35,009
Why do you look
at me like that?

1384
01:45:35,078 --> 01:45:37,150
Hans!

1385
01:45:37,222 --> 01:45:41,924
I needed food,
so I took it.

1386
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:45,339
Professor, tell your man
to calm himself.

1387
01:45:45,415 --> 01:45:47,323
I won't engage
in a dispute

1388
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:49,341
about
a slaughtered duck.

1389
01:45:49,415 --> 01:45:50,363
Professor!

1390
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:51,650
Stop him!

1391
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:53,606
Stop this fool!

1392
01:45:53,672 --> 01:45:54,565
Hans!

1393
01:45:54,632 --> 01:45:55,646
Hans!

1394
01:46:06,664 --> 01:46:08,225
You ingrates!

1395
01:46:08,296 --> 01:46:10,717
What can you do
without me?

1396
01:46:10,793 --> 01:46:14,535
Only I can show you the way
out of this, my realm.

1397
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:15,616
Look out!

1398
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:18,024
Aah!

1399
01:46:46,061 --> 01:46:49,356
This is
the sunken city.

1400
01:46:49,421 --> 01:46:51,755
After 5,000 years,

1401
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:55,618
men behold a fragment
of the lost Atlantis.

1402
01:47:03,343 --> 01:47:07,598
All we know about it
comes from the Greek.

1403
01:47:07,663 --> 01:47:09,997
The floor
of the sea opened up

1404
01:47:10,064 --> 01:47:13,576
and swallowed the whole
island of Atlantis.

1405
01:47:16,144 --> 01:47:18,565
This must have been
the market square.

1406
01:47:20,336 --> 01:47:21,448
Professor!

1407
01:47:21,521 --> 01:47:26,311
Professor, this looks like
some sort of inn.

1408
01:47:26,386 --> 01:47:30,641
This is an inn,
an eating place, certainly.

1409
01:47:30,705 --> 01:47:32,559
Eating... what a word.

1410
01:47:32,626 --> 01:47:35,974
What a wonderful word.

1411
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:38,089
Well, we've
learned one thing

1412
01:47:38,162 --> 01:47:41,359
about the inhabitants
of Atlantis...

1413
01:47:41,426 --> 01:47:44,274
they ate oysters.

1414
01:47:57,972 --> 01:47:59,347
Stale bread.

1415
01:47:59,412 --> 01:48:02,227
We must speak
to the baker.

1416
01:48:02,292 --> 01:48:03,186
Madam!

1417
01:48:03,253 --> 01:48:04,146
Madam!

1418
01:48:05,493 --> 01:48:06,540
Ja?

1419
01:48:09,013 --> 01:48:12,787
He's asking if that was
a temple to their god?

1420
01:48:12,854 --> 01:48:15,025
Yes, I'm
sure it is.

1421
01:48:17,046 --> 01:48:19,380
It's some sort
of altar stone

1422
01:48:19,446 --> 01:48:21,901
where the
sacred fame burned.

1423
01:48:21,975 --> 01:48:23,829
It's serpentine,
isn't it?

1424
01:48:23,895 --> 01:48:26,229
Exactly.
A massive form of asbestos.

1425
01:48:26,294 --> 01:48:27,669
At a moment like this,

1426
01:48:27,735 --> 01:48:31,859
I have no pad and pencil
to record this!

1427
01:48:32,919 --> 01:48:33,867
Ah!

1428
01:48:37,463 --> 01:48:40,628
Turn around, madam.
Don't look.

1429
01:48:40,696 --> 01:48:41,873
What is it?

1430
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:47,086
The great Arne Saknussemm,
I presume.

1431
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:51,252
So this is
as far as he came.

1432
01:48:51,322 --> 01:48:55,577
Say "How do you do"
to a brave man.

1433
01:48:55,641 --> 01:48:57,975
He must have
dragged himself

1434
01:48:58,042 --> 01:48:59,896
with a broken leg.

1435
01:48:59,962 --> 01:49:01,816
Look at that tibia.

1436
01:49:01,882 --> 01:49:04,697
There is nothing edible
in there.

1437
01:49:04,762 --> 01:49:06,137
Why not?

1438
01:49:06,202 --> 01:49:10,293
The Chinese eat eggs
over 400 years old.

1439
01:49:10,363 --> 01:49:11,573
Gunpowder.

1440
01:49:11,643 --> 01:49:13,371
Professor, look
at his right hand.

1441
01:49:13,372 --> 01:49:15,259
Professor, look
at his right hand.

1442
01:49:15,323 --> 01:49:17,232
It's pointing somewhere.

1443
01:49:19,644 --> 01:49:21,978
To that shaft
over there.

1444
01:49:58,047 --> 01:50:02,717
Of course! This is what
the pointing finger meant!

1445
01:50:02,784 --> 01:50:05,118
This is the way up.

1446
01:50:05,184 --> 01:50:08,478
He couldn't make it,
but we can.

1447
01:50:08,545 --> 01:50:10,879
This is a volcanic chimney.

1448
01:50:10,945 --> 01:50:12,374
The violent updraft means

1449
01:50:12,449 --> 01:50:14,303
a direct hatchway
to the surface.

1450
01:50:14,369 --> 01:50:15,416
We can climb up!

1451
01:50:15,489 --> 01:50:16,863
Madam,
explain to Hans.

1452
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:20,475
Let him venture up
and reconnoiter.

1453
01:50:20,546 --> 01:50:23,361
The updraft
can't carry him away.

1454
01:50:44,708 --> 01:50:46,083
We'd roll up
our sleeves,

1455
01:50:46,148 --> 01:50:47,522
if we had any.

1456
01:50:47,588 --> 01:50:50,174
We mustn't hope
for too much.

1457
01:50:50,244 --> 01:50:53,059
We'll have to provide
some kind of light.

1458
01:50:53,124 --> 01:50:56,256
And food.
I'll go look around.

1459
01:50:56,325 --> 01:50:59,140
I'll comb every inch
of Atlantis.

1460
01:51:28,328 --> 01:51:30,662
If we only had
some shears,

1461
01:51:30,728 --> 01:51:32,582
we could
cut it off.

1462
01:51:32,649 --> 01:51:33,542
Could we?

1463
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:50,340
Aye-aye!

1464
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:52,516
Aye-aye!
Aye-aye!

1465
01:51:54,251 --> 01:51:55,625
Flints!

1466
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:57,545
I found some flints.

1467
01:51:57,611 --> 01:51:59,301
Good lad.

1468
01:51:59,435 --> 01:52:02,948
We won't be walking
in darkness.

1469
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:04,067
Madam!

1470
01:52:15,373 --> 01:52:18,188
I wish I had
better news for you.

1471
01:52:18,253 --> 01:52:21,155
It gives every indication
of a perfect passage upward,

1472
01:52:21,229 --> 01:52:24,709
straighter than the one
we descended, but...

1473
01:52:24,782 --> 01:52:26,604
But? But?

1474
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:28,579
There's an obstacle,

1475
01:52:28,654 --> 01:52:32,429
a gigantic block of stone
obstructs the passageway.

1476
01:52:32,494 --> 01:52:35,789
Hans said only a landslide
could ever move it.

1477
01:52:58,096 --> 01:52:59,819
No. Let him be.

1478
01:52:59,889 --> 01:53:03,664
If all his hopes
hadn't been so high.

1479
01:53:07,570 --> 01:53:08,682
Alec!

1480
01:53:08,754 --> 01:53:11,209
Yes, sir?

1481
01:53:11,282 --> 01:53:13,103
Arne Saknussemm's
haversack.

1482
01:53:13,171 --> 01:53:14,600
Get it!

1483
01:53:14,674 --> 01:53:16,943
If God is with us,

1484
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:19,344
and that gunpowder
has kept its ginger,

1485
01:53:19,411 --> 01:53:22,858
we'll make that
landslide ourselves.

1486
01:54:04,215 --> 01:54:06,998
Now, my wonderful
companions,

1487
01:54:07,063 --> 01:54:08,470
you realize, I hope,

1488
01:54:08,535 --> 01:54:10,869
that we're taking
an enormous chance,

1489
01:54:10,936 --> 01:54:12,790
but it's our only chance.

1490
01:54:12,856 --> 01:54:16,565
I guarantee that this will
blow up the obstructing rock.

1491
01:54:16,632 --> 01:54:18,420
Whether
the surrounding rocks

1492
01:54:18,488 --> 01:54:20,397
will take
the disturbance lightly,

1493
01:54:20,473 --> 01:54:21,847
that I cannot guarantee.

1494
01:54:21,913 --> 01:54:26,005
For protection,
get into the altar stone.

1495
01:54:46,555 --> 01:54:49,850
Dear God, ruler of
heaven and earth...

1496
01:54:49,915 --> 01:54:54,803
Don't set any limit
to his realm, laddie.

1497
01:54:54,876 --> 01:54:56,697
God of the universe,

1498
01:54:56,764 --> 01:54:59,252
we are in
thy merciful hands.

1499
01:55:20,894 --> 01:55:21,842
Look out!

1500
01:55:21,918 --> 01:55:23,325
Run, Professor!
A monster!

1501
01:55:27,135 --> 01:55:28,542
Let me go!

1502
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:19,677
We started
an earthquake.

1503
01:56:25,701 --> 01:56:28,351
Aah!

1504
01:57:24,619 --> 01:57:27,204
The lava
is pushing us up!

1505
01:57:55,469 --> 01:57:57,738
It's an earthquake
of unusual magnitude!

1506
01:57:57,806 --> 01:57:59,747
More likely, it's
a volcanic eruption.

1507
01:57:59,822 --> 01:58:01,577
Listen to this...

1508
01:58:01,646 --> 01:58:03,980
"Stromboli, Italy,
first eyewitness report.

1509
01:58:04,047 --> 01:58:06,381
"The capsule
of the dead volcano

1510
01:58:06,446 --> 01:58:08,715
"broke under
a tremendous explosion.

1511
01:58:08,783 --> 01:58:10,157
"Rocks of
extraordinary size

1512
01:58:10,222 --> 01:58:12,972
are being spewed out
into the sea."

1513
01:58:36,946 --> 01:58:38,800
Dammi la mano.

1514
01:58:42,386 --> 01:58:44,874
Piano, eh? Piano.

1515
01:58:51,827 --> 01:58:53,201
Passa mi vino.

1516
01:58:53,267 --> 01:58:54,477
Ecco.

1517
01:58:54,547 --> 01:58:57,034
Signora,
beva, beva.

1518
01:59:00,468 --> 01:59:02,256
Where's Alec?

1519
01:59:07,444 --> 01:59:12,332
Hans says Alec was thrown
from the altar stone

1520
01:59:12,405 --> 01:59:16,016
long before
we hit the water.

1521
01:59:20,052 --> 01:59:22,255
Non si preoccupi,
abbiamo lo scalino!

1522
01:59:22,324 --> 01:59:25,521
My immediate need
is not a ladder.

1523
01:59:25,589 --> 01:59:27,018
I need trousers.

1524
01:59:27,093 --> 01:59:29,395
Che dice?

1525
01:59:29,462 --> 01:59:31,022
Pantaloons!
Pantaloons!

1526
01:59:31,093 --> 01:59:33,941
Oh, vuole
pantalone!

1527
01:59:34,006 --> 01:59:35,794
Pantalone? Oh!

1528
01:59:35,862 --> 01:59:37,771
Don't bring them
yourselves.

1529
01:59:37,846 --> 01:59:39,601
Send a friar, a monk.

1530
01:59:42,326 --> 01:59:44,114
- Oh!
- Oh!

1531
01:59:47,447 --> 01:59:49,301
Excuse me, ladies.

1532
01:59:51,927 --> 01:59:53,520
Excuse me.

1533
02:00:01,368 --> 02:00:03,888
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!

1534
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:06,863
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!

1535
02:00:06,936 --> 02:00:09,555
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!

1536
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:12,756
Lindenbrook! Lindenbrook!
Lindenbrook!

1537
02:00:12,825 --> 02:00:13,872
Speech! Speech!

1538
02:00:13,946 --> 02:00:15,353
Speech! Speech!

1539
02:00:15,417 --> 02:00:17,205
Speech! Speech!

1540
02:00:20,186 --> 02:00:21,560
Hello, Scots!

1541
02:00:21,627 --> 02:00:23,481
If these shouts of yours

1542
02:00:23,547 --> 02:00:26,362
express some pleasure
that we've returned alive,

1543
02:00:26,427 --> 02:00:27,801
I thank you deeply.

1544
02:00:27,867 --> 02:00:32,122
However, if they're
meant as praise

1545
02:00:32,187 --> 02:00:33,562
for a successful scientist,

1546
02:00:33,627 --> 02:00:35,481
I must disclaim that honor.

1547
02:00:35,547 --> 02:00:38,002
- No!
- No!

1548
02:00:38,076 --> 02:00:42,200
No. A scientist who cannot prove
what he has accomplished

1549
02:00:42,268 --> 02:00:43,642
has accomplished nothing.

1550
02:00:43,709 --> 02:00:46,523
I have no records,
no shred of evidence.

1551
02:00:46,589 --> 02:00:48,923
I will never embarrass
this distinguished university

1552
02:00:48,989 --> 02:00:51,574
by asking
that it take my word.

1553
02:00:51,645 --> 02:00:54,198
Let me say only this.

1554
02:00:54,269 --> 02:00:56,123
300 years ago,

1555
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:59,004
a daring man undertook
a perilous journey

1556
02:00:59,070 --> 02:01:00,858
and never came back.

1557
02:01:00,926 --> 02:01:03,260
We followed his path
and returned...

1558
02:01:03,326 --> 02:01:06,741
by God's grace
and a heathen altar stone.

1559
02:01:06,815 --> 02:01:09,498
One day, someone else,

1560
02:01:09,567 --> 02:01:13,429
it may be you, my boy,
or your sons or grandsons

1561
02:01:13,503 --> 02:01:15,510
will pick up
where we left off.

1562
02:01:15,583 --> 02:01:17,492
This I know.

1563
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:20,383
The spirit of man
cannot be stopped!

1564
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,896
Splendid,
Oliver.

1565
02:01:27,968 --> 02:01:29,113
Thank you.

1566
02:01:29,185 --> 02:01:32,534
Professor, here's someone
who wants to say goodbye.

1567
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:34,584
His ship
sails at 4:00.

1568
02:01:34,657 --> 02:01:35,900
Hans, old friend,

1569
02:01:35,969 --> 02:01:38,783
we never could have
done without you.

1570
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:41,238
He has a speech.

1571
02:01:41,314 --> 02:01:42,459
Uh...

1572
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:45,498
Hello, sir.
If you...

1573
02:01:45,570 --> 02:01:48,864
if you'll ever go
down there again,

1574
02:01:48,930 --> 02:01:50,457
the center earth,

1575
02:01:50,530 --> 02:01:52,123
Hans will go, too.

1576
02:01:52,194 --> 02:01:54,398
Thank you.

1577
02:01:54,467 --> 02:01:57,762
Did you get your injuries
when the volcano blew up,

1578
02:01:57,828 --> 02:01:59,235
in the hot lava?

1579
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,794
No. It happened
at our wedding.

1580
02:02:00,868 --> 02:02:03,202
He was hurrying
from the church

1581
02:02:03,268 --> 02:02:05,242
and fell
down the steps.

1582
02:02:05,316 --> 02:02:08,284
You poor wee bride,
after all that waiting,

1583
02:02:08,356 --> 02:02:11,520
it's been no marriage
for you at all.

1584
02:02:11,588 --> 02:02:13,759
You underestimate
Alec.

1585
02:02:16,036 --> 02:02:18,076
I'm taking the night train
to London

1586
02:02:18,150 --> 02:02:19,524
then back
to Stockholm.

1587
02:02:19,589 --> 02:02:22,557
But you have a job
to do right here.

1588
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:23,840
I?

1589
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:25,284
I'm writing my memoirs,

1590
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:27,619
but I can't remember
everything that happened.

1591
02:02:27,686 --> 02:02:30,370
I see.
You need a widow

1592
02:02:30,438 --> 02:02:34,212
who can jog your memory
and take dictation.

1593
02:02:34,279 --> 02:02:37,955
I suppose I'm to report
every day from 9:00 to 12:00?

1594
02:02:38,023 --> 02:02:40,412
No. You can stay
in my house.

1595
02:02:40,488 --> 02:02:42,309
What would
Edinburgh say?

1596
02:02:42,376 --> 02:02:48,093
It's one thing to be with
a man under the earth,

1597
02:02:48,168 --> 02:02:51,016
and another under one roof
in Scotland.

1598
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:53,447
Well, uh.
What do you propose?

1599
02:02:53,513 --> 02:02:57,310
That's not a word
I bandy about, Professor.

1600
02:02:57,385 --> 02:02:59,774
What did I say?
Which word?

1601
02:02:59,849 --> 02:03:04,159
I thought it would
catch in your throat.

1602
02:03:05,195 --> 02:03:06,504
Uh, madam!

1603
02:03:06,570 --> 02:03:07,463
Madam...

1604
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:08,577
Oh, thank you.

1605
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:09,762
Uh, Madam Goetaborg!

1606
02:03:09,835 --> 02:03:11,492
Madam Goetaborg. Carla!

1607
02:03:14,059 --> 02:03:16,327
Yes, Oliver?

1608
02:03:16,395 --> 02:03:17,956
Carla.

1609
02:03:20,011 --> 02:03:21,865
I warn you.

1610
02:03:21,931 --> 02:03:24,582
I'm wearing stays again.

1611
02:03:25,582 --> 02:03:35,582
