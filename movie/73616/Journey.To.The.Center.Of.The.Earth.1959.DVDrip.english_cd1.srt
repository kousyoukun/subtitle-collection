1
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,976
Congratulations.

2
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,477
Thank you.

3
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:30,812
It's a wonderful article
in the paper about you.

4
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,817
Good morning,
Sir Oliver.

5
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:35,820
Long article about you
on page two.

6
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,321
Is there?

7
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,826
They made a mistake
about your age.

8
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,435
Paper!

9
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,139
Paper!

10
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,512
Paper!

11
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,515
Paper!

12
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,887
It's such an honor
for Edinburgh.

13
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,015
I cannot take
your money.

14
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,023
Thank you.

15
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,116
Paper! Paper!

16
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,535
Congratulations,
Professor.

17
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:58,193
? Here's to the prof
of geology?

18
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,674
? Master of
all natural history?

19
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,642
? Rare boy, he?

20
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,111
? And rare boys, we?

21
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,480
? To know such
a big curiosity?

22
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,917
? To the prof,
aye aye aye aye?

23
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:16,181
? To the best,
aye aye aye aye?

24
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,985
? To the next,
aye aye aye aye?

25
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,457
? Aye aye aye aye?

26
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,458
? Aye?

27
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,459
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

28
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,927
I'm sorry.

29
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:27,523
Since you've been
created a knight,

30
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,034
I've given your
students a holiday...

31
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,799
a day for a knight,
so to speak.

32
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,807
First, there's to
be a presentation.

33
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:40,107
Will the lad
of Glen Darrick step forward?

34
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,807
In gratitude
for the knowledge

35
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,316
you have
imparted to us...

36
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,319
That's enough
obituary prose.

37
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,386
An inkwell, I presume.

38
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,322
A very handsome thing.

39
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,327
Hellish to dust.

40
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:59,058
I thank you all from
the bottom of my heart,

41
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,828
and now, off to the playing
fields, all of you!

42
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,461
- Yay!
- Yay!

43
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,289
Ah.

44
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,518
It cost £4.17.

45
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,356
I was on the committee
that made the collection.

46
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,623
I thank you,
McEwen.

47
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,459
£5 was subscribed.

48
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,295
That left
three shillings.

49
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,800
You won't give me
the change?

50
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,802
I expended it on this,

51
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,031
a little extra token
I thought you might fancy.

52
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:44,304
I saw it in
a curiosity shop in Glasgow.

53
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:48,108
It whispered, " Buy me
for Professor Lindenbrook."

54
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,705
What did you reply?

55
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,718
I said, "Only if you can
be bought for three shillings."

56
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,151
I argued with the owner.

57
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,813
It's lava,
of course.

58
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,823
But exceptionally
heavy.

59
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,052
It could serve
as a paperweight.

60
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,992
Do you like it,
Professor?

61
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,495
It's a scholar's choice.

62
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,294
Where are you
eating tonight?

63
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:11,063
Oh, this being Tuesday,
I'm not eating.

64
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,502
Oh?

65
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,064
It's healthy to eat
every other night.

66
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,007
Be at my house at 8:00.

67
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,374
I'm entertaining
some faculty.

68
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,811
I don't think I could.

69
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,178
What's the matter,
McEwen?

70
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,012
You used to visit
my house regularly.

71
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,018
Do those frayed cuffs
worry you?

72
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,522
My other shirt
is at the wash.

73
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,057
8:00 sharp!

74
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,318
We're scientists.

75
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,020
That's one society where
frayed cuffs don't matter.

76
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,357
We've all had them.

77
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,295
Yes, Sir Oliver.

78
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,299
8:00.

79
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,303
Lava?

80
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,965
I swear there's
something inside.

81
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,706
There's Uncle now,
Kirsty.

82
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,710
And high time,
too!

83
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,379
Ohh!

84
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,384
I thought it was
Uncle Oliver.

85
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:36,387
Nothing I'm wearing
belongs to me.

86
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,888
Good evening,
Miss Jenny.

87
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,390
Good evening,
Alec McEwen.

88
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,891
I'm early.

89
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,895
I didn't know
you were coming.

90
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,898
Your uncle
ordered me to come.

91
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,092
Where is he?

92
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,135
He's never been late
like this.

93
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:53,899
To return to the subject
of my clothes,

94
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,909
they belong to the lad
of Glen Darrick.

95
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,845
"Don't go to dinner
dressed like that," he said.

96
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,849
I went
to take my bath.

97
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,680
When I returned,

98
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,778
my clothes were gone
and these substituted.

99
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,983
I have no claim to
the Glen Darrick tartan.

100
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,857
You've explained
your magnificence.

101
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,364
Kirsty, there will be
one more guest.

102
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:23,368
L'll seat you between
the dean and the rector.

103
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,371
Couldn't I sit
next to you?

104
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,373
Certainly not.

105
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,875
I notice
a certain harshness

106
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,377
in your attitude
toward me.

107
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:39,874
What do you expect when it takes
a command to bring you here?

108
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,388
Miss Jenny, why should
I torture myself?

109
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:47,392
Two years more I have to study
for my master's degree,

110
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,394
then four more as
a laboratory assistant.

111
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,989
Then there's the money
I must repay my relatives.

112
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,898
You are very logical,
Mr. McEwen.

113
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,903
It's the logic
of an empty purse.

114
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,905
How like a Scotsman!

115
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,338
I am a Scotsman.

116
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,844
I know one who didn't even
have a purse.

117
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,845
His name was
Robert Burns.

118
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:10,848
Do you know
what he said?

119
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,975
Miss Jenny, the time
of poetry is over.

120
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,850
If this is true,
Alec McEwen,

121
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:20,858
what are you doing with
your hand on my knee?

122
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:22,359
Miss Jenny...

123
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,362
Just wait in there.

124
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,864
Kirsty, I'll set
the extra place.

125
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,877
Is there something
you want?

126
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,879
A key is stuck.

127
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,881
But that's impossible.

128
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,884
It was just tuned
last month.

129
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:48,385
Which one?

130
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,888
This one.
Can't you see?

131
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:52,389
No, I can't.

132
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,858
You can see
I'm unhappy.

133
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,896
You know
how I've felt

134
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:01,899
ever since that first day
I saw you.

135
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,128
You looked
like spring.

136
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:10,574
? My love is like
the red, red rose?

137
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:16,548
? That's newly sprung
in June?

138
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:22,053
? My love is like
the melody?

139
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,420
? That's sweetly
played in tune?

140
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,925
Miss Jenny, set the table.

141
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:31,724
Mr. McEwen is fixing
a stuck key.

142
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,960
?... bonny lass?

143
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:40,438
? So deep in love
am I?

144
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,871
Shh.

145
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:48,676
? That I will love you
still, my dear?

146
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:54,482
? Till all the seas
go dry?

147
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,956
? Till all the seas
go dry, my love?

148
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:03,324
? And the rocks
melt with the sun?

149
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:08,765
? And I will love you
still, my dear?

150
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:18,141
? While the sands
of life shall run?

151
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:24,911
? So fare thee well,
my only love?

152
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:32,015
? And fare thee well
a while?

153
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:40,157
? For I'll come back
to you, my love?

154
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:50,005
? Though it were
10,000 mile?

155
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,451
Miss Jenny,
you're crying.

156
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,886
I bent over the goose...
the fumes.

157
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,260
Good evening,
Miss Jenny.

158
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,889
Good evening, gentlemen.

159
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,400
We were just worrying about
Professor Lindenbrook.

160
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:18,231
We were.
Isn't he with you?

161
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,238
Isn't he here?

162
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,898
No.

163
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,846
Careful it doesn't
go too high, Paisley.

164
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,714
It's just about
the limit now.

165
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:37,748
I gave no permissión
for visitors!

166
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,880
Oh, it's you, McEwen.

167
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:43,050
Uncle Oliver,
your guests are waiting.

168
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:46,220
If you don't come,
the goose will spoil...

169
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:47,887
Oh, goose,
goose, goose.

170
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:49,397
Tell him, Alec.

171
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:51,729
This lava
is 1 in 10 million.

172
00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:54,235
I've been at it
all day.

173
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:55,565
No pause
for lunch or tea.

174
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:57,572
You've had three semesters
of petrology.

175
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,905
From which volcano could
this lava have emerged?

176
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:02,001
Fujiyama?

177
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:03,010
No.

178
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,512
Mt. Etna?

179
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,013
Very close.
The Mediterranean.

180
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:08,516
The Lipari Islands
near Italy.

181
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:10,677
But their lava
is light.

182
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:12,516
That's what
stumped me

183
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:14,522
because inside
must be something

184
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,024
the weight of the heaviest rock
in existence.

185
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:19,027
That would be
Icelandic peridotite.

186
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:20,027
Precisely.

187
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:21,529
There's a piece
chipped off.

188
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:22,825
By me.

189
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,890
What's
the rock inside?

190
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,764
Icelandic peridotite,
naturally.

191
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:29,964
When I saw this,
I stopped chipping.

192
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,008
There's some marks
on the surface.

193
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:35,669
It looks like a letter
or notches.

194
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:39,841
Three notches made
by the hand of man.

195
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,851
But how could
a rock from Iceland

196
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:47,549
possibly pop out of
a volcano across the worid?

197
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:49,181
What's your conclusión?

198
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:52,022
Science does not
jump to conclusions.

199
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:54,528
Science is not
a guessing game.

200
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:57,225
We'll melt off
the crust of lava.

201
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,289
Mr. Paisley.

202
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,974
Add 10 cc of aqua regia.

203
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,976
Not too fast now.

204
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:11,480
I shall write to Professor
Goetaborg of Stockholm on this.

205
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:14,482
He's the worid's leading
authority on volcanoes.

206
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,848
How long
will this take?

207
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,819
A typically
female question.

208
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:21,823
Melting lava takes
maybe two hours,

209
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:23,825
maybe four hours.

210
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:25,520
Two hours?
Four hours?

211
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:26,755
Maybe
the whole night.

212
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:27,761
Who cares?

213
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:35,995
Jenny.

214
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,937
Are you all right?

215
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:55,148
That was entirely
my fault.

216
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:58,387
I don't know how it
could have happened.

217
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:01,953
Mr. Paisley, by your slip
you've rendered

218
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:04,932
an inestimable service
to science.

219
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,504
Alec!

220
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:10,664
See this?

221
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,674
What would
you call it?

222
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:15,472
As you said,
it's a manmade object.

223
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:16,842
It looks like a top,

224
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:19,347
a surveyor's instrument,
a plumb bob.

225
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:21,975
It is
a plumb bob.

226
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,485
There are letters
on it.

227
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:27,489
It's an inscription,
a message, perhaps.

228
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:31,493
Can you make out
what it says, Professor?

229
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:33,995
It's in some
Nordic tongue.

230
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:36,998
The hand that
wrote this trembled.

231
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,000
Perhaps it was
a dying hand.

232
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:41,366
Was it written
in paint? Ink?

233
00:15:41,437 --> 00:15:42,995
Perhaps blood.

234
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:44,505
Possibly.

235
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:46,508
Look at this side, sir!

236
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:48,510
A signature!

237
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:52,173
Arne Saknussemm.

238
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:54,239
Arne Saknussemm!

239
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:58,014
Will you take me
home now, Uncle Oliver,

240
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:01,352
or do I have to
go alone?

241
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:03,492
Alone.

242
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,526
Alone!

243
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:06,994
It's unthinkable,
but it must be true.

244
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:08,462
A man took tools

245
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:12,968
and went where no human being
has ever set foot...

246
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,936
alone into the interior
of the earth. Alone.

247
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,973
Who? What is he
talking about?

248
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,507
Arne Saknussemm,
the Icelandic scientist.

249
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:21,475
The greatest
of his day.

250
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,978
He was laughed at
when he claimed

251
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:26,480
there was a worid
down below.

252
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:29,484
The laughter stopped
when he disappeared,

253
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:31,486
never to be
heard from...

254
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:33,181
until tonight.

255
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:41,996
Get out of here,
woman!

256
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:44,498
I don't want any tea!

257
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:46,501
I only want my post.

258
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:47,866
Don't shout at me!

259
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:50,872
I can shout
just as loud as you!

260
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,671
For two weeks,
you haven't eaten or slept.

261
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:56,507
Out, woman!

262
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,013
Here's your post,
Uncle Oliver.

263
00:17:07,523 --> 00:17:08,956
Another day,
and still nothing!

264
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:10,993
Can you believe that?
No answer.

265
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,996
And where is Alec McEwen?

266
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:16,497
At the university.

267
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:17,998
How long does it take

268
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,001
to get a letter from
Stockholm to England?

269
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,731
Answer the bell.

270
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:27,875
We have to speak
to Sir Oliver.

271
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:30,377
Don't tell us
he's busy.

272
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:33,176
Callers? That's
all I need.

273
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:36,878
Oliver, we all know your
reputation for rudeness.

274
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:39,386
You're also
a conscientious man.

275
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:42,913
But you've skipped
every lecture for two weeks.

276
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:45,051
I'm involved in
something important.

277
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:47,254
More important
than our university?

278
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,025
Something any university
would envy us.

279
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,532
Ah, yes!
Ha ha!

280
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,726
You laugh!

281
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:57,000
What does the name
Arne Saknussemm mean to you?

282
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:59,769
Saknussemm, Saknussemm.

283
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:04,074
Didn't he write about
the lost city of Atlantis?

284
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:06,080
That was
his early career.

285
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:08,844
He's famous for
his study of volcanoes.

286
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:11,853
Out of a volcano
came this message from him.

287
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:14,355
It lay unnoticed
for 100 years

288
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:16,857
until picked up
by some peasant,

289
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:19,986
gathered dust in a curiosity shop
until it came to me.

290
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,496
Here is a translation
of the words.

291
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:26,001
"I'm dying, but my life's work
must not be lost.

292
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:29,003
"Whoever descends into the crater
of Sneffels Yocul

293
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:31,005
"can reach the center
of the earth.

294
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:32,506
I did it.
Arne Saknussemm."

295
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,507
Center of the earth?

296
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:34,543
Sneffels
Yocul?

297
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,840
That's an extinct volcano
in Iceland.

298
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:41,178
According to this, it
must lead to an unknown region.

299
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,376
But this is
sheer fantasy.

300
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:44,385
You haven't heard
all of it.

301
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:45,681
There's a postscriptum.

302
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:49,384
"At sunrise on
the last day of May,

303
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,393
the mountain Scartaris
will point the path."

304
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:54,019
What do you say now?

305
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:55,961
I'm more mystified
than ever.

306
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:57,089
Scartaris?

307
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,430
Scartaris is a mountain
peak near the volcano.

308
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:01,868
This is
a student's hoax.

309
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:03,837
Wait a second,
rector.

310
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:06,340
Let's not take
that tone.

311
00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:08,342
Let's assume
it's authentic.

312
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,344
Isn't the correct
procedure

313
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:13,347
to submit a paper
to the university officially?

314
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:15,849
You must consult
other experts.

315
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:17,852
This needs
verification.

316
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,854
Here is my paper.

317
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:23,358
I've written to
the foremost authority in Europe.

318
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:24,653
The Royal
Geological Society?

319
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:25,989
More eminent still.

320
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:27,858
Professor Goetaborg
of Stockholm.

321
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,364
Oh? And what
does he say?

322
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:32,866
I haven't
received his reply.

323
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:35,369
I've written
to him twice!

324
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:38,372
Well, then, I suggest
we relax on the matter

325
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,375
until your famous correspondent
sees fit to answer you.

326
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:44,879
Meanwhile, we could do
with some tea.

327
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:48,383
I know you two
think I'm daft.

328
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,384
Think whatever
you want.

329
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:52,886
Jenny, tea!

330
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:55,219
When did you
get here?

331
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,384
Just this moment,
Sir Oliver.

332
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,393
Look.

333
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:01,520
It's
from Stockholm.

334
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:12,907
He's got his letter
from Stockholm.

335
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:16,308
Did you see the shine
in his eyes?

336
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:17,811
There'll never
be a better moment.

337
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,906
L'll tell him about
our feelings for each other.

338
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:22,416
He'll say yes
almost inadvertently.

339
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:24,918
What if he says no
advertently?

340
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:28,423
You'll see how firm
my voice can be

341
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,425
when I speak
of you.

342
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:43,035
Blast
and damnation!

343
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,936
That devil!
Blast it!

344
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:46,599
What is it?

345
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:49,439
Don't keep us
in the dark.

346
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:50,944
Bad news,
sir?

347
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:52,947
I am stricken.

348
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:55,950
The University of Stockholm
informs me

349
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:58,953
that Professor Goetaborg
has vanished from Sweden.

350
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,955
His disappearance
follows closely the date

351
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:04,891
when my communication
must have reached him...

352
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,393
with all my material.

353
00:21:06,462 --> 00:21:09,898
He evidently didn't think it
important enough to answer.

354
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:12,092
Or too important.

355
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:17,036
McEwen, find out when
the next ship leaves for Iceland.

356
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:20,872
I will not be beaten
to my goal.

357
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:22,706
What is your goal?

358
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:24,712
You heard
Saknussemm's message.

359
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,714
Oliver, you're
seriously ill.

360
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:28,215
I am
seriously well.

361
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:30,218
Don't wait.
I said hurry.

362
00:21:30,286 --> 00:21:32,220
I must
start packing.

363
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,721
To go where?

364
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:35,723
To Iceland,
to begin with.

365
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,224
And then?

366
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:39,227
Where Arne Saknussemm went.

367
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:40,728
Oliver!

368
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:44,732
I can't wait while
that scoundrel named Goetaborg

369
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,735
exploits what I
foolishly gave him.

370
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:50,237
Don't you see
what's at stake?

371
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:53,298
The ultimate aim
of all science...

372
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,240
to penetrate
the unknown.

373
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:57,745
We know less
about our earth

374
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:00,247
than about the stars
and outer space.

375
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:03,410
The greatest mystery
is right here under our feet.

376
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:06,682
And now, if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen.

377
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:13,027
I must speak
with you.

378
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:15,120
I have no time
for words.

379
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:18,189
You must
take time, sir.

380
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,497
This is urgent.

381
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:22,036
Not for me.

382
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:24,629
I have to
go to Iceland.

383
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:26,698
I'm going with you.

384
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:27,707
Where?

385
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:29,869
To the center
of the earth.

386
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:31,708
Oh!

387
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,724
? My heart's
in the Highlands?

388
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,201
? A-chasing the deer?

389
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,000
? A-hunting
the wild deer?

390
00:22:58,073 --> 00:23:01,804
? And chasing the roe?

391
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:04,937
? My heart's
in the Highland?

392
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:07,676
? Wherever I go?

393
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,184
All Iceland
must be aware

394
00:23:10,252 --> 00:23:12,186
that the Scots
have arrived.

395
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:14,688
I wish Jenny
could hear me.

396
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:15,689
Homesick already?

397
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:18,192
It's painful
to leave your fiancée

398
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,694
on the first day
of your engagement.

399
00:23:20,763 --> 00:23:24,199
But to come back
as a worid famous scientist,

400
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:27,360
that's not
to be sneezed at.

401
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:32,701
Did you expect
a fight of stairs

402
00:23:32,775 --> 00:23:34,333
with a red carpet?

403
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,708
I neglected
to tell you

404
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:39,907
I have a nervous fear
of heights.

405
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:41,711
You'll get over that

406
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:43,843
after the first
million fathoms or so.

407
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,944
Million fathoms.

408
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:55,093
Alec!

409
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:57,223
He's been here!

410
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:04,672
He's been
surveying here.

411
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,674
This is
fresh-cut wood.

412
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:08,676
Your revered colleague
from Stockholm.

413
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:10,678
He isn't wasting
any time.

414
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:13,681
Do you think he's
already gone down?

415
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:16,684
No. Saknussemm stipulated
the last day of May.

416
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:18,185
Go back to Reykjavik.

417
00:24:18,253 --> 00:24:20,881
Buy every foot of rope
that's available.

418
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:24,517
Stock up on hardtack, bread,
chocolate, and medical supplies.

419
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,026
But more than anything,

420
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:28,029
inquire whether they
have Ruhmkorf lamps.

421
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:29,530
Have another carriage
waiting

422
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:32,692
at the foot of
the slope at sunset.

423
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,032
Can we prepare it
that quickly?

424
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:37,197
We must.
We're in a race.

425
00:24:37,272 --> 00:24:38,705
What's that
you're taking?

426
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:40,708
Jenny's
farewell gift.

427
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:45,705
L'll keep it
with me always.

428
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:01,729
Scartaris!

429
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:38,331
Back to my hotel.

430
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,265
Ja, Professor Goetaborg.

431
00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:06,658
Ah, my good man.

432
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:09,661
I assume my assistant
sent you.

433
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:11,663
No, thank you.

434
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:13,665
Nobody carries
the soldier's weapons.

435
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:15,166
And take your time.

436
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:16,668
These instruments
are delicate.

437
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,760
Easy, coachman!
Easy!

438
00:26:50,837 --> 00:26:54,933
This isn't the same road
we came by this morning!

439
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:57,169
I said, slow down, man!

440
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,884
You're out
of your senses!

441
00:27:05,952 --> 00:27:07,886
Stop your horses,
man!

442
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:09,888
This is a command!

443
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,386
Can't you hear me?

444
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:16,224
Slow down!

445
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:20,399
Stop, you fool!

446
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:30,409
Whoa!

447
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:38,917
If you've ruined
my instruments,

448
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:41,920
I'll horsewhip you,
so help me.

449
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,924
And where are we?

450
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:48,927
This certainly
is not my hotel.

451
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,577
Professor!

452
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:06,043
Alec!

453
00:28:06,112 --> 00:28:08,307
Ah-choo!

454
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:09,814
Where are we?

455
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:13,649
Apparently in
an eider feather storehouse.

456
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,381
How did
you get here?

457
00:28:15,455 --> 00:28:17,150
I don't know
what happened.

458
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:18,485
It went so fast.

459
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:20,890
I was clubbed
and overpowered.

460
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:23,896
Did you see
who did it?

461
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:26,398
No. I was
just walking.

462
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,900
Professor Goetaborg
is a criminal!

463
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:31,904
Probably he's always
dreamed of fame.

464
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:34,406
Your letter
opened the door.

465
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:36,567
Did you hear that?

466
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:37,905
Some tapping.

467
00:28:37,978 --> 00:28:40,913
Don't get your hopes up,
Professor.

468
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:42,414
There's
nobody around.

469
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:44,916
Everybody's in
the market square.

470
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:48,216
Tomorrow the fishing feet
goes out.

471
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:50,483
The shops
are closed?

472
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:52,422
No. They are open,

473
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,426
but everything
we need

474
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:56,428
was sold already.

475
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:58,054
To Professor Goetaborg!

476
00:28:58,164 --> 00:29:01,861
He stayed in the inn
where we're staying.

477
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:06,371
This time,
I heard it, too.

478
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:09,875
A fellow prisoner,
do you suppose?

479
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:13,208
He's giving us
signals.

480
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,213
It's a code.

481
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:16,543
Morse?

482
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:18,709
I can't
make it out.

483
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:20,252
Jot this down.

484
00:29:22,822 --> 00:29:27,384
Dash, dash, dot,
dot, dot, dot, long dash.

485
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,394
It doesn't make
sense.

486
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:31,896
Perhaps it's
in Icelandic.

487
00:29:31,965 --> 00:29:33,899
I don't think so.

488
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:42,373
We've established
contact.

489
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:45,468
I still can't
make it out.

490
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:48,412
My esteemed friend,
whoever you are,

491
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,415
let me introduce
myself,

492
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:52,246
Professor
Oliver Lindenbrook,

493
00:29:52,318 --> 00:29:53,945
University
of Edinburgh.

494
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:58,420
May I ask you

495
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:01,983
to interrupt your tapping
and listen?

496
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:07,625
In what language
would you like me to speak?

497
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,168
Apparently, he doesn't
understand English.

498
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:12,261
L'll try French.

499
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:14,272
Mon cher ami,

500
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,934
vous et nous
sonnes dans

501
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,671
une situation
abominable!

502
00:30:18,745 --> 00:30:20,610
It's no good, sir.

503
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,342
It sounds
more Russian.

504
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:26,451
Kak tvoe imia?

505
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:29,454
My c toboi tovarishchi
polushashche?

506
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:35,221
Gertrude!

507
00:30:38,031 --> 00:30:39,828
Gertrude!

508
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,457
Gertrude!

509
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:45,934
It's a female prisoner.

510
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:48,496
And her lover.

511
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:57,574
Professor,
they're kissing.

512
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,141
I'm sorry,
but for once

513
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,121
we must dispense
with tact.

514
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:05,589
I regret
to disturb you.

515
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:09,094
Can you get us
out of here?

516
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:19,530
Oh, Gertrude...

517
00:31:23,643 --> 00:31:25,474
It's a duck!

518
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:31,348
And I was just about
to try Latin.

519
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:35,451
You with
the gold tooth,

520
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:37,956
I'll give you
more gold

521
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:40,959
if you'll guide us
to Reykjavik.

522
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:42,460
Ja, Reykjavik.

523
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:44,963
You take us
to Reykjavik.

524
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:03,414
I understand

525
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,917
that Professor Goetaborg
from Stockholm

526
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:08,419
is stopping here,
a friend...

527
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:11,423
A friend of yours,
Professor Goetaborg?

528
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:13,425
Let's say a colleague.

529
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:14,960
May I help?

530
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:17,929
He is at home,
isn't he?

531
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:18,986
Yes. L...

532
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:21,033
He isn't at home.

533
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,931
He can't
be disturbed.

534
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:26,438
He's asleep with
all this going on?

535
00:32:26,506 --> 00:32:29,441
You cannot see him.
I'm sorry.

536
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:32,444
Here are your coins.
Here is my card.

537
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,946
Put it in his box

538
00:32:35,014 --> 00:32:37,448
so he'll know
I'm around.

539
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:38,916
Thank you so much.

540
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:49,324
Goetaborg,

541
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,955
I know you're
in there.

542
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:53,965
This is
Lindenbrook.

543
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:07,913
Goetaborg.

544
00:33:23,997 --> 00:33:27,433
Do you see
what this is, laddie?

545
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,934
The very last word
in equipment.

546
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:31,436
Ruhmkorf lamps!

547
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:32,698
Oh!

548
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:34,535
Self-generating lamps.

549
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:37,935
How long will they burn,
Professor?

550
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:39,945
My guess is indefinitely.

551
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:43,449
As long as
they're wound up,

552
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:46,451
the induction coil
will give off current.

553
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,952
Breathing devices,

554
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:50,455
like those used
in coal mines in Wales.

555
00:33:50,523 --> 00:33:51,956
All the instruments needed

556
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:53,959
for exploring
the worid below,

557
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:55,460
whatever it may be!

558
00:33:55,528 --> 00:34:00,022
I shall wait here
till Goetaborg returns.

559
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:01,657
You...

560
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:02,996
wait, too.

561
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:05,731
Goetaborg may be
a strong man.

562
00:34:15,982 --> 00:34:17,916
More treasure, sir.

563
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,918
Climbing boots,

564
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:22,921
alpenstocks,

565
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,422
blankets.

566
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:29,927
Food for months.

567
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,934
A chart with a...

568
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:43,601
P- P-Professor!

569
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:48,446
What?

570
00:34:56,189 --> 00:34:58,453
Well, Goetaborg,

571
00:34:58,524 --> 00:35:00,958
it seems there's
such a thing

572
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:02,392
as justice,
after all.

573
00:35:02,462 --> 00:35:06,899
So you wanted to
push in ahead of us?

574
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:09,400
Fate took care
of him.

575
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:11,903
Why didn't they
tell us?

576
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:15,407
Hotels rarely advertise
that they have corpses.

577
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:20,905
The Icelander
teaches us a lesson.

578
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,915
We'll observe one
minute of silence

579
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:26,918
in memory of
a great scientist,

580
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:30,422
even if he was
a blasted thief.

581
00:35:59,752 --> 00:36:01,686
Alec,
you mentioned fate.

582
00:36:01,754 --> 00:36:03,119
Slight correction...

583
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:07,125
Fate plus a few grains
of potassium cyanide.

584
00:36:07,193 --> 00:36:09,127
He was against us.

585
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:12,130
Someone was even more
against him.

586
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:13,631
Who?

587
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:48,495
I'm the wife of
Professor Goetaborg.

588
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:50,661
Oh, my dear.

589
00:36:50,736 --> 00:36:52,670
What is it?

590
00:36:52,738 --> 00:36:56,674
My husband didn't
meet me at the pier.

591
00:36:56,742 --> 00:36:58,676
Is something wrong?

592
00:36:58,744 --> 00:37:02,305
Please sit a minute
before you go up.

593
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:04,110
Please, my dear.

594
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:07,619
He seemed so well.

595
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:11,123
Early in the morning,
he went to the mountain.

596
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,648
He came back and received
a luncheon guest in the lobby.

597
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:16,058
I saw him myself.

598
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:20,121
They went up to his room
and ate.

599
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,327
What are you trying
to tell me?

600
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:25,370
That my husband is...

601
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:28,134
His guest left
about 4:00.

602
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:32,143
When the maid went
to make the bed...

603
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:33,644
Oh, dear God.

604
00:37:33,713 --> 00:37:39,083
I can't remember anyone
ever dying in my inn.

605
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:43,019
We called a doctor,
but it was too late.

606
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:47,219
We left him up there
because you were coming.

607
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:57,330
Just 10 days ago,

608
00:37:57,403 --> 00:38:01,806
he was joking on the pier
in Stockholm.

609
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:04,104
The moment
he arrived here,

610
00:38:04,176 --> 00:38:06,610
he sent me a message

611
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,944
just with one word...
"Come."

612
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:22,125
Madam,
my deep sympathy.

613
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:24,627
My name is
Oliver Lindenbrook

614
00:38:24,695 --> 00:38:26,629
of Edinburgh University.

615
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:30,633
I take it you're familiar
with that name?

616
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:32,464
Professor Lindenbrook.

617
00:38:32,536 --> 00:38:34,299
I see you are.

618
00:38:34,372 --> 00:38:36,806
I must ask a question.

619
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:40,310
I would like
Madam Goetaborg to stay.

620
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:43,609
This will be difficult
for you, madam.

621
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:47,708
Who was the last person
to see him alive?

622
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:49,650
His luncheon guest.

623
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,652
Who?

624
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:52,120
Count Saknussemm.

625
00:38:52,189 --> 00:38:54,157
Count Saknussemm?

626
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:56,159
I didn't realize

627
00:38:56,227 --> 00:38:58,821
the Saknussemm family
still existed.

628
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:01,490
They are the land's
oldest family.

629
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:04,762
A descendant of
Arne Saknussemm.

630
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:06,803
And a scientist, too,

631
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:08,702
in his own right.

632
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:10,832
He lunched
with Goetaborg?

633
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:13,638
They saw each other
every day.

634
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:16,145
They worked together
in his room

635
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:18,943
with all those charts
and instruments.

636
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:22,144
I suggest you request
an autopsy immediately.

637
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:24,153
Is there
something suspicious

638
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:26,052
about
my husband's death?

639
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:28,148
Your husband
came to Iceland

640
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:30,489
for the same reasons
that brought me.

641
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:32,995
Neither of us
could possibly suspect

642
00:39:33,064 --> 00:39:36,659
a third party would stop
at nothing to forestall us.

643
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,497
He was killed?

644
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:39,501
Poisoned.

645
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,502
Oh.

646
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:43,165
This is now
a police matter.

647
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,174
Send for them.

648
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:47,676
To your room first,
madam.

649
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:53,683
Uh... just one second,
if you please.

650
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:55,184
Thank you.

651
00:39:57,254 --> 00:40:00,189
I'm deeply distressed by
your husband's death.

652
00:40:00,257 --> 00:40:02,691
I fully understand
your feelings.

653
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,196
However, I must ask you
one question.

654
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:11,200
How do you plan to dispose
of your husband's equipment?

655
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:13,202
What does it matter?

656
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,205
L'll take it
off your hands.

657
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:18,707
We can
discuss it later.

658
00:40:18,776 --> 00:40:20,607
Time is
running out.

659
00:40:20,678 --> 00:40:24,205
My expedition must start
within 24 hours.

660
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:25,714
Your expedition?

661
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:27,216
Exactly.

662
00:40:27,284 --> 00:40:30,651
I only know of
the Goetaborg Expedition.

663
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:33,713
Husbands don't always
tell wives everything.

664
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:37,727
I don't wish to blacken
your husband's memory.

665
00:40:37,795 --> 00:40:40,229
However, I demand
that equipment.

666
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:42,561
I have a right
to it.

667
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:45,227
A right to take over
another's life work?

668
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:48,237
He died for that idea!

669
00:40:48,305 --> 00:40:51,240
He stole that idea
from me.

670
00:40:51,308 --> 00:40:52,707
That is a lie.

671
00:40:52,777 --> 00:40:54,244
Madam.

672
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:56,245
An unforgivable lie.

673
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:58,247
I would rather destroy

674
00:40:58,315 --> 00:41:00,749
every pound
of that equipment

675
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:03,184
than let you have it.

676
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:16,867
"Incredible encounter!

677
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:19,198
"A Saknussemm descendant
turns up,

678
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,205
"acts as if he were
king of volcanoes,

679
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:26,403
"tries to force me to surrender
his ancestor's secret.

680
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:30,607
"Saknussemm called again.

681
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,376
"New complication!

682
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,715
"My real adversary arrives,
Lindenbrook,

683
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:39,722
"undoubtedly to claim his rights.

684
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,190
Must fight him somehow."

685
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:56,739
Oh, uh, young man,

686
00:41:56,807 --> 00:42:00,243
would you come here
a moment, please?

687
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,176
Who are those for?

688
00:42:08,252 --> 00:42:09,685
Professor Lindenbrook.

689
00:42:09,753 --> 00:42:11,186
Ah-ha.

690
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:17,193
Ja, madam.

691
00:42:24,268 --> 00:42:27,203
Oh, at least
we have some rope.

692
00:42:27,271 --> 00:42:29,205
That's a beginning.

693
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:35,211
Tell him to stop jabbering
and go shopping.

694
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:37,213
What about lamps?

695
00:42:39,283 --> 00:42:41,217
Ah, lamps... lamps.

696
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:44,220
What about...
ah... picks?

697
00:42:44,288 --> 00:42:46,882
Oh, and provisions,
food.

698
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:50,226
What are you doing?

699
00:42:50,294 --> 00:42:52,956
Big ox.

700
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,225
Put me down.

701
00:42:55,299 --> 00:42:57,733
Somebody please
explain this outrage.

702
00:42:57,801 --> 00:43:02,170
Are we to be abducted
every day in Iceland?

703
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,176
Ja, madam.

704
00:43:09,246 --> 00:43:11,180
She speaks
Icelandic.

705
00:43:11,248 --> 00:43:12,510
I do,

706
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:16,679
but I wish to apologize
to you in plain English.

707
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:19,689
I went through
my husband's diary.

708
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:24,194
I believe I have
done you an injustice.

709
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:26,695
Don't give it
another thought.

710
00:43:26,764 --> 00:43:29,699
I'm Sir Oliver's assistant,
Alec McEwen.

711
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:32,201
This expedition began
thanks to this lad.

712
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:35,204
Began... that's all
it has done.

713
00:43:35,272 --> 00:43:38,207
If you still want
the equipment,

714
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:39,970
it's yours.

715
00:43:40,044 --> 00:43:43,275
Will you
say that again?

716
00:43:43,347 --> 00:43:45,781
I won't stand in the way

717
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:47,783
of the Lindenbrook
Expedition.

718
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:57,226
Madam.

719
00:43:57,294 --> 00:44:00,229
My husband had
boots made specially.

720
00:44:00,297 --> 00:44:01,662
I hope they fit.

721
00:44:01,732 --> 00:44:04,724
Mine will be
ready without delay.

722
00:44:04,802 --> 00:44:06,463
Your man's ordering
some for me.

723
00:44:06,537 --> 00:44:09,005
Good, good.

724
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:10,506
What was that?

725
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:13,134
Why would you need
boots like this?

726
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,043
I can't go in these.

727
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:17,546
Go where, madam?

728
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:19,105
Don't say it.

729
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:20,673
Naturally,
I'm coming along.

730
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:24,016
That's why I'm giving you
all of this.

731
00:44:24,088 --> 00:44:26,022
That's a condition.

732
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,990
You didn't mention
any condition.

733
00:44:28,058 --> 00:44:29,525
Then I do now.

734
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:32,687
Whom were you taking
besides this young man?

735
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:35,425
The big Icelander.

736
00:44:35,499 --> 00:44:37,023
Then I'll be very useful.

737
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:38,329
He doesn't
understand English.

738
00:44:38,402 --> 00:44:41,701
You can't come.
You're a woman!

739
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:45,208
What has my sex
to do with it?

740
00:44:45,276 --> 00:44:48,040
We're not contemplating
a stroll down Piccadilly.

741
00:44:48,112 --> 00:44:52,378
Professor Lindenbrook,
I've just lost my husband.

742
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:55,475
I have nothing else
to live for up here.

743
00:44:55,552 --> 00:44:58,715
Down there, I can
represent his name.

744
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:00,723
The decisión
is not yours.

745
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:04,818
The police need you
for the investigation.

746
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,159
I have already given
my testimony.

747
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:10,667
But madam, quite apart
from the appalling danger,

748
00:45:10,734 --> 00:45:12,668
think of
the inconvenience.

749
00:45:12,736 --> 00:45:15,136
The lack
of privacy!

750
00:45:15,205 --> 00:45:17,537
In short,
you don't want this?

751
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:20,008
I may be mad
about this journey,

752
00:45:20,077 --> 00:45:24,411
but to burden myself with
a female is sheer stupidity.

753
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:27,416
I may have been
a disturbance to men,

754
00:45:27,484 --> 00:45:29,850
never a burden.

755
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,184
This is
an absolute holdup.

756
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:34,690
I assure you
you will not receive

757
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:37,192
one iota of extra
consideration.

758
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:39,695
You'll sleep
where we sleep,

759
00:45:39,763 --> 00:45:42,197
you'll eat
what we eat.

760
00:45:42,266 --> 00:45:44,700
Then you accept
my proposition?

761
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,032
Oh!

762
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:20,837
Professor, look!

763
00:46:45,629 --> 00:46:47,426
There's our gateway.

764
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:23,796
Thank you, Scartaris.

765
00:47:23,867 --> 00:47:27,598
Never was there
a brighter sunrise.

766
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:30,299
Now, we descend
into oblivion,

767
00:47:30,374 --> 00:47:34,811
or we enter
the great book of history.

768
00:47:34,878 --> 00:47:36,311
Roll call.

769
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,314
Carla Goetaborg.

770
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:40,373
Alexander McEwen.

771
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:42,681
Hans und
Gertrude Belka.

772
00:47:42,753 --> 00:47:45,221
Oliver S. Lindenbrook.

773
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:48,884
What did he say?
Hans and who?

774
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:51,484
And Gertrude.

775
00:48:00,304 --> 00:48:02,204
Professor!

776
00:48:05,242 --> 00:48:06,675
Professor!

777
00:48:09,246 --> 00:48:11,339
All right,
you've arrived.

778
00:48:17,254 --> 00:48:19,188
Rather an alarming
descent.

779
00:48:19,256 --> 00:48:21,190
I found it
exhilarating.

780
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:23,692
I wonder
if Madam Goetaborg

781
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,694
will change her mind.

782
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:28,196
You make
my mouth water.

783
00:48:28,265 --> 00:48:30,699
Hans is tying the rope
on her.

784
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:31,825
I'm a fool.

785
00:48:31,902 --> 00:48:34,996
I should have told him
to tie her to a mule

786
00:48:35,072 --> 00:48:36,198
and send her home.

787
00:48:36,273 --> 00:48:38,503
What language
would you have used?

788
00:48:38,575 --> 00:48:41,510
She may be of some use
in that respect,

789
00:48:41,578 --> 00:48:45,514
then there's always the blessed
chance the rope may break.

790
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:58,718
Are you all right,
ma'am?

791
00:48:58,795 --> 00:49:00,228
Oh, quite.

792
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:03,164
Hans insisted
on a double rope.

793
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:06,532
Did he indeed?
How solicitous.

794
00:49:06,603 --> 00:49:08,264
But that was for Gertrude.

795
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:11,671
Poor Sir Oliver,
stuck with a woman.

796
00:49:11,742 --> 00:49:14,905
If only you
could see your face.

797
00:49:14,978 --> 00:49:16,673
That's my consolation,
madam.

798
00:49:16,747 --> 00:49:19,682
I don't have to
look at it. You do.

799
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:44,834
There's not enough rope
in all Europe!

800
00:49:44,908 --> 00:49:47,843
Perhaps this is
the wrong entrance.

801
00:49:47,911 --> 00:49:49,708
The sign was
unmistakable.

802
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,340
But there's no
other way to continue.

803
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:56,616
Gertrude!

804
00:49:56,687 --> 00:49:58,951
Gertrude!

805
00:50:13,036 --> 00:50:14,901
Oh, madam!
Madam!

806
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:21,744
He says there's a tunnel
on the other side.

807
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:25,247
Slanting downhill,
but walkable.

808
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:26,748
Eureka!

809
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,550
Oh, thank you.

810
00:50:38,629 --> 00:50:41,462
Now then,
a general summary...

811
00:50:41,531 --> 00:50:43,260
A... We must never use

812
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:47,201
more than two Ruhmkorf lamps
at a time.

813
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,137
B... We won't need our
breathing equipment immediately.

814
00:50:50,207 --> 00:50:53,176
Nevertheless, never
take a step without it.

815
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:55,108
C... Use our canteens freely.

816
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:57,976
There'll be many
springs on our way.

817
00:50:58,048 --> 00:51:00,744
As my husband's charts
indicated.

818
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:05,151
Is he to be with us
on our entire journey?

819
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,223
Sorry.

820
00:51:09,593 --> 00:51:13,222
Well, every journey
begins with a first step.

821
00:51:13,296 --> 00:51:16,026
May the good Lord
be with us.

822
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:17,566
Onward!

823
00:51:17,634 --> 00:51:19,659
Let's have
some music.

824
00:51:19,736 --> 00:51:22,728
Alec, will you
start us off?

825
00:51:34,818 --> 00:51:39,755
? La la la la
la la la la?

826
00:51:39,823 --> 00:51:43,259
? Boom boom boom boom...?

827
00:51:43,326 --> 00:51:45,385
? Boom-boom
boom-boom...?

828
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:22,527
Miss Jenny!

829
00:52:25,468 --> 00:52:28,403
I saw you turn pale
when the dominie spoke

830
00:52:28,471 --> 00:52:29,904
of those in peril

831
00:52:29,973 --> 00:52:32,407
at the far ends
of the earth.

832
00:52:32,475 --> 00:52:33,908
Far ends of the earth.

833
00:52:33,977 --> 00:52:35,911
At least that
would be somewhere.

834
00:52:35,979 --> 00:52:38,914
There was a clipping
in a Stockholm paper,

835
00:52:38,982 --> 00:52:40,916
a dispatch
from Reykjavik.

836
00:52:40,984 --> 00:52:42,918
I can only read
their names.

837
00:52:42,986 --> 00:52:44,419
I had it translated.

838
00:52:44,487 --> 00:52:45,920
The last news
of them was

839
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:47,854
that they went
up Mount Sneffels

840
00:52:47,924 --> 00:52:50,324
with some heavily laden
donkeys.

841
00:52:50,393 --> 00:52:51,587
Yes?

842
00:52:51,661 --> 00:52:54,858
And then the animals
came down without their packs.

843
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:55,863
And?

844
00:52:55,932 --> 00:52:57,832
And that's all.

845
00:52:57,901 --> 00:53:01,337
Oliver S. Lindenbrook,
Alexander McEwen,

846
00:53:01,404 --> 00:53:04,737
Hans Belka,
and Madam...

847
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:05,832
What's...

848
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:09,345
Why, it seems a woman
went with them.

849
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:11,346
A woman!

850
00:53:58,995 --> 00:54:01,793
You know what
they'll call that

851
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:04,800
in the Royal Observatory
at Greenwich?

852
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:08,304
A slight tremor coming
from undefined regions.

853
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:13,070
Well, we've lived
through a slight tremor.

854
00:54:13,143 --> 00:54:14,576
Let us proceed.

855
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:38,500
It seems to be
moving away from us.

856
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:41,002
In these regions,
I don't venture to say

857
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:44,006
anything is moving away
or coming towards us.

858
00:54:44,074 --> 00:54:46,440
The only thing
we can be certain of

859
00:54:46,509 --> 00:54:48,943
is that danger
is always with us.

860
00:54:49,012 --> 00:54:51,037
We might as well
ignore it.

861
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:11,698
Run!

862
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:49,771
Jump!

863
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:50,806
Aah! Oh!

864
00:56:09,859 --> 00:56:11,724
The three notches.

865
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:16,964
The three notches
of Arne Saknussemm.

866
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:18,466
What does that mean?

867
00:56:18,535 --> 00:56:20,469
We've been shown
the right path.

868
00:56:20,537 --> 00:56:21,970
We have a guide.

869
00:56:22,038 --> 00:56:23,471
Alec,
the plumb bob.

870
00:56:24,808 --> 00:56:28,972
Look! Without these marks,
we would have gone astray.

871
00:56:29,045 --> 00:56:31,741
We'd have wasted months
exploring endlessly.

872
00:56:31,815 --> 00:56:36,309
We might have taken
any one of these channels.

873
00:56:36,386 --> 00:56:41,050
But our great colleague
maketh a path for our feet.

874
00:56:47,497 --> 00:56:49,590
Well, you all
deserve a rest.

875
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:55,935
Let's have tea with
a double ration of raisins.

876
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:58,940
May I comb my hair first,
Professor?

877
00:56:59,008 --> 00:56:59,940
Oh!

878
00:57:00,009 --> 00:57:01,442
Ladies
on the left.

879
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:02,944
Gentleman
on the right.

880
00:57:21,364 --> 00:57:22,558
Oh!

881
00:57:25,201 --> 00:57:27,135
What is it,
madam?

882
00:57:27,203 --> 00:57:28,397
Shh!

883
00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:30,962
If we'd known
you had nightmares,

884
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,167
we'd have made different
sleeping arrangements.

885
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:39,306
Someone is walking
up there.

886
00:57:39,382 --> 00:57:40,872
I heard footsteps,

887
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,349
human footsteps.

888
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,852
Since the beginning
of time,

889
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:47,583
all women have heard footsteps...
up there.

890
00:57:47,657 --> 00:57:50,057
My hearing is
extremely acute.

891
00:57:50,126 --> 00:57:53,562
The hearing of all women
is extremely acute.

892
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,963
My wife used to hear
rats in the attic,

893
00:57:57,033 --> 00:58:01,595
usually, on the nights before
I had an important lecture.

894
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:02,933
Alec,
go find out.

895
00:58:03,006 --> 00:58:03,938
Hans...

896
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:05,770
Will you leave
those men alone!

897
00:58:05,842 --> 00:58:06,900
They need rest.

898
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:09,774
Moreover,
it was stipulated

899
00:58:09,846 --> 00:58:12,246
that I
give the orders.

900
00:58:12,315 --> 00:58:15,614
Don't use that
patient voice with me.

901
00:58:15,685 --> 00:58:17,983
How about
an impatient voice?

902
00:58:18,054 --> 00:58:22,650
I am a member
of this expedition.

903
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:25,523
As such, I intend to report
any of my observations.

904
00:58:25,595 --> 00:58:28,257
Alec...

905
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,458
put it down
in the record

906
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:33,001
that a member
of the expedition

907
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:35,503
reported rats
in the attic.

908
00:58:35,571 --> 00:58:36,833
Lights out!

909
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:53,921
Don't be afraid,
madam.

910
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,321
I'm right here.

911
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:48,402
Conceal these marks
completely.

912
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:54,916
L'll give them
some new ones.

913
01:00:31,854 --> 01:00:35,290
This is steeper than
anything we've encountered.

914
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,124
It's just as well we all
had a good night's rest.

915
01:00:39,195 --> 01:00:41,129
Alec, take this down.

916
01:00:41,197 --> 01:00:43,859
21 st day
of our descent,

917
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:47,801
starting from an estimated depth
of 129 kilometers,

918
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:50,100
limestone formation
continues.

919
01:00:51,374 --> 01:00:52,807
Aye-aye,
Professor!

920
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:55,309
Here are the three
notches again.

921
01:00:55,378 --> 01:00:56,811
Good!

922
01:01:02,985 --> 01:01:05,579
Gertrude!
Wrong turn.

923
01:01:05,655 --> 01:01:07,919
Let's see.
What have we here?

924
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:10,322
One heads 220 degrees
south-southwest,

925
01:01:10,393 --> 01:01:14,420
the other 160 degrees
south-southeast. Strange.

926
01:01:14,497 --> 01:01:17,830
I would have wagered
we should go that way.

927
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,164
That was Gertrude's
feeling, too.

928
01:01:20,236 --> 01:01:23,000
Are you sure
your compass is right?

929
01:01:24,407 --> 01:01:25,601
Quite.

930
01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:44,855
What's he saying?

931
01:01:44,927 --> 01:01:49,864
Hans is wondering about the
ultimate goal of our expedition.

932
01:01:49,932 --> 01:01:52,025
He's asking, "Why?"

933
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:53,796
Alec, suppose
you tell him.

934
01:01:56,038 --> 01:01:59,371
Well, why does man
freeze to death

935
01:01:59,442 --> 01:02:02,377
trying to reach
the North Pole?

936
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:04,413
Why does man suffer

937
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,005
the steaming heat
of the Amazon?

938
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:09,574
Why does he
stagger his mind

939
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:12,553
with the mathematics
of the sky?

940
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:13,987
Once a question mark

941
01:02:14,056 --> 01:02:15,990
has arisen in
the human brain,

942
01:02:16,058 --> 01:02:17,491
the answer
must be found

943
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,892
if it takes
a thousand years.

944
01:02:19,962 --> 01:02:23,693
Render that into
a few Icelandic words!

945
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:25,391
Tell him
that scientists

946
01:02:25,468 --> 01:02:27,663
have bats in
their belfries.

947
01:02:27,737 --> 01:02:28,669
Oh!

948
01:02:39,749 --> 01:02:41,910
Are you all right?

949
01:02:41,984 --> 01:02:43,918
Can you
unhook yourself?

950
01:02:43,986 --> 01:02:45,180
Hans!

951
01:02:59,435 --> 01:03:01,369
I didn't see it!

952
01:03:01,437 --> 01:03:03,371
I didn't see it!

953
01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:05,373
Never mind
about that.

954
01:03:06,943 --> 01:03:08,877
How is it possible?

955
01:03:08,945 --> 01:03:11,072
This way was
clearly indicated.

956
01:03:11,147 --> 01:03:13,877
There must
have been a quake

957
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,884
since
Arne Saknussemm's day.

958
01:03:15,952 --> 01:03:18,887
This is no
recent fissure.

959
01:03:18,955 --> 01:03:21,389
I wasn't
in a position

960
01:03:21,457 --> 01:03:22,890
to observe it
scientifically.

961
01:03:22,959 --> 01:03:25,894
We made a mistake somewhere,
but where?

962
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:49,851
What are you
doing here, madam?

963
01:03:49,919 --> 01:03:52,854
We were supposed
to stay together.

964
01:03:52,922 --> 01:03:54,355
We've been tricked,

965
01:03:54,423 --> 01:03:56,357
tricked into
the wrong tunnel.

966
01:03:56,425 --> 01:03:58,359
Those three notches

967
01:03:58,427 --> 01:04:00,361
are not
Arne Saknussemm's.

968
01:04:00,429 --> 01:04:02,363
She's right, Professor.

969
01:04:02,431 --> 01:04:05,366
Someone has passed through
before us.

970
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:07,868
No need
to ask who.

971
01:04:07,937 --> 01:04:09,871
Madam heard him
last night.

972
01:04:09,939 --> 01:04:12,874
Now she's saying,
"I told you so."

973
01:04:12,942 --> 01:04:15,001
Silently, I admit,
but she's saying it.

974
01:04:15,077 --> 01:04:17,875
When I wish
to say something,

975
01:04:17,947 --> 01:04:19,881
I say it aloud.

976
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:22,884
In view of
this new development,

977
01:04:22,952 --> 01:04:25,386
I must end
the expedition.

978
01:04:25,454 --> 01:04:29,390
But you're not a man
who frightens easily.

979
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:31,619
I'm not thinking
of myself,

980
01:04:31,694 --> 01:04:33,662
but of you...
a woman!

981
01:04:33,729 --> 01:04:36,289
I'm one
of your men.

982
01:04:36,365 --> 01:04:38,492
If a madman
is loose...

983
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:40,296
He's against us all,

984
01:04:40,369 --> 01:04:43,304
against the concept
of this journey.

985
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:50,745
What's happened now?
What's he saying?

986
01:04:50,813 --> 01:04:54,749
He said we should go back
to where Alec fell.

987
01:04:54,817 --> 01:04:57,251
It's not
on our route.

988
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,254
If we're to go ahead,

989
01:04:59,322 --> 01:05:01,756
we've no time
for detours.

990
01:05:01,824 --> 01:05:03,951
Then you wait here.

991
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:34,990
If only myJenny
were here to see this.

992
01:05:38,427 --> 01:05:39,792
? La la la?

993
01:05:39,862 --> 01:05:42,296
? La la la
la la?

994
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:43,798
? La la la?

995
01:05:43,866 --> 01:05:45,731
? Bum dee bum bum?

996
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:48,369
? Bum dee dum...?

997
01:05:48,502 --> 01:05:51,232
Now that
the boy has gone

998
01:05:51,305 --> 01:05:53,739
and Hans doesn't
understand English,

999
01:05:53,807 --> 01:05:56,742
I must ask
a delicate question.

1000
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:58,744
I'm blushing
already.

1001
01:05:58,812 --> 01:06:02,248
You're wearing stays,
are you not?

1002
01:06:02,316 --> 01:06:03,749
Professor!

1003
01:06:03,817 --> 01:06:06,251
I can hear
them creaking.

1004
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,254
It's not
your business!

1005
01:06:08,322 --> 01:06:10,756
Everything here
is my business.

1006
01:06:10,824 --> 01:06:13,759
We'll look away
while you discard them.

1007
01:06:13,827 --> 01:06:15,761
You go too far.

1008
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:18,764
The heat
will soon be excessive.

1009
01:06:18,832 --> 01:06:21,266
Nothing must impede
anyone's breathing.

1010
01:06:43,924 --> 01:06:47,052
Alec!
Leaving in a few minutes!
