1
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,478
<i>Considering where we left off,</i>

2
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,208
<i>I'm guessing
you might have a few questions.</i>

3
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,208
<i>Well, from the moment I told Noah...</i>

4
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,416
I love you.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,833
<i>Till the moment when he finally left,</i>

6
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,666
<i>a whole lot of stuff happened.</i>

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,267
<i>Let me bring you up to speed...</i>

8
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,250
<i>As soon as school ended,
the Flynns opened up their beach house.</i>

9
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,000
<i>Noah and I spent the whole summer there.</i>

10
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, my gosh!

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,476
<i>Got an awesome gift...</i>

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,750
<i>Played board games
till three in the morning.</i>

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,833
<i>Made sparks fly. This time on the beach.</i>

14
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,000
<i>Said hi to an old friend,
watched a gorgeous sunset...</i>

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,875
<i>Watched Noah sleep,</i>

16
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,375
<i>watched Noah try to rollerblade,</i>

17
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,458
<i>watched the sun come up
in my favorite way,</i>

18
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,458
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

19
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:08,083
<i>exactly 27 days ago, my heart flew away.</i>

20
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,250
<i>After Noah left, it was hard.</i>

21
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,000
<i>He said he wanted
to make long-distance work,</i>

22
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:18,083
<i>but I decided to be a grown-up
about things and to give Noah his space.</i>

23
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,958
<i>I guess that's the kind of maturity
that comes from being a senior.</i>

24
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,000
<i>In other words, I was okay.</i>

25
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,125
<i>Meanwhile, I did everything I could
to keep my mind off the fact.</i>

26
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,458
<i>That Noah was 3,000 miles away.</i>

27
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,958
<i>Like I started working
on my college essay,</i>

28
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,125
<i>started a podcast
about video games with Lee.</i>

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,333
<i>- Game On!
- Already got subscribers,</i>

30
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,000
<i>- thank you very much.</i>
- Foreign Danger!

31
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,333
<i>And finally dominated
my nemesis on Xbox...</i>

32
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,666
<i>Watched Ultimate Frisbee
at the beach house,</i>

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,625
<i>watched '80s movies with Lee and Rachel,</i>

34
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,916
<i>watched Lee fall completely in love,</i>

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,666
<i>-watched Lee get a super buff bod,</i>
-Ooh!

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,541
<i>Watched girls watching
Lee's super buff bod,</i>

37
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,791
<i>applied for a passport,
applied for a credit card,</i>

38
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,541
<i>even applied with Lee
to our dream college.</i>

39
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,625
<i>RULE NUMBER 19: Always go
to the same school as your bestie.</i>

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,875
<i>And for us, when it comes to college,</i>

41
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,583
<i>that means
the University of California at Berkeley.</i>

42
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,041
<i>UC Berkeley is this totally dope,</i>

43
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,375
<i>completely amazing school
in Northern California.</i>

44
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,333
<i>Lee and I have dreamed of going there</i>

45
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,000
<i>ever since we found out
that's where our moms became besties.</i>

46
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,500
<i>It has a really cool tower,
hill rolling for good luck,</i>

47
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,166
<i>famous Insta squirrels,
and a cool meme page.</i>

48
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,583
<i>This one's for you, Mom.</i>

49
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,166
<i>Took Brad to the arcade,
took Lee and Rachel hiking,</i>

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,267
<i>took a naughty photo for Noah,</i>

51
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,811
<i>chickened out about sending it though.</i>

52
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,166
<i>And the last thing I took was
one final moment all to myself.</i>

53
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,583
<i>By the end of the summer,</i>

54
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,166
<i>I was feeling pretty sorted out
about things with Noah.</i>

55
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,541
<i>He was where he was supposed to be,
and I was where I was supposed to be.</i>

56
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,500
<i>And if it works out for us, great!</i>

57
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,083
<i>But if not, that would be okay too.</i>

58
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,416
<i>Like I said, I was okay...</i>

59
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:04,833
<i>mostly.</i>

60
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,666
<i>And here I am
getting ready for my first day of school,</i>

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
<i>and everything seems... different somehow.</i>

62
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,833
There she is.

63
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,333
Last first day! I gotta go.

64
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,416
Mmm! Love you. Love you.

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,375
- Love you more.
- All right, I'm gonna...

66
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,000
What up?

67
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,541
What up?

68
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,708
Oh, what is this?

69
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,083
Open it.

70
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,291
Okay!

71
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,833
Very funny.

72
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:06,916
Oh, what can I say?

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,708
I thought you might need a pair
of those back-up back-ups this time.

74
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,625
Hey!

75
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,548
You should try those on, though.
I think they would look quite slimming.

76
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,375
<i>♪ Maybe we can be more... ♪</i>

77
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Hey, uh... where are you...
Where are you going? School's that way.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Going to get Rachel.

79
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,833
Oh. Gotcha.

80
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,125
<i>♪ Maybe we can be more... ♪</i>

81
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,791
What's up, foxy lady?

82
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,083
Yeah, right. As if.

83
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,125
Oh, okay.

84
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,916
Let's do it, y'all.

85
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,250
What?

86
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,291
I'm just thinking
about how insanely lucky I am.

87
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,541
All right, lovebirds.

88
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:57,833
Let's go! Senior year!

89
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,291
<i>♪ Maybe we can, hey! ♪</i>

90
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:07,333
<i>♪ Maybe we can be more
We could be more ♪</i>

91
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,458
Hey!

92
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,541
- What is going on?
- I have no idea...

93
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,041
<i>I had been feeling pretty damn good
about senior year.</i>

94
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,333
<i>That is until
everybody was looking at me.</i>

95
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,375
<i>Like my dog just died.</i>

96
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,458
- Hey, Elle.
- Hey, Tuppen.

97
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,892
Just heard about you and Noah breaking up.

98
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,809
- I was really hoping...
- No, we didn't break up.

99
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,083
I'm sorry. I thought you guys were
really great together.

100
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,500
- I just...
- That's not... We didn't... um...

101
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,291
- Was it your decision or his?
- Never mind.

102
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,583
<i>Ugh! Sometimes I hate high school.</i>

103
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,875
<i>Good morning and welcome back,
Los Angeles Country Day.</i>

104
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,166
<i>We hope you all had
the very best of summers</i>

105
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,625
and are ready
for another outstanding school year.

106
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:14,083
Any clubs wanting to present
fall fundraiser ideas to student council

107
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:18,500
- <i>must do so today at three p.m. sharp.</i>
- We forgot about the presentation

108
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,583
for the kissing booth!

109
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,041
- Oh, my God.
- Get busy!

110
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,500
And our quote of the day:

111
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:26,041
<i>"The best thing
to hold on to in life is each other."</i>

112
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:31,125
Beautiful words from an iconic film star,
Audrey Hepburn.

113
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,083
<i>Well said, Audrey. Well said.</i>

114
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,750
Have a fantastic day.

115
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,791
All right, everyone,

116
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,041
let's all take out
our summer reading material.

117
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,208
That was so good. I was so surprised.

118
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,416
Oh, and here we go.

119
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,833
Oh, my God, Ellen, how are you?

120
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,333
So many beautiful girls at Harvard.

121
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,791
- Experienced girls.
- And long distance is tough.

122
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,958
Totally explains why you guys aren't
posting on social anymore.

123
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,208
Oh, actually Noah and I decided
to keep it low-key on social,

124
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,750
so we wouldn't feel pressured by it.

125
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,416
That is so smart. Breakups are brutal.

126
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,416
So brutal.

127
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,125
We didn't break up, though.

128
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,375
With different zip codes,
breakups are basically automatic.

129
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,833
- Automatic.
- Oh, well. Gotta go.

130
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,666
I wanna take a peek at the new snack
that just transferred in.

131
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,875
Saw him in homeroom. His name's Marco,
and he is seriously luscious.

132
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,625
Ooh! I'm sorry about you and Flynn.

133
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,166
Um, okay.

134
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,250
Thanks. Bye.

135
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:51,250
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

136
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,750
Elle Evans, there's a phone call for you
in the office.

137
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,250
It's your father.

138
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,041
He said it's urgent.

139
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,083
- The phone's over there, honey.
- Okay.

140
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,708
- Gosh. I hope it's nothing too serious.
- Hello?

141
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,208
What's going on with you?

142
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,166
What? Uh...

143
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,625
What do you mean, Dad?

144
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,125
Why aren't you texting me back?

145
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,708
Well... what?

146
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,458
Um... oh, my God!

147
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,291
That's horrible, horrible news
about Aunt, um...

148
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,416
Rose.

149
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,250
Is everything okay?

150
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,375
- No.
- Uh...

151
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,666
- Could I please have a moment in private?
- Sure.

152
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,791
Just give me a second.

153
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,416
I'm stepping into the office
to take a second to process this.

154
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,791
Why are you pretending to be my dad?

155
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,142
It was the only way I could think
to get you on the phone.

156
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,625
Oh, that is not true.

157
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,041
No, it is true.
You barely call, and when you text,

158
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,541
you send
these weird two-word text messages

159
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,625
like, you know, "Take care," "Talk soon."

160
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,416
Are you breaking up with me?

161
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,583
What? No, no, no, no! The opposite.

162
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,416
Then what? Why?
Why are you ignoring me?

163
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,291
I... I don't know, I...

164
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,583
I guess I'm just...

165
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:17,125
I'm trying to be mature and not come off
like some clingy girlfriend.

166
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,583
Elle, I told you
that I wanted to make this work.

167
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,583
I know, but people always say that
when they leave.

168
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,500
I just wanted to give you space

169
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,041
so that you could figure out
if this is really what you want.

170
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,125
Space. Space. I don't...
I don't want space.

171
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,208
<i>Space is not what I want, I told you.</i>

172
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
I don't want space. I want you.

173
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,166
I want you around me all the time.

174
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,375
I want you with me right now, actually.

175
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,750
I just... I just want you, okay?

176
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,875
Text me, call me,

177
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,541
send me a messenger pigeon,
whatever it is, okay?

178
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,916
Whatever it is,
just don't give me space, okay?

179
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,375
Okay.

180
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,583
Okay.

181
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,875
First up are Elle Evans and Lee Flynn.

182
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,666
Hello, everyone. Um, we are excited
about this year's fundraiser

183
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,458
and the opportunity before us.

184
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,000
Based on the earnings from last year,
we believe that it would be beneficial...

185
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,243
Everybody in favor of Dance Club doing
a kissing booth again for the fundraiser,

186
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,291
- please signify by saying "Aye."
- Aye.

187
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,833
- Aye.
- All those against, say "Nay."

188
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,166
Nay.

189
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,875
Wait, no, I don't actually know
why I just said that.

190
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,166
Let the record show the Ayes have it.

191
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,958
The kissing booth is approved.

192
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,583
Whoo!

193
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,458
And now that that's settled,
what we're all actually curious about is

194
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,958
who you've selected
for the lineup of kissers this time.

195
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,708
Because without Flynn as a headliner
to draw in business,

196
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,958
the booth may not do so well this year.

197
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,208
- Uh, that's a good point.
- Last year is gonna be hard to top.

198
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,041
- We...
- So hard.

199
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,750
Quite true. Thoughts?

200
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,476
Well, actually,
the thoughts we're having...

201
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,041
Right. Right.
That's a good point. Great point.

202
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:03,500
Well, you know, we have decided to keep
this year's list a secret. Yeah.

203
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,416
But do not worry because I know
who a lot of you are already thinking of,

204
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,166
and the answer is yes.

205
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,666
They will be there.

206
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,250
Whoo! Thank you!

207
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,458
So, we didn't actually get anyone yet,
did we?

208
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,833
- That is correct, yes.
- Okay.

209
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,750
- <i>So how's Aunt Rose?</i>
- Oh, come on.

210
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,625
You can stop smirking now.

211
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,708
I miss you, jerk.

212
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
I miss you more.

213
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,333
So, you Big Man on Campus yet?

214
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,166
No, not exactly.

215
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,875
It's kinda different here.

216
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,333
What do you mean?

217
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,916
Well, uh...

218
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,458
What's wrong?

219
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,708
Nothing! No, nothing's wrong.
Just... doesn't matter.

220
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,875
Hey, it's okay to be homesick.

221
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,875
I'm... I'm fine. I'm... seriously,
I'm fine. It's just, you know...

222
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,583
What about you? How about you?
Have you applied to any more schools?

223
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,541
Don't even get me started on Berkeley!

224
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,958
If Lee and I both don't get in, I'm...

225
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,161
Don't tell me you've only applied
to one school, Elle.

226
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,458
I know,

227
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:18,166
but it's literally the only school
we've ever talked about going to.

228
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,250
Well...

229
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,496
you know what you could do?

230
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,000
- <i>My God. Is he about to ask me to...</i>
- Apply here.

231
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,083
As if I could get into Harvard.

232
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,934
Elle, there's over 30 schools
that you could apply to in Boston.

233
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,333
<i>And your point being that at least one
of them would accept my sorry ass?</i>

234
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:40,333
No! My point being
that if you don't get into Berkeley...

235
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,666
maybe you can come to school here.

236
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,333
<i>With me.</i>

237
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,666
I'd like that.

238
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,416
<i>You obviously couldn't see this,
but my heart just did a backflip.</i>

239
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,583
Um...

240
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,041
Okay, yeah, maybe I'll think about that.

241
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,833
Maybe you'll think about it.

242
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,166
<i>Okay, you can just think about it.</i>

243
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,041
<i>You know, all the books you have to read
if you go here, seriously...</i>

244
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,833
<i>I couldn't help but think
about rule number 19,</i>

245
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,333
<i>but here's the thing.</i>

246
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,208
<i>Who knows if I'd even get accepted
into a Boston school?</i>

247
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,625
<i>And if I didn't,</i>

248
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,583
<i>what would be the point in telling Lee now
and getting him upset over nothing?</i>

249
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,333
<i>Right?</i>

250
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,083
You have excellent grades,

251
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,000
great test scores, soccer, Dance Club.

252
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,833
And I also have a podcast
about video games.

253
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,416
Oh! So you're an influencer.

254
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,916
How many subscribers?

255
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,833
Thirty-seven.

256
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,000
Thirty-seven thousand!

257
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,041
- We can work with that.
- No, no, no, um...

258
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,083
Thirty-seven.

259
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,750
You're kidding, right?

260
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,666
Oh. Well, uh...

261
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,166
To get into top-tier colleges
like UC Berkeley and Harvard,

262
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,125
you really need to wow them
with your personal essay.

263
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,541
And yours is...

264
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,625
How shall I put this?

265
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,833
- Really? I thought I killed it.
- Hmm? What? No.

266
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,166
You didn't even wound it.

267
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,541
So, I'm redoing my personal essay.

268
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,916
Apparently it sucks.

269
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,458
Oh! New level!

270
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,625
Wonder if mine sucks.
I should probably look into that.

271
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,500
Don't want that keeping us out
of Berkeley.

272
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,625
Um, yeah. Definitely.

273
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,541
So, have you seen the new kid Marco yet?

274
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,791
Yeah. Devastatingly handsome.

275
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,833
Some are even saying
he's hotter than Noah.

276
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,666
- Really? What?
- Yeah.

277
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,666
That's crazy!

278
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,541
Oh, Lee! New level, Lee!

279
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,708
Lee? Lee! No! Lee!

280
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,958
We discussed this.
I need a regular feeding regimen

281
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,583
during my hands-free
<i>Ms. Pac-Man</i> experience.

282
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,125
What the hell is that?

283
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,750
Top score is "MVP"?

284
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,416
"Most Valuable Player"? Well,
somebody thinks highly of themselves.

285
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,375
I kind of always just figured
we'd be number one forever.

286
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,833
Look at me.

287
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:02,250
We are going to need slushies, churros
and an ass-load of quarters.

288
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,375
Surprise!

289
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,416
Hey, Evans. Come here.

290
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,083
What's up?

291
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,291
That new guy Marco, someone snagged
a video of him working out.

292
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,083
Oh, come on.

293
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,708
How hot can this guy actually be?

294
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,250
He can't be that hot.

295
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,166
<i>Hot.</i>

296
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,041
He's just a guy... whoa! Sweet mercy!

297
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,541
Jeez! Hello!

298
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,708
God! The OMGs were right!

299
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,291
<i>This guy is a snack indeed!</i>

300
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,708
Maybe an entrée!
Maybe he's also the dessert too!

301
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,166
Tell me more!

302
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,291
No, no, no.

303
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,333
Maybe he's the after-after dessert!
He's a big meal that we're having now!

304
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,041
Oh, shit! Sorry.

305
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,208
- Oh!!
- Sorry about that. Whoa! Oh!

306
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,333
He could bench you,
us together at the same time!

307
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,583
Yeah, definitely.

308
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,875
Whoa!

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,833
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah,
Do you want some of this... ♪</i>

310
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,583
I'm confused. Do I need glasses?

311
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,125
Am I looking at a tray of ice cubes
or a six-pack?

312
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,583
<i>- Am I right? It's incredible!</i>
- Shit!

313
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,875
It's like his sweat produces

Happy birthday!

342
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,916
Hey, look, it's the "get it" girl.

Baby, baby!

I bet everybody forgets by tomorrow.

346
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,916
Well, that doesn't matter

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,142
because I'm still transferring
to a school on the moon.

348
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,846
Is he really that good-looking?

349
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,881
I'm sorry. Was my description
not vivid enough?

350
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:17,000
I literally described
a hundred different ways Marco can get it!

351
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,666
Awesome.

352
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,596
I take it you're the one
from the intercom?

353
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,166
Mm-hmm, yeah.

354
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,416
But they're, you know, already calling me
the Get it Girl, but I go by Elle.

355
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,541
I don't know.
Get it Girl has a nice ring to it.

356
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,458
Cool.

357
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,125
So is that, like, your thing?

358
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,375
Carry around a guitar and remind girls
of horrible moments in their life?

359
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,916
I... I didn't mean it like that.

360
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,809
To be honest, everyone was yelling
and cheering so loud, I could barely hear

361
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,351
- what you were saying.
- That is great news.

362
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,416
Don't be embarrassed.

363
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,166
Embarrassed?

364
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,458
I... I am not embarrassed.
Get a load of this guy!

365
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,125
I am not embarrassed. No, no, no. I...

366
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,083
<i>You </i>should be embarrassed. That's right.

367
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,541
And I should be apologizing to you
for your embarrassment.

368
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,333
Well, I wasn't embarrassed either.

369
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:10,458
That's a relief, for me, even though
you said you couldn't hear anything.

370
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,291
- Exactly.
- So, yeah.

371
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,625
Anyway, nice to meet you,
but I'm a little hungry, so...

372
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,375
I'm gonna go get myself a <i>snack.</i>

373
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,708
Damn it.

374
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,625
What's going on over there?

375
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,791
I don't know.

376
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,125
It looks like you got nominated
for Homecoming King.

377
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,708
What?

378
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,681
Who the hell put your name on the ballot?

379
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,333
I did.

380
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,916
- Nice work, Tiny Flynn.
- Oh, you look so cute!

381
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,541
- Hey, pretty lady!
- Hey. Oh, I'm glad you're here.

382
00:19:55,625 --> 00:20:00,000
A package arrived today
with your name on it from Boston.

383
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,791
What? Oh, my gosh!

384
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,875
Oh, my gosh! This is so cute!

385
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
Oh, I love it!

386
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,875
Ooh, there's a card!

387
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,833
<i>Elle, sent you a hoodie
to keep you warm for your trip to Boston.</i>

388
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,083
<i>If you're up for it.</i>

389
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,875
Wait, what?

390
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,291
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my God, it's a ticket to Boston!

391
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,541
- You're gonna love it there!
- Oh!

392
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,041
So, can you make it?

393
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,041
Ta-da!

394
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,000
So, my answer is a firm yes!

395
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,500
Yeah, okay.
I think that's the responsible choice.

396
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,500
Well, I guess you're right,
because how else would I be able

397
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,958
- to do all my college interviews?
- Wait, you're applying to schools here?

398
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,958
I already sent out applications
to Boston University,

399
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,041
Tufts, Boston College...

400
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,458
And Harvard?

401
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,041
Yes, and Harvard.

402
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,041
- Noah, come on!
- Brilliant!

403
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,041
We're going.

404
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:06,375
Shit, I'm so sorry. I forgot, I've got
some karaoke today. Gotta get ready.

405
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,000
<i>Guys, yo, say hello to Elle.</i>

406
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,791
<i>- Oh.
- Hi, Elle!</i>

407
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,875
Hi!

408
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,791
<i>- Hello, boys!
- Chloe, how are you?</i>

409
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,125
<i>So, who's singing tonight, then?</i>

410
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,541
Yes? Oh, my God. Get dressed, naked boy.

411
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:21,958
<i>Scandalous!</i>

412
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,541
Hey, babe, I'm sorry. This is, uh...
This is great news,

413
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,041
<i>but I gotta go,
so we can talk about this tomorrow?</i>

414
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,500
Okay, sure...

415
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,458
<i>- All right, bye.</i>
- I can't wait to meet...

416
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,291
everyone.

417
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,083
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

418
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,000

422
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,250
<i>Not sure I even wanna see this...</i>

423
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,916
<i>Holy crap! That's a lot of money.</i>

424
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,625

427
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:53,416
<i>It was that night I decided
to hold on to Noah.</i>

428
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,833
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah.

429
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,666
Could I talk to you for a second?

430
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,500
Yeah, sure. Shoot.

431
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,333
Um, it's just about school.

432
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:13,500
I just want to know how much we, like...
Figure out, what do we, like, have to...

433
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,625
How much money we have for tuition.

434
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,833
Yeah, um...

435
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,375
I kinda think I need to know.

436
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,041
You know, I...

437
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I thought you wanted to go to UC Berkeley.

438
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,541
No, I do, I do. It's just...

439
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,250
you know, I think it's smart to apply
to some backup schools too.

440
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,541
And some of those schools are private.

441
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,666
Mm-hmm.

442
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,958
You know, without some sort
of financial aid and your help,

443
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,708
I'm not so sure we can afford
a more expensive college.

444
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,333
Don't forget I still have to pay
for Brad's school.

445
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,041
Oh... I didn't think of that.

446
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,416
- I'm sorry, Elle. You know, if I could...
- Look, Dad,

447
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,666
I totally understand. It's not a problem.

448
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Okay.

449
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,375
<i>This is definitely a problem.</i>

450
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,875
<i>Welcome to Senior Field Day.</i>

451
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,458
<i>Please report to the parking lot
to pick your teams.</i>

452
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,166
Let's see... Okay, Ollie...

453
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,517
All right, I am thinking we go
for poundage on this one, right?

454
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:12,916
Like, Tuppen would just be so...

455
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I feel you,
but can you trust me on this one?

456
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,875
Miles is phenomenal at volleyball.

457
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,625
Student Council President Miles?

458
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,166
Yeah. He's amazing.

459
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,625
Let's go, Evans, come on.
Who's it gonna be?

460
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,958
- Trust me.
- Let's go! Come on.

461
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,958
Uh, we're gonna go with Miles!

462
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,833
- Okay, Miles, you're up.
- Me?

463
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,250
Yeah, you.

464
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,500
Whoo! Here's a team shirt, my dude.

465
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,041
- Let's do it.
- And, Marco, who's it gonna be?

466
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,125
We'll take the big guy.

467
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,666
Whoo!

468
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,416
Tuppen. They've got Tuppen.

469
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,166
Good luck, Capt. Evans.

470
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,083
We're fine. We're good.

471
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,208
On your marks. Get set.

472
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,333
Elle, your shoe's untied.

473
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,083
What? Oh, thanks.

474
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,208
Go!

475
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,059
<i>Did I actually just fall for that?</i>

476
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,083
Oh!

477
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:02,916
Go!

478
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,958
One, two, three, toss!

479
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,375
Unh-unh-unh!

480
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,250
Go! Go! Go!

481
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,708
What!

482
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,791
Oh, my God! Pull!

483
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,083
Marco Polo!

484
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,833
Pull!

485
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,958
Oh, my gosh!

486
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:41,833
Whoa!

487
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,791
- Oh!
- No, focus!

488
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,333
- Oh, ho-ho-ho!
- Focus!

489
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,041
Yeah, yeah!

490
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:55,333
Oh, whoa, whoa!

491
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,083
All right, he's good. Whoo! Let's go!

492
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,958
Pull! Pull!

493
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,041
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

494
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,333
Come on, Elle!

495
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,583
Need a hand?

496
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,166
Oh! Hell no!

497
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,208
Have it your way.
See you at the finish line!

498
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:28,791
You can do it! Come on!

499
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,791
Oh!

500
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:58,986
Hey, while we're down here,

501
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,041
should we maybe go by that place
with the thingy?

502
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,291
Oh, my God! Of course. Rule number 21.

503
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,250
Should we do rule number 2?

504
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,500
- But also rule number 4.
- But also, hey! Rule number 18!

505
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,017
- Exactly! Oh, my God! Exactly!
- Whoo!

506
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,958
Hey, you know what?
I think I'll head home.

507
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:13,705
Really? Is everything okay?

508
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,458
Yeah, I'm just not feeling well.

509
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,208
Oh, okay, yeah.

510
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:20,791
Bye.

511
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:21,916
Feel better.

512
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Thanks.

513
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,541
Hey, are you guys okay?

514
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,958
Uh, yeah, I... I think so.

515
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,666
I'd better just give her a call later.

516
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,750
Yeah.

517
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:34,458
You know, Elle,

518
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:38,416
- assuming I'm the dumbest person ever.
- You used to never be good at this.

519
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,851
What's the capital of Pennsylvania?

520
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,583
Wait a second.

521
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,083

00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:36,528
- I'm impressed.
- Thanks.

533
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,500
What'd you think, Elle?

534

- with yourself enough for the both of us.
- Oh!

536
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,000
Your friend doesn't like me very much.

537
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,803
She's still upset
about losing on Field Day.

538
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,541
- Oh!
- Anyways,

539
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,541
so, is this how you spend your Fridays?

540
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,583
Just wooing the women of Santa Monica
with your fancy guitar?

541
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,416
Any requests?

542
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:57,059
- Kissing booth...
- Know what?

543
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,166
That's a shame that we have made plans.

544
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,416
But we wouldn't wanna pull you away
from your adoring fans,

545
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,125
so we'll see you later, Marco.

546
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,333
Don't do that to me! Come on!

547
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,250
I'm not asking Marco to do the booth.

548
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,083
- I don't want to.
- I'm telling you.

549
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,463
You know, give it a rest, man.
I'm not doing it.

550
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,166
No.

551
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:32,000

Ooh! That might do it!

562
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,875
- Yes! We still got it!
- Whew!

563
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,791
I love the smell of victory!

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,583
- No, you're good.
- Cool.

566
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,666
<i>And there it was.</i>

567
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,208
<i>A way to make a boatload of money</i>

568
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,166
<i>that could help cover the cost
of school in Boston.</i>

569
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,875
<i>The money was real
and could make things easier for Dad,</i>

<i>no matter which school
I ended up getting into.</i>

571
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,333
Wait,
you're not actually thinking we could...

572
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,416
Uh, win the freestyle category?

573
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,708
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

574
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,083
Well, actually,
we are pretty good at this, aren't we?

575
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,958
Pretty good?
We've had the top score for four years.

576
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,958
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
We could even make team T-shirts.

577
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:02,333
Yes! Team T-shirts! Why not?
Sure! I love it!

578
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:04,916
But if we're gonna do it,
we have to do this right, okay?

579
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,750
Training starts tomorrow
at seven a.m. sharp.

580
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,958
Wait. Training?

581
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,383
<i>"What do you want to be
in five years?"</i>

582
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,458
<i>Is a difficult question to answer</i>

583
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,333
<i>because as soon as I start to figure out
one thing,</i>

584
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:32,416
<i>something or someone changes
and makes me question everything.</i>

585
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,500
<i>And if I'm not sure what I am right now,</i>

586
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,916
<i>how could I possibly know
what I want to be in five years?</i>

587
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,125
Hey, you!

588
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:45,458
Hey, I'm sorry.
Some of the guys were over studying.

589
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,333
<i>That's why I didn't call sooner.</i>

590
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:50,208
No worries.
I'm glad you're making friends out there.

591
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,083
<i>And in two more sleeps,</i>

592
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,625
I get to come see you
and meet all of them.

593
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,392
Yeah, but we don't have to spend
the entire weekend with them though.

594
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,416
No, I want to get to know them.

595
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,375
<i>Well, one of them, at least.</i>

596
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,791
Five, six, seven, eight.

597
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:07,708
One and two and three and four

598
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,291
and five, six, seven, eight.

599
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,125
And one and two and three and four

600
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:14,000
- and five, six... whoa!
- Ugh, sorry!

601
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,203
God! We should take a break!

602
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,625
Come on, I just want
to get in one more hour of practice

603
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,166
before I leave for Boston tomorrow.

604
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,625
We only have nine weeks
to get ready!

605
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,948
Do you think that you're maybe just taking
this, like, a little bit too seriously?

606
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,166
It is serious!

607
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:28,458
I didn't...

608
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,416
I didn't want to say anything before,
but...

609
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,708
I really need the money for school.

610
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,083
Let's do it.

611
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,416
Oh, God! Look who's here.

612
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,416
Ooh! This is perfect.
We need a headliner for the booth.

613
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,250
- No!
- Everyone's obsessed with him!

614
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,333
Why?

615
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,250
You promised the hottest kissers.

616
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,291
Like last year, you get him,
everyone else will just fall in line.

617
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,833
Ugh!

618
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,458
- Fine.
- Come on.

619
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,125
Hey!

620
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,083
You two do go everywhere together.

621
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,333
Uh, yeah, yeah, we do.

622
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,708
Anyway, uh, I... sorry.

623
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,916
<i>We </i>wanted to, uh, ask you something.

624
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,125
We do this kissing booth
at the Homecoming fundraiser,

625
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:26,750
and we were wondering if you'd be one
of our kissers this year.

626
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:29,291
No.

627
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,750
No.

628
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:31,750
Why no?

629
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,541
- I have my reasons.
- Come on, dude!

630
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:34,791
It's the most popular booth!

631
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,791
And it's for charity.

632
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,458
Don't you believe in charity?

633
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:41,875
- I'm standing here talking to you.
- Hey! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

634
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,708
That was a good... one.

635
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:48,541
Okay.

636
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
I'll make you a deal.

637
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,666
I'll play you any game here for it.

638
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,458
<i>Holy shit!</i>

639
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,583
You win, I do the booth.

640
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,333
I win,

641
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,083
you babysit my sister for free.

642
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,791
Let me talk with my colleague.

643
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,750
Okay. Fine.

644
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:15,125
Uh... any game.

645
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,000
<i>And now to set the trap.</i>

646
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:20,708
Any game except... that one.

647
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:24,166
- No, no, no. I said any game.
- Okay, but that one's...

648
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,750
Well, yeah, but that one's so hard.

649
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
<i>Bingo!</i>

650
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,625
Okay, all right. Fine.

651
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,916
- Your choice.
- Sweet!

652
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,833
Oh, my God!
We got him right where we want him!

653
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,000
All righty.

654
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,541

669
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,916
Is this how you spend your Friday nights?
Conning people on the DDM machine?

670
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,041
See you at the booth, MVP! Oh, and, um...

671
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,583
you can leave the guitar at home.

672
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:52,541
Ay! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:55,708
See ya!

674
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:56,851
Oh, my gosh, that was crazy!

675
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,250
- We got Marco!
<i>- You</i> got Marco.

676
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,083
- And we have the OMGs.
- Definitely.

677
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:03,375
- And you think Rachel would do it?
- Oh, shit! Rachel!

678
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,500
- What?
- No, no, no!

679
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,791
No, no, I was supposed to hang out
with Rachel tonight.

680
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,916
- I have to leave right now! Bye!
- Yeah, go, go!

681
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:23,041
I'm so sorry.

682
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,208
I was practicing with Elle.

683
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,416
Look, Lee.

684
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:30,458
I know that Elle is your best friend,
but this has gotta stop.

685
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,000
- I mean, ever since Noah left...
- She's always around.

686
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:35,000
Exactly! You gotta say something to her.

687
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,875
I know, and I'm sorry,
but please don't blame her for this, okay?

688
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:38,958
I'm the one who forgot.

689
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,040
But it's not just tonight.

690
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:42,875
She's always inviting herself
or just showing up.

691
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:45,708
She's lonely! I can't tell her
we don't want her hanging out with us.

692
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,791
But you can leave me standing
at the movie theater

693
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,666
for 45 minutes just fine?

694
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,875
Listen, Lee. If you...

695
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,041
if you can't make
your best friend understand

696
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,125
that this relationship is important,

697
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,180
then I don't think we have a relationship.

698
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,583
- Rachel, I can't just tell her...
- Just figure out your priorities, Lee.

699
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:12,833
If I'm one of them,
then go and tell Elle that I am.

700
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,625
Good night.

701
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:31,625
I can't believe she got that mad
about you being late one time.

702
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,791
Well...

703
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,875
it's a little bit more complicated
than that.

704
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:40,083
You okay?

705
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,625
I'm just a little nervous about Boston.

706
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,541
Don't worry about it.

707
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:46,958
It's just Noah.

708
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,166
Yeah.

709
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:52,226
I love you.

710
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,090
- I love you.
- See you when you're back, yeah?

711
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,833
- Yep. Bye.
- Bye.

712
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,833
<i>But when it's been a while
since you've seen someone,</i>

713
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,666

714
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:17,375
<i>You worry you've let your guard down.</i>

715
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,166
<i>You worry they don't miss you.</i>

716
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,083
<i>And if it's been a while,</i>

717
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:26,208
<i>you even worry you forgot how
to kiss them.</i>

718
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,291
<i>You worry about everything.</i>

719
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,875
<i>There's my guy.</i>

720
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,750
<i>But now,</i>

721
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,416
<i>I'm not worried about a damn thing.</i>

722
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,416

I just keep thinking about how different
my life is right now.

743
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,083
You know what I mean?

744
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,916
And if I even think about my interviews,
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

745
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Elle, stop.

746
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:28,791
You're gonna blow 'em away. Okay?

747
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,500
Well, thank you, but we'll see about that.

748
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,125
Um.. Can I be honest real quickly?

749
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,125
Mm-hmm.

750
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,166
Like, later, when we leave here,

751
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,166
I was thinking, like,
if it's okay with you,

752
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:51,833
I'm going to treat you
like my own personal jungle gym.

753
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:57,791
Check!

754
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,666
I love this city.

755
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,333
I love this girl.

756
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,333
So, just before we get in there,

757
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:15,875
these guys are cool,

758
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,875
but they are a little intense.

759
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:21,041
Noah, I'm fine.

760
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,333
- Okay?
- Yes! Come on!

761
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,166
Okay,
that's not what that case was at all.

762
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,166
Oh, Citizens United was a classic example
of judicial activism, right?

763
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,476
- True. Correct.
- After conservatives bellyached for years

764
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,916
- about the liberal Supremes.
- Same thing.

765
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,559
- You are a hypocrite at its finest.
- Told you they were intense!

766
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,875
No! That was not...

767
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,125
<i>The only person I wanted
to meet isn't here.</i>

768
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,708
One word and an acronym!

769
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,666
<i>I wonder if it was on purpose.</i>

770
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,916
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!
Look who's here.

771
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:04,833
Oh, James!

772
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,375
She knows virtually everybody in here!

773
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,618
She knows how to work a room.

774
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:11,666
So I hear you got something special
for us tonight? I'm excited.

775
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,125
- Hello, hello, hello!
- Hey! How are you?

776
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:18,008
- You look so good! So dashing!
- Nice to see you!

777
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:21,083
Oh, hello, gorgeous. Mmm!

778
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,638
- So good to see you.
- You look beautiful.

779
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:26,000
Thank you!

780
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,726
- Come, join us!
- Thanks for answering my call.

781
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,333
- So, where were you?
- I actually have no excuse,

782
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:34,333
but I'll make it up to you tonight
on the dance floor.

783
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:37,833
- Oh, my God. Wait, no, is this Elle?
- Yeah.

784
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:43,666
I have heard so much about you.
Seriously. My God, you're gorgeous.

785
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,041
You...

786
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,875
You're gorgeous.

787
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,291
I love her already.

788
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,335
Too bad this one here's so ugly,
though, isn't it?

789
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,750
- Oh!
- Burn!

790
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,625
But he does do as he's told,
so I keep him around.

791
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,250
- Oh! Oh, Noah.
<i>- I bet you do.</i>

792
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,208
So, where were you?

793
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,750
So, today, total disaster.
The sculptor dropped out...

794
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:09,125
So, I'm in Zimbabwe, ten years old.

795
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,708
My mom was doing a research paper
on the Ndebele tribe,

796
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,708
and we're gliding down the Zambezi River,

797
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:17,083
and suddenly, we realize we're
in the middle of a mother hippo

798
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:20,708
and a baby hippo, and suddenly,
this mouth opens up...

799
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,958
- Get out of here!
- Out of nowhere and bam!

800
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,541
Bit off the front of the boat!
So, the boat starts sinking,

801
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,958
and everyone is swimming to the side,
and my mother's like,

802
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,958
"Chloe, Chloe, Chloe, are you okay?"

803
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,291
I open my eyes and I'm like...

804
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:35,416
- "Can we go again?"
- No way! You are insane.

805
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,726
All right! Shots!

806
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,083
Shots, shots!

807
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,291
You know, we actually... we need to go.

808
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,125
No! So early?

809
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:45,291
No. Elle's got college interviews
tomorrow, so...

810
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:46,708
Well, in that case,

811
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,000
here's to Elle kicking ass
at her interviews tomorrow.

812
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:49,958
- Let's do it.
- To Elle.

813
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,000
- To Elle!
- You're welcome.

814
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:54,625
<i>Hmm.
Tell you whose ass I'd like to kick.</i>

815
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:02,291
Well, Miss Evans,
that seems to be about it.

816
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:04,833
Thank you for coming in today
to meet with us.

817
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,583
Thank you for having me.
It was a pleasure.

818
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:13,500
- Elle.
- Yeah.

819
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,791
Do you mind
if I give you a piece of advice?

820
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:24,291
I had the feeling that you were searching

821
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:26,875
for the perfect answer
to a lot of my questions.

822
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,708
You should know that we're less interested
in meeting the person

823
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,250
you think we want you to be

824
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,625
and far more interested in getting to know
the person you really are.

825
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,166
Thank you.

826
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:45,416
Hello.

827
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:50,916
What's going on?

828
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,750
Is everything okay?

829
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:55,375
Gotta get to the airport.

830
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,208
Talk to me. What's up?

831
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:00,000
If you wanna talk to someone,
just check your phone.

832
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,916
Elle! Elle!

833
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,958
<i>Life throws curves at you.</i>

834
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,916
<i>You think it's moving one way,</i>

835
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,250
<i>and suddenly realize it's heading back
in the opposite direction.</i>

836
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,083
<i>So it's difficult to know what you'll want
in five years.</i>

837
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:19,500
<i>When that curve comes flying at you</i>

838
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:22,208
<i>and you're not sure
whether you should try to hit it,</i>

839
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:25,666
<i>catch it, or just step out of the way.</i>

840
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,416
<i>Dad, I just wanted to explore my options,
okay?</i>

841
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,875
Elle, it's not about any of that.

842
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,375
It's about you asking yourself

843
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:38,583
if you think a relationship
with Noah's gonna last

844
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:41,375
and if it's worth changing all
of your plans for him.

845
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,041
Do you?

846
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,125
I'm not sure.

847
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:08,583
Hey.

848
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:09,833
<i>Hey.</i>

849
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,458
I figured that we should talk.

850
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,541
Why were you so upset when you left?

851
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:18,958
Well, um...

852
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:25,625
I guess I was looking at this whole life
that you have out there without me

853
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,291
<i>and I'm...</i>

854
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:32,250
I'm definitely not used to seeing you
around all those college girls.

855
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,458
Elle, I told you, Chloe's just a friend.

856
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:37,041
<i>How did you know I meant her?</i>

857
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:38,666
Okay.

858
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,208
You don't sound convinced.

859
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:42,750
I wanna believe you.

860
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,625
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't.

861
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,541
<i>Except one reason.</i>

862
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,208
If you're telling me
thatnothing has happened...

863
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:54,000
then I believe you.

864
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,458
Good.

865
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,375
You know I love you.

866
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:03,125
I love you too.

867
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:05,625
I'm really glad we talked.

868
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,083
<i>- I'll call you tomorrow, okay?</i>
- Okay.

869
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:43,375
Hey.

870
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:47,166
Oh, hello, handsome.
I'm outside. Buzz me up?

871
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,041
Yeah, okay. See you in a bit.

872
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:54,291
- Uh... what is this?
- You, my dear,

873
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,375
have been a magnificent bore
since Elle left,

874
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,833
so I'm taking you out for some fun.

875
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,333
I think you're good for me.

876
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:07,166
Tell me something I don't know.

877
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:14,166
Damn it! I'm so sorry, Elle!

878
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,125
That's okay. All right.

879
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:19,041
- I just can't get this!
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

880
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:21,541
- I know you will.
- I know how much this means to you.

881
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,416
I hate that I'm letting you down.

882
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:27,416
Hey, Lee, hey! Look at me.

883
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,791
You have literally been letting me down
your entire life.

884
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:41,666
Oh, man.

885
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:44,416
So, how was it with Noah?

886
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,791
I think he might be...

887
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:51,375
<i>I wanted to tell Lee everything
about Noah,</i>

888
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:54,166
<i>the earring, even my interviews,</i>

889
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,250
<i>but honestly,
I didn't even know where to begin.</i>

890
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,291
It was so fun. Yeah,
we had a really good time.

891
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:03,500
- Okay.
- How about Rachel? How's that?

892
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,958
Uh, pretty much the same
as before you left.

893
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,750
I'm sorry. Don't worry, though.

894
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,434
You'll come up with something
to make her come around.

895
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:13,458
Yeah.

896
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:18,583
Yeah, I will.

897
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:21,958
Wanna practice?

898
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,000
- Let's do it!
- Okay, cool.

899
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:26,416
And then drop you.
When do I not drop you?

900
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,892
- Oh, that's right. Ever.
- That part where you don't drop me.

901
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:30,226
Five, six, seven, eight.

902
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:35,125
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

903
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:39,166
<i>♪ You belong out here with me
You belong out here... ♪</i>

904
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,083
Oh, my God, are you okay?

905
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,041
- Ow!
- Whoa! Are you okay?

906
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:45,875
- My ankle!
- Let me get you some ice.

907
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:46,958
Damn it!

908
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,750
Oh!

909
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:53,958
How's that feel?

910
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,291
- Better.
- Okay.

911
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,458
Listen, Elle,
I am so sorry about the competition.

912
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:01,875
It's okay.

913
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,458
Wait, actually...

914
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,625
you know who could totally replace me?

915
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,041
No, no, no!

916
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,916
Yeah, yes! MVP! Come on! He's perfect!

917
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,916
No!

918
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,041
Don't you still need the money for school?

919
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:23,625
Yeah, but...

920
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,958
Well, he's better than me,
and we both know it.

921
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,416
With him, you could actually win.

922
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:33,125
- Well, he's not gonna wanna do it.
- I'll <i>get </i>him to do it.

923
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:36,573
There's no way I'm gonna do it.

924
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:37,666
Why not?

925
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,625
I'm already doing your kissing booth,
which I didn't want to do, and now this?

926
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,375
I'm only asking 'cause of my ankle.

927
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,833
- I can't believe she'd want me to do it.
- No, she does.

928
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,291
She knows how good you are.

929
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,541
- And she really wants you to.
- Really?

930
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:55,250
Hey.

931
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,333
Oh, hey.

932
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,541
- So what is it?
- He'll do it.

933
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,250
- What?
- He's totally on board.

934
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:03,625
- What did you have to do?
- Nothing! He really wanted to.

935
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:04,708
Really?

936
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,000
There you are.

937
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,458
I'm here.

938
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,166
Great.

939
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:19,041
First of all, I just wanted to say

940
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,541
thank you for filling in for Lee.

941
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:24,041
So I thought we could start
with the step patterns.

942
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,458
Yeah, I mean,
I guess we could start there.

943
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:29,000
What?

944
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:31,763
Well, I just thought it might be better
to get the choreography down

945
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,541
and then focus on the step accuracy.

946
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:35,666
Listen, I've watched hours
of these competitions,

947
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,083
and the winners always have
near-perfect footwork.

948
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,541
But in freestyle,
the step accuracy is a given.

949
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:42,226
It's the choreography
that wins over the judges.

950
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,625
Yeah, exactly, which is why we're
going to start with the step patterns

951
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,750
and then go to choreography, okay?

952
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,583
Okay.

953
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:52,125
Great.

954
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,833
If that's the way you wanna do it.

955
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,041
Good morning, Los Angeles Country Day.

956
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,708
<i>Hope you all have your costumes ready</i>

957
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,708
<i>- because the seniors have secured...</i>
- Hey!

958
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,416
<i>- A very special venue...</i>
- Where's Lee?

959
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,208
<i>For the Halloween gala next weekend!</i>

960
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:14,101
Our quote of the day is brought to you
by William Shakesp... what the...

961
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,750
<i>- Give it back! Don't, Lee!
- Sorry. I'm sorry. Vivian!</i>

962
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,916
- Give that back!
- I'm sorry. Vivian, please, please!

963
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:23,333
<i>I'm sorry. I just need a second.</i>

964
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,375
Thank you.

965
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:32,583
Hey, Rachel, it's me, Lee. Lee Flynn.

966
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:35,875
Look, I'm uh...
I am totally getting detention for this,

967
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:40,000
but it's worth it because I really
just needed to talk to you.

968
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:44,041
I am so, so sorry
about everything that happened,

969
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:48,125
but most importantly,
I wanted you to know something.

970
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,333
I never told you this before, but...

971
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,833
I love you, Rachel.

972
00:54:58,458 --> 00:55:00,791
And I'm really hoping
that you love me too.

973
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:09,041
So would you please text me
a smiley face emoji for yes

974
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:11,416
and a poop emoji for no, please?

975
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,500
All right, Mr. Flynn. The show's over.

976
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,500
- Ahh.
- Let's go. Time for detention.

977
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,625
- Let's go.
- Okay.

978
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,500
Come on. Let's go.

979
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:33,083
Yes! Whoo-hoo! I got a smiley face!

980
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,250
Yeah! Whoo!

981
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,666
I got a smiley face! There's no poop!
Ha ha ha!

982
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,333
There's no poop here!

983
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:44,750
<i>Hmm. He said he'd figure out a way.</i>

984
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:47,500
<i>Guess Lee doesn't tell me everything.</i>

985
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,541
Well, I'm just glad you finally said it.

986
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,041
So, what we talked about,

987
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,583
Elle always being around,

988
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,791
did you speak to her?

989
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:03,583
Don't worry. I took care of everything.

990
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:07,000
She will be giving us plenty of space.

991
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,916
Oh, my God,
loved your speech yesterday, Lee.

992
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,833
It was hot.

993
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,500
Thank you. I was driven by love.

994
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,625
And Rachel is so sweet.

995
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,000
- And you, I'd be devastated.
- So devastated!

996
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:28,958
About what?

997
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:33,666
You mean you haven't seen the Insta photos
of Flynn's new supermodel?

998
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:40,958
Bye, Lee.

999
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:51,916
<i>Sometimes there are things that get
so stuck in your head,</i>

1000
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,583
<i>that there's only one way to get them out.</i>

1001
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:05,473
Hey, I'm at the gym. Can I call you back?

1002
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:09,916
Um, I kinda need to talk to you now,

1003
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,250
<i>actually.</i>

1004
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,000
Okay. What's up?

1005
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,000
<i>Okay. Here I go.</i>

1006
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:17,375
Um...

1007
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,666
part of the reason I was so upset...

1008
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:21,583
<i>when I left Boston</i>

1009
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,791
was because I found something
in your room.

1010
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:27,916
Okay, what'd you find?

1011
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:31,416
An earring,

1012
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:33,625
<i>under your bed,</i>

1013
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:37,916
and I wondered if it belongs to Chloe.

1014
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,208
Elle, I promise you,

1015
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:42,000
I have absolutely no idea
how an earring got in my room.

1016
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,416
That may be so, but... it was there...

1017
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,291
Okay, I know what you thought.

1018
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,708
All right.
But I'm not sleeping with Chloe, okay?

1019
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,447
I promise you. It could have been there
before I moved in.

1020
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,416
It could be my roommate's ex-girlfriend's.
There's countless reasons.

1021
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,208
It's just that knowing your past,
it's hard not to think...

1022
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,083
That's not fair. At all.

1023
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,125
Have I ever given you reason to doubt me?

1024
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,083
No.

1025
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:10,000
Okay. Then I'm asking you to trust me.

1026
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:13,375
Please.

1027
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:17,041
<i>It was heartbreaking
to hear Noah talk this way,</i>

1028
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:21,000
<i>and I knew everything for us depended
on what I said next.</i>

1029
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,375
All right.

1030
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,125
I believe you.

1031
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,083
Okay.

1032
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,333
I wish you'd brought it up sooner, but...

1033
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,250
I'm glad you told me.

1034
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:40,291
<i>When you're not sure
where you stand,</i>

1035
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:44,291
<i>sometimes a leap of faith
is the only move you can make.</i>

1036
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:00,708
Okay, okay. Hang on, hang on, hang on.
You're missing all the steps.

1037
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,166
How can we fix that?

1038
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:06,208
Okay, listen. I'm not worried about that.
The precision will come.

1039
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:08,750
What we need is something
that'll really blow the judges away.

1040
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,375
We can't even get this routine right,

1041
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:13,267
- and you want to make it more complicated?
- I want to make it more fun!

1042
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,833
That's what the audience wants.

1043
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:16,958
Something like this.

1044
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,375
<i>Holy shit!</i>

1045
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Oh!

1046
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:53,875
Sneaky, sneaky boy.

1047
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:58,500
Busted.

1048
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:00,541
Walking pretty well, aren't we?

1049
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:03,083
I'm sorry. Okay?
You had a better shot with Marco,

1050
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,000
and I knew you wouldn't kick me
off the team, so I did it for you.

1051
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,333
Are you mad?

1052
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:12,291
No. How could I be?

1053
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:15,208
- Oh, let's go.
- Okay.

1054
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:19,166
Oh, shut up! I'll show you a hurt ankle.

1055
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,708
So, how is it going with Marco?

1056
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:25,375
- It is just fine.
- Really?

1057
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:28,708
No. Don't even ask.

1058
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,458
Oh! By the way, so I know we were gonna go
as s'mores for the Halloween dance...

1059
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:36,250
I think we have a winner!

1060
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:40,125
But I have a different idea
for our Halloween costume

1061
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,750
that I wanted to run by you.

1062
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,291
Check my bag.

1063
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:45,666
Better than s'mores?

1064
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,541
Uh, yeah!

1065
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:51,875
- Right?
- Oh, my gosh!

1066
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:53,166
- Should we do it?
- Obviously!

1067
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,208
Knew you'd love it,
I know you so frickin' well!

1068
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:56,892
- This is a winner.
- I knew you'd love it.

1069
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:58,708
Love it!

1070
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:15,791
<i>Flynn's phone.</i>

1071
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,916
Uh, hi.

1072
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,875
Is, uh... is Noah around?

1073
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,750
I think he went to a concert.
I guess he left his phone here.

1074
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:25,500
Oh, um...

1075
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,250
Any idea who he might have gone with?

1076
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,125
I think he went with Chloe.

1077
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:33,125
Oh. Uh...

1078
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:35,291
okay, uh, thanks.

1079
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:36,375
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

1080
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,333
Whoo!

1081
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,500
Seriously?

1082
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:52,875
What is the big deal?

1083
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:56,250
Oh, my God! The big deal is that
the competition is literally in four weeks

1084
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:59,416
- and the routine is a complete nightmare!
- I think you're exaggerating.

1085
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,250
No, listen, if you don't want to take this
seriously, we should just call it off.

1086
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,041
Okay, time out.

1087
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,375
So I'm using every free hour I have,

1088
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,583
practicing into the night
for this competition

1089
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,208
that you asked me to help you with,

1090
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:15,208
just so I could screw things up for you?

1091
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:20,666
No.

1092
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,583
No, I'm sorry.

1093
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:29,375
I'm just kinda going through some stuff
right now.

1094
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,166
Look, you have to trust me.

1095
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:39,166
If we can't have fun, it's gonna show
in our scores with the judges.

1096
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,250
I'm having fun.

1097
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,625
Sure about that?

1098
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:46,666
Watch yourself. I recorded us.

1099
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,166
Here.

1100
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,291
Oh, my God.

1101
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:57,291
You're just thinking too much.

1102
01:02:57,375 --> 01:03:00,250
You just gotta let go, feel the music.

1103
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:06,116
Why did you and Lee start doing this
in the first place?

1104
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,250
'Cause it was fun.

1105
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:18,666
I'm sorry I've been giving you
so much shit.

1106
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,583
Ah, it's okay.

1107
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:23,976
I'm starting to think I really need
to work on my footwork.

1108
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,833
- Shut up!
- Look at this!

1109
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:29,916
You hungry?

1110
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,559
- I'm so glad we took a break.
- Yeah, for once.

1111
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:38,916
- I can be a little obsessive.
- You put a lot of pressure on yourself.

1112
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:42,458
Yeah, well how else
are you gonna get what you want?

1113
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,416
I don't know.

1114
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,458
I don't like making plans.
I just kinda roll with things.

1115
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:49,583
Yeah, but...

1116
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,166
what do you wanna do?

1117
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,208
Not sure.

1118
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,375
Be happy, I guess.

1119
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:05,291
But I gotta say, you inspire me.

1120
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:07,125
Me?

1121
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:09,184
You know what you want,
and you go after it.

1122
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:10,041
No.

1123
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:12,458
No, no.
That is the wrong impression of me.

1124
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,341
I have no idea what I want to do
with my life.

1125
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,833
You make things happen.

1126
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:18,875
I admire it.

1127
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,250
Well, I was gonna say that I...

1128
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:26,583
admire <i>you</i> for just wanting to be happy.

1129
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,625
I really am grateful for your help,
by the way.

1130
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,833
I'm not exactly rich,
so this is is kinda like my moonshot

1131
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,083
to pick where I wanna go to school.

1132
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,166
What do you mean?

1133
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:47,708
It's like something amazing
that you want really badly,

1134
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,666
but it's not super likely to happen.

1135
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,833
Like winning the DDM tournament.

1136
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,583
No pressure.

1137
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,500
Hmm.

1138
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,208
"Moonshot."

1139
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,625
Feels like pressure.

1140
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:03,291
Actually, it is. Yeah. Tons of pressure.

1141
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:14,041
So... Noah's in Boston and...

1142
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,250
and I mean...

1143
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:22,125
I don't need to get into all the details,
but there's this girl...

1144
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,416
And you think he's involved with her?

1145
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,250
I don't know. I mean...

1146
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:28,750
I mean, he says he's not.

1147
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:34,916
It's funny 'cause when he left,
I kinda had just assumed

1148
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,666
that he would meet someone else

1149
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,208
and then it would just be over for us,
you know?

1150
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,166
Do you think
you and Noah were meant to be together?

1151
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:48,958
I always thought we were.

1152
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,416
But now...

1153
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,333
I don't know.

1154
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:59,833
It's like I'm trying so hard
to hold on to this...

1155
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:03,875
thing, and it just feels
like it's slipping away.

1156
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:11,500
I don't know Flynn,

1157
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:15,166
but if I found someone who I loved,

1158
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:19,083
that was smart and funny

1159
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,458
and liked the same stuff I liked,

1160
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:25,500
I'd never make her feel like that.

1161
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,708
Wouldn't let her get away, huh?

1162
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,458
I don't see it like that.

1163
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,958
You can't really hold on to someone.

1164
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:39,833
'Cause the tighter you hold on to them,
the more they wanna slip away.

1165
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,333
All you can do is love them...

1166
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:47,041
and make sure they know
that you're never gonna slip away.

1167
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,458
Uh, I don't know
if I'm saying that right.

1168
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:57,500
No, you're... saying it perfectly.

1169
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,791
So are you gonna go
to the Halloween dance?

1170
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:06,875
I don't know yet.

1171
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:11,291
- Oh, right. Sorry, no plans. My bad.
- Exactly.

to call you last night.

1177
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:24,957
I went out,
and I just left my phone at home.

1178

That's okay. Uh, did you have fun?

1179
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,082
Yeah, it was nice.
We saw this pretty great band.

What do you think?

1192
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,166
- What? That's so unfair!
- Oh!

1193

Oh, hey! How's it going?

1195
01:09:11,082 --> 01:09:13,457
Look at my stupid pumpkin,
compared to his.

Elle and I kinda got carried away.

Okay, well, I guess we can just go, then.

Hey, Lee, let's go for a walk.

Rachel, I'm really, really sorry
about the costume mix-up.

01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,916
I had Lee switch it at the very last...

Rachel, I had no idea
that you were feeling this way...

1338
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:40,666
How can you stand there and say that

1339
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:44,666
I'm leaving now, and I'm going to my house

Is everything okay?

1421
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:48,208
Yeah, um, just tired.
We've been rehearsing.

1422
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:51,875
Okay, well, I just wanted to wish you luck
for your competition tomorrow.

1423
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,500
You remembered.

1424
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:57,208
Yeah, of course I remembered.

1426

1427
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:06,750
that we need to talk about,
but I'd rather do it face-to-face.

1428
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:09,833
So I'm gonna be home
the day after tomorrow for Thanksgiving,

1429
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:13,166

Hello! I'm Toni.
I'm one of your judges tonight

1492
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:46,833
and a professor
at the University of Southern California's.

1493
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:49,833
Interactive Media
and Video Gaming Department.

1494
01:30:49,916 --> 01:30:53,166
It's so exciting to be a part of the event
this year.

1495
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:56,375
This has been
our fiercest competition yet.

1496
01:30:57,041 --> 01:31:01,416
I'm proud to announce that this year's

1497
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:03,958
Drum roll, please.

01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:07,208
Elle Evans and Marco Peña!

1499
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:22,791
<i>Anyone trying to figure out</i>

<i>Just as a great writer once said,</i>

1502

<i>"Perhaps the Earth was made round</i>

1503

1504
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,875
<i>We set out on journeys full of hopes
and expectations, but when we arrive,</i>

1505
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:44,041
<i>the destination never ends up looking
exactly the way we had hoped it would.</i>

1506
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:46,333
Elle, wait. Please, stop!

1507
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:51,333
I'm sorry, but I just can't deal
with this right now.

1508
01:31:51,416 --> 01:31:53,616
So you're just gonna ignore
what's happening between us?

1509
01:31:53,666 --> 01:31:56,306
I'm really sorry. Can we just please
talk about this later? Please.

1510
01:32:01,833 --> 01:32:02,958
Congratulations.

1511
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:09,916
<i>The next day,
Noah still wasn't answering my texts.</i>

1512
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:13,958

1513
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:18,708
- Hey! The Evans clan arrives!
- Hi!

1514
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:20,875
<i>Hopefully,
Thanksgiving dinner at the Flynns</i>

1515
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:22,500

1516
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,541
Wait! Rachel!

1517
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:32,666
Rachel, I've been trying to text you!

1518
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,375
Elle, I'm not in the mood.

1519
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:36,538
- I know that you're upset, but...
- Seriously, Elle.

1520
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:40,351
Seriously, can you just talk to me?
Like, I don't know what's going on.

1521
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:42,976
- Happy Thanksgiving, y'all.
- Happy Thanksgiving, Lee!

1522
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,708
Dude, what the hell?
Rachel's still so pissed at me.

1523
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:48,333
Yeah, well, that would make two of us.

1524
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:49,958
Why are you mad?

1525
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:52,750
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the answer is in here.

1526
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:57,666
Shit!

1527
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,750
Gosh, wait, Lee. Listen to me. I'm...

1528
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:01,833
- We're back!
- Hey!

1529
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:05,375
- Ah, Chloe! Good to finally meet you.
- Well, it's lovely to meet you too.

1530
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:07,541
- Yeah. Come inside.
- Ooh! Wow.

1531
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,750
Oh, and Elle, you are here!

1532
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,541
Yeah, and so are you.

1533
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:14,745
Noah said he wasn't sure
that you would be.

1534
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:17,000
Really? Is that what he said?

1535
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:18,083
Dinner's ready!

1536
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:29,791
Careful with those yams.

1537
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:33,833
You're can get drunk off those.

1538
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:35,875
Lee, do you wanna go talk for a second?

1539
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:37,208
Not really, no.

1540
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:38,541
Can we please just go talk?

1541
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,791
Talking. I always feel like talking's
better when it's face-to-face.

1542
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:44,333
- Lee.
- So, Chloe, I hear Boston sucks.

1543
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:46,458
I'm not really sure how to answer that.

1544
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:49,184
It's fine if that's where people want
to live, but you shouldn't lie about it.

1545
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:53,041
Lying. Lying is an interesting topic
of conversation.

1546
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:55,583
Of course, people aren't always
making decisions alone.

1547
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:58,583
You know, sometimes they need convincing
to do the really stupid shit.

1548
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,166
- Lee!
- You need to shut your mouth.

1549
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,041
You need to leave Lee out of this.

1550
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:04,541
Why are you acting like I'm the one
that did something wrong?

1551
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:06,375
Noah, you...

1552
01:34:06,916 --> 01:34:08,583
you don't wanna go there right now.

1553
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:11,000
And, Lee, listen.

1554
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:14,833
I am actually really sorry about applying
to schools in Boston, and, Rachel,

1555
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:16,875
I don't even know
why you're mad at me right now.

1556
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:20,208
So you're just gonna pretend
that Lee never told you

1557
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:23,458
that we needed space
from you constantly hanging around us?

1558
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,750
What?

1559
01:34:29,541 --> 01:34:30,708
Lee, you never...

1560
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:35,333
- Lee, you never said that.
- Yes, he did! Lee, tell her.

1561
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:49,458
I tried to, but...

1562
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:54,916
Rach. Rach.

1563
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,458
- Oh, my... I am so...
- Rach.

1564
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:01,875
Thank you for the invitation. I just...

1565
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:03,500
- Rachel.
- Rachel.

1566
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:05,833
Rachel.

1567
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:10,833
Rachel. Rachel, please!

1568
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,375
She's my best friend.

1569
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:15,750
You lied to me!

1570
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:19,333
And you let me say all
of those horrible things to her.

1571
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:24,000
I heard what you said
at your birthday party when Elle ran out.

1572
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,250
<i>Elle, what's wrong?</i>

1573
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:27,958
I followed you two.

1574
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:29,875
<i>I love you.</i>

1575
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,750
But being my best friend

1576
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:36,541
doesn't give you the right to tell me
who I can love.

1577
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:38,791
It's like with Rachel.

1578
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:41,833
What if I didn't like having her around?
What would you do then?

1579
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:45,083
- I guess I'd break up with her.
- No, you see,

1580
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:46,541
you shouldn't have to do that

1581
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,833
<i>just because I didn't want you
to be with her.</i>

1582
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,958
But you don't have to break up with me

1583
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:55,750
because I can't be in a relationship
with you and Elle anymore.

1584
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,125
It's just too much.

1585
01:36:00,541 --> 01:36:03,583
Rachel.

1586
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:07,083
I am grateful for family,

1587
01:36:09,875 --> 01:36:10,875
uh...

1588
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:12,333
my new friend,

1589
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:14,541
and...

1590
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,458
my motorcycle.

1591
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:22,666
Um, okay. Elle...

1592
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:24,833
Oh.

1593
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:26,708
Wow, what a tough act to follow.

1594
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:28,291
Let's see.

1595
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:30,791
I'm thankful for my family,

1596
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,375
for that I just, you know,
won some money for school,

1597
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:36,791
and... oh, yeah, oh, my God,

1598
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,750
I am super-duper thankful

1599
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:41,791
that, um, that I found Chloe's earring.

1600
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:44,958
Oh, my God. Where did you find it?

1601
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:50,250
Under Noah's bed.

1602
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:57,833
But what I'm most thankful for is
that I found the earring...

1603
01:36:59,666 --> 01:37:03,875
before I did anything crazy,
like rearrange my whole life for someone.

1604
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:13,000
You know, it kind of looked to me
like you'd already rearranged your life.

1605
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:19,916
I think that maybe we should just...

1606
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,291
You know what? This has been lovely.
Chloe, always a pleasure,

1607
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:25,458
but I think it's time
for me to head out too. So...

1608
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:27,875
Elle.

1609
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:31,458
Where are you going?

1610
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:36,458
To fix something
that's actually worth saving.

1611
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:50,333
And with Noah gone,
I was just... lonely, you know?

1612
01:37:50,416 --> 01:37:53,333
- I didn't realize that I was even...
- Cock-blocking?

1613
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:59,250
Not sure if I would have phrased it
like that, but, yeah, I guess.

1614
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:04,416
The idea that I had something to do
with you guys breaking up,

1615
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,750
- I feel so...
- No. Lee did this.

1616
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:11,291
And he'd do it again
because that's how much you mean to him.

1617
01:38:11,375 --> 01:38:13,500
Rachel, he loves you so much.

1618
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:15,041
And now that I know the problem,

1619
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:16,725
- I can absolutely fix...
- Elle!

1620
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:20,625
It's rule number 16.

1621
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:25,125
You know?

1622
01:38:26,791 --> 01:38:30,000
<i>Rule number 16: When
your bestie needs you there,</i>

1623
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,541
<i>you need to be there for your bestie.</i>

1624
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,226
You know what I can't figure out though?

1625
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:38,500
How did your earring get under my bed
in the first place?

1626
01:38:39,916 --> 01:38:41,708
Okay, about that...

1627
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,041
Um, don't get pissy,

1628
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:48,208
but when you were out of town
for a football game, I...

1629
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:51,916
sort of crashed at your place
after getting into a fight with Jason

1630
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,541
and the earring must have
just fallen off then.

1631
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,250
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1632
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:57,973
- That's just...
- I said <i>don't </i>get pissy.

1633
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:01,000
Now that we know what's happened,
we can fix this.

1634
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:03,958
Yeah, I'm not sure if I wanna fix it.

1635
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:08,833
You know,
I can't stop thinking about that kiss.

1636
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:12,875
I can't believe that she thought
that I'd actually cheat on her, you know?

1637
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:16,094
That's the reason I was lying
about us hanging out in the first place.

1638
01:39:16,125 --> 01:39:18,250
I was trying to avoid
this whole situation.

1639
01:39:18,791 --> 01:39:19,833
Listen to me.

1640
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:23,333
Just to give you things
from Elle's point of view,

1641
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:27,458
you used to have
quite the reputation, right?

1642
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:32,250
And Elle has no idea that I am one
of the few women on the planet

1643
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:35,708
immune to the charms of Noah Flynn.

1644
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:40,083
And then she finds my earring,
which couldn't have been very helpful

1645
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:41,875
to a woman who's missing her guy

1646
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,250
all the way on the other side
of the country.

1647
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:49,026
I don't like it when you're right.

1648
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,833
Well, I do sleep where I'm not supposed to
from time to time,

1649
01:39:52,916 --> 01:39:54,291
but overall,

1650
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:57,726
I'm a very talented individual.

1651
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:03,041

<i>I think I know where Lee is.</i>

1654
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:11,958
- Can I help you before I go? Just...
- No, no, no.

1655
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:13,250
I'll take care of this mess.

1656
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:15,333
You go take care of yours.

1657
01:40:16,041 --> 01:40:19,291
But, Elle, before you go,
I just want to say this afternoon,

1658
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:22,250
I noticed the three of you doing
a lot of talking

1659
01:40:22,666 --> 01:40:24,458
and maybe not as much listening.

1660
01:40:25,083 --> 01:40:26,708
I just want to tell you make sure

1661
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:29,458
that you really listen
to what the other person has to say.

1662
01:40:30,041 --> 01:40:31,833
Just hear them out, okay?

1663
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:33,916
Okay.

1664
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Okay.

1665
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:37,208
Oh! I almost forgot.

1666
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:40,958
There's a thing I wanna take with me.

1667
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:50,041

1670
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:56,583
<i>Rule number 19.</i>

1671
01:40:57,083 --> 01:40:59,291
You should have told me
about applying to Harvard.

1672
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:00,375
I know.

1673
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:04,226
- I'm sorry.
- I thought you wanted to go to Berkeley.

1674
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,458
I do.

1675
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:07,416
It's just...

1676
01:41:07,541 --> 01:41:11,791
Like, being away from Noah was so much
harder than I thought it was gonna be.

1677
01:41:13,541 --> 01:41:16,083
And you should have told me
about how Rachel was feeling.

1678
01:41:17,708 --> 01:41:19,583
I was going to, but I just...

1679
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:22,000
saw how lonely you were when Noah left.

1680
01:41:22,083 --> 01:41:23,958
You know that I would have understood.

1681
01:41:26,125 --> 01:41:29,958
Well, I guess the real reason
I didn't tell you was...

1682
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:33,500
because I didn't want to.

1683
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:36,625
I just always want you around.

1684
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:40,666
- Lee.
- But then I couldn't say no to Rachel,

1685
01:41:41,125 --> 01:41:44,375
pretended to hurt myself so that you'd be
busy practicing with Marco,

1686
01:41:44,458 --> 01:41:46,750
and then I would have time to hang out
with Rachel.

1687
01:41:46,833 --> 01:41:47,833
Just... God!

1688
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:50,791
Now you know how I felt last year.

1689
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:53,375
I didn't want to choose either,

1690
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,166
but I had to make a choice.

1691
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,333
Hey, one more thing.

1692
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:05,791
Rule number 5.

1693
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:09,000
You did not bring it with you.

1694
01:42:09,083 --> 01:42:11,958
Of course I did. Come on.

1695
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:13,125
What am I, a rookie?

1696
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:14,458
<i>RULE NUMBER 5:</i>

1697
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:17,500
<i>Always do the Thanksgiving wishbone

1698
01:42:17,583 --> 01:42:18,583
Okay.

1699
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:24,500
Here's wishing
that Rachel will give me a second chance.

1700
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:30,416
So much for that.

1701
01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:38,833
All right, I'm giving us 48 hours
to feel sorry for ourselves.

1702
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:43,041
Then we have Homecoming
and a kissing booth to do.

1703
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:08,041

Don't be afraid of how you feel.

I know how being afraid can hold you back
from getting what you really want.

01:53:41,208 --> 01:53:43,083
Why do you think I joined the council?

You're right.

1839

When we kissed...

1841
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:02,833
there was something there.

1842
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:15,458
But you're not the one.

1843
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:20,958
I really didn't mean to hurt you.

that I'm lying to myself about.

01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:31,875
And that's why I have to go,
and I have to find him

01:54:31,958 --> 01:54:34,333
and find out what really happened.

1847

Noah!

1864
01:55:46,958 --> 01:55:49,125
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

1865
01:55:49,541 --> 01:55:51,291
- You look so much like my...
- Elle?

1866
01:55:52,083 --> 01:55:53,125
What are you doing here?

1867
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:56,041
Where's... where's Noah?

1868
01:55:56,125 --> 01:55:57,833
He left. He went looking for you.

1869
01:55:58,416 --> 01:55:59,875
Wait, what?

1870
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,500
Look, that earring was nothing.

1871
01:56:02,708 --> 01:56:06,208
You've got to believe me, there is nothing
going on between Noah and me.

1872
01:56:07,833 --> 01:56:10,500
Do you know why he brought me home
for Thanksgiving?

1873
01:56:11,708 --> 01:56:15,208
He just wanted me there
so that we could become friends.

1874
01:56:16,375 --> 01:56:17,458
Oh, God.

1875
01:56:18,666 --> 01:56:21,333
- I feel so stupid.
- So does he.

1876
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
But he is crazy about you.

1877
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:27,541
You must know that.

1878
01:56:29,333 --> 01:56:30,916
Is that him?

1879
01:56:31,333 --> 01:56:32,333
Yeah.

1880
01:56:33,791 --> 01:56:34,791
What did he say?

1881
01:56:37,791 --> 01:56:41,125
He's at the kissing booth.

1882
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:45,625
Well, what are you waiting for?

1883
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:48,333
Thank you, Chloe.

1884
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:52,500
Good luck.

1885
01:56:53,041 --> 01:56:55,208
<i>♪ I'll be running right after you ♪</i>

1886
01:56:55,291 --> 01:57:00,208
<i>♪ This thing is bigger than us
And I just can't get close enough ♪</i>

1887
01:57:00,291 --> 01:57:04,166
<i>♪ And I just can't get close enough
To you ♪</i>

1888
01:57:31,541 --> 01:57:32,916
Hey, I really need to talk to you.

1889
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,250
- You don't even have to say anything.
- No, Elle, please.

1890
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:38,291
I need to say this.

1891
01:57:39,125 --> 01:57:40,833
When I started this school year,

1892
01:57:41,791 --> 01:57:43,083
I was pretty lonely,

1893
01:57:43,416 --> 01:57:45,958
and I wasn't really doing so well
in my classes.

1894
01:57:46,416 --> 01:57:47,958
Why didn't you say anything?

1895
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:51,125
'Cause I was embarrassed.

1896
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:56,333
Then I met, uh, Chloe,

1897
01:57:57,166 --> 01:58:00,208
and she showed me around,
introduced me to her friends and...

1898
01:58:01,541 --> 01:58:02,541
And...

1899
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:07,000
I know we used to make fun of you and Lee
and your rules,

1900
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:09,375
but I see what you guys have.

1901
01:58:12,666 --> 01:58:17,250
I guess a part of me just kinda wanted
to have the same thing with her.

1902
01:58:17,875 --> 01:58:18,875
Noah.

1903
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:22,375
So then when you didn't believe
that her and I could just be friends,

1904
01:58:23,333 --> 01:58:25,833
it reminded me of what you used to think
about me...

1905
01:58:28,041 --> 01:58:29,208
And I didn't like that.

1906
01:58:31,333 --> 01:58:32,333
That was...

1907
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:36,375
that was less about you and more just...

1908
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:40,416
I just compared myself to her.

1909
01:58:45,541 --> 01:58:48,458
And when you left, I just kind of figured
that we would end,

1910
01:58:48,916 --> 01:58:50,583
so when I found the earring,

1911
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:53,583
I made that the thing that would end it,
you know?

1912
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:55,958
I know,
I wanted to stop you feeling jealous,

1913
01:58:56,041 --> 01:58:58,208
so I stopped telling you things.

1914
01:58:58,833 --> 01:59:01,375
I was so scared
you were gonna get on that plane...

1915
01:59:02,833 --> 01:59:05,833
before I could tell you
that I really didn't want you to go.

1916
01:59:07,041 --> 01:59:09,333
I thought I was leaving because of Marco.

1917
01:59:11,625 --> 01:59:13,416
I don't care that you kissed him,

1918
01:59:16,625 --> 01:59:18,041
but I need you to tell me...

1919
01:59:21,791 --> 01:59:22,791
do you love him?

1920
01:59:31,208 --> 01:59:35,375
Please try to remember
what I'm about to say, okay?

1921
01:59:41,375 --> 01:59:42,500
It's you, Noah.

1922
01:59:47,041 --> 01:59:48,208
It's always been you.

1923
02:00:38,041 --> 02:00:40,875
<i>So, what do I want to be
in five years?</i>

1924
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:43,791
<i>Well, to be perfectly honest,</i>

1925
02:00:44,625 --> 02:00:46,750
<i>I haven't the slightest idea.</i>

1926
02:00:50,291 --> 02:00:53,791
<i>Most kids my age, whether they'd admit it
in a college essay or not,</i>

1927
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,000
<i>are still trying to figure that out.</i>

1928
02:00:56,833 --> 02:01:00,500
<i>And maybe it's because</i>
<i>it's less about </i>what <i>I want to be</i>

1929
02:01:00,583 --> 02:01:02,791
<i>and more about </i>who <i>I want to be.</i>

1930
02:01:05,333 --> 02:01:06,916
<i>Because I can tell you this:</i>

1931
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:12,541
<i>In five years,
I want to be my brother's joy.</i>

1932
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:15,666
<i>I want to be my dad's love...</i>

1933
02:01:16,166 --> 02:01:18,416
<i>And my mom's warmth.</i>

1934
02:01:19,333 --> 02:01:22,041
<i>In five years,
I want to be Rachel's kindness.</i>

1935
02:01:22,125 --> 02:01:23,291
I guess I'm next.

1936
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:28,083
<i>I want to be Noah's courage...</i>

1937
02:01:28,166 --> 02:01:30,416
I'm telling you that I love you.

1938
02:01:31,375 --> 02:01:32,708
<i>And his mom's wisdom.</i>

1939
02:01:33,708 --> 02:01:34,791
<i>But most of all...</i>

1940
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:41,250
<i>I wanna be my best friend's laughter.</i>

1941
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:45,625
<i>All those things together is
who I wanna be in five years.</i>

1942
02:01:45,958 --> 02:01:49,083
And so, on this auspicious day,

1943
02:01:49,166 --> 02:01:52,291
I leave you now with one final quote.

1944
02:01:52,958 --> 02:01:58,666
"I love to see a young girl go out
and grab the world by the lapels."

1945
02:02:00,333 --> 02:02:01,375
Life's a bitch.

1946
02:02:01,458 --> 02:02:05,875
"You have to go out and kick ass!"

1947
02:02:06,708 --> 02:02:07,708
Maya Angelou.

1948
02:02:12,833 --> 02:02:16,916
<i>All of those things is who I want
to be in five years.</i>

1949
02:02:18,125 --> 02:02:20,083
<i>And anything else beyond that,</i>

1950
02:02:20,375 --> 02:02:24,291
<i>well, I might have to wait until I get
where I'm going to figure that out.</i>

1951
02:02:34,541 --> 02:02:36,291
Oh, so have you heard from Berkeley yet?

1952
02:02:37,458 --> 02:02:39,750
- Yeah.
- And?

1953
02:02:40,583 --> 02:02:41,666
Um...

1954
02:02:43,625 --> 02:02:44,833
No, Lee first.

1955
02:02:46,083 --> 02:02:50,291
- I got in!
- Oh, my God!

1956
02:02:50,875 --> 02:02:52,791
I have no idea.

1957
02:02:52,875 --> 02:02:54,458
That's my boy! I knew you would!

1958
02:02:54,541 --> 02:02:56,416
- All right, bro.
- What's up?

1959
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,125
So? What about you?

1960
02:02:58,625 --> 02:02:59,875
Um...

1961
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:01,541
I, uh...

1962
02:03:03,041 --> 02:03:04,041
I...

1963
02:03:04,083 --> 02:03:07,083
I got wait-listed. Everywhere.

1964
02:03:08,125 --> 02:03:09,125
Berkeley

1965
02:03:09,791 --> 02:03:10,875
and Harvard.

1966
02:03:12,041 --> 02:03:13,125
I'm sorry, Rochelle.

1967
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:14,833
Thanks, babe.

1968
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:24,416
- Come on, bro. She's not worth it.
- I'm sure one of them will pan out.

1969
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,583
No, I know. You're right.

1970
02:03:27,041 --> 02:03:28,041
See you later.

1971
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:31,416
- Don't worry.
- Yeah.

1972
02:03:32,916 --> 02:03:33,916
Yes, she is.

1973
02:03:35,333 --> 02:03:38,000
Ooh! Let's just forget
about that right now.

1974
02:03:38,083 --> 02:03:39,416
I wanna do something fun.

1975
02:03:40,541 --> 02:03:41,583

02:06:41,041 --> 02:06:42,291
Sorry, I up that line.

2020
02:06:42,375 --> 02:06:44,166
God, I love her voice.

2021
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:45,500
Sounds like sunshine.

2022
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:48,708
I can see right in your shirt.

2023
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:53,666
I'm sorry, by the way, for being an idiot,
getting my line wrong.

2024
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:55,750
Let's start again.

2025
02:06:55,833 --> 02:06:57,267
- Why not?
- Dude, I'm already...

2026
02:06:57,291 --> 02:06:59,458
doing your kissing booth.

2027
02:06:59,541 --> 02:07:01,541
Is there music?

2028
02:07:01,916 --> 02:07:04,458
Yeah, yeah. It's me.
I'm playing a slideshow.

2029
02:07:04,541 --> 02:07:08,166
Just gettin' in my emotions part of me,
everybody.

2030
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:11,500
My Aunt Rose was just hit by a bus.

2031
02:07:11,583 --> 02:07:12,416
No.

2032
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,416
On a gambling trip in Germany.

2033
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:18,958
I have you... have mercy. Have mercy! No!

2034
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:20,875
Come on, Dad. Like, what the...

2035
02:07:20,958 --> 02:07:24,291
God! You always do this
when I'm in school. Shit!

2036
02:07:26,333 --> 02:07:28,125
Okay, we'll take it from here?

2037
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:34,458
Are you speaking really slowly?

2038
02:07:38,625 --> 02:07:40,833
Hello, camera.

2039
02:07:41,291 --> 02:07:44,125
You guys sound amazing.
Lucky, Marco was available, huh?

2040
02:07:44,208 --> 02:07:46,750
Yeah, I was actually really surprised
when he called yesterday

2041
02:07:46,833 --> 02:07:49,083
to ask if he could play with us.

2042
02:07:52,916 --> 02:07:55,625
Yeah, it's literally falling off.
It's actually ridiculous.

2043
02:07:55,708 --> 02:07:57,375
Uh, Brad. It's time for a shower, bud.

2044
02:07:57,458 --> 02:08:00,000
But I showered two days ago.
And I'm about to do the ramp jump.

2045
02:08:00,083 --> 02:08:02,364
You have literally never made
that ramp jump in your life.

2046
02:08:02,833 --> 02:08:03,833
Hey!

2047
02:08:08,833 --> 02:08:11,333
It's the John Travolta.

2048
02:08:11,416 --> 02:08:13,500
No way...

2049
02:08:14,666 --> 02:08:17,333
she's gonna give you a second chance, bae.

2050
02:08:17,416 --> 02:08:18,291
Good luck.

2051
02:08:18,375 --> 02:08:22,208
But in freestyle... but in... oh, my God.

2052
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:25,875
- But in... freestyle.
- Freestyle.

2053
02:08:25,958 --> 02:08:27,291
Today's the difference.

2054
02:08:30,875 --> 02:08:32,875
Dude, that broke his right off.

2055
02:08:33,375 --> 02:08:35,208
Oh, my God. It literally worked.

2056
02:08:35,291 --> 02:08:37,601
- Hello, there. Uh, I'm Lee Flynn.
- And I'm Elle Evans.

2057
02:08:37,625 --> 02:08:40,541
- We are your hosts of...
<i>- Game On!</i>

2058
02:08:43,833 --> 02:08:46,416
I called that shit.

2059
02:08:50,208 --> 02:08:52,625
This is stupid.

2060
02:08:52,708 --> 02:08:53,916
Everything is stupid.

2061
02:08:55,458 --> 02:08:58,833
Yearbook!

2062
02:08:59,375 --> 02:09:01,833
I'm sorry. I'd like to take that again,

2063
02:09:01,916 --> 02:09:03,500
'cause I smacked an extra.

2064
02:09:03,583 --> 02:09:05,351
So when will Marco be getting here?

2065
02:09:05,375 --> 02:09:08,041
Marco's actually not working
with us anymore.

2066
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:11,958
Babes, that was not...
It's on your head now. What's she done?

2067
02:09:12,041 --> 02:09:14,208
It's my line. I'm sorry.

2068
02:09:14,333 --> 02:09:17,333
- He's, like, the most cool person ever.
- Wouldn't marry me.

2069
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,333
I thought we were... shit!

2070
02:09:22,416 --> 02:09:25,458
Hey, how come I never wear sunglasses
to school?

2071
02:09:25,541 --> 02:09:27,750
I don't know.
'Cause we drive a convertible.
