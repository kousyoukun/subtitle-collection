- Good evening, Vercheres.
- Sh!

6
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,316
Oh, good evening, Inspector. You have
missed half of the opera, as usual.

7
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,517
- I didn't come to see the opera.
- As usual.

- Christine.

10
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,233
I just got back from Rouen.
No, I must talk to you for a moment.

11
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,309
But I...

12
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,318
Raoul, I shouldn't have left.

13
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,119
Christine, dear,
I hurried over to tell you something.

14
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,031
- What?
- That I love you.

15
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,997
- Again?
- Still.

16
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,273
- What a wonderful audience tonight.
- And you were marvellous, Biancarolli.

17
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,511
We're having supper tonight
at the Café de L'Opéra.

18
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,672
- I'm sorry, Raoul, but I can't tonight.
- Why not?

19
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,990
Chris? Christine!

20
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,356
- I'm coming, Jenny.
- If you've another engagement, break it.

21
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,716
You've had your fling at this for two years.

22
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,998
But I don't want to give up the opera,
not until I've had a chance to really sing.

23
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,436
Anatole says he has great faith in
my voice, and he's going to help me.

24
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,592
Naturally. That's what baritones are for(!)

25
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,839
- You were in wonderful voice tonight.
- Thank you, Marcel.

26
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,196
Christine! Why weren't you on
the stage for the end of the act?

27
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,872
- You're all right?
- Oh, yes.

28
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,713
Mademoiselle DuBois, come here please.

29
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,031
Don't worry.

30
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,915
Why weren't you onstage
for the curtain calls?

31
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
- Well, erm, I was ill...
- No, you were not.

32
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,518
You were entertaining a friend.
A friend, mind you!

33
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,956
For a singer to absent herself
from the stage during a performance

34
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,429
is a gross breach of...

35
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,751
- Oh. You wish to talk to me, monsieur?
- With your permission,

36
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,594
I'd like a few words with MIle DuBois
in my office after the performance.

37
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,910
- Yes, she will be there.
- Thank you.

38
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,993
- Now, you bear in mind what I told you.
- Yes, monsieur.

39
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,709
Terrifying fellow, that Vercheres,
when he wants to be.

40
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,759
I'm very grateful, monsieur. I promise you
I'll never miss a curtain call again.

41
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,274
It's a promise. Now, uh,

42
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,592
this young man who is more important
to you than your career... Who is he?

43
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,117
But he isn't, monsieur. That is,
I am very fond of him. I mean...

44
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,110
Oh.

45
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,192
Well, he's Inspector
Raoul Daubert of the Sûreté.

46
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,589
Inspector? You mean a policeman?

47
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,270
Oh, but he's not an ordinary policeman.

48
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,831
Even an extraordinary policeman seems
a strange sweetheart for a soprano.

49
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,309
Does he sing?

50
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,550
I'm afraid you don't
understand, monsieur.

51
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,518
He's a graduate of
the military academy at Saint-Cyr,

52
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,433
and he's very intelligent and very clever.

53
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,069
For a man who means nothing to you, he
seems to have made quite an impression.

54
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,755
Oh, but I didn't say he meant
nothing to me. What I said was...

55
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,593
I know. I know what you mean.

56
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,358
You have promise, Mademoiselle DuBois,
but you must choose

57
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,355
between an operatic career
and what is usually called "a normal life".

58
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,557
Though why it is so-called is beyond me.

59
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,995
You can't do justice to both.

60
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,799
The artist has a special temperament,

61
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,510
and he must live his life exclusively
with those who understand it.

62
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,591
I understand, monsieur.

63
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,959
You'll find that music has its
compensations, my dear. Good night.

64
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,235
Good night, and thank you.

65
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,194
Oh, mademoiselle, please tell Mr Claudin
to come in. He's in the anteroom.

66
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,475
Certainly. Good night.

67
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,275
Good evening. Monsieur Villeneuve
asks that you come in now.

68
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,237
Thank you, mademoiselle.

69
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,709
Mademoiselle,
may I speak to you for a minute?

70
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,711
Certainly.

71
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,109
You weren't on the stage tonight
for the third-act curtain calls.

72
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,432
Everyone in the theatre seems to have
noticed it. It's really quite flattering.

73
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,034
Why weren't you there?

74
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,430
Oh, forgive me, but I've
been here so long that you...

75
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,514
Everybody, everything connected with
the Opera is so much a part of my life.

76
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,876
Of course... But Mr Villeneuve is waiting.

77
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,831
Yes.

78
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,833
You weren't ill, were you?
You're not in any trouble?

79
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,798
It's impertinent of me, I know, but, uh...

80
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,355
You're very kind.

81
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,199
Good night.

82
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,710
Uh, Christine!

83
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,190
I'm sorry.

84
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,273
I'm sorry.

85
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,872
Good night.

86
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,711
Good night.

87
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,590
- <i>(knocking)</i>
- <i>(Villeneuve)</i> Come in, please.

88
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,118
You know why I sent for you, Claudin?

89
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,918
I think so, Maestro.

90
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,437
For some time now I have sensed
discord in the violin section.

91
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,435
It was not until tonight that I definitely
located the source of the trouble.

92
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,557
Let me hear you play,
if you please, Claudin.

93
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,551
Yes, Maestro.

94
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,631
<i>(# mournful tune)</i>

95
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,876
- What was that, Claudin?
- A little song.

96
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,589
A lullaby, from Provence,
where I was born.

97
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,514
You played it very well.
Perhaps I was wrong.

98
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,429
No, it <i>was</i> you.

99
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,557
What's the matter?
You're an accomplished musician.

100
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,039
Come, come, now.

101
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,238
Let me hear you play the opening
movement in the third act of <i>Martha. </i>

102
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,348
It's no use, Maestro. Something has
happened to the fingers of my left hand.

103
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,197
- But you played that lullaby perfectly.
- It's a simple melody, Maestro.

104
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,316
That's why I played it.

105
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,391
You were trying to fool me, eh, Claudin?

106
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,632
Well, perhaps it's only temporary.
Perhaps it'll get better.

107
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,075
I hope so, but in the meantime...

108
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,472
You know, Claudin,
the aim of the Paris Opera is perfection.

109
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,719
I'm sorry, old fellow, very sorry. You've
been with us a long time, haven't you?

110
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,711
20 years.

111
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,355
What am I to do, Maestro?

112
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,713
I know it's hard, Claudin.

113
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,199
No doubt you've saved
a tidy little fortune to retire on.

114
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,113
- Yes, of course.
- In appreciation of your long service,

115
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,399
I shall arrange with the directors
to have a season ticket issued to you.

116
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,675
Thank you, Maestro.

117
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,714
<i>(knock at door)</i>

118
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,711
<i>(door opens)</i>

119
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,429
Why don't you eat before the opera,
instead of keeping me up all hours?

120
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,717
You're rich enough. Same soup,
night after night, week after week.

121
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,315
- Please don't disturb yourself, Marie.
- You're a fine one to say that!

122
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,198
Why wouldn't I be disturbed?
I'll come right to the point.

123
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,430
What you do with your money
is not my business.

124
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,909
If you want to hoard it
and starve, it's your affair.

125
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,549
But you haven't paid me for six weeks,
and that's as long as I'm going to wait.

126
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,871
I haven't any money.
If you'll be patient, just a little longer...

127
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,714
You haven't any money? After working
for the Paris Opera all these years?

128
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,314
What will you do with your money?
Bury it with you?

129
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,550
If you do, they'll dig you up and steal it.

130
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,757
If you think you can add a few francs
to your fortune at my expense,

131
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,876
you're very much mistaken.

132
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,034
Marie, you've been very kind, you've been
very patient. You'll be paid, I promise you.

133
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,111
Now please leave me alone.

134
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,638
It makes me sick to think of all
that money doing nobody any good.

135
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,790
Either I get my money or out you go.
That's my last word, Claudin.

136
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,831
<i>(# sings ascending scale)</i>

137
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,631
<i>(bell tinkles)</i>

138
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,554
You're late, Mr Claudin.
The lesson is almost over.

139
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,677
I didn't come about that today,
mademoiselle.

140
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,274
- She's not in voice.
- I'll tell Signor Ferretti.

141
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,239
- Please don't interrupt the lesson.
- Of course not. I understand.

142
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,916
But I must announce the time to Signor
Ferretti, or he'll keep students for hours.

143
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,391
- It's 11 o'clock, Signor Ferretti.
- Thank you.

144
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,750
Mademoiselle, you disappoint me.

145
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,513
I'm sorry. I'm a little upset.

146
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,956
If a man is upsetting you,
pitch him out of your life. Music is first.

147
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,270
- Music is everything.
- I understand.

148
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,638
You don't understand. Women
never understand. But they are docile.

149
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,599
Perhaps you're not getting enough sleep.
Come later tomorrow, say midday.

150
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,591
Thank you, monsieur.

151
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,392
Remember you have responsibilities
to others as well as yourself.

152
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,232
I know.

153
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,278
I can never repay you
for what you've done for me.

154
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,635
- Good day, monsieur.
- Good day.

155
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,435
Would you come this way, monsieur?

156
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,278
Monsieur Claudin is here, Signor Ferretti.

157
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,396
Come in, Claudin, come in.

158
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,358
- Won't you sit down a moment?
- Thank you.

159
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,310
I suppose you noticed
your protégée was disappointing today?

160
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,029
Well, an off day now and then.
You've done a lot for her, Signor.

161
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,476
Nevertheless, she is making
definite progress, eh?

162
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,199
I was dismissed from
the orchestra last night.

163
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,034
Oh. Then you will have to withdraw
your support for Mademoiselle DuBois?

164
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,396
Only for a little while, just until
I can secure another position.

165
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,199
I had hoped that you would
continue to instruct her.

166
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,319
Claudin, if you don't mind me
saying so, you are a fool.

167
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,119
A man of your age might win
a girl like Christine DuBois

168
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,671
if he happened to be the director of
an opera company, but a poor violinist...

169
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,069
We agreed never to discuss my motives.

170
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,152
Please, won't you continue
to work with her?

171
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,028
Why should I assume your burden,
after you spent all your money on her?

172
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,394
She means nothing to me.

173
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,916
But her career means
more to me than anything else.

174
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,639
I would never let you lose
anything on her account.

175
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,951
I'm sorry, Claudin, really sorry.
If I had time... But my expenses are great.

176
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,510
And you must remember there are many
who can pay waiting to study with me.

177
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,390
I'll let her come a few times, and then
I will tell her she no longer needs me.

178
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,711
But that isn't true.

179
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,839
As a matter of fact, if you had the money,
she might be launched on a career soon.

180
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,516
I assume that MIle DuBois has not the
means to pay for her own instructions?

181
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,797
A month's salary wouldn't be enough
to pay for one of your lessons.

182
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,111
But... I have written a concerto.

183
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,272
Will you trust me if I can
arrange to have it published?

184
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,672
Every violinist has written a concerto!
Come, come, my dear Claudin.

185
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,352
But I have faith in this one,

186
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,591
as much faith as I had in MIle DuBois
when I came three years ago.

187
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,990
Now, I was right about her,
Signor, and I'm right about this.

188
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,991
Pleyel and Desjardins will publish it,

189
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,073
and they'll give me
a substantial advance. You'll see!

190
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,590
<i>(man)</i> It's a shame.
Pleyel's in there with his etchings.

191
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,552
Why don't they tell the poor devil he won't
see anyone, instead of torturing him?

192
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,958
Claudin?

193
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,514
He'll see me?

194
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,670
No. He is too busy today.

195
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,877
- Has he seen my manuscript?
- Manuscript? What manuscript?

196
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,996
- My concerto.
- I know nothing about it.

197
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,029
- But you took the portfolio into him.
- If I did, you will receive it in due time.

198
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,596
Now, my dear, the acid. Be careful,
or you'll burn yourself horribly.

199
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,678
- Monsieur Pleyel?
- What are <i>you</i> doing here?

200
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,548
- I've been waiting since this morning.
- Weren't you told I couldn't see anyone?

201
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,315
Yes, but my manuscript.
I must find out about my manuscript.

202
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,914
Give this fellow
his manuscript, Georgette.

203
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,719
You'll find it on the desk, if it's anywhere.

204
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,429
- What is your name?
- Uh, Claudin. Erique Claudin.

205
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,351
Claudin...

206
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,116
No, it wouldn't be there. It's a large
manuscript in a portfolio. It's a concerto.

207
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,351
- I'm sorry, but I don't know where it is.
- But it must be here.

208
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,591
Well, if it is, it will turn up.
You might call again in a few days.

209
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,229
You don't understand. It's my only copy.
It represents two years' work.

210
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,914
- You heard what the lady said.
- But it was brought in.

211
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,672
It must be here. It must be found.

212
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,115
Did we ask you to bring
your music to us, Claudin?

213
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,237
I've seen samples of
your compositions before.

214
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,518
Perhaps some employee has thrown it
into the wastebasket, where it belongs.

215
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,511
Good night!

216
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,511
<i>(# piano playing)</i>

217
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,272

- It's magnificent. Tell me his name again.

218
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,032
- Erique Claudin.
- Claudin?

219
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,112
I've tried for years to persuade
Pleyel to publish his work,

220
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,350
but you know
Pleyel and unknown composers.

221
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,318
Pleyel will publish this, I promise.

You've stolen my music.

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,517
- Stop him!
- What's happened?

233
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,878
Monsieur Pleyel's been murdered by that
madman, Claudin! Get a doctor, quickly!

You, get a doctor. Call the police!

Get a doctor! Call the police!

Police! Police!

237
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,273
- What happened?
- Monsieur Pleyel has been murdered!

238
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,238
- He ran down that way.
- Come on, let's go!

239
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,111
Not here.

240
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,075
Sorry, monsieur.

241
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,758
Move on, and don't come back
into this district tonight.

242
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,952
<i>(howls)</i>

243
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,070
Lecours, how were we ever induced
to accept the management of this place?

244
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,197
It's not an opera house. It's a madhouse.

245
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,068
And now this:
"Wanted for murder: Erique Claudin,

246
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,310
former violinist at Paris Opera House."

247
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,756
"Age 48 years, height 5ft 8in."

248
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,832
"The face has recently
been disfigured by acid."

249
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,514
It's an outrage.
After 20 years with the Paris Opera,

250
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,433
this miserable Claudin has
the insolence to commit a murder.

251
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,829
After 20 years with the Paris Opera,

252
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,275
- A man is capable of anything, Amiot.
- <i>(knock on door)</i>

253
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,874
Come in, come in, come in!

254
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,838
Monsieur, there is a thief
in the opera house.

255
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,388
A costume has been stolen,
and two masks.

256
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,199
Impossible. The wardrobe
woman must have lost them.

257
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,794
- She should have been dismissed.
- She's too fat.

258
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,111
That's not all. The thief has
broken into the restaurant.

259
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,830
- The restaurant?
- Yes, monsieur. There is missing a...

260
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,119
There is missing a bucket of pickled
pigs' feet in vinegar, a ham and a pâté.

261
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,668
Call the police. This must be stopped.

262
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,069
Monsieur, I am afraid
the police can't stop that. It's he.

263
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,752
Who?

264
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,078
Oh, please don't start that
nonsense again, Vercheres.

265
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,276
You ought to know
there aren't any ghosts.

266
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,672
Monsieur, you are sceptical, but
I don't like ghosts. I am a busy man.

267
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,113
What's that?

268
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,637
Our brilliant stage manager insists
there's a malicious ghost prowling about.

269
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,280
If anything goes wrong,
he thinks this ghost did it.

270
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,555
Oh, monsieur...

271
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,233
- It has a long nose and a big, red beard.
- You make me nervous.

272
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,470
It's gone!

273
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,518
Did you hear that, Lecours?
My master key is gone.

274
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,718
Do you realise what that means, Lecours?

275
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,554
With that key in his possession,
the thief can open 2500 doors,

276
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,393
to say nothing of thousands
of closets and cabinets.

277
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,914
Perhaps the pickled pigs' feet will kill him.

278
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,516
Oh, you don't seem to understand.
Why, he can hide everywhere.

279
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,830
The entire police force couldn't find him.

280
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,708
You don't realise the extent of this place.
You've never troubled to find out.

281
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,030
Why should I? I have troubles enough.

282
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,749
- What are you waiting for? Get the police!
- Yes, monsieur.

283
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,958
A pâté, a ham, pickled pigs' feet
and 2500 rooms!

303
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,270
- Monsieur Daubert.
- Madame.

304
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,670
They call this rehearsing, monsieur.

305
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,593
Well, I'm sorry to intrude,
but I must see you, Christine.

306
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,638
- Well, you see I'm busy right now...
- Christine!

307
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,154
Please remember that you
are speaking to a gentleman.

308
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,031
Well, uh...

309
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,509
- Come in, Raoul.
- Rehearsals!

310
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,519
Anatole... Well, he's been helping me.

311
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,910
- Monsieur's very kind.
- Not at all, monsieur. I find it a pleasure.

312
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,719
- I'm Anatole Garron of the Opera.
- I'm so sorry.

313
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,473
This is Inspector Daubert,
of the Sûreté.

314
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,632
I've heard of you, Inspector.
Your work must be very exciting.

315
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,158
Oh, not so exciting as yours, monsieur.
It doesn't lend itself to self-expression.

316
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,037
I didn't recognise that
delightful song you were singing.

317
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,793
But as you know,
I am no connoisseur of the opera.

318
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,316
It's not from an opera, Raoul. It's a lullaby.

319
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,152
A lullaby?

320
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,436
It didn't seem very effective, as a lullaby.

321
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,593
Well, you see, Monsieur Inspector,
a song is capable of many interpretations,

322
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,911
- By a musician.
- By a detective, too.

323
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,276
Though no doubt
the detective is usually mistaken.

324
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,555
I must see you alone, Christine.
I'm here on business from the Sûreté.

325
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,629
With me?

326
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,554
What business could mademoiselle
have with the Sûreté?

327
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,749
What is it, Raoul?

328
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,752
If you don't mind,
I'd rather Anatole stayed.

329
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,035
Very well, Christine.

330
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,918
- You know Erique Claudin?
- Why, yes.

331
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,433
How well?

332
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,876
I knew him only as
a violinist in the orchestra.

333
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,076
I encountered him a few times in the foyer

334
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,550
or on the stage or outside
the Opera, but that's all.

335
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,077
He acted a little strangely, but I assumed
he was that way with everybody.

336
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,310
- Strangely?
How do you mean, "strangely"?

337
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,834
Well... I don't know.

338
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,990
He just seemed... eccentric, but harmless.

339
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,033
I thought he was a rather kind old fellow,
until I read of the murder.

340
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,636
- What is it, Raoul?
- He was a kind and inoffensive man.

341
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,079
Until he thought Pleyel
was stealing his life's work.

342
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,197
Then something snapped,
and he became a homicidal maniac.

343
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,350
In his state, he may
commit other murders.

344
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,989
It's urgent that we capture him
as soon as possible.

345
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,830
But what has all this to do with me?

346
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,516
We found something in his room
that connects you with him.

347
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,511
No doubt you can explain.

348
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,195
So that's what became of it!

349
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,034
- Be good enough to explain yourself.
- Certainly. That statuette is mine.

350
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,429
- Yours?
- Definitely. I made it.

351
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,513
- I intended to make you a present of it.
- How nice of you, Anatole.

352
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,875
It disappeared from my dressing room.

353
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,679
It's an extraordinary likeness.

354
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,752
My compliments on
your versatility, monsieur.

355
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,111
You must have posed for this
many times. Every detail is you.

356
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,191
I never posed for it, not once.

357
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,634
- You did this from drawings?
- And from memory, Monsieur Inspector.

358
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,998
To see Christine is to carry her image
in your heart and mind for ever.

359
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,799
- Claudin must have stolen it.
- Why?

360
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,557
Isn't it obvious?

361
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,110
Well, speaking purely as
an inspector of the Sûreté,

362
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,794
even the obvious
often needs confirmation.

363
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,394
But as a man, Mr Daubert,
you can understand

364
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,632
that sitting there in the orchestra pit
night after night and looking at Christine,

365
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,598
Claudin probably fell in love with her.

366
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,949
You admit that <i>is</i> possible, no?

367
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,792
Christine, did Claudin ever seek more
than a casual acquaintance with you?

368
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,518
No, never.

369
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:56,072
Can you imagine so diffident a lover,
monsieur? Claudin was barely 50.

370
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,720
Well, no doubt he lacked... assurance.

371
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,636
No doubt.

372
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,553
- This is yours, Christine.
- You're giving it to me?

373
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,074
- Yes.
- Well!

374
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,550
Then I'll accept it
as a gift from both of you.

375
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,108
Well, I seem to have got
the worst of this bargain.

376
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,159
In the future, Monsieur Inspector,
I detect, you model.

377
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,711
- In any case, that was a bad clue.
- Oh, not so bad as it seems.

378
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,360
It enabled me to recover
mademoiselle's statuette.

379
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,351
Thank you, Raoul.

380
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,510
Is that your carriage
at the door, monsieur?

381
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,919
Why, yes.

382
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,878
Would you be good enough
to give me a lift?

383
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,110
- Where are you going?
- It doesn't matter.

384
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,715
As inspector of police,
I have business all over Paris.

385
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,870
Yes, well, in that case...

00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,237
I assure you, monsieur. The property man
swears that there was no opportunity

452
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,437
for any <i>human</i> being
to tamper with the drink.

453
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,432
Monsieur Inspector,
what are you waiting for?

454
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,432
I demand the arrest of Anatole Garron.
You know he did it.

455
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,593
I know nothing of the sort, madame.
I am a police officer, not a psychic.

456
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,274
It is my duty to collect evidence,
without prejudice.

457
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,635
Haven't you evidence enough?
Everyone knows...

458
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,073
Madame!

459
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,230
Will you be seated, please?

460
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,796
Mr Garron, you had the opportunity to put
the drug in Madame Biancarolli's glass.

461
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,669
Certainly, Monsieur Inspector.

462
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,919
We all did.

463
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,118
- It becomes, then, a question of motive.
- The motive is very simple, monsieur.

464
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,397
He wanted to get me out of the way
so he could make room for that...

465
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,074
- Are you referring to MIle DuBois?
- I am.

466
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,912
You heard, Monsieur Garron.

467
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,632
Madame is in good voice...
and most explicit.

468
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,350
Have you anything to say, monsieur?

469
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,237
I deny madame's accusation.

470
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,195
Do you deny, monsieur, that you had
any motive in drugging madame?

471
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,475
I deny that I drugged her.

472
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,870
I don't understand your reluctance
to make the arrest, Inspector.

473
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,872
- You're not an examining magistrate.
- Can you substantiate

474
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,191
that Mr Garron had a motive,
and that the motive was MIle DuBois?

475
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,955
- Anyone with half an eye could tell you...
- Hearsay is not evidence, madame.

476
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,591
I'll go over your head, Monsieur Daubert.
I have influence at the Sûreté.

477
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,955
I was drugged tonight
to the point of death.

478
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,952
I insist upon the arrest of
the criminal and his accomplice.

479
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,157
- And if you don't, I...
- One moment, madame, please.

480
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,629
You have heard Mr Garron
deny that he drugged you.

481
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,154
As the inspector says,
there is no evidence.

482
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,312
- And remember, madame...
- Are you suggesting that I...

483
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,278
If you insist upon his arrest
and fail to obtain a conviction,

484
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,079
you will find yourself in
a very difficult predicament.

485
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,277
- Quite right.
- And no matter what the outcome,

486
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,909
don't forget that your career
is bound to the Paris Opera.

487
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,878
Whatever scandal injures us,
or any member of the company,

488
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,714
- Will injure you as well.
- <i>(Lecours)</i> Precisely.

489
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,519
Are you suggesting that
I forget the whole affair?

490
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,068
Yes. For your own sake, as well as ours,

491
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,072
and purely as a matter
of business expediency.

492
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,151
That is exactly what
we propose, madame.

493
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,151
<i>(Lecours)</i> Exactly.

494
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,348
Very well.

495
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,198
That is, under certain conditions.

496
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,196
I want a new understudy.

497
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,396
Christine DuBois goes back to the chorus

498
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,472
and stays there for the two years
my contract has to run.

499
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,439
I won't permit such an outrage!
If any such arrangement is made, I'II...

500
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,717
- Now, madame...
- My dear Anatole, I have not finished.

501
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,234
You suggest I forget
I was drugged tonight?

502
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,073
- Madame.
- Very well. I'll go a step further.

503
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,072
I suggest that you forget
anything happened afterwards.

504
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,755
- For once, madame, I do not understand.
- Oh, monsieur, it's so simple.

505
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:34,109
Nothing happened tonight. I wasn't
drugged and Christine DuBois didn't sing.

506
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,794
- But...
- There are always critics in the house.

507
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,111
You'll send word to the papers that
no mention of her is to be made.

508
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,112
You'll do nothing of the sort.
It's ridiculous.

509
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,077
Besides, what about the public, madame?

510
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,914
Shall we send word to the public to
forget that MIle DuBois was a sensation?

511
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,437
If you're willing to ruin the Opera for the
sake of Christine DuBois, it's your affair.

512
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,559
But you'll either do as I say, or I'll charge
both of them with trying to murder me.

513
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,790
Do you understand that? Murder me!

514
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,590
- Madame was magnificent tonight.
- I <i>was</i> good, wasn't I?

515
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,830
Monsieur Garron must be biting his nails.

516
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,595
Ah, let him. He'll come crawling
back to me on his hands and knees,

517
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,116
confessing the whole thing
and begging my forgiveness.

518
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,037
Madame!

519
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,194
Who are you?

520
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,238
Christine DuBois will sing tomorrow night.

521
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,198
Leave Paris. This is your last warning.

522
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,158
Take off that prop-room mask.

523
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,711
<i>(screaming)</i>

524
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,995
- What was that?
- I don't know.

525
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,556
- <i>(man)</i> Something must have happened.
- Silence, please.

526
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,279
- <i>(woman)</i> What happened?
- Sh! Monsieur?

527
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,873
Madame Biancarolli and her maid
have been murdered.

528
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,439
Murdered?!

529
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,357
- Are you hurt, monsieur?
- What happened? What were you doing?

530
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,998
- I was chasing him.
- Chasing whom?

531
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,957
The murderer, of course.

532
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,951
There was someone else up there?

533
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,510
Certainly. Everyone must have seen...
You saw him yourself, didn't you?

534
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,909
No, monsieur. I was chasing <i>you. </i>

535
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,634
How long will the Opera
remain closed, Inspector?

536
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,312
- Yes, how long?
- I do not know.

537
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,436
- Any suspects?
- Yes, whom do <i>you</i> suspect?

538
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,750
- No one.
- What is your theory on the motive?

539
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,753
I am not a theorist. All I can say is that as
long as the opera house remains closed,

540
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,638
everyone in Paris, in all France,
will think only of the murder,

541
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,631
hounding us to make an arrest.

542
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,355
Inspector Daubert.

543
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,512
I came directly I got your message.
What has happened now?

544
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,670
Listen to this, monsieur.

545
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,878
"Christine DuBois must replace
Biancarolli, who ignored my warning."

546
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,636
I found this mysteriously placed on
my desk after we got back from supper.

547
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,510
There is an excellent suggestion in this,
monsieur. You must reopen the Opera.

548
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,875
- But your orders...
- Are countermanded. Reopen.

549
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,192
- With MIle DuBois, monsieur?
- Of course! It should pacify this madman.

550
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,511
If he doesn't harm anybody, his
being in the building doesn't matter.

551
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,433
- Christine DuBois must not sing.
- What?

552
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,478
And the murderer must
not remain in the building.

553
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,233
- It is my duty to apprehend him.
- I don't understand.

554
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,393
If Christine DuBois sings, that will satisfy
the murderer, and he may never appear.

555
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,153
To lure him from his hiding place,
someone else must sing.

556
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,791
Are you suggesting we reopen the Opera
with a murder as an added attraction?

557
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,111
- Please, Lecours...
- I'll post police throughout the building.

558
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,192
Even with the chorus onstage,
with a bodyguard for the singer.

559
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,829
- But, monsieur, our reputation...
- I am reluctant to do this, monsieur.

560
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,196
Particularly on MIle DuBois' account,
but I can see no other way.

561
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,831
And whom do you suggest as "bait",
Monsieur Inspector?

562
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,672
Whomever you decide.

563
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,194
Madame Lorenzi.
She has nerve, that woman.

564
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,191
- Too much.
- Very well, then.

565
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,794
- The Opera <i>will</i> reopen.
- Yes, monsieur.

566
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,351
<i>(bell)</i>

567
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,355
- Oh.
- <i>(both)</i> Good morning, Christine.

568
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,590
- Good morning.
- <i>(both)</i> May I come in, Christine?

569
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,591
Yes, do.

570
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,117
- Well?
- <i>(both)</i> Christine, I...

571
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,316
- Yes?
- <i>(both)</i> If I might have a word...?

572
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,231
- Well, what is it?
- After you, monsieur.

573
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,949
- <i>(both)</i> Christine, I...
- Well, now, one at a time, please!

574
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,554
You first, Anatole,
as your name begins with an A.

575
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,359
They're going to reopen the Opera.
At last we will sing...

576
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,749
You are wrong, monsieur.
I'm sorry, Christine.

577
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,718
They <i>are</i> going to reopen the Opera,
but without you.

578
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,950
Circumstances
connected with the murder

579
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,429
demand that someone else
sing the leading role.

580
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,149
- But Anatole...
- You may like to know, monsieur,

581
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,710
that circumstances connected with
the murder demand that she <i>does</i> sing.

582
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,634
Really? I am aware that your profession
requires a certain self-assurance,

583
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,678
- But aren't you going too far?
- Not at all.

584
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,830
I have a plan for
apprehending the murderer.

585
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,354
- So you have turned detective, monsieur?
- I have.

586
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,512
Very well, if it amuses you,
but I advise you to confine your hobby

587
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,795
to the entertainment of your friends.

588
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,791
Well, let's not waste words, monsieur.

589
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,075
I've been assured by
Messrs Amiot and Lecours

590
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,596
that as soon as the Opera reopens,
MIle DuBois <i>will</i> sing.

591
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,229
And I might add that
my plan is strictly confidential.

592
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,595
I'm sorry, but in my official capacity

593
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,752
I ordered Messrs Amiot and Lecours
not to permit you to sing.

594
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,229
- But Raoul...
- At least, not for the present.

595
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,517
And I am not in the least
interested in your plan.

596
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,352
May I have a word with you alone?

597
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,749
That's what <i>I</i> came for.
May I speak to you alone?

598
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,230
- But... I'm going out.
- <i>(both)</i> My carriage is outside.

599
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,472
Well, I'm not going right now.
I mean... I'm going later.

600
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,513
<i>(both)</i> I'll wait.

601
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,797
Mr Villeneuve suggested you'd perform
this service in the cause of justice.

602
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:32,715
Do you think Claudin would be tempted
to leave his hiding place and risk his life

603
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,950
merely to hear his own concerto?

604
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,510
Played by Franz Liszt himself?
Do you doubt it, Maestro?

605
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,672
So many crimes have been
committed in the name of music.

606
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,309
It seems only fair
to use it now to avert one.

607
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,514
- I am at your service, monsieur.
- Thank you, Maestro. Thank you.

608
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,672
Most exciting, this detective work,
most exciting.

609
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,709
It's more than exciting to me. I had the
honour of being suspected of the crime.

610
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,315
Monsieur Daubert, please.

611
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,878
- Listen, monsieur.
- Another note.

612
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,952
How this phantom knows
everything is beyond me.

613
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:20,113
"If Madame Lorenzi sings,
you are responsible for what happens."

614
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,315
Our plan is working.

615
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,872
I don't like it, monsieur. What will become
of the Paris Opera? Police everywhere!

616
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,633
- How is Madame Lorenzi?
- Oh, she's enjoying it.

617
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,429
- Nothing would keep her from singing.
- Well, you know how opera singers are.

618
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,397
With your matron in her dressing room

619
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,076
and that fellow of yours waiting to escort
her to the stage, she feels quite important.

620
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,560
Madame Lorenzi,
I trust you are entirely composed?

621
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,437
Composed?

622
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,954
What are you talking about? Why not?

623
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,355
- Maestro!
- The piano has been tuned, Maestro.

624
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,671
- When do we introduce the concerto?
- Probably after the opera.

625
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,435
Inspector Daubert has a plan of his own,
and we must give it every chance.

626
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,512
You may enjoy seeing the opera
from the orchestra pit.

627
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,149
I'll be quite comfortable here.
I can look through the score.

628
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,630
- Excuse me. The overture.
- Thank you again, Maestro.

629
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,155
Remain onstage
throughout the performance.

630
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,518
Make yourselves inconspicuous, and
be on the alert for anything suspicious.

631
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,876
The only persons backstage are
the members of the opera company,

632
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,520
all of whom you know. Now, that is all.

633
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,511
<i>(# overture begins)</i>

634
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,469
Christine, I'd rather
you'd stayed at home.

635
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,120
You understand why
I asked them not to let you sing?

636
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,953
But I couldn't stay away.
We're introducing a new opera

637
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:16,511
- And Madame Lorenzi's a great artist...
- And Anatole Garron is the baritone!

638
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,388
I'm sorry, Christine, but I'm concerned
about what may happen tonight.

639
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,550
I know. I am too.

640
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,188
Wait for me, please,
in your dressing room.

641
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,471
<i>(# singing in Russian)</i>

642
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,671
Sorry.

643
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,037
He's here, Gerard. He murdered
one of our men and stole his cape.

644
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,839
He's probably wearing a mask.
Watch everyone closely.

645
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,115
Of course, monsieur.

646
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,837
Sorry.

647
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,751

What is it?

653
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,829
Come with me, mademoiselle.

654
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,316
Are you one of the police?

655
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,150
- Where is Inspector Daubert?
- Investigating the accident.

656
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,117
I will look after you.

657
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,994
- You're not one of the police.
- I'll watch over you.

658
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:43,358
- I've always watched over you. Come.
- <i>(screams)</i>

659
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,711
- <i>(screams)</i>
- Sh!

660
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,751
Shh.

661
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,749
You'll stay here with me,
my child, won't you?

662
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:09,470
It's been so Ionely without you, but
you've come to me at last, haven't you?

663
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:14,350
Now you'll sing for me, and I'll play,
and we'll be together for ever.

664
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,478
It's beautiful down there.

665
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,439
Beautiful.

666
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,272
Come now, my little one.

667
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,437
Christine!

668
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,434
- Where's Christine?
- I don't know. Isn't it horrible?

669
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,478
- Hasn't she been here?
- I haven't seen her.

670
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,838
There. You're not
frightened now, are you?

671
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,276
You know I'll not harm you, don't you?

672
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,717
How could I harm you?
I've always helped you, haven't I?

673
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,558
- Yes.
- Yes what?

674
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,279
Yes, you've always helped me.

675
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:22,276
Of course I have. Biancarolli knows.
She wouldn't let you sing.

676
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,239
She didn't know how much I love you.
Now she knows.

677
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,915
But it doesn't matter now. Nothing
matters except you and me, Christine.

678
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,879
Now you'll sing all you want...
but only for me.

679
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,997
You will, won't you, my darling?

680
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,231
Of course.
There's a piano in the Opera foyer.

681
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,709
Let's go there.
You play and I'll sing for you.

682
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:48,238
But you don't understand.
We can't go back there... ever.

683
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:53,075
It was I who made the chandelier fall.
l, for you, Christine.

684
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:58,029
But I warned them. I said there'd be death
and destruction if they didn't let you sing.

685
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,155
Come.

686
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,751
See? Didn't I tell you it was beautiful?

687
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,553
You didn't know we had a lake
all to ourselves, did you?

688
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,908
They've poisoned your mind against me.
That's why you're afraid.

689
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:40,117
Look at your lake, Christine. You'll love it
here, when you get used to the dark.

690
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,239
And you'll love the dark too.
It's friendly and peaceful.

691
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,551
It brings rest, and relief from pain.

692
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,872
It's right under the Opera. The music
comes down and the darkness distils it,

693
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,430
cleanses it of the suffering that made it,
then it's all beauty.

694
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,751
And life here is like a resurrection.

695
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,832
This is more than just
a performance of a new concerto.

696
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,195
The future of the Paris Opera
may depend upon it.

697
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,631
- Garron, have you seen Christine?
- No, she's at home.

698
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:13,669
She came to the opera house earlier
this evening. Now she's disappeared.

699
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,955
Play, Maestro. Play.

700
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,314
Christine? Christine!

701
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,472
Christine! Christine!

702
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,152
Christine!

703
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,396
George, you two search that passageway.
Gerard, go that way.

704
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,517
Be careful.
This madman may do anything now.

705
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,112
Christine!

706
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,951
Christine!

707
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,273
<i>(# Claudin's concerto begins)</i>

708

<i>(# plays along with concerto)</i>

710
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,470
Liszt is playing.

711
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:51,031
That was a brilliant idea of yours, Garron.
Claudin may be up there now, listening.

712
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,753
That sounds in front of us.

713
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,831
It <i>is</i> in front of us.

714
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,513
The whole place is ready to crumble.

715
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,192
Sing, Christine.

716
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,395
Sing!

717
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,517
Don't move.

718
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,510
- The whole place is caving in.
- The shots must have started it.

719
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:36,074
He called that <i>his</i> concerto, and yet it's
written around the melody of my song.

720
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:40,312
- Who was he?
- He came from your district, in Provence.

721
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,153
Everybody there must have
known that old folk song.

722
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:50,112
He was almost a stranger to me, and yet...
somehow I always felt drawn to him

723
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,749
with a kind of pity, understanding.

724
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,478
His suffering and madness
will be forgotten.

725
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:02,597
His music, his concerto, will remain.

726
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,790
I'm glad he heard it, before he...

727
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,191
Poor Claudin.

728
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,032
Oh, mademoiselle,
you were magnificent tonight!

729
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,395
Thank you, Celeste. I was good, wasn't I?

730
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,550
Oh, wonderful!

731
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,676
- <i>(knock on door)</i>
- Celeste!

732
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,231
Monsieur.

733
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,550
You were magnificent, Christine!

734
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,552
- Incomparable, beautiful-a sensation!
- Is that all?

735
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,714
I've just begun. It would take days and
years to tell you how superb you were.

736
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,270
We're having supper tonight
at the Café de L'Opéra.

737
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:07,070
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
Anatole, but I can't tonight.

738
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,310
Why not? Have you another engagement?

739
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,630
- Yes.
- With whom?

740
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,597
With Raoul.

741
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,148
- That policeman?
- <i>(knock at door)</i>

742
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,595
- Come in.
- Christine!

743
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,391
- Oh.
- Oh.

744
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,748
<i>(both)</i> Christine...

745
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,310
- You two know each other, of course.
- <i>(both)</i> Of course.

746
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,960
How soon will you be ready?
The carriage is waiting.

747
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:37,989
- I know Monsieur Garron will excuse us.
- Anatole has just asked me to supper too.

748
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,755
No doubt. You won't be long,
will you, Christine?

749
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:47,312
I have an idea. Why can't we three have
supper together? It's all ordered, isn't it?

750
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,119
I am not in the habit of
taking baritones to supper.

751
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,998
And I do not care to be
seen in public with the police.

752
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,391
Christine, you'll have to
make up your mind finally between us.

753
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,391
Precisely.

754
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,119
<i>(Vercheres)</i>
Don't push, monsieur! Oh, no, no.

755
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,078
- Excuse... Mademoiselle...
- Excuse me.

756
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,515
Don't push, monsieur, please!

757
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:31,074
Will you join me for a bit of supper
at the Café de L'Opéra?

758
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,751
With pleasure, monsieur.

759
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,711
Think we can get through this crowd?

760
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,588
Certainly. After all, who'd pay any
attention to a baritone and a detective?

761
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,671
Quite right.

762
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,872
- After you, monsieur.
- After <i>you, </i> monsieur.
