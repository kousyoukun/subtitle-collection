而且一直认为她很出色

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,490
不过她和我的家乡远隔重洋...
But, you know, a million, million miles from the world I live in...

32
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,230
我住在诺丁山--伦敦我最喜欢的地方
which is here, Notting Hill, my favorite bit of London.

数以百计的摊贩无处不在

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,250
布满整个街道,一直排到诺丁山的大门
filling Portobello Road, right up to Notting Hill Gate.

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,950
最棒的是有很多朋友 也住在这个伦敦的小区里
And what's great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London.

这个小社区有间蓝色门脸的房子...
in this small village in the middle of the city in a house with a blue door...

49
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,710
是我妻子和我一起买的, 后来她跟别人走了...
that my wife and I bought together before she left me for a man...

嘿,你能帮我作个非常重要的决定吗?
Hey, you coudn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?

54
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,400
象能否取消第三世界国家的债务一样重要吗?
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel Third World debt?

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,630
正是这样,我终於要和简妮约会了
That's right. I am at last going out on a date with the great Janine,

56
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,300
我得保证穿最适合的T恤去赴约
and I just wanna be sure I've picked the right T-shirt.

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,370
-有些什么选择? -稍等片刻
-What are the choices? -Well, wait for it.

58
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,590
(我喜欢血腥)

59
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,980
首先是这件,很酷吧?
First there's this one. [ Growls ] Cool, huh?

60
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,520
是的,不过用它来制造浪漫气氛困难了点
Yeah, it might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.

61
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,260
一针见血,别灰心
Point taken. Don't despair.

62
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,110
如果期待浪漫的话,我相信有合适的
If it's romance we're looking for, I believe I have just the thing.

63
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,450
(来这儿)

64
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,470
哦,又来了, 她恐怕不会认为你脑子里有真正的爱
Yeah, well, there again, she might not think you had true love on your mind.

65
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,620
好吧,再等等
Right. Just one more.

66
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,740
真爱,我来啦
True love, here I come.

67
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,950
(你是世上最美丽的女人)

68
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,150
是的,是的,这--这件很合适
Well, yeah. Yeah, that's-- that's, um, perfect.

69
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,220
好极了,谢谢
Great. Thanks.

70
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,660
-祝我好运 -祝你好运
-Wish me luck. -Good luck.

71
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,970
(想做爱吗?)

72
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,330
那只是另一个毫无希望的星期三
[Man Narrating] And so it was just another hopeless Wednesday,

73
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,210
我路过拥挤的集市去上班
as I walked the thousand yards through the market to work,

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,920
从没想过这一天将会永远改变我的生活
never suspecting that this was the day that was gonna change my life forever.

75
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,650
顺便说一下,这是我工作的小旅游书店
This is work, by the way, my little travel bookshop,

76
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,710
-早,马丁 -早,老板
-Morning, Martin. -Morning, Monsignor.

77
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,820
这里专门卖旅游书刊
which, um, well, sells travel books,

78
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,330
老实说,销路并不怎么好
and to be frank with you, doesn't always sell many of those.

79
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,330
好极了,利润全来自促销
Classic. Profit from major sales push,

80
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,720
亏了347镑
minus ￡347.

81
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,870
我去替你买杯"卡布奇诺"好吗?
Shall I, uh, go and get you a cappuccino?

82
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,940
-也许能缓解一点痛苦 -是的,是的
-You know, ease the pain a bit. -Yeah, yeah.

83
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,100
不过我只付得起半杯的钱
Better make it a half. All I can afford.

84
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,780
照你的意思,半杯咖啡马上就来
Get your logic. Demi-cappu coming right up.

85
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,270
[ Doorbell Dings ]

86
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,630
　要帮忙吗?
Um, can I help you at all?

87
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,110
不,谢谢,我只想...看看
No, thanks. I'll just... look around.

88
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,260
好的
Fine.

89
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,650
那本书确实不怎么样
Uh, that book's really not great.

90
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,850
万一你略略看过就买下它 那就是在浪费自己的钱了
Just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying. You'd be wasting your money.

91
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,550
如果你对土耳其感兴趣的话
But if it's Turkey you're interested in,

92
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,660
这本就不同了,非常棒
um, this one, on the other hand, is very good.

93
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,960
我想写这本书的人真正去过土耳其, 言之有物
Um, I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps.

94
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,930
提到了不少有趣的民俗风情
Um, there's also a very amusing incident with a kebab,

95
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,770
这本比较有意思
um, which is one of many amusing incidents.

96
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,800
谢谢,我会考虑的
Thanks. I'll think about it.

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,400
或者选那本更大些的精装本,有...
Or, in the bigger hardback variety, there's--

98
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,640
抱歉,失陪一下
Um, sorry. Can you just give me a second?

99
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,910
打扰一下
Excuse me.

100
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,820
-什么事? -很不幸
-Yes? -Bad news.

101
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,990
-什么? -我们店里装了监视器
-What? -We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.

102
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,220
-所以? -所以我看到你把书放进你的裤子
-So? -So I saw you put that book down your trousers.

103
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,930
-什么书? -放进你裤子的那本
-What book? -The one down your trousers.

104
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,600
我没把什么书放到裤子里
I don't have a book down my trousers.

105
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,630
好吧
Right.

106
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,000
告诉你,我会叫警察,而且...
I tell you what. Um, I'll call the police, and, um,

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,410
如果是我弄错了"书掉进裤子"的事, 我会道歉
if I'm wrong about the whole "book down the trousers" scenario, I really apologize.

108
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,850
好吧,如果...我往裤子里放了一本书呢?
Okay. What if... I did have a book down my trousers?

109
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,450
很简单,当我回到柜台时
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk,

110
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,420
你把裤子里那本"巴厘旅游指南"拿出来...
you'd remove the Cadogan Guide to Bali from your trousers...

111
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,220
擦干净放回去或是买下来
and either wipe it and put it back or buy it.

112
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,690
回头见
I'll see you in a sec.

113
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,230
对不起
I'm sorry about that.

114
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,530
不,没关系
No, it's fine.

115
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,600
我本来想偷,但现在改变主意了
I was gonna steal one, but now I've changed my mind.

116
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,800
我看到有作者的签名
Oh, signed by the author, I see.

117
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,200
是啊,他非要签不可
Um, yeah, couldn't stop him.

118
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,170
如果你能找到本没签名的, 那绝对　要好运气
If you can find an unsigned one, it's worth an absolute fortune.

119
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,240
打扰一下
-[ Chuckles ] -Excuse me.

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,340
-什么事? -能替我签个名吗?

121
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,880
当然
Uh, sure.

-你叫什么? -鲁弗斯
-What's your name? -Rufus.

124
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,400
写了些什么?
What does it say?

125
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,530
我的签名,上面写的是 "亲爱的鲁弗斯,去监狱吧"
That's my signature. And above it, it says, "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail."

126
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,710
真不错
Good one.

127
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,840
-你想要我的电话吗? -好提议
-Do you want my phone number? -Tempting.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,960
不过...不用了,谢谢
But... no. Thank you.

129
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,680
我要买这本
I will take this one.

The problem is she left the message with my flatmate...

Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting.

-I mean, the wages are a scandal, aren't they? -They can be.

536

我知道有些机灵的家伙干这行比你更久
I see friends from university-- clever chaps. Been in the business longer than you.

So that's, well, fairly good.

-我不该那么做 -你有权利那样做
[ Anna ] I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that.

789
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,720
不,你做得很好,我太鲁莽愚蠢了
No, you were brilliant. I'm rash and I'm stupid.

790
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:45,890
我跟你在一起干什么?
What am I doing with you?

791
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:48,590
我恐怕不知道
Uh, I don't know, I'm afraid.

792
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,600
我也不知道
I don't either.

793
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,700
我们到了
Here we are.

794
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,710
是的
Yes.

795
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,580
-那么-- -你想上去吗?
-Well, look-- -Do you wanna come up?

796
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:10,760
这似乎...有太多不方便,所以--
Well, there seem to be... lots of reasons why I shouldn't, so--

797
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,760
是有太多不方便
There are lots of reasons.

798
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,270
你想上去吗?
Do you wanna come up?

799
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,910
五分钟后上来行吗?
Give me five minutes?

800
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,170
-嗨 -嗨
-Hi. -Hi.

801
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,340
能这样吻你真是太美妙了
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.

802
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,440
-你得离开 -怎么了?
-You've got to go. -Why?

803
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,650
因为我美国的男朋友现在就在隔壁房间
Because my boyfriend who was in America is, in fact, now in the next room.

804
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,950
-男朋友? -是的
-Boyfriend? -Yes.

805
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:04,590
-宝贝,是谁? -啊,是,唔--
-Baby, who is it? -Uh, it's, uh--

806
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,500
房间服务
-Uh-- -Uh, room service.

807
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,200
哦,你好, 我还以为你们总是穿著企鹅似的燕尾服呢
Oh. How you doing? I thought you guys always wore those, uh, penguin coats.

808
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,210
通常是的
Usually we do.

809
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,150
不过我刚换了衣准备回家
But I was just, uh-- just changed to go home.

810
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:23,450
只是顺便来问一下
And, um, then I thought I'd take this final call.

811
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,250
太好了,不介意的话,我正想要些东西
Oh, great. If you don't mind, I would like something too.

812
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,890
麻烦你送些非常非常冷的水来好吗?
Could you bring me up some really, really cold water?

813
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,360
我找找看吧
I'll see what I can do.

814
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:34,690
-越冷越好 -没问题,保证很冰凉
-Still, not sparkling. -Absolutely.Ice-cold still water.

815
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,240
当然,除非英国不允许给客房提供冷水
Unless, of course, it's illegal in the U.K. to serve beverages below room temperature.

816
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,030
我可不希望 你为了满足我一时的兴致而进监狱
I wouldn't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whim now.

817
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:46,350
-不,我确信这不会有问题 -谢谢 -我--
-No, I'm sure it's fine. -Thank you. -I--

818
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:50,410
嘿,还有一件事, 麻烦你把这些脏盘子和垃圾带走好吗?
Hey, one more thing. Could you adios these dirty dishes and take out that trash too?

819
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,140
好的
Uh-- Right.

820
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:58,160
不,不,不用--不要这么做
No. No. Um, don't-- don't-- don't do that.

821
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,600
我想打扫卫生并不是他的工作
I don't think it's his job to clear.

822
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:04,900
哦,对不起,对不起, 你叫什么,夥计?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's your name, man?

823
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,110
伯尼
Bernie.

824
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,410
听我说,伯尼
Oh, listen, Bernie.

825
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,780
谢谢你,真是非常感谢
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

826
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,080
嘿,你…
Hey, you. [ Nervous Chuckle ]

827
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:25,130
告诉我,告诉我,我来这你感到高兴吗?
So, tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Good surprise or nasty surprise?

828
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,030
-当然高兴 -哦,你这个骗子.她讨厌惊喜
-Good surprise. -Oh, you're such a liar.

829
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,540
你想要些什么?
She hates surprises. Hey, what areyou gonna order?

830
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:33,540
-什么? -告诉他你想要些什么?
-Huh? -From him. What are you gonna order?

831
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,580
我还没想好
Um, I haven't decided yet.

832
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,740
哦,好吧,别点太多
Oh, well, don't overdo it.

833
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,980
我可不想有人说: "那个著名男演员有个肥胖女友"
I don't want people saying, "There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."

834
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:45,620
我该走了
I should leave.

835
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,290
遇上这种情形真是很尴尬
This is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.

836
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,580
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

837
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,610
我不知道...
I don't know...

838
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,980
该说什么
what to say.Well,

839
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:10,970
我想,唔
I think, um,

840
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,820
通常是说"再见"
"good-bye" is traditional.

841
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:33,530

842
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,080

~ 可以随心所欲 ~

~ 你怎么能阻止雨丝淅淅而落 ~
~ How can you stop the rain from falling down ~

~ 不再运转 ~
~ Go round~

858
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,740
别这样
 -Come on.

859
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,710
说出来
-Open up.

860
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,930
是我,斯派克
This is me. Spikey.

861
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:31,810
我知道你受了很大的精神打击
I'm in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrations.

862
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:37,320
来吧,说给我听听
Come on. Hit me with it.

863
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,960
有个女孩--
-There's this girl-- -Aha.

864
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:47,830
我就知道和女人有关,很好
See, I been gettin' a female vibe. Good.

865
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,530
继续说,好朋友
Speak on, dear friend.

866
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:53,170
她是那种...
She's someone who...

867
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,340
不可能属于我的人
can't be mine, and, uh,

868
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:04,010
这就像瘾君子永远再买不到毒品一样
it's as if I've taken love heroin, and now I can't ever have it again.

869
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:07,320
我打开潘多拉魔盒,但里面只有麻烦
I've opened Pandora's box and there's trouble inside.

870
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,130
呃
Mmm.

871
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:13,560
没错
Yeah.

872
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,230
麻烦
Tricky.

873
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,240
麻烦
Tricky.

874
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,710
我上学时就认识一个叫潘多拉的女孩
I knew a girl at school called Pandora.

875
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,620
尽管从没看到过她的私处(盒子)
Never got to see her box, though. [ Chuckling ]

876
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,630
好了
Right.

877
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:35,390
好了,谢谢,这很有帮助
Right. Thanks. That's very helpful. [Spike Laughing]

878
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,760
你不知道她有男朋友?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?

879
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,330
不知道
No. No.

880
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,340
怎么?你们早就知道?
Why? Did you?

881
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,080
该死,我真不敢相信
 Bloody hell. I don't believe it.

882
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,310
我这辈子就毁在不看八卦杂志上了
My whole life ruined because I don't read Hello magazine.

883
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,190
面对现实吧,这根本是毫无指望的
Let's face facts. This was always a no-win situation.

884
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,190
安娜是...个女神
Anna's... a goddess.

885
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:04,330
你该知道凡人爱上神会有什么结果
You know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.

886
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,110
-死无葬身之地? -无一幸免
- Buggered, is it? - Every time.

887
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:12,010
但不要绝望,我有办法解决你的问题
But don't despair. I think I have the solution to your problems.

888
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,980
-是吗? -她叫泰莎
-Really? -Mm-hmm.Her name is Tessa,

889
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,920
她在公证部门工作
and she works in the contracts department.

890
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:20,280
我承认她的发型是老式的卷发
The hair, I admit, is unfashionably frizzy,

891
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,450
但她小巧可爱, 而且接吻时就像是死囚区的慕男狂
but she's bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row.

892
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,430
一看就知道
Apparently. [ Others Laughing]

893
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:29,230
[Doorbell Ringing]

894
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,860
试试看
Now... try.

895
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,100
我完全迷路了
[ Tessa ] I got completely lost.

896
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,780
很难找不是吗?每个地方都写著"肯辛顿"
It's very difficult, isn't it? Everything's got the word "Kensington" in it.

897
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,150
肯辛顿公园大道,肯辛顿花园, 该死的肯辛顿公园、花园
Kensington Park Road. Kensington Garden. Kensington bloody Park Garden.

898
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:45,750
-泰莎,这是贝拉,我太太 -你好
-Tessa, this is Bella,my wife. -Hello.

899
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,850
-你坐的是轮椅 -没错
-You're in a wheelchair. -That's right.

900
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,590
这个是威廉
And this is William.

901
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,990
-你好,威廉 -嗨
-Hello, William. -Hi.

902
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,130
-马克经常跟我提起你 -是吗?
-Max has told me everything about you. -Has he?

903
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,700
是的,你是个淘气的家伙
Oh, yes. You are a naughty boy.

904
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,040
-要酒吗? -哦,是的,谢谢
-Wine? -Oh, yes, please.

905
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,330
来吧,威利,一醉方休
Come on, Willie. Let's get sloshed.

906
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:05,440
-红酒白酒? -红酒
-Red or white? -Red.

907
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:10,480
克赛
Keziah.

908
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:15,250
-要丘鹬肉吗? -不,谢谢,我是果食主义者
-Some woodcock? -No, thank you.I'm a fruitarian.

909
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,870
什么是果食主义者?
What is a fruitarian, exactly?

910
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,700
我们相信水果和蔬菜是有感觉的
We believe that fruits and vegetables have feelings,

911
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:28,300
煮熟它们太残忍
so we think cooking is cruel.

912
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,370
我们只吃从树上自然掉落的东西
We only eat things that have fallen from the tree or bush,

913
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,640
那说明它们已经死亡
that are, in fact, dead already.

914
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:40,720
啊,哦,是的
Ah. Oh, right.

915
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,730
是的
Right.

916
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,990
那么,这些胡萝　呢?
So, um, these carrots?

917
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:47,690
-是被谋杀的 -谋杀?
-Have been murdered, yes. -Murdered.

918
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,360
可怜的老胡萝　,这真--
Poor old carrots. That's--

919
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,370
真残忍
That's beastly.

920
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,840
咖啡真不错
Delicious coffee.

921
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:03,510
我知道小羊肉没做好
I'm sorry about the lamb. [ Laughing ]

922

Minimum input, maximum publicity.

Everywhere you go, people will say, "Well done, you.

You slept with that actress. We saw the pictures."

-That is spectacularly unfair. -That's yours.

1194

大家会希望从那个干了安娜-斯科特...
Maybe it'll even help business. Buy a boring book about egypt...

冷静点,喝杯茶怎么样?
Calm down. How about a cup of tea?

我不要什么茶
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.

斯派克这下名利双收了
Spike owes you an expensive dinner or holiday,

1203

全亏了有这份曝料的收入
depending who's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.

This is crazy behavior.

我们不能一笑了之吗?
Can't we just laugh about all this?

1207
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:43,840
说真的,想想世上的大事,这不算什么
Seriously. In the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.

1208

接下来他该说苏丹还有人挨饿了
What he's gonna say next is there's people starving in the Sudan.

1209

There are! We don't have to go anywhere near that far.

My best friend slipped down stairs, cracked her back...

1211

and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life.

1212
01:25:56,660 --> 01:26:01,030
我们可以看开一点
All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.

说得不错,的确是这样
You're right. Of course, you're right.

It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years.

我们的视角完全不同
Our perspectives are very different.

1217

Every time anyone writes anything about me, they'll dig up these photos.

1224
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:35,520
媒体永远不会忘记
Newspapers last forever.

I'll regret this forever.

I will feel the opposite,

1229

if that's okay by you, and, uh,

01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:54,940
你真的想通了?
-So you've laid the ghost? -~ Wah, wah, wah, wah ~

1320
01:33:55,010 --> 01:34:00,610
-我相信是的 -不会再提那倒霉的名女人吧?
-I believe I have. -Don't give a damn about the famous girl?

1321
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:05,090
不,不,我想不会
~ [ Continues Indistinct ] No. No, I don't think I do.

1322
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:08,050
那表示你不会再为她的消息而心烦, 包括她已回到伦敦...
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London...

1323
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:12,890
获得了奥斯卡奖, 以及目前正在汉普提希兹拍片
grasping her Oscar and currently to be found filming, most days, on Hampstead Heath.

1324
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:16,660
老天,不会吧
Oh, God, no.

1325
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:22,730
看来还是忘不了她
So not over her, in fact.

1326
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,210
[Laughter]

1327
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:09,180
-　要帮忙吗? -是的,我--
-Can I help you? -Yeah, I'm, um--

1328
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:11,650
-我要找安娜-斯科特 -她知道你会来吗?
-I'm looking for Anna Scott. -Does she know you're coming?

1329
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:15,090
不,不,她不知道
No. No, uh, she doesn't.

1330
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:18,390
-恐怕我不能让你过去 -是的
-I'm afraid I can't let you through, sir. -Right.

1331
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:23,650
不过我确实是她的朋友,不是疯子
I mean, I am actually a friend. I'm not a lunatic, but--

1332
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:26,590
-你用不著太-- -恕我无法通融,先生
-No, you basically, er-- -Can't let you through, sir.

1333
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:13,440
-这是-- -我昨天才知道你在这
-Well, this is-- -I only found out you were here yesterday.

1334
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:17,280
-我想打电话的,可-- -安娜
-I was going to call,but I-- -[ Woman ] Uh, Anna.

1335
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:19,810
就来
Yes. Um--

1336
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,320
现在不太方便,我们今天要杀青
Things aren't going very well, and it's our last day.

1337
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:24,820
没关系,看得出你很忙
Absolutely, yeah. You're clearly very busy.

1338
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:27,320
不过,如果你能等的话
But if-- if you could wait,

1339
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:30,050
有些...事要跟你说
there are...things to say.

1340
01:36:34,530 --> 01:36:36,460
好的
Okay.

1341
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,300
喝杯茶,这有的是茶
Drink tea. There's lots of tea.

1342
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:49,680
过来看看吧
Come and have a look.

1343
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:57,210
你是亨利-詹姆斯的拥趸?
Are you a fan of Henry James?

1344
01:36:57,290 --> 01:37:00,010
-这是他的本子吗? -是的
-This is a Henry James film? -Yeah.

1345
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,490
这是哈利
This is, uh, Harry.

1346
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,760
他会给你一副耳机让你听听对白
He'll give you a pair of headphones so you can hear the dialogue.

1347
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:14,770
-非常感谢 -不客气
-Thank you very much. -No problem.

1348
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:17,440
-嗨 -嗨,拿著
-Hi. -Hi. Here we go.

1349
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,890
-音量调节在边上,坐吧 -谢谢
-Volume's on the side. There. Have a seat. -Thank you.

1350
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,350
我们住在这么个乱糟糟的地方
[ Man Through Headphones ] We are living in cloud cuckoo land.

1351
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:34,940
-我们今天肯定拍不完 -必须拍完,我周二要去纽约
-We'll never get this done today. -[ Anna ] We've got to. I have to be in New York on Thursday.

1352
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:39,350
别炫耀了,老天,那真是个大屁股
Oh, stop showing off. God, that's an enormous ass.

1353
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:43,620
-我没听到 -不过说真的,这不正确
-I'm not listening. -But seriously,it's not fair.

1354
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:46,030
有太多可怜的年轻人得了厌食症
So many tragic young teenagers with anorexia,

1355
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:52,700
和那些大屁股女人呆在一起, 那姑娘的臀部确实值得她自豪
and that girl has an ass she could perfectly well share around with at least ten other women and still be big-bottomed.

1356
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:55,110
我在想,看著如此美好的事物...
I would think, looking at something nice like that,

1357
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:59,300
你那...露骨的有关臀部的借口...
you and your... bony little excuse for an arse...

1358
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:01,770
该被警告保持安静
would be well advised to keep quiet.

1359
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,810
还是说正事吧,最后一场戏
Now down to business. The end of the scene.

1360
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,080
你告诉大家时我问你,然后你说--
Um, I ask you when you're telling everyone, and you say--

1361
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:11,310
明天很快就到了
Um, tomorrow will be soon enough.

1362
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:13,720
接下来我--好的
And then I-- Right. Okay.

1363
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,560
你刚才和他说过话, 显得怯生生的那个家伙是什么人?
Say, who was that rather diffident chap I saw you talking to round the back?

1364
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,730
没有啊
No one.

1365
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:24,160
只是以前认识罢了,我--
Just some guy from the past. I--

1366
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:28,170
这真的有点尴尬,我不知道他来这干什么
It's a bit of an awkward situation, really. I don't know what he's doing here.

1367
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:47,220
当然
'Course.

1368
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:56,090
谢谢,我得--
Thanks. I've got to, um--

1369
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:58,100
随时来
Any time.

1370
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:11,130
各位女士先生 请大家就定位了，拜托
[Man ] Ladies and gentlemen, can we have you on your first marks?

1371
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:13,330
到第一个位置
On your first marks!

1372
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:28,620
我讨厌在你工作的时候打扰你
Uh, I-I do hate to disturb you whilst you're cooking the books,

1373
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:32,020
但是有人送东西给你
but, uh, there's a delivery for you.

1374
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,460
马丁,你就不能代我签收一下吗?
Martin, really. Can't you just do it yourself?

1375
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:39,060
可这不是店里的事,是你个人的
N-- But you see, this is not for the shop. This is for you.

1376
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:43,800
好吧,告诉我,如果我雇用一块湿抹布
Right. Okay. Tell me. If I employ a wet rag,

1377
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,500
我是不是该付给它和你一样多的报酬?
would I have to pay it as much as I pay you?

1378
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,910
嗨
Hi.

1379
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:57,720
-你好 -你不辞而别了
-Hello. -You disappeared.

1380
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:04,260
我只是不想再打扰你
I had to leave. I didn't want to disturb.

1381
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,360
-近来还好吗? -挺好,挺好
-How have you been? -Fine, fine.

1382
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:09,560
基本上是老样子. 一旦有所改变...
Everything much the same. When they change the law,

1383
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:12,760
斯派克和我就会很快结婚
Spike and I will marry immediately.

1384
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,900
我听说了你的消息
Whereas you, I've watched in wonder.

1385
01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:18,200
-你获了奖 -算了吧
-Awards, glory. -Oh, no.

1386
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,710
那--那没太多意义,真的
It's-- It's all nonsense, believe me.

1387
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:24,750
我不知道没有意义到什么程度,但...
I'd no idea how much nonsense it was, but...

1388
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:26,750
肯定毫无意义
nonsense it all is.

1389
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:31,410
呃
Well, um--

1390
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:36,480
昨天是我们电影杀青的日子, 所以...我走开了
Yesterday was our last day of filming, so... I'm leaving.

1391
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:42,090
不过--
But, um--

1392
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:45,530
我从家里给你带来了这个
I brought this for you from home,

1393
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,730
所以我来送给你
so I thought I'd give it to you.

1394
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:52,470
谢谢
Thank you.

1395
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:54,470
我能--
Shall I--

1396
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:57,140
不,现在别打开,我会觉得尴尬
Oh, no, don't open it now. I'll be embarrassed.

1397
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:03,080
谢谢,我不知道是什么,但还是要谢谢你
Well, thank you. I don't know what it's for, but thanks anyway.

1398
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:07,580
它以前是放在我的公寓里, 我觉得你会--
Actually, I had it in my apartment, and I thought you'd--

1399
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:13,120
但想要打电话时却不知该怎么说
But when it came to it, I didn't know how to call,

1400
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:16,290
表现真是差劲
having behaved so badly.

1401
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,300
两次了
Twice.

1402
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:24,060
所以它一直被放在酒店里
So it's just been sitting in the hotel.

1403
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:28,470
然后你来了...我想--
Then you came and... I figured--

1404
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:34,480
事情是--
The thing is--

1405
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:37,540
事情是--
The thing is--

1406
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,150
什么?什么事情?
What? What is the thing?

1407
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:45,720
想都不要想,快出去
Don't even think about it. Go away immediately.

1408
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:48,450
-出去 -好的
-Go away. -Right.

1409
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:50,460
抱歉
Sorry.

1410
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:55,160
继续说好吗?
You were saying?

1411
01:41:57,670 --> 01:42:01,130
好的
Yes.

1412
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:04,040
我今天就要走,不过我...
I have to go away today, but I...

1413
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:07,410
想知道如果我没有...
wondered if I didn't...

1414
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:11,880
不管你是让我略作停留
whether you might let me see you a little,

1415
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:14,820
还是...久留,也许吧
or... a lot, maybe.

1416
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:21,990
想看看你是否还会喜欢我
See if you could like me again.

1417
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:27,620
但昨天那个男演员问你我是谁时, 你表示已经成为过去了
But yesterday that actor asked you who I was, and you just dismissed me out of hand.

1418
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:30,790
我听到了
I heard.

1419
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:34,000
你戴著麦克风
-You had a microphone. -I had headphones.

1420
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:38,670
你希望我告诉那个英国最轻浮的男人 有关我生活的真话吗?
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england?

1421
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:42,580
打扰一下
Uh, excuse me.

1422
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:45,080
你妈妈来的电话
It's your mother on the phone.

1423
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:49,980
告诉她我会打给她好吗?
Will you tell her I'll ring her back?

1424
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,990
我试过但碰了钉子, 她说你之前就这么说
I've actually tried that tack, but she said you've said that once before,

1425
01:42:52,990 --> 01:42:54,960
但足足过了24小时...
and it's now been about 24 hours...

1426
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:58,690
脚都站肿了,现在成了紫中带黑的颜色
and the foot that was purple is now sort of blackish in color and--

1427
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:02,220
好吧,好吧,来得可真是时候
Right, right. Yeah. Perfect timing, as ever.

1428
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:07,500
马丁,帮我招呼一下
Martin, hold the fort a second.

1429
01:43:07,570 --> 01:43:09,930
好的,没问题
Uh,yes. All right.

1430
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,600
我只想说--
Um, could I just say--

1431
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:22,740
我觉得"人鬼情未了"是最棒的电影
[ Chuckles ] I thought Ghost was the most wonderful film.

1432
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:26,650
-是吗? -哦,是的
-Is that right? -Oh, yes.

1433
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:29,630
[ Chuckles ]

1434
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:33,530
我一直想知道...
Um, I've always wondered...

1435
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:37,020
派屈克-施瓦兹在现实生活中是什么样子
what Patrick Swayze's like in-- in-- in real life.

1436
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:40,730
我不敢说我有多　解派屈克
I can't say that I know Patrick all that well.

1437
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:43,000
他在拍片的时候不太友好吗?
He wasn't that friendly during filming?

1438
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:48,610
我相信他对黛米-摩尔很友善, 就是和他演对手戏的那个
Well, I'm sure he was friendly to Demi Moore, who acted with him in Ghost.

1439
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,280
哦,哦,是的
Oh. Oh, right.

1440
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,210
对不起
Sorry. [Nervous Chuckle ]

1441
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:00,350
我总是这么糊里糊涂的
Always been a bit of an ass. [ Chuckling ]

1442
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:03,390
总之--
Um, anyway-- Um--

1443
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:05,360
很高兴见到你
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

1444
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,790
我是你最最忠实的影迷
I'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

1445
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:11,590
当然也是黛米的
And Demi's, of course.

1446
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:16,330
不好意思
Sorry about that.

1447
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,140
没关系

Well, you know,
