情书
The Love Letter

3
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,751
1998年贺曼频道出品

4
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:31,526
听译，意译，时间轴：terrence
学生一枚，水平有限，请见谅！

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,538
太漂亮了

6
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:40,776
- 进去看看？
- 好啊

7
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,570
你好，两位。我叫雅各布・坎贝尔

8
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,908
她是个大美人，对吧？

9
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:04,615
- 我能试试看吗？
- 噢，衣服不外卖

10
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,868
它是奶奶的遗物

11
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:11,067
只是为了吸引顾客，尤其是年轻的小姐们

12
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:13,344
那些有人陪伴的

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,936
呵呵，精明的做法

14
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:18,708
- 这里有更多
- 好的

15
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:42,904
- 你是个南北战争的爱好者？
- 是啊，可以这么说

16
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:46,721
- 介意我看看这些吗？
- 你看吧

17
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,794
我自己也藏有一些

18
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:56,079
- 前几天我刚弄到了这东西

19
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:58,978
- 历史可久了
- 真不错

20
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:16,564
- 太漂亮了
- 桌子是内战时一个将军的

21
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,079
是啊？

22
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,830
黛布拉你过来看看

23
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,905
- 很棒吧？
- 看起来老掉牙了

24
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:33,148
我正需要一张书桌

25
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,844
- 你给个价
- 我本来准备自己藏着的，但是...

26
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,091
如果你真的要，800刀吧

27
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:43,304
- 噢，太贵了
- 600刀怎么样？

28
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:47,146
这东西是十九世纪的耶，
800是我能给的最低的了

29
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,985
太贵了

30
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,930
第一次看你这么冲动

31
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:13,256
我需要更多的自发性

32
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:17,050
希望下次你再这样的话，
是一些...轻点的东西

33
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,503
你知道你有多可爱吗

34
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,775
绝对是个写东西的好地方

35
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,271
毫无疑问！

36
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,700
哪个时候得给它打打蜡，抛抛光

37
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:39,670
- 我该走了
- 你走吧

38
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:41,762
好吧

39
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,060
- 做个美梦
- 你也是

40
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,313
伊丽莎白・威仕肯
1863年4月16日

41
00:06:19,348 --> 00:06:24,725
亲爱的，午夜已过
终于我可以自由地向你倾述了

42
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,060
母亲，父亲还有弗洛丝说了晚安

43
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:31,524
而我更想要一个安静美好的夜晚

44
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,162
我29岁了，得到了几个先生的约见

45
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:40,002
但只有你是我的唯一

46
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:44,460
即便你不是真实的，你也比今晚那个

47
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:48,032
拉着我的手向我求婚的男人珍贵

48
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:51,007
我根本不喜欢他

49
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,825
虽然我尝试过去恳求父亲

50
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,693
不幸的是，我必须服从

51
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:00,006
并且尽快接受

52
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:04,125
但是我为炽烈燃烧的爱火

53
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,790
还有皎洁的月光而痛苦着

54
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,100
我用灵魂和心灵和你交谈

55
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,400
如果你真的存在的话

56
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,754
晚安，亲爱的
梦中与我相会

57
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,555
亲爱的女士

58
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:32,587
我刚刚在你的书桌
一个神秘的隔层里发现你的信

59
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:39,033
我读了它们

60
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:47,992
希望我能给你一些帮助

61
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:53,345
我知道这是对你父亲的一份义务

62
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,604
但你还是应该遵循你的心声

63
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,362
和你不爱的人结婚是一个错误

64
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:01,825
不要绝望，那个梦中情人

65
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,668
也许现在就在你周围，任何地方

66
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,247
谁知道呢，或许我就是你要找的人

67
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,876
但是亲爱的，很不幸
我已把我的心献给了郝思嘉（乱世佳人女主）

68
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:20,532
永远是你的挚爱，白瑞特（乱世佳人男主）

69
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,876
你哪个时候能弄完？

70
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:45,166
不用担心，很快就好

71
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,343
这游戏会毁了我们的圣诞假期的

72
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:50,245
反正我会准备好的

73
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,144
那最好了，不然我们有麻烦的

74
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,431
不，不要中断（指游戏）

75
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,092
- 有信息
- 波斯顿

76
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:14,733
我看看，
哦，在这里

77
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:17,239
- 威洛比的一个地方
- 在哪里？

78
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:20,342
北面大概半小时路程，塞勒姆旁边

79
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:24,688
地址是，米尔普莱恩路3号

80
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:26,978
那是郊区的一座老房子

81
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,788
6分52秒，还不够快啊，目标是6分50

82
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:49,996
我已经很高兴了，你们呢？

83
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:52,566
我累得不行啦

84
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,719
来吧再来，我们只有6星期了

85
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,194
教练说呢，再来一次吧

86
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,862
这是私人财产，你已经侵犯了

87
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:39,699
- 抱歉，我不是有意的，我只是…
- 快给我滚！

88
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:42,046
我只是好奇以前有人住在这儿

89
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,872
到底你对这有什么好好奇的

90
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:49,254
我们可没有兴趣，
克莱思小姐出去了，没人在家

91
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:53,100


92
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,960
但是，女士...

93
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,610
第二课

94
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:16,810
（意大利语）

95
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:20,839
- 谢谢（意大利语的谢谢）
- 谢谢

96
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,029
准备得怎么样了，妈妈

97
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,131
- 出行前应该了解一下当地的文化嘛
- 你做到了，妈妈

98
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:33,113
不要再叫我碧奇思了，
我要人人都叫我碧奇基（意大利名字）

99
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:36,350
你儿子还是可以这么叫你吧？

100
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,129
你把该花在婚礼上的花了

101
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,114
然后你和黛布拉就可以去环球旅行了

102
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:50,647
- 我可不要
- 那是你的问题

103
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:55,265
你整天住在你那小世界里，多郁闷啊

104
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:58,252
是吗？

105
00:12:58,586 --> 00:13:03,533
实际上我刚刚回了一封134年的情书

106
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:09,004
- 是吗？
- 嗯，我在一张老旧的书桌里找到那些信

107
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:11,802
我梦着你

108
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:16,438
用心灵与灵魂和你交谈，只希望你真的存在

109
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,155
- 你都记着？
- 嗯，好伤感

110
00:13:22,993 --> 00:13:26,389
所以，我就...回了信

111
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,350
那你寄了吗？

112
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,733
我寄了，但邮局不相信我
所以我寄了特快专递

113
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:36,857
别自作聪明了！

114
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,667
威尔斯（英国小说家）相信时光旅行

115
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:42,771
爱因斯坦认为时间只是另一个维度

116
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:47,024
而一些人认为灵魂能穿越时空

117
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,481
你穿越去意大利了

118
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:53,107
你有地址吗？

119
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:55,799
我如果告诉了你，你又会借题发挥了

120
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,680
看我的邮箱？

121
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,751
你的邮件？

122
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:09,549
日期是1863年，寄过来要一点时间哦

123
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:14,915
- 你在哪里拿到的？
- 在书桌里，一个秘密的隔间

124
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,849
- 开玩笑吧，哪里？
- 我才刚进来

125
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,901
问问而已

126
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:31,308
这里面有个小按钮可以打开它

127
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:34,531
哇

128
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:39,784
真可怜

129
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:44,750
幻想主义者一个

130
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:48,436
却和失败者或父母内定的人结婚

131
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,428
也许她没有和他结婚

132
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:54,315
那可是19世纪60年代
她当然只能那样做

133
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,465
我去弄晚餐

134
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:09,503
1863年从波斯顿到威洛比的邮件只需1分钱

135
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:12,517
小心，在那时可不便宜

136
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:17,894
一瓶墨水，威迪文（最古老的制笔公司）
当时款式的复制品

137
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:19,486
等等

138
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:23,044
我们要什么东西都尽善尽美！

139
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,402
妈妈，停下

140
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:30,679
假设我真的是彻底疯了

141
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:35,179
那我应该在哪里把回信寄出去？

142
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:38,713
城里北部的曼哈塞帝邮局

143
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:45,635
建于1857年，
是南北战争前的邮局中唯一还在的

144
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,354
24小时都可以寄存信件

145
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:53,713
晚上去吧，我不知道为什么
但是看起来更合适

146
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:55,410
等等

147
00:15:56,027 --> 00:16:00,710
这真的行得通吗？

148
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:04,583
如果可以的话，那岂不是很好吗？

149
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:19,492
即便你不是真实的，你也比今晚那个

150
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:23,086
拉着我的手向我求婚的男人珍贵

151
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:26,029
我根本不喜欢他

152
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,826
虽然我尝试过去恳求父亲

153
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:32,803
不幸的是，我必须服从

154
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,268
并且尽快接受

155
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:39,568
但是我为炽烈燃烧的爱火

156
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,772
还有皎洁的月光而痛苦着

157
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:45,056
我用灵魂和心灵和你交谈

158
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,411
如果你真的存在的话

159
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,858
晚安，亲爱的。在梦中与我相会

160
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,736
亲爱的女士

161
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,607
我刚刚读了你的信…

162
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:18,194
…梦中情人也许现在就在你的周围
任何地方

163
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,800
谁知道呢，或许我就是你要找的人

164
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,491
一个朋友

165
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:41,523
邮局好远啊，不过我来了

166
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:32,017
- 下午好，波特先生
- 你也是，玛姬

167
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,440
伊丽莎白！

168
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:03,350
伊丽莎白！

169
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,677
弗洛丝，你见过你的姐姐吗？

170
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:11,761
她在花园里，爸爸

171
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:29,116
- 威仕肯小姐
- 里格先生

172
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:33,588
我正巧有点事经过，就来了

173
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:36,040
多好啊

174
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:42,831
- 漂亮的花，对吧？
- 是很漂亮

175
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,348
她在午夜盛开...

176
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:53,440
但到早晨，就随风消逝了

177
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:57,931
我试着给她写首诗

178
00:20:59,186 --> 00:21:02,690
我衷心希望你写完诗后念给我听

179
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:07,194
我相信你的诗一定是...赏心悦目的

180
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,750
谢了

181
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:22,190
多么美好的黄昏

182
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:28,485
我只是在练习

183
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:33,101
不，我在想，威仕肯小姐，丽茜？

184
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:35,587
什么事，里格先生？

185
00:21:35,624 --> 00:21:39,841
我只是想知道你是否充分考虑了

186
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:43,160
上次我们见面时我的建议？

187
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:47,763
噢，我仍在考虑着

188
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,590
很高兴听你这么说

189
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:37,260
我想我头有些痛，先去休息了

190
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,170
爸爸，妈妈，弗洛丝，晚安

191
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,586
丽茜，我忘了

192
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:49,551
这是你的一封信

193
00:22:52,228 --> 00:22:54,239
谢谢妈妈

194
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,544
会好的，亲爱的

195
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:36,326
- 丽茜？
- 爸爸？

196
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:48,383
母亲和我纳闷着你可能有什么要说的

197
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,223
没有啊

198
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,151
我之前和里格聊了会

199
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,859
他要我相信你们两个正在培养默契

200
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:07,185
我只是把您所谓的培养默契理解成开始而已

201
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:12,460
那么这个开始

202
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:16,016
会最终成为默契吗？

203
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:19,073
然后是订婚？

204
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:22,824
和婚姻？

205
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:29,555
爸爸，我不爱他

206
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:34,419
你已经29了，丽茜

207
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,126
爸爸，我知道你们总是为我着想

208
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:42,874
而我也知道，什么是我所期望的

209
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:47,022
这可不是我们要的期望

210
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:51,364
常识是，在你这个年纪的女人，
无论什么情况

211
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:56,648
都无法承受被拒绝的命运...

212
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:01,014
丽茜？

213
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:10,158
- 头痛？
- 是的，爸爸

214
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:16,579
- 有什么需要我做的吗？
- 没，我只需要休息

215
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,410
你是谁？

216
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:47,657
你到底是谁？

217
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,740
先生，今天我收到你的信

218
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:35,464
你的胆识令我吃惊

219
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:38,340
你到底是谁？你又是怎么知道

220
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:41,592
我这个秘密的隔间的？

221
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:46,463
当我放下另一份信时，我疑惑

222
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,316
我是陷在疯狂的梦境里

223
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:53,237
还是将再次受到你的侵犯

224
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,569
震惊的，伊丽莎白・威仕肯

225
00:28:34,353 --> 00:28:36,345
亲爱的伊丽莎白

226
00:28:36,755 --> 00:28:40,840
我肯定你也会和我一样吃惊的

227
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:45,220
我叫斯科特・柯里根，我住在波斯顿

228
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:47,596
但不是你知道的那个波斯顿

229
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:52,541
当我在我的桌子，
应该是你的桌子，读到这些字句时

230
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:55,793
我现在拥有这张桌子

231
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:59,345
读到你的回信时，我想也太荒唐了

232
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:03,042
而我唯一能给的解释是

233
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:06,460
出于某些原因，我们的联系是如此强烈

234
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:10,167
令我们能通过时空交流

235
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:13,782
如果你还觉得我在吓唬你

236
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:17,082
不要害怕，尽快回我信

237
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:19,990
你真诚的，斯科特・柯里根

238
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,927
丽茜？

239
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:25,220
- 天哪，怎么回事？
- 没

240
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:32,102
你吓坏了我，我...我刚刚走神了

241
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:35,903
- 那是因为信里的东西吗？
- 什么信？

242
00:29:36,251 --> 00:29:39,117
你不想让我看到的信

243
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,800
噢，它啊

244
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:48,994
不，只是我又被一家出版社拒绝了

245
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,971
噢，丽茜，很抱歉

246
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:58,679
你的诗是。。。非凡的！

247
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:08,162
那也要人家的杂志也这么认为时才是

248
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,178
我还是不明白为什么

249
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:14,592
你不给里格先生的杂志社投稿？

250
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:21,441
我已经投过了，在等回音呢

251
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,884
肯定会有人发表你的诗的

252
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,245
你要耐心

253
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,297
亲爱的柯里根先生

254
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,441
我决定接受是某种自然定律

255
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:08,602
在我们身上起作用了

256
00:31:08,637 --> 00:31:13,072
暂时莫名其妙地生效了

257
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:20,528
Ok，那很简单

258
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:23,655
- 但是，餐具呢？
- 餐具，是啊

259
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:30,440
你有比我好的条件，知道了我最秘密的秘密

260
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:32,773
而我没有

261
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:36,535
告诉我，你是谁，还有

262
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,882
在这么多年后的未来你是怎么生活的

263
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:44,515
- 这根怎么样？
- 那长得…太科幻了

264
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,457
最重要的是

265
00:31:46,492 --> 00:31:48,915
告诉我你我之间的强烈感应

266
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,988
这种心灵上的联系

267
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:56,014
是否也让你感受到深刻而热烈的爱情？

268
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,818
这个怎么样？

269
00:31:57,853 --> 00:32:01,043
或者你已经有爱的人了

270
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,954
尽快回信，趁现在自然定律仍有效时

271
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:10,449
- 也许我们得让别人给我们选？
- 不要，抱歉

272
00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:16,030
亲爱的丽茜，你问了我些很关键的问题

273
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:18,761
我有吗？

274
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:22,440
我有放入肉豆蔻吗？

275
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,737
肉豆蔻？放在你的蛋糕里？

276
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:27,630
你的口味也太奇怪了！

277
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:30,979
肉桂，我是说我加了肉桂进去

278
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:35,974
我渴望爱吗？当然了

279
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:38,457
我正在热恋中吗？

280
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:43,023
我已经订了婚，我相信我是在热恋中的

281
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:45,134
相信...

282
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:46,775
相信什么，小姐？

283
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:52,086
我相信这会是一个美味的蛋糕，你不认为吗？

284
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:56,243
是的，小姐。我去帮妈妈手，再见

285
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:02,107
朋友说，当你热恋时，看到恋人走近你

286
00:33:02,142 --> 00:33:05,898
你会满心欢喜，
就像一棵开满彩灯的圣诞树

287
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,832
而我不觉得有过那种感觉

288
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:13,707
直到昨晚，当我收到你第二封信时

289
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:20,263
- 你寄了几封信了？
- 3封

290
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:24,340
你肯定没有人…

291
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,397
在捣乱？不可能！

292
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:29,614
不，这才是不可能的！

293
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:32,060
那你为什么一开始还支持我？

294
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:34,801
但是我怎么都想不到...

295
00:33:35,989 --> 00:33:40,408
- 黛布拉怎么看的？
- 我没有告诉她

296
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,744
你没有告诉她？

297
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,004
- 不可置信对不？
- 我告诉你什么才是不可置信吧

298
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,001
我这个快结婚的儿子竟然
爱上一个死了100多年的女子！

299
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:56,683
妈，我们写过信

300
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:59,967
你们在写情书，还偷偷背着你的未婚妻

301
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:02,428
伊丽莎白・威仕肯又怎样？

302
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:06,128
再说你没有资格去干预人家的生活

303
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:08,506
她不爱那个男的，她不该和他结婚

304
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:11,755
我们该走了，罗马在等着你呢

305
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:15,282
真不敢相信我们都说了些什么

306
00:34:15,317 --> 00:34:18,788
- 这女的根本不存在！
- 那么谁写了这些信？

307
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:25,678
反正在你我生存的世界，她不存在

308
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:30,484
那为什么我感觉到了...我感觉到的？

309
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:34,134
那又是什么？

310
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,057
我亲爱的丽茜

311
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:44,362
我忍不住想告诉你，
当我读到你的信时有多么激动

312
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:47,784
我只希望能把你搂入怀中...

313
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:12,390
- 波特先生，你再查查看好吗？
- 好的，丽茜小姐

314
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:20,021
抱歉了，没有你的信

315
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:43,037
亲爱的，又一周过去了，还是没有回音

316
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,853
你是怕我至从告诉我你订婚后

317
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:50,121
我会认为你对我动情是可耻的吗？

318
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,762
我是怕我对你的感情一发不可收拾

319
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:57,410
我可没有你想的那样天真，柯里根先生

320
00:35:57,445 --> 00:36:00,287
我可是和很多男士共舞过

321
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:03,694
并且读过很多现代小说了

322
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:07,842
所以我知道哪些东西是不该有的

323
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:13,624
恐怕舞只能由我和黛布拉跳了，威仕肯女士

324
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:19,253
残酷的事实是，你我都注定是别人的了

325
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:25,056
我们从未碰过，
听过对方讲话或看过对方一面

326
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:29,742
而只是互通信件又有什么害处呢？

327
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,526
如果你还在那里，快回我信

328
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:45,197
告诉我像圣诞树一样
焕发光芒到底是什么一回事

329
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,762
- 早上好
- 又是你

330
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:24,300
真的很抱歉，
我只是想知道一些威仕肯家族的事情

331
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,855
为什么？

332
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:31,190
我买了一张桌子，那曾经是他们家族的

333
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:33,462
然后我就对这个家族感兴趣了

334
00:37:33,497 --> 00:37:36,313
我还写了一本有关他们的书

335
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:40,267
一本书？他们只是普通人

336
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:42,300
那你知道他们吗？

337
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:45,550
克莱思的奶奶是威仕肯女士

338
00:37:45,585 --> 00:37:49,057
- 克莱思？
- 我照顾的女士

339
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:51,849
你是说现在还有威仕肯家族的人住这？

340
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:53,408
是啊

341
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:57,915
我照顾她多年了，可知道她的古怪脾气

342
00:37:58,832 --> 00:38:01,704
我很想和她聊会，行吗？

343
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,445
她睡了

344
00:38:04,587 --> 00:38:06,923
我知道这很冒犯

345
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:10,223
但你介意我只看一眼吗？只是一眼

346
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:13,370
我为什么要允许呢？

347
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:16,217
我给这房子上墙漆吧

348
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,790
就这一面

349
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:26,597
如果你是克莱思那贱表弟的某个贱律师

350
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:28,834
那我可放不过你，进来吧

351
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:30,400
谢了

352
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:57,264
- Ok，先生，你已经看过一眼了
- 再看会

353
00:38:57,299 --> 00:39:01,474
谁啊？

354
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:03,474
看你做的好事！

355
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,142
克莱思

356
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,091
你是谁

357
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,950
这家伙写了本有关威仕肯家族的书

358
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:20,814
他想见见你

359
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:22,818
你好，夫人。我叫斯科特

360
00:39:22,853 --> 00:39:26,527
- 别傻了，他就是律师
- 不，我不是律师

361
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,170
我已经说过，我不会离开这房子

362
00:39:30,692 --> 00:39:33,015
直到一个好的律师把我带走

363
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,018
我只是想找一些有关伊丽莎白・威仕肯的资料

364
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:38,749
别骗我了，滚开

365
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:40,776
我警告过你

366
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:46,012
你怎么会知道丽茜？

367
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:52,906
我找到她的信，
在一张曾经放在这里的旧桌子里

368
00:39:54,538 --> 00:40:00,038
弗洛丝告诉我很多我姨奶奶的故事

369
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:03,107
她真的很美

370
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:05,954
但是我从没见过她

371
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:08,776
你能告诉我她结婚了吗？

372
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:14,308
我要睡了

373
00:40:15,487 --> 00:40:19,984
我想知道她是否结过婚，女士？

374
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,870
过来吧

375
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:34,747
好的

376
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:11,920
亲爱的丽茜：
富兰克林发现了电

377
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:14,403
我们现在用它来发动电器

378
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:17,796
点来我们的房子还有，圣诞树

379
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:21,305
早上好，丽茜小姐

380
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:24,050
谢谢

381
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,635
点亮圣诞树

382
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:31,395
意味洋溢着快乐，而现在我已是充满快乐了

383
00:42:32,304 --> 00:42:36,817
我去了你在米尔普莱恩路的房子，它还在

384
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,263
一个很老的女士――你妹妹的孙女住在里面

385
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:43,962
而我确实就在你的房间呆过

386
00:42:45,191 --> 00:42:50,662
但我真正不能忘怀的，
是我突然在楼梯上感觉到了你的存在

387
00:42:51,204 --> 00:42:54,233
就像...你几乎就碰到了我的胸口

388
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:59,126
这很诧异但，感觉像我也触到了你

389
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,696
丽茜，无视这一切将是对奇迹的排斥

390
00:43:04,797 --> 00:43:09,841
原谅我之前的沉默，我承诺不会再发生了

391
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:13,089
深爱你的，斯科特

392
00:43:18,532 --> 00:43:23,569
亲爱的斯科特，我恳求你守住承诺

393
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:28,130
永远不要停笔，感觉我快要停止呼吸了

394
00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:32,565
我的气息都为你在我房里流连的影子而停止

395
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:37,674
就在这个房子里，
令人惊喜的是，也是在楼梯上

396
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,080
我也有相似的感觉

397
00:43:41,115 --> 00:43:44,563
是你甜蜜诺言般的触摸

398
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,294
我知道我们要面对着命运

399
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:51,723
还有把你我世界分开的残酷现实

400
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:58,073
但我们穿过了时空，分享了爱和生活

401
00:43:58,108 --> 00:44:00,017
我也有同感

402
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,265
我梦里都是你，但是我不知道你的样子

403
00:44:05,314 --> 00:44:07,529
请寄给我你的照片

404
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,858
记住，你不能动

405
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:20,947
我只想看到你，无限接近我的双臂

406
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:35,752
- 喂
- 嗨，怎么样？ 
- 很好

407
00:44:35,817 --> 00:44:38,400
- 你呢？好极了

408
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:40,827
你好高兴，怎么啦？

409
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:43,773
因为你在这里啊

410
00:44:44,169 --> 00:44:45,858
噢，真会讨好人

411
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:48,429
那是什么？

412
00:44:48,725 --> 00:44:51,441
额，伊丽莎白・威仕肯

413
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:55,179
- 信里的那个？ 
- 是啊

414
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:59,838
- 你在哪里弄的？ 
- 她住过的老房子里

415
00:45:00,608 --> 00:45:03,452
- 你去过她的房子？
- 是啊

416
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,702
- 为什么？ 
- 好奇而已

417
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:09,402
你到底是怎么找到的？

418
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:13,517
我碰到了一个古玩店的老板，
他正从威洛比的健身房走出来

419
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:21,795
我想我应该感到庆幸

420
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:24,360
因为我的情敌已经死了

421
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:31,054
这些地是准备卖出去的

422
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:33,484
我知道你热爱自然

423
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,139
所以最近我都忙于在这一带找合适的地方

424
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:40,924
来建未来我们…一起住的房子

425
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:43,003
十分感谢

426
00:45:44,677 --> 00:45:51,356
我很好奇你是否看过一个月前我给你的诗稿

427
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:53,542
是啊，我读过

428
00:45:53,577 --> 00:45:57,805
- 那么？ 
- 很有趣

429
00:45:58,052 --> 00:46:00,000
富有激情

430
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:06,002
但在技巧上，还不太成熟

431
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,073
拿那些断开的字词，句子来说

432
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:13,956
你有独到的看法，但你需要一个导师

433
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:18,315
我希望在将来，我能在你每个方面...

434
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:21,163
都给些指导

435
00:46:22,653 --> 00:46:25,837
我决定不再写诗了

436
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:30,664
我想里格“大人”那套
太陈旧，不能很好接受我的作品

437
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:34,195
除非...它们被其他人所重视

438
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,839
但我亲爱的，事实是
不会有人重视的了

439
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:44,057
我吟唱着，但是除了你，我没有知音

440
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:48,406
所以我给你我最后的一首诗

441
00:46:50,437 --> 00:46:54,806
- 你和黛布拉快结婚了？ 
- 是的

442
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:58,502
很快了

443
00:47:00,435 --> 00:47:03,389
- 你的书很不错
- 谢了

444
00:47:04,015 --> 00:47:08,727
我。。。我能求你个忙吗？

445
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:14,190
介意看看一首诗，说说你的感受吗？

446
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:18,253
你想让我点评你的诗作？

447
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:21,863
不是我的，是朋友的短诗，介意吗？

448
00:47:22,726 --> 00:47:25,699
- 行
- 谢谢

449
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:41,009
陌生的你，我们不该相会

450
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:45,436
但我又渴望和你在一起...

451
00:47:47,148 --> 00:47:49,992
告诉他不要放弃

452
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,695
这诗有什么问题吗？

453
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:55,486
这是什么？老套的...又过于感性的？

454
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:59,062
我打算帮忙发表这些诗，你怎么看？

455
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,136
- 你还好吧？
- 至少在你说这句话之前

456
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,011
- 好吧，有什么不对劲吗？
- 你有问题

457
00:48:05,046 --> 00:48:07,830
- 我有？ 
- 对 
- 怎么回事？

458
00:48:08,423 --> 00:48:11,946
我玷污了他朋友那首圣洁的诗

459
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:17,797
你们在说什么诗？哪个朋友？

460
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:19,546
没什么

461
00:48:19,581 --> 00:48:23,016
都吵成这样了，还没有？

462
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:27,587
嗯...是伊丽莎白・威仕肯，
我又找到她的信

463
00:48:27,622 --> 00:48:30,459
只是觉得有些历史价值

464
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:33,392
那确实

465
00:48:46,396 --> 00:48:48,024
黛布拉！

466
00:48:48,337 --> 00:48:51,759
- 你怎么了？ 
- 没什么

467
00:48:53,366 --> 00:48:57,506
首先，你不跟我说找到她那些信

468
00:48:57,541 --> 00:49:01,099
然后你悄悄去她的房子，你也没说

469
00:49:01,134 --> 00:49:04,101
还有她的照片，她的诗呢！

470
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:05,638
亲爱的，不要夸大

471
00:49:05,673 --> 00:49:09,023
不！你把更多的精力放在这个女的上面，
而不是我们的婚礼

472
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:10,988
- 不是那样的
- 为什么？

473
00:49:11,023 --> 00:49:13,860
- 你是害怕结婚还是...？
- 我不理解

474
00:49:13,895 --> 00:49:16,474
如果你真不想结，就吱一声吧

475
00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:19,522
你要老实告诉我，不然我就取消婚礼

476
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:22,856
亲爱的，不要，没什么比婚礼重要了

477
00:49:23,215 --> 00:49:25,203
我真的很抱歉，亲爱的

478
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:28,604
我错了，都是我的错

479
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:35,615
亲爱的丽茜：
不要停止写你的诗

480
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:40,993
这个叫里格的家伙似乎连什么是诗都不知道

481
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,331
你说你没有知音

482
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:51,345
也许暂时没有，但十年后呢，百年后呢？

483
00:49:52,094 --> 00:49:55,576
你说我们注定不能触摸到对方

484
00:49:55,611 --> 00:49:58,296
但你用你的诗，真切地触动了我

485
00:49:58,866 --> 00:50:01,070
继续吟唱你的诗吧，我的挚爱

486
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,950
我会一直用心聆听的

487
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,639
弗洛丝，没啥可以担心的

488
00:50:13,435 --> 00:50:17,180
那为什么你要老远去波斯顿？

489
00:50:17,694 --> 00:50:21,278
医生觉得我的头痛可能和眼睛有关

490
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:23,621
还介绍了波斯顿一位专家

491
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:30,000
我和你一起去，
反正堂姐有足够的地方让我们住

492
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:31,977
不要，弗洛丝

493
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:37,218
我要你在这里帮我

494
00:50:37,963 --> 00:50:42,418
告诉你一些听起来不可思议的东西

495
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,596
可能有些病态，但绝对真实

496
00:50:46,662 --> 00:50:50,988
你要承诺不干涉我，直到我回来

497
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:56,856
各就各位，预备...开始！

498
00:51:05,385 --> 00:51:11,968
那么我要把你寄给我的
写给柯里根先生的信

499
00:51:12,228 --> 00:51:16,650
放在那个隔间，关上，它们就...

500
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:24,115
还要保证把他的信秘密寄到堂姐那儿

501
00:52:47,384 --> 00:52:49,026
他没事吧？

502
00:52:49,061 --> 00:52:51,916
心电图显示他的心律有些失常

503
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:54,679
但幸运的是，整体状况还是稳定的

504
00:52:55,127 --> 00:52:57,415
他哪个时候能醒过来？

505
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,535
目前还难说

506
00:53:47,163 --> 00:53:49,664
我是伊丽莎白・威仕肯，找里德医生

507
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:52,241
- 坐坐吧，威仕肯小姐 
- 谢谢

508
00:54:28,614 --> 00:54:31,679
下一个就是你了，威仕肯小姐

509
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,531
邓比上校

510
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,823
- 周五再过来
- 好的，医生

511
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,721
威仕肯小姐，进来吧

512
00:55:22,592 --> 00:55:24,170
我很抱歉

513
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,651
- 是你，威仕肯小姐 
- 邓比上校

514
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,934
- 真是巧啊！ 
- 请见谅

515
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:34,407
没关系，你看起来像有急事

516
00:55:34,558 --> 00:55:36,080
是的

517
00:55:36,952 --> 00:55:39,944
好吧，我不打扰了

518
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:48,806
我能陪你走走吗？

519
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:51,604
我不想弄乱你的计划

520
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,624
不，没有，我没有什么事...

521
00:55:57,245 --> 00:55:59,810
你去哪里？

522
00:56:00,299 --> 00:56:03,170
事实上...我也不知道

523
00:56:03,898 --> 00:56:08,236
我请你喝杯怎么样，然后再决定去哪里

524
00:56:11,423 --> 00:56:12,963
好啊

525
00:56:20,332 --> 00:56:22,451
你是里德医生的长期病人？

526
00:56:22,486 --> 00:56:24,839
不，我第一次来

527
00:56:26,058 --> 00:56:29,919
你...现在感觉还好吧？

528
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:33,689
嗯，很不错

529
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:41,641
我能问你一个古怪的问题吗？

530
00:56:42,356 --> 00:56:43,850
问吧

531
00:56:44,566 --> 00:56:47,746
我有十足把握我们见过面

532
00:56:49,248 --> 00:56:53,470
不知道为什么，但我也有同感

533
00:56:56,675 --> 00:57:01,865
亲爱的斯科特，这天下午
我遇到一个叫凯勒・邓比的绅士

534
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:05,659
他是马塞诸塞州19号部队的上校

535
00:57:06,024 --> 00:57:11,064
在见到他的一刻，我就被深深吸引了

536
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:15,214
而他看起来对我也有好感

537
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:20,600
亲爱的不必担心我就这样离你远去

538
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:24,388
因为和凯勒・邓比在一起，某种感觉

539
00:57:24,423 --> 00:57:28,242
让我觉得和你贴得更近了

540
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:32,959
我奇怪于这一切似乎都是注定发生的

541
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,670
- 你说过要念给我听的
- 噢不

542
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,148
好吧

543
00:57:41,518 --> 00:57:43,267
不许笑啊

544
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:48,568
陌生的你，我们不该相会

545
00:57:48,906 --> 00:57:53,524
但我又渴望和你在一起...

546
00:57:54,289 --> 00:57:57,416
我会一直等待你...

547
00:58:12,062 --> 00:58:14,357
他没事，会没事的

548
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:26,723
亲爱的斯科特，我怕再也联系不上你了

549
00:58:26,877 --> 00:58:33,095
弗洛丝确定说我给你的信
仍是一封封消失在隔间的

550
00:58:33,598 --> 00:58:36,977
所以但愿你我还是联系着

551
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:42,738
还是用信件点亮彼此的心灵

552
00:58:59,353 --> 00:59:03,619
各位女士和先生，感谢莅临

553
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:06,401
请允许我来介绍发表讲话的客人

554
00:59:06,436 --> 00:59:10,756
他将告诉你们各位的到场和慷慨捐赠

555
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:14,339
对那些为国负伤的士兵来讲是多么有意义

556
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:18,626
这位勇敢的军官在昌塞洛斯维尔战役中受伤

557
00:59:18,661 --> 00:59:22,726
但他这个星期就会重回他的军队

558
00:59:22,843 --> 00:59:27,161
热烈欢迎来自马塞诸塞州19号部队的

559
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:30,321
凯勒・邓比上校！

560
00:59:43,893 --> 00:59:46,771
你没有告诉我今晚你会来

561
00:59:46,806 --> 00:59:50,607
我想给你个惊喜

562
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:56,409
- 你很快就要回军队？ 
- 恐怕是的

563
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:00,356
- 我们还有多少时间？ 
- 我后天走

564
01:00:04,681 --> 01:00:08,085
丽茜，我想单独见你，今晚亭子见，好吗？

565
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:12,312
可我的堂姐在那儿...

566
01:00:13,886 --> 01:00:16,144
她昏昏欲睡呢

567
01:01:27,232 --> 01:01:28,800
丽茜

568
01:01:37,465 --> 01:01:43,030
- 他们设定了日程
- 谢谢

569
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:48,919
也许你需要休息一下？

570
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:52,257
不，我不累，没事

571
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:55,534
只是还在恢复

572
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,171
- 你还好吧？！ 
- 我没事

573
01:02:01,206 --> 01:02:04,219
- 我取消掉聚会吧
- 不我可以的，黛布拉

574
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,045
只是有点晕，医生说很正常的

575
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:12,697
妈妈回来了，你去陪陪她吧

576
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:16,976
- 我会很快好起来的  
- 好吧

577
01:02:17,294 --> 01:02:19,778
- 一定要给我电话 
- 我会的

578
01:02:24,793 --> 01:02:26,300
斯科特

579
01:02:27,554 --> 01:02:30,562
当你在医院醒过来时...

580
01:02:33,506 --> 01:02:35,000
怎么了？

581
01:02:36,842 --> 01:02:40,199
没事，很高兴你出院了

582
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,932
我也是

583
01:03:00,515 --> 01:03:02,803
我强烈地被他吸引了

584
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:07,034
而他也对我很有好感

585
01:03:07,226 --> 01:03:10,558
很快他就要回到军队里了

586
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:15,672
他说一场关键的战争
在宾夕法尼亚州南部某个地方爆发了

587
01:03:15,774 --> 01:03:18,906
亲爱的，我很害怕

588
01:03:18,941 --> 01:03:20,787
宾夕法尼亚州南部某个地方？

589
01:03:21,874 --> 01:03:24,395
1863年在宾夕法尼亚州南部

590
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,216
宾夕法尼亚州南部...
葛底斯堡！

591
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,530
（美国南北战争）

592
01:03:30,064 --> 01:03:32,204
葛底斯堡...葛底斯堡...

593
01:03:34,612 --> 01:03:37,991
（死伤人口）
马塞诸塞州19号...

594
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:42,280
（以团为单位）
马塞诸塞州19号...

595
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:45,470
百分之五十

596
01:03:50,473 --> 01:03:56,600
凯勒・邓比上校，7月3号死于战争

597
01:04:03,864 --> 01:04:05,629
1863年6月28号

598
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:20,440
亲爱的丽茜

599
01:04:20,475 --> 01:04:23,141
不要让邓比上校回到他的军队

600
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:25,758
- 你去哪里？ 
- 邮局

601
01:04:25,793 --> 01:04:28,363
- 你才刚出院！
- 我得给伊丽莎白寄封信

602
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:32,861
你还不能开车，我来开吧

603
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:57,765
- 前面什么建筑着火了？ 
- 那是邮局！

604
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:20,492
- 不要靠近火场 
- 不，我得进去！

605
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:24,194
不行！请退到栅栏外！

606
01:05:24,229 --> 01:05:26,371
不要过去！

607
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:33,887
留在这里，我一会就来，留着！

608
01:05:33,922 --> 01:05:37,839
不，斯科特，快回来！

609
01:07:29,706 --> 01:07:32,044
我回来后你会嫁给我吗？

610
01:07:33,066 --> 01:07:34,756
当然会的

611
01:08:19,054 --> 01:08:23,273
- 你肯定吗，弗洛丝？ 
- 我每天都看着

612
01:08:23,525 --> 01:08:25,695
那我给他的信呢？

613
01:08:25,774 --> 01:08:29,465
它们在隔间里消失了，和你说的一样

614
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,788
他承诺过回我信的

615
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,231
亲爱的丽茜

616
01:08:44,156 --> 01:08:47,492
里格先生过来了

617
01:08:47,527 --> 01:08:51,478
噢不，妈妈，现在我不能看他

618
01:08:51,513 --> 01:08:54,231
你父亲说了你会下楼的

619
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:56,862
就随便弄弄妆容吧

620
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,971
我肯定看到他你会精神焕发的

621
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:04,367
我确实和格兰特将军的军队呆过

622
01:09:04,402 --> 01:09:06,657
而西进运动将会...

623
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:11,924
- 这场战争会赢得迅速而彻底的
- 对的，先生

624
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:16,863
欢迎回来，威仕肯女士。我们都很想念你

625
01:09:17,215 --> 01:09:19,217
谢谢，里格先生

626
01:09:19,252 --> 01:09:22,821
请见谅，但我实在很劳累，旅途很长

627
01:09:23,256 --> 01:09:25,942
所以我想晚些再聊吧

628
01:09:27,948 --> 01:09:32,988
丽茜，里格先生会和我们吃晚餐

629
01:09:33,993 --> 01:09:35,512
玛姬？

630
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:39,926
- 有我的信吗？ 
- 有的，就这封？

631
01:09:39,961 --> 01:09:42,753
丽茜，你能考虑下客人的感受吗？

632
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:44,636
一会儿，爸爸

633
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,379
丽茜，写了什么？

634
01:09:49,971 --> 01:09:53,015
去拿我的包包，快点！

635
01:09:54,213 --> 01:09:57,027
爸爸，我得去一趟车站

636
01:09:57,062 --> 01:10:00,164
你不刚从车站回来吗？信里写了什么！

637
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:03,806
里格先生，你能载我一程吗？

638
01:10:03,841 --> 01:10:06,813
亲爱的，只要让你高兴就行

639
01:10:06,848 --> 01:10:09,325
但我不能违背你父亲的意愿...

640
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,182
那我就走去

641
01:10:13,657 --> 01:10:17,287
- 不准那样！ 
- 我不是小孩了

642
01:10:17,322 --> 01:10:19,171
你拦不了我

643
01:10:23,463 --> 01:10:27,106
就让她自个儿滚远去吧！

644
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:28,642
沃伦！你怎可以这样？

645
01:10:28,677 --> 01:10:31,997
弗洛丝，她究竟和你说了什么？

646
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,850
丽茜！

647
01:10:41,148 --> 01:10:42,679
丽茜！

648
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:16,305
不好意思

649
01:11:16,948 --> 01:11:19,279
有去葛底斯堡的火车吗？

650
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:22,732
不行啊，能去的最近的就是哈里斯堡了

651
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:25,862
再往下去的线路被叛军切掉了

652
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:29,248
- 一路你得小心啊
- 谢谢！

653
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:59,234
- 喂！ 
- 嗨，你在这里？

654
01:11:59,369 --> 01:12:00,957
是啊

655
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,337
看我拿了什么

656
01:12:05,526 --> 01:12:07,403
他们都答应了邀请

657
01:12:07,438 --> 01:12:09,418
客人们都已经来啦？

658
01:12:09,483 --> 01:12:11,803
婚礼在四星期后才开始呢

659
01:12:13,136 --> 01:12:16,301
- 别忘了，婚礼因为你住院推后了一个月
- 我知道

660
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:22,817
亲爱的，如果还是该延后的话...尽管...

661
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:24,361
不，不要那样

662
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:30,400
- 嗨
- 嗨，有进展吗？

663
01:12:31,662 --> 01:12:33,824
不，还没有

664
01:12:33,918 --> 01:12:36,248
我不知道丽茜能不能收到你的信

665
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,352
我也不知道，黛布拉在这

666
01:12:39,387 --> 01:12:44,899
噢，那你再找时间打过来吧

667
01:12:44,934 --> 01:12:46,657
好的，拜拜

668
01:12:50,654 --> 01:12:53,005
是妈妈，问候下而已

669
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:58,050
- 她说了什么？ 
- 只是担心我

670
01:12:59,258 --> 01:13:01,123
我也担心你啊

671
01:13:01,158 --> 01:13:03,591
我很好，就有那么难相信吗？

672
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:07,016
对不起

673
01:13:08,678 --> 01:13:10,185
对不起

674
01:13:15,476 --> 01:13:17,494
行，我们有哪些嘉宾？

675
01:13:17,529 --> 01:13:21,116
- 都排好了
- 好的

676
01:13:22,367 --> 01:13:25,814
快点啊，丽茜。明早就是3号了

677
01:13:30,232 --> 01:13:31,921
- 车夫！ 
- 女士？

678
01:13:31,956 --> 01:13:33,684
你能载我去葛底斯堡吗？

679
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,371
葛底斯堡？那里正在打仗啊

680
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,167
求求你了！我今晚就得到那里

681
01:13:40,586 --> 01:13:42,860
我把我能给你的都给你吧

682
01:13:43,341 --> 01:13:45,427
这可不是钱的问题，女士

683
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:49,180
好吧，我找别人

684
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:54,508
车夫，能送我去葛底斯堡吗？

685
01:13:54,843 --> 01:13:56,471
好吧，女士

686
01:13:57,318 --> 01:14:00,113
- 我载你去吧
- 太感谢了！

687
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,886
同志们，上啊！

688
01:15:53,068 --> 01:15:56,464
车夫，再快点行吗？

689
01:15:56,621 --> 01:15:59,491
已经最快了！

690
01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:36,451
丽茜...

691
01:17:09,454 --> 01:17:13,035
- 车夫，你能在这里等我吗？ 
- 我会的

692
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,387
你好，士兵

693
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:27,511
你知道马塞诸塞州19号部队吗？

694
01:17:27,546 --> 01:17:29,969
不再有了，小姐

695
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,863
叛军差点把它们全干掉了

696
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:35,313
那边有一些伤兵

697
01:18:17,942 --> 01:18:19,500
凯勒

698
01:18:25,044 --> 01:18:26,600
亲爱的

699
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,000
丽茜

700
01:18:31,561 --> 01:18:33,100
凯勒

701
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:38,516
我答应过要娶你

702
01:18:38,551 --> 01:18:41,567
没关系，我知道，我知道

703
01:18:52,405 --> 01:18:54,874
- 说点东西
- 说什么？

704
01:18:54,909 --> 01:18:56,730
你在河上念给我听的

705
01:18:59,053 --> 01:19:02,923
- 陌生的你...？  
- 是的

706
01:19:04,622 --> 01:19:09,158
陌生的你，我们不该相会

707
01:19:10,232 --> 01:19:15,364
但我又如此渴望和你在一起，梦着你

708
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:19,692
我会一直等待你，来轻轻地触摸我

709
01:19:20,981 --> 01:19:25,738
尽管这个世界上没有...

710
01:19:27,668 --> 01:19:30,117
但我们可以从现在开始...

711
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,692
你永远不会消失！

712
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:39,670
丽茜，亲爱的，你还好吧？

713
01:20:39,705 --> 01:20:41,818
不好，妈妈

714
01:20:47,237 --> 01:20:50,593
- 伊丽莎白，我有话...
- 爸，别！

715
01:21:28,805 --> 01:21:32,617
亲爱的斯科特，我得到你的通知

716
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,509
但一切都太晚了

717
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:36,923
噢，亲爱的！

718
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,004
我失去了邓比上校，一起逝去的

719
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:43,433
多像是另一个你！

720
01:21:43,468 --> 01:21:45,140
快写信给我

721
01:21:45,254 --> 01:21:48,197
只有你是我的全部了

722
01:21:59,174 --> 01:22:01,598
我...真的很抱歉

723
01:22:04,815 --> 01:22:09,413
我知道你不想听到这些，但为你好...

724
01:22:09,448 --> 01:22:13,789
妈妈，凯勒死了，丽茜的心都碎了

725
01:22:13,824 --> 01:22:15,577
而我更没法寄信给她！

726
01:22:18,745 --> 01:22:21,930
一个难以置信的奇迹发生在你身上

727
01:22:21,965 --> 01:22:25,790
你也不会忘记的，但是都已结束了

728
01:22:26,126 --> 01:22:30,204
是时候回到现实，想想你的未婚妻吧

729
01:22:36,834 --> 01:22:40,263
你还是想和她结婚的，对吧？

730
01:22:50,016 --> 01:22:51,500
嗨

731
01:22:52,128 --> 01:22:53,700
嗨

732
01:22:55,796 --> 01:22:57,500
你还好吧？

733
01:22:58,716 --> 01:23:00,800
我们需要聊聊

734
01:23:02,985 --> 01:23:04,784
聊什么？

735
01:23:06,187 --> 01:23:07,739
读这些信吧

736
01:23:11,499 --> 01:23:15,199
（献给凯勒）

737
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:09,290
丽茜小姐

738
01:24:09,653 --> 01:24:12,287
我在桌下找到这封信

739
01:24:14,437 --> 01:24:18,762
亲爱的丽茜：
不要停止写你的诗

740
01:24:19,612 --> 01:24:22,988
你说过我们注定感受不到对方的触感

741
01:24:23,032 --> 01:24:25,982
但你确确实实用你的诗句，触动了我

742
01:24:26,574 --> 01:24:28,733
吟唱吧，我的挚爱！

743
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:31,495
我会一直聆听着你

744
01:24:49,062 --> 01:24:50,986
我当然会的

745
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:12,790
这些是什么？

746
01:25:14,092 --> 01:25:16,359
伊丽莎白・威仕肯写的信

747
01:25:17,148 --> 01:25:19,051
她...

748
01:25:20,994 --> 01:25:23,039
一直和我通信

749
01:25:24,895 --> 01:25:28,954
她的信在隔间里消失了，然后...

750
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:34,357
我就收到了，并回给她

751
01:25:44,057 --> 01:25:46,541
这...

752
01:25:49,255 --> 01:25:53,948
真是荒唐透顶！

753
01:25:55,201 --> 01:25:57,270
甚至是病态的！

754
01:25:58,513 --> 01:26:00,704
这到底是什么？你...你在干嘛？！

755
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:06,017
- 我准备和你说...
- 说什么？

756
01:26:13,695 --> 01:26:15,747
我爱上她了

757
01:26:27,665 --> 01:26:29,873
伊丽莎白・威仕肯？！

758
01:26:32,843 --> 01:26:35,253
我知道这很...

759
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:38,416
我不知道你到底有什么毛病

760
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:42,292
- 但这真的很吓人！
- 黛布拉，听我说

761
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:45,231
什么？

762
01:27:11,034 --> 01:27:12,663
打开它吧

763
01:27:34,465 --> 01:27:41,241
挚爱的，凯勒不在了，但我还有你，是吗？

764
01:27:41,519 --> 01:27:46,668
我终于知道，原来你和他就是一个人

765
01:27:47,792 --> 01:27:50,684
而在墓前

766
01:27:50,728 --> 01:27:54,613
你给了我某些我已经失去的

767
01:27:54,764 --> 01:27:59,392
尽管你听不到我的声音

768
01:27:59,673 --> 01:28:02,689
但我仍给你低声唱这些诗歌

769
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:09,347
这简直是疯了！

770
01:28:19,809 --> 01:28:21,825
这怎么可能？

771
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:25,750
我也不知道，但是千真万确！

772
01:28:26,243 --> 01:28:29,620
- 这不可能！不可能！ 
- 听我说

773
01:28:30,508 --> 01:28:32,777
但这真的就发生了

774
01:28:33,585 --> 01:28:35,262
我也不清楚

775
01:28:35,297 --> 01:28:38,414
很抱歉，我瞒着你，但这是真的

776
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:40,341
是真的

777
01:28:40,898 --> 01:28:43,299
我对伊丽莎白的爱

778
01:28:43,334 --> 01:28:46,980
对她的感受，都是真的

779
01:29:00,288 --> 01:29:01,830
黛布拉

780
01:29:03,653 --> 01:29:08,038
你需要一个更爱你的人

781
01:29:09,194 --> 01:29:11,351
全心全意爱你的人

782
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:17,406
我还是尽量去理解这一切

783
01:29:18,883 --> 01:29:21,161
但我也知道

784
01:29:22,952 --> 01:29:25,623
如果你对我没什么感觉

785
01:29:27,735 --> 01:29:30,112
那我们就不应该在一起

786
01:29:42,089 --> 01:29:47,885
我不会忘记，时光是怎么捉弄我的

787
01:29:48,088 --> 01:29:54,842
我也永远不会忘记，
我的心像圣诞树一样被点亮过...

788
01:29:55,186 --> 01:29:59,262
无论我将会去往天堂，还是地狱

789
01:29:59,297 --> 01:30:02,711
我最终都会被死神带走

790
01:30:02,746 --> 01:30:09,634
但，我的挚爱，梦里的挚爱，我永世不忘...

791
01:30:25,768 --> 01:30:27,336
她什么时候过身了？

792
01:30:28,037 --> 01:30:29,932
周二

793
01:30:30,022 --> 01:30:33,154
我很抱歉...我能进去吗？

794
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:47,082
- 你现在能做什么？ 
- 她把房子留给了我

795
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,580
所以我就住在这里了

796
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:53,907
介意我看看那房间最后一眼吗？

797
01:30:54,176 --> 01:30:56,823
- 去吧
- 谢谢

798
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,500
丽茜？

799
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,500
你在这里吗？

800
01:31:46,477 --> 01:31:48,008
丽茜...

801
01:32:29,057 --> 01:32:31,027
斯科特...

802
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:34,799
我好想念你！

803
01:32:41,116 --> 01:32:43,200
你还好吧，先生？

804
01:32:45,113 --> 01:32:46,837
没...没事

01:32:48,948 --> 01:32:51,692
克莱思把这些留给了你

806
01:32:57,985 --> 01:33:01,839
她小时候在阁楼上找到的

807
01:33:01,874 --> 01:33:08,056
一些信，日记，散文还有很多很多的诗

808
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,890
很有趣吧

809
01:33:17,063 --> 01:33:21,917
克莱思发誓她小时候从来没看过这些诗

810
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:27,615
我猜她肯定是老了健忘了

（丽茜的诗）

812
01:33:38,038 --> 01:33:42,709
亲爱的威仕肯小姐：
你是威洛比女校里我最爱的老师

813
01:33:42,744 --> 01:33:44,925
太好了她后来当了老师

814
01:33:45,867 --> 01:33:47,401
威仕肯小姐...

815
01:33:47,436 --> 01:33:50,297
威仕肯小姐...
威仕肯小姐...

816
01:33:50,974 --> 01:33:53,965
最后她还是没有嫁给那位里格“大人”

817
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,266
- 谁啊？
- 没事，无关紧要

818
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:16,980
丽茜...

819
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:29,062
那是你！

820
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:31,783
你...怎么会去到她的信里？！

821
01:34:34,937 --> 01:34:37,554
我即是解释了

822
01:34:38,171 --> 01:34:40,367
你也不会相信的

我永世不忘...

826
01:36:27,137 --> 01:36:29,082
喔，你什么来头啊？

827
01:36:30,182 --> 01:36:32,510
快过来！

828
01:36:37,728 --> 01:36:40,091
不要随便扑到陌生人身上

829
01:36:40,181 --> 01:36:42,432
没关系的

830
01:36:42,467 --> 01:36:45,169
- 很抱歉
- 没事

831
01:36:47,399 --> 01:36:48,948
别介意

832
01:36:52,683 --> 01:36:57,302
他肯定很喜欢你，不然也不会扑到你身上

833
01:37:01,472 --> 01:37:03,350
怎么啦？

834
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:09,507
额，没...没有。狗狗很可爱

835
01:37:11,976 --> 01:37:15,643
再次道歉了，实在没有冒犯你的意思

836
01:37:17,176 --> 01:37:18,682
拜

837
01:37:23,648 --> 01:37:25,337
乖

838
01:37:28,878 --> 01:37:31,265
不好意思

839
01:37:32,781 --> 01:37:36,118
你知道咖啡厅在哪里吗？

840
01:37:36,172 --> 01:37:41,832
我知道，走3个街区有一个很好的咖啡厅

841
01:37:41,867 --> 01:37:43,550
能带我去吗？

842
01:37:43,585 --> 01:37:45,660
- 嗯，我请你喝杯吧
- 不用了

843
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:47,741
至少我乐意啊

844
01:37:48,971 --> 01:37:52,079
- 好吧，你说的哦
- 行啦

845
01:38:11,758 --> 01:38:15,656
- 我叫斯科特
- 叫我贝丝，很高兴认识你

- Take a look?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:57,170
Ah, hello there, folks, I'm Jacob Campbell.

6
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,200
She's a beauty, isn't she?

7
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:04,100
- Can I try it on?
- No, I'm afraid it's not for sale.

8

Belonged to my grandmother.

9
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,200
Good way to get folks into the shop, though.

10
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:12,250
Especially pretty young ladies
draggin' in their fellas, hum?

11
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:15,400
Very clever.

12
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:18,590
- There're more gowns over here.
- Oh, great.

13
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:42,660
- Are you a Civil War buff?
- A bit, yes.

14
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:46,100
- Do you mind if I take a look back here?
- Oh, no, help yourself.

15
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm a bit of a restorer myself.

16
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,301
Ah...

17
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:56,500
I got these in just the other day.

18
00:01:56,501 --> 00:01:58,500
- Nice. - Very old.
- They're all right.

19
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:16,400
- Beautiful.
- That desk belonged to a Union general.

20
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:17,300
Really?

21
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:21,200
Deb, come take a look at this.

22
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:28,200
- Great, huh?
- It's kinda fallin' apart.

23
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,060
I need a desk.

24
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:36,500
- How much will you take for it?
- Well, I was plannin' on restoring it myself...

25
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:39,600
but, if you really want it...800?

26
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,000
- Too much, let's go.
- Will you take 600?

27
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:46,550
This is 19th century;
800's the best I can do.

28
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,200
I can't pay 800.

29
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,950
This is the first time I've ever
seen you do an impulse buy.

30
00:03:10,951 --> 00:03:12,880
I thought you wanted me
to be more spontaneous.

31
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,990
Next time be spontaneous over
something a little less... heavy.

32
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:20,100
You know?  You're pretty
strong...for a girl.

33
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,500
It must be from throwing
all those manuscripts on the reject pile.

34
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,560
It must be.  Look at that! Huh?

35
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,400
Wait till ya see when I get a little
waxy-polish on this little polish...

36
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:39,320
I should go.
Get out.

37
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:40,440
All right.

38
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,300

You, too.

<i>Dearest, 'tis after midnight...

40
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:24,280
<i>and I am at last free to speak to you.

41
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:27,250
<i>Mother, father and Flossy
have grown accustomed

42
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:30,240
<i>to my late night scribbling,
and have bid me goodnight.

43
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:35,500
<i>In my 29 years I have been
called upon by several gentlemen.

44
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:39,300
<i>But you are the one who occupies my thoughts.

45
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:43,000
<i>Even though you are not real,
you are more dear to me...

46
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:47,050
<i>than the man who has asked
just this night for my hand in marriage.

47
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:50,300
<i>I do not love him.

48
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:53,350
<i>To please father I have tried.

49
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,690
<i>And...sadly, I know I have a duty to obey

50
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:59,220
<i>and must soon accept.

51
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:03,500
<i>But I ache for a love that burns like fire,

52
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:06,200
<i>and moonlight.

53
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:09,330
<i>I speak with you in my mind and heart.

54
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,670
<i>If you only existed outside of them...

55
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:16,870
<i>Goodnight, Sweetheart.
Dream of me.

56
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,830
Dear, Lady:

57
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:31,800
I have just read your letter

58
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:38,200
in the secret compartment of your desk,

59
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:44,700
and wish there were some way...

60
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:52,520
<i>I know you feel an obligation to your father

61
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:54,900
<i>but you have to obey your heart.

62
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,660
<i>It's a mistake to marry someone you don't love.

63
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:01,500
<i>Don't despair; the man of your dreams

64
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:04,100
<i>may be out there in the mist right now,

65
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,900
<i>just a heartbeat away.

66
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:10,600
<i>Who knows? Perhaps I'm the one you seek.

67
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,350
<i>But, unfortunately, My Dear,

68
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,350
<i>I've already given my heart...
to Scarlett O'Hara.

69
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:19,800
<i>Yours always, Rhett Butler.

70
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,900
I can see; when are you going to finish?

71
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,530
Stop worrying, Lester.
It's almost done.

72
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:47,310
I can see this game is gonna
kill us at Christmastime.

73
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:49,800
- What kind of attitude is that?
- It'll be ready.

74
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:53,520
It better be. Meanwhile
we'll kill 'em in the bike race.

We're happy for them, aren't we?

- No way!
- I've had it!

86

to intrude, I just...

91
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:39,950
Off of my property, now!

92
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:42,080
Actually, I'm just interested in
somebody who used to live here.

93

- Grazie.
- Grazie

102
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:23,800
You've outdone yourself this time,
"mamma mia".

103
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:27,320
Before a trip one should
immerse oneself in the culture.

104
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,770
You have certainly done that.

105
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:32,690
And it's no more Beatriz,
I've got everyone calling me "Beatrice".

106
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,200
Beatri...May I stick with "Mom", please?

107
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:44,550
You know, with all the money
going into your wedding,

108
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:47,640
you and Deborah could take
a trip around the world.

109
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,600
- I don't want to take a trip around the world.
- See, that's your problem,

110
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:54,400
you get too stuck, Scotty.
Trapped in your own little universe.

111
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:00,120
Oh, really! Actually you are talking to a man who

112
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:03,220
just answered a 134 year old love letter.

113
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:08,250
Mi scusi?
Yeah, I found it in this antique desk I bought.

114
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:10,950
"I dream of you...

115
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:15,690
I speak only in my mind and heart...
if only you existed."

116
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:21,500
- You memorized it.
- There was something so...sad about it.

117
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:25,690
So, I just answered it.

118
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,850
And did you mail it?

119
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:32,670
Yes, I did, but you know
I don't trust the Post Office

120
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:34,170
so I sent it Pony Express.

121
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,200
Don't get smart!

122
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:39,300
H. G. Wells believed in time travel.

123
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:42,510
And Einstein thought that time
was just another dimension.

124
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:44,700
You know, some people believe

125
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:47,000
that souls can travel through time.

126
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,700
Can we travel through silence?

127
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:53,200
- Do you have an address?
- No! See! Naw, I knew it.

128
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:55,090
I shouldn't have told you.
You're gonna get carried away.

129
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:02,000
Opening my mail now.

130
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:04,150
Your mail?

131
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:08,800
Well, this is dated 1863...
it took a little time to get here

132
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:12,050
- Where did you get this?
- From the desk.

133
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,450
From a secret compartment.

134
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,900
You're kidding me!  Where?

135
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:20,101
Deb, I just walked in, I don't
feel like taking the desk apart.

136
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,110
Just asked.

137
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:24,069
Here.

138
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:30,600
In the drawer, there's a
little switch back here, and

139
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,840
That is so cool.

140
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:38,940
Poor thing.

141
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:43,800
Pouring her heart after nobody,
some fantasy guy.

142
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,890
Then she stuck it and married some
loser her father picked out for her.

143
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:49,800
Maybe she didn't marry him.

144
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:53,980
We're talking about the 1860's;
she married him.

145
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm going to go check on dinner.

146
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:09,050
First class postage from Boston
to Willoughby in 1863 was one cent.

147
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,500
Careful with that, it wasn't cheap.

148
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:17,550
A bottle of ink. I got the Waterman people
to duplicate the formula they used back then.

149
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,600
Hold it! Hold it!

150
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:22,800
It's gotta be perfect or we don't have
a prayer of crossing the barrier.

151
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:25,000
Mother, stop!

152
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:30,290
Let's just say I bought into this madness
for a few milliseconds, which, of course, I don't

153
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:34,650
where would you suggest that I mail
this painstakingly authentic letter?

154
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:38,460
Manhasset Postal Substation on the north side...

155
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:45,100
built:1857, it's the only
pre-Civil War Post Office in existence.

156
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:48,190
It's open 24 hours for deposit.

157
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:53,300
Go at night. I'm not sure why
but it seems more appropriate.

158
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:54,700
Halt!

159
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:59,950
I really need to know something:
Do you think this is going to work?

160
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:03,830
Wouldn't it be awesome if it did?

161
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:18,500
<i>Even though you are not real,
you are more dear to me

162
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:22,100
<i>than the man who just this night
has asked for my hand in marriage.

163
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,000
<i>I do not love him.

164
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:28,400
<i>To please Father I have tried.

165
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:31,950
<i>Sadly, I know I have the duty to obey

166
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,400
<i>and must soon accept.

167
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:38,950
<i>But I ache for a love that burns like fire

168
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:40,690
<i>and moonlight.

169
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,250
<i>I speak with you in
my mind and heart

170
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:47,350
<i>If you only existed outside of them...

171
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,700
<i>Goodnight, Sweetheart.

172
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:53,700
<i>Dream of me.

173
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:12,510
<i>Dear, Lady, I've just read the letter

174
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,250
<i>from the secret compartment of your desk.

175
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,900
<i>...which means, may be out there in
the mist right now, just a heartbeat away.

176
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:21,500
<i>Who knows? Perhaps I'm the one you seek.

177
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:31,650
<i>A friend.

178
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,200
Funny Farm, here I come!

179
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,300
- Good day to you, Mr. Potts.
- And to you, Maggie.

180
00:19:58,691 --> 00:19:59,740
Elizabeth.

181
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:02,950
Elizabeth!

182
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,340
Flossy, have you seen your sister?

183
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,950
She's in the garden, Pap?.

184
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:29,000
- Miss Whitcomb?
- Mr. Reagle.

185
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:32,950
I found myself in the vicinity...
thought I'd take the liberty of stopping by.

186
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:35,550
How nice.

187
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:42,090
It's quite lovely, isn't it?
It's very lovely.

188
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:49,200
At midnight it should be in full bloom,

189
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:52,800
and then, come morning, it should be gone.

190
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:57,200
I'm trying to write a poem about her.

191
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:02,050
I do hope you read it to
me once it's completed.

192
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:06,470
I find your verses most...charming.

193
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:11,050
Thank you.

194
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:21,890
It looks like it'll be a lovely evening.

195
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,820
I have had some training.

196
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:33,600
I was wondering Miss Whitcomb...Lizzie.

197
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:34,960
Yes, Mr. Reagle?

198
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:39,130
I was wondering if you've had
an opportunity to consider the

199
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,530
the suggestion I made to you
during our previous visit.

200
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:47,150
Oh, yes, well, I'm still considering it.

201
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:50,900
Well...glad to hear that.

202
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:36,960
I...I fell one of my headaches coming on,
so I'm going to say goodnight.

203
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:40,460
Father, Mother, Floss

204
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:45,950
Oh...Lizzie...I forgot.

205
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,900
There's a letter for you.

206
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:53,600
Thank you, Mother.

207
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,800
Do feel better, Dear.

208
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:35,610
- Lizzie?
- Yes, Father?

209
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:47,700
Your mother and I wonder if
there's anything you wish to tell us.

210
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:50,700
No, Father.

211
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:55,650
I spoke at some length
earlier with Everett Reagle.

212
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:59,000
He's given me to believe that the
two of you have come to an understanding.

213
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,700
I have only agreed to what you might call

214
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:06,650
a prelude to an understanding.

215
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:11,310
I see.
And might this "prelude"...

216
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,350
lead eventually to an actual understanding?

217
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,400
An engagement?

218
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,200
And to a marriage?

219
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:28,900
Father, I don't love him.

220
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:33,850
You're 29 years old, Lizzie.

221
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:38,330
Father, I know you want
what you think is best for me.

222
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:42,610
And I know what is expected of me.

223
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:46,800
It's not merely our expectations,
it's common sense.

224
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:51,200
A woman of your years, however
comfortable her situation,

225
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:54,160
may scarcely afford to be reluctant

226
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:56,460
when a suitable match presents itself.

227
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:09,470
- Another headache?
- Yes, Father.

228
00:25:10,171 --> 00:25:15,690
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, I just, I think I just need some sleep.

229
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:42,110
Who are you?

230
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:47,000
Who are you?

231
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:32,500
<i>Sir!  I received your astonishing letter today,

232
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:34,650
<i>and am amazed by your audacity.

233
00:27:35,441 --> 00:27:36,700
<i>Who are you?

234
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:40,670
<i>And how could you know there was
something in my secret place to be stolen?

235
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:45,000
<i>I wonder if I place the second letter

236
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:47,200
<i> in the same place as the first,

237
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:50,320
<i>am I in the tour for some feverish dream.

238
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:52,900
<i>Or will you violate my privacy again?

239
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:56,650
<i>In mystification,
Elizabeth Whitcomb.

240
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:35,600
<i>Dear Elizabeth:

241
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:40,200
<i>I'm sure you'll find this as
impossible to believe, as I do.

242
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:44,690
<i>My name is Scott Corrigan.
I live in Boston,

243
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:47,200
<i>but not the Boston you know.

244
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,690
<i>While I write these words at my desk,

245
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:55,000
<i>or rather, your desk, because I now
own the desk that sits in your bedroom,

246
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:58,060
<i>I try to imagine how all
of this could have happened.

247
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:02,660
<i>The only explanation I can come up with is,

248
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:06,090
<i>that, for some reason,
the connection between us is so strong

249
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:09,300
<i>that we're able to talk to each other
across the chasm of time.

250
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,450
<i>If I haven't utterly terrified you,

251
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,450
<i>please sit at OUR desk and write again soon.

252
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,400
<i>Yours, Scott Corrigan.

253
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:21,300
Lizzie.

254
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:24,450
- Good heavens! What's the matter?
- Nothing!

255
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:31,350
You startled me.
I was somewhere else.

256
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:35,060
- Because of something in the letter?
- What letter?

257
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:38,270
The letter you're trying to hide from me.

258
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,809
Oh.

259
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:42,800
That letter.

260
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:48,350
No, no, no, it's just another
rejection from the publisher.

261
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:51,280
Oh, Lizzie, I'm sorry.

262
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:57,900
Your verses are...
transcendental.

263
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,100
If only Mr. Ralph W. Emerson,

264
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:07,000
of the New England Literary Journal,
felt the same way.

265
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,600
I still don't understand why...

266
00:30:10,971 --> 00:30:13,850
you won't submit them to
Mr. Reagle for his magazine.

267
00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:20,650
I have submitted them to Mr. Reagle.
I'm still awaiting a response.

268
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:25,180
I'm sure someone will print your verses.

269
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,400
You just have to be patient.

270
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:02,390
<i>Dear, Mr. Corrigan:

271
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:06,300
<i>I have decided to accept
that the laws of nature

272
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:08,000
<i>as they apply to you and me

273
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:12,270
<i>have been, for whatever reason,
temporarily suspended.

274
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:20,000
Okay! That was easy.

275
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:22,600
- How about flatware?
- Yes, yes, flatware.

276
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:29,610
<i>You have the advantage over me
in that you know my most deepest secrets.,

277
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:32,000
<i>while I know none of yours.

278
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:35,690
<i>Tell me who you are and
how you live in your time

279
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:37,950
<i>so many years in the future.

280
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:44,200
- How's this?
- It's too...Sci-Fi.

281
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:46,200
<i>The most important of all,

282
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,800
<i>tell me whether this conjunction between us

283
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:51,400
<i>which I confess, I feel as strongly as you,

284
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:55,350
<i>means that you, too, yearn
for a deep and passionate love.

285
00:31:55,351 --> 00:31:57,200
How about this?

286
00:31:57,201 --> 00:32:00,200
<i>...or is there already someone you love.

287
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:05,150
<i>Write soon, before the laws
of nature re-assert themselves.

288
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:07,250
Maybe we should just eat with our hands.

289
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,830
No, no, no. I’m sorry.

290
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:15,330
<i>Dear, Lizzie, you have asked
some crucial questions.

291
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,990
- Have I?
- M’um?

292
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:21,700
Have I added the nutmeg?

293
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:24,400
Nutmeg, in pound cake?

294
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,700
What a peculiar recipe.

295
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:30,170
Cinnamon.  I meant have I added cinnamon.

296
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,580
<i>Do I yearn for love?
Yes, of course.

297
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:40,380
<i>Am I in love now.
I am engaged to be married, and...

298
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:42,260
<i>yes, I believe I'm in love.

299
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:44,320
"I believe".

300
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:46,100
What, M'um?

301
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:51,300
I believe this is going to be a delicious cake.
Don't you, Maggie?

302
00:32:53,131 --> 00:32:55,300
If you'll excuse me, M’um,
I'll see to the dusting room.

303
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:02,000
<i>A friend once said that when you're in love,

304
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:05,200
<i>you light up like a Christmas tree
when your lover enters the room.

305
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,470
<i>I don't think I ever felt that way,

306
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:12,900
<i>at least not until last night,
when I found your second letter.

307
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:19,400
- And how many does this make?
- Three, counting the first one.

308
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:24,400
And you're sure nobody is...?

309
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:26,900
playing some kind of bizarre joke? Impossible.

310
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:29,350
No!  This is impossible.

311
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:31,900
Mother, you're the one that talked
me into this insanity in the first place.

312
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:34,140
But I never dreamed...

313
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:39,650
- What in the world does Debra think about all this?
- I didn't tell her.

314
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:42,900
You didn't tell her?!?

315
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:48,550
- It's incredible, isn't it?
- I'll tell you what's incredible:

316
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,200
My son, who is engaged to
be married, is having an affair

317
00:33:52,201 --> 00:33:54,800
with a woman who's been dead
for over a hundred years.

318
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,500
Mom, we write letters.

319
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,900
Letters that you keep secret from you fiancé.

320
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,900
And what about Elizabeth Whitcomb?

321
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:06,050
Scotty, you don't have the right to get
mixed up in a life that's already been lived.

322
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:07,800
If she doesn't love the guy,
she shouldn't marry him.

323
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:10,950
We should go.
Rome awaits you.

324
00:34:12,031 --> 00:34:14,550
I can't believe we're
having this conversation.

325
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:18,130
- This woman doesn't exist!
- Then who wrote this?

326
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:24,930
In this world, in the world you
and I live in, she does not exist.

327
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:29,890
Then why do I feel...
the way I feel?

328
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:33,650
And what way is that?

329
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:41,230
<i>My Dear Lizzie:
I can't begin to tell you

330
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:43,680
<i>how wonderful I feel
as I read your letters.

331
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:47,100
<i>I only wish I could hold you in my arms.

332
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:11,690
- Mr. Potts, could you look once more please?
- Yes, Miss Lizzie.

333
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:19,420
I'm sorry, there's...there's nothing.

334
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:42,260
<i>Dearest: Another week gone
by and still no letter.

335
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,700
<i>Are you worried that since you
told me of your engagement

336
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:47,500
<i>I would think you a scoundrel

337
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:49,800
<i>for professing tender feelings for me?

338
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:53,050
I'm worried about those
"tender feelings" in the first place.

339
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:57,500
<i>I'm not so innocent as you
might think, Mr. Corrigan.

340
00:35:57,501 --> 00:36:00,300
<i>I have danced the waltz with many men.

341
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:03,000
<i>And, I'm an avid reader
of the modern novel.

342
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:07,100
<i>So, I  am au courant on
the subject of forbidden passion.

343
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:12,900
I'm afraid this waltz is going to have
to be mine and Debra's, Miss Whitcomb.

344
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:18,300
<i>The hard truth is, we are
doomed to be chaste...

345
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:24,300
<i>to never touch each other,
hear each other, see each other.

346
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:28,980
<i>So, what harm can there be
to write to each other?

347
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:40,190
<i>If you are still there,
write to me quickly and tell me

348
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:45,391
<i>what it means to
"Light up like a Christmas Tree".

349
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:19,900
- Good Morning.
- You again.

350
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:23,510
I'm really sorry to bother you, I'm just
trying to find out about the Whitcombs.

351
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:25,000
Why?

352
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:30,900
Well, I bought a desk that
used to belong to one of them,

353
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,700
and I just became interested
in the family.

354
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:35,700
Thought I'd write a book about 'em.

355
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:39,500
A book!
They just regular folk.

356
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,700
You know who they were?

357
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:45,130
Clarice's grandma was a Whitcomb.

358
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:48,360
- Clarice?
- The lady I take care of.

359
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:51,600
You mean there's a Whitcomb
living in here right now?

360
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:54,500
That's right.  I've had 50 years

361
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:57,550
of her temper, and believe me,
it's worse than mine.

362
00:37:58,691 --> 00:38:01,500
I'd really love to talk to her,
would that be possible?

363
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:02,800
She's sleeping.

364
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:06,200
I know this is an intrusion, but...

365
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,170
Would you mind if I
just took a peek inside?

366
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:12,700
Why would I let you do that?

367
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:15,540
I'll paint the house.

368
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:19,170
This side, anyway.

369
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:26,040
If you turn out to be one of them no-good
lawyers for Clarice's no-good cousins...

370
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:28,200
I'll take a rolling pin to you.

371
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:29,500
Yes, Ma'am.

372
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:56,200
- Okay, Mister, you've had your peek.
- Just a minute, please.

373
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:01,000
Mae, who is that you're
talkin' to down there?

374
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:02,700
Now you've done it!

375
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:07,400
Clarice.

376
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:13,400
Who are you?

377
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:18,300
This fellow's writin' a book...
about the Whitcombs.

378
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:20,100
He wanted to meet you.

379
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:22,700
How do you do, Ma'am,
my name is Scott.

380
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:26,240
- You're a fool, Mae, he's a lawyer.
- No Ma'am, I'm not a lawyer.

381
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:29,590
I told the whole lot of you,
I'm not leavin' this house,

382
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,850
until the good Lord takes me.

383
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:36,200
I'm just trying to find some
information about Elizabeth Whitcomb.

384
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:37,950
Liars, all of you!
Get out!

385
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:39,890
I warned ya.

386
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:45,320
How do you know about Lizzie?

387
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:52,200
I found a letter that she wrote,
in an old desk, probably from here.

388
00:39:54,301 --> 00:39:59,300
Grandma Flossy told me
stories about my Aunt Elizabeth.

389
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:02,300
She was very beautiful.

390
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,820
I never knew her.

391
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:07,640
Can you tell me if she was ever married?

392
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:13,250
I need to sleep now.

393
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:19,260
I need to know if she was ever married.
Ma'am?

394
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:31,150
You coming?

395
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:11,560
<i>Dear Lizzie: Ben Franklin named
it electricity

396
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:14,160
<i>and we now use it
to power machines,

397
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:17,070
<i>to light our homes,
and our Christmas trees.

398
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,410
Good morning, Miss Lizzie.

399
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:23,250
Thank you.

400
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:26,290
<i>To light up like a Christmas tree

401
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:30,600
<i>means to glow with pleasure,
and I am glowing...right now.

402
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:36,050
<i>I went to your house on
Mill Plain Road...yes, it's still there.

403
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:40,500
<i>A very old woman, your sister
Flossy's granddaughter lives in it.

404
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:43,020
<i>And I actually stood in your bedroom.

405
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:49,590
<i>But what I will never forget is
how I suddenly felt your presence

406
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:53,590
<i>on the stairs. Almost as if
you touched my cheek.

407
00:42:54,941 --> 00:42:58,450
<i>It's crazy, but I felt as
if I could touch you, too.

408
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:03,940
<i>Lizzie, to ignore what's happened
would be to deny a miracle.

409
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:08,010
<i>Forgive my silence,
it won't happen again.

410
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:12,110
<i>I promise, all my love, Scotty.

411
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:22,600
<i>Darling Scotty, I beg you
please keep your promise.

412
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:27,400
<i>Never stop writing again,
or I fear I shall stop breathing,

413
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:30,290
<i>because my breath stop now

414
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:34,090
<i>at the thought of you in
my house, in this very room.

415
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:37,560
<i>Amazing as it seems,
I felt it, too,

416
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:40,300
<i>in the very same place
on the stairs.

417
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:43,850
<i>A touch like a sweet promise.

418
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:47,910
<i>I know that we are tempting fate,
and in reality

419
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:51,000
<i>there is your time,
and my time.

420
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:57,000
<i>We shall live and love across time.

421
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:58,900
It's a deal.

422
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:04,500
<i>I dream of you,
but I can't see your face.

423
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,900
<i>Please, send me a picture.

424
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:10,100
Remember, you have to be still,
don't move.

425
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:20,220
<i>I want you to look as if you
are about to walk into my arms.

426
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:35,590
- Hey! - How are you?
- I'm good. - Good

427
00:44:35,691 --> 00:44:38,100
- How are you?
- Good, good, good.

428
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:40,400
You look so happy,
what happened?

429
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:43,210
...you're here!

430
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:45,100
Good answer.

431
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:47,900
Who's that?

432
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:50,650
That is Elizabeth Whitcomb.

433
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,450
- The one who wrote the letter?
- Yeah.

434
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:56,600
Well, where d'you get it?

435
00:44:56,601 --> 00:44:59,400
Actually, I got it from someone
who lives in her old house.

436
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:02,640
- You went to her house?
- Yeah.

437
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:05,000
- Why?
- Just curious.

438
00:45:07,461 --> 00:45:09,100
Well, how did d'you even find it?

439
00:45:09,101 --> 00:45:12,690
I got some info from that antique guy. Stopped by
on the way back from practice. It's in Willoughby.

440
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:15,791
- Oh.
- Yeah.

441
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:18,892
Well...

442
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:21,300
I guess I should be grateful that

443
00:45:22,101 --> 00:45:23,800
the other woman's a dead one.

444
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:30,640
This parcel of land is for sale.

445
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:33,240
I know you love nature, Lizzie,

446
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:37,260
and that is uppermost in my mind
as I survey the region for a

447
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:40,340
for a possible future home...together.

448
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:42,200
I appreciate that.

449
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,950
- I was wondering, Mr. Reagle...
- Um-huh.

450
00:45:46,851 --> 00:45:51,051
...if you'd had a chance to peruse
the verses I gave you a month ago.

451
00:45:51,101 --> 00:45:53,100
Oh! Yes, yes.
I've read them, yes.

452
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:54,600
Well?

453
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:57,701
They're very interesting.

454
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,300
Very passionate.

455
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,900
Perhaps not quite as attentive as
they might be to the mechanics of the art.

456
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:09,500
The odd meters...broken rhymes.

457
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:13,100
You have aptitude;
you need guidance.

458
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:17,650
I hope in the future you will
allow me to provide it...

459
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,250
...in all things.

460
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:25,150
<i>I have decided to cease writing poetry.

461
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:28,850
<i>I know "His Reagle Highness"
is too conventional

462
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:30,380
<i>to take me seriously.

463
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:33,400
<i>until my work has been validated by others.

464
00:46:33,801 --> 00:46:38,060
<i>But the truth is, My Darling,
there are no others.

465
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:43,290
<i>I sing, but nobody listens...except you.

466
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,700
<i>So I offer you the last poem
I shall ever write.

467
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:55,100
- So, you and Deb doin' the marriage thing, huh?
- Yeah.

468
00:46:55,701 --> 00:46:58,200
Yes, we're doin' the marriage thing.

469
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:02,640
- It's a great book.
- Thanks.

470
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:07,900
- Listen, Danny, can I ask you a favor?
Do you mind?

471
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:11,500
- Sure.
- Would you mind...sorry,

472
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,199
would you mind taking a look at a poem
and tell me what you think of it?

473
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:18,150
You want me to evaluate
your poem right here, right now?

474
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:20,800
It's not mine, it's a friends.
It's short. Do you mind?

475
00:47:22,691 --> 00:47:25,000
- All right.
- Thank you.

476
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:40,240
"Stanger, not on this earth shall we meet

477
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:45,160
though surely I have lived a
life with you, I would wed etern..."

478
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,000
Tell him not to give up his day job.

479
00:47:49,821 --> 00:47:50,950
What's a matter with it?

480
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:55,160
Besides being old fashioned,
sentimental and derivative?

481
00:47:55,161 --> 00:47:58,350
You mean as opposed to the pretentious drivel
that gets published these days?

482
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:01,900
- What is your problem?
- I didn't have one until about 10 seconds ago.

483
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:04,250
- Oh, really, and what would that be?
- Ah...you!

484
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:06,650
- Really? - Yeah.
- Well, I seem to be...

485
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:08,399
What's going on?

486
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:11,070
I insulted his friend's poetry.

487
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:16,900
What's he talking about?
What friend?

488
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:19,000
Nothing. Nobody.

489
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:22,300
Well, it had to be somebody if you
almost came to blows over it.

490
00:48:23,261 --> 00:48:27,100
It's Elizabeth Whitcomb's.
I found it in another drawer in the desk.

491
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:29,370
I just felt it might have
some historical significance.

492
00:48:30,691 --> 00:48:32,500
Well, it has significance all right.

493
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:47,300
Debra.

494
00:48:48,381 --> 00:48:51,050
- What's goin' on, Scotty?
- Nothing. Nothing's going on.

495
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:57,100
First you don't tell me about finding her letter.

496
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,700
And then you go tracking down
Elizabeth Whitcomb's house,

497
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:01,550
and you don't tell me about
that either, and then you

498
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:03,849
don't tell me about getting
her picture or about finding her poem.

499
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:05,850
- Honey, you're blowing this out of proportion.
- No! Don't! You're putting

500
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:08,450
more energy into Elizabeth Whitcomb
than you are into our wedding plans.

501
00:49:08,451 --> 00:49:10,450
- It's not true!
- I want to know why, I mean

502
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:13,550
- are you that freaked-out about getting married?
Is that what this is?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

503
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,900
Because if you don't want to do this,
Scotty, you just say the word.

504
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:19,240
Be honest and tell me, because we'll call it off.

505
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:22,100
I do...I don't want to call it off,  okay?

506
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:24,460
I'm sorry, okay?

507
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:27,900
It's my fault, it means nothing, okay?

508
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:35,500
<i>Dear Lizzie, please don't
stop writing your poetry.

509
00:49:35,901 --> 00:49:40,500
<i>First of all, this Reagle guy sounds like he wouldn't
know a good poem if it smacked him in the face.

510
00:49:42,351 --> 00:49:44,600
<i>You say you sing but nobody listens?

511
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:50,640
<i>Maybe that's true for now, but what about
in 10 years?  In 100 years?

512
00:49:52,101 --> 00:49:55,200
<i>You once said we were doomed
never to touch each other,

513
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:57,450
<i>but you did touch me...with your words.

514
00:49:58,651 --> 00:50:00,250
<i>Keep singing, My Love.

515
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,200
<i>I'll always be here to listen.

516
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:09,800
Oh, Floss, there's nothing to worry about.

517
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:16,550
Then why do you have to go all the way to Boston?

518
00:50:17,701 --> 00:50:20,650
The doctor thinks my headaches may have
something to do with my eyes.

519
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,810
And there's a specialist there.

520
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:29,690
I'm coming with you.  Cousin Delia
has plenty of room.

521
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:31,200
No, Floss.

522
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:36,500
I need you here.

523
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:41,700
I'm going to tell you something
that may sound rather strange.

524
00:50:42,151 --> 00:50:45,800
Even a little mad,
but I assure you it's true.

525
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:50,150
Now, I need you to promise me not to
interrupt until I'm finished.

526
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:56,200
Riders, ready!
5... 4... 3... 2... 1... GO!!

527
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:11,300
So, I take the letters that you send
to me here from Mr.  Corrigan...

528
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:15,950
put them in that compartment, close it, and they...

529
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:23,150
And you must promise to send his letter
to me care of Cousin Delia in Boston.

530
00:52:47,551 --> 00:52:48,550
Is he going to be okay?

531
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:51,200
The EEG does indicate some brain swelling

532
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,000
but fortunately his vital signs are stable.

533
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:56,500
When will he come out of it?

534
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:00,150
Right now it's just impossible to know.

535
00:53:47,301 --> 00:53:49,380
Elizabeth Whitcomb to see Dr. Reed.

536
00:53:49,381 --> 00:53:51,380
- Please take a seat, Miss Whitcomb.
- Thank you.

537
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:31,000
We'll have an accommodation room
for you shortly, Miss Whitcomb.

538
00:54:31,551 --> 00:54:32,530
Colonel Denby.

539
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:51,050
- 'til Friday, Colonel.
- Yes, thank you..

540
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:54,000
Miss Whitcomb, follow me.

541
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:23,470
I'm so sorry.

542
00:55:24,201 --> 00:55:26,900
- Miss Whitcomb, I...
- Colonel Denby.

543
00:55:27,401 --> 00:55:30,100
- What a coincidence.
- Pardon my clumsiness.

544
00:55:31,101 --> 00:55:33,650
Oh, it's all right, you seemed in a hurry.

545
00:55:34,451 --> 00:55:35,280
Yes.

546
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:39,050
Well, don't let me keep you.

547
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,090
Might I accompany you, Miss Whitcomb?

548
00:55:48,551 --> 00:55:51,100
Well, I...I wouldn't want to
interfere with your plans.

549
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:55,300
No, you're not, I have none.
I mean, ah....

550
00:55:57,151 --> 00:55:59,100
Where is your destination?

551
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:02,450
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

552
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:07,280
Perhaps you'd allow me to buy you a cup of tea
and we can decide where we're going.

553
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:12,490
All right.

554
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:21,850
Have you long been a patient of Dr. Reed's?

555
00:56:22,151 --> 00:56:24,030
No, this was my first visit.

556
00:56:26,641 --> 00:56:29,300
Are you present...forgive me, feeling poorly?

557
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:32,950
No, at present I fell quite well.

558
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:40,700
Forgive my boldness, may I
ask you a strange question?

559
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:43,150
Yes.

560
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,010
How is it I have the total
conviction that I know you?

561
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:52,400
I don't know, but I feel the same.

562
00:56:56,701 --> 00:57:01,330
<i>My Dearest Scotty: This afternoon I met
a gentleman named Caleb Denby.

563
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:04,800
<i>Presently a colonel commanding
the 19th Massachusetts.

564
00:57:06,171 --> 00:57:10,300
<i>Scotty, the moment I saw him,
I was powerfully drawn to him.

565
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:14,350
<i>And he, it appears, seems to feel
an attraction as well.

566
00:57:15,451 --> 00:57:19,900
<i>Please do not fear, My Darling, that I am
in any way moving away from you.

567
00:57:21,181 --> 00:57:24,050
<i>For I feel, strange as it may seem,

568
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:27,350
<i>that being with Caleb, brings me closer to you.

569
00:57:28,201 --> 00:57:32,300
<i>I have the uncanny feeling that
what is happening, it is meant to happen.

570
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:34,250
You promised to read to me.

571
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,150
- Oh, no, please!
- Please.

572
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:38,400
All right, let me see.

573
00:57:41,371 --> 00:57:42,300
No laughing!

574
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:48,200
"Stranger, not on this earth shall we meet.

575
00:57:48,901 --> 00:57:53,700
But surely, I have lived a life
and have dreamed of you.

576
00:57:54,301 --> 00:57:56,800
I would wait eternity to touch you.

577
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:13,700
It's okay, it's okay.

578
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:26,000
<i>Dearest Scotty, I despair at ever
hearing from you again.

579
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:32,350
<i>Flossy assures me that my letters to you continue
to miraculously vanish from the secret compartment.

580
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:36,400
<i>So I pray that you are still connected to me,

581
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:41,850
<i>reading this by one of your
"electrical lights", and understand it.

582
00:58:59,251 --> 00:59:02,850
Gracious ladies and fine gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

583
00:59:03,901 --> 00:59:06,200
Allow me to introduce the guest speaker

584
00:59:06,201 --> 00:59:10,650
who will tell you what your attendance
and your generous contributions mean

585
00:59:10,651 --> 00:59:13,700
to the wounded soldiers of our Great State.

586
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,010
This brave officer was grievously injured

587
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:22,000
at Chancellorsville, but he is returning
to his regiment this very week.

588
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:26,690
Let's all give a warm welcome
to Colonel Caleb Denby

589
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:29,450
of the 19th Massachusetts Infantry.

590
00:59:43,901 --> 00:59:46,000
You didn't tell me you were coming here tonight.

591
00:59:46,201 --> 00:59:49,800
- I thought I'd surprise you.
- Well, you have.

592
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:55,900
- You're not seriously going back, are you?
- I have to.

593
00:59:56,521 --> 00:59:59,620
- How long do we have?
- I leave day after tomorrow.

594
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,200
Lizzie, I need to see you alone.
Will you meet me tonight on The Common?

595
01:00:08,401 --> 01:00:12,400
- I can't...my Cousin Delia.
- What?

596
01:00:13,501 --> 01:00:15,200
...practically asleep now.

597
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:28,000
Lizzie.

598
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:42,350
- I kind of organized it for you.  - Great. Thanks.
- Um-huh.  - Sure.

599
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:48,600
So, um, maybe you should go up and lie down.

600
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:52,090
No, I'm fine.  I'm fine, I'm fine.

601
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:54,800
Look! See! I'm fine.
I'm nimble.

602
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:57,299
...well...

603
01:01:58,701 --> 01:02:00,900
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

604
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:03,420
- I'm cancelling my meeting.
- I'm fine, Debra, I'm fine.

605
01:02:04,001 --> 01:02:07,990
Just a little dizzy, the Doctor said
that was normal...normal dizziness, okay?

606
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:11,960
All right? My mother's coming over,
she'll cook Italian...

607
01:02:13,301 --> 01:02:15,580
I have to get back to living
sooner or later, right?

608
01:02:15,981 --> 01:02:16,981
Right.

609
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,200
- Promise you'll call me.
- I promise.

610
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:21,379
Great.

611
01:02:24,981 --> 01:02:25,700
Scott...

612
01:02:27,651 --> 01:02:30,200
When you...when you woke up in the Hospital...

613
01:02:33,551 --> 01:02:34,300
Yeah?

614
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:39,520
Nothing. Just glad you're back.

615
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:41,000
Me, too.

616
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,930
<i>...I am powerfully drawn to him
and he, it appears

617
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:06,400
<i>seems to feel an attraction as well.

618
01:03:07,101 --> 01:03:09,800
<i>Very soon, he will be returning to his regiment.

619
01:03:10,551 --> 01:03:13,000
<i>He says there are rumors of a decisive battle

620
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:15,240
<i>somewhere in southern Pennsylvania.

621
01:03:15,701 --> 01:03:18,500
<i>Darling, I am so frightened.

622
01:03:18,801 --> 01:03:20,050
Southern Pennsylvania.

623
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:24,200
Southern Pennsylvania in 1863.

624
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:26,600
Southern Pennsylvania. Gettysburg!

625
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:31,901
Gettysburg, Gettysburg.

626
01:03:34,502 --> 01:03:37,202
19th, 19th Massachu...

627
01:03:38,003 --> 01:03:39,703
19th Mass.

628
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:41,980
19th Mass.

629
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:44,800
50 per cent.

630
01:03:49,401 --> 01:03:51,901
...Delaney, Denby!

631
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:56,300
Colonel Caleb Denby, killed in action July 3rd.

632
01:04:03,801 --> 01:04:04,850
June 28th.

633
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:19,900
<i>Dearest Lizzie:

634
01:04:20,201 --> 01:04:22,900
<i>Do not let Colonel Denby return to his regiment.

635
01:04:23,001 --> 01:04:25,170
- Where are you going.
- Post Office.

636
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:28,250
- You just got out of the Hospital!
- I have to get this to Lizzie.

637
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:32,300
- Scotty, you cannot drive there!
- Yes, I can!
- All right, I'll drive!

638
01:04:54,201 --> 01:04:57,010
- What's that?
- That's the Post Office.

639
01:05:17,201 --> 01:05:20,350
- ...back behind the barricade there, Sir.
- Sir, I'm sorry. I need to get in there.

640
01:05:20,551 --> 01:05:23,700
- I know. Please, please behind the barricade!

641
01:05:24,051 --> 01:05:25,800
You can't go in there.

642
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:33,450
- Stay here. I'm just gonna go in for a second.
- No! - Stay! Wait here!

643
01:05:33,551 --> 01:05:37,150
No! No! Scotty! No! Come back!

644
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:31,350
When I come back, will you marry me?

645
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:34,020
Yes.

646
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:22,600
- Are you sure, Flossy?
- I check each day.

647
01:08:23,401 --> 01:08:24,980
And my letter to him?

648
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,620
They vanished, just as you said.

649
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:37,050
He promised.

650
01:08:41,401 --> 01:08:42,450
Lizzie, Dear.

651
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:47,190
Mr. Reagle has just arrived to welcome you home.

652
01:08:47,401 --> 01:08:51,250
Oh, no, Mother. I...I...I can't just now.

653
01:08:51,251 --> 01:08:53,500
Your father's told him you'd be right down.

654
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:56,100
Just freshen up a bit, Dear.

655
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:59,200
I'm sure seeing him will lift your spirits.

656
01:09:01,501 --> 01:09:04,000
Well, I do believe with General Grant
permanently in charge now

657
01:09:04,271 --> 01:09:06,140
the Western Campaign will be going much...

658
01:09:06,401 --> 01:09:09,400
I anticipate a speedy and comprehensive victory.

659
01:09:09,401 --> 01:09:11,200
Oh, I...I hope you're all right, Sir.

660
01:09:12,101 --> 01:09:16,300
Welcome back, Miss Whitcomb.
You were missed by all.

661
01:09:17,101 --> 01:09:18,400
Thank you, Mr. Reagle.

662
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:22,800
I hope you will forgive me, but I'm
rather fatigued, it was a long journey.

663
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:25,100
And I'd like to postpone this visit.

664
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:32,300
Lizzie...I've asked Mr. Reagle to join us at dinner.

665
01:09:33,931 --> 01:09:34,830
Maggie.

666
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:39,500
- Is there something for me?
- Yes, M'um. only this.

667
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:42,450
Lizzie, can you not be
more considerate of our guest?

668
01:09:42,451 --> 01:09:43,900
In a moment, Father.

669
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:48,550
Lizzie, what is it?

670
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:52,250
Get my bag, Flossy! Hurry!

671
01:09:54,251 --> 01:09:56,900
Father, I have to go to the Station right away.

672
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,800
But you've just this minute come
from the Station. What was in that letter?

673
01:09:59,801 --> 01:10:03,150
Mr. Reagle, will you give me a
ride in your shay, please?

674
01:10:03,661 --> 01:10:06,510
Dear Lady, I..I would do
anything to please you, but...

675
01:10:06,511 --> 01:10:08,510
against the wishes of your father...

676
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:10,300
Then I shall walk.

677
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:16,450
- I forbid it!
- I am not a child, Father.

678
01:10:16,901 --> 01:10:18,150
You can't stop me.

679
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:26,650
This is what comes of letting
her go to Boston unattended.

680
01:10:27,001 --> 01:10:27,900
Warren!

681
01:10:28,571 --> 01:10:31,280
Flossy, what did she tell you?

682
01:10:32,201 --> 01:10:33,550
Lizzie!

683
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:41,970
Lizzie!

684
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:15,530
Excuse me.

685
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,190
Does this train go anywhere near Gettysburg?

686
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:22,190
Naw. Closest you can get, Ma'am, is Harrisburg,

687
01:11:22,901 --> 01:11:25,160
if the Rebs ain't cut the line yet.

688
01:11:26,201 --> 01:11:28,650
- You'll have to take a carriage from there.
- Thank you.

689
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:41,240
All aboard!

690
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:58,600
- Oh, hi. -Hi.
- You're here.

691
01:11:59,201 --> 01:12:00,200
Yeah.

692
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:04,500
Look what I got.

693
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:06,600
Lots of yeses.

694
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:08,700
People wrote back already, huh?

695
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:11,200
The wedding's four weeks away.

696
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:15,700
- Don't forget, you lost a month.
- I know, I know, sorry.

697
01:12:15,701 --> 01:12:16,801
Honey...

698
01:12:17,101 --> 01:12:22,400
If you think that we should postpone this,
maybe it would be difficult but we could do it.

699
01:12:22,401 --> 01:12:24,900
- No, I don't want to do that, Honey.
- Fine.

700
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:29,300
- Hello.

701
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:30,501
<i>Any word?

702
01:12:31,091 --> 01:12:33,120
Uh...no, not yet.

703
01:12:33,801 --> 01:12:35,600
<i>I wonder if she even got the letter.

704
01:12:36,201 --> 01:12:37,300
Yeah, I was wondering that, too.

705
01:12:37,301 --> 01:12:39,340
Listen, Debra's here.

706
01:12:40,141 --> 01:12:44,740
<i>Sorry.  Well, send her my love and call
me if you hear anything, okay?

707
01:12:44,741 --> 01:12:45,841
Okay, bye-bye.

708
01:12:50,901 --> 01:12:52,600
That was mom, she send her love.

709
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:57,410
- What ..what was that all about?
- Uh...she's just worried about me.

710
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:00,360
That makes two of us.

711
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,900
I'm fine.  Why is that so difficult to believe?

712
01:13:05,351 --> 01:13:06,300
I'm sorry.

713
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:09,350
I'm sorry.

714
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:16,650
Okay.  Whatta we got here?

715
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:20,330
- I'm just trying to do this second stack.
- All right.

716
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:25,030
C'mon, Lizzie, it starts at dawn.

717
01:13:30,261 --> 01:13:31,560
Conductor.
Ma’am?

718
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:33,200
Will you take me to Gettysburg?

719
01:13:33,411 --> 01:13:36,200
Gettysburg! The heaviest fightin'
in the war is goin' on up there!

720
01:13:36,201 --> 01:13:39,510
Please, please take me.
I have to get there tonight.

721
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:42,300
I'll...I'll pay you anything that you like.

722
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:44,700
It ain't the money, Ma’am

723
01:13:47,001 --> 01:13:48,500
Fine! I'll find someone else.

724
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:53,880
Driver. Will you please take me to Gettysburg?

725
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:56,000
All right, Ma’am.

726
01:13:57,251 --> 01:13:59,350
- I'll take you to Gettysburg.
- Thank you, Sir.

727
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:39,100
Forward, Boys!

728
01:15:53,071 --> 01:15:56,000
Driver, can't you go any faster?

729
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:58,800
The horses are goin' as fast as they can, Ma’am.

730
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:12,390
- Driver, will you wait for me, please?
- Yes, Ma’am.

731
01:17:22,861 --> 01:17:23,700
Soldier!

732
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:26,800
Do you know where the 19th Massachusetts is?

733
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:29,300
There ain't no more 19th Massachusetts, Ma’am.

734
01:17:29,701 --> 01:17:32,200
The Rebs got 'em, got 'em good.

735
01:17:32,701 --> 01:17:34,200
What's left is over there.

736
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:18,500
Caleb.

737
01:18:25,331 --> 01:18:26,200
Darling.

738
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,100
Lizzie.

739
01:18:31,411 --> 01:18:32,200
Caleb.

740
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:38,440
I promised to marry you.
I promised to marry you.

741
01:18:38,441 --> 01:18:41,250
It's okay, it's all right. It's all right.

742
01:18:52,501 --> 01:18:54,500
- Say something.
- What?

743
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:56,050
Like on the river, say something.

744
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,140
"Stranger, not on this Earth... "

745
01:19:04,801 --> 01:19:08,500
"Stranger, not on this Earth shall we meet...

746
01:19:10,271 --> 01:19:14,600
though I have surely lived with you,
dreamed of you,

747
01:19:16,201 --> 01:19:19,000
I would wait eternity to touch you.

748
01:19:20,801 --> 01:19:24,600
Not in this world Outsized...

749
01:19:27,701 --> 01:19:29,300
Falling forward,

750
01:19:43,101 --> 01:19:45,100
Never to lose you".

751
01:20:36,201 --> 01:20:39,000
Lizzie, Dear, are you all right?

752
01:20:39,351 --> 01:20:41,150
No, Mother, I am not.

753
01:20:47,151 --> 01:20:49,900
- Elizabeth...
- Not now, Father.

754
01:21:28,701 --> 01:21:32,000
<i>Dearest, Scotty: I received your warning,

755
01:21:32,401 --> 01:21:33,800
<i>but it was too late.

756
01:21:34,901 --> 01:21:36,000
<i>Oh, my Darling.

757
01:21:36,701 --> 01:21:40,500
<i>My Colonel is gone, and with him
went that part of you

758
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:42,240
<i>I never thought to hold.

759
01:21:43,101 --> 01:21:44,350
<i>So, write to me.

760
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:47,490
<i>For you're all of him that remains.

761
01:21:59,031 --> 01:22:00,900
I'm so sorry.

762
01:22:04,851 --> 01:22:09,000
I know you don't want to hear this,
but it's for the best.

763
01:22:09,001 --> 01:22:14,300
Mother, Caleb is dead, Lizzie's heart
is broken and I can't even reach her.

764
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:21,550
An incredible miracle happened, Scotty.

765
01:22:21,801 --> 01:22:25,100
And you'll never forget it, but it's over.

766
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:29,650
It's time for you to be in the present
with the woman you're about to marry.

767
01:22:37,101 --> 01:22:39,630
You do still want to marry her, don't you?

768
01:22:49,701 --> 01:22:50,500
Hi.

769
01:22:51,901 --> 01:22:52,700
Hi.

770
01:22:55,821 --> 01:22:57,200
Are you all right?

771
01:22:58,701 --> 01:23:00,500
We need to talk.

772
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:03,850
What is it?

773
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:07,000
Read these.

774
01:24:07,661 --> 01:24:08,660
Miss Lizzie.

775
01:24:09,701 --> 01:24:11,500
I found this letter after you left.

776
01:24:14,401 --> 01:24:18,050
<i>Dear Lizzie: Please do not stop
writing your poetry.

777
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:22,300
<i>You once said we were doomed
to never touch each other,

778
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:25,240
<i>but you did touch me...with your words.

779
01:24:26,581 --> 01:24:27,980
<i>Keep singing, My Love.

780
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:30,700
<i>I'll always be here to listen.

781
01:24:42,949 --> 01:24:43,449
No.

782
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:50,250
Of course.

783
01:25:11,101 --> 01:25:12,050
What are these?

784
01:25:13,951 --> 01:25:15,650
Elizabeth Whitcomb wrote them.

785
01:25:16,951 --> 01:25:18,200
She's...

786
01:25:20,901 --> 01:25:22,200
been writing to me.

787
01:25:25,021 --> 01:25:27,300
Her letters just appear in the desk,

788
01:25:27,301 --> 01:25:28,830
and then...

789
01:25:31,801 --> 01:25:33,700
I write back to her.

790
01:25:44,001 --> 01:25:45,900
What you're telling me...

791
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:53,200
What you're telling me is...crazy.

792
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:56,500
It's insane.

793
01:25:58,371 --> 01:26:00,570
What, what, what, what is this?
What are you doing?

794
01:26:00,571 --> 01:26:05,320
- I'm trying to show you, I'm trying to tell you.
- Tell me what?

795
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,000
I fell in love with her.

796
01:26:27,501 --> 01:26:29,200
Elizabeth Whitcomb?

797
01:26:32,951 --> 01:26:34,890
I know it sounds...

798
01:26:35,831 --> 01:26:38,050
I don't know what that accident did to you,

799
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:41,600
- but this is really frightening, and...
- Deb, listen to me.

800
01:26:43,651 --> 01:26:44,500
What?

801
01:27:10,701 --> 01:27:11,620
Open it.

802
01:27:34,551 --> 01:27:40,490
<i>Dearest, Caleb is dead, and so,
My Future Love, are you.

803
01:27:41,451 --> 01:27:46,030
<i>It must be so, for you are one in the same.
I know that now.

804
01:27:47,901 --> 01:27:49,950
<i>But almost, as if from the grave

805
01:27:50,701 --> 01:27:53,900
<i>you have returned to me
something I thought I had lost:

806
01:27:54,801 --> 01:27:58,650
<i>My voice, although you may never hear it,

807
01:27:59,701 --> 01:28:01,950
<i>I am enclosing this song for you.

808
01:28:07,421 --> 01:28:08,800
This is crazy.

809
01:28:19,701 --> 01:28:21,100
How can this be?

810
01:28:23,501 --> 01:28:25,000
I don't know, but it's true.

811
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:28,920
This isn't happening, this is not possible.

812
01:28:30,251 --> 01:28:32,250
It is happening, it is happening.

813
01:28:33,601 --> 01:28:34,900
I don't understand it.

814
01:28:35,201 --> 01:28:37,700
I'm sorry I dragged you through it, but it's real.

815
01:28:38,501 --> 01:28:39,600
But it is real.

816
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:42,900
The love I felt for this woman,

817
01:28:43,301 --> 01:28:46,300
that I feel for her...is real.

818
01:29:00,311 --> 01:29:01,030
Debra.

819
01:29:03,701 --> 01:29:07,210
You deserve to be loved...

820
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:10,560
completely.

821
01:29:12,101 --> 01:29:16,690
I'm not even going to try
to understand what's happening.

822
01:29:18,821 --> 01:29:20,420
But I know this...

823
01:29:22,891 --> 01:29:24,850
if you don't feel that way about me,

824
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:29,240
we shouldn't be together.

825
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:46,950
<i>I will never forget how the winds
of time blew back and forth for me.

826
01:29:48,141 --> 01:29:51,900
<i>I will never forget how my heart lit up

827
01:29:51,901 --> 01:29:54,450
<i>like a glowing Christmas tree.

828
01:29:55,101 --> 01:29:58,150
<i>Though I wander in the hell or heaven,

829
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:01,860
<i>my slate wiped clean by death,

830
01:30:02,451 --> 01:30:08,700
<i>of you, My Love, My Dream Love,
I'll never, ever forget.

831
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:26,520
When?

832
01:30:27,871 --> 01:30:29,020
Tuesday.

833
01:30:29,951 --> 01:30:32,520
I'm sorry. May I come in?

834
01:30:43,501 --> 01:30:46,410
- So, what will you do now?
- Well, she left me the house, so,

835
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:49,900
I'll stay a while and see how it feels.

836
01:30:50,661 --> 01:30:53,200
Would you mind if I took one last look at her room?

837
01:30:54,201 --> 01:30:56,200
- Suit yourself.
- Thanks.

838
01:31:22,001 --> 01:31:22,800
Lizzie.

839
01:31:26,301 --> 01:31:28,200
Are you here?

840
01:32:28,941 --> 01:32:30,190
Oh, Scott.

841
01:32:31,951 --> 01:32:33,970
I miss you so much.

842
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:42,480
Are you all right, Mister?

843
01:32:45,151 --> 01:32:46,150
Yes, Ma’am

844
01:32:48,921 --> 01:32:51,000
Clarice wanted you to have this.

845
01:32:58,051 --> 01:33:01,200
She found it in the attic
when she was a little girl.

846
01:33:01,551 --> 01:33:07,400
It's a batch of letters, diaries, papers,
and poems, lots of poems.

847
01:33:15,301 --> 01:33:16,450
It's funny,

848
01:33:17,351 --> 01:33:21,250
Clarice could swear there were
no poems in it when she was a kid.

849
01:33:23,301 --> 01:33:27,200
Of course she was getting
pretty forgetful there at the end.

850
01:33:38,101 --> 01:33:42,200
"Dear Miss Whitcomb: You're my favorite
teacher at Willoughby School for Girls.

851
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:44,050
She became a teacher. That's great.

852
01:33:46,991 --> 01:33:49,930
Miss Whitcomb, Miss Whitcomb.

853
01:33:51,201 --> 01:33:53,600
Guess she didn't marry
His Reagle Highness, after all.

854
01:33:53,701 --> 01:33:56,500
- Who?
- Nothing, it's not important.

855
01:34:15,451 --> 01:34:16,580
Lizzie.

856
01:34:26,751 --> 01:34:28,350
That's you!

857
01:34:29,401 --> 01:34:31,060
How did you get in there?

858
01:34:34,701 --> 01:34:36,900
I'll try to explain, but...

859
01:34:38,351 --> 01:34:39,650
You're never gonna believe it.

860
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:57,800
"I never forgot".

861
01:36:26,001 --> 01:36:28,700
Whoa, whoa, who are you? Hey! Stay!

862
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:32,910
Orbit, come! Come here, Boy!
Come here Boy, quick, quick!

863
01:36:37,701 --> 01:36:39,600
And no jumping on strangers!

864
01:36:40,001 --> 01:36:40,800
It's all right.

865
01:36:42,211 --> 01:36:44,500
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

866
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:48,170
Don't worry about it.

867
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:56,140
He must really like you.
He doesn't usually jump on people.

868
01:37:01,351 --> 01:37:02,650
Is something wrong?

869
01:37:05,601 --> 01:37:09,160
No, no, nothing. Sorry.
Sorry, he's all right.

870
01:37:11,831 --> 01:37:14,890
Well, again, sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

871
01:37:16,951 --> 01:37:17,850
Bye.

872
01:37:23,551 --> 01:37:24,700
Good Boy!

873
01:37:28,951 --> 01:37:30,650
Excuse me, sorry.

874
01:37:33,351 --> 01:37:35,650
Do you know where I could get
a good cup of coffee, or...

875
01:37:36,201 --> 01:37:41,260
Yeah! I know a know a really good place,
actually, it's like three blocks from here.

876
01:37:41,651 --> 01:37:42,800
Could you show me?

877
01:37:43,301 --> 01:37:45,300
- Can I buy you a cup...
- No, no. That's all right.

878
01:37:45,301 --> 01:37:47,050
No, really, it's the least we can do.

879
01:37:48,601 --> 01:37:51,350
- You talked me into it.
- Okay, then.

880
01:38:11,501 --> 01:38:15,050
- I'm Scott.
- Hi. Beth.
