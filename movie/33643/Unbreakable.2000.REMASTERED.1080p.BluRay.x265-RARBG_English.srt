1
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,729
This is Mr. Mathison. He's a doctor.

2
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,777
Are you ok?

3
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,196
An ambulance is on the way.

4
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,820
Thank you.

5
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,290
Is there a name yet?

6
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,288
Elijah.

7
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,426
Is he supposed to be crying like this?

8
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,844
May 1?

9
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,678
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

10
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,270
Can I have him back?

11
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,782
What happened during the delivery?

12
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,660
Nothing. It was very quick.

13
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,742
The baby just wanted
to come right out.

14
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,622
There were no problems.

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,172
Did you drop him?

16
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,465
What?

17
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,589
Did you drop this baby?

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,716
Jesus Christ, no.

19
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,808
Inform the ambulance
that we have a situation.

20
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,891
- All right.
- Ma'am.

21
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,022
I've never seen... this.

22
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,780
It appears that your baby
has sustained some fractures

23
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,861
while inside your uterus.

24
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,499
His arms and his legs are broken.

25
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,752
Man over pa: This is eastraill 177.

26
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,879
Next stop, Philadelphia.

27
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,130
Woman: Are you alone?

28
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,048
Yeah. Yeah.

29
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,842
Someone left this magazine.

30
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,802
Want to take a look at it?

31
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,979
Can I take a look at that one?

32
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,069
Thanks.

33
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,022
You like sports?

34
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,277
It's my field.

35
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,610
I represent athletes. I'm an agent.

36
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,997
Are you looking for any male
synchronized swimmers?

37
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,416
I'm thinking about getting into that.

38
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,993
Is that right?

39
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,466
I'm afraid of water.
Think that's a problem?

40
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,181
You represent someone
in Philadelphia?

41
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,729
I'm meeting this player
from temple university.

42
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,852
He's a cornerback.

43
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,686
This kid 1s 6'1", 210 pounds.

44
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,940
He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.

45
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,740
Do you like football?

46
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,535
Not really.

47
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,045
I'm David Dunn.

48
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,380
Kelly. _hi.

49
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,678
Hi, nice to meet you.

50
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,972
Nice... nice to meet you.

51
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,400
How long are you gonna be
in Philadelphia?

52
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,780
I'm married.

53
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,077
Great.

54
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,405
What are you talking about?

56
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,416
I think you misunderstood.

57
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,085
What I was...

58
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,091
- Saying...
- I know.

59
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,968
I think I'm going to find
another seat.

60
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,721
I... I didn't mean...

61
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,745
That's what he fail to realize.
I look classy, not trashy.

62
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,071
I look classy too.

63
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,407
What about me?
Don't I look classy?

64
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,789
But I'm afraid you forgot... this!

65
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,915
And this!

66
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,123
Man: Where has you been, banana?

67
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,299
Man 2: Now I've got you, weasel.

68
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,377
Man 3: Some cars are still on fire,

69
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,134
and the debris is everywhere.

70
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,509
We are not sure at this time

71
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,468
how rescue personnel will be
able to get on scene at all.

72
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,177
Man 4: If you're just tuning in,

73
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,981
eastrail train number 177
has derailed outside Philadelphia.

74
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,184
We're bringing you
live coverage from skycam 4.

75
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,021
Man 3: That appears to be a rescue
ambulance. There are more behind it

76
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,525
I can see on the access road.

77
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,484
I don't know how close they're
gonna be able to get, David.

78
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,694
These are woods and... trees.

79
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,781
It's gonna be a very difficult
rescue effort.

80
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,135
Man: Hack some of that off.

81
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,858
Hi.

82
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,065
I'm Dr. dubin.

83
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,993
You're in the emergency room
in the Philadelphia city hospital.

84
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,945
You were in a serious accident.

85
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,164
Look at me.

86
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,000
How are you feeling?

87
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,455
- Ok.
- Good.

88
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,041
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

89
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,219
Have you ever had any heart
or asthma problems in the past?

90
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,306
No.

91
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,256
Kidney or renal problems?

92
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,675
No.

93
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,180
Any allergies?

94
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,930
No.

95
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,188
Where were you sitting on the train?

96
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,279
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?

97
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,823
Yeah.

98
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,077
Where are the other passengers?

99
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,209
Was your family traveling with you?

100
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,667
No.

101
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,469
Did you get up from your seat?

102
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,138
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?

103
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,647
Yes.

104
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,872
Why are you looking at me
like that?

105
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,074
Your train derailed.

106
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,751
Some kind of malfunction.

107
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,921
They only found
two people alive so far.

108
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,249
You and this man.

109
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,627
His skull was cracked open,

110
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,260
and most of his left side
was crushed.

111
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,266
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons

112
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,061
why I'm looking at you like this.

113
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,639
One, because it seems,
in a few minutes,

114
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,976
that you will officially be
the only survivor of this train wreck.

115
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,314
And two...

116
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,899
Because you didn't
break one bone.

117
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,286
You don't have a scratch on you.

118
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,100
David?

119
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,144
What happened...

120
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,600
In New York?

121
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,901
I don't think I got the job.

122
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,316
I'm still going...

123
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,657
I'm still moving there.

124
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,656
Just...

125
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,829
Oh, just... just not now.

126
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,125
Good night.

127
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,970
Good night.

128
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:09,526
Sara elaston, social worker
at broad and locust community center.

129
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,155
We pray for your soul.

130
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,749
Kevin Elliot, businessman,
father of six.

131
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,165
We pray for your soul.

132
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,048
Glen Stevens,

133
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,593
researcher in the area of leukemia

134
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,762
at drexel university.

135
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,965
We pray for your soul.

136
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,387
Jennifer pennyman,

137
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,690
third-grade teacher
at Jefferson elementary.

138
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,819
We pray for your soul.

139
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,091
Yes?

140
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,048
Is Noel in, ma'am?

141
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,259
No, sir, he is not.

142
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,221
I read about you in the paper.

143
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,522
What?

144
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,691
I was in an accident once too.

145
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,645
A horse almost
trampled me to death.

146
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,230
- Wow.
- Had him put down.

147
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,030
That's a sad story.

148
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,411
Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?

149
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,794
Proceed.

150
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,167
Ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken

151
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,172
- since I've worked here?
- That the entire message?

152
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,469
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,219
Thank you.

154
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,755
Hey, Noel.

155
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,383
What, you hit your head on that train?

156
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,890
Get your brain to start working again?

157
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,184
What?

158
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,981
Forty dollars.

159
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,898
- Forty dollars what?
- You're getting a $40-a-week raise.

160
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,399
That's it.

161
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,364
I checked. You were right.

162
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,408
You've never taken a sick day.

163
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,202
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.

164
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,331
Smart way to make your point.

165
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,226
Is Joseph ok?

166
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,404
Yeah. He's asleep.

167
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,651
Oh.

168
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,066
Uh...

169
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,660
I wanted to ask you a question.

170
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,951
It's gonna sound a little strange,

171
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,000
but just think about it
for a second, ok?

172
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:32,876
Ok.

173
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,668
When's the last time I was sick?

174
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,044
Do you remember?

175
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,259
Um, I don't know.

176
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,925
It's been a while.

177
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,643
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.

178
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,940
Ok.

179
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,188
Do you remember me getting sick?

180
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,939
Um...

181
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,075
Not a specific day.

182
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,494
What... what's this about?

183
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:13,159
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?

184
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,415
In the three years
we lived in this house?

185
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,373
In the old apartment?

186
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,630
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?

187
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,799
I... I can't remember.

188
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,890
Don't you think that's kind of weird,

189
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:36,224
not remembering one cold
or a fever or a sore throat?

190
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,395
What do you think it means?

191
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,654
Um...

192
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:52,244
I think it means probably
too tired to remember.

193
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,407
No more sitting in this room.

194
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,994
I let it go on long enough.

195
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,421
I'm not going out there anymore.
I'm not getting hurt again.

196
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,377
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.

197
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,258
You might fall between
this chair and that television.

198
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,386
If that's what god has planned
for you, that's gonna happen.

199
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,184
You can't hide from it
sitting in a room.

200
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,515
They call me Mr. glass at school

201
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,726
because I break like glass.

202
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,778
You make this decision now...

203
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,153
To be afraid...

204
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,907
And you will never turn back.

205
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:22,539
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.

206
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,930
- I got a present for you.
- Why?

207
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,812
Forget why.

208
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,609
You want it or not?

209
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,197
Well, go get it, then.

210
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,574
Where is it?

211
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,615
On a bench...

212
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,534
Across the street.

213
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,759
Someone's gonna take it.

214
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,935
Then you better
get out there soon.

215
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,006
I bought a whole bunch.

216
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,813
There'll be one of these
waiting for you

217
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,391
every time you want
to come out here.

218
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,738
They say this one
has a surprise ending.

219
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,461
This is from Fritz campion's
own library.

220
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:13,134
This is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1968.

221
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:18,096
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.

222
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,014
Notice the square jaw of slayer,

223
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,967
common in most comic heroes.

224
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,850
And the slightly disproportionate size
of jaguaro's head to his body.

225
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,024
This again is common,
but only in villains.

226
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,226
Mmm.

227
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,527
The thing to notice about this piece,

228
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,732
the thing that makes it
very, very special

229
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,819
is its realistic depiction
of its figures.

230
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,029
When the characters
reached the magazine,

231
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,206
they were exaggerated...

232
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,625
As always happens.

233
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,500
This... is vintage.

234
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,216
Well...

235
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,011
Wrap it up.

236
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,518
You've made
a considerably wise decision.

237
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,852
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.

238
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,906
Once again, please?

239
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,951
My son Jeb, it's a gift for him.

240
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,075
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.

241
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,126
No.

242
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:33,206
No, no, no, no, no.

243
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,259
You need to go. Now.

244
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,804
What... what'd I say?

245
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,382
Do you see any teletubbies in here?

246
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,808
Do you see a slender plastic tag

247
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,558
clipped to my shirt
with my name printed on it?

248
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,607
An Asian child
with a blank expression sitting outside

249
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,356
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?

250
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,983
No?

251
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,939
Well, that's what you see
at a toy store,

252
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,241
and you must think
you're in a toy store

253
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,157
because you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

254
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,116
Now one of us
has made a gross error

255
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,952
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.

256
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,416
This is an art gallery, my friend,

257
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,587
and this...

258
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,964
Is a piece of art.

259
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,229
We're by appointment only.

260
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,114
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations, you have a mailbox.

261
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,737
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.

262
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,161
This one was under
the windshield wiper of my car.

263
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,618
How certain are you
that you've never taken ill?

264
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,203
Seventy-five percent.

265
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,038
Well...

266
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,000
That's not certain at all, is it?

267
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,673
That's hole number one.

268
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,305
I'm going to be extremely
skeptical about all this.

269
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,928
David: About all what?

270
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,187
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?

271
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,185
Joseph: Dad's been injured.

272
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,275
Is the child correct?

273
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,525
Yes, sir.

274
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,857
In college, I was in a car accident.

275
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,364
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football anymore.

276
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,287
That's hole number two.

277
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,704
That's a big one.

278
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:41,000
Mr. price, can we talk about the note
that you left on my car?

279
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,086
I've studied the form
of comics intimately.

280
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,672
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed

281
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,883
with nothing else to do but read.

282
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,053
I believe comics are our last link

283
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,685
to an ancient way
of passing on history.

284
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,892
The Egyptians drew on the walls.

285
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:02,150
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.

286
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,698
I believe comics
are a form of history

287
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,992
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.

288
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,325
Then, of course, those experiences
and history got chewed up

289
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,954
in the commercial machine,
got jazzed up, made titillating,

290
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,785
cartooned for the sale rack.

291
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,506
This city has seen its share
of disasters.

292
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,209
I watched the aftermath
of that plane crash.

293
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,920
I watched the carnage
of the hotel fire.

294
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,926
I watched the news waiting to hear

295
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:34,262
a very specific combination of words,
but they never came.

296
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:38,395
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident,

297
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,392
and I heard them.

298
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,523
"There is a sole survivor,

299
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,947
and he is miraculously unharmed.”

300
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,238
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.

301
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:56,416
It's a genetic disorder. I don't make
a particular protein very well,

302
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,245
and it makes my bones
very low in density.

303
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,375
Very easy to break.

304
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,208
I've had 54 breaks in my life,

305
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:09,047
and I have the tamest version
of this disorder, type one.

306
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,599
There are type two,
type three, type four.

307
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,270
Type fours don't last very long.

308
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,519
So that's how it popped into my head.

309
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,317
If there is someone like me
in the world,

310
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,565
and I'm at one end of the spectrum,

311
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:29,195
couldn't there be someone else
the opposite of me at the other end?

312
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,867
Someone who doesn't get sick,

313
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,616
who doesn't get hurt
like the rest of us?

314
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,245
And he probably
doesn't even know it.

315
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:41,707
The kind of person
these stories are about.

316
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:47,881
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.

317
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,381
To guard us.

318
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,678
You think my dad's a real...

319
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,227
I don't think anything right now.

320
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,430
It's a possibility...

321
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,016
One with many holes.

322
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,613
Go throw it in the trash.

323
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,662
- But, dad...
- Do it now, please.

324
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,670
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.

325
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,220
You find someone
you want to take advantage of,

326
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,720
you tell them a fantastic story,

327
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,723
and somewhere in there
you say it:

328
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,647
"I just need
your credit card number...

329
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,520
A small down payment."

330
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,854
This morning was the first morning
I could remember

331
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,440
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...

332
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,201
Sadness.

333
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,330
I thought the person who wrote
that note had an answer for me.

334
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,759
I'm gonna leave now.

335
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,421
Good luck with your exhibition.

336
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,677
So, what kind of job
do you have, David?

337
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,350
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.

338
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,144
What exactly is it that you do?

339
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:25,565
I work at the university stadium.
I'm a security guard.

340
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,115
Hi.

341
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,031
I've come to a decision.

342
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,917
Ok.

343
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,461
I just want to ask you
something, ok?

344
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,757
And you can be totally honest.

345
00:34:55,844 --> 00:35:00,338
I'm prepared for any answer,
and it won't affect me.

346
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,057
Have you been with anyone?

347
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,477
I mean, since we've been
having problems.

348
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,054
The answer won't affect me.

349
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,439
I just need to know, you know?

350
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,067
It won't affect me either way.

351
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,199
No.

352
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,792
Anyway...

353
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,510
My decision is...

354
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,679
That I want to start again.

355
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:54,066
That I want it to be like it was
in the beginning.

356
00:35:56,488 --> 00:36:00,106
And it's a big deal that you
walked away from that train.

357
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,201
I feel like it's a second chance.

358
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,624
And if you feel like
asking me out sometime,

359
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,204
it'd be ok.

360
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,295
Ok.

361
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,682
- Man: Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.

362
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,392
It's Jenkins.

363
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,604
Look, we got a guy over
at gate 17-c with a bogus ticket.

364
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,406
Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.

365
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,076
What's he look like?

366
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,778
Why is it, do you think,

367
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,706
that, of all the professions
in the world, you chose protection?

368
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,410
You are a very strange man.

369
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,338
You could have been a tax accountant,
owned your own gym,

370
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:02,168
opened a chain of restaurants.
You could've done one of 10,000 things,

371
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:06,380
but in the end,
you chose to protect people.

372
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,214
You made that decision,

373
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,096
and I find that
very, very interesting.

374
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,267
Now all I need is
your credit card number.

375
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,270
That last part was a joke.

376
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,526
You're a big sports fan, are you?

377
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,154
It's starting to intrigue me.

378
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,995
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.

379
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,252
Man: Program here. Program.

380
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,677
Program.

381
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,389
Program.

382
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,061
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.

383
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,184
- Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?

384
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,478
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to search you.

385
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,852
The tall guy in
the camouflage jacket.

386
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,571
Sometimes people
carry weapons in here,

387
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,569
and they drink too much.

388
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,244
If the team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.

389
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,616
We do pat-downs of the crowd
to discourage people from carrying.

390
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,085
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.

391
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,305
Yeah, step right up here.

392
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,606
David: Ok.

393
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,322
I got you a seat
up in the yellow section.

394
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,740
It's in the nosebleeds,

395
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,069
but at least you won't get spit on.

396
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,533
All right.

397
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,957
How'd you know that guy you bumped
was carrying a weapon?

398
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,290
I don't know.

399
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:06,796
Maybe it was that camouflage
army jacket he was wearing.

400
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,174
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.

401
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,221
You thought
he was carrying a knife?

402
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,220
I thought he was
carrying something, yeah.

403
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,767
But not a knife.

404
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,814
I got a...

405
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,893
Picture of a silver gun
with a black grip

406
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,320
tucked in his pants.

407
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,944
You know, like on TV.

408
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,944
You have good instincts
for things like that?

409
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,198
Like what?

410
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,453
Knowing when people
have done something wrong.

411
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,210
Yeah.

412
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,130
Have you ever tried to develop it?

413
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,540
I don't know what you're asking me.

414
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,875
Your skill.

415
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,633
Look, I got to be down
on the sidelines during the game.

416
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,305
You can get to your seat
right down...

417
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,634
Characters in comics are often
attributed special powers...

418
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,847
Invisibility, X-ray vision,
things of that sort.

419
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,727
Ok.

420
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,601
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

421
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,153
It's an exaggeration of the truth.

422
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:13,408
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.

423
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,737
But he might not have been
carrying anything.

424
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,392
But he might have been
carrying a silver gun

425
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,372
with a black grip tucked in his pants.

426
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,291
Man: Dunn.

427
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,709
I gotta go.

428
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,005
Yeah, I know. I'll be right down.

429
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,251
One last question. “What?

430
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,430
That car accident you were in.
Was there anyone else involved?

431
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,265
Yeah. My wife Audrey.

432
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,688
She was in the car with me.

433
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,726
Have a good life, Elijah.

434
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,905
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.

435
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,109
I'm on my way.

436
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,953
Man:
Into the investigation of train 177

437
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,786
being conducted at the eastrail
holding warehouses.

438
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,337
The city council has stepped up
plans to pass a bill

439
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,882
requiring higher standards
for inspection and maintenance

440
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,054
of all rail transportation in
Philadelphia and its outlying districts.

441
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,018
Hold up a second!

442
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,701
I just want to ask you something.

443
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,900
Joseph: Dad!

444
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,147
Hey, dad!

445
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,159
Dad!

446
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,586
Joseph, do you know how mad
your mother would be

447
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:01,261
- if she knew you were playing football?
- Are you gonna tell?

448
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,053
You want to play last set of downs?
We got a big guy like you.

449
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,601
You could play on opposite sides.

450
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,224
He's Potter's cousin.

451
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,018
He's starting cornerback
at temple university.

452
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,191
He's going pro in the draft.

453
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:18,691
They say he can run
the 40 in 4.3 seconds.

454
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,692
I've heard.

455
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,820
You can beat him, dad.
Let's beat 'em.

456
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,071
I'm gonna go in.

457
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:28,030
Just one set of downs.
I told them you were great.

458
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,614
- Why'd you do that?
- Just one.

459
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,458
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.

460
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,082
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.

461
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,212
- I'll help you.
- I don't need...

462
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,292
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!

463
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,009
Hut! You're doing good.

464
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,215
Right there! Catch!

465
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,405
How much did you put on there?

466
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,831
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.

467
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,292
How much can you lift?

468
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,043
That's the most I ever lifted.

469
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,513
That could've been dangerous, Joseph.

470
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,724
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me finish up, ok?

471
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,893
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.

472
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:41,611
You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

473
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,233
No.

474
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,359
- I mean, if you knew karate.
- No.

475
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:55,621
What if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?

476
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,247
No, Joseph.

477
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,624
How much did you take off?

478
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,090
I lied.

479
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,004
You added?

480
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,230
How much is it?

481
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,151
Two hundred and seventy pounds.

482
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:08,773
Let's put more.

483
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,320
Ok.

484
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,751
Why don't you move back a little
just to be safe, ok?

485
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,069
More?

486
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,459
You should never do
anything like this.

487
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,089
You know that, right?

488
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,302
What do you do
if something bad happens?

489
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,633
Get mom.

490
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,893
Right.

491
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,885
How much did you put on that time?

492
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,638
All of it.

493
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,224
What else can we use?

494
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,510
How much is it?

495
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,604
How much is it, dad?

496
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,019
About 350 pounds.

497
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,741
Doctor:
Fracture of the fifth metacarpal,

498
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,165
as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.

499
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:06,409
The worst of the injury

500
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,871
was sustained to the right leg
in the form of a spiral fracture.

501
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,048
There were 14 breaks.
It simply shattered.

502
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,090
They call me Mr. glass.

503
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,842
- Doctor: Who does?
- Kids.

504
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,552
Doctor: Are you all right, Mr. price?
Shall I continue?

505
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,436
Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg.

506
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,690
The use of a wheelchair will be
needed for a two-month period.

507
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,647
The use of crutches will follow
for 12 to 14 months.

508
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,107
Hospital stay will range
from five to eight days

509
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,944
followed by nine to 12 months
of physical therapy.

510
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,120
Prescribed medication
for pain management

511
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:47,120
will take the usual forms
of morphine drip, Percocet, darvocet.

512
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:02,515
Your 10:00 is here. The hospital
discharged him this morning.

513
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,768
Thanks.

514
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,941
Elijah, right?

515
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,444
We're gonna prevent
any substantial atrophy

516
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:22,902
of your good leg with this,
and it works your quadriceps.

517
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,825
How long have you been married?

518
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,201
Twelve years.

519
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,412
How'd you get together?

520
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,165
I'm a little nervous being here.

521
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,003
I ask too many questions
when I'm nervous.

522
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,764
A car accident.

523
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,011
Oh.

524
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,809
Now you're gonna have
to tell me more.

525
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,316
My husband
was a star athlete in college,

526
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,860
and we were
in an accident together.

527
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,527
Our car flipped on an icy road,
we were both injured.

528
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,405
He couldn't play football anymore.
If that hadn't happened,

529
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,368
we wouldn't have been together.

530
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,866
How so?

531
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,039
I think we should
talk about your rehab.

532
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,412
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

533
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:16,334
So tell me more
about the quad machine.

534
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:22,929
It prevents atrophy by...
I couldn't spend my life

535
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:26,052
with someone who played football.
It's pretty much that simple.

536
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,887
I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount of skill it involves.

537
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,939
Like everyone else, I was in awe
of the way he played it,

538
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:37,484
but football, in many ways,
is the opposite of what I do.

539
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,985
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.

540
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,988
It's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.

541
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:50,156
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but...

542
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,287
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident

543
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:55,665
and took football
out of the equation.

544
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,122
And everyone lived happily ever after.

545
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,050
Sort of.

546
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,970
What part of David's body was injured?

547
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,886
Who said my husband's name
was David?

548
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:19,648
- Let's just go to our seats, ok?
- Man: Ladies and gentlemen...

549
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,990
In the first half...

550
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,476
Boy: No!

551
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,897
Elijah: A 737 crashes on takeoff,

552
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,358
172 die, no survivors.

553
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,535
A hotel fire downtown,

554
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,408
211 die, no survivors.

555
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:16,583
An eastrail train derails seven
and a half miles outside the city,

556
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,911
131 die,

557
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,337
one survivor.

558
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,207
He is unharmed.

559
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:26,260
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.

560
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,179
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.

561
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,474
Since then, I've come
to believe that possibility,

562
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:37,021
however unbelievable,
is now more a probability.

563
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,972
And what was it you suggested?

564
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,943
These are mediocre times,
Mrs. Dunn.

565
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,488
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe

566
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:50,443
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.

567
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,745
I hope you can keep
an open mind.

568
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,878
Crowd: Defense!

569
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:15,475
Defense!

570
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,818
Man: Ok, here you go.

571
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,403
Thanks a lot.

572
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,114
Excuse me, sir?

573
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,200
Can you step out of line, please?

574
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:48,964
We've been having problems with people
selling drugs here in the stadium.

575
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,295
Would you mind
if I check your pockets?

576
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,302
Raise your arms, please.

577
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,471
Come on, raise them up.

578
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,031
Can I put my hands down now?

579
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,619
Can I go?

580
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,413
Yeah.

581
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,998
Hope you find them.

582
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,182
Man: Yo, Dunn.

583
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,469
Yeah.

584
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,896
I just came into the office.
Your kid was hurt.

585
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,810
- Where is he?
- Some play rehearsal at school.

586
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,816
He wants you to come down there.

587
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,878
Is that your dad?

588
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,592
I bet my dad
could beat up your dad.

589
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:19,842
No. He...
He insisted we call only you,

590
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,394
though we had some trouble
tracking you down.

591
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,267
I mean, you're not on our list.

592
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:29,859
- Audrey handles this type of stuff.
- Oh, what type of stuff?

593
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,230
Joseph stuff.

594
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,282
Do I need to put any smelly
ointment on him or anything?

595
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,364
No, no. It's more emotional damage,

596
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,996
not... not too serious, physically.

597
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:48,420
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

598
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,630
When was that?

599
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:59,306
My office was on the other side
of the building back then.

600
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,269
You don't remember me, do you?

601
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,140
No, ma'am.

602
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,226
I had red hair.

603
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:17,571
Well, you were a little younger
than Joseph when it happened.

604
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,617
Did you know that we changed

605
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:23,948
the rules of conduct
around the pool because of you?

606
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,959
The kids still tell about it
like it was some sort of ghost story.

607
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:35,926
"Did you know there was a kid
nearly drowned in that pool?

608
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:41,306
He lay on the bottom of the pool
for five minutes,

609
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:45,011
and when they pulled him out,
he was dead."

610
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,398
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.

611
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:00,113
You still phobic of water?

612
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,909
Joseph: It was Potter and another guy.

613
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:10,335
They were messing with this
Chinese girl in the dressing room.

614
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,914
You can't let bad things happen
to good people, right?

615
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,341
That's your code, right?

616
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,384
That's the hero's code.

617
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,348
I tried to make them stop,
but they kept pushing me down,

618
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,926
and they wouldn't let me get back up.

619
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,397
I thought maybe
'cause you're my dad...

620
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,692
I thought I might be like you.

621
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,819
I'm not like you.

622
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,615
You are like me.

623
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,572
We can both get hurt.

624
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,828
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.

625
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,089
Why do you keep saying that?

626
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,600
Audrey: Elijah price came
to visit me at the center today.

627
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,890
Jesus.

628
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,687
He didn't do anything.
He just...

629
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,734
Told me his theory.

630
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:20,439
That's sad,
when patients get like that.

631
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,024
They lose reality.

632
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,160
Joseph, what the hell
are you doing?

633
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,117
Oh, my god.

634
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,999
You don't believe.
I'll show you, you can't get hurt.

635
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,128
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't know
where I keep the bullets.

636
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,084
In your rookie of the year trophy.

637
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,004
Joseph, did you load that gun?

638
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,722
You won't get hurt.

639
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,098
- Elijah was wrong.
- When did he meet Elijah?

640
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,476
- He was with me when I met him.
- No one believes him.

641
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,103
Joseph, listen to me.

642
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:59,110
Sometimes when people
get sick or hurt

643
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:03,065
for a long time, like Elijah,
their mind gets hurt too,

644
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,985
and they start to think things
that aren't true.

645
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,663
He told me what he thought
about your father. It isn't true.

646
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,034
I'll show you.

647
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:16,461
Do you remember the story
about the boy

648
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,254
that almost drowned in the pool?

649
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,003
That was me they were
talking about. I almost died.

650
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,709
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

651
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,044
I just didn't remember it.

652
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:28,724
You know your father was injured in
college. You know. You know about that.

653
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,180
Don't do it.

654
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:34,145
- He'll die, Joseph.
- I'll just shoot him once.

655
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,564
Joseph, listen to what your mot...

656
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,191
Don't be scared.

657
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,483
Joseph,

658
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,031
if you pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.

659
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,451
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.

660
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,494
You're right.

661
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:53,745
If you pull that trigger,
that bullet will bounce off me,

662
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,998
and I'm not going to be hurt,
but then I'm going to go upstairs

663
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:00,922
and I'm going to pack and
I'm going to leave for New York.

664
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,124
Why?

665
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,052
Because I thought we were just
starting to be friends for real,

666
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,006
and friends will listen to each other.
They don't...

667
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,012
And they don't shoot each other,
do they, Audrey?

668
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:15,140
No shooting friends, Joseph.

669
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,018
Joseph...

670
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,816
You are about to be
in big trouble!

671
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,358
Now, I am your father,
and I am telling you

672
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,612
to put that goddamn gun
down right now!

673
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,613
One!

674
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,702
Twol!

675
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,723
I followed the guy
in the camouflage jacket.

676
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,477
He had a silver gun
with a black grip

677
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,976
tucked in the back of his pants.

678
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,602
Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?

679
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,986
Because I believe you faked it.

680
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:09,282
I believe you took the opportunity
to end your football career,

681
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,859
no questions asked.

682
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:14,412
And I think you did it,
of all things, for a woman.

683
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,080
I guess that makes sense.

684
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:20,001
Football's, what, just ten years,

685
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:21,669
but love...

686
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,293
Hmm. Now, that's forever.

687
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,133
And that little bit of sadness
in the mornings you spoke of,

688
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,509
I think I know what that is.

689
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,808
Perhaps you're not doing
what you're supposed to be doing.

690
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,886
Most guns have
a black or silver handle.

691
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,188
I had a 50-50 shot
of getting the color right.

692
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:43,233
- That's not what I withessed.
- Stop.

693
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:46,649
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.

694
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,026
My son almost shot me last night

695
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,636
because he wanted to prove
you were right.

696
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,446
I never said you couldn't be killed.

697
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,448
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.

698
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,246
There have been
three major disasters,

699
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,416
and you were
the only one unharmed.

700
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,413
I have been sick.

701
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:06,169
When I was a kid,
I spent a week in the hospital

702
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,877
getting better from pneumonia.
I almost drowned.

703
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:14,431
Two skinny little kids were fooling
around in a pool dunking me,

704
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,257
and I swallowed some water.

705
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,344
They didn't know it,
and it almost killed me.

706
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,729
Heroes don't get killed like that.

707
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,727
Normal people do, right?

708
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:28,194
I don't need to see you
anymore, ok?

709
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,399
Please stay away from my family.

710
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,211
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.

711
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,963
I gotta head.

712
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:59,267
You better not be jacking off to
the Japanese comics, I swear to god.

713
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,941
Look, man, I didn't know
you were in a...

714
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:19,283
Just choose something, all right?

715
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,374
The baby-sitter's here.

716
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:33,259
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fine.

717
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,090
We can do this another time.

718
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,470
Don't lie.

719
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,764
I'm fine. I just got mixed-up.

720
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,861
How about we just go
for a couple drinks?

721
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,161
Ok, look, man,
I'm just gonna wheel you out.

722
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,368
You can think about things
on the sidewalk.

723
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,330
I got to get some chicken in me,
you know what I'm saying?

724
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,232
Shit!

725
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,994
Dude.

726
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:53,332
I don't care if you are in a wheelchair.
If you do that again, I'm calling 5-0.

727
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,252
Man.

728
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:12,146
That's it, crackerjack. You're gonna
be sitting your ass in jail now.

729
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,256
How much for this one?

730
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,553
Rust?

731
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,346
Yeah.

732
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,970
As a color, not as rust.

733
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,767
You know, like...

734
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,391
Rust-colored paint or wood.

735
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,603
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

736
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,191
Um...

737
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:55,564
Mine's still brown.

738
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,567
Ok, my turn.

739
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,194
Favorite song?

740
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:05,411
Soft and wet by the artist
formerly known as prince.

741
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,578
What?

742
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,581
We're supposed to be honest.

743
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,415
Soft and wet.

744
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:17,090
- That's very interesting.
- Ok, my turn.

745
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,883
When was the first time...

746
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,590
The thought popped into your head
we might not make it?

747
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,427
That's not the game.

748
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,138
It's the first date.
There aren't any rules.

749
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,607
Don't know for sure.

750
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:39,983
Think carefully.

751
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,483
What about the game?

752
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:45,489
It's over. I won.

753
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,823
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specific moment.

754
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,327
Maybe it was a time...

755
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:56,709
I had a nightmare one night, and...

756
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,087
I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was ok.

757
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:04,004
I think that was the first time.

758
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:07,765
Does that count?

759
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,557
That counts.

760
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:19,068
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?

761
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,619
Yes.

762
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,531
Why?

763
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,622
I don't know.

764
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,342
I just don't feel right, Audrey.

765
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,670
Something's...

766
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:48,344
Just not right.

767
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,802
Do you resent us, David?

768
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,851
Resent the life you have?

769
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:02,695
There were a lot of other things
you could've done after college.

770
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,693
These were your choices.

771
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:12,113
Even if it meant
we couldn't have been together,

772
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,119
I never would've wished
that injury on you.

773
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:19,545
What you could do physically
was a gift.

774
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,587
I never would've wished it
to go away.

775
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,591
You know that, right?

776
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,889
You had two calls
after Joseph went to bed.

777
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,792
One came through while I was on the
other line, but I wasn't talking long.

778
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:40,729
There was an emergency with my sister.
She tried to do a perm, and she looks...

779
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,936
Who called through?

780
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,065
Um...

781
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:47,615
Someone from New York,
about a security job.

782
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:48,942
They want to hire you.

783
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,322
I didn't know you guys
were moving to New York.

784
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,870
Thanks for telling me.

785
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:56,039
We weren't all gonna move.

786
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,459
Oh.

787
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,707
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

788
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:09,674
Great.

789
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,104
Look, let's just be honest here.
We're just at the beginning,

790
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:29,111
and I don't expect you or I to change

791
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,659
the course of where our lives
were headed

792
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,361
because of one date.

793
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,118
And if you do go to New York,

794
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:41,203
we can develop this.
We'll just be forced to take it slow.

795
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:45,673
And in the end,
I think that's definitely better.

796
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,673
This is our second time around, David.

797
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:53,052
I didn't expect us to get
carried away, you know.

798
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:58,560
Then I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.

799
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,168
David, it's Elijah.

800
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:30,218
It was so obvious. It was this one issue
that brought it back for me...

801
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:34,138
Century comics 117. That's where
this group, the coalition of evil,

802
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:37,467
tried to ascertain the weakness
of every superhero,

803
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:40,804
because they all have one,
just like you.

804
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,765
Your bones don't break. Mine do.

805
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,975
That's clear.

806
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:48,653
Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine.

807
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,855
You don't get sick. I do.

808
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,781
That's also clear.

809
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,200
But for some reason,

810
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:57,950
you and I react
the exact same way to wafer.

811
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,406
We swallow it too fast, we choke.

812
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,742
We get some in our lungs, we drown.

813
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:07,797
However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I.

814
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,045
We're on the same curve,

815
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,673
just on opposite ends.

816
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:16,881
The point of all this is we now know
something we didn't,

817
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:19,058
you have a weakness...

818
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,555
Water.

819
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,762
It's like your kryptonite.

820
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:25,519
You hearing me, David?

821
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,196
Audrey?

822
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,899
Gotcha.

823
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,526
Come on.

824
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:37,133
Audrey.

825
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:39,219
Audrey.

826
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,553
Hey!

827
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,596
Audrey.

828
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,391
What happened?

829
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,068
What happened?

830
01:16:58,155 --> 01:16:59,361
I thought I was...

831
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,984
I thought I was dead.

832
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,361
Me too.

833
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,410
Is she all right?

834
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,207
I think her leg's broken.

835
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,285
Are you hurt?

836
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,121
Hey, man, are you hurt?

837
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,070
Hello?

838
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,999
David: I wasn't injured
in that car accident.

839
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,200
David.

840
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,954
I've never been injured, Elijah.

841
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,424
What am I supposed to do?

842
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:11,137
Go to where people are.

843
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:15,138
You won't have to look very long.

844
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,608
It's all right to be afraid, David,

845
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,152
because this part
won't be like a comic book.

846
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:28,318
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes
that were drawn for it.

847
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:08,444
There's one in the first row.

848
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:11,117
It's... it's the second one.

849
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:13,821
Yes. It's the second one over.

850
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,573
Go back to Africa!

851
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:06,965
Hey, what's your name?

852
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,428
I think you drank too much.

853
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:03,351
Can I come in?

854
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:04,978
Who are you?

855
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,901
I like your house.

856
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,812
Can I come in?

857
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:12,444
What is this?

858
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,028
No. You can't come in.

859
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:19,784
Are you sure?

860
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,366
What... what are you...?

861
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:54,680
_lt's ok.

862
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,446
It's ok. It's ok.

863
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:22,541
Shh, shh, shh...

864
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,265
I had a bad dream.

865
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:01,239
It's over now.

866
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,515
David: I don't know.

867
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,932
I can't believe you'd think that.

868
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:37,017
I'm just asking you.

869
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,151
I'm making French toast.

870
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,047
I've been thinking about Elijah price.

871
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:05,591
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, ok?

872
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:10,676
Ok?

873
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:15,107
Ok.

874
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:26,130
You were right.

875
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:19,350
This is one of Johann Davis'
earliest drawings.

876
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,482
See the villain's eyes?

877
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:25,059
They're larger
than the other characters'.

878
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:28,362
They insinuate a slightly
skewed perspective

879
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:31,483
on how they see the world...

880
01:36:31,577 --> 01:36:33,863
Just off normal.

881
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:35,570
He doesn't look scary.

882
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:41,292
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son,
but he says there's always two kinds.

883
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,669
There's the soldier villain

884
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:47,715
who fights the hero with his hands,
and then there's the real threat,

885
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:50,669
the brilliant and evil archenemy

886
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:53,300
who fights the hero with his mind.

887
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:56,758
- Are you Elijah"s mother?
- I am.

888
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:59,139
I'm helping him with the sale.

889
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,972
Nice to meet you.
I'm David Dunn.

890
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:04,022
He's spoken of you.

891
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:07,523
- Says you're becoming friends.
- We are.

892
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,734
Looks like he's doing good today.

893
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:13,654
I'm very proud of him.

894
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:17,120
He's come through a lot in his life,

895
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:21,825
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.

896
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,204
Mm-hmm.

897
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:24,581
They were bad...

898
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:28,631
But he made it.

899
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,299
Yes, he did.

900
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:34,215
He's kind of a miracle.

901
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:37,803
Yes, he is.

902
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:44,480
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

903
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,341
It has begun.

904
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:21,555
Tell me something, David.

905
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:25,225
When you woke up this morning,

906
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:27,523
was it still there?

907
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,146
The sadness?

908
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:31,936
No.

909
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,776
I think this is
where we shake hands.

910
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,428
Did you see it?

911
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:13,236
I worked in that building 25 years.

912
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:15,608
I know all its secrets.

913
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:18,111
Secrets?

914
01:39:20,413 --> 01:39:25,077
Like if there ever was a fire
on floors one, two or three,

915
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:27,784
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.

916
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:37,339
Passengers aren't allowed in there.

917
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,972
Elijah: Do you know
what the scariest thing is?

918
01:40:26,812 --> 01:40:29,019
To not know your place in this world,

919
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:35,148
to not know why you're here.
That's...

920
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:40,071
That's just an awful feeling.

921
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:43,697
What have you done?

922
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:47,158
I almost gave up hope.

923
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:51,584
There were so many times
I questioned myself.

924
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:54,162
You killed all those people.

925
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:57,331
But I found you.

926
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:01,552
So many sacrifices...

927
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:04,797
Just to find you.

928
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:06,632
Jesus Christ.

929
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:18,978
Now that we know who you are,

930
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:22,489
I know who I am.

931
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:29,155
I'm not a mistake.

932
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:32,787
It all makes sense.

933
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:36,541
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?

934
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:41,175
He's the exact opposite of the hero,

935
01:41:41,262 --> 01:41:44,754
and most times, they're friends,
like you and me.

936
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:47,966
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?

937
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:50,764
Because of the kids.

938
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:03,655
They called me Mr. glass.
