1
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,190
This is Mr Mathison.
He's a doctor.

2
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,950
- Are you okay?
- An ambulance is on the way.

3
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,990
Thank you.

4
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,210
Is there a name yet?

5
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,460
Elijah.

6
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,010
Is he supposed
to be crying like this?

7
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,090
May I?

8
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,530
Can I have him back?

9
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,450
What happened during the delivery?

10
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,200
Nothing.
It was very quick.

11
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,420
The babyjust wanted
to come right out.

12
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,500
And there were no problems.

13
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,010
Did you drop him?

14
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,050
What?

15
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,300
Did you drop this baby?

16
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,340
Jesus Christ, no.

17
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Inform the ambulance
that we have a situation.

18
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,610
All right.
Molly.

19
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,530
I've never seen this.

20
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,320
It appears that your baby
has sustained some fractures...

21
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,410
while inside your uterus.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,960
His arms and his legs are broken.

23
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,260
This is Eastrail 177.

24
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,510
Nextstop, Philadelphia.

25
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,420
Are you alone?

26
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,180
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,470
Someone left this magazine.

28
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,520
Want to take a look at it?

29
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,600
Could I take a look at that one?

30
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,900
Thanks.

31
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,910
- You like sports?
- It's my field.

32
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,950
I represent athletes.
I'm an agent.

33
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,250
Are you looking for any
male synchronized swimmers?

34
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,170
- I'm thinking about getting into that.
- Is that right?

35
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,550
I'm afraid ofwater.

36
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,630
Think that's a problem?

37
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,100
You represent someone
in Philadelphia?

38
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,400
I'm meeting this player
from Temple University.

39
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,480
He's a cornerback.

40
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,360
This kid is 6'1 ", 210 pounds.

41
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,610
He runs a 40 in 4,3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.

42
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,700
Do you like football?

43
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,740
Not really.

44
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,720
- I'm David Dunn.
- Kelly.

45
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,590
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

46
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,640
Nice - Nice to meet you.

47
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,820
How long are you gonna be
in Philadelphia?

48
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,080
- I'm married.
- Great.

49
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,040
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

50
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,040
I--

51
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,460
I think you misunderstood
what I was, uh...

52
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,670
- s-saying--
- I know.

53
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,600
I think I'm gonna find another seat.

54
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,180
I-I didn't mean, uh--

55
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,080
That's what he failed to realize.
I look classy, not trashy.

56
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,000
I look classy too. What about me?
Don't I look classy?

57
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,500
But I'm afraid you forgot this!

58
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,800
- And this! And--
- Where has you been, Banana?

59
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,090
Now I've got you, weasel.

60
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,930
Some cars are still on fire,
and the debris is everywhere.

61
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,890
We are notsure at this time, uh...

62
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,480
how rescue personnel will be able
to get on scene at all.

63
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,140
If you're just tuning in,
Eastrail train number 177...

64
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,650
has derailed
just outside Philadelphia.

65
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,070
And we're bringing you
live coverage from Skycam 4.

66
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,490
Yes, that is-- It appears
to be a rescue ambulance...

67
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,530
and there are more behind it
I can see on the access road.

68
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,070
I don't know how close they're
gonna be able toget, David.

69
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,990
These are woodsand, uh, trees.

70
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,450
It's gonna be a very
difficult rescue effort.

71
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,560
Try to hack some of that off.

72
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,160
Hi. I'm Dr Dubin.

73
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,950
You're in the emergency room in
the Philadelphia City Hospital.

74
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,040
You were in a serious accident.

75
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,500
Look at me.

76
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,540
How are you feeling?

77
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,670
- Okay.
- Good.

78
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,220
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

79
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,050
Have you ever had any heart
or asthma problems in the past?

80
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,350
- No.
- Kidney or renal problems?

81
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,890
- No.
- Any allergies?

82
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,270
No.

83
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,070
Where were you sitting
on the train?

84
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,950
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?

85
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,170
Yeah.

86
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,170
- Where are the other passengers?
- Was your family travelling with you?

87
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,720
No.

88
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,550
Did you get up from your seat?

89
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,190
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?

90
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,440
Yes.

91
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,870
Why are you looking at me like that?

92
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,000
Your train derailed.

93
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,830
Some kind of malfunction.

94
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,880
They only found
two people alive so far--

95
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,920
you and this man.

96
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,680
His skull was cracked open and
most of his left side was crushed.

97
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,970
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons...

98
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,060
why I'm looking at you like this.

99
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,980
One, because it seems
in a few minutes...

100
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,360
that you will officially be
the only survivor of this train wreck.

101
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,360
And two...

102
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,410
because you didn't break one bone.

103
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,830
You don't have a scratch on you.

104
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,890
David?

105
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,480
What happened in New York?

106
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,700
I don't think I got the job.

107
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm still going to, uh--

108
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,540
I'm still moving there.

109
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,580
Just--

110
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,710
Uh, just - just not now.

111
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,880
Good night.

112
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,010
Good night.

113
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,070
Sara Elaston...

114
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,320
social worker at
Broad and Locust Community Centre.

115
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,700
We pray foryour soul.

116
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,000
Kevin Elliot, businessman...

117
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,000
father of six.

118
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,040
We pray for your soul.

119
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,800
Glen Stevens...

120
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,180
researcher in the area
of leukemia...

121
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,260
at Drexel University.

122
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,060
We pray for your soul.

123
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,020
Jennifer Pennyman...

124
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,320
third-grade teacher
at Jefferson Elementary.

125
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,490
We pray for your soul.

126
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,760
- Yes?
- Is Noel in, ma'am?

127
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,810
No, sir, he is not.

128
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,100
I read about you in the paper.

129
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,440
- What?
- I was in an accident once too.

130
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,530
A horse almost trampled me to death.

131
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,570
- Wow.
- Had him put down.

132
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,240
That's a sad story.

133
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,040
Could-- Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?

134
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,290
Proceed.

135
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,460
Would you ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken...

136
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,670
since I've worked here?

137
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,630
- That the entire message?
- Yes, ma'am.

138
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,520
Thankyou.

139
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,600
Hey, Noel.

140
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,890
What, you hit your head on that train?

141
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,980
Get your brain
to start working again?

142
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,270
- What?
- Forty dollars.

143
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,610
- Forty dollars what?
- You're gettin' a $40-a-week raise.

144
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,650
That's it.

145
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,990
I checked. You were right.
You've never taken a sick day.

146
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,790
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.

147
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,870
Smart way to make your point.

148
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,150
- Is Joseph okay?
- Yeah.

149
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,820
- He's asleep.
- Oh.

150
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,910
I wanted to ask you a question.

151
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,250
It's gonna sound a little strange,
but, uh...

152
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,290
just think about it
for a second, okay?

153
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,090
Okay.

154
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,300
When's the last time I was sick?

155
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,380
Do you remember?

156
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,930
Um, I-I don't know.

157
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,850
It's been a while.

158
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,690
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.

159
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,940
Okay.

160
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,980
Do you remember me gettin' sick?

161
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,490
Um...

162
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,870
not a specific day.

163
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,160
And what's-what's this about?

164
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,960
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?

165
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,960
In the three years
we lived in this house?

166
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,090
In the old apartment?

167
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,180
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?

168
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,470
I-I can't remember.

169
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,690
Don't you think
that's kind of weird...

170
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,980
not remembering one cold
or a-a fever or a sore throat?

171
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,240
What do you think it means?

172
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,950
Um...

173
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,870
I think it means
I'm probably too tired to remember.

174
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,710
No more sittin' in this room.
I let it go on long enough.

175
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,960
I'm not goin' out there any more.
I'm not getting hurt again.

176
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,340
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.

177
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,760
You might fall between
this chair and that television.

178
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,890
If that's what God has planned for you,
that's what's gonna happen.

179
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,350
You can't hide from it
sittin' in a room.

180
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,280
They call me Mr Glass at school
because I break like glass.

181
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,370
You make this decision now...

182
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,790
to be afraid...

183
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,580
and you will never turn back.

184
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,130
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.

185
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,520
- I got a present for you.
- Why?

186
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,190
Forget why.

187
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,780
You want it or not?

188
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,990
Well, go get it, then.

189
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,040
Where is it?

190
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,750
On a bench...

191
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,790
across the street.

192
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,850
Someone's gonna take it.

193
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,650
Then you better get out there soon.

194
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,060
I bought a whole bunch.

195
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,650
There'll be one of these
waitin' for you...

196
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,900
every time you want
to come out here.

197
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,740
They say this one
has a surprise ending.

198
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,670
This is from Fritz Campion's
own library.

199
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,680
This is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1968.

200
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,850
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.

201
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,930
Notice the square jaw of Slayer,
common in most comic heroes.

202
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,770
And the slightly disproportionate size
of Jaguaro's head to his body.

203
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,940
This again is common,
but only in villains.

204
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,400
The thing to notice about this piece...

205
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,530
the thing that makes it
very, very special...

206
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,700
is its realistic depiction
of its figures.

207
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,830
When the characters
reached the magazine...

208
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,960
they were exaggerated...

209
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,290
as always happens.

210
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,170
This is vintage.

211
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,010
Well...

212
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,600
wrap it up.

213
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,100
You've made a considerably
wise decision.

214
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,530
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.

215
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,160
Once again, please?

216
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,040
My son Jeb--
it's a gift for him.

217
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,000
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.

218
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,040
No.

219
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,920
No, no, no, no, no.

220
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,800
You need to go. Now.

221
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,720
What'd - What'd I say?

222
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,140
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?

223
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,270
Do you see a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt...

224
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,480
with my name printed on it?

225
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,520
Did you see a little Asian child with
a blank expression sitting outside...

226
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,360
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?

227
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,030
No? Well, that's what
you see at a toy store...

228
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,120
and you must think
you're in a toy store because...

229
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,750
you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

230
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,870
Now, one of us
has made a gross error...

231
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,130
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.

232
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,380
This is an art gallery,
my friend...

233
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,220
and this is a piece ofart.

234
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,530
We're by appointment only.

235
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,950
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations.

236
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,620
You have a mailbox.
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.

237
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,580
This one was under
the windshield wiper of my car.

238
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,540
How certain are you that
you've never taken ill?

239
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,170
Seventy-five percent.

240
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,670
Well, that's not
certain at all, is it?

241
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,050
That's hole number one.

242
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,310
I'm going to be extremely skeptical
about all this.

243
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,390
About all what?

244
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,100
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?

245
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,190
Dad's been injured.

246
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,530
Is the child correct?

247
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,740
Yes, sir. In college,
I was in a car accident.

248
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,700
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football any more.

249
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,750
That's hole number two.

250
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,540
That's a big one.

251
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,090
Mr Price, can we talk about
the note that you left on my car?

252
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,470
I've studied the form
of comics intimately.

253
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,600
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed...

254
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,850
with nothing else to do but read.

255
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,890
I believe comics
are our last link...

256
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,690
to an ancient way
of passing on history.

257
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,940
The Egyptians drew on walls.

258
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,320
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.

259
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,530
I believe comics
are a form of history...

260
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,240
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.

261
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,620
Then, of course,
those experiences and that history...

262
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,750
got chewed up in the commercial
machine, got jazzed up...

263
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,750
made titillating,
cartooned for the sale rack.

264
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,550
This city has seen its share
of disasters.

265
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,090
I watched the aftermath
of that plane crash.

266
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,760
I watched the carnage
of the hotel fiire.

267
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,730
I watched the news waiting to hear
a very specifiic combination of words...

268
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,310
but they never came.

269
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,190
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident...

270
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,320
and I heard them.

271
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,450
"There is a sole survivor...

272
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,660
and he is miraculously unharmed."

273
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,120
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.

274
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,210
It's a genetic disorder.

275
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,290
I don't make a particular
protein very well...

276
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,960
and it makes my bones
very low in density.

277
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,340
Very easy to break.

278
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,970
I've had 54 breaks in my life...

279
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,850
and I have the tamest version
of this disorder, type one.

280
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,600
There are type two,
type three, type four.

281
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,690
Type fours don't last very long.

282
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,360
So that's how it popped into my head.

283
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,280
If there is someone
like me in the world...

284
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,570
and I'm at one end
of the spectrum...

285
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,740
couldn't there be someone else...

286
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,030
the opposite of me
at the other end?

287
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,540
Someone who doesn't get sick, who
doesn't get hurt like the rest of us?

288
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,380
And he probably
doesn't even know it.

289
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,710
The kind of person
these stories are about.

290
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,930
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.

291
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,050
To guard us.

292
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,060
- You think my dad's a real--
- I don't think anything right now.

293
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,650
It's a possibility--

294
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,690
one with many holes.

295
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,950
Joseph, don't take
another sip of that water.

296
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,160
- Go throw it in the trash.
- But Dad--

297
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,250
Do it now, please.

298
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,510
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.

299
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,140
You find someone you want
to take advantage of...

300
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,640
you tell them a fantastic story...

301
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,640
and somewhere in there you say it:

302
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,690
"I just need
your credit card number...

303
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,730
a small down payment."

304
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,400
This morning was the first morning
that I could remember...

305
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,490
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...

306
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,490
sadness.

307
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,250
I thought the person that wrote
that note had an answer for me.

308
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,180
I'm gonna leave now.

309
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,260
Good luck with your exhibition.

310
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,850
So, what kind ofjob
do you have, David?

311
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,020
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.

312
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,650
- What exactly is it that you do?
- I work at the University Stadium.

313
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,320
I'm a security guard.

314
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,250
Hi.

315
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:47,170
I've come to a decision.

316
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,630
Okay.

317
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,250
I just wanna ask you something, okay?

318
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,840
And you can be totally honest.

319
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,550
I'm prepared for any answer,
and-and it won't affect me.

320
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,980
Have you been with anyone?

321
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,270
I mean, since we've
been having problems.

322
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,360
The answer won't affect me.

323
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,280
I just need to know, you know?

324
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,320
I mean, it won't affect me
either way.

325
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,740
No.

326
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,880
Sorry, David.
I'm sorry.

327
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,340
Anyway...

328
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,430
my decision is...

329
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,680
that I want to start again.

330
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,110
And I want it to be
like it was in the beginning.

331
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,820
And it's a big deal that
you walked away from that train.

332
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,830
I feel like it's a second chance.

333
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,300
And if you feel like
asking me out sometime...

334
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,340
that'd be okay.

335
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,800
Okay.

336
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,070
- Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.

337
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,450
Yeah, it's Jenkins. Look, we got a guy
over at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket.

338
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,580
Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.

339
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,370
What's he look like?

340
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,660
Why is it, do you think, that
of all the professions in the world...

341
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,710
you chose protection?

342
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,630
- You are a very strange man.
- You could have been a tax accountant.

343
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,590
You could have owned your own gym. You
could've opened a chain of restaurants.

344
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,050
You could've done
one of 10,000 things.

345
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,310
But in the end,
you chose to protect people.

346
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,850
You made that decision,
and I find that...

347
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,940
very, very interesting.

348
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,190
Now all I need is
your credit card number.

349
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,280
That last part was a joke.

350
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,950
- You're a big sports fan, are you?
- It's starting to intrigue me.

351
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,660
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.

352
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,390
Programme here.
Programme.

353
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,430
Programme.

354
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,020
Programme. Programme here.

355
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,100
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.

356
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,190
-Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?

357
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,280
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to search you.

358
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,740
- It's nothing personal.
- The tall guy in the camouflage jacket.

359
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:07,410
Sometimes people carry weapons in here,
and they drink too much.

360
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:12,120
If the team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.

361
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,500
We do pat-downs of the crowd
to discourage people from carrying.

362
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,550
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.

363
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,640
Yeah, step right up here.

364
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,620
Okay. I got you a seat up
in the yellow section.

365
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,500
It's in the nosebleeds,
but at least you won't get spit on.

366
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,830
- All right.
- How'd you know that guy you bumped...

367
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,920
was carrying a weapon?

368
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,300
I don't know.

369
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,800
Maybe it was that camouflage
armyjacket he was wearing.

370
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,680
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.

371
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,100
You thought he was carrying a knife?

372
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,310
- I thought he was carrying
something, yeah.
- But not a knife.

373
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,900
I got a picture of a silver gun
with a black grip...

374
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,200
tucked in his pants.

375
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,700
You know, like on TV.

376
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,000
You have good instincts
for things like that?

377
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,500
- Like what?
- Knowing when people
have done something wrong?

378
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,090
- Yeah.
- Have you ever tried to develop it?

379
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:50,180
- I don't know what you're asking me.
- Your skill.

380
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,390
Look, I gotta be down on
the sidelines during the game.

381
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,720
- You can get to your seat right down--
- Characters in comics...

382
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,310
are often attributed special powers--

383
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,900
invisibility, X-ray vision,
things of that sort.

384
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,530
Okay.

385
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:09,280
- I don't wanna play this game any more.
- It's an exaggeration of the truth.

386
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,580
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.

387
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,290
- But he might not have been
carrying anything.
- But he might have been carrying...

388
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:20,250
a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in his pants.

389
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,170
- Dunn.
- I gotta go.

390
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,800
Yeah, I know.
I'll be right down.

391
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,090
- One last question.
- What?

392
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,600
That car accident you were in.

393
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,640
Was there anyone else involved?

394
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,230
Yeah.
My wife, Audrey.

395
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,360
She was in the car with me.

396
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,400
Have a good life, Elijah.

397
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,820
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.

398
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,990
- Dunn.
- I'm on my way.

399
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,250
...into the investigation
of train 177...

400
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,540
being conductedat the Eastrail
holding warehouses.

401
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,170
The citycouncil has
stepped up plans to pass a bill...

402
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,590
requiring higher standards
for inspection and maintenance...

403
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,350
of all rail transportation
for Philadelphia...

404
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,390
and its outlying districts.

405
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,820
Hold up a second!

406
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,500
I just want to ask you something.

407
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,900
Dad! Hey, Dad!

408
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,790
Dad!

409
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,640
Joseph, do you know how mad
your mother would be if
she knew you were playing football?

410
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,560
Are you gonna tell?

411
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,060
You wanna play last ofthe downs?
We got a big guy like you.

412
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,310
You could play on opposite sides.
He's Potter's cousin.

413
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,940
He's starting cornerback
at Temple University.

414
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,070
He's going pro in the draft.

415
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,610
They say he can run the
40 Yards in 4,3 seconds.

416
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,610
Yeah, I've heard.

417
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,700
You can beat him, Dad.

418
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,290
- Let's beat him.
- I'm gonna go in.

419
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,000
Just play one set ofdowns.
I told them you were great.

420
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,040
- Why'd you do that?
-Just one.

421
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,290
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.

422
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,170
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.

423
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,880
- I'll help you.
- No, I-I don't need--

424
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,720
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!

425
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,850
Go, go.
Here we go! Ready?

426
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:47,100
Hut! You're doing good.
Right there! Catch!

427
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,520
I've got to run

428
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,150
To keep from hiding

429
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,570
And I'm bound

430
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,150
To keep on riding

431
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,910
And I've got one more silverdollar

432
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,120
How much did you put on there?

433
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,750
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.

434
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,630
How much can you lift?

435
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,800
That's the most I ever lifted.

436
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,100
That could've been dangerous,Joseph.

437
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,560
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me finish up, okay?

438
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,440
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.

439
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,570
You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

440
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,450
No.

441
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,030
I mean, if you knew karate.

442
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,120
No.

443
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:55,290
Well, what if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?

444
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,380
No, Joseph.

445
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,460
How much did you take off?

446
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,890
I lied.

447
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,390
You added?

448
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,270
How much is it?

449
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,740
270 pounds.

450
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,280
Let's put more.

451
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,040
Okay.

452
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,960
Why don't you move back a little
just to be safe, okay?

453
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,710
More?

454
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,850
You should never do anything like this.
You know that, right?

455
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,100
What do you do
if something bad happens?

456
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,690
Get Mom.

457
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,690
Right.

458
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,680
How much did you put on that time?

459
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,480
All of it.

460
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,190
What else can we use?

461
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,810
How much is it?

462
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,730
How much is it, Dad?

463
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,280
About 350 pounds.

464
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,460
Fracture of the fifth metacarpal
of the right hand...

465
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,880
as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.

466
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,550
The worst of the injury, however,
was sustained to the right leg...

467
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,590
in the form of a spiral fracture.

468
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,670
There were 14 breaks.

469
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,680
It simply shattered.

470
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,300
They call me Mr. Glass.

471
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:21,100
- Who does?
- Kids.

472
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,270
Are you all right, Mr Price?

473
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,350
Shall I continue?

474
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,110
Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg.

475
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,940
The use of a wheelchair will be needed
for a two-month period.

476
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:35,450
The use of crutches will follow
for 12 to 14 months.

477
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,660
Hospital stay will range
from fiive to eight days...

478
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,620
followed by 9 to 12 months
of physical therapy.

479
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,410
Prescribed medication for pain
management will take the usual forms...

480
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,290
of morphine drip, percocet, darvocet.

481
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,850
Your, uh, 10:00 is here.

482
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,100
The hospital discharged him
this morning.

483
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,270
Thanks.

484
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,200
Elijah, right?

485
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,120
We're gonna prevent any substantial
atrophy ofyour good leg with this...

486
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,410
and it works your quadriceps.

487
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,790
How long have you been married?

488
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,420
- Twelve years.
- How'd you get together?

489
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,680
I'm a little nervous being here.

490
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,220
I ask too many questions
when I'm nervous.

491
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,310
A car accident.

492
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:47,190
Oh. And now you're gonna
have to tell me more.

493
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,030
My husband was a star athlete
in college...

494
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,200
and we were in
an accident together.

495
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,870
Our car flipped on an icy road
and we were both injured, and he
couldn't play football any more.

496
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,700
And if that hadn't happened,
we probably wouldn't have been together.

497
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,500
- How so?
- I think we should talk
about your rehab.

498
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,920
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

499
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,590
So, tell me more
about the quad machine.

500
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,840
It prevents atrophy by--

501
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,810
I couldn't spend my life
with someone who played football.

502
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,850
It's pretty much that simple.

503
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,230
I mean, I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount of skill it involves.

504
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:33,110
And-And like everyone else,
I was in awe of the way he played it.

505
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:37,450
But football, in many ways,
is the opposite of what I do.

506
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,200
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.

507
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,740
You know, it's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.

508
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,750
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but--

509
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,920
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident...

510
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,210
and took football out of the equation.

511
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,260
And everyone lived happily ever after.

512
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,930
Sort of.

513
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,680
What part of David's body was injured?

514
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,390
Who said my husband's name was David?

515
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,110
Ladies and gentlemen--

516
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,830
In the first half--

517
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,570
A 737 crashes on takeoff--

518
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,580
172 die, no survivors.

519
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,080
A hotel fire downtown--
211 die, no survivors.

520
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,090
An Eastrail train derails
7 1/2 miles outside the city--

521
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,170
131 die...

522
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,340
one survivor.

523
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,760
He is unharmed.

524
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,760
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.

525
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,680
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.

526
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,930
Since then, I've come to believe
that possibility...

527
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,980
however unbelievable...

528
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,560
is now more a probability.

529
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,480
And what was it you suggested?

530
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,320
These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn.

531
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,990
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe...

532
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:50,120
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.

533
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,290
I hope you can keep an open mind.

534
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,880
Excuse me, sir?

535
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,380
Can you step out of line, please?

536
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,470
We've been having some problems
with people selling drugs
here in the stadium.

537
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,060
Would you mind if I check your pockets?

538
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,890
Raise your arms, please.

539
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,940
Come on, raise them up.

540
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,270
I just got here, man.

541
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,910
Can I put my hands down now?

542
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,630
Can I go?

543
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,750
Yeah.

544
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,300
Hope you find them.

545
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,900
- Yo, Dunn.
- Yeah.

546
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,980
I just came into the office.
Your kid was hurt.

547
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,450
- Where is he?
- Some play rehearsal at school.

548
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,780
He wants you to come down there.

549
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,760
Is that your dad?

550
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:13,180
I bet my dad could beat up your dad.

551
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,810
No, he, uh, he insisted
we call only you...

552
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,940
though we had some trouble
tracking you down.

553
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,110
I mean, you're not on our list.

554
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,940
Audrey handles this type of stuff.

555
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,780
Oh. What type of stuff?

556
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,200
Joseph stuff.

557
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,700
Do I need to put any smelly ointment
on him or anything?

558
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,790
No, no, it's more emotional damage.

559
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,420
Not, uh-- Not to serious, physically.

560
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,050
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

561
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,220
When was that?

562
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,930
My office was on the other side
of the building back then.

563
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,060
You don't remember me, do you?

564
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:10,150
- No, ma'am.
- I had red hair.

565
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:17,120
Well, you were a little younger
than Joseph when it happened.

566
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,830
Did you know that we
changed the rules of conduct...

567
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,670
around the pool because of you?

568
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,090
The kids still tell about it...

569
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,630
Like it was some sort of ghost story.

570
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,050
"Did you know there was a kid
nearly drowned in that pool?

571
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,680
He lay on the bottom of the pool
for five minutes.

572
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:45,020
And when they pulled him out,
he was dead."

573
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:53,700
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.

574
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,830
You still phobic of water?

575
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,870
It was Potter and another guy.

576
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:10,130
They were messing with
this Chinese girl in the dressing room.

577
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,590
Y-You can't let bad things
happen to good people, right?

578
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,220
That's your code, right?
That's the hero's code.

579
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,680
I tried to make them stop...

580
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,850
but they kept pushing me down,
and they wouldn't let me get back up.

581
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,530
I thought maybe 'cause you're my dad...

582
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,950
I thought I might be like you.

583
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,530
I'm not like you.

584
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:45,620
You are like me.

585
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,960
We can both get hurt.

586
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:53,510
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.

587
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,430
Why do you keep saying that?

588
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,400
Elijah Price came to visit me
at the centre today.

589
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,400
Jesus.

590
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,280
He didn't do anything. Hejust...

591
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,320
told me his theory.

592
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,160
That's sad when patients get like that.

593
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,200
They lose reality.

594
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,750
Joseph, what the hell are you doing?

595
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,790
Oh, my God.

596
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,670
You don't believe. I'll show you.
You can't get hurt.

597
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,720
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't
know where I keep the bullets.

598
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,800
In your Rookie of  the Year trophy.

599
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,680
Joseph, did you load the gun?

600
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,480
- You won't get hurt.
- Elijah was wrong.

601
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,020
- When did he meet Elijah?
- He was with me when I met him.

602
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,110
No one believes him.

603
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:56,150
Joseph, listen to me.

604
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:01,410
Sometimes when people get sick or hurt
for a long time, like Elijah...

605
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:05,330
their mind gets hurt too, and they
start to think things that aren't true.

606
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:09,210
He told me what he thought
about your father. It isn't true.

607
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,290
I'll show you.

608
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,010
Do you remember the story about the--
about the boy that almost
drowned in the pool?

609
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:20,760
That was me they were talking about.
I almost died. That was me.

610
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,600
- You're lying.- I'm not lying, okay?
I just didn't remember it, that's all.

611
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,850
Joseph, you know your father
was injured in college.

612
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:28,810
You know that.
You know all about that.

613
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,480
Don't do it.
He'll die,Joseph.

614
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,030
- I'll just shoot him once.
-Joseph, listen to what your moth--

615
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:39,110
Don't be scared.

616
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,320
Joseph...

617
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:44,990
if you pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.

618
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,410
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.

619
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,040
Y-Y-You're right.
If you pull that trigger...

620
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,380
that bullet is just gonna bounce off me,
and I'm not going to be hurt.

621
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,760
But then I'm going to go upstairs
and I'm gonna pack...

622
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,050
and I'm going to leave for New York.

623
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:06,060
- Why?
- Because I thought we were just
starting to be friends for real.

624
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,140
And friends'll listen to each other.
They don't--

625
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:12,100
And-And they don't shoot each other,
uh, uh, do they, Audrey?

626
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:15,190
N-No shooting friends,Joseph.

627
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:17,780
Joseph!

628
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,950
You are about to be in big trouble!

629
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,070
Now, I am your father,
and I am telling you...

630
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,370
to put that goddamn gun down
right now!

631
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:30,330
One, two--

632
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,640
I followed the guy
in the camouflage jacket.

633
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:59,030
He had a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in the back of his pants.

634
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,070
Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?

635
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,660
'Cause I believe you faked it.
I believe you took the opportunity...

636
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,490
to end your football career,
no questions asked.

637
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:14,330
And I think you did it,
of all things, for a woman.

638
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,380
I guess that makes sense.

639
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,750
Football's what, just ten years?

640
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:24,380
But love?
Hmm. Now, that's forever.

641
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,930
And that little bit of sadness
in the mornings you spoke of?

642
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,270
I think I know what that is.

643
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:35,900
Perhaps you're not doing
what you're supposed to be doing.

644
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,940
Most guns have a black
or silver handle.

645
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,020
I had a 50-50 shot
of getting the colour right.

646
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,240
- That's not what I witnessed.
- Stop.

647
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,610
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.

648
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,330
My son almost shot me last night because
he wanted to prove you were right.

649
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,370
I never said you couldn't be killed.

650
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,460
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.

651
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:59,380
There have been three major disasters,
and you were the only one unharmed.

652
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,460
I have been sick.

653
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:08,430
When I was a kid, I spent a week in the
hospital getting better from pneumonia.

654
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:12,260
I almost drowned.
Two skinny little kids...

655
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,850
were fooling around in a pool dunking me
and I swallowed some water.

656
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:19,020
They didn't know it,
and it almost killed me.

657
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,690
Heroes don't get killed like that.

658
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:24,030
Normal people do, right?

659
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:28,570
I don't need to see you any more, okay?

660
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,620
Please stay away from my family.

661
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,420
She said I could tell stories
that could make you cry

662
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,590
What about you

663
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,880
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.

664
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,930
I gotta head.

665
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:55,270
And she sighed, ahh
lsaid, I want to be a singer

666
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:58,770
You better not be jacking off to the
Japanese comics, I swear to God.

667
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,730
Let's go, let's sit
Let's talk politics

668
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:06,780
Goes so good with beer
And while we're at it, baby

669
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,320
Why don't you tell me
one of your biggest fears

670
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:12,530
I said, losing my penis
to a whore with disease

671
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,790
Uh, look, man, I didn't
know you were in a--

672
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:17,080
Losin'my life to
a whore with disease

673
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,080
-Just choose something, all right?
- Excuse me, please

674
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:27,010
The baby-sitter's here.

675
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:33,140
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fine.

676
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,890
We can do this another time.

677
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,980
Don't lie.

678
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,730
I'm fine. I just got mixed up.

679
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:55,740
How about we just go
for a couple drinks?

680
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:04,170
Okay, look, man,
I'm-I'm just gonna wheel you out.

681
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,210
All right? You can think about things
outside on the sidewalk.

682
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,300
I gotta get some chicken in me,
you know what I'm sayin'?

683
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,590
I've been tired, I've been tired

684
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,560
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired

685
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,690
- I told the tale of a girl
- Shit!

686
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:31,030
She's a little bit older than me

687
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:33,910
Strong legs, strong face
voice like milk

688
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,950
Breasts like a cluster  of grapes

689
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,370
I can't escape her ways

690
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,410
She raise me

691
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:48,750
- Dude.
- Even if you have no one

692
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,880
Man, I don't care if you are in
a wheelchair. If you do that again...

693
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,510
I'm calling 5-0.

694
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,640
And while you're at it, baby

695
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,720
Man.

696
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:07,940
You don't want to sleep
aftersetting my loins on fire

697
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:11,360
That's it, cracker jack. You're gonna
be sitting your ass in jail now.

698
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:16,200
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired

699
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,790
I've been tired, I've been tired

700
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:32,720
I've been tired, I've been tired

701
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,970
- I've been tired, I've been tired
- How much for this one?

702
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:37,510
I've been tired

703
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:42,350
- Rust?
- Yeah.

704
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,770
As a colour, not as rust.

705
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:48,810
You know, like rust-coloured
paint or wood.

706
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:53,860
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

707
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:56,530
Mine's still brown.

708
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,620
Okay, my turn.

709
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,950
Favourite song?

710
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:05,160
"Soft and Wet" by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.

711
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,580
What?

712
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:10,460
We're supposed to be honest.

713
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,920
"Soft And Wet."

714
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:15,340
That's very interesting.

715
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,430
Okay, my turn.

716
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,390
When was the first time...

717
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,730
the thought popped into your head
we might not make it?

718
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,230
That's not the game.

719
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,360
It's the first date.
There aren't any rules.

720
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:40,070
- Don't know for sure.
- Think carefully.

721
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,370
What about the game?

722
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:45,450
It's over. I won.

723
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,460
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specific moment.

724
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:54,300
- Maybe it was a time--
- I had a nightmare one night...

725
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:00,260
and I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was okay.

726
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,140
I think that was the first time.

727
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,140
Does that count?

728
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,690
That counts.

729
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,280
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?

730
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,420
Yes.

731
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,500
Why?

732
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,670
I don't know.

733
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,760
I just don't feel right, Audrey.

734
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,600
Something's...

735
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,890
just not right.

736
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,190
Do you resent us, David?

737
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,730
Resent the life you have?

738
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:02,280
I mean, there were a lot of other things
you could've done after college.

739
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:04,780
These were your choices.

740
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,750
You know, even if it meant
we couldn't have been together...

741
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:15,250
I never would've wished
that injury on you.

742
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:17,840
What you could do physically...

743
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,130
was a gift.

744
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:23,010
I never would've wished it to go away.

745
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,220
You know that, right?

746
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,310
You had two calls after Joseph
went to bed. One came through...

747
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,690
while I was on the other line,
but I wasn't talking too long.

748
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:40,610
There was an emergency with my sister.
She tried to do her own perm, and now
she looks like she stuck her head--

749
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,820
Who called through?

750
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,280
Um, someone from New York...

751
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:47,450
uh, about a security job.

752
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,710
They want to hire you. I didn't know
you guys were moving to New York.

753
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,210
Thanks for telling me.

754
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,880
We weren't all gonna move.

755
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,050
Oh.

756
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:04,340
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

757
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,430
Great.

758
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,740
Look, let'sjust be honest here.
We're just at the beginning...

759
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:28,870
and I don't expect
you or I to change...

760
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,410
the course of where
our lives were headed...

761
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,790
because of one date.

762
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:38,340
And if you do go to New York,
we can develop this.

763
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,590
We'll just be forced to take it slow.

764
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:45,430
And in the end, I think
that's defiinitely better.

765
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,260
I mean, this is our second time around,
David. I didn't expect us...

766
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:52,640
to get carried away.

767
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:58,730
But I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.

768
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,760
David, it's Elijah.

769
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,840
It was so obvious.

770
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:30,260
It was this one issue
that brought it back for me--

771
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,350
Century Comics 117.

772
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:34,600
That's where this group,
the Coalition of Evil...

773
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,140
tried to ascertain the weakness
of every superhero...

774
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:40,690
because they all have one,
just like you.

775
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:44,820
Your bones don't break.
Mine do. That's clear.

776
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,320
Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine.

777
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:52,370
You don't get sick.
I do. That's also clear.

778
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:57,790
But for some reason, you and I
react the exact same way to water.

779
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:00,250
We swallow it too fast, we choke.

780
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,590
We get some in our lungs, we drown.

781
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:07,760
However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I.

782
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,510
We're on the same curve,
just on opposite ends.

783
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,680
The point of all this is we
now know something we didn't.

784
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:20,270
You have a weakness-- water.

785
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,320
It's like your kryptonite.

786
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,740
You hearing me, David?

787
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,660
Audrey?

788
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:18,490
Gotcha. Come on.

789
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,970
Audrey. Audrey.

790
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,810
Hey!

791
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,780
You'll be okay.

792
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,660
What-- What happened?

793
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:01,700
I thought I was--
I thought I was dead.

794
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,740
Me too.

795
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,210
Is she all right?

796
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:12,630
I think her leg's broken.

797
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:15,300
Are you hurt?

798
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,590
Hey, man, are you hurt?

799
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,000
Hello.

800
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,880
I wasn't injured in that caraccident.

801
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,590
David.

802
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:58,220
I've never been injured, Eliijah.

803
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,850
What am I supposed to do?

804
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:11,650
Go to where people are.

805
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,770
You won't have to look very long.

806
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,320
It's all right to be afraid, David...

807
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:23,490
because this part won't be
like a comic book.

808
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:28,450
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes
that were drawn for it.

809
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:10,710
There's one in the first row.
It's-- It's the second one.

810
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,670
Yes. It's the second one over.

811
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,990
Go back to Africa!

812
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,550
Hey, what's your name?

813
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:15,440
I think you drank too much.

814
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:03,110
Can I come in?

815
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:05,740
Who are you?

816
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,570
I like your house.

817
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,660
Can I come in?

818
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,990
What is this?

819
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:17,920
No, you can't come in.

820
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,500
Are you sure?

821
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,880
What are-- What are you--

822
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,030
It's okay.

823
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,370
It's okay. It's okay.

824
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:53,650
I had a bad dream.

825
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:01,700
It's over now.

826
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:32,570
I don't know.

827
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:34,690
I can't believe you'd think that.

828
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:36,780
I'm just asking you.

829
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:42,280
I'm making French toast.

830
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,260
I've been thinking about Elijah Price.

831
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,350
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, okay?

832
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,440
Okay?

833
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:15,940
Okay.

834
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,140
You were right.

835
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:19,820
This is one of Johann Davis'
earliest drawings.

836
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:22,320
See the villain's eyes?

837
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,610
They're larger than
the other characters'.

838
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:30,240
They insinuate a slightly skewed
perspective on how they see the world--

839
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:33,660
just off normal.

840
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:36,040
He doesn't look scary.

841
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:38,630
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son.

842
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,420
But he says there's always two kinds.

843
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:45,890
There's the soldier villain
who fights the hero with his hands...

844
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:50,310
and then there's the real threat--
the brilliant and evil archenemy...

845
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:52,850
who fights the hero with his mind.

846
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:54,940
Are you Elijah's mother?

847
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:58,810
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

848
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:01,650
Nice to meet you. I'm David Dunn.

849
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,740
He's spoken ofyou.

850
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,820
Says you're becoming friends.

851
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:08,320
We are.

852
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:10,660
Looks like he's doing good today.

853
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:14,710
I'm very proud of him.

854
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:17,880
He's come through a lot in his life--

855
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:21,460
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.

856
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:24,670
Mm-hmm. They were bad...

857
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,390
but he made it.

858
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:30,430
Yes, he did.

859
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,810
He's kind of a miracle.

860
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:37,940
Yes, he is.

861
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,190
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

862
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:49,280
We'll work something out.
Always able to work something out.

863
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:16,310
It has begun.

864
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,610
Tell me something, David.

865
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:27,280
When you woke up this morning,
was it still there?

866
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,200
The sadness?

867
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,280
No.

868
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,910
I think this is where we shake hands.

869
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:00,980
- Look!
- Did you see it?

870
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,870
I worked in that building 25 years.

871
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:15,120
I know all its secrets.

872
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:18,540
Secrets?

873
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,880
Like if there ever was a fire
on floors one, two or three...

874
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,510
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.

875
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:37,220
Passengers aren't allowed in there.

876
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,980
Do you know what
the scariest thing is?

877
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:29,940
To not know your place
in this world...

878
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:32,610
to not know why you're here.

879
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,870
That's--

880
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,120
That's just an awful feeling.

881
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,830
What have you done?

882
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,040
I almost gave up hope.

883
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:51,340
There were so many times
I questioned myself.

884
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:54,010
You killed all those people.

885
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:58,140
But I found you.

886
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:01,470
So many sacrifiices...

887
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,600
just to find you.

888
01:41:04,730 --> 01:41:06,690
Jesus Christ!

889
01:41:16,610 --> 01:41:19,370
Now that we know who you are...

890
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:23,250
I know who I am.

891
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:29,040
I'm not a mistake.

892
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:32,670
It all makes sense.

893
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:37,340
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?

894
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:40,810
He's the exact opposite of the hero.

895
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:44,680
And most times, they're friends,
like you and me.

896
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:48,600
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?

897
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:50,650
Because of the kids.

898
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:03,290
They called me Mr. Glass.
