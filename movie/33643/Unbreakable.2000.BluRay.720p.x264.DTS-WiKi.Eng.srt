My husband was
a star athlete in college,

683
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:58,002
and we were
in an accident together.

684
00:51:58,127 --> 00:51:59,461
Our car flipped
on an icy road,

685
00:51:59,545 --> 00:52:00,462
and we were both injured,

686

football any more.

And if that
hadn't happened,

we probably wouldn't
have been together.

spend my life

695
00:52:23,152 --> 00:52:24,069

who played football.

696
00:52:24,153 --> 00:52:27,239

that simple.

l was in awe of the way
he played it,

701
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:35,539
but football,
in many ways,

702
00:52:35,664 --> 00:52:38,834

of what l do.
