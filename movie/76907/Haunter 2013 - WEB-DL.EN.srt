1
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,713
<i>Lisa</i>

2
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:03,614
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

3
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:04,782
<i>Lisa!</i>

4
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:07,117
<i>Me and Edgar found
the pirate treasure.</i>

5
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,119
<i>Meet us down in the secret cave.</i>

6
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,922
<i>We're gonna spend all
Sunday morning...</i>

7
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,513
Hey, watch out for blinky, okay?

8
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,339
He always traps
you on your left.

9
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,173
Don't!

10
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,944
Lisa, you messed up my game!

11
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:08,312
Here's your walkie.

12
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,214
Stop waking me up with it, brat.

13
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:11,682
Edgar left it, not me.

14
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:13,717
Well, tell Edgar  he's annoying.

15
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,685
You tell him.

16
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:16,320
He's your imaginary friend.

17
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,554
He's not imaginary.

18
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:20,824
Lisa, go down to the basement and
start the laundry, will you?

19
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:22,292
I did it yesterday,

20
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:24,495
you just don't
remember me doing it.

21
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,263
Stop being a smart aleck.

22
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:28,832
Buster brown, where's
your glasses?

23
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,267
I lost them.

24
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:31,901
Well, find them, pronto.

25
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:34,705
Lisa, have you decided where we're
gonna go for your birthday tomorrow?

26
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:36,039
Ask me tomorrow.

27
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,707
Okay. Well, I hope we get there,

28
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,477
'cause the car's not running.
Your dad's been trying to fix it all day.

29
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,346
He won't fix it.

30
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,347
Laundry, please.

31
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,682
Cold water only. The hot
wears out the clothes.

32
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,017
I don't think it's possible

33
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,285
for our clothes to wear out,

34
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:49,219
ever.

35
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:50,554
Cold water.

36
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,260
Lisa.

37
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:44,341
Not a smart idea to go anywhere
today, pal, with all this fog.

38
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:47,344
Stay inside, okay?

39
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,346
Play some games with Robbie or

40
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:50,681
practice your clarinet.

41
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:52,238
I'm sure everyone else
in the neighborhood

42
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:53,647
is staying inside today, too.

43
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:55,352
Even the phones are out.

44
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:00,056
Something wrong Lis?

45
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,358
Hmm?

46
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,959
No.

47
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:03,560
No.

48
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:05,095
Everything's fine.

49
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:09,466
I mean, you wouldn't
believe me anyway so...

50
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:20,668
<i>This is the story of Peter
and the wolf.</i>

51
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,347
<i>Early one morning, Peter opened</i>

52
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:27,417
<i>the gate and went out into
the big, green meadow.</i>

53
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:34,057
Lisa!

54
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,992
Come downstairs, will you?

55
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:39,062
Your father and I
want to have a talk.

56
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:45,169
Your mom says

57
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:48,272
you've been acting kind of
funny all morning.

58
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,975
Funny how?

59
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,143
Well, for one thing,

60
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,245
some clothes are missing
from the laundry.

61
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,447
Do you know where they are?

62
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,984
Honestly, I really don't know

63
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,688
where they went.

64
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,560
The truth is, they're
gone every day.

65
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:14,464
And what does that mean,
"gone every day"?

66
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,103
Okay,

67
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:18,769
it's like mom's pancakes.

68
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,137
Every morning, she makes them

69
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,605
for breakfast, and you're always

70
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:23,106
trying to fix the car, which for

71
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:25,676
some mysterious reason has
always stopped running.

72
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,577
Then, Mac and cheese for lunch.

73
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:31,948
Then, we have meat loaf
for dinner every night.

74
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,884
And at 8:00, we watch,

75
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,585
"murder, she wrote" and go to

76
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:41,058
bed, wake up tomorrow, and
do the exact same thing.

77
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,190
Well, you and Robbie have school
tomorrow, and I have work, so...

78
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,762
There is no school.

79
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:47,030
There is no work.

80
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,833
And what about your birthday?
That's not tomorrow either?

81
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:50,900
No.

82
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:52,402
Never comes.

83
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:55,038
It's always the day
before I turn 16.

84
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,907
It's pretty frustrating.

85
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,209
I'm really trying to

86
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,211
understand where this is
all coming from, pal.

87
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,047
Are... are you bored
with your life?

88
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:04,948
Is that it?

89
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,917
I mean, are you anxious
about something?

90
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,386
- Is it a boy?
- No, no, mum! God, no!

91
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,621
You just don't understand it,
like, at all!

92
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:12,789
Well, explain it to us.

93
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,857
Maybe we can understand.

94
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,360
That's the thing,

95
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:18,228
is that I have tried to
explain it many times,

96
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,931
and you guys just never remember
and you don't believe me.

97
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:23,434
Believe what?

98
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:25,802
That we're stuck in this house

99
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:28,438
and we're never gonna leave.

100
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,473
Why?

101
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:30,440
Because all of us...

102
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,142
Shut up, Lisa, shut up!

103
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:34,144
Enough is enough, Lisa!

104
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:36,012
Shh.

105
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:36,847
Hey, hey.

106
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,248
It's okay, buckaroo.

107
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:38,682
Shh.

108
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:40,851
Your sister is just
playing a silly game.

109
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:45,188
Lisa, you tell your brother
that everything is okay.

110
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,159
Lisa?

111
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:52,229
I'm gonna go finish playing
the clarinet in my room.

112
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:56,666
Let me know when the Mac
and cheese is ready.

113
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:37,507
<i>Safe-deposit key...</i>

114
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:40,710
<i>is that what you were looking
for, captain downing?</i>

115
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:42,704
<i>Or should I say, Mr. downing</i>

116
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,915
<i>or whatever your name is?</i>

117
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,265
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

118
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,591
<i>Me and Edgar found
the pirate treasure.</i>

119
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:56,526
<i>Meet us down in the secret cave.</i>

120
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:58,895
<i>We're gonna spend all
Sunday morning there.</i>

121
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,123
Lisa?

122
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:35,766
Go downstairs to the basement
and start the laundry, will you?

123
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,601
I did it yesterday.

124
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:39,369
You just don't
remember me doing it.

125
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,770
Stop being a smart aleck.

126
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:42,806
Hey, Charlie brown,
where's your glasses?

127
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,040
I don't know.

128
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,942
Well, find them, pronto.

129
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:49,045
Lisa, have you decided where we're
gonna go for your birthday tomorrow?

130
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,347
Ask me tomorrow.

131
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:53,016
Well, I hope we get there,
because the car's not running.

132
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:55,118
Your dad's been trying
to fix it all day.

133
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,586
Laundry, please.

134
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:57,754
Cold water only.

135
00:09:57,756 --> 00:10:00,357
Hot wears out the clothes.

136
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,825
Thank you.

137
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:22,658
<i>Thank you, and welcome to the
white house.</i>

138
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,375
<i>In a moment, I will be</i>

139
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,244
<i>sitting at that desk,</i>

140
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:28,812
<i>taking up a pen
and signing the most</i>

00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:34,417
<i>To all of you here today,</i>

144
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:36,086
<i>who've worked so hard and long</i>

145
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:37,821
<i>to see this day come, my thanks.</i>

146
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,190
<i>And the thanks of a
nation go out to you.</i>

147
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,127
<i>They haven't made this the
freest country and the mightiest</i>

148
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:46,897
<i>economic force on this planet
by shrinking from challenges.</i>

149
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,398
<i>They never gave up.</i>

150
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,468
<i>And after almost 3 years of
commitment and hard work...</i>

151
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,475
<i>"The impossible became
the inevitable."</i>

152
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:03,380
<i>Early one morning,</i>

153
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,448
<i>Peter opened the gate and went out</i>

154
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,950

00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:15,675
<i>Lisa</i>

156
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,757
Did you wash everything
in this load?

157
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,992
Some clothes are missing.

158
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:50,026
Yeah, I know.

159
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:51,727
So, where are they?

160
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,662
I don't know, mom. Okay?

161
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,664
Those clothes are missing,
like, every single day.

162
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:57,333
Come downstairs, will you?

163
00:12:57,335 --> 00:13:00,770
Your father and I
want to have a talk.

164
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:10,648
Your mom says

165
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:13,686
you've been acting kind
of funny all morning.

166
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,760
<i>...Captain downing?</i>

167
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,063
<i>Or should I say, Mr. downing?</i>

168
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,359
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

169
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,461
<i>Me and Edgar found
the pirate treasure.</i>

170
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:40,597
<i>Meet us down in the secret cave.</i>

171
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:43,433
<i>We're gonna spend all
Sunday morning there.</i>

172
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:48,011
Lisa?

173
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,633
Sweetheart, pancakes are ready!

174
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:31,877
<i>And...</i>

175
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:34,537
<i>We're in focus.</i>

176
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:36,806
<i>Okay.</i>

177
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:40,943
<i>Our new home.</i>

178
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:52,888
<i>We're in focus. Okay.</i>

179
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,594
<i>Our new home.</i>

180
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:04,667
<i>We're in focus.</i>

181
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:06,169
<i>Our new home.</i>

182
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:10,339
Who are you?

183
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:48,063
Hello?

184
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,788
Is anybody here?

185
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,986
Was that you playing
the clarinet?

186
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,288
Are you trying to contact me?

187
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,574
Are you dead?

188
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,537
Are you... Alive?

189
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,739
Lisa?

190
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:30,586
What?

191
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:32,221
What are you doing up there?

192
00:20:32,223 --> 00:20:32,688
Nothing.

193
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,857
Some clothes are missing
from the laundry.

194
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,192
Do you know where they are?

195
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,426
No.

196
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:38,728
Well, they went somewhere.

197
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,296
Okay, just give me a second.

198
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,030
Well, Bruce, if you get the
car fixed, I'd love it if you

199
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,431
could go and get a few groceries.

200
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:15,965
Okay.

201
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,033
Well, I'm working on it.

202
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,234
So I have no idea where to start
with it,

203
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,636
but I am working on it.

204
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,805
Mom, can I go play with Edgar?

205
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:25,441
What about chocolate
ice cream for dessert?

206
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:28,344
Me and Edgar will both
have double scoops.

207
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:31,314
No. You will each
have one scoop.

208
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:33,716
Go ahead, Mr. Magoo.

209
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:36,385
Lisa, you haven't even touched
your meat loaf.

210
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:38,721
Meat is murder.

211
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,826
What's the matter, Lis?

212
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,077
Since when do you smoke?

213
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:53,903
Sorry?

214
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:56,438
That's not part of the routine.

215
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,341
I've never seen
you smoke before.

216
00:21:58,343 --> 00:21:59,675
Your father always smokes

217
00:21:59,677 --> 00:22:01,877
after dinner, but he's gonna quit.
Right, Bruce?

218
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:03,279
Absolutely.

219
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:05,448
A scoop for you tonight, honey?

220
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,351
- What's wrong with two scoops?
- God, you're as bad as Robbie.

221
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:10,386
One or two scoops for you, Lisa?

222
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,930
Where's dad and Robbie?

223
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:33,977
Uh, your father is in the
garage fixing the car, and

224
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,879
Robbie's up in his room
playing video games.

225
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,815
What about "murder, she wrote"?

226
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:42,518
Oh, sweetheart, do you
mind watching it upstairs?

227
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,755
I just... I really want
to finish this chapter.

228
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,636
I know. I know, I know.

229
00:23:00,638 --> 00:23:02,104
See if I can get this
son of a bitch working.

230
00:23:02,106 --> 00:23:03,005
I don't know.

231
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,741
I don't know why it won't work.

232
00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:07,677
I just don't.

233
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,815
Lisa?

234
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:16,118
Go to back inside, Lisa.

235
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,589
I got a lot of work here to do.

236
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,426
Go on.

237
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:26,628
You, uh, go ahead, sweetheart.

238
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,664
Good night.

239
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:31,269
Good night, dad.

240
00:24:23,598 --> 00:24:25,598
<i>Lisa.</i>

241
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:28,257
Who are you?

242
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:32,294
Why are you here?
What do you want?

243
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:35,397
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

244
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,670
Get away!

245
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:01,677
<i>Lisa... Lisa, are you there?</i>

246
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:02,850
<i>Wake up, please.</i>

247
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,494
<i>Something's wrong. I'm hiding.</i>

248
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:07,496
<i>Come downstairs quick.</i>

249
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:11,967
Bruce, stop it!

250
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,569
Stop it!

251
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:14,570
What?

252
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:15,571
Stop it!

253
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:19,775
Then tell me where they are.

254
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:22,146
I have no idea.

255
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:29,051
You stole them from me.

256
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:31,053
Why would I do that, Bruce?

257
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,055
You stole them.

258
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:34,823
Stop lying!

259
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:37,593
Mom?

260
00:25:37,595 --> 00:25:40,263
Dad?

261
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,331
Lisa, go upstairs.

262
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,567
Take Robbie with you.

263
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:49,138
Do you know where the
spark plugs are, Lisa?

264
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,307
The... the what?

265
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:54,777
I have been trying to fix the

266
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:58,314
car all morning, and I've now

267
00:25:58,316 --> 00:26:00,983
discovered that it's just the

268
00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:02,184
spark plugs.

269
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,620
They're missing from the engine.

270
00:26:04,622 --> 00:26:07,189
Somebody's taken them.

271
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:11,060
Was it you?

272
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:12,828
Was it you?!

273
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,733
No.

274
00:26:17,735 --> 00:26:18,767
No, dad.

275
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:21,203
I don't know what
you're talking about.

276
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:43,435
- Mom, no, don't answer it.
- Why not?

277
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,228
Please. Please, mom, don't.

278
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,331
Lisa, I am not gonna shut out
the rest of the world just

279
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,634
because your father
gets upset sometimes.

280
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:07,041
Good morning, ma'am.
I'm from the phone company.

281
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:10,019
We're checking the lines
in the neighborhood today.

282
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:11,987
Has your phone been
out this morning?

283
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:13,422
Well, yes, in fact, it has.

284
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:16,358
We get a lot of static
because of the fog.

285
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,393
I'm terribly sorry for
the inconvenience.

286
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:20,729
Do you mind if I come
in and check the Jacks?

287
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:22,998
Yes, of course.

288
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:16,255
Well, it looks like you folks
got quite a mess on your hands,

289
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,489
down here.

290
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:23,625
I'll check upstairs first.

291
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:38,679
Lisa? Laundry.

292
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:41,912
Cold, not hot.

293
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:46,315
Lisa, do what your mother says.

294
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:50,052
I... I forgot something in my room.

295
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:54,790
I'll... I'll be
back in a minute.

296
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,667
How long have you been awake?

297
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:38,192
What?

298
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,770
How long have you known,

299
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:45,107
understood?

300
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:47,709
Um...

301
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,977
I don't... I don't know.

302
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:52,347
Um, a... a week, maybe.

303
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:54,349
I... I'm not sure.

304
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:01,290
Who are you?

305
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:02,799
What's going on? What...

306
00:30:02,825 --> 00:30:04,951
What happened to us?
I...

307
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:25,132
Whenever you hear strange
noises in this house,

308
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:29,084
or voices calling out
to you, ignore them.

309
00:30:29,086 --> 00:30:32,121
Pretend they don't exist, Lisa.

310
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,422
If you should try to contact 
the living,

311
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:37,226
or anyone else,

312
00:30:37,328 --> 00:30:39,428
you and your family 
will suffer in ways

313
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,498
you cannot fathom.

314
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:01,517
Have yourself a wonderful day.

315
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:03,418
Okay, thank you.

316
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:09,994
So, Lisa, you gonna start the
laundry?

317
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,700
Did you put something different
in the meat loaf tonight, honey?

318
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:19,301
'Cause it's... it's fantastic.

319
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:21,003
I put a little bit
of paprika in it.

320
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,004
That might have done it.

321
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:24,039
Mom, can I go play with Edgar?

322
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:27,510
What about chocolate
ice cream for dessert?

323
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,180
Me and Edgar will both
have double scoops.

324
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,315
No, you and Edgar will each

325
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:34,516
have one scoop.

326
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:38,520
Go ahead, yosemite Sam.

327
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,490
Lisa, you haven't even
touched your meat loaf.

328
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,228
Ah.

329
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,063
That was amazing.

330
00:31:49,499 --> 00:31:50,899
Where's your cigarette?

331
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:51,900
I'm sorry?

332
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:54,803
Don't you always
smoke after dinner?

333
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:56,405
I don't know what you're
talking about, Lisa.

334
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:57,172
I don't smoke.

335
00:31:57,174 --> 00:31:59,074
Don't you start
either, young lady.

336
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:01,410
The surgeon general just came
out with a warning that if...

337
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:02,811
Wait. How... how can you just act

338
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:05,748
like nothing even
happened this morning?

339
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,485
This morning?

340
00:32:09,587 --> 00:32:12,550
Are you talking about the clothes
that are missing from the laundry?

341
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,523
Do you know where they are?

342
00:32:18,825 --> 00:32:20,095
Have you decided
where you want to go

343
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:21,296
for your birthday tomorrow?

344
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:23,899
Your father gets home at 6:00, so
I was thinking that we could just...

345
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,100
Sorry.

346
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:28,737
What?

347
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:31,006
I just... I can't do it anymore.

348
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:33,008
You can't do what?

349
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,876
I'm sorry.

350
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,380
Where are you going? You
haven't been excused, Lis.

351
00:32:42,082 --> 00:32:45,154
Lisa, where are you going?
It's not safe out there.

352
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,422
Lisa!

353
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,691
Lisa, stop! Come back here!

354
00:32:49,693 --> 00:32:51,960
Lisa!

355
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:54,162
Lisa!

356
00:32:58,364 --> 00:32:59,724
Hello?

357
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,389
Hey, is anyone out there?

358
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,641
Hello?

359
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:12,966
Hello?

360
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:17,986
Please I don't want to
be stuck here anymore.

361
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:21,891
You hear me? I said
I don't want...

362
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:24,792
There you are.

363
00:33:25,595 --> 00:33:26,561
Come on back inside, pal,

364
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:28,697
it's just not safe
riding out there.

365
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:31,099
Bring your bike back
into the garage.

366
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:33,268
You can then... Lisa!

367
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,527
Okay, no more games, young lady.

368
00:33:58,529 --> 00:33:59,461
Get inside now.

369
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:00,796
Mom's got dessert on the table,

370
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,598
and "murder, she wrote"
is just about to start.

371
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:18,216
Are you here?

372
00:34:19,718 --> 00:34:22,719
I'm sorry I told you to go away
last night.

373
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:27,524
I was just scared.

374
00:34:29,126 --> 00:34:33,128
I know it should be the other way around...
right?... Since...

375
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,465
You're the one who's alive and
I'm the one who's... Dead?

376
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:41,269
God, it feels weird
just saying that.

377
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:44,338
I don't know how I died or why
or...

378
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,112
How long I've been stuck in this
stupid routine with my family.

379
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:55,484
It's kind of like we've been sleepwalking
for a really long time, but...

380
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:57,452
Now I'm awake.

381
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:10,327
There's someone else here, too.

382
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,637
He's dead like me, I think.

383
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:24,813
He doesn't want me to be awake
or aware.

384
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:29,217
He told me not to contact you.

385
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:33,221
But I need to find a way out of
here, and you're the only hope

386
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:36,191
I've got to figure it out, so...

387
00:35:37,393 --> 00:35:39,829
Please.

388
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:43,367
Please just talk to me.

389
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:48,169
Who are you?

390
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,571
What's your name?

391
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:05,688
What's the first
letter of your name?

392
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,190
You have to move the piece to
the first letter.

393
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:19,934
Just move it anywhere.

394
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:25,907
Just say something!

395
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,310
Lisa?

396
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,112
Help me, Lisa.

397
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:12,513
Please help me.

398
00:38:16,386 --> 00:38:17,385
Olivia?

399
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:18,553
What are you doing in there?

400
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:21,389
Look under the floor.

401
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:23,058
Olivia, what's happening?

402
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,593
You okay?

403
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,094
Open the door.

404
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,629
Olivia!

405
00:38:49,905 --> 00:38:51,589
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

406
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:52,520
<i>Lisa!</i>

407
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:54,889
<i>Me and Edgar found
the pirate treasure.</i>

408
00:38:54,891 --> 00:38:57,058
<i>Meet us down in the secret cave.</i>

409
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,195
<i>We're gonna spend all
Sunday morning there.</i>

410
00:43:15,585 --> 00:43:17,387
Hello?

411
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,090
Help me.

412
00:43:49,852 --> 00:43:51,386
Lisa!

413
00:43:51,788 --> 00:43:54,255
Sweetheart, pancakes are ready.

414
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,125
Come and help set
the table, please.

415
00:43:58,828 --> 00:44:00,929
You know this is
homemade syrup, huh?

416
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:01,930
Homemade syrup?

417
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,032
What, you tap the trees
in the backyard?

418
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:06,367
No, Bruce.

419
00:44:08,169 --> 00:44:09,070
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm?

420
00:44:09,072 --> 00:44:11,272
Edgar wants more pancakes.

421
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,041
Ask and Edgar shall receive.

422
00:44:25,087 --> 00:44:26,487
Phones are working again.

423
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:28,823
I've got it.

424
00:44:34,927 --> 00:44:36,264
Hello.

425
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:38,332
Yes.
Can I ask who's calling, please?

426
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,036
Certainly.

427
00:44:42,038 --> 00:44:43,371
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

428
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:44,205
Just a sec.

429
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:46,741
Lis, it's a Mr. woods. 
He says there's been some

430
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:48,442
changes to your lab assignment.

431
00:44:48,444 --> 00:44:49,844
He wants to talk to you about it.

432
00:44:51,747 --> 00:44:53,281
Lise, come on. Don't
keep him waiting.

433
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:56,250
I'm sure he's got lots of other
students he's got to call.

434
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:19,391
Lis, take the phone.

435
00:45:22,116 --> 00:45:24,116
Goodness sakes.

436
00:45:31,014 --> 00:45:33,914
<i>I thought I told you to mind
your own business.</i>

437
00:45:34,124 --> 00:45:36,992
<i>You are a busy Betty,</i>

438
00:45:36,994 --> 00:45:39,560
<i>and I don't like busy betties.</i>

439
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:44,098
What's down in that room
under the basement?

440
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,733
Who's down there?

441
00:45:45,735 --> 00:45:48,435
I mean, that's your scrapbook
under my bedroom floor, isn't?

442
00:45:48,438 --> 00:45:50,304
<i>This is my house, Lisa.</i>

443
00:45:50,306 --> 00:45:51,739
<i>It always has been.</i>

444
00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:53,374
Why are you keeping us here?

445
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:56,511
<i>Stop opening doors that
are meant to be closed.</i>

446
00:45:56,581 --> 00:45:57,713
Why?

447
00:45:58,015 --> 00:46:01,282
What are you gonna do to me?
I'm already dead.

448
00:46:01,284 --> 00:46:02,416
Lisa.

449
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:04,418
Come and finish your
breakfast, please.

450
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,621
It's gonna get cold.

451
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:32,302
Mom, can I go play with Edgar?

452
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:33,314
Okay.

453
00:46:33,316 --> 00:46:34,849
Finish your pancakes first.

454
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:35,983
You get away from him!

455
00:46:35,985 --> 00:46:37,819
Lisa, no! He's my friend!

456
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:39,120
Lisa, what are you doing?

457
00:46:39,122 --> 00:46:40,455
Don't you see him?!

458
00:46:40,457 --> 00:46:41,489
See who?

459
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:43,424
Edgar!

460
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,493
Lisa, stop teasing your brother.

461
00:46:45,495 --> 00:46:49,030
I'm not! He's right...

462
00:46:49,332 --> 00:46:51,031
Lisa.

463
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:54,171
They only see what I let them
see, Lisa, and so do you.

464
00:47:08,044 --> 00:47:10,092
Mom... Dad?

465
00:47:13,156 --> 00:47:14,522
Robbie?

466
00:47:19,362 --> 00:47:22,330
Oh, Robbie!

467
00:47:22,332 --> 00:47:24,465
No, no, no, Robbie!

468
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:26,234
Please wake up!

469
00:47:26,236 --> 00:47:28,636
Mom, dad, wake up.

470
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:29,871
Wake up!

471
00:47:29,873 --> 00:47:31,639
Please wake up.

472
00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:33,674
Oh.

473
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:40,114
Oh. Oh.

474
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:08,299
No!

475
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:13,381
No, no, please!

476
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:16,851
Please, I don't
want to be alone!

477
00:48:17,253 --> 00:48:19,954
I don't want to be
alone in this house!

478
00:48:19,956 --> 00:48:20,955
Please!

479
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:24,692
Please bring them back!

480
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:25,626
Please!

481
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:29,563
Lisa?

482
00:48:33,635 --> 00:48:35,702
Lis, what's wrong?

483
00:48:35,804 --> 00:48:36,570
Talk to me.

484
00:48:36,572 --> 00:48:38,772
Sweetheart, it's okay.

485
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:39,940
It's okay.

486
00:48:39,942 --> 00:48:41,975
Everything's all right.

487
00:48:41,977 --> 00:48:43,711
I got you, pal.

488
00:48:44,413 --> 00:48:46,413
I got you.

489
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:00,824
<i>Lisa.</i>

490
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,636
Leave me alone!
Please!

491
00:49:08,638 --> 00:49:10,238
This is all a mistake.

492
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:15,176
Things need to go back
the way they were.

493
00:49:17,113 --> 00:49:19,380
Go away!

494
00:50:17,502 --> 00:50:18,902
<i>Lisa.</i>

495
00:52:17,485 --> 00:52:19,985
Olivia, come play with me.

496
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,463
Olivia?

497
00:52:21,864 --> 00:52:23,430
We're having eggs and bacon,

498
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,999
so come help me set the table.

499
00:52:25,401 --> 00:52:27,801
How'd you sleep last night?

500
00:52:27,803 --> 00:52:30,170
No more sleepwalking, right?

501
00:52:31,174 --> 00:52:33,474
Your father.

502
00:52:39,479 --> 00:52:42,950
Come on.
I know, I know, I know.

503
00:52:43,152 --> 00:52:45,152
God damn it. I know.

504
00:52:45,154 --> 00:52:46,821
God, this son of a bitch.

505
00:52:48,023 --> 00:52:49,489
Oh, God.

506
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:51,624
Ah, I can't figure
out why it won't.

507
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,728
Come on, work.

508
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:55,830
Come on.

509
00:52:56,432 --> 00:52:58,299
I don't know, I don't know.

510
00:52:58,301 --> 00:52:59,967
Son of a bitch.

511
00:53:03,372 --> 00:53:05,772
Need something, Olivia?

512
00:53:09,544 --> 00:53:12,378
You need you to go
back inside, okay?

513
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,947
I'm busy.

514
00:53:15,384 --> 00:53:17,218
Come on.

515
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,186
Oh, come on.

516
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,822
Damn it!

517
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,992
I don't want you coming
in here when I'm working.

518
00:53:25,194 --> 00:53:26,593
You understand?

519
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:29,497
Do you understand?

520
00:53:29,899 --> 00:53:31,699
I said, get out!

521
00:53:40,577 --> 00:53:43,010
Lisa. Lisa. Oh, my God.

522
00:53:43,412 --> 00:53:46,212
Are you okay?

523
00:53:46,415 --> 00:53:47,614
What happened?

524
00:53:47,616 --> 00:53:50,017
I think she's sleepwalking.

525
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,385
I was standing in the kitchen,

526
00:53:51,387 --> 00:53:53,687
and she just walked right
past me and came in here.

527
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,956
Sweetheart, you okay?

528
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,495
- I think we should call a doctor.
- The phones are still out.

529
00:54:01,497 --> 00:54:03,430
Well, we should do
something, Bruce.

530
00:54:03,432 --> 00:54:06,233
Mom, I'm fine.

531
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:09,837
Can you just bring me
some Mac and cheese?

532
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,874
Yes, of course.

533
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,310
Okay pal...

534
00:54:16,312 --> 00:54:21,815
I'm gonna be down in the garage
if you need anything, all right?

535
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:23,651
Dad?

536
00:54:23,653 --> 00:54:25,619
Yeah?

537
00:54:25,621 --> 00:54:27,821
Did you find the spark plugs?

538
00:54:27,823 --> 00:54:29,657
The spark plugs?

539
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:32,959
That's why the car won't
start.

540
00:54:33,362 --> 00:54:35,195
Oh, uh, no.

541
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:39,267
I'm pretty sure it's
just an engine valve.

542
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:42,403
Don't worry, though, I'll have
it fixed before your birthday

543
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:45,473
tomorrow, and we'll all
have a great time.

544
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:48,609
You can pick any restaurant
you want to go to.

545
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:50,644
It'll be your special day.

546
00:54:53,846 --> 00:54:55,553
Lise, are you okay?

547
00:54:57,479 --> 00:54:59,219
How about we go to
hackney's tomorrow?

548
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:01,588
Uh-huh. You got a craving
for some onion rings.

549
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,892
Yeah and I'll... I'll get the
butterscotch sundae to share.

550
00:55:04,894 --> 00:55:06,794
You know my weakness, don't you?

551
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:09,564
Yeah, I think so.

552
00:55:11,466 --> 00:55:13,534
You get some rest, Lis.

553
00:55:14,336 --> 00:55:15,102
Love you.

554
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:19,673
Love you too, dad.

555
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:32,044
Olivia?

556
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:37,758
Olivia, can you hear me?

557
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,360
Olivia.
Olivia, where are you?

558
00:55:46,502 --> 00:55:47,701
I need you to bring me back.

559
00:55:47,703 --> 00:55:49,603
I need you to show me
everything that you...

560
00:55:50,106 --> 00:55:50,837
<i>Lisa.</i>

561
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:53,173
<i>Come in, Lisa, please.</i>

562
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,575
Robbie?

563
00:55:58,714 --> 00:55:59,713
<i>Hi, Lisa.</i>

564
00:55:59,715 --> 00:56:02,983
<i>Edgar says you need to be
punished for being bad.</i>

565
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:05,019
<i>He says you're a busy Betty.</i>

566
00:56:06,922 --> 00:56:08,555
Robbie where are you?

567
00:56:08,557 --> 00:56:10,090
<i>The secret cave.</i>

568
00:56:10,092 --> 00:56:11,425
<i>Edgar's with me.</i>

569
00:56:12,027 --> 00:56:14,294
<i>We're on a treasure hunt.</i>

570
00:56:15,264 --> 00:56:16,497
Where is the secret...

571
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:20,167
Robbie?

572
00:56:30,092 --> 00:56:32,192
Robbie?

573
00:56:37,447 --> 00:56:39,953
Robbie, are you in here?

574
00:56:49,832 --> 00:56:50,832
Robbie?

575
00:56:57,907 --> 00:57:00,007
Robbie?

576
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:16,423
Robbie?

577
00:57:19,948 --> 00:57:21,948
Robbie!

578
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:24,673
Robbie!

579
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:28,268
Oh!

580
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,270
Oh, my God.

581
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,573
<i>Lisa?</i>

582
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,474
Robbie.

583
00:57:34,476 --> 00:57:35,809
<i>Hi, Lisa.</i>

584
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:36,943
Robbie, where are you?

585
00:57:36,945 --> 00:57:38,912
You told me you were
in the secret cave.

586
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,180
<i>We tricked you.</i>

587
00:57:40,182 --> 00:57:40,981
What?!

588
00:57:40,983 --> 00:57:43,250
<i>I'm in the attic, Lisa.</i>

589
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:46,120
<i>I was hiding from
you the whole time.</i>

590
00:57:46,122 --> 00:57:48,188
<i>Edgar says we've won the game.</i>

591
00:57:48,991 --> 00:57:51,592
Robbie. Robbie?

592
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:54,461
Damn it!

593
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,632
Don't worry.

594
00:57:58,634 --> 00:58:00,234
I'll watch Robbie for you.

595
00:58:00,236 --> 00:58:01,969
No, no, no!

596
00:58:01,971 --> 00:58:03,537
No, no, no, no, no!

597
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:04,271
No, no!

598
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:06,840
Let me out of here,
you son of a bitch!

599
00:58:07,242 --> 00:58:09,209
Somebody help me, please!

600
00:58:09,211 --> 00:58:11,779
Please! No!

601
00:58:56,082 --> 00:58:57,082
Hello?

602
00:59:25,707 --> 00:59:26,707
Hello?

603
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:28,288
Okay.

604
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,101
Dad, is that you?

605
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,640
Hello?

606
01:00:34,957 --> 01:00:37,293
Did he get you, too?

607
01:00:39,995 --> 01:00:40,761
Who are you?

608
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:43,029
How long have you
been his prisoner?

609
01:00:43,831 --> 01:00:46,233
Oh, my God.

610
01:00:47,169 --> 01:00:47,902
You're...

611
01:00:47,904 --> 01:00:49,436
you're Frances Nichols.

612
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,139
You were the first
girl he kidnapped.

613
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,074
Who was he?

614
01:00:54,076 --> 01:00:56,477
Get away. I have to get this
door open before he comes back.

615
01:00:56,479 --> 01:00:58,879
No, please. Tell me who he was.

616
01:00:59,581 --> 01:01:02,082
Please tell me.

617
01:01:02,184 --> 01:01:03,283
Please.

618
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:04,818
I don't know his name.

619
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,688
I was walking home after
the movies last night.

620
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,856
He was closing up his store and

621
01:01:09,858 --> 01:01:11,959
asked if I needed a ride home.

622
01:01:12,261 --> 01:01:14,694
When I came closer, he grabbed me,

623
01:01:14,996 --> 01:01:17,363
put a cloth over my face.

624
01:01:17,365 --> 01:01:21,000
I passed out and woke
up here in his car.

625
01:01:21,002 --> 01:01:24,070
I was tied up in the back seat.

626
01:01:24,072 --> 01:01:26,472
And the engine was running.

627
01:01:26,675 --> 01:01:30,477
I thought I was gonna suffocate.

628
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:33,447
But... but you didn't?

629
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:36,449
Well, I'm talking
to you, aren't I?

630
01:01:36,451 --> 01:01:38,618
Aah!

631
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,687
Look, that man that kidnapped you,

632
01:01:40,689 --> 01:01:42,389
he's the reason that I'm
here, too,

633
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:44,224
and my family

634
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:46,293
and all the other girls
that were missing.

635
01:01:46,295 --> 01:01:48,461
He trapped us all in this house.

636
01:01:48,464 --> 01:01:50,463
He wants us to be asleep.

637
01:01:50,465 --> 01:01:52,332
That's how he controls us.

638
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,867
Quiet.

639
01:01:56,704 --> 01:01:58,704
Are you coming?

640
01:02:01,777 --> 01:02:03,710
There's nothing out there.

641
01:02:03,712 --> 01:02:05,512
Well, I've got to get home.

642
01:02:05,914 --> 01:02:07,347
My family's worried about me.

643
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:10,050
I've been gone all night.

644
01:02:10,052 --> 01:02:11,785
No, you've been gone much

645
01:02:11,787 --> 01:02:14,622
longer than that, Frances.

646
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:18,760
Your family has already
grieved over you.

647
01:02:18,761 --> 01:02:21,795
Then, they moved on with
the rest of their lives.

648
01:02:22,297 --> 01:02:24,597
Grieved over me?

649
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:33,299
You're wrong.
That can't be right.

650
01:02:33,808 --> 01:02:36,210
When I touched this,

651
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:37,544
we connected.

652
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:40,882
How did you get my ring?

653
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:44,184
After he murdered you,

654
01:02:44,186 --> 01:02:46,520
he dumped your body 
down below.

655
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:48,388
And then he burned you up...

656
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:51,725
Just like all the other girls.

657
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:54,094
He was a monster.

658
01:02:54,196 --> 01:02:57,798
And I am so, so sorry that you

659
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,333
had to go through that, Frances.

660
01:02:59,335 --> 01:03:01,401
I really, really am.

661
01:03:01,503 --> 01:03:04,104
But you have to wake up.

662
01:03:04,106 --> 01:03:06,740
We all do.

663
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:25,792
- Frances! No! 
- This is my house, Lisa!

664
01:03:29,198 --> 01:03:30,230
Lisa?

665
01:03:31,032 --> 01:03:34,701
Lisa, what are you
doing in here?

666
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:38,205
You're supposed to be upstairs
in your room, resting.

667
01:03:40,476 --> 01:03:41,007
Lisa!

668
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:42,576
I know what happened.

669
01:03:42,578 --> 01:03:44,511
Lisa, what are you doing?

670
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,046
Where is it?

671
01:03:46,048 --> 01:03:47,180
Lisa, stop it!

672
01:03:47,182 --> 01:03:48,949
Sweetheart, talk to me.

673
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:49,816
Lisa.

674
01:03:49,818 --> 01:03:52,819
It happened to us in the garage,
just like Frances and the others.

675
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:53,587
Lisa, stop it.

676
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:54,387
What happened?

677
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:55,589
What are you talking about?

678
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:58,224
Who's Frances?

679
01:03:59,862 --> 01:04:01,895
Oh, my God.

680
01:04:02,998 --> 01:04:05,700
It was dad.

681
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:12,272
And you... you let him do this!

682
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:14,040
What on earth are
you talking about?

683
01:04:14,042 --> 01:04:15,909
You didn't even do
anything to save us!

684
01:04:15,911 --> 01:04:16,643
Lisa, talk to me.

685
01:04:16,845 --> 01:04:19,679
Wake up, mom! Wake up!

686
01:04:20,582 --> 01:04:23,450
I won't let it happen again.

687
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:26,319
Never again!

688
01:04:51,844 --> 01:04:53,456
Robbie?

689
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:55,807
Where's Edgar?

690
01:04:55,884 --> 01:04:57,484
He left.

691
01:04:57,486 --> 01:05:01,453
Robbie, you do understand
that me,

692
01:05:01,455 --> 01:05:04,359
you, and mom and dad 
aren't alive anymore...

693
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,860
this isn't the real world?

694
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:07,627
Mm-hmm.

695
01:05:07,629 --> 01:05:09,162
When did you figure that out?

696
01:05:09,164 --> 01:05:11,164
This morning...

697
01:05:11,566 --> 01:05:14,234
After I found my glasses.

698
01:05:14,236 --> 01:05:15,902
Your glasses?

699
01:05:15,904 --> 01:05:17,704
They were under my pillow.

700
01:05:17,906 --> 01:05:21,107
I didn't want to find them
before, 'cause I was too scared.

701
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,711
Why would you be scared
of your glasses?

702
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:27,111
'Cause I was wearing
them that night...

703
01:05:27,137 --> 01:05:29,149
the night we all died.

704
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,918
Don't worry, Lisa,
it's gonna be okay.

705
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,453
We're just like pac-man.

706
01:05:33,455 --> 01:05:35,822
We play in the same maze 
over and over,

707
01:05:35,824 --> 01:05:37,123
and we can never die.

708
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:40,994
We're always in our house, 
and that's just how it's got to be.

709
01:05:40,996 --> 01:05:44,031
That's what Edgar told me.

710
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:21,737
Hi, Lisa.

711
01:08:21,823 --> 01:08:24,758
If you're watching this,
it means you made it back.

712
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,826
Or it means I'm crazy.

713
01:08:26,828 --> 01:08:29,162
Either way, I hope
you find this.

714
01:08:29,164 --> 01:08:32,632
The one thing I do
know is I'm scared.

715
01:08:32,634 --> 01:08:35,100
The man who lived here 
before you,

716
01:08:35,102 --> 01:08:37,403
was named Edgar mullins.

717
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:40,173
He was born in this house.

718
01:08:40,175 --> 01:08:43,610
He murdered all those
girls over the years.

719
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:46,546
And then he died here in 1983.

720
01:08:46,848 --> 01:08:49,516
My dad... he's changed.

721
01:08:49,718 --> 01:08:53,753
My mom's useless...
totally in denial.

722
01:08:54,155 --> 01:08:57,290
No one will believe
a word I say.

723
01:08:57,892 --> 01:09:01,294
I found this in the
garage last week.

724
01:09:01,896 --> 01:09:04,530
It's how we connected.

725
01:09:04,532 --> 01:09:05,998
It's yours, isn't it?

726
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,069
It belonged to you
before you died.

727
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:14,207
You're the only one who understands
what I'm going through.

728
01:09:14,909 --> 01:09:16,909
Help me, Lisa.

729
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:20,847
Help me save my family.

730
01:09:27,755 --> 01:09:28,822
Where are they?!

731
01:09:28,824 --> 01:09:29,622
David.

732
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:32,291
What are you looking for?
What are you looking for?!

733
01:09:33,027 --> 01:09:35,628
Okay, I know what you're doing.

734
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:36,830
I don't know what
you're talking about.

735
01:09:36,832 --> 01:09:38,564
- Olivia? 
- Where are they?

736
01:09:38,566 --> 01:09:39,599
I'm scared.

737
01:09:39,701 --> 01:09:41,667
- Where did you put them?! 
- What?!

738
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:43,969
- You know what I'm talking about!
- I don't.

739
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:48,074
David, stop please. Just stop.

740
01:09:48,076 --> 01:09:49,242
Where did you hide them?

741
01:09:49,244 --> 01:09:51,144
I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

742
01:09:51,146 --> 01:09:52,946
- Right! 
- What's wrong with you?

743
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:54,580
Why are you acting like this?!

744
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,318
Olivia, go back to your room.

745
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,954
Take your sister with you.

746
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,356
Olivia, please.

747
01:10:03,358 --> 01:10:04,991
Sweetheart.

748
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:06,526
Go upstairs.

749
01:10:06,628 --> 01:10:09,929
Do as your mother says, Olivia.

750
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,200
- You shouldn't be down here.
- No, no.

751
01:10:14,202 --> 01:10:15,301
Now, listen to me.

752
01:10:15,303 --> 01:10:16,436
Listen to me, okay?

753
01:10:16,438 --> 01:10:19,005
You need to get out
of this house.

754
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:20,540
Take your kids with you and

755
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:22,775
don't ever, ever come
back here again.

756
01:10:22,777 --> 01:10:23,910
Do you understand me?

757
01:10:23,912 --> 01:10:26,913
He is not your husband.

758
01:10:26,915 --> 01:10:29,215
She's, uh, confused.

759
01:10:29,717 --> 01:10:32,284
I think she was
sleepwalking again.

760
01:10:32,286 --> 01:10:33,419
He is lying to you.

761
01:10:33,421 --> 01:10:34,220
He is lying.

762
01:10:34,222 --> 01:10:36,489
He's taken over Olivia's father.

763
01:10:36,491 --> 01:10:38,658
Oh, I mean... God,
I mean my father.

764
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,592
Anne...

765
01:10:39,594 --> 01:10:41,461
You take care of Emily.

766
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:45,098
I am going to take Olivia
upstairs to her room.

767
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:45,965
No!

768
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:47,200
It's all right, Olivia.

769
01:10:47,302 --> 01:10:49,268
It's me.

770
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:50,303
It's dad.

771
01:10:50,305 --> 01:10:52,205
No!

772
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,490
Hey! Hey! Help!

773
01:11:10,592 --> 01:11:13,459
Help! Please call the police!

774
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,028
Help!

775
01:11:16,053 --> 01:11:16,830
Help!

776
01:11:16,931 --> 01:11:19,131
Oh! Oh!

777
01:11:27,309 --> 01:11:29,309
Silly girl.

778
01:11:32,314 --> 01:11:34,881
Don't you know a ghost can

779
01:11:34,883 --> 01:11:36,749
never leave its house?

780
01:11:48,754 --> 01:11:49,870
<i>Lisa.</i>

781
01:11:50,395 --> 01:11:51,895
Lisa.

782
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:55,768
Honey, wake up. It's okay.
Shhhh.

783
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,070
It's okay. It's okay.

784
01:11:57,072 --> 01:11:58,071
I'm right here.

785
01:11:58,373 --> 01:12:01,007
You've been out for a while...
a few hours.

786
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:04,577
You collapsed on the front lawn.

787
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:08,014
I thought that you were
sleepwalking again, but...

788
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:10,116
you weren't, were you?

789
01:12:10,518 --> 01:12:15,655
I mean, how could any of
us be asleep, since...

790
01:12:16,057 --> 01:12:18,057
We're dead?

791
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,259
I know.
I finally know.

792
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:28,701
I've woken up, too.

793
01:12:28,703 --> 01:12:31,104
But how?

794
01:12:31,106 --> 01:12:34,140
You told me that I
didn't try to save us.

795
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:37,577
But you were wrong.

796
01:12:37,879 --> 01:12:41,514
These are the clothes that have
been missing from the laundry.

797
01:12:42,116 --> 01:12:43,282
I packed them that night.

798
01:12:43,284 --> 01:12:45,217
They're yours and
mine and Robbie's.

799
01:12:45,219 --> 01:12:46,920
I was gonna sneak us out of 
the house

800
01:12:46,922 --> 01:12:50,390
in the middle of the night while
your father was asleep...

801
01:12:50,392 --> 01:12:53,793
'Cause I was afraid.

802
01:12:53,795 --> 01:12:57,697
I was afraid of
what he might do.

803
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:02,771
We never made it out of the
house that night, did we?

804
01:13:05,874 --> 01:13:07,607
Have you talked to dad?

805
01:13:07,609 --> 01:13:09,976
No.

806
01:13:10,378 --> 01:13:14,547
He's in that garage as if
nothing ever happened.

807
01:13:14,549 --> 01:13:16,049
- I'll go talk to him.
- No!

808
01:13:16,051 --> 01:13:16,582
Mom.

809
01:13:16,584 --> 01:13:17,183
No.

810
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:18,885
Mom, trust me.

811
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:21,988
It's okay.

812
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:24,957
All of us are safe now,

813
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:28,027
and the only thing left
for us to do is leave.

814
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:32,100
Dad is the last one who
needs to understand that.

815
01:13:34,402 --> 01:13:38,805
You tried to tell
me again and again.

816
01:13:38,807 --> 01:13:42,475
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

817
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,814
It's okay.

818
01:13:48,016 --> 01:13:49,782
I know what to do.

819
01:13:54,489 --> 01:13:55,521
Oh, hey, there, kiddo.

820
01:13:55,523 --> 01:13:56,522
How are you feeling?

821
01:13:56,824 --> 01:13:59,058
Where are the spark plugs, dad?

822
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,927
What do you mean?

823
01:14:00,929 --> 01:14:02,528
No one stole them.

824
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:05,631
You lost them on purpose.

825
01:14:05,633 --> 01:14:07,500
Lisa, I don't know what
you're talking about.

826
01:14:07,502 --> 01:14:09,202
You hid them from yourself.

827
01:14:10,605 --> 01:14:11,704
All right.

828
01:14:12,106 --> 01:14:14,073
Why would I do that?

829
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:16,843
Because you knew what
you were turning into.

830
01:14:16,845 --> 01:14:18,911
Now, where are they, dad?

831
01:14:19,113 --> 01:14:21,480
Deep down, you know.

832
01:14:44,974 --> 01:14:46,661
Take them out.

833
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:47,766
Why?

834
01:15:02,012 --> 01:15:04,112
Do you feel anything?

835
01:15:04,137 --> 01:15:06,137
Not a thing.

836
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:10,262
I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

837
01:15:10,664 --> 01:15:13,199
Put them back in the engine.

838
01:15:13,201 --> 01:15:15,968
All right, Lisa, I've had just
about enough of this nonsense.

839
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,171
The engine.

840
01:15:28,673 --> 01:15:30,057
Turn the key.

841
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:49,050
Dad?

842
01:15:49,776 --> 01:15:51,915
Do you remember?

843
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,309
Do you remember what
happened to us?

844
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,807
I used ether...

845
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:07,505
On you...

846
01:16:09,157 --> 01:16:13,559
And Robbie and your...

847
01:16:13,561 --> 01:16:17,797
and your mom.

848
01:16:17,799 --> 01:16:22,335
And then I carried you...

849
01:16:22,737 --> 01:16:26,339
Downstairs into here...

850
01:16:26,341 --> 01:16:29,008
From your bedrooms.

851
01:16:30,912 --> 01:16:34,614
And then I...

852
01:16:36,651 --> 01:16:38,050
And then you did what?

853
01:16:38,252 --> 01:16:40,786
God.

854
01:16:41,088 --> 01:16:43,656
Oh, God.

855
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:47,891
You and Robbie and mom...

856
01:16:47,893 --> 01:16:50,662
my whole family.

857
01:16:51,365 --> 01:16:54,066
What have I done?

858
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:55,034
No.

859
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:56,302
It wasn't you.

860
01:16:56,304 --> 01:16:57,837
Of course it was me!

861
01:16:57,839 --> 01:16:59,839
No, no, it was someone else.

862
01:16:59,841 --> 01:17:01,374
He got inside you.

863
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:02,942
He did this to us.

864
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:04,710
Who?

865
01:17:06,681 --> 01:17:07,680
Bruce!

866
01:17:07,682 --> 01:17:09,115
Bruce!

867
01:17:12,887 --> 01:17:14,620
Carol, I'm sorry.

868
01:17:14,622 --> 01:17:16,355
I'm so sorry.

869
01:17:16,357 --> 01:17:17,690
What's happening?

870
01:17:18,292 --> 01:17:21,860
We're awake... all of us.

871
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:24,630
Mommy, where are you?!

872
01:17:24,632 --> 01:17:27,133
I'm right here.

873
01:17:38,142 --> 01:17:40,746
What's going on?

874
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,650
We need to get out of this
house.

875
01:18:00,364 --> 01:18:02,564
Mommy, the sun's out!

876
01:18:04,007 --> 01:18:05,542
Robbie!

877
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:12,477
Carol!

878
01:18:15,202 --> 01:18:18,584
Carol! Robbie!

879
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:30,786
It's all right, sweetheart.
We can leave.

880
01:18:34,999 --> 01:18:36,799
Lis?

881
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:48,838
I love you, dad.

882
01:18:49,784 --> 01:18:52,018
I love all of you.

883
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,720
Lisa!

884
01:18:54,922 --> 01:18:56,855
Lis!

885
01:20:44,031 --> 01:20:47,130
Get out of my my house, Lisa.

886
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,440
<i>Where do you think
you're going, little butterfly?</i>

887
01:21:22,369 --> 01:21:25,105
<i>You cannot hide from
me in this house,</i>

888
01:21:25,107 --> 01:21:27,707
<i>and certainly not in
my own room.</i>

889
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:31,143
<i>I don't need your
company anymore.</i>

890
01:21:31,145 --> 01:21:33,045
<i>I don't need your family's.</i>

891
01:21:33,047 --> 01:21:36,215
<i>I got a new one to add
to my collection.</i>

892
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,553
Olivia!

893
01:21:41,155 --> 01:21:44,022
Olivia, where are you?

894
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,592
Olivia!

895
01:21:46,994 --> 01:21:48,994
Olivia, bring me back!

896
01:21:51,332 --> 01:21:53,899
Olivia!

897
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:57,704
Olivia, open this
door right now!

898
01:21:59,306 --> 01:22:01,673
Olivia!

899
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:07,775
Where are you, Olivia?

900
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:11,952
Silly girl.

901
01:23:12,285 --> 01:23:13,297
I'm here.

902
01:23:13,313 --> 01:23:16,181
I've got your things, so
listen to me, all right?

903
01:23:16,183 --> 01:23:17,883
Wake up.

904
01:23:18,185 --> 01:23:20,653
All of you, wake up.

905
01:23:25,655 --> 01:23:30,430
We can send this bastard to hell,
but we have to do it together.

906
01:23:44,434 --> 01:23:47,134
Frances... Please.

907
01:23:48,459 --> 01:23:50,983
Please. Help me.

908
01:23:57,258 --> 01:24:00,192
No one can help you now, Lisa.

909
01:24:00,194 --> 01:24:04,063
Shh. 
Just go to sleep.

910
01:24:04,065 --> 01:24:06,065
Go to sleep, now.

911
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:22,603
Hello, Lisa.

912
01:26:24,905 --> 01:26:28,507
You just won't let go
of Olivia, will you?

913
01:26:28,509 --> 01:26:30,976
Such a plucky girl.

914
01:26:31,378 --> 01:26:33,712
You know, you were the same way

915
01:26:33,714 --> 01:26:35,747
when you were alive.

916
01:26:36,049 --> 01:26:39,017
Trying to save your family from
me,

917
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:42,187
trying to fight the tide.

918
01:26:42,189 --> 01:26:45,390
And yet here we are,
the two of us,

919
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:48,727
and it ends the same.

920
01:26:52,299 --> 01:26:55,968
History doesn't repeat itself.

921
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:57,803
It rhymes.

922
01:27:02,909 --> 01:27:05,477
Time for you to go, Lisa.

923
01:27:55,754 --> 01:27:59,354
Go ahead, step across.

924
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:02,567
Your home is gone.

925
01:28:02,669 --> 01:28:05,203
Your time is gone.

926
01:28:05,205 --> 01:28:07,572
There's nothing left for you 
but oblivion...

927
01:28:07,774 --> 01:28:09,974
a place
worse than death.

928
01:28:09,976 --> 01:28:10,875
I don't care.

929
01:28:10,877 --> 01:28:13,145
You can send me wherever the
hell you want, but you're not

930
01:28:13,147 --> 01:28:14,713
killing this family tonight.

931
01:28:15,015 --> 01:28:16,382
You can't get the keys,

932
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:19,052
so you can't start the car.

933
01:28:22,656 --> 01:28:26,491
Olivia's father leaves the
spare on the workbench.

934
01:28:31,031 --> 01:28:32,565
No!

935
01:28:32,967 --> 01:28:34,867
No!

936
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:38,837
I always do enjoy killing you.

937
01:30:02,433 --> 01:30:04,633
Goodbye, Edgar.

938
01:30:10,558 --> 01:30:12,612
Aaaaaah!

939
01:30:19,637 --> 01:30:23,637
Aaaaaah!

940
01:30:38,618 --> 01:30:39,918
Olivia?

941
01:30:42,096 --> 01:30:44,663
What happened?

942
01:30:50,865 --> 01:30:55,365
- I'm so sorry, Olivia.
- It's okay, dad.

943
01:30:58,512 --> 01:31:02,147
We're gonna be a
happy family again.

944
01:31:21,449 --> 01:31:24,049
