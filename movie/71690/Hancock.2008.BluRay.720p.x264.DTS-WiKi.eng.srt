1
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:09,833
-=THE LAST FANTASY=-

3
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:46,033
All units, all units.
Code 3 pursuit of 2- 11.

4
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:48,700
White SUV heading east
on Alameda service road.

5
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,267
Suspects: Three Asian males.

6
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:51,967
HANCOCK

7
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:54,000
Be advised. Shots fired, shots fired.

8
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Cheryl, can you see how many
suspects are in this car?

9
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,000
As far as I can see at this point,
there are three sus...

10
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,867
Oh, this is just coming in.

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Hancock!

12
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:06,567
What, boy?

13
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,900
Bad guys.

14
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,533
Trying to cut them off.
You can see them there.

15
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,867
They have their hands
outside the white SUV...

16
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,633
...shooting randomly on the freeway.

17
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,867
What, you want a cookie?
Get out of my face.

18
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,033
Asshole.

19
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,033
- What?
- You heard me.

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,567
Please, stay off the freeway.

21
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:38,367
I understand that there are
three suspects in the white SUV...

22
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,167
Asshole.

23
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,467
Watch out!

24
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,900
Damn!

25
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,467
Damn it!

26
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
Hancock!?!

27
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,667
Beat it, 'Soulja Boy! '

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,833
Hancock is in the car...

29
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,533
...and he appears to be
negotiating with the gunmen.

30
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,067
He smells like a bar!

31
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,567
You pay for new roof!

32
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,567
Fellas, hey. I don't give a shit
what you did. I don't care.

33
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,467
Three guys in the car,
no girls, rave music.

34
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,133
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

35
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:20,800
But if you don't pull over
and give yourselves up quietly...

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,400
...I swear to Christ, your head
is going up the driver's ass.

37
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:29,033
His head is going up your ass.
And you drew the short stick...

38
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,667
...because your head
is going up my ass.

39
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Shoot this asshole!

40
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
Stop!

41
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,200
What the F%*#K?

42
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:59,567
The department is on their way.
There's just chaos here on the 105.

43
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,000
こんにちは(Konnichiwa)

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,300
What? I'm not Japanese, man!

45
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,533
Put us down!

46
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,967
Oh, now you "speaky Engly," huh?
"Speaky Engly" now?

47
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,667
You broke my glasses.

48
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,067
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!

49
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,367
- Put us down!
- You want down?

50
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
- Yes, please! Please!
- Help me!

51
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,633
I'm real good at down.
I'm real good at down.

52
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,133
All right? All right.

53
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:55,733
This, Hancock's latest act
of so-called heroics...

54
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,967
...took a hefty financial toll.

55
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:02,400
Initial damage estimates
are said to top $9 million...

56
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,767
...which, if accurate...

57
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,133
...represents a personal record...

58
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,467
...for the notoriously publicity-shy
Hancock...

59
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,533
...who, as usual,
can't be reached for comment.

60
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:18,533
With all the cracks to the concrete,
all the bullets, water damage, fires...

61
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,300
...L.A. Would be better off
if this guy would leave...

62
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,133
...and let us get on with our jobs.

63
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:58,733
Hi.

64
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,733
Don't think I'm crazy, okay?
We've looked everywhere for you.

65
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:06,567
Going to the Roxy
and the Viper Room and Jumbo's...

66
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:10,367
...anywhere we thought
you would be at. I found you.

67
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,967
I got you.

68
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,867
So, what's it like when you fly?

69
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,800
- No, what?
- I ain't gonna fly you.

70
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:26,433
I got a cousin, Narelle. She's my
best friend in the entire world...

71
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,900
...and I swear to God she would not
be here today if it wasn't for you.

72
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,900
She crashed her car up in Malibu
and you flew her to the hospital.

73
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,567
Remember?

74
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:38,600
I will break my foot off
in your ass, woman.

75
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
You got a car?

76
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,633
(Jiffypop)

77
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,100
Hey, want a drink?

78
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,167
So this is where you live.
This is your hideout.

79
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:17,933
Your Batcave.

80
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,967
Your Fortress of Solitude.

81
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:26,233
- It's a couple trailers I stuck together.
- What's all this?

82
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,033
- Jiffy Pop.
- Jiffy Pop.

83
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,833
- What do you do with it?
- Pop it.

84
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:36,000
Jiffy Pop, pop. I like that.

85
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Hold on.

86
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,867
Want me to give you
something else to pop?

87
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,067
- I didn't catch your name.
- Pop this, Superman.

88
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:46,700
Not much for the chitchat, huh?
Let me set this over here.

89
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,933
- All right. Now, there are some rules.
- Hello?

90
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:51,533
- No, I know, I haven't seen it yet.
- Excuse me.

91
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,733
I know, probably. All right, all right.

92
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,833
- Let me call you back.
- Listen.

93
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,767
You're gonna need to focus.
All right, I need you...

94
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,667
- Hey, that's... That's not focusing.
- What's in there?

95
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:06,900
Okay, all right, hold on.
Stop. Stop it. All right, now...

96
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,300
...when I get to the moment...
- The moment?

97
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,333
You know, the... Start climbing
the mountaintop, you know?

98
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,700
- You know... All right? Yes.
- Yeah.

99
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,533
You're gonna need to be as far away
from that as possible.

100
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,000
- Far. That's hot.
- No, that's not hot. It's not hot.

101
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,433
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

102
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,333
Hancock. Oh, yeah.

103
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,400
- Now you're doing too much.
- Hancock.

104
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,700
Oh, mountaintop! Mountaintop!

105
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,867
Mountaintop! Watch out!

106
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,667
Sorry.

107
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,567
That's not fair to anybody.

108
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,100
Thank you for being okay with that.

109
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,233
- I know it's...
- Can I use the bathroom, please?

110
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:22,700
Yeah. Hey, you...?
You want some Jiffy Pop?

111
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,300
- No, thanks.
- It's straight back.

112
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,800
- You all right?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,200
Yeah, I was trying to tell you.

114
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,267
Hey...

115
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:49,433
Listen... You know, if you want
I could fly you.

116
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,000
It's really beautiful, you know?
Earth.

117
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,233
You could see the...

118
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,067
Might have to get you a helmet,
so your face doesn't tear off.

119
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,833
What do you think?

120
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,833
Sir? Ray Embrey.

121
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,333
- Ray.
- Pleasure.

122
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,933
Ray's like the Bono of P.R.

123
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:01,200
Well, actually, I think Bono
is the Bono of P.R., but I do try.

124
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,033
Well, let's see it.

125
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:06,633
Okay. I'll get right into it.
Good morning, everyone.

126
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,333
I'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.

127
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,700
Okay? And we all know
the way that works.

128
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,667
You give one, maybe two percent
of your net cash...

129
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,967
and you get an armband or a ribbon or whatever.
It's nowhere near enough.

130
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:24,407
And that's why we at Embrey Publicity
would like to offer you...

131
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:27,133
...the AllHeart symbol.

132
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:32,900
Now, you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...

133
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:36,467
...to bear this logo on your product.

134
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,633
And what this would say
to the public...

135
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,700
...is that your company,
Pharmatopsis...

136
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,233
...has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.

137
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,333
Here's all you need to do to qualify.

138
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,433
Your new TB drug, Mycodin?

139
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:54,733
We would like for you to give
that product away for free.

140
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,000
- Did you say "free"?
- I did.

141
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,033
Only to those who need it.

142
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,600
Only to those who without it
would otherwise die.

143
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:11,733
As a concept, free is kind of up there
with, you know, lethal side effects.

144
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,400
- Mandatory product recall.
- Get indicted, go to jail.

145
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,433
Get out, work at IHOP
for the rest of your career.

146
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:20,033
Understandable reaction.
It's a radical concept.

147
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,567
But it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.

148
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,033
The brand...

149
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:29,800
...that everyone is talking about.

150
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,900
Who is "everyone"?

151
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,700
We do already have
a sports franchise.

152
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,900
- NFL? NBA? MLB?
- Soccer.

153
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,467
MLS? Which team?

154
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:43,700
Well, it's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.

155
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,333
It's my son's team.

156
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,567
Anyway, we can save the world.

157
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:54,067
All right?
Someone's just gotta go first.

158
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,700
What do you say?

159
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,933
Are you a crackpot?

160
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:12,600
Hey, hon. You're probably
at the store. I am on my way.

161
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,100
I think I made a connection.

162
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:18,467
Not really.

163
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,100
Listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming
and l... Damn it.

164
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,500
And I want some meatballs, okay?

165
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,400
I need some Spaghetti Madness.
I'll see you in about 20 minutes.

166
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,100
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?

167
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:33,833
Idiot.

168
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,267
Hey.

169
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,167
Hey. Hey!

170
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,500
Move it. There's a train coming.

171
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,933
Do you not hear that horn?

172
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,600
Let's go! I got a train!

173
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,533
Move it!

174
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:54,000
- Back your car up! There's a train!
- I can't go anywhere. Get out!

175
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,667
Son of a bitch!

176
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,767
Fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.

177
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,900
Get out!

178
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Get off the track! Move!

179
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:25,700
- Let's get him out.
- Get him out of there.

180
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,067
- Somebody help him.
- You all right?

181
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:30,967
Please, that guy's still in there.

182
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,633
You sure?

183
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,467
Get him out of there!

184
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,567
Will you look at that?

185
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:10,233
- Ah, shit.
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

186
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:11,733
All of you people...

187
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:15,067
...blocking the intersection...

188
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:16,900
...you're all idiots.

189
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,200
You threw the dude's car at her.
And what's with the train?

190
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,733
Why didn't you just go straight up
in the air with the car?

191
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,633
You've obviously injured
that poor woman.

192
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,867
- She's right. She should sue you.
- Yeah, she should sue you.

193
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:33,900
Well, you should sue McDonald's
because they fucked you up.

194
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,433
You're an asshole.

195
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,933
And I can smell
that liquor on your breath.

196
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,267
- Because I've been drinking, bitch.
- You're a drunk asshole!

197
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,300
- You think you're such a hero.
- Asshole!

198
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:50,600
- You're nothing but an asshole.
- We don't need you in this city.

199
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,600
Some superhero you are! Fly off!

200
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,067
Shut up!

201
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,970
Don't you understand? I'm alive.

202
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,633
I get to go home and see my family.
I should be dead right now, right here.

203
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,767
Yeah, he could've gone straight up.
Obviously, you should've.

204
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:10,833
You know, and I was upside down
for the train, but...

205
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,233
No. Thank you.

206
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,467
Thank you very much, Hancock.
Thank you.

207
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,933
Thank you, Hancock.

208
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,667
You're not flying by the Valley,
are you?

209
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,867
Throw the ball!

210
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,933
Monte, one guy'll line up here,
all right? Hike the ball.

211
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,267
This guy'll be right here
and he says, "Hut!"

212
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:43,100
This guy'll drop back. Hut!
Drop back. Chuck it.

213
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:46,867
Great. Thank you.

214
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,633
Nice aim. The driveway
would've been better, but...

215
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,633
- What's going on, Dad?
- Hey, buddy.

216
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,367
Daddy's had a little bit of a day.
Look at you, huh?

217
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:55,900
I want you to meet somebody.

218
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:59,467
This guy here, dragging
Daddy's car into the driveway.

219
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,067
- Who's this?
- Hancock.

220
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,500
That's right. Hancock,
this is my boy, Aaron.

221
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,333
- Ray, what happened to the car?
- Oh, boy.

222
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,200
You would not have believed it.

223
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:13,367
I came this close to getting hit
by a train. If it wasn't for that guy...

224
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:16,733
He saved my life. I mean...
Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.

225
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,800
Believe that? I almost kissed a train.

226
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,000
Saw my whole life
flash before my eyes.

227
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,700
- He saved your life?
- He sure did. Thank you.

228
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,533
- Hey, you good?
- I am good, yeah.

229
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:30,067
- All right. Keep it off the tracks.
- I will, definitely.

230
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:35,833
Hang on a... One second.

231
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:39,400
- Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food?
- Yeah.

232
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,900
- You like meatballs?
- No.

233
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Aaron, sweetheart,
he has to go and do...

234
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,367
I love meatballs.

235
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,333
Who's so busy
they can't have a meal?

236
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,000
And it's on us. Please.

237
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,633
I'm not even gonna take no
for an answer. Get inside the house.

238
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,367
Why do you have an eagle
on your hat?

239
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:22,267
Do you like eagles?

240
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,633
This guy's like a little
talking machine, huh?

241
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,767
We don't have a lot of guests
over here.

242
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,433
Look at that, huh?
Hon, is the heat on?

243
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,467
No? All right.

244
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,567
We started Spaghetti Madness
about two years ago.

245
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:40,433
We do it every Thursday, and we
have not missed a Thursday in...

246
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:41,833
- Ever.
- Yeah.

247
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:44,267
- Ever? That's a long time.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,433
- A very long time.
- That's some good meatballs, boy.

249
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,933
Aaron.

250
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,000
- Your mama's calling you.
- Yes, Mom?

251
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,500
No. His name is Aaron.

252
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,800
- Hey, Aaron, how was school today?
- Fine.

253
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,667
Yeah? No more problems
with that bully, Michael?

254
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,167
- Michel. But not like a girl's name.
- Michel. No, no, I know.

255
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,900
- It's French.
- Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this...

256
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,467
Hancock? Michel
is this neighborhood bully.

257
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,800
We've been trying to teach Aaron
a little...

258
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,667
...about conflict resolution.
You know what I mean?

259
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:18,533
- Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that?
- That's exactly right.

260
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:22,100
Well, just never turn that one,
all right?

261
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,633
Never let them punk you.

262
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,433
- Got it, Mr. Hancock.
- Aaron, eat.

263
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,100
The way you deal with bullies,
you take your right foot...

264
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,167
...bring it right up and catch him
in his little piss pump.

265
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,700
You don't have to do that,
honey, okay? Seriously.

266
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:35,943
It's a good idea.

267
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:37,300
You aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...

268
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:42,300
...for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.

269
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,900
Okay, please, just stop.

270
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,833
Michel is not a man, okay?

271
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,800
He's a little boy. And his parents...

272
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,500
...happen to be going through a bad
divorce. That's why he's acting up.

273
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,000
Maybe you don't know this...

274
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,300
...but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.

275
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
- Not everything has to be bang...
- I'm set.

276
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,500
...scream, blood, more blood.
- Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.

277
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,067
She watches so much news...

278
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,833
...that sometimes
it gets to be a little too much.

279
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,500
- You got a toilet?
- Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.

280
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:22,667
Did he just take the whiskey bottle
to the bathroom?

281
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:24,723
Do you want him to kill us all?

282
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,500
Thanks for coming on in.
Good, right?

283
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,833
- Very, yeah.
- Wanna say goodbye to him?

284
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:31,300
- Bye, Hancock.
- Hey, all right, little buddy.

285
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,567
- Are you okay?
- It was a joke.

286
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:38,267
- Come on, Aaron.
- Hey, sorry. I was just trying to...

287
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,140
He got it. She didn't get it.

288
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,433
I owe you.
You gave me my life back today.

289
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,667
Hear me out.
I'd like to return the favor.

290
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,567
Do you know what I do?
I'm in public relations.

291
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:51,367
You know what that is? Of course
you do. We're image consultants.

292
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:54,933
We change the way people see
products, companies,people, that stuff.

293
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:58,067
Listen, I see you on the news
and I see you out there today...

294
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:01,733
...and it can't feel good that people,
you know, hate you.

295
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,967
- It's good to meet you, Ray.
- No, I'm sorry.

296
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,367
But hear me out.

297
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:09,200
People... Don't get me wrong, they
should love you. They really should.

298
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,200
I wanna deliver that for you.
It's the least that I can do.

299
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:13,767
You know, you're a superhero.

300
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,967
Kids should ask you
for your autograph.

301
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,000
People should cheer you
on the streets.

302
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,067
What the hell are you pricks
looking at?

303
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:22,067
No, no, they're not... It's all right.

304
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:24,167
They're not pricks,
they're just people.

305
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,833
But I want you to give me
one short pitch, you know?

306
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:30,667
That's all I ask. Okay?

307
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,667
You use...

308
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,900
Put it under here?

309
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,433
Put it right there. Perfect.

310
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:40,467
E-mail me or whatever.
You just fly on over, I don't know.

311
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,067
I want you to think about it.

312
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:44,767
Just be careful when you go.
Sleep on it, all right?

313
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:47,067
You get back to me?

314
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,133
I'll be right here. All right.

315
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:53,800
Please don't stare, you guys.
He's kind of one of us.

316
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:01,023
What about AllHeart?

317
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:04,300
It's a nonstarter, babe, you know?
I'm chasing windmills with that.

318
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,633
Maybe I can't change the world
but I can change this guy's life.

319
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,467
- Think about all the good he can do.
- I think you're wasting your time.

320
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,367
You really hate him.

321
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:16,700
Hate? I don't hate him, Ray.
I don't even know the guy.

322
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:20,900
Just look at the news.
You can see what he does.

323
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,633
I think he just needs
people to care, you know?

324
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,367
You see the good in everybody, Ray.

325
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:31,533
Even sometimes when it's not there.

326
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,800
I have a feeling about this.
Don't work with this guy.

327
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,367
I know this kind of guy.
He breaks things.

328
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,600
Frankenstein

329
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,467
My bad. Everybody all right?

330
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:47,267
I'll go and get my mommy.

331
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,800
He is an asshole.

332
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:59,300
- What's your name, boy?
- Michel.

333
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:05,933
- You know who I am?
- My papa says you are an asshole.

334
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,867
Well, that's not really a nice word
to call a person, is it?

335
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,933
- Asshole?
- Yeah.

336
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:14,133
Because that could make someone
very angry...

337
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:16,533
...and, you know, maybe
hurt their feelings.

338
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:18,443
You behave like an asshole.

339
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:23,533
All right...

340
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:25,233
Do you know Aaron?

341
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:27,223
Wee, la petit asshole.

342
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,867
Well, seems to be a pretty good kid.

343
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:36,400
Just wanna ask you
to lay off of him a little bit.

344
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,267
Why, asshole?

345
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,133
- You're gonna stop calling me that.
- Asshole.

346
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:48,333
- That's not my name.
- Asshole.

347
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:54,833
Call me a asshole...

348
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,367
...one more time.

349
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,100
Asshole.

350
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,233
How about you, thickness?

351
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,040
Goggles?

352
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,000
Hancock! You son of a gun,
I knew you'd come.

353
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:14,567
Ask Mary. I had a feeling.

354
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,000
I said, he heard me
and he's ready for a change.

355
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,933
This is great. Did you do this?
You come in a little hot?

356
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:21,600
I'll meet you in the house.

357
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
- I know you don't drive, but...
- Oh, damn it, Ray.

358
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:30,467
All right. You're all right.
You're all right. You're all right.

359
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,633
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.

360
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,600
- Not okay. Okay?
- He all right.

361
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,000
Really not okay. This is some
of the stuff we're gonna work on.

362
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,267
How do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?

363
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,200
Landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.

364
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,633
No, that was already like that
when I got here, Ray.

365
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,967
I live here.
I know what the street's like.

366
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:57,223
We'll make those problems
of the past.

367
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:59,733
I'm gonna teach you
how to interface with the public.

368
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:03,067
- Where's the wife?
- Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.

369
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,200
Hancock, pulled some stuff up
on YouTube.

370
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,667
Surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.

371
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:11,133
What is this?

372
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,033
That's me trying to change the world.

373
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:16,133
Unfortunately, not doing real well.

374
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:18,233
Come on. Let's get to you.

375
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,867
This stuff was on YouTube.

376
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,400
Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy,
I get it, but this doesn't work, sir.

377
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,333
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up, back up.

378
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,900
Mom! Mom! Mom!

379
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,147
Those are children.

380
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,967
- We've been waiting a long time...
- Get that camera out of my face.

381
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:43,500
You ever put out
an apartment fire, Ray?

382
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:47,233
- No, I haven't done that. I'm in P.R.
- No. My ass was hot.

383
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:51,667
All right. How about this?
This is Walter, the gray whale.

384
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:54,600
Everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach north of Zuma.

385
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:55,833
Along comes Hancock.

386
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:00,233
Hancock!

387
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:12,300
- I don't even remember that.
- Yeah.

388
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:15,600
Greenpeace does. Walter does.

389
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,100
This gets redundant after a while...

390
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,400
...but my basic diagnosis
of your fundamental problem is...

391
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,233
- Do you wanna hear it?
- No.

392
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,733
You're an asshole.

393
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,200
I know. I call it like I see it though.

394
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,400
It's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.

395
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,567
But you are an asshole,
don't you think?

396
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,367
Be careful.

397
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,800
All right, how about this?
I've been thinking about something.

398
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,770
This kind of goes to
how you present yourself.

399
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,057
Come on. Really? It's the middle
of the day. What springs to mind...

400
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,667
...when you see this?

401
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:49,600
Homo.

402
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,433
- What about that?
- Homo in red.

403
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,900
- Norwegian homo.
- I'll give you that.

404
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,400
Let's move past the comics. Let's
get into something a little deeper.

405
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:07,800
I think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.

406
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,867
I think deep down,
you want people's acceptance.

407
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,600
Come on, now.
You save people's lives...

408
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,833
...and they reject you,
and so you reject them back.

409
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,833
And it's a...
And we're gonna switch that cycle.

410
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:22,800
We're gonna start fresh, start anew.

411
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,867
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into willpower...

412
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,300
- And then he kicked it in.
- Almost.

413
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,433
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.

414
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:34,867
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs.
I'm making lunch. Go change.

415
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,500
Hey, sweetheart.

416
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,433
Have you been watching the news?

417
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,400
- No, we've been working on...
- Interfacing with the public.

418
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,733
- This has been on all day.
- That's very good.

419
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:50,023
The law is the law, Mr. Hancock,
and you are not above it.

420
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:51,990
Felony destruction of property...

421
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,733
...amounting to tens of millions
of dollars, theft, and now this.

422
00:30:55,933 --> 00:31:00,367
From where I sit,
I see a selfish, self-absorbed man...

423
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,867
...with a lot of muscle, but no regard
for anyone but yourself.

424
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:07,367
Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.

425
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,333
You are not above the law.

426
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:15,433
You have failed to show
at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.

427
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:19,267
Anybody else would be held
in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.

428
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:22,567
You may be a superhero,
but let me tell you this:

429
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:26,600
You're not nearly as strong
as the U.S. Constitution.

430
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,267
Bank on it, buddy.

431
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,167
We do not condone the t...

432
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,367
Genius.

433
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:36,100
Things just got real.
This is exactly what we need.

434
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,267
There's a DA trying to figure out
how to put you in jail.

435
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:42,067
- Bitch can try.
- I say you go.

436
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,233
People take you for granted.
Make people miss you.

437
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:51,567
- People don't like you, Hancock.
- I do.

438
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:54,767
Two weeks, you know?
The public will be clamoring for you.

439
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:56,633
When they do, we'll be ready.

440
00:31:56,833 --> 00:32:00,467
Worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and
you just, you know, fly out of there.

441
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,900
What do you got to lose?

442
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,400
"I apologize to the people
of Los Angeles.

443
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,100
My behavior has been improper,
and I accept the consequences.

444
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,933
I ask my fellow Angelenos...

445
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,067
...for their patience
and understanding."

446
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,767
You're an asshole, Hancock!

447
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:37,000
Asshole!

448
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:42,267
"Life here can be difficult for me.

449
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:44,567
After all, I'm the only one of my kind.

450
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,800
During my incarceration,
I will be participating...

451
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,200
...in alcohol-
and anger-management treatment."

452
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,333
You're a drunk bum!

453
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:02,633
"You deserve better from me.
I can be better. I will be better."

454
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,667
All right.

455

CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

456
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,333
Good morning, ladies.
Welcome to your new home...

457
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,467
It is the duty of each of you to remember
your inmate serial number.

458
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,833
Turn to your right.

459
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:25,200
Turn to your left.

460
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:28,233
Okay, scumbags. Let's go.

461
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,467
Give me the hand, playboy.

CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON JOHN HANCOCK

463

I see you, punk!

00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,067
Oh, I get it.

465
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:22,667
I put some... Most of you in here.

466
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:24,833
Yes, you did.

467
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,667
I can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.

468
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,367
What?

469
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,700
So I'm gonna do me
and I'm gonna let you do you.

470
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,033
I don't want no trouble.

471
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,533
All right?

472
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,700
I just wanna go to my cell.

473
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,700
- That ain't gonna happen.
- Nope.

474
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,167
Excuse me.

475
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,933
Excuse me, please.

476
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
Deadly.

477
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,767
If you don't move,
your head is going up his ass.

478
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,833
Y'all fellas sure you wanna
ride this train?

479
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,767
Choo, choo, asshole.

480
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,333
Get him out! Get him out!

481
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,167
Did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?

482
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,133
We're gonna...
We're gonna circle back to that.

483
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,667
The DA's office wants your sentence
to run eight years.

484
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,967
It's a big number, but not something
we didn't anticipate.

485
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:05,200
You know, our plan is...
What are you doing?

486
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:18,033
It sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.

487
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:20,867
Eight is more like four and a half
with good behavior.

488
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:25,167
But it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...

489
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:27,967
...and with the crime rate
going up through the roof...

490
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:32,067
...the DA and the cops, they're all
gonna call for your immediate release.

491
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,867
They're gonna demand it.
Where are you going? Sit down.

492
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,667
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.

493
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:39,033
- Stop it. Hancock.
- Move.

494
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:40,733
- Hancock!
- Get back!

495
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,467
You're being a coward!

496
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,233
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to you.

497
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:49,300
- Who are you talking to, Ray?
- Stop pretending that you do not care.

498
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,900
You have a calling.
You're a hero, Hancock.

499
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,900
You're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.

500
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,400
Trust me. Trust this plan,
this process. Just stay in here.

501
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:04,367
When they call, a hero's
what we're gonna give them.

502
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,233
How we gonna do that, Ray?

503
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,400
All right, guys, let's start sharing.

504
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,500
- Don? You had something?
- Yeah.

505
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:19,833
Yeah, I think I might've had
a little bit of a breakthrough.

506
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:21,600
Good for you.

507
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:26,600
Yeah, I mean, I realized
that breaking necks is... It's easy.

508
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,200
But I'm sitting there and I'm
staring at myself in the mirror...

509
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,200
...and I thought, "This is tough."
- Yeah, it sounds tough.

510
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:38,567
Why do you always laugh?

511
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:42,133
Picturing you looking at the mirror.
It would scare the shit out of me.

512
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:46,133
Every time I'm talking,
he completely ruins the cycle.

513
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:47,800
Now, let's watch the crosstalk.

514
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,467
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

515
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:51,867
No, no, no.

516
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
- Keep sharing.
- Let's move on.

517
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,167
Mr. Hancock,
do you wanna share today?

518
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,367
Pass.

519
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:03,133
Your landing is your first impression.
It's your superhero handshake.

520
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,633
Don't come in too hot, okay?
Don't come in too boozy.

521
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:09,233
And don't land on
a $ 100,000 Mercedes. All right?

522
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:12,133
People have to be happy
that you've arrived.

523
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,267
Mr. Hancock, your share.

524
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,433
Pass.

525
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:19,333
So you've used the door
and the building's still intact.

526
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:22,033
People are happy that you've arrived.
They feel safe.

527
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,433
There's an officer
and he's done a good job...

528
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,333
...so tell him he's done a good job.

529
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:29,467
What the hell did I have to come for
if he's done a good job?

530
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:41,500
Oh, man!

531
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,667
KBLA radio, AM 850.

532
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:49,333
Today's big story, no surprise here:
Hancock. What's your take?

533
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:51,367
I, for one, have
had enough of this guy.

534
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:55,267
I'm glad he's doing time around bars
and I hope they don't let him off easy.

535
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,800
Let my cousin Pookie out.

536
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:59,800
"I see you don't wear
a bulletproof vest, security officer.

537
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,133
I respect your courage...

538
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:04,800
...because bullets don't bounce
off you, they bounce off me."

539
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:12,467
This city is being run by gangs
and drug dealers.

540
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,867
Hancock makes them
shake in their boots.

541
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:18,233
He doesn't tie a pretty ribbon
around it, but he gets the job done.

542
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:19,633
Besides, he's hot.

543
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:24,033
Let me hear you say it.
Let me hear you say, "Good job."

544
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,333
G...

545
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,000
Goo...

546
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,867
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

547
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:36,367
- Pass.
- Good.

548
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:38,200
Good.

549
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,933
Good j...

550
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:43,433
Good j...

551
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:47,600
Good job.

552
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,367
Good job.

553
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:53,733
Jail watch, day five, and true to his
word, Hancock remains incarcerated.

554
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,933
Meanwhile, crime is still on the rise.

555
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:59,600
The L.A.P.D. Is reporting
increases of up to 30 percent...

556
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,233
...in the last five days
that Hancock has been behind bars.

557
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:11,467
- Hancock! Hey, Hancock!
- Hey, little buddy.

558
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:14,533
- Hancock. We brought you something!
- Hey, hey.

559
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,600
Hey, what's up, Hancock?

560
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:19,400
Where's...? Where's Ray?

561
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,067
No, it's just us. Ray's working.

562
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:24,233
Aaron really wanted
to come and see you...

563
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:27,600
...so we just dropped by
with some Spaghetti Madness.

564
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,200
I should probably let the guard
check for keys...

565
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:34,300
- No, no. Here.
- Okay. Here you go.

566
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,700
Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?

567
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:42,600
- Just dig in.
- Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.

568
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:50,167
- That's a good meatball.
- Thanks, Hancock.

569
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,633
Ray is a good man.

570
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,677
Whatever this is you're doing,
don't let him down.

571
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,167
Okay?

572
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:15,933
Okay. Well, we should
probably go, buddy.

573
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:19,033
- Already? I wanna stay with Hancock.
- Yeah. Sweetheart...

574
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:22,033
...we have to go.
Come on, say goodbye to Hancock.

575
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:25,433
Here, Hancock. It's my favorite one,
and I want you to have it.

576
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,800
- That was very sweet.
- Thanks, Mom.

577
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,567
Come here.

578
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:50,233
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

579
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:52,033
Pass.

580
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,467
All right. Phillip?

581
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:58,367
I love you guys, man.

582
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,300
- We love you.
- We love you too, Phillip.

583
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:51,793
For when they call.

584
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,933
- I ain't wearing that, Ray.
- Yes, you are.

585
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:01,800
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- No, you are.

586
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,200
Actually, I'm not, Ray.

587
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,133
You think you're not, but you are.

588
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:10,200
I will fight crime butt-ass naked
before I fight it in that, Ray.

589
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:14,100
You know, you have fought naked.
We've got that. That's on YouTube.

590
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,900
Hancock, this is a uniform.
A uniform represents purpose.

591
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,733
Doctors, policemen, firemen, right?

592
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:23,433
- It represents a calling.
- It's been two weeks.

593
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:27,067
- Yeah?
- Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.

594
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:30,600
Just be patient.
You gotta trust me on this. All right?

595
00:43:57,533 --> 00:44:00,000
Perimeter breach, perimeter breach.

596
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:02,933
Asshole!

597
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:09,507
You're still a fake-ass punk.

598
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:25,600
Damn!

599
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,833
Mr. Hancock?

600
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:29,933
It's your share.

601
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:33,467
Pass.

602
00:44:35,533 --> 00:44:39,133
- Come on, man, try it. Let it out.
- Come on, John.

603
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,567
I don't have nothing.

604
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,300
There's nothing on your mind?
Come on, John.

605
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,733
- It's cool, man.
- Come on.

606
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,167
- Come on.
- Do it.

607
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:47,667
First time for everything.

608
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:51,033
- Feels good to release, now.
- Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.

609
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:54,667
Come in here all these days,
you don't have anything to share?

610
00:44:56,333 --> 00:45:01,200
I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.

611
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,733
All right. Thanks for sharing.

612
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:08,700
- Okay.
- Thank you.

613
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:10,500
- All right.
- That's awesome.

614
00:45:10,733 --> 00:45:13,733
- That's a clap. Yeah.
- There you go. Good share.

615
00:45:29,233 --> 00:45:31,533
Hey, Hancock.

616
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:33,600
Come on, get up.

617
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,833
- You got a phone call.
- Take a message.

618
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,200
It's the chief of police.

619
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:41,833
He says he needs your help.

620
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:03,904
SWAT

621
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:10,600
The trapped officer's husband
is Corporal Joseph Blake...

622
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,633
...who was killed last year in Iraq...

623
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:16,267
...leaving her two small children.
We are waiting for the latest news...

624
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:19,000
...but apparently
there are three suspects and...

625
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,433
What's going on?

626
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,433
I'm out!

627
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:26,733
Stay down! Stay down!

628
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:28,600
Stay down!

629
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,333
- Get out!
- Get down!

630
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:31,667
Get it down!

631
00:46:31,798 --> 00:46:33,798
IPE BANK & TRUST

632
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,800
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!

633
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,267
Back! Move!

634
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:58,667
We got perimeters set up
on the north, east and south sides.

635
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:00,667
The west side is open.

636
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:11,900
Don't break the building,
don't break the building.

637
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,700
What?

638
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:27,867
It's a little tight. What you got?

639
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:32,033
Bank job. I got at least eight hostages.
Four bad guys.

640
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:34,367
Officer pinned down.
We can't get to her.

641
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:38,500
They been spraying
the hell out of us all morning. And...

642
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,067
They got some kind of heavy artillery.
Fifty caliber or bigger.

643
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:45,933
- I don't know if that matters to you.
- No, I'm good.

644
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,733
Good job.

645
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:57,167
Good job.

646
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:59,500
Really, good job.

647
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:08,467
Get down!

648
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:39,933
It's Hancock!

649
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:48,567
Take him out!

650
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:54,933
Good job!

651
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,267
Do I have permission
to touch your body?

652
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,000
Yes!

653
00:49:00,433 --> 00:49:02,533
It's not sexual.

654
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,267
Not that you're not
an attractive woman.

655
00:49:06,467 --> 00:49:09,267
- You're a very attractive woman...
- Get me the f% % &#k out of here!

656
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:16,400
He's on the move!

657
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,700
He's moving, he's moving!

658
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:43,567
Good job.

659
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:45,200
- Are you hit anywhere?
- My leg!

660
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,900
- Hancock!
- Good job.

661
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,703
You said that.
I need you to end this now.

662
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,700
Check the flanks.

663
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:03,133
Secure the perimeter.

664
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,600
Spread out!

665
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,833
They're gonna
come around the back.

666
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
What happened to him?

667
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,900
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

668
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:38,600
What is happening?

669
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,100
- I heard you was in the slammer.
- Out early.

670
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,933
- Why's that?
- Good behavior.

671
00:50:59,867 --> 00:51:01,433
Do you know what this is?

672
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:09,000
I'm guessing it's
some kind of detonator-type deal.

673
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,567
There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.

674
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,800
This is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.

675
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:16,600
If my thumb comes off it:

676
00:51:16,811 --> 00:51:18,101
BOOM!

677
00:51:19,867 --> 00:51:23,133
And now, since we've had
a little change of plan...

678
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,967
...between the police showing up...

679
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:27,467
...and you sucking out
all of my associates...

680
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,800
...I want you to break into the vault.

681
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,200
You'll find three quarter-ton pallets
of small bills inside.

682
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,967
Thirty million dollars.

683
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:37,867
And you're gonna carry it for me.

684
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:42,033
You are gonna get me safely
away from here with the money...

685
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,567
...or else they'll be cleaning up
these hostages with a mop.

686
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:51,737
I'm gonna have to say no to that.

687
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,667
I'm really trying
to turn over a new leaf.

688
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:59,533
I will blow up this entire building,
you asshole.

689
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,000
I really don't like that word.

690
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,100
I will blow them sky-high...

691
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,000
...and their blood
will be on your hands.

692
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:15,667
Do you hear me, asshole?

693
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,867
Call me a asshole...

694
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:28,733
...one more time.

695
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:33,500
Ass...

696
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:40,733
- Go, go, go. Move in!
- Go on, you're safe!

697
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:43,300
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Take it right in. Let's go.

698
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,533
Bring it around now.

699
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,667
Keep your hand on that trigger.

700
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:12,867
- Good job.
- No. You, good job.

701
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,200
- Thank you.
- Good job.

702
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,267
Hancock!

703
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,600
Say hi to your fans.
Look what you got.

704
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:20,900
Here we go. This way.

705
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,633
- Hancock. At the bank today, intense.
- Thank you.

706
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,600
Smile.

707
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:27,900
Good job, Hancock!

708
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,467
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody
in here, huh?

709
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,633
Hancock, meet these guys. This is
Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.

710
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,300
Gigantic fans. Insane!

711
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,700
These guys are partners
at the biggest ad firm.

712
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,200
You never call, man.

713
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,433
- I have called. A couple of times.
- Water under the bridge, man.

714
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,433
Could you guys
get used to this or what?

715
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:56,067
How'd you two meet?

716
00:54:57,967 --> 00:54:59,500
I was married once before.

717
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,767
First wife...

718
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:05,700
...she died giving birth to Aaron.

719
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:10,633
It's another dinner. But... But...

720
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:13,367
So there I am, I'm with
this beautiful little baby.

721
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:15,333
I don't know what the hell to do.

722
00:55:15,533 --> 00:55:17,733
And I was in the supermarket...

723
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,367
...and I'm in the baby aisle...

724
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,133
...and I've got
a brand of diapers in each hand.

725
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:27,233
I'm staring at them, but I don't know
how I'm gonna get through the day.

726
00:55:28,567 --> 00:55:29,700
An angel...

727
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:33,233
...sees me.

728
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,867
She knew. She was...
She gave me this look.

729
00:55:39,467 --> 00:55:44,467
And even in the trance I was in,
I knew that somebody somewhere...

730
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,700
...was throwing me a little rope.

731
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:48,533
You know?

732
00:55:48,733 --> 00:55:52,700
Starting that day, you really
put my life back together. Right?

733
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,833
- You're drunk.
- So? Come here.

734
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,667
What about you, buddy?

735
00:56:04,867 --> 00:56:06,767
You're from another planet,
aren't you?

736
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:09,100
No, man, I'm from Miami.

737
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,700
You didn't come in on,
like, a meteor or...?

738
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,400
Nope. Woke up in a hospital,
first thing I remember.

739
00:56:14,633 --> 00:56:18,567
Government hospital, yes?
Experimenting on you and...

740
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:22,567
No, Ray. Regular old
Miami emergency room.

741
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,133
- Come on.
- My skull was fractured.

742
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:29,933
They told me
I tried to stop a mugging.

743
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:34,367
- Somebody knocked you out.
- I guess I was a regular guy before...

744
00:56:34,567 --> 00:56:37,767
...and when I woke up,
I was changed.

745
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,533
The hospital nurse tried
to put a needle in my arm...

746
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,967
...and it just broke against my skin.

747
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:47,867
And then my skull healed
in, like, an hour.

748
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,633
The doctors were astounded...

749
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:55,600
...and they wanted to know my story.

750
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,500
Just like you. But I couldn't tell them.
I don't know who I am.

751
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:02,333
Amnesia.

752
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,433
- You know, the blow to the head.
- Yeah, well, that's what they figured.

753
00:57:06,933 --> 00:57:10,300
- You don't remember anything?
- No.

754
00:57:11,467 --> 00:57:14,267
Only thing I had in my pocket was...

755
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:16,433
...bubble gum...

756
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,667
...two movie tickets.

757
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,467
Boris Karloff, Frankenstein.

758
00:57:23,033 --> 00:57:25,933
But no ID, nothing.

759
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:30,800
I went to sign out, the nurse
asked me for my John Hancock.

760
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:32,816
John Hancock also means signature

761
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:34,433
I actually thought that's who I was.

762
00:57:35,633 --> 00:57:39,433
How come I didn't hear any of this, didn't read about it
in any newspapers?

763
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:43,000
It was probably in the papers
80 years ago.

764
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:45,033
Eighty years ago?

765
00:57:45,267 --> 00:57:47,467
Oh, I don't age. This is it.

766
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:50,500
- That's nice.
- Gotta wonder, though:

767
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:56,167
What kind of bastard
must I have been...

768
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:02,053
...that nobody was there to claim me?

769
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,700
I mean, I'm not the most
charming guy in the world...

770
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,267
...so I've been told, but...

771
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,333
...nobody?

772
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:34,500
Whoever it was they'd be dead
by now, anyway.

773
00:58:38,033 --> 00:58:40,800
Hey, Mary. You all right, baby?

774
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,700
Yeah. Too much wine.

775
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,333
I am a lightweight.

776
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:55,400
I'm sorry.

777
00:58:58,933 --> 00:59:00,900
You ain't do nothing.

778
00:59:05,733 --> 00:59:07,200
This was a nice dinner, Ray.

779
00:59:10,033 --> 00:59:14,100
- It was a good one.
- Almost call this fun.

780
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,133
That didn't tire you out,
coming up the stairs?

781
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:23,400
- Not really.
- I'm real spinny.

782
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,500
Could've just flown me upstairs.

783
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,333
- I could've done without that.
- Get your shoes off here.

784
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:32,900
All right, that's all you're
getting off of me though.

785
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:38,867
You believe in me,
don't you, Hancock?

786
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:42,167
- Of course, Ray. I believe in you.
- Help me up here.

787
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:44,367
I got something to say to you.

788
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,000
Listen to me. This is important.

789
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:53,300
You are like a Dodger Dog.

790
00:59:53,867 --> 00:59:56,167
It's something people don't think
they're gonna like...

791
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:58,833
...then they try it and they love it,
right? It hits the spot.

792
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:01,987
It's good for the soul.
You're like the world's Dodger Dog.

793
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,200
I don't know.
But you know what I mean, right?

794
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:08,700
You're gonna do great.

795
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:13,067
You're gonna fix everything.

796
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,067
- You get some sleep, Ray.
- You sleep tight too.

797
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:24,300
Hancock tucking me in.

798
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:38,433
All right, he's asleep.

799
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:45,733
- Okay, thanks. Good night.
- Good night.

800
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:56,733
Look, I just don't want you
to think that... That Ray...

801
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:58,767
...you know, drinks like that,
because...

802
01:00:58,967 --> 01:01:01,167
- Oh, no.
- This was just kind of...

803
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:03,300
...a celebratory night.
- No, I understand.

804
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,467
- Yeah, I know that.
- Okay.

805
01:01:09,467 --> 01:01:12,900
The damn babysitter
never cleans up after herself.

806
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,800
You have a bruise on your hand.

807
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,033
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know what that is.

808
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,267
I've been feeling kind of funny.

809
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:47,133
You...

810
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,400
You should go.

811
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Getting late.

812
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:49,733
If Ray finds out about me...

813
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:54,000
...you're dead.

814
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:44,667
Joan, we're gonna take care
of that, okay? Don't you worry.

815
01:03:46,733 --> 01:03:48,500
Hi, honey.

816
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,667
Breakfast?

817
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,700
Hancock sneezed, huh?

818
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,000
Can you believe it? It's amazing
that you slept through that.

819
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:00,033
- You're a good sleeper.
- Holy shit.

820
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,667
I'm not gonna say
I told you so, but...

821
01:04:04,267 --> 01:04:06,933
You told me he was gonna sneeze
a hole through the house?

822
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,567
I just said him being around...

823
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:10,933
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that?
Thanks.

824
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:13,567
- Oh, God, you strong man.
- I got it.

825
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,000
But you don't worry about anything.

826
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,500
I already apologized to the neighbors.
Called State Farm.

827
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,133
Everything is taken care of.

828
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:23,533
You just...

829
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,633
...enjoy that breakfast.

830
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,200
What's this?
Are we going on vacation? Are we?

831
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:33,600
Just the three of us.

832
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,490
- End of the summer?
- Tonight.

833
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,533
- Tonight?
- Spur of the moment.

834
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:41,233
- Tonight might be a little tough.
- Come on. The three of us?

835
01:04:41,433 --> 01:04:43,300
Me in a bikini?

836
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,000
- Sounds good.
- Let's go somewhere.

837
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,900
Knock, knock.

838
01:04:48,533 --> 01:04:50,367
Gesundheit.

839
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,567
I was just telling Ray here,
I hope you're done sneezing...

840
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,300
...because I don't think
our house could take much more...

841
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,033
...of your sneezing.

842
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:11,300
Yeah, sometimes
I sneeze when there's dust...

843
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:16,083
...or if I get really surprised.

844
01:05:17,267 --> 01:05:20,300
That's unfortunate.
This is Kilbourne.

845
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:23,533
Mike? How you doing?

846
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:26,667
It was great to see you too.

847
01:05:26,867 --> 01:05:30,033
Yep. Well...

848
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:32,600
Right. Go ahead, shoot.

849
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:36,833
Okay. I got a pen right here.

850
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:39,833
Right. No, I know.

851
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:47,067
It's right here in my hand.

852
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,633
I am warning you.

853
01:05:56,867 --> 01:05:58,067
All right, go ahead.

854
01:06:01,633 --> 01:06:02,733
Okay, good.

855
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:08,267
Now... And that's still in 310, right?

856
01:06:08,467 --> 01:06:09,600
Hang on one second.

857
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,733
Do me a favor?

858
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,933
I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.

859
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:17,967
We're gonna talk.

860
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:21,067
Go away.

861
01:06:21,267 --> 01:06:25,133
Well, it is something
that I'm really excited about.

862
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,600
- I'm gonna do this all day.
- Shut... Shut up.

863
01:06:42,033 --> 01:06:43,500
I... I suppose...

864
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,967
- Fine. We'll talk, okay?
- We will.

865
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:51,033
And when we're done talking, you go away
and you leave my family alone.

866
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,267
- My place at 4:00.
- Whatever.

867
01:06:56,233 --> 01:06:59,633
It means... Well, I'd rather not
talk numbers now.

868
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:02,867
I'd like to save them for the pitch.
So let's just set a time.

869
01:07:03,067 --> 01:07:06,100
That's good with me.
I will see you then. All right.

870
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,167
Yeah, 3:30. Great.

871
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,933
Hon, is it hot in here?

872
01:07:33,233 --> 01:07:36,367
He hurt you, didn't he?

873
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,867
Come on, use your words.

874
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:42,567
How did it make you feel?

875
01:07:45,467 --> 01:07:46,633
Sore.

876
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:48,433
Bad.

877
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:50,533
Bad.

878
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:54,933
It's because he took your power.
And you have to get your power back.

879
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,867
And no one will give you your power
back. You have to go out and take it.

880
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:03,167
You understand me?

881
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:06,767
We're gonna go find Hancock...

882
01:08:08,367 --> 01:08:10,733
...and get your power back.

883
01:08:42,133 --> 01:08:43,433
Well, I'm here.

884
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:46,000
Yup.

885
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:54,967
- You wanna do it?
- Do what?

886
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,867
I don't have time for this, okay?
You ask the questions...

887
01:09:01,067 --> 01:09:02,967
...I answer them honestly
and then you leave L.A.

888
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:04,700
I ain't leaving L.A.

889
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,300
All right, all right. Jeez.

890
01:09:12,467 --> 01:09:13,933
Don't.

891
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,867
Ask.

892
01:09:29,867 --> 01:09:31,500
- You and I.
- "You and l" what?

893
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:34,433
- We're the same.
- No.

894
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:36,800
I'm stronger.

895
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:39,350
Really?

896
01:09:41,933 --> 01:09:43,533
Oh, yeah.

897
01:09:44,733 --> 01:09:46,400
Who are we?

898
01:09:46,633 --> 01:09:51,333
Gods, angels. Different cultures
call us by different names.

899
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:54,533
Now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."

900
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:58,333
- Are there more of us?
- There were.

901
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,833
They all died.

902
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:04,000
It's just the two of us.

903
01:10:13,067 --> 01:10:14,167
What is this?

904
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,767
Who are we to each other?

905
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,933
- We're brother and sister.
- That's a lie.

906
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:26,167
- No, I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

907
01:10:26,367 --> 01:10:28,033
- I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

908
01:10:28,233 --> 01:10:31,333
Sisters don't kiss brothers
the way you kissed me last night.

909
01:10:31,533 --> 01:10:32,833
You're lying, deal's off.

910
01:10:33,033 --> 01:10:35,100
Let's go see
how Ray feels about this.

911
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:37,400
Get your ass back here!

912
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,533
I'm telling!

913
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,267
The AllHeart symbol
will be known globally...

914
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,467
...as a symbol...

915
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:54,533
...that represents companies that
are committed to changing the world.

916
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:57,133
They can give away
their sustenance goods, okay?

917
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:59,600
Food, drugs, power, clothing,
for free.

918
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,167
- We were talking about Hancock...
- Number two.

919
01:11:13,533 --> 01:11:15,300
You stay away
from me and my family.

920
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,900
You are not gonna
do this to me again.

921
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:21,100
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

922
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,233
- Hey!
- I love you, Hancock!

923
01:11:23,433 --> 01:11:26,900
It can't work.
It always ends the same way.

924
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,567
Persia. Greece. Brooklyn.

925
01:11:29,767 --> 01:11:31,500
Brooklyn?
I've never been to Brooklyn.

926
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:34,400
I have put up with your bullshit
for 3000 years...

927
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,467
...and I am done!
Done, you listening?

928
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,933
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Finally, I am happy!

929
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:43,733
- You are not gonna mess with that!
- I don't know what you're talking about!

930
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,433
I hate to burst
your little crazy-lady bubble...

931
01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:51,233
...but it must not have been all that
great because I don't remember you.

932
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,633
Call me crazy...

933
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:02,000
...one more time.

934
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,600
Cuckoo.

935
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,367
All right, hold it. All right.

936
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:17,733
You better not hit me with that truck.

937
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,233
For companies to qualify, they need to
prove they are a leader in the global...

938
01:12:22,433 --> 01:12:24,000
We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.

939
01:12:24,233 --> 01:12:26,167
They're committed
to bettering the world.

940
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,767
They can do this in four ways.
This is how they...

941
01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:14,333
The most important thing
with AllHeart is brand recognition.

942
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:16,433
I've mocked up
these examples here...

943
01:13:16,633 --> 01:13:18,600
...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.

944
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,100
Oh, no.

945
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:34,633
We need maximum exposure,
market penetra...

946
01:13:34,867 --> 01:13:35,867
Is it snowing?

947
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,300
Stop. Stop it.

948
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,233
Stop. Stop. Stop!
All right, let's just...

949
01:13:55,433 --> 01:13:56,567
Get off me!

950
01:14:03,267 --> 01:14:04,933
Get off me!

951
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:07,300
Stop. Stop!

952
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,100
Get off!

953
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,533
- Get off me!
- Listen to me!

954
01:14:10,733 --> 01:14:13,167
- I hate you!
- I am sorry!

955
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:21,133
Whoever I am, whatever I did...
Look at me.

956
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,067
I'm sorry.

957
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:26,533
I don't remember.

958
01:14:27,533 --> 01:14:29,867
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

959
01:14:40,467 --> 01:14:42,233
Oh, my God.

960
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,967
Why were you flying?
You were flying, Mary.

961
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,900
- Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray.
- Okay, I was flying.

962
01:15:41,067 --> 01:15:43,633
And I'm very strong as well.

963
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:45,333
- It's just the way we are.
- "We"?

964
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:48,633
Me and him, it's just us now.
The others paired up and died.

965
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:51,700
You didn't say anything
about pairing up at the trailer.

966
01:15:51,933 --> 01:15:54,500
- You were at his trailer.
- This is hard to explain.

967
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,100
- Great, I'm all ears.
- Me too.

968
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,033
Do me a favor, just give me
and my wife one moment.

969
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:01,667
- Don't bring it here, Ray.
- The adults are talking.

970
01:16:01,867 --> 01:16:03,500
Technically speaking...

971
01:16:05,433 --> 01:16:06,533
...he's my husband.

972
01:16:07,733 --> 01:16:10,167
Holy shit.

973
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:13,367
- What?
- We broke up decades ago.

974
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,533
Long before you were born.
He just can't remember.

975
01:16:16,733 --> 01:16:19,833
But you can, right? You knew?

976
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:22,500
That's something you bring up
on a first date, Mary.

977
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,967
"I don't like to travel.
I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal."

978
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:28,533
Those are some things
you give a heads-up on.

979
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:31,067
Whatever we are,
we were built in twos, okay?

980
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:32,633
We're drawn to each other.

981
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:35,167
No matter how far I run,
he's always there.

982
01:16:35,367 --> 01:16:36,967
He finds me. It's physics.

983
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:39,833
Are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?

984
01:16:40,033 --> 01:16:42,933
I've lived for a very long time, Ray.

985
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,033
And the one thing I learned...

986
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,033
...fate doesn't decide everything.

987
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,000
People get to choose.

988
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,433
And you chose...

989
01:16:52,633 --> 01:16:55,967
...to let me think I was here alone.

990
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,033
I didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.

991
01:17:09,633 --> 01:17:11,967
Great. Now what?

992
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:19,600
I didn't plan for this.

993
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:38,761
LIQUOR STOP

994
01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:43,933
Prison authorities confirmed...

995
01:17:44,133 --> 01:17:47,800
...that the prisoner uprising was led
by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...

996
01:17:48,033 --> 01:17:51,300
...who was also the leader of last
week's Spring Street bank robbery.

997
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:53,800
At least eight prisoners
are not accounted for.

998
01:17:54,067 --> 01:17:56,300
More information
on the prison riot in Norwalk.

999
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,733
Construction workers at the prison
were knocked unconscious.

1000
01:17:59,933 --> 01:18:01,933
The prisoners stole
the workers' clothes...

1001
01:18:02,133 --> 01:18:04,800
...and it's feared at least
some of them have escaped.

1002
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,233
Parker is considered
a criminal mastermind.

1003
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,100
He is very effective at
using psychological persuasion...

1004
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,767
...to organize criminals
from different backgrounds.

1005
01:18:12,967 --> 01:18:15,900
He is a former psychology professor
from Stanford University.

1006
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,767
While there, he organized
a notorious criminal network...

1007
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:21,300
...comprised of graduate students
from diverse...

1008
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,567
Ninety-one ten.

1009
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,067
Ninety-one ten?
You gotta be shitting me.

1010
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,967
Ninety-one ten.

1011
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:30,567
Highway robbery.

1012
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:34,833
- 911

1013
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,800
- What?
- I'm taking the money.

1014
01:19:03,767 --> 01:19:05,363
I can relate to that.

1015
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:10,133
You know? If you want something...

1016
01:19:11,067 --> 01:19:14,100
...nobody can stop you
from taking it...

1017
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,400
...you just take it, right?

1018
01:19:19,133 --> 01:19:20,967
I like that.

1019
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:23,333
But can you take it?

1020
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:29,367
My Zagnut bar versus your gun.

1021
01:19:36,567 --> 01:19:37,900
Sorry about your window.

1022
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,067
- I need Room 1020.
- Clear!

1023
01:20:27,267 --> 01:20:28,733
I need Room 1020.

1024
01:20:32,067 --> 01:20:36,133
I need IV line, blood quality,
CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and...

1025
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:37,867
Where's his IV line?

1026
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,367
- That's not gonna work.
- I'm in.

1027
01:20:41,867 --> 01:20:43,300
What's happening?

1028
01:20:46,233 --> 01:20:49,167
This just in.
John Hancock has been rushed...

1029
01:20:49,367 --> 01:20:51,100
...to Los Angeles General Hospital.

1030
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,467
Hancock is in serious condition
with multiple gunshot wounds.

1031
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:56,800
No story yet as to
how this happened to him...

1032
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,967
...but we will continue to cover this
story live. Reporting live from L. A...

1033
01:21:00,968 --> 01:21:04,698
MERCY GENERAL HOSPITAL

1034
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:10,167
- Any lead on the assailant?
- Mr. Embrey!

1035
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,400
Just a couple of questions,
sir, please.

1036
01:21:12,633 --> 01:21:14,333
Can you describe how it happened?

1037
01:21:14,567 --> 01:21:17,933
From what I've heard,
he was trying to stop a robbery.

1038
01:21:18,133 --> 01:21:21,700
Do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?

1039
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,033
Not that I'm aware of.

1040
01:21:23,267 --> 01:21:25,633
Could this have to do
with the mysterious woman?

1041
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:28,533
- He was seen battling her.
- I do not have that answer.

1042
01:21:28,767 --> 01:21:31,867
Could this woman
be more powerful than Hancock?

1043
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,633
Here are the lab results for 209.

1044
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,200
You're becoming mortal.

1045
01:22:08,867 --> 01:22:10,700
It's us...

1046
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,367
...being close to each other.

1047
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:17,300
It's never happened this fast before.

1048
01:22:19,933 --> 01:22:21,300
You have to leave.

1049
01:22:22,633 --> 01:22:25,400
The further you get from me,
the better you're gonna feel.

1050
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,200
You'll start getting
your powers back...

1051
01:22:28,433 --> 01:22:31,233
...and be flying and breaking things...

1052
01:22:31,433 --> 01:22:34,033
...and saving people
before you know it.

1053
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,800
Well, it's like I said,
we were built in pairs.

1054
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,933
And when we get close to
our opposites, we lose our power.

1055
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:04,700
- Why?
- So we can live human lives.

1056
01:23:05,067 --> 01:23:07,733
Love, connect...

1057
01:23:08,933 --> 01:23:12,867
...grow old, die.

1058
01:23:13,933 --> 01:23:16,733
What happened to us?

1059
01:23:20,933 --> 01:23:23,033
Summer of 4 B.C.

1060
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,100
We were becoming mortal, like now.

1061
01:23:27,667 --> 01:23:29,833
They came after me with swords.

1062
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,300
But you saved me.

1063
01:23:38,967 --> 01:23:41,300
1850.

1064
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,667
They set our house on fire.

1065
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,733
You pulled me out of the flames.

1066
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:52,133
Eighty years ago.

1067
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,233
What happened then?

1068
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,433
We were living in Miami...

1069
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,367
...and a new movie
was playing in town.

1070
01:24:02,567 --> 01:24:03,600
Frankenstein.

1071
01:24:06,967 --> 01:24:09,033
And after...

1072
01:24:09,533 --> 01:24:11,333
...we walked down Flagler Street...

1073
01:24:11,533 --> 01:24:15,467
...and you took my hand,
and you held it so tight.

1074
01:24:21,933 --> 01:24:24,833
And they attacked us in an alley.

1075
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:32,767
They hit you so hard.
There was so much blood.

1076
01:24:33,867 --> 01:24:37,200
They wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.

1077
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:42,933
And by the time I got to the hospital,
you were awake.

1078
01:24:47,033 --> 01:24:48,567
But you didn't know me.

1079
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,300
So I left.

1080
01:24:54,467 --> 01:24:57,233
Every time we're together...

1081
01:24:57,767 --> 01:25:00,200
...they come after you through me.

1082
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:18,067
You're built to save people
more than the rest of us.

1083
01:25:18,267 --> 01:25:21,167
That's who you are. You're a hero.

1084
01:25:22,767 --> 01:25:25,467
The insurance policy of the gods.

1085
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,200
Keep one alive. You.

1086
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,667
To protect this world.

1087
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:49,800
Mary!

1088
01:25:52,633 --> 01:25:53,633
Mom!

1089
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:55,200
- Mary!
- Stay down!

1090
01:25:55,633 --> 01:25:57,800
Okay.

1091
01:26:08,233 --> 01:26:09,467
Mary?

1092
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,433
Stop.

1093
01:26:26,967 --> 01:26:29,167
Oh, no! No! Please!

1094
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,633
Stay down.

1095
01:26:52,433 --> 01:26:54,200
Hey! Mary!

1096
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,900
Let's go, get her up!

1097
01:26:56,933 --> 01:26:59,567
Come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.

1098
01:27:06,233 --> 01:27:08,600
- Morphine.
- Here. Help in here!

1099
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,533
Hold her down. Hold her down.

1100
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,600
Hold her down.

1101
01:27:23,633 --> 01:27:25,400
Hold her down.

1102
01:27:33,733 --> 01:27:35,900
- You want the monitor now?
- Stay calm.

1103
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:55,233
- Hold her, hold her, hold her.
- Need EKG leads.

1104
01:28:29,633 --> 01:28:32,667
Upon us all, Hancock.

1105
01:28:33,467 --> 01:28:34,833
You're no different.

1106
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,833
Time to shut her down, Hancock.

1107
01:28:43,033 --> 01:28:45,267
It's been a nice run.

1108
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:17,633
Oh, we are all
sincerely gonna miss you.

1109
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,400
But it is time for you to move on.

1110
01:29:25,267 --> 01:29:28,300
And maybe to a happier place.

1111
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:32,833
You can thank me if you want to...

1112
01:29:34,033 --> 01:29:35,600
...superhero.

1113
01:29:46,033 --> 01:29:47,633
You didn't!

1114
01:29:53,967 --> 01:29:55,067
Aaron!

1115
01:32:56,367 --> 01:32:59,400
ONE MONTH LATER

1116
01:33:05,867 --> 01:33:10,400
- What about Attila the Hun?
- Completely cross-eyed.

1117
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,633
- Cross-eyed?
- Yep.

1118
01:33:11,867 --> 01:33:14,600
All right,
what about Queen Elizabeth?

1119
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,433
- Needy.
- J.F. K? What about him?

1120
01:33:19,067 --> 01:33:21,467
Oh, yeah.

1121
01:33:22,467 --> 01:33:24,867
"Oh, yeah"? Anything more?

1122
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,917
Not like that. I was in Cuba
for the whole missile thing.

1123
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,033
Yeah, hang on.

1124
01:33:31,133 --> 01:33:33,333
- Hello?
- Ray.

1125
01:33:33,533 --> 01:33:35,467
Hey, I've been trying to call you.

1126
01:33:35,667 --> 01:33:38,400
Yeah, I was out of cell range.

1127
01:33:39,267 --> 01:33:42,933
- Are you outside?
- Yeah.

1128
01:33:43,133 --> 01:33:46,567
- Look up.
- All right, I'm looking up.

1129
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,133
I'm looking up.

1130
01:33:54,533 --> 01:33:57,367
- Baby?
- What?

1131
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:06,967
You're gonna change the world.

1132
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:10,533
- Good job, Ray.
- Oh, my God, Ray.

1133
01:34:11,733 --> 01:34:14,267
Hey. Look up.

1134
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,433
Hancock.

1135
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,767
I'm proud of you.

1136
01:34:22,967 --> 01:34:24,767
Thanks.

1137
01:34:26,933 --> 01:34:29,403
Will I get in trouble for that?

1138
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:13,463
NOTE: small scene during the credits

1139
01:35:42,267 --> 01:35:45,633
NYPD

1140
01:35:45,633 --> 01:35:47,900
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

1141
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,233
- Oh, my God! Sam! No!
- Drop your weapon, sir!

1142
01:35:50,433 --> 01:35:51,800
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1143
01:35:52,033 --> 01:35:54,467
- Drop it!
- Get back or I'll shoot! Get back!

1144
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:56,267
Get back! I'm not playing.

1145
01:35:56,733 --> 01:35:59,500
Get back. Get back!

1146
01:35:59,933 --> 01:36:02,200
Damn, Handjob.
Where you come from?

1147
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,533
All right, relax.
Just tell me what you need.

1148
01:36:04,733 --> 01:36:07,033
Tell them cops to take
their guns off of me.

1149
01:36:07,233 --> 01:36:09,433
- All right.
- Tell them to take the guns off me.

1150
01:36:09,633 --> 01:36:11,433
Just take them off.
Lower your weapons.

1151
01:36:11,667 --> 01:36:15,967
You're gonna get us out of here
with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.

1152
01:36:16,433 --> 01:36:18,800
Now let's make it happen, asshole.

1153
01:36:23,033 --> 01:36:27,610
(NY finally)

1154
01:36:27,611 --> 01:36:29,601
(NY finally)

1155
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,600
THE END

1156
01:36:31,601 --> 01:36:36,601
Thanks for watching
