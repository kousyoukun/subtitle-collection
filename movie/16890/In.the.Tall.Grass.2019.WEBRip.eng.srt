I think I'm getting nauseous.

18
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,250
Are you gonna throw up?
Do you want me to pull over?

19
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,666
- Hey, hey.

20
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,291
- Here's some water, okay?

21
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,541
Ugh... You okay?

22
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,541
Shouldn't I be over morning sickness
by now?

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,625
I mean, every woman's body
is different, right?

24
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,166
Oh, yeah? What do you know
about women's bodies?

25
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,791
Not enough.

26
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,500
You're not worried, are you?

27
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,166
No.

28
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,416
Just thinking.

29
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,333
What?

30
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,708
What? What?

31
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,958
Uh...

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,333
Maybe we should go back.

33
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,250
-We're halfway to San Diego.
-I know.

34
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,416
I know.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,833
I just...

36
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,208
It's just been hard
to know for sure.

37
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,041
Dad must think I'm an idiot.

38
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,666
Look, Beck, I know it's not
in your nature to put yourself first,

39
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,958
but in this case, I don't think you should
take Mom and Dad's feelings into account.

40
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,541
I don't think you should take
my feelings into account.

41
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,375
I don't think you should even take
the baby's needs into account.

42
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,458
Okay?

43
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,666
This is about you.

44
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,416
Yeah.

45
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,208
Guess I'll have another
1,500 miles to decide, right?

46
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,541
Right.

47
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,708
-Let's just get back on the road and...
- Help!

48
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,875
-...not worry about any of this.
-Did you hear that?

49
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:00,833
Hear what?

50
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,250
Help!

51
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,625
Help!

52
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:12,958
Hello?

53
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,041
Is someone out there?

54
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,500
Help!

55
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,583
I'm lost in here.

56
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,500
Sounds like he's really in trouble.

57
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,416
I've been trying to get to the road,

58
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,041
-but I can't find it!

59
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:32,958
Okay.

60
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,791
We'd better haul him out.

61
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,125
It's really hot.

62
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,625
Careful. Don't slide down into that ditch.

63
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,416
Watch your arm. I'm gonna pull this thing
off the side of the road.

64
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,583
Kid.

65
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,458
Hey, kid, can you hear me?

66
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,083
Yes!

67
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,416
Help me!

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,666
I've been stuck in here for days!

69
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,541
Tobin? Stop calling.

70
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,250
Stop calling, honey.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,583
Hello? What's going on?

72
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,791
We're lost!

73
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,708
Please! Please help!

74
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,083
No! Tobin, no!

75
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,125
No!

76
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,708
There's a woman in there with him.
She's being weird.

77
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,375
Where are you?

78
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,541
Are you coming?

79
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,916
Kid, you're right next to us.
Can you see the road?

80
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,791
No, I can't see anything!

81
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,333
Ah, he's right there.

82
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,041
Cal, wait.

83
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,250

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,750

00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,916

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,416

00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,083
Just sit tight.
We're gonna come to you.

96
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,750
-Hi, uh... I'm on Route 400.
- Help!

97
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,708
I don't know the town name,
but there's a kid lost in the grass.

98
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,625
- Tobin!

99
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,416
Fuck.

100
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,625
Cal?

101
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,916
Cal?

102
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,708
Fuck.

103
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:13,958
Kid!

104
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,458
God.

105
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,541
Kid! Where are you?

106
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,625
Kid!

107
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,875
Becky!

108
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,541
-Becky?
- I'm fine.

109
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,833
I lost the 911 chick.
Is your phone working?

110
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,666
No, I left my phone in the car.

111
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,458
And my glasses.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,833
-Tobin!
- Are you coming?

113
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,791
Please, keep coming. I can't find you.

114
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,625
Kid, you sound like you're headed
for Nebraska. Stay still!

115
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,666
I don't care how scared you are,
don't move. Let us come to you.

116
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,000
Becky!

117
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,416
Becky, where the hell are you?

118
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,791
I'm right here.

119
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,041
Cal?

120
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,750
Something's not right about this.
I think we should head back to the road.

121
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,583
What about the kid and his mom?

122
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,041
Let's just get back together first.

123
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,833
I'll keep talking and you work your way
back towards me, okay?

124
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,000
All right. Good idea.

125
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,583
Okay, start talking.

126
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,708
What do you talk about
when you're lost in a field?

127
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,083
Thousands of miles of gabbing,
and you can't think of anything to say?

128
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,541
There once was a guy named McSweeney

129
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,791
Who spilled some gin on his weenie

130
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,250
Just to be couth, he added vermouth

131
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,666
And slipped his girl a martini

132
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,958
Oh, that's charming.

133
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,625
Hey, you guys,
are you looking for me? I'm scared!

134
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,916
Yes. Yes. Hang on.

135
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,375
Becky!

136
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,916
Becky, keep talking.

137
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,708
There once was a woman named Jill

138
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,291
Who swallowed an exploding pill

139
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,333
They found her vagina in North Carolina--

140
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,958
Aah! Stop, stop. I overshot you somehow.

141
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,916
Cal, quit fucking around.
This isn't funny.

142
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,041
Becky?

143
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,666
Yeah?

144
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,875
You're right,
there's something wrong here.

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,166
All right, let's just do this.

146
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,083
On the count of three, we both jump
with our hands raised in the air.

147
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,250
Can you jump?

148
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,833
Yeah, of course I can jump.
What do you think?

149
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,833
I think you're gonna have a baby
this summer, that's what I think.

150
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,916
Cal, stop walking away.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,041
I didn't move!

152
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,625
Yeah. Yeah, you did.
You must have! You still are.

153
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,583
I'm not. I swear I'm not.

154
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,833
Okay, just...

155
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,291
Forget it. Let's just do this.

156
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,375
All right?

157
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,500
-Ready?
-Okay.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,375
One, two, three!

159
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,000
You're close.

160
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,458
One more time.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,791
-All right.
-One, two, three.

162
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,583
This is nuts! This is fucking nuts!

163
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,541
Becky!

164
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,291
Becky!

165
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,666
-Becky!
<i>-</i>Over here!

166
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:27,916
Beck!

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Here!

168
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,208
Beck!

169
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,125
Over here!

170
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,625
Becky!

171
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,250
Cal? Are you okay? What is it?

172
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,541
Nothing!

173
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,916
I just... I just slipped.

174
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,041
I'm getting a little freaked out here.

175
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,625
What are we gonna do?

176
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,875
We're gonna get out of here.

177
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,291
We just need to keep our heads.

178
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,416
-What about the kid?
-Forget the kid.

179
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,708
This is about us now.

180
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,333
Becky!

181
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,666
Cal!

182
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,791
Becky!

183
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,666
Cal?

184
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,666
Beck.

185
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,208
Cal.

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,875
Beck, just stay where you are,
okay? Don't move.

187
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,166
Save your voice.

188
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,333
I'm gonna come to you.

189
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,666
- Becky!

190
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,458
Beck!

191
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,583
Cal?

192
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,125
-Beck!
-Cal!

193
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,291
Hi, there.

194
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,750
You all right?

195
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,416
Becky, you there?

196
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,000
There's a man here.

197
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,583
It's okay, Cal. This is Tobin's daddy.

198
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,750
If you wanna get out of here,
come with me.

199
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,375
If you could get out,
why are you still in?

200
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,541
I'm looking for my boy and my wife.
They're lost in here, too.

201
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,125
Look, it's gonna be dark soon.
We should stick together.

202
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,125
I understand.
You don't know me from Adam.

203
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,041
Uh...

204
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,250
Ross Humbolt's the name.
Real estate's the game.

205
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,500
Poughkeepsie, wife's Natalie, boy's Tobin.

206
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,708
Becky, what's happening?

207
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,041
I'm all right, Cal.

208
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,041
You can find my brother?

209
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,750
Your brother, I'll try, yeah.

210
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,083
Not like walking a straight line, though.
Nothing is around here.

211
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,125
Just follow me, but stay close.

212
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,958
Whatever you do,
don't lose sight of me, okay?

213
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,250
Okay.

214
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,791
Hang tight, Cal. We're coming for ya.

215
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,000
Becky!

216
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,500
Becky!

217
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,250
Becky!

218
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,208
I'm never gonna find her.

219
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,250
- You can find things.

220
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,083
But it's easier once they're dead.

221
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,166
Tobin?

222
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,041
The field doesn't move dead things around.

223
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:06,750
Tobin...

224
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,166
did you lure us in here?

225
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,250
You can tell me.

226
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,333
Okay?

227
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,125
I won't be mad.

228
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,416
No.

229
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,916
We heard someone yelling.

230
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,291
A man.

231
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,041
He was calling for help.

232
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,625
That's how we got in.

233
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,000
That's how it works.

234
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,583
How long have you been in here?

235
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,750
I'm not sure.

236
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,375
Becky...

237
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,583
your sister...

238
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,333
she's gonna die soon.

239
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,625
How do you know she's my sister?

240
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:04,833
The rock.

241
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,708
The rock teaches you
to hear the tall grass.

242
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,791
The tall grass knows everything.

243
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,000
Then...

244
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,208
you must know where she is.

245
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,250
Yeah?

246
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,000
I can find out for you.

247
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:23,750
No...

248
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,875
I can do better than that.

249
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,541
I can show you.

250
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,916
Do you wanna see her?

251
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,750
Do you wanna check on her?

252
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,708
Come on, follow me.

253
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,541
How far are you along?

254
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,708
Oh, uh...

255
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,208
-Six months.
-Oh!

256
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,166
I remember when Natalie was pregnant.

257
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,708
Those were the salad days.

258
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,625
Enjoy it.

259
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,458
Enjoy your baby, because it goes fast.

260
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,291
Oh.

261
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,041
Dad not in the picture?

262
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,291
He wasn't ready for it.

263
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,125
Well, too bad for him.

264
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,291
Hmm.

265
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,291
You know...

266
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,208
family's everything.

267
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,125
If there's one thing I know for certain,

268
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,958
it's that simple truth.

269
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,291
Well, we better get going.

270
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,875
The sooner we get to them, the better.

271
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,125
Ross?

272
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,166
Hello?

273
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,833
Hello?

274
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,625
Cal!

275
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,375
Are you out there?

276
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,250
Cal?

277
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,750
Cal!

278
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,166
Tobin!

279
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,083
Tobin, you gotta wait!

280
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,791
Hey, Tobin!

281
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,708
Just a little further.

282
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,833
Wait. Tobin, wait. Wait up.

283
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,750
-Tobin.
-Here it is.

284
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,000
Wait, please.

285
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:47,958
Wait for me.

286
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,041
Oh, my God.

287
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,333
Boy, that feels good.

288
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,125
Come on, Cal. Try it.

289
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:14,708
Becky!

290
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,625
Get away from me!

291
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,750
-Get away from me!
<i>-</i>Sorry, Cal.

292
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,333
Too late.

293
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,416
Becky!

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,166
Wait!

295
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,958
You'll never find her that way.

296
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,416
Becky!

297
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,625
Becky!

298
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,250
Becky!

299
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,000
Becky!

300
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,000
Um...

301
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,958
I'm trying to find these two.

302
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,083
Have you seen them?

303
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,625
<i>...south breezes today,</i>
<i>we've certainly been warming up.</i>

304
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,500
<i>That is about to change</i>
<i>as another cold front</i>

305
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,250
<i>moves in late tonight into the morning.</i>

306
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,333
<i>Ahead of that, clouds increase tonight.</i>

307
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,250
<i>Humidity level creeps up</i>
<i>just a little bit,</i>

308
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:51,000
<i>and that helps to kind of set the stage</i>
<i>for some drizzle, possibly,</i>

309
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,791
<i>across especially eastern and southeastern</i>
<i>counties for your Tuesday.</i>

310
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,083
<i>But much cooler weather.</i>

311
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,791
<i>It's not gonna be cool.</i>

312
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,083
<i>Considering this time of year,</i>
<i>abnormally cool.</i>

313
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,041
<i>But today was abnormally warm.</i>

314
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,833
Becky?

315
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,000
Becky?

316
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,291
Becky?

317
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:16,333
Becky.

318
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,166
What?

319
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,833
You okay?

320
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,083
Who are you?

321
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,541
Shh.

322
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,041
Do you hear that?

323
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,041
Hear what?

324
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,666
Everyone else.

325
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,583
If you don't pay attention,

326
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,208
they go away.

327
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:46,875
Who do?

328
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,375
The people who are stuck in here.

329
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:52,875
But they're not connected to us,
so... doesn't matter.

330
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,041
We...

331
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,625
are connected?

332
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:57,625
Sure.

333
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:58,791
'Cause you know me.

334
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,666
No, I... I don't.

335
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,333
You don't remember?

336
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,916
-Look, kid, we've never met before. I'm--
-Travis.

337
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,500
How do you know my name?

338
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,000
You're looking for Becky.

339
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,416
You...

340
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,500
You know Becky?

341
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,166
Of course.

342
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,791
Wait, how's that even...
Who the hell are you?

343
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,000
Tobin.

344
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:23,916
Tobin?

345
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,625
You really don't remember?

346
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,416
Look, do you know where she is?

347
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,291
You do, don't you?

348
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,125
Hey, you gotta tell me!

349
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:39,875
Tell me!

350
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:40,833
Where is she?

351
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,916
Look at me! Where is she?

352
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,458
I can show you.

353
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:48,875
-But...
-But what?

354
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,583
-Are you sure you wanna see her?
-Of course! Just...

355
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:55,416
Please.

356
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,000
Tobin.

357
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:58,291
All right.

358
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,708
But you gotta stay close.

359
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,833
There.

360
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,250
Becky?

361
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:38,250
Becky?

362
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:39,958
Becky!

363
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,500
Becky. No.

364
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:47,791
Becky.

365
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,416
Oh, Becky.

366
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:51,958
The field doesn't move dead things.

367
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,666
It makes them easier to find.

368
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my...

369
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,000
Help!

370
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,000
Tobin?

371
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,000
Tobin!

372
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,416
Well, we don't know
whose car it is...

373
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:56,666
Hello?

374
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,333
Don't cross the road!

375
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:00,250
-Hello!
- Tobin, keep an eye on Freddy.

376
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,166
Hey!

377
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,083
Hey! I'm stuck in here!

378
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:05,541
Help me!

379
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,500
Help me!

380
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,791
Hello? Is someone out there?

381
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:12,333
Tobin?

382
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,291
Tobin, is that you?

383
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,791
-Tobin, it's Travis.

384
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,416
What, you... you don't remember me now?

385
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,000
Over there, Mommy. Do you hear him?

386
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,916
What? Where, honey?

387
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,083
In the grass.

388
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,125
He knows my name.

389
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,416
-Are you sure?
- Tobin?

390
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,833
-It's okay, Freddy. Stay.
- Help me!

391
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:38,333
-Get out! Get somebody.
-We'll close when I get back next week.

392
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,416
Okay?

393
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,875
-What?

394
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,041
-No. No, no, no. I'm telling you.
- Freddy!

395
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,125
Don't back out of escrow.

396
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,750
-You're not overpaying.
-Tobin! Damn it!

397
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,375
-Ross!
-Uh, just a minute, please.

398
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,916
- Freddy!

399
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,833
Toby, stay close.
Don't go in there, it's private property.

400
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,166
He went after Freddy.

401
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:00,708
Toby!

402
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,458
Tobin!

403
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,791
Toby, where are ya?

404
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,416
- Tobin!
- Freddy!

405
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,875
Toby, don't worry about Freddy.
Just come back to us.

406
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,083
Tobin, where are you, honey?

407
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,000
Toby!

408
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,291
Freddy!

409
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,166
Freddy!

410
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:18,958
Tobin!

411
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,708
If you're still outside the grass,
don't come back in here!

412
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,375
Tobin, where are you?

413
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,583
I'm over here, Mommy.

414
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:28,375
Tobin Humbolt, didn't you hear
your mother? Come back here!

415
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:29,750
Honey, can you see him?

416
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,083
-Where is he?
- Over here!

417
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,541
- Sounds like he's in front of us.
-Are you Tobin's dad?

418
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,500
Yeah. Who are you? What's going on?

419
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:38,250
-Don't come in here!
- Little late for that, buddy.

420
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,583
Tobin.

421
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,583
Where are you, Tobin?

422
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,083
Tobin.

423
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,916
Honey, I'm getting scared.

424
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,333
It's only a field.

425
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:50,125
That guy, though, I'm not so sure about.

426
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:52,625
Toby, don't let that man get near you,
okay? Don't talk to him.

427
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:53,916
If you see him, you run.

428
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,333
I'm afraid, Daddy!

429
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,708
Did you hear that? He went right by us.

430
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:58,958
- No, honey, no!
-Tobin!

431
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,625
-He went the other way!
-Tobin!

432
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:01,958
Natalie!

433
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,583
Natalie, wait!

434
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:06,833
Natalie!

435
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,083
- Tobin?

436
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,666
Natalie!

437
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,416
Toby!

438
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:23,875
Natalie!

439
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:26,791
Toby.

440
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,291
Natalie.

441
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:35,541
Okay. Okay, Rossy boy. Hold it together.

442
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,458
Stay positive.
That's what's gonna get you out of this.

443
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,708
It's gonna get you out of this.

444
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,583
"Mind that's light sells right."

445
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:48,500
"Mind that's light sells right." Right?
"The mind that's light sells right."

446
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,958
Right? "The mind that's light sells right.
The mind that's light sells right.

447
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,000
The mind that..."

448
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,166
Mind... Fuck.

449
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,500
Fuck. This fucking kid. Fucking kid.

450
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:02,958
Can't listen?

451
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,750
You can't just fucking listen?

452
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:09,875
Maybe if your mother acted like a mother
for once, kept an eye on you.

453
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:13,708
Tobin!

454
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:16,208
Natalie!

455
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,708
Help!

456
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,375
Help!

457
00:37:58,958 --> 00:37:59,791
Hello?

458
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:01,750
Is someone out there?

459
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,333
Help!

460
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,791
- I'm lost in here!
- Sounds like he's in trouble.

461
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,875
-I've been trying to get to the road...

462
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,250
...but I can't find it!

463
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,208
Okay.

464
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:12,250
We better haul him out.

465
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,541
It's really hot.

466
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,083
Careful.
Don't slide down into that ditch.

467
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:22,125
Watch your arm. I'm gonna pull this thing
off the side of the road.

468
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,833
Help me!

469
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:52,291
Help me!

470
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,291
Where are you?

471
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,791
Are you coming?

472
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,916
There once was
a man named McSweeney

473
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,375
Who spilled some gin on his weenie

474
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,583
Just to be couth, he added vermouth

475
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,500
And slipped his girl a martini

476
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:26,125
Oh, that's charming.

477
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:31,125
Hey, you guys,
are you looking for me? I'm scared!

478
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,041
Yes. Yes. Hang on.

479
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:34,583
Becky!

480
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:35,916
Becky, keep talking.

481
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,083
There once was a woman named Jill...

482
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:41,041
-Becky?
-...Who swallowed an exploding pill

483
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,291
They found her vagina in North Carolina--

484
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,000
Stop, stop. I overshot you.

485
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:45,916
Becky?

486
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:47,708
Becky!

487
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,166
Cal, are you in here?

488
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,208
Hello?

489
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,875
- Is someone else out there?

490
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,041
Becky, it's me, Travis!

491
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:58,958
Travis?

492
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:00,791
I'm in here!

493
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,208
I'm in here, too!

494
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:03,125
What?

495
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,125
How...
How the hell did you get here?

496
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,625
I don't know, but I'm here.

497
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,458
Why? Why the fuck are you here?

498
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,166
I...

499
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,375
I came looking for you.

500
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:15,916
But how did you get here before us?

501
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,166
I don't know.
But it doesn't matter now.

502
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,583
You're here.

503
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:22,666
We're all here.

504
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,291
It doesn't matter.

505
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,875
Travis?

506
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:27,250
Is that you?

507
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:29,000
Tobin?

508
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:31,458
You okay?

509
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,458
I found Freddy.

510
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:35,625
-He's dead.
-Freddy?

511
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,625
-Someone killed him.
-Freddy?

512
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:39,000
Who's Freddy?

513
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,083
My dog.

514
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,750
His guts are all out.

515
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,583
Tobin...

516
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,375
are you with Freddy now?

517
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,333
Yeah.

518
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:49,958
Okay.

519
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:51,916
Okay, just stay where you are.

520
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,666
Okay? Don't move.

521
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,083
We're gonna come to you.

522
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:56,791
All right? Just...

523
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,416
just keep talking.

524
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,166
Do you hear that? Becky? Cal?

525
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,041
Yeah, but we already tried that.

526
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,666
And it didn't work.

527
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,916
Well, this time, I think it might.

528
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,958
Follow Tobin's voice, okay?

529
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:09,875
Tobin?

530
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,000
Start talking!

531
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,333
Like what Becky was doing?

532
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:14,250
Yeah.

533
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,750
-Yeah, just like that.
-Okay.

534
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:20,375
There once was a man named McSweeney

535
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,416
Who spilled some gin on his weenie?

536
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,708
Just to be couth, he...

537
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,833
Um...

538
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,750
I forgot the next part.

539
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,333
He put something on his weenie

540
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:37,875
Uh... And then slipped his girl a martini?

541
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,333
What's a martini?

542
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:45,583
It's a drink.

543
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:47,208
You're Travis?

544
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:52,250
And that's a dirty rhyme, not for kids.

545
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,166
- Becky!
- Oh!

546
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,458
-Thank God!
-Oh, God!

547
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,666
It's okay. It's okay.

548
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,708
What the fuck is going on?

549
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:16,583
The field...

550
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,083
it doesn't move dead things.

551
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,125
That doesn't make any sense.

552
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,833
Name one thing in here that does.

553
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,125
So, explain to us again how you got here.

554
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,416
I followed you.

555
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,416
You must have been right on our asses
the whole way.

556
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,375
Oh, no, no. I came after.

557
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,083
After what?

558
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:36,916
After...

559
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,750
you didn't show up in San Diego.

560
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,375
We just left two days ago.

561
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:45,291
No.

562
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,875
No, it was longer than that.
It was more like... two months.

563
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,416
Now, that really doesn't make any sense.

564
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,583
I think we have to focus
on how the hell we get out.

565
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:57,500
Well, I'm not making Becky
blindly walk through Wonderland anymore.

566
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,916
-We need some kind of plan.
-Well, we can't just sit here.

567
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,541
-Are you okay?

568
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:03,958
Yeah, fine.

569
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:13,916
-I think we have to get moving.
- Yeah.

570
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,625
No, I agree. Let's just go.

571
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:17,333
-Well, in which direction?
-I don't know!

572
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:19,083
In any direction.

573
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,625
Why? What's the point?

574
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:23,000
The point is I don't want to stay here.

575
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,541
Someone is watching us.

576
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,750
I can feel it.

577
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:28,916
Okay.

578
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:30,666
Tobin,

579
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,791
-hop on my shoulders.
-Okay.

580
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,416
Okay.

581
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,083
Okay.

582
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,125
Do you see anything other than grass?

583
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,250
No.

584
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,708
Just grass...

585
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,625
and more grass.

586
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:50,583
-Wait!
- What?

587
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:52,583
I think I see something.

588
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,625
It's a building, I think.

589
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:56,458
That church?

590
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:59,375
No, I can't tell. It's too far away.

591
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,666
-Okay, which way is it?
-That way.

592
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:17,625
So, you saw our car at the church
and you didn't call anybody?

593
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,666
No, Cal, I didn't.

594
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,375
You still see it?

595
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,583
Getting closer.

596
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:30,083
I don't suppose you, um, told anyone
where you were headed, did you?

597
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,333
No.

598
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:34,875
Not that it'll make much difference.

599
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:37,750
Somebody'll look for us.

600
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,333
Your folks are worried sick.

601
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:43,583
What could they do?
You ask me, I don't think anyone's coming.

602
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:45,500
You did.

603
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:49,166
Yeah, and...

604
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:52,416
everyone thought I was crazy for trying.

605
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,708
Yeah. It's been a while since I checked.

606
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,875
-Are you okay?

607
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:04,875
Mm-hmm.

608
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:07,125
Fine. Just, um...

609
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,166
Just a kick...

610
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,750
I think.

611
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,500
Is the baby coming soon?

612
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,666
She's due in three months.

613
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,500
-She?
- Yeah.

614
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,625
Didn't wanna wait to find out.

615
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,375
Ginny is what I'm calling her.

616
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:25,541
For now, anyways,
after my great aunt Virginia.

617
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:27,000
Ginny.

618
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,083
You don't like it?

619
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,250
No. No, it's...

620
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:33,791
It's cool.

621
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,166
Old-school.

622
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,500
Yeah. She's lively.

623
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:41,250
Moves around a lot.

624
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:44,541
Here.

625
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:49,291
-Whoa!

626
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:50,458
Wow.

627
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,791
Lively is the word for it.

628
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:55,250
Yeah.

629
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:07,041
Hello?

630
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:10,583
<i>Don't let Cal hurt Travis!</i>

631
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:12,375
<i>Don't leave him!</i>

632
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,791
<i>Just stay with him.</i>

633
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,541
<i>Or else we're gonna keep making</i>
<i>the same mistake!</i>

634
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,291
Hello? Who is this?

635
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,291
Hello? What's going on?

636
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,708
What the hell was that?

637
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,791
One more reason to keep moving.

638
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,041
Yeah.

639
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,166
Becky!

640
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:27,750
Becky?

641
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:34,916
Becky!

642
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,833
Beck!

643
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:36,750
Becky! Beck.

644
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:37,833
-Becky!
- Wake up!

645
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,041
-Move. Move! Move!
-Hey!

646
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,166
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

647
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:51,875
-Okay.

648
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,541
-No, no, no.
-Come here.

649
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:54,541
-It's okay.
-Come here.

650
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,041
-Daddy!
-Toby! Oh, thank God.

651
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,166
Toby, thank God! Oh!

652
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,250
-The baby's moving.
-Hey, you okay?

653
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:06,000
It's probably just her condition
and a touch of heatstroke. That's all.

654
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:07,083
She's gonna be fine.

655
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:08,625
We all are.

656
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,583
You're Ross. You're... Tobin's dad.

657
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:12,958
Yeah.

658
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,208
Hey, don't worry.
Your mother, she's out there.

659
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:17,708
We're gonna find her,
and then we're leaving.

660
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:18,666
All of us.

661
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,250
You found a way out?

662
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,875
Yeah, I got to the road, but I wasn't
gonna leave without my family.

663
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:25,416
How?

664
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:29,416
Well, it's not a straight line.
I can say that much.

665
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,208
-Which way were you headed?
-Towards that building.

666
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,333
-Building?
-We were almost there.

667
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:36,750
Come here.

668
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,125
All right, come on.
Up on my shoulders, Tobin.

669
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,333
It's gone.

670
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,250
That's the way
things work around here.

671
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,041
But I got the golden ticket,
for any takers.

672
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,875
Is that CCR?

673
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,250
Well, folk song, originally.

674
00:50:57,958 --> 00:50:59,791
Let me guess. Lead singer in a band?

675
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:03,500
Four-piece,
with a weekly gig at the local?

676
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:04,666
-Kinda.
-Hmm.

677
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,416
I'm a good judge of people.
You gotta be, in my field.

678
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,708
Field!

679
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:14,125
Yeah, real estate's my game.

680
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:17,833
We were on a little family vacay
through the heartland.

681
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:21,041
It was going pretty well
till we ran into you.

682
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,458
I...

683
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,041
tried to warn you.

684
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:26,000
I'm just giving you a hard time,
that's all.

685
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:30,541
I know it's not your fault.

686
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,125
Fate conspired.

687
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:35,000
Isn't that always the way?

688
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:37,708
You know, believe it or not,
before I ended up here,

689
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:39,958
before, uh, real estate was my game,

690
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,375
I played a mean guitar...

691
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:44,500
in a gospel band.

692
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:46,208
Yeah.

693
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:50,041
Me and my Gibson and Jesus
were gonna rock the world.

694
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,750
But, you know,
got married and had a kid, and...

695
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,916
Those were the days, though.

696
00:51:57,291 --> 00:52:00,875
Still, nothin', but nothin'
compares to this.

697
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
What the hell is it?

698
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,083
See for yourself.

699
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:24,791
There's carvings on it.

700
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,666
They look really old.

701
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,875
Are those native?

702
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,208
Oh, I think it's a safe bet
it's been here

703
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:34,041
since before the Kiowa hunted
on the Osage Cuestas.

704
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:36,750
Older than the hills.

705
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:42,250
Probably was here before the glaciers came
and carried the hills away.

706
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:47,166
You realize we're in the center
of the contiguous United States.

707
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,958
Smack-dab in the middle of the continent.

708
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:55,083
Ah, hell, I'd hazard this stone...

709
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,500
is the center of the center.

710
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:00,958
We didn't come here
for a goddamn sightseeing tour.

711
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:03,791
You were gonna show us the way out.

712
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:07,125
Oh, but darlin', I have.

713
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:09,166
You just have to look.

714
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:25,375
Is there a map on it or something?

715
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:27,833
Just put your hand on it and you'll know.

716
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,500
What's that supposed to mean?

717
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,500
Stop!

718
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:49,541
- Nat?
-Mommy!

719
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,500
Come here. Oh!

720
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:52,916
Been looking everywhere for you.

721
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:57,458
-Thank God you're all right.
-Stay away! Stay away from us!

722
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:03,083
Whatever he told you,
whatever he said to you, he's lying!

723
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:05,208
What? What are you talking about?

724
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:06,750
You know.

725
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:10,458
All I know, all I care about,
is that we're finally together.

726
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:12,416
Everything's gonna be
all right now, honey.

727
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,291
Now what is it?

728
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,375
-What is it, honey?
-I saw...

729
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:21,916
I saw her.

730
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:23,708
She was...

731
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:26,041
She was...

732
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:28,375
She was...

733
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:30,333
She was what?

734
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,666
She was what? Just say it.

735
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:36,291
She wasn't...

736
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,458
She wasn't alive.

737
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:42,458
I saw her on the ground
some ways back.

738
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:44,000
I saw her, I'm sure.

739
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:45,458
I'm sure I saw her.

740
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,833
Toby...

741
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,750
Mommy's just a little confused right now.

742
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:51,416
Why wouldn't she be?

743
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:53,708
Days without food or water.

744
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,000
I am not confused.

745
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,875
I saw her. I saw her, and you...

746
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,041
You were...

747
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,375
You were gonna...

748
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:04,708
I was gonna what?

749
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:08,000
You were gonna hurt me.

750
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:09,583
Hurt you?

751
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:12,416
-How could you even think that?

752
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,750
We're all in this together.

753
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:15,666
We're like a family now.

754
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:18,083
Right, Travis? We solid?

755
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:40,541
We have to go.

756
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,250
We have to go.

757
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:46,458
Look, thanks for your help,
mister, but, uh...

758
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,333
I think we're gonna go
our own way now...

759
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:52,583
Do you wanna come with us?

760
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:56,916
No, just a minute. Just hear me out.

761
00:55:58,666 --> 00:55:59,500
This rock,

762
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:02,458
once you touch it, you'll know.

763
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,041
It's like a... whoosh!

764
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:06,583
It's... It's better than anything.

765
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:08,166
It's like accepting the host.

766
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:11,458
I know that sounds like blasphemy,
but it's true.

767
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:13,083
You think this is just chance?

768
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,708
Folks are brought into the grass
for a reason.

769
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:18,625
We're all here
because we've got stuff to work out.

770
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:21,625
And this rock, in its wisdom,

771
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:24,625
brought our two families together
to do just that.

772
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:26,625
All it's asking for is a little faith.

773
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:32,416
Five little fingers on its face
and you will be redeemed!

774
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:37,625
All your sins, all your trespasses,
all your regrets will melt away

775
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:40,000
and the world will open up like a flower!

776
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:42,125
Oh, it's a beautiful thing.

777
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,666
You gotta trust me on this.

778
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,541
I think you should let her go.

779
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,625
Or what?

780
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,250
Look, you don't have the advantage here.

781
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:07,916
Is that a threat?

782
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:10,875
It's pretty simple math.

783
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,208
If you think I was doing the soft sell

784
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:15,625
because I was afraid
of going the other way,

785
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,250
well, you got another think comin'.

786
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,958
It's better that you come to the rock
on your own.

787
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,208
Open your heart to it, like I did.

788
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,791
Now, what I really wanna know...

789
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,125
is how did you get here?

790
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:33,916
Because the rock wouldn't let you find us
unless it wanted you to.

791
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:37,833
Unless this isn't about you.

792
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:42,916
Right.

793
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,000
I get it.

794
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:48,500
This is about me.

795
00:57:57,291 --> 00:57:58,666
Looking for the hard sell?

796
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:00,791
Yeah.

797
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:01,708
Sure, I'm game.

798
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:03,208
-Travis!

799
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:04,208
-No!

800
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:05,625
-No!
-Go!

801
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,583
-No!
-Go!

802
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,000
Travis!

803
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:18,000
Stop! Stop!

804
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,875
-Cal! Cal!
-No. Come with--

805
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:23,416
Cal, help him!

806
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,291
-Please!
-I'm no fibber.

807
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:30,083
When you touch that rock,
you'll know everything I know.

808
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:33,000
Everything the grass knows,
including how to leave.

809
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:35,333
Only, you won't want to.

810
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,166
Tobin! Run! Run!

811
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:45,625
-Mom! No!
- No!

812
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:48,875
-No!
-Mommy!

813
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,458
-Mommy!

814
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:51,583
-No.

815
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:52,625
Don't worry, son.

816
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:55,166
-It's just flesh.
- Mommy!

817
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,083
-And all flesh is grass.
-No!

818
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,875
Mommy! No!

819
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,541
Mommy! No!

820
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:10,458
-Mommy!

821
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:12,000
Mommy!

822
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,500
Go! Go! Get out!

823
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,000
Save your breath, kids.

824
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:33,583
You can't run from redemption.

825
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:39,000
He's right, you know?
Where are we gonna go?

826
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,875
Freddy!

827
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:42,791
Come on!

828
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:58,708
Come on! Hurry!

829
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:05,666
Cal!

830
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:18,791
What are we gonna do?

831
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,375
He'll find us. For sure, he'll find us.

832
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:23,333
Listen to me.
First thing we have to do

833
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:24,875
is you need to take hold of my hand.

834
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:25,958
It's okay, Tobin.

835
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:28,416
My daddy's right. We're grass.

836
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,583
We keep dying and coming back.

837
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:32,916
-Like Freddy did.
-One, two...

838
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:37,833
Here.

839
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:41,291
- Come here.

840
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:43,166
-Come here.

841
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,541
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

842
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:46,875
-Okay.

843
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:50,291
-I didn't know what to do.
-Yeah, you sure didn't.

844
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,958
Well, we wouldn't be in this mess
if it wasn't for you.

845
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:57,708
Okay, blaming each other
isn't gonna solve anything.

846
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:00,875
Well, all indicators are
that there's no way to solve this.

847
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,208
If we're just gonna go
round and round in circles,

848
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:05,708
I'll feel a lot better saying
what we all know.

849
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,458
It's not that simple.

850
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,958
Are you forgetting the detail
that he completely abandoned you?

851
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,708
That he totally threw you away?

852
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:13,916
That he wanted you
to abort your own baby?

853
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,416
Becky...

854
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:21,875
I'm sorry.

855
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:25,291
-I just wanted...
-You just wanted to what?

856
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:27,958
Look after me?

857
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:29,625
Protect me?

858
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,166
I need food.

859
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,666
I need water. I need a place to sleep.

860
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:36,875
What I don't need
is any more brotherly love.

861
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:41,041
No. Cal's right.

862
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:42,916
I was an asshole.

863
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,250
And I made a mistake.

864
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:46,916
A big one.

865
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,625
But that's not the real reason
you don't like me.

866
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,125
-Is it, Cal?

867
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:54,125
It's a good start.

868
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:57,375
No, it's a good excuse,
but it's not the reason.

869
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:00,208
You didn't want me around
even before there was a baby.

870
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:01,875
The truth is, there's nothing

871
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:03,958
that I could have done
to make you like me,

872
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:07,000
because no one is ever gonna be
good enough for your little sister.

873
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:09,250
-A high school diploma would be nice.
-You know what?

874
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:11,250
I'm not quite the fuckup
that you think I am!

875
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:14,750
Oh, no. No, no. You're a real rock star.

876
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:18,541
You've sacrificed everything
for that ridiculous, infantile fantasy,

877
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:20,375
and now we're all suffering for it.

878
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:21,416
And you're a real hero.

879
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,208
Playing hubby to your little sister?

880
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:26,458
That's the next best thing to fucking her,
which is what you really want, isn't it?

881
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,208
Guys, stop it!

882
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:29,958
Stop it!

883
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:31,500
Stop it!

884
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,041
Open up!

885
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,083
Come on, this way!

886
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,583
Redemption is coming!

887
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:42,916
-Come on.

888
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:00,166
You okay?

889
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:02,166
Come on, hurry!

890
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:04,291
-Get the door!
- Yeah.

891
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:08,708
Okay.

892
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:11,208
He's not gonna get through that
without a sledgehammer.

893
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:12,958
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

894
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,666
What are we gonna do? We're stuck up here!

895
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,291
No, listen to me. When I drove here,
I saw this building from the road.

896
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,791
We saw it, too.

897
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:24,333
Yeah. The church,
it was just on the other side.

898
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:26,291
Okay.

899
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,166
-Are you okay?
-Mm-hmm.

900
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,208
Yeah, it's fine.

901
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:35,708
My God, there it is.

902
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:37,791
Spitting distance.

903
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:41,791
Only thing is, we go in that grass again
and we're back to square one.

904
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,083
Freddy?

905
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:52,166
Fucking dog gives me the creeps.

906
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:56,833
Where'd he go?

907
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,958
There, on the road.

908
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,083
A hole.

909
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:21,375
There's a hole.

910
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,583
The way out? You think that's it?

911
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:25,958
Maybe. But we're not there yet--

912
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,083
Tobin.

913
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:55,708
Tobin, I...

914
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,875
Becky, we've gotta get out of here.

915
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,208
Where's Travis?

916
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:10,708
He's coming.

917
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:16,500
Holes are everywhere, Calvin, my boy.

918
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,000
Life's full of 'em!

919
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:26,875
Tobin, come back!

920
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:30,083
-Travis!
<i>-</i>Beck, we have to keep moving!

921
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,583
We can't just leave!

922
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:33,791
I'll come back for him,
but we have to get you out!

923
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:36,083
I found a way. It's... It's right there.

924
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:37,625
Travis!

925
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:39,166
-We're so close!
-Travis!

926
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,208
Beck, I'm your brother,

927
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:43,333
and I'm telling you right now
to forget about that asshole.

928
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:50,750
Did you do something?

929
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,916
Beck.

930
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:55,708
I love you.

931
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:57,166
-Get away from me.
-Beck.

932
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:58,416
-No, wait.

933
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,708
-Beck, wait.
-No...

934
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,125
-Beck, please.
-No...

935
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:02,791
Please, Beck. Wait.

936
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,291
Thought that you would lose your sister
when you got out of here.

937
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:09,833
That the baby would bring her and Travis
together, you'd be left out in the cold.

938
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:12,333
You're probably right on that score.

939
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:14,625
Your mistake is thinking
you're ever leaving.

940
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:31,333
-I'm impressed. Yeah.

941
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:34,291
Of course, I was a bit of a track star
back in the day.

942
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,250
Played some ball, too.

943
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,375
- I know.

944
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:39,833
I know. I know.

945
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:44,333
You're thinking if you had just
turned left instead of right,

946
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:45,791
you could've gotten away from me.

947
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,000
But you did go left,

948
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:49,333
-and you turned right.

949
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:51,208
And you kept running
and didn't turn at all.

950
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:53,708
But here,

951
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:57,416
in the garden of forking paths,

952
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,750
you didn't make any one choice.

953
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:02,416
You made every choice.

954
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,916
And they all led back to me.

955
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:38,166
Travis?

956
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,208
Travis!

957
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:44,000
Becky?

958
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,041
Becky?

959
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,208
Becky?

960
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,208
Becky?

961
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:13,958
Becky?

962
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,916
Travis?

963
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:17,666
You okay?

964
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:21,416
I'm scared.

965
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,708
Travis, where are you?

966
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:27,916
What happened?

967
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:28,916
Your brother...

968
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:35,625
I think he loves you a little too much.

969
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:38,250
But this isn't his fault.

970
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,250
I did this.

971
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:46,333
I had my chance with you,
and I threw it away.

972
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,333
Whatever happens...

973
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:51,750
I want you to know I...

974
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:54,250
I'm glad you didn't listen to me.

975
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:57,958
I'm glad you kept Ginny.

976
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:05,583
Becky?

977
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:11,500
There's, um...

978
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:18,458
There's something I didn't tell you.

979
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:24,375
I was gonna give her up.

980
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,041
I got scared.

981
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,666
I didn't think I was ready to be a mom.

982
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:36,416
That's why we were, um,
going to San Diego.

983
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:40,125
There was a family there.

984
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:42,583
-You don't want that anymore?

985
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:46,083
What difference does it make now?

986
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,916
We're gonna get out of here.

987
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:51,958
I'm gonna find a way.
Our baby deserves to live.

988
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:55,416
She's a strong one.

989
01:09:58,041 --> 01:09:59,541
I feel her kicking.

990
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:04,333
I wish I could just touch your hand.

991
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,500
It's right here.

992
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:16,708
-Becky?

993
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:17,916
Get away from me!

994
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,083
-Becky, what's going on?

995
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,791
How funny. This is where I tussled
with Natalie for the first time.

996
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:29,583
I tried to show her the way,
but she just wouldn't listen.

997
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:31,208
-Come on.

998
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,750
You wanna touch the rock, darlin'?

999
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:41,125
Huh?

1000
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:44,791
You wanna lay on it naked?

1001
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:47,291
Wanna feel me in you?

1002
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:51,333
Beneath the pinwheel stars

1003
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:54,875
while the grass sings our names?

1004
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,208
It's poetry, huh?

1005
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:02,541
Blood is nice,

1006
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:09,208
but tears are better
for an old, thirsty rock like that.

1007
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:14,125
-It has to be quick, though.

1008
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:16,208
Don't wanna do it in front of the kid.

1009
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:55,958
No! No!

1010
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:02,291
No!

1011
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:06,416
Travis!

1012
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,250
Travis!

1013
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:26,833
<i>Hello?</i>

1014
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:29,083
Listen to me.

1015
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,916
Don't let Cal hurt Travis.

1016
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,291
Don't leave him.

1017
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,541
Just stay with him.

1018
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:42,541
Or else we're gonna keep making
the same mistakes forever.

1019
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:43,708
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

1020
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:45,666
<i>-Hello? What's going on?</i>

1021
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:58,291
Baby... Baby...

1022
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,125
Little baby...

1023
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,375
Baby...

1024
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:04,166
-It's okay.
-Baby...

1025
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,750
Here, here, here, here.

1026
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,958
-No, not too fast.

1027
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:12,291
I don't want you to get sick.

1028
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:16,333
-May I have a look? My baby?
-It's okay.

1029
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:18,291
-I've got her. I've got her.
-Baby...

1030
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:20,166
She's right here.

1031
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,500
I've got her.

1032
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,625
Isn't she great?

1033
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,208
Out of the oven and baked just right.

1034
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:33,041
Aren't you the Mother Mary?

1035
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:36,666
Wonder when the Wise Men will come.

1036
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:40,791
I wonder what gifts they'll have for us.

1037
01:17:42,916 --> 01:17:43,875
Hmm...

1038
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:59,750
There once was a farmer from Leeds

1039
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:03,541
Who swallowed a bag full of seeds

1040
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,750
-Big bunches of grass...
-Mm.

1041
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:11,416
-...sprouted out of his ass...

1042
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:14,291
And his balls...

1043
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:17,416
-grew all shaggy with weeds
-Mm.

1044
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,208
Mm. Mm.

1045
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:23,125
Mm...

1046
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,875
Cal...

1047
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:29,375
What is that?

1048
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,208
What am I eating?

1049
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,333
Grass.

1050
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:35,208
It's just grass.

1051
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:39,583
And seeds and so on.

1052
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,041
-Mm.

1053
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:45,041
Cows do it all the time.

1054
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:55,041
Here's another piece.

1055
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:55,958
Mm.

1056
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:57,333
-It's good for you.
-Mm.

1057
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,541
It's good for your soul.

1058
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:05,625
Mm.

1059
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:07,791
Mm.

1060
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,541
- Yeah.
-Mm.

1061
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,875
You ate it all.

1062
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:13,416
Yeah.

1063
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:15,958
That's a good girl.

1064
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,416
It tastes like...

1065
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,708
Like what?

1066
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:24,875
Like...

1067
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,125
Like...

1068
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,333
You?

1069
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:40,666
Becky?

1070
01:19:44,041 --> 01:19:45,000
Becky!

1071
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:01,000
Becky?

1072
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,583
Baby.

1073
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:19,000
Baby.

1074
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:28,625
Oh, no.

1075
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:33,333
Oh.

1076
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:40,083
Oh, please.

1077
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:43,958
Please, no.

1078
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:46,041
My daddy killed the baby.

1079
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,291
I know he did.

1080
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:53,583
I found Cal.

1081
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,750
He killed him, too.

1082
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:00,541
This is never gonna stop.

1083
01:21:01,416 --> 01:21:03,666
He's gonna keep killing us over...

1084
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:05,250
and over...

1085
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:07,041
and over again.

1086
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,125
And it's never gonna stop.

1087
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:19,375
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

1088
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:24,000
But he's watching us right now.

1089
01:21:34,416 --> 01:21:35,666
You out there, Ross?

1090
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:39,916
Why hide?

1091
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:41,666
Huh?

1092
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,583
If you wanna finish us,

1093
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,791
then just do it already!

1094
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:51,083
I'm here!

1095
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:53,041
You see?

1096
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:54,750
I'm waiting!

1097
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,500
- Travis!

1098
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:58,333
No.

1099
01:21:58,416 --> 01:21:59,250
I don't see.

1100
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:00,833
Your honey took my eye out.

1101
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:03,791
But you know what?

1102
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,041
Eyes are deceiving around here.

1103
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:07,750
I'm better off without it.

1104
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:11,666
Dad!

1105
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:17,375
Too bad, kid. I liked ya.

1106
01:22:17,458 --> 01:22:18,958
Saw a seed of myself in there.

1107
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:23,083
Dad, no!

1108
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,333
No, Dad. No!

1109
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:40,958
All I wanted...

1110
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,250
was to help you find redemption.

1111
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:47,375
- Stop!

1112
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:50,166
God knows you're the one
who needed it the most.

1113
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:53,083
Maybe next time.

1114
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,875
Travis!

1115
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,875
Ready for yours?

1116
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,208
No!

1117
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:11,416
Gorgeous, isn't she?

1118
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,000
-No!
-It wants you to touch it.

1119
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:17,375
This field needs it.

1120
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,208
More than the rain.

1121
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:22,666
It's so easy, son.

1122
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,958
-Redemption is so very, very easy.

1123
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:14,625
I'm not coming back here!

1124
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:18,708
And neither are you!

1125
01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:26,958
Travis, don't.

1126
01:26:28,708 --> 01:26:30,500
Don't. No. No. No!

1127
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:32,541
No!

1128
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:33,708
If you touch it...

1129
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:36,166
you'll never leave.

1130
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:35,291
Travis?

1131
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:44,208
Follow me.

1132
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,458
I'm not leaving.

1133
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:20,666
But you...

1134
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,291
you don't belong here.

1135
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:27,500
And neither does Becky.

1136
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:32,541
Don't let them in.

1137
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:39,000
<i>Don't let them in, Tobin.</i>

1138
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:57,083
Help!

1139
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:58,708
Hello?

1140
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:00,875
Is someone out there?

1141
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:02,625
Help!

1142
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,375
I'm lost in here.

1143
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:06,750
Sounds like he's really in trouble.

1144
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:08,708
I've been trying to get to the road,

1145
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:10,416
-but I can't find it!

1146
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:13,125
Okay.

1147
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:14,875
We better haul him out.

1148
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:17,083
No! Don't go in there!

1149
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,125
Wait! No!

1150
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:23,708
Don't go in there!

1151
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:25,666
Stay away from it. Stay away.

1152
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,041
Are you okay?

1153
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:28,083
Help!

1154
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:29,125
Wasn't he just...

1155
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:30,708
Didn't we hear him...

1156
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:32,958
Help!

1157
01:30:34,416 --> 01:30:35,666
Don't listen to him.

1158
01:30:36,041 --> 01:30:37,583
Get back in the car. You have to go.

1159
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:39,833
-Kid, where are your parents?
-It doesn't matter. Please.

1160
01:30:39,916 --> 01:30:41,958
-We just have to go. Get in the car.
-Okay.

1161
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:44,375
- I can't find my way out!
-What do we do?

1162
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:46,291
I mean,
it sure sounds like he's in trouble.

1163
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:48,541
No. No! No, don't let him go in!

1164
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:52,083
If he goes in, you'll go in
and you'll never get out.

1165
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:53,458
-Please!
-Okay...

1166
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:56,166
Please.

1167
01:30:58,166 --> 01:30:59,541
Are you coming?

1168
01:31:01,291 --> 01:31:02,541
Help me!

1169
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,791
-Where did you get this?
-Travis.

1170
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:09,291
Cal, wait!

1171
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:11,666
Get back here right now.

1172
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:14,166
Hey! Don't leave!

1173
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,291
Look.

1174
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:19,666
He said he got this from Travis.

1175
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,791
Travis?

1176
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,458
I'll explain later, I promise.

1177
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:24,666
But right now, we have to go. Please.

1178
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:26,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1179
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:27,583
-Hey.

1180
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:28,500
Are you okay?

1181
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:30,208
We have to go.

1182
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:32,208
What about the kid?

1183
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:33,416
Can you hear me?

1184
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:38,125
Where are you?

1185
01:31:38,208 --> 01:31:40,458
You've gotta help me get out of here!

1186
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:43,125
Something's not right about this.

1187
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,458
We need to leave.

1188
01:31:46,791 --> 01:31:49,000
-Please.
-All right, get in.

1189
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:56,916
Help me!

1190
01:31:58,916 --> 01:32:01,458
Please! Don't leave!

1191
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:11,416
It's okay.

1192
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,000
It's gonna be okay.

1193
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:19,166
-Wait.
-What? What?

1194
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,333
Let's take him to Topeka.

1195
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:24,833
Find a police station.

1196
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:27,083
-That's back the way we came.
-Yeah, I know.

1197
01:32:28,083 --> 01:32:30,000
I thought we said we were gonna go on.

1198
01:32:31,583 --> 01:32:33,166
I should've never left.

1199
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,000
Are you sure?

1200
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:40,458
What about that family in San Diego?

1201
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:46,833
I have my own family now.
