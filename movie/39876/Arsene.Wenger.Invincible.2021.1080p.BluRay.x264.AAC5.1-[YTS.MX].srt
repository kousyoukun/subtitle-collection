To dedicate your whole life to that...

9
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,079
is a bit frightening.

10
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,719

I say it many times,

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,719
January 2nd, 1989.

45
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,399
My first time at Highbury.

At half time...

47
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,479
I wanted to smoke my cigarette

David Dein's wife

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,119
gave me a light.

51
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,519
Barbara Dein told me

52
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,159
"Would you like to meet my husband?
He's a director here."

53
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,799
DAVID DEIN: I have a personal motto.
It's the motto of the turtle.

54
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,919
You don't get anywhere
unless you stick your neck out.

55
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,759
So I said, "Well...

56
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,159
what are you doing this evening?"
He said, "Nothing."

57
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,879
I said, "Well, would you like
to come out to dinner?"

58
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,319
He said, "I'd love to."

59

Around the time

63
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,999
Johann Cruyff's name
was being mentioned.

64
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,879

"Arséne Who?"

72
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,999
He looked like
a university lecturer.

REPORTER:
And so comes the scholar...

74
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,519
What on Earth's he got?
A Master's degree. Master's.

75
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:24,919
I know he's from France.

76
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,159
He's Swedish, isn't he?
— No!

77
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,999
I know he's a Frenchman.

78
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,599

the game was going more global

84
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:46,559

85
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,519

we had to confess.

112
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,599
My father was an accountant
at Bugatti.

113
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,439
My mother had inherited this bar.

114
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,479
It was one of the three
or four in the village

115
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:20,839

WENGER IN FRENCH:

117
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:47,359
I started to listen to people

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,319
to observe people.

119
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,399
It was a great psychological experience
for a little boy.

120
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,919
I realised quickly

121
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,839
that we had problems
to win football games.

122
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,119
So I took my Mass book with me

123
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,519

181
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,199
Look at him. Look at the camera.

182
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,559
WENGER: They were a group
of very strong personalities.

183
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,719
Nice one.
- I love you, Dicko.

184
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,679
I love you too.

185
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,399
WENGER:
A group of men.

186
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:10,999
They were not always easy.

187
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,199
But on Saturday...

188
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,759
you could walk out with them.

189
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,639
You knew they were ready
for a fight.

192
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,959
And I'm not singing

INDISTINCT CHATTER

194
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,799
LEE DIXON:
His biggest asset on the training ground

195
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,039
was allowing his players

196
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,519
to express themselves
and work problems out on the pitch.

197
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,359
Good ball, yes.

198
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,879
MARTIN KEOWN: By the time
you reach 30 years of age

199
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,559
you've kind of set out your character,
haven't you?

200
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,799
As how you wanna play football
and how you see it...

201
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,359
and when Wenger arrived

202
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,399
he gave a renaissance, really,
for that group.

203
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,919
WENGER:
There was a drinking culture.

204
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,479
I always felt it's stupid
to work the whole week in training

205
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,799
and then to kill yourself
outside the pitch.

206
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,759
I cut that all off.

207
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,039
They had to change their habits.

208
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,639
WRIGHT:
It changed from night to day.

209
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:22,319
No tea, no sugar, nothing.

210
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:25,079
All you could drink was water
and the food what was provided.

211
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:29,439
Changed it to suit us, so we ain't got
no butter or anything in it.

212
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:33,239
BERGKAMP: Immediately we had success
with his way of thinking.

213
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,639
That made the English players realise

214
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:38,279
"OK, wait a minute,
this is what we want".

215
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,159
We didn't know if it was
the stretching

216
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:43,519
it was the vitamins we were taking

217
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,079
it was the new diet.

218
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,559
We felt like supermen.

219
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:54,479
WENGER:
Every win gave me a bit of time.

220
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,119
But when you started to win

221
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,759
it created some adverse reactions.

222
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,159
Private attacks.

223
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,479
Vicious attacks.

224
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:15,439
I visited my parents in Strasbourg...

225
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,439
and when I came back, I took a cab

226
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,999
and he told me,
"Why did you resign?"

227
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,839
I said, "Who told you that?"

228
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,959
REPORTER:
He arrived just seven weeks ago...

229
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,239
WENGER: He said,
"It's been announced on the radio."

230
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,919
...but now he's at the center

231
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:32,519
of suggestions about
his own personal life.

232
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,599
PRESS OFFICER: ...from ITN, they'll be
asking you a couple of questions.

233
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,759
WENGER: So I had to
improvise a press conference

234
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:44,279
on the stairs in front of Highbury...

235
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:47,519
JOURNALIST:

236
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,639
Sorry?

237
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,679
...to say "I have not resigned.

238
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,679
You know, if you have anything
against me

239
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:53,999
bring it out...

240
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,999
and let's deal with it."

241
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,119
JOURNALIST:

242
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,279
No.

243
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,759
WRIGHT:
This obviously started from nothing

244
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,919
but he had to come out
and say something.

245
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,119
It really was so callous and nasty.

246
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,319
JOURNALIST:

247
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,559
HE LAUGHS

248
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,239
"Oh, we have photos
that are very bad for you."

249
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,879
Bring me somebody who can speak
about my private life.

250
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,919
! have a private life, like everybody,
like you.

251
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,279
Of course, they had nothing.

252
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,559
WRIGHT:
There was a massive negativity

253
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,199
because he was a foreign manager

254
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,679
and he was doing stuff
that was alien to everybody.

255
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,559
People are afraid of things
that's different.

256
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,879
The natural thing to do is
to try and find fault

257
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:52,039
and try and create, um...

258
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,759
a problem.

259
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,519
What have you concrete?

260
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,039
From me, my life?

261
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,759
What do you know of my life
concretely?

262
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,879

MAN IN FRENCH:
— PATRICK VIEIRA IN FRENCH:

269
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,719
WENGER: Patrick was known
as a big talent in France

270
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:37,199
and considering that he was only 20...

271
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,959
it was a big chance for Arsenal
to take this player.

272
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,759
WENGER: First of all...
- PHOTOGRAPHER: Ready?

273
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,759
...you couldn't impress him.

274
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:47,839
<i>Ready to go.</i>

275
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,839
WENGER:
He wasn't scared of anybody.

276
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,719
VIEIRA:
Nobody knew who I was.

277
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,719
This tall guy has come in,
really skinny and have this kind of...

278
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,919
strange way of running.

279
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,879
But from the first game
that I played with the first team

280
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,079
I convince my teammates

281
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,959
that I can play in this club
and I can play on that level.

Here's Vieira...

283
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,719
it's a great run...

<i>he's still going...</i>

285
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,439

his skills, his running with the ball...

286
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,839
THEY LAUGH

287
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,799
"Jesus Christ, that's our player!"

288
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,159
VIEIRA:
Arséne of course was really important

289
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,599
he gave me that confidence
to express myself.

290
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,719
WENGER:
Everybody thought maybe the manager

291
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,679
doesn't know what he's doing,
but at least he brings a good player!

292
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:49,119

From '97 onwards

300
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:26,679
England became more open
to the rest of the world.

301
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,399
London became very cosmopolitan.

302
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:40,999
It coincided with the start
of an evolution in the English game.

Was it a penalty on Sunday?

The '97-'98 season

307
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,479
you could see there was something there
that was blossoming.

308
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,639
There was an old core
of English players

309
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,039
and a new clique
of foreign players.

310
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,119
I brought Emmanuel Petit in.

311
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,079
Morning.

312
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,879
WENGER: He was a more defensive
player than Patrick Vieira

313
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,719
so the two together, of course,
were two monsters.

314

315
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,159

I've gotta be honest about that.

00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:42,679
I mean, you see someone

485
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:47,399
Alex Ferguson was the dominant figure
in English football.

486
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:50,239
Everybody was scared of him,
from the press to the referees.

00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,079

(FRENCH)

881
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,519
WENGER:
I traveled around the world

882
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,919
my brother
didn't want to leave his village.

883
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:18,759
And football was not a job.

884
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:22,359
Football is something you do
when you don't work.

885
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,759
FERGUSON: People brought up
in these areas have a foundation.

886
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:33,719
The discipline and the work rate...

887
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:39,319
There's something that's driven
inside Arséne that said, "Well

888
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:41,159
I want better than this."

889
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:49,159
BERNADETTE:

890
00:56:53,919 --> 00:56:56,639
WENGER: My parents came
to watch Arsenal specially

891
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:57,999
when I won my first double.

892
00:56:59,279 --> 00:57:01,959
After that,
it was a bit more difficult.

893
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:07,519
My father maybe contributed more
than you'd think.

894
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:11,599
He never told me, "Well done".

895
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:13,519
No.

896
00:57:14,759 --> 00:57:16,399
He said, "You can do better".

897
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:19,359
That strive for perfection

898
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:22,199
that desire to do well
certainly comes from him.

899
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:28,199
At that time,
you educated people

900
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,199
to work hard, to give their best

901
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:32,999
and to be ready to suffer.

902
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:37,679
FERGUSON: This creates
a certain stubbornness about you

903
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:39,399
that you know
where you've come from.

904
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:42,519
That working-class ethic
is gonna be there all the time.

905
00:57:52,439 --> 00:57:54,479
WENGER:
Contrary to what people think

906
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:59,359
the 2004 season
was not the Rolls Royce season.

907
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:04,519
I was not sure that we could

908
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,959
continue the whole season unbeaten.

909
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,279
COMMENTATOR: ...and the whistle goes.
Arsenal have hung on.

You have to prepare.

911
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:16,559
You go out on a stormy night.

00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:18,559
COMMENTATOR:
Bolton Wanderers...

913
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:21,079
unfortunate not to have taken
all three points.

914
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:26,519
WENGER: Show me that you can go home
without losing a game.

915
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:32,919
I think it's a real definition
of humility.

A mammoth psychological boost.

918

A huge win at Highbury for Arsenal.

919
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:45,879
HENRY: Highbury,
in those hard moments gave us...

920
00:58:46,919 --> 00:58:47,799
everything.

921
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:49,919

WENGER: There is something special
about Highbury.

927
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:06,879
I still go back.

928
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,359
When you're half a mile away,
you still don't see the stadium.

929
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:16,159
INDISTINCT STREET CHATTER

930
00:59:17,879 --> 00:59:19,119
You look down...

931
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:22,479
you see already the fans
waiting for you.

FANS CHEER AND APPLAUD

935
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:39,639
Everything was small,
the corridors were small.

936
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:46,119
But all the ancestors had
their spirit in there.

937
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:47,239
Are you OK?

938
00:59:53,919 --> 00:59:55,839
When you took a corner at Highbury

939
00:59:55,919 --> 00:59:57,759
you could shake the hand
of the fans.

940
00:59:58,879 --> 01:00:00,879
You could speak
with the supporters.

941
01:00:03,759 --> 01:00:04,919
Or worse, you know.

942
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:08,599
After games

943
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:11,879
the fans knew we were in the dressing room
with the connection on the wall.

944
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:13,559
PLAYERS LAUGH

945
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,199
The players responded
by opening the window.

946
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,359
So I had Ian Wright
shouting with the fans

947
01:00:19,439 --> 01:00:21,559
<i>"I will see you when I come out,"
you know?</i>

948
01:00:28,399 --> 01:00:31,599
Sometimes I need to have
that feeling again, you know?

949
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:34,799
And I go up the road
and go down, like before.

950
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:39,719
It was real.

951
01:00:40,359 --> 01:00:42,919
And you cannot find that back

952
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:44,799
when you build a new stadium.

953
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:52,399
REPORTER: Arsenal are planning
to move out of historic Highbury

954
01:00:52,479 --> 01:00:54,119
REPORTER 2:
Arsenal spent years of planning

955
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:55,399
and millions of pounds

956
01:00:55,479 --> 01:00:57,639
on a plan to move
to a new stadium.

957
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:05,079
DEIN: We had to move.
There was no doubt about it.

958
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,719
We had a wait list of
about 50,000 people for tickets.

959
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:13,039
I could see ourselves left behind.

WENGER:
During that season

964
01:01:27,319 --> 01:01:29,799
Chelsea was, for a long period,
top of the league.

965
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:33,879
Abramovich came in...

966
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,119
and there was no financial fair play.

967
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:41,519
REPORTER: The biggest spending spree
in footballing history...

968
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,719
REPORTER 2:
76 million pounds' worth of talent

969
01:01:43,959 --> 01:01:46,359
to bring the Premiership title
to West London.

970
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:50,919
WENGER: It was the ideal moment
to buy football clubs

971
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,639
because you could do
what you wanted.

972
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:57,479
I told the players

973
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,879

983
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,479

BERGKAMP:
When you're at the top

987
01:02:39,279 --> 01:02:41,799
you wanna show the ones
who wanna take over

988
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,359
"Wait a minute,
it's not your turn yet

we're still here".

WENGER:
I have the addiction gene.

992
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:13,839
One negative side effect

993
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:17,799
is that you don't develop
some aspects of your personality

994
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:19,479
that you could have developed
in your life.

995
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:27,119
More sensitivity, more caring
about people.

996
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:32,559
That's where my daughter started
at school.

997
01:03:33,439 --> 01:03:34,719
And this school

998
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:39,119
has seen the Premier League trophy
and the FA Cup.

999
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:45,359
I feel guilty.

1000
01:03:46,999 --> 01:03:49,679
My passion created selfishness.

WENGER IN INTERVIEW:
Every night.

1002
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:56,119
Like I have my dinner,
I have my football game.

1003
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:02,399
Sometimes of course, on Sundays,
you have so many games that uh...

1004
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:05,439
in the end, you go to bed,
you don't know what you have seen anymore.

1005
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:10,439
My passion made me

1006
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:13,159
not to take care enough
of people around me.

1007
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:18,799
I would've loved
to have a bigger family.

1008
01:04:19,479 --> 01:04:22,239
And the fact that I was
so focused on football

1009
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:24,639
I'm today very grateful

1010
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:25,839
to have a daughter.

1011
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,919
Certainly,
my balance was too much in favour

1012
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:36,319
of the club and not enough
in favour of my family.

1013
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:42,439

Competition at all costs

1016
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,079
is something that destroys
a part of your personality.

1017
01:04:56,279 --> 01:04:58,599
This desire of hating to lose

1018
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,639
makes you sometimes
somebody inhuman.

1021
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:34,119

David Dein had an agreement
with Stan Kroenke

1226
01:19:06,119 --> 01:19:07,319
he wanted to bring in.

1227
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,919
I was torn between
being loyal to the club

1228
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:13,079
and being loyal to David.

1229
01:19:14,839 --> 01:19:16,199
He actually wanted to leave.

1230
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,999
And I said to him...

1231
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:21,599
"You have to stay, Arséne."

1232
01:19:25,879 --> 01:19:29,239
I still today wonder
if I did the right thing.

1233
01:19:30,879 --> 01:19:33,439
Because life was never
exactly the same after.

1234
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:37,079
<i>REPORTER:
Arséne, you have some news to tell us.</i>

1235
01:19:37,159 --> 01:19:39,959
I extended my contract
with Arsenal Football Club.

1236
01:19:40,919 --> 01:19:42,919
That is some good news
for you, I hope.

1237
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,639
It's good news for me.

1238
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,319
I thought, "I have now
to go to the end of this project."

1239
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:54,759
I could've gone
to the French national team

1240
01:19:54,839 --> 01:19:57,719
the English national team twice
or three times, even.

1241
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:00,399
I could've gone twice
to Real Madrid.

1242
01:20:00,799 --> 01:20:03,679
I could've gone to Juventus,
to Paris Saint Germain

1243
01:20:03,879 --> 01:20:04,999
even to Man United.

1244
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:06,999
Very good, very good, very good.

1245
01:20:07,799 --> 01:20:10,039
My fatal flaw is that...

1246
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:13,519
I love too much where I am.

1247
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:17,319
Where I was.

1248
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:25,719
HENRY:
It's gonna be difficult.

1249
01:20:25,999 --> 01:20:26,919
Man!

1250
01:20:27,519 --> 01:20:29,319
WENGER:
Once we moved into the stadium

1251
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:32,039
between one and two,
we moved to three and four.

1252
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:35,039
We lost our best players.

1253
01:20:35,839 --> 01:20:37,039
HENRY:
After Mr Dein left

1254
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,759
I needed to be certain
of where the club was going

1255
01:20:40,839 --> 01:20:44,039
and I wasn't,
and I've chosen to go.

1256
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,199
WENGER:
Before, we lost them at 30 plus.

1257
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:49,879
After, we lost them at 25 plus.

1258
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:52,239
HE EXHALES

1259
01:20:55,639 --> 01:20:57,999
To work with restricted resources

1260
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:01,239
and keep the club in a position
where we can pay our debts back.

1261
01:21:02,519 --> 01:21:05,279
From 2006 to 2015

1262
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:07,399
I personally think I did my best job.

1263
01:21:08,919 --> 01:21:11,239
KEOWN: There's lots of reasons,
financial reasons

1264
01:21:11,319 --> 01:21:13,359
board struggles,
the new stadium...

1265
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:16,319
but I think he almost
became a bit addicted

1266
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:18,239
to wanting to prove
he could win another Premier League.

1267
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:23,599
WENGER: To be stubborn
can be a strength and a weakness.

1268
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:25,919
FAN: Wenger won't change his tactics.
He won't change it, fam!

1269
01:21:25,999 --> 01:21:28,679
FAN 2: Not in a title race,
season after season.

1270
01:21:28,919 --> 01:21:30,759
If anything, we 're going backwards.

1271
01:21:30,839 --> 01:21:33,559
Without strong beliefs,
you do nothing in life

1272
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:36,759
because you change every day,
you go one day right and one day left.

CROWD CHEERS

1274
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:46,359
I am the right man
to lead this club further, and that's it.

1275
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:50,399
It's not about popularity

1276
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:53,039
it's about competence.

PLAYERS YELL

1278
01:21:55,879 --> 01:21:57,839
WRIGHT: I think one
of his worst statements was

1279
01:21:57,919 --> 01:21:59,639
"Fourth is like a trophy".

1280
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,079
KEOWN:
What we saw on the pitch changed.

1281
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:06,279
It became very technical,
almost too technical.

1282
01:22:07,519 --> 01:22:10,159
Yes, he could've gone
on many occasions, but he didn't.

1283
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,559
And Arsenal gave
a lot to him as well.

1284
01:22:18,839 --> 01:22:21,119
WRIGHT:
The game against Chelsea...

1285
01:22:21,759 --> 01:22:23,399
it was his 1000th game.

1286
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,079
CROWD CHEERS

1287
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:29,879
6-0 the final score in that game.

1288
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,919
The greatest manager
in Arsenal's history

1289
01:22:33,999 --> 01:22:35,879
and the players perform like that.

1290
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:37,719
PIERS MORGAN:
How many of this team

1291
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:40,879
<i>would get in The Invincibles or
either of Wenger's double-winning teams?</i>

1292
01:22:41,519 --> 01:22:42,599
Zero.

1293
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:44,999
There didn't seem to be
any accountability

1294
01:22:45,079 --> 01:22:46,559
for people who played poorly.

1295
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:49,399
They took his kindness for weakness.

1296
01:22:51,559 --> 01:22:55,239
HENRY:
The boss had that magnificent attribute

1297
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:57,519
of seeing the good always.

1298
01:22:57,919 --> 01:22:59,239
But at one point also

1299
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:01,919
you need to see what you have
and what's happening.

1300
01:23:02,999 --> 01:23:05,799

No new contract, no new contract.

<i>COMMENTATOR:
Arséne Wenger, he's not happy</i>

1303
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:13,599
he seems to be getting more and more
wound up at every decision.

1304
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:15,759
DIXON:
It was horrible.

1305
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:17,359
The fall from grace

1306
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:19,759
but it's his own making in the end.

1307
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:24,559
Arsenal had its hooks in Arséne

1308
01:23:24,879 --> 01:23:26,679
and he couldn't break free.

1309
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:30,119

Where's our money gone?

We want our Arsenal back.

BERGKAMP:
That must not have been a nice period

1312
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:39,119
but it's all down to doubt in his mind.

1313
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:44,159
Maybe it would've been easier
if he would've made a decision.

FAN:
The power, the money...

1315
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:50,119

1320

01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:07,639
Have I lost the quality

I don't know.

1323

But my dedication,
my desire to do well

1324
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:15,639
was exactly the same.

01:24:23,959 --> 01:24:26,239
Arsenal 20 consecutive years

1328
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:28,079

You know...

1333
01:24:37,799 --> 01:24:40,239
And yet, he was criticized.

1334
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:45,439
These supporters
maybe should be ashamed.

1335
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:51,119
I thought in the...
some movies in Hollywood

1336
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,439
where there's always a great ending

1337
01:24:53,559 --> 01:24:55,439

1338

01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:35,679
and hope to see you soon.

1395
01:28:35,839 --> 01:28:37,199
Well done. Bye-bye.

1396
01:28:37,519 --> 01:28:39,919
CROWD APPLAUDS AND CHEERS

1397
01:28:41,839 --> 01:28:44,399
FANS SING:
There's only one Arséne Wenger.

1398
01:28:44,839 --> 01:28:46,959
One Arséne Wenger.

1399
01:28:55,919 --> 01:28:57,039
WENGER:
I regret.

1400
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:02,199
I should have gone somewhere else.

1401
01:29:04,599 --> 01:29:07,439
I identified myself completely
with the club

1402
01:29:07,519 --> 01:29:11,159
and that was the mistake I made.

1403
01:29:13,559 --> 01:29:17,399
Now there is no special reason
for me to go there.

1404
01:29:19,799 --> 01:29:23,519
All the rest is purely emotion...

1405
01:29:25,479 --> 01:29:27,679
and that is less important.

1406
01:29:29,999 --> 01:29:32,159
CHILDREN CHATTER INDISTINCTLY

1407
01:29:33,839 --> 01:29:36,279

BYSTANDERS APPLAUD

1410
01:29:48,559 --> 01:29:50,319
WENGER:
My village, they are proud

1411
01:29:50,839 --> 01:29:53,279
that they produced a guy who was

1412
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:55,999
internationally-known
as a football man.

1413
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,159
INDISTINCT CHATTER IN FRENCH

1414
01:30:00,279 --> 01:30:03,959
They think, rightly so, certainly
that they contributed to that.

1415
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:14,359
If happiness is to love
the life that you lead

1416
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:17,119
I was very happy
because I wanted this life.

1417
01:30:25,559 --> 01:30:26,999
I became less religious

1418
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:30,359
but the importance
of spiritual values

1419
01:30:30,919 --> 01:30:32,319
was always present.

1420
01:30:35,919 --> 01:30:37,279
Even in a game

1421
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:39,279
something that unites people

1422
01:30:39,759 --> 01:30:41,119
is more than the ball.

1423
01:30:43,839 --> 01:30:46,119
They are guided by something
bigger than that.

1424
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,759
That makes them really be together.

1425
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:01,639
COMMENTATOR: Magic ball
from Bergkamp to Patrick Vieira!

1426
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:08,079
WENGER:
This team became invincible.

1427
01:31:08,879 --> 01:31:11,439
COMMENTATOR:
Fabulous shot! Wonderful goal!

1428
01:31:13,239 --> 01:31:14,879
WENGER:
They managed to achieve something

1429
01:31:14,959 --> 01:31:17,999
that they would not think possible.

1430
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,759
You can have as much talent
as you want to

1431
01:31:26,519 --> 01:31:29,399
but what will make
a project successful

1432
01:31:29,839 --> 01:31:31,119
is always gonna be the people.

1433
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:35,119
The one who put it together...

1434
01:31:36,359 --> 01:31:37,479
is Arsene.

1435
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:40,199
He was the father of our project.

1436
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:43,199
Invincible.

1437
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:45,399
FERGUSON:
I loved those games.

1438
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,519
Yeah, I loved those games
against Arsenal.

1439
01:31:47,759 --> 01:31:48,839
They were fantastic.

1440
01:31:57,319 --> 01:32:00,039
I think Arsene
and myself are dinosaurs.

1441
01:32:01,879 --> 01:32:03,359
We didn't do so badly.

CROWD CHEERS
- HORNS TOOT

1443
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,319
I won 13 leagues

1444
01:32:11,839 --> 01:32:15,319
but I was never near
going through a season undefeated.

1445
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:21,599
The achievement...

1446
01:32:22,119 --> 01:32:24,679
it stands aside.
It stands above everything else.

1447
01:32:24,959 --> 01:32:26,679
And it was Arsenal's.

1448
01:32:37,999 --> 01:32:40,119
WENGER:
I dream about football...

1449
01:32:42,919 --> 01:32:44,359
about what I have done.

1450
01:32:46,839 --> 01:32:49,519
Where did I do well?
Where did I not do well?

1451
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:55,879
I couldn't believe
that football can be a job.

1452
01:32:57,319 --> 01:32:59,319
That, for me,
was on a different planet.

1453
01:33:02,879 --> 01:33:05,119
My life, on that front,
is a miracle.

1455

Fear guides the restriction
of our ambition.

1456
01:33:14,959 --> 01:33:16,839
You have not to be scared.

1457
01:33:18,919 --> 01:33:20,519
Be audacious...

1458
01:33:21,519 --> 01:33:22,999
be ambitious.

1459
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:29,239
Your life can be wilder
than your wildest dream.
