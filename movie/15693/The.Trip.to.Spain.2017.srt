<i> Bueno. Provecho.</i>

155
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,572
- Thank you.
-<i> Gracias.</i>

156
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,507
- What did you say to him?
- I said it's charming.

157
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,310
Charming that his mother
made it, you know.
How about yours?

158
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,945
What's happening
in New York?

159
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,748
I've been seeing
a lot of Misha.
Remember Misha?

160
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,283
The girl you were seeing
with the legs?

161
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,118
Mm-hmm, yeah.

162
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,187
- Yeah.
- You seeing her again?

163
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,288
- Didn't she get --
- I..

164
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,389
I'm in love with her.

165
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,925
But she got married.

166
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:43,295
- She is married.
- Oh.

167
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,396
- Um, I know,
it's not ideal..
- Carry on.

168
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,464
- It's not ideal.
- Take your time.

169
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,065
- Give me details.
- It's not ideal.

170
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,936
But we.. She just..
We just bumped
into each other and, uh..

171
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,839
And, you know, we just,
you could tell
it was just there.

172
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,241
A smile, I gave her
one of my smiles
and, uh --

173
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,810
well, I mean, you don't
have to say anymore.

174
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,379
One of those smiles.

175
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,948
And then, like an anchovy,
she just..

176
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,051
...wriggled into
my net again.

177
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,486
- Was it exciting?
- It is exciting.

178
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,487
But it's not like
the first time.

179
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,721
It's not like
i don't know her.

180
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:10,755
It's like, it's like
we've rekindled

181
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:11,823
what we had before
and it's, uh --

182
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,426
- still exciting.
- Yeah, it is.

183
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,562
Actually you lose
excitement when you,
when you're married.

184
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,564
- I'll tell you that.
- Yeah. Well, you can't
have everything.

185
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,832
- The thing is
you can't have everything.
- No.

186
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,634
You can't have everything.
That's my mantra.

187
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,835
- You can't
have everything.
- Yeah.

188
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,704
When people complain,
"no, you know.."

189
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,405
- Well, alright,
make a choice.
- No..

190
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,573
I couldn't agree more,
couldn't agree more.

191
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,509
- I have a young family.
- Yeah?

192
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,344
For a man of my age,
my kids are young.

193
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,945
Yeah. Yeah.
How old's your wife?

194
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,314
Forty-three.
Mm-hmm.

195
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,616
She's just
got those kids in..

196
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,683
Just squeezed them
in quick then?

197
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,185
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

198
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,820
I'm not going
the full Mick Jagger
and having them at..

199
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,889
He's having another one
at 72.

200
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,957
Yeah, that's daft,
innit?

201
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,726
- Ever met him?
- I have.

202
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,528
- I was at a party.
- Yeah?

203
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,896
- I was leaving.
- Yeah.

204
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:54,099
- And I heard
from the, uh, balcony.
- Uh-huh.

205
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,300
"Rob, rob."

206
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,935
- Rob.
-<i> Rob.</i>

207
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,670
Here, rob, rob.

208
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,438
Oh, look, well,
he didn't, he didn't
do the full but..

209
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,173
And I looked up
and he went..

210
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,376
"Don't throw those
bloody Spears at me."

211
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,744
I said "what?"

212
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,679
He was, "don't throw
those bloody Spears at me."

213
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,481
Yeah. No, no.

214
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,949
- He was doing
Michael caine.
- I know, I know.

215
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,817
But what you find is
that he speaks like..

216
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,653
Sometimes it's sort of,
it's sort of like that

217
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,154
so that it's actually
quite posh.

218
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,823
And sometimes
he's quite sort of, uh..

219
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,825
You can see that
he's quite actually,
he's like that

220
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,428
a sort of public
school thing going on.

221
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,230
You know, and now you got
slightly deep like that.

222
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,300
But, um, but, uh,
and, uh, you know

223
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,634
you got the old
sort of, um..

224
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,703
Sort of peacock thing,
you know.

225
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,706
- Sorry, sorry.
- Sorry.

226
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,908
He went, "don't throw
those bloody Spears
at me."

227
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,710
And I went,
"oh, Michael caine."

228
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,312
So I looked up at him
and I said

229
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,981
"I've told you before
if you're not gonna sing

230
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,082
"i don't wanna
bloody know.

231
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,483
Now get back
in the other room."

232
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,018
And he went,
"aha-ha-ha."

233
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,753
And off he went.
He loved it.

234
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,190
But had I had a close
conversation with him

235
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,193
I would've said,
"what are you doing
having a child at 72?"

236
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,696
Yeah, you know what?
I mean, it's not ideal.

237
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,332
Look, Charlie chaplin
was knocking them out
in his 80s

238
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:01,700
and that's not ideal
either.

239
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,202
But we're -- we're
positively footloose

240
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,304
and -- and carefree
and -- and

241
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,673
we're like teenagers
compared with other guys.

242
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,041
We should enjoy
this moment in our lives.

243
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,843
We're at the sweet spot
in our lives.

244
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,345
- Hmm, hmm..
- We really are.

245
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,981
We're like ripe,
you know?

246
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,617
I am in my prime.
If I was miss Jean bro..

247
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,619
I should play
miss Jean Brodie.

248
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,922
There's a lot
of gender swapping
going on now in big roles.

249
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,223
I could play
miss Jean Brodie.

250
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,137
Oh!

251
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,109
- Thank you.
- Just look at this.

252
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,780
You writing anything
at the moment?

253
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,615
Of course, I am, yeah,
what I'm trying to do

254
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:54,119
with this odyssey
through Spain is do
what Laurie Lee did.

255
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,153
You don't know
this about me.

256
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,589
About 30 years ago,
when I was 18

257
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,491
I came to Spain
backpacking

258
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,293
after a levels, before
i went to university

259
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:06,564
and I met a woman
called Sofia who was 37.

260
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,366
And she'd basically
showed me the ropes.

261
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,801
I lost my virginity
to her.

262
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:10,902
How many years ago?

263
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,772
Well, that's
32 years ago.

264
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:16,941
- So she's now 70?
- Yeah, yeah.

265
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,143
- Sixty-nine, 70?
- She's 70, yeah.

266
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:21,012
- Should we look her up?
- No, I saw, I met her.

267
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,781
She's massive.
Saw her on a Vespa.

268
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,351
- Successful or massive?
- No, no, I mean fat.

269
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,521
I think the two of you
should give it another go.

270
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,524
Why don't we visit her,
take her some
turkish delight?

271
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,092
I think that's
the last thing she wants,
to be honest.

272
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,061
It's the one thing
i do know about her.

273
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,562
<i> Anyway,</i>
<i> I want to write a book</i>

274
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,932
<i> about Spain and me.</i>

275
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,701
Is that why you bought
the Laurie Lee book?

276
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,669
Yeah. Well, he wrote this
when he was early 50s.

277
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,171
But it was about
when he was 18.

278
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,439
So it's almost exactly
the same as me.

279
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,942
Cervantes wrote
"don quixote"
when he was 50.

280
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,877
50s in many ways,
i think --

281
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,212
no, we're at
the sweet spot
in our life.

282
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,549
The best age. It's -- it's
the sweet spot.

283
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,984
You've still got,
touch wood, time --

284
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,086
we're ripe,
we're a ripe fruit

285
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,987
but if you hang on
to the branch any longer

286
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,422
you're just gonna wither
on the vine --

287
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,691
- so what do you do then?
- Drop.

288
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,226
Or do you wanna be
plucked?

289
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,428
You wanna be plucked
actually.

290
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,731
I'd much rather be plucked
than drop.

291
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,200
But who's gonna pluck you
at this age?

292
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,901
You'd be surprised.

293
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,310
But after "philomena,"
this opened a whole new

294
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,278
sort of, uh,
chapter for me
in terms of, like

295
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
the -- the way
my career's gone.
All the, uh --

296
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,882
co-wrote that,
didn't you?

297
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,451
Yeah, yeah. Yeah -- yeah,
I've always,
I've always co-write.

298
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,653
I mean, I, you know,
i mean, really,
I'm kinda like

299
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,522
I'm the one who talks
and has all the ideas

300
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,556
and they,
the -- the other person's

301
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,825
kind of like
a sort of typist.

302
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,160
Will they view it
that way?

303
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,162
Oh, no, I would never say
that to them personally.

304
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,731
No, but, I mean,
but -- but privately..

305
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,734
These reviews
i write myself, of course.

306
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,002
Well, that's great.
I mean, how you
gonna do it?

307
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,238
We're in Spain,
I'm gonna do it like

308
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,406
Sancho panza
in "don quixote."

309
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,843
Two middle-aged men
looking for adventure.

310
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,446
- That's not a bad, um --
- "don quixote."

311
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,782
- Idealist, dreamer.
- Yeah.

312
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,717
- Head in the clouds. Yes?
- Yeah.

313
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,920
- And his solid,
dependable friend.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

314
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,595
So what are you
co-writing?

315
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:18,797
Uh, it -- it's
called "missing."

316
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,433
It's about a man looking
for his daughter and --

317
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:26,070
this'll be the follow-up
to your film about a woman
looking for her son.

318
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,772
Yeah, well, exactly,
it's the -- it's the --

319
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:30,341
it's the sister-piece
to that.

320
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,577
Um, and if I do
another one,
it'll be a trilogy.

321
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,346
But anyway, um, yeah,
it's about the,
the two of them --

322
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,115
you should be looking
for something else.

323
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:40,585
You know, the -- the,
to avoid
the comparisons maybe?

324
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,453
Man looking for his car.

325
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,089
But the thing is
you can -- you can do
a man who's lost his car.

326
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,558
There's -- there's
lots of, oh..

327
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,460
European filmmakers
use huge overbearing

328
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,030
you know,
huge thematic metaphors
all the time.

329
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,531
So it could be a guy
looking for his car.

330
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,500
But actually,
he doesn't realize..

331
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,035
He thinks he's looking
for his car, but actually

332
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,237
he's looking for something
much bigger than that.

333
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,105
A Van.

334
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,975
Yeah, well,
the Van of life.

335
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:07,111
- The Van of life.
- Well.

336
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,214
Can we, can we put this,
can we put this up?

337
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,755
We're going?

338
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,524
We're going.

339
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:20,959
Hey!

340
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,697
Thank you.

341
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,771
<i> Have you ever seen rain</i>
<i> like this?</i>

342
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:37,408
Oh, yeah,
i was in on a..

343
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,677
I got stuck
in a landslide overnight

344
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,514
uh, on the north,
on the West Side
of fulmer.

345
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,183
Stuck in a landslide,
i had to stay overnight

346
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,218
in the car
for eight hours.

347
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,753
I was fine,
i found out later

348
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,055
I was
in the wettest spot

349
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,425
in the country
ever recorded in history.

350
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,661
You've told me
this before.

351
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,563
<i> Well, you, you asked</i>
<i> and that was --</i>

352
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,531
<i> no, I asked you</i>

353
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,567
<i> have you ever seen</i>
<i> rain like this?</i>

354
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,768
<i> Obviously, if you ask</i>
<i> a question like that</i>

355
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,903
<i> you obviously</i>
<i> want some details.</i>

356
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,104
<i> If it's a story</i>
<i> that you've told before</i>

357
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,572
<i> you say, "yes,</i>
<i> do you remember</i>

358
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,740
<i> that time</i>
<i> in the landslide?"</i>

359
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,241
<i> And I say,</i>
<i> "oh, I remember."</i>

360
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,403
Do you know
who sang that?

361
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,973
Uh, lots of people.
Dusty Springfield?

362
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:19,811
Noel Harrison
is the famous one.
Son of..

363
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,379
George?

364
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,214
No. Rex Harrison.

365
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,349
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,650
God.

367
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,286
<i> Who sang</i>
<i> "the rain in Spain?"</i>

368
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,455
-<i> "The rain in Spain?"</i>
-<i> See.. So -- so again..</i>

369
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,790
- <i> Circles within circles.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

370
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,141
It's like we sailed
into Switzerland.

371
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,285
-<i> Hello.</i>
- Hello, hello, uh..

372
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,487
Uh, who's that?

373
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,355
It's Jonathan,
Matt's assistant.

374
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,457
This is Steve coogan
for Matt, please?

375
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,793
<i> Oh, hey, Steve.</i>
<i> Hey, yeah.</i>

<i> Um, look, I was just</i>

378
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,632
<i> Matt has left</i>

379
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,434
Uh, what?

380
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,469
Yeah, he's gone
to a management company.

381
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,538
<i> Look, it -- it -- it all</i>
<i> happened very quickly</i>

382
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,840
<i> and, um, well,</i>
<i> no one wanted it</i>

383
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,842
<i> to get out</i>
<i> before it was announced.</i>

384
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,611
Uh, it's gonna be
in the "trades" today.

385
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,914
<i> So I will be taking</i>

387
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,284
And, Steve, I just..

388
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,187
I wanna let you know

Uh, you know,

That's fine.

You're at,
you're still in New York.

414
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,893
I hear very good things
about the series.

415

00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,030
Uh, look, Greg,
did you know

418
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:29,734
that Matt
had left the us agency?

419
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,170
Yes, yes, I did, um,
yes, I did know that.

420
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,538
I was -- I was gonna
call you actually.

421
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,506
Did you know about this
before I did?

422
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,441
<i> No. No, not at all, no.</i>

423
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,277
Right. And do you know
that his assistant

424
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,546
Jonathan is taking over
his client list?

425
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,081
Yes. Now, you see,
Jonathan, I -- I think,
he's very good.

426
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,350
I think he's very bright.
So, you know..

427
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,520
Uh, what's happening
with Matt's other clients?

428
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,023
Uh, well,
i know that, uh

429
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,926
Ricky's,
Ricky's gone with him.

430
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,728
And, um, uh,
will ferrell.

431
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,764
Did he ask Ricky
to go with him?

432
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,232
<i> Yes. Yeah, he did.</i>

433
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,934
But he didn't ask me.

434
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,702
Yeah, but you see,
i think you --
you -- you're seen

435
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,071
more, more as a writer,
Steve.

436
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,140
I mean, so you wouldn't,
you wouldn't really
sort of need

437
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,642
a manager as well
as an agent, so..

438
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,010
So which clients
are staying

439
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,112
with the -- with the
new assistant?

440
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,981
Uh, Kevin kline.

441
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,885
I can't really see him
going anywhere else. Um..

442
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,421
Um, look.. Uh, Greg

443
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,555
would you do -- do me
a favor please?

444
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,692
Can you find out
w -- why the script

445
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:31,028
for "missing"
hasn't been green-lit yet?

446
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,964
Uh, that hasn't
happened. I mean,
that absolutely..

447
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,765
I know,
that should've happened.
I will get on to that.

448
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,334
I'll get on to that
straight away, that, yeah.

449
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,802

done to it?

534
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,457
Just getting out of bed
in the morning,
just pulled it.

535
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,992
You can't rush
out of bed.

536
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,760
You've gotta.. You know,
what I've been told to do?

537
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,929
Stretch while
lying down.

538
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,664
- Before you get
out the bed.
- Good to rotate it.

539
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,568
You look like
a tentative Nazi.

540
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:11,475
Uh, I think
what we're doing,
you know, is so wrong

541
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:14,278
on so many levels,
but that just can't stop.

542
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,881
Why are your Nazis
so camp?

543

Um, I mean,
the good news is
it's benign.

558
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:06,230
The bad news is we found
seven more of them.

559
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,833
Some of them have gone
into the lymph nodes.

560

Are you gonna read
that book

561
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,511
or you just brought it

No, I brought it

that the nearest scallop
is served to the guest.

586

Where I come from,
it is a custom

the largest scallop

to the guest.

00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:46,356
"to Santiago
de compostela

604
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,592
"where St. James
is supposed to be buried

605
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:51,995
"became the most
important destination
for christians

606
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,298
after Rome
and Jerusalem."

607
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,900
I met, I went to
the ultimate pilgrimage
to see the pope.

608
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,435
I went there
with "philomena"

609
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,204
and introduced
"philomena" to the pope.

610
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:02,973
And we welcome
"philomena" back
into the conversation.

611
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,408
It's been a good
five to six minutes

612
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,642
since he last
brought it up.

613
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,311
But, no, no, go on.
Always nice to hear.

614
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,613
- Well, I mean, you know..
-<i> So you were there for,</i>
<i> so what--</i>

615
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,048
I can't, I can't pretend
it's not been

616
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,449
a significant part
of my life,
but there you go.

617
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,184
Can't pretend
it's not been
a significant part

618
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,819
of this bloody journey.

619
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,743
This is nice, isn't it?

620
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,278
- Wonderful.
- Lovely.

621
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,015
You look like the man,
the man who'd follow
James Bond

622
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:48,418
at a distance
in, uh, one
of the Sean Connery films.

623
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,887
- One of the early films.
- But would never say
anything.

624
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:52,089
- Yeah. Yes.
- Never speak.
You're mysterious.

625
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,559
- Sinister figure.
- Sinister figure
following him. Yeah.

626
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:59,129
Sos del Rey catolico.
Now what does that mean?

627
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,499
Uh, del Rey is the reign,
uh, catholic reign.

628
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,002
So it's the sos
of the catholic king.

629
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:08,539
Um, because that's where
king ferdinand
was born here.

630
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:09,807
- Right here?
- Right here.

631
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,642
Well, not here, but
you know, around there.

632
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,310
He -- he introduced
the Spanish inquisition?

633
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,711
- Yes, indeed.
- Are you sure about that?

634
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,780
He was a catalytic
converter in a way.

635
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:19,016
<i> - Very good.</i>
<i> You're on fire.</i>
- Cheers.

636
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:25,155
You'd actually make
a very good inquisitor

637
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,824
I think, for
the Spanish inquisition.

638
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,193
<i> Don't take this</i>
<i> the wrong way. You have</i>
<i> an inquisitive nature--</i>

639
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,661
mind,
an inquisitive mind, yeah.

640
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,130
And you have a cruel side.
You do have
a cruel side.

641
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,865
Well, it's not -- it's
only a short leap,
isn't it

642
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:37,901
from -- from curiosity
to, uh

643
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,636
murderous intent?

644
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,139
I mean, ah,
it's quite a large leap.

645
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,974
<i> - It's a very large leap.</i>
- It's a big leap.

646
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,343
If I was questioning you
and you're on the rack

647
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,346
I'd start with some
simple questions like..

648
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,448
I'd just say, okay,
just warm meself up.

649
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,883
Like just give me
your name, address

650
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:53,917
tell me what you had
for breakfast?

651
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,219
- Rob brydon.
- Yeah.

652
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,320
<i> - London.</i>
- Yeah?

653
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:57,654
And what did you have
for breakfast?

654
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,756
- Scrambled eggs.
- Lovely stuff, okay.

655
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,358
- Uh, rob --
- is that it?
Can I go now?

656
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,693
No, no, no.
I'm gonna ask you
a few more questions.

657
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,061
Just, uh,
just take it easy.

658
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:05,696
- Um..
- Oh, I can't,
it's really hurting--

659
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:08,966
uh, what is your favorite
kind of music?

660
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,335
- Bruce Springsteen.
- Okay, alright, okay.

661
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,337
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

662
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,073
Um, how many baftas
have you won?

663
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:17,574
- What?
- How many baftas
have you won?

664
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,209
I can't hear you. Ah.

665
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,478
Okay, okay,
just give it
another notch --

666
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,413
- aah! I got a welsh one.
- How many baftas..

667
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,983
Oh, well, one welsh bafta.
Thank you.

668
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,551
You see,
how easy that was?

669
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,254
Do you see how easy it was
to answer the question?

670
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,889
Okay. Now.

671
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,657
I've been nominated
seven times
for the normal ones.

672
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,858
That, I didn't
ask you that.

673
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,094
- Notch,
give another notch.
- Aah!

674
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,829
- Well, how tall is he?
- Uh..

675
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:42,065
- 5 -- 5'8" and a half.
- Oh. Ooh, really?

676
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,500
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ooh. Ooh.

677
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,903
It's not bad, eh?
Okay.

678
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:48,472
Now one more question
that you won't
want to answer

679
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,506
'cause I'm trying
to get you up to 5'9".

680
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:52,109
I'm on your side here.
Okay?

681
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,844
Do you wanna, do you wanna
quit at 5'8"?

682
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:55,946
- No.
- 5'8" and a half or do
you wanna go for the 5'9"?

683
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,981
- 5'9".
- He is gonna go
for the 5 foot 9.

684
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,816
Okay, one more question.

685
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,385
- Rob?
- Yeah.

686
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:05,555
Do you believe
in the lord god almighty?

687
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,090
I'd rather not say.

688
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,659
- Aah!
- Give it another
couple of notches.

689
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,093
And we have 5'9".

690
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,495
- Ah, thanks!
<i> - Rob brydon, let him go.</i>

691
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:15,098
You leave here
as a 5'9" man.
Congratulations.

692
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,234
Thank you, Steve.
Ooh, I've hit my head.

693
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,402
<i> There you go,</i>
<i> that's gonna be a problem</i>

694
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:19,803
you're gonna have to
contend with now.

695
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,038
You just have to let
your trousers down too.

696
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,273
Ladies and gentlemen,
rob brydon.

697
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,624
<i> This is the area</i>
<i> that Terry Gilliam</i>
<i> was in</i>

698
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,326
<i> when he was trying to do</i>
<i> "don quixote."</i>

699
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,995
"Lost in la mancha"
is the documentary

700
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,329
about his failure
to do so.

701
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,531
And it's a show
i would like to do.

702
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,100
-<i> "Man of la mancha."</i>
- "Lost in la mancha?"

703
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:25,535
<i> Or "man of la mancha"</i>
<i> is the -- the</i>
<i> stage musical.</i>

704
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,071
It might be my next
theatrical venture.

705
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,406
- Really?
<i> - Yes.</i>

706
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,675
You get to sing
"the impossible dream."

707
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,780
<i> Given that</i>
<i> this is rioja</i>

<i> see a lot more vines.</i>

709
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,351
It's of no interest
to me these days, rob

710
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,521
because I no longer
drink alcohol.

711
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,024
I like wine.
I like rioja.

712
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,963
What's with all
the dinosaur signs?

713
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,564
I suppose there's
lots of dinosaurs

714
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,933
that used to
live around here.

715
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,502
I say we visit

716
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,937
'cause Chloe loves
dinosaurs.

717
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,407
- <i> Who's Chloe?</i>
<i>- My daughter.</i>

718
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,674
Oh.

719
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,079
I'm gonna
put my boots on.

720
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,815
-<i> Putting your boots on?</i>
- Yeah, dusty.

721
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,716
We're only going there.

722
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,390
Love these boots.

723
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:54,791
Those, yeah, no,
they're -- they're good

724
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,793
uh, intermediate
walking shoes those.

725
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,595
But, uh,
you couldn't attach

726
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,797
crampons
if there was any ice.

727
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,400
Well, I don't plan
to go on any ice.

728
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:06,303
No one plans for ice, rob,
you've gotta
be prepared --

729
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:07,871
hey!

730
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:10,740
You see? That's not,
not very good
for scree work either.

731
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,645
You just gotta be decisive
about where
you put your feet

732
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,013
that's all.

733
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:23,353
Do a picture of me

734
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,855
with the dinosaur.

735
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,995
Which one's
the dinosaur?

736
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:37,234
<i> Okay, uh, seeing as</i>
<i> the dinosaur's doing</i>

737
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:41,638
a McCartney-style thumbs up,
then why don't
you mimic that.

738
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,975
Hey. Rock and roll.

739
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:49,246
I mean, Ringo,
he was actually
a good drummer, you know?

740
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,148
What's that --
what's that
dinosaur called?

741
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,317
- Barney.
- No, it's a t-Rex.

742
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,487
It's actually not,
it's a iguanodon.

743
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,855
How do you know?

744
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,390
Throw the phone?

745
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:03,360
Because, um,
Chloe is an expert.

746
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:04,461
Well, tell me this

747
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:05,896
why, uh,
they changed the name

748
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:08,532
of a brontosaurus
to a brachiosaurus.

749
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,000
<i> No one's given me an --</i>

750
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,870
the brontosaurus
which would previously
roam the lands --

751
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,805
-<i> who's that?</i>
- It's John hurt.

752
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,741
- That's not John hurt.
- Who is it then?

753
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:20,277
<i> Well, I don't know, but</i>
<i> if you're gonna do</i>
<i> John hurt, you have to, um..</i>

754
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:25,215
The brach..
The brachiosaurus
would once roam the land.

755
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,884
The king of all
he surveyed.

756
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,186
That's a very good
John hurt.

757
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,189
King of all he surveyed.

758
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:35,458
It's a combination
of him as..

759
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,629
...quentin crisp and
caligula in "i, claudius."

760
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,231
<i> - Why are you standing --</i>
- you can go away
now, rob.

761
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:44,534
I was thinking of
killing you,
but I've changed my mind.

762
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,905
<i> So does Chloe, uh,</i>
<i> know about the different</i>

763
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,174
uh, prehistoric periods?

764
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,676
Yep.

765
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,477
Not, you know, she..

766
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,147
- Does she know triassic?
- Like she can sit
an exam but --

767
00:36:57,149 --> 00:37:00,450
Jurassic? Cretaceous?

768
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,352
She knows some of those.
She knows the words.

769
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,688
I'm not gonna pretend
that she could

770
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,756
take a, give a lecture.

771
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,392
Of course in the..

772
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,328
In the triassic period,
there's only

773
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,097
the -- the world was
one land mass

774
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,799
just with the sea,
and that was it.

775
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:18,969
One -- one body of land
and then
in the Jurassic period

776
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:21,204
split into two big lumps
of land.

777
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,742
And then the, finally
the cretaceous,
it broke up

778
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,744
into the continents
that we know today.

779
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,085
Look at that.

780
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,786
They're
the actual footprints.

781
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,521
Quite big, aren't they?

782
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,657
What size are your feet?

783
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:41,891
Seven.

784
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,761
- Really?
- Yeah.

785
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,897
Go on then, off you go.

786
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,499
No, it's just that,
that is quite --

787
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,001
- they're too small.
- Quite feminine.

788
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,636
They are feminine,
i know.

789
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,537
- I'm not gonna --
- small feet.

790
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,873
Nice on a woman,
a bit weird on a bloke.

791
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,209
- Indeed.
- Yeah.

792
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,878
If I could change
one thing about me

793
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,580
well, it wouldn't be
the feet, but I would

794
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:05,515
I would, I would
get to the feet
quite soon.

795
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,017
It'd be feet,
height and hair,
wouldn't it?

796
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:10,020
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

797
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,303
- Ah!
- Oh!

798

Mm. Mm!

806
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,632
Terrible year
in many ways.

807
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:58,435
If you think about
the number of the people

00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,937
- I mean, gifted people.
- Yeah.

David bowie's death
was like..

810
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,008
What did Tony visconti
say?

811
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,110
"It was a -- it was
an artistic act,
his death."

812
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,912
Yeah. Well, it was --
it was remarkable.

813
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,780
No funeral.
He literally
just went poof.

814
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,882
Had a song called
"Lazarus" on his --
on his last record.

815
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,051
Yeah, it was wonderful.
It was actually brilliant.

816
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,653
Yeah, it was.
It was admirable.

817
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,421
I told you about the time
he was on the radio

818
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:22,392
and, uh, he wanted
to mention me but couldn't
remember my name.

819
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,861
- Really?
- Mm.

820
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,929
He was being interviewed

821
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,164
and, uh,
the interviewer said

822
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:31,034
"wha -- what'd you do
when you're, um..

823
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,103
...on tour on the bus?"

824
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:35,605
And he said he watched
"cruise of the gods,"
that we did.

825
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,875
And he said,
"you know the one,
it stars that guy."

826
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,543
- Really?
- And he said, "who?"
Yeah, he said, "who?"

827
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,313
And I was in the kitchen,
like, "oh, my god!"

828
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:44,581
"He's about to mention me.
David bowie."

829
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,116
- Sure he didn't mean me?
- No, no, no.

830
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:48,852
Because he said,
"you know, the one
from "Marion and Geoff.""

831
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:51,354
- Really? He said
"Marion and Geoff?"
- Yes, yes.

832
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:53,256
Yeah, and
i -- I was going,
"it's me, it's me."

833
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:54,491
And the interviewer
was going

834
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:57,093
"no, I -- I don't know,
i don't know."

835
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,628
So he never said my name

836
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,931
but he was thinking
of my face at that moment.

837
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,135
And when he died,
i looked at his
Twitter feed

838
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:06,302
and you know
what, Steve?

839
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:10,306
- He followed me
on Twitter.
- Really?

840
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,342
You don't know what to do
with that information,
do you?

841
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:14,144
Well,
no disrespect to you

842
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:17,113
but he's just ever,
ever so slightly

843
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,883
I mean,
microscopically
diminished

844
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,618
in my mind.

845
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,120
Just think and I know
you won't like this.

846
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,189
There would've been a time
when he sat there

847
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,658
with his phone
and went..

848
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,255
And he would've pressed
on that button and clicked

849
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:02,358
and followed me
and seen every tweet.

850
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,379
Hm.

851
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,249
<i> Now as you know,</i>
<i> this was a moors castle.</i>

852
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:28,485
And when it was conquered
by the Christian

853
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,787
it became the --
the official residence

854
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,489
of the siguenzas bishop.

855
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,724
- Please, after you.
- Thank you.

856
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,459
You're welcome.

857
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:39,295
And during the civil war,
the town was bombarded

858
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,764
by the condor legion

859
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,666
and the castle was hit.

860
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:47,136
- Like como en guernica?
- Yeah, like guernica.

861
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,606
Um, the last resistance
of the town

862
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:51,574
took place
in the cathedral

863
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,009
and it was
bombarded too.

864
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,511
And they surrender
because

865
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,980
they didn't have
any more ammunition or --

866
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,548
yes, of course, wow.

867
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,016
The final attack.

868
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,620
Over there, we have, uh

869
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:07,490
a room that was a setting
for a Marlon Brando's
movie

870
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:10,026
in the early '90s.

871
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,062
He played the role of,
uh, friar torquemada.

872
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,864
He was
the grand inquisitor of --

873
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,699
of course,
the Spanish inquisition.

874
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,769

902
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,364
Look at
the little fella down..
There, hello.

903
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:24,434
<i> He's new, he's hot,</i>
<i> he's up-and-coming.</i>

904
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:28,371
Which, uh, do you..
I've got -- I've got
two Oscar nominations.

905
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:31,007
I'm -- I'm -- I'm new
and I'm not up-and-coming.

906
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:33,176
I've -- I've arrived.

907
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,416
Ah..

908
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:42,619
Good evening.

909
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:45,855
- Good evening.
<i> - Buenos tardes.</i>

910
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,091
Isn't it
a magnificent room?

911
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,892
It's the Brando room.

912
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,929
I just watched
a little clip
on YouTube of him.

913
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:56,966
But you can't really
work out exactly where
they are.

914
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,535
He's very overweight
at that stage.

915
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:02,672
Yeah, which is fine
for, uh, torquemada.

916
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,041
Gives him presence.

917
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,410
I was playing torquemada

918
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:10,079
in the Spanish
inquisition.

919
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:13,383
Nobody expects
Spanish inquisition.

920
00:44:13,385 --> 00:44:14,417
Nobody does.

921
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:16,052
Amongst all weaponry

922
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,487
are such diverse
elements

923
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,656
as fear, surprise,
a ruthless efficiency

924
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:21,991
and an almost
fanatical devotion
to the pope

925
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,127
and that's
with uniforms.

926
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:27,597
Nobody expects
a Spanish inquisition.

927
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,400
Amongst all weaponry
and fear

928
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:33,736
surprise,
a ruthless efficiency

929
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:36,606
and an almost
fanatical devotion --

930
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,675
- you're doing him
in "the godfather."
- What?

931
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:41,144
- You're just doing --
-<i> I was doing</i>
<i> '70s Brando.</i>

932
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:43,479
Well, he spoke like this,
kinda nasal.

933
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,816
You know what, his voice
was a little higher
the way he spoke.

934
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:49,452
It was, you know

935
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,220
it was like that,
you know --

936
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:53,723
you've got a de niro
thing going. You're doing
your de niro.

937
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:56,592
If I, if I was doing
de niro, I'd do it
like that, you know?

938
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,529
That's the way,
that's the way
de niro spoke, you know?

939
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,364
Let's do something
about that, you know.

940
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,465
That's right, you know
what I'm gonna do?

941
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:03,566
I'm gonna rip
your head off, shit down

942
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:04,801
your goddamn
fuckin' neck

943
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:06,936
you two-bit dick suckin'
motherfuckin' asshole.

944
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,805
- That's terrific.
That's terrific.
<i> - Yeah.</i>

945
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:11,007
The reason you think
I'm doing de niro
when I'm doing Brando

946
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:14,010
is because de niro
himself was influenced
by Brando.

947
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:16,646
So, when de niro acts

948
00:45:16,648 --> 00:45:20,850
you see a residual
element of Brando
in what he does.

949
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:21,951
So, you've got
it the wrong way round.

950
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:24,420
So in attempting
to criticize you

951
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,988
I've inadvertently
complimented you.

952
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,857
You've shown up some
of the detail in Brando --

953
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:31,461
you certainly came out
on top in this exchange
then.

954
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:34,530
I am only telling you
the truth.

955
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,467
Nobody expects
a Spanish inquisition

956
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:40,269
and nobody expects
a comfy chair.

957
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,538
No, he's gotta do the,
get..

958
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,676
...the comfy chair.

959
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:49,879
Get the comfy chair.

960
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,317
I'm like a turtle,
look at me.

961
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,720
Get the comfy chair.

962
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:00,690
Get the comfy chair
and a piece of lettuce.

963
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:02,158
<i> I'm gettin' hungry.</i>

964
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,761
Amongst our weaponry
is..

965
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,063
Such diverse elements
the..

966
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,564
- Woody Allen. Yeah.
- I know, Woody Allen.

967
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,733
Amongst our weaponry

968
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:14,871
is such diverse elements
as fear.

969
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:19,375
Uh, surprise, an --
an almost
fanatical devotion

970
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:20,943
to the Yankees.

971
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:22,879
Ehh.

972
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,827
Do you wish to confess?

973
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,663
No.

974
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,068
You know all Jews
were told
to leave the country

975
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,771
by order of the
catholic king and queen.

976
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:52,175
Yes, but, mm,
I'm not a Jew.

977
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:55,745
My lord, I'm --
I'm a catholic,
Roman catholic, sir.

978
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:59,182
If you're catholic,
then you must respect
my authority.

979
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:01,017
My authority
comes from the pope.

980
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,219
I've met the pope.

981
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,620
My lord, I met the pope.

982
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:07,690
I met his holiness
at the Vatican

983
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:10,660
and he saw
a film I made.

984
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,628
- You're lying.
-<i> I'm telling the truth,</i>
<i> my lord.</i>

985
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,330
<i> I -- I, he didn't,</i>
<i> he didn't see the film</i>

986
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:18,034
but his advisers did,
and they gave him
a breakdown of the film

987
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:20,236
and he approved it.

988
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:22,471
You're a,
you're a heretic.

989
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:25,608
My lord, I am not
a heretic, I am not Jewish,
i am not Muslim.

990
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,510
I am a Roman catholic,
i -- I promise you.

991
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,545
I don't know "the quran,"
i hardly know
the old testament.

992
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,081
<i> I, I was an altar boy,</i>
<i> um --</i>

993
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,683
shh.

994
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,453
Do you respect
my authority?

995
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:43,326
- Well, uh..
- Do you respect my authority?

996
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:46,095
<i> - Why -- why are</i>
<i> you mumbling?</i>
<i> -</i> I'm what?

997
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,264
What did you say?

998
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:50,833
<i> You're not enunciating,</i>
<i> anuncio.</i>

999
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:53,135
I'm sorry, Esteban.

1000
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:56,105
Do you respect
my authority?

1001
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,276
Yes, I, yes,
i respect
your authority.

1002
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:02,445
Take him away.

1003
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:03,713
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

1004
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,348
What's going to
happen now?

1005
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,516
I'm not.. I've not done
anything. I haven't..

1006
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:09,418
Why, why are they
taking me backwards?

1007
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,820
I have not
done anything.

1008
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:12,955
I'm, I'm catholic.

1009
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,100
Hey, guess where
I'm taking Joe

1010
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,402
uh, at the end
of this week?

1011
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,206
There, look.

1012
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:33,109
- <i> Zip wire.</i>
<i>- Yeah, longest one</i>
<i> in Spain.</i>

1013
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:34,277
- <i> Have you done this</i>
<i> already?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

1014
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,445
<i> I've done about five</i>
<i> in the uk</i>

1015
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,514
<i> couple in Europe.</i>

1016
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:41,317
Word of warning.
What's the age limit
on this?

1017
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:42,985
There's no age limit.
As long as you're fit.

1018
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,187
Uh, there's
a height restriction.

1019
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:47,256
Well, we were in Italy
last year

1020
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,058
and there was
whitewater rafting.

1021
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,326
Yeah.

1022
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:52,895
So I thought
I'd check out

1023
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,463
you know, the age.

1024
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:59,135
Eight to fifty-five.

1025
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,970
- So by the time Charlie's
old enough to do it--
- what?

1026
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:02,605
- That's ridiculous.
- I'll be too old.

1027
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,407
- I know.
-<i> Fifty-five?</i>

1028
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:07,843
-<i> That's ridiculous.</i>
- Why can you not
whitewater raft at 55?

1029
00:49:07,845 --> 00:49:10,179
I might get some fake ID
or something like that.

1030
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,715
Yeah, you'll have to get
a fake ID like a teenager.

1031
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:16,118
Uh, John Jones,
born in 1970.

1032
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,054
I'm -- I'm a carpenter
from wrexham.

1033
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:19,922
- You say
you're a carpenter?
- That's right.

1034
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:21,991
Simple question.

1035
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:25,127
You're building
a bog standard

1036
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,097
uh, tongue and groove,
glue and peg

1037
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,498
wooden bench
for outside.

1038
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,033
What kind of wood
do you choose

1039
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:33,836
if you want it
to weather into
a nice silvery patina?

1040
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:36,105
Ash, beech, teak?

1041
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,709
Simple question.

1042
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:40,843
Better hurry,
there's other people

1043
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:42,979
who wanna get on
this whitewater raft.

1044
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:46,315
Um, could you
tell me the woods again?

1045
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,817
Ash, teak, beech.

1046
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,385
- Ash, teak, beech?
- Hm.

1047
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,655
Beech?

1048
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,523
Na, mate.
It's teak.

1049
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:57,226
Any carpenter
worth his salt
will tell you that.

1050
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:58,728
- Don't cry, Charlie.
- You're not..

1051
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,396
- You're not
a carpenter, mate.
- Please, let us go on.

1052
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:01,731
It's the only chance
I've got to --

1053
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:04,100
on your way.

1054
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:06,002
Don't cry, Charlie,
don't cry.

1055
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:07,770
Maybe mommy
can take you.

1056
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:09,205
Look at the boy,
he's crying.

1057
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,873
Oh, how old,
how old are ya?

1058
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,541
- What?
- How old are you?

1059
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,343
I'm 56.

1060
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,545
Oh, for Christ's sake,
go on, on you.. Get on.

1061
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:18,280
Thanks a lot. Oh!

1062
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:20,082
Oh, I got shooting pains
down my arm.

1063
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:23,152
Don't tell me that.
I've just broken the rules
for you, nob.

1064
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:26,155
Give me a minute.
I've gone light-headed.

1065
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:27,490
Alright, thank you.

1066
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:29,992
Come on, Charlie.
Not so fast, son.

1067
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:35,398
Oh, you know, um,
walking downhill

1068
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,233
very good
if you engage your abs.

1069
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,434
Yeah, of course.

1070
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:41,203
Um, and, if you engage
your abdominals

1071
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,873
it takes the pressure off
your knees.

1072
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,341
Who told you that?

1073
00:50:45,343 --> 00:50:47,877
It's just, you can feel it
anatomically.

1074
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,178
I figured it out.

1075
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,746
Hardly stand up
to a focus group,
would it?

1076
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,248
Well, you wouldn't show it
to a focus group --

1077
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,116
clinical trials.
It wouldn't stand up
to clinical trials.

1078
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:55,451
Exactly. Wouldn't show it
to a focus --

1079
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,286
clinical trial, that's why
i said clinical trials.

1080
00:50:57,288 --> 00:50:59,355
Okay, yeah. You don't
need clinical trial.
It's just..

1081
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:01,524
If you, if you listen
to your body,
you can figure it out.

1082
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:03,159
It's just like
a shock absorber,
so the knee

1083
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,261
doesn't have to take
all the -- all the impact.

1084
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,197
Wow.

1085
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:12,935
Big.

1086
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,537
Bigger than it looks
from outside.

1087
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:16,705
Hey, take your hats off
in church.

1088
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,376
Frowned upon.

1089
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,513
I'm trying to find out
where the bomb damage is.

1090
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:26,615
From, uh, you know..

1091
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,617
...from when Franco
and the Nazis..

1092
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,487
Exhibition there
with cervantes
and Shakespeare.

1093
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:32,988
There, look!

1094
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,990
Why would they have
the two of them
in one exhibition?

1095
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:37,526
They both died
in the same year.

1096
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:40,262
It seems they've done
a very good repair job.

1097
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,864
I can't see any damage.

1098
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:45,434
Or maybe it wasn't
this part of it
that got damaged.

1099
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,737
The -- the workmanship
of this is a,
is a testament to

1100
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:51,407
to all the workers
who helped construct it

1101
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:53,209
and yet Franco,
very happy

1102
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,644
despite claiming to be
a catholic to bomb

1103
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,080
the shit out
of a religious building

1104
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:02,184
which just shows you
what kind of a vandal
he was.

1105
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:04,887
We're having flooring
just like this
in the kitchen.

1106
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,059
- Partner's there.
- Yeah.

1107
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:13,062
Buried, lying next
to each other..

1108
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:14,563
...for eternity.

1109
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:33,349
"First collected edition
of Shakespeare's works.
1623."

1110
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:36,519
So in the '60s, seven
years after he's dead

1111
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:38,554
already they realized
what they'd lost.

1112
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,394
Rob. Rob!

1113
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:47,696
"Electronic '80s
album cover."

1114
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,199
Very good.

1115
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,236
I'm holding my stomach in
while I do this.

1116
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:57,640
Just walking downhill
is actually better
for that, you know?

1117
00:52:57,642 --> 00:53:00,876
Yeah, but I,
i hold it in pretty much
all the time now.

1118
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,288
Would you ever do
Shakespeare on the stage?

1119
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,357
I would have liked to have
played "Hamlet."

1120
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,128
That train has left
the station.

1121
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,196
Who would you like
to play now?

1122
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,730
Olivier played him
when he was 42.

1123
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,200
Olivier was a better actor
than you.

1124
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,935
- Well, a different actor.
- A better actor.

1125
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:28,070
A different actor.

1126
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:30,606
-<i> "King lear?"</i>
- He's an old man.

1127
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,041
He's not that old.
He's a father.

1128
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,209
You've got more
in common with him

1129
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:35,244
than you have
with a teenager.

1130
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,387
Have you lost something?

1131
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,956
She is gone forever.

1132
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,894
I know when one is living
and one is dead.

1133
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,431
And she's dead as earth.

1134
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,635
Lend me
a looking glass..

1135
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,705
...that if her breath..

1136
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,607
...a mist of stain
the stone..

1137
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,510
...why then she lives.

1138
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,946
Very good.

1139
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,648
Very good.
"Midsomer murders."

1140
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,650
<i> You're a, you're a father</i>
<i> who's just been told</i>

1141
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:16,452
his daughter's been killed
in a road accident

1142
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:17,586
and that is effective

1143
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,822
and we're straight into
the adverts after that.

1144
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:24,460
I have of late though
wherefore I know not

1145
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:26,996
lost all my mirth,
forgone all custom
of exercise

1146
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:29,798
and indeed it goes
so heavily
my disposition

1147
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,767
that this goodly frame
the earth, look you

1148
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:35,037
this fine o'er hanging
firmament the sky

1149
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:38,374
it seems nothing to me,
but a foul congregation
of vapors.

1150
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,175
Aa-ha-ha.

1151
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:42,511
"Jumpin' Jack flash."

1152
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:46,915
Stones do Shakespeare,
come on.

1153
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:51,287
Oh, oh, that is too,
too solid flesh

1154
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:55,424
would melt and resolve
itself into a Jew.

1155
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:58,694
All that the everlasting
not fixed his canon

1156
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,729
against self-slaughter.

1157
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,533
Has Russell brand
ever done Shakespeare?

1158
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,903
- Oh, god, god.
- Mick Jagger.
You're doing Mick Jagger.

1159
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,905
- You're doing Mick Jagger.
-<i> Well, I, uh..</i>

1160
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,073
What a, um,
what you saying? Aah.

1161
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:12,374
<i> Ha, what's that?</i>

1162
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:14,410
- Alright then. Huh.
- Huh. Huh.

1163
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:16,278
That's not Mick Jagger.
That's a lot
of noises.

1164
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,280
Ah, Steve, how you doing?
You alright?

1165
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,482
What it's no, if you..
Quiet, quiet,
let me do it.

1166
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,318
No, no, you,
you can't do.

1167
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,986
You're copying morrissey,
and it isn't like that.

1168
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,721
That's all gay.
He goes like that.

1169
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:27,256
What piece of work,
he's a man.

1170
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:28,924
He goes really
deep sometimes

1171
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:30,426
and you can't
get down there.

1172
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:31,827
You can only
go up there.

1173
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,829
You need to go up and down
to do him properly.

1174
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,798
You saying
i can't get down there?

1175
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,533
You're seriously saying
i can't get down there?

1176
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:39,635
No, that's not.. I was just
saying that you're
a bad Mick Jagger.

1177
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,187
- <i> Gracias.</i>
<i>- Muchas gracias.</i>

1178
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:00,989
-<i> Si, si.</i> I like wine.
- Nice vino, yeah.

1179
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,561
<i> Muchas gracias.</i>

1180
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:12,000
So George orwell came
over to Spain in 1936.

1181
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:13,769
- Oh.
- Joined --

1182
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:16,004
one year
after the birth of Elvis.

1183
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:18,340
He come out to Barcelona
with his wife.

1184
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:19,475
- With his wife.
- She stayed there --

1185
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:21,143
mini break.

1186
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:23,912
- She stayed there --
- it's a good place
for a mini break.

1187
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,948
Is that
what they were doing?

1188
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,950
Were they able to do that
in those days?

1189
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:29,752
Do you wanna learn
anythin' about civil war
at all

1190
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:31,353
or you just think it's,
like, or you just think

1191
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:33,155
"i don't know,
i don't really give a damn
about the civil war.

1192
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:34,556
I'm not
that interested in it."

1193
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,158
I want to learn
something about civil war.

1194
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,595
Okay. So he came out
to Barcelona,
left his wife there

1195
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:42,131
went off to the front
to fight, 50 miles away.

1196
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:44,233
And when he came back,
he was so disillusioned

1197
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:47,469
with the intellectuals who
were back in Barcelona.

1198
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:49,171
When he went back there,
he saw them all.

1199
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:52,207
Uh, they'd become
bourgeois, they'd lost
sight of their ideals

1200
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,842
though he said they were
eating fancy food

1201
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,277
in posh restaurants.

1202
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:57,045
So he went back
to the front
one more time.

1203
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,114
Eventually he got shot
in the throat.

1204
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,283
Couldn't speak
for six months.

1205
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:03,519
Where's your bullet
to the throat
when you need one?

1206
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,790
I don't think if I were
to say to Sally..

1207
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,226
...i was going
off to fight,
she wouldn't stand there

1208
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,962
and just say alright,
you know, you're going off
to be killed.

1209
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:15,531
Yeah, or kill.

1210
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:16,899
That's a very good point

1211
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,434
'cause that's something
else I couldn't do.

1212
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,135
I wouldn't fight a war
because I got kids.

1213
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:21,503
- I got kids.
- Yeah.

1214
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:23,972
But if I didn't have kids,
i think I would be --

1215
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:25,607
- I don't think you would.
- I think I would.

1216
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,608
I think you'd like
to think you would

1217
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,643
but I don't think
you would.

1218
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:28,877
You'd go and entertain
the troops.

1219
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,212
You'd go and do
Alan partridge
for the troops.

1220
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:32,014
That's what
you would do.

1221
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:33,248
And all these proper men

1222
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,583
who are giving
over everything

1223
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:36,919
would love it
as you came out
and went "ah-ha."

1224
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:39,521
You know what I'd love
if a sniper got you
at that moment. Ah..

1225
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:43,659
You didn't even finish
the "ah-ha."
You only got to "ah."

1226
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:46,361
I'd do the "ha" as I would
with my dying breath.

1227
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:47,596
- I don't think you would.
- I would.

1228
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:49,631
No, you wouldn't. It's
to the head, you idiot.

1229
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,100
- Ah!
- You wouldn't say
"ah-ha."

1230
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,903
- I'd get the "ha" out.
- There'd be no "ha."

1231
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,973
And I'd say,
if Steve were here now,
i know what he'd say..

1232
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,842
- Ha-ha!
- Hm.

1233
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,517
- Hello?
-<i> Hi, Steve.</i>

1234
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,985
Hello, Emma love.

1235
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,587
How are you?
How's it going?

1236
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:13,755
<i> Doing very well, yes.</i>

1237
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,091
Good, good.
How's, how's rob doing?

1238
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:17,559
Uh, rob is, uh, great.

1239
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:18,861
He's doing
very well indeed.

1240
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:20,329
I'm good, I'm good.

1241
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,397
Yeah, you're
on speakerphone.
That's why I'm being nice.

1242
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:23,599
Hiya. How are you?

1243
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:25,434
<i> Oh. Hi, rob.</i>
<i> I'm good, thanks.</i>

1244
00:58:25,436 --> 00:58:27,936
I'm just, I'm calling to
remind you that I'm coming
out to see you tomorrow.

1245
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:30,005
- Yay!
- Yay! Thank god.

1246
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,406
I'm at breaking point.

1247
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:32,875
Also..
Okay, great.

1248
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:35,143
And I'm, I'm bringing
yolanda with me

- Oh, great.
- And "the observer."

1251
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,148
So I just wanted to
remind you

1252
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,484
that they do want you
to dress up as don quixote

1253
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:44,486
and Sancho panza, okay?

1254
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:47,055
What a surprise.

1255
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:49,825
- Which one am I?
-<i> Uh, you, rob,</i>
<i> you're Sancho panza.</i>

1256
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:51,960
- Hey.
- Yeah, good.

1257
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:53,896
A supporting role
as ever.

1258
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:12,514
"Parador de cuenca is
a majestic former convent.

1259
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:13,582
Careful.

1260
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:16,084
"Perched above

<i> Hey, rob brydon.</i>
<i> He-he-he-he-he.</i>

1270
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,324
- Hello. Hi, Matt.
- Hey, man, how you doin'?

1271
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:57,793
Yeah, I'm alright.
How -- how are you?

1272
00:59:57,795 --> 00:59:59,461
<i> I'm good.</i>
<i> How's, uh, London?</i>

1273
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:02,331
Oh, I'm in Spain.
I'm not in London,
I'm in Spain.

1274
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:05,300
- Hi, Greg.
- Hi, Steve. How are you?

1275
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:06,501
I've been better.

1276
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:08,637
Uh, do you know they
brought a new writer on

1277
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,573
to, uh, to -- to rewrite,
uh, "missing?"

1278
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:14,309
Yeah, but it's --
it's nothing. It's --
it's just, it's standard.

1279
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,144
It's just -- just
for a Polish,
that's all.

1280
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:20,115
I'm with Steve, with,
uh, with Steve coogan.

1281
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,985
Oh, Steve coogan.
Yeah, yeah, good, good.

1282
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:25,220
Is this the Matt, the..
That's Steve's agent?

1283
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:26,555
Yeah, uh, well, no.

1284
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:27,990
I mean, I've left
the agency.

1285
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:30,492
Uh, uh, we met
at Sundance.

1286
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:31,727
You remember that.

1287
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:34,696
Uh, I've got, uh,
two Oscar nominations.

1288
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:36,231
Uh, the last film
i wrote

1289
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,799
had four -- four
academy award nominations.

1290
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,167
Yeah, I know,
but do you know what,
he's really

1291
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:41,169
he's, he's great,
he's, he's up-and-coming.

1292
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:44,706
Uh, uh, up-and-coming?
I -- I've up and come.

1293
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:45,941
I've already up
and come.

1294
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,342
Yeah. You have.
No, absolutely, you have.

1295
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,477
You have, Steve,
you have.

1296
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,911
Look, let me
cut to the chase.

1297
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:53,715
I saw you
in the..."Horseman."

1298
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:55,250
- "The huntsman."
- "The huntsman."

1299
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:56,284
I saw you
in "the huntsman."

1300
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:57,753
I thought you were
fantastic, man.

1301
01:00:57,755 --> 01:01:00,322
I mean, really,
you burned up the screen.
You've got it.

1302
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,590
<i> That little midget walk</i>

<i> but you were being</i>
<i> under-used there</i>

1305
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:06,862
so let me -- let me
cut to the chase, okay?

1306
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:09,564
You should be doing
what Nick frost is doing.

1307
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:12,134
Well, I did, I -- I did
"the huntsman" with him.

1308
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:13,402
This is -- this is what
I'm saying.

1309
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:17,239
You should be doing what
James corden is doing.

1310
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:18,707
<i> You know, he's</i>
<i> the biggest thing on TV.</i>

1311
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:22,044
I was with James in,
uh, "Gavin and Stacey."

1312
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:23,111
<i> Oh, I heard about that.</i>

1313
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,780

<i> to be fantastic.</i>

<i> but I'll definitely</i>
<i> get a copy.</i>

1315
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:28,784
You know, you should be
the new Simon pegg.

1316
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:31,219
You should be,
you could be

1317
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,922
you will be
the new Ricky gervais.

1318
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:35,691
Oh, gosh.
Well, Ricky, huh?

1319
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:36,825
That's what
we all dream of.

1320
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,427
What does Jeff
think of this?

1321
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:39,461
Jeff,
Jeff's fine with it.

1322
01:01:39,463 --> 01:01:40,595
Jeff's just
very busy doing

1323

another screenplay
for fox, so, he -- he --

1324
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,633
what, what script
is Jeff doing for fox?
I didn't know that.

1325

<i> He's doing a script</i>

-<i> Of course, it is.</i>

1345
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,806
That's what
it's gonna be.
Good, thank you.

1346
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,315
He's British at the end.

1347
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,418
<i> Turns out..</i>

1348
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,253
That's what
Laurie Lee did

1349
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,755
to pay his way
around Spain.

1350
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:42,090
- He busked.
- Yeah.

1351
01:02:56,906 --> 01:03:00,575
You know that, uh,
cuenca was one
of the last places

1352
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:03,211
to fall to the fascists
in the civil war.

1353
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,715
March 29th, 1939.

1354
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:08,683
Perfect position,
it's up on a hilltop

1355
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:10,352
so very difficult
to attack

1356
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:11,686
and very easy to defend.

1357
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:13,522
Yeah, and they may
very well have held out

1358
01:03:13,524 --> 01:03:16,291
if it weren't for the fact
that the, the army

1359
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:19,194
the republican army
turned against
the socialist government.

1360
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:20,428
If it weren't for that

1361
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,597
Franco may well
not have won.

1362
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,432
<i> Hola.</i>

1363
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:25,867
We gave you money
before, mate.

1364
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:27,402
Oh, yeah. Sorry, fellas.
Take care.

1365
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:28,870
You can have a drink
with us
if you want though.

1366
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:30,005
- Yeah?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

1367
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:31,573
- You sure?
- Yeah, grab a pew.

1368
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:33,074
- There's a seat there.
- Actually,
that'd be lovely.

1369
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:34,476
- Cheers, man.
- No worries, yeah.

1370
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,278
<i> Una cana por favor?</i>

1371
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,446
- Sound very good.
- Thank you, man.

1372
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:39,648
Especially like
your backing singers.

1373
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,082
Oh, yeah.
Hardly the monettes,
right?

1374
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:43,051
- You know them?
- Um, yeah.

1375
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:44,719
I suppose
new acquaintances maybe.

1376
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:46,822
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1377
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,590
So, you guys,
you on holiday?

1378
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:50,659
- No, we're working.
- Oh, right.

1379
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:53,929
I'm, uh,
I'm writing a book

1380
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:57,666
about my, um,
sort of
travel through Spain

1381
01:03:57,668 --> 01:04:00,769
replicating a journey
i did when I was,
when I was a younger man.

1382
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:04,873
Well, it's kind of
a little bit inspired by,
um, Laurie Lee.

1383
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:07,342
You know, well, uh,
"when I walked out
one midsummer morning."

1384
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,411
- Yeah --
- and we're driving it.
Cheers!

1385
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:11,613
Uh, cheers, mate.
Yeah, I love Laurie Lee.

1386
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:13,415
That's part of the reason
when I saw you
busking there

1387
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:14,916
I said, "well,
this is how Laurie Lee"

1388
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:17,519
because he paid
his way through Spain
by doing the same thing.

1389
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,422
With a violin, yeah,
but, yeah, right on.

1390
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,157
So you guys staying
in cuenca long?

1391
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:23,558
-<i> No, we're..</i>
- No.

1392
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,861
One day in every place,
I'm writing restaurant
reviews

1393
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:28,263
so we go to one town,
we're there a day
and then we go on.

1394
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:30,765
Oh, have you been in, uh,
San Sebastian for food?

1395
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:32,667
<i> It's the best place</i>
<i> in Spain for food</i>
<i> by a country mile.</i>

1396
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:34,302
- Yeah, I know.
- We were near there
in santander.

1397
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:35,370
-<i> Weren't we?</i>
- Yeah.

1398
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,138
Or catalonia,
not just Barcelona.

1399
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,874
- Food there's excellent,
yeah?
- Yeah, we just..

1400
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:40,475
Well, we're not,
we're trying..

1401
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:41,710
We thought
we were gonna go there

1402
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,278
but we just thought
it was a bit too obvious.

1403
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,113
And we're trying,
we're trying to do stuff
that's a little bit

1404
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,449
like, kind of,
the kind of nooks
and crannies

1405
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:48,750
<i> slightly off,</i>
<i> off the beaten track</i>
<i> a little bit.</i>

1406
01:04:48,752 --> 01:04:50,819
Like San Luca,
near cadiz?

1407
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:52,387
The tuna there
is absolutely banging.

1408
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,822
- You'll love that.
-<i> Yeah, I know.</i>

1409
01:04:53,824 --> 01:04:55,724
<i> It's more, like,</i>
<i> the culture</i>
<i> than the food.</i>

1410
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,158
Although food's
part of it

1411
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,693
but it's more, like,
the kinda cultural
experience.

1412
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:00,562
But if it's food
and culture

1413
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,565
that you are looking for,
valencia.

1414
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:04,966
- Valencia?
-<i> Yeah, you probably</i>
<i> know it.</i>

1415
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:06,735
- Casa Montana?
- I know. Yeah, yeah.

1416
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,036
-<i> Yeah, it's the best.</i>
- I know.

1417
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,871
And valencia's got
the holy grail.

1418
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:12,073
How long does it take to
get to valencia from here?

1419
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,075
Well, valencia's like
two hours away, man.
It's close.

1420
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,443
Let's go to valencia.

1421
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,379
Well, no, we two.. No,
we're not going valencia.

1422
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,880
- Well go to valencia.
- No.

1423
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:20,682
We'll go to valencia.
It's two hours.

1424
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,083
<i> We've got a schedule</i>
<i> worked out.</i>

1425
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:25,186
We got a pre-ordained
route taking
in some, uh --

1426
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:27,622
where's the fun in that?
Stray from the path, man.

1427
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:29,391
Yeah, we sort of are
straying from the path

1428
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:31,493
by not going to places
like catalonia, so..

1429
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:34,262
- Okay.
- You can go there for us.

1430
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,197
- I will, again.
- Okay, again, yeah.

1431
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:38,266
Alright, listen,
I'm gonna head back
to the hotel, anyway

1432
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,002
so, uh, I'm gonna
head off.

1433
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:42,570
- Going back to the hotel?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

1434
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:44,105
- Now?
- Yeah, yeah.

1435
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,975
You're alright, you'll be
alright here
with, uh, man.

1436
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:49,010
Get him to play
a few tunes.
Alright, mate.

1437
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:50,445
Good luck
with your Bo diddly stuff.

1438
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,513
And thanks
for the beer, man.

1439
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:52,547
<i> Yeah, no worries. Okay.</i>

1440
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,182
Alright, see you later.

1441
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,155
- Sorry about that.
- Touched a nerve
no more.

1442
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:01,923
He, uh, doesn't like
to be told things

1443
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:04,926
that he thinks he knows.

1444
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,298
- Hello.
-<i> Hello.</i>

1445
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,768
You look, uh,
delectable and tasty.

1446
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,570
Like a piece of ham.

1447
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:17,806
Oh, alright, then,
you look sexy.

1448
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,942
<i> I don't feel very sexy.</i>

1449
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:22,377
I had a chat
with the builders

1450
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:25,113
and they can't start
for another month.

1451
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:29,517
-<i> Hey, Misha.</i>
- Hi. Where are you?

1452
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,087
I had a fan phone
call today.

1453
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:33,588
<i> Do you remember</i>
<i> the agent</i>

1454
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:37,025
<i> Steve used to have</i>
<i> in la called Matt?</i>

1455
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:38,393
Sort of, yeah.

1456
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:40,028
Look, when you come back

1457
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,030
I was thinking

1458
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,399
maybe we could go out
to Rachel's
for the weekend?

1459
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:46,201
Fantastic.
Yeah, I'd love to do that.

1460
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:48,169
-<i> You're not excited.</i>
- Yeah. But I'll..

1461
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,205
Uh, you know what, yeah,
uh, we'll definitely
do that.

1462
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,573
But why don't you
come out earlier?

1463
01:06:51,575 --> 01:06:53,942
He wants me
to go with him

1464
01:06:53,944 --> 01:06:56,044
and be represented
by him in la.

1465
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:59,080
Well, surely, there's no
point in that, is there?

1466
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:00,448
<i> Absolutely</i>
<i> the right answer.</i>

1467
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,384
<i> Well done. I give you</i>
<i> two points for that.</i>

1468
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:05,220
And that is what I will be
telling this little
American fellow

1469
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:07,722
uh, in me own way. Uh..

1470
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:09,157
That it's too far away
from me.

1471
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:10,225
<i> Yeah, of course, it is.</i>

1472
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,560
But isn't Joe
supposed to come out?

1473
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:14,629
<i> Yeah, but he's --</i>
<i> he can do his own thing.</i>

1474
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:16,064
You know,
he's a big boy.

1475
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,599
<i> How old is he now?</i>

1476
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:19,534
He's 20 years old now.

1477
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,036
Oh, you better
watch out.

1478
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:23,138
I might like him
more than I like you.

1479
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:26,541
- Yeah, you're gross.
- Look, I gotta go.

1480
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,110
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay, bye.

1481
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,380
Oh, they're here.

1482
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,315
Hey. Oh.

1483
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,750
- <i> Hola.</i>
<i>- Hola.</i>

1484
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,085
- How you doing?
- Hey.

1485
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,253
- Good to see you.
- You, too.
How's it going?

1486
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,155
- Thank you. How are you?
- Great.

1487
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:15,590
- Very nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1488
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:16,858
- Hey, how are you?
- Hello, you alright?

1489
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,626
- Well, good to see you.
- How was your flight?

1490
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:21,329
Yeah, it was very good.
So photographs.

1491
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:22,597
- Location's up the hill.
- What about them?

1492
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,605
- Yes.
- I'm gonna
have them there.

1493
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,006
Yeah.

1494
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:37,479
These are about two sizes
too big, the shoes.

1495
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:39,848
Yeah, this is
really painful.

1496
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:43,685
I don't know,
i don't know how anyone
can fight in this stuff.

1497
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:45,420
What shoe size
did you give them?

1498
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:48,223
-<i> The size that you sent,</i>
<i> sent me over.</i>
- Well, that was seven.

1499
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:51,159
These feel like a ten
or, or an eleven.

1500
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:52,961
You've only gotta wear
them for a minute, so..

1501
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,562
- Oh..
- You alright, Steve?

1502
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:56,030
So, you guys ready?

1503
01:08:56,032 --> 01:08:59,367
We could've got changed,
uh, up here
and not down there.

1504
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,036
Let him push you up.

1505
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:03,171
One, two, three.

1506
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,306
Okay.

1507
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,875
- I can give you a push.
- I can give you a hand.

1508
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:08,676
No, no. I don't need
any help.
I've done it before.

1509
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:10,044
One, two, three.

1510
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:13,548
- Hey, there.
-<i> Yay, good.</i>

1511
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,217
Just about getting
the timing right.

1512
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:18,086
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1513
01:09:18,088 --> 01:09:20,889
There's no saddle.
Alright, thank you.

1514
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:22,624
Hang on.

1515
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:24,792
- Okay. Do it quickly.
Yeah?
- Hold your horses.

1516
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,094
Oh-oh!

1517
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:32,934
- Take the picture.
- Just take
the fucking picture.

1518
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:35,103
What's she doing there?
Is she on the Internet?

1519
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:39,107
- Just take the picture.
-<i> Yes, I'm coming, rob.</i>

1520
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,476
Very good.

1521
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,187
don quixote had
three trips, didn't he?

1522
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,821
He had the one
that he went out
on his own.

1523
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:56,090
And he went back
and visited
Sancho panza

1524
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:58,159
and then he had the sequel
and -- and this is

1525
01:09:58,161 --> 01:09:59,627
now your third trip.

1526
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:01,162
When cervantes
wrote the sequel

1527
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:04,566
in the interim, after
he'd written
the -- the first part

1528
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:07,235
there was a fake sequel
published.

1529
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:10,104
Then he incorporated
the fake sequel

1530
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,339
into his real sequel.

1531
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:12,840
So, he made that part
of the story.

1532
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,909
So when he wrote
in his travels
in the second book

1533
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:17,478
he bumps into people
who've read
the fake sequel.

1534
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,714
And so he can slag it off
within the pages

1535
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,082
as don quixote.

1536
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,918
That is so bold
and innovative.

1537
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,620
I mean,
it's 500 years ago.

1538
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:27,922
So, effectively,
he was post-modern

1539
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:29,691
before there was any
modern to be post about.

1540
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:30,725
<i> Amazing.</i>

1541
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,335
Cervantes, of course,
when he was 37

1542
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:41,836
he married
a 19-year-old.

1543
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,504
Impressive for a man
with one arm.

1544
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:45,006
Thirty years ago
when I came to Spain

1545
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:46,841
<i> I was 18 years old,</i>
<i> I was pursuing</i>

1546
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:48,142
a 37-year-old woman.

1547
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:50,712
- She was 37?
- The reverse.

1548
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,146
I wasn't doing
the kind of cliche

1549
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:53,214
going with a
younger woman..

1550
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:55,750
She was actually
20 years older than me.

1551
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:59,687
Would you now be with
a woman 20 years older?

1552
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:01,589
Well, I don't --
i think that that's --

1553
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:02,890
I'll ask again.

1554
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:05,393
Would you<i> now</i> be with
a woman 20 years older?

1555
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:06,494
A 70-year-old.
A 70-year-old.

1556
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:08,162
That's academic.

1557
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:10,398
She -- she could be
in any profession,
it wouldn't matter.

1558
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:16,104
But he imagined that
the, uh, the inns
were castles, didn't he?

1559
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:17,805
- In -- in
his imagination.
- He did, yeah.

1560
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:19,173
We've been staying
in inns?

1561
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:21,175
Well, we've been literally
staying in castles.

1562
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:23,111
Sorry, we have, yeah.
No, we've been staying
in castles.

1563
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,179
I think they're inns.
He stayed in inns, he
thought they were castles.

1564
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:26,547
- So it's, uh..
- So -- so, yes.

1565
01:11:26,549 --> 01:11:28,883
- Like a circle
and a spiral.
- The other way around.

1566
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:31,052
- Yes.
- Like a wheel
within a wheel.

1567
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:32,387
<i> Never ending</i>
<i> or beginning</i>

1568
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:33,588
<i> on an</i>
<i> ever-spinning reel.</i>

1569
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:34,589
<i> Yeah.</i>

1570
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,591
Like the circles
that you find

1571
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:39,894
in the windmills
of your mind.

1572
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:41,229
-<i> The windmills.</i>
- Windmills.

1573
01:11:41,231 --> 01:11:44,198
That could be
a post-modern manifesto.

1574
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,934
- It really could.
- Or a lovely song
from the '70s.

1575
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,596
<i> "Spanish fly,"</i>
<i> rob brydon, Steve coogan.</i>

1576
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:17,131
<i> Wonderful stuff</i>
<i> from them.</i>

1577
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:18,966
Now, don't forget,
we've come a long way
this morning --

1578
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:20,601
uh, let me just
interrupt you there

1579
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:23,037
old kibby Bruce,
me old friend.

1580
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,273
Because, uh, anyone
who's anyone

1581
01:12:25,275 --> 01:12:27,342
will know that..

1582
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:30,278
...the title of the song
by herb Albert

1583
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,481
is "Spanish flea"
and not "Spanish fly."

1584
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:35,383
May I be so bold
as to pick you up

1585
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:39,087
on a wee-point,
which is, that it's
not herb Albert.

1586
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:41,589
It's herb Alpert,
with a p.

1587
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:44,025
You got your -- your ps
and your bs
mixed up there.

1588
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,094
You got your fleas and
your flies all over.

1589
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:48,629
And you've got your,
you've got your ps
and your bs.

1590
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:50,498
<i> I feel a little bold</i>
<i> with the mistake there</i>

1591
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,467
<i> so that you can</i>
<i> pick me up,</i>
<i> so we're all..</i>

1592
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,468
So we're all
even-Steven.

1593
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:56,070
<i> ...probably never know</i>
<i> if that was a sweet..</i>

1594
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:57,905
<i> Fleas, flies,</i>
<i> peas, bees.</i>

1595
01:12:57,907 --> 01:12:59,040
You put a p
in the wrong place..

1596
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,341
I had a p
in the wrong place once

1597
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:02,343
they won't let me back
in that supermarket again.

1598
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:04,045
Yes, and don't forget
that, you know

1599
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:07,382
time flies like an arrow,
but fruit flies

1600
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:08,816
like a banana.

1601
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:30,104
This is beautiful.
Very calming.

1602
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,973
-<i> Yeah.</i>
- It's wonderful.

1603
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:34,509
It's interesting, isn't it?
We started in the
birthplace

1604
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:37,178
of king ferdinand.

1605
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:41,115
And here we are
at the place
where they were buried.

1606
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:43,418
- Here?
- Yeah, in the hotel.

1607
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,952
- It wasn't a hotel then.
- No, it wasn't then.

1608
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:47,188
That would be awful,
wouldn't it? Dreadful.

1609
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:50,091
I have a reservation,
uh, Smith.

1610
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,993
-<i> Corpses of.</i>
- Give us a moment, please.

1611
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:53,861
We are about to bury
the king, please.

1612
01:13:53,863 --> 01:13:55,163
<i> What? Yes,</i>
<i> we have a gymnasium.</i>

1613
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:58,099
Why are they buried
in granada then?

1614
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:00,134
Because this
is the last town

1615
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:02,537
to fall
to the catholics.

1616
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:06,007
That's why they call them
the catholic
king and queen.

1617
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:08,476
The thing with the moors
is they were way
more tolerant

1618
01:14:08,478 --> 01:14:10,144
than the catholics
who came after them.

1619
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:13,014
I'm a big fan
of the moors. I'm..

1620
01:14:13,016 --> 01:14:16,350
Dudley Moore,
Christy Moore,
Patrick Moore.

1621
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:18,586
<i> No more, please.</i>

1622
01:14:18,588 --> 01:14:21,022
- Roger Moore.
- No.

1623
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:24,859
<i> When I think back</i>
<i> to the moors</i>
<i> being here in Spain</i>

1624
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:28,229
<i> I can honestly say</i>
<i> we had a wonderful time.</i>

1625
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:31,399
Mother booked the holiday
and we arrived

1626
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:34,001
and found the hotel
to be to our liking.

1627
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:37,472
And of course, what you're
forgetting to point out
is that the moors

1628
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:41,342
when they conquered Spain
in the early 8th century

1629
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,177
they were, uh,
encountering a Europe

1630
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:45,613
that was still very much
in the dark ages.

1631
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:47,148
It was pitch black.

1632
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:50,084
But they, of course, built
beautiful palaces
like this.

1633
01:14:50,086 --> 01:14:51,853
They were very ahead
of their time.

1634
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:54,989
I have to tell you,
when we were building
these palaces

1635
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:58,426
my fellow moors,
mother, father,
and sister

1636
01:14:58,428 --> 01:15:00,828
sometimes we would
encounter a workman

1637
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:05,299
who, perhaps,
wasn't working quite
as quickly as I would want.

1638
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:06,934
Then I would
say to him..

1639
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,269
- Move!
- Move!

1640
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,571
- Move!
- Move!

1641
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:12,139
- Move!
- Move!

1642
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:15,343
- Um..
- A lot of them thought
they were hearing cows.

1643
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:17,311
The thing about doing
Roger Moore..

1644
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:20,381
- Yes?
- Less is more.

1645
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:23,651
Ah, you've met
my brother, les.
Les, come in.

1646
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:26,220
That's right,
I'm also a Moore.
Les Moore.

1647
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:28,189
I was trying to hint
that you should always

1648
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:31,025
leave your audience
wanting more.

1649
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,661
My audience
constantly wants more

1650
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:35,062
and that's what
i give them.

1651
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:37,331
Roger Moore.

1652
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:40,902
Oh, quit while you
are ahead.

1653
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,737
They introduced
the orange to Spain.

1654
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:44,505
- The moors?
- Yeah.

1655
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:46,741
- Really? From where?
- She's absolutely right.

1656
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:47,808
- I guess Morocco.
- Morocco.

1657
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:48,943
That's where
they were coming from.

1658
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:50,778
I could explain it to you
if you like.

1659
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:54,115
It was my mother.
She packed one
into her hand luggage.

1660
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:55,583
-<i> He didn't get the hint,</i>
<i> did he?</i>
- No.

1661
01:15:55,585 --> 01:15:57,385
<i> On one of our holidays</i>

1662
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:59,320
of course, I said,
"mother, what are
you doing?"

1663
01:15:59,322 --> 01:16:02,890
She said, "shush, Roger,
I'm going to introduce
the orange to Spain."

1664
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:05,593
And about the other thing
that moors introduced
was, of course

1665
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,061
uh, our numerical
system.

1666
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,896
That's right, we're
going to calculate --

1667
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:09,931
because basically they..

1668
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:11,499
We used
to use Roman numerals

1669
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:13,834
and it was only
when they found the
arabic numerical system

1670
01:16:13,836 --> 01:16:17,805
that we developed that
into, into the

1671
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:19,874
the -- the numerical
system we use today.

1672
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:21,409
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

1673
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:22,577
Mother said
it would never work.

1674
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:24,045
He's very crazy.

1675
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:25,313
<i> Um, the fact is that</i>

1676
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:27,848
the, the moors were fa --
far more sophisticated.

1677
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:31,919
They knew about
medicine, philosophy,
uh, mathematics.

1678
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,288
- Uh, uh, astronomy.
- Oh, we love looking..

1679
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,891
Very, very..
Way more advanced than..

1680
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:38,960
And also managed
to marry, uh --

1681
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:40,861
my parents did marry.
You're quite right.

1682
01:16:40,863 --> 01:16:42,663
They married at a young
age, they had me --

1683
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:44,498
rob, rob, rob --

1684
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,668
- it was a wonderful time.
- Seriously, seriously.

1685
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:51,172
It was a wonderful day.
My uncle bertie
gave the sermon.

1686
01:16:51,174 --> 01:16:53,808
He was a preacher,
you see?

1687
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,843
The Greek philosophers
were translated

1688
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:59,413
into arabic by, by --
by the moors,
and it was only when

1689
01:16:59,415 --> 01:17:00,448
during --
during the crusades

1690
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,249
when they
invaded Toledo --

1691
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,751
I remember father
sitting at his desk

1692
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:05,620
<i> translating night</i>
<i> and day.</i>

1693
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:07,321
<i> My mother</i>
<i> would say to him</i>

1694
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:09,490
"when are you going to
take Roger to the park?"

1695
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:13,294
Aristotle's teachings
were translated
into arabic by the muslims

1696
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:14,962
and then during
the crusades, they --

1697
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:17,398
why didn't you say they
were done by the moors?

1698
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,866
Are you trying
to discourage me?

1699
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:21,035
- What?
-<i> Look, please, yes --</i>

1700
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:23,704
you've stopped
saying moors,
you started saying muslims

1701
01:17:23,706 --> 01:17:27,875
and I find that a little
racially offensive.

1702
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:29,110
Go on. Please.

1703
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:31,445
You started off referring
to us as the moors.

1704
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:33,781
<i> Now you're referring</i>
<i> to us as muslims.</i>

1705
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:34,849
<i> The moors were muslims.</i>

1706
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:36,717
But why did you start
with moors?

1707
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,519
It doesn't matter,
the -- the people
I'm talkin' about

1708
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:40,254
were one and the same,
moors were muslims.

1709
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:43,524
No, I'm not Roger Muslim.
I'm Roger Moore.

1710
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:46,727
Dear god. Oh, dear.

1711
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:48,796
Oh, I've bought you
a ticket the first thing
in the morning

1712
01:17:48,798 --> 01:17:49,897
to see the alhambra.

1713
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,632
- Oh, brilliant.
Great, great.
- Yeah.

1714
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:52,867
Rob, I've got one
for you too.

1715
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:55,836
Can I go later?
Can I go after breakfast?

1716
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,038
It'll be busy.

1717
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,240
Yolanda,
you should come with me.

1718
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:02,143
I can't. I have to take
an early flight back
to London.

1719
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:03,944
- Really? That's a shame.
-<i> Hm.</i>

1720
01:18:03,946 --> 01:18:05,446
You're leavin' me alone
with him?

1721
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:08,282
Ah, you won't be alone.
I'm coming with you
to malaga.

1722
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,484
I'm gonna make sure
Joe gets to you safely.

1723
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:11,919
- Thank the lord.
- Great.

1724
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,798
- Hello?
- Hey, hey, dad.

1725
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,500
- Hey. How you doin'?
- I'm..

1726
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:28,002
Yeah, I'm -- I'm good.
How are you?

1727
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:30,571
Um, great.
Really looking forward
to seeing you.

1728
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:33,841
Well, I've, I've, uh,
I've missed you, buddy.

1729
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:37,311
Uh, yeah, that was, that
was what I was calling
about, actually.

1730
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:40,381
Uh, yeah. Emma's, Emma's,
uh, she's been
in touch, right?

1731
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,049
<i> She said she's organized</i>
<i> all the flights --</i>

1732
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,952
no, dad. I can't come.

1733
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:49,623
What do you m --
what are you
talking about?

1734
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,692
I just --
i just can't come.

1735
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:55,463
<i> I need to, I need</i>
<i> to stay here with Helen.</i>

1736
01:18:55,465 --> 01:18:57,431
What's going on?
Talk to me.

1737
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:00,668
She's pregnant.

1738
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,875
- You're fucking
kidding me.
-<i> She's..</i>

1739
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:10,311
- You fucking idiot.
-<i> She's pregnant.</i>

1740
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:13,147
<i> I need to stay here</i>
<i> with her, so we can</i>
<i>figure out what we're gonna do.</i>

1741
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:14,548
Wait, wait, wait, wait..

1742
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,450
Are you certain
she's pregnant?

1743
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:18,252
Yes, she's definitely
pregnant.

1744
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,188
And you're sure
it's, it's yours?

1745
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,957
- Dad!
- Um..

1746
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,093
Um..

1747
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,030
You're 20 years old.

1748
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,566
You're too young
to have a kid.
You know, it's -- it's..

1749
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:34,135
<i> Any decisions</i>
<i> you make now</i>

1750
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:36,804
<i> will have ramifications</i>
<i> for the rest</i>
<i> of your life.</i>

1751
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,306
Yes, I know

1752
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:42,576
but I'm not just making
decisions for me anymore.

1753
01:19:42,578 --> 01:19:45,980
I need to think about her
and we need to think about
what we're gonna do.

1754
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:47,348
Hah.

1755
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,451
-<i> Okay.</i>
- Sorry.

1756
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:52,486
You see, you don't have
to be sorry, okay?

1757
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:57,091
<i> It's okay. It doesn't --</i>
<i> doesn't matter</i>
<i> about coming over here.</i>

1758
01:19:57,093 --> 01:19:59,226
You know, it just, um..

1759
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:02,530
Whatever happens,
I'm -- I'm --
I'm here for you, alright?

1760
01:20:02,532 --> 01:20:04,231
-<i> Thanks, dad.</i>
- And I love you.

1761
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,734
<i> Love you too.</i>

1762
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:10,437
Okay. Listen, um..

1763
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,542
And don't worry
about it, alright?

1764
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:17,044
Hm. Yeah.

1765
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:19,914
I love you,
and I'll talk
to you later, okay?

1766
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,715
Yeah.
Love you too.

1767
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,935
<i> Gracias.</i>

1768
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,601
Hey, good morning.

1769
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:15,202
<i> Buenos dias,</i>
<i> amigo</i> coogan.

1770
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:17,938
How was the alhambra?

1771
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,774
It was, uh, good,
it was good

1772
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:24,712
but it was, uh,
you know, beautiful

1773
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:26,580
spiritual,
blah, blah, blah.

1774
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:27,915
You okay?

1775
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,051
Joe's not comin' out.

1776
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:32,987
What? Why?

1777
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:35,689
Uh, his girlfriend's
pregnant.

1778
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:37,191
Oh, my god.

1779
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:40,361
- Bloody hell.
- What's he gonna do?

1780
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:42,529
Ah, well,
i told him he had options.

1781
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:44,331
What does that mean?

1782
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,433
Well, he's too young
to -- to be a dad.

1783
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:48,102
<i> He's not very worldly,</i>
<i> you know?</i>

1784
01:21:48,104 --> 01:21:49,904
You know what this means,
don't you?

1785
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:59,346
I'd start thinking
about it.

1786
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:04,285
You're gonna be
a granddad.

1787
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,388
Thank you, lord.

1788
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:15,896
Look at those. Ah.

1789
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:17,865
Yeah, a lot of people think
they're ugly
'cause they're modern

1790
01:22:17,867 --> 01:22:21,201
but I think
they're, they're beautiful
'cause they're functional.

1791
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:23,504
<i> "Tilting at turbines."</i>
<i> That's what we should</i>
<i> call my, uh</i>

1792
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:25,039
<i> book about Spain.</i>

1793
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:26,440
<i> Good idea.</i>

1794
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,348
Oh, look, almeria.
Isn't that where you were
gonna take Joe snorkeling?

1795
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,216
- Yeah, it was, yeah.
- Oh.

1796
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:38,886
I brought him here
as a baby
when I was filming.

1797
01:22:38,888 --> 01:22:40,387
How old was he?

1798
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:42,856
- Oh, about six months.
- Aww.

1799
01:22:42,858 --> 01:22:45,526
You know, we could
still stop.
We've got time.

1800
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:48,362
I'll go snorkeling
with you if you want.
I -- I could be Joe.

1801
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:51,865
You dressed in a nappy,
crawling around
on the beach eating sand

1802
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:53,934
uh, only has
limited appeal.

1803
01:22:53,936 --> 01:22:55,302
Well, it wouldn't be
for everyone.

1804
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,870
I mean,
I'm the first to admit.

1805
01:22:56,872 --> 01:23:00,708
That was a long time ago
when I was still married
to his mom.

1806
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:03,077
Yeah.

1807
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:33,707
Do you know
who lives in malaga?

1808
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:35,275
The mayor of malaga.

1809
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:37,778
- Yes. Correct.
- Thank you.

1810
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,146
And Sean Connery.

1811
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:41,181
Marbella,
Mr. coogan, marbella.

1812
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,850
You make the mistake.
He lives in marbella.

1813
01:23:42,852 --> 01:23:44,752
Yeah, but he -- he flies
into malaga.

1814
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,656
Uh, by all accounts

1815
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:53,227
he's a very well-respected
pillar of the society.

1816
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:56,563
Yes, he's, uh, very active
in his civic,
civic duties.

1817
01:23:56,565 --> 01:24:00,401
I like to get involved.
Uh, the recycling,
for example.

1818
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:03,370
Plastics on a Friday,
cardboard on a Saturday.

1819
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,607
Do you expect me
to talk?

1820
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:08,475
No, Mr. bond.
I expect you to die.

1821
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:11,345
- Well..
-<i> This is</i>
<i> the Russian salad.</i>

1822
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:12,446
Thank you.

1823
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:15,816
When he met
cubby broccoli

1824
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:17,718
and, uh, Harry Saltzman

1825
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,454
to discuss the role,
as he left the meeting

1826
01:24:20,456 --> 01:24:24,158
and they looked out
of the window and said
he.. Not yet.

1827
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,860
And said..
"What are you doing?"

1828
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:28,996
Getting ready to do
Sean Connery.

1829
01:24:28,998 --> 01:24:31,899
You appear to be
doing him already.

1830
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:35,202
As he left the building,
and he walked out
across regent street

1831
01:24:35,204 --> 01:24:39,039
they looked down and said,
"that man is bond.
He moves like a panther."

1832
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,641
- Like a panther.
- Like a panther.

1833
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:42,776
Yes, but walking like
a panther

1834
01:24:42,778 --> 01:24:46,146
is not enough to bag you
the role of James Bond

1835
01:24:46,148 --> 01:24:50,250
because, of course,
bond is also something
of a bulldog, so --

1836
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:51,351
he was primarily --

1837
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:53,754
he had to be a combination
of a panther

1838
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,889
and, and a bulldog.

1839
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:59,259
Apologies if I've been
dragging my ass
around the carpet

1840
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,295
because I may
have worms.

1841
01:25:01,297 --> 01:25:04,131
I have a very itchy anus,
i apologize now

1842
01:25:04,133 --> 01:25:06,733
but it's part and parcel
of being a panther
or a dog.

1843
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:08,535
When you introduce me
to blofeld

1844
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:11,271
perhaps I should curl up
and lick my balls.

1845
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:19,213
I think I make quite
a good knight, don't I?

1846
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:20,714
-<i> Yeah.</i>
- You do, actually, yeah.

1847
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:21,715
<i> With the best one</i>
<i> in the world</i>

1848
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:23,217
<i> you could never be</i>
<i> El cid.</i>

1849
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:26,320
You could be a chap
called sid,
just not El cid.

1850
01:25:26,322 --> 01:25:27,955
- I could be old sid.
- Yeah.

1851
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:29,756
- You could be old sid.
- Old El cid.

1852
01:25:29,758 --> 01:25:32,726
Look me in the eye
and tell me you think
you could play El cid

1853
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:34,862
in a remake,
the charlton heston role.

1854
01:25:34,864 --> 01:25:37,631
I mean, then you could
certainly play
Michael hordern in El cid.

1855
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:40,067
- Who did he play?
- Someone's dad.
I can't remember.

1856
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:41,902
Oh. You know
who Michael hordern was?

1857
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:43,904
- Michael hordern?
- I don't.

1858
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:45,038
Michael hordern
would go..

1859
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,041
- Uh, Paddington bear --
- yeah, I know --

1860
01:25:48,043 --> 01:25:50,978
that wasn't
Michael hordern, that was
Michel hordern's horse.

1861
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,247
Michael hordern.

1862
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:55,816
Didn't he do
"no man's land"
with gielgud?

1863
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:57,484
You wouldn't know,
it's theater, but he did.

1864
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:58,519
- Did he?
- Yeah.

1865
01:25:58,521 --> 01:26:00,187
You know
who's doing it now?

1866
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:02,923
I -- Ian mckellen.
"You shall not have
the ring --"

1867
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:06,527
Ian mckellen speaks
like that
with a slight..

1868
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:09,329
However refined he is,
northern flat vowels.

1869
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:10,397
Yes.<i> Gracias.</i>

1870
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:11,465
<i> Finito.</i>

1871
01:26:11,467 --> 01:26:13,800
<i> Muchos gracias.</i>

1872
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:15,435
-<i> Thank you.</i>
- Thank you.

1873
01:26:15,437 --> 01:26:17,871
Yeah, but you're missing
a bit of campness, you
see, because Ian --

1874
01:26:17,873 --> 01:26:19,339
well, no,
i think you overplay that.

1875
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:22,342
No, no, no, no, no,
no..

1876
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:23,844
You don't quite
get it --

1877
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:26,446
I've spoken to him
in person.
Oh, you do make me laugh.

1878
01:26:26,448 --> 01:26:29,116
I have met him
many, many times.

1879
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:32,052
- How many times?
- Many, many times.

1880
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:36,023
And you don't get
the musicality when
he throws a line up --

1881
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:38,892
that was good.
That was good.

1882
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:42,529
But still with
the flat vowels, they're
very much in evidence

1883
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:45,065
however much he may
try to be
the supronunciation

1884
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:46,767
with the vowels.

1885
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:49,937
Oh, you do make me laugh,
you really do.
Oh, you do make me laugh.

1886
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:52,005
Oh. We need a laugh,
don't we?

1887
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:54,341
Oh. You do make me laugh,
rob, you do.

1888
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:56,677
Does he do that more
in private though?

1889
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:59,046
'Cause when he met me,
he said, "you're a very
good actor."

1890
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:11,692
- <i> Ooh, yum!</i>
<i>- Ah!</i>

1891
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:14,461
- Enjoy.
-<i> Gracias, gracias.</i>

1892
01:27:14,463 --> 01:27:16,697
<i> Do you wanna come back</i>
<i> with me? I can get you</i>
<i> on the same flight.</i>

1893
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:19,866
No, I'll stay. Thank you.
Um, I'm gonna write..
I'm gonna finish my book.

1894
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:22,336
I think the word you're
looking for is start.

1895
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:27,841
Thinkin' about Joe.

1896
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:30,377
Twenty is a young age
to have a child.

1897
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:31,979
How old were you
when you had your kids?

1898
01:27:31,981 --> 01:27:34,881
- Forty-three.
- A bit
of a difference.

1899
01:27:34,883 --> 01:27:37,818
Yes. I didn't drink
till I was 35.

1900
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,253
Had my first child
at 43.

1901
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:41,455
Are the two related?
We'll never know.

1902
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:43,824
How old?
Yeah, what's her name,
the girlfriend?

1903
01:27:43,826 --> 01:27:45,926
- Helen. She's 19.
- Ah!

1904
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:48,562
- Nineteen?
-<i> Gosh.</i>

1905
01:27:48,564 --> 01:27:50,197
Only 19 years old.

1906
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:55,302
She was only
19 years old.

1907
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:57,137
I don't mean
any disrespect,
Steve, but --

1908
01:27:57,139 --> 01:28:00,407
she was only 19,
she was only.. You've got
to get the voice, mate.

1909
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:02,476
Well, you got emosh
in your voice
when you say it.

1910
01:28:02,478 --> 01:28:03,944
- She was only --
- now he has.

1911
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:05,646
She was 19 years old.

1912
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:07,214
Joe, who's met
the young lady --

1913
01:28:07,216 --> 01:28:11,218
she was,
she was only 19 years old.

1914
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:14,888
When Joe and Helen
had a child

1915
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:17,090
she was only
19-years-old.

1916
01:28:17,092 --> 01:28:20,160
She was only..
It's actually 16
in the film.

1917
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:24,665
I know that,
but Helen was
only 19 years old

1918
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:26,433
and she had a child
with Joe.

1919
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:28,702
She had a grandfather
who was so talented

1920
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:30,437
who was so gifted.

1921
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:33,607
- He was only --
- the grandfather
was only 50 years old.

1922
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:35,475
Fifty years old.

1923
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:37,678
Hey, do you know
who was born in malaga?

1924
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,179
- No.
- Picasso.

1925
01:28:39,181 --> 01:28:40,347
- Who?
- Picasso.

1926
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:41,515
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

1927
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:43,717
They've -- they've opened
a museum to him.

1928
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:46,953
Who played Picasso
in a very popular film
of the last ten years?

1929
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:48,388
Who was it?
No, ask Emma.

1930
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,390
Who played Picasso?

1931
01:28:50,392 --> 01:28:54,027
Guess, it's one of rob's
five impressions. That
should narrow it down.

1932
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:55,862
It wasn't tom Jones,
it wasn't tom Jones.

1933
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:57,264
- No, I wouldn't have
thought that.
- Wasn't tom Jones?

1934
01:28:57,266 --> 01:28:58,699
- Okay, we're
getting closer.
- Spanish, Spanish.

1935
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:00,600
- You're getting warmer.
- Tony Hopkins.

1936
01:29:00,602 --> 01:29:04,538
Tony Hopkins played a,
a surviving,
surviving Picasso.

1937
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,073
I played the painter,
wonderful man.

1938
01:29:06,075 --> 01:29:08,709
Uh, I don't like to talk
about it. I like to draw.

1939
01:29:08,711 --> 01:29:10,944
I like to put the eyes
here, the nose there.

1940
01:29:10,946 --> 01:29:13,013
- The mouth up there.
- He played Picasso
as a welshman?

1941
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:14,414
Well, he didn't,
he didn't, sir.

1942
01:29:14,416 --> 01:29:16,616
- He didn't do
a Spanish accent, Steve.
- Did he not?

1943
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:18,752
He doesn't have
your versatility.
Let's be honest.

1944
01:29:18,754 --> 01:29:22,389
Known to paint and
he painted the paintings
in a figurative way.

1945
01:29:22,391 --> 01:29:24,691
He knew how to
do still life
and he knew how to, uh

1946
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,493
you know, paint,
uh, the radius.

1947
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:29,129
Pablo, Pablo,
uh, some of the men
are saying

1948
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:31,164
that you're painting
in a very strange way.

1949
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:33,934
They're saying that
the nose is where
the eyes should be.

1950
01:29:33,936 --> 01:29:36,269
- Some of them are saying
you're a cubist.
- Oh, Pablo, is it?

1951
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:37,938
Not captain or sir?
Um, eh?

1952
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,639
They're a rambling,
skip load.

1953
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:40,874
<i> They want me to put</i>
<i> the nose in the front</i>
<i> of the face</i>

1954
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,109
in the middle,
like that.

1955
01:29:42,111 --> 01:29:43,810
Right? And the eyes
next -- next to the nose?

1956
01:29:43,812 --> 01:29:44,945
- Is that what you want?
- Yes, sir.

1957
01:29:44,947 --> 01:29:47,047
Tell the men
I'm gonna put the nose

1958
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:48,882
where the cheek is
and we'll put
the eyes up here

1959
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:50,517
and the mouth
round the corner.

1960
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:52,753
And we'll sail down to the
cape of good hope,
goddamn ya, sir.

1961
01:29:52,755 --> 01:29:54,121
Will put the eyes
where I want to

1962
01:29:54,123 --> 01:29:55,355
and the nose
where I want to.

1963
01:29:55,357 --> 01:29:56,423
If you turn your back
on me

1964
01:29:56,425 --> 01:29:58,158
I shall put two eyes
on your back

1965
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,559
and a nose down
by your ass.

1966
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:00,961
Do you want that, sir?
Is that what
you want, sir?

1967
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:02,329
Don't turn
your back on me.

1968
01:30:02,331 --> 01:30:04,598
I will draw you
like a cubist.
That's what I'll do.

1969
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,434
If you turn your back
on me, I'll put a nose
on your bottom, sir.

1970
01:30:07,436 --> 01:30:09,803
Down the hole
is a good way,
down the hole we shall go.

1971
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:12,839
What's interesting
about Picasso is
and why I love him

1972
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:15,308
his early paintings
are very orthodox.

1973
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:16,777
- Very accessible.
-<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

1974
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:18,578
He knew how to do
all that, but he said

1975
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:21,348
"that's not enough, I want
to rewrite the rulebook

1976
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:22,983
<i> and be radical</i>
<i> and avant- garde."</i>

1977
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:25,619
Are you a bit
like Picasso, Steve?

1978
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:29,189
- Well, I, I empathize
with his point of view.
- Yes, he is, he is!

1979
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:30,724
- He's gonna say it.
- What I'm saying is --

1980
01:30:30,726 --> 01:30:32,559
<i> can I record this?</i>
<i> Hang on, hang on,</i>
<i> let me..</i>

1981
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:46,039
- <i> Hola. Buenas tardes.</i>
<i>- Hola. Buenas tardes.</i>

1982
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:49,109
Um, I've got a reservation,
Steve coogan.

1983
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:53,013
"This castle
is gibralfaro

1984
01:30:53,015 --> 01:30:55,649
"named after the same man
as Gibraltar.

1985
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:59,186
"When the moors
came in 711 they were
only a few thousand.

1986
01:30:59,188 --> 01:31:00,353
"Within a couple
of years

1987
01:31:00,355 --> 01:31:03,457
they controlled
almost all of Spain."

1988
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:07,227
That's exactly
the same as Isis
and the modern caliphate

1989
01:31:07,229 --> 01:31:08,762
because there was only
a few thousands of them

1990
01:31:08,764 --> 01:31:11,665
and yet they controlled
half of Syria
and half of Iraq.

1991
01:31:11,667 --> 01:31:13,633
And they're trying to
emulate what the moors did

1992
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:16,570
when they had controlled
everywhere
from cordoba to Baghdad.

1993
01:31:16,572 --> 01:31:18,839
<i> Well, Isis aren't tolerant.</i>
<i> They're not doing it</i>
<i> with tolerance and --</i>

1994
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:21,107
no, they're not,
but islam, uh, is --

1995
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:23,243
can we stop talking
about Isis?

1996
01:31:23,245 --> 01:31:25,879
Cervantes was captured
by barbary pirates

1997
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:28,448
and taken to Algiers
and there was a price
on his head.

1998
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:32,118
And when the ransom
was paid, he let his
brother go instead of him.

1999
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,687
- Is that true?
- That is true.

2000
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:35,856
He let his brother go
when he could've gone?

2001
01:31:35,858 --> 01:31:37,257
- Yeah.
- Wow.

2002
01:31:37,259 --> 01:31:38,391
I know.

2003
01:31:38,393 --> 01:31:39,993
Not sure I'd do that.
Would you do that?

2004
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:42,963
- Let your brother go?
- Uh, probably not.

2005
01:31:42,965 --> 01:31:44,364
<i> No, I don't think</i>
<i> I would either</i>

2006
01:31:44,366 --> 01:31:46,466
even with the best one
in the world.

2007
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:49,069
I think if my child
was there, they could
take my child.

2008
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:51,838
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
- I'd let any child go.

2009
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,307
- Any child?
- Any child.

2010
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:56,676
As long as it,
you know, I mean..
Not, not any child.

2011
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,979
I mean, they'd have to be
worth the effort.

2012
01:31:58,981 --> 01:32:02,115
Well, cervantes,
when he tried to escape,
he was captured.

2013
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:04,017
He had a noose
around his neck,
he was taken to Hassan

2014
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:05,519
the leader of Algiers

2015
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:09,322
and he became his lover to
literally save his neck.

2016
01:32:09,324 --> 01:32:10,490
- Bum or neck?
- Yeah.

2017
01:32:10,492 --> 01:32:11,958
If that's what
it comes down to, yes.

2018
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,928
-<i> Life or bum.</i>
- Well, either way,
you're buggered.

2019
01:32:15,964 --> 01:32:18,465
Let me say now, I'm in.
I -- I, uh --

2020
01:32:18,467 --> 01:32:20,901
- really?
- He's in, rather.
He's in.

2021
01:32:20,903 --> 01:32:23,737
Ah, but they became
lovers, so it'd be
in out, in out.

2022
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:25,171
-<i> All --</i>
- see that ferry?

2023
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:28,408
- Yeah.
- That's the ferry
for Africa.

2024
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:29,809
-<i> Really?</i>
- Hm.

2025
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:38,652
<i> Yeah, it's always good to</i>
<i> say goodbye in the mist</i>

2026
01:32:38,654 --> 01:32:41,688
like, uh, the end
of "Casablanca."

2027
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:45,725
Could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

2028
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,527
Could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

2029
01:32:47,529 --> 01:32:49,296
- Could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.
- You gotta get the depth.

2030
01:32:49,298 --> 01:32:51,331
I got the depth
right there.

2031
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:55,235
<i> Look at that</i>
<i> mystical city.</i>

2032
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:03,410
Right. I'm gonna make
a move. Um, early flight.

2033
01:33:03,412 --> 01:33:06,012
- Okay.
- Yeah. Me, too, actually.

2034
01:33:06,014 --> 01:33:09,583
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm. Oh.

2035
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:12,085
- We say our goodbyes now.
- Okay, okay.

2036
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:13,453
Yeah. Sure you're gonna
be alright?

2037
01:33:13,455 --> 01:33:15,822
- Yeah. Yeah, no,
it's, uh..
- Okay.

2038
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:17,591
I'm gonna look
forward to this week,
writing and --

2039
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:20,293
- alright, good.
- What have you, you know?

2040
01:33:20,295 --> 01:33:22,495
Hey, what can we say?

2041
01:33:22,497 --> 01:33:24,731
- It's been a week.
-<i> It has.</i>

2042
01:33:24,733 --> 01:33:27,167
And I'll see you..

2043
01:33:27,169 --> 01:33:29,569
In another country.

2044
01:33:29,571 --> 01:33:30,971
- <i> In the future.</i>
<i>- Yeah, in the future.</i>

2045
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:32,973
- <i> Have fun now.</i>
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

2046
01:33:32,975 --> 01:33:34,808
Bye.

2047
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:36,443
Now I disappear
into the mist.

2048
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:40,413
Could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

2049
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,472
-<i> Buenos dias.</i>
- Hi.

2050
01:34:39,474 --> 01:34:41,107
- Oh, you're English.
- Yeah.

2051
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:43,810
My name's ambrose.
I'm the son
of the owners here.

2052
01:34:43,812 --> 01:34:45,011
Oh, right. Great, great.

2053
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:46,079
Hey, can I help you
with your bags?

2054
01:34:46,081 --> 01:34:47,447
Yeah, sure.

2055
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:52,452
So, this will be
your room.

2056
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:54,421
Oh, this is great, yeah.
Very cozy.

2057
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:59,325
Now we thought
there were going to be
two of you, but..

2058
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:02,228
Yeah, my son, uh,
was gonna come, but he,
he couldn't make it.

2059
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:03,963
Oh, well.

2060
01:35:03,965 --> 01:35:05,498
Right. Well,
I'll leave you now.

2061
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,434
Okay. How -- how old
are you, by the way?

2062
01:35:07,436 --> 01:35:09,903
- Seventeen.
- Oh.

2063
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:11,104
Well, okay.
Thank you.

2064
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:13,139
- Yeah.
- Thanks, ambrose.

2065
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:26,920
- <i> Guess who it is.</i>
<i>- Hey!</i>

2066
01:35:26,922 --> 01:35:28,788
<i> How -- how's it been?</i>

2067
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:31,057
- It was good.
-<i> Yeah?</i>

2068
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,859
-<i> Where's the team?</i>
<i> Hiya.</i>
- We're all here.

2069
01:35:32,861 --> 01:35:34,260
- Oh.
- Where are you?

2070
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:35,261
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

2071
01:35:35,263 --> 01:35:37,197
- Oh. We missed you.
- Come on.

2072
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:40,400
- Daddy.
-<i> Come on.</i>

2073
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:44,738
- <i> How's my girl?</i>
<i>- Good.</i>

2074
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:45,839
- <i> You good?</i>
<i>- Good.</i>

2075
01:35:45,841 --> 01:35:47,741
- Who's your
favorite parent?
- You.

2076
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:50,844
- Yay!
- Thanks. Okay.

2077
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:53,346
- <i> Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

2078
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:55,982
<i> How are you?</i>

2079
01:35:55,984 --> 01:35:58,451
- I'm good.
- Where are you?

2080
01:35:58,453 --> 01:36:01,321
I'm in, uh, andalucia

2081
01:36:01,323 --> 01:36:04,023
in -- in the mountains.
It's great.

2082
01:36:04,025 --> 01:36:05,925
Is Joe there?

2083
01:36:05,927 --> 01:36:09,596
No, he's not, no.
Look, you should come
out here.

2084
01:36:09,598 --> 01:36:11,765
I can't.

2085
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:13,566
Why not?
What is it, work?

2086
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,101
I just can't.

2087
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:17,904
Why, why not?

2088
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:21,441
I'm pregnant.

2089
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:25,478
- What?
-<i> Yeah, I know</i>
<i> it's stupid.</i>

2090
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:30,316
Well, is it mine?

2091
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:33,386
No.

2092
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:40,727
- Is it Adam's?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

2093
01:36:41,695 --> 01:36:43,296
<i> Are you sure?</i>

2094
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:46,132
Pretty sure.

2095
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:49,269
I thought you weren't
sleeping with him
anymore.

2096
01:36:49,271 --> 01:36:52,505
Look, I gotta go.
He's waiting
for me downstairs.

2097
01:36:52,507 --> 01:36:54,841
What, what,
he's back in New York?

2098
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:59,312
Yeah.
Look, I gotta go.

2099
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:02,015
I'm sorry.
Take care.

2100
01:37:18,533 --> 01:37:20,934
It's the number one song
in the charts.

2101
01:37:20,936 --> 01:37:22,468
<i> "Turtle on your head."</i>

2102
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:23,903
I thought Charlie
was gonna be in bed.

2103
01:37:23,905 --> 01:37:25,905
Well, technically,
he's in bed now.
Aren't you, Charlie?

2104
01:37:25,907 --> 01:37:27,473
- Yeah, he's in his bed.
- 'Cause dinner's ready.

2105
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:34,848
Uh..

2106
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:36,115
No, no<i> esta noche.</i>

2107
01:37:36,117 --> 01:37:37,984
- <i> Muy bien.</i>
<i>- Soy no muy hambriento.</i>

2108
01:37:37,986 --> 01:37:39,552
<i> Muy bien, gracias.</i>

2109
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:46,159
- Mm.
- Oh, I've missed you.

2110
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:48,795
Mm. I've missed you too.

2111
01:37:48,797 --> 01:37:51,798
But now he was back
and there's no reason

2112
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,134
that we can't resume
hostilities..

2113
01:37:56,203 --> 01:38:00,373
...as we did
before he left.

2114
01:38:02,077 --> 01:38:03,843
- Oh, god.
- Right.

2115
01:38:03,845 --> 01:38:05,645
- That's you, not me.
- No, it's your turn.

2116
01:38:05,647 --> 01:38:07,080
- You can climb over.
- I..

2117
01:38:07,082 --> 01:38:08,414
- Come on.
- I've been doing it
all week.

2118
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:10,216
I've been away
for a week.

2119
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,289
Quickly, and then
we can get back
to what we were doing.

2120
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:18,591
Oh, no,
the moment's gone.
You can forget that.

2121
01:38:18,593 --> 01:38:20,493
I might've fallen
asleep.

2122
01:38:20,495 --> 01:38:23,096
<i> What's the matter?</i>
<i> Did you drop him?</i>

2123
01:38:23,098 --> 01:38:24,864
Have you
dropped him, eh?

2124
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:27,400
Did you want him?
Yes.

2125
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,409
The dragon looked back
from the top
of the castle.

2126
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:39,479
He said,
"i think
you're scared of me.

2127
01:38:39,481 --> 01:38:43,049
I'm the biggest dragon
in the whole world."

2128
01:38:43,051 --> 01:38:45,685
- It's gonna
turn orange, isn't it?
- Yeah.

2129
01:38:45,687 --> 01:38:47,520
Right, darling,
have a gorgeous day.

2130
01:38:47,522 --> 01:38:50,323
Mommy's picking you up,
okay? But I'll be home
when you get back.

2131
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,726
- Love you.
- Bye.

2132
01:38:53,728 --> 01:38:54,894
See ya,
have a good day.

2133
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:36,769
<i> Hey, Joe.</i>
<i> It's dad. Um..</i>

2134
01:39:36,771 --> 01:39:39,272
I hope things are okay.
Uh, call me.

2135
01:39:39,274 --> 01:39:43,009
Let's, uh...Touch base.

2136
01:39:43,011 --> 01:39:44,444
Tell me
what's going on.

2137
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:27,720
Hello. Hey!
How you doing?

2138
01:40:27,722 --> 01:40:28,855
Where are you?
It's noisy.

2139
01:40:28,857 --> 01:40:30,690
I thought you were
in the mountains.

2140
01:40:30,692 --> 01:40:33,659
It's just
the streets here
in malaga, you know?

2141
01:40:34,762 --> 01:40:36,362
You're not in a bar,
are you?

2142
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:39,832
No, I'm not in a bar.
No, no.
Hey, listen, uh..

2143
01:40:39,834 --> 01:40:42,668
Okay, so, I'm calling
because, uh..

2144
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:46,005
...um, I want
to be with you.

2145
01:40:47,808 --> 01:40:49,709
- I know but --
- I don't care
about the baby.

2146
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:50,910
I mean, I do care
about the baby.

2147
01:40:50,912 --> 01:40:52,078
What I mean is,
uh -- uh..

2148
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,280
Yeah, I'll, I -- I..

2149
01:40:54,282 --> 01:40:56,416
I -- I'll bring it up
with you, you know?

2150
01:40:56,418 --> 01:40:59,719
We can raise it
together.
Uh, it'll have two dads.

2151
01:40:59,721 --> 01:41:02,321
Lots of people do that.

2152
01:41:02,323 --> 01:41:04,157
Yeah, lots of gay men.

2153
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,025
So it'll have, like,
two dads and one mom.

2154
01:41:06,027 --> 01:41:09,095
That's...It'll be
a lucky kid.

2155
01:41:09,097 --> 01:41:11,764
I don't know.
I'm in New York,
you're in London --

2156
01:41:11,766 --> 01:41:13,933
I'll move to New York.
I love New York.

2157
01:41:13,935 --> 01:41:14,967
You know that.
It -- it's..

2158
01:41:17,338 --> 01:41:19,572
-<i> Why, why don't you</i>
<i> come out?</i>
- I don't know.

2159
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:20,606
Come out.
And tell you what?

2160
01:41:20,608 --> 01:41:22,408
We can go
to the atlas mountains.

2161
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:25,711
Hey, do you remember
that hotel
that you really like?

2162
01:41:25,713 --> 01:41:28,881
<i> It's, I mean,</i>
<i> I can get the ferry</i>
<i> from here and, uh..</i>

2163
01:41:28,883 --> 01:41:31,517
You know, I can
almost see Africa
from here.

2164
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:35,314
Ah..

2165
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,767
Oh.

2166
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,651
Hello.

2167
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,987
Nice surprise.

2168
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:19,058
You're here already.

2169
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:21,093
<i> I've been waiting</i>
<i> for you.</i>

2170
01:43:24,398 --> 01:43:26,199
I've missed you.

2171
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,800
I missed you.

2172
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:32,772
<i> I love you.</i>

2173
01:43:58,466 --> 01:44:00,099
Oh, fuck.

2174
01:44:26,628 --> 01:44:27,960
Hello?

2175
01:44:27,962 --> 01:44:30,229
-<i> Oh, hello, rob?</i>
- Hiya. Emma?

2176
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:33,399
Uh, I was just wondering.
Have you heard
from Steve?

2177
01:44:33,401 --> 01:44:35,401
No.
Why, should I?

2178
01:44:35,403 --> 01:44:36,469
He's checked out
of the hotel

2179
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:38,404
and I -- I don't know
where he is.

2180
01:44:38,406 --> 01:44:40,773
Is he lost in la mancha?

2181
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:43,175
Yeah, he's normally
on the phone to me
ten times a day

2182
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:45,111
which is why
I'm a bit worried.

2183
01:44:45,113 --> 01:44:48,114
He'll be sitting
somewhere
talking to a nun

2184
01:44:48,116 --> 01:44:51,550
and asking
if she's heard
of judi dench.

2185
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:36,028
<i> Allahu akbar!</i>
<i> Allahu akbar!</i>
