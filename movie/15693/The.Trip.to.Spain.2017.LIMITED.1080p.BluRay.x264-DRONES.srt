00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,001
- Well, tell me this.

853
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,365
Why have they changed the name

854
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:15,039
of a Brontosaurus to a Brachiosaurus?

855
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,880
No one else have given me

856
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,848
- an adequate explanation.
- Brontosaurus which would

857
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:20,319
previously roam the lands.

858
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,284
- Who's that?
- It's John Hurt.

859
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:23,359
- That's not John Hurt.

860
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,200
- Who is it then?

861
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:25,565
- I don't know, but if
you're gonna do John Hurt,

862
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:26,879
you have to, um...

863
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,441
The Brachiosaurus would
once roam the land,

864
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,279
the king of all it surveyed.

865
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,770
- That's a very good John Hurt.

866
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:37,922
- King of all he surveyed.

867
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,041
It's a combination of him as

868
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,039
Quentin Crisp and Caligula in I, Claudius.

869
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,769
- Why are you standing?
- You can go away now, Rob.

870
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,890
I was thinking of killing
you, but I've changed my mind.

871
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,479
So does Chloe know
about the different, uh,

872
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,766
prehistoric periods.

873
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,159
- [ROB] Yep-

874
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,599
Well, you know, she, not to where

875
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,762
- she could sit an exam.
- Does she know Triassic,

876
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,489
Jurassic, Cretaceous?

877
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,803
- [ROB] She knows some of
those, she knows the words.

878
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:13,399
I'm not gonna pretend that
she could give a lecture.

879
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,165
- Of course in the Triassic period

880
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,879
the world is one land
mass, just with the sea,

881
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,924
and that was it, one body of land.

882
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,684
And in the Jurassic period,

883
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:29,239
split into two big lumps of land.

884
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,368
And then finally the Cretaceous,

885
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:34,999
it broke off into the
continents that we know today.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

887
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,491
- Oh, look there.

888
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,479
The actual footprints.

889
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,084
- [STEVE] They're big aren't they?

890
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:47,159
What size are your feet?

891
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
- Seven.

892
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,726
- Really?
- Yeah.

893
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,486
- Go on, then, off you go.

894
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:56,159
- No, it's just that is quite feminine.

895
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,685
- They're too small.
- Quite feminine.

896
00:37:57,686 --> 00:37:59,123
- They are feminine, I know.

897
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:01,042
- I'm not gonna be...
- Small feet.

898
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:03,359
Nice on a woman but weird on a bloke.

899
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
- Indeed.

900
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,479
If I could change one thing about me,

901
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,527
well, it wouldn't be the feet,

902
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:12,119
but I would get to the feet quite soon.

903
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,884
- It'd be feet, height,
and hair, wouldn't it?

904
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:15,405
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- Do you want some more wine.

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,439
Mm, mm.

918
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,519

David Bowie's death was like,

924
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:11,401
what did Tony Visconti say?

925
00:39:11,402 --> 00:39:13,679
It was an artistic actor's death.

926
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,489
- What he did was remarkable.
- He just disappeared.

927
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,641
No funeral, he literally just went fshoo.

928
00:39:17,642 --> 00:39:19,759
- Had a song called
Lazarus on his last record.

929
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,649
- Yeah, it was wonderful,
it was actually brilliant.

930
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,359
- Yeah, it was, it was admirable.

931
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,124
Told you about the time
he was on the radio,

932
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,122
and, uh, he wanted to mention me,

933
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:30,239
but couldn't remember my name.

934
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,048
- Really?

935
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:32,565
- Mm, he was being interviewed,

936
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:34,799
and, uh, the interviewer said,

937
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,600
what do you do when
you're on tour on the bus?

938
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,319
And he said he watched Cruise
of the Gods that we did.

939
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,606
And he said, you know, the one that,

940
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:45,559
it stars that guy.

941
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,400
- And he said, who?
- Really?

942
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:47,208
- Yeah, he said, who?

943
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:49,926
And I was in the kitchen,
and I, oh, what, my god,

944
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:51,519
he's about to mention me, David Bowie.

945
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,360
- Sure he didn't mean me?

946
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:53,247
- No, no, no, no, because he said,

947
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:55,604
you know, the one from Marion and Geoff.

948
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:56,639
- Really?
- Yes.

949
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,482
- He said Marion and Geoff?
- Yes.

950
00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:59,524
- Wow.
- And I was going it's me!

951
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:01,363
And the interviewer was going,

952
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:03,759
Oh, I don't know, I don't know.

953
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,330
So he never said my name.

954
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:08,559
But he was thinking of
my face at that moment.

955
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,919
And when he died, I looked
at has Twitter feed,

956
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,967
and do you know what, Steve?

957
00:40:12,968 --> 00:40:15,088
He followed me on Twitter.

958
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,920
- Really?

959
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:19,082
- You don't know what to do
with that information, do you?

- Well, no disrespect to you,

961
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:23,679
but he's just ever so slightly,

962
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,319
I mean, microscopically
diminished in my mind.

963

- Just think, and I know
you won't like this,

there remained a time when he sat there

1013
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:52,128
They're totally on board for this film.

1014
00:42:52,129 --> 00:42:54,119
- Fantastic, great.
- Yeah?

1015
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,042
- What's the catch?

1016
00:42:55,043 --> 00:42:59,319
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah, uh, they
want to bring a new writer on.

1017
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,240
- What?

1018
00:43:00,241 --> 00:43:01,321
- [JONATHAN] Well, it's for a polish,

1019
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:03,002
it's just for a polish, it's...

1020
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:04,406
- Hey, how are we doing?

1021
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:05,731
- [SALLY] Hello, how are you?

1022
00:43:05,732 --> 00:43:07,679
- Yeah, really good.

1023
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,559
Ah, oh, where'd you get that?

1024
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,721
- [CHLOE] I found out here.

1025
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,166
- I thought you'd lost that,
I thought I'd hidden it.

1026
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:15,719
Who?

1027
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,243
- [JONATHAN] Ed Hirsch.

1028
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:18,439
- I don't, who's he?

1029
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,280
Never heard of him.

1030
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:20,086
What's he clone?

1031
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:21,366
- He's written a few
scripts that have really

1032
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:22,771
just gotten a lot of heat.

1033
00:43:22,772 --> 00:43:23,999
- Look over here!

1034
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,119
Charlie, I'm here, look!

1035
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,882
A little fella that...

1036
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:28,243
- Uh.
- There, hello.

1037
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:31,289
- [JONATHAN] He's new, he's
hot, he's up and coming.

1038
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,279
- (STAMMERING) I've got
two Oscar nominations.

1039
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,279
I'm new, and I'm not up
and coming, I've arrived.

1040
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,879
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

(SIGHING)

1042
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
[ROB] Oh.

1043
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,559
- Good evening.

1044
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,559
- Good evening.
- Buenos tardes.

1045
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,959
Isn't it a magnificent room?

1046
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,639
- It's the Brando room.

1047
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,999
I just watched a little
clip on YouTube of him.

1048
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,839
You can't really work up
exactly where they are.

1049
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,479
He's very overweight at that stage.

1050
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,479
- Yeah, which is fine for Torquemada.

1051
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,879
Gives him presence.

1052
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,319
- I'm gonna be playing Torquemada

1053
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,079
from the Spanish Inquisition.

1054
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,479
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

1055
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,959
- Nobody does.
- Amongst our weaponry

1056
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,639
are such diverse elements
as fear, surprise,

1057
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,607
a ruthless efficiency,

1058
00:44:26,608 --> 00:44:28,841
and an almost fanatical
devotion to the pope.

1059
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:30,959
And nice red uniforms.

1060
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,599
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

1061

Amongst our weaponry is fear, surprise,

and an almost fanatical
devotion to the pope.

1064
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:45,083
- You're doing him in The Godfather.

1065
00:44:45,084 --> 00:44:46,159
- Huh.
- You're just doing Marlon

1066
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,208
- Brando in The Godfather.
- Just doing '70's Brando.

1067
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:50,484
And it was more like this,
and, like, kinda nasally.

1068
00:44:50,485 --> 00:44:52,528
- You know what, his
voice was a little higher,

1069
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:53,799
the way he spoke.

1070
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,359
It was, you know, it
was like that, you know?

1071
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,519
- You've got a De Niro thing.
- When he spoke to people.

1072
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,759
- Why are you doing your De Niro.

1073
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,523
- If I was going De Niro, I'd
do it like that, you know?

1074
00:45:03,524 --> 00:45:04,846
That's the way, (INHALES)

1075
00:45:04,847 --> 00:45:06,559
that's the way De Niro spoke, you know?

1076
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,402
- That's good.
- Let's do something

1077
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:08,439
about that, you know?

1078
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,282
That's right, you know what I'm' gonna do?

1079
00:45:09,283 --> 00:45:10,439
I'm gonna rip your head off,

1080
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,726
shit down your goddam fuckin' neck,

1081
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:14,041
you two-bit, dick-suckin',
motherfuckin' asshole.

1082
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:15,519
- That's terrific, that's terrific.

1083
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,361
- Yeah, well, the reason
you think I'm doing De Niro

1084
00:45:17,362 --> 00:45:19,044
when I'm doing Brando, is
because De Niro himself

1085
00:45:19,045 --> 00:45:21,079
was influenced by Brando.

1086
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,479
So when De Niro acts,

1087
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,119
you see residual elements of Brando

1088
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,009
in what he does, so you've
got it the wrong way around.

1089
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,284
- So in attempting to criticize you,

1090
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:33,085
I've inadvertently complimented you.

1091
00:45:33,086 --> 00:45:34,762
- You've shown up some of the detail...

1092
00:45:34,763 --> 00:45:38,526
- You shall only come out on
top in this exchange, then.

1093
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,559
- (SIGHS) I'm only telling you the truth.

1094
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,479
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

1095
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,239
And nobody expects a comfy chair.

1096
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,527
- No, he's gotta do the, get

1097
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,759
(SIGHS) the comfy chair.

1098
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,524
- Get the comfy chair.

1099
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,439
I'm like a turtle, look at me.

1100
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,719
- (SCOFFS) Get the comfy chair.

1101
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,839
- Get the comfy chair
and a piece of lettuce.

1102
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,239
I'm gettin' hungry.

1103
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,359
Amongst our weaponry is
such diverse I, to me,

1104
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,249
- Woody Allen.
- Woody Allen, yeah.

1105
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,404
- Yeah, amongst our weaponry
is such diverse elements as

1106
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,005
fear, surprise,

1107
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,571
and an almost fanatical
devotion to the Yankees.

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
- No.

1112
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,119
- You know all Jews were
told to leave the country

1113
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,799
by order of the Catholic king and queen.

1114
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,039
- Yes, but, I'm, I'm not a Jew.

I'm a Catholic, Roman Catholic.

- If you're Catholic, then
you must respect my authority.

1117
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,123
My authority comes from the pope.

1118

- I've met the pope.

1119
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,639
What it was, I met the
pope, I met His Holiness

1120
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,839
at the Vatican, and he saw a film I made.

1121
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,285
- You're lying.
- I'm telling the truth.

1122
00:47:19,286 --> 00:47:21,404
All right, all right,
he didn't see the film,

1123
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:25,007
his advisors did, and they gave
him a breakdown of the film,

1124
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,570
and he approved it.

1125
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,519
- You're, um, a heretic?

1126
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,639

- I'll be too old.
- That's ridiculous.

1169
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:10,761
- I know.
- 55?

1170
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,522
That's ridiculous.

1171
00:49:12,523 --> 00:49:15,043
- Why can you not whitewater raft at 55?

1172
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:17,324
I might get some fake ID
or something like that.

1173
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:19,891

fake ID like a teenager.

1174

1175

uh, tongue-and-groove,

1180
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,046
what kind of wood do you choose,

1181
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,884
if you want it to weather
into a nice silvery patina?

1182
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:42,291
Ash, beech, teak?

1183
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,691
Simple question.

1184
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,880
You'll have to hurry.

1185
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:48,881
There's other people that want to get on

1186
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:50,319
this whitewater raft.

1187
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,559
- Um, could you tell me the woods again?

1188
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,039
- Ash, teak, beech.

1189
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,008
- Ash, teak, beech?
- Mm.

1190
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,759
- Beech.

1191
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,879
- No, mate, it's teak.

1192
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,281
Any carpenter worth his
salt'll tell you that.

1193

- Don't cry, Charlie.

1194
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,963
- You're not, you're
not a carpenter, mate.

1195
00:50:06,964 --> 00:50:07,800

- On your way.

Maybe Mommy can take you.

1202
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:19,959

- How old are you?

1203
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,599
- I'm 56.

1204
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,759
- Oh, for Christ's sake,
go on, on your, get on.

1205
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,171
- Just, oh, please.
- Thanks, so, oh!

1206
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:27,319
Oh, I've got shooting pains down my arm.

1207
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,207
- Well, don't tell me that.

1208
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,487
I've just broken the
rules for you, you nob.

1210
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,879
All right, thank you.

1211
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,881
Come on, Charlie.

1212
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:37,245
Not so fast, son.

1213
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,679
- [STEVE] You know when walking downhill,

1214
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,602
it'd be good if you engage your abs.

1215
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:45,803
- [ROB] Yeah, course.

1216
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:48,610
- [STEVE] And if you
engage your abdominals,

1217
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:51,079
it takes the pressure off your knees.

1218
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,762
- [ROB] Who told you that?

1219
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:55,399
- It's just that you can
feel it anatomically.

1220
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,322
I figured it out.

1221
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:58,399
- Well at least stand up
to a focus group with it.

1222
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,604
- Well you wouldn't show
it to a focus group.

1223
00:50:59,605 --> 00:51:01,441
- Clinical trials, I wouldn't
send it to clinical trials.

1224
00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:02,771
- Exactly, they won't
show it to a focus group.

1225
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:04,487
- Clinical trials, that's
why I said clinical trials.

1226
00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:06,084
- Oh, okay, yeah, you
don't need clinical trials.

1227
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:08,683
If you listen to your
body, you'll figure it out.

1228
00:51:08,684 --> 00:51:09,966
It's like a shock absorber,

1229
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:14,319
so the knee doesn't have
to take all the impact.

Wow.

There, look.

1238
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,049
Why would they have the two
of them in one exhibition.

1239
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,079
- Ah, they both died in the same year.

1240
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,845
It seems they've done
a very good repair job.

Can't see any damage.

1242

part of it that got damaged.

00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,085
and you can't get down there.

1323
00:55:38,086 --> 00:55:39,241
It can only go up there.

1324
00:55:39,242 --> 00:55:41,321
He's gotten down, so do him properly.

1325
00:55:41,322 --> 00:55:43,399
- You saying I can't get down there.

1326
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,763
You're seriously saying
I can't get down there.

1327
00:55:44,764 --> 00:55:46,091
- No, let's stop, but
don't just say anything

1328
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,570
about Mick Jagger.

1329
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,282
Ah.

00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:06,600
- Si, si.

00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:07,647
- Ha-ha-ha-hah.
- I like wine.

1335
00:56:07,648 --> 00:56:09,051
No spoon or fork.

Muchas gracias.

- [SERVER] Uh-huh.

1338
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,764
- So, George Orwell came
over to Spain in 1936.

1339
00:56:19,765 --> 00:56:20,959
- Oh.

1340
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,759
One year after the birth of Elvis.

1341
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,999
- He came out to Barcelona with his wife.

1342
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,840
- With his wife.

1343
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:27,680
- She stayed there,

1344
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:28,839
- when he went to...
- Mini-break.

1345
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,680
She stayed there,

1346
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:30,520
- when he went to...
- It's a good place

1347
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:31,442
for a mini-break.

1348
00:56:31,443 --> 00:56:33,599
Is that what they were doing?

1349
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,519
Were they able to do that in those clays?

1350
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,488
- Do you want to learn anything
about the Civil War at all,

1351
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:39,199
or do you think it's like, I just think,

1352
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,725
no, I don't really give a
damn about the Civil War.

1353
00:56:40,726 --> 00:56:42,359
Not that interested in it.

1354
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,599
- I want to learn something
about the Civil War.

1355
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,161
- Okay, so he came out to
Barcelona, left his wife there,

1356
00:56:47,162 --> 00:56:49,683
went off to the front
to fight, 50 miles away.

1357
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:51,569
When he came back, he was so disillusioned

1358
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,999
with the intellectuals who
were back in Barcelona,

1359
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,729
when he went back there, he saw them all.

1360
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,399
They'd become bourgeois.

1361
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,763
They'd lost sight of their ideals.

1362
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:02,762
He said they were eating fancy
food in posh restaurants.

1363
00:57:02,763 --> 00:57:04,884
So he went back to the front one more time

1364
00:57:04,885 --> 00:57:06,723
and eventually got shot in the throat.

1365
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:08,799
Couldn't speak for six months.

1366
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,247
- Where's a bullet to the
throat when you need one?

1367
00:57:12,248 --> 00:57:15,483
I don't think if I were to say to Sally,

1368
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,081
I'm going off to fight, she
wouldn't stand there, just say,

1369
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:21,481
all right, you're going off to be killed.

1370
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:23,279
- Yeah, or kill.

1371
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,559
- That's a very good point,

1372
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,083
'cause that's something
else I couldn't do.

1373
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:27,842
- I wouldn't fight in a
war 'cause I've got kids.

1374
00:57:27,843 --> 00:57:28,727
- I got kids.

1375
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:31,559
- Yeah, but if I didn't
have kids, I think I would

1376
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,400
- be up for that.
- I don't think you would.

1377
00:57:32,401 --> 00:57:33,240
- I think I would.

1378
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,319
- I think you'd like to think you would,

1379
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,160
but I don't think you would.

1380
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:36,284
You could go and entertain the troops.

1381
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:37,884
You could go and do Alan
Partridge for the troops,

1382
00:57:37,885 --> 00:57:39,679
that's what you would do.

1383
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,001
And all these proper men, who
are giving over everything,

1384
00:57:42,002 --> 00:57:44,443
would love as you came out and went ah-ha.

1385
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:47,205
You know what I'd love, if a
sniper got you at that moment.

1386
00:57:47,206 --> 00:57:48,519
Ah-ugh.

1387
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,681
You didn't even finish the ah-ha.

1388
00:57:49,682 --> 00:57:51,199
You'd only got to ah.

1389
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,999
- I'd do that hah as my dying breath.

1390
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,204
- I don't think you would.
- I would.

1391
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,006
- No, you wouldn't.
- Ah, (IMITATES BULLET HIT).

1392
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:57,081
- If it was to the head, you idiot.

1393
00:57:57,082 --> 00:57:58,603
- Ah, (IMITATES BULLET HIT), ha.

1394
00:57:58,604 --> 00:57:59,803
- You wouldn't say ah-ha.

1395
00:57:59,804 --> 00:58:00,926
- I'd get the ha out.

1396
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:02,559
- There'd be no ha.

1397
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,324
And I'd say, if Steve were here now,

1398
00:58:04,325 --> 00:58:06,199
I know what he'd say, ha...

1399
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
- Ha.
- Hm.

- How are you, how's it going?

- [STEVE] Doing very well, yes.

- Good, good, how's Rob doing?

going very well, indeed.

that's why I'm being nice.

- Hiya, how are you?

1411
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,079

I'm calling to remind you

that I'm coming out to see you tomorrow.

[BOTH] Yay.

- Thank god, I'm at a breaking point.

1415

- Oh, wow, okay, great, and
I'm bringing Yolanda with me.

1416
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,358
Due to the fact that
it's the New York Times?

- And the Observer

1419

- I just want to remind
you, that they do want you

to dress up as Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza, okay?

- What a surprise.

- Which one am I?

00:58:56,045 --> 00:58:57,642

- Hi, Steve, how are you?

- I've been better.

1450
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:19,399
Do you know they brought a new
writer on to rewrite Missing?

1451

- Yeah, but it's nothing,
it's just, it's standard.

01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:23,803
Just for a polish, that's all.

uh, with Steve Coogan.

yeah, yeah, good, good.

- Is this the Matt that's Steve's agent?

1456
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:37,439
- Yeah, it is, well, no, I
mean, I've left the agency.

Uh, last film I wrote had four
Academy Award nominations.

I've already up and come.

you have, Steve, you have.

- Look, lemme cut to the
chase, I saw you in the

- Horseman.

- The Huntsman, saw you in The Huntsman.

Thought you were fantastic, man.

I mean, really, you burnt up the screen.

You've got it, that little

The screen loves you, but you
were being underused there.

- Well, I did, I did
The Huntsman with him.

1476
01:01:19,962 --> 01:01:21,166
- This is what I'm saying.

1477
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:24,919
You should be doing what
James Corden is doing.

1478
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,524
You know, he's the biggest thing on TV.

1479
01:01:26,525 --> 01:01:30,039
- I was with James in Gavin & Stacey.

1480
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,639
- I heard about that, it was
supposed to be fantastic.

1481
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,449
I, I, uh, missed it, but
I'll definitely get a copy.

1482
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,807
You know, you should
be the new Simon Pegg.

1483
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:40,159
You should be, you could be, you will be

1484
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,759
the new Ricky Gervais.

1485
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,725
- Oh, gosh, well, Ricky,
that's what we all dream of.

01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:46,126
- What does Jeff think of this?

1487
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:47,323
- Jeff's fine with it.

1488
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:49,684
Jeff's very busy doing another
screenplay for Fox, so he...

1489
01:01:49,685 --> 01:01:51,959
- What script is Jeff doing for Fox?

1490
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,800
I didn't know that.

1491
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:54,325
- [GREG] The script for George Clooney.

1492
01:01:54,326 --> 01:01:55,799
- The George Clooney?

1493
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,685
Right, okay, I had no idea about that.

1494
01:01:57,686 --> 01:01:59,804
Another thing I had no idea about.

1495
01:01:59,805 --> 01:02:01,722
- [MATT] Have you ever done any hosting?

1496
01:02:01,723 --> 01:02:03,688
You know, the awards ceremonies?

1497
01:02:03,689 --> 01:02:05,719
- I hosted the LA BAFTAs once.

1498
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,879
- The what?

1499
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,439
They have LA BAFTAs?

1500
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,766
Who do they give those to?

1501
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:12,479
Listen, never mind, you should
be hosting the Golden Globes.

1502
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,719
This is what I'm talkin' about.

1503
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,559
- It's my script, I wrote
it, well I co-wrote it,

1504
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,445
I'm producing it, I'm gonna star in it,

other fuckin' posh twat.

1507
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:27,839
this will be the best
phone call you've ever had.

1508
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,762
- Yes.

1509
01:02:28,763 --> 01:02:29,839
- It's my film, okay?

1510
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,680
- [GREG] Of course it is.

1511
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:31,488
- That's what it's going to be.

1512
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:32,811
Good, thank you.

1519
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,399
- You know that, uh, Cuenca
was one of the last places

1520
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,519
to fall to the Fascists in the Civil War

1521
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,759
on March the 29th, 1939.

1522
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,645
- Terrific position,
it's up on the hilltop,

1523
01:03:16,646 --> 01:03:19,562
so very difficult to attack,
and very easy to defend.

1524
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:21,403
- Yeah, and they may
very well have held out,

1525
01:03:21,404 --> 01:03:24,399
if it weren't for the fact that the army,

01:03:25,524 --> 01:03:27,282
turned against the Socialist government.

1528
01:03:27,283 --> 01:03:30,639
If it weren't for that Franco
may have well not have won.

- Oh, yeah, sorry, fellas, take care.

us, if you want, though.

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

- You sure?

1535
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:39,965
- [STEVE] Yeah, have a beer.

- That'd be lovely.

near acquaintances, maybe.

Oh, right?

1549
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,839
- I'm writing a book about my, um,

1550
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,799
sort of travel through Spain.

1551

when I was a younger man.

1553
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:12,959
It's kind of a little bit
inspired by Laurie Lee,

1554
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,599
you know, When I Walked Out One

Cheers.

- [MUSICIAN] Cheers,
mate, yeah, I love Laurie.

1559
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,443
- That's part of the reason
when I saw you buskin' there,

1560
01:04:21,444 --> 01:04:23,202
I thought this is our Laurie Lee,

1561
01:04:23,203 --> 01:04:24,839
'cause he paid his way through Spain

1562
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,680
by doing the same thing.

1563
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:27,170
- With a violin, yeah.
- Yeah, that's right.

1564
01:04:27,171 --> 01:04:28,559
- Yeah, right on.

1565
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,919
So you guys staying in Cuenca long?

- One day in every place.

1567
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:33,568
I'm writing restaurant reviews,

1568
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,479
so we go to one town, we're there a clay,

1569
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,322
and then we go on.

1570
01:04:36,323 --> 01:04:38,639
- Oh, have you been in
San Sebastian for food.

1571
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,005
It's the best place in Spain for food

1572
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:41,398
- by a country mile.
- Yeah, I know.

1573
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,684
- We were near there in Santander,

1574
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:43,602
- weren't we?
- Yeah.

1575
01:04:43,603 --> 01:04:45,119
- Or Catalonia, not just Barcelona.

1576
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,199
The food there's excellent, yeah.

1577
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,087
- No.
- Yeah.

1578
01:04:47,088 --> 01:04:48,639
Well, we just (STAMMERING)

1579
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,085
we were gonna go there, we just thought

1580
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,241
it was a bit too obvious.

1581
01:04:51,242 --> 01:04:53,843
We're trying to do stuff
that's a little bit, kind of,

1582
01:04:53,844 --> 01:04:55,519
the kind of nooks and crannies,

1583
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,931
slightly off the beaten track a little.

1584
01:04:56,932 --> 01:04:58,919
- Like Sanlucar, near Cadiz.

1585
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,886
The tuna there is absolutely
bang-on, I love that.

1586
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:01,722
- [STEVE] Yeah, I know, yeah.

1587
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:03,721
It's more like the culture than the food,

1588
01:05:03,722 --> 01:05:04,999
although food's part of it,

1589
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,490
but it's more like the
kind of culture, I suppose.

1590
01:05:06,491 --> 01:05:10,399
- But if it's food and culture
that you're lookin' for,

- Yeah, you probably know it.

1594
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:14,239
- Casa Montana?
- Yeah, yeah.

1595
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,558

1596
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,402
- I know.

1597
01:05:16,403 --> 01:05:17,959
- And Valencia's got the Holy Grail.

1598
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,042
- How long does it take to
get to Valencia from here?

1599
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:22,201
- Valencia's like two hours
away, man, it's close.

1600
01:05:22,202 --> 01:05:23,679
- Let's go to Valencia.

1601
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,601
- Well, no, (STAMMERING)
we're not going to Valencia.

1602
01:05:25,602 --> 01:05:26,679
- Go to Valencia.
- We've got a whole schedule.

1603
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,520
- No.

1604
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:29,043
- We can go to Valencia,
it's just two hours.

1605
01:05:29,044 --> 01:05:30,279
- We've got a schedule worked out.

1606
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,085
We've got pre-ordained
route taking in some...

1607
01:05:33,086 --> 01:05:34,319
- Where's the fun in that?

1608
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,679
Stray from the path, man.

1609
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,205
- We sort of are straying from the path

1610
01:05:37,206 --> 01:05:39,399
by not going to places
like Catalonia, so...

1611

- Okay, again, yeah, all right.

1615

Listen, I'm gonna head
back to the hotel anyway,

- Now?

You're all right, you'll be
all right here with, uh, man.

Perhaps he'll play you a few tunes.

All right, mate, good luck
with your Bo Diddley stuff.

- Like a piece of ham?

- I had a fan phone call today.

1640
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,726
Do you remember the
agent Steve used to have

1641
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:44,165
in LA called Matt?

1642
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,479
- Sort of, yeah.

1643
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,079
- Look, when you come back, I was thinking

1644
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,559
maybe we could go out to
Rachel's for the weekend.

1645

- [STEVE] Fantastic,
yeah, I'd love to do that.

- [MISCHA] Nice place.

1647
01:06:55,448 --> 01:06:57,439
- [STEVE] Yeah, but, you know what?

1648
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,564
Yeah, well, we'll definitely do that,

1649
01:06:58,565 --> 01:06:59,641
but why don't you come out earlier?

1650
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:01,999
- He wants me to go with him,

1651
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,319
and be represented by him in LA.

1652
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,205
- Surely there's no
point in that, is there?

1653
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:08,526
- Absolutely right answer.

Well done, I give you two points for that.

can do his own thing.

You know, he's a big boy.

- What shoes size did you give them.

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1726
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,399
- Don Quixote had three trips, I think.

1727
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,084
He had the one that he
went out on his own.

1728
01:10:02,085 --> 01:10:04,763
And he went back, and he
just did Sancho Panza.

1729
01:10:04,764 --> 01:10:07,922
And then he had the sequel, and
this is now your third trip.

1730
01:10:07,923 --> 01:10:09,410
- When Cervantes wrote the sequel,

1731
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:13,039
in the interim, after he'd
written the first part,

1732
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,439
there was a fake sequel published,

1733
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,519
then he incorporated the fake
sequel into his real sequel,

1734
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,079
so he made that part of the story.

1735
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,162
So when he's out, was on his
travels in the second book,

1736
01:10:23,163 --> 01:10:25,843
he bumps into people who'd
read the fake sequel,

1737
01:10:25,844 --> 01:10:28,923
and so he can slag it off
within the pages as Don Quixote.

1738
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:33,759
That is so bold and innovative,
and it's 500 years ago.

1739
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,239
So, effectively he was postmodern,

1784
01:12:31,963 --> 01:12:34,611
- Because anyone who is anyone will know

1785
01:12:34,612 --> 01:12:37,968
that the title of the song by Herb Albert

1786
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,799
is Spanish Flea, not Spanish Fly.

1787
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,770
- May I be so bold as to
put you up on a wee point,

1788
01:12:44,771 --> 01:12:49,759
that it's not Herb Albert,
it's Herb Alpert, with a P.

1789
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,199
- Ah, yes.
- You've got your Ps

1790
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,247
and your Bs mixed up there.

1791
01:12:52,248 --> 01:12:54,359
- You've got your fleas
and your flies all over.

1792
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,519
- And you've got your
- And I've got me

1793
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,646
- Ps and our Bs.
- Ps and me Bs.

1794
01:12:56,647 --> 01:12:58,759
I threw you a little
bone with a mistake there

1795
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,205
so that you could pick
me up, so we're all,

1796
01:13:00,206 --> 01:13:01,919
so we're all Even Steven.

1797
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,439
- Although we'll probably never know

1798
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,248
if that was the truth, though, will we?

1799
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:06,239
- I mean, that...
- Bs, flies, Ps, Bs.

1800
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,399
- You put a P in the wrong place.

1801
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,811
I had a pee in the wrong place once.

1802
01:13:08,812 --> 01:13:10,844
They won't let me back in
that supermarket again.

1803
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,884
- Yes, and don't forget that you know

1804
01:13:12,885 --> 01:13:14,291
time flies like an arrow,

1805
01:13:14,292 --> 01:13:16,726
but fruit flies like a banana.

1806
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,683
(CHURCH BELL RINGING)

1807
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,125
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

1808
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,759
- This is beautiful, very calming.

1809
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,399
- Yeah.
- It's wonderful.

1810
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,242
It's interesting, isn't it?

1811
01:13:41,243 --> 01:13:45,239
We started in the birthplace
of King Ferdinand,

1812
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:49,479
and here we are at the place
where they were buried.

1813
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,322
- Here?

1814
01:13:50,323 --> 01:13:51,999
- [STEVE] Yeah, in the hotel.

1815
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,284
- It wasn't a hotel then, though.

1816
01:13:53,285 --> 01:13:54,725
- No it wasn't then.
- That'd be awful wouldn't it?

1817
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:55,759
Dreadful.

1818
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,250
You have a reservation.

1819
01:13:57,251 --> 01:13:58,519
Uh, Smith.

1820
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,839
- [EMMA] Corpses of.

1821
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,886
- You wait a moment please,
we are about to bury the king.

1822
01:14:01,887 --> 01:14:02,722
Please, what?

1823
01:14:02,723 --> 01:14:04,679
Yes, we have a gymnasium.

1824
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,569
- Why are they buried in Granada then.

1825
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:10,959
- Because this is the last
town to fall to the Catholics.

1826
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,599
That's why they call them
the Catholic king and queen.

1827
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,807
The thing about the Moors is
they were way more tolerant

1828
01:14:16,808 --> 01:14:18,445
than the Catholics that came after them.

1829
01:14:18,446 --> 01:14:20,044
- I'm a big fan of the Moors.

1830
01:14:20,045 --> 01:14:23,931
Oh, Dudley Moore, Christy
Moore, Patrick Moore?

1831
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,039
- [EMMA] No more, please.

1832
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,399
- Roger Moore.
- No.

1833
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,399
- Now when I think back to
the Moors being here in Spain,

1834
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,839
I can honestly say we
had a wonderful time.

1835
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,759
Mother booked a holiday, and we arrived,

1836
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,719
and found the hotel to be to our liking.

1837
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,924
- Of course, what you're
forgetting to point out

1838
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:47,764
is that the Moors, when
they conquered Spain

1839
01:14:47,765 --> 01:14:51,479
in the early 8th century,
were encountering a Europe

1840
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,801
that was still very much in the Dark Ages.

1841
01:14:53,802 --> 01:14:55,759
- It was pitch black.

1842
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,725
- But they of course build
beautiful palaces like this.

1843
01:14:58,726 --> 01:15:00,285
They were very ahead of their time.

1844
01:15:00,286 --> 01:15:03,409
- I have to tell you, when we
were building these palaces,

1845
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:06,959
my fellow Moores, mother,
father, and sister,

1846
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,201
sometimes we would encounter a workman

1847
01:15:09,202 --> 01:15:13,559
who perhaps wasn't working quite
as quickly as I would want.

1848
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,359
Then I would say to him...

1849
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,486
- Move!
- Move!

1850
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,365
- Move!
- Move!

1851
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,086
A lot of them thought
they were hearing cows.

1852
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:26,039
- The thing about doing Roger Moore.

1853
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,848
Yes?

1854
01:15:26,849 --> 01:15:28,799
- Less is more.

1855
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,642
- Ah, you've met my brother Les.

1856
01:15:30,643 --> 01:15:32,242
- If you can let him...
- Les, come in.

1857
01:15:32,243 --> 01:15:34,284
That's right, I'm also a Moore.

1858
01:15:34,285 --> 01:15:36,085
- Les Moore.
- I was trying to hint

1859
01:15:36,086 --> 01:15:39,562
that you should always leave
your audience wanting more.

1860
01:15:39,563 --> 01:15:42,239
- My audience constantly wants more

1861
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,879
and that's what I give them.

1862
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,199
Roger Moore.

1863
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,519
- Moore, quit while you're ahead.

1864
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,409
- They introduced the orange to Spain.

1865
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,359
- The Moors?
- Yeah.

1866
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,759
- Really?
- Yeah.

1867
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,727
- From where?

1868
01:15:55,728 --> 01:15:58,079
- I guess Morocco, that's
where they're originally from.

1869
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,241
- Right.
- I can explain it to you,

1870
01:15:59,242 --> 01:16:00,523
if you like, it was my mother.

1871
01:16:00,524 --> 01:16:02,639
She packed one into her hand luggage.

1872
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,801
- He didn't get the hint, did he?

1873
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:06,079
- No.
- On one of her holidays.

1874
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,081
To which I said, Mother,
what are you doing?

1875
01:16:08,082 --> 01:16:09,161
She said, shush, Roger,

1876
01:16:09,162 --> 01:16:11,639
I'm going to introduce
the orange to Spain.

1877
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,402
- And another thing the Moors introduced

1878
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:15,679
was, of course, our numerical system.

1879
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,569
- That's right, we brought
a calculator with us.

1880
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,961
- Because basically we
used to use Roman numerals,

1881
01:16:19,962 --> 01:16:21,286
and it was only when they brought

1882
01:16:21,287 --> 01:16:24,011
the Arabic numerical
system that developed that

1883
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:27,209
into the numerical system we use today.

1884
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,879
- Mother said it would never work.

1885
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,211
- This is really crazy.
- Father said it will.

1886
01:16:33,212 --> 01:16:36,599
- The fact is that the Moors
were far more sophisticated.

1887
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,442
- Yes.
- They knew about medicine,

1888
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:40,759
- philosophy, mathematics.
- Yes, correct.

1889
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,841
- Astronomy.
- We love looking at the stars

1890
01:16:42,842 --> 01:16:45,127
- Very, very, way more advanced than,

1891
01:16:45,128 --> 01:16:47,479
and also managed to marry.

1892
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,444
- My parents did marry,
you're quite right.

1893
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:50,759
They married at a young age,

1894
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,602
they had me and my sister.

1895
01:16:51,603 --> 01:16:53,409
- Rob, Rob, seriously.

1896
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,365
He's got, like, Tourette.

1897
01:16:56,366 --> 01:16:59,842
- The wonderful day my uncle
Bertie gave the sermon,

1898
01:16:59,843 --> 01:17:02,519
he was a preacher, you see.

1899
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,362
- The Greek philosophers were translated

1900
01:17:04,363 --> 01:17:06,679
- into Arabic by the Moors.
- That's right.

1901
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,886
- It was only
- Thank you very much.

1902
01:17:07,887 --> 01:17:09,039
- During the Crusades,

1903
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,644
- when they invaded Toledo...
- It was a pleasure to do it.

1904
01:17:10,645 --> 01:17:12,483
And father, sitting at his desk,

1905
01:17:12,484 --> 01:17:14,639
translating night and clay.

1906
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,958
My mother would say to him,
- So they translated

1907
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:16,961
- Aristotle's
- when are you going to take

1908
01:17:16,962 --> 01:17:18,323
- Roger to the park?
- teachings.

1909
01:17:18,324 --> 01:17:20,923
- Aristotle's teachings
were translated into Arabic

1910
01:17:20,924 --> 01:17:24,239
by the Muslims, and then during
the Crusades the canvas...

1911
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,004
- Why didn't you say they
were clone by the Moors?

1912
01:17:26,005 --> 01:17:27,570
Are you trying to discourage me?

1913
01:17:27,571 --> 01:17:28,799
- What, what?

1914
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,839
- [EMMA] Please, yes.

1915
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,044
- You've stopped saying Moores,

1916
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:32,326
and you've started saying Muslims.

1917
01:17:32,327 --> 01:17:36,759
And I find that a little
racially offensive.

1918
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,039
- Go on, please.

1919
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,201
- You started off referring
to us as the Moores,

1920
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:42,122
now you're referring to us as Muslims.

1921
01:17:42,123 --> 01:17:43,526
- [STEVE] The Moors were Muslims.

1922
01:17:43,527 --> 01:17:45,679
- But why did you start with Moores?

1923
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,486
- It doesn't matter.

1924
01:17:46,487 --> 01:17:47,845
The people that I'm talking
about were one and the same

1925
01:17:47,846 --> 01:17:48,921
Moors with the Muslims.

1926
01:17:48,922 --> 01:17:52,559
- I'm not Roger Muslim, I'm Roger Moore.

1927
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,239
- Dear god.

1928
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,679
Oh, dear.

1929
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,205
Oh, I've got you a ticket the first thing

1930
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:58,606
in the morning to see the Alhambra.

1931
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:00,399
- Oh, brilliant, great, great.

1932
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,561
- Rob, I've got one for you, too.

1933
01:18:01,562 --> 01:18:04,206
- Can I go later, can
I go after breakfast?

1934
01:18:04,207 --> 01:18:05,611
- (LAUGHS) It'll be busy.

1935
01:18:05,612 --> 01:18:07,959
- Yolanda, you should come with me.

1936
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,039
- I can't, I have to take an
early flight back to London.

1937
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:11,848

01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,201
Look me in the eye and tell me

2096
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:42,085
you think you could play El Cid.

2097
01:25:42,086 --> 01:25:44,081
In a remake, the Charlton Heston role.

2098
01:25:44,082 --> 01:25:45,443
- I mean, you could certainly play

2099
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:46,879
Michael Hordern in El Cid.

2100
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,720
- Who did he play?

2101
01:25:47,721 --> 01:25:48,959
- Someone's clad, I can't remember.

2102
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,039
- Oh.

2103
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,246
You know Michael Hordern, Emma?

2104
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:52,519
- Michael Hordern, yuh.

2105
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,405
- [ROB] Why is she having him?

2106
01:25:53,406 --> 01:25:54,242
- Michael Hordern would go,

2107
01:25:54,243 --> 01:25:56,559
yuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-um,
Paddington Bear.

2108
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,400
- Yeah, I know.

2109
01:25:57,401 --> 01:25:58,561
- I loved his voice.
- That wasn't Michael Hordern.

2110
01:25:58,562 --> 01:26:00,050
That was Michael Hordern's horse.

2111
01:26:00,051 --> 01:26:01,959
- Michael, hmm, Hordern.

2112
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:02,802
Anyway, hm?

2113
01:26:02,803 --> 01:26:05,039
- Didn't he do No Man's Land with Gielgud.

2114
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,563
You wouldn't know, it
was theater, but he did.

2115
01:26:06,564 --> 01:26:07,402
- Um.
- Did he?

2116
01:26:07,403 --> 01:26:09,289
- You know who's doing it now?

2117
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:12,119
Ian McKellen, you shall not have the ring.

2118
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,679
- Ian McKellen, speaks
like that with a slight,

2119
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,399
however he fancies northern flat vowels.

2120
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,799
- Yes, gracias.

2121
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,839
- Finito.

2122
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,205
- Muchas gracias.

2123
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,679
Thank you.

2124
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,648
- You're missing a bit of
confidence, you see, because Ian...

2125
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:29,004
- Yes, well, no, I think
you're overplaying that

2126
01:26:29,005 --> 01:26:30,159
because, you see...

2127
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:31,650
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, he's acting in the role.

2128
01:26:31,651 --> 01:26:33,083
You don't quite get it.

2129
01:26:33,084 --> 01:26:34,999
- I've spoken to him.
- I can speak.

2130
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,841
- Oh, you do a McKelloff.
- I have actually met him.

2131
01:26:36,842 --> 01:26:38,729
- I have met him many times.
- I've met him many times.

2132
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,484
- How many times?
- Many times.

2133
01:26:40,485 --> 01:26:45,079
Oh, you don't get the
musicality when he throws a line

2134
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,241
up to the gods,
- That was good.

2135
01:26:46,242 --> 01:26:47,526
- And then brings it back down,

2136
01:26:47,527 --> 01:26:49,919
but still with the flat vowels.

2137
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,762
They are very much in evidence,

2138
01:26:51,763 --> 01:26:53,724
however much he may try to be,

2139
01:26:53,725 --> 01:26:56,121
pursue pronunciation with the vowels.

2140
01:26:56,122 --> 01:26:57,804
- Oh, you do make me laugh, you really,

2141
01:26:57,805 --> 01:26:59,319
you do make me laugh.

2142
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,399
Oh, we need a laugh, don't we?

2143
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,839
Oh, you do make me laugh, Rob, you do.

2144
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,763
- That's what he said to me.
- He do that more in private?

2145
01:27:05,764 --> 01:27:07,125
- Because when he met me, he said,

2146
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:09,079
"You're a very good actor."

Do you want to come back with me?

I can get you on the same flight.

2153
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:27,639
- No, I'll stay, thank you,

01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,130
and I'm gonna write
more and finish my book.

looking for is start.

Thinkin' about Joe.

2157
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,799
20 is a young age to have a child.

2158
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,402
- How old were you when you had your kids?

2159
01:27:41,403 --> 01:27:42,403
- 43.

2160
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,042
- Bit of a difference.

2161
01:27:44,043 --> 01:27:45,199
- Yes.

2162
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,085
I didn't drink 'til I was 35,

2163

and the first child at 43.

2164
01:27:48,604 --> 01:27:49,761
Are the two related?

2165
01:27:49,762 --> 01:27:50,804
We'll never know.

2166
01:27:50,805 --> 01:27:53,326
- How old, what's her
name, the girlfriend?

2167
01:27:53,327 --> 01:27:54,719
- Helen, she's 19.

- 19?
- Gosh.

01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,290
- Only 19 years old.

2171

- [TOGETHER] She was only 19 years old!

2172

- I don't mean any
disrespect, Steve, but...

2173
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:08,879
- She was only 19, she was only,

2174
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:09,800
you've got to get the voice better.

2175
01:28:09,801 --> 01:28:11,928
- Well, you've got me most in
your voice when you say it.

2176
01:28:11,929 --> 01:28:13,445
- She was only.
- Now he has.

2177
01:28:13,446 --> 01:28:15,039
- She was 19 years old.

2178
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,959
- Joe has met a young lady.

2179
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,247
- She was only 19 years old.

2180
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,119
- When Joe and Helen had a child

2181
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,399
she was only 19 years old.

2182
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,519
- She was only, it's
actually 16 in the film.

2183
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,799
- I know that, but Helen
was only 19 years old.

2184
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,525
And she had the child with Joe.

2185
01:28:35,526 --> 01:28:37,887
She had a grandfather who was so talented,

2186

- He was only.

- The grandfather was only 50 years old.

2189

- 50 years old.

2190

Hey, do you know who was born in Malaga?

2191
01:28:47,003 --> 01:28:48,479
- No.
- Picasso.

2192
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,959
- Who?
- Picasso.

2193
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:50,802
- Is that true?

2194
01:28:50,803 --> 01:28:53,243
- Yeah, they're openin' a museum to him.

2195
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:55,359
- Who played Picasso
in a very popular film

2196
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,325
- in the last 10 years?
- Oh, god.

2197
01:28:56,326 --> 01:28:57,160
- Who was it?

2198
01:28:57,161 --> 01:28:58,002
No, ask Emma.

2199
01:28:58,003 --> 01:28:59,799
- Who played Picasso?

2200
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,801
Guess, it's one of Rob's five impressions.

2201
01:29:01,802 --> 01:29:03,562
That should narrow it down.

2202
01:29:03,563 --> 01:29:05,279
- It wasn't Tom Jones.
- Antonio?

2203
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,598
- No, not allowed.
- It wasn't Tom Jones.

Okay, we're gettin' closer.

- I don't know.
- Tony Hopkins.

2207
01:29:09,968 --> 01:29:11,759
Tony Hopkins played in Surviving...

2208
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,759
- Did he?

2209
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:15,885
- Surviving Picasso, I played
the painter, wonderful man.

2210
01:29:15,886 --> 01:29:17,084
I don't like to talk about it.

2211
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:17,922
I like to draw.

2212
01:29:17,923 --> 01:29:20,119
I like to put the eyes
here, the nose there,

2213
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,087
- the mouth up there.
- He played Picasso

2214
01:29:21,088 --> 01:29:22,399
as a Welshman?

2215
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,079
- Well, he didn't do a
Spanish accent, Steve.

2216
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:25,920
- Did he not?

2217
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:27,729
- He doesn't have your
versatility, let's be honest.

2218
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:30,799
- He learned to paint, and
he painted the paintings

2219
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,608
in a fiddlety way.

2220
01:29:31,609 --> 01:29:34,166
He knew how to instill life,
and he knew how to, uh,

2221
01:29:34,167 --> 01:29:35,965
you know, paint, uh, the way these as...

2222
01:29:35,966 --> 01:29:37,004
- Uh, Pablo, Pablo.

2223
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:39,321
Some of the men are saying
that you're painting

2224
01:29:39,322 --> 01:29:40,523
in a very strange way.

2225
01:29:40,524 --> 01:29:42,999
They're saying that the nose
is where the eyes should be.

2226
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,759
Some of them are saying you're a Cubist.

2227
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,602
- Oh, Pablo?

2228
01:29:45,603 --> 01:29:47,999
Is it not captain or sir, hm, eh?

2229
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,840
- There are rumblings, Pablo.

2230
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:50,444
- Oh, they want me to put the
nose in the front of the face.

2231
01:29:50,445 --> 01:29:51,959
In the middle, like that, that it?

2232
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,722
And the eyes next to the
nose, is that what you want?

2233
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:54,846
- Yes, sir.
- Well, tell the men,

2234
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:57,283
when we put the nose by the cheekies,

2235
01:29:57,284 --> 01:29:58,599
and we put the eyes up here,

2236
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,724
and the mouth 'round the corner,

2237
01:29:59,725 --> 01:30:01,210
I was asail 'round the Cape of Good Hope,

2238
01:30:01,212 --> 01:30:02,042
goddam your eyes, sir.

2239
01:30:02,043 --> 01:30:03,519
- I put the eyes where I want to,

2240
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,644
and the nose where I want to.

2241
01:30:04,645 --> 01:30:05,721
If you turn your back on me,

2242
01:30:05,722 --> 01:30:07,365
I shall put two eyes on your back,

2243
01:30:07,366 --> 01:30:08,879
and a nose down by your ass.

2244
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:09,686
Do you want that, sir?

2245
01:30:09,687 --> 01:30:10,520
Is that what you want, sir?

2246
01:30:10,521 --> 01:30:11,601
Don't turn your back on me.

2247
01:30:11,602 --> 01:30:14,039
I will draw you like a
Cubist, that's what I'll do.

2248
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,962
If you turn your back on me,

2249
01:30:14,963 --> 01:30:16,802
I'll put a nose on your bottom, sir.

'Round the Horn is a good way,

2251
01:30:18,127 --> 01:30:19,279

- The most interesting
thing about Picasso is,

2253
01:30:20,965 --> 01:30:23,201
why I love him, his early paintings

2254
01:30:23,202 --> 01:30:26,519
are very orthodox, very accessible.

2255
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,727
He knew how to do all that,
but he said that's not enough.

2256
01:30:28,728 --> 01:30:30,684
I want to rewrite the rule book,

2257
01:30:30,685 --> 01:30:32,405
and be radical and Avant Garde.

2258
01:30:32,406 --> 01:30:34,641
- Are you a bit like Picasso, Steve?

2259
01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:36,563
- Well, I empathize with what he did.

2260
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,559
- Yes, he is, he is, he is.

2261
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,879
He's gonna say it.

2262
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:40,688
- [STEVE] What I'm saying is...

2263
01:30:40,689 --> 01:30:44,401
- [ROB] Let me record
this, hang on, hang on.

2264

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

2265
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,842
- I've got a reservations, Steve Coogan.

2266
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,639
- This castle is Gibralfaro,

2267
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,041
named after the same man as Gibraltar.

2268
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:08,601
When the Moors came in 711,
they were only a few thousand.

2269
01:31:08,602 --> 01:31:10,728
Within a couple of years they controlled

2270
01:31:10,729 --> 01:31:13,079
almost all of Spain.

2271
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,682
- Wow.
- That's exactly the same

2272
01:31:14,683 --> 01:31:16,839
as ISIS and the modern caliphate,

2273
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,365
because there's only a
few thousand of them,

2274
01:31:18,366 --> 01:31:21,245
and yet they control half
of Syria and half of Iraq.

2275
01:31:21,246 --> 01:31:23,082
They're trying to emulate
what the Moors did

2276
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:26,239
when they had control everywhere
from Cordoba to Baghdad.

2277
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,205
- Well, ISIS aren't tolerant.

2278
01:31:27,206 --> 01:31:28,326
They're not doing it with tolerance and...

2279
01:31:28,327 --> 01:31:30,879
- No, they're not, but Islam, uh, is...

2280
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,961
- Can we stop talking about ISIS?

2281
01:31:32,962 --> 01:31:35,361
- Cervantes was captured
by Barbary pirates

2282
01:31:35,362 --> 01:31:37,159
and taken to Algiers.

2283
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,683
There was a price on his head,
and when the ransom was paid,

2284
01:31:39,684 --> 01:31:41,759
he let his brother go instead of him.

2285
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,805
- Very noble.
- Is that true?

2286
01:31:42,806 --> 01:31:43,640
- [EMMA] That is true.

2287
01:31:43,641 --> 01:31:44,562
- He let his brother go,

2288
01:31:44,563 --> 01:31:46,210
- when he could have gone.
- Yeah.

2289
01:31:46,211 --> 01:31:48,039
- Wow.
- I know.

2290
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:48,880
- Not sure I'd do that.

2291
01:31:48,881 --> 01:31:50,291
Would you do that, let your brother go?

2292
01:31:50,292 --> 01:31:52,599
- Uh, (BLOWS OUT) probably not.

2293
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,761
- No, I don't think I would either,

2294
01:31:53,762 --> 01:31:55,879
with the best one in the world.

2295
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:56,722
- [EMMA] No.

2296
01:31:56,723 --> 01:31:58,764
If my child we there,
they could take my child.

2297
01:31:58,765 --> 01:31:59,999
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

2298
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,490
- I'd let any child go.

2299
01:32:01,491 --> 01:32:02,999
- Any child?

2300
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,125
- Any child, as long as it, you
know, I mean, not any child.

2301
01:32:06,126 --> 01:32:08,441
I mean, it has to be worth the effort.

2302
01:32:08,442 --> 01:32:11,799
- Cervantes, when he tried
to escape, he's captured,

2303
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,961
he had a noose around his neck.

2304
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:15,122
He was talking to Hassan,
the leader of Algiers,

2305
01:32:15,123 --> 01:32:18,879
and he became his lover to
literally save his neck.

2306
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,199
- Bum or neck?
- Yeah.

2307
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,563
- If that's what it comes down to, yes.

2308
01:32:21,564 --> 01:32:22,402
- [EMMA] Life or bum.

2309
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:25,439
- Well, either way your buggered.

2310
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,799
- Let me say now, I'm in.

2311
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,439
- Really?
- He's in, rather, he's in.

2312
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:33,284
- Ah, but they became lovers,
so it would be in-out-in-out.

2313
01:32:33,285 --> 01:32:34,719
- You see that ferry?

2314
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:35,839
- [EMMA] Yeah.

2315
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,161
- [STEVE] That's the ferry for Africa.

2316
01:32:38,162 --> 01:32:39,559

- Mm.

01:32:59,003 --> 01:33:01,446
- I got the depth right there.

2325
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,884

2326
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,730
- Right, I'm gonna make a move.

2327
01:33:10,731 --> 01:33:12,085
Um, early flight.

2328
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,759
- [EMMA] Yeah, me too, actually.

2329
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,727

you're gonna be all right?

Hey, what can we say?

2339
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,959
- It's been a week.
