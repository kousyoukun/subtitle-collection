<i>Yeah, good.
Where are you?</i>

00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,194
I'm in London. Just got back
from filming in New York.

7
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,729
<i>I play a chef. It's
called "medium rare."</i>

00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,332

Have you met him?

9
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,601
- No, I've not.
<i>- He's great. He's great.</i>

10
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,736
<i>Anyway they want me

00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,472
<i>for the launch of the series.</i>

12
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,507
To do a series of
restaurant reviews.

13
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,110
Um, this time a trip to Spain

14
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,344
<i>for "the new
York times."</i>

15
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,947
Yeah, I know. "The
observer" asked me.

16
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,648
Oh, right, so you know about it.
Okay.

17
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,650
Well, yeah, so it's a "New
York times"- "observer" thing.

18
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,419

22
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,297
Yes, I will come.

23
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,966
Good, great, okay,

24
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,768
will be in touch
with, uh, oh, you.

25
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,314
Yeah, well, you know,
Rob's not gonna be here.

26
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,984
- Rob, Steve's here.
- <i>Okay.</i>

27
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,719
What? No, 'cause he's
got a ferry to catch.

28
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,154
Where are you?

29
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,788
Okay.

30
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,323
We'll see you when you
get here then, okay?

31
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,492
- Yeah, bye-bye. Bye.
- Is that all good?

32
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,128
No. That was the builder.
He's running late.

33
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,429
Right, have your remembered

34
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,398
your passport, your wallet...

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,233
My passport, my
wallet, my phone..

36
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,735
The book you were reading?

37
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,870
I got everything I need

38
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,641
to go out into the darkness.

39
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,509
Right, come on, daddy's going.
Follow me out.

40
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,777
Dad, you forgot your hat.

41
00:02:58,779 --> 00:02:59,845
<i>Alright bring it out then.</i>

42
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:00,846
<i>You can give it to him now.</i>

43
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:01,947
<i>Bring it for me.</i>

44
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,382
And say goodbye.

45
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,251
Oh,<i> buenos Dias.</i>

46
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,420
- Hmm. How are you doing?
- Good. You know Sally?

47
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,488
- Yes, sorry, hello, Sally.

48
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,589

50
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,192
Nice to see you.
This is Charlie.

51
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,660
Oh, hello, Charlie. I don't
think I know this one.

52
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:15,961
No, and this.. You
remember Chloe, don't you?

53
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,696
Yes, of course.
Hello, Chloe. How are you?

54
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,331
God, you were a little
baby last time I saw you

55
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,599
and you've gone, shhwt!
Like that.

56
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,601
That's what happens.

57
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,902
You've got a lot of stuff,
haven't you?

58
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,504
Uh, well, some of this
is, uh, Joe's.

59
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,472
You know, my, uh, my son.

60
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,774
I remember him.

61
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,876
He's, uh, comin' out
the end of the trip.

62
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,178
Yeah! Gimme a kiss.

63
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,113
- Oh, who did that noise?
- You did.

64
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,583
I think you did that noise.
Give me another one.

65
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,453
Charlie Farley, oh.

66
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,988
- Kiss for dad.

- Bye-bye, darling.
- Bye, darling.

69
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,926
I love you. Have fun.

70
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:48,961
- Look after them.
- Enjoy yourself.

71
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:50,529
You'll take care of mommy, okay?

72
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,563
- Yep, I will.
- You will.

73
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,233
Won't you,
Charlie? Yeah.

74
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,802
Have a good trip, and, uh,
you look after him.

75
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,837
Yes, I will try and bring
him back here in one piece.

76
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,639
- <i>Yeah, please do.</i>
- Okay. Okay.

77
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,841
<i>- Adios, amigos.

Bye!

82
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,122
Are we gonna get this ferry?

83
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,392
Um, well, I'd say probably yes.

84
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,827
- Alright.
- But, uh..

85
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,829
A little bit of jeopardy
I think kinda gives...

86
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,097
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

87
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,131
Adds a little bit of...

88
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,733
Living your life on the edge

89
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,669
<i>by getting to a ferry
a little bit late.</i>

90
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,840
I have two cabins for you.

91
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,008
Mm-hmm.

92
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,844
One commodore cabin
and one deluxe cabin.

93
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,345
Okay. Which is the best?

94
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,947
The commodore cabin is the best.

95
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:42,948
Oh, great.

96
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,516
Mr. Coogan
should have that.

97
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,618
- Oh, Rob.
- Commodore Coogan.

98
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,753
- Okay.
- Thank you.

99
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,454
Is this the commodore?

100
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,889
No, that's the deluxe cabin.

101
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,291
Alright.

102
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,725
See you later, commodore.

103
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,127
- Okay.
- Sir, that's your key.

104
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,029
- Thank you.<i> Merci.</i>
- See you later.

105
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,930
- Thanks.
- Then I show you yours.

106
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,433
Okay. What did you say

107
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,402

109
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,639
- No. Ohoha.
- Ohoha?

110
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,074
- Yes.
- Is that near enough?

111
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,142
Yes.

112
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,045
You're right about
this bein' a better way.

113
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:14,880
This is more romantic.

114
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,515
This is more like a journey.

115
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,684
It is.

116
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,186
You know what the first most
famous boat that left here was..

117
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,354
Most famous ship, I should say.

118
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:24,523
Uh, the mayflower?

119
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,757
Yes, the mayflower.

120
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,994
- Pilgrim fathers?
- Yeah.

121
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,195
Pilgrim fathers for justice.

122
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,098
They, uh, tied themselves
to that crane.

123
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,101
Demanded more breadfruit
for their children.

124

<i>Where were they headed?</i>

125
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,470
<i>They were headed to America.</i>

What part of America?</i>

127

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,310
Charming that his mother made it, you know.
How about yours?

159
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,945
What's happening in New York?

160
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,748
I've been seeing a lot of Misha.
Remember Misha?

161
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,283
The girl you were seeing
with the legs?

162
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,118
Mm-hmm, yeah.

163
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,187
- Yeah.
- You seeing her again?

164
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,288
- Didn't she get...
- I..

165
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,389
I'm in love with her.

166
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,925
But she got married.

167
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:43,295
- She is married.
- Oh.

168
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,396
- Um, I know, it's not ideal..
- Carry on.

169
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,464
- It's not ideal.
- Take your time.

170
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,065
- Give me details.
- It's not ideal.

171
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,936
But we.. She just.. We just
bumped into each other and, uh..

172
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,839
And, you know, we just, you
could tell it was just there.

173
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,241
A smile, I gave her one
of my smiles and, uh...

174
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,810
Well, I mean, you don't
have to say anymore.

175
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,379
One of those smiles.

176
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,948
And then, like an anchovy,
she just..

177
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,051
Wriggled into my net again.

178
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,486
- Was it exciting?
- It is exciting.

179
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,487
But it's not like
the first time.

180
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,721
It's not like I don't know her.

181
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:10,755
It's like, it's like
we've rekindled

182
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:11,823
what we had before
and it's, uh...

183
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,426
- Still exciting.
- Yeah, it is.

184
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,562
Actually you lose excitement
when you, when you're married.

185
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,564
- I'll tell you that.
- Yeah. Well, you can't have everything.

186
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,832
- The thing is you can't have everything.
- No.

187
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,634
You can't have everything.
That's my mantra.

188
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,835
- You can't have everything.
- Yeah.

189
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,704
When people complain,
"no, you know.."

190
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,405
- Well, alright, make a choice.
- No..

191
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,573
I couldn't agree more,
couldn't agree more.

192
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,509
- I have a young family.
- Yeah?

193
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,344
For a man of my age,
my kids are young.

194
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,945
Yeah. Yeah.
How old's your wife?

195
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,314
Forty-three.
Mm-hmm.

196
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,616
She's just got those kids in..

197
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,683
Just squeezed them
in quick then?

198
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,185
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

199
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,820
I'm not going the full Mick
Jagger and having them at..

200
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,889
He's having another one at 72.

201
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,957
Yeah, that's daft, innit?

202
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,726
- Ever met him?
- I have.

203
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,528
- I was at a party.
- Yeah?

204
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,896
- I was leaving.
- Yeah.

205
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:54,099
- And I heard from the, uh, balcony.
- Uh-huh.

206
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,300
"Rob, Rob."

207
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,935
- Rob.
- <i>Rob.</i>

208
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,670
Here, Rob, Rob.

209
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,438
Oh, look, well, he didn't,
he didn't do the full but..

210
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,173
And I looked up and he went..

211
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,376
"Don't throw those
bloody Spears at me."

212
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,744
I said "what?"

213
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,679
He was, "don't throw
those bloody Spears at me."

214
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,481
Yeah. No, no.

215
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,949
- He was doing Michael Caine.
- I know, I know.

216
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,817
But what you find is
that he speaks like..

217
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,653
Sometimes it's sort of,
it's sort of like that

218
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,154
so that it's actually
quite posh.

219
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,823
And sometimes
he's quite sort of, uh..

220
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,825
You can see that he's quite
actually, he's like that

221
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,428
a sort of public
school thing going on.

222
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,230
You know, and now you got
slightly deep like that.

223
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,300
But, um, but, uh,
and, uh, you know

224
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,634
you got the old sort of, um..

225
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,703
Sort of peacock thing, you know.

226
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,706
- Sorry, sorry.
- Sorry.

227
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,908
He went, "don't throw those
bloody Spears at me."

228
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,710
And I went,
"oh, Michael Caine."

229
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,312
So I looked up at him and I said

230
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,981
"I've told you before
if you're not gonna sing

231
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,082
"I don't wanna bloody know.

232
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,483
Now get back
in the other room."

233
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,018
And he went,
"aha-ha-ha."

234
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,753
And off he went.
He loved it.

235
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,190
But had I had a close
conversation with him

236
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,193
I would've said, "what are you
doing having a child at 72?"

237
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,696
Yeah, you know what?
I mean, it's not ideal.

238
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,332
Look, Charlie Chaplin was
knocking them out in his 80s

239
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:01,700
and that's not ideal either.

240
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,202
But we're... we're
positively footloose

241
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,304
and... and carefree
and... and

242
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,673
we're like teenagers
compared with other guys.

243
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,041
We should enjoy
this moment in our lives.

244
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,843
We're at the sweet spot
in our lives.

245
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,345
- Hmm, hmm..
- We really are.

246
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,981
We're like ripe, you know?

247
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,617
I am in my prime.
If I was miss Jean bro..

248
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,619
I should play miss Jean Brodie.

249
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,922
There's a lot of gender swapping
going on now in big roles.

250
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,223
I could play miss Jean Brodie.

251
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,137
Oh!

252
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,109
- Thank you.
- Just look at this.

253
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,780
You writing anything
at the moment?

254
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,615
Of course, I am, yeah,
what I'm trying to do

255
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:54,119
with this odyssey through Spain
is do what Laurie Lee did.

256
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,153
You don't know this about me.

257
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,589
About 30 years ago,
when I was 18

258
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,491
I came to Spain backpacking

259
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,293
after a levels, before
I went to university

260
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:06,564
and I met a woman
called Sofia who was 37.

261
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,366
And she'd basically
showed me the ropes.

262
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,801
I lost my virginity to her.

263
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:10,902
How many years ago?

264
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,772
Well, that's 32 years ago.

265
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:16,941
- So she's now 70?
- Yeah, yeah.

266
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,143
- Sixty-nine, 70?
- She's 70, yeah.

267
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:21,012
- Should we look her up?
- No, I saw, I met her.

268
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,781
She's massive.
Saw her on a Vespa.

269
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,351
- Successful or massive?
- No, no, I mean fat.

270
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,521
I think the two of you
should give it another go.

271
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,524
Why don't we visit her, take
her some Turkish delight?

272
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,092
I think that's the last thing
she wants, to be honest.

273
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,061
It's the one thing
I do know about her.

274
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,562
<i>Anyway, I want to write a book</i>

275
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,932
<i>about Spain and me.</i>

276
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,701
Is that why you bought
the Laurie Lee book?

277
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,669
Yeah. Well, he wrote this
when he was early 50s.

278
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,171
But it was about when he was 18.

279
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,439
So it's almost exactly
the same as me.

280
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,942
Cervantes wrote "don
Quixote" when he was 50.

281
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,877
50s in many ways, I think...

282
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,212
No, we're at the sweet
spot in our life.

283
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,549
The best age. It's... it's
the sweet spot.

284
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,984
You've still got,
touch wood, time...

285
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,086
We're ripe, we're a ripe fruit

286
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,987
but if you hang on
to the branch any longer

287
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,422
you're just gonna wither
on the vine...

288
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,691
- So what do you do then?
- Drop.

289
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,226
Or do you wanna be plucked?

290
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,428
You wanna be plucked actually.

291
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,731
I'd much rather be plucked
than drop.

292
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,200
But who's gonna pluck you
at this age?

293
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,901
You'd be surprised.

294
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,310
But after "Philomena,"
this opened a whole new

295
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,278
sort of, uh, chapter for
me in terms of, like

296
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
the... the way my career's gone.
All the, uh...

297
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,882
Co-wrote that,
didn't you?

298
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,451
Yeah, yeah. Yeah... yeah, I've
always, I've always co-write.

299
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,653
I mean, I, you know, I mean,
really, I'm kinda like

300
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,522
I'm the one who talks
and has all the ideas

301
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,556
and they,
the... the other person's

302
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,825
kind of like a sort of typist.

303
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,160
Will they view it that way?

304
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,162
Oh, no, I would never say
that to them personally.

305
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,731
No, but, I mean,
but... but privately..

306
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,734
These reviews
I write myself, of course.

307
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,002
Well, that's great. I mean,
how you gonna do it?

308
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,238
We're in Spain,
I'm gonna do it like

309
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,406
Sancho Panza
in "don Quixote."

310
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,843
Two middle-aged men
looking for adventure.

311
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,446
- That's not a bad, um...
- "don Quixote."

312
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,782
- Idealist, dreamer.
- Yeah.

313
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,717
- Head in the clouds. Yes?
- Yeah.

314
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,920
- And his solid, dependable friend.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

315
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,595
So what are you
co-writing?

316
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:18,797
Uh, it... it's
called "missing."

317
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,433
It's about a man looking
for his daughter and...

318
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:26,070
This'll be the follow-up to your film
about a woman looking for her son.

319
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,772
Yeah, well, exactly,
it's the... it's the...

320
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:30,341
It's the sister-piece
to that.

321
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,577
Um, and if I do another
one, it'll be a trilogy.

322
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,346
But anyway, um, yeah, it's
about the, the two of them...

323
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,115
You should be looking
for something else.

324
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:40,585
You know, the... the, to
avoid the comparisons maybe?

325
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,453
Man looking for his car.

326
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,089
But the thing is you can... you
can do a man who's lost his car.

327
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,558
There's... there's
lots of, oh..

328
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,460
European filmmakers
use huge overbearing

329
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,030
you know, huge thematic
metaphors all the time.

330
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,531
So it could be a guy
looking for his car.

331
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,500
But actually,
he doesn't realize..

332
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,035
He thinks he's looking
for his car, but actually

333
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,237
he's looking for something
much bigger than that.

334
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,105
A Van.

335
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,975
Yeah, well, the Van of life.

336
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:07,111
- The Van of life.
- Well.

337
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,214
Can we, can we put this,
can we put this up?

338
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,755
We're going?

339
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,524
We're going.

340
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:20,959
Hey!

341
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,697
Thank you.

342
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,771
<i>Have you ever seen rain
like this?</i>

343
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:37,408
Oh, yeah, I was in on a..

344
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,677
I got stuck
in a landslide overnight

345
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,514
uh, on the north, on the
West Side of Fulmer.

346
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,183
Stuck in a landslide,
I had to stay overnight

347
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,218
in the car for eight hours.

348
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,753
I was fine, I found out later

349
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,055
I was in the wettest spot

350
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,425
in the country
ever recorded in history.

351
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,661
You've told me this before.

352
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,563
<i>Well, you, you asked
and that was...</i>

353
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,531
<i>No, I asked you</i>

354
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,567
<i>have you ever seen
rain like this?</i>

355
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,768
<i>Obviously, if you ask
a question like that</i>

356
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,903
<i>you obviously want some details.</i>

357
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,104
<i>If it's a story
that you've told before</i>

358
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,572
<i>you say, "yes, do you remember</i>

359
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,740
<i>that time
in the landslide?"</i>

360
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,241
<i>And I say,
"oh, I remember."</i>

361
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,403
Do you know who sang that?

362
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,973
Uh, lots of people.
Dusty Springfield?

363
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:19,811
Noel Harrison is the famous one.
Son of..

364
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,379
George?

365
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,214
No. Rex Harrison.

366
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,349
- Really?
- Yeah.

367
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,650
God.

368
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,286
<i>Who sang
"the rain in Spain?"</i>

369
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,455
<i>- "The rain in Spain?"
- See.. So... so again..</i>

370
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,790
<i>- Circles within circles.
- Yeah.</i>

371
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,141
It's like we sailed
into Switzerland.

372
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,285
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello, hello, uh..

373
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,487
Uh, who's that?

374
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,355
It's Jonathan, Matt's assistant.

375
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,457
This is Steve Coogan
for Matt, please?

376
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,793
<i>Oh, hey, Steve.
Hey, yeah.</i>

377
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,162
<i>Um, look, I was just
gonna call you</i>

378
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,764

to let you know that</i>

379
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,632
<i>Matt has left the agency.</i>

380
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,434
Uh, what?

381
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,469
Yeah, he's gone
to a management company.

382
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,538
<i>Look, it... it... it all
happened very quickly</i>

383
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,840
<i>and, um, well, no one wanted it</i>

384
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,842
<i>to get out
before it was announced.</i>

385
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,611
Uh, it's gonna be
in the "trades" today.

386
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,914
<i>So I will be taking
over all Matt's clients</i>

387
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,050
who stay with the agency, okay?

388
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,284
And, Steve, I just..

389
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,187
I wanna let you know
how excited I am

390
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,022

No, I'm in Spain with Rob.

Uh, look, Greg, did you know

419
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:29,734
that Matt
had left the us agency?

420
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,170
Yes, yes, I did, um,
yes, I did know that.

421
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,538
I was... I was gonna
call you actually.

422
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,506
Did you know about this
before I did?

423
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,441
<i>No. No, not at all, no.</i>

424
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,277
Right. And do you know
that his assistant

425
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,546
Jonathan is taking over
his client list?

426
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,081
Yes. Now, you see, Jonathan, I
I think, he's very good.

427
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,350
I think he's very bright.
So, you know..

428
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,520
Uh, what's happening
with Matt's other clients?

And, um, uh, will Ferrell.

432
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,764
Did he ask Ricky to go with him?

433
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,232
<i>Yes. Yeah, he did.</i>

434
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,934
But he didn't ask me.

435
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,702
Yeah, but you see, I think
you... you... you're seen

436
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,071
more, more as a writer, Steve.

437
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,140
I mean, so you wouldn't, you
wouldn't really sort of need

438
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,642
a manager as well
as an agent, so..

439
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,010
So which clients are staying

440
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,112
with the... with the
new assistant?

441
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,981
Uh, Kevin Kline.

442
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,885
I can't really see him
going anywhere else. Um..

443
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,421
Um, look.. Uh, Greg

444
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,555
would you do... do me
a favor please?

445
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,692
Can you find out
w... why the script

446
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:31,028
for "missing"
hasn't been green-lit yet?

447
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,964
Uh, that hasn't happened.
I mean, that absolutely..

448
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,765
I know, that should've happened.
I will get on to that.

449
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,334
I'll get on to that
straight away, that, yeah.

Thank you.

- And a bowl of butter.
- Thank you.

474

They are homemade.

475
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,433
We have buffaloes

Victor makes the fresh cheese.

- She was saying it in English.
- That they get..

482
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,447
Yeah, but when you're...
You're hearing

483
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:59,283
I've noticed your hearing
is not what it was.

484
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,451
Do you mind me saying that?

485
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:03,454
Listen, stop distracting
y-you and me

486
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:06,090
from the fact that
your Spanish is appalling.

487
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,125
I think what you were
trying to do before was..

488
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,436
Sorry, my, my..

489
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,007
Bloody, bloody batteries.

490
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,312
Wait, wait, I can't, uh, it's
it's, it's playin' up.

491
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,314
Hang on, hang on.

492
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,349
Right. Try it again.

493
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,684
Oh! Shit!

494
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,219
Steve, wait, wait.
I can't hear a word, mate.

495
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,921
It's... it's,
it's the batteries.

496
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:40,224
Steve, Steve, I can't
hear anything. Ssh!

497
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:43,527
Steve, Steve, stop, wait.
I have got to..

498
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,730
- Very good.
- Okay...

499
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,465
But you still
can't do this, can you?

500
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,700
No matter how hard you
try, you'll never be able

501
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,369
to do the small man in a box.

502
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,072
Whereas, I think that your man,
small man in a box is brilliant.

503
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:58,209
It is also the apotheosis
of your career.

504
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,982
Hm.

505
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,185
- Incredible.
- <i>Hm. Sum it up for me.</i>

506
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,988
The butter
is life-affirming butter.

507
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,291
Life-affirming butter.
L-a-b.

508
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,928
<i>The buffalo?</i>

509
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,867
- Wow.
- <i>Wow.</i>

510
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,281
This one
is the homemade chorizo.

511
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:40,518
We buy Iberian pork meat
from salamanca

512
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,088
and Victor makes the chorizo
like his grandmother.

513
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,490
- <i>Wow.</i>
- It's same chorizo.

514
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:49,593
Just cooked or cured.

515
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,095
- Cooked or cured.
- <i>And..</i>

516
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,931
<i>And one corn croquette.</i>

517
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,433
- <i>Muchas Gracias.</i>
- You are welcome.

518
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,067
<i>Encantada.</i>

519
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,539
When she said he makes
chorizo like his grandmother

520
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,742
is that what she looked like?

521
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,445
No, Rob, he means the way his
grandmother used to make it.

522
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:10,314
<i>Fine, well, I think
she should be more clear.</i>

523
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:13,083
Because I'm picturing
a grizzled old woman

524
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,586
with the external
appearance of chorizo.

525
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,822
<i>Well, you're the only
person who is, mate.</i>

526
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,723
- <i>Now.</i>
- Mm.

527
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,596
- Fantastic. Hm.
- Hm. Wow.

528
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:28,799
Hang on, if his grandmother
tasted like this..

529
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,401
<i>I'd have a nibble.</i>

530
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,140
Come, come, Mr. Coogan.
Come come.

531
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,810
You're beginning to thaw,
sir, beginning to thaw.

532
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,346
No, I will laugh at stuff
if it's good.

533
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,687
Oh, me shoulder.

534
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,155
What have you done to it?

535
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,457
Just getting out of bed in
the morning, just pulled it.

536
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,992
You can't rush out of bed.

537
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,760
You've gotta.. You know,
what I've been told to do?

538
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,929
Stretch while lying down.

539
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,891
- Before you get out the bed.
- Good to rotate it.

540
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,568
You look like a tentative Nazi.

541
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:11,475
Uh, I think what we're
doing, you know, is so wrong

542
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:14,278
on so many levels,
but that just can't stop.

543
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,881
Why are your Nazis so camp?

544
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:20,317
- Oh, I'm a Nazi. Oh.
- You tell me,<i> fuhrer.</i>

545
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,720
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

546
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,355
- Was he furious?
- Mm, he will be.

547
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,529
Hey, we continue.

548
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,197
Green mussels.

549
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,166
- Oh.
- With carrot juice.

550
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:39,136
- Carrot juice?
- Yes.

551
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,170
<i>Bueno.</i>

552
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,110
- Oh, no, no, Steve.
- Oh!

553
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,811
- Look, look.
- I know.

554
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,213
But what do we do?
We, we..

555
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,948
- You just take one.
- Alright.

556
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,387
Mmm. Wow.

557
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,822
Well, here it is, Mr. Coogan.
We managed to get it out.

558
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:03,193
Um, I mean, the good
news is it's benign.

559
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:06,230
The bad news is we found
seven more of them.

560
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,833
Some of them have gone
into the lymph nodes.

561
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,242
Are you gonna read that
book while we eat lunch

562
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,511
or you just brought it
as a sort of badge?

563
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:23,847
No, I brought it because I'm..

564
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,116
Um, I'm emulating his journey.

"As I walked out
one summer morning.."

566
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,053
What would your version be?

567
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:30,955
"As I drove out
one summer morning

568
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,190
in my v8 Land Rover."

569
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,526
- Range rover.
- Range rover. Sorry, sorry.

570
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:37,995
- That's a terrible mistake.
- Yeah.

571
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,230
<i>How much have you read?</i>

572
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,132
Um, about quarter.

573
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,774
- But he's very good...
- It's a big book.

574
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,678
- Good lord, another one.
- One Sauvignon Blanc.

575
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,213
Ah, yes.

576
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:59,984
To drink with
the grilled scallops.

577
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:02,419
- <i>Ah.</i>
- The caviar is from Iran.

578
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,921
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Enjoy.

579
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:06,624
<i>Estupendo.
Iranian caviar.</i>

580
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,692
Please. Go first.

581
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:11,195
<i>No, no, no. Please.
You go first.</i>

582
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,998
Well, before I do, Scaramanga

583
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,634
why don't I turn them that way?

584
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:20,371
In which case should you
have interfered with my...

585
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:22,406
In my country,
it is always traditional

586
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:26,543
that the nearest scallop
is served to the guest.

587
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,880
Where I come from,
it is a custom

588
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:33,684
to proffer the largest scallop

589
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,319
to the guest.

590
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,388
In my country
when such an offer is made

591
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,158
it is traditional to turn
the plate round twice..

592
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,127
And replace it on the table.

593
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,230
Come, come, Mr. bond.

594
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:49,066
You enjoy the scallop
just as much as I do.

595
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:50,901
<i>Please eat.</i>

596
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,284
Bottoms up.

597
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,357
Goodbye, Mr. bond.

598
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,461
Mr. bond, goodbye.

599
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,834
You should pay more
attention to your chef.

600
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,476
He's working for
her majesty's government.

601
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:39,917
Starter for ten. What is
the Camino De Santiago?

602
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,085
<i>- Um..
- No?</i>

603
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,553
<i>"The pilgrims' route</i>

I met, I went to the ultimate
pilgrimage to see the pope.

00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,435
I went there with "Philomena"

00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,204
and introduced
"Philomena" to the pope.

611

And we welcome "Philomena"
back into the conversation.

612
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,408
It's been a good
five to six minutes

since he last brought it up.

614
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,311
But, no, no, go on.
Always nice to hear.

615

- Well, I mean, you know..
- <i>So you were there for, so what...</i>

616
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,048
I can't, I can't pretend
it's not been

617
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,449
a significant part of my
life, but there you go.

618
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,184
Can't pretend it's not
been a significant part

619
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,819
of this bloody journey.

620
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,743
This is nice, isn't it?

621
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,278
- Wonderful.
- Lovely.

622
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,015
You look like the man, the
man who'd follow James Bond

623
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:48,418
at a distance in, uh, one
of the Sean Connery films.

624
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,887
- One of the early films.
- But would never say anything.

625
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:52,089
- Yeah. Yes.
- Never speak. You're mysterious.

626
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,559
- Sinister figure.
- Sinister figure following him. Yeah.

627
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:59,129
Sos Del Rey catolico.
Now what does that mean?

628
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,499
Uh, Del Rey is the reign,
uh, catholic reign.

629
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,002
So it's the Sos
of the catholic king.

630
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:08,539
Um, because that's where king
Ferdinand was born here.

631
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:09,807
- Right here?
- Right here.

632
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,642
Well, not here, but
you know, around there.

633
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,310
He... he introduced
the Spanish inquisition?

634
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,711
- Yes, indeed.
- Are you sure about that?

635
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,780
He was a catalytic
converter in a way.

636
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:19,016
<i>- Very good. You're on fire.</i>
- Cheers.

637
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:25,155
You'd actually make
a very good inquisitor

638
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,824
I think, for
the Spanish inquisition.

639
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,193
<i>Don't take this the wrong way.
You have an inquisitive nature...</i>

640
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,661
Mind, an inquisitive mind, yeah.

641
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,130
And you have a cruel side.
You do have a cruel side.

642
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,865
Well, it's not... it's only
a short leap, isn't it

643
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:37,901
from... from curiosity
to, uh

644
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,636
murderous intent?

645
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,139
I mean, ah,
it's quite a large leap.

646
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,974
<i>- It's a very large leap.</i>
- It's a big leap.

647
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,343
If I was questioning you
and you're on the rack

648
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,346
I'd start with some
simple questions like..

649
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,448
I'd just say, okay,
just warm meself up.

650
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,883
Like just give me
your name, address

651
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:53,917
tell me what you had
for breakfast?

652
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,219
- Rob Brydon.
- Yeah.

653
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,320
<i>- London.</i>
- Yeah?

654
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:57,654
And what did you have
for breakfast?

655
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,756
- Scrambled eggs.
- Lovely stuff, okay.

656
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,358
- Uh, Rob...
- is that it? Can I go now?

657
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,693
No, no, no. I'm gonna ask
you a few more questions.

658
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,061
Just, uh, just take it easy.

659
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:05,696
- Um..
- Oh, I can't, it's really hurting...

660
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:08,966
Uh, what is your favorite
kind of music?

661
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,335
- Bruce Springsteen.
- Okay, alright, okay.

662
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,337
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

663
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,073
Um, how many baftas
have you won?

664
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:17,574
- What?
- How many baftas have you won?

665
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,209
I can't hear you. Ah.

666
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,478
Okay, okay, just give
it another notch...

667
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,413
- Aah! I got a welsh one.
- How many baftas..

668
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,983
Oh, well, one welsh bafta.
Thank you.

669
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,551
You see, how easy that was?

670
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,254
Do you see how easy it was
to answer the question?

671
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,889
Okay. Now.

672
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,657
I've been nominated seven
times for the normal ones.

673
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,858
That, I didn't ask you that.

674
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,094
- Notch, give another notch.
- Aah!

675
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,829
- Well, how tall is he?
- Uh..

676
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:42,065
- 5... 5'8" and a half.
- Oh. Ooh, really?

677
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,500
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ooh. Ooh.

678
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,903
It's not bad, eh?
Okay.

679
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:48,472
Now one more question that
you won't want to answer

680
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,506
'cause I'm trying
to get you up to 5'9".

681
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:52,109
I'm on your side here.
Okay?

682
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,844
Do you wanna, do you wanna
quit at 5'8"?

683
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:54,359
No.

684
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,946
5'8" and a half or do you
wanna go for the 5'9"?

685
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,981
- 5'9".
- He is gonna go for the 5 foot 9.

686
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,816
Okay, one more question.

687
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,385
- Rob?
- Yeah.

688
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:05,555
Do you believe
in the lord god almighty?

689
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,090
I'd rather not say.

690
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,659
- Aah!
- Give it another couple of notches.

691
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,093
And we have 5'9".

692
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,495
- Ah, thanks!
<i>- Rob Brydon, let him go.</i>

693
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:15,098
You leave here as a 5'9" man.
Congratulations.

694
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,234
Thank you, Steve.
Ooh, I've hit my head.

695
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,402
<i>There you go,
that's gonna be a problem</i>

696
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:19,803
you're gonna have to
contend with now.

697
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,038
You just have to let
your trousers down too.

698
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,273
Ladies and gentlemen,
Rob Brydon.

699
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,624
<i>This is the area that
Terry Gilliam was in</i>

700
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,326
<i>when he was trying to do
"don Quixote."</i>

701
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,995
"Lost in la mancha"
is the documentary

702
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,329
about his failure to do so.

703
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,531
And it's a show
I would like to do.

704
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,100
- <i>"Man of la mancha."</i>
- "Lost in la mancha?"

705
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:25,535
<i>Or "man of la mancha" is
the... the stage musical.</i>

706
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,071
It might be my next
theatrical venture.

707
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,406
- Really?
<i>- Yes.</i>

708
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,675
You get to sing
"the impossible dream."

709
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,780
<i>Given that this is Rioja</i>

710
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:39,816
<i>I would've thought we'd
see a lot more vines.</i>

711
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,351
It's of no interest
to me these days, Rob

712
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,521
because I no longer
drink alcohol.

713
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,024
I like wine.
I like Rioja.

714
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,963
What's with all
the dinosaur signs?

715
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,564
I suppose there's
lots of dinosaurs

716
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,933
that used to live around here.

717
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,502
I say we visit

718
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,937
'cause Chloe loves dinosaurs.

719
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,407
<i>- Who's Chloe?
- My daughter.</i>

720
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,674
Oh.

721
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,079
I'm gonna put my boots on.

722
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,815
- <i>Putting your boots on?</i>
- Yeah, dusty.

723
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,716
We're only going there.

724
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,390
Love these boots.

725
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:54,791
Those, yeah, no,
they're... they're good

726
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,793
uh, intermediate
walking shoes those.

727
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,595
But, uh, you couldn't attach

728
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,797
crampons if there was any ice.

729
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,400
Well, I don't plan
to go on any ice.

730
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:06,303
No one plans for ice, Rob,
you've gotta be prepared...

731
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:07,871
Hey!

732
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:10,740
You see? That's not, not very
good for scree work either.

733
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,645
You just gotta be decisive
about where you put your feet

734
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,013
that's all.

735
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:23,353
Do a picture of me

736
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,855
with the dinosaur.

737
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,995
Which one's the dinosaur?

738
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:37,234
<i>Okay, uh, seeing as
the dinosaur's doing</i>

739
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:41,638
a McCartney-style thumbs up,
then why don't you mimic that.

740
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,975
Hey. Rock and roll.

741
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:49,246
I mean, Ringo, he was actually
a good drummer, you know?

742
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,148
What's that... what's
that dinosaur called?

743
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,317
- Barney.
- No, it's a t-Rex.

744
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,487
It's actually not,
it's a Iguanodon.

745
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,855
How do you know?

746
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,390
Throw the phone?

747
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:03,360
Because, um, Chloe is an expert.

748
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:04,461
Well, tell me this

749
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:05,896
why, uh, they changed the name

750
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:08,532
of a brontosaurus
to a Brachiosaurus.

751
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,000
<i>No one's given me an...</i>

752
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,870
The brontosaurus which would
previously roam the lands...

753
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,805
- <i>who's that?</i>
- It's John hurt.

754
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,741
- That's not John hurt.
- Who is it then?

755
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:20,277
<i>Well, I don't know, but if you're
gonna do John hurt, you have to, um..</i>

756
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:25,215
The brach.. The Brachiosaurus
would once roam the land.

757
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,884
The king of all he surveyed.

758
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,186
That's a very good John hurt.

759
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,189
King of all he surveyed.

760
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:35,458
It's a combination of him as..

761
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,629
Quentin crisp and
Caligula in "I, Claudius."

762
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,231
<i>- Why are you standing...</i>
- you can go away now, Rob.

763
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:44,534
I was thinking of killing you,
but I've changed my mind.

764
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,905
<i>So does Chloe, uh,
know about the different</i>

765
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,174
uh, prehistoric periods?

766
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,676
Yep.

767
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,477
Not, you know, she..

768
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,147
- Does she know Triassic?
- Like she can sit an exam but...

769
00:36:57,149 --> 00:37:00,450
Jurassic? Cretaceous?

770
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,352
She knows some of those.
She knows the words.

771
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,688
I'm not gonna pretend
that she could

772
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,756
take a, give a lecture.

773
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,392
Of course in the..

774
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,328
In the Triassic period,
there's only

775
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,097
the... the world was
one land mass

776
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,799
just with the sea,
and that was it.

777
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:18,969
One... one body of land and
then in the Jurassic period

778
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:21,204
split into two big lumps
of land.

779
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,742
And then the, finally the
cretaceous, it broke up

780
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,744
into the continents
that we know today.

781
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,085
Look at that.

782
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,786
They're the actual footprints.

783
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,521
Quite big, aren't they?

784
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,657
What size are your feet?

785
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:41,891
Seven.

786
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,761
- Really?
- Yeah.

787
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,897
Go on then, off you go.

788
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,499
No, it's just that,
that is quite...

789
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,001
- They're too small.
- Quite feminine.

790
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,636
They are feminine, I know.

791
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,537
- I'm not gonna...
- Small feet.

792
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,873
Nice on a woman,
a bit weird on a bloke.

793
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,209
- Indeed.
- Yeah.

794
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,878
If I could change
one thing about me

795
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,580
well, it wouldn't be
the feet, but I would

796
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:05,515
I would, I would get to
the feet quite soon.

797
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,017
It'd be feet, height
and hair, wouldn't it?

798
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:10,020
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

799
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,303
- Ah!
- Oh!

800
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,439
<i>Pimientos Del Cristal
asados a la Lena.</i>

801
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,574
<i>- Gracias.
- Muchos Gracias.</i>

802
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:32,709
<i>Muchos, muchos Gracias.</i>

803
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:34,177
<i>Un poquito mas De vino Le pongo.</i>

804
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,782
Well?

805
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,784
- No, thank you.
<i>- Vale.</i>

806
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,821
- What was he asking?
- If you wanted some more wine.

807
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,897
Mm. Mm!

808
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,632
Terrible year in many ways.

809
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:58,435
If you think about the number
of the people who've died.

810
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,937
- I mean, gifted people.
- Yeah.

811
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,506
David bowie's death was like..

812
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,008
What did Tony Visconti say?

813
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,110
"It was a... it was an
artistic act, his death."

814
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,912
Yeah. Well, it was...
It was remarkable.

815
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,780
No funeral. He literally
just went poof.

816
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,882
Had a song called "Lazarus"
on his... on his last record.

817
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,051
Yeah, it was wonderful.
It was actually brilliant.

818
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,653
Yeah, it was.
It was admirable.

819
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,421
I told you about the time
he was on the radio

820
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:22,392
and, uh, he wanted to mention me
but couldn't remember my name.

821
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,861
- Really?
- Mm.

822
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,929
He was being interviewed

823
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,164
and, uh, the interviewer said

824
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:31,034
"wha... what'd you do
when you're, um..

825
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,103
On tour on the bus?"

826
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:35,605
And he said he watched "cruise
of the gods," that we did.

827
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,875
And he said, "you know the
one, it stars that guy."

828
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,543
- Really?
- And he said, "who?" Yeah, he said, "who?"

829
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,313
And I was in the kitchen,
like, "oh, my god!"

830
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:44,581
"He's about to mention me.
David bowie."

831
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,116
- Sure he didn't mean me?
- No, no, no.

832
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:48,852
Because he said, "you know, the
one from "Marion and Geoff.""

833
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:51,354
- Really? He said "Marion and Geoff?"
- Yes, yes.

834
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:53,256
Yeah, and I... I was
going, "it's me, it's me."

835
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:54,491
And the interviewer was going

836
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:57,093
"no, I... I don't know,
I don't know."

837
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,628
So he never said my name

838
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,931
but he was thinking
of my face at that moment.

839
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,135
And when he died, I looked
at his Twitter feed

840
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:06,302
and you know what, Steve?

841
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:10,306
- He followed me on Twitter.
- Really?

842
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,342
You don't know what to do with
that information, do you?

843
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:14,144
Well, no disrespect to you

844
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:17,113
but he's just ever,
ever so slightly

845
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,883
I mean, microscopically
diminished

846
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,618
in my mind.

847
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,120
Just think and I know
you won't like this.

848
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,189
There would've been a time
when he sat there

849
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,658
with his phone and went..

850
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,255
And he would've pressed
on that button and clicked

851
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:02,358
and followed me
and seen every tweet.

852
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,379
Hm.

853
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,249
<i>Now as you know,
this was a moors castle.</i>

854
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:28,485
And when it was conquered
by the Christian

855
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,787
it became the...
The official residence

856
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,489
of the Siguenzas bishop.

857
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,724
- Please, after you.
- Thank you.

858
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:36,459
You're welcome.

859
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:39,295
And during the civil war,
the town was bombarded

860
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,764
by the condor legion

861
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,666
and the castle was hit.

862
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:47,136
- Like Como en Guernica?
- Yeah, like Guernica.

863
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,606
Um, the last resistance
of the town

864
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:51,574
took place in the cathedral

865
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,009
and it was bombarded too.

866
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,511
And they surrender because

867
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,980
they didn't have
any more ammunition or...

868
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,548
Yes, of course, wow.

869
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,016
The final attack.

870
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,620
Over there, we have, uh

871
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:07,490
a room that was a setting
for a Marlon Brando's movie

872
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:10,026
in the early '90s.

873
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,062
He played the role of,
uh, friar Torquemada.

874
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,864
He was
the grand inquisitor of...

875
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,699
Of course,
the Spanish inquisition.

876
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,769
- Yeah.
- "Nobody expects that!"

877
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:23,439
<i>Mi amigo Le Gusta Monty python.</i>

878
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,109
- I love them too.
- Oh, yeah? Wow!

879
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:27,544
- Please, after you.
- To the left.

880
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:29,178
Yes, of course.

881
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,814
<i>- This is Jonathan.</i>

882

883
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:37,220

884
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:40,723
<i>Yeah, I'm great. So listen,
I spoke to the studio.</i>

885
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,159

886
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,295
<i>They're totally

- What?
- <i>Well, it's for a Polish.</i>

892
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:56,239
<i>It's just for a Polish.
It's..</i>

893
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,707
Hey, how are we doing?

<i>- Hello, how are you?</i>

Ah. Oh,
where'd you get that?

896
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,948
<i>I found it here.</i>

897
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,182
I thought you'd lost that.

898
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,450
Thought I'd hidden it.

899
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:10,587
- Who?
- <i>Ed Hirsch.</i>

900
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:13,056
I don't.. Who's he? Never heard of him.
What's he done?

901
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:15,925
He's written a few scripts that have
really just gotten a lotta heat.

902
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,760
Look over here! Charlie!

903
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,329
I'm here, look!

904
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,364
Look at the little fella down..
There, hello.

905
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:24,434
<i>He's new, he's hot,
he's up-and-coming.</i>

906
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:28,371
Which, uh, do you.. I've got...
I've got two Oscar nominations.

907
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:31,007
I'm... I'm... I'm new
and I'm not up-and-coming.

908
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:33,176
I've... I've arrived.

909
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,416
Ah..

910
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:42,619
Good evening.

911
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:45,855
- Good evening.
<i>- Buenos tardes.</i>

912
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,091
Isn't it a magnificent room?

913
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,892
It's the Brando room.

914
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,929
I just watched a little
clip on YouTube of him.

915
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:56,966
But you can't really work
out exactly where they are.

916
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,535
He's very overweight
at that stage.

917
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:02,672
Yeah, which is fine
for, uh, Torquemada.

918
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,041
Gives him presence.

919
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,410
I was playing Torquemada

920
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:10,079
in the Spanish inquisition.

921
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:13,383
Nobody expects
Spanish inquisition.

922
00:44:13,385 --> 00:44:14,417
Nobody does.

923
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:16,052
Amongst all weaponry

924
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,487
are such diverse elements

925
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,656
as fear, surprise,
a ruthless efficiency

926
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:21,991
and an almost fanatical
devotion to the pope

927
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,127
and that's with uniforms.

928
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:27,597
Nobody expects
a Spanish inquisition.

929
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,400
Amongst all weaponry and fear

930
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:33,736
surprise, a ruthless efficiency

931
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:36,606
and an almost
fanatical devotion...

932
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,675
- you're doing him in "the godfather."
- What?

933
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:41,144
- You're just doing...
- <i>I was doing '70s Brando.</i>

934
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:43,479
Well, he spoke like this,
kinda nasal.

935
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,816
You know what, his voice was a
little higher the way he spoke.

936
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:49,452
It was, you know

937
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,220
it was like that, you know...

938
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:53,723
You've got a De Niro thing going.
You're doing your De Niro.

939
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:56,592
If I, if I was doing De Niro,
I'd do it like that, you know?

940
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,529
That's the way, that's the
way De Niro spoke, you know?

941
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,364
Let's do something
about that, you know.

942
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,465
That's right, you know
what I'm gonna do?

943
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:03,566
I'm gonna rip
your head off, shit down

944
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:04,801
your goddamn fuckin' neck

945
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:06,936
you two-bit dick suckin'
motherfuckin' asshole.

946
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,805
- That's terrific. That's terrific.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

947
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:11,007
The reason you think I'm doing
De Niro when I'm doing Brando

948
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:14,010
is because De Niro himself
was influenced by Brando.

949
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:16,646
So, when De Niro acts

950
00:45:16,648 --> 00:45:20,850
you see a residual element
of Brando in what he does.

951
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:21,951
So, you've got
it the wrong way round.

952
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:24,420
So in attempting
to criticize you

953
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,988
I've inadvertently
complimented you.

954
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,857
You've shown up some
of the detail in Brando...

955
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:31,461
You certainly came out on
top in this exchange then.

956
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:34,530
I am only telling you the truth.

957
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,467
Nobody expects
a Spanish inquisition

958
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:40,269
and nobody expects
a comfy chair.

959
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,538
No, he's gotta do the, get..

960
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,676
The comfy chair.

961
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:49,879
Get the comfy chair.

962
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,317
I'm like a turtle, look at me.

963
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,720
Get the comfy chair.

964
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:00,690
Get the comfy chair
and a piece of lettuce.

965
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:02,158
<i>I'm gettin' hungry.</i>

966
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,761
Amongst our weaponry is..

967
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,063
Such diverse elements the..

968
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,564
- Woody Allen. Yeah.
- I know, Woody Allen.

969
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,733
Amongst our weaponry

970
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:14,871
is such diverse elements
as fear.

971
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:19,375
Uh, surprise, an... an
almost fanatical devotion

972
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:20,943
to the Yankees.

973
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:22,879
Ehh.

974
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,827
Do you wish to confess?

975
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,663
No.

976
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,068
You know all Jews were
told to leave the country

977
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,771
by order of the
catholic king and queen.

978
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:52,175
Yes, but, mm, I'm not a Jew.

979
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:55,745
My lord, I'm... I'm a catholic,
Roman catholic, sir.

980
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:59,182
If you're catholic, then you
must respect my authority.

981
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:01,017
My authority
comes from the pope.

982
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,219
I've met the pope.

983
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,620
My lord, I met the pope.

984
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:07,690
I met his holiness
at the Vatican

985
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:10,660
and he saw a film I made.

986
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,628
- You're lying.
- <i>I'm telling the truth, my lord.</i>

987
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,330
<i>I... I, he didn't,
he didn't see the film</i>

988
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:18,034
but his advisers did, and they
gave him a breakdown of the film

989
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:20,236
and he approved it.

990
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:22,471
You're a, you're a heretic.

991
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:25,608
My lord, I am not a heretic, I
am not Jewish, I am not Muslim.

992
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,510
I am a Roman catholic,
I... I promise you.

993
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,545
I don't know "the Quran," I
hardly know the old testament.

994
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,081
<i>I, I was an altar boy, um...</i>

995
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,683
Shh.

996
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,453
Do you respect my authority?

997
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:43,326
- Well, uh..
- Do you respect my authority?

998
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:46,095
<i>- Why... why are you mumbling?
- I'm what?</i>

999
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,264
What did you say?

1000
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:50,833
<i>You're not enunciating, anuncio.</i>

1001
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:53,135
I'm sorry, Esteban.

1002
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:56,105
Do you respect my authority?

1003
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,276
Yes, I, yes, I respect
your authority.

1004
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:02,445
Take him away.

1005
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:03,713
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

1006
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,348
What's going to happen now?

1007
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,516
I'm not.. I've not done
anything. I haven't..

1008
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:09,418
Why, why are they
taking me backwards?

1009
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,820
I have not done anything.

1010
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:12,955
I'm, I'm catholic.

1011
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,100
Hey, guess where I'm taking Joe

1012
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,402
uh, at the end of this week?

1013
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,206
There, look.

1014
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:33,109
- <i>Zip wire.
- Yeah, longest one in Spain.</i>

1015
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:34,277
- <i>Have you done this already?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

1016
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,445
<i>I've done about five in the UK</i>

1017
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,514
<i>couple in Europe.</i>

1018
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:41,317
Word of warning. What's
the age limit on this?

1019
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:42,985
There's no age limit.
As long as you're fit.

1020
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,187
Uh, there's
a height restriction.

1021
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:47,256
Well, we were in Italy last year

1022
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,058
and there was
whitewater rafting.

1023
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,326
Yeah.

1024
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:52,895
So I thought I'd check out

1025
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,463
you know, the age.

1026
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:59,135
Eight to fifty-five.

1027
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,500
So by the time Charlie's
old enough to do it...

1028
00:49:00,512 --> 00:49:00,970
what?

1029
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:02,605
- That's ridiculous.
- I'll be too old.

1030
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,407
- I know.
- <i>Fifty-five?</i>

1031
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:07,843
- <i>That's ridiculous.</i>
- Why can you not whitewater raft at 55?

1032
00:49:07,845 --> 00:49:10,179
I might get some fake ID
or something like that.

1033
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,715
Yeah, you'll have to get
a fake ID like a teenager.

1034
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:16,118
Uh, John Jones, born in 1970.

1035
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,054
I'm... I'm a carpenter
from Wrexham.

1036
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:19,922
- You say you're a carpenter?
- That's right.

1037
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:21,991
Simple question.

1038
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:25,127
You're building a bog standard

1039
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,097
uh, tongue and groove,
glue and peg

1040
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,498
wooden bench for outside.

1041
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,033
What kind of wood do you choose

1042
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:33,836
if you want it to weather
into a nice silvery patina?

1043
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:36,105
Ash, beech, teak?

1044
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,709
Simple question.

1045
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:40,843
Better hurry,
there's other people

1046
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:42,979
who wanna get on
this whitewater raft.

1047
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:46,315
Um, could you
tell me the woods again?

1048
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,817
Ash, teak, beech.

1049
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,385
- Ash, teak, beech?
- Hm.

1050
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,655
Beech?

1051
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,523
Na, mate.
It's teak.

1052
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:57,226
Any carpenter worth his
salt will tell you that.

1053
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:58,728
- Don't cry, Charlie.
- You're not..

1054
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,396
- You're not a carpenter, mate.
- Please, let us go on.

1055
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:01,731
It's the only chance
I've got to...

1056
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:04,100
On your way.

1057
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:06,002
Don't cry, Charlie, don't cry.

1058
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:07,770
Maybe mommy can take you.

1059
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:09,205
Look at the boy, he's crying.

1060
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,873
Oh, how old, how old are ya?

1061
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,541
- What?
- How old are you?

1062
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,343
I'm 56.

1063
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,545
Oh, for Christ's sake,
go on, on you.. Get on.

1064
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:18,280
Thanks a lot. Oh!

1065
00:50:18,282 --> 00:50:20,082
Oh, I got shooting pains
down my arm.

1066
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:23,152
Don't tell me that. I've just
broken the rules for you, nob.

1067
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:26,155
Give me a minute.
I've gone light-headed.

1068
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:27,490
Alright, thank you.

1069
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:29,992
Come on, Charlie.
Not so fast, son.

1070
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:35,398
Oh, you know, um,
walking downhill

1071
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,233
very good
if you engage your abs.

1072
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,434
Yeah, of course.

1073
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:41,203
Um, and, if you engage
your abdominals

1074
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,873
it takes the pressure off
your knees.

1075
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,341
Who told you that?

1076
00:50:45,343 --> 00:50:47,877
It's just, you can feel it
anatomically.

1077
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,178
I figured it out.

1078
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,746
Hardly stand up to a
focus group, would it?

1079
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,248
Well, you wouldn't show it
to a focus group...

1080
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,116
Clinical trials. It wouldn't
stand up to clinical trials.

1081
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:55,451
Exactly. Wouldn't show it
to a focus...

1082
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,286
Clinical trial, that's why
I said clinical trials.

1083
00:50:57,288 --> 00:50:59,355
Okay, yeah. You don't need clinical trial.
It's just..

1084
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:01,524
If you, if you listen to your
body, you can figure it out.

1085
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:03,159
It's just like a shock
absorber, so the knee

1086
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,261
doesn't have to take
all the... all the impact.

1087
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,197
Wow.

1088
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:12,935
Big.

1089
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,537
Bigger than it looks
from outside.

1090
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:16,705
Hey, take your hats off
in church.

1091
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,376
Frowned upon.

1092
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,513
I'm trying to find out
where the bomb damage is.

1093
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:26,615
From, uh, you know..

1094
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,617
From when Franco and the Nazis..

1095
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,487
Exhibition there with
Cervantes and Shakespeare.

1096
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:32,988
There, look!

1097
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,990
Why would they have the two
of them in one exhibition?

1098
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:37,526
They both died in the same year.

1099
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:40,262
It seems they've done
a very good repair job.

1100
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,864
I can't see any damage.

1101
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:45,434
Or maybe it wasn't this part
of it that got damaged.

1102
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,737
The... the workmanship of
this is a, is a testament to

1103
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:51,407
to all the workers
who helped construct it

1104
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:53,209
and yet Franco, very happy

1105
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,644
despite claiming to be
a catholic to bomb

1106
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,080
the shit out
of a religious building

1107
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:02,184
which just shows you what
kind of a vandal he was.

1108
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:04,887
We're having flooring just
like this in the kitchen.

1109
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,059
- Partner's there.
- Yeah.

1110
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:13,062
Buried, lying next
to each other..

1111
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:14,563
For eternity.

1112
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:33,349
"First collected edition of
Shakespeare's works. 1623."

1113
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:36,519
So in the '60s, seven
years after he's dead

1114
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:38,554
already they realized
what they'd lost.

1115
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,394
Rob. Rob!

1116
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:47,696
"Electronic '80s
album cover."

1117
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,199
Very good.

1118
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,236
I'm holding my stomach in
while I do this.

1119
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:57,640
Just walking downhill is actually
better for that, you know?

1120
00:52:57,642 --> 00:53:00,876
Yeah, but I, I hold it in
pretty much all the time now.

1121
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,288
Would you ever do
Shakespeare on the stage?

1122
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,357
I would have liked to have
played "Hamlet."

1123
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,128
That train has left the station.

1124
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,196
Who would you like to play now?

1125
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,730
Olivier played him
when he was 42.

1126
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,200
Olivier was a better actor
than you.

1127
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,935
- Well, a different actor.
- A better actor.

1128
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:28,070
A different actor.

1129
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:30,606
- <i>"King Lear?"</i>
- He's an old man.

1130
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,041
He's not that old.
He's a father.

1131
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,209
You've got more
in common with him

1132
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:35,244
than you have with a teenager.

1133
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:45,387
Have you lost something?

1134
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,956
She is gone forever.

1135
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,894
I know when one is living
and one is dead.

1136
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,431
And she's dead as earth.

1137
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,635
Lend me a looking glass..

1138
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,705
That if her breath..

1139
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,607
A mist of stain the stone..

1140
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,510
Why then she lives.

1141
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,946
Very good.

1142
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,648
Very good.
"Midsomer murders."

1143
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,650
<i>You're a, you're a father
who's just been told</i>

1144
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:16,452
his daughter's been killed
in a road accident

1145
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:17,586
and that is effective

1146
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,822
and we're straight into
the adverts after that.

1147
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:24,460
I have of late though
wherefore I know not

1148
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:26,996
lost all my mirth, forgone
all custom of exercise

1149
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:29,798
and indeed it goes so
heavily my disposition

1150
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,767
that this goodly frame
the earth, look you

1151
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:35,037
this fine o'er hanging
firmament the sky

1152
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:38,374
it seems nothing to me, but a
foul congregation of vapors.

1153
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,175
Aa-ha-ha.

1154
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:42,511
"Jumpin' Jack flash."

1155
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:46,915
Stones do Shakespeare, come on.

1156
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:51,287
Oh, oh, that is too,
too solid flesh

1157
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:55,424
would melt and resolve
itself into a Jew.

1158
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:58,694
All that the everlasting
not fixed his canon

1159
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,729
against self-slaughter.

1160
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,533
Has Russell brand
ever done Shakespeare?

1161
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,903
- Oh, god, god.
- Mick Jagger. You're doing Mick Jagger.

1162
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,905
- You're doing Mick Jagger.
- <i>Well, I, uh..</i>

1163
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,073
What a, um,
what you saying? Aah.

1164
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:12,374
<i>Ha, what's that?</i>

1165
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:14,410
- Alright then. Huh.
- Huh. Huh.

1166
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:16,278
That's not Mick Jagger.
That's a lot of noises.

1167
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,280
Ah, Steve, how you doing?
You alright?

1168
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,482
What it's no, if you..
Quiet, quiet, let me do it.

1169
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,318
No, no, you, you can't do.

1170
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,986
You're copying Morrissey,
and it isn't like that.

1171
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,721
That's all gay.
He goes like that.

1172
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:27,256
What piece of work, he's a man.

1173
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:28,924
He goes really deep sometimes

1174
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:30,426
and you can't get down there.

1175
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:31,827
You can only go up there.

1176
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,829
You need to go up and down
to do him properly.

1177
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,798
You saying
I can't get down there?

1178
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,533
You're seriously saying
I can't get down there?

1179
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:40,095
No, that's not.. I was just saying
that you're a bad Mick Jagger.

1180
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,187
<i>- Gracias.
- Muchas Gracias.</i>

1181
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:00,989
- <i>Si, Si.</i> I like wine.
- Nice vino, yeah.

1182
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,561
<i>Muchas Gracias.</i>

1183
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:12,000
So George Orwell came
over to Spain in 1936.

1184
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:13,769
- Oh.
- Joined...

1185
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:16,004
One year
after the birth of Elvis.

1186
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:18,340
He come out to Barcelona
with his wife.

1187
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:19,475
- With his wife.
- She stayed there...

1188
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:21,143
Mini break.

1189
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:23,912
- She stayed there...
- it's a good place for a mini break.

1190
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,948
Is that what they were doing?

1191
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,950
Were they able to do that
in those days?

1192
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:29,752
Do you wanna learn anythin'
about civil war at all

1193
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:31,353
or you just think it's,
like, or you just think

1194
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:33,155
"I don't know, I don't really
give a damn about the civil war.

1195
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:34,556
I'm not
that interested in it."

1196
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,158
I want to learn
something about civil war.

1197
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,595
Okay. So he came out to
Barcelona, left his wife there

1198
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:42,131
went off to the front
to fight, 50 miles away.

1199
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:44,233
And when he came back,
he was so disillusioned

1200
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:47,469
with the intellectuals who
were back in Barcelona.

1201
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:49,171
When he went back there,
he saw them all.

1202
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:52,207
Uh, they'd become bourgeois,
they'd lost sight of their ideals

1203
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,842
though he said they were
eating fancy food

1204
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,277
in posh restaurants.

1205
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:57,045
So he went back to the
front one more time.

1206
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,114
Eventually he got shot
in the throat.

1207
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,283
Couldn't speak for six months.

1208
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:03,519
Where's your bullet to the
throat when you need one?

1209
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,790
I don't think if I were
to say to Sally..

1210
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,226
I was going off to fight,
she wouldn't stand there

1211
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,962
and just say alright, you know,
you're going off to be killed.

1212
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:15,531
Yeah, or kill.

1213
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:16,899
That's a very good point

1214
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,434
'cause that's something
else I couldn't do.

1215
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,135
I wouldn't fight a war
because I got kids.

1216
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:21,503
- I got kids.
- Yeah.

1217
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:23,972
But if I didn't have kids,
I think I would be...

1218
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:25,607
- I don't think you would.
- I think I would.

1219
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,608
I think you'd like
to think you would

1220
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,643
but I don't think you would.

1221
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:28,877
You'd go and entertain
the troops.

1222
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,212
You'd go and do Alan
partridge for the troops.

1223
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:32,014
That's what you would do.

1224
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:33,248
And all these proper men

1225
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,583
who are giving over everything

1226
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:36,919
would love it as you came
out and went "ah-ha."

1227
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:39,521
You know what I'd love if a sniper
got you at that moment. Ah..

1228
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:43,659
You didn't even finish the
"ah-ha." You only got to "ah."

1229
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:46,361
I'd do the "ha" as I would
with my dying breath.

1230
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:47,596
- I don't think you would.
- I would.

1231
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:49,631
No, you wouldn't. It's
to the head, you idiot.

1232
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,100
- Ah!
- You wouldn't say "ah-ha."

1233
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,903
- I'd get the "ha" out.
- There'd be no "ha."

1234
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,973
And I'd say, if Steve were here
now, I know what he'd say..

1235
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,842
- Ha-ha!
- Hm.

1236
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,517
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Steve.</i>

1237
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,985
Hello, Emma love.

1238
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,587
How are you?
How's it going?

1239
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:13,755
<i>Doing very well, yes.</i>

1240
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,091
Good, good.
How's, how's Rob doing?

1241
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:17,559
Uh, Rob is, uh, great.

1242
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:18,861
He's doing very well indeed.

1243
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:20,329
I'm good, I'm good.

1244
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,397
Yeah, you're on speakerphone.
That's why I'm being nice.

1245
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:23,599
Hiya. How are you?

1246
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:25,434
<i>Oh. Hi, Rob.
I'm good, thanks.</i>

1247
00:58:25,436 --> 00:58:27,936
I'm just, I'm calling to remind you that
I'm coming out to see you tomorrow.

1248
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:30,005
- Yay!
- Yay! Thank god.

1249
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,406
I'm at breaking point.

1250
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:32,875
Also..
Okay, great.

1251
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:35,143
And I'm, I'm bringing
Yolanda with me

1252
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:36,445
<i>to do the photos
for "the New York times."</i>

1253
00:58:36,447 --> 00:58:38,313
- Oh, great.
- And "the observer."

1254
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,148
So I just wanted to remind you

1255
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,484
that they do want you
to dress up as don Quixote

1256
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:44,486
and Sancho Panza, okay?

1257
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:47,055
What a surprise.

1258
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:49,825
- Which one am I?
- <i>Uh, you, Rob, you're Sancho Panza.</i>

1259
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:51,960
- Hey.
- Yeah, good.

1260
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:53,896
A supporting role as ever.

1261
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:12,514
"Parador De cuenca is
a majestic former convent.

1262
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:13,582
Careful.

1263
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:16,084
"Perched above the cuenca gorge

1264
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:19,855
with stunning views
of the old town."

1265
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:21,723
<i>Oh, look at that. Look at that.
Oh, that's beautiful.</i>

1266
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,892
<i>When that's.. Don't
look at it too much.</i>

1267
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,443
Hello.

1268
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,145
<i>Hi. Is that Rob Brydon?</i>

1269
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:44,646
Uh, speaking.

1270
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:46,348
<i>I've got Matt Jacobs for you.</i>

1271
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,251
Okay.

1272
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:52,254
<i>Hey, Rob Brydon.
He-he-he-he-he.</i>

1273
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,324
- Hello. Hi, Matt.
- Hey, man, how you doin'?

1274
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:57,793
Yeah, I'm alright.
How... how are you?

1275
00:59:57,795 --> 00:59:59,461
<i>I'm good.
How's, uh, London?</i>

1276
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:02,331
Oh, I'm in Spain. I'm not
in London, I'm in Spain.

1277
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:05,300
- Hi, Greg.
- Hi, Steve. How are you?

1278
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:06,501
I've been better.

1279
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:08,637
Uh, do you know they
brought a new writer on

1280
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,573
to, uh, to... to rewrite,
uh, "missing?"

1281
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:14,309
Yeah, but it's... it's nothing.
It's... it's just, it's standard.

1282
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,144
It's just... just for
a Polish, that's all.

1283
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:20,115
I'm with Steve, with,
uh, with Steve Coogan.

1284
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,985
Oh, Steve Coogan.
Yeah, yeah, good, good.

1285
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:25,220
Is this the Matt, the..
That's Steve's agent?

1286
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:26,555
Yeah, uh, well, no.

1287
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:27,990
I mean, I've left the agency.

1288
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:30,492
Uh, uh, we met at Sundance.

1289
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:31,727
You remember that.

1290
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:34,696
Uh, I've got, uh,
two Oscar nominations.

1291
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:36,231
Uh, the last film I wrote

1292
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,799
had four... four
academy award nominations.

1293
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,167
Yeah, I know, but do you
know what, he's really

1294
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:41,169
he's, he's great,
he's, he's up-and-coming.

1295
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:44,706
Uh, uh, up-and-coming?
I... I've up and come.

1296
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:45,941
I've already up and come.

1297
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,342
Yeah. You have.
No, absolutely, you have.

1298
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,477
You have, Steve, you have.

1299
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,911
Look, let me cut to the chase.

1300
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:53,715
I saw you
in the... "Horseman."

1301
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:55,250
- "The huntsman."
- "The huntsman."

1302
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:56,284
I saw you
in "the huntsman."

1303
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:57,753
I thought you were
fantastic, man.

1304
01:00:57,755 --> 01:01:00,322
I mean, really, you burned up the screen.
You've got it.

1305
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,590
<i>That little midget walk you did.</i>

1306
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:03,125
<i>The... the screen,
the screen loves you</i>

1307
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:04,426
<i>but you were being
under-used there</i>

1308
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:06,862
so let me... let me
cut to the chase, okay?

1309
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:09,564
You should be doing
what Nick frost is doing.

1310
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:12,134
Well, I did, I... I did
"the huntsman" with him.

1311
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:13,402
This is... this is what
I'm saying.

1312
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:17,239
You should be doing what
James Corden is doing.

1313
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:18,707
<i>You know, he's
the biggest thing on TV.</i>

1314
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:22,044
I was with James in,
uh, "Gavin and Stacey."

1315
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:23,111
<i>Oh, I heard about that.</i>

1316
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,780
<i>It was supposed to be fantastic.</i>

1317
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:26,815
<i>I, uh, I missed it, but
I'll definitely get a copy.</i>

1318
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:28,784
You know, you should be
the new Simon Pegg.

1319
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:31,219
You should be, you could be

1320
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,922
you will be
the new Ricky Gervais.

1321
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:35,691
Oh, gosh.
Well, Ricky, huh?

1322
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:36,825
That's what we all dream of.

1323
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,427
What does Jeff think of this?

1324
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:39,461
Jeff, Jeff's fine with it.

1325
01:01:39,463 --> 01:01:40,595
Jeff's just very busy doing

1326
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:42,531
another screenplay
for fox, so, he... he...

1327
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,633
What, what script is Jeff doing for fox?
I didn't know that.

1328
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:46,468
<i>He's doing a script
for George Clooney.</i>

1329
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,336
For George Clooney?
Right, okay.

1330
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:50,038
<i>I had no,
I had no idea about it.</i>

1331
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,940
Another thing
I had no idea about.

1332
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,909
<i>Have you, have you ever
done any, any hosting</i>

1333
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:55,610
<i>any, uh, awards ceremonies?</i>

1334
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:57,879
I... I hosted
the la baftas once.

1335
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,449
The what?
They have la baftas?

1336
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:01,850
Who do they give those to?

1337
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:02,984
Listen, never mind.

1338
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:04,586
You should be hosting
the golden globes.

1339
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:05,687
This is what I'm talkin' about.

1340
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:08,356
It's my script.
Look, I wrote it, I..

1341
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:10,592
Well, I co-wrote it.
I'm producing it.

1342
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:13,462
I'm gonna star in it,
not Tim Hoddleston

1343
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:14,930
or some other fucking posh twat.

1344
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:16,298
This should be
the best phone call..

1345
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,668
This will be the best phone
call you've ever had.

1346
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:20,969
Yes.

1347
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:22,237
- It's my film, okay?
- <i>Of course, it is.</i>

1348
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,806
That's what it's gonna be.
Good, thank you.

1349
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,315
He's British at the end.

1350
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,418
<i>Turns out..</i>

1351
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,253
That's what Laurie Lee did

1352
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,755
to pay his way around Spain.

1353
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:42,090
- He busked.
- Yeah.

1354
01:02:56,906 --> 01:03:00,575
You know that, uh, cuenca
was one of the last places

1355
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:03,211
to fall to the fascists
in the civil war.

1356
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,715
March 29th, 1939.

1357
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:08,683
Perfect position,
it's up on a hilltop

1358
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:10,352
so very difficult to attack

1359
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:11,686
and very easy to defend.

1360
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:13,522
Yeah, and they may
very well have held out

1361
01:03:13,524 --> 01:03:16,291
if it weren't for the fact
that the, the army

1362
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:19,194
the republican army turned against
the socialist government.

1363
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:20,428
If it weren't for that

1364
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,597
Franco may well not have won.

1365
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,432
<i>Hola.</i>

1366
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:25,867
We gave you money before, mate.

1367
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:27,402
Oh, yeah. Sorry, fellas.
Take care.

1368
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:28,870
You can have a drink with
us if you want though.

1369
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:30,005
- Yeah?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1370
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:31,573
- You sure?
- Yeah, grab a pew.

1371
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:33,074
- There's a seat there.
- Actually, that'd be lovely.

1372
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:34,476
- Cheers, man.
- No worries, yeah.

1373
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,278
<i>Una cana por favor?</i>

1374
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,446
- Sound very good.
- Thank you, man.

1375
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:39,648
Especially like
your backing singers.

1376
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,082
Oh, yeah. Hardly the
Monettes, right?

1377
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:43,051
- You know them?
- Um, yeah.

1378
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:44,719
I suppose
new acquaintances maybe.

1379
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:46,822
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1380
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,590
So, you guys, you on holiday?

1381
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:50,659
- No, we're working.
- Oh, right.

1382
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:53,929
I'm, uh, I'm writing a book

1383
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:57,666
about my, um, sort of
travel through Spain

1384
01:03:57,668 --> 01:04:00,769
replicating a journey I did when
I was, when I was a younger man.

1385
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:04,873
Well, it's kind of a little bit
inspired by, um, Laurie Lee.

1386
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:07,342
You know, well, uh, "when I walked
out one midsummer morning."

1387
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,411
- Yeah...
- and we're driving it. Cheers!

1388
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:11,613
Uh, cheers, mate.
Yeah, I love Laurie Lee.

1389
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:13,415
That's part of the reason
when I saw you busking there

1390
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:14,916
I said, "well,
this is how Laurie Lee"

1391
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:17,519
because he paid his way through
Spain by doing the same thing.

1392
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,422
With a violin, yeah,
but, yeah, right on.

1393
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,157
So you guys staying
in cuenca long?

1394
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:23,558
- <i>No, we're..</i>
- No.

1395
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,861
One day in every place, I'm
writing restaurant reviews

1396
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:28,263
so we go to one town, we're
there a day and then we go on.

1397
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:30,765
Oh, have you been in, uh,
San Sebastian for food?

1398
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:32,667
<i>It's the best place in Spain
for food by a country mile.</i>

1399
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:34,302
- Yeah, I know.
- We were near there in Santander.

1400
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:35,370
- <i>Weren't we?</i>
- Yeah.

1401
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,138
Or Catalonia,
not just Barcelona.

1402
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,874
- Food there's excellent, yeah?
- Yeah, we just..

1403
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:40,475
Well, we're not, we're trying..

1404
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:41,710
We thought
we were gonna go there

1405
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,278
but we just thought
it was a bit too obvious.

1406
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,113
And we're trying, we're trying
to do stuff that's a little bit

1407
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,449
like, kind of, the kind
of nooks and crannies

1408
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:48,750
<i>slightly off, off the
beaten track a little bit.</i>

1409
01:04:48,752 --> 01:04:50,819
Like San Luca, near Cadiz?

1410
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:52,387
The tuna there
is absolutely banging.

1411
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,822
- You'll love that.
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1412
01:04:53,824 --> 01:04:55,724
<i>It's more, like, the
culture than the food.</i>

1413
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,158
Although food's part of it

1414
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,693
but it's more, like, the
kinda cultural experience.

1415
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:00,562
But if it's food and culture

1416
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,565
that you are looking for,
Valencia.

1417
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:04,966
- Valencia?
- <i>Yeah, you probably know it.</i>

1418
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:06,735
- Casa Montana?
- I know. Yeah, yeah.

1419
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,036
- <i>Yeah, it's the best.</i>
- I know.

1420
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,871
And Valencia's got
the holy grail.

1421
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:12,073
How long does it take to
get to Valencia from here?

1422
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,075
Well, Valencia's like two hours away, man.
It's close.

1423
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,443
Let's go to Valencia.

1424
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,379
Well, no, we two.. No,
we're not going Valencia.

1425
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,880
- Well go to Valencia.
- No.

1426
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:20,682
We'll go to Valencia.
It's two hours.

1427
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,083
<i>We've got a schedule worked out.</i>

1428
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:25,186
We got a pre-ordained route
taking in some, uh...

1429
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:27,622
Where's the fun in that?
Stray from the path, man.

1430
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:29,391
Yeah, we sort of are
straying from the path

1431
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:31,493
by not going to places
like Catalonia, so..

1432
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:34,262
- Okay.
- You can go there for us.

1433
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,197
- I will, again.
- Okay, again, yeah.

1434
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:38,266
Alright, listen, I'm gonna
head back to the hotel, anyway

1435
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,002
so, uh, I'm gonna head off.

1436
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:42,570
- Going back to the hotel?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1437
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:44,105
- Now?
- Yeah, yeah.

1438
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,975
You're alright, you'll be
alright here with, uh, man.

1439
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:49,010
Get him to play a few tunes.
Alright, mate.

1440
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:50,445
Good luck
with your Bo diddly stuff.

1441
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,513
And thanks for the beer, man.

1442
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:52,547
<i>Yeah, no worries. Okay.</i>

1443
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,182
Alright, see you later.

1444
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,155
- Sorry about that.
- Touched a nerve no more.

1445
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:01,923
He, uh, doesn't like
to be told things

1446
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:04,926
that he thinks he knows.

1447
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,298
- Hello.
- <i>Hello.</i>

1448
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,768
You look, uh,
delectable and tasty.

1449
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,570
Like a piece of ham.

1450
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:17,806
Oh, alright, then,
you look sexy.

1451
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,942
<i>I don't feel very sexy.</i>

1452
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:22,377
I had a chat with the builders

1453
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:25,113
and they can't start
for another month.

1454
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:29,517
- <i>Hey, Misha.</i>
- Hi. Where are you?

1455
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,087
I had a fan phone call today.

1456
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:33,588
<i>Do you remember the agent</i>

1457
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:37,025
<i>Steve used to have
in la called Matt?</i>

1458
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:38,393
Sort of, yeah.

1459
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:40,028
Look, when you come back

1460
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,030
I was thinking

1461
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,399
maybe we could go out to
Rachel's for the weekend?

1462
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:46,201
Fantastic.
Yeah, I'd love to do that.

1463
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:48,169
- <i>You're not excited.</i>
- Yeah. But I'll..

1464
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,205
Uh, you know what, yeah, uh,
we'll definitely do that.

1465
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,573
But why don't you
come out earlier?

1466
01:06:51,575 --> 01:06:53,942
He wants me to go with him

1467
01:06:53,944 --> 01:06:56,044
and be represented by him in la.

1468
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:59,080
Well, surely, there's no
point in that, is there?

1469
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:00,448
<i>Absolutely the right answer.</i>

1470
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,384
<i>Well done. I give you
two points for that.</i>

1471
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:05,220
And that is what I will be telling
this little American fellow

1472
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:07,722
uh, in me own way. Uh..

1473
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:09,157
That it's too far away from me.

1474
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:10,225
<i>Yeah, of course, it is.</i>

1475
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,560
But isn't Joe
supposed to come out?

1476
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:14,629
<i>Yeah, but he's...
He can do his own thing.</i>

1477
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:16,064
You know, he's a big boy.

1478
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,599
<i>How old is he now?</i>

1479
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:19,534
He's 20 years old now.

1480
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,036
Oh, you better watch out.

1481
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:23,138
I might like him
more than I like you.

1482
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:26,541
- Yeah, you're gross.
- Look, I gotta go.

1483
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,110
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay, bye.

1484
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,380
Oh, they're here.

1485
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,315
Hey. Oh.

1486
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,750
<i>- Hola.
- Hola.</i>

1487
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,085
- How you doing?
- Hey.

1488
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,253
- Good to see you.
- You, too. How's it going?

1489
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,155
- Thank you. How are you?
- Great.

1490
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:15,590
- Very nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1491
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:16,858
- Hey, how are you?
- Hello, you alright?

1492
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,626
- Well, good to see you.
- How was your flight?

1493
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:21,329
Yeah, it was very good.
So photographs.

1494
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:23,051
- Location's up the hill.
- What about them?

1495
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,605
- Yes.
- I'm gonna have them there.

1496
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,006
Yeah.

1497
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:37,479
These are about two sizes
too big, the shoes.

1498
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:39,848
Yeah, this is really painful.

1499
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:43,685
I don't know, I don't know how
anyone can fight in this stuff.

1500
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:45,420
What shoe size
did you give them?

1501
01:08:45,422 --> 01:08:48,223
- <i>The size that you sent, sent me over.</i>
- Well, that was seven.

1502
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:51,159
These feel like a ten
or, or an eleven.

1503
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:52,961
You've only gotta wear
them for a minute, so..

1504
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,562
- Oh..
- You alright, Steve?

1505
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:56,030
So, you guys ready?

1506
01:08:56,032 --> 01:08:59,367
We could've got changed, uh,
up here and not down there.

1507
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,036
Let him push you up.

1508
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:03,171
One, two, three.

1509
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,306
Okay.

1510
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,875
- I can give you a push.
- I can give you a hand.

1511
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:08,676
No, no. I don't need any help.
I've done it before.

1512
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:10,044
One, two, three.

1513
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:13,548
- Hey, there.
- <i>Yay, good.</i>

1514
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,217
Just about getting
the timing right.

1515
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:18,086
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1516
01:09:18,088 --> 01:09:20,889
There's no saddle.
Alright, thank you.

1517
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:22,624
Hang on.

1518
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:24,792
- Okay. Do it quickly. Yeah?
- Hold your horses.

1519
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,094
Oh-oh!

1520
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:32,934
- Take the picture.
- Just take the fucking picture.

1521
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:35,103
What's she doing there?
Is she on the Internet?

1522
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:39,107
- Just take the picture.
- <i>Yes, I'm coming, Rob.</i>

1523
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,476
Very good.

1524
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,187
Don Quixote had
three trips, didn't he?

1525
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,821
He had the one that he
went out on his own.

1526
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:56,090
And he went back and
visited Sancho Panza

1527
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:58,159
and then he had the sequel
and... and this is

1528
01:09:58,161 --> 01:09:59,627
now your third trip.

1529
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:01,162
When Cervantes wrote the sequel

1530
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:04,566
in the interim, after he'd
written the... the first part

1531
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:07,235
there was a fake sequel
published.

1532
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:10,104
Then he incorporated
the fake sequel

1533
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,339
into his real sequel.

1534
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:12,840
So, he made that part
of the story.

1535
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,909
So when he wrote in his
travels in the second book

1536
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:17,478
he bumps into people who've
read the fake sequel.

1537
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,714
And so he can slag it off
within the pages

1538
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,082
as don Quixote.

1539
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,918
That is so bold and innovative.

1540
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,620
I mean, it's 500 years ago.

1541
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:27,922
So, effectively,
he was post-modern

1542
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:29,691
before there was any
modern to be post about.

1543
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:30,725
<i>Amazing.</i>

1544
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,335
Cervantes, of course,
when he was 37

1545
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:41,836
he married
a 19-year-old.

1546
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,504
Impressive for a man
with one arm.

1547
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:45,006
Thirty years ago
when I came to Spain

1548
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:46,841
<i>I was 18 years old,
I was pursuing</i>

1549
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:48,142
a 37-year-old woman.

1550
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:50,712
- She was 37?
- The reverse.

1551
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,146
I wasn't doing
the kind of cliche

1552
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:53,214
going with a younger woman..

1553
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:55,750
She was actually
20 years older than me.

1554
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:59,687
Would you now be with
a woman 20 years older?

1555
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:01,589
Well, I don't...
I think that that's...

1556
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:02,890
I'll ask again.

1557
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:05,393
Would you<i> now</i> be with
a woman 20 years older?

1558
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:06,494
A 70-year-old.
A 70-year-old.

1559
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:08,162
That's academic.

1560
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:10,445
She... she could be in any
profession, it wouldn't matter.

1561
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:16,104
But he imagined that the, uh, the
inns were castles, didn't he?

1562
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:17,805
- In... in his imagination.
- He did, yeah.

1563
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:19,173
We've been staying in inns?

1564
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:21,175
Well, we've been literally
staying in castles.

1565
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:23,111
Sorry, we have, yeah. No, we've
been staying in castles.

1566
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,179
I think they're inns. He stayed in
inns, he thought they were castles.

1567
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:26,547
- So it's, uh..
- So... so, yes.

1568
01:11:26,549 --> 01:11:28,883
- Like a circle and a spiral.
- The other way around.

1569
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:31,052
- Yes.
- Like a wheel within a wheel.

1570
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:32,387
<i>Never ending or beginning</i>

1571
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:33,588
<i>on an
ever-spinning reel.</i>

1572
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:34,589
<i>Yeah.</i>

1573
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,591
Like the circles that you find

1574
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:39,894
in the windmills of your mind.

1575
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:41,229
- <i>The windmills.</i>
- Windmills.

1576
01:11:41,231 --> 01:11:44,198
That could be
a post-modern manifesto.

1577
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,934
- It really could.
- Or a lovely song from the '70s.

1578
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,596
<i>"Spanish fly,"
Rob Brydon, Steve Coogan.</i>

1579
01:12:15,598 --> 01:12:17,131
<i>Wonderful stuff from them.</i>

1580
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:18,966
Now, don't forget, we've come
a long way this morning...

1581
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:20,601
Uh, let me just
interrupt you there

1582
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:23,037
old Kibby Bruce, me old friend.

1583
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,273
Because, uh, anyone who's anyone

1584
01:12:25,275 --> 01:12:27,342
will know that..

1585
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:30,278
The title of the song
by herb Albert

1586
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,481
is "Spanish flea"
and not "Spanish fly."

1587
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:35,383
May I be so bold
as to pick you up

1588
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:39,087
on a wee-point, which is,
that it's not herb Albert.

1589
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:41,589
It's herb Alpert, with a P.

1590
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:44,025
You got your... your PS and
your BS mixed up there.

1591
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,094
You got your fleas and
your flies all over.

1592
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:48,629
And you've got your, you've
got your PS and your BS.

1593
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:50,498
<i>I feel a little bold
with the mistake there</i>

1594
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,467
<i>so that you can pick
me up, so we're all..</i>

1595
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,469
So we're all
even-Steven.

1596
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:56,070
<i>Probably never know
if that was a sweet..</i>

1597
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:57,905
<i>Fleas, flies, peas, bees.</i>

1598
01:12:57,907 --> 01:12:59,040
You put a P in the wrong place..

1599
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,341
I had a P
in the wrong place once

1600
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:02,343
they won't let me back
in that supermarket again.

1601
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:04,045
Yes, and don't forget
that, you know

1602
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:07,382
time flies like an arrow,
but fruit flies

1603
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:08,816
like a banana.

1604
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:30,104
This is beautiful.
Very calming.

1605
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,973
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- It's wonderful.

1606
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:34,509
It's interesting, isn't it?
We started in the birthplace

1607
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:37,178
of king Ferdinand.

1608
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:41,115
And here we are at the place
where they were buried.

1609
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:43,418
- Here?
- Yeah, in the hotel.

1610
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,952
- It wasn't a hotel then.
- No, it wasn't then.

1611
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:47,188
That would be awful,
wouldn't it? Dreadful.

1612
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:50,091
I have a reservation, uh, Smith.

1613
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,993
- <i>Corpses of.</i>
- Give us a moment, please.

1614
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:53,861
We are about to bury
the king, please.

1615
01:13:53,863 --> 01:13:55,163
<i>What? Yes,
we have a gymnasium.</i>

1616
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:58,099
Why are they buried
in Granada then?

1617
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:00,134
Because this is the last town

1618
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:02,537
to fall to the Catholics.

1619
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:06,007
That's why they call them the
catholic king and queen.

1620
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:08,476
The thing with the moors is
they were way more tolerant

1621
01:14:08,478 --> 01:14:10,144
than the Catholics
who came after them.

1622
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:13,014
I'm a big fan
of the moors. I'm..

1623
01:14:13,016 --> 01:14:16,350
Dudley Moore, Christy
Moore, Patrick Moore.

1624
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:18,586
<i>No more, please.</i>

1625
01:14:18,588 --> 01:14:21,022
- Roger Moore.
- No.

1626
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:24,859
<i>When I think back to the
moors being here in Spain</i>

1627
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:28,229
<i>I can honestly say
we had a wonderful time.</i>

1628
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:31,399
Mother booked the holiday
and we arrived

1629
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:34,001
and found the hotel
to be to our liking.

1630
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:37,472
And of course, what you're forgetting
to point out is that the moors

1631
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:41,342
when they conquered Spain
in the early 8th century

1632
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,177
they were, uh,
encountering a Europe

1633
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:45,613
that was still very much
in the dark ages.

1634
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:47,148
It was pitch black.

1635
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:50,084
But they, of course, built
beautiful palaces like this.

1636
01:14:50,086 --> 01:14:51,853
They were very ahead
of their time.

1637
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:54,989
I have to tell you, when we
were building these palaces

1638
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:58,426
my fellow moors, mother,
father, and sister

1639
01:14:58,428 --> 01:15:00,828
sometimes we would
encounter a workman

1640
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:05,299
who, perhaps, wasn't working quite
as quickly as I would want.

1641
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:06,934
Then I would say to him..

1642
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,269
- Move!
- Move!

1643
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,571
- Move!
- Move!

1644
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:12,139
- Move!
- Move!

1645
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:12,942
Um..

1646
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:15,343
A lot of them thought
they were hearing cows.

1647
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:17,311
The thing about doing
Roger Moore..

1648
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:20,381
- Yes?
- Less is more.

1649
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:23,651
Ah, you've met my brother, Les.
Les, come in.

1650
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:26,220
That's right, I'm also a Moore.
Les Moore.

1651
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:28,189
I was trying to hint
that you should always

1652
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:31,025
leave your audience
wanting more.

1653
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,661
My audience
constantly wants more

1654
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:35,062
and that's what I give them.

1655
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:37,331
Roger Moore.

1656
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:40,902
Oh, quit while you are ahead.

1657
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,737
They introduced
the orange to Spain.

1658
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:44,505
- The moors?
- Yeah.

1659
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:46,741
- Really? From where?
- She's absolutely right.

1660
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:47,808
- I guess Morocco.
- Morocco.

1661
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:48,943
That's where
they were coming from.

1662
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:50,778
I could explain it to you
if you like.

1663
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:54,115
It was my mother. She packed
one into her hand luggage.

1664
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:55,583
- <i>He didn't get the hint, did he?</i>
- No.

1665
01:15:55,585 --> 01:15:57,385
<i>On one of our holidays</i>

1666
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:59,320
of course, I said, "mother,
what are you doing?"

1667
01:15:59,322 --> 01:16:02,890
She said, "shush, Roger, I'm going
to introduce the orange to Spain."

1668
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:05,593
And about the other thing that
moors introduced was, of course

1669
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,061
uh, our numerical system.

1670
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,896
That's right, we're
going to calculate...

1671
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:09,931
Because basically they..

1672
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:11,499
We used to use Roman numerals

1673
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:13,834
and it was only when they found
the Arabic numerical system

1674
01:16:13,836 --> 01:16:17,805
that we developed that
into, into the

1675
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:19,874
the... the numerical
system we use today.

1676
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:21,409
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1677
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:22,577
Mother said it would never work.

1678
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:24,045
He's very crazy.

1679
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:25,313
<i>Um, the fact is that</i>

1680
01:16:25,315 --> 01:16:27,848
the, the moors were fa...
Far more sophisticated.

1681
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:31,919
They knew about medicine,
philosophy, uh, mathematics.

1682
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,288
- Uh, uh, astronomy.
- Oh, we love looking..

1683
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,891
Very, very..
Way more advanced than..

1684
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:38,960
And also managed to marry, uh...

1685
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:40,861
My parents did marry.
You're quite right.

1686
01:16:40,863 --> 01:16:42,663
They married at a young
age, they had me...

1687
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:44,498
Rob, Rob, Rob...

1688
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,668
- It was a wonderful time.
- Seriously, seriously.

1689
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:51,172
It was a wonderful day. My
uncle Bertie gave the sermon.

1690
01:16:51,174 --> 01:16:53,808
He was a preacher, you see?

1691
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,843
The Greek philosophers
were translated

1692
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:59,413
into Arabic by, by... by the
moors, and it was only when

1693
01:16:59,415 --> 01:17:00,448
during...
During the crusades

1694
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,249
when they invaded Toledo...

1695
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,751
I remember father
sitting at his desk

1696
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:05,620
<i>translating night and day.</i>

1697
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:07,321
<i>My mother would say to him</i>

1698
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:09,490
"when are you going to
take Roger to the park?"

1699
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:13,294
Aristotle's teachings were translated
into Arabic by the Muslims

1700
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:14,962
and then during
the crusades, they...

1701
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:17,398
Why didn't you say they
were done by the moors?

1702
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,866
Are you trying to discourage me?

1703
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:21,035
- What?
- <i>Look, please, yes...</i>

1704
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:23,704
You've stopped saying moors,
you started saying Muslims

1705
01:17:23,706 --> 01:17:27,875
and I find that a little
racially offensive.

1706
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:29,110
Go on. Please.

1707
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:31,445
You started off referring
to us as the moors.

1708
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:33,781
<i>Now you're referring
to us as Muslims.</i>

1709
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:34,849
<i>The moors were Muslims.</i>

1710
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:36,717
But why did you start
with moors?

1711
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,519
It doesn't matter, the... the
people I'm talkin' about

1712
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:40,254
were one and the same,
moors were Muslims.

1713
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:43,524
No, I'm not Roger Muslim.
I'm Roger Moore.

1714
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:46,727
Dear god. Oh, dear.

1715
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:48,796
Oh, I've bought you a ticket
the first thing in the morning

1716
01:17:48,798 --> 01:17:49,897
to see the Alhambra.

1717
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,632
- Oh, brilliant. Great, great.
- Yeah.

1718
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:52,867
Rob, I've got one for you too.

1719
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:55,836
Can I go later?
Can I go after breakfast?

1720
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,038
It'll be busy.

1721
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,240
Yolanda,
you should come with me.

1722
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:02,143
I can't. I have to take an
early flight back to London.

1723
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:03,944
- Really? That's a shame.
- <i>Hm.</i>

1724
01:18:03,946 --> 01:18:05,446
You're leavin' me alone
with him?

1725
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:08,282
Ah, you won't be alone. I'm
coming with you to Malaga.

1726
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,484
I'm gonna make sure
Joe gets to you safely.

1727
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:11,919
- Thank the lord.
- Great.

1728
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,798
- Hello?
- Hey, hey, dad.

1729
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,500
- Hey. How you doin'?
- I'm..

1730
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:28,002
Yeah, I'm... I'm good.
How are you?

1731
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:30,571
Um, great. Really looking
forward to seeing you.

1732
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:33,841
Well, I've, I've, uh,
I've missed you, buddy.

1733
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:37,311
Uh, yeah, that was, that was what
I was calling about, actually.

1734
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:40,381
Uh, yeah. Emma's, Emma's, uh,
she's been in touch, right?

1735
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,049
<i>She said she's organized
all the flights...</i>

1736
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,952
No, dad. I can't come.

1737
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:49,623
What do you m... what
are you talking about?

1738
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,692
I just...
I just can't come.

1739
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:55,463
<i>I need to, I need
to stay here with Helen.</i>

1740
01:18:55,465 --> 01:18:57,431
What's going on?
Talk to me.

1741
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:00,668
She's pregnant.

1742
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,875
- You're fucking kidding me.
- <i>She's..</i>

1743
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:10,311
- You fucking idiot.
- <i>She's pregnant.</i>

1744
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:13,147
<i>I need to stay here with her, so we
can figure out what we're gonna do.</i>

1745
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:14,548
Wait, wait, wait, wait..

1746
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,450
Are you certain she's pregnant?

1747
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:18,252
Yes, she's definitely pregnant.

1748
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,188
And you're sure
it's, it's yours?

1749
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,957
- Dad!
- Um..

1750
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,093
Um..

1751
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,030
You're 20 years old.

1752
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,566
You're too young to have a kid.
You know, it's... it's..

1753
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:34,135
<i>Any decisions you make now</i>

1754
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:36,804
<i>will have ramifications for
the rest of your life.</i>

1755
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,306
Yes, I know

1756
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:42,576
but I'm not just making
decisions for me anymore.

1757
01:19:42,578 --> 01:19:45,980
I need to think about her and we need
to think about what we're gonna do.

1758
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:47,348
Hah.

1759
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,451
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Sorry.

1760
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:52,486
You see, you don't have
to be sorry, okay?

1761
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:57,091
<i>It's okay. It doesn't... doesn't
matter about coming over here.</i>

1762
01:19:57,093 --> 01:19:59,226
You know, it just, um..

1763
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:02,530
Whatever happens, I'm... I'm
I'm here for you, alright?

1764
01:20:02,532 --> 01:20:04,231
- <i>Thanks, dad.</i>
- And I love you.

1765
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,734
<i>Love you too.</i>

1766
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:10,437
Okay. Listen, um..

1767
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,542
And don't worry
about it, alright?

1768
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:17,044
Hm. Yeah.

1769
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:19,914
I love you, and I'll
talk to you later, okay?

1770
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,715
Yeah.
Love you too.

1771
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,935
<i>Gracias.</i>

1772
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,601
Hey, good morning.

1773
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:15,202
<i>Buenos Dias, amigo</i> Coogan.

1774
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:17,938
How was the Alhambra?

1775
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,774
It was, uh, good, it was good

1776
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:24,712
but it was, uh,
you know, beautiful

1777
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:26,580
spiritual, blah, blah, blah.

1778
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:27,915
You okay?

1779
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,051
Joe's not comin' out.

1780
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:32,987
What? Why?

1781
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:35,689
Uh, his girlfriend's pregnant.

1782
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:37,191
Oh, my god.

1783
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:40,361
- Bloody hell.
- What's he gonna do?

1784
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:42,529
Ah, well,
I told him he had options.

1785
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:44,331
What does that mean?

1786
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,433
Well, he's too young
to... to be a dad.

1787
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:48,102
<i>He's not very worldly, you know?</i>

1788
01:21:48,104 --> 01:21:49,904
You know what this means,
don't you?

1789
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:59,346
I'd start thinking about it.

1790
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:04,285
You're gonna be a granddad.

1791
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,388
Thank you, lord.

1792
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:15,896
Look at those. Ah.

1793
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:17,865
Yeah, a lot of people think they're
ugly 'cause they're modern

1794
01:22:17,867 --> 01:22:21,201
but I think they're, they're
beautiful 'cause they're functional.

1795
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:23,504
<i>"Tilting at turbines." That's
what we should call my, uh</i>

1796
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:25,039
<i>book about Spain.</i>

1797
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:26,440
<i>Good idea.</i>

1798
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,348
Oh, look, Almeria. Isn't that where
you were gonna take Joe snorkeling?

1799
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,216
- Yeah, it was, yeah.
- Oh.

1800
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:38,886
I brought him here as a
baby when I was filming.

1801
01:22:38,888 --> 01:22:40,387
How old was he?

1802
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:42,856
- Oh, about six months.
- Aww.

1803
01:22:42,858 --> 01:22:45,526
You know, we could still stop.
We've got time.

1804
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:48,362
I'll go snorkeling with you if you want.
I... I could be Joe.

1805
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:51,865
You dressed in a nappy, crawling
around on the beach eating sand

1806
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:53,934
uh, only has limited appeal.

1807
01:22:53,936 --> 01:22:55,302
Well, it wouldn't be
for everyone.

1808
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,870
I mean, I'm the first to admit.

1809
01:22:56,872 --> 01:23:00,708
That was a long time ago when I
was still married to his mom.

1810
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:03,077
Yeah.

1811
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:33,707
Do you know who lives in Malaga?

1812
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:35,275
The mayor of Malaga.

1813
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:37,778
- Yes. Correct.
- Thank you.

1814
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,146
And Sean Connery.

1815
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:41,181
Marbella,
Mr. Coogan, Marbella.

1816
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,850
You make the mistake.
He lives in Marbella.

1817
01:23:42,852 --> 01:23:44,752
Yeah, but he... he flies
into Malaga.

1818
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,656
Uh, by all accounts

1819
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:53,227
he's a very well-respected
pillar of the society.

1820
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:56,563
Yes, he's, uh, very active
in his civic, civic duties.

1821
01:23:56,565 --> 01:24:00,401
I like to get involved. Uh,
the recycling, for example.

1822
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:03,370
Plastics on a Friday,
cardboard on a Saturday.

1823
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,607
Do you expect me to talk?

1824
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:08,475
No, Mr. bond.
I expect you to die.

1825
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:11,345
- Well..
- <i>This is the Russian salad.</i>

1826
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:12,446
Thank you.

1827
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:15,816
When he met Cubby broccoli

1828
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:17,718
and, uh, Harry Saltzman

1829
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,454
to discuss the role,
as he left the meeting

1830
01:24:20,456 --> 01:24:24,158
and they looked out of the
window and said he.. Not yet.

1831
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,860
And said..
"What are you doing?"

1832
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:28,996
Getting ready to do
Sean Connery.

1833
01:24:28,998 --> 01:24:31,899
You appear to be
doing him already.

1834
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:35,202
As he left the building, and he
walked out across regent street

1835
01:24:35,204 --> 01:24:39,039
they looked down and said, "that man
is bond. He moves like a panther."

1836
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,641
- Like a panther.
- Like a panther.

1837
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:42,776
Yes, but walking like a panther

1838
01:24:42,778 --> 01:24:46,146
is not enough to bag you
the role of James Bond

1839
01:24:46,148 --> 01:24:50,250
because, of course, bond is also
something of a bulldog, so...

1840
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:51,351
He was primarily...

1841
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:53,754
He had to be a combination
of a panther

1842
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,889
and, and a bulldog.

1843
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:59,259
Apologies if I've been dragging
my ass around the carpet

1844
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,295
because I may have worms.

1845
01:25:01,297 --> 01:25:04,131
I have a very itchy anus,
I apologize now

1846
01:25:04,133 --> 01:25:06,733
but it's part and parcel of
being a panther or a dog.

1847
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:08,535
When you introduce me to blofeld

1848
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:11,271
perhaps I should curl up
and lick my balls.

1849
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:19,213
I think I make quite
a good knight, don't I?

1850
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:20,714
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- You do, actually, yeah.

1851
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:21,715
<i>With the best one in the world</i>

1852
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:23,217
<i>you could never be El Cid.</i>

1853
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:26,320
You could be a chap called
Sid, just not El Cid.

1854
01:25:26,322 --> 01:25:27,955
- I could be old Sid.
- Yeah.

1855
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:29,756
- You could be old Sid.
- Old El Cid.

1856
01:25:29,758 --> 01:25:32,726
Look me in the eye and tell me
you think you could play El Cid

1857
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:34,862
in a remake,
the Charlton Heston role.

1858
01:25:34,864 --> 01:25:37,631
I mean, then you could certainly
play Michael Hordern in El Cid.

1859
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:40,067
- Who did he play?
- Someone's dad. I can't remember.

1860
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:41,902
Oh. You know
who Michael Hordern was?

1861
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:43,904
- Michael Hordern?
- I don't.

1862
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:45,038
Michael Hordern would go..

1863
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,041
- Uh, Paddington bear...
- Yeah, I know...

1864
01:25:48,043 --> 01:25:50,978
That wasn't Michael Hordern,
that was Michel Hordern's horse.

1865
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,247
Michael Hordern.

1866
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:55,816
Didn't he do "no man's
land" with Gielgud?

1867
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:57,484
You wouldn't know,
it's theater, but he did.

1868
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:58,519
- Did he?
- Yeah.

1869
01:25:58,521 --> 01:26:00,187
You know who's doing it now?

1870
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:02,923
I... Ian Mckellen. "You
shall not have the ring..."

1871
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:06,527
Ian Mckellen speaks like
that with a slight..

1872
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:09,329
However refined he is,
northern flat vowels.

1873
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:10,397
Yes.<i> Gracias.</i>

1874
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:11,465
<i>Finito.</i>

1875
01:26:11,467 --> 01:26:13,800
<i>Muchos Gracias.</i>

1876
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:15,435
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Thank you.

1877
01:26:15,437 --> 01:26:17,871
Yeah, but you're missing a bit of
Campness, you see, because Ian...

1878
01:26:17,873 --> 01:26:19,339
Well, no,
I think you overplay that.

1879
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:22,342
No, no, no, no, no, no..

1880
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:23,844
You don't quite get it...

1881
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:26,446
I've spoken to him in person.
Oh, you do make me laugh.

1882
01:26:26,448 --> 01:26:29,116
I have met him many, many times.

1883
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:32,052
- How many times?
- Many, many times.

1884
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:36,023
And you don't get the musicality
when he throws a line up...

1885
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:38,892
That was good.
That was good.

1886
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:42,529
But still with the flat vowels,
they're very much in evidence

1887
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:45,065
however much he may try
to be the supronunciation

1888
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:46,767
with the vowels.

1889
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:49,937
Oh, you do make me laugh, you really do.
Oh, you do make me laugh.

1890
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:52,005
Oh. We need a laugh,
don't we?

1891
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:54,341
Oh. You do make me laugh,
Rob, you do.

1892
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:56,677
Does he do that more
in private though?

1893
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:59,046
'Cause when he met me, he said,
"you're a very good actor."

1894
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:11,692
<i>- Ooh, yum!
- Ah!</i>

1895
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:14,461
- Enjoy.
- <i>Gracias, Gracias.</i>

1896
01:27:14,463 --> 01:27:16,697
<i>Do you wanna come back with me? I
can get you on the same flight.</i>

1897
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:19,866
No, I'll stay. Thank you. Um, I'm gonna
write.. I'm gonna finish my book.

1898
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:22,336
I think the word you're
looking for is start.

1899
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:27,841
Thinkin' about Joe.

1900
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:30,377
Twenty is a young age
to have a child.

1901
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:31,979
How old were you
when you had your kids?

1902
01:27:31,981 --> 01:27:34,881
- Forty-three.
- A bit of a difference.

1903
01:27:34,883 --> 01:27:37,818
Yes. I didn't drink
till I was 35.

1904
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,253
Had my first child at 43.

1905
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:41,455
Are the two related?
We'll never know.

1906
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:43,824
How old? Yeah, what's her
name, the girlfriend?

1907
01:27:43,826 --> 01:27:45,926
- Helen. She's 19.
- Ah!

1908
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:48,562
- Nineteen?
- <i>Gosh.</i>

1909
01:27:48,564 --> 01:27:50,197
Only 19 years old.

1910
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:55,302
She was only 19 years old.

1911
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:57,137
I don't mean any
disrespect, Steve, but...

1912
01:27:57,139 --> 01:28:00,407
She was only 19, she was only..
You've got to get the voice, mate.

1913
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:02,476
Well, you got emosh in your
voice when you say it.

1914
01:28:02,478 --> 01:28:03,944
- She was only...
- Now he has.

1915
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:05,646
She was 19 years old.

1916
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:07,214
Joe, who's met the young lady...

1917
01:28:07,216 --> 01:28:11,218
She was,
she was only 19 years old.

1918
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:14,888
When Joe and Helen had a child

1919
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:17,090
she was only
19-years-old.

1920
01:28:17,092 --> 01:28:20,160
She was only.. It's
actually 16 in the film.

1921
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:24,665
I know that, but Helen
was only 19 years old

1922
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:26,433
and she had a child with Joe.

1923
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:28,702
She had a grandfather
who was so talented

1924
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:30,437
who was so gifted.

1925
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:33,607
- He was only...
- the grandfather was only 50 years old.

1926
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:35,475
Fifty years old.

1927
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:37,678
Hey, do you know
who was born in Malaga?

1928
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,179
- No.
- Picasso.

1929
01:28:39,181 --> 01:28:40,347
- Who?
- Picasso.

1930
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:41,515
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

1931
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:43,717
They've... they've opened
a museum to him.

1932
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:46,953
Who played Picasso in a very popular
film of the last ten years?

1933
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:48,388
Who was it?
No, ask Emma.

1934
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,390
Who played Picasso?

1935
01:28:50,392 --> 01:28:54,027
Guess, it's one of Rob's five impressions.
That should narrow it down.

1936
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:55,862
It wasn't tom Jones,
it wasn't tom Jones.

1937
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:57,264
- No, I wouldn't have thought that.
- Wasn't tom Jones?

1938
01:28:57,266 --> 01:28:58,699
- Okay, we're getting closer.
- Spanish, Spanish.

1939
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:00,600
- You're getting warmer.
- Tony Hopkins.

1940
01:29:00,602 --> 01:29:04,538
Tony Hopkins played a, a
surviving, surviving Picasso.

1941
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,073
I played the painter,
wonderful man.

1942
01:29:06,075 --> 01:29:08,709
Uh, I don't like to talk
about it. I like to draw.

1943
01:29:08,711 --> 01:29:10,944
I like to put the eyes
here, the nose there.

1944
01:29:10,946 --> 01:29:13,013
- The mouth up there.
- He played Picasso as a Welshman?

1945
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:14,414
Well, he didn't, he didn't, sir.

1946
01:29:14,416 --> 01:29:16,616
- He didn't do a Spanish accent, Steve.
- Did he not?

1947
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:18,752
He doesn't have your versatility.
Let's be honest.

1948
01:29:18,754 --> 01:29:22,389
Known to paint and he painted the
paintings in a figurative way.

1949
01:29:22,391 --> 01:29:24,691
He knew how to do still
life and he knew how to, uh

1950
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,493
you know, paint, uh, the radius.

1951
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:29,129
Pablo, Pablo, uh, some
of the men are saying

1952
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:31,164
that you're painting
in a very strange way.

1953
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:33,934
They're saying that the nose
is where the eyes should be.

1954
01:29:33,936 --> 01:29:36,269
- Some of them are saying you're a cubist.
- Oh, Pablo, is it?

1955
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:37,938
Not captain or sir?
Um, eh?

1956
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,639
They're a rambling, skip load.

1957
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:40,874
<i>They want me to put the nose
in the front of the face</i>

1958
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,109
in the middle, like that.

1959
01:29:42,111 --> 01:29:43,810
Right? And the eyes
next... next to the nose?

1960
01:29:43,812 --> 01:29:44,945
- Is that what you want?
- Yes, sir.

1961
01:29:44,947 --> 01:29:47,047
Tell the men
I'm gonna put the nose

1962
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:48,882
where the cheek is and
we'll put the eyes up here

1963
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:50,517
and the mouth round the corner.

1964
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:52,753
And we'll sail down to the cape
of good hope, goddamn ya, sir.

1965
01:29:52,755 --> 01:29:54,121
Will put the eyes
where I want to

1966
01:29:54,123 --> 01:29:55,355
and the nose where I want to.

1967
01:29:55,357 --> 01:29:56,423
If you turn your back on me

1968
01:29:56,425 --> 01:29:58,158
I shall put two eyes
on your back

1969
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,559
and a nose down by your ass.

1970
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:00,961
Do you want that, sir? Is
that what you want, sir?

1971
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:02,329
Don't turn your back on me.

1972
01:30:02,331 --> 01:30:04,598
I will draw you like a cubist.
That's what I'll do.

1973
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,434
If you turn your back on me, I'll
put a nose on your bottom, sir.

1974
01:30:07,436 --> 01:30:09,803
Down the hole is a good way,
down the hole we shall go.

1975
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:12,839
What's interesting about
Picasso is and why I love him

1976
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:15,308
his early paintings
are very orthodox.

1977
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:16,777
- Very accessible.
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1978
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:18,578
He knew how to do
all that, but he said

1979
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:21,348
"that's not enough, I want
to rewrite the rulebook

1980
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:22,983
<i>and be radical
and avant-Garde."</i>

1981
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:25,619
Are you a bit
like Picasso, Steve?

1982
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:27,982
Well, I, I empathize
with his point of view.

1983
01:30:28,007 --> 01:30:29,189
Yes, he is, he is!

1984
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:30,724
- He's gonna say it.
- What I'm saying is...

1985
01:30:30,726 --> 01:30:32,566
<i>Can I record this? Hang
on, hang on, let me..</i>

1986
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:46,039
<i>- Hola. Buenas tardes.
- Hola. Buenas tardes.</i>

1987
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:49,109
Um, I've got a reservation,
Steve Coogan.

1988
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:53,013
"This castle is Gibralfaro

1989
01:30:53,015 --> 01:30:55,649
"named after the same man
as Gibraltar.

1990
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:59,186
"When the moors came in 711
they were only a few thousand.

1991
01:30:59,188 --> 01:31:00,353
"Within a couple of years

1992
01:31:00,355 --> 01:31:03,457
they controlled
almost all of Spain."

1993
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:07,227
That's exactly the same as
Isis and the modern caliphate

1994
01:31:07,229 --> 01:31:08,762
because there was only
a few thousands of them

1995
01:31:08,764 --> 01:31:11,665
and yet they controlled half
of Syria and half of Iraq.

1996
01:31:11,667 --> 01:31:13,633
And they're trying to
emulate what the moors did

1997
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:16,570
when they had controlled everywhere
from Cordoba to Baghdad.

1998
01:31:16,572 --> 01:31:18,839
<i>Well, Isis aren't tolerant. They're
not doing it with tolerance and...</i>

1999
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:21,107
No, they're not,
but Islam, uh, is...

2000
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:23,243
Can we stop talking about Isis?

2001
01:31:23,245 --> 01:31:25,879
Cervantes was captured
by Barbary pirates

2002
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:28,448
and taken to Algiers and there
was a price on his head.

2003
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:32,118
And when the ransom was paid, he
let his brother go instead of him.

2004
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,687
- Is that true?
- That is true.

2005
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:35,856
He let his brother go
when he could've gone?

2006
01:31:35,858 --> 01:31:37,257
- Yeah.
- Wow.

2007
01:31:37,259 --> 01:31:38,391
I know.

2008
01:31:38,393 --> 01:31:39,993
Not sure I'd do that.
Would you do that?

2009
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:42,963
- Let your brother go?
- Uh, probably not.

2010
01:31:42,965 --> 01:31:44,364
<i>No, I don't think I would either</i>

2011
01:31:44,366 --> 01:31:46,466
even with the best one
in the world.

2012
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:49,069
I think if my child was there,
they could take my child.

2013
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:51,838
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
- I'd let any child go.

2014
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,307
- Any child?
- Any child.

2015
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:56,676
As long as it, you know, I mean..
Not, not any child.

2016
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,979
I mean, they'd have to be
worth the effort.

2017
01:31:58,981 --> 01:32:02,115
Well, Cervantes, when he tried
to escape, he was captured.

2018
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:04,017
He had a noose around his
neck, he was taken to Hassan

2019
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:05,519
the leader of Algiers

2020
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:09,322
and he became his lover to
literally save his neck.

2021
01:32:09,324 --> 01:32:10,490
- Bum or neck?
- Yeah.

2022
01:32:10,492 --> 01:32:11,958
If that's what
it comes down to, yes.

2023
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,928
- <i>Life or bum.</i>
- Well, either way, you're buggered.

2024
01:32:15,964 --> 01:32:18,465
Let me say now, I'm in.
I... I, uh...

2025
01:32:18,467 --> 01:32:20,901
- really?
- He's in, rather. He's in.

2026
01:32:20,903 --> 01:32:23,737
Ah, but they became lovers,
so it'd be in out, in out.

2027
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:25,171
- <i>All...</i>
- See that ferry?

2028
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:28,408
- Yeah.
- That's the ferry for Africa.

2029
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:29,809
- <i>Really?</i>
- Hm.

2030
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:38,652
<i>Yeah, it's always good to
say goodbye in the mist</i>

2031
01:32:38,654 --> 01:32:41,688
like, uh, the end
of "Casablanca."

2032
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:45,725
Could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

2033
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,527
Could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

2034
01:32:47,529 --> 01:32:48,648
Could be the start of
a beautiful friendship.

2035
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:49,296
You gotta get the depth.

2036
01:32:49,298 --> 01:32:51,331
I got the depth right there.

2037
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:55,235
<i>Look at that mystical city.</i>

2038
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:03,410
Right. I'm gonna make
a move. Um, early flight.

2039
01:33:03,412 --> 01:33:06,012
- Okay.
- Yeah. Me, too, actually.

2040
01:33:06,014 --> 01:33:09,583
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm. Oh.

2041
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:12,085
- We say our goodbyes now.
- Okay, okay.

2042
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:13,453
Yeah. Sure you're gonna
be alright?

2043
01:33:13,455 --> 01:33:15,822
- Yeah. Yeah, no, it's, uh..
- Okay.

2044
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:17,591
I'm gonna look forward to
this week, writing and...

2045
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:20,293
- Alright, good.
- What have you, you know?

2046
01:33:20,295 --> 01:33:22,495
Hey, what can we say?

2047
01:33:22,497 --> 01:33:24,731
- It's been a week.
- <i>It has.</i>

2048
01:33:24,733 --> 01:33:27,167
And I'll see you..

2049
01:33:27,169 --> 01:33:29,569
In another country.

2050
01:33:29,571 --> 01:33:30,971
<i>- In the future.
- Yeah, in the future.</i>

2051
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:32,973
<i>- Have fun now.
- Yeah, okay.</i>

2052
01:33:32,975 --> 01:33:34,808
Bye.

2053
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:36,443
Now I disappear into the mist.

2054
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:40,413
Could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

2055
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,472
- <i>Buenos Dias.</i>
- Hi.

2056
01:34:39,474 --> 01:34:41,107
- Oh, you're English.
- Yeah.

2057
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:43,810
My name's Ambrose. I'm the
son of the owners here.

2058
01:34:43,812 --> 01:34:45,011
Oh, right. Great, great.

2059
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:46,079
Hey, can I help you
with your bags?

2060
01:34:46,081 --> 01:34:47,447
Yeah, sure.

2061
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:52,452
So, this will be your room.

2062
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:54,421
Oh, this is great, yeah.
Very cozy.

2063
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:59,325
Now we thought there were
going to be two of you, but..

2064
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:02,228
Yeah, my son, uh, was gonna come,
but he, he couldn't make it.

2065
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:03,963
Oh, well.

2066
01:35:03,965 --> 01:35:05,498
Right. Well,
I'll leave you now.

2067
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,434
Okay. How... how old
are you, by the way?

2068
01:35:07,436 --> 01:35:09,903
- Seventeen.
- Oh.

2069
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:11,104
Well, okay.
Thank you.

2070
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:13,139
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Ambrose.

2071
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:26,920
<i>- Guess who it is.
- Hey!</i>

2072
01:35:26,922 --> 01:35:28,788
<i>How... how's it been?</i>

2073
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:31,057
- It was good.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

2074
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,859
- <i>Where's the team? Hiya.</i>
- We're all here.

2075
01:35:32,861 --> 01:35:34,260
- Oh.
- Where are you?

2076
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:35,261
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

2077
01:35:35,263 --> 01:35:37,197
- Oh. We missed you.
- Come on.

2078
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:40,400
- Daddy.
- <i>Come on.</i>

2079
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:44,738
<i>- How's my girl?
- Good.</i>

2080
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:45,839
<i>- You good?
- Good.</i>

2081
01:35:45,841 --> 01:35:47,741
- Who's your favorite parent?
- You.

2082
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:50,844
- Yay!
- Thanks. Okay.

2083
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:53,346
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

2084
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:55,982
<i>How are you?</i>

2085
01:35:55,984 --> 01:35:58,451
- I'm good.
- Where are you?

2086
01:35:58,453 --> 01:36:01,321
I'm in, uh, Andalucia

2087
01:36:01,323 --> 01:36:04,023
in... in the mountains.
It's great.

2088
01:36:04,025 --> 01:36:05,925
Is Joe there?

2089
01:36:05,927 --> 01:36:09,596
No, he's not, no. Look,
you should come out here.

2090
01:36:09,598 --> 01:36:11,765
I can't.

2091
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:13,566
Why not?
What is it, work?

2092
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,101
I just can't.

2093
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:17,904
Why, why not?

2094
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:21,441
I'm pregnant.

2095
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:25,478
- What?
- <i>Yeah, I know it's stupid.</i>

2096
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:30,316
Well, is it mine?

2097
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:33,386
No.

2098
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:40,727
- Is it Adam's?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

2099
01:36:41,695 --> 01:36:43,296
<i>Are you sure?</i>

2100
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:46,132
Pretty sure.

2101
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:49,269
I thought you weren't
sleeping with him anymore.

2102
01:36:49,271 --> 01:36:52,505
Look, I gotta go. He's
waiting for me downstairs.

2103
01:36:52,507 --> 01:36:54,841
What, what,
he's back in New York?

2104
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:59,312
Yeah.
Look, I gotta go.

2105
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:02,015
I'm sorry.
Take care.

2106
01:37:18,533 --> 01:37:20,934
It's the number one song
in the charts.

2107
01:37:20,936 --> 01:37:22,468
<i>"Turtle on your head."</i>

2108
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:23,903
I thought Charlie
was gonna be in bed.

2109
01:37:23,905 --> 01:37:25,905
Well, technically, he's in bed now.
Aren't you, Charlie?

2110
01:37:25,907 --> 01:37:27,827
- Yeah, he's in his bed.
- 'Cause dinner's ready.

2111
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:34,848
Uh..

2112
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:36,115
No, no<i> esta noche.</i>

2113
01:37:36,117 --> 01:37:37,984
<i>- Muy bien.
- Soy no muy hambriento.</i>

2114
01:37:37,986 --> 01:37:39,552
<i>Muy bien, Gracias.</i>

2115
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:46,159
- Mm.
- Oh, I've missed you.

2116
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:48,795
Mm. I've missed you too.

2117
01:37:48,797 --> 01:37:51,798
But now he was back
and there's no reason

2118
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,134
that we can't resume
hostilities..

2119
01:37:56,203 --> 01:38:00,373
As we did before he left.

2120
01:38:02,077 --> 01:38:03,843
- Oh, god.
- Right.

2121
01:38:03,845 --> 01:38:05,645
- That's you, not me.
- No, it's your turn.

2122
01:38:05,647 --> 01:38:07,080
- You can climb over.
- I..

2123
01:38:07,082 --> 01:38:08,414
- Come on.
- I've been doing it all week.

2124
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:10,216
I've been away for a week.

2125
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,289
Quickly, and then we can get
back to what we were doing.

2126
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:18,591
Oh, no, the moment's gone.
You can forget that.

2127
01:38:18,593 --> 01:38:20,493
I might've fallen asleep.

2128
01:38:20,495 --> 01:38:23,096
<i>What's the matter?
Did you drop him?</i>

2129
01:38:23,098 --> 01:38:24,864
Have you dropped him, eh?

2130
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:27,400
Did you want him?
Yes.

2131
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,409
The dragon looked back from
the top of the castle.

2132
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:39,479
He said, "I think
you're scared of me.

2133
01:38:39,481 --> 01:38:43,049
I'm the biggest dragon
in the whole world."

2134
01:38:43,051 --> 01:38:45,685
- It's gonna turn orange, isn't it?
- Yeah.

2135
01:38:45,687 --> 01:38:47,520
Right, darling,
have a gorgeous day.

2136
01:38:47,522 --> 01:38:50,323
Mommy's picking you up, okay? But
I'll be home when you get back.

2137
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,726
- Love you.
- Bye.

2138
01:38:53,728 --> 01:38:54,894
See ya, have a good day.

2139
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:36,769
<i>Hey, Joe.
It's dad. Um..</i>

2140
01:39:36,771 --> 01:39:39,272
I hope things are okay.
Uh, call me.

2141
01:39:39,274 --> 01:39:43,009
Let's, uh... Touch base.

2142
01:39:43,011 --> 01:39:44,444
Tell me what's going on.

2143
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:27,720
Hello. Hey!
How you doing?

2144
01:40:27,722 --> 01:40:28,855
Where are you?
It's noisy.

2145
01:40:28,857 --> 01:40:30,690
I thought you were
in the mountains.

2146
01:40:30,692 --> 01:40:33,659
It's just the streets
here in Malaga, you know?

2147
01:40:34,762 --> 01:40:36,362
You're not in a bar, are you?

2148
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:39,832
No, I'm not in a bar. No, no.
Hey, listen, uh..

2149
01:40:39,834 --> 01:40:42,668
Okay, so, I'm calling
because, uh..

2150
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:46,005
Um, I want to be with you.

2151
01:40:47,808 --> 01:40:49,709
- I know but...
- I don't care about the baby.

2152
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:50,910
I mean, I do care
about the baby.

2153
01:40:50,912 --> 01:40:52,078
What I mean is,
uh... uh..

2154
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,280
Yeah, I'll, I... I..

2155
01:40:54,282 --> 01:40:56,416
I... I'll bring it up
with you, you know?

2156
01:40:56,418 --> 01:40:59,719
We can raise it together.
Uh, it'll have two dads.

2157
01:40:59,721 --> 01:41:02,321
Lots of people do that.

2158
01:41:02,323 --> 01:41:04,157
Yeah, lots of gay men.

2159
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,025
So it'll have, like,
two dads and one mom.

2160
01:41:06,027 --> 01:41:09,095
That's... It'll be
a lucky kid.

2161
01:41:09,097 --> 01:41:11,764
I don't know. I'm in New
York, you're in London...

2162
01:41:11,766 --> 01:41:13,933
I'll move to New York.
I love New York.

2163
01:41:13,935 --> 01:41:14,975
You know that.
It... it's..

2164
01:41:17,338 --> 01:41:19,572
- <i>Why, why don't you come out?</i>
- I don't know.

2165
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:20,606
Come out.
And tell you what?

2166
01:41:20,608 --> 01:41:22,408
We can go
to the atlas mountains.

2167
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:25,711
Hey, do you remember that
hotel that you really like?

2168
01:41:25,713 --> 01:41:28,881
<i>It's, I mean, I can get the
ferry from here and, uh..</i>

2169
01:41:28,883 --> 01:41:31,517
You know, I can almost
see Africa from here.

2170
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:35,314
Ah..

2171
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,767
Oh.

2172
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,651
Hello.

2173
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,987
Nice surprise.

2174
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:19,058
You're here already.

2175
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:21,093
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

2176
01:43:24,398 --> 01:43:26,199
I've missed you.

2177
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,800
I missed you.

2178
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:32,772
<i>I love you.</i>

2179
01:43:58,466 --> 01:44:00,099
Oh, fuck.

2180
01:44:26,628 --> 01:44:27,960
Hello?

2181
01:44:27,962 --> 01:44:30,229
- <i>Oh, hello, Rob?</i>
- Hiya. Emma?

2182
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:33,399
Uh, I was just wondering.
Have you heard from Steve?

2183
01:44:33,401 --> 01:44:35,401
No.
Why, should I?

2184
01:44:35,403 --> 01:44:36,469
He's checked out of the hotel

2185
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:38,404
and I... I don't know
where he is.

2186
01:44:38,406 --> 01:44:40,773
Is he lost in la mancha?

2187
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:43,175
Yeah, he's normally on the
phone to me ten times a day

2188
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:45,111
which is why I'm a bit worried.

2189
01:44:45,113 --> 01:44:48,114
He'll be sitting somewhere
talking to a nun

2190
01:44:48,116 --> 01:44:51,550
and asking if she's
heard of Judi Dench.

2191
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:36,028
<i>Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar!</i>
