115
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,479

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,764
- You're right about
this being a better way.

145
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:19,679
This is more romantic.

146

- Buenos diaz, mi amigo.

167
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,521
- Buenos diaz, mi amigo.

168
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,719
- This is stunning.

169
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,519
- This the way to approach a new country.

170
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,442
- Did you sleep well?

171
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:38,199
- Yeah, like a, like a baby, yeah.

172
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,085
- It's lovely, isn't it?

173
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:40,605
- Yeah, well, it's the
gentle rocking motion.

174
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:43,524
I think you either have
sea legs or you don't.

175
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:47,605
- Santander, the largest city
in Cantabria by some margin,

176
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,839
population 200,000.

177
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,119
An elegant, stylish resort

178
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,439
with excellent transportation connections.

179
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,559
- Reading Lonely Planet?

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,439
- Just stuff I've picked up.
- Rough Guide?

181
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,805
- Stuff I've picked up over the years.

182
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:02,847
I'm a sponge.

183
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,319
- Yeah, um.
- Ah.

184
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,879
- I'm Charles.

185
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,879
- Prawns with sea salmon.
- Gracias.

186
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,927
- Nice fresh.
- Thank you.

187
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,926
- Muchas gracias.

188
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:20,888
Like mama used to make.

189
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,279
- Ah,.

190
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,611
- Bueno,.

191
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,519
- Thank you, gracias.

192
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,487
What did you say to him?

193
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,285
- I said it's charming, charming
that his mother made it.

194
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:30,403
You know, up at Leo's.

195
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:31,959
- What's happening in New York?

196
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,802
- I've been seeing a lot of Mischa.

197
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:34,559
You remember Mischa?

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,164
- The girl you were seeing
when we were in Italy?

199
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,366
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

200
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,002
- You're seein' her again?

201
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:43,125
- Didn't she get, she got...
- I, I'm in love with her.

202
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:44,849
- Thought she got married.

203
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,959
- She is married.

204
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,999
- Oh.

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,965
- Um, I know, it's not right,

206
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,244
- because it's not ideal.
- Carry on, take your time.

207
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,127
Give me details.

208
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:53,566
- It's not ideal, but we
just bumped into each other

209
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:56,759
and, uh, and you know, we just,

210
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,724
you could tell it was just there.

211
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:01,121
I smiled, I gave her one
of my smiles, and, uh...

212
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:03,771
- Well, I mean, you don't
have to say any more.

213
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:06,199
One of those smiles.

214
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,079
- Then like an anchovy, she
just wiggled into my net again.

215
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,920
- Is it exciting?

216
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:13,522
- It is exciting, but it's
not like the first time.

217
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:14,679
It's not like I don't know her.

218
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,001
It's like we've rekindled what
we had before and it's so...

219
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:18,123
- It's still exciting.

220
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,605
- Oh, yeah, it is.

221
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:22,519
- Us, you lose excitement
when you're married.

222
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,360
I'll tell you that.

223
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,325
- Yeah, well, you can't have everything.

224
00:08:24,326 --> 00:08:25,604
The thing is you can't have everything.

225
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,567
- You can't have everything.
- You can't have everything.

226
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:28,599
- That's my mantra, you
can't have everything.

227
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,442
- Yeah.
- When people complain

228
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,399
no, yeah, make a choice.

229
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,528
- Very, I, I couldn't agree
more, couldn't agree more.

230
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,519
- I have a young family.

231
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,245
For a man of my age, my kids are young.

232
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:38,799
- Yeah, how old's your wife?

233
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
- 43.

234
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,721
You just got those kids in,
just squeezed 'em in quick then?

236
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:44,919
- Yeah, yeah.

237
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,649
I'm not going the full Mick
Jagger and having them at,

238
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,642
he's having another one at 72.

239
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:50,559
- Ah, that's tough then.

240
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,919
- Ever met him?

241
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,762
- I have.

242
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:54,439
- I was at a party.

243
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,126
I was leaving, and I
heard from the balcony,

244
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,359
"Rob, Rob."

245
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,408
- Rob, hey, uh, Rob, Rob.

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,885
- Only, well, he didn't do the full,

247
00:09:04,886 --> 00:09:07,039
and I looked up, and he went,

248
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,559
"Don't throw those bloody spears at me."

249
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,559
I said, what?

250
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,767
He goes, "Don't throw
those bloody spears at me."

251
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,359
- Yeah, uh, no, no.

252
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,245
- He was doing Michael Caine.

253
00:09:15,246 --> 00:09:16,571
- I know, I know, but what you find

254
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,365
is that he speaks like, sometimes he,

255
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:21,165
so it's sorta like that
it's actually quite posh.

256
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,205
And sometimes he's quite,
such that you can say

257
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:27,601
that he's quite actually
sort of public school thing

258
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:30,251
going on, you know, and then
he goes sorta deep like that.

259
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:32,959
But, um, but uh, and uh.

260
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,279
You know, you got that whole
sort of, um, the peacock thing.

261
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,639
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

262
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,844
- He went, "Don't throw
those bloody spears at me."

263
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,682
And I went, oh, you're Michael Caine.

264
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,485
So I looked up at him and I said,

265
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,801
I've told you before, if
you're not gonna sing,

266
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:50,451
I don't wanna bloody know, now
get back in the other room.

267
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:55,319
And he want ah-ah-ah-ah, and
off he went, he loved it.

268
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,285
But had I had
- How'd it, uh...

269
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,406
- close conversation with
him, I would have said,

270
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:00,199
what are you doing having a child at 72?

271
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,601
- No, you know what, I
mean, it's not ideal,

272
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,279
but Charlie Chaplin was
knockin' 'em out in his 80s,

273
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,361
and that's not ideal either,

274
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:10,081
but we're positively
footloose and care-free.

275
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,605
We're like teenagers
compared to those guys.

276
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:13,679
- Yeah, yeah.

277
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,727
- We should enjoy this moment.

278
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:16,399
We're at the sweet spot in our lives.

279
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,240
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.

280
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,127
- We really are.

281
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:21,039
We're like ripe, you know.

282
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,879
I am in my prime.

283
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,722
That was Miss Jean,

284
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,562
I should play Miss Jean Brodie.

285
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:27,369
There's a lot of gender-swapping going on

286
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,959
now in big roles.

287
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,644
I could play Miss Jean Brodie.

288
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
<i>- HEY-</i>

289
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:43,201
- Oh.

290
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,248
- Thank you.
- Muchas gracias.

291
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,406
- You writing anything at the moment.

292
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:54,481
- Of course I am, yeah.

293
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:57,685
What I'm trying to do with
this odyssey through Spain

294
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:59,159
is do what Laurie Lee did.

295
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,207
See you don't know this about me.

296
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,441
About 30 years ago, when I was 18,

297
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,639
I came to Spain, backpacking,

298
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,166
after A-levels, before
I want to university,

299
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,642
and I met a woman called Sofia who was 37.

300
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,562
She basically showed me the ropes.

301
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:14,799
I lost my virginity to her.

302
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,006
- How many years ago?

303
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:18,799
- Well, it's 32 years ago.

304
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,290
- So she's now 70?

305
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,242
- Yeah, yeah, she's 70, yeah.

306
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:24,446
- Should we look her up?

307
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:26,119
- No, I saw, I met her.

308
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,239
She's massive.

309
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,401
- Saw her on a Vespa.
- Successful?

310
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:29,890
No, no, I mean fat.

311
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,999
- I think, the two of you
should give it another go.

312
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,047
- Yeah, but you're just being
- Why don't you just take her

313
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:37,559
- facetious, come on.
- Some Turkish delight.

314
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,085
- I think that's the last
thing she wants the most.

315
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:41,321
It's the one thing I do know about her.

316
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:45,919
Anyway, I want to write a
book about Spain and me.

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,762
- Is that why you bought
the Laurie Lee book?

318
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:49,841
- Yeah, well, he wrote
this when he was early 50s,

319
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,239
but it's about when he was 18,

320
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,685
so it's almost exactly the same as me.

321
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:56,119
- Cervantes wrote Don
Quixote when he was 50.

322
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,799
50's in many ways, I think...

323
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,039
- No, we're at the
sweet spot in our life.

324
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,439
- The best age, it's the sweet spot.

325
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,879
You've still got, touch wood, time.

326
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,206
- We're ripe, we're ripe fruit.

327
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:08,005
If you hang onto the branch any longer,

328
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:09,599
you're just gonna wither on the vine,

329
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,839
- and I won't do that.
- So what do you do then?

330
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,879
- Drop-

331
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,365
- Or do you wanna be plucked?

332
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,399
- You wanna be plucked, actually.

333
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,241
- I'd like much rather to
be plucked than dropped.

334
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:18,239
- Oh, I just caught myself.
- Who's gonna want you

335
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
at this age?

336
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,929
- You'd be surprised.

337
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,241
After Philomena, this opened
a whole new sort of chapter

338
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:33,799
for me in terms of like
the way my career has gone.

339
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,642
All the, uh-

340
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:35,923
- Co-wrote that, didn't you?

341
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:38,486
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I always co-write.

342
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:41,642
Really I'm kinda
like, I'm the one who talks

343
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:43,642
and has all the ideas,
and the other person's

344
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:45,719
kinda like a, sort of, typist.

345
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,365
- Would they view it that way?

346
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,647
- Oh, no, I would never say
that to them personally.

347
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:51,759
But I mean, but privately.

348
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,599
- These reviews I write myself of course.

349
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,565
- That's great.

350
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,400
I mean, how are you gonna do it?

351
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,242
- We're in Spain.

352
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,679
I'm gonna do it like Sancho
Panza and Don Quixote.

353
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,725
Two middle-aged men, who
were looking for adventure.

354
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:04,926
- That's not about...

355
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:07,651
- Don Quixote, idealist, dreamer,

356
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,999
- head in the clouds, yes.
- Yeah.

357
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,241
- And his solid, dependable friend.

358
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,199
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

359
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,839
- So what are you co-writing?

360
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,887
- It's called Missing.

361
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:27,719
It's about a man looking for his daughter.

362
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,285
- This'll be the follow-up to your film

363
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,362
about a woman looking for her son.

364
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:36,039
- Yeah, well, exactly, it's
the sister piece to that.

365
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,724
And if I do another one,
then it'll be a trilogy.

366
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:40,366
But, anyway, yeah, it's
about the two of them...

367
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,324
- He should be looking for something else?

368
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:44,561
You know to avoid the comparisons.

369
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:47,479
Maybe man looking for his car.

370
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,479
- The thing is you can do
man whose lost his car.

371
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,999
European filmmakers use huge, overbearing,

372
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,081
use thematic metaphors all the time,

373
00:13:57,082 --> 00:13:58,762
so it could be a guy looking for his car,

374
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:00,599
but actually he doesn't realize.

375
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,839
He thinks he's looking for his car,

376
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,046
but actually he's looking for something

377
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,559
much bigger than that.

378
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
- A van.

379
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,079
- Yeah, but the van of life.

380
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,239
The van of life.

381
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,519
- Well?

382
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,569
- Can we put this up?
- Can we close it?

383
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,719
- Come inside, come inside.

384
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,449
Are we going?

385
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
<i>Ream?</i>

386
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Thank you.

387
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,161
Have you ever seen rain like this?

388
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:41,288
- Oh, yeah, I was in on a,

389
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,887
I got stuck in a landslide overnight

390
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,360
on the west side of Thirlmere.

391
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,444
Stuck in a landslide,
had to stay overnight

392
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:52,568
- in the car for 18 hours.
- Hmm, hmm.

393
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:57,279
- I found out later I was in
the wettest spot in the country

394
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,011
- ever recorded in history.
- You've told me this before.

395
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,999
Told me this before.

396
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,923
- Um, you, you
asked, and that was...

397
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:06,919
- No, I asked you have you ever seen

398
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,959
anything like this?

399
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,323
- Obviously, if you
ask a question like that,

400
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,160
you also want some details.

401
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,762
- If it's a story
that you've told before,

402
00:15:11,763 --> 00:15:14,001
you say, yes, do you remember
that time in a landslide,

403
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:16,039
and I say, Oh, I remember.

- Hello, hello, uh, who's that.

432
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,565
- It's Jonathan, Matt's assistant.

433
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:11,844
- This is Steve Coogan for Matt, please.

434
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:14,922
- Oh, hey,
Steve, hey, yeah, um, look,

435
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:17,124
I was just gonna call you, actually,

436
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,090
to let you know that
Matt has left the agency.

437
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:21,799
- Uh, what?

438
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,041
- Yeah, he's gone to a management company.

439
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,963
Look it all happened very quickly,

440
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:30,279
and Lindeman wanted to check
it out before it was announced.

441
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,964
It's gonna be in the trades today,

442
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:35,359
so I will be taking over
all of Matt's clients

443
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,879
who stay at the agency.

444
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,720
Okay?

445
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,324
And, Steve, I just, I want to let you know

446
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,879
how excited I am about working

447
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,360
with you and representing you.

448
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,279
- That's the seat.

449
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,770
Okay, you are in holiday?

450
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:19,759
- No, no, I'm a writer.

451
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,171
- Yeah, you're a writer?

452
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,999
- And I had a movie at the Oscars.

453
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,523
You know the Academy Awards?

454
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:34,999
Yeah, one of my movies was, uh...

455
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,808
- Okay.

456
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:37,211
- So that was muy bien.

457
00:18:37,212 --> 00:18:38,326
- That's fine.

458
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,842
- And the winner is

459
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:56,959
- Steve McQueen.
- Oh, my god, I won it.

460
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,039
- I've won it!
- Sit down.

461
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,371
Sit down, Steve.

462
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,879
What, why?

463
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,881
I'm Steve Coogan.

464
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:05,370
- Steve McQueen.

465
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:08,039
- Oh, my god, Oh, sorry.

466
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Sorry.

467
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,679
Hey, Greg, it's Steve.

468
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,409
- Hi, Steve, how are you?

469
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,479
- Good, good.

470
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,562
- Good, good, you're out in
New, you're still in New York,

471
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:27,242
I hear very good things about the series.

472
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:28,765
- No, I'm in Spain with Rob.

473
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:30,319
That's okay.

474
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,119
- Look, Greg, did you know that
Matt had left the US agency?

475
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,686
- Yes, yes, I did, um,
yes I did know that.

476
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,245
I was going to call you actually.

477
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,965
- Did you know about this before I did?

478
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:43,079
- No, no, not at all, no.

479
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,208
- Right, and do you know
that his assistant, Jonathan,

480
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:46,962
is taking over his client list?

481
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:49,643
- Yes, yeah, you see, Jonathan,
I think, is very good.

482
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:52,041
I think he's very bright, so, you know.

483
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:55,010
- Uh, what's happening
with Matt's other clients?

484
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:59,085
- Uh, well, I know that, uh,
Ricky's, Ricky's gone with him.

485
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,329
And, um, Will Ferrell.

486
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,364
- Did he ask Ricky to go with him?

487
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:06,805
- Yes, yeah, he did.

488
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,479
- He didn't ask me.

489
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,162
- Yeah, well, you see, I think, I think

490
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:12,766
you're seen more as a
writer, Steve, I mean,

491
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:17,319
so you wouldn't need a manager
as well as an agent, so...

492
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,721
- So which clients are staying
with the new assistant?

493
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,768
- Uh, Kevin Klein, I can't really

494
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,039
see him going anywhere else.

495
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,159
Um...

496
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,039
- Look, uh, Greg,
will you do me a favor please?

497
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,319
Can you find out why
the script for Missing

498
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,559
hasn't been green-lit yet?

499
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,525
- That hasn't happened?

500
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:38,679
I mean that absolutely,
I know, I know, well,

501
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
that should have happened.

502
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,600
I'll get onto that, I'll
get onto that straightaway.

503
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:42,440
But, yeah...

504
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,441
- Thank you.

505
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,245
- So you're out in Spain with Rob Brydon?

506
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:47,401
- Yes, I'm with Rob Brydon.

507
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:48,481
- That must be fun.

508
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:51,639
- Yes, it's a lot of fun,
thank you very much, goodbye.

509
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
- Okay, bye.

510
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,679
- Victor Arguinzoniz uses
a cooking method so basic

511
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,639
even cavemen would recognize it.

512
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,206
And yet has become a point of pilgrimage

513
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:07,601
for food nerds from around the world.

514
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:11,571
Perhaps you regard yourself as
something of a barbecue king.

515
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:14,479
Compared to Victor you are a lightweight.

516
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,679
Little better than the caveman,

517
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,968
who first cracked the flints
together to get a spark

518
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:24,079
because he found raw mammoth
a bit tough on the teeth.

519
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,606
So it's essentially a barbecue.

520
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,288
Oh.

521
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:40,159
- The fresh cheese.

522
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,002
- Thank you.

523
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:42,679
- And the gold butter.

524
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,522
- Ah.
- Thank you.

525
00:21:43,523 --> 00:21:45,279
- They are homemade.

526
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,079
We have buffaloes in our farmhouse

527
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,399
and every clay to milk and
Victor makes the fresh cheese.

528
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,287
Enjoy.-

529
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:54,765
- Thank you, Ella.
- Thank you.

530
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:58,204
What she was saying was that
they have their own buffaloes.

531
00:21:58,205 --> 00:22:00,239
- Wasn't she saying it in English?

532
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,241
My sunny side were just...

533
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:04,119
- Your hearing, I've noticed your hearing

534
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,042
is not what it was.

535
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:06,201
Do you mind me saying that?

536
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:08,999
- Listen, stop distracting you and me

537
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,842
from the fact that your
Spanish is appalling.

538
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:13,888
I think what you were
trying to do before is

539
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,399
- Sorry, mate, my...

540
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,128
Bloody, bloody batteries.

541
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,199
Wait, wait, I can't, um, it's
playing up, hang on, hang on.

542
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,439
Right, try it again.

543
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:39,359
Ah, shit.

544
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,771
Steve, wait, wait, I
can't hear a word, mate.

545
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:42,639
It's the batteries.

546
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,039
Steve, I can't hear anything, shh.

547
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,199
Steve, Steve, stop, wait, I've got a...

548
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Very good.

549
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,731
- Okay, is that enough?
- Only you still can't do this

550
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:54,562
can you, no matter how hard you try,

551
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:57,163
you'll never be able to do
the small man in the box.

552
00:22:57,164 --> 00:23:00,721
- Whereas I think your small
man in the box is brilliant,

553
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:04,088
it is also the apotheosis of your career.

554
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,489
- Mm, incredible, mm.

555
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,005
- Sum it up for me.

556
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:16,810
- The butter is
life-affirming butter.

557
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:20,202
- Life-affirming butter, L-A-B.

558
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
The buffalo?

559
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
- Wow.
- Wow.

560
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,999
- This one is the homemade chorizo.

561
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,159
We buy Iberian pork meat from Salamanca

562
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,799
and Victor makes the chorizo
like his grandmother.

563
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,642
- Wow.

564
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:53,962
- Is same chorizo, just cooked or cured.

565
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,999
- Cooked or cured, okay.

566
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,279
- And one corn croquette.

567
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,165
- I just got...
- You're welcome.

568
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:07,439
- When she said he makes
chorizo like his grandmother

569
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,239
is that what she looked like?

570
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,205
- No, Rob, he means the way his
grandmother used to make it.

571
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:15,679
- Fine, well, I think
she should be more clear.

572
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,488
- Hm.

573
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:18,959
- Because I'm picturing
a grizzled old woman

574
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,201
with the external appearance of chorizo.

575
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:23,679
- Well, you're the
only person who is, mate.

576
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
- Ah.
- Mm.

577
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,079
Fantastic.

578
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,319
- Mm.
- Mm.

579
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,759
- Wow.
- I know.

580
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,890
If his grandmother tasted
like this, I'd have a nibble.

581
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,039
Come, come, Mr. Coogan, come, come.

582
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,679
You're beginning to thaw,
sir, beginning to thaw.

583
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,082
- No, I will laugh at stuff if it's good.

584
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,679
- The shoulder.

585
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,359
- What have you clone to it?

586
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,838
- Just gettin' outta bed in the morning.

587
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,682
Just pulled it.

588
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:00,839
- You can't rush outta bed.

589
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,683
You've gotta, you know
what I've been told to do?

590
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:04,759
Stretch while lying down.

591
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,759
- Gets your blood flowing.
- Before you rotate it?

592
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,489
- You look like a tentative Nazi.

593
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,319
- Oh, I sink vhat ve're doing, you know,

594
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,319
is so wrong on so many
levels, but I just can't stop.

595
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,759
- Why are your Nazis so camp?

596
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,479
Oh, I'm a Nazi, Oh.

597
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,279
- You tell me, Fuehrer.

598
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,406
- Heil Hitler.

599
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,407
Was he furious?

600
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:30,765
- Mm, he will be.

601
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,439
- Okay, we continue.

602
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,566
Green mussels.

603
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,799
With carrot juice.

604
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,529
- Carrot juice?
- Yes.

605
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,171
- Bueno.

606
00:25:50,123 --> 00:25:51,243
- Oh, no, no, Steve.

607
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:52,526
- Oh.
- Look, look, look.

608
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:53,599
- Go on then.

609
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,440
- But what do we do?

610
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:55,280
We, we...

611
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:56,086
- You just take them.

612
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,087
- Uh-huh.

613
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,210
- Mm, wow.

614
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,686
- Well, here it is, Mr. Coogan,
we managed to get it out.

615
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:08,162
Um, I mean, the good news is, it's benign.

616
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,559
The bad news is, we
found seven more of them.

617
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,530
Some of them have gone
into the lymph nodes.

618
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,086
Are you gonna read that
book while we eat lunch,

619
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:26,559
or you just brought it as a sort of badge?

620
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,679
- No, I brought it, so, because I'm,

621
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,119
I'm emulating his journey.

622
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,039
- As I walked out one summer morning.

623
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,962
What would your version be?

624
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:39,119
As I drove out one summer
morning in my V8 Land Rover.

625
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,962
- Range Rover.

626
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:42,725
- Range Rover, sorry,
that's a terrible mistake.

627
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,839
- Yeah.

628
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,159
- How much have you read?

629
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,079
- Um, about a quarter,

630
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,839
- but it's very good.
- For a thick book.

631
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,119
- Lord, no.

632
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,279
- One sauvignon blanc
- Ah, yes.

633
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,250
- To link with the grilled scallops.

634
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,919
The caviar is from Iran.

635
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,919
Enjoy.-

636
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,526
- It's stupendous, Iranian caviar.

637
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:14,399
- Please, go first.

638
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,290
- No, no, no,
no, please, you go first.

639
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,959
- Well, before I do, Scaramanga,

640
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,639
why don't I turn them that way?

641
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,563
In which case, should you have
interfered with my scallops...

642
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:28,244
- In my country it is always traditional

643
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:32,599
that the nearest scallop
is served to the guest.

644
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,321
- Where I come from it
is a custom to proffer

645
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,279
the larger scallop to the guest.

646
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,282
- In my country when such an offer is made

647
00:27:43,283 --> 00:27:47,199
it is traditional to turn
the plate 'round twice

648
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,521
and replace it on the table.

649
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,485
- Come, come, Mr. Bond,
you enjoy the scallop

650
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:55,159
just as much as I do.

651
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
Please, eat.

652
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,966
- Bottoms up.

653
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,930
- Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

654
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,685
Mr. Bond, goodbye.

655
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,879
- You should pay more
attention to your chef.

656
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,560
He's working for Her Majesty's government.

657
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,999
- Starter for 10, what
is the Camino de Santiago?

658
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,922
- Um.
- No?

659
00:28:46,923 --> 00:28:50,720
The pilgrims' route to
Santiago to Compostela,

660
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,521
where Saint James is
supposed to be buried.

661
00:28:54,522 --> 00:28:58,079
Became the most important
destination for Christians

662
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,439
after Rome and Jerusalem.

663
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,006
- I meant only to the ultimate
pilgrimage, to see the pope.

664
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,682
I went there with Philomena.

665
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:06,405
I introduced Philomena to the pope.

666
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:09,079
- And we welcome Philomena
back into the conversation.

667
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,286
It's been a good five to six minutes

668
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:11,765
since he last brought it up.

669
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,519
But no, no, go on, always nice to hear.

670
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,362
- Well, I mean, you know.

671
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:15,759
- So you were there for what?

672
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,600
- For the Cannes publicity tour?
- I can't pretend it's not

673
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:18,123
been a significant part of
my life, but there you go.

674
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,929
- I can't pretend it's not
been a significant part

675
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,809
of this bloody journey.

676
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,801
- Ah.

677
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,763
- This is nice, isn't it.

678
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:47,285
- Wonderful.
- Lovely.

679
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:51,079
- You look like the man
who'd follow James Bond,

680
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,759
not at a distance, in one
of the Sean Connery films.

681
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,125
- One of the early films.
- Who would never say anything

682
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:58,279
- Yes, yes.
- He'd never speak, mysterious

683
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,122
- Sinister figure.

684
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:01,599
- Sinister figure following him, yeah.

685
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,279
- Sos del Rey Catolico,
now what does that mean?

686
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,559
- Ah, del rey, is the
reign, the Catholic reign,

687
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,599
so it's the sos of the Catholic king,

688
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,919
because that's where King
Ferdinand was born, here.

689
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,760
- Right here.

690
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:17,567
- Right here, well not here,
but, you know, 'round here.

691
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,162
- He introduced the Spanish Inquisition?

692
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:20,000
- Yes, indeed.

693
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:20,808
- Are you sure about that?

694
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:23,039
- He was a catalytic converter, in a way.

695
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,324
- Very good, you're on fire.

696
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:25,325
- Cheers.

697
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,730
- You'd actually make a very
good Inquisitor, I think,

698
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,079
for the Spanish Inquisition.

699
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,002
- Don't take this the wrong way.
- No.

700
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:35,399
- You have an inquisitive nature.

701
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,731
- Mind, I have an inquisitive mind, yeah.

702
00:30:36,732 --> 00:30:39,039
- And you have a cruel side,
you do have a cruel side.

703
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,769
- There's not really, well,
it's certainly a short leap

704
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:44,890
isn't it, from curiosity
to, uh, murderous intent.

705
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,359
I mean, uh, I mean,
it's quite a large leap.

706
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,044
- It's a very large leap.
- It's a big leap.

707
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:52,441
If I was questioning you
and you were on the rack,

708
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:55,522
I'd start out with some
simple questions like,

709
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:57,681
I'd just say, okay, just warm yourself up.

710
00:30:57,682 --> 00:30:59,159
Just give me a name, address,

711
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,127
tell me what you had for breakfast.

712
00:31:00,128 --> 00:31:02,039
- Rob Brydon, London.

713
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,084
- Yeah, and what'd you have for breakfast.

714
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:06,359
- Scrambled eggs.
- Lovely stuff, okay.

715
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,325
<i>- Uh, Rob...
- Ks that 'm?</i>

716
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:08,160
- Can I go now?
- No, no, no.

717
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:09,002
Gonna ask you a few more questions.

718
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:11,970
- Just, uh, just take it easy.
- I can't, it's really hurting

719
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:15,199
- What is your favorite kind of music?

720
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,519
- Bruce Springsteen.
- Okay, all right, okay.

721
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,601
- Is that is?
- No, no, no.

722
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:22,239
No, no, no, how many BAFTAs have you won?

723
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,080
- What?

724
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:23,922
- How many BAFTAs have you won?

725
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,519
- I can't hear you.

726
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,719
- Okay, okay, just give
it another notch, guys.

727
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,563
- How many BAFTAs...
- I've a Welsh one.

728
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:31,449
- I've got a Welsh one.
- Well, one Welsh BAFTA.

729
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,039
Thank you, you see how easy that was?

730
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,486
You see how easy it was
to answer the question?

731
00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:38,079
Okay, now...

732
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,718
- I've been nominated seven
times for the normal ones.

733
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,687
- I didn't ask you that.

734
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:41,966
Notch, give him another notch.

735
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,439
How tall is he?

736
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,799
Five 8 1/2.

737
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,119
- Ooh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

738
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,361
- Ooh, ooh.
- That's not bad, eh?

739
00:31:51,362 --> 00:31:54,519
Okay, one more question that
you won't want to answer,

740
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,885
because we're trying to
get you up to five-nine.

741
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:58,446
I'm on your side here.

742
00:31:58,447 --> 00:32:00,559
Do you want to quit at
five-eight, five 8 1/2,

743
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,719
or do you want to go for five-nine?

744
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,562
- I'll go for five-nine!

745
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:04,289
- He's gonna go for the five-foot-nine!

746
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,919
Okay, one more question.

747
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,559
- Oh, sh!
- Rob.

748
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,359
- Yeah.
- Do you believe

749
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,679
in the Lord God Almighty?

750
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,199
- I'd rather not say.

751
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,962
Get him a couple notches.

752
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:16,562
- And we're at five-nine.
- Oh, thanks.

753
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:17,686
- Five-nine, let him go.

754
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,519
You leave here as a five-foot-nine
man, congratulations.

755
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,405
- Thank you, Steve.

756
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:23,811
- Oh, I've hit my head.
- I'm sorry for the pain.

757
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:24,924
There you go, that's gonna be a problem

758
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:25,805
you're gonna have to contend with now,

759
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:27,450
and you shall have to let
your trousers down, too.

760
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:30,091
Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Brydon.

761
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,686
' Oh-ah!

762
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,881
- This is the area
Terry Gilliam was in

763
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:22,839
when he was trying to do Don Quixote.

764
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,205
- Lost in La Mancha is the documentary

765
00:33:24,206 --> 00:33:25,770
about his failure to do so.

766
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:28,119
- It's a show I would like to do

767
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,960
- about La Mancha.
- Lost in La Mancha?

768
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:30,450
- Oh, Man of La Mancha?
- Man of La Mancha

769
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:32,039
is the stage musical.

770
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,361
It might be my next theatrical venture.

771
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:35,679
- Really?
- Yes.

772
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,729
You get to sing The Impossible Dream.

773
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,119
Given that this is Rioja,

774
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,999
I would've thought we'd
see a lot more vines.

775
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,525
- It's of no interest
to me these clays, Rob,

776
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,759
because I no longer drink alcohol.

777
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,081
- I like wine, I like Rioja.

778
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,359
What's with all the dinosaur signs?

779
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,771
- I suppose there's lots of dinosaurs

780
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,399
that used to live 'round here.

781
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,119
- I say we visit, because
Chloe loves dinosaurs.

782
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,439
- Who's Chloe?

783
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,441
My daughter.

784
00:34:09,442 --> 00:34:10,487
- Oh.

785
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,679
- I'm gonna put my boots on.

786
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,639
- Your boots on?
- Yeah.

787
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,482
Dusty.

788
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:53,608
- We're gonna go in there?

789
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,879
- Love these boots.

790
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,804
- Yeah, no, they're
good intermediate walking shoes,

791
00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:05,406
those, but you couldn't touch Crampons,

792
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,359
if there was any ice.

793
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,803
- I don't plan to go on any ice.

794
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:11,285
- No one plans for ice, Rob.

795
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:12,441
You gotta be prepared

796
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:14,079
if some suddenly appears.

797
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,922
You see?

798
00:35:14,923 --> 00:35:18,481
They're not very good
for scree work either.

799
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,887
You just gotta be decisive
about where you put your feet,

800
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:22,888
that's all.

801
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,406
- Do a picture of
me with the dinosaur.

802
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,559
- Which one's the dinosaur?

803
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,359
Okay, uh, seeing as the dinosaur's doing

804
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,079
a McCartney-style thumbs up,
then why don't you mimic that?

805
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,809
- Hey, rock-and-roll.

806
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,319
I mean, Ringo, he was actually
a good drummer, you know.

807
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,527
What's that dinosaur called?

808
00:35:57,528 --> 00:35:59,921
- Barney.
- No, it's a T. Rex.

809
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,559
- It's actually not, it's a Iguanodon.

810
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,319
- How do you know?

811
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,959
- Throw the phone?

812
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,839
Because Chloe is an expert.

813
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,001
- Well, tell me this.

814
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,365
Why have they changed the name

815
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:15,039
of a Brontosaurus to a Brachiosaurus?

816
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,880
No one else have given me

817
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,848
- an adequate explanation.
- Brontosaurus which would

818
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:20,319
previously roam the lands.

819
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,284
- Who's that?
- It's John Hurt.

820
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:23,359
- That's not John Hurt.

821
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,200
- Who is it then?

822
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:25,565
- I don't know, but if
you're gonna do John Hurt,

823
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:26,879
you have to, um...

824
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,441
The Brachiosaurus would
once roam the land,

825
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,279
the king of all it surveyed.

826
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,770
- That's a very good John Hurt.

827
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:37,922
- King of all he surveyed.

828
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,041
It's a combination of him as

829
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,039
Quentin Crisp and Caligula in I, Claudius.

830
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,769
- Why are you standing?
- You can go away now, Rob.

831
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,890
I was thinking of killing
you, but I've changed my mind.

832
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,479
So does Chloe know
about the different, uh,

833
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,766
prehistoric periods.

834
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,159
- Yep-

835
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,599
Well, you know, she, not to where

836
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,762
- she could sit an exam.
- Does she know Triassic,

837
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,489
Jurassic, Cretaceous?

838
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,803
- She knows some of
those, she knows the words.

839
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:13,399
I'm not gonna pretend that
she could give a lecture.

840
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,165
- Of course in the Triassic period

841
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,879
the world is one land
mass, just with the sea,

842
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,924
and that was it, one body of land.

843
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,684
And in the Jurassic period,

844
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:29,239
split into two big lumps of land.

845
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,368
And then finally the Cretaceous,

846
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:34,999
it broke off into the
continents that we know today.

847
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,491
- Oh, look there.

848
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,479
The actual footprints.

849
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,084
- They're big aren't they?

850
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:47,159
What size are your feet?

851
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
- Seven.

852
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,726
- Really?
- Yeah.

853
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,486
- Go on, then, off you go.

854
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:56,159
- No, it's just that is quite feminine.

855
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,685
- They're too small.
- Quite feminine.

856
00:37:57,686 --> 00:37:59,123
- They are feminine, I know.

857
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:01,042
- I'm not gonna be...
- Small feet.

858
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:03,359
Nice on a woman but weird on a bloke.

859
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
- Indeed.

860
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,479
If I could change one thing about me,

861
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,527
well, it wouldn't be the feet,

862
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:12,119
but I would get to the feet quite soon.

863
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,884
- It'd be feet, height,
and hair, wouldn't it?

864
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:15,405
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

865
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
- Ah.
- Oh.

866
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,762
- Gracias.

867
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:38,119
- Muchas gracias.

868
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,359
- Muchas, muchas gracias.

869
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
- Well?

870
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,759
- No, thank you.

871
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,927
- What was he asking?

872
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,287
- Do you want some more wine.

873
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,439
Mm, mm.

874
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,519
- Terrible year in many ways.

875
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,566
If you think about the
number of people who've died.

876
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:06,759
I mean gifted people.

877
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
- Yeah.

878
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,243
David Bowie's death was like,

879
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:11,401
what did Tony Visconti say?

880
00:39:11,402 --> 00:39:13,679
It was an artistic actor's death.

881
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,489
- What he did was remarkable.
- He just disappeared.

882
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,641
No funeral, he literally just went fshoo.

883
00:39:17,642 --> 00:39:19,759
- Had a song called
Lazarus on his last record.

884
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,649
- Yeah, it was wonderful,
it was actually brilliant.

885
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,359
- Yeah, it was, it was admirable.

886
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,124
Told you about the time
he was on the radio,

887
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,122
and, uh, he wanted to mention me,

888
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:30,239
but couldn't remember my name.

889
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,048
- Really?

890
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:32,565
- Mm, he was being interviewed,

891
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:34,799
and, uh, the interviewer said,

892
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,600
what do you do when
you're on tour on the bus?

893
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,319
And he said he watched Cruise
of the Gods that we did.

894
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,606
And he said, you know, the one that,

895
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:45,559
it stars that guy.

896
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,400
- And he said, who?
- Really?

897
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:47,208
- Yeah, he said, who?

898
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:49,926
And I was in the kitchen,
and I, oh, what, my god,

899
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:51,519
he's about to mention me, David Bowie.

900
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,360
- Sure he didn't mean me?

901
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:53,247
- No, no, no, no, because he said,

902
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:55,604
you know, the one from Marion and Geoff.

903
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:56,639
- Really?
- Yes.

904
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,482
- He said Marion and Geoff?
- Yes.

905
00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:59,524
- Wow.
- And I was going it's me!

906
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:01,363
And the interviewer was going,

907
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:03,759
Oh, I don't know, I don't know.

908
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,330
So he never said my name.

909
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:08,559
But he was thinking of
my face at that moment.

910
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,919
And when he died, I looked
at has Twitter feed,

911
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,967
and do you know what, Steve?

912
00:40:12,968 --> 00:40:15,088
He followed me on Twitter.

913
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,920
- Really?

914
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:19,082
- You don't know what to do
with that information, do you?

915
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,764
- Well, no disrespect to you,

916
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:23,679
but he's just ever so slightly,

917
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,319
I mean, microscopically
diminished in my mind.

918
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,721
- Just think, and I know
you won't like this,

919
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,882
there remained a time when he sat there

920
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:35,439
with his phone, and went,

921
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,399
♪ Shall I follow him?

922
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,639

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,559

930
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,039
♪ In his later years

931
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,485
And he would've pressed on that button

932
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:09,530
and clicked and followed
me and seen every Tweet.

933
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,241
- And as you know
this was a Moorish castle,

934
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,288
and when it was conquered
by the Christians

935
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:37,479
it became the official residence

936
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,289
of the.

937
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,599
- Please.
- Thank you.

938
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,204
- You're welcome.

939
00:41:43,205 --> 00:41:44,999
And during the Civil War,

940
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,679
the town was bombarded
by the Condor Legion

941
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,479
and the castle was hit...

942
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,811
- At Castelo Guernica?

943
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:56,359
- Yeah, la Guernica, the
last resistance of the town

944
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,319
took place in the cathedral.

945
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,799
And it was bombarded
too, and they surrendered

946
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,483
because they didn't
have any more ammunition

947
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:05,528
- Yes, of course, wow.
- Or food to resist

948
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:06,931
the final attack.

949
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,879
Over there we have a
room that was a setting

950
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,646
for a Marlon Brando's
movie in the early '90s.

951
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,959
He played the role of Friar Torquemada,

952
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,845
who was the Grand Inquisitor here.

953
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:23,569
- Of course, the Spanish Inquisition.

954
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,359
- Yeah.
- Nobody expects that.

955
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,239
- Monty Python.

956
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,363
- I love them, too.

957
00:42:31,364 --> 00:42:32,799
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

958
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,847
- Good.
- Please, after you.

959
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:36,079
- To the left.
- Yes, of course.

960
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,525
- This is Jonathan.

961
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:39,959
- Hey, Jonathan, Steve Coogan.

962
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,759
- Steve, hey, how are you, man?

963
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,919
- Good, how are you?

964
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,410
- Yeah, I'm great, so, listen,

965
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:47,359
I spoke to the studio.

966
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,202
- Mm-hmm.

967
00:42:48,203 --> 00:42:50,005
- And they like the script.

968
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:52,128
They're totally on board for this film.

969
00:42:52,129 --> 00:42:54,119
- Fantastic, great.
- Yeah?

970
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,042
- What's the catch?

971
00:42:55,043 --> 00:42:59,319
- Yeah, uh, they
want to bring a new writer on.

972
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,240
- What?

973
00:43:00,241 --> 00:43:01,321
- Well, it's for a polish,

974
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:03,002
it's just for a polish, it's...

975
00:43:03,003 --> 00:43:04,406
- Hey, how are we doing?

976
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:05,731
- Hello, how are you?

977
00:43:05,732 --> 00:43:07,679
- Yeah, really good.

978
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,559
Ah, oh, where'd you get that?

979
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,721
- I found out here.

980
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,166
- I thought you'd lost that,
I thought I'd hidden it.

981
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:15,719
Who?

982
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,243
- Ed Hirsch.

983
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:18,439
- I don't, who's he?

984
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,280
Never heard of him.

985
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:20,086
What's he clone?

986
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:21,366
- He's written a few
scripts that have really

987
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:22,771
just gotten a lot of heat.

988
00:43:22,772 --> 00:43:23,999
- Look over here!

989
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,119
Charlie, I'm here, look!

990
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,882
A little fella that...

991
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:28,243
- Uh.
- There, hello.

992
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:31,289
- He's new, he's
hot, he's up and coming.

993
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,279
- I've got
two Oscar nominations.

994
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,279
I'm new, and I'm not up
and coming, I've arrived.

995
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
Oh.

996
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,559
- Good evening.

997
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,559
- Good evening.
- Buenos tardes.

998
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,959
Isn't it a magnificent room?

999
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,639
- It's the Brando room.

1000
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,999
I just watched a little
clip on YouTube of him.

1001
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,839
You can't really work up
exactly where they are.

1002
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,479
He's very overweight at that stage.

1003
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,479
- Yeah, which is fine for Torquemada.

1004
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,879
Gives him presence.

1005
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,319
- I'm gonna be playing Torquemada

1006
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,079
from the Spanish Inquisition.

1007
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,479
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

1008
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,959
- Nobody does.
- Amongst our weaponry

1009
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,639
are such diverse elements
as fear, surprise,

1010
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,607
a ruthless efficiency,

1011
00:44:26,608 --> 00:44:28,841
and an almost fanatical
devotion to the pope.

1012
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:30,959
And nice red uniforms.

1013
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,599
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

1014
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,809
Amongst our weaponry is fear, surprise,

1015
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,599
a ruthless efficiency,

1016
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,645
and an almost fanatical
devotion to the pope.

1017
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:45,083
- You're doing him in The Godfather.

1018
00:44:45,084 --> 00:44:46,159
- Huh.
- You're just doing Marlon

1019
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,208
- Brando in The Godfather.
- Just doing '70's Brando.

1020
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:50,484
And it was more like this,
and, like, kinda nasally.

1021
00:44:50,485 --> 00:44:52,528
- You know what, his
voice was a little higher,

1022
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:53,799
the way he spoke.

1023
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,359
It was, you know, it
was like that, you know?

1024
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,519
- You've got a De Niro thing.
- When he spoke to people.

1025
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,759
- Why are you doing your De Niro.

1026
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,523
- If I was going De Niro, I'd
do it like that, you know?

1027
00:45:03,524 --> 00:45:04,846
That's the way,

1028
00:45:04,847 --> 00:45:06,559
that's the way De Niro spoke, you know?

1029
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,402
- That's good.
- Let's do something

1030
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:08,439
about that, you know?

1031
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,282
That's right, you know what I'm' gonna do?

1032
00:45:09,283 --> 00:45:10,439
I'm gonna rip your head off,

1033
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,726
shit down your goddam fuckin' neck,

1034
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:14,041
you two-bit, dick-suckin',
motherfuckin' asshole.

1035
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:15,519
- That's terrific, that's terrific.

1036
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,361
- Yeah, well, the reason
you think I'm doing De Niro

1037
00:45:17,362 --> 00:45:19,044
when I'm doing Brando, is
because De Niro himself

1038
00:45:19,045 --> 00:45:21,079
was influenced by Brando.

1039
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,479
So when De Niro acts,

1040
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,119
you see residual elements of Brando

1041
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,009
in what he does, so you've
got it the wrong way around.

1042
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,284
- So in attempting to criticize you,

1043
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:33,085
I've inadvertently complimented you.

1044
00:45:33,086 --> 00:45:34,762
- You've shown up some of the detail...

1045
00:45:34,763 --> 00:45:38,526
- You shall only come out on
top in this exchange, then.

1046
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,559
- I'm only telling you the truth.

1047
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,479
- Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

1048
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,239
And nobody expects a comfy chair.

1049
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,527
- No, he's gotta do the, get

1050
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,759
the comfy chair.

1051
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,524
- Get the comfy chair.

1052
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,439
I'm like a turtle, look at me.

1053
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,719
- Get the comfy chair.

1054
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,839
- Get the comfy chair
and a piece of lettuce.

1055
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,239
I'm gettin' hungry.

1056
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,359
Amongst our weaponry is
such diverse I, to me,

1057
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,249
- Woody Allen.
- Woody Allen, yeah.

1058
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,404
- Yeah, amongst our weaponry
is such diverse elements as

1059
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,005
fear, surprise,

1060
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,571
and an almost fanatical
devotion to the Yankees.

1061
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,480
- Meh.

1062
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,168
- Do you wish to confess?

1063
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
- No.

1064
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,119
- You know all Jews were
told to leave the country

1065
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,799
by order of the Catholic king and queen.

1066
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,039
- Yes, but, I'm, I'm not a Jew.

1067
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,566
I'm a Catholic, Roman Catholic.

1068
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,281
- If you're Catholic, then
you must respect my authority.

1069
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,123
My authority comes from the pope.

1070
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:10,319
- I've met the pope.

1071
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,639
What it was, I met the
pope, I met His Holiness

1072
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,839
at the Vatican, and he saw a film I made.

1073
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,285
- You're lying.
- I'm telling the truth.

1074
00:47:19,286 --> 00:47:21,404
All right, all right,
he didn't see the film,

1075
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:25,007
his advisors did, and they gave
him a breakdown of the film,

1076
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,570
and he approved it.

1077
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,519
- You're, um, a heretic?

1078
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,639
- I am not a heretic, I'm
not Jewish, I'm not Muslim,

1079
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,641
I am a Roman Catholic.

1080
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,399
I promise you, I don't know the Quran,

1081
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,561
I hardly know the Old Testament.

1082
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,319
I was an altar boy, um...

1083
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,320
- Shh.

1084
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,567
Do you respect my authority?

1085
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,519
- Well.

1086
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,039
- Do you respect my authority?

1087
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,008
- Why are you,
why are you mumbling?

1088
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:54,002
- What, what did you say?

1089
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,891
- You're not enunciating, enuncio.

1090
00:47:57,892 --> 00:48:00,279
- I'm sorry, Esteban.

1091
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,601
Do you respect my authority?

1092
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,524
- Yes, I, yes I respect your authority.

1093
00:48:07,525 --> 00:48:08,567
- Take him away.

1094
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,561
- Do you know exactly
what's going to happen now?

1095
00:48:12,562 --> 00:48:14,604
I've not done anything, have I?

1096
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:16,644
Why are they taking me backwards?

1097
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:18,130
I've not done anything.

1098
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,290
Hey, guess where I'm taking
Joe at the end of this week.

1099
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Here, look.

1100
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,280
- Zip wire?

1101
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:39,122
- Yeah.

1102
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:40,159
Longest one in Spain.

1103
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,002
- Have you clone this already?

1104
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:43,526
- Yeah, I've done
about five in the UK,

1105
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,599
couple in Europe.

1106
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,559
- Word of warning, what's
the age limit on this?

1107
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,130
- There's no age limit,
as long as you fit.

1108
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:52,359
There's a height restriction.

1109
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,361
- Well, we were in Italy last year,

1110
00:48:54,362 --> 00:48:56,203
and there was whitewater rafting.

1111
00:48:56,204 --> 00:48:57,439
' Yeah?

1112
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,411
- So I thought I'd check
out, you know, the age.

1113
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,680
Eight to 55.

1114
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,082
So by the time Charlie's
old enough to do it

1115
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,605
- I'll be too old.
- That's ridiculous.

1116
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:10,761
- I know.
- 55?

1117
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,522
That's ridiculous.

1118
00:49:12,523 --> 00:49:15,043
- Why can you not whitewater raft at 55?

1119
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:17,324
I might get some fake ID
or something like that.

1120
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:19,891
- Yeah, you'll have to get
fake ID like a teenager.

1121
00:49:19,892 --> 00:49:23,279
- Uh, John Jones, born in 1970.

1122
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,279
I'm a carpenter from Wrexham.

1123
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,765
- You say you're a carpenter.

1124
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:29,081
- That's right.
- Simple question.

1125
00:49:29,082 --> 00:49:33,999
If building a bog standard,
uh, tongue-and-groove,

1126
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,719
glue-and-peg wooden bench for outside,

1127
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,046
what kind of wood do you choose,

1128
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,884
if you want it to weather
into a nice silvery patina?

1129
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:42,291
Ash, beech, teak?

1130
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,691
Simple question.

1131
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,880
You'll have to hurry.

1132
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:48,881
There's other people that want to get on

1133
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:50,319
this whitewater raft.

1134
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,559
- Um, could you tell me the woods again?

1135
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,039
- Ash, teak, beech.

1136
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,008
- Ash, teak, beech?
- Mm.

1137
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,759
- Beech.

1138
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,879
- No, mate, it's teak.

1139
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,281
Any carpenter worth his
salt'll tell you that.

1140
00:50:04,282 --> 00:50:05,599
- Don't cry, Charlie.

1141
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,963
- You're not, you're
not a carpenter, mate.

1142
00:50:06,964 --> 00:50:07,800
- Please let us go on.

1143
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:08,926
- On your way.
- It's the only chance

1144
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:11,321
- I've got to, I just want...
- On your way.

1145
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:13,321
- Don't cry, Charlie, don't cry.

1146
00:50:13,322 --> 00:50:14,885
Maybe Mommy can take you.

1147
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,439
Look at the boy, he's crying.

1148
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,010
- Oh come on, how old are you?
- Please don't be like...

1149
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:19,959
- What?
- How old are you?

1150
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,599
- I'm 56.

1151
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,759
- Oh, for Christ's sake,
go on, on your, get on.

1152
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,171
- Just, oh, please.
- Thanks, so, oh!

1153
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:27,319
Oh, I've got shooting pains down my arm.

1154
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,207
- Well, don't tell me that.

1155
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,487
I've just broken the
rules for you, you nob.

1156
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:33,599
- Give me a minute, I got lightheaded.

1157
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,879
All right, thank you.

1158
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,881
Come on, Charlie.

1159
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:37,245
Not so fast, son.

1160
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,679
- You know when walking downhill,

1161
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,602
it'd be good if you engage your abs.

1162
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:45,803
- Yeah, course.

1163
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:48,610
- And if you
engage your abdominals,

1164
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:51,079
it takes the pressure off your knees.

1165
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,762
- Who told you that?

1166
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:55,399
- It's just that you can
feel it anatomically.

1167
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,322
I figured it out.

1168
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:58,399
- Well at least stand up
to a focus group with it.

1169
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,604
- Well you wouldn't show
it to a focus group.

1170
00:50:59,605 --> 00:51:01,441
- Clinical trials, I wouldn't
send it to clinical trials.

1171
00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:02,771
- Exactly, they won't
show it to a focus group.

1172
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:04,487
- Clinical trials, that's
why I said clinical trials.

1173
00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:06,084
- Oh, okay, yeah, you
don't need clinical trials.

1174
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:08,683
If you listen to your
body, you'll figure it out.

1175
00:51:08,684 --> 00:51:09,966
It's like a shock absorber,

1176
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:14,319
so the knee doesn't have
to take all the impact.

1177
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,320
Wow.

1178
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,919
- Ah, big, bigger
than it looks from outside.

1179
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,810
- Hey, take your hat off in church.

1180
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,080
Bountiful.

1181
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,043
I'm trying to find out
where the bomb damage is.

1182
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:36,039
From, you know, from when
Franco and the Nazis.

1183
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,850
- Exhibition there, with
Cervantes and Shakespeare.

1184
00:51:38,851 --> 00:51:40,319
There, look.

1185
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,049
Why would they have the two
of them in one exhibition.

1186
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,079
- Ah, they both died in the same year.

1187
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,845
It seems they've done
a very good repair job.

1188
00:51:47,846 --> 00:51:49,246
Can't see any damage.

1189
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:52,764
- Well, maybe it wasn't this
part of it that got damaged.

1190
00:51:52,765 --> 00:51:55,730
- I mean the workmanship
of this is a testament

1191
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:58,679
to all the workers who
helped construct it,

1192
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,405
and yet Franco, very happy,

1193
00:52:00,406 --> 00:52:02,402
despite claiming to be a Catholic,

1194
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:05,599
to bomb the shit out of
a religious building.

1195
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,599
Which just shows you what
kind of a vandal he was.

1196
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,730
- We're having flooring
just like this in the kitchen.

1197
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,599
- Partners there.
- Yeah.

1198
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,571
- Buried, lying next to
each other for eternity.

1199
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,367
Brr.

1200
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,290
First collected edition of
Shakespeare's works, 1623.

1201
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,962
So, then, six years, seven
years after his death.

1202
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:47,359
Already they realized what they'd lost.

1203
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,920
Rob, Rob.

1204
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,207
Electronic '80s album cover.

1205
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,719
- Very good.

1206
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,519
I'm holding my stomach in while I do this.

1207
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,601
- Well, just
walking downhill is actually

1208
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:04,931
better for that, you know.

1209
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:09,084
- Yeah, but I hold it in
pretty much all the time now.

1210
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,681
Would you ever do
Shakespeare on the stage?

1211
00:53:19,682 --> 00:53:22,919
- I would have liked
to have played Hamlet.

1212
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,730
- That train has left the station.

1213
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,999
Who would you like to play now?

1214
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,239
- Olivier played him when he was 42.

1215
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,559
- Olivier was a better actor than you.

1216
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,447
- Well, a different actor.

1217
00:53:32,448 --> 00:53:35,639
- Better actor.
- A different actor.

1218
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,527
- King Lear?

1219
00:53:36,528 --> 00:53:38,359
- He's, old man.

1220
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,479
- Not old, he's he a father.

1221
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,641
You've got more in common with him

1222
00:53:40,642 --> 00:53:43,839
than you have with a teenager.

1223
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,767
Have you lost something?

1224
00:53:52,768 --> 00:53:54,569
- She is gone forever.

1225
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,282
I know when one is living and one is dead,

1226
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,328
and she is dead as earth.

1227
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,199
Lend me a looking glass.

1228
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,250
'Cause if her breath may
mist or stain the stone,

1229
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,045
why then she lives.

1230
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,119
- Very good, very good.

1231
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,007
Midsummer Murders.

1232
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:22,241
You're a father who's just
been told his daughter's

1233
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:24,891
just been killed in a road
accident, and that is effective,

1234
00:54:24,892 --> 00:54:29,279
and we're straight into
the adverts after that.

1235
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,926
- I have of late, though
wherefore I know not,

1236
00:54:31,927 --> 00:54:34,486
lost all my mirth, forgone
all custom of exercises.

1237
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:36,764
Indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition

1238
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:38,683
that it's goodly frame the earth.

1239
00:54:38,684 --> 00:54:42,439
Look you, this fine
O'erhanging firmament, the sky,

1240
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,967
it seems nothing to me but a
foul congregation of vapors.

1241
00:54:45,968 --> 00:54:48,201
Yeah-ah, Jumping Jack Flash.

1242
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,399
Stones do Shakespeare, come on!

1243
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,722
- Oh, oh, that this too, too solid flesh

1244
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,959
would melt and resolve itself into a dew.

1245
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,319
Oh, that the Everlastin' not fix

1246
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,085
his cannon 'gainst self-slaughter.

1247
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,839
- Has Russell Brand ever clone Shakespeare?

1248
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,679
- You're doin' Mick Jagger.
- Oh, no, god.

1249
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,520
- You're doing Mick Jagger.

1250
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,487
- We", I, urn!

1251
00:55:17,488 --> 00:55:18,719
- What you said.
- Hah!

1252
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,039
- Hah, what's that?

1253
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,644
- All right, yeah, all right.
- Huh, huh, huh!

1254
00:55:21,645 --> 00:55:22,719
That's not Mick Jagger.

1255
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,642
- That's only noises.
- Yes it is.

1256
00:55:23,643 --> 00:55:26,802
- Steve, you're doin' it wrong.
- Let's see what'll you have?

1257
00:55:26,803 --> 00:55:28,165
- Quiet and let me do it.

1258
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,719
- No, you can't do it,

1259
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,685
you're copying Morrisey.

1260
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:31,486
And he doesn't look like that.

1261
00:55:31,487 --> 00:55:32,320
- That's all gay.
- I see.

1262
00:55:32,321 --> 00:55:33,162
- He does like that.

1263
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,119
- A piece of work's mine, ah-ah-ah.

1264
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,359
- He goes really deep sometimes

1265
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,085
and you can't get down there.

1266
00:55:38,086 --> 00:55:39,241
It can only go up there.

1267
00:55:39,242 --> 00:55:41,321
He's gotten down, so do him properly.

1268
00:55:41,322 --> 00:55:43,399
- You saying I can't get down there.

1269
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,763
You're seriously saying
I can't get down there.

1270
00:55:44,764 --> 00:55:46,091
- No, let's stop, but
don't just say anything

1271
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,570
about Mick Jagger.

1272
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,440
Ah.

1273
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,959
- Gracias.
- Muchas gracias.

1274
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:06,600
- Si, si.

1275
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:07,647
- Ha-ha-ha-hah.
- I like wine.

1276
00:56:07,648 --> 00:56:09,051
No spoon or fork.

1277
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,599
Muchas gracias.

1278
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,090
- Uh-huh.

1279
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,764
- So, George Orwell came
over to Spain in 1936.

1280
00:56:19,765 --> 00:56:20,959
- Oh.

1281
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,759
One year after the birth of Elvis.

1282
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,999
- He came out to Barcelona with his wife.

1283
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,840
- With his wife.

1284
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:27,680
- She stayed there,

1285
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:28,839
- when he went to...
- Mini-break.

1286
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,680
She stayed there,

1287
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:30,520
- when he went to...
- It's a good place

1288
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:31,442
for a mini-break.

1289
00:56:31,443 --> 00:56:33,599
Is that what they were doing?

1290
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,519
Were they able to do that in those clays?

1291
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,488
- Do you want to learn anything
about the Civil War at all,

1292
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:39,199
or do you think it's like, I just think,

1293
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,725
no, I don't really give a
damn about the Civil War.

1294
00:56:40,726 --> 00:56:42,359
Not that interested in it.

1295
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,599
- I want to learn something
about the Civil War.

1296
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,161
- Okay, so he came out to
Barcelona, left his wife there,

1297
00:56:47,162 --> 00:56:49,683
went off to the front
to fight, 50 miles away.

1298
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:51,569
When he came back, he was so disillusioned

1299
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,999
with the intellectuals who
were back in Barcelona,

1300
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,729
when he went back there, he saw them all.

1301
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,399
They'd become bourgeois.

1302
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,763
They'd lost sight of their ideals.

1303
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:02,762
He said they were eating fancy
food in posh restaurants.

1304
00:57:02,763 --> 00:57:04,884
So he went back to the front one more time

1305
00:57:04,885 --> 00:57:06,723
and eventually got shot in the throat.

1306
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:08,799
Couldn't speak for six months.

1307
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,247
- Where's a bullet to the
throat when you need one?

1308
00:57:12,248 --> 00:57:15,483
I don't think if I were to say to Sally,

1309
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,081
I'm going off to fight, she
wouldn't stand there, just say,

1310
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:21,481
all right, you're going off to be killed.

1311
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:23,279
- Yeah, or kill.

1312
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,559
- That's a very good point,

1313
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,083
'cause that's something
else I couldn't do.

1314
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:27,842
- I wouldn't fight in a
war 'cause I've got kids.

1315
00:57:27,843 --> 00:57:28,727
- I got kids.

1316
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:31,559
- Yeah, but if I didn't
have kids, I think I would

1317
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,400
- be up for that.
- I don't think you would.

1318
00:57:32,401 --> 00:57:33,240
- I think I would.

1319
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,319
- I think you'd like to think you would,

1320
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,160
but I don't think you would.

1321
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:36,284
You could go and entertain the troops.

1322
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:37,884
You could go and do Alan
Partridge for the troops,

1323
00:57:37,885 --> 00:57:39,679
that's what you would do.

1324
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,001
And all these proper men, who
are giving over everything,

1325
00:57:42,002 --> 00:57:44,443
would love as you came out and went ah-ha.

1326
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:47,205
You know what I'd love, if a
sniper got you at that moment.

1327
00:57:47,206 --> 00:57:48,519
Ah-ugh.

1328
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,681
You didn't even finish the ah-ha.

1329
00:57:49,682 --> 00:57:51,199
You'd only got to ah.

1330
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,999
- I'd do that hah as my dying breath.

1331
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,204
- I don't think you would.
- I would.

1332
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,006
- No, you wouldn't.
- Ah,.

1333
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:57,081
- If it was to the head, you idiot.

1334
00:57:57,082 --> 00:57:58,603
- Ah, ha.

1335
00:57:58,604 --> 00:57:59,803
- You wouldn't say ah-ha.

1336
00:57:59,804 --> 00:58:00,926
- I'd get the ha out.

1337
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:02,559
- There'd be no ha.

1338
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,324
And I'd say, if Steve were here now,

1339
00:58:04,325 --> 00:58:06,199
I know what he'd say, ha...

1340
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
- Ha.
- Hm.

1341
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,320
- Hello.

1342
00:58:15,321 --> 00:58:16,242
- Hi, Steve.

1343
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,679
- Hello, Emma, love.

1344
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,362
- How are you, how's it going?

1345
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:21,328
- Doing very well, yes.

1346
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:23,919
- Good, good, how's Rob doing?

1347
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,439
- Rob is great, he's
going very well, indeed.

1348
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,883
- You're on, you're on...
- I'm good, I'm good.

1349
00:58:27,884 --> 00:58:30,121
- Yeah, you're on speakerphone,
that's why I'm being nice.

1350
00:58:30,122 --> 00:58:31,919
- Hiya, how are you?

1351
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,079
- I love you, I'm just, uh,
I'm calling to remind you

1352
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,445
that I'm coming out to see you tomorrow.

1353
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:36,599
Yay.

1354
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,479
- Thank god, I'm at a breaking point.

1355
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,719
- Oh, wow, okay, great, and
I'm bringing Yolanda with me.

1356
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,358
Due to the fact that
it's the New York Times?

1357
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,200
- Oh, great.

1358
00:58:45,201 --> 00:58:46,042
- And the Observer

1359
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:48,611
- I just want to remind
you, that they do want you

1360
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:52,919
to dress up as Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza, okay?

1361
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,999
- What a surprise.

1362
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,044
- Which one am I?

1363
00:58:56,045 --> 00:58:57,642
- You are to be our Sancho Panza.

1364
00:58:57,643 --> 00:58:58,562
Hey.

1365
00:58:58,563 --> 00:59:01,450
- Yeah, good,
supporting role, as ever.

1366
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,450
- The Parador de Cuenca
is a majestic former convent,

1367
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,879
careful, perched above the Huecar Gorge

1368
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,519
with stunning views of the old town.

1369
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,724
- Oh, so that's, look at that.

1370
00:59:28,725 --> 00:59:29,721
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Very nice

1371
00:59:29,722 --> 00:59:32,200
Now don't look at it too much.

1372
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,239
- Hello.

1373
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,765
- Hi, is that Rob Brydon.

1374
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:52,479
- Uh, speaking.

1375
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,999
- I've got Matt Jenkins for you.

1376
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
- Okay.

1377
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,039
- Hey, Rob Bryden.

1378
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,119
- Hello.

1379
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:01,962
Hi, Matt.

1380
01:00:01,963 --> 01:00:03,041
- Hey, man, how you doin'?

1381
01:00:03,042 --> 01:00:05,439
- Yeah, I'm all right, how are you?

1382
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,282
- I'm good, how's, uh, London?

1383
01:00:07,283 --> 01:00:08,324
- Oh, I'm in Spain.

1384
01:00:08,325 --> 01:00:10,129
I'm not in London, I'm in Spain.

1385
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,359
- Hi, Greg.

1386
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,159
- Hi, Steve, how are you?

1387
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,679
- I've been better.

1388
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:19,399
Do you know they brought a new
writer on to rewrite Missing?

1389
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,966
- Yeah, but it's nothing,
it's just, it's standard.

1390
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:23,803
Just for a polish, that's all.

1391
01:00:23,804 --> 01:00:27,799
- I'm with Steve, with,
uh, with Steve Coogan.

1392
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,839
- Ah, Steve Coogan,
yeah, yeah, good, good.

1393
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,161
- Is this the Matt that's Steve's agent?

1394
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:37,439
- Yeah, it is, well, no, I
mean, I've left the agency.

1395
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,090
We met at Sundance, you remember that.

1396
01:00:39,091 --> 01:00:42,559
- I've got two Oscar nominations.

1397
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,722
Uh, last film I wrote had four
Academy Award nominations.

1398
01:00:45,723 --> 01:00:47,322
- Yeah, I know, but Joey, he's really,

1399
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:48,924
he's great, he's up and coming.

1400
01:00:48,925 --> 01:00:50,239
UP and coming?

1401
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,605
I've up and come.

1402
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,402
I've already up and come.

1403
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:56,131
- You have, no, yeah, absolutely,
you have, Steve, you have.

1404
01:00:56,132 --> 01:01:00,839
- Look, lemme cut to the
chase, I saw you in the

1405
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,648
- Horseman.
- The Huntsman.

1406
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:04,119
- The Huntsman, saw you in The Huntsman.

1407
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,281
Thought you were fantastic, man.

1408
01:01:05,282 --> 01:01:07,281
I mean, really, you burnt up the screen.

1409
01:01:07,282 --> 01:01:09,404
You've got it, that little
midget walk you did.

1410
01:01:09,405 --> 01:01:12,244
The screen loves you, but you
were being underused there.

1411
01:01:12,245 --> 01:01:14,719
So let me cut to the chase, okay.

1412
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,562
You should be doing what
Nick Frost is doing.

1413
01:01:17,563 --> 01:01:19,961
- Well, I did, I did
The Huntsman with him.

1414
01:01:19,962 --> 01:01:21,166
- This is what I'm saying.

1415
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:24,919
You should be doing what
James Corden is doing.

1416
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,524
You know, he's the biggest thing on TV.

1417
01:01:26,525 --> 01:01:30,039
- I was with James in Gavin & Stacey.

1418
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,639
- I heard about that, it was
supposed to be fantastic.

1419
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,449
I, I, uh, missed it, but
I'll definitely get a copy.

1420
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,807
You know, you should
be the new Simon Pegg.

1421
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:40,159
You should be, you could be, you will be

1422
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,759
the new Ricky Gervais.

1423
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,725
- Oh, gosh, well, Ricky,
that's what we all dream of.

1424
01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:46,126
- What does Jeff think of this?

1425
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:47,323
- Jeff's fine with it.

1426
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:49,684
Jeff's very busy doing another
screenplay for Fox, so he...

1427
01:01:49,685 --> 01:01:51,959
- What script is Jeff doing for Fox?

1428
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,800
I didn't know that.

1429
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:54,325
- The script for George Clooney.

1430
01:01:54,326 --> 01:01:55,799
- The George Clooney?

1431
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,685
Right, okay, I had no idea about that.

1432
01:01:57,686 --> 01:01:59,804
Another thing I had no idea about.

1433
01:01:59,805 --> 01:02:01,722
- Have you ever done any hosting?

1434
01:02:01,723 --> 01:02:03,688
You know, the awards ceremonies?

1435
01:02:03,689 --> 01:02:05,719
- I hosted the LA BAFTAs once.

1436
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,879
- The what?

1437
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,439
They have LA BAFTAs?

1438
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,766
Who do they give those to?

1439
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:12,479
Listen, never mind, you should
be hosting the Golden Globes.

1440
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,719
This is what I'm talkin' about.

1441
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,559
- It's my script, I wrote
it, well I co-wrote it,

1442
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,445
I'm producing it, I'm gonna star in it,

1443
01:02:19,446 --> 01:02:22,799
not Tim Huddleston or some
other fuckin' posh twat.

1444
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,086
- This should be the best phone call,

1445
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:27,839
this will be the best
phone call you've ever had.

1446
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,762
- Yes.

1447
01:02:28,763 --> 01:02:29,839
- It's my film, okay?

1448
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,680
- Of course it is.

1449
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:31,488
- That's what it's going to be.

1450
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:32,811
Good, thank you.

1451
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:42,839
- That's what you should be in.

1452
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,565
- Stands out like a sore thumb.

1453
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:47,679
That's what Laurie needed
to pay his way around Spain.

1454
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,680
He busked.

1455
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,888
- Thanks.

1456
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,399
- You know that, uh, Cuenca
was one of the last places

1457
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,519
to fall to the Fascists in the Civil War

1458
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,759
on March the 29th, 1939.

1459
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,645
- Terrific position,
it's up on the hilltop,

1460
01:03:16,646 --> 01:03:19,562
so very difficult to attack,
and very easy to defend.

1461
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:21,403
- Yeah, and they may
very well have held out,

1462
01:03:21,404 --> 01:03:24,399
if it weren't for the fact that the army,

1463
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,523
the Republican army,

1464
01:03:25,524 --> 01:03:27,282
turned against the Socialist government.

1465
01:03:27,283 --> 01:03:30,639
If it weren't for that Franco
may have well not have won.

1466
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,640
- Hello.

1467
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,959
- I gave you money before, mate.

1468
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,323
- Oh, yeah, sorry, fellas, take care.

1469
01:03:35,324 --> 01:03:37,207
- You can have a drink with
us, if you want, though.

1470
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:38,165
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1471
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,000
- You sure?

1472
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:39,965
- Yeah, have a beer.

1473
01:03:39,966 --> 01:03:41,325
- I'm with Steve.
- That'd be lovely.

1474
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:42,446
- Cheers, man.
- No worries.

1475
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,247
- You sound very good.

1476
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:46,439
- Thank you, man.

1477
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,930
- Especially like your backing singers.

1478
01:03:47,931 --> 01:03:49,439
- Oh, yeah, hardly Ronettes, right?

1479
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,407
- You know them?

1480
01:03:50,408 --> 01:03:53,006
- Um, yeah, I suppose
near acquaintances, maybe.

1481
01:03:53,007 --> 01:03:54,919
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1482
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,725
- So you guys here on holiday?

1483
01:03:56,726 --> 01:03:57,999
- No, we're working.

1484
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Oh, right?

1485
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,839
- I'm writing a book about my, um,

1486
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,799
sort of travel through Spain.

1487
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,759
Replicating a journey I did when I was,

1488
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,602
when I was a younger man.

1489
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:12,959
It's kind of a little bit
inspired by Laurie Lee,

1490
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,599
you know, When I Walked Out One

1491
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,485
- Midsummer Morning.
- Midsummer Morning.

1492
01:04:15,486 --> 01:04:16,561
- Yeah, I know it.
- But we're driving it.

1493
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:17,599
Cheers.

1494
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,599
- Cheers,
mate, yeah, I love Laurie.

1495
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,443
- That's part of the reason
when I saw you buskin' there,

1496
01:04:21,444 --> 01:04:23,202
I thought this is our Laurie Lee,

1497
01:04:23,203 --> 01:04:24,839
'cause he paid his way through Spain

1498
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,680
by doing the same thing.

1499
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:27,170
- With a violin, yeah.
- Yeah, that's right.

1500
01:04:27,171 --> 01:04:28,559
- Yeah, right on.

1501
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,919
So you guys staying in Cuenca long?

1502
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,760
- One day in every place.

1503
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:33,568
I'm writing restaurant reviews,

1504
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,479
so we go to one town, we're there a clay,

1505
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,322
and then we go on.

1506
01:04:36,323 --> 01:04:38,639
- Oh, have you been in
San Sebastian for food.

1507
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,005
It's the best place in Spain for food

1508
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:41,398
- by a country mile.
- Yeah, I know.

1509
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,684
- We were near there in Santander,

1510
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:43,602
- weren't we?
- Yeah.

1511
01:04:43,603 --> 01:04:45,119
- Or Catalonia, not just Barcelona.

1512
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,199
The food there's excellent, yeah.

1513
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,087
- No.
- Yeah.

1514
01:04:47,088 --> 01:04:48,639
Well, we just

1515
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,085
we were gonna go there, we just thought

1516
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,241
it was a bit too obvious.

1517
01:04:51,242 --> 01:04:53,843
We're trying to do stuff
that's a little bit, kind of,

1518
01:04:53,844 --> 01:04:55,519
the kind of nooks and crannies,

1519
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,931
slightly off the beaten track a little.

1520
01:04:56,932 --> 01:04:58,919
- Like Sanlucar, near Cadiz.

1521
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,886
The tuna there is absolutely
bang-on, I love that.

1522
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:01,722
- Yeah, I know, yeah.

1523
01:05:01,723 --> 01:05:03,721
It's more like the culture than the food,

1524
01:05:03,722 --> 01:05:04,999
although food's part of it,

1525
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,490
but it's more like the
kind of culture, I suppose.

1526
01:05:06,491 --> 01:05:10,399
- But if it's food and culture
that you're lookin' for,

1527
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,479
Valencia.

1528
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,320
- Valencia.

1529
01:05:12,321 --> 01:05:13,160
- Yeah, you probably know it.

1530
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:14,239
- Casa Montana?
- Yeah, yeah.

1531
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,558
- Yeah, that's the best.

1532
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,402
- I know.

1533
01:05:16,403 --> 01:05:17,959
- And Valencia's got the Holy Grail.

1534
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,042
- How long does it take to
get to Valencia from here?

1535
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:22,201
- Valencia's like two hours
away, man, it's close.

1536
01:05:22,202 --> 01:05:23,679
- Let's go to Valencia.

1537
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,601
- Well, no,
we're not going to Valencia.

1538
01:05:25,602 --> 01:05:26,679
- Go to Valencia.
- We've got a whole schedule.

1539
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,520
- No.

1540
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:29,043
- We can go to Valencia,
it's just two hours.

1541
01:05:29,044 --> 01:05:30,279
- We've got a schedule worked out.

1542
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,085
We've got pre-ordained
route taking in some...

1543
01:05:33,086 --> 01:05:34,319
- Where's the fun in that?

1544
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,679
Stray from the path, man.

1545
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,205
- We sort of are straying from the path

1546
01:05:37,206 --> 01:05:39,399
by not going to places
like Catalonia, so...

1547
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,399
- Oh, okay.

1548
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,402
- You can go there for us.

1549
01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:43,559
- I will, again.

1550
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,159
- Okay, again, yeah, all right.

1551
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,650
Listen, I'm gonna head
back to the hotel anyway,

1552
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,199
so, uh, I'm gonna head off.

1553
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,245
- You're goin' back to the hotel?

1554
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:51,082
- Yeah.
- Now?

1555
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,199
- Yeah, yeah.

1556
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,239
You're all right, you'll be
all right here with, uh, man.

1557
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,444
Perhaps he'll play you a few tunes.

1558
01:05:56,445 --> 01:05:58,600
All right, mate, good luck
with your Bo Diddley stuff.

1559
01:05:58,601 --> 01:05:59,522
- Thanks for the beer, man.

1560
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:00,726
- No, no worries, okay.

1561
01:06:00,727 --> 01:06:02,882
- All right, see you later.

1562
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:06,927
- Sorry 'bout that.

1563
01:06:06,928 --> 01:06:08,159
- Touched a nerve, no more.

1564
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,324
He doesn't like to be told
things that he thinks he knows.

1565
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,559
- Hello.

1566
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,769
- Hello, you look delectable and tasty.

1567
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,799
- Like a piece of ham?

1568
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,679
- Oh, all right, then, you look sexy.

1569
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,959
- Don't feel very sexy.

1570
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,610
Had a chat with the builders

1571
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:33,359
and they can't start for another month.

1572
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,359
- Hey, Mischa.

1573
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,679
- Hi, where are you?

1574
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,199
- I had a fan phone call today.

1575
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,726
Do you remember the
agent Steve used to have

1576
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:44,165
in LA called Matt?

1577
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,479
- Sort of, yeah.

1578
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,079
- Look, when you come back, I was thinking

1579
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,559
maybe we could go out to
Rachel's for the weekend.

1580
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,479
- Fantastic,
yeah, I'd love to do that.

1581
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,447
- Nice place.

1582
01:06:55,448 --> 01:06:57,439
- Yeah, but, you know what?

1583
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,564
Yeah, well, we'll definitely do that,

1584
01:06:58,565 --> 01:06:59,641
but why don't you come out earlier?

1585
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:01,999
- He wants me to go with him,

1586
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,319
and be represented by him in LA.

1587
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,205
- Surely there's no
point in that, is there?

1588
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:08,526
- Absolutely right answer.

1589
01:07:08,527 --> 01:07:10,282
Well done, I give you two points for that.

1590
01:07:10,283 --> 01:07:12,044
And that is what I will be telling

1591
01:07:12,045 --> 01:07:15,879
this little American
fellow in me own way, uh...

1592
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,399
- And it's too far away from me.

1593
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,367
- Yeah, of course it is.

1594
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,761
- But isn't Joe supposed to come out?

1595
01:07:20,762 --> 01:07:22,804
- Yeah, but he
can do his own thing.

1596
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,163
You know, he's a big boy.

1597
01:07:24,164 --> 01:07:25,683
- How old is he now?

1598
01:07:25,684 --> 01:07:27,761
- He's 20 years old now.

1599
01:07:27,762 --> 01:07:29,086
- Oh, you better watch out.

1600
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:31,081
I might like him more than I like you.

1601
01:07:31,082 --> 01:07:33,003
- Yeah, you're gross.

1602
01:07:33,004 --> 01:07:35,999
- Look, I gotta go, I'll talk to ya later.

1603
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,650
- Okay, bye-

1604
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,559
- Oh, they're here.

1605
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,560
Hey, you.

1606
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,640
- Hola.

1607
01:08:16,641 --> 01:08:17,480
- Hola.

1608
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:18,322
- How you doin'?
- Hey.

1609
01:08:18,323 --> 01:08:19,763
- Good to see you.
- You too.

1610
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:21,724
- How's it going?
- Thank you, how are you?

1611
01:08:21,725 --> 01:08:22,923
- Great, yeah.

1612
01:08:22,924 --> 01:08:24,159
- Nice to see you.

1613
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,119
- Hey, hi.
- Good to see you again.

1614
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,121
How was your flight?

1615
01:08:27,122 --> 01:08:28,121
- Yeah, it was very good.

1616
01:08:28,122 --> 01:08:29,519
So, photographs.

1617
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,568
- Look, it's just up the hill.
- What about them?

1618
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,211
- Yes, I'm
gonna have them there.

1619
01:08:39,212 --> 01:08:40,247
Yep.

1620
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,999
- These are about two
sizes too big, my shoes.

1621
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,401
- Yeah, well, this is really painful.

1622
01:08:48,402 --> 01:08:51,279
I don't know how anyone
could fight in this stuff.

1623
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,439
- You look-

1624
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,679
- What shoes size did you give them.

1625
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,648
- The size that you sent me over.

1626
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:59,279
- I wear a seven, these
feel like a 10 or an 11.

1627
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,601
- You've only got to
wear them for a minute, so...

1628
01:09:01,602 --> 01:09:02,759
All right, Steve.

1629
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,279
- So, you guys ready?

1630
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:07,405
- We could've got changed,
uh, up here, not down there.

1631
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,121
- I can push you up.

1632
01:09:10,122 --> 01:09:11,531
- One, two, three.

1633
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,839
Okay.

1634
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,760
- I can give you a push.

1635
01:09:14,761 --> 01:09:15,600
- If you need
I can give you a hand.

1636
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:17,250
- No, I don't need any
help, I've done it before.

1637
01:09:17,251 --> 01:09:20,239
One, two, three.

1638
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,999
- Yay, Coogs.

1639
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,399
- It's just about
getting the timing right.

1640
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,400
Okay.

1641
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,164
- There's no saddle.

1642
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,959
Hang on.

1643
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,800
Okay, do it quickly now.

1644
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:32,767
- They lick their own asses.

1645
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:35,479
Uh-oh.

1646
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,845
Take the picture.

1647
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:39,680
- Just take the picture.

1648
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:41,409
Just take the picture.

1649
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,524
What's she doing there,
is she on the internet?

1650
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:45,967
Just take the picture!

1651
01:09:45,968 --> 01:09:48,599
- Yes, I'm coming, Rob.

1652
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,090
- All right, guys.

1653
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,399
- Don Quixote had three trips, I think.

1654
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,084
He had the one that he
went out on his own.

1655
01:10:02,085 --> 01:10:04,763
And he went back, and he
just did Sancho Panza.

1656
01:10:04,764 --> 01:10:07,922
And then he had the sequel, and
this is now your third trip.

1657
01:10:07,923 --> 01:10:09,410
- When Cervantes wrote the sequel,

1658
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:13,039
in the interim, after he'd
written the first part,

1659
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,439
there was a fake sequel published,

1660
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,519
then he incorporated the fake
sequel into his real sequel,

1661
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,079
so he made that part of the story.

1662
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,162
So when he's out, was on his
travels in the second book,

1663
01:10:23,163 --> 01:10:25,843
he bumps into people who'd
read the fake sequel,

1664
01:10:25,844 --> 01:10:28,923
and so he can slag it off
within the pages as Don Quixote.

1665
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:33,759
That is so bold and innovative,
and it's 500 years ago.

1666
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,239
So, effectively he was postmodern,

1667
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,049
before there was any
modern to be post about.

1668
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:39,405
- Amazing.

1669
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,679
- Cervantes, of course, when he was 37,

1670
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,359
he married a 19-year-old.

1671
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,845
- Impressive for a man with one arm.

1672
01:10:51,846 --> 01:10:53,405
- 30 years ago, when I came to Spain,

1673
01:10:53,406 --> 01:10:56,399
I was 18 years old, and I was
pursuing a 37-year-old woman.

1674
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,641
- She was 37, so the reverse.
- The reverse, the reverse.

1675
01:10:58,642 --> 01:11:01,366
- I wasn't doing that kind of
cliche with a younger woman.

1676
01:11:01,367 --> 01:11:04,284
- No, absolutely not.
- She was older than me.

1677
01:11:04,285 --> 01:11:07,799
- Would you now be with
a woman 20 years older?

1678
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,041
- Well, I don't, that's, I
think that that's, that's...

1679
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:11,439
- I'll ask again.

1680
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,679
Would you now be with a woman 20,

1681
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,125
a 70-year-old?
- - Honestly that's academic.

1682
01:11:15,126 --> 01:11:16,639
That's academic.

1683
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,119
- She could be in any
profession, it doesn't matter.

1684
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,484
- He imagined that the inns
were castles, didn't he?

1685
01:11:24,485 --> 01:11:26,003
- In his imagination.
- Indeed.

1686
01:11:26,004 --> 01:11:27,639
- We've been staying in inns.

1687
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,563
- Well, we've been literally
staying in castles.

1688
01:11:29,564 --> 01:11:30,799
- Sorry, we have, yeah.

1689
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,323
We've been staying in
castles, I think they're inns.

1690
01:11:32,324 --> 01:11:33,890
He stayed in inns, but he
thought they were castles,

1691
01:11:33,891 --> 01:11:35,519
so it's, uh, like, uh...

1692
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,204
- The other way around.
- Circle in a spiral.

1693
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:39,361
- Like a wheel within a wheel.
- Yes.

1694
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:42,039
- Never ending or beginning
on an ever-spinning reel.

1695
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:42,882
- Yeah.

1696
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:45,039
- Like the circles that you find

1697
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,399
in the h-windmills of your mind.

1698
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,845
- H-windmills.
- H-windmills.

1699
01:11:49,846 --> 01:11:52,839
- That could be a postmodern manifesto.

1700
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,599
- It really could.
- Or a lovely song

1701
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,600
from the '70s.

1702
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,202
- Spanish Fly, Rob
Brydon, Steve Coogan.

1703
01:12:24,203 --> 01:12:25,599
Wonderful stuff from them.

1704
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,965
Now don't forget come along
with us this morning...

1705
01:12:26,966 --> 01:12:29,042
- Let me just interrupt you there,

1706
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:31,119
Old Kineebles, me old friend.

1707
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,962
- Ah.

1708
01:12:31,963 --> 01:12:34,611
- Because anyone who is anyone will know

1709
01:12:34,612 --> 01:12:37,968
that the title of the song by Herb Albert

1710
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,799
is Spanish Flea, not Spanish Fly.

1711
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,770
- May I be so bold as to
put you up on a wee point,

1712
01:12:44,771 --> 01:12:49,759
that it's not Herb Albert,
it's Herb Alpert, with a P.

1713
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,199
- Ah, yes.
- You've got your Ps

1714
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,247
and your Bs mixed up there.

1715
01:12:52,248 --> 01:12:54,359
- You've got your fleas
and your flies all over.

1716
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,519
- And you've got your
- And I've got me

1717
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,646
- Ps and our Bs.
- Ps and me Bs.

1718
01:12:56,647 --> 01:12:58,759
I threw you a little
bone with a mistake there

1719
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,205
so that you could pick
me up, so we're all,

1720
01:13:00,206 --> 01:13:01,919
so we're all Even Steven.

1721
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,439
- Although we'll probably never know

1722
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,248
if that was the truth, though, will we?

1723
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:06,239
- I mean, that...
- Bs, flies, Ps, Bs.

1724
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,399
- You put a P in the wrong place.

1725
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,811
I had a pee in the wrong place once.

1726
01:13:08,812 --> 01:13:10,844
They won't let me back in
that supermarket again.

1727
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,884
- Yes, and don't forget that you know

1728
01:13:12,885 --> 01:13:14,291
time flies like an arrow,

1729
01:13:14,292 --> 01:13:16,726
but fruit flies like a banana.

1730
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,759
- This is beautiful, very calming.

1731
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,399
- Yeah.
- It's wonderful.

1732
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,242
It's interesting, isn't it?

1733
01:13:41,243 --> 01:13:45,239
We started in the birthplace
of King Ferdinand,

1734
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:49,479
and here we are at the place
where they were buried.

1735
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,322
- Here?

1736
01:13:50,323 --> 01:13:51,999
- Yeah, in the hotel.

1737
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,284
- It wasn't a hotel then, though.

1738
01:13:53,285 --> 01:13:54,725
- No it wasn't then.
- That'd be awful wouldn't it?

1739
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:55,759
Dreadful.

1740
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,250
You have a reservation.

1741
01:13:57,251 --> 01:13:58,519
Uh, Smith.

1742
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,839
- Corpses of.

1743
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,886
- You wait a moment please,
we are about to bury the king.

1744
01:14:01,887 --> 01:14:02,722
Please, what?

1745
01:14:02,723 --> 01:14:04,679
Yes, we have a gymnasium.

1746
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,569
- Why are they buried in Granada then.

1747
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:10,959
- Because this is the last
town to fall to the Catholics.

1748
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,599
That's why they call them
the Catholic king and queen.

1749
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,807
The thing about the Moors is
they were way more tolerant

1750
01:14:16,808 --> 01:14:18,445
than the Catholics that came after them.

1751
01:14:18,446 --> 01:14:20,044
- I'm a big fan of the Moors.

1752
01:14:20,045 --> 01:14:23,931
Oh, Dudley Moore, Christy
Moore, Patrick Moore?

1753
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,039
- No more, please.

1754
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,399
- Roger Moore.
- No.

1755
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,399
- Now when I think back to
the Moors being here in Spain,

1756
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,839
I can honestly say we
had a wonderful time.

1757
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,759
Mother booked a holiday, and we arrived,

1758
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,719
and found the hotel to be to our liking.

1759
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,924
- Of course, what you're
forgetting to point out

1760
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:47,764
is that the Moors, when
they conquered Spain

1761
01:14:47,765 --> 01:14:51,479
in the early 8th century,
were encountering a Europe

1762
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,801
that was still very much in the Dark Ages.

1763
01:14:53,802 --> 01:14:55,759
- It was pitch black.

1764
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,725
- But they of course build
beautiful palaces like this.

1765
01:14:58,726 --> 01:15:00,285
They were very ahead of their time.

1766
01:15:00,286 --> 01:15:03,409
- I have to tell you, when we
were building these palaces,

1767
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:06,959
my fellow Moores, mother,
father, and sister,

1768
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,201
sometimes we would encounter a workman

1769
01:15:09,202 --> 01:15:13,559
who perhaps wasn't working quite
as quickly as I would want.

1770
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,359
Then I would say to him...

1771
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,486
- Move!
- Move!

1772
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,365
- Move!
- Move!

1773
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,086
A lot of them thought
they were hearing cows.

1774
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:26,039
- The thing about doing Roger Moore.

1775
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,848
Yes?

1776
01:15:26,849 --> 01:15:28,799
- Less is more.

1777
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,642
- Ah, you've met my brother Les.

1778
01:15:30,643 --> 01:15:32,242
- If you can let him...
- Les, come in.

1779
01:15:32,243 --> 01:15:34,284
That's right, I'm also a Moore.

1780
01:15:34,285 --> 01:15:36,085
- Les Moore.
- I was trying to hint

1781
01:15:36,086 --> 01:15:39,562
that you should always leave
your audience wanting more.

1782
01:15:39,563 --> 01:15:42,239
- My audience constantly wants more

1783
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,879
and that's what I give them.

1784
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,199
Roger Moore.

1785
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,519
- Moore, quit while you're ahead.

1786
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,409
- They introduced the orange to Spain.

1787
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,359
- The Moors?
- Yeah.

1788
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,759
- Really?
- Yeah.

1789
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,727
- From where?

1790
01:15:55,728 --> 01:15:58,079
- I guess Morocco, that's
where they're originally from.

1791
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,241
- Right.
- I can explain it to you,

1792
01:15:59,242 --> 01:16:00,523
if you like, it was my mother.

1793
01:16:00,524 --> 01:16:02,639
She packed one into her hand luggage.

1794
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,801
- He didn't get the hint, did he?

1795
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:06,079
- No.
- On one of her holidays.

1796
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,081
To which I said, Mother,
what are you doing?

1797
01:16:08,082 --> 01:16:09,161
She said, shush, Roger,

1798
01:16:09,162 --> 01:16:11,639
I'm going to introduce
the orange to Spain.

1799
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,402
- And another thing the Moors introduced

1800
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:15,679
was, of course, our numerical system.

1801
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,569
- That's right, we brought
a calculator with us.

1802
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:19,961
- Because basically we
used to use Roman numerals,

1803
01:16:19,962 --> 01:16:21,286
and it was only when they brought

1804
01:16:21,287 --> 01:16:24,011
the Arabic numerical
system that developed that

1805
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:27,209
into the numerical system we use today.

1806
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,879
- Mother said it would never work.

1807
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,211
- This is really crazy.
- Father said it will.

1808
01:16:33,212 --> 01:16:36,599
- The fact is that the Moors
were far more sophisticated.

1809
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,442
- Yes.
- They knew about medicine,

1810
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:40,759
- philosophy, mathematics.
- Yes, correct.

1811
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,841
- Astronomy.
- We love looking at the stars

1812
01:16:42,842 --> 01:16:45,127
- Very, very, way more advanced than,

1813
01:16:45,128 --> 01:16:47,479
and also managed to marry.

1814
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,444
- My parents did marry,
you're quite right.

1815
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:50,759
They married at a young age,

1816
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,602
they had me and my sister.

1817
01:16:51,603 --> 01:16:53,409
- Rob, Rob, seriously.

1818
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,365
He's got, like, Tourette.

1819
01:16:56,366 --> 01:16:59,842
- The wonderful day my uncle
Bertie gave the sermon,

1820
01:16:59,843 --> 01:17:02,519
he was a preacher, you see.

1821
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,362
- The Greek philosophers were translated

1822
01:17:04,363 --> 01:17:06,679
- into Arabic by the Moors.
- That's right.

1823
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,886
- It was only
- Thank you very much.

1824
01:17:07,887 --> 01:17:09,039
- During the Crusades,

1825
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,644
- when they invaded Toledo...
- It was a pleasure to do it.

1826
01:17:10,645 --> 01:17:12,483
And father, sitting at his desk,

1827
01:17:12,484 --> 01:17:14,639
translating night and clay.

1828
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,958
My mother would say to him,
- So they translated

1829
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:16,961
- Aristotle's
- when are you going to take

1830
01:17:16,962 --> 01:17:18,323
- Roger to the park?
- teachings.

1831
01:17:18,324 --> 01:17:20,923
- Aristotle's teachings
were translated into Arabic

1832
01:17:20,924 --> 01:17:24,239
by the Muslims, and then during
the Crusades the canvas...

1833
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,004
- Why didn't you say they
were clone by the Moors?

1834
01:17:26,005 --> 01:17:27,570
Are you trying to discourage me?

1835
01:17:27,571 --> 01:17:28,799
- What, what?

1836
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,839
- Please, yes.

1837
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,044
- You've stopped saying Moores,

1838
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:32,326
and you've started saying Muslims.

1839
01:17:32,327 --> 01:17:36,759
And I find that a little
racially offensive.

1840
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,039
- Go on, please.

1841
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,201
- You started off referring
to us as the Moores,

1842
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:42,122
now you're referring to us as Muslims.

1843
01:17:42,123 --> 01:17:43,526
- The Moors were Muslims.

1844
01:17:43,527 --> 01:17:45,679
- But why did you start with Moores?

1845
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,486
- It doesn't matter.

1846
01:17:46,487 --> 01:17:47,845
The people that I'm talking
about were one and the same

1847
01:17:47,846 --> 01:17:48,921
Moors with the Muslims.

1848
01:17:48,922 --> 01:17:52,559
- I'm not Roger Muslim, I'm Roger Moore.

1849
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,239
- Dear god.

1850
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,679
Oh, dear.

1851
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,205
Oh, I've got you a ticket the first thing

1852
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:58,606
in the morning to see the Alhambra.

1853
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:00,399
- Oh, brilliant, great, great.

1854
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,561
- Rob, I've got one for you, too.

1855
01:18:01,562 --> 01:18:04,206
- Can I go later, can
I go after breakfast?

1856
01:18:04,207 --> 01:18:05,611
- It'll be busy.

1857
01:18:05,612 --> 01:18:07,959
- Yolanda, you should come with me.

1858
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,039
- I can't, I have to take an
early flight back to London.

1859
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:11,848
- Really?

1860
01:18:11,849 --> 01:18:12,919
That's a shame.

1861
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,199
- Leaving me alone with him?

1862
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,441
- Oh, you won't be alone, I'm
coming with you to Malaga.

1863
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,330
I'm gonna make sure
Joe gets to you safely.

1864
01:18:19,331 --> 01:18:21,322
- Thank the Lord.
- Great.

1865
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,199
- Hello.

1866
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,439
- Hey, hey, Dad.

1867
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,319
- Hey, how you doin'?

1868
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,083
- Um, yeah,
I'm good, how are you?

1869
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:39,481
- Great, really looking
forward to seeing you

1870
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:40,639
<i>'m Maya de Marc.</i>

1871
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,479
I've missed you, buddy.

1872
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,927
- Uh, yeah, that was what I
was calling about actually.

1873
01:18:45,928 --> 01:18:49,039
- Yeah, Emma's, she's
been in touch, right?

1874
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,690
She said she's organized all the flights

1875
01:18:50,691 --> 01:18:52,919
and what have you, so...

1876
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,126
- I can't come.

1877
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,399
- What are you talking about?

1878
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,559
- I just can't come.

1879
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,131
I need to stay here with Helen.

1880
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,040
- What's going on?

1881
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,041
Talk to me.

1882
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,325
- She's pregnant.

1883
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,439
- You're fucking kidding me.

1884
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,839
- She's, she's pregnant.
- You fucking idiot.

1885
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,959
- I need to stay here with her

1886
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,644
so we can figure out
what we're going to do.

1887
01:19:22,645 --> 01:19:25,482
- Wait, wait, are you
certain she's pregnant?

1888
01:19:25,483 --> 01:19:27,005
- Yes, she's definitely pregnant.

1889
01:19:27,006 --> 01:19:29,919
- And are you sure it's yours?

1890
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,039
- Dad.

1891
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,040
- Um.

1892
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,560
Um.

1893
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,561
You're 20 years old, you're
too young to have a kid.

1894
01:19:40,562 --> 01:19:42,688
You know, it's, any decisions you make now

1895
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:47,079
will have ramifications
for the rest of your life.

1896
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,279
- Yes, I know, but I'm not just

1897
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,281
making decisions for me anymore.

1898
01:19:51,282 --> 01:19:52,723
I need to think about her,

1899
01:19:52,724 --> 01:19:54,848
and we need to think
about what we're gonna do.

1900
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,119
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1901
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,919
- Listen, you don't
have to be sorry, okay?

1902
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,559
It's okay, doesn't matter
about comin' out here.

1903
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,399
Just, um, well, whatever
happens, I'm here for you.

1904
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,365
All right?

1905
01:20:11,366 --> 01:20:12,202
- Thanks, Dad.

1906
01:20:12,203 --> 01:20:13,839
- And I love you.

1907
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,319
- Love you, too.

1908
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,049
- Okay, listen, um...

1909
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,919
Don't worry about it, all right?

1910
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,999
- Yeah.

1911
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,844
- I love ya, and I'll
talk to you later, okay?

1912
01:20:28,845 --> 01:20:30,039
- Love you too.

1913
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,600
- Got this.

1914
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,403
- Hey, good morning.

1915
01:21:22,404 --> 01:21:24,209
- Buenos diaz, amigo, Coogan.

1916
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:27,039
- How was the Alhambra.

1917
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,479
- It was, uh, good, it was good,

1918
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,450
but it was, uh, you know, beautiful,

1919
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,479
spiritual, blah, blah, blah.

1920
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,480
- You okay?

1921
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,039
- Joe's not coming out.

1922
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,679
- What, why?

1923
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,639
- Uh, his girlfriend's pregnant.

1924
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,687
- Oh, my god.

1925
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,360
- Bloody hell.

1926
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:49,202
- What's he gonna do?

1927
01:21:49,203 --> 01:21:51,646
- Well, I told him he had options.

1928
01:21:51,647 --> 01:21:53,239
- What does that mean?

1929
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,241
- Well, he's too young to be a clad.

1930
01:21:55,242 --> 01:21:57,049
He's not very worldly, you know.

1931
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:00,719
- You know what this means, don't you?

1932
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,519
♪ Granddad, Granddad

1933
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,602
♪ We love you
- Hadn't thought of that.

1934
01:22:05,603 --> 01:22:09,730
- I'd start to think about it.

1935
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,479
- He's gonna be a granddad.

1936
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,239
- Thank you, Lord.

1937
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,079
- Look at those, ah.

1938
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,443
- See, a lot of
people think they're ugly,

1939
01:22:26,444 --> 01:22:27,362
because they're modern, but I think

1940
01:22:27,363 --> 01:22:30,199
they're beautiful because
they're functional.

1941
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,929
Tilting at Turbines,
that's what I should call

1942
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:34,039
my book about Spain.

1943
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,565
- Good idea.

1944
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,282
Oh, look, Maro.

1945
01:22:41,283 --> 01:22:43,408
Isn't that where you were
gonna take Joe snorkeling.

1946
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:44,919
- Yeah, it was, yeah.

1947
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,810
I brought him here as a
baby when I was filming.

1948
01:22:47,811 --> 01:22:49,399
- How old was he?

1949
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,079
- Ah, about six months.

1950
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:51,922
- Aw.

1951
01:22:51,923 --> 01:22:54,599
- You know, we could still
stop, we've got time.

1952
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,090
- I'll go snorkeling
with you, if you want.

1953
01:22:56,091 --> 01:22:57,359
I could be Joe.

1954
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,601
- You dressed in a nappy,
crawling out on the beach,

1955
01:22:59,602 --> 01:23:03,039
eating sand, only has limited appeal.

1956
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,246
- Well, it wouldn't be for everyone,

1957
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:05,763
I mean, I'm the first to admit.

1958
01:23:05,764 --> 01:23:06,966
- No, it was a long time ago,

1959
01:23:06,967 --> 01:23:10,559
when I was still married to his mom.

1960
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,560
Yeah.

1961
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,849
- Do you know who lives in Malaga?

1962
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,719
- The mayor of Malaga.

1963
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,799
- Yes, correct.
- Thank you.

1964
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,079
- And Sean Connery.

1965
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,239
- Marbella, Mr. Coogan, Marbella,

1966
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,730
your mate, the mister,
he lives in Marbella.

1967
01:23:51,731 --> 01:23:54,451
- Yeah, but he flies into Malaga.

1968
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,479
- By all accounts he's
a very well-respected

1969
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,359
pillar of this society.

1970
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,719
- Yes, he's very active in civic duties.

1971
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,719
- I like to get involved.

1972
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,449
The recycling, for example,

1973
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:13,919
plastics on a Friday,
cardboard on a Saturday.

1974
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,602
- Do you expect me to talk?

1975
01:24:15,603 --> 01:24:17,728
No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.

1976
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:26,839
- When he met Cubby
Broccoli and Harry Saltzman

1977
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,566
to discuss the role,
as he left the meeting,

1978
01:24:29,567 --> 01:24:31,324
they looked out of the window,

1979
01:24:31,325 --> 01:24:35,919
and said he, not yet, and
said, what are you doing?

1980
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,127
- Getting ready to do Sean Connery.

1981
01:24:38,128 --> 01:24:41,279
- You appear to be doing him already.

1982
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,324
As he left the building

1983
01:24:42,325 --> 01:24:44,242
and he walked out across Regent Street

1984
01:24:44,243 --> 01:24:46,806
they looked down and
said, "That man is Bond.

1985
01:24:46,807 --> 01:24:48,359
"He moves like a panther."

1986
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,360
- Like a panther.

1987
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,566
- Yes, but walking like
a panther is not enough

1988
01:24:52,567 --> 01:24:55,119
to bag you the role of James Bond.

1989
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,079
Because of course Bond is
also something of a bulldog.

1990
01:24:59,080 --> 01:24:59,965
So, there was...

1991
01:24:59,966 --> 01:25:02,088
- It was primarily he had to
- He had to be a combination

1992
01:25:02,089 --> 01:25:05,242
- walk like a panther.
- Of a panther and a bulldog.

1993
01:25:05,243 --> 01:25:06,651
Apologies if I've been dragging

1994
01:25:06,652 --> 01:25:10,639
my arse 'round the carpet
because I may have worms.

1995
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,079
- I have a very itchy
anus, I apologize now,

1996
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,366
but it's part and parcel
- Show your bloody itchy anus.

1997
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:16,245
- Of being a panther at the clock.

1998
01:25:16,246 --> 01:25:17,885
- When you introduce me to Blofeld,

1999
01:25:17,886 --> 01:25:20,611
perhaps I should curl
up and lick my balls.

2000
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,121
I think I make quite a
good knight, don't I?

2001
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:30,084
- Yeah.
- You do actually, yeah.

2002
01:25:30,085 --> 01:25:32,763
With the best one in the world
you could never be El Cid.

2003
01:25:32,764 --> 01:25:34,569
You could be a chap called Sid,

2004
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:35,839
just not El Cid.

2005
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,043
- I could be Old Cid.

2006
01:25:37,044 --> 01:25:39,039
- Yeah, Old El Cid.
- You could be Old Cid.

2007
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,201
Look me in the eye and tell me

2008
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:42,085
you think you could play El Cid.

2009
01:25:42,086 --> 01:25:44,081
In a remake, the Charlton Heston role.

2010
01:25:44,082 --> 01:25:45,443
- I mean, you could certainly play

2011
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:46,879
Michael Hordern in El Cid.

2012
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,720
- Who did he play?

2013
01:25:47,721 --> 01:25:48,959
- Someone's clad, I can't remember.

2014
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,039
- Oh.

2015
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,246
You know Michael Hordern, Emma?

2016
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:52,519
- Michael Hordern, yuh.

2017
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,405
- Why is she having him?

2018
01:25:53,406 --> 01:25:54,242
- Michael Hordern would go,

2019
01:25:54,243 --> 01:25:56,559
yuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-um,
Paddington Bear.

2020
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,400
- Yeah, I know.

2021
01:25:57,401 --> 01:25:58,561
- I loved his voice.
- That wasn't Michael Hordern.

2022
01:25:58,562 --> 01:26:00,050
That was Michael Hordern's horse.

2023
01:26:00,051 --> 01:26:01,959
- Michael, hmm, Hordern.

2024
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:02,802
Anyway, hm?

2025
01:26:02,803 --> 01:26:05,039
- Didn't he do No Man's Land with Gielgud.

2026
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,563
You wouldn't know, it
was theater, but he did.

2027
01:26:06,564 --> 01:26:07,402
- Um.
- Did he?

2028
01:26:07,403 --> 01:26:09,289
- You know who's doing it now?

2029
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:12,119
Ian McKellen, you shall not have the ring.

2030
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,679
- Ian McKellen, speaks
like that with a slight,

2031
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,399
however he fancies northern flat vowels.

2032
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,799
- Yes, gracias.

2033
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,839
- Finito.

2034
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,205
- Muchas gracias.

2035
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,679
Thank you.

2036
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,648
- You're missing a bit of
confidence, you see, because Ian...

2037
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:29,004
- Yes, well, no, I think
you're overplaying that

2038
01:26:29,005 --> 01:26:30,159
because, you see...

2039
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:31,650
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, he's acting in the role.

2040
01:26:31,651 --> 01:26:33,083
You don't quite get it.

2041
01:26:33,084 --> 01:26:34,999
- I've spoken to him.
- I can speak.

2042
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,841
- Oh, you do a McKelloff.
- I have actually met him.

2043
01:26:36,842 --> 01:26:38,729
- I have met him many times.
- I've met him many times.

2044
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,484
- How many times?
- Many times.

2045
01:26:40,485 --> 01:26:45,079
Oh, you don't get the
musicality when he throws a line

2046
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,241
up to the gods,
- That was good.

2047
01:26:46,242 --> 01:26:47,526
- And then brings it back down,

2048
01:26:47,527 --> 01:26:49,919
but still with the flat vowels.

2049
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,762
They are very much in evidence,

2050
01:26:51,763 --> 01:26:53,724
however much he may try to be,

2051
01:26:53,725 --> 01:26:56,121
pursue pronunciation with the vowels.

2052
01:26:56,122 --> 01:26:57,804
- Oh, you do make me laugh, you really,

2053
01:26:57,805 --> 01:26:59,319
you do make me laugh.

2054
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,399
Oh, we need a laugh, don't we?

2055
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,839
Oh, you do make me laugh, Rob, you do.

2056
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,763
- That's what he said to me.
- He do that more in private?

2057
01:27:05,764 --> 01:27:07,125
- Because when he met me, he said,

2058
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:09,079
"You're a very good actor."

2059
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,599
- Ah.
- Ooh, yum.

2060
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,879
- Enjoy.-

2061
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,039
- You asked for this.
- I did ask for this.

2062
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,039
Do you want to come back with me?

2063
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,121
I can get you on the same flight.

2064
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:27,639
- No, I'll stay, thank you,

2065
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,130
and I'm gonna write
more and finish my book.

2066
01:27:29,131 --> 01:27:33,011
- I think the word you're
looking for is start.

2067
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,079
Thinkin' about Joe.

2068
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,799
20 is a young age to have a child.

2069
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,402
- How old were you when you had your kids?

2070
01:27:41,403 --> 01:27:42,403
- 43.

2071
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,042
- Bit of a difference.

2072
01:27:44,043 --> 01:27:45,199
- Yes.

2073
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,085
I didn't drink 'til I was 35,

2074
01:27:47,086 --> 01:27:48,603
and the first child at 43.

2075
01:27:48,604 --> 01:27:49,761
Are the two related?

2076
01:27:49,762 --> 01:27:50,804
We'll never know.

2077
01:27:50,805 --> 01:27:53,326
- How old, what's her
name, the girlfriend?

2078
01:27:53,327 --> 01:27:54,719
- Helen, she's 19.

2079
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:56,561
- 19?
- Gosh.

2080
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,290
- Only 19 years old.

2081
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,839
- She was only 19 years old!

2082
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,490
- I don't mean any
disrespect, Steve, but...

2083
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:08,879
- She was only 19, she was only,

2084
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:09,800
you've got to get the voice better.

2085
01:28:09,801 --> 01:28:11,928
- Well, you've got me most in
your voice when you say it.

2086
01:28:11,929 --> 01:28:13,445
- She was only.
- Now he has.

2087
01:28:13,446 --> 01:28:15,039
- She was 19 years old.

2088
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,959
- Joe has met a young lady.

2089
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,247
- She was only 19 years old.

2090
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,119
- When Joe and Helen had a child

2091
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,399
she was only 19 years old.

2092
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,519
- She was only, it's
actually 16 in the film.

2093
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,799
- I know that, but Helen
was only 19 years old.

2094
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,525
And she had the child with Joe.

2095
01:28:35,526 --> 01:28:37,887
She had a grandfather who was so talented,

2096
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,799
who was so gifted.

2097
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,722
- He was only.

2098
01:28:40,723 --> 01:28:42,961
- The grandfather was only 50 years old.

2099
01:28:42,962 --> 01:28:44,919
- 50 years old.

2100
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,002
Hey, do you know who was born in Malaga?

2101
01:28:47,003 --> 01:28:48,479
- No.
- Picasso.

2102
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,959
- Who?
- Picasso.

2103
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:50,802
- Is that true?

2104
01:28:50,803 --> 01:28:53,243
- Yeah, they're openin' a museum to him.

2105
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:55,359
- Who played Picasso
in a very popular film

2106
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,325
- in the last 10 years?
- Oh, god.

2107
01:28:56,326 --> 01:28:57,160
- Who was it?

2108
01:28:57,161 --> 01:28:58,002
No, ask Emma.

2109
01:28:58,003 --> 01:28:59,799
- Who played Picasso?

2110
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,801
Guess, it's one of Rob's five impressions.

2111
01:29:01,802 --> 01:29:03,562
That should narrow it down.

2112
01:29:03,563 --> 01:29:05,279
- It wasn't Tom Jones.
- Antonio?

2113
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,598
- No, not allowed.
- It wasn't Tom Jones.

2114
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,440
Okay, we're gettin' closer.

2115
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:09,010
- We're gettin' warmer.
- Spanish, Spanish.

2116
01:29:09,012 --> 01:29:09,967
- I don't know.
- Tony Hopkins.

2117
01:29:09,968 --> 01:29:11,759
Tony Hopkins played in Surviving...

2118
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,759
- Did he?

2119
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:15,885
- Surviving Picasso, I played
the painter, wonderful man.

2120
01:29:15,886 --> 01:29:17,084
I don't like to talk about it.

2121
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:17,922
I like to draw.

2122
01:29:17,923 --> 01:29:20,119
I like to put the eyes
here, the nose there,

2123
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,087
- the mouth up there.
- He played Picasso

2124
01:29:21,088 --> 01:29:22,399
as a Welshman?

2125
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,079
- Well, he didn't do a
Spanish accent, Steve.

2126
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:25,920
- Did he not?

2127
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:27,729
- He doesn't have your
versatility, let's be honest.

2128
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:30,799
- He learned to paint, and
he painted the paintings

2129
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,608
in a fiddlety way.

2130
01:29:31,609 --> 01:29:34,166
He knew how to instill life,
and he knew how to, uh,

2131
01:29:34,167 --> 01:29:35,965
you know, paint, uh, the way these as...

2132
01:29:35,966 --> 01:29:37,004
- Uh, Pablo, Pablo.

2133
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:39,321
Some of the men are saying
that you're painting

2134
01:29:39,322 --> 01:29:40,523
in a very strange way.

2135
01:29:40,524 --> 01:29:42,999
They're saying that the nose
is where the eyes should be.

2136
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,759
Some of them are saying you're a Cubist.

2137
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,602
- Oh, Pablo?

2138
01:29:45,603 --> 01:29:47,999
Is it not captain or sir, hm, eh?

2139
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,840
- There are rumblings, Pablo.

2140
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:50,444
- Oh, they want me to put the
nose in the front of the face.

2141
01:29:50,445 --> 01:29:51,959
In the middle, like that, that it?

2142
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,722
And the eyes next to the
nose, is that what you want?

2143
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:54,846
- Yes, sir.
- Well, tell the men,

2144
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:57,283
when we put the nose by the cheekies,

2145
01:29:57,284 --> 01:29:58,599
and we put the eyes up here,

2146
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,724
and the mouth 'round the corner,

2147
01:29:59,725 --> 01:30:01,210
I was asail 'round the Cape of Good Hope,

2148
01:30:01,212 --> 01:30:02,042
goddam your eyes, sir.

2149
01:30:02,043 --> 01:30:03,519
- I put the eyes where I want to,

2150
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,644
and the nose where I want to.

2151
01:30:04,645 --> 01:30:05,721
If you turn your back on me,

2152
01:30:05,722 --> 01:30:07,365
I shall put two eyes on your back,

2153
01:30:07,366 --> 01:30:08,879
and a nose down by your ass.

2154
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:09,686
Do you want that, sir?

2155
01:30:09,687 --> 01:30:10,520
Is that what you want, sir?

2156
01:30:10,521 --> 01:30:11,601
Don't turn your back on me.

2157
01:30:11,602 --> 01:30:14,039
I will draw you like a
Cubist, that's what I'll do.

2158
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,962
If you turn your back on me,

2159
01:30:14,963 --> 01:30:16,802
I'll put a nose on your bottom, sir.

2160
01:30:16,803 --> 01:30:18,126
'Round the Horn is a good way,

2161
01:30:18,127 --> 01:30:19,279
'round the Horn we shall go.

2162
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,964
- The most interesting
thing about Picasso is,

2163
01:30:20,965 --> 01:30:23,201
why I love him, his early paintings

2164
01:30:23,202 --> 01:30:26,519
are very orthodox, very accessible.

2165
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,727
He knew how to do all that,
but he said that's not enough.

2166
01:30:28,728 --> 01:30:30,684
I want to rewrite the rule book,

2167
01:30:30,685 --> 01:30:32,405
and be radical and Avant Garde.

2168
01:30:32,406 --> 01:30:34,641
- Are you a bit like Picasso, Steve?

2169
01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:36,563
- Well, I empathize with what he did.

2170
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,559
- Yes, he is, he is, he is.

2171
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,879
He's gonna say it.

2172
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:40,688
- What I'm saying is...

2173
01:30:40,689 --> 01:30:44,401
- Let me record
this, hang on, hang on.

2174
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,842
- I've got a reservations, Steve Coogan.

2175
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,639
- This castle is Gibralfaro,

2176
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,041
named after the same man as Gibraltar.

2177
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:08,601
When the Moors came in 711,
they were only a few thousand.

2178
01:31:08,602 --> 01:31:10,728
Within a couple of years they controlled

2179
01:31:10,729 --> 01:31:13,079
almost all of Spain.

2180
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,682
- Wow.
- That's exactly the same

2181
01:31:14,683 --> 01:31:16,839
as ISIS and the modern caliphate,

2182
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,365
because there's only a
few thousand of them,

2183
01:31:18,366 --> 01:31:21,245
and yet they control half
of Syria and half of Iraq.

2184
01:31:21,246 --> 01:31:23,082
They're trying to emulate
what the Moors did

2185
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:26,239
when they had control everywhere
from Cordoba to Baghdad.

2186
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,205
- Well, ISIS aren't tolerant.

2187
01:31:27,206 --> 01:31:28,326
They're not doing it with tolerance and...

2188
01:31:28,327 --> 01:31:30,879
- No, they're not, but Islam, uh, is...

2189
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,961
- Can we stop talking about ISIS?

2190
01:31:32,962 --> 01:31:35,361
- Cervantes was captured
by Barbary pirates

2191
01:31:35,362 --> 01:31:37,159
and taken to Algiers.

2192
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,683
There was a price on his head,
and when the ransom was paid,

2193
01:31:39,684 --> 01:31:41,759
he let his brother go instead of him.

2194
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,805
- Very noble.
- Is that true?

2195
01:31:42,806 --> 01:31:43,640
- That is true.

2196
01:31:43,641 --> 01:31:44,562
- He let his brother go,

2197
01:31:44,563 --> 01:31:46,210
- when he could have gone.
- Yeah.

2198
01:31:46,211 --> 01:31:48,039
- Wow.
- I know.

2199
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:48,880
- Not sure I'd do that.

2200
01:31:48,881 --> 01:31:50,291
Would you do that, let your brother go?

2201
01:31:50,292 --> 01:31:52,599
- Uh, probably not.

2202
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,761
- No, I don't think I would either,

2203
01:31:53,762 --> 01:31:55,879
with the best one in the world.

2204
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:56,722
- No.

2205
01:31:56,723 --> 01:31:58,764
If my child we there,
they could take my child.

2206
01:31:58,765 --> 01:31:59,999
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

2207
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,490
- I'd let any child go.

2208
01:32:01,491 --> 01:32:02,999
- Any child?

2209
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,125
- Any child, as long as it, you
know, I mean, not any child.

2210
01:32:06,126 --> 01:32:08,441
I mean, it has to be worth the effort.

2211
01:32:08,442 --> 01:32:11,799
- Cervantes, when he tried
to escape, he's captured,

2212
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,961
he had a noose around his neck.

2213
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:15,122
He was talking to Hassan,
the leader of Algiers,

2214
01:32:15,123 --> 01:32:18,879
and he became his lover to
literally save his neck.

2215
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,199
- Bum or neck?
- Yeah.

2216
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,563
- If that's what it comes down to, yes.

2217
01:32:21,564 --> 01:32:22,402
- Life or bum.

2218
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:25,439
- Well, either way your buggered.

2219
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,799
- Let me say now, I'm in.

2220
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,439
- Really?
- He's in, rather, he's in.

2221
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:33,284
- Ah, but they became lovers,
so it would be in-out-in-out.

2222
01:32:33,285 --> 01:32:34,719
- You see that ferry?

2223
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:35,839
- Yeah.

2224
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,161
- That's the ferry for Africa.

2225
01:32:38,162 --> 01:32:39,559
- Really?
- Mm.

2226
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,481
It's always good to say
goodbye in the mist.

2227
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,807
Like, uh, end of Casablanca.

2228
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,639
- Could be the start of
a beautiful friendship.

2229
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,242
- Be the start of a beautiful friendship.

2230
01:32:57,243 --> 01:32:58,080
- Could be the start

2231
01:32:58,081 --> 01:32:59,002
- of a beautiful friendship.
- You gotta get the depth.

2232
01:32:59,003 --> 01:33:01,446
- I got the depth right there.

2233
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,884
- Look at that mystical city.

2234
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,730
- Right, I'm gonna make a move.

2235
01:33:10,731 --> 01:33:12,085
Um, early flight.

2236
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,759
- Yeah, me too, actually.

2237
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,727
- <i>Oh, mm.</i>

2238
01:33:16,728 --> 01:33:18,006
- Mm, Oh.

2239
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:20,845
- We say our goodbyes now.

2240
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:21,879
- Okay, okay-

2241
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:22,961
- Yeah, sure
you're gonna be all right?

2242
01:33:22,962 --> 01:33:26,599
- Yeah, no, so, uh, I'm really
looking forward to this week.

2243
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,485
Writing, and...

2244
01:33:27,486 --> 01:33:28,322
- All right, good.

2245
01:33:28,323 --> 01:33:30,039
- Buona via, you know.

2246
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,319
Hey, what can we say?

2247
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,959
- It's been a week.

2248
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:37,039
- It has.
- And I'll see you...

2249
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,199
- In another country.

2250
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,040
- In the future.

2251
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:40,880
- In the future.

2252
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:41,722
- Have fun now.

2253
01:33:41,723 --> 01:33:42,759
- Yeah, okay.

2254
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:43,760
- Bye.

2255
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,919
- And we disappear into the mist.

2256
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:52,279
Could be the start of
a beautiful friendship.

2257
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:48,966
- Buenos diaz.

2258
01:34:48,967 --> 01:34:49,845
- Hi.

2259
01:34:49,846 --> 01:34:50,682
- Oh, you're English.

2260
01:34:50,683 --> 01:34:53,645
- Yeah, my name is Ambrose,
I'm the son of the owners here.

2261
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:54,999
- Oh, right, great, great.

2262
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,001
- Can I help you with your bags?

2263
01:34:56,002 --> 01:34:58,207
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

2264
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,319
- So this will be your room.

2265
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:05,559
- Wow this is great, yeah, very cozy.

2266
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:09,084
- Now, we thought there were
going to be two of you, but...

2267
01:35:09,085 --> 01:35:12,084
- Yeah, my son was gonna
come, but he couldn't make it.

2268
01:35:12,085 --> 01:35:13,959
- Oh, I see.

2269
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,199
I'll leave you now.

2270
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,042
- Okay.

2271
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:17,319
How old are you, by the way.

2272
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,287
- 17.

2273
01:35:18,288 --> 01:35:22,444
- Oh, okay,
thank you, thanks, Ambrose.

2274
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,050
- Guess who it is!

2275
01:35:35,051 --> 01:35:36,839
- Hey.

2276
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,239
How's it been?

2277
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,239
- It was good.

2278
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,080
- Yeah?

2279
01:35:41,081 --> 01:35:41,922
- Where's the team, where ya at?

2280
01:35:41,923 --> 01:35:43,399
- We're all here.

2281
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,206
- Where are you?

2282
01:35:44,207 --> 01:35:45,042
- Hey.
- Good to see you.

2283
01:35:45,043 --> 01:35:47,039
- Oh, we missed you.
- Come on.

2284
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,040
Daddy!

2285
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:53,922
- How's my girl?
- Good.

2286
01:35:53,923 --> 01:35:55,639
- You're good?
- Good.

2287
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:57,119
- Who's your favorite parent?

2288
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,042
- You.
- Yay!

2289
01:35:58,043 --> 01:35:59,166

2290
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,359

2292
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,839
- I'm good.

2293
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,279
- Where are you?

2294
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:12,319
- I'm in, uh, Andalusia, in the mountains.

2295
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,879
It's great.

2296
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,599
- Is Joe there?

2297
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,239
- No, he's not, no.

2298
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,599
Look, you should come out here.

2299
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,600
- I can't.

2300
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,399
- Why not, what is it, work?

2301
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,606
- I just can't.

2302
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,046
Why, Why not?

2303
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:30,800
- I'm pregnant.

2304
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
- What?

2305
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:36,724
- Yeah, I know, it's stupid.

2306
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,481
- Is it mine?

2307
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,600
- No.

2308
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,559
- Is it Adam's?

2309
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:51,679
- Yeah.

2310
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,039
- Are you sure?

2311
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,999
- Pretty sure.

2312
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,205
- I thought you weren't
sleeping with him anymore.

2313
01:36:59,206 --> 01:37:02,602
- Look I gotta go, he's
waiting for me downstairs.

2314
01:37:02,603 --> 01:37:06,319
- Wait, what, he's back in New York?

2315
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,159
- Yeah, look, I gotta go.

2316
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,160
I'm sorry.

2317
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:11,880
Take care.

- Quickly, and then we can get
back to what we were doing.

2339
01:38:26,164 --> 01:38:28,683

gone, you can forget that.

2340
01:38:28,684 --> 01:38:30,442

2341
01:38:30,443 --> 01:38:33,245

there, did you drop him?

Have you dropped him, eh?
