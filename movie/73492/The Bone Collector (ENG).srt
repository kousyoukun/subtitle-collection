1
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,190
Paulie, how's it look?
Snitch says the cop's body's...

2
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,760
about 300 yards down
in an abandoned tunnel.

3
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,029
Howie?
Right behind you, Captain.

4
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,698
Keep back till I process
the scene, okay?

5
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,176
Watch out!

6
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,352
So where the hell
is the car?
I don't know.

7
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,456
That's the last time I'm going
to take a goddamn red-eye.
Maybe we can take a cab.

8
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,325
I'm gonna fire
this son of a bitch.

9
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,327
He's always got
an excuse.

10
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,569
Come on. We'll be home
before you knowit.

11
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,604
Yeah, okay.

12
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:20,848
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I think you're going
the wrong way.

13
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,351
Excuse me.

14
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,386
Honey?
Honey, wake up.

15
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,223
We're lost, or he's
taking us for a ride.

16
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,291
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

17
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,228
Hey, where the hell
are you going?
I said Fifth Avenue.

18
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,200
Hey! We're not
tourists here, man!

19
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,603
Hey! Where are you going?

20
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,246
Let us out. Stop the car.

21
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,383
Stop this car, man!
Can't...

22
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,562
Ah! Shit!

23
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,065
Oh, my God.
Son of a bitch!

24
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,535
Stop the goddamn car!

25
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,305
Hey!

26
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,612
Please!
Stop the car!

27
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:30,417
- Let us out!
- Stop the car, goddamn it!
Stop this car!

28
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,889
Goodmorning.

29
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:40,494
You're looking
a little dehydrated.
How about some juice?

30
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,606
Juice.
Vodka.

31
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,408
Juice.

32
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,677
Coming!
Join me in a drink, Richard?

33
00:07:56,777 --> 00:08:00,447
I'd love to, but a med-tech
with liquor on his breath?
I think not.

34
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,283
Thanks.
So how are you?

35
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,119
Well, I'm better than
your heart-pacing gear.

36
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,925
You reallyneed
a newunit.
I really need a new body.

37
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,696
I'm afraid I can't help you
with that, but I'll bring
your new unit by tomorrow.

38
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,799
- Okay.
- This one'll be stable
till then.

39
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,834
Thank you, Richard.
You take it easy.

40
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,671
I'll take it any way
I can get it.

41
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,480
Goodmorning, Doctor.
Hi, Richard.

42
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,816
Hey, would you
look at this?

43
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,352
A... peregrine falcon.
Am I right?

44
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:42,222
Yep. He likes cripples.

45
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:45,359
There was a piece about them...

46
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,395
in the Times the other day
nesting all over the city.

47
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:52,533
Something to do with
the architecture of all
these old New York buildings.

48
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,568
I thought he liked
my company.

49
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,049
Bed mode.

50
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,493
Got vodka in there?
No.

51
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,995
And you ain't gettin'any,
either.

52
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,364
Allright.
I'll let you guys talk.

53
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,536
So, Linc,

54
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,707
you can imagine how much sleep
I've gotten the past few days,
considering your request.

55
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:37,911
That's funny. Since I made
my decision, I've been
sleeping like a baby.

56
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,918
You know as well
as I do there's work
on nerve regeneration every day.

57
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,222
One... finger,
two shoulders and a brain.

58
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,858
That's all I have, Barry.

59
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,961
These dysreflexia seizures
are occurring more frequently.

60
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:58,232
Buildup of fluidin myspine
is a degenerative condition.

61
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,567
We both know I'm
waiting for the...

62
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,371
seizure that's gonna
make me a vegetable.

63
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:09,209
I don't want
to be a vegetable, Barry.

64
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,779
I want to make the final
transition on my own terms.

65
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:18,952
I'll get it done
with or without you.

66
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,656
Oh, yeah? Yeah,
I suppose you would.

67
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,563
So?

68
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,836
Okay.
Okay, what?

69
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,242
Okay, I'll assist you...

70
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,478
in your final transition.

71
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,714
What about today?
There are preparations
that have to be made.

72
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,652
- This is not a flushot.
- My business is in order.
My bags are packed.

73
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:56,223
Besides, I've... I've got
a medical conference to go to.
I've got a plane to catch.

74
00:10:56,356 --> 00:11:00,294
You're lying.
When do you get back?

75
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:06,700
- Sunday.
- Okay. Sunday.

76
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,841
- I'll see you then.
- Get the hell out
before you change your mind.

77
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,679
Don't bother to get up.
I'll show myselfout.

78
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,181
Yeah, I'll race you to the door.

79
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,183
Barry.

80
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,955
You are...

81
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,957
a very good friend.

82
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,009
Amelia?

83
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,812
Hey.

84
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,848
Hey. Morning.

85
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,785
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

86
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,787
I just couldn't sleep.

87
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,060
What time is it?
It's early.

88
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:51,271
I'm gonna be late for work.
I gotta shower.

89
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,307
Come on. No, you don't.
Stay here.

90
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,475
l... I gotta go.

91
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:12,025
Hey, I'll make breakfast?
No, thanks.
I'm gonna be late.

92
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,328
Another
slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am?

93
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,067
All right, look.

94
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,569
My therapist tells me...

95
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,139
I might not be
getting what I need
out of this relationship.

96
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:30,677
Come on. What are we
doing here? I think
you and me make a great couple.

97
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,149
You know where I stand on this.
You know what I want.

98
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,353
Steve, we've been through this.

99
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,889
I care about you.

100
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,957
You know that.
I can't make a commitment.

101
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,836
Go to work, then.

102
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:59,006
You're gonna be late.

103
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,520
So, Amelia, it's true
you're quitting the cops?

104
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,522
No, I'm transferring
to Youth Services.

105
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:18,225
You lucky fuck. You must have
one hell of a rabbi downtown.

106
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,128
We're gonna miss you
in this neighborhood.
3-post-11, here.

107
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,565
Be advised
frightened child at Amtrak site.
I'm a block away. I'll take it.

108
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,100
Some kid found something
over at the tracks.

109
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,102
Finish eating.
I'll check it out.

110
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,271
See you, kid.
All right.

111
00:14:57,164 --> 00:15:00,000
3-post-11, anything further
on that 10-10?

112
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,536
Nothing yet.

113
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:08,609
Wait. I think I see him.
Are you the one
who called the police?

114
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,921
Wait there, okay?

115
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,323
- Are you outta your mind?
- Just shut off the engine,
all right?

116
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,425
There's been a homicide.
I can't let you through.

117
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,208
My name's Amelia.
What's your name?
Chris.

118
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:26,046
Chris, hey.
I got a job foryou.
Here's some money.

119
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,950
I need you to buy me one of
those cheapo cardboard cameras.

120
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,219
The ones you can throw away?
Yeah.

121
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,087
Okay.
Fast as you can.

122
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,429
3-post-11 to Central.

123
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,309
Send a bus. Get those
passengers out of here.

124
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:38,378
I saw a hand
sticking out...
Captain Cheney.

125
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:42,182
Detective Solomon.
First officer on the scene
is over there.

126
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:46,053
I found some strange stuff
on the tracks near the body.

127
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,488
I collected it
before it was washed away.

128
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,161
I also took some pictures.
Thanks.

129
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,563
You're the one
that stopped the train?

130
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:59,266
Yes, sir. I thought
it might have disturbed
the physical evidence.

131
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,369
Why not shut down Grand Central
while you're at it, hmm?

132
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:04,771
Patrolman Donahue?
Is that right?

133
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:08,175
Donaghy.
A rookie, I take it.

134
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,245
No, sir.
Pretty dumb.

135
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,380
Captain?
Yeah?

136
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:15,883
- Guess who the vic
turns out to be.
- Talk to me.

137
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:20,220
- Alan fucking Rubin.
- Mr. Rebuild New York himself?

138
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,222
Great.

139
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,325
I don't want
anybody entering this area
except for my crime scene guys.

140
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,761
Okay?

141
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:35,435
Ah.

142
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:39,039
Knight to H-6. Check.

143
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,912
You got company.
Cops.
Tell them I'm busy.

144
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:48,448
They said it was urgent.
Tell them I'm out running.

145
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,285
She's too polite for that,
Linc.

146
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:54,254
Hey! Lookee who's here.

147
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:58,659
I, uh... I caught
a serious situation, Linc.

148
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,727
Yeah, well, that's
going around, Paulie.

149
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:02,863
Chief Murphy sent me.

150
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,432
Ah. Good chief.

151
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,902
- Have you heard about
that couple at the airport...

152
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:11,405
got in a taxi
yesterday morning?

153
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:14,241
Never made it home?
He don't watch
the news anymore.

154
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:17,077
You used to
read four papers a day,
tape all the news shows.

155
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,246
Now I just hit
the rewind button. A-3.

156
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,648
Things never
change, Paulie.

157
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,718
Yeah, well, that was Alan Rubin
and his wife in that taxi.

158
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:28,188
Found him dead, buried,
shot in the face.

159
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,624
Hand sticking out of the ground
with his wife's weddingband...

160
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:34,127
shoved on one of his fingers
which was skinned to the bone.

161
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:38,131
- She's still missing.
- Excuse me while you guys
catch up, okay?

162
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:43,670
Don't go too far, Thelma.
We'll be letting these nice
gentlemen out in 30 seconds.

163
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,874
Sounds like you got yourself
an open-and-shut there, Paulie.

164
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,910
- I don't think so.
- A man worth several
hundred million dollars...

165
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,314
found dead with
his wife's wedding band
on his mutilated hand.

166
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,750
What's that tell you?

167
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,386
The doer is saying
he's got her.

168
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,556
He's probably contacting
the family right now,
making a ransom demand.

169
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:06,026
I'd have been paged
if he had.
Check your batteries.

170
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,462
It's defiinitely a ransom.

171
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:13,000
Excuse me.
Mr. Rhyme,
Kenneth Solomon.

172
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:15,869
I've read all your books.
Scene of the Crime...

173
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:18,872
at least a dozen times.

174
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:21,441
It's great to actually meet you.

175
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:23,477
Where do you find
these guys, Paulie?

176
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:25,879
They wanna work
with the best.

177
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,849
I guess now you're gonna
ask me to...

178
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:30,851
discuss the crime scene
with you, huh?

179
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:35,956
As a matter of fact, we've got
a bunch of physical evidence
that doesn't make sense.

180
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,992
Some seriously weird stuff.
It's all in the report.

181
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:42,129
Thelma?

182
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,798
- Linc, you okay?

183
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:48,035
Hey, Linc, you okay?
Out, now!

184
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:51,338
Anything we can do?
Asses out of here now!

185
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:54,641
Let me get you some air.
Breathe for me, Linc.

186
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,811
- I said out!

187
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:01,882
Come on. Deep breaths.
Deep breaths. Come on.

188
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:04,418
Deep breaths.
I'm getting a B.P. on you.

189
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:08,856
Come on, Rhyme.
You gotta breathe.
Look at me. Breathe.

190
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:15,362
Look at me. Deep breaths.
Come on, come on.

191
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:19,132
You gotta take this oxygen.
Come on, Rhyme.
Stay with me.

192
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,902
Come on. You can do it.
Don't go out on me, now.

193
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:24,104
Don't go out.
Come on. Look at me.

194
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,770
Thelma?
You okay?

195
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,308
I would be okay if
your powers of resuscitation
were a little less adept.

196
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:04,778
Not on my shift,
all right?

197
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:07,447
If you have
a problem with that,
you can just fire my ass.

198
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:10,984
You know I provide generously
for you in my will.
Keep that in mind.

199
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:16,023
Rhyme, I am not interested
in having this conversation.
Okay?

200
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:20,160
Okay. Crime scene report
Sellitto left.

201
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:23,730
Would you take those photos,
load them into the viewer
for me?

202
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:26,266
View scan.

203
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:34,107
Okay. Let's look
at what we got here.

204
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:39,346
Where it says "location..."
What's that...

205
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:41,949
What's it say
about that newspaper?

206
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:47,254
"Newspaper found beneath
a coarse-thread hex-bolt with
'4:00 p.m.' circled on it."

207
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:50,424
"4:00 p.m." Zoom.

208
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,428
Zoom. Zoom.

209
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:58,799
What about the, uh,
that little piece of paper?
What's the numberon there?

210
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:01,435
A torn book page
with 119 on it.

211
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:04,771
119, 4:00 p.m.

212
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:07,975
119, 4:00p.m.
119, 4:00p.m.

213
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:10,644
One... One...

214
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:12,679
Eleven, nine.
What's today's date?

215
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,015
Today's November 9.

216
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:19,152
Phone mode.
Sellitto, Paulie. Call.

217
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,826
What?

218
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:31,098
Sad fact is a huge percentage
of inner-city kids...

219
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:36,436
are having their
first drug experiences
at the fifth-grade level.

220
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,572
Now.

221
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:41,675
Here are some of the drugs
they'll most likely be offered.

222
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:46,213
Marijuana.

223
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:49,816
How'd you like
to get your hands
on that briefcase?

224
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,153
Barbiturates.
Amphetamines.

225
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:56,657
Cocaine.

226
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,358
Rock cocaine.

227
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:11,138
You wanna tell me
what this is about?
You know who Lincoln Rhyme is?

228
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,640
Textbook guy?
Yeah.

229
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,211
What does that
have to do with me?
We'll find out.

230
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:22,783
Hey. Come on in.
They're right in there.

231
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,522
And you're saying a
patrolcop took these pictures?

232
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:32,793
Yeah, first one on the scene.
It started to rain.
Smart cop.

233
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:36,430
Not only that, but had the
balls to stop an Amtrak from
running over the crimescene.

234
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:38,966
Here she is now.
Officer "Donahoe."

235
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:41,869
Meet Lincoln Rhyme.
Donaghy.

236
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:50,177
Took some terrifiic photographs,
Offiicer.

237
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,047
You know who I am?
I read your manual
at the academy.

238
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:58,085
What'd you think of it?
I'm not a book critic, sir.

239
00:26:58,218 --> 00:27:00,153
But you found it useful.

240
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:03,056
Yeah, I guess so.
"Guess so."
Sure you did.

241
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:07,961
I mean, you stopped that train.
Photos you took.

242
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,898
I'd say you have a natural
instinct for forensics.

243
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:14,835
So what do we got, Paulie?

244
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:18,438
We have footprints, size ten,
thanks to Officer Donaghy...

245
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:21,074
using a dollarbill
to establish scale.

246
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:24,178
We have asbestos on a track bed
where there shouldn't be any.

247
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:27,681
An iron bolt holding down
a, uh, piece of paper.

248
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,884
A book page with 119
written on it.

249
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:34,021
Decaying oxidation
on the bolt's head
but not on the thread,

250
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:37,758
which says to me
thatsomeone removed it
from somewhere else...

251
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,793
and placed it there recently.

252
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:43,597
Wouldn't you agree, Officer?
Wouldn't you agree,
Officer Donaghy?

253
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:51,205
Paulie, I'm convinced that
this crime scene was staged.

254
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:54,107
Perp's trying
to tell us something.
What the fuck are you saying?

255
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:57,244
Book page 119. 11, 9.
That's today's date.

256
00:27:57,377 --> 00:28:00,914
Newspaper, 4:00 p.m.
What time you got?
12:15.

257
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,684
She's alive, Paulie.

258
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:07,254
And he's gonna
kill her at 4.00.
P.M.

259
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,493
We have your interest yet,
Officer?

260
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:16,196
I want you
to work the case with us.

261
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,166
Uh, it's not my area.

262
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:22,436
Are you being modest
or are you...

263
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,038
a little uneasy about doing
some real police work?

264
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,043
Excuse me?
What department
you work in, Officer?

265
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:33,180
Youth Services Division.
I picked her up
at orientation.

266
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:35,215
Ah, I see.
Youth Services.

267
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:38,385
I've wait-listed over a year
to get that transfer,
and I am not gonna jeopardize...

268
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,856
Jeopardize what?
Cushy deskjob?

269
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:46,159
Forensics is not my area.
I disagree with you.

270
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,228
You can't force me
to take this assignment.

271
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:54,668
- I can.
- And if I refuse?

272
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:57,070
I would say that you're
putting your career
at serious risk.

273
00:28:57,171 --> 00:29:00,374
You think because of your
condition you have the right
to push people around?

274
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:02,509
I'm sorry.
That is truly pathetic.

275
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,611
Truly?

276
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:06,880
You're damn right, truly.

277
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:10,250
Well, forgive me, truly,

278
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,254
if I insist on having
someone with your brains
and a fresh pair of eyes.

279
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:17,124
There's a life
at stake here, Officer.

280
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:20,194
Paulie, we're gonna
need some key people
and some tech support.

281
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:22,229
Okay?
I know the guys.

282
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:24,231
Okay.

283
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,433
What the hell
are you smiling at?

284
00:29:36,143 --> 00:29:38,045
Pull up a chair.

285
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:41,748
I want you to tell me
everything you know
about the crime scene.

286
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:45,118
Basically,
it's all in my report.
I read your report.

287
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:47,688
I want to know
want you felt,

288
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:50,190
what you feel...

289
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,593
in the deepest recesses
of your senses.

290
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:56,330
Why, you really are
in love with the sound
of your own voice, aren't you?

291
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,733
Now it's your voice I'm yearning
to hear. Pull up a chair.
I won't bite you.

292
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:31,265
The rifling on the.38 slug
they dug out ofthe victim...

293
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:35,169
is consistent with
a Webley, a very old
turn-of-the-century handgun.

294
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:38,238
Thank you, Kenny. On the
big board, please. Paulie,
what do you got on that bolt?

295
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:41,775
There's three initials
on the head... N.S.G.

296
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:44,378
And the bolt's not steel.
It's iron.

297
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,947
Iron? Iron, iron.

298
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:50,651
Making it old, like the Webley.

299
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:53,153
Officer Donaghy, what do you
know about asbestos?

300
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:56,123
Uh, it kills hard-working
Americans every day.

301
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:59,660
Very good.
You computer literate?
- A little.

302
00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:03,630
Thelma! Thelma?
Where's my Thelma?

303
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,632
Yes.

304
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:07,968
Thelma, meet Amelia.
Amelia, Thelma.

305
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:10,404
Amelia hates my books
and also computers,

306
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:12,406
but she's got an A-plus nose
for evidence.

307
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:16,577
So I want you
to give her a crash course
in how to access D.E.P. files.

308
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,148
Check and see if there'sany
large asbestos cleanups going
on anywhere in the city, okay?

309
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:24,084
A.S.A.P.

310
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:26,320
Where the hell
is Eddie Ortiz?
I'm right here!

311
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:29,756
¤ Quepasa, paco?
¤ Quepasa, Eddie?

312
00:31:29,857 --> 00:31:32,226
How's the world's
crankiest criminalist doing?

313
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:35,863
- Playing beat the clock,
you know?
- Everybody's worst nightmare.

314
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:39,433
You get into a cab, and there's
a damn psycho from Jersey
behind the wheel.

315
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,435
We don't know
he's from Jersey.

316
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:44,671
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.

317
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:48,208
- What'd you do?
Bring the whole lab with you?
- Mama told me "be prepared."

318
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,844
- Where do you want this shit?
- Over here in the corner.

319
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:53,981
How is your mother?
Oh, God. She's 76,

320
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:56,750
and she's schtupping
some guy named Morris.

321
00:31:56,884 --> 00:32:00,187
- God bless her.
- But it's Morris the schtarker
I'm worried about.

322
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:03,857
He's 79 with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.

323
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:05,659
Hey.

324
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:15,369
- Afternoon. Captain Cheney.
Amelia, what do
yougot on that asbestos?

325
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:18,906
There's about
a dozen cleanups scattered
about the five boroughs.

326
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:20,908
Put it up on the viewer for me,
will you, please?

327
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,977
See if you can narrow it down
to the oldest location
as soon as you can.

328
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:26,079
How're you doing, Howard?
Fine, thank you.

329
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,916
How's it going?
In the middle of the middle,
as you can see.

330
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:33,520
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Linc, look what I found
on the threading of that bolt.

331
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:37,691
Huh. I was hoping
to grab a minute with you,
if you don't mind.

332
00:32:37,824 --> 00:32:41,595
- Excuse me, Howard.
- Oh. Sorry, sorry.

333
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:46,133
We got Officer Donaghy here
to thank for photographing
the crucial evidence.

334
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:49,269
Crucial evidence?
We don't know that.

335
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:53,140
Listen, Linc, I just
stopped by to make sure you
had all the support you need.

336
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,744
As you know, I'm putting
the full resources of my
department at your... disposal.

337
00:32:57,878 --> 00:33:00,280
And I appreciate it,
Howie. Thankyou.

338
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,249
But the thing is, Linc,

339
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:06,954
you see, I've formalized the
department's standard procedures
since you were in charge, so...

340
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:09,623
Eddie, could you put what you
got up on my screen, please?

341
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:13,427
So I'd appreciate it
if you kept me in the loop.

342
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,064
- Absolutely.
- At all times.

343
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:21,235
At all... Eddie, what the hell
is that we're looking at?

344
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:25,305
Uh, oldpaper.

345
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,474
Coarsegrade.

346
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:31,111
I'd say, uh,
80, 90 years old.

347
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:33,480
Turn of the century,
it looks like.

348
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,583
Huh. The perp
likes old.

349
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:39,453
Uh, fine, then.

350
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:43,390
Look, I'll be in my office
if you need me.
Yeah, okay, Howard.

351
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,459
Good.

352
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:52,833
Old paper.
Old gun.

353
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:58,705
Buries his victim in a vintage
Civil War railroadbed.

354
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:02,376
Sand.

355
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:05,812
Sand, sand. What...
Eddie, what do you got
on the sand?

356
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:10,350
Doesn't really
look like sand.

357
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:13,520
I'm not sure.
Can you individuate it?

358
00:34:13,654 --> 00:34:16,323
Oh, if I had an E.D.X. here,
I could do anything.

359
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:19,193
We don't have a goddamn
"E" the fuck "X," Eddie!

360
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:22,262
Oh, look who forgot their
chill pill this morning.
Excuse me.

361
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:25,399
Come on.
I'm all over this thing now.

362
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:29,469
Okay, we're talking,
uh, pearly looking.

363
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:35,042
Some kind of a...
shellfish or something.

364
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:38,679
Oyster shells maybe?

365
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,383
Could be.

366
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:46,486
Definitely. If I had to bet
on it, I'd say it was. Sure.

367
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:52,125
Allright, I got it. The oldest
asbestos sites are coming up.

368
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:27,895
In 1913 when the Woolworth
Building was being built,

369
00:35:28,028 --> 00:35:31,532
workmen found the body
of this rich industrialist,
Talbot Soames.

370
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:35,002
He'd been kidnapped
the year before,
shot in the head and buried.

371
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:38,739
And what they thought
was white sand turned out
to be oyster... shells.

372
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:43,644
Crushed oyster shells. That's
what they used as landfill
in lower Manhattan.

373
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,513
That's how Pearl Street
got its name. That's where
Mrs. Rubin's gonna be.

374
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:48,782
Somewhere downtown.

375
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:51,318
She's gonna be underground.

376
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:56,557
She's gonna be in
a basement... near...
or in the Woolworth Building.

377
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,459
Hey, Paulie.
Call Emergency Services Unit.

378
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,628
Have them meet us
down by the Woolworth Building.

379
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:03,797
Tell them to start their search.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

380
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:06,166
Okay? Eddie.
Did you bring your van?
Yeah.

381
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:08,202
Uh, it's downstairs.
We're gonna need it.

382
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:11,638
Throw your keys to Amelia.
Paulie, you and Solomon
go with her.

383
00:36:11,738 --> 00:36:13,707
- Shouldn't I go with them?
- No, you gotta stay here
with me.

384
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:16,643
We gotta work that bolt.
That's the missing piece.

385
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:19,813
- Shall we keep
Cheney in the loop?
- Fuck him.

386
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:21,715
Fuck him.

387
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:28,689
Amelia. Trust me.

388
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:33,360
Follow those instincts
you were born with.
I'll be with you...

389
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:35,462
every step of the way.

390
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,975
Jesus, 25 minutes left.

391
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:54,047
How did Rhyme
get to be that way?
He was
born brilliant. It happens.

392
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:56,917
I mean
the physical part.

393
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:59,920
About four years ago,
he was working the body
of a transit cop...

394
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,323
been found shot
in a subway tunnel.

395
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:06,827
Beam came down, damn near
cut him in half.

396
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:11,365
Jesus. Family?

397
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:13,867
Married sister in Phoenix.

398
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:17,237
He never sees her.
Cut himself off.

399
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:21,241
Technically, he's
still on active duty,
collecting full pay.

400
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:24,278
P.B.A. insurance picks up
round-the-clock care
and all the gadgets.

401
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:27,514
On weekends, always one or
two cops there lending a hand.

402
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:30,784
Tough deal
winding up like that.
You won't hear him complaining.

403
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,287
Nah, he gets too much pleasure
pushing other people's buttons.

404
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:36,023
In your case,
I'd be complimented.

405
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:40,194
You gotta learn to relax
around a compliment,
especially one from Rhyme.

406
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,829
- You can be a little grating.
- Me?

407
00:37:42,963 --> 00:37:46,366
Kiddo, if you were any more
wound up, you'd be a Timex.

408
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:53,941
He was a human dynamo...
writing books,

409
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:57,911
lecturing all over the world,
giving expert opinion in trials,

410
00:37:58,011 --> 00:37:59,947
working half the crime scenes
in the city.

411
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:03,517
- You know what he'd do
in his downtime?
- I can't imagine.

412
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,687
He'd collect things...
dirt, metals, plastics,

413
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,057
hubcaps, plants,
musical strings,

414
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,392
medical tools,
anything you could think of.

415
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:15,062
- Obsessive.
- No, he'd have it all analyzed
and catalogued...

416
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:17,731
for his what cha call it...
database.

417
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,270
Jesus Christ! I'd like
to get there in one piece,
if possible.

418
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:50,864
New York Security Gate Company.
Start looking through those?

419
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:53,000
- That might
be good. What else?
- Nicholas Steven Gerard.

420
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:56,403
- Elevator construction.
- Gotta be underground.

421
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:58,405
I got a subway builder.
Sounds...

422
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,742
Excuse me! N.S.G.
Niagra Steam Generation.

423
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:04,978
Bought by Eastern Gas
and Electric in 1928.

424
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:09,349
The six-inch iron bolt
was used mainly for
steam pipe assemblies.

425
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:54,628
No. No.

426
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:58,198
349,you got 11
minutes left. Where are you?

427
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:01,068
We just hit
the financial district.

428
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:05,806
There's a steam junction...
with big asbestos-coated pipes.

429
00:40:05,939 --> 00:40:08,742
That's where
our victim's gonna be.
I'd bet my legs on it.

430
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:10,744
She's gonna be
at Wall and Nassau.

431
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:13,914
Wall and Nassau.
Has E.S.U. been notifiied?

432
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:16,683
They're on their way. They'll
probably get there before you.

433
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:21,054
E.S.U. says that steam is
released through that junction
every day at 4:00 p.m.

434
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:23,924
Shit, what's this asshole
up to?

435
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:27,060
I don't know,
but it's gonna happen in about
ten minutes and thirty seconds.

436
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:30,564
All right, Linc, we're here.
We're going down there.

437
00:40:34,368 --> 00:40:36,336
Amelia?

438
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,438
Yeah, I'm here.

439
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:42,242
It's their job to try and
save Mrs. Rubin's life. It's
your job to get ready and...

440
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:45,512
work the crimescene,
if necessary.

441
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:50,217
There's some
things you're gonna need.
Look in the back of the truck,

442
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:55,856
and you'll see an aluminium
suitcase and a radio headset.

443
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,760
See it?
Yeah, I see them.

444
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:25,419
There must be a way in.

445
00:41:25,552 --> 00:41:28,789
What's the problem here?
Fuckin' valves freeze up easy.

446
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,791
Come on, guys.
Shut it off.

447
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:34,461
You there?
I'm here.

448
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:37,564
I'm inside the pipe.

449
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:44,338
Go!

450
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:49,576
I hear something!
I hear something!

451
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,813
What is that? Someone's in
there! I can hear her crying.

452
00:41:52,946 --> 00:41:56,717
Everyone, quiet now!
Shut all the valves down.

453
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,697
- Mrs. Rubin?

454
00:42:10,797 --> 00:42:12,699
Mrs. Rubin?

455
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:17,137
She's in there, Linc.

456
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:21,275
Mrs. Rubin,
we're on our way in now!

457
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:25,112
Come on, guys.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's hurry the fuck up.

458
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:31,351
- Get drill and a tap.
- Somebody cut this thing
halfway through.

459
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:33,620
There's no way to turn
that steam off, guys.

460
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,579
Back! Back!

461
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:35,349
Paulie?

462
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:37,384
Paulie?

463
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:44,258
Linc, she's gone.

464
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:47,094
The whole place
is scalded in steam.

465
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:47,327
Let's go!
This way!

466
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,029
Let's go!
This way!

467
00:43:49,162 --> 00:43:53,100
...is in some way...
E.S.U. are gonna blow a hole
in the subbasement wall.

468
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:55,302
- There's no other way in.
- It's my understanding...

469
00:43:55,435 --> 00:43:58,472
I'm working with Chief Murphy's
authorization on this, right?

470
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:02,709
Yeah, that's right.
I don't want those Emergency
Services guys rushing in there,

471
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:06,280
trampling the evidence
before we get a chance
to run the scene.

472
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,284
What do you want?
When they blow the hole,
I want Donaghy to go in first.

473
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:15,022
Hey, come on, Linc. She's not
trained for this. We could
get our asses in a sling.

474
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,791
My ass has been in a sling
for four years.

475
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:21,094
Tell Hanson and his beasts
that's what I want. Period.

476
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:23,130
Allright.
You got it.

477
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:33,373
Okay, let's move!

478
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:41,448
All the pipes in the junction
have been secured.

479
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:43,450
Right. Check all the way
to Broadway.

480
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,452
I'm doing this
under protest, Sellitto.

481
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:47,454
The perp could still be
in there, for Christ's sake.

482
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:50,490
Rhyme's in charge,
and they're his orders.

483
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:53,760
You can't handle it in there,
I want you to get your ass out.

484
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:56,330
Amelia, you ready?
Yeah.

485
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,233
Listen to me.

486
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,869
I'm with you
every step of the way.

487
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:04,371
Go on.

488
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:07,241
Good luck.

489
00:45:17,684 --> 00:45:20,053
I'm in.
Tell me what you see.

490
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:30,831
Everything's been
boiled to hell.

491
00:45:35,636 --> 00:45:39,206
Oh, God.
What is it?

492
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:41,808
It's an awful smell.

493
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:44,678
That means you're close.

494
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:10,871
I can't believe
I'm doing this.
You're fine.

495
00:46:11,004 --> 00:46:15,843
Just fine. You're doing great.
Now just remember the academy.

496
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:19,346
When you walk,
move in a straight line.

497
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,015
We don't want to disturb
any footprints he might 've left.

498
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:24,551
Yeah, assuming he's gone.

499
00:46:32,526 --> 00:46:36,296
There's no footprints.
There's nothing yet.

500
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:53,580
Oh, God.

501
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,983
What?

502
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,151
Talk to me.

503
00:46:58,285 --> 00:47:00,187
Talk to me, Amelia.

504
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:03,323
I can see her.

505
00:47:08,295 --> 00:47:10,564
The steam pipe was opened,

506
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:13,634
and she's tied down
right in front of it.

507
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:16,470
Okay. There's nothing
you can do about that now.

508
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:19,039
You can't do anything for her
but help her by...

509
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:22,242
working the crime scene;
that's your job.

510
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:25,045
Open your suitcase.
Get your camera.

511
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:11,959
- I can't do this.
- You can do it.

512
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,961
Yes, you can. Yesterday
you stopped a train.

513
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:16,530
You can do anything you want
when you put your mind to it.

514
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:18,565
Don't work me, Rhyme.

515
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:27,274
Just tell me
what to do next.

516
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:30,277
Very slowly, walk the grid...

517
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:32,579
one foot in front of the other.

518
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:40,254
I want you
to look around you now.

519
00:48:40,354 --> 00:48:43,257
Remember, crime scenes
are three dimensional.

520
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:45,325
Floors, wall sand ceilings.

521
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,202
- Rhyme.
- Yeah, I'm here.

522
00:48:57,638 --> 00:49:00,607
There's something strange.

523
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:02,609
Things he left for us?

524
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:08,549
Yes.

525
00:49:08,649 --> 00:49:12,486
In a cluster again?
There's a small piece of wood...

526
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:15,255
and, uh, looks like
some hair.

527
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:17,391
All right, I'm gonna walk you
through collecting the evidence.

528
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:19,760
You do everything
exactly as I say.

529
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:33,440
Oh, Jesus.
Talk to me.

530
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:37,044
It's a bloody bone.
Where is it?

531
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:41,915
It's in my fucking hand.

532
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:43,917
Human?

533
00:49:46,386 --> 00:49:48,288
I think so, yeah.

534
00:49:48,388 --> 00:49:52,826
All right.
Photograph it. Bag it.

535
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:14,481
Okay, that's it.
I'm outta here.

536
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:16,517
One more thing.

537
00:50:16,617 --> 00:50:18,986
We gotta process the body.

538
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:23,090
Wha... I'm not a medical
examiner. I can't do that.

539
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:27,427
I'm not asking you
to do an autopsy.
I just want you to...

540
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:29,463
Just describe the restraints.

541
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:38,338
Okay.

542
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:45,279
They're strange-looking
handcuffs.

543
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:47,748
They look more like
old shackles or something.

544
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:55,222
There's a chain, uh,
across her waist.

545
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:59,393
And her feet are, uh,
are bound with a rope.

546
00:51:01,995 --> 00:51:04,898
Hands above her head?

547
00:51:04,998 --> 00:51:06,900
Yeah.

548
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:12,673
There's also a large, uh,
a piece of flesh...

549
00:51:12,806 --> 00:51:16,343
missing from her right forearm.

550
00:51:16,476 --> 00:51:19,980
It's right down to the bone.
It looks like it was
surgically removed.

551
00:51:21,148 --> 00:51:23,050
This is
what I want you to do.

552
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,953
We're gonna need
those handcuffs, Amelia.

553
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:29,556
It's probably our
best chance for good prints.

554
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,658
The M.E. can remove them
when they get here.

555
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:33,961
M.E. is all thumbs.
They're...

556
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:35,996
They'll mess up the prints.

557
00:51:36,096 --> 00:51:39,466
Look in the suitcase.
There's a small saw.

558
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:49,543
Okay.

559
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:52,946
I want you to saw her hands off
at the wrist line.

560
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:56,517
We gotta have those cuffs
for prints.

561
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:20,474
I can't.

562
00:52:20,574 --> 00:52:23,477
Cut her hands off.
We need the handcuffs.

563
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:25,212
I can't. No.

564
00:52:25,345 --> 00:52:29,917
Saw off her hands.
Take off the cuffs.

565
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,019
- I can't.
- Listen to me.

566
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,721
- Saw off her...
We need those cuffs.
- I can't!

567
00:52:34,855 --> 00:52:37,324
- Amelia, we need...
- No! Fuck you!

568
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:42,162
Amelia. Amelia.

569
00:52:47,734 --> 00:52:50,704
He wants the woman's hands
cut off, he can come
and do it himself.

570
00:52:57,311 --> 00:53:01,515
Amelia? Amelia.

571
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:08,188
Amelia.

572
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:27,841
That'll be 16.50.

573
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:51,785
Hello?

574
00:55:51,885 --> 00:55:53,787
Who is it?

575
00:56:08,235 --> 00:56:10,137
Hello?

576
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,655
Jesus.

577
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,544
Hey, hey, take it easy!

578
00:56:50,677 --> 00:56:52,379
Shit! Solomon,
what are you doing?

579
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:56,617
- Are you okay?
- What the fuck are you doing?

580
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,720
Rhyme's been trying
to call you for hours.

581
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,256
Your phone's down.
He was concerned.

582
00:57:02,356 --> 00:57:06,727
My phone's fine.
I don't need his concern.

583
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:10,697
He needs you over
to his place right away.

584
00:57:10,797 --> 00:57:14,902
Well, I don't work
for Lincoln Rhyme.

585
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:18,105
Rhyme believes the evidence
you collected is telling him
there's another vic in play.

586
00:57:18,238 --> 00:57:21,208
And he is laying that
at my feet?
Hey.

587
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:23,410
Don't shoot the messenger.

588
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:49,269
You just move in?
Uh, yeah,
about ayearago.

589
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,943
Really?

590
00:58:12,926 --> 00:58:14,828
You were a model.

591
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:18,465
- Yeah, when I was a kid.
- Kid model to street cop.

592
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,501
There's a leap.

593
00:58:24,104 --> 00:58:27,074
For whatever it's worth,

594
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:29,776
I thought what you did today
was pretty damn terrific.

595
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:15,556
Hey, you guys,
I'm outta here.

596
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:17,991
I'm gonna grab a cab.
I've got a paper to finish.

597
00:59:18,091 --> 00:59:19,993
I'm just gonna hang.
No problem.

598
00:59:20,093 --> 00:59:22,462
I'll be there
in a minute.

599
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:25,499
Can I finish that?
Go for it.

600
00:59:30,103 --> 00:59:32,206
I'll see you outside.

601
00:59:38,946 --> 00:59:40,881
Taxi.

602
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:53,093
That bone's
definitely not human.

603
00:59:53,227 --> 00:59:56,196
And the hair?
Not human either.

604
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,298
Well, what is it?

605
00:59:58,398 --> 01:00:01,235
I'm workin'
fast as I can.

606
01:00:02,669 --> 01:00:05,072
Glad to see
you could join us.

607
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:08,642
I got Cheney on the line.
He wants you to brief him.

608
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:11,245
Tell him I'll
call him back.

609
01:00:12,513 --> 01:00:15,282
Two things:

610
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:18,085
First, you did
a hell of a job
locating the evidence.

611
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:21,989
There's no question
the perp knows forensics.

612
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:25,192
Now, as for the other
thing, the, uh...

613
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:31,765
you know,
the victim's hands,
well, maybe, um...

614
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:37,504
maybe it was
too much to handle,
so we'll just forget it.

615
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:41,742
Is that your version
of an apology?
An apology?

616
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,311
Is that why you
came over here?

617
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:46,613
You really are
a piece of work.

618
01:00:46,747 --> 01:00:48,682
Well, aren't we a pair.

619
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:53,120
I think you're terrific.

620
01:00:56,757 --> 01:01:00,093
You got a hell
of an arrest record too.

621
01:01:00,194 --> 01:01:04,831
High marks from all your bosses.
Definite goldshield potential.

622
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:08,268
Why do you want
to throw it all away
to chase youth offenders?

623
01:01:08,368 --> 01:01:11,572
I don't feel I have any need
to explain that to you.

624
01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:13,607
Come on, Amelia,
cop to cop.

625
01:01:13,707 --> 01:01:17,411
Cop to cop,
let's just leave it
at personal reasons.

626
01:01:17,544 --> 01:01:19,613
Okay.

627
01:01:19,746 --> 01:01:22,950
Doesn't have anything to do
with your father, does it?

628
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:31,291
Man, you just keep charging
at walls, don't you?

629
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:34,094
Stubbornness is
something we both share.

630
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,664
You know, they say,
genetically speaking,

631
01:01:37,764 --> 01:01:40,400
that we come into this world
with a preordained destiny.

632
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:43,136
I don't believe it, though.
For example, my parents.

633
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,706
Neither of them had more than
an eighth grade education,

634
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:49,743
never read more than one book
between them, not one.

635
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:54,248
I've read thousands.
I've written a dozen.
What's your point?

636
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:58,619
My point... is that destiny
is what you make it.

637
01:02:01,355 --> 01:02:04,391
Whatever happened
to your father doesn't mean
it's gonna happen to you.

638
01:02:04,525 --> 01:02:08,228
You're a great cop.
You'll make
a terrific detective.

639
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:11,932
It's a gift.

640
01:02:12,032 --> 01:02:14,601
Don't throw it away.

641
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,877
A report from
the Taxi Commission.

642
01:02:24,011 --> 01:02:26,780
An NYU student was abducted
late last night.

643
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:30,150
His girlfriend saw him
struggling to get out
as the taxi driver...

644
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:32,052
was bludgeoning him
with a flashlight.

645
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:34,087
No description
of the driver.

646
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:37,524
- Okay, everybody,
this could be our next victim.
- Yeah, Tony.

647
01:02:37,624 --> 01:02:41,461
Paulie here.
It looks like we got
another victim.

648
01:02:41,562 --> 01:02:44,698
Did you get a deadline
off that evidence yet?

649
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:49,837
Not yet.
Something I was hoping
you'd help me with.

650
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:12,486
No! No!

651
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:15,455
No!

652
01:04:16,957 --> 01:04:20,794
Anyone for
some osso buco?

653
01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:22,996
What?

654
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:27,467
The bone we found
at the Wall Street scene...
veal shank.

655
01:04:27,568 --> 01:04:29,803
Braised and overly salted
to boot.

656
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:31,872
A cow bone?
Uh-huh.

657
01:04:32,005 --> 01:04:35,876
And I also found a piece
of that old paper...

658
01:04:35,976 --> 01:04:37,845
embedded in the bone.

659
01:04:37,945 --> 01:04:41,148
Take a look.

660
01:04:43,483 --> 01:04:46,820
What's going on?
Just do what you need to do
as quickly as possible.

661
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,389
This came in from the F.B.I.
It's about the hair follicles.
He says they're not human.

662
01:04:49,523 --> 01:04:53,160
A rodent, probably a rat.
Get this... they were
shaved off.

663
01:04:53,293 --> 01:04:57,097
Now we're looking
for a rat that shaves.
I really like that.

664
01:04:57,197 --> 01:05:00,067
I've known a few in my time.
How about you, Amelia?

665
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:01,935
More than a few.

666
01:05:02,035 --> 01:05:05,506
It's consistent
with underground,
that's for sure, huh?

667
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:09,643
What's he trying to say to us?
Defiinitely communicating
in our language.

668
01:05:09,776 --> 01:05:12,012
Leaving clues.
Forensic clues, at that.

669
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:15,949
- Maybe it's a cop.
- Maybe.

670
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:19,653
Maybe he's trying to share
the responsibility of
these murders with us.

671
01:05:19,786 --> 01:05:22,856
If we don't figure out
the clues in time,
the blood's on our hands.

672
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:26,994
And if we don't find the victim
in time, we're as responsible
for the murders as he is.

673
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:29,596
What do you got on that dirt
you scraped from the wood?

674
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:34,468
I don't have it 100 percent
individuated, but it does
appear nitrogen-rich.

675
01:05:34,568 --> 01:05:38,572
All set.
Ready to rock and roll.
Thanks for rushing, man.

676
01:05:38,705 --> 01:05:41,008
Allright, Thelma.
Thankyou, Richard.

677
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:45,546
Nitrogen-rich.
Explosive carbons. Where
do you find those in New York?

678
01:05:45,646 --> 01:05:48,715
Bomb sites.
Shooting ranges.

679
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:51,385
Maybe an old fort
or an armory.

680
01:05:51,518 --> 01:05:54,721
- Let's not forget
the shit factor, guys.
- The what?

681
01:05:54,821 --> 01:05:57,724
Manure becomes a nitrate
when it's aged.

682
01:05:57,824 --> 01:06:00,227
That's true.

683
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:02,963
And you got
cow bones, huh?

684
01:06:03,096 --> 01:06:06,834
Old cow bones, old manure.
Turn of the century.

685
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:11,038
Cows, farms,
pastures, rats.

686
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:14,341
Dead cows.

687
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:18,212
Where do you find...
In stockyards.

688
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:20,714
Slaughterhouses...
that's what we wanna look for.

689
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:23,417
Stockyards and slaughterhouses
from turn of the century.

690
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:25,786
Let's start there.
Check the Internet.

691
01:06:25,886 --> 01:06:28,856
Okay, I want tax records,
sanitation records...

692
01:06:28,956 --> 01:06:32,659
and building code inspections,
last hundred years,
okay?

693
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:18,872
Your blood pressure
is way up.

694
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:25,379
You're pushing it
too hard, Rhyme.
I understand, Thelma.

695
01:07:25,479 --> 01:07:30,284
What do we got
on the stockyards over there?
Almost there.

696
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:32,853
You okay?
No, I'm not okay.

697
01:07:32,986 --> 01:07:35,455
I can't figure out
this damn time line...

698
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:37,491
or these shards
of cardboard.

699
01:07:37,591 --> 01:07:40,060
I don't know
what the hell it means.
Uh, yeah.

700
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,197
We got three
defunct stockyard sites.
There's one on the East Side.

701
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,098
Lexington and
the Harlem River Viaduct.
Good.

702
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,603
Solomon, put the box down.
Mark it down on the viewer
as she calls them off.

703
01:07:49,703 --> 01:07:53,106
Your blood pressure's
gonna blow a gasket
if you don't slow down.

704
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:57,144
My body has a mind of its own.
It doesn't listen to me,
all right?

705
01:07:57,277 --> 01:07:58,846
What else, Amelia?

706
01:07:58,979 --> 01:08:02,583
Yeah, there's another
on the Hudson up at 155th.

707
01:08:02,716 --> 01:08:07,087
- Mark it down, Solomon.
- Look, your stats
are going down.

708
01:08:07,187 --> 01:08:10,257
- You saw him have a seizure
the otherday.
- What else?

709
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:13,861
- There's one underground
at Greenwich and Houston.
- Mark it down, Solomon.

710
01:08:13,994 --> 01:08:19,032
- Why don't you
knock it off, Linc?
- I don't need to knock it off!

711
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:31,011
Wh-What was the first one
that you mentioned?

712
01:08:31,144 --> 01:08:33,447
Lexington and
the Harlem River Viaduct.

713
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:36,116
- And when did it close?
- 1910.

714
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:39,620
Okay, what about, uh...
Houston and Greenwich?

715
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,655
When is that?
Uh, 1898.

716
01:08:41,755 --> 01:08:45,359
And Hudson and 155th
was closed in 1906.

717
01:08:45,492 --> 01:08:47,728
1906, 1898...

718
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:52,733
All right.
Let's... 1898.

719
01:08:55,169 --> 01:08:57,271
Houston and Greenwich.
Call Emergency Services, Paulie.

720
01:08:57,404 --> 01:09:01,542
Tell 'em... meet us
at Houston and Greenwich, okay?

721
01:09:01,675 --> 01:09:05,112
Solomon, get on to Hanson.
He'll need about 20 guys.

722
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:10,284
- You go with them.
Come on, guys! Let's go!

723
01:09:29,736 --> 01:09:31,672
Linc, you there?

724
01:09:31,772 --> 01:09:33,841
Yeah. Ready.

725
01:09:33,974 --> 01:09:35,976
We're here.

726
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:38,579
Okay. Amelia?

727
01:09:38,712 --> 01:09:40,681
Yeah.

728
01:09:40,781 --> 01:09:43,684
All right. Same drill.
I want you in first.

729
01:09:45,152 --> 01:09:47,120
Let's do it.

730
01:10:12,012 --> 01:10:14,314
You watch yourself,
Amelia.

731
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:21,989
Man, I don't
like this.

732
01:10:22,089 --> 01:10:24,191
I don't like this.

733
01:10:27,261 --> 01:10:29,796
Linc, I got a bad feeling
about this, man.

734
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:33,100
I think all three of us
ought to get in there together.

735
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,035
Not yet, Paulie.
Just hold back.

736
01:10:41,308 --> 01:10:43,844
I'm going down some stairs.

737
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:49,416
Cement walls.

738
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:56,023
Woodcrates.

739
01:10:56,123 --> 01:10:59,026
Large columns.

740
01:10:59,126 --> 01:11:02,529
Smells like manure down here.

741
01:11:02,629 --> 01:11:04,932
Ortiz sure knows
hiss hit, huh?

742
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:08,302
Always has.

743
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:12,706
Metal hooks...

744
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,442
and a pen.

745
01:11:15,576 --> 01:11:17,611
It's a slaughterhouse.

746
01:11:31,258 --> 01:11:33,894
Come on, guys.
Go, go, go, go!

747
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:37,764
E.S.U. are here.
You hold 'em off.

748
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:40,267
Don't want 'em
contaminating the scene.

749
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:44,271
Hold it.
Hold up, hold up!

750
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:46,340
You're not to go in.
Why?

751
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,543
Rhyme's orders.
Fuck him!
Get me Cheney on the line.

752
01:11:49,676 --> 01:11:52,079
Crimescene C.O. on air.

753
01:11:52,179 --> 01:11:55,148
Switch to channel 22
for E.S.U.
Fuck Rhyme.

754
01:12:06,894 --> 01:12:08,795
Maybe this one's
still alive.

755
01:12:08,896 --> 01:12:11,198
Perp didn't leave
a deadline.

756
01:12:11,298 --> 01:12:13,534
What does that mean?

757
01:12:13,634 --> 01:12:15,936
It means we're probably
too late.

758
01:12:16,036 --> 01:12:19,373
- You don't know that, Rhyme.
- Get off the line.

759
01:12:21,074 --> 01:12:23,310
Just move on, Amelia.

760
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:29,850
You know, there's
five basic contaminants
to every crime scene.

761
01:12:29,983 --> 01:12:33,387
I'll skip to the worst one...
other cops.

762
01:12:39,126 --> 01:12:41,061
I think
I hear something.

763
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:48,235
I hate this shit.

764
01:12:56,977 --> 01:12:58,912
I see something.
Something's there.

765
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:19,967
I think I found him.

766
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,903
l... I can't tell
if he's alive.

767
01:13:26,673 --> 01:13:29,409
Oh, geez.
He's covered in rats.

768
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:31,979
They're all over him.

769
01:13:42,656 --> 01:13:45,158
We're goin' in.
No, you're not.
No, you're not!

770
01:13:51,698 --> 01:13:55,936
- Go, go!
- Central, we have
shots fired. Shots fired.

771
01:14:04,878 --> 01:14:06,780
Oh, God.

772
01:14:12,886 --> 01:14:16,223
You were right.
We never had a shot.

773
01:14:17,558 --> 01:14:20,827
He cut him up pretty bad
and left him for the rats.

774
01:14:20,928 --> 01:14:24,731
There's also
a big cut in his leg.
It's right down to the bone.

775
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:28,402
The blood
attracted the rats.

776
01:14:33,607 --> 01:14:35,909
Goddamn son of a bitch.

777
01:14:44,117 --> 01:14:46,019
You okay?

778
01:14:54,194 --> 01:14:58,332
I'm fine.
You wanna step aside
so I can walk the grid?

779
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:03,504
Yeah. Yeah.
All right.

780
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:07,574
Let's back 'em up.
Let's give her some room.
Move it, guys.

781
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,511
Rhyme, I'm gonna walk the grid.

782
01:15:10,611 --> 01:15:12,513
Okay.

783
01:15:12,613 --> 01:15:15,482
You know what to do.

784
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:36,770
Rhyme, I found it.

785
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:38,939
Another cluster.

786
01:15:39,072 --> 01:15:42,142
It's a piece of old paper,
just like the other two.

787
01:15:42,276 --> 01:15:44,745
And a matchbox.

788
01:15:44,845 --> 01:15:49,383
Will somebody get that
black suitcase and bring it
over here, please?

789
01:15:49,516 --> 01:15:52,486
Pull out the brown envelope.

790
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:58,725
Sounds like you're starting
to enjoy this work.

791
01:16:04,765 --> 01:16:07,167
Damn!
The press is here.

792
01:16:10,103 --> 01:16:12,005
Right there,
right there.

793
01:16:15,442 --> 01:16:19,479
Lincoln Rhyme is
no longer working this case.
I'm takin' over. Understood?

794
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:23,450
Do what you wanna do,
Captain, but maybe you ought
to check with Murphy first.

795
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:25,519
Fuck Murphy
and fuck Rhyme.

796
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:29,556
This has been cleared downtown.
We got a dead kid in there.

797
01:16:29,656 --> 01:16:33,527
I, for one, am not taking
the heat for that.
You understand, hmm?

798
01:16:33,627 --> 01:16:37,364
Call Ortiz.
Tell him and his crew
to vacate Rhyme's place now.

799
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:40,067
Excuse me,
but the victim was already
dead when we arrived.

800
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:45,606
And you, half-assed patrolman
working a crime scene,
those days are over.

801
01:16:45,706 --> 01:16:47,774
I'll take that evidence bag
now, thankyou.

802
01:16:47,908 --> 01:16:50,611
You can take it with a chain
of custody voucher, sir.

803
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:55,048
Are you outta your mind?

804
01:16:55,148 --> 01:16:59,219
Cheney says
he wants all the evidence.
- Hmm?

805
01:16:59,353 --> 01:17:01,889
Let's go.
You're coming with us.

806
01:17:02,022 --> 01:17:03,957
What, are you arresting me?

807
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:08,495
Just get in the car and keep
your mouth shut to the press.

808
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:24,745
You're not
gonna find any prints.
The guy's too good for that.

809
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:36,723
Well, it looks like
we have a nice, clean
friction print here.

810
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:39,927
Unless, of course,
it's yours.

811
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,563
No. I was wearing gloves
when I collected it.

812
01:17:42,696 --> 01:17:46,767
We'll know soon enough.
Put this through,
highest priority.

813
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,936
You got it.
Thank you.

814
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:03,450
Hey, you know,
I got a feeling this perp's
been in business a long time.

815
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:06,753
Yeah, I hear you, but that's
Cheney's problem now.

816
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:10,257
Yeah, that's what scares me.
Do me a favor, will you?

817
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:13,393
Check and see if
there's been any homicides
in the last 12 months...

818
01:18:13,527 --> 01:18:16,163
involving surgically removed
flesh exposing bone.

819
01:18:18,599 --> 01:18:22,035
No problem.
I'll see you soon.

820
01:18:22,169 --> 01:18:24,271
Hope so, Eddie.
Hey, Thelma?

821
01:18:24,404 --> 01:18:28,609
Don't you let him run
no circles around you now.
Stay right, Eddie.

822
01:18:47,261 --> 01:18:52,032
Oh, that print.
We just got a positive
I.D. on it.

823
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:56,103
The guy has three
extremely violent priors.

824
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:59,773
Oh, look at that.
Taxi license, no less.

825
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:04,244
We got him.
Let's go, boys!
Somebody call E.S.U.

826
01:19:21,995 --> 01:19:25,432
Now slide out
nice and easy.

827
01:19:37,878 --> 01:19:40,280
That explains
your print, Captain.

828
01:19:42,749 --> 01:19:45,485
He's now the fourth victim
of a killing spree...

829
01:19:45,586 --> 01:19:48,789
- that has prompted NYPD brass
to launch a taskforce...

830
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:50,791
to track the killer.

831
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:55,729
This morning's raid
follows leads found in one
of the earlier murder sites.

832
01:19:55,829 --> 01:19:57,731
Hey!
Hey.

833
01:19:57,831 --> 01:20:00,167
I was hoping
you'd show up.

834
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:02,970
He's been worried
about you.

835
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:05,472
...Lincoln Rhyme.
Yeah, sure.

836
01:20:05,572 --> 01:20:08,041
Viewers will know Rhyme from
his book, Scene of the Crime,

837
01:20:08,175 --> 01:20:12,479
a chronicle of old New York's
most grisly murders...
Hey.

838
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:15,482
I didn't expect
to see you again.

839
01:20:15,582 --> 01:20:18,318
Poor Cheney, huh?

840
01:20:18,418 --> 01:20:21,522
Grabbed the ball
with both hands and scored
one for the other team.

841
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:23,690
I can't comment
at this time...
Yeah.

842
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:27,728
I tried to warn him
that the perp was too smart
to leave a print.

843
01:20:27,828 --> 01:20:30,464
How you doin'
with that stuff?

844
01:20:30,597 --> 01:20:32,633
Not too good.

845
01:20:32,766 --> 01:20:36,503
Two pieces of the puzzle,
but I don't know what it means.

846
01:20:38,705 --> 01:20:40,674
Maybe this'll help.

847
01:20:40,807 --> 01:20:42,910
Cheney will have
your badge for that.

848
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:46,680
He wouldn't give me
a chain of custody voucher,
so what could I do?

849
01:20:46,813 --> 01:20:49,783
You could bring it
back to him.

850
01:20:49,883 --> 01:20:52,452
The man is a living monument
to ineptitude.

851
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:54,988
True.
Let's take a look.

852
01:20:55,088 --> 01:20:57,491
What do you got there?

853
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:01,595
Ah! Third piece
of the puzzle.

854
01:21:01,728 --> 01:21:04,531
There's something
really strange about it.

855
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:06,533
You gotta smell it.

856
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:11,004
Sure.

857
01:21:11,104 --> 01:21:13,507
Are you...
Oh, shoot.

858
01:21:18,445 --> 01:21:20,914
Sorry.

859
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:23,250
It's okay.
Take your time.

860
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:31,024
Okay.

861
01:21:34,094 --> 01:21:37,197
You have to put it
closer to my nose.

862
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:42,402
What do you think it is?

863
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:45,539
Kerosene?

864
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:50,110
Possibly.

865
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:52,679
This just came in
from Eddie Ortiz.

866
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:55,816
Amelia, could you load these
into the viewer, please?
Shit!

867
01:21:55,949 --> 01:21:58,418
Sorry about that,
Thelma.

868
01:21:58,519 --> 01:22:01,054
E.C.U.
View scan.

869
01:22:03,223 --> 01:22:06,527
"Dear Linc:
I'm enclosing photos of
four unsolved homicides...

870
01:22:06,627 --> 01:22:09,162
"which took place
in the last 12 months.

871
01:22:09,296 --> 01:22:12,766
"Flesh has been
surgically removed from each
of the victims' extremities.

872
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,135
I miss you.
Love, Eddie."

873
01:22:15,235 --> 01:22:19,473
I'm gonna spare myself
the pleasure, if you don't mind.
Okay, Thelma.

874
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:22,910
Zoom.

875
01:22:25,379 --> 01:22:27,314
Same mark.

876
01:22:27,414 --> 01:22:29,283
Right.

877
01:22:29,383 --> 01:22:33,053
Zoom. Zoom.

878
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:36,156
Zoom.

879
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:40,928
Same messages.

880
01:22:44,498 --> 01:22:46,400
It'shim.

881
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,270
The perp was trying
to make contact even then.

882
01:22:51,772 --> 01:22:54,174
But Cheney never
put it together.

883
01:22:58,779 --> 01:23:00,414
Thelma!

884
01:23:00,547 --> 01:23:02,916
Dysreflexia seizure,
a bad one.

885
01:23:03,016 --> 01:23:05,485
Hang on. Hang on, Rhyme.
Breathe now.

886
01:23:05,619 --> 01:23:09,523
Come on.
Breathe with me.
Damn catheter's blocked.

887
01:23:09,623 --> 01:23:14,261
Let meget a B.P. onyou.
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Breathe!

888
01:23:14,394 --> 01:23:17,297
Hang on. Hang on.
Just let me check it.

889
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:22,836
Diastolic's over 125.
I gotta get it down now.

890
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:30,777
Just give it
a few seconds to work.

891
01:23:30,911 --> 01:23:33,881
Come on, breathe with me.
Breathe with me, Rhyme.
Rhyme?

892
01:23:34,014 --> 01:23:36,149
Rhyme! Rhyme!

893
01:23:38,452 --> 01:23:41,421
Come on.

894
01:23:42,623 --> 01:23:44,525
Hang on, Rhyme.
Hang on.

895
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:47,094
Is he gonna
make it?

896
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:50,898
If he does,
he won't be happy.

897
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:53,667
What... What are you
talking about?

898
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,571
He's already finalized
arrangements to self-terminate.

899
01:24:01,141 --> 01:24:03,744
He's convinced
some doctor friend to help...

900
01:24:03,877 --> 01:24:07,414
with his "final transition,"
as he calls it.

901
01:24:07,548 --> 01:24:10,851
But suicide?
I mean...
It's the seizures.

902
01:24:10,951 --> 01:24:15,055
Any one of'em could put him
into a vegetative state.

903
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:18,525
That's what he fears
more than anything.

904
01:24:20,427 --> 01:24:23,330
Who is it?

905
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:26,967
Captain Cheney!
What can I help you with?

906
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,703
Police business.
Open up, please.

907
01:24:29,837 --> 01:24:31,872
Mr. Rhyme is asleep.

908
01:24:32,005 --> 01:24:35,475
Well, wake him up.
I need to see him now.

909
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:41,081
Let me deal with
this asshole Cheney.
You watch him.

910
01:24:41,215 --> 01:24:43,617
Anything, just call me.
He's all right.

911
01:24:51,792 --> 01:24:53,827
Look, lady.

912
01:24:53,961 --> 01:24:57,865
Now, I hope you know
that obstructing justice
is a felony offense.

913
01:24:57,965 --> 01:25:00,901
Look, don't "lady" me.
And I know my rights.

914
01:25:01,001 --> 01:25:04,171
Unless you have a warrant,
you can't come in.
I'm comin'in.

915
01:25:04,304 --> 01:25:08,876
I have reason
to believe there's stolen
evidence on these premises.

916
01:25:09,009 --> 01:25:11,545
Now, what's
your full name, hmm?

917
01:25:11,678 --> 01:25:13,947
Thelma what?

918
01:25:14,047 --> 01:25:18,118
You want to get official, huh?
What did you say your name was?

919
01:25:18,252 --> 01:25:22,189
Allright. I'm not here
to play the name game, honey.

920
01:25:22,322 --> 01:25:25,292
You got a smart mouth,
and it's gonna get you
in trouble one day.

921
01:25:25,425 --> 01:25:29,229
Yeah, and it also may bite
your ass ifyou don't stop
trying to aggravate my patient.

922
01:25:29,329 --> 01:25:32,232
I'm gonna leave now,
but I'll be back.

923
01:25:32,332 --> 01:25:35,269
And when I come back,
it'll be with a warrant.

924
01:25:51,351 --> 01:25:55,956
I looked everywhere,
and I thought the conductor
was gonna be so angry.

925
01:25:56,089 --> 01:26:01,762
I kept on searching everywhere,
and finally it was
right on my lap.

926
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:08,435
Grandma can't wait
to see you.

927
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:04,157
What'd I do?

928
01:27:04,258 --> 01:27:07,160
First off,
you're carrying a fare
and your meter's not on.

929
01:27:07,261 --> 01:27:10,197
Number two, your license
is not displayed...

930
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:16,163
There's laws against
molesting the handicapped,
you know.

931
01:28:18,665 --> 01:28:20,567
Yeah?

932
01:28:24,104 --> 01:28:26,974
I wasn't a pretty sight,
was I?

933
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:35,482
Thelma told me
about your plans for
your "final transition."

934
01:28:40,254 --> 01:28:43,457
Cop to cop, that subject's
not open to discussion.

935
01:28:45,592 --> 01:28:47,828
Why, would you miss me?

936
01:28:47,928 --> 01:28:52,266
Well, destiny's
what we make it, right?

937
01:28:53,734 --> 01:28:56,670
Touche.
You seem to have
your reasons for checking out.

938
01:28:56,770 --> 01:29:00,908
I just...
I would've expected more
from someone like you.

939
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:05,979
Well, I might surprise you
and... live forever.

940
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:09,383
Nothing you could do
would surprise me, Rhyme.
Well!

941
01:29:09,483 --> 01:29:13,187
- Look who's still
in the land of the living.
- For the moment.

942
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,223
Cheney was here,
huffin' and puffin'.

943
01:29:16,323 --> 01:29:19,226
Promised to return
with a warrant.
Sorry I missed him.

944
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:24,298
If that's him,
tell him I'm, uh...
Say no more.

945
01:29:24,398 --> 01:29:26,366
skiing.

946
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:30,637
Hello? Oh, hey, Paulie.
Hang on.

947
01:29:30,771 --> 01:29:33,507
Linc, I don't know
if this is anything more
than a coincidence,

948
01:29:33,607 --> 01:29:37,177
but a taxi inspector
was killed today by a cabbie
who was off the meter.

949
01:29:37,311 --> 01:29:41,048
Thing about this taxi,
a witness... a male,
who wouldn't give his name...

950
01:29:41,148 --> 01:29:45,118
saw the taxi speeding away
with an old man
and a little girl inside.

951
01:29:45,252 --> 01:29:48,856
- Probably the doer that called.
- Jesus, he's got a kid.

952
01:29:48,989 --> 01:29:51,058
And an old man.

953
01:29:51,191 --> 01:29:53,160
Thankyou, Paulie.
Okay.

954
01:29:53,293 --> 01:29:57,364
We better take a closer look
at that third piece
of the puzzle.

955
01:29:57,497 --> 01:29:59,399
Close.

956
01:29:59,499 --> 01:30:02,603
Three murders.
Three evidence clusters.

957
01:30:04,204 --> 01:30:06,840
Three pieces of paper.

958
01:30:06,974 --> 01:30:08,876
View scan.

959
01:30:21,455 --> 01:30:24,491
Come on, Thelma.
You're the queen of puzzles.
What do you see?

960
01:30:26,059 --> 01:30:28,228
I'm looking.
I'm lookin'.

961
01:30:28,362 --> 01:30:32,699
What if we lower
the little one, that one?

962
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:39,873
Twist that big one around.

963
01:30:50,851 --> 01:30:56,156
Doesn't that kind of
look like a face?
Mouth, nose, eye.

964
01:30:56,256 --> 01:30:58,859
Enhance.

965
01:30:58,992 --> 01:31:00,894
Fade.

966
01:31:02,663 --> 01:31:05,165
That's a woman's face.

967
01:31:06,934 --> 01:31:08,969
Yes, it is.

968
01:31:09,102 --> 01:31:11,805
It'sa logo.

969
01:31:11,939 --> 01:31:14,174
An old,

970
01:31:14,274 --> 01:31:16,243
turn-of-the-century...

971
01:31:16,376 --> 01:31:18,245
publisher's logo.

972
01:31:18,345 --> 01:31:20,581
You know it?

973
01:31:20,681 --> 01:31:24,718
I used to own
a few of the books.
Gothic stories.

974
01:31:26,186 --> 01:31:28,121
Crime stories.

975
01:31:28,222 --> 01:31:32,125
The killer is pointing us
to an old book.

976
01:31:57,551 --> 01:31:59,953
Can I help you?

977
01:32:03,457 --> 01:32:06,827
I called before about
turn-of-the-century
crime books.

978
01:32:06,927 --> 01:32:09,029
Around the corner.
Help yourself.

979
01:32:09,162 --> 01:32:11,198
Thanks.

980
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:29,810
Aviation Two to Central.

981
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:32,045
Aviation Two to Central.

982
01:33:32,145 --> 01:33:34,781
We're taking a flyby
at the Brooklyn Bridge.

983
01:33:34,915 --> 01:33:37,684
The report appears
unfounded at this time.

984
01:33:37,684 --> 01:33:38,852
The report appears
unfounded at this time.

985
01:33:38,986 --> 01:33:42,189
Will proceed to check
East River shoreline
and advise.

986
01:33:42,322 --> 01:33:45,726
I need more small boats
over here to search
under the piers.

987
01:33:45,826 --> 01:33:48,362
It's by the heliport.
Under the piers.

988
01:33:48,495 --> 01:33:51,398
Lincoln, it was
the last murder in the book.

989
01:33:51,498 --> 01:33:54,535
They've got to be
along the shore here.
Listen.

990
01:33:54,668 --> 01:33:58,005
The lab says the odor
we smelled on the third
piece of the puzzle...

991
01:33:58,105 --> 01:34:00,073
is probably diesel fuel.

992
01:34:00,207 --> 01:34:04,444
There's an old boat
refueling station at
the Staten Island ferry pier.

993
01:34:04,545 --> 01:34:06,847
Check the pilings
under the pier.

994
01:34:53,594 --> 01:34:56,864
Found them!
Over here!

995
01:34:56,964 --> 01:35:00,033
Here! Here!

996
01:35:00,167 --> 01:35:03,237
Central, I can see someone
with a light signaling us...

997
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:06,039
from the old
Staten Island ferry pier.

998
01:35:06,173 --> 01:35:09,409
There appears to be
two bodies in the water
next to the pilings.

999
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:20,487
Subject signaling is most likely
NYPD officer at the site.
Come on.

1000
01:35:25,559 --> 01:35:28,729
Over here! Here!

1001
01:35:35,836 --> 01:35:38,772
Watch the pilings!

1002
01:35:40,874 --> 01:35:44,011
We've got divers
coming in to you now.

1003
01:35:46,613 --> 01:35:49,716
Come over to the ladder.

1004
01:35:52,986 --> 01:35:56,123
Central, be advised
aideds are out of the water...

1005
01:35:56,256 --> 01:35:59,393
and E.S.U. is working
on them at this time.

1006
01:35:59,526 --> 01:36:01,929
Choppers on standby.

1007
01:36:05,532 --> 01:36:07,467
Rhyme, you there?

1008
01:36:07,568 --> 01:36:11,004
Yeah.
Looks like
we're too late.

1009
01:36:11,138 --> 01:36:13,674
Uh-uh, forget it.
He's dead.

1010
01:36:13,807 --> 01:36:16,476
Bring the chopper in.

1011
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:18,579
The old man is gone.

1012
01:36:18,712 --> 01:36:22,049
They're still working
on the little girl,
but it doesn't look good.

1013
01:36:24,151 --> 01:36:26,587
We need a Task Level One
mobilization, okay?

1014
01:36:26,687 --> 01:36:29,256
Let's try it again.
I know she's still there.
Come on, kid.

1015
01:36:29,389 --> 01:36:32,025
Come on. Try it.

1016
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:35,028
Breathe. Come on.
You can do it.

1017
01:36:35,128 --> 01:36:37,231
Come on.

1018
01:36:37,364 --> 01:36:40,767
Breathe. Breathe.

1019
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:44,972
There you go!

1020
01:36:45,072 --> 01:36:47,774
She's breathing.
I think she's gonna be okay.

1021
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:49,810
Can you hear me?

1022
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:53,780
I think she's
gonna make it.
Good. Good.

1023
01:36:53,881 --> 01:36:58,418
You gotta find the clues
that he left for us, Amelia.

1024
01:36:58,552 --> 01:37:02,990
See what you can find
around the fuel tanks.
All right.

1025
01:37:26,413 --> 01:37:28,949
Lincoln, I found it.

1026
01:37:29,082 --> 01:37:31,385
It'sa map of some kind,

1027
01:37:31,485 --> 01:37:36,156
some chunk of a clean bone
and a piece of a metal
ora badge.

1028
01:37:38,592 --> 01:37:41,295
There are
some initials engraved.
It looks like a...

1029
01:37:41,428 --> 01:37:44,965
a "P" and a "B," or a...

1030
01:37:45,098 --> 01:37:47,801
It'sa "D."
It's definitely a "D."

1031
01:37:47,935 --> 01:37:50,737
P-D. It sounds
like a cop's badge.

1032
01:37:50,838 --> 01:37:53,540
You think
he's gonna kill a cop?

1033
01:37:53,674 --> 01:37:56,410
Could be.

1034
01:37:57,678 --> 01:37:59,580
Thelma.
Maps?

1035
01:38:01,281 --> 01:38:03,250
Tell me about the map.

1036
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:05,819
Looks like
an old subway map.

1037
01:38:05,953 --> 01:38:08,822
I don't recognize
any of the stations.

1038
01:38:10,324 --> 01:38:13,126
When I was scanning
those asbestos sites,
I came across...

1039
01:38:13,227 --> 01:38:16,063
a lot of stations
that aren't in use anymore.

1040
01:38:16,163 --> 01:38:19,066
Okay, there it is,
the oldest station.

1041
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:24,104
On your map, is there
an old station indicated
at the tip of Manhattan?

1042
01:38:26,573 --> 01:38:30,611
- Navy Street.
- It's right next to the pier.

1043
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:34,147
Oh, shit.
Cheney's here.

1044
01:38:39,319 --> 01:38:42,256
You talking to Rhyme
on that thing?
Give me the radio!

1045
01:38:44,024 --> 01:38:47,594
Yeah, listen, Linc.
This is Cheney, man.
What the hell you doin'?

1046
01:38:47,728 --> 01:38:50,631
Stealing evidence
is a goddamn felony.
You know that.

1047
01:38:50,731 --> 01:38:53,433
To my understanding,
there's no chain
of evidence voucher.

1048
01:38:53,567 --> 01:38:58,105
Yeah? I got news for you.
You are not a cop anymore.
You understand that?

1049
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:01,141
What you are is
a fucking meddling cripple.

1050
01:39:01,241 --> 01:39:04,211
I'm going to place
your gofer here under arrest.

1051
01:39:04,344 --> 01:39:07,114
You don't mind that,
do ya?

1052
01:39:07,214 --> 01:39:09,616
Lock her up!

1053
01:39:10,717 --> 01:39:12,786
Where'd she go?

1054
01:39:37,477 --> 01:39:39,680
I'm inside
the NavyStreet tunnel.

1055
01:39:39,813 --> 01:39:42,683
There'sgreydust everywhere.
It'sallovermyshoes.

1056
01:39:48,889 --> 01:39:52,426
There'sfootprints,
oneset offootprints.

1057
01:39:52,559 --> 01:39:55,662
Hello, Lincoln.
Hello?

1058
01:39:55,796 --> 01:39:58,265
Amelia? Hello?

1059
01:39:58,398 --> 01:40:00,601
The mobile unit you've called
is not responding,

1060
01:40:00,734 --> 01:40:03,203
or is outside
the coverage area.
Recall.

1061
01:40:06,306 --> 01:40:08,342
God.

1062
01:41:04,231 --> 01:41:07,267
No dust.
He changed the numbers.

1063
01:41:08,502 --> 01:41:11,205
7-8-4-9-9.
What is it?

1064
01:41:11,338 --> 01:41:13,774
7-8-4-9-9.

1065
01:41:15,175 --> 01:41:17,277
What does it mean?

1066
01:41:17,411 --> 01:41:20,547
What does it mean?
7-8-4-9-9.

1067
01:41:25,185 --> 01:41:27,187
7...

1068
01:41:27,321 --> 01:41:29,857
8-4... 9-9.

1069
01:41:36,997 --> 01:41:39,433
Help me, Rhyme.
Help me.

1070
01:41:54,948 --> 01:41:57,818
He's gonna kill Rhyme.

1071
01:42:20,274 --> 01:42:22,209
Coming.

1072
01:42:27,281 --> 01:42:30,317
Hey. What are you
doing here?

1073
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:52,372
Thelma?

1074
01:42:52,472 --> 01:42:54,942
Is that Amelia?

1075
01:42:57,811 --> 01:42:59,713
Bed mode.

1076
01:43:06,987 --> 01:43:10,390
Thelma?

1077
01:43:17,531 --> 01:43:20,834
Thelma, is that you?

1078
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:30,210
No, it's me... Richard.

1079
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:33,013
Richard. What's up?

1080
01:43:33,146 --> 01:43:37,317
Thelma asked me to come by,
check the heart pacing machine.

1081
01:43:40,354 --> 01:43:42,990
Oh.

1082
01:43:45,826 --> 01:43:49,630
Uh... where is Thelma?

1083
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:52,199
Out in the hall.

1084
01:44:09,516 --> 01:44:12,052
Phone mode.

1085
01:44:20,494 --> 01:44:24,464
I thought it was time we had
a little quiet moment together,
you and I,

1086
01:44:24,598 --> 01:44:26,500
no interruptions.

1087
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:29,503
Okay. What's on
your mind, Richard?

1088
01:44:29,603 --> 01:44:33,140
I think it's time to set
the record straight,
Mr. Rhyme.

1089
01:44:33,273 --> 01:44:35,876
Syracuse.

1090
01:44:36,009 --> 01:44:38,478
You remember Syracuse,
don't you?

1091
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:41,248
You wrote
an expert opinion.

1092
01:44:41,381 --> 01:44:43,383
I've written thousands
of opinions, Richard.

1093
01:44:43,517 --> 01:44:46,720
Don't fucking tell me
you don't remember Syracuse.

1094
01:44:46,854 --> 01:44:50,190
They called it an investigation.
It was a witch-hunt.

1095
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:54,728
There was a forensics cop
up in Syracuse, New York...

1096
01:44:54,862 --> 01:44:56,897
Marcus Andrews.

1097
01:44:57,030 --> 01:45:00,000
Okay, yeah, that was
the cop that was...

1098
01:45:00,133 --> 01:45:03,470
suspected of tampering
with evidence in some
homicide cases, right?

1099
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:06,940
- Nothing was tampered with.
- Six innocent people went
to jail; one hung himself.

1100
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:10,677
No, no, no. They went
to jail because they were
guilty, they were scum.

1101
01:45:10,811 --> 01:45:12,713
He doctored
the serology reports.

1102
01:45:12,813 --> 01:45:16,116
No, nothing was doctored.
He planted blood evidence
at the crime scenes.

1103
01:45:16,216 --> 01:45:18,819
My work was impeccable.

1104
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:23,690
Where we going with this...

1105
01:45:23,824 --> 01:45:25,792
Marcus?

1106
01:45:29,963 --> 01:45:32,199
Your report
destroyed my life.

1107
01:45:32,332 --> 01:45:34,535
You know my report
was not a legal finding.

1108
01:45:34,668 --> 01:45:38,138
- You never gave me the
opportunity to defend myself.
- I never even met you.

1109
01:45:38,272 --> 01:45:40,841
I was sent to prison
for six years.

1110
01:45:40,974 --> 01:45:43,744
I spent two more years
trying to get to you.

1111
01:45:43,877 --> 01:45:46,446
Do you know what happens
to a cop in jail?

1112
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:50,083
Every day,
every single day,

1113
01:45:50,217 --> 01:45:53,187
over and over,
I was brutalized.

1114
01:45:53,287 --> 01:45:56,590
I became a human toilet,
because of your expert opinion.

1115
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:59,593
Well, you will never point
the finger of blame
at anyone ever again.

1116
01:45:59,593 --> 01:46:00,661
Well, you will never point
the finger of blame
at anyone ever again.

1117
01:46:03,997 --> 01:46:07,167
You were never as good
as they said you were.
I played you.

1118
01:46:07,301 --> 01:46:10,437
I tested you.
I gave you every clue.

1119
01:46:10,571 --> 01:46:13,040
You and your little helper
couldn't save those people.

1120
01:46:13,173 --> 01:46:15,409
Their blood is on your hands.
You failed.

1121
01:46:15,542 --> 01:46:17,444
You failed, you fuck.

1122
01:46:17,544 --> 01:46:21,248
Game ofchess, Mr. Rhyme.
Some people win,
some people lose.

1123
01:46:21,381 --> 01:46:24,151
I win, Mr. Rhyme.
I win, you lose.

1124
01:46:27,554 --> 01:46:32,159
What kind of vegetable
would you like to be,
Mr. Rhyme? A carrot?

1125
01:46:35,395 --> 01:46:37,798
How about a zucchini?

1126
01:46:38,999 --> 01:46:41,201
Zucchini?

1127
01:46:41,335 --> 01:46:44,271
- You want to be a zucchini?
- Thelma!

1128
01:46:44,371 --> 01:46:48,475
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you.
Did you say zucchini?

1129
01:47:26,213 --> 01:47:28,715
You want toplay?

1130
01:47:40,093 --> 01:47:43,063
Shall we cut out
your tongue, Mr. Rhyme?

1131
01:47:44,598 --> 01:47:47,000
How about your eye?
Your eye.

1132
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:51,071
I'll just pop it
right out of there.
No, let's leave that for now...

1133
01:47:51,205 --> 01:47:53,106
so you can watch me.

1134
01:47:53,207 --> 01:47:57,611
You can watch me
while I gut you open
right down the middle.

1135
01:48:01,148 --> 01:48:03,317
What?

1136
01:48:06,854 --> 01:48:09,356
What?

1137
01:48:09,489 --> 01:48:11,458
What?

1138
01:48:41,989 --> 01:48:44,024
Lincoln?

1139
01:48:44,157 --> 01:48:47,361
Lincoln.
Can you hear me?

1140
01:48:47,494 --> 01:48:49,396
Lincoln.

1141
01:48:49,496 --> 01:48:52,065
Oh, God.

1142
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,370
Two more in here.
Step aside, ma'am.

1143
01:49:49,556 --> 01:49:53,460
I've always loved
this view.
I like it, too, Doc.

1144
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:57,331
It's looking better
every day.

1145
01:49:57,431 --> 01:49:59,333
Hey, how you guys doin'?

1146
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:01,335
Good.

1147
01:50:01,435 --> 01:50:04,404
Ho-ho, ho, ho, ho-ho!

1148
01:50:04,538 --> 01:50:06,740
Ho-ho, ho, ho-ho!

1149
01:50:06,874 --> 01:50:09,476
Hey, Linc!
You got an operating
license for that?

1150
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:12,012
I got a learner's permit.

1151
01:50:12,112 --> 01:50:14,081
Mami, mira Lincoln.
Feliz Navidad.

1152
01:50:14,181 --> 01:50:15,883
¤ Cómo estás?

1153
01:50:16,016 --> 01:50:18,352
Mira.

1154
01:50:18,452 --> 01:50:21,154
How's your boyfriend
Morris?
He's in Florida.

1155
01:50:21,288 --> 01:50:23,323
He play golf.
Playing golf?

1156
01:50:23,457 --> 01:50:25,459
Captain Flash
on wheels.
Yo, Paulie.

1157
01:50:25,592 --> 01:50:27,628
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1158
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:31,298
Linc, ifyou gonna be cruisin',

1159
01:50:31,431 --> 01:50:33,934
There you go.
Thankyou, Eddie.

1160
01:50:34,067 --> 01:50:36,370
It's nice.
Que bonito.

1161
01:50:37,905 --> 01:50:39,806
Hey.
Come on in.

1162
01:50:39,907 --> 01:50:42,109
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1163
01:50:42,242 --> 01:50:45,312
Merry Christmas.
Howyou doin'?

1164
01:50:45,445 --> 01:50:48,515
You're looking
real good, Mr. Rhyme.
"Mr. Rhyme"?

1165
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:52,085
It's Lincoln to you.
Loosen your shorts.

1166
01:50:54,755 --> 01:50:57,090
Oh, my goodness!

1167
01:50:57,191 --> 01:51:00,160
Oh, my goodness!
Merry Christmas.
What are you doing here?

1168
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:03,263
Merry Christmas,
Uncle Linc.
Oh, give me a kiss.

1169
01:51:03,397 --> 01:51:05,933
Merry Christmas, Kimmy.
How are you?

1170
01:51:06,066 --> 01:51:09,837
How you doin', Tony?
My goodness, I didn't know
you were gonna make this trip.

1171
01:51:09,937 --> 01:51:12,472
Wouldn't be a surprise
if you knew.

1172
01:51:12,606 --> 01:51:14,975
I'm sorry.
Amelia, this is my sister
Janine, her family.

1173
01:51:15,075 --> 01:51:17,611
Amelia.
Yeah, I know. Hi.

1174
01:51:17,744 --> 01:51:20,314
You know?
We've met.

1175
01:51:20,447 --> 01:51:23,350
On the phone.
How you doin'?

1176
01:51:26,019 --> 01:51:28,755
Merry Christmas, Lincoln.

1177

Merry Christmas.
