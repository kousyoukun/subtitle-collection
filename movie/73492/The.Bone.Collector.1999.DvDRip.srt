1
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,760 
How's it look?

2
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,960 
The cop's body's about 300 yards
down in an abandoned tunnel.

3
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,400 
-Howie?
-Right behind you, captain.

4
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,360 
Keep back till
I process the scene, okay?

5
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,640 
Watch out! It's falling!

6
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,360 
So where the hell is the car?

7
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,760 
I don't know.

8
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,200 
That's the last time
I take a goddamn redeye.

9
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400 
We can take a cab.

10
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,040 
I'm gonna fire this son of a bitch.
He's always got some excuse.

11
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,960 
Well, come on.
We'll be home before you know it.

12
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,720 
Excuse me?

13
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,400 
I think you're going the wrong way.

14
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,960 
Excuse me.

15
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,560 
Honey, wake up.

16
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,960 
We're lost
or he's taking us for a ride.

17
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,760 
We're in the middle of nowhere.

18
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,200 
Where you going?
I said fifth Avenue.

19
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,760 
We're not tourists here, man!

20
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240 
Hey, where are you going?

21
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760 
Let us out. Stop the car!

22
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240 
Stop this car!

23
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,160 
Shit!

24
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,800 
Oh, my God.

25
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,480 
Son of a bitch!

26
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840 
Stop the goddamn car!

27
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,480 
-Please!
-Stop the car!

28
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,600 
Stop this car, goddamn it!

29
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,080 
Stop this car!

30
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,760 
Good morning.

31
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,800 
You're looking a little dehydrated.
How about some juice?

32
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,000 
How about two fingers of vodka?

33
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,600 
A little early for vodka,
don't you think?

34
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,120 
Time, as you know,
is a relative consideration.

35
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,400 
-Juice.
-Vodka.

36
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,360 
-Juice.
-Vodka.

37
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,320 
-Coming!
-Join me in a drink, Richard?

38
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,880 
I'd love to. But a med-tech
with liquor breath? I think not.

39
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360 
Thanks.

40
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,600 
So how are you?

41
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,200 
I'm better than
your heart-pacing gear.

42
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,960 
Every time, it's skewed further
out of spec. You need a new unit.

43
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,880 
I really need a new body.

44
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,600 
I can't help you with that,
but I'll bring a new unit by tomorrow.

45
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,400 
This'll be stable till then.

46
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,440 
-Thank you.
-You take it easy.

47
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,960 
I'll take it any way I can get it.

48
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,160 
-How's he doing?
-He asked for a vodka again.

49
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,360 
-Did you give him any?
-No.

50
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,360 
-Good morning, doctor.
-Hi, Richard.

51
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,760 
Hey, would you look at this?

52
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240 
A peregrine falcon, right?

53
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,960 
He likes cripples.

54
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,760 
There was a piece about them in
the Times nesting all over the city.

55
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,560 
Something about the architecture
of these old New York buildings.

56
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800 
I thought he liked my company.

57
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,200 
They're a little shy.
Don't take it personally.

58
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,560 
Can I get you a drink?

59
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,120 
No, thanks. I'm fine.

60
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,560 
Bed mode.

61
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,680 
-Got vodka in there?
-No.

62
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,080 
And you ain't getting any either.

63
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,160 
All right, I'll let you guys talk.

64
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,360 
So you can imagine how much sleep
I've gotten the past few days...

65
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,360 
...considering your request.

66
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,680 
Since I made my decision,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

67
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,560 
After all you have survived,
beat all the odds...

68
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,120 
...you know there's work
on nerve regeneration every day.

69
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,960 
One finger, two shoulders and a brain.
That's all I have, Barry.

70
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,760 
These dysreflexia seizures
are occurring more often.

71
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,840 
The buildup of fluid in my spine
is a degenerative condition.

72
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,640 
We know I'm waiting for the seizure
that'll make me a vegetable.

73
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,360 
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Barry.

74
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,840 
I want to make the final transition
on my own terms.

75
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,760 
I'll get it done with or without you.

76
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,160 
Yeah, I suppose you would.

77
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,960 
So?

78
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,920 
-Okay.
-Okay what?

79
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,040 
Okay, I'll assist you...

80
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000 
-...in your transition.
-Today?

81
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,640 
There are preparations to be made.
This is not a flu shot.

82
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,080 
My business is in order.
Bags are packed.

83
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,800 
Besides, I've got
a medical conference to go to.

84
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,480 
I've got a plane to catch.

85
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,160 
You're lying.

86
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,400 
When do you get back?

87
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,080 
Sunday.

88
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,400 
Sunday.

89
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,680 
I'll see you then.

90
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360 
Get out before you change your mind.

91
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040 
Don't get up. I'll show myself out.

92
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,400 
Yeah, I'll race you to the door.

93
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960 
Barry....

94
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,800 
You are...

95
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,160 
...a very good friend.

96
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720 
Amelia?

97
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,320 
Morning.

98
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,640 
You okay?

99
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,760 
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just couldn't sleep.

100
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,960 
-What time is it?
-It's early.

101
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,800 
I'll be late. I gotta shower.

102
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,600 
No, you don't. Stay here.

103
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,600 
I gotta go.

104
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,800 
Make breakfast?

105
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,560 
No, thanks. I'm gonna be late.

106
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,560 
Another slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am?

107
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,760 
All right, look....

108
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,000 
My therapist tells me...

109
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,000 
...l don't get what I need
out of this relationship.

110
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,680 
What are we doing here?

111
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,600 
I think you and me,
we make a great couple.

112
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320 
You know where I stand on this.

113
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,840 
You know what I want.

114
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,160 
Steve, we've been through this.

115
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,960 
All right? I care about you.

116
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,360 
I can't make a commitment.

117
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,360 
Well, go to work then.

118
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,160 
You're gonna be late.

119
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,080 
-You're quitting the cops?
-I'm transferring to Youth Services.

120
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,160 
Lucky fuck. You must
have one hell of a rabbi.

121
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,760 
-We're gonna miss you.
-3-post-11 here.

122
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,800 
Frightened child at Amtrak site.

123
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,280 
I'll take it.

124
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,800 
Kid found something
over at the tracks.

125
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,960 
-finish eating. I'll check it out.
-See you, kid.

126
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,360 
3-post-11,
anything further on that 10-10?

127
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,960 
Nothing yet.

128
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,600 
Wait. I think I see him.

129
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,360 
Are you the one
who called the police?

130
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,960 
Wait there, okay?

131
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,440 
Are you crazy?

132
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,400 
Just shut off the engine.

133
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,560 
There's been a homicide.
I can't let you through.

134
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,800 
What's your name?

135
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,040 
Chris.

136
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,960 
I got a job for you.

137
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,320 
Here's money.

138
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,960 
I need you to buy me one of
those cheapo cardboard cameras.

139
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,280 
You know, the ones you can throw away?

140
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,040 
fast as you can.

141
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,040 
3-post-11 to Central.

142
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,760 
Captain Cheney, Detective Solomon.

143
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,880 
first officer on the scene
is over there.

144
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,160 
--on the tracks near the body.

145
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,960 
I collected it
before it was washed away.

146
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,360 
-I also took some pictures.
-Thanks.

147
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,520 
You stopped the train?

148
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,160 
It might have disturbed
the physical evidence.

149
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,160 
Why not shut down Grand Central
while you're at it?

150
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,280 
Patrolman Donahue. Is that right?

151
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,560 
Donaghy.

152
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,760 
A rookie, I take it.

153
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,760 
No, sir.

154
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,760 
Pretty dumb.

155
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,680 
Captain...

156
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,360 
...guess who the vic is?

157
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,560 
-Talk to me.
-Alan fucking Rubin.

158
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,160 
Mister " Rebuild New York" himself?

159
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,160 
No one enters this area
except for my crime scene guys.

160
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440 
Knight to h6. Check.

161
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,920 
You got company. Cops.

162
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,000 
-Tell them I'm busy.
-They said it was urgent.

163
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,440 
Tell them I'm out running.

164
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,000 
She's too polite for that, Linc.

165
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,760 
Hey, look who's here!

166
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,160 
I caught a serious situation.

167
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,080 
It's going around, Paulie.

168
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,280 
Chief Murphy sent me.

169
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,720 
The good chief.

170
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,440 
Heard about that couple at the airport?
Got in a taxi, never got home?

171
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,280 
He don't watch the news.

172
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,880 
You used to read four papers a day
and tape the news shows.

173
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,760 
Yeah, now I just hit
the rewind button. A3.

174
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,280 
Things never change.

175
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,240 
That was Alan Rubin
and his wife in that taxi.

176
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,400 
They found him dead,
buried, shot in the face...

177
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,440 
...hand sticking out of the ground
with his wife's ring on his finger...

178
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240 
...which was skinned to the bone.

179
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,120 
She's still missing.

180
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000 
Excuse me while you catch up.

181
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,400 
Don't go too far.

182
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,960 
We'll be letting these nice
gentlemen out in 30 seconds.

183
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400 
Sounds like you got yourself
an open-and-shut there.

184
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,040 
I don't think so.

185
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,920 
A man worth several hundred
million found dead...

186
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360 
...his wife's ring
on his mutilated hand.

187
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,560 
What's that tell you?

188
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,480 
The doer is saying he's got her.

189
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,520 
He's probably making
a ransom demand right now.

190
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,840 
-I'd have been paged.
-Check your batteries.

191
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,160 
It's definitely a ransom.

192
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,560 
Excuse me, Mr. Rhyme.
Kenneth Solomon.

193
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,760 
I've read all your books. Scene of
the Crime, at least a dozen times.

194
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,680 
It's great to meet you.

195
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,880 
-Where do you find these guys?
-They wanna work with the best.

196
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,640 
I guess now you're gonna ask me
to discuss the crime scene with you.

197
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,000 
We got a bunch of physical evidence
that doesn't exactly make sense.

198
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,440 
Some seriously weird stuff.
It's all in the report.

199
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,480 
Thelma?

200
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,720 
You okay?

201
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,880 
-Linc, you okay?
-Out! Now!

202
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,280 
-Anything we can do?
-Asses out of here now!

203
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,440 
Let me get you some air.
Come on. Breathe for me.

204
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,520 
I said out!

205
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,440 
Come on. Deep breaths.
Deep breaths. Come on.

206
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880 
Deep breaths.
I'm getting a BP on you.

207
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,240 
You gotta breathe.

208
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,400 
Look at me. Breathe.

209
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,200 
Look at me. Deep breaths.
Come on. Come on.

210
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,560 
You gotta take this oxygen.

211
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,960 
Stay with me.

212
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,600 
Come on. You can do it.
Don't go out on me now.

213
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,560 
Come on. Look at me.

214
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,040 
-Thelma?
-You okay?

215
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,400 
I would be if your powers
of resuscitation were less adept.

216
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,720 
Look, not on my shift, all right?

217
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,320 
If you have a problem,
you can fire my ass.

218
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,680 
I provide for you in my will.
You ought to keep that in mind.

219
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,520 
Rhyme, I'm not interested in
having this conversation. Okay?

220
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,480 
The crime scene report
Sellitto left....

221
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,760 
Could you take the photos
and load them in the viewer?

222
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,360 
View scan.

223
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,160 
Let's take a look at what we got here.

224
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,000 
Where it says location....

225
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,400 
Now what's that--?
What's it say about that newspaper?

226
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,800 
" Newspaper found beneath
a coarse-thread hex bolt...

227
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,400 
...with 4 p.m. circled on it."

228
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,520 
Zoom.

229
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160 
Zoom.

230
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,520 
What about that piece of paper?
What's the number on there?

231
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,080 
"A torn book page with 119 on it."

232
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,880 
119, 4 p.m.

233
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,000 
119, 4 p.m.

234
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,840 
11-9. What's today's date?

235
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,080 
Today's November 9.

236
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,680 
Phone mode.

237
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,080 
Sellitto, Paulie. Call.

238
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,600 
What?

239
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,400 
Sad fact is, a huge percentage
of inner-city kids...

240
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,800 
...have their
first drug experiences...

241
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,360 
...at the fifth grade level.

242
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,640 
Here are some of the drugs
they'll be offered.

243
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,000 
Marijuana.

244
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,360 
How'd you like to get your hands
on that briefcase?

245
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,000 
Barbiturates.

246
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,640 
Amphetamines.

247
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,760 
Cocaine.

248
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,400 
Rock cocaine.

249
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,760 
-What's this about?
-You know who Lincoln Rhyme is?

250
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,160 
-What? The textbook guy?
-Yeah.

251
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,760 
-So what does that have to do with me?
-You'll find out.

252
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,080 
Come on in. They're in there.

253
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,560 
A patrol cop took these pictures?

254
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,560 
Yeah, first one on the scene.
It started to rain.

255
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,680 
Smart cop.

256
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,360 
Had the balls to stop an Amtrak
from running over the crime scene.

257
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,600 
Here she is now.
Officer Donahoe...

258
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,560 
...meet Lincoln Rhyme.

259
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,960 
Donaghy.

260
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,840 
You took terrific photographs.

261
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,960 
You know who I am?

262
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,680 
I read your manual at the academy.

263
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,680 
What'd you think?

264
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,960 
I'm not a book critic.

265
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,920 
You found it useful?

266
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,600 
I guess so.

267
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,120 
Sure you did.
You stopped that train.

268
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,360 
The photos you took.

269
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,200 
I'd say you have
a natural instinct for forensics.

270
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,760 
So what do we got, Paulie?

271
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,480 
We have footprints, size 10,
thanks to Officer Donaghy...

272
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,000 
...using a dollar bill
to establish scale.

273
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,800 
We have asbestos
where there shouldn't be any.

274
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,320 
An iron bolt holding down
a piece of paper...

275
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,400 
...a book page
with 119 written on it.

276
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,440 
Decaying oxidation on the bolt...

277
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,440 
...but none on the thread.
Someone removed it...

278
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,000 
...from somewhere else...

279
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,360 
...and placed it there recently.
Wouldn't you agree, officer?

280
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,160 
Wouldn't you agree, Officer Donaghy?

281
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,880 
Paulie, I'm convinced
this crime scene was staged.

282
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,640 
-Perp's telling us something.
-What?

283
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,600 
Book, page 119. 11-9.
That's today's date.

284
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,080 
Newspaper, 4 p.m.
What time you got?

285
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,200 
12:15.

286
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,880 
She's alive.

287
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,280 
-And he's gonna kill her at 4?
-P.M.

288
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,200 
We have your interest yet?

289
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,960 
I want you to work the case with us.

290
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,680 
It's not my area.

291
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,720 
Are you being modest, or are you...

292
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,360 
...uneasy about doing
some real police work?

293
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,960 
Excuse me?

294
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,120 
What department do you work in?

295
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,160 
Youth Services.
I picked her up at orientation.

296
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,080 
I see. Youth Services.

297
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,160 
I wait-listed a year,
and I won't jeopardize--

298
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,960 
Jeopardize what?

299
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,400 
Cushy desk job?

300
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,360 
-forensics is not my area.
-I disagree with you.

301
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,360 
You can't force me
to take this assignment.

302
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,760 
I can.

303
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760 
And if I refuse?

304
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,040 
You're putting your career at risk.

305
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,200 
You think because of your condition
you can push people around?

306
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,280 
That is truly pathetic.

307
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,280 
Truly?

308
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,400 
Yeah, damn right. Truly.

309
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,360 
Well, forgive me truly...

310
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,960 
...if I insist on having
someone with your brains...

311
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,960 
...and a fresh pair of eyes.
There's a life at stake here, officer.

312
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,240 
We'll need key people
and tech support.

313
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,160 
I know the guys.

314
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,960 
What the hell you smiling at?

315
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,120 
Pull up a chair.

316
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,360 
Tell me everything you know
about the crime scene.

317
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,160 
It's in my report.

318
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,360 
I read your report.
I want to know what you felt...

319
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,160 
...what you feel...

320
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,280 
...in the deepest recesses
of your senses.

321
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,760 
You are in love with the sound
of your voice, aren't you?

322
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,120 
It's your voice I want to hear.
Sit down. I won't bite.

323
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,280 
The rifling on the .38 slug
they dug out of the victim...

324
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,000 
...is consistent with a Webley,
an old, turn-of-the-century handgun.

325
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,040 
On the big board, please.
What about that bolt?

326
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,360 
There's three initials
on the head: N.S.G.

327
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,800 
And the bolt's not steel. It's iron.

328
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,160 
Iron.

329
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,360 
Iron. Iron. Making it old...

330
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,000 
...like the Webley.

331
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,960 
Officer Donaghy,
what do you know about asbestos?

332
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,200 
It kills Americans every day.

333
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,520 
Very good.

334
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,640 
-You computer literate?
-A little.

335
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,160 
Thelma!

336
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,960 
Thelma? Where's my Thelma?

337
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,560 
Thelma, meet Amelia.
Amelia, Thelma.

338
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,920 
Amelia hates my books
and computers...

339
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520 
...but she's got an A-plus nose
for evidence...

340
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,680 
...so show her how to
access D.E.P. files.

341
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,200 
See if there's any large asbestos
cleanups going on in the city.

342
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,400 
ASAP.

343
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,920 
-Where is Eddie Ortiz?
-Right here!

344
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,840 
How's the world's
crankiest criminalist?

345
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,440 
Playing " beat the clock."

346
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,160 
Everybody's worst nightmare.

347
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,760 
Get in a cab, and there's a psycho
from Jersey behind the wheel.

348
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,680 
We don't know he's from Jersey.

349
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,800 
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.

350
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,120 
You bring the whole lab?

351
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,400 
-Mom always told me to be prepared.
-Where do you want this?

352
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,280 
Put it over here in the corner.
How is your mother?

353
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,400 
She's 76, and she's shtupping a guy
named Morris. Can you believe that?

354
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,920 
God bless her.

355
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,160 
But it's Morris I'm worried about.

356
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,200 
He's 79 with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.

357
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,040 
-Afternoon. Captain Cheney.
-Amelia...

358
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,960 
...what about that asbestos?

359
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,560 
There's a dozen cleanups
in the five boroughs.

360
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,400 
Put it up on the viewer for me.

361
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,200 
Narrow it down
to the oldest locations.

362
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,760 
How you doing, Howie?

363
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,360 
fine. How's it going?

364
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,960 
In the middle of the middle,
as you can see.

365
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,640 
Look what I found on
the threading of that iron bolt.

366
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,640 
I was hoping to grab a minute
if you don't mind.

367
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720 
Excuse me.

368
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,360 
Sorry. Sorry.

369
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,720 
We got Donaghy to thank for
photographing the crucial evidence.

370
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,520 
Crucial evidence?

371
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,440 
We don't know that. I wanted to make
sure you had the support you need.

372
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,880 
I'm putting the full resources of
my department here at your disposal.

373
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,200 
I appreciate it. Thank you.

374
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,160 
But the thing is, Linc...

375
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,600 
...l've formalized procedures
since you were in charge, and so--

376
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,280 
Put what you got up
on my screen, please.

377
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,760 
So I'd appreciate it
if you kept me in the loop.

378
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,880 
Absolutely.

379
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,200 
At all times.

380
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,960 
At all--

381
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,560 
What the hell is that
we're looking at?

382
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,160 
Old paper.

383
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,040 
Coarse grade.

384
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,840 
I'd say...

385
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,760 
...80, 90 years old.

386
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,560 
Turn-of-the-century, it looks like.

387
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,120 
The perp likes old.

388
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,760 
fine, then....

389
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,000 
I'll be in my office if you need me.

390
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,640 
Yeah, okay, Howie.

391
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,360 
Good.

392
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,440 
Old paper.

393
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,680 
Old gun.

394
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,320 
Buries his victim in a vintage
Civil War railroad bed.

395
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,560 
Sand.

396
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,120 
Sand. Sand....
Eddie, what do you got on the sand?

397
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,160 
Doesn't really look like sand.

398
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,560 
-I'm not sure.
-Can you individuate it?

399
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,280 
If I had an EDX, I could.

400
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,000 
We don't have
a goddamn E-the-fuck-X.

401
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,920 
Look who forgot their chill pill
this morning. Excuse me.

402
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,960 
Come on. I'm all over this thing now.

403
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,760 
Okay, we're talking...

404
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,840 
...pearly-looking.

405
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,360 
Some kind of a...

406
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,960 
...shellfish or something.

407
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,640 
Oyster shells, maybe?

408
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,040 
Could be.

409
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,760 
Definitely. If I had to bet on it,
I'd say it was. Sure.

410
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,760 
I got it. The oldest asbestos
sites are coming up now.

411
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,880 
In 1913, when the Woolworth Building
was being built...

412
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,360 
...workmen found the body of
a rich industrialist, Talbot Soames.

413
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,880 
He'd been kidnapped, shot and buried
in what they thought was sand.

414
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,600 
Turned out to be oyster shells.
Crushed oyster shells.

415
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,800 
That's what they used as
landfill in lower Manhattan.

416
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,920 
That's how Pearl Street got its name.
That's where Mrs. Rubin will be.

417
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320 
She'll be underground.

418
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,760 
She'll be in a basement...

419
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,320 
...near or in the Woolworth Building.

420
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,640 
Have Emergency Services Unit
meet us by the Woolworth Building.

421
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,320 
Tell them to start their search.
We may get lucky.

422
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,560 
Eddie, did you bring your van?

423
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,520 
-It's downstairs.
-We'll need it.

424
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,600 
Throw your keys to Amelia.
You guys go with her.

425
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,840 
Should I go too?

426
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,240 
You stay here with me
and work that bolt.

427
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,600 
That's the missing piece.

428
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,400 
Should we keep Cheney in the loop?

429
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,680 
fuck him.

430
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,840 
fuck him.

431
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,440 
Amelia.

432
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,960 
Just trust me.

433
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,360 
Just follow those instincts
you were born with. I'll be with you...

434
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,680 
...every step of the way.

435
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,680 
Jesus, 25 minutes left.

436
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,960 
-How did Rhyme get that way?
-He was born brilliant. It happens.

437
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,560 
I mean, the physical part.

438
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,560 
four years ago, he was working
the body of a cop...

439
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,960 
...they'd found shot
in a subway tunnel.

440
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,360 
Beam came down
and damn near cut him in half.

441
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,960 
Jesus.

442
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,080 
family?

443
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,480 
Sister in Phoenix.

444
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,720 
He never sees her.
Cut himself off.

445
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,400 
Technically, he's still on
active duty collecting pay.

446
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,360 
Insurance picks up
24-hour care and the gadgets.

447
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,760 
On weekends, always one or two cops
there lending a hand.

448
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,600 
-Tough deal.
-You won't hear him complaining.

449
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,120 
He likes pushing
other people's buttons.

450
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,560 
In your case, that's a compliment.

451
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,760 
You gotta learn to relax around
a compliment, especially from Rhyme.

452
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,280 
-You can be a little grating.
-Me?

453
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,640 
Kiddo, if you were any more wound up,
you'd be a Timex.

454
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,560 
He was a human dynamo, writing books,
lecturing all over the world...

455
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,560 
...giving expert opinion in trials,
working crimes in the city.

456
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,200 
You know what he'd do for fun?

457
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,120 
No, I can't imagine.

458
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,160 
He'd collect things.
Dirt, metals, plastics...

459
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,360 
...hubcaps, plants, musical strings...

460
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,400 
...medical tools, anything.

461
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,760 
Obsessive.

462
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,760 
He'd analyse and catalogue it
for his, what you call it, database.

463
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,080 
Jesus Christ! I'd like to get there
in one piece if possible.

464
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,760 
-New York Security Gate Company.
-That's good. What else?

465
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000 
Nicholas Steven Gerard, elevators.

466
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,840 
-No, underground.
-A subway builder.

467
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,400 
-Subway builder sounds--
-Excuse me! N.S.G.

468
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,080 
" Niagara Steam Generation. Bought by
Eastern Gas and Electric in 1928.

469
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,240 
The six-inch iron bolt was used
mainly for steam pipe assemblies."

470
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,120 
You got 11 minutes.
Where are you?

471
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,880 
We just hit the financial district.

472
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,120 
There's a steam junction...

473
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,400 
...with big asbestos-coated pipes.

474
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,000 
That's where she'll be.
I'd bet my legs on it.

475
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,120 
She'll be at Wall and Nassau.

476
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,400 
-Wall and Nassau.
-Has ESU been notified?

477
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,840 
On their way.
They'll get there first.

478
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,000 
Steam is released through
that junction every day at 4 p.m.

479
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,760 
Shit, what's this asshole up to?

480
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,800 
I don't know, but it'll happen
in about 10 minutes.

481
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,120 
We're here.
We're going down there.

482
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,400 
Amelia?

483
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,720 
Yeah, I'm here.

484
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,360 
It's their job to save Mrs. Rubin.
It's yours to get ready...

485
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,960 
...and work the crime scene
if necessary.

486
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,000 
There's some things you'll need.
Look in the truck.

487
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,160 
You'll see an aluminum suitcase...

488
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,400 
...and a radio headset.

489
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400 
See it?

490
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,120 
Yeah, I see them.

491
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,960 
There must be a way in.

492
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,160 
-What's the problem here?
-fucking valves freeze up easy.

493
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,880 
Come on. Shut it off!

494
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,200 
You there?

495
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760 
I'm here.

496
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,360 
I'm inside the pipe.

497
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040 
Go!

498
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,000 
I think I hear something.

499
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,560 
I hear something!

500
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,040 
What's that? Someone's there.
I hear her crying!

501
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760 
Everyone, quiet now!

502
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,160 
Mrs. Rubin?

503
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,600 
Mrs. Rubin?

504
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,360 
She's there.

505
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,160 
Mrs. Rubin!

506
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,200 
We're on our way in now!

507
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,840 
Come on, guys. Come on.

508
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,480 
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's hurry the fuck up!

509
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,960 
Get a drill and a tap.

510
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,000 
Somebody cut this halfway through.

511
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,160 
There's no way to turn it off.

512
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120 
Back!

513
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,640 
Paulie?

514
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840 
Paulie?

515
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,880 
She's gone.

516
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,640 
The whole place is scalded in steam.

517
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,480 
Let's go! Move away!

518
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,560 
ESU are gonna blow a hole
in the subbasement wall.

519
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,560 
I understand I'm working
with Chief Murphy's authorization.

520
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,960 
That's right.

521
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,240 
I don't want Emergency Services guys
in there trampling the evidence...

522
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,920 
...before we run the scene.

523
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,040 
What do you want?

524
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,840 
When they blow the hole,
I want Donaghy in.

525
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,360 
She's not trained for this.
We could get our asses in a sling.

526
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,080 
My ass has been
in a sling for four years.

527
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,240 
Tell Hanson and his beasts
that's what I want.

528
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,560 
All right. You got it.

529
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,400 
Okay, let's move!

530
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,160 
I'm doing this under protest.
The perp could still be in there!

531
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,960 
Rhyme's in charge,
and they're his orders.

532
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,400 
You can't handle it in there,
get your ass out.

533
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,360 
Amelia, you ready?

534
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,760 
You listen to me.

535
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,360 
I'm with you every step of the way.

536
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,560 
Go on.

537
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,760 
Good luck.

538
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,160 
-I'm in.
-Tell me what you see.

539
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,360 
Everything's been boiled to hell.

540
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,560 
Oh, God.

541
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,160 
What is it?

542
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,160 
It's an awful smell.

543
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,440 
You're close.

544
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,000 
I can't believe I'm doing this.

545
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,520 
You're fine.

546
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,760 
Just fine. You're doing great.
Now, just remember the academy.

547
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,360 
When you walk...

548
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,000 
...move in a straight line. Don't
disturb any footprints he's left.

549
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,160 
Yeah, assuming he's gone.

550
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,960 
There's no footprints.

551
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,880 
There's nothing yet.

552
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,160 
Oh, God.

553
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,760 
What?

554
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,160 
Talk to me.

555
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,800 
Talk to me, Amelia.

556
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,160 
I can see her.

557
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,560 
The steam pipe was opened...

558
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,160 
...and she's tied down
right in front of it.

559
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,760 
There's nothing you can do.
You can't do anything but help her...

560
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,960 
...by working the crime scene.
That's your job.

561
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,160 
Open your suitcase.
Get your camera.

562
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,880 
I can't do this.

563
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,360 
You can do it. Yes, you can.

564
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,040 
Yesterday you stopped a train.
You can do anything you want.

565
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,760 
Don't work me, Rhyme.

566
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,200 
Just tell me what to do next.

567
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,200 
Very slowly, walk the grid...

568
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,160 
... one foot in front of the other.

569
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,760 
I want you to look around you now.

570
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,640 
Crime scenes are three-dimensional.
floors, walls and ceilings.

571
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,880 
Rhyme.

572
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,560 
Yeah, I'm here.

573
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,160 
There's something strange.

574
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,960 
Things he left for us?

575
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,560 
Yes.

576
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,120 
In a cluster again?

577
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,680 
A piece of wood...

578
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,200 
...and looks like some hair.

579
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,680 
I'll walk you through collecting
the evidence. Do exactly as I say.

580
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,160 
Oh, Jesus.

581
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,960 
Talk to me.

582
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,240 
-It's a bloody bone.
-Where is it?

583
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,160 
It's in my fucking hand.

584
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,960 
Human?

585
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,000 
I think so. Yeah.

586
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,880 
Photograph it.

587
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,760 
Bag it.

588
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,960 
Okay, that's it.

589
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,760 
I'm out of here.

590
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,080 
One more thing.

591
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,440 
We gotta process the body.

592
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,360 
What? I'm not a medical examiner.
I can't do that.

593
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,960 
It's not an autopsy.

594
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,960 
I just want you to....

595
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,480 
Just describe the restraints.

596
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,560 
They're strange-looking handcuffs.

597
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,560 
They look more like
old shackles or something.

598
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,200 
And there's a chain across her waist.

599
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,160 
And her feet are bound with a rope.

600
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,560 
Hands above her head?

601
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,960 
There's also a large
piece of flesh...

602
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,760 
...missing from her right forearm.

603
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,960 
It's right down to the bone.
It was surgically removed.

604
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,880 
This is what I want you to do.

605
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,680 
We're gonna need those handcuffs.

606
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,960 
It's probably our best chance
for good prints.

607
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,160 
The M.E. can remove them.

608
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,000 
M.E. is all thumbs.
They'll mess up the prints.

609
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,640 
Look in the suitcase.
There's a small saw.

610
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,560 
I want you to saw her hands off
at the wrist line.

611
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,560 
We gotta have those cuffs for prints.

612
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,960 
I can't.

613
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,840 
Cut her hands off.
We need the handcuffs.

614
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,520 
I can't. No.

615
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,560 
Saw off her hands.

616
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,360 
Take off the cuffs.

617
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,000 
I can't.

618
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,440 
Listen to me.
We need those cuffs.

619
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,640 
I can't!

620
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,160 
-Amelia, we need--
-No! fuck you!

621
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,520 
Amelia!

622
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,760 
Amelia!

623
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,600 
If he wants her hands cut off,
he can come and do it himself!

624
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,560 
That'll be $16.50.

625
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,760 
Who is it?

626
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,000 
Hey, take it easy!

627
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,520 
-Solomon, what are you doing?
-Are you okay?

628
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,600 
What the fuck are you doing?

629
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,360 
Rhyme's been trying
to call you for hours.

630
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,200 
Your phone's down.
He was concerned.

631
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,560 
My phone's fine.

632
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,480 
I don't need his concern.

633
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,560 
He needs you at his place right away.

634
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,960 
I don't work for Lincoln Rhyme.

635
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,440 
He thinks the evidence says
there's another vic in play.

636
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,160 
And he's laying that at my feet?

637
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,520 
Don't shoot the messenger.

638
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,360 
Did you just move in?

639
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,280 
Yeah, about a year ago.

640
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,760 
Really?

641
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,840 
You were a model.

642
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,520 
Yeah, when I was a kid.

643
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,360 
Kid model to street cop.

644
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,240 
There's a leap.

645
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,360 
for whatever it's worth...

646
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,160 
...l thought what you did today
was terrific.

647
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,640 
Hey, you guys, I'm out of here.

648
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,320 
I'll grab a cab.
I got a paper to finish.

649
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,960 
-I'm gonna hang.
-No problem.

650
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,840 
I'll be there in a minute.

651
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,840 
Can I finish that?

652
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,440 
Go for it.

653
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,840 
I'll see you outside.

654
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,320 
Taxi!

655
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,160 
That bone's definitely not human.

656
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,040 
-And the hair?
-Not human either.

657
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,640 
Well, what is it?

658
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,040 
I'm working as fast as I can.

659
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,240 
Glad to see you could join us.

660
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,840 
I got Cheney on the line.
He wants you to brief him.

661
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,040 
Tell him I'll call him back.

662
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,640 
Two things. first, you did
a hell of a job locating the evidence.

663
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,240 
There's no question the perp
knows forensics.

664
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,240 
Now, as for the other thing...

665
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,120 
...the victim's hands, well, maybe...

666
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,320 
...it was too much to handle.
forget it.

667
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,200 
Is that your version of an apology?

668
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,440 
An apology?

669
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,040 
Is that why you came over here?

670
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,400 
You really are a piece of work.

671
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,360 
Well, aren't we a pair?

672
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,640 
I think you're terrific.

673
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,440 
You got a hell of an arrest record.

674
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,440 
High marks from all your bosses.
Definite gold-shield potential.

675
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,160 
Why you wanna throw it away
to chase youth offenders?

676
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,640 
I have no need to explain
that to you.

677
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,240 
Come on, cop to cop.

678
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,960 
Cop to cop, let's just leave it
at personal reasons.

679
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,040 
Doesn't have anything to do
with your father, does it?

680
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,640 
You keep charging at walls.

681
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,920 
Stubbornness is something
we both share.

682
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,880 
They say we come into this world
with a preordained destiny.

683
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,000 
I don't believe it.

684
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,040 
Neither of my parents had
more than an eighth-grade education.

685
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,640 
Never read more than one book
between them, not one.

686
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,320 
I've read thousands.

687
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,040 
I've written a dozen.

688
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,240 
What's your point?

689
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,440 
My point is that destiny is
what you make it.

690
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,000 
What happened to your dad
won't necessarily happen to you.

691
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,840 
You're a great cop.
You'd make a terrific detective.

692
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,840 
It's a gift.

693
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,040 
Don't throw it away.

694
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,680 
Report from the Taxi Commission.

695
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,280 
An NYU student was abducted
last night.

696
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,560 
His girlfriend saw him
try to get out...

697
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,520 
...as the taxi driver
hit him with a flashlight.

698
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,440 
No description of the driver.

699
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,640 
Okay, everybody. This could be
our next victim.

700
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,840 
Did you get a deadline
off that evidence yet?

701
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,360 
Not yet.

702
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,840 
That's something I hoped
you'd help me with.

703
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,600 
Anyone for some osso buco?

704
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,280 
What?

705
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,640 
The bone we found
at the Wall Street scene.

706
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,080 
Veal shank.
Braised and overly salted to boot.

707
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,640 
A cow bone?

708
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,920 
I also found a piece
of that old paper...

709
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,960 
...embedded in the bone.

710
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,240 
Take a look.

711
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,760 
-What's going on?
-Do what you need to do quickly.

712
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,080 
The hair follicles,
they're not human.

713
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,960 
A rodent. Probably a rat.

714
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,680 
They were shaved off.

715
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,920 
We're looking for a rat that shaves.

716
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,920 
-I like that.
-I've known a few in my time.

717
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,080 
-How about you, Amelia?
-More than a few.

718
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,520 
He's consistent with underground,
that's for sure.

719
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,480 
What's he trying to say?
He's communicating in our language...

720
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,720 
...leaving clues,
forensic clues at that.

721
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,320 
Maybe it's a cop.

722
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,520 
Maybe.

723
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,080 
Maybe he's sharing the responsibility
of these murders.

724
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,160 
If we don't figure out the clues,
the blood's on our hands.

725
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,160 
If we can't find the victim, we're as
responsible for the murders as he is.

726
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,240 
What do you got
on that dirt from the wood?

727
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,160 
I don't have 100% individuated,
but it does appear nitrogen-rich.

728
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,760 
Ready to rock 'n' roll.

729
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,240 
Thanks for rushing.
I appreciate it.

730
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,480 
Thank you, Richard.

731
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,880 
Nitrogen-rich, explosive carbons.
Where do you find those in New York?

732
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,840 
Bomb sites.

733
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,520 
-Shooting ranges.
-Maybe an old fort or an armoury?

734
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,360 
Don't forget the shit factor.

735
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,680 
The what?

736
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,280 
Manure becomes a nitrate
when it's aged.

737
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,640 
That's true.

738
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,240 
Then you got cow bones, huh?

739
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,040 
Old cow bones. Old manure.
Turn-of-the-century.

740
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,080 
Cows, farms, pastures.

741
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,360 
Rats.

742
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,640 
Dead cows.

743
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,240 
Where do you find--?
ln stockyards.

744
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,640 
Look for slaughterhouses.

745
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,080 
Stockyards and slaughterhouses
from turn of the century.

746
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,280 
Check the Internet.

747
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:50,280 
I want tax records, sanitation records
and building-code inspections.

748
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,080 
Last 100 years. Okay?

749
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,840 
Man, your blood pressure is way up.

750
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,280 
-You're pushing it too hard.
-I understand.

751
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,840 
-What do we got on the stockyards?
-We're almost there.

752
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,440 
You okay?

753
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,840 
No, I'm not okay.

754
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,440 
I can't figure out this time line
or these shards of cardboard.

755
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,680 
We got three defunct stockyard sites.

756
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,440 
One on Lexington
and the Harlem River viaduct.

757
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,240 
Solomon, put the box down...

758
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,880 
...turn the viewer on and mark it down
as she calls them off.

759
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,240 
Your blood pressure will blow a gasket
if you don't slow down.

760
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,160 
My body has a mind of its own.
It doesn't listen to me.

761
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,760 
What else?

762
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,360 
There's another on the Hudson
up at 155th.

763
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,000 
Mark it down, Solomon.

764
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,840 
Your sats are going down.

765
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,080 
You saw him have a seizure.

766
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,080 
What else?

767
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,080 
There's one underground
at Greenwich and Houston.

768
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,160 
Mark it down.

769
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,040 
-Why don't you knock it off?
-I don't need to knock it off!

770
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,480 
What was the first one you mentioned?

771
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,920 
Lexington and
the Harlem River viaduct.

772
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,280 
When did it close?

773
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,440 
1910.

774
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,880 
Okay, what about...

775
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,480 
...Houston and Greenwich?

776
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,800 
1898.

777
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,400 
And Hudson and 155th
was closed in 1906.

778
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,440 
1906, 1898--

779
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,320 
All right, let's....
1898.

780
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,840 
Houston and Greenwich. Call
Emergency Services and tell them...

781
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,880 
...to meet us
at Houston and Greenwich.

782
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,320 
Solomon, you get on to Hanson.
He'll need about 20 guys.

783
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,840 
You go with them.

784
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,440 
Let's go.

785
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,720 
Linc, you there?

786
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,760 
Yeah, ready.

787
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,240 
We're here.

788
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,440 
All right. Same drill.
I want you in first.

789
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,840 
Let's do it.

790
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,440 
You watch yourself, Amelia.

791
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,000 
Oh, man. I don't like this.

792
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,440 
I don't like this.

793
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,520 
I got a bad feeling about this.

794
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,640 
All three of us ought to
get in there.

795
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,520 
Not yet. Just hold back.

796
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,000 
I'm going down some stairs.

797
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,240 
Cement walls.

798
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,240 
Wood crates.

799
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,240 
Large columns.

800
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,840 
Smells like manure down here.

801
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,200 
Ortiz sure knows his shit.

802
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,240 
Always has.

803
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,840 
Metal hooks...

804
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,280 
...and a pen.

805
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,240 
It's a slaughterhouse.

806
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,840 
ESU are here.

807
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,080 
Hold them off. Don't want them
contaminating the scene.

808
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,040 
All right, hold it.
Hold up. Hold up.

809
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,640 
-You're not to go in.
-Why?

810
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,000 
-Rhyme's orders.
-fuck him! Get me Cheney on the line.

811
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,400 
Crime scene C. O. on air.

812
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,640 
-Switch to channel 2-2 for ESU.
-fuck Rhyme.

813
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,440 
Maybe this one's still alive.

814
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,640 
Perp didn't leave a deadline.

815
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,240 
What does that mean?

816
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,280 
We're probably too late.

817
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,000 
You don't know that, Rhyme.

818
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,040 
Get off the line.

819
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,040 
Let's move on, Amelia.

820
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,640 
There's 5 basic contaminants
to every crime scene.

821
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,000 
I'll skip to the worst one.

822
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,040 
Other cops.

823
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,240 
I think I hear something.

824
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,240 
I hate this shit.

825
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,520 
I see something.

826
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,720 
I think I found him.

827
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,520 
I can't tell if he's alive.

828
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,760 
Oh, Jesus. He's covered in rats.

829
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,240 
They're all over him.

830
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,880 
-We're going in.
-No, you're not!

831
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,480 
Go! Go!

832
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,200 
Central, we have shots fired.
Shots fired.

833
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,640 
You were right. We never had a shot.

834
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,080 
He cut him up pretty bad
and left him for the rats.

835
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,800 
There's a cut in his leg
down to the bone.

836
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,440 
The blood attracted the rats.

837
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,520 
Goddamn son of a bitch.

838
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,240 
You okay?

839
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,440 
I'm fine.

840
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,080 
Step aside so I can walk the grid.

841
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,480 
Let's give her some room.

842
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,240 
Move it, guys.

843
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,840 
Rhyme, I'm gonna walk the grid.

844
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,840 
You know what to do.

845
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,920 
I found it.

846
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,000 
Another cluster.

847
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,080 
A piece of old paper
like the other two.

848
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,840 
And a matchbox.

849
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,080 
Bring that black suitcase over here.

850
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,880 
Pull out the brown envelope.

851
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,640 
Sounds like you're starting
to enjoy this work.

852
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,040 
Damn! The press is here.

853
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,680 
Park it right there.

854
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,760 
Lincoln Rhyme is no longer working
this case. I'm taking over.

855
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,560 
Do what you want to do, but you
ought to check with Murphy first.

856
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,640 
fuck Murphy and fuck Rhyme.

857
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,520 
This has been cleared downtown.
We got a dead kid on our hands...

858
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,840 
...and I, for one, am not taking
the heat for that.

859
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,000 
Tell Ortiz and his crew to vacate
Rhyme's place tonight.

860
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,640 
The victim was already dead
when we arrived.

861
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,000 
And you, half-assed patrolman
working a crime scene...

862
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,920 
...those days are over.

863
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,040 
I'll take that evidence bag now.

864
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,720 
You can take it with
a chain-of-custody voucher.

865
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,960 
Are you out of your mind?

866
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,440 
Let's go. You're coming with us.

867
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,880 
Are you arresting me?

868
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,440 
Just get in the car
and keep your mouth shut to the press.

869
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,480 
You won't find any prints.
He's too good for that.

870
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,240 
It looks like we have a nice,
clean friction print.

871
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,440 
Unless of course, it's yours.

872
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,560 
No, I was wearing gloves.

873
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,840 
We'll know soon enough.

874
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,680 
Put this through.
Highest priority.

875
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,840 
-You got it.
-Thank you.

876
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,680 
This perp's been
in business for a long time.

877
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,040 
I hear you, but you know,
it's Cheney's problem now.

878
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,240 
Yeah, that's what scares me.

879
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,040 
See if there's been
any homicides in the last 12 months...

880
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,840 
...involving surgically-removed flesh
exposing bone.

881
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,640 
No problem.

882
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,440 
See you soon.

883
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:13,840 
Hope so, Eddie.

884
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,880 
Thelma, don't you let him
run no circles around you.

885
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,840 
Stay right, Eddie.

886
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,440 
Oh, that print. We just got
a positive I.D. on it.

887
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,040 
The guy has three
extremely violent priors.

888
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,840 
Oh, look at that.

889
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,640 
Taxi license, no less.

890
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,040 
We got him.

891
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,440 
Let's go, boys!

892
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,880 
Somebody call ESU.

893
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,200 
Now slide out, nice and easy.

894
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,440 
That explains your print.

895
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,040 
He's hoping you'd show up.

896
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,040 
He's been worried about you.

897
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,600 
Yeah, sure.

898
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,200 
I didn't expect to see you again.

899
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,080 
Poor Cheney, huh?

900
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,440 
Grabbed the ball with both hands,
scored for the other team.

901
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,040 
I warned him that the perp was
too smart to leave a print.

902
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,640 
How you doing with that stuff?

903
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,240 
Not too good.

904
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,240 
Two pieces of the puzzle,
but I don't know what it means.

905
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,240 
Maybe this'll help.

906
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,520 
Cheney will have your badge for that.

907
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,160 
He wouldn't give me
a voucher. What could I do?

908
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,040 
You could take it back to him.

909
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,680 
The man is a living monument
to ineptitude.

910
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,080 
True. Let's take a look.

911
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,840 
What do you got there?

912
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,440 
Third piece of the puzzle.

913
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,640 
There's something really strange
about it, though.

914
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,040 
You gotta smell it.

915
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,840 
Sure.

916
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,440 
-Well, you--
-Shoot.

917
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:03,960 
Sorry.

918
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,200 
It's okay. Take your time.

919
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,040 
You have to put it closer to my nose.

920
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,560 
What do you think it is?

921
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,560 
Kerosene?

922
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,640 
Possibly.

923
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,480 
This just came in from Eddie Ortiz.

924
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,240 
Could you load these
into the computer for me?

925
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,240 
Sorry about that, Thelma.

926
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,440 
ECU.

927
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,040 
View scan.

928
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,760 
" Dear Linc, I am enclosing photos
of four unsolved homicides...

929
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,080 
...which took place
in the last 12 months.

930
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,560 
flesh has been removed
from the victims' extremities.

931
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,960 
I miss you. Love, Eddie."

932
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,840 
I'll spare myself the pleasure
if you don't mind.

933
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,240 
Zoom.

934
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,640 
Same mark.

935
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,520 
Right.

936
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,440 
Zoom.

937
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,840 
Zoom.

938
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,040 
Zoom.

939
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,640 
Same messages.

940
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,640 
It's him.

941
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,640 
He was trying to make
contact even then.

942
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,400 
But Cheney never put it together.

943
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,640 
Dysreflexia seizure. A bad one.

944
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,280 
Hang on. Hang on.
Breathe, Rhyme.

945
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,840 
Come on, breathe with me.

946
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,120 
Damn catheter's blocked.

947
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,640 
Just let me get a BP on you.
Stay with me! Breathe.

948
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,480 
Hang on. Hang on.

949
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,520 
Just let me check you.

950
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,880 
Diastolic's over 125.
I gotta get it down now.

951
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,800 
Just give it a few seconds to work.
Come on, breathe with me.

952
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,440 
Come on.

953
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,680 
Hang on, man.

954
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,840 
Is he gonna make it?

955
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,440 
If he does, he won't be happy.

956
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,040 
What are you talking about?

957
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,200 
He's finalized arrangements
to self-terminate.

958
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:42,400 
He convinced some doctor to help with
his final transition, as he calls it.

959
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,080 
But suicide?

960
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,920 
It's the seizures.

961
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:51,000 
Any one of them could put him
into a vegetative state.

962
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,440 
That's what he fears
more than anything.

963
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,880 
Who is it?

964
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,840 
Captain Cheney.

965
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,400 
Can I help you?

966
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,040 
Police business. Open up.

967
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,120 
Mr. Rhyme is asleep.

968
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:10,560 
Well, wake him up.
I need to see him now.

969
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,760 
Let me deal with this asshole.
You watch him.

970
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,360 
Anything, just call me.
He's all right.

971
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,160 
Look, lady.

972
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,000 
I hope you know that obstructing
justice is a felony offense.

973
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,440 
Look, don't " lady" me.

974
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,760 
Unless you have a warrant,
you can't come in here.

975
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,080 
I'm coming in.

976
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,840 
I have reason to believe
there's stolen evidence in there.

977
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,160 
What's your full name?

978
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,040 
Thelma what?

979
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,920 
So you wanna get official?

980
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,480 
What did you say your name was?

981
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,360 
You got a smart mouth
and it'll get you in trouble.

982
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,080 
It may bite your ass if you don't stop
aggravating my patient.

983
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,840 
I'm gonna leave now, but I'll be back.

984
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,880 
And when I come back,
it'll be with a warrant.

985
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,880 
And I looked everywhere.

986
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,640 
And I thought the conductor
would be angry.

987
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,960 
And I kept searching everywhere,
and finally...

988
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,040 
...it was right on my lap.

989
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,840 
Grandma can't wait to see you,
you know.

990
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,040 
What'd I do?

991
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,760 
You're carrying a fare
and your metre's not on...

992
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,320 
...and your hack license is
not properly--

993
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,440 
There's laws against molesting
the handicapped, you know.

994
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,040 
I wasn't a pretty sight, was I?

995
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,720 
Thelma told me about
your final transition.

996
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,360 
Cop to cop, that subject's
not open to discussion.

997
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,560 
Why? Would you miss me?

998
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,240 
Well, destiny's what we make it,
right?

999
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,440 
Touch.

1000
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,640 
You seem to have your reasons
for "checking out."

1001
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,120 
I expected more
from someone like you.

1002
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,320 
Well, I might surprise you...

1003
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,960 
...and live forever.

1004
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,440 
Nothing you'd do
would surprise me.

1005
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,440 
Well, look who's still
in the land of the living.

1006
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,240 
for the moment.

1007
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,800 
Cheney was here
huffing and puffing.

1008
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,440 
-He promised to return with a warrant.
-Sorry I missed him.

1009
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,280 
If that's him, tell him...

1010
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,840 
-Say no more.
-...l'm skiing.

1011
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,960 
Hey, Paulie. Hang on.

1012
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,080 
I don't know if it's
just a coincidence...

1013
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,800 
...but an inspector was killed
by a cabby who was off the metre.

1014
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,440 
The thing is, a male witness
who wouldn't give his name...

1015
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:07,120 
...saw the taxi with
an old man and a little girl inside.

1016
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,040 
Probably the doer that called.

1017
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,120 
Jesus, he's got a kid.

1018
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,240 
And an old man.

1019
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,240 
Thank you, Paulie.

1020
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,560 
We'd better look closer
at that third piece of the puzzle.

1021
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,120 
Close.

1022
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,120 
Three murders.
Three evidence clusters.

1023
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,720 
Three pieces of paper.

1024
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,280 
View scan.

1025
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,280 
You're the queen of puzzles.
What do you see?

1026
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,760 
I'm looking. I'm looking.

1027
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,000 
Lower the little one.

1028
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,120 
That one.

1029
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,000 
Twist that big one around.

1030
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:15,520 
Doesn't that kind of look like a face?
Mouth, nose, eye.

1031
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,080 
Enhance.

1032
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,720 
fade.

1033
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,320 
A woman's face.

1034
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,960 
Yes, it is.

1035
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,520 
It's a logo.

1036
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,760 
An old...

1037
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,920 
...turn-of-the-century...

1038
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,840 
...publisher's logo.

1039
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,720 
You know it?

1040
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,320 
I used to own a few of the books.
Gothic stories.

1041
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,280 
Crime stories.

1042
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,120 
The killer is pointing us
to an old book.

1043
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,520 
Can I help you?

1044
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,400 
I called about old crime books.

1045
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,560 
Around the corner. Help yourself.

1046
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,720 
Thanks.

1047
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,520 
Aviation Two to Central.

1048
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,360 
We're taking a flyby
at the Brooklyn Bridge.

1049
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,720 
Report appears unfounded
at this time.

1050
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,040 
Will check East River
shoreline and advise.

1051
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,120 
I need more small boats
to search under the piers.

1052
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,800 
By the heliport. Under the piers.

1053
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,560 
It was the last murder in the book.

1054
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,760 
They've gotta be along the shore.

1055
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,360 
Listen, the lab says
the odour we smelled...

1056
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,840 
...on the third piece of the puzzle is
probably diesel fuel.

1057
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:16,160 
There's an old boat refuelling station
at the Staten Island Ferry pier.

1058
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,920 
Check the pilings under the pier.

1059
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,560 
found them!

1060
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,480 
Over here!

1061
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:07,960 
Here!

1062
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,560 
Here!

1063
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,640 
I can see someone with a light...

1064
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:15,320 
...signalling us from
the old Staten Island Ferry pier.

1065
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,520 
There appears to be two bodies
in the water.

1066
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,120 
Be advised, subject signalling is
most likely NYPD officer.

1067
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:34,960 
Over here!

1068
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,720 
Here!

1069
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,720 
Watch the pilings!

1070
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,720 
We've got divers
coming in to you now.

1071
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,200 
Over to the ladder.

1072
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,360 
Be advised, aideds are
out of the water...

1073
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,480 
...and ESU is working on them
at this time.

1074
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,200 
Rhyme, are you there?

1075
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,600 
We're too late.

1076
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,160 
forget it. He's dead.

1077
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,880 
The old man's gone.

1078
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,720 
They're working on the girl,
but it doesn't look good.

1079
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,120 
Try again.
I know she's still there.

1080
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,760 
Come on, kid. Come on. Try for me.

1081
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,640 
Come on. You can do it.

1082
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,320 
Come on.

1083
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,320 
Breathe.

1084
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,320 
Breathe.

1085
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,720 
She's breathing.

1086
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,800 
She'll be okay.
She's breathing. Can you hear me?

1087
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,120 
-I think she's gonna make it.
-Good. Good.

1088
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:03,080 
You gotta find the clues
that he left for us.

1089
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,360 
See what you can find
around the fuel tanks.

1090
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,720 
All right.

1091
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:32,360 
I found it.

1092
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:36,240 
It's a map of some kind,
some chunk of a clean bone...

1093
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,280 
...and a piece of a medal
or a badge or something.

1094
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,200 
There's initials engraved.
It looks like...

1095
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,800 
...a P and a B.

1096
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,440 
It's definitely a D.

1097
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,240 
P.D. Sounds like a cop's badge.

1098
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:55,960 
Think he'll kill a cop?

1099
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,480 
Could be.

1100
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:01,680 
Maps?

1101
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,240 
Tell me about the map.

1102
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,760 
Looks like an old subway map.

1103
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,600 
I don't recognize the stations.

1104
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,720 
When I scanned asbestos sites,
I came across...

1105
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,280 
...stations that aren't
in use anymore.

1106
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,080 
There it is. The oldest station.

1107
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,680 
On your map, is there an old station
indicated at the tip of Manhattan?

1108
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,920 
Navy Street.

1109
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,080 
It's right next to the pier.

1110
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:33,520 
Oh, shit.

1111
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:35,280 
Cheney's here.

1112
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,640 
You talking to Rhyme on that thing?
Give me the radio.

1113
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,800 
This is Cheney. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1114
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,400 
Stealing evidence is
a goddamn felony.

1115
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:53,120 
I understand there's no
chain-of-evidence voucher.

1116
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,440 
Oh, yeah? I got some news for you.

1117
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,880 
You're not a cop anymore.
Understand?

1118
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,760 
What you are is
a fucking meddling cripple.

1119
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,760 
I'm gonna place your little gofer
under arrest.

1120
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,680 
You don't mind that, do you?

1121
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,280 
Lock her up.

1122
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,880 
Where'd she go?

1123
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,480 
I'm inside the Navy Street tunnel.

1124
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:40,600 
There's grey dust everywhere.
It's all over my shoes.

1125
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,880 
There's footprints.

1126
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,080 
One set of footprints.

1127
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,920 
The mobile unit you've called
is not responding.

1128
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,280 
Re-call.

1129
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,280 
No dust.

1130
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,280 
He changed the numbers.

1131
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,520 
7-8-4-9-9. What is that?

1132
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:08,280 
7-8-4-9-9.

1133
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,880 
What does it mean?

1134
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,080 
What does it mean?

1135
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,560 
Help me, Rhyme. Help me.

1136
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,080 
He's gonna kill Rhyme.

1137
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,080 
Coming.

1138
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,880 
Hey, what are you doing here?

1139
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,080 
Is that Amelia?

1140
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:49,560 
Bed mode.

1141
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,280 
Thelma, is that you?

1142
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,480 
No, it's me. Richard.

1143
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,520 
Richard? What's up?

1144
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,640 
Thelma asked me to
check the heart-pacing machine.

1145
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,000 
Where is Thelma?

1146
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,680 
Out in the hall.

1147
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,520 
Phone mode.

1148
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:10,080 
It was time we had
a quiet moment together.

1149
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,800 
You and I, no interruptions.

1150
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,680 
What's on your mind?

1151
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,680 
I think it's time to set
the record straight.

1152
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:21,680 
Syracuse.

1153
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,280 
You remember Syracuse, don't you?

1154
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:26,960 
You wrote an expert opinion.

1155
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,000 
I wrote thousands of opinions.

1156
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,480 
Don't fucking tell me
you don't remember Syracuse.

1157
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,520 
They called it an investigation.
It was a witch hunt.

1158
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,880 
There was a forensics cop
up in Syracuse, New York.

1159
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,960 
Marcus Andrews.

1160
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,800 
Okay, that was the cop
that was suspected...

1161
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,120 
...of tampering with evidence
in some homicide cases.

1162
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:51,560 
-Nothing was tampered with.
-Six innocent people went to jail.

1163
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:55,480 
They went to jail because
they were guilty. They were scum.

1164
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,480 
-He doctored the reports.
-Nothing was doctored.

1165
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,360 
He planted blood evidence.

1166
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,880 
My work was impeccable.

1167
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:05,920 
Where are we going with this...

1168
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,280 
...Marcus?

1169
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:15,840 
Your report destroyed my life.

1170
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:18,080 
My report was not a legal finding.

1171
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:21,520 
-You never let me defend myself.
-I never even met you.

1172
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:24,120 
I was sent to prison for six years!

1173
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,680 
I spent two more years
getting to you.

1174
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:29,480 
Do you know what happens
to a cop in jail?

1175
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:32,680 
Every day, every single day...

1176
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:37,400 
...over and over, I was brutalized.
I became a human toilet...

1177
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,200 
...because of your expert opinion.

1178
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:43,680 
Well, you will never point the finger
of blame at anyone ever again.

1179
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:48,040 
You were never as good as they said.

1180
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,520 
I played you. I tested you.

1181
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,400 
I gave you every clue.

1182
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,800 
You and your helper
couldn't save them.

1183
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,280 
Their blood is on your hands.
You failed.

1184
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,200 
You failed, you fuck.

1185
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,720 
Game of chess, Mr. Rhyme.
Some people win. Some people lose.

1186
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,640 
I win, Mr. Rhyme. I win. You lose.

1187
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,800 
Which vegetable
would you like to be?

1188
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,320 
A carrot?

1189
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:18,720 
How about a zucchini?

1190
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:22,000 
Zucchini?

1191
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,640 
You wanna be a zucchini?

1192
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,840 
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

1193
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,680 
Did you say zucchini?

1194
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:07,280 
You want to play?

1195
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,480 
Shall we cut out your tongue,
Mr. Rhyme?

1196
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,880 
How about your eye? Your eye?

1197
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,080 
I'll just pop it out of there.

1198
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:29,000 
Let's leave that for now.

1199
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,480 
You can watch me.

1200
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:34,960 
You can watch me while I gut you
open right down the middle.

1201
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,280 
What?

1202
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,280 
What?

1203
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:22,880 
Can you hear me?

1204
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,480 
Oh, God.

1205
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,520 
Step aside.
We'll take care of him.

1206
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,280 
-I've always loved this view.
-I like it too, doc.

1207
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,480 
It's looking better every day.

1208
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,000 
How you guys doing?

1209
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,480 
Good.

1210
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:41,760 
You got an operating license for that?

1211
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:44,080 
I got a learner's permit.

1212
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,520 
-How's your boyfriend?
-He's in florida. He play golf.

1213
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,040 
Playing golf?

1214
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,080 
Captain flash on wheels.

1215
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,880 
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1216
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:02,680 
If you be cruising,
you might as well be amusing.

1217
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,200 
-There you go.
-Thank you, Eddie.

1218
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:10,520 
Come on in.

1219
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,480 
Merry Christmas.

1220
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,160 
-You're looking good there, Mr. Rhyme.
-Mr. Rhyme?

1221
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,080 
It's Lincoln to you.
Loosen your shorts.

1222
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:27,080 
Oh, my goodness.

1223
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:30,320 
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing here?

1224
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,320 
-Merry Christmas, Uncle Linc.
-Give me a kiss.

1225
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,880 
Merry Christmas, Kimmy. How are you?

1226
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,120 
How you doing, Tony?

1227
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,600 
I didn't know you'd make this trip.

1228
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,640 
Wouldn't be a surprise if you knew.

1229
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,320 
I'm sorry. Amelia, this is
my sister, Janine. Her family.

1230
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:47,080 
Yeah, I know. Hi.

1231
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,600 
You know?

1232
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:49,680 
We've met.

1233
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,480 
On the phone. How you doing?

1234
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,280 
Merry Christmas, Lincoln.

1235
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:09,600 
Merry Christmas.

1236
01:49:06,840 --> 01:53:07,840
