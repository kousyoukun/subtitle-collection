1
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:35,104
How's it look?

2
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:39,481
The cop's body's about 300 yards
down in an abandoned tunnel.

3
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:42,028
-Howie?
-Right behind you, captain.

4
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:45,111
Keep back till
I process the scene, okay?

5
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,615
Watch out! It's falling!

6
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:16,317
So where the hell is the car?

7
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,768
I don't know.

8
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:21,359
That's the last time
I take a goddamn redeye.

9
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:22,613
We can take a cab.

10
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:27,450
I'm gonna fire this son of a bitch.
He's always got some excuse.

11
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:35,713
Well, come on.
We'll be home before you know it.

12
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,207
Excuse me?

13
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:21,000
I think you're going the wrong way.

14
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,638
Excuse me.

15
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,392
Honey, wake up.

16
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:28,891
We're lost
or he's taking us for a ride.

17
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:31,806
We're in the middle of nowhere.

18
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:34,356
Where you going?
I said fifth Avenue.

19
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,146
We're not tourists here, man!

20
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,735
Hey, where are you going?

21
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:52,662
Let us out. Stop the car!

22
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,291
Stop this car!

23
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:08,725
Shit!

24
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,435
Oh, my God.

25
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,184
Son of a bitch!

26
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:14,643
Stop the goddamn car!

27
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:25,740
-Please!
-Stop the car!

28
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,994
Stop this car, goddamn it!

29
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,540
Stop this car!

30
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:35,417
Good morning.

31
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:40,676
You're looking a little dehydrated.
How about some juice?

32
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,970
How about two fingers of vodka?

33
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,680
A little early for vodka,
don't you think?

34
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:48,302
Time, as you know,
is a relative consideration.

35
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:50,688
-Juice.
-Vodka.

36
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:52,732
-Juice.
-Vodka.

37
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:56,853
-Coming!
-Join me in a drink, Richard?

38
00:07:57,072 --> 00:08:00,572
I'd love to. But a med-tech
with liquor breath? I think not.

39
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,108
Thanks.

40
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:03,408
So how are you?

41
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:06,113
I'm better than
your heart-pacing gear.

42
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:10,039
Every time, it's skewed further
out of spec. You need a new unit.

43
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,038
I really need a new body.

44
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:16,961
I can't help you with that,
but I'll bring a new unit by tomorrow.

45
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:18,837
This'll be stable till then.

46
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:20,963
-Thank you.
-You take it easy.

47
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:23,590
I'll take it any way I can get it.

48
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:27,972
-How's he doing?
-He asked for a vodka again.

49
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,270
-Did you give him any?
-No.

50
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:33,391
-Good morning, doctor.
-Hi, Richard.

51
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:35,901
Hey, would you look at this?

52
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:38,484
A peregrine falcon, right?

53
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:42,365
He likes cripples.

54
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:48,416
There was a piece about them in
the Times nesting all over the city.

55
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:52,375
Something about the architecture
of these old New York buildings.

56
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:54,708
I thought he liked my company.

57
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:02,430
They're a little shy.
Don't take it personally.

58
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:03,846
Can I get you a drink?

59
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:05,477
No, thanks. I'm fine.

60
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,010
Bed mode.

61
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:19,606
-Got vodka in there?
-No.

62
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,115
And you ain't getting any either.

63
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:25,328
All right, I'll let you guys talk.

64
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:31,796
So you can imagine how much sleep
I've gotten the past few days...

65
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,879
...considering your request.

66
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:37,342
Since I made my decision,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

67
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:41,379
After all you have survived,
beat all the odds...

68
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:45,092
...you know there's work
on nerve regeneration every day.

69
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:50,140
One finger, two shoulders and a brain.
That's all I have, Barry.

70
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:54,105
These dysreflexia seizures
are occurring more often.

71
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,362
The buildup of fluid in my spine
is a degenerative condition.

72
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:02,324
We know I'm waiting for the seizure
that'll make me a vegetable.

73
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:07,246
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Barry.

74
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:12,956
I want to make the final transition
on my own terms.

75
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,085
I'll get it done with or without you.

76
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,679
Yeah, I suppose you would.

77
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:28,727
So?

78
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:35,979
-Okay.
-Okay what?

79
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:42,360
Okay, I'll assist you...

80
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,448
-...in your transition.
-Today?

81
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,243
There are preparations to be made.
This is not a flu shot.

82
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:51,787
My business is in order.
Bags are packed.

83
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:54,628
Besides, I've got
a medical conference to go to.

84
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,385
I've got a plane to catch.

85
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:58,137
You're lying.

86
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:00,467
When do you get back?

87
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:03,257
Sunday.

88
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,719
Sunday.

89
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,183
I'll see you then.

90
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:13,979
Get out before you change your mind.

91
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,859
Don't get up. I'll show myself out.

92
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,319
Yeah, I'll race you to the door.

93
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:22,944
Barry....

94
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,948
You are...

95
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,462
...a very good friend.

96
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,139
Amelia?

97
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:27,978
Morning.

98
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,395
You okay?

99
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,647
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just couldn't sleep.

100
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:40,114
-What time is it?
-It's early.

101
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,420
I'll be late. I gotta shower.

102
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:53,299
No, you don't. Stay here.

103
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:55,375
I gotta go.

104
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:09,139
Make breakfast?

105
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:12,023
No, thanks. I'm gonna be late.

106
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,150
Another slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am?

107
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,536
All right, look....

108
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:22,907
My therapist tells me...

109
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,036
...l don't get what I need
out of this relationship.

110
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,794
What are we doing here?

111
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:30,833
I think you and me,
we make a great couple.

112
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,709
You know where I stand on this.

113
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,303
You know what I want.

114
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:38,714
Steve, we've been through this.

115
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:41,634
All right? I care about you.

116
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:44,137
I can't make a commitment.

117
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:55,612
Well, go to work then.

118
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:58,534
You're gonna be late.

119
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,132
-You're quitting the cops?
-I'm transferring to Youth Services.

120
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,341
Lucky fuck. You must
have one hell of a rabbi.

121
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,048
-We're gonna miss you.
-3-post-11 here.

122
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,184
Frightened child at Amtrak site.

123
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:24,718
I'll take it.

124
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:27,348
Kid found something
over at the tracks.

125
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,651
-finish eating. I'll check it out.
-See you, kid.

126
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,262
3-post-11,
anything further on that 10-10?

127
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:01,935
Nothing yet.

128
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:05,731
Wait. I think I see him.

129
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:09,646
Are you the one
who called the police?

130
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:54,067
Wait there, okay?

131
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,306
Are you crazy?

132
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,347
Just shut off the engine.

133
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,643
There's been a homicide.
I can't let you through.

134
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,451
What's your name?

135
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,745
Chris.

136
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,787
I got a job for you.

137
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:26,209
Here's money.

138
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,998
I need you to buy me one of
those cheapo cardboard cameras.

139
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,424
You know, the ones you can throw away?

140
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:34,256
fast as you can.

141
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:42,593
3-post-11 to Central.

142
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,134
Captain Cheney, Detective Solomon.

143
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:43,392
first officer on the scene
is over there.

144
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,774
--on the tracks near the body.

145
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:48,691
I collected it
before it was washed away.

146
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:54,316
-I also took some pictures.
-Thanks.

147
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,577
You stopped the train?

148
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:59,327
It might have disturbed
the physical evidence.

149
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,454
Why not shut down Grand Central
while you're at it?

150
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,669
Patrolman Donahue. Is that right?

151
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:06,001
Donaghy.

152
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:08,292
A rookie, I take it.

153
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:09,339
No, sir.

154
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:11,424
Pretty dumb.

155
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:13,421
Captain...

156
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,176
...guess who the vic is?

157
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,473
-Talk to me.
-Alan fucking Rubin.

158
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:20,177
Mister " Rebuild New York" himself?

159
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:26,444
No one enters this area
except for my crime scene guys.

160
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,239
Knight to h6. Check.

161
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:43,916
You got company. Cops.

162
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,131
-Tell them I'm busy.
-They said it was urgent.

163
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:48,622
Tell them I'm out running.

164
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,296
She's too polite for that, Linc.

165
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:54,182
Hey, look who's here!

166
00:20:56,768 --> 00:20:58,761
I caught a serious situation.

167
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:00,770
It's going around, Paulie.

168
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:03,062
Chief Murphy sent me.

169
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:05,607
The good chief.

170
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:11,569
Heard about that couple at the airport?
Got in a taxi, never got home?

171
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:13,483
He don't watch the news.

172
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:17,244
You used to read four papers a day
and tape the news shows.

173
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:20,244
Yeah, now I just hit
the rewind button. A3.

174
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:21,830
Things never change.

175
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:24,916
That was Alan Rubin
and his wife in that taxi.

176
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:28,213
They found him dead,
buried, shot in the face...

177
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:32,418
...hand sticking out of the ground
with his wife's ring on his finger...

178
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,299
...which was skinned to the bone.

179
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,262
She's still missing.

180
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:38,220
Excuse me while you catch up.

181
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:39,677
Don't go too far.

182
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:43,397
We'll be letting these nice
gentlemen out in 30 seconds.

183
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:46,986
Sounds like you got yourself
an open-and-shut there.

184
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:48,691
I don't think so.

185
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:51,694
A man worth several hundred
million found dead...

186
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,235
...his wife's ring
on his mutilated hand.

187
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:56,532
What's that tell you?

188
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,579
The doer is saying he's got her.

189
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:02,748
He's probably making
a ransom demand right now.

190
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:06,215
-I'd have been paged.
-Check your batteries.

191
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:08,628
It's definitely a ransom.

192
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,218
Excuse me, Mr. Rhyme.
Kenneth Solomon.

193
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:18,641
I've read all your books. Scene of
the Crime, at least a dozen times.

194
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:20,647
It's great to meet you.

195
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:26,060
-Where do you find these guys?
-They wanna work with the best.

196
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:31,032
I guess now you're gonna ask me
to discuss the crime scene with you.

197
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:35,569
We got a bunch of physical evidence
that doesn't exactly make sense.

198
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:39,165
Some seriously weird stuff.
It's all in the report.

199
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:42,327
Thelma?

200
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:43,627
You okay?

201
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:47,968
-Linc, you okay?
-Out! Now!

202
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:51,511
-Anything we can do?
-Asses out of here now!

203
00:22:51,723 --> 00:22:54,807
Let me get you some air.
Come on. Breathe for me.

204
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,015
I said out!

205
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:02,105
Come on. Deep breaths.
Deep breaths. Come on.

206
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,642
Deep breaths.
I'm getting a BP on you.

207
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:06,066
You gotta breathe.

208
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,319
Look at me. Breathe.

209
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:15,406
Look at me. Deep breaths.
Come on. Come on.

210
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:17,871
You gotta take this oxygen.

211
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,329
Stay with me.

212
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:23,122
Come on. You can do it.
Don't go out on me now.

213
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,172
Come on. Look at me.

214
00:23:54,664 --> 00:23:56,953
-Thelma?
-You okay?

215
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:01,499
I would be if your powers
of resuscitation were less adept.

216
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:04,961
Look, not on my shift, all right?

217
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:07,666
If you have a problem,
you can fire my ass.

218
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:11,172
I provide for you in my will.
You ought to keep that in mind.

219
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:16,224
Rhyme, I'm not interested in
having this conversation. Okay?

220
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,352
The crime scene report
Sellitto left....

221
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:23,775
Could you take the photos
and load them in the viewer?

222
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:25,439
View scan.

223
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:34,614
Let's take a look at what we got here.

224
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:37,578
Where it says location....

225
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:42,162
Now what's that--?
What's it say about that newspaper?

226
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,715
" Newspaper found beneath
a coarse-thread hex bolt...

227
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:48,424
...with 4 p.m. circled on it."

228
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:50,635
Zoom.

229
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,381
Zoom.

230
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,971
What about that piece of paper?
What's the number on there?

231
00:24:59,315 --> 00:25:01,641
"A torn book page with 119 on it."

232
00:25:02,193 --> 00:25:03,522
119, 4 p.m.

233
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:06,772
119, 4 p.m.

234
00:25:11,203 --> 00:25:12,863
11-9. What's today's date?

235
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:15,205
Today's November 9.

236
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:16,871
Phone mode.

237
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:19,374
Sellitto, Paulie. Call.

238
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,129
What?

239
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:31,180
Sad fact is, a huge percentage
of inner-city kids...

240
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:33,680
...have their
first drug experiences...

241
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,349
...at the fifth grade level.

242
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:41,853
Here are some of the drugs
they'll be offered.

243
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:46,406
Marijuana.

244
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:49,904
How'd you like to get your hands
on that briefcase?

245
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:51,619
Barbiturates.

246
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:53,320
Amphetamines.

247
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:55,540
Cocaine.

248
00:25:56,626 --> 00:25:58,286
Rock cocaine.

249
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:11,174
-What's this about?
-You know who Lincoln Rhyme is?

250
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:13,680
-What? The textbook guy?
-Yeah.

251
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:17,435
-So what does that have to do with me?
-You'll find out.

252
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:22,978
Come on in. They're in there.

253
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:28,691
A patrol cop took these pictures?

254
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:31,822
Yeah, first one on the scene.
It started to rain.

255
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:32,987
Smart cop.

256
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:36,824
Had the balls to stop an Amtrak
from running over the crime scene.

257
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:39,166
Here she is now.
Officer Donahoe...

258
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:41,213
...meet Lincoln Rhyme.

259
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:42,663
Donaghy.

260
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:48,804
You took terrific photographs.

261
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:52,052
You know who I am?

262
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,885
I read your manual at the academy.

263
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,934
What'd you think?

264
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:58,315
I'm not a book critic.

265
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:00,348
You found it useful?

266
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,106
I guess so.

267
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:04,734
Sure you did.
You stopped that train.

268
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:07,067
The photos you took.

269
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:11,072
I'd say you have
a natural instinct for forensics.

270
00:27:11,621 --> 00:27:13,744
So what do we got, Paulie?

271
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:18,661
We have footprints, size 10,
thanks to Officer Donaghy...

272
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:21,287
...using a dollar bill
to establish scale.

273
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,212
We have asbestos
where there shouldn't be any.

274
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:27,878
An iron bolt holding down
a piece of paper...

275
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:31,098
...a book page
with 119 written on it.

276
00:27:31,434 --> 00:27:33,225
Decaying oxidation on the bolt...

277
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:36,354
...but none on the thread.
Someone removed it...

278
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:37,970
...from somewhere else...

279
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:41,477
...and placed it there recently.
Wouldn't you agree, officer?

280
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:44,400
Wouldn't you agree, Officer Donaghy?

281
00:27:48,452 --> 00:27:51,406
Paulie, I'm convinced
this crime scene was staged.

282
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:54,286
-Perp's telling us something.
-What?

283
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,378
Book, page 119. 11-9.
That's today's date.

284
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:59,953
Newspaper, 4 p.m.
What time you got?

285
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:01,128
12:15.

286
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:03,915
She's alive.

287
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,464
-And he's gonna kill her at 4?
-P.M.

288
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:11,557
We have your interest yet?

289
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:17,560
I want you to work the case with us.

290
00:28:17,774 --> 00:28:19,352
It's not my area.

291
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,525
Are you being modest, or are you...

292
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:25,276
...uneasy about doing
some real police work?

293
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:27,988
Excuse me?

294
00:28:28,202 --> 00:28:30,242
What department do you work in?

295
00:28:30,663 --> 00:28:33,415
Youth Services.
I picked her up at orientation.

296
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:35,416
I see. Youth Services.

297
00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:38,623
I wait-listed a year,
and I won't jeopardize--

298
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:40,498
Jeopardize what?

299
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:43,038
Cushy desk job?

300
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:46,130
-forensics is not my area.
-I disagree with you.

301
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:49,265
You can't force me
to take this assignment.

302
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:52,806
I can.

303
00:28:53,854 --> 00:28:54,885
And if I refuse?

304
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:57,264
You're putting your career at risk.

305
00:28:57,525 --> 00:29:00,561
You think because of your condition
you can push people around?

306
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:02,736
That is truly pathetic.

307
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,820
Truly?

308
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:07,025
Yeah, damn right. Truly.

309
00:29:07,243 --> 00:29:09,070
Well, forgive me truly...

310
00:29:09,787 --> 00:29:12,824
...if I insist on having
someone with your brains...

311
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:16,997
...and a fresh pair of eyes.
There's a life at stake here, officer.

312
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:20,413
We'll need key people
and tech support.

313
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:22,425
I know the guys.

314
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:26,379
What the hell you smiling at?

315
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,017
Pull up a chair.

316
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,401
Tell me everything you know
about the crime scene.

317
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,276
It's in my report.

318
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,654
I read your report.
I want to know what you felt...

319
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,530
...what you feel...

320
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,781
...in the deepest recesses
of your senses.

321
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,417
You are in love with the sound
of your voice, aren't you?

322
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,914
It's your voice I want to hear.
Sit down. I won't bite.

323
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:31,371
The rifling on the .38 slug
they dug out of the victim...

324
00:30:31,624 --> 00:30:35,242
...is consistent with a Webley,
an old, turn-of-the-century handgun.

325
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:38,420
On the big board, please.
What about that bolt?

326
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,877
There's three initials
on the head: N.S.G.

327
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:44,424
And the bolt's not steel. It's iron.

328
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:45,842
Iron.

329
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:49,183
Iron. Iron. Making it old...

330
00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:50,887
...like the Webley.

331
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:53,973
Officer Donaghy,
what do you know about asbestos?

332
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:56,312
It kills Americans every day.

333
00:30:56,858 --> 00:30:57,689
Very good.

334
00:30:58,026 --> 00:30:59,900
-You computer literate?
-A little.

335
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:01,483
Thelma!

336
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:04,404
Thelma? Where's my Thelma?

337
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,152
Thelma, meet Amelia.
Amelia, Thelma.

338
00:31:08,371 --> 00:31:10,613
Amelia hates my books
and computers...

339
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:13,323
...but she's got an A-plus nose
for evidence...

340
00:31:13,543 --> 00:31:16,627
...so show her how to
access D.E.P. files.

341
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,341
See if there's any large asbestos
cleanups going on in the city.

342
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:22,589
ASAP.

343
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:27,295
-Where is Eddie Ortiz?
-Right here!

344
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:32,427
How's the world's
crankiest criminalist?

345
00:31:32,855 --> 00:31:34,100
Playing " beat the clock."

346
00:31:34,315 --> 00:31:35,892
Everybody's worst nightmare.

347
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:39,643
Get in a cab, and there's a psycho
from Jersey behind the wheel.

348
00:31:40,112 --> 00:31:41,655
We don't know he's from Jersey.

349
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:44,901
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.

350
00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:46,280
You bring the whole lab?

351
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:49,697
-Mom always told me to be prepared.
-Where do you want this?

352
00:31:49,914 --> 00:31:52,702
Put it over here in the corner.
How is your mother?

353
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:57,004
She's 76, and she's shtupping a guy
named Morris. Can you believe that?

354
00:31:57,464 --> 00:31:58,579
God bless her.

355
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,922
But it's Morris I'm worried about.

356
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:04,089
He's 79 with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.

357
00:32:11,979 --> 00:32:14,352
-Afternoon. Captain Cheney.
-Amelia...

358
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,357
...what about that asbestos?

359
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,059
There's a dozen cleanups
in the five boroughs.

360
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,987
Put it up on the viewer for me.

361
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,908
Narrow it down
to the oldest locations.

362
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,534
How you doing, Howie?

363
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:27,196
fine. How's it going?

364
00:32:27,454 --> 00:32:29,910
In the middle of the middle,
as you can see.

365
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:33,744
Look what I found on
the threading of that iron bolt.

366
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:37,917
I was hoping to grab a minute
if you don't mind.

367
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:40,081
Excuse me.

368
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,801
Sorry. Sorry.

369
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:46,344
We got Donaghy to thank for
photographing the crucial evidence.

370
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:48,217
Crucial evidence?

371
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:53,346
We don't know that. I wanted to make
sure you had the support you need.

372
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:57,985
I'm putting the full resources of
my department here at your disposal.

373
00:32:58,361 --> 00:33:00,401
I appreciate it. Thank you.

374
00:33:00,614 --> 00:33:02,441
But the thing is, Linc...

375
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:07,078
...l've formalized procedures
since you were in charge, and so--

376
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:09,867
Put what you got up
on my screen, please.

377
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:13,501
So I'd appreciate it
if you kept me in the loop.

378
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:14,660
Absolutely.

379
00:33:15,671 --> 00:33:17,082
At all times.

380
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:18,912
At all--

381
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:21,631
What the hell is that
we're looking at?

382
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:25,383
Old paper.

383
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,349
Coarse grade.

384
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:29,226
I'd say...

385
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:31,227
...80, 90 years old.

386
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,149
Turn-of-the-century, it looks like.

387
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:37,858
The perp likes old.

388
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,564
fine, then....

389
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,903
I'll be in my office if you need me.

390
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,612
Yeah, okay, Howie.

391
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,406
Good.

392
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:50,707
Old paper.

393
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:53,037
Old gun.

394
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:58,920
Buries his victim in a vintage
Civil War railroad bed.

395
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:01,250
Sand.

396
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:06,008
Sand. Sand....
Eddie, what do you got on the sand?

397
00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:10,226
Doesn't really look like sand.

398
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:13,769
-I'm not sure.
-Can you individuate it?

399
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:15,560
If I had an EDX, I could.

400
00:34:16,068 --> 00:34:18,394
We don't have
a goddamn E-the-fuck-X.

401
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,481
Look who forgot their chill pill
this morning. Excuse me.

402
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,654
Come on. I'm all over this thing now.

403
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,530
Okay, we're talking...

404
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:29,707
...pearly-looking.

405
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:32,333
Some kind of a...

406
00:34:32,586 --> 00:34:35,041
...shellfish or something.

407
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:38,877
Oyster shells, maybe?

408
00:34:40,552 --> 00:34:41,382
Could be.

409
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,341
Definitely. If I had to bet on it,
I'd say it was. Sure.

410
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:53,599
I got it. The oldest asbestos
sites are coming up now.

411
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:28,143
In 1913, when the Woolworth Building
was being built...

412
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:31,769
...workmen found the body of
a rich industrialist, Talbot Soames.

413
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:36,476
He'd been kidnapped, shot and buried
in what they thought was sand.

414
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:40,355
Turned out to be oyster shells.
Crushed oyster shells.

415
00:35:40,574 --> 00:35:43,694
That's what they used as
landfill in lower Manhattan.

416
00:35:43,952 --> 00:35:49,030
That's how Pearl Street got its name.
That's where Mrs. Rubin will be.

417
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,534
She'll be underground.

418
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:54,078
She'll be in a basement...

419
00:35:54,338 --> 00:35:56,746
...near or in the Woolworth Building.

420
00:35:56,966 --> 00:36:01,260
Have Emergency Services Unit
meet us by the Woolworth Building.

421
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:04,044
Tell them to start their search.
We may get lucky.

422
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:06,385
Eddie, did you bring your van?

423
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:08,434
-It's downstairs.
-We'll need it.

424
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,641
Throw your keys to Amelia.
You guys go with her.

425
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:12,936
Should I go too?

426
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,439
You stay here with me
and work that bolt.

427
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:16,851
That's the missing piece.

428
00:36:17,112 --> 00:36:18,737
Should we keep Cheney in the loop?

429
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,070
fuck him.

430
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:21,273
fuck him.

431
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:26,070
Amelia.

432
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,700
Just trust me.

433
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:33,285
Just follow those instincts
you were born with. I'll be with you...

434
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:35,712
...every step of the way.

435
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:48,224
Jesus, 25 minutes left.

436
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:53,728
-How did Rhyme get that way?
-He was born brilliant. It happens.

437
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:56,436
I mean, the physical part.

438
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:00,609
four years ago, he was working
the body of a cop...

439
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:03,114
...they'd found shot
in a subway tunnel.

440
00:37:03,912 --> 00:37:06,664
Beam came down
and damn near cut him in half.

441
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:08,328
Jesus.

442
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:11,576
family?

443
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:14,084
Sister in Phoenix.

444
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,461
He never sees her.
Cut himself off.

445
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:21,298
Technically, he's still on
active duty collecting pay.

446
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:24,391
Insurance picks up
24-hour care and the gadgets.

447
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,934
On weekends, always one or two cops
there lending a hand.

448
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:30,898
-Tough deal.
-You won't hear him complaining.

449
00:37:31,107 --> 00:37:33,515
He likes pushing
other people's buttons.

450
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:36,060
In your case, that's a compliment.

451
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:40,449
You gotta learn to relax around
a compliment, especially from Rhyme.

452
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:43,066
-You can be a little grating.
-Me?

453
00:37:43,286 --> 00:37:46,572
Kiddo, if you were any more wound up,
you'd be a Timex.

454
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:55,876
He was a human dynamo, writing books,
lecturing all over the world...

455
00:37:56,133 --> 00:38:00,048
...giving expert opinion in trials,
working crimes in the city.

456
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:01,757
You know what he'd do for fun?

457
00:38:02,098 --> 00:38:03,758
No, I can't imagine.

458
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:06,929
He'd collect things.
Dirt, metals, plastics...

459
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:10,271
...hubcaps, plants, musical strings...

460
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:12,397
...medical tools, anything.

461
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:13,813
Obsessive.

462
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:17,983
He'd analyse and catalogue it
for his, what you call it, database.

463
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:23,533
Jesus Christ! I'd like to get there
in one piece if possible.

464
00:38:48,897 --> 00:38:52,397
-New York Security Gate Company.
-That's good. What else?

465
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:54,727
Nicholas Steven Gerard, elevators.

466
00:38:54,945 --> 00:38:56,653
-No, underground.
-A subway builder.

467
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,360
-Subway builder sounds--
-Excuse me! N.S.G.

468
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:05,238
" Niagara Steam Generation. Bought by
Eastern Gas and Electric in 1928.

469
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,585
The six-inch iron bolt was used
mainly for steam pipe assemblies."

470
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,466
You got 11 minutes.
Where are you?

471
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:01,344
We just hit the financial district.

472
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,675
There's a steam junction...

473
00:40:03,893 --> 00:40:06,051
...with big asbestos-coated pipes.

474
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,763
That's where she'll be.
I'd bet my legs on it.

475
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:10,981
She'll be at Wall and Nassau.

476
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:14,402
-Wall and Nassau.
-Has ESU been notified?

477
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,938
On their way.
They'll get there first.

478
00:40:17,324 --> 00:40:21,274
Steam is released through
that junction every day at 4 p.m.

479
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:24,160
Shit, what's this asshole up to?

480
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:27,332
I don't know, but it'll happen
in about 10 minutes.

481
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:30,792
We're here.
We're going down there.

482
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:36,297
Amelia?

483
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:38,717
Yeah, I'm here.

484
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,514
It's their job to save Mrs. Rubin.
It's yours to get ready...

485
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:45,217
...and work the crime scene
if necessary.

486
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,480
There's some things you'll need.
Look in the truck.

487
00:40:50,942 --> 00:40:53,778
You'll see an aluminum suitcase...

488
00:40:54,488 --> 00:40:56,112
...and a radio headset.

489
00:40:57,157 --> 00:40:58,189
See it?

490
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,993
Yeah, I see them.

491
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:23,807
There must be a way in.

492
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,221
-What's the problem here?
-fucking valves freeze up easy.

493
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:31,020
Come on. Shut it off!

494
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:32,398
You there?

495
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:34,018
I'm here.

496
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,739
I'm inside the pipe.

497
00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:43,695
Go!

498
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:47,828
I think I hear something.

499
00:41:48,086 --> 00:41:49,461
I hear something!

500
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,084
What's that? Someone's there.
I hear her crying!

501
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:55,919
Everyone, quiet now!

502
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:07,804
Mrs. Rubin?

503
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:12,433
Mrs. Rubin?

504
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:17,398
She's there.

505
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:19,278
Mrs. Rubin!

506
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:21,403
We're on our way in now!

507
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,115
Come on, guys. Come on.

508
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:25,869
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's hurry the fuck up!

509
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,497
Get a drill and a tap.

510
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,622
Somebody cut this halfway through.

511
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,880
There's no way to turn it off.

512
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:58,857
Back!

513
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:33,818
Paulie?

514
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,148
Paulie?

515
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:44,493
She's gone.

516
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:47,378
The whole place is scalded in steam.

517
00:43:47,712 --> 00:43:49,290
Let's go! Move away!

518
00:43:50,882 --> 00:43:54,583
ESU are gonna blow a hole
in the subbasement wall.

519
00:43:55,011 --> 00:43:58,760
I understand I'm working
with Chief Murphy's authorization.

520
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:00,221
That's right.

521
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:04,681
I don't want Emergency Services guys
in there trampling the evidence...

522
00:44:04,897 --> 00:44:06,439
...before we run the scene.

523
00:44:06,648 --> 00:44:07,597
What do you want?

524
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:10,516
When they blow the hole,
I want Donaghy in.

525
00:44:10,945 --> 00:44:15,239
She's not trained for this.
We could get our asses in a sling.

526
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:18,071
My ass has been
in a sling for four years.

527
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:21,365
Tell Hanson and his beasts
that's what I want.

528
00:44:21,915 --> 00:44:23,788
All right. You got it.

529
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,009
Okay, let's move!

530
00:44:43,354 --> 00:44:47,352
I'm doing this under protest.
The perp could still be in there!

531
00:44:47,608 --> 00:44:50,278
Rhyme's in charge,
and they're his orders.

532
00:44:50,903 --> 00:44:53,858
You can't handle it in there,
get your ass out.

533
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:55,900
Amelia, you ready?

534
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,404
You listen to me.

535
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:02,159
I'm with you every step of the way.

536
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:04,454
Go on.

537
00:45:05,544 --> 00:45:06,742
Good luck.

538
00:45:17,974 --> 00:45:20,725
-I'm in.
-Tell me what you see.

539
00:45:27,984 --> 00:45:30,309
Everything's been boiled to hell.

540
00:45:35,492 --> 00:45:36,773
Oh, God.

541
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:38,447
What is it?

542
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,572
It's an awful smell.

543
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:43,954
You're close.

544
00:46:07,734 --> 00:46:09,561
I can't believe I'm doing this.

545
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,148
You're fine.

546
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:15,564
Just fine. You're doing great.
Now, just remember the academy.

547
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:17,239
When you walk...

548
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:22,082
...move in a straight line. Don't
disturb any footprints he's left.

549
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:24,326
Yeah, assuming he's gone.

550
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:34,552
There's no footprints.

551
00:46:34,971 --> 00:46:36,549
There's nothing yet.

552
00:46:52,073 --> 00:46:53,531
Oh, God.

553
00:46:54,242 --> 00:46:55,191
What?

554
00:46:56,327 --> 00:46:57,703
Talk to me.

555
00:46:58,913 --> 00:47:00,455
Talk to me, Amelia.

556
00:47:01,124 --> 00:47:02,915
I can see her.

557
00:47:08,548 --> 00:47:10,624
The steam pipe was opened...

558
00:47:10,926 --> 00:47:13,334
...and she's tied down
right in front of it.

559
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:19,173
There's nothing you can do.
You can't do anything but help her...

560
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:22,519
...by working the crime scene.
That's your job.

561
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,850
Open your suitcase.
Get your camera.

562
00:48:09,237 --> 00:48:10,400
I can't do this.

563
00:48:11,364 --> 00:48:12,989
You can do it. Yes, you can.

564
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,818
Yesterday you stopped a train.
You can do anything you want.

565
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:19,661
Don't work me, Rhyme.

566
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:27,420
Just tell me what to do next.

567
00:48:27,632 --> 00:48:30,549
Very slowly, walk the grid...

568
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:33,633
... one foot in front of the other.

569
00:48:38,518 --> 00:48:41,555
I want you to look around you now.

570
00:48:41,772 --> 00:48:45,604
Crime scenes are three-dimensional.
floors, walls and ceilings.

571
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:54,197
Rhyme.

572
00:48:54,577 --> 00:48:55,952
Yeah, I'm here.

573
00:48:57,914 --> 00:48:59,705
There's something strange.

574
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:02,618
Things he left for us?

575
00:49:07,632 --> 00:49:08,462
Yes.

576
00:49:09,384 --> 00:49:11,127
In a cluster again?

577
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:12,755
A piece of wood...

578
00:49:13,305 --> 00:49:15,381
...and looks like some hair.

579
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:20,053
I'll walk you through collecting
the evidence. Do exactly as I say.

580
00:49:31,616 --> 00:49:33,074
Oh, Jesus.

581
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:34,944
Talk to me.

582
00:49:35,161 --> 00:49:37,320
-It's a bloody bone.
-Where is it?

583
00:49:39,374 --> 00:49:41,413
It's in my fucking hand.

584
00:49:42,252 --> 00:49:43,283
Human?

585
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,548
I think so. Yeah.

586
00:49:49,218 --> 00:49:50,498
Photograph it.

587
00:49:51,303 --> 00:49:52,466
Bag it.

588
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:12,491
Okay, that's it.

589
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:14,362
I'm out of here.

590
00:50:14,953 --> 00:50:16,780
One more thing.

591
00:50:17,456 --> 00:50:19,247
We gotta process the body.

592
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,334
What? I'm not a medical examiner.
I can't do that.

593
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:25,004
It's not an autopsy.

594
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:27,082
I just want you to....

595
00:50:27,883 --> 00:50:29,710
Just describe the restraints.

596
00:50:43,566 --> 00:50:45,440
They're strange-looking handcuffs.

597
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:48,564
They look more like
old shackles or something.

598
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:55,488
And there's a chain across her waist.

599
00:50:56,747 --> 00:50:59,618
And her feet are bound with a rope.

600
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:04,210
Hands above her head?

601
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,962
There's also a large
piece of flesh...

602
00:51:13,223 --> 00:51:15,892
...missing from her right forearm.

603
00:51:16,893 --> 00:51:20,262
It's right down to the bone.
It was surgically removed.

604
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:23,316
This is what I want you to do.

605
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:26,225
We're gonna need those handcuffs.

606
00:51:26,612 --> 00:51:29,648
It's probably our best chance
for good prints.

607
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:31,941
The M.E. can remove them.

608
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:35,950
M.E. is all thumbs.
They'll mess up the prints.

609
00:51:36,205 --> 00:51:39,740
Look in the suitcase.
There's a small saw.

610
00:51:50,303 --> 00:51:53,221
I want you to saw her hands off
at the wrist line.

611
00:51:53,682 --> 00:51:56,351
We gotta have those cuffs for prints.

612
00:52:19,709 --> 00:52:20,741
I can't.

613
00:52:21,044 --> 00:52:23,749
Cut her hands off.
We need the handcuffs.

614
00:52:24,298 --> 00:52:25,496
I can't. No.

615
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:27,632
Saw off her hands.

616
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:29,509
Take off the cuffs.

617
00:52:30,304 --> 00:52:31,217
I can't.

618
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:33,762
Listen to me.
We need those cuffs.

619
00:52:34,058 --> 00:52:35,007
I can't!

620
00:52:35,226 --> 00:52:37,633
-Amelia, we need--
-No! fuck you!

621
00:52:40,148 --> 00:52:41,143
Amelia!

622
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:42,437
Amelia!

623
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:51,648
If he wants her hands cut off,
he can come and do it himself!

624
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:28,111
That'll be $16.50.

625
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,262
Who is it?

626
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:50,869
Hey, take it easy!

627
00:56:51,996 --> 00:56:54,534
-Solomon, what are you doing?
-Are you okay?

628
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,706
What the fuck are you doing?

629
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,581
Rhyme's been trying
to call you for hours.

630
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:02,544
Your phone's down.
He was concerned.

631
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,008
My phone's fine.

632
00:57:05,218 --> 00:57:07,010
I don't need his concern.

633
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:10,212
He needs you at his place right away.

634
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:13,759
I don't work for Lincoln Rhyme.

635
00:57:15,437 --> 00:57:18,438
He thinks the evidence says
there's another vic in play.

636
00:57:19,066 --> 00:57:21,273
And he's laying that at my feet?

637
00:57:21,944 --> 00:57:23,736
Don't shoot the messenger.

638
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:47,545
Did you just move in?

639
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,555
Yeah, about a year ago.

640
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,266
Really?

641
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,120
You were a model.

642
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,910
Yeah, when I was a kid.

643
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,835
Kid model to street cop.

644
00:58:19,922 --> 00:58:20,787
There's a leap.

645
00:58:24,302 --> 00:58:26,129
for whatever it's worth...

646
00:58:28,097 --> 00:58:31,134
...l thought what you did today
was terrific.

647
00:59:13,228 --> 00:59:15,435
Hey, you guys, I'm out of here.

648
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:18,228
I'll grab a cab.
I got a paper to finish.

649
00:59:18,442 --> 00:59:19,936
-I'm gonna hang.
-No problem.

650
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:21,902
I'll be there in a minute.

651
00:59:22,822 --> 00:59:23,984
Can I finish that?

652
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,651
Go for it.

653
00:59:30,705 --> 00:59:32,329
I'll see you outside.

654
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:41,164
Taxi!

655
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,515
That bone's definitely not human.

656
00:59:53,771 --> 00:59:56,523
-And the hair?
-Not human either.

657
00:59:56,816 --> 00:59:58,191
Well, what is it?

658
00:59:58,609 --> 01:00:00,685
I'm working as fast as I can.

659
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:05,065
Glad to see you could join us.

660
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:08,826
I got Cheney on the line.
He wants you to brief him.

661
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:11,119
Tell him I'll call him back.

662
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:18,002
Two things. first, you did
a hell of a job locating the evidence.

663
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:20,704
There's no question the perp
knows forensics.

664
01:00:22,426 --> 01:00:24,882
Now, as for the other thing...

665
01:00:29,141 --> 01:00:32,059
...the victim's hands, well, maybe...

666
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,437
...it was too much to handle.
forget it.

667
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:39,442
Is that your version of an apology?

668
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,778
An apology?

669
01:00:42,447 --> 01:00:44,487
Is that why you came over here?

670
01:00:45,325 --> 01:00:46,950
You really are a piece of work.

671
01:00:47,494 --> 01:00:48,988
Well, aren't we a pair?

672
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,450
I think you're terrific.

673
01:00:57,213 --> 01:00:59,501
You got a hell of an arrest record.

674
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:04,715
High marks from all your bosses.
Definite gold-shield potential.

675
01:01:05,722 --> 01:01:08,592
Why you wanna throw it away
to chase youth offenders?

676
01:01:09,976 --> 01:01:12,218
I have no need to explain
that to you.

677
01:01:12,437 --> 01:01:13,896
Come on, cop to cop.

678
01:01:14,272 --> 01:01:17,772
Cop to cop, let's just leave it
at personal reasons.

679
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:23,071
Doesn't have anything to do
with your father, does it?

680
01:01:30,247 --> 01:01:32,039
You keep charging at walls.

681
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:34,414
Stubbornness is something
we both share.

682
01:01:36,087 --> 01:01:39,586
They say we come into this world
with a preordained destiny.

683
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:41,792
I don't believe it.

684
01:01:42,343 --> 01:01:46,009
Neither of my parents had
more than an eighth-grade education.

685
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:49,765
Never read more than one book
between them, not one.

686
01:01:50,352 --> 01:01:51,515
I've read thousands.

687
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:53,306
I've written a dozen.

688
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:54,553
What's your point?

689
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:58,939
My point is that destiny is
what you make it.

690
01:02:01,781 --> 01:02:04,735
What happened to your dad
won't necessarily happen to you.

691
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:08,737
You're a great cop.
You'd make a terrific detective.

692
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:11,872
It's a gift.

693
01:02:13,418 --> 01:02:15,209
Don't throw it away.

694
01:02:22,469 --> 01:02:24,213
Report from the Taxi Commission.

695
01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:26,921
An NYU student was abducted
last night.

696
01:02:27,182 --> 01:02:29,305
His girlfriend saw him
try to get out...

697
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,395
...as the taxi driver
hit him with a flashlight.

698
01:02:32,772 --> 01:02:34,396
No description of the driver.

699
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:37,734
Okay, everybody. This could be
our next victim.

700
01:02:42,782 --> 01:02:45,238
Did you get a deadline
off that evidence yet?

701
01:02:46,786 --> 01:02:47,866
Not yet.

702
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:50,446
That's something I hoped
you'd help me with.

703
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:20,922
Anyone for some osso buco?

704
01:04:21,636 --> 01:04:22,667
What?

705
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:26,174
The bone we found
at the Wall Street scene.

706
01:04:26,433 --> 01:04:29,767
Veal shank.
Braised and overly salted to boot.

707
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,395
A cow bone?

708
01:04:32,064 --> 01:04:35,848
I also found a piece
of that old paper...

709
01:04:36,235 --> 01:04:37,978
...embedded in the bone.

710
01:04:38,195 --> 01:04:39,310
Take a look.

711
01:04:44,285 --> 01:04:47,156
-What's going on?
-Do what you need to do quickly.

712
01:04:47,413 --> 01:04:49,572
The hair follicles,
they're not human.

713
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,534
A rodent. Probably a rat.

714
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:53,329
They were shaved off.

715
01:04:53,545 --> 01:04:55,668
We're looking for a rat that shaves.

716
01:04:56,173 --> 01:04:58,794
-I like that.
-I've known a few in my time.

717
01:04:59,176 --> 01:05:02,093
-How about you, Amelia?
-More than a few.

718
01:05:02,763 --> 01:05:05,680
He's consistent with underground,
that's for sure.

719
01:05:06,183 --> 01:05:09,801
What's he trying to say?
He's communicating in our language...

720
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,144
...leaving clues,
forensic clues at that.

721
01:05:12,565 --> 01:05:13,810
Maybe it's a cop.

722
01:05:14,859 --> 01:05:16,104
Maybe.

723
01:05:16,944 --> 01:05:19,815
Maybe he's sharing the responsibility
of these murders.

724
01:05:20,031 --> 01:05:23,032
If we don't figure out the clues,
the blood's on our hands.

725
01:05:23,535 --> 01:05:27,200
If we can't find the victim, we're as
responsible for the murders as he is.

726
01:05:27,914 --> 01:05:30,405
What do you got
on that dirt from the wood?

727
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:34,493
I don't have 100% individuated,
but it does appear nitrogen-rich.

728
01:05:34,755 --> 01:05:36,166
Ready to rock 'n' roll.

729
01:05:36,423 --> 01:05:38,749
Thanks for rushing.
I appreciate it.

730
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:41,088
Thank you, Richard.

731
01:05:41,345 --> 01:05:45,675
Nitrogen-rich, explosive carbons.
Where do you find those in New York?

732
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:47,719
Bomb sites.

733
01:05:48,436 --> 01:05:51,556
-Shooting ranges.
-Maybe an old fort or an armoury?

734
01:05:51,773 --> 01:05:53,481
Don't forget the shit factor.

735
01:05:53,858 --> 01:05:54,854
The what?

736
01:05:55,902 --> 01:05:58,607
Manure becomes a nitrate
when it's aged.

737
01:05:58,864 --> 01:06:00,026
That's true.

738
01:06:00,532 --> 01:06:02,738
Then you got cow bones, huh?

739
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:06,701
Old cow bones. Old manure.
Turn-of-the-century.

740
01:06:07,081 --> 01:06:09,868
Cows, farms, pastures.

741
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,205
Rats.

742
01:06:12,002 --> 01:06:13,580
Dead cows.

743
01:06:14,797 --> 01:06:17,335
Where do you find--?
ln stockyards.

744
01:06:19,093 --> 01:06:20,885
Look for slaughterhouses.

745
01:06:21,137 --> 01:06:24,471
Stockyards and slaughterhouses
from turn of the century.

746
01:06:24,724 --> 01:06:25,720
Check the Internet.

747
01:06:25,934 --> 01:06:30,929
I want tax records, sanitation records
and building-code inspections.

748
01:06:31,189 --> 01:06:32,814
Last 100 years. Okay?

749
01:07:16,028 --> 01:07:18,436
Man, your blood pressure is way up.

750
01:07:23,536 --> 01:07:26,206
-You're pushing it too hard.
-I understand.

751
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:29,907
-What do we got on the stockyards?
-We're almost there.

752
01:07:30,752 --> 01:07:31,582
You okay?

753
01:07:31,836 --> 01:07:33,035
No, I'm not okay.

754
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,875
I can't figure out this time line
or these shards of cardboard.

755
01:07:39,094 --> 01:07:41,217
We got three defunct stockyard sites.

756
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:44,093
One on Lexington
and the Harlem River viaduct.

757
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,974
Solomon, put the box down...

758
01:07:46,185 --> 01:07:49,768
...turn the viewer on and mark it down
as she calls them off.

759
01:07:49,981 --> 01:07:53,266
Your blood pressure will blow a gasket
if you don't slow down.

760
01:07:53,651 --> 01:07:57,352
My body has a mind of its own.
It doesn't listen to me.

761
01:07:58,072 --> 01:07:59,021
What else?

762
01:07:59,908 --> 01:08:02,778
There's another on the Hudson
up at 155th.

763
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,490
Mark it down, Solomon.

764
01:08:04,704 --> 01:08:06,412
Your sats are going down.

765
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:08,741
You saw him have a seizure.

766
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:09,789
What else?

767
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,919
There's one underground
at Greenwich and Houston.

768
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,037
Mark it down.

769
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:18,088
-Why don't you knock it off?
-I don't need to knock it off!

770
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:31,054
What was the first one you mentioned?

771
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,605
Lexington and
the Harlem River viaduct.

772
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,017
When did it close?

773
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:36,232
1910.

774
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,727
Okay, what about...

775
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,442
...Houston and Greenwich?

776
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:41,815
1898.

777
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:45,570
And Hudson and 155th
was closed in 1906.

778
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,750
1906, 1898--

779
01:08:51,087 --> 01:08:53,838
All right, let's....
1898.

780
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:58,541
Houston and Greenwich. Call
Emergency Services and tell them...

781
01:08:59,429 --> 01:09:01,718
...to meet us
at Houston and Greenwich.

782
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:05,301
Solomon, you get on to Hanson.
He'll need about 20 guys.

783
01:09:07,938 --> 01:09:08,969
You go with them.

784
01:09:09,398 --> 01:09:10,643
Let's go.

785
01:09:30,336 --> 01:09:31,795
Linc, you there?

786
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:33,912
Yeah, ready.

787
01:09:34,174 --> 01:09:35,454
We're here.

788
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:44,015
All right. Same drill.
I want you in first.

789
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:47,556
Let's do it.

790
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,253
You watch yourself, Amelia.

791
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:22,138
Oh, man. I don't like this.

792
01:10:22,766 --> 01:10:24,676
I don't like this.

793
01:10:27,855 --> 01:10:29,978
I got a bad feeling about this.

794
01:10:30,942 --> 01:10:33,231
All three of us ought to
get in there.

795
01:10:33,444 --> 01:10:35,188
Not yet. Just hold back.

796
01:10:42,162 --> 01:10:44,036
I'm going down some stairs.

797
01:10:46,792 --> 01:10:48,452
Cement walls.

798
01:10:54,133 --> 01:10:55,757
Wood crates.

799
01:10:56,343 --> 01:10:57,838
Large columns.

800
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:02,631
Smells like manure down here.

801
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:05,100
Ortiz sure knows his shit.

802
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:08,271
Always has.

803
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:12,025
Metal hooks...

804
01:11:13,361 --> 01:11:14,560
...and a pen.

805
01:11:15,822 --> 01:11:17,649
It's a slaughterhouse.

806
01:11:35,885 --> 01:11:37,048
ESU are here.

807
01:11:37,262 --> 01:11:40,428
Hold them off. Don't want them
contaminating the scene.

808
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:44,557
All right, hold it.
Hold up. Hold up.

809
01:11:44,769 --> 01:11:46,228
-You're not to go in.
-Why?

810
01:11:46,438 --> 01:11:49,724
-Rhyme's orders.
-fuck him! Get me Cheney on the line.

811
01:11:50,776 --> 01:11:52,235
Crime scene C. O. on air.

812
01:11:52,986 --> 01:11:56,652
-Switch to channel 2-2 for ESU.
-fuck Rhyme.

813
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:08,954
Maybe this one's still alive.

814
01:12:09,379 --> 01:12:11,253
Perp didn't leave a deadline.

815
01:12:11,464 --> 01:12:12,923
What does that mean?

816
01:12:14,426 --> 01:12:16,086
We're probably too late.

817
01:12:16,303 --> 01:12:17,880
You don't know that, Rhyme.

818
01:12:18,221 --> 01:12:20,013
Get off the line.

819
01:12:21,433 --> 01:12:23,141
Let's move on, Amelia.

820
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:28,975
There's 5 basic contaminants
to every crime scene.

821
01:12:29,233 --> 01:12:31,439
I'll skip to the worst one.

822
01:12:31,986 --> 01:12:33,564
Other cops.

823
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,114
I think I hear something.

824
01:12:46,585 --> 01:12:48,376
I hate this shit.

825
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:59,097
I see something.

826
01:13:19,035 --> 01:13:20,150
I think I found him.

827
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:23,076
I can't tell if he's alive.

828
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,582
Oh, Jesus. He's covered in rats.

829
01:13:30,714 --> 01:13:32,173
They're all over him.

830
01:13:42,977 --> 01:13:45,350
-We're going in.
-No, you're not!

831
01:13:51,945 --> 01:13:53,274
Go! Go!

832
01:13:53,488 --> 01:13:56,110
Central, we have shots fired.
Shots fired.

833
01:14:13,134 --> 01:14:16,384
You were right. We never had a shot.

834
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,014
He cut him up pretty bad
and left him for the rats.

835
01:14:22,602 --> 01:14:24,891
There's a cut in his leg
down to the bone.

836
01:14:26,273 --> 01:14:28,681
The blood attracted the rats.

837
01:14:33,989 --> 01:14:36,065
Goddamn son of a bitch.

838
01:14:45,043 --> 01:14:46,205
You okay?

839
01:14:54,302 --> 01:14:55,797
I'm fine.

840
01:14:56,722 --> 01:14:58,549
Step aside so I can walk the grid.

841
01:15:03,354 --> 01:15:05,227
Let's give her some room.

842
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:07,059
Move it, guys.

843
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:10,814
Rhyme, I'm gonna walk the grid.

844
01:15:13,406 --> 01:15:14,984
You know what to do.

845
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:36,961
I found it.

846
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:39,135
Another cluster.

847
01:15:40,059 --> 01:15:42,348
A piece of old paper
like the other two.

848
01:15:42,728 --> 01:15:44,187
And a matchbox.

849
01:15:45,148 --> 01:15:47,555
Bring that black suitcase over here.

850
01:15:50,528 --> 01:15:52,568
Pull out the brown envelope.

851
01:15:56,868 --> 01:15:59,620
Sounds like you're starting
to enjoy this work.

852
01:16:05,085 --> 01:16:07,327
Damn! The press is here.

853
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:12,165
Park it right there.

854
01:16:15,847 --> 01:16:19,547
Lincoln Rhyme is no longer working
this case. I'm taking over.

855
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:23,510
Do what you want to do, but you
ought to check with Murphy first.

856
01:16:23,772 --> 01:16:25,681
fuck Murphy and fuck Rhyme.

857
01:16:26,191 --> 01:16:29,726
This has been cleared downtown.
We got a dead kid on our hands...

858
01:16:29,945 --> 01:16:33,195
...and I, for one, am not taking
the heat for that.

859
01:16:33,991 --> 01:16:37,526
Tell Ortiz and his crew to vacate
Rhyme's place tonight.

860
01:16:38,037 --> 01:16:40,279
The victim was already dead
when we arrived.

861
01:16:40,539 --> 01:16:43,790
And you, half-assed patrolman
working a crime scene...

862
01:16:44,252 --> 01:16:45,794
...those days are over.

863
01:16:46,003 --> 01:16:47,996
I'll take that evidence bag now.

864
01:16:48,297 --> 01:16:50,789
You can take it with
a chain-of-custody voucher.

865
01:16:53,511 --> 01:16:55,219
Are you out of your mind?

866
01:17:00,143 --> 01:17:01,970
Let's go. You're coming with us.

867
01:17:02,187 --> 01:17:03,468
Are you arresting me?

868
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:07,182
Just get in the car
and keep your mouth shut to the press.

869
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:24,959
You won't find any prints.
He's too good for that.

870
01:17:32,803 --> 01:17:36,172
It looks like we have a nice,
clean friction print.

871
01:17:37,516 --> 01:17:39,509
Unless of course, it's yours.

872
01:17:40,769 --> 01:17:42,762
No, I was wearing gloves.

873
01:17:43,355 --> 01:17:45,147
We'll know soon enough.

874
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:47,066
Put this through.
Highest priority.

875
01:17:47,318 --> 01:17:49,311
-You got it.
-Thank you.

876
01:18:00,624 --> 01:18:03,744
This perp's been
in business for a long time.

877
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,246
I hear you, but you know,
it's Cheney's problem now.

878
01:18:07,756 --> 01:18:09,548
Yeah, that's what scares me.

879
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,501
See if there's been
any homicides in the last 12 months...

880
01:18:13,721 --> 01:18:17,469
...involving surgically-removed flesh
exposing bone.

881
01:18:18,809 --> 01:18:20,387
No problem.

882
01:18:21,437 --> 01:18:22,267
See you soon.

883
01:18:22,563 --> 01:18:23,726
Hope so, Eddie.

884
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,894
Thelma, don't you let him
run no circles around you.

885
01:18:27,152 --> 01:18:28,943
Stay right, Eddie.

886
01:18:47,506 --> 01:18:51,456
Oh, that print. We just got
a positive I.D. on it.

887
01:18:52,512 --> 01:18:56,260
The guy has three
extremely violent priors.

888
01:18:56,557 --> 01:18:58,135
Oh, look at that.

889
01:18:58,351 --> 01:19:00,011
Taxi license, no less.

890
01:19:00,228 --> 01:19:01,473
We got him.

891
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:02,928
Let's go, boys!

892
01:19:03,148 --> 01:19:04,428
Somebody call ESU.

893
01:19:22,418 --> 01:19:25,621
Now slide out, nice and easy.

894
01:19:38,769 --> 01:19:40,477
That explains your print.

895
01:19:57,872 --> 01:19:59,865
He's hoping you'd show up.

896
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:04,037
He's been worried about you.

897
01:20:04,295 --> 01:20:05,671
Yeah, sure.

898
01:20:13,514 --> 01:20:15,672
I didn't expect to see you again.

899
01:20:17,267 --> 01:20:18,678
Poor Cheney, huh?

900
01:20:18,936 --> 01:20:22,186
Grabbed the ball with both hands,
scored for the other team.

901
01:20:23,774 --> 01:20:26,978
I warned him that the perp was
too smart to leave a print.

902
01:20:27,862 --> 01:20:29,689
How you doing with that stuff?

903
01:20:30,907 --> 01:20:32,401
Not too good.

904
01:20:33,076 --> 01:20:36,575
Two pieces of the puzzle,
but I don't know what it means.

905
01:20:38,915 --> 01:20:40,742
Maybe this'll help.

906
01:20:42,044 --> 01:20:44,167
Cheney will have your badge for that.

907
01:20:44,379 --> 01:20:46,917
He wouldn't give me
a voucher. What could I do?

908
01:20:47,508 --> 01:20:48,883
You could take it back to him.

909
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:52,675
The man is a living monument
to ineptitude.

910
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:55,178
True. Let's take a look.

911
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:58,058
What do you got there?

912
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:01,808
Third piece of the puzzle.

913
01:21:02,398 --> 01:21:05,150
There's something really strange
about it, though.

914
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,652
You gotta smell it.

915
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,561
Sure.

916
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,317
-Well, you--
-Shoot.

917
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,122
Sorry.

918
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,454
It's okay. Take your time.

919
01:21:34,224 --> 01:21:36,845
You have to put it closer to my nose.

920
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:42,605
What do you think it is?

921
01:21:44,526 --> 01:21:45,724
Kerosene?

922
01:21:48,614 --> 01:21:49,989
Possibly.

923
01:21:50,824 --> 01:21:52,947
This just came in from Eddie Ortiz.

924
01:21:53,202 --> 01:21:55,823
Could you load these
into the computer for me?

925
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,907
Sorry about that, Thelma.

926
01:21:58,624 --> 01:22:00,202
ECU.

927
01:22:00,459 --> 01:22:01,870
View scan.

928
01:22:03,212 --> 01:22:06,795
" Dear Linc, I am enclosing photos
of four unsolved homicides...

929
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:09,208
...which took place
in the last 12 months.

930
01:22:09,469 --> 01:22:12,838
flesh has been removed
from the victims' extremities.

931
01:22:13,098 --> 01:22:15,340
I miss you. Love, Eddie."

932
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,352
I'll spare myself the pleasure
if you don't mind.

933
01:22:21,648 --> 01:22:22,929
Zoom.

934
01:22:26,028 --> 01:22:27,522
Same mark.

935
01:22:28,614 --> 01:22:29,480
Right.

936
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:31,486
Zoom.

937
01:22:31,784 --> 01:22:32,947
Zoom.

938
01:22:34,287 --> 01:22:35,236
Zoom.

939
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:41,083
Same messages.

940
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,288
It's him.

941
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:50,464
He was trying to make
contact even then.

942
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:54,387
But Cheney never put it together.

943
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:02,979
Dysreflexia seizure. A bad one.

944
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:05,725
Hang on. Hang on.
Breathe, Rhyme.

945
01:23:05,945 --> 01:23:07,356
Come on, breathe with me.

946
01:23:07,739 --> 01:23:09,731
Damn catheter's blocked.

947
01:23:10,116 --> 01:23:14,446
Just let me get a BP on you.
Stay with me! Breathe.

948
01:23:14,704 --> 01:23:16,364
Hang on. Hang on.

949
01:23:16,623 --> 01:23:18,497
Just let me check you.

950
01:23:20,127 --> 01:23:23,044
Diastolic's over 125.
I gotta get it down now.

951
01:23:29,345 --> 01:23:33,390
Just give it a few seconds to work.
Come on, breathe with me.

952
01:23:39,105 --> 01:23:40,303
Come on.

953
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:44,729
Hang on, man.

954
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:46,981
Is he gonna make it?

955
01:23:47,781 --> 01:23:49,690
If he does, he won't be happy.

956
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:53,451
What are you talking about?

957
01:23:54,955 --> 01:23:57,790
He's finalized arrangements
to self-terminate.

958
01:24:01,462 --> 01:24:06,338
He convinced some doctor to help with
his final transition, as he calls it.

959
01:24:07,802 --> 01:24:09,130
But suicide?

960
01:24:09,387 --> 01:24:11,047
It's the seizures.

961
01:24:11,598 --> 01:24:15,298
Any one of them could put him
into a vegetative state.

962
01:24:16,186 --> 01:24:18,891
That's what he fears
more than anything.

963
01:24:22,693 --> 01:24:23,523
Who is it?

964
01:24:24,111 --> 01:24:25,570
Captain Cheney.

965
01:24:26,071 --> 01:24:27,186
Can I help you?

966
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,948
Police business. Open up.

967
01:24:30,451 --> 01:24:32,111
Mr. Rhyme is asleep.

968
01:24:32,912 --> 01:24:35,699
Well, wake him up.
I need to see him now.

969
01:24:38,835 --> 01:24:41,123
Let me deal with this asshole.
You watch him.

970
01:24:41,379 --> 01:24:43,835
Anything, just call me.
He's all right.

971
01:24:52,724 --> 01:24:54,053
Look, lady.

972
01:24:54,309 --> 01:24:58,058
I hope you know that obstructing
justice is a felony offense.

973
01:24:58,272 --> 01:24:59,552
Look, don't " lady" me.

974
01:24:59,773 --> 01:25:03,024
Unless you have a warrant,
you can't come in here.

975
01:25:03,277 --> 01:25:04,392
I'm coming in.

976
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:08,320
I have reason to believe
there's stolen evidence in there.

977
01:25:09,784 --> 01:25:11,777
What's your full name?

978
01:25:12,328 --> 01:25:13,739
Thelma what?

979
01:25:14,247 --> 01:25:15,706
So you wanna get official?

980
01:25:16,499 --> 01:25:18,373
What did you say your name was?

981
01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:25,548
You got a smart mouth
and it'll get you in trouble.

982
01:25:25,759 --> 01:25:29,424
It may bite your ass if you don't stop
aggravating my patient.

983
01:25:29,888 --> 01:25:32,296
I'm gonna leave now, but I'll be back.

984
01:25:32,516 --> 01:25:35,470
And when I come back,
it'll be with a warrant.

985
01:25:51,328 --> 01:25:53,201
And I looked everywhere.

986
01:25:53,455 --> 01:25:56,076
And I thought the conductor
would be angry.

987
01:25:56,291 --> 01:25:59,541
And I kept searching everywhere,
and finally...

988
01:25:59,795 --> 01:26:01,704
...it was right on my lap.

989
01:26:06,177 --> 01:26:08,798
Grandma can't wait to see you,
you know.

990
01:27:03,111 --> 01:27:04,274
What'd I do?

991
01:27:04,488 --> 01:27:07,109
You're carrying a fare
and your metre's not on...

992
01:27:07,366 --> 01:27:09,774
...and your hack license is
not properly--

993
01:28:13,102 --> 01:28:16,637
There's laws against molesting
the handicapped, you know.

994
01:28:24,614 --> 01:28:26,654
I wasn't a pretty sight, was I?

995
01:28:32,789 --> 01:28:35,707
Thelma told me about
your final transition.

996
01:28:40,506 --> 01:28:43,673
Cop to cop, that subject's
not open to discussion.

997
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:48,048
Why? Would you miss me?

998
01:28:49,056 --> 01:28:51,892
Well, destiny's what we make it,
right?

999
01:28:54,145 --> 01:28:55,224
Touch.

1000
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,564
You seem to have your reasons
for "checking out."

1001
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:01,143
I expected more
from someone like you.

1002
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:03,443
Well, I might surprise you...

1003
01:29:05,115 --> 01:29:06,194
...and live forever.

1004
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:08,782
Nothing you'd do
would surprise me.

1005
01:29:09,036 --> 01:29:11,906
Well, look who's still
in the land of the living.

1006
01:29:12,623 --> 01:29:13,786
for the moment.

1007
01:29:13,999 --> 01:29:16,455
Cheney was here
huffing and puffing.

1008
01:29:16,669 --> 01:29:20,252
-He promised to return with a warrant.
-Sorry I missed him.

1009
01:29:21,549 --> 01:29:23,209
If that's him, tell him...

1010
01:29:23,468 --> 01:29:25,875
-Say no more.
-...l'm skiing.

1011
01:29:28,264 --> 01:29:30,174
Hey, Paulie. Hang on.

1012
01:29:31,101 --> 01:29:33,426
I don't know if it's
just a coincidence...

1013
01:29:33,687 --> 01:29:37,305
...but an inspector was killed
by a cabby who was off the metre.

1014
01:29:37,524 --> 01:29:41,107
The thing is, a male witness
who wouldn't give his name...

1015
01:29:41,361 --> 01:29:44,944
...saw the taxi with
an old man and a little girl inside.

1016
01:29:45,157 --> 01:29:46,949
Probably the doer that called.

1017
01:29:47,535 --> 01:29:49,112
Jesus, he's got a kid.

1018
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:51,328
And an old man.

1019
01:29:52,123 --> 01:29:53,403
Thank you, Paulie.

1020
01:29:54,834 --> 01:29:57,918
We'd better look closer
at that third piece of the puzzle.

1021
01:29:58,171 --> 01:29:59,546
Close.

1022
01:30:00,173 --> 01:30:03,708
Three murders.
Three evidence clusters.

1023
01:30:05,428 --> 01:30:07,468
Three pieces of paper.

1024
01:30:07,681 --> 01:30:09,092
View scan.

1025
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:24,729
You're the queen of puzzles.
What do you see?

1026
01:30:26,451 --> 01:30:28,360
I'm looking. I'm looking.

1027
01:30:29,037 --> 01:30:30,697
Lower the little one.

1028
01:30:31,748 --> 01:30:32,911
That one.

1029
01:30:38,338 --> 01:30:40,082
Twist that big one around.

1030
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:56,272
Doesn't that kind of look like a face?
Mouth, nose, eye.

1031
01:30:56,899 --> 01:30:57,895
Enhance.

1032
01:30:59,402 --> 01:31:00,647
fade.

1033
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:04,402
A woman's face.

1034
01:31:07,619 --> 01:31:09,244
Yes, it is.

1035
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:11,908
It's a logo.

1036
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,238
An old...

1037
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:16,494
...turn-of-the-century...

1038
01:31:16,712 --> 01:31:18,503
...publisher's logo.

1039
01:31:19,215 --> 01:31:20,460
You know it?

1040
01:31:21,467 --> 01:31:25,251
I used to own a few of the books.
Gothic stories.

1041
01:31:26,889 --> 01:31:28,348
Crime stories.

1042
01:31:29,475 --> 01:31:32,346
The killer is pointing us
to an old book.

1043
01:31:58,256 --> 01:31:59,880
Can I help you?

1044
01:32:03,803 --> 01:32:06,010
I called about old crime books.

1045
01:32:06,973 --> 01:32:09,298
Around the corner. Help yourself.

1046
01:32:10,185 --> 01:32:11,560
Thanks.

1047
01:33:30,645 --> 01:33:32,684
Aviation Two to Central.

1048
01:33:32,897 --> 01:33:35,649
We're taking a flyby
at the Brooklyn Bridge.

1049
01:33:35,858 --> 01:33:39,144
Report appears unfounded
at this time.

1050
01:33:39,612 --> 01:33:42,613
Will check East River
shoreline and advise.

1051
01:33:42,866 --> 01:33:45,820
I need more small boats
to search under the piers.

1052
01:33:46,036 --> 01:33:48,609
By the heliport. Under the piers.

1053
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,496
It was the last murder in the book.

1054
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,790
They've gotta be along the shore.

1055
01:33:54,044 --> 01:33:56,500
Listen, the lab says
the odour we smelled...

1056
01:33:56,714 --> 01:34:00,130
...on the third piece of the puzzle is
probably diesel fuel.

1057
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:04,631
There's an old boat refuelling station
at the Staten Island Ferry pier.

1058
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:07,510
Check the pilings under the pier.

1059
01:34:54,191 --> 01:34:55,104
found them!

1060
01:34:56,193 --> 01:34:57,106
Over here!

1061
01:34:57,319 --> 01:34:58,648
Here!

1062
01:34:59,488 --> 01:35:00,318
Here!

1063
01:35:00,698 --> 01:35:02,489
I can see someone with a light...

1064
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:06,318
...signalling us from
the old Staten Island Ferry pier.

1065
01:35:06,579 --> 01:35:09,663
There appears to be two bodies
in the water.

1066
01:35:17,048 --> 01:35:20,714
Be advised, subject signalling is
most likely NYPD officer.

1067
01:35:25,974 --> 01:35:26,804
Over here!

1068
01:35:27,184 --> 01:35:28,643
Here!

1069
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,020
Watch the pilings!

1070
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,277
We've got divers
coming in to you now.

1071
01:35:48,915 --> 01:35:49,994
Over to the ladder.

1072
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:56,417
Be advised, aideds are
out of the water...

1073
01:35:56,632 --> 01:35:59,668
...and ESU is working on them
at this time.

1074
01:36:06,392 --> 01:36:07,720
Rhyme, are you there?

1075
01:36:09,937 --> 01:36:11,266
We're too late.

1076
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,934
forget it. He's dead.

1077
01:36:17,654 --> 01:36:18,852
The old man's gone.

1078
01:36:19,906 --> 01:36:22,860
They're working on the girl,
but it doesn't look good.

1079
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:29,537
Try again.
I know she's still there.

1080
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:32,283
Come on, kid. Come on. Try for me.

1081
01:36:33,462 --> 01:36:35,289
Come on. You can do it.

1082
01:36:35,881 --> 01:36:37,044
Come on.

1083
01:36:37,717 --> 01:36:39,127
Breathe.

1084
01:36:39,594 --> 01:36:41,218
Breathe.

1085
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,845
She's breathing.

1086
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:50,061
She'll be okay.
She's breathing. Can you hear me?

1087
01:36:50,397 --> 01:36:53,517
-I think she's gonna make it.
-Good. Good.

1088
01:36:55,402 --> 01:36:58,688
You gotta find the clues
that he left for us.

1089
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:02,110
See what you can find
around the fuel tanks.

1090
01:37:02,368 --> 01:37:03,530
All right.

1091
01:37:28,145 --> 01:37:29,224
I found it.

1092
01:37:30,355 --> 01:37:33,273
It's a map of some kind,
some chunk of a clean bone...

1093
01:37:33,484 --> 01:37:36,438
...and a piece of a medal
or a badge or something.

1094
01:37:39,031 --> 01:37:41,569
There's initials engraved.
It looks like...

1095
01:37:42,076 --> 01:37:44,282
...a P and a B.

1096
01:37:46,622 --> 01:37:48,081
It's definitely a D.

1097
01:37:49,042 --> 01:37:50,999
P.D. Sounds like a cop's badge.

1098
01:37:52,337 --> 01:37:53,831
Think he'll kill a cop?

1099
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:56,465
Could be.

1100
01:37:58,635 --> 01:37:59,798
Maps?

1101
01:38:01,763 --> 01:38:03,507
Tell me about the map.

1102
01:38:04,391 --> 01:38:06,135
Looks like an old subway map.

1103
01:38:07,144 --> 01:38:09,101
I don't recognize the stations.

1104
01:38:10,731 --> 01:38:13,401
When I scanned asbestos sites,
I came across...

1105
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:16,065
...stations that aren't
in use anymore.

1106
01:38:16,779 --> 01:38:18,986
There it is. The oldest station.

1107
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:23,784
On your map, is there an old station
indicated at the tip of Manhattan?

1108
01:38:26,873 --> 01:38:28,202
Navy Street.

1109
01:38:29,626 --> 01:38:31,500
It's right next to the pier.

1110
01:38:31,753 --> 01:38:32,998
Oh, shit.

1111
01:38:33,213 --> 01:38:34,838
Cheney's here.

1112
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:42,513
You talking to Rhyme on that thing?
Give me the radio.

1113
01:38:44,433 --> 01:38:47,885
This is Cheney. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1114
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:50,602
Stealing evidence is
a goddamn felony.

1115
01:38:50,857 --> 01:38:53,430
I understand there's no
chain-of-evidence voucher.

1116
01:38:53,693 --> 01:38:55,852
Oh, yeah? I got some news for you.

1117
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:58,402
You're not a cop anymore.
Understand?

1118
01:38:58,907 --> 01:39:01,398
What you are is
a fucking meddling cripple.

1119
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:04,532
I'm gonna place your little gofer
under arrest.

1120
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:06,538
You don't mind that, do you?

1121
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:09,244
Lock her up.

1122
01:39:11,629 --> 01:39:13,004
Where'd she go?

1123
01:39:37,698 --> 01:39:39,690
I'm inside the Navy Street tunnel.

1124
01:39:39,908 --> 01:39:42,945
There's grey dust everywhere.
It's all over my shoes.

1125
01:39:49,377 --> 01:39:50,539
There's footprints.

1126
01:39:51,254 --> 01:39:52,831
One set of footprints.

1127
01:39:58,678 --> 01:40:02,047
The mobile unit you've called
is not responding.

1128
01:40:02,307 --> 01:40:03,470
Re-call.

1129
01:41:04,664 --> 01:41:06,040
No dust.

1130
01:41:06,291 --> 01:41:08,118
He changed the numbers.

1131
01:41:09,169 --> 01:41:11,494
7-8-4-9-9. What is that?

1132
01:41:12,256 --> 01:41:14,379
7-8-4-9-9.

1133
01:41:15,801 --> 01:41:17,082
What does it mean?

1134
01:41:17,678 --> 01:41:19,386
What does it mean?

1135
01:41:37,574 --> 01:41:39,697
Help me, Rhyme. Help me.

1136
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:57,968
He's gonna kill Rhyme.

1137
01:42:20,536 --> 01:42:21,947
Coming.

1138
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:30,081
Hey, what are you doing here?

1139
01:42:53,946 --> 01:42:55,321
Is that Amelia?

1140
01:42:59,160 --> 01:42:59,990
Bed mode.

1141
01:43:18,847 --> 01:43:20,555
Thelma, is that you?

1142
01:43:28,149 --> 01:43:30,141
No, it's me. Richard.

1143
01:43:31,486 --> 01:43:33,313
Richard? What's up?

1144
01:43:34,197 --> 01:43:37,613
Thelma asked me to
check the heart-pacing machine.

1145
01:43:49,379 --> 01:43:50,494
Where is Thelma?

1146
01:43:50,756 --> 01:43:52,250
Out in the hall.

1147
01:44:10,568 --> 01:44:11,897
Phone mode.

1148
01:44:21,330 --> 01:44:23,951
It was time we had
a quiet moment together.

1149
01:44:24,208 --> 01:44:26,781
You and I, no interruptions.

1150
01:44:28,379 --> 01:44:29,790
What's on your mind?

1151
01:44:30,047 --> 01:44:32,918
I think it's time to set
the record straight.

1152
01:44:34,469 --> 01:44:36,046
Syracuse.

1153
01:44:36,304 --> 01:44:38,760
You remember Syracuse, don't you?

1154
01:44:39,682 --> 01:44:41,556
You wrote an expert opinion.

1155
01:44:41,935 --> 01:44:43,678
I wrote thousands of opinions.

1156
01:44:43,979 --> 01:44:47,312
Don't fucking tell me
you don't remember Syracuse.

1157
01:44:47,607 --> 01:44:50,478
They called it an investigation.
It was a witch hunt.

1158
01:44:51,153 --> 01:44:55,020
There was a forensics cop
up in Syracuse, New York.

1159
01:44:55,616 --> 01:44:57,194
Marcus Andrews.

1160
01:44:57,618 --> 01:45:00,156
Okay, that was the cop
that was suspected...

1161
01:45:00,413 --> 01:45:03,616
...of tampering with evidence
in some homicide cases.

1162
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:07,208
-Nothing was tampered with.
-Six innocent people went to jail.

1163
01:45:07,628 --> 01:45:11,294
They went to jail because
they were guilty. They were scum.

1164
01:45:11,549 --> 01:45:14,420
-He doctored the reports.
-Nothing was doctored.

1165
01:45:14,678 --> 01:45:16,386
He planted blood evidence.

1166
01:45:16,596 --> 01:45:19,004
My work was impeccable.

1167
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:22,177
Where are we going with this...

1168
01:45:24,104 --> 01:45:25,682
...Marcus?

1169
01:45:30,236 --> 01:45:32,525
Your report destroyed my life.

1170
01:45:32,738 --> 01:45:34,861
My report was not a legal finding.

1171
01:45:35,116 --> 01:45:38,449
-You never let me defend myself.
-I never even met you.

1172
01:45:38,661 --> 01:45:41,152
I was sent to prison for six years!

1173
01:45:41,623 --> 01:45:43,829
I spent two more years
getting to you.

1174
01:45:44,084 --> 01:45:46,753
Do you know what happens
to a cop in jail?

1175
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:50,088
Every day, every single day...

1176
01:45:50,507 --> 01:45:55,003
...over and over, I was brutalized.
I became a human toilet...

1177
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:56,880
...because of your expert opinion.

1178
01:45:57,097 --> 01:46:01,558
Well, you will never point the finger
of blame at anyone ever again.

1179
01:46:03,646 --> 01:46:06,102
You were never as good as they said.

1180
01:46:06,315 --> 01:46:08,688
I played you. I tested you.

1181
01:46:08,901 --> 01:46:10,645
I gave you every clue.

1182
01:46:10,903 --> 01:46:13,145
You and your helper
couldn't save them.

1183
01:46:13,406 --> 01:46:15,731
Their blood is on your hands.
You failed.

1184
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:17,742
You failed, you fuck.

1185
01:46:17,953 --> 01:46:21,404
Game of chess, Mr. Rhyme.
Some people win. Some people lose.

1186
01:46:21,665 --> 01:46:24,452
I win, Mr. Rhyme. I win. You lose.

1187
01:46:28,505 --> 01:46:30,878
Which vegetable
would you like to be?

1188
01:46:31,634 --> 01:46:32,464
A carrot?

1189
01:46:36,472 --> 01:46:38,097
How about a zucchini?

1190
01:46:40,643 --> 01:46:41,509
Zucchini?

1191
01:46:41,853 --> 01:46:43,228
You wanna be a zucchini?

1192
01:46:44,606 --> 01:46:46,563
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

1193
01:46:47,525 --> 01:46:49,518
Did you say zucchini?

1194
01:47:27,025 --> 01:47:28,733
You want to play?

1195
01:47:40,998 --> 01:47:43,536
Shall we cut out your tongue,
Mr. Rhyme?

1196
01:47:44,961 --> 01:47:47,084
How about your eye? Your eye?

1197
01:47:47,297 --> 01:47:49,373
I'll just pop it out of there.

1198
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,376
Let's leave that for now.

1199
01:47:51,593 --> 01:47:52,921
You can watch me.

1200
01:47:53,178 --> 01:47:57,591
You can watch me while I gut you
open right down the middle.

1201
01:48:02,938 --> 01:48:04,183
What?

1202
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:08,354
What?

1203
01:48:46,275 --> 01:48:47,556
Can you hear me?

1204
01:48:49,612 --> 01:48:51,320
Oh, God.

1205
01:48:55,368 --> 01:48:57,610
Step aside.
We'll take care of him.

1206
01:49:49,801 --> 01:49:53,668
-I've always loved this view.
-I like it too, doc.

1207
01:49:54,764 --> 01:49:57,006
It's looking better every day.

1208
01:49:58,435 --> 01:49:59,633
How you guys doing?

1209
01:49:59,853 --> 01:50:01,181
Good.

1210
01:50:07,528 --> 01:50:09,816
You got an operating license for that?

1211
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:12,237
I got a learner's permit.

1212
01:50:18,873 --> 01:50:22,076
-How's your boyfriend?
-He's in florida. He play golf.

1213
01:50:22,335 --> 01:50:23,663
Playing golf?

1214
01:50:23,878 --> 01:50:25,787
Captain flash on wheels.

1215
01:50:26,005 --> 01:50:28,710
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1216
01:50:28,967 --> 01:50:31,636
If you be cruising,
you might as well be amusing.

1217
01:50:32,095 --> 01:50:34,254
-There you go.
-Thank you, Eddie.

1218
01:50:38,977 --> 01:50:39,807
Come on in.

1219
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:41,847
Merry Christmas.

1220
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:48,814
-You're looking good there, Mr. Rhyme.
-Mr. Rhyme?

1221
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:51,865
It's Lincoln to you.
Loosen your shorts.

1222
01:50:55,161 --> 01:50:57,070
Oh, my goodness.

1223
01:50:57,455 --> 01:51:00,456
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing here?

1224
01:51:00,917 --> 01:51:03,587
-Merry Christmas, Uncle Linc.
-Give me a kiss.

1225
01:51:03,795 --> 01:51:06,251
Merry Christmas, Kimmy. How are you?

1226
01:51:06,506 --> 01:51:07,538
How you doing, Tony?

1227
01:51:07,799 --> 01:51:10,125
I didn't know you'd make this trip.

1228
01:51:10,344 --> 01:51:12,253
Wouldn't be a surprise if you knew.

1229
01:51:12,471 --> 01:51:16,089
I'm sorry. Amelia, this is
my sister, Janine. Her family.

1230
01:51:16,350 --> 01:51:17,928
Yeah, I know. Hi.

1231
01:51:18,185 --> 01:51:19,514
You know?

1232
01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:20,636
We've met.

1233
01:51:21,147 --> 01:51:23,555
On the phone. How you doing?

1234
01:51:26,653 --> 01:51:28,562
Merry Christmas, Lincoln.

1235
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,411
Merry Christmas.
