with the medical directory?

than a dozen physicians
in the general area.

there would have been
at least a hundred.

inconceivable that any physician
could be remotely connected...

to a hospital near reading.

says, it's more like an asylum.

took a turn for the worse,

does he face?

Will the masons

You surely don't suggest
that her majesty is
in any way involved.

I cannot easily believe that.

- I would prefer
 some more reliable authority.

I shall ignore your
offensive attitude.

would that satisfy you?

Yes,resign.
 and if I had the means,
 I would compel you.

prove your complicity,
I would not hesitate,

to your secret councils.

you are responsible.

with you, Mr. Holmes, she died.

convince me,
