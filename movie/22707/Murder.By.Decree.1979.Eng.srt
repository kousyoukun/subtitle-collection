BETTER WE SHOULD MEET HERE.
WE CAN BE SURE OF PRIVACY.

1183

"SECRECY" WOULD PERHAPS BE
THE MORE APPROPRIATE WORD.

UPON "DISCRETION"?

TO THE HOME SECRETARY.

I HAVE INDICATED SOMETHING
OF THE MATTER TO HIM, YES.

I HAVE SUMMONED YOU HERE

MADE STATEMENTS...

EXISTENCE OF THE SOCIAL ORDER
OF THIS COUNTRY.

CONVINCE ME
OF YOUR ABILITY TO
TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTION.

YOU HAVE ME
AT A DISADVANTAGE, MR. HOLMES.

1196

IF YOU TELL US YOUR STORY
IN YOUR OWN WAY...

THE JUDGE OF WHETHER
IT IS TRUE OR NOT.

YOU MAY TAKE IT
TO BE TRUE, SIR.

I SEE YOU RECOGNIZE
THAT NAME, HOME SECRETARY.

1202

IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT
WOULD SURPRISE ME, SINCE SHE
IS A WOMAN OF THE LOWER CLASSES,

1203

HOW DOES ANNIE CROOK
CONCERN ANYONE HERE?

1209
01:46:24,644 --> 01:46:27,681
I FOUND HER.

1210
01:46:27,681 --> 01:46:31,184
SHE TOLD ME SOME FRAGMENTS
OF HER PATHETIC STORY.

1211
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:33,353
SHE MET HER LOVER...

WHERE SHE WAS EMPLOYED.

BRIEFLY WITH HER.

WITH HER GENTLENESS,
HER BEAUTY AND HER INNOCENCE.

[ Man ]
AND IN THE FACE OF
THIS CONGREGATION--

1217

HE WENT THROUGH
A FORM OF MARRIAGE,

1218
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:58,295
AND SOON AFTER,
TIRED OF HER, HE LEFT.

1219
01:46:58,295 --> 01:47:00,180
SHE BORE HIM A CHILD.

1220
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:03,934
THIS MUCH WAS DONE
WITHOUT ATTRACTING NOTICE.

1221
01:47:03,934 --> 01:47:06,436
AND THEN, WHEN THE EXISTENCE
OF THE CHILD WAS DISCOVERED,

OF MORE SIGNIFICANCE.

OF THE HIGHEST IN THE LAND.
