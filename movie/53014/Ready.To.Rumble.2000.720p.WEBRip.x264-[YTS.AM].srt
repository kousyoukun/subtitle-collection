1
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:52,856
It is safe to assume
that professional wrestlers...

2
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:57,982
...are universally recognized
as the greatest athletes of all time.

3
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:02,088
Sammartino, Blassie,
Gorgeous George...

4
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:05,197
...George "The Animal" Steele,
Superfly Snooka...

5
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,561
...Andre the Giant, Hulk Hogan.

6
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,432
These are heroes of history.

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,801
Superior athletes...

8
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,442
...superior men.

9
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,413
Giants come and go in this great sport
of ours, but there is only one king:

10
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,177
Jimmy King.

11
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:32,713
Jimmy King is the greatest
wrestler of all time.

12
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,893
He's undefeated,
and he holds the record...

13
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,928
...for the longest winning streak in
the history of professional wrestling.

14
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:44,028
King says, and I quote:

15
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,466
"People said I was a dreamer...

16
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:51,300
...an idiot, and a waste of life,
and I will never amount to anything."

17
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:52,975
Hey, jackass.

18
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:57,610
You're a waste of life. Why don't you
go amount to nothing somewhere else?

19
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:02,146
And I told you little turdlets not to
park your junk in front of the shop!

20
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:05,984
Wrestling is for retards!

21
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,016
"Jimmy King's the greatest!"

22
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:12,492
You guys are as dumb as paint.

23
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,955
Really dumb paint.

24
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:18,992
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

25
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,829
Listen, Jimmy King is
the people's champion.

26
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:25,997
He's immortal, timeless.
He can raise the dead!

27
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,039
Can he really raise the dead? My dog,
Skipper, is buried under my sandbox.

28
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,101
Well, I don't know
about your dog, Skipper.

29
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,973
But don't worry,
because tomorrow night...

30
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:40,845
...Jimmy King is gonna whup
Diamond Dallas Page's ass.

31
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:42,350
We're gonna be there.

32
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:44,317
Right, Gordie?

33
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:46,823
Gordie?

34
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:52,761
Gordie?

35
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:03,371
What do you want, boob?

36
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:06,403
Purple sugar slush, king-size.

37
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,803
That'll be $1.26.

38
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,847
$1.25. That's all I got.

39
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:17,606
That's just not good enough,
now, is it, you little boob?

40
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:20,445
You little Jimmy the King fan boob!

41
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:25,056
Jimmy King's a big fat loser!
He's a sissy in tights!

42
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,626
There's a lot of glare coming off
that dome of yours, squirrel nuts!

43
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:33,163
Listen, sunshine...

44
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:37,095
...I'm gonna open up a fresh can
of whup-ass on you, boy!

45
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,498
Bring it on!

46
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,542
Tag me! Tag me!

47
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,048
Now you're gonna get it!

48
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,114
You messed with
the "Macho Man" Randy Savage!

49
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:59,382
I'm gonna get you! Yeah!

50
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,490
Bam! Bam! Bam!

51
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:06,628
King!

52
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:46,659
One! Two! Three!

53
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:58,406
Gordie?

54
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:03,277
Whoa, serious brain freeze.
That icy sugar locked up my nog-nog.

55
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:07,377
What about me, guy?
I was thirsty too.

56
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:09,641
I'll get you a refill.

57
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:11,875
No, don't sweat it.
The guy's a moron.

58
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:13,686
Come on, I feel bad.

59
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,321
Hey, Gordie?

60
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,155
Yeah?

61
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,223
Why does it look like you have
your finger in your butt?

62
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,590
Because I do.

63
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:34,866
Jerko, what do you want?

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,201
- I need a new sugar slush.
- Why?

65
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:41,071
There's something wrong
with this one. Smell it.

66
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,173
That's awful.

67
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,076
I know.

68
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:48,752
Smells like...

69
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:51,477
- Like...
- Like my ass, right?

70
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:56,085
- Or maybe your ass. It's weird, huh?
- Like a bitter, sour ass!

71
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:58,260
Like you poured it from your butt.

72
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:03,832
I will get you another one ASAP.

73
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:06,467
- Thanks.
- It's so bad.

74
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:08,033
How could you drink that?

75
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,307
I struggled through most of it, but
the butt-fruit settled at the bottom.

76
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,908
Freeze, loafer!

77
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,545
Come on. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

78
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,720
Come on, you know the drill.

79
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,190
You got any stuff on you?

80
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,861
Whoa. What's this?

81
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,029
My nuts.

82
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:43,063
Listen, pal, wouldn't you rather
be on the other side of this search?

83
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,031
You want me to grab your nuts?

84
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,067
Whoa. Yeah, you too.

85
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,072
Come on, sweetheart. Join the party.

86
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:52,832
Keep your hands where I can see them!

87
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:57,746
Dad, you gotta cut the crap
with the shakedowns.

88
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:02,317
You're gonna be a good cop, Gordie.
It'll change your life.

89
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:05,544
Look what it's done
for your mom and your sister.

90
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,914
What is this crap?

91
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:10,284
Wrestling?

92
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:15,223
Wrestling's fake.

93
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,328
Wrestling's not fake!

94
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:23,260
I like wrestling.

95
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,528
Are you gonna be a wrestler?

96
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:27,232
You got trouble...

97
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:31,103
...wrestling your wee-wee out
of your trousers to take a leak.

98
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,406
It's not that I have trouble.
Just sometimes I don't see the point.

99
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:36,672
Gordon.

100
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,247
Wrestling's a game for little boys.

101
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:42,949
Police work's for men.

102
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:45,789
Come on, let's bounce.

103
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,961
Wrestling's for dirtbags
and lily-pickers.

104
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:54,721
You'll be back.

105
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:56,955
The badge'll be waiting!

106
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:08,139
- My dad sucks, man.
- At least you got one.

107
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:13,280
Right, sorry. It's just that he's
always on my ass about getting a job.

108
00:08:13,548 --> 00:08:16,415
I mean, he's making me
take that cop exam.

109
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:19,586
- You have a job.
- I know.

110
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:23,252
I should decide what
I want to do with my life.

111
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:25,687
- That's right.
- Like Jimmy King says:

112
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:28,657
"This is America.
I can be anyone I want!"

113
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:32,195
He actually says,
"I can beat up anyone I want."

114
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,026
- Really?
- Yeah.

115
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:36,202
But who cares, bro?
What's tonight?

116
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,233
Monday Night Nitro!

117
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:41,599
Live, baby, live
Live, baby, live

118
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:53,778
This'll be awesome.
It'll be out of control.

119
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:57,085
Page vs. King
and it's not a pay-per-view?

120
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,311
Oh, yeah!

121
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,488
Hey, shit-boys!
How's the shit work?

122
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,652
Excuse the mess.
My aim's a little off.

123
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,195
I've been using the jackhammer.

124
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:19,933
All done. We did it.
Good job, Gordie.

125
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:23,300
You too.

126
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,739
Little too much coffee for me today.

127
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,488
- Don't do it.
- What?

128
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:39,189
Don't "what" me.
You know what. Don't do it.

129
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,519
- Friends don't do it to friends.
- Okay.

130
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:46,122
If you do it, Jimmy King'll
get hurt tonight. Don't.

131
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:47,798
Don't worry. I won't.

132
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:07,213
Gordie?

133
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:10,418
Nothing can hurt Jimmy King.

134
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,784
Stop it!

135
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,948
Gordie, stop it, please!

136
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:19,492
I'm gonna kick your ass!

137
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,793
Make it stop!

138
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,062
Sorry, man, I couldn't help it.

139
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:30,294
Sean, are you okay, man?

140
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,766
Sean!

141
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:44,583
Couldn't help it?
I can't help delivering a suplex!

142
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:46,814
Get off me!

143
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:57,887
Welcome to EZ Take-Out Burger.
How may I help you?

144
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:02,156
Sean wants Brittany's taco,
with cheese all over it.

145
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:03,354
Stop!

146
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:07,833
I should have smelled it was you.
What do you guys want?

147
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:10,865
Hi, Brittany, I'm sorry.
Can I please have...

148
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:13,909
...a cheeseburger maxi-meal...

149
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:18,479
- And a Brittany bare-ass buffet...
- Please! Please!

150
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:19,509
What?

151
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:23,612
He said that he wanted the Brittany...
Stop it!

152
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:25,843
- Did you say...?
- We'll pull up now.

153
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:28,715
Why?

154
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:30,652
Why don't you just ask her out?

155
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:34,020
How does my hair look?
Is it the Finesse?

156
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:37,788
You're driving a truck of ass-juice.
Don't worry about your hair.

157
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:42,568
I cannot deal with these losers.
I'm gonna work with the cheese.

158
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,432
Hi, Gordie.

159
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,072
- Sean.
- Hi, Wendy.

160
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,504
- Where'd Brittany go?
- She switched to cheese.

161
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:56,543
Sean, you think King's gonna put
a hurting on Diamond Dallas Page?

162
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,211
Yes, I most certainly do.

163
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:03,682
Hey, Brittany! How's the weather
in there? Cold today, hot tamale?

164
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,911
Leave me alone, loser!

165
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:09,421
Au corvair. Would a loser
have two tickets...

166
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:13,220
...to Monday Night Nitro,
live from Cheyenne, tonight?

167
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:14,918
Yes.

168
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,231
Brittany, listen.
Let's go out again.

169
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:22,028
We'll go out.
We won't talk about wrestling.

170
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:23,397
We'll talk about us...

171
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,272
You should give up on Brittany.

172
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:35,277
No way. She's my dream girl, bro.
Come on.

173
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,178
Well, what about Wendy?
She digs you.

174
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:42,650
No. She's too much
like one of the guys.

175
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:46,023
- That's bad?
- That's gay.

176
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:49,428
Right.

177
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:53,930
Look what I made.

178
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:03,303
Oh, wicked.

179
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,368
No. It stands for something.

180
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,037
W-W-K-D.

181
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,946
"What Would King Do?"

182
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:14,509
When I got a problem
and don't know what to do...

183
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:17,310
...I look down, and I look at it
and I think:

184
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:20,681
What would King do?

185
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:23,357
Man, that rocks.

186
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:27,991
I made two.

187
00:13:30,698 --> 00:13:32,632
That rocks hard, man.

188
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:39,596
Mrs. MacKenzie!

189
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:42,000
Ready for that big match tonight?

190
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:46,769
Oh, yes, boys. Jimmy King is gonna
bitch-slap Diamond Dallas.

191
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:49,573
We're gonna be there.
We're going.

192
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:54,010
Get me a T-shirt.
A really tight one.

193
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:57,521
That's gross, Mrs. MacKenzie.

194
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,191
Freeze!

195
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,568
Your sister shot her first perp today.

196
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,436
That's nice, Gabby.

197
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,505
She put one shot in his right buttock.

198
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,176
Just doing her job.

199
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,978
That's great. See you guys later.

200
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,876
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You better be back by 11.

201
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:30,547
You got a police admission
seminar tomorrow.

202
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,010
I've given that a lot of thought...

203
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:36,381
See you at 11.

204
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:52,701
Kid, move your fat head!
I can't see!

205
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:55,634
Sorry, Uncle Billy said
they were good seats.

206
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:57,836
Uncle Billy sucks!

207
00:14:58,043 --> 00:14:59,942
He lost his right nut in Nam.

208
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:03,671
Kick him in his left nut
when you see him. These seats bite!

209
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:07,149
Hey, if you only have one left...

210
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,282
...is it still your left nut?

211
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:14,082
Let's get closer.
King's coming up.

212
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,797
Nitro girls, dead ahead.

213
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,070
There's Chae. She's the best.

214
00:15:36,277 --> 00:15:40,213
Do not concur.
Sasha is the best of the best.

215
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:59,828
How you doing, Booker?

216
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,761
How you doing, boys?
Look, King's late again.

217
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:06,992
I don't know what to do.
I'm so sick of this shit.

218
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:10,034
- What's the finish?
- The finish is gonna be...

219
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:15,038
He'll pile-drive you, crown you,
and he's gonna get the win.

220
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:17,234
Works for me.
I'll tell the King.

221
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,969
Nice to see you, Billy.

222
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:21,273
Dallas, I want to talk to you.

223
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,446
Forget what I just told you.

224
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:28,087
Remember I told you
I'd take care of you?

225
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:29,917
Tonight's your night.

226
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:32,148
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

227
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,024
Works for me, bro.

228
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,428
Ladies and gentlemen...

229
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,759
...here we go with tonight's main
event for the WCW heavyweight crown.

230
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,834
Page vs. King! Page vs. King!

231
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,300
- Hell, yeah!
- Page vs. King!

232
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,836
Diamond Dallas Page!

233
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,812
It's time, folks.
It's finally here.

234
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,249
King vs. Diamond Dallas Page.

235
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:09,153
Come on, Diamond Dallas.
Take it like the punk bitch you are!

236
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:12,926
The King of Rock
is holding court tonight.

237
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:16,495
Here's the reigning WCW Heavyweight...

238
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,394
...Champion of the World:

239
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:22,593
Please welcome Jimmy King!

240
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:24,732
Behold the King!

241
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:52,363
Yeah, baby!

242
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:54,394
All night long.

243
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:00,900
Here comes Jimmy.

244
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:05,006
Look at that. With all the majesty
and flair befitting a true king.

245
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:14,872
Hello, Cheyenne, Wyoming.
We're gonna rule some ass tonight!

246
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:20,779
I want to welcome you
to the royal ass-kicking...

247
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,479
...of Diamond Dallas Page!

248
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:29,920
You wanna see me make
Diamond Dallas Page...

249
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:33,429
...one of my ladies
in waiting tonight?

250
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:38,628
You wanna see me take
Diamond Dallas Page...

251
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:40,863
...down into my dungeon...

252
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:45,669
...and make him my medieval
puppy-dog bitch tonight?

253
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:48,609
Yeah! That's what I thought!

254
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,775
- I'm the...
- Sing it, man!

255
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:54,111
I'm King of Rock
There is none higher

256
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:56,616
Sucker emcees just call me sire

257
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,880
To rule my kingdom
You must use fire

258
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,191
I won't stop rocking till I retire

259
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:04,292
I love that shit!

260
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,664
Look and listen
to this capacity crowd...

261
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:20,433
...and the reaction we would
expect for Titus Sinclair...

262
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,370
...who's in the ring.

263
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,204
Glad you made it.

264
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:27,504
- Boo!
- You suck, Sinclair!

265
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,707
For chrissake, Titus,
you're hogging my spotlight.

266
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:34,285
Your spotlight?
I invented you, you idiot.

267
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:37,217
This is mine.
You seem to have forgotten that.

268
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:38,890
Count your money, midget.

269
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,627
You know, Jimmy...

270
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:47,227
...you're still the same dumb trailer
hitch I discovered 14 years ago.

271
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:53,964
I just want to have
this final moment together.

272
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,238
The bell sounds
and the battle is underway.

273
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:06,575
What, Elvis? Won't be on time
with the rest of us?

274
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:09,786
Traffic, baby, traffic.
Come on, come on!

275
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:15,121
You're not too good today, King.

276
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:17,189
- What you got?
- Hammerlock, baby.

277
00:20:17,394 --> 00:20:18,793
Good God!

278
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,394
The King's showing
what's made him the champion.

279
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:24,988
Ready?

280
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:28,927
Good sound effects.

281
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:45,578
Double neck-breaker.
Both men are down!

282
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:49,384
What a vicious move that is!
King goes for the cover.

283
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:52,250
He's trying for an early win.
He didn't get it.

284
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:56,155
- Three!
- You do your job, I'll do mine.

285
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:06,501
Okay, Pagey. Hip toss, baby.

286
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:11,664
Oh, did you see that elbow?
Down goes Jimmy King!

287
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:13,364
What the hell was that?

288
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:22,418
Jimmy's in trouble!

289
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:26,019
This is as vicious as we've
ever seen Diamond Dallas Page!

290
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:28,313
- What are you doing?
- Get out of my face!

291
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:30,015
Why?

292
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,024
Boss's orders, fat boy.

293
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:45,427
- Kick his leathery ass!
- Destroy him!

294
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,833
And Jimmy King is not done yet!

295
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:51,444
A pair of shots from King
has DDP on the defensive.

296
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,609
See you!

297
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,188
He broke the table!
Oh, my goodness!

298
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:13,919
King down on the floor,
trying to get up to a knee.

299
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:15,188
Come on, fat boy.

300
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:17,399
Let me help you back in. Come on.

301
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:22,865
Out of nowhere, Jimmy King with a
foreign object to the head of DDP!

302
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,631
King mounting the corner.

303
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:27,239
I think he's gonna
go up for the crown.

304
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:30,811
- Crown him, King!
- Prepare to be varnished!

305
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,755
Here's a move we've seen before.
Very familiar. Diamond Dallas...

306
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:47,221
...motioning to the crowd that
it's time for the diamond cutter.

307
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,223
King caught him!

308
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:54,559
That will stop anything, including
the diamond cutter, I'll tell you.

309
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:56,630
Both men down!
Wait a minute!

310
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:59,532
Here come Page's goons,
led by Sid Vicious!

311
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:04,437
They're the biggest, meanest men
in our sport, coming to help Dallas.

312
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,868
Watch out, King!

313
00:23:13,384 --> 00:23:15,545
Power bomb by Sid Vicious on King!

314
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:20,384
The double diamond cutter!

315
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,949
No! No!

316
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,549
Toss him out!

317
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:32,557
Here they come! Finally, the King's
men have come to bail him out!

318
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,768
- That's right!
- Oh, yeah!

319
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:39,372
The wrestlers are surrounding King.
I don't know what's going on here.

320
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:43,807
Wait a minute.
They're all attacking Jimmy King!

321
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:47,380
They turned on him!
Sinclair must have got to them.

322
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,850
What's wrong with you?

323
00:23:53,853 --> 00:23:57,550
DDP motioning to his goons
to head up to the top rope.

324
00:23:58,857 --> 00:23:59,824
King!

325
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:10,529
This is what you get when you
suck your money down the toilet!

326
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:13,464
- You jinxed him!
- No, God, no!

327
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,968
- Get off of me!
- This isn't even a pay-per-view!

328
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:18,339
Four men.

329
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:21,442
There's four wrestlers
on the four corner posts.

330
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:24,944
- A four-post massacre!
- No one can survive this!

331
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:27,043
No!

332
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,193
It's a four-post massacre.
They all come up at the same time!

333
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,863
Incredible!

334
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,295
Come on, get up! Count him out!
Count him out!

335
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:54,864
Count it, ref.
One! Two! Three!

336
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:57,473
Ladies and gentlemen.

337
00:24:57,677 --> 00:25:01,077
Your winner and new WCW...

338
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:03,508
...Heavyweight Champion
of the World:

339
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:07,115
Diamond Dallas Page!

340
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:14,057
Ladies and gentlemen.

341
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,853
You have witnessed the demise...

342
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:20,687
...of Jimmy King.

343
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:24,326
He will never, ever...

344
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:28,765
...fight for the WCW again.

345
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:33,636
Long live the new king
and reigning champion...

346
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:37,242
...Diamond Dallas Page!

347
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:43,915
Feel that, Jimmy?

348
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:46,911
That's your spotlight fading.

349
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:50,546
- Why?
- Why?

350
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,015
Why not?

351
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,525
You're through. I'm done with you.

352
00:25:58,931 --> 00:26:00,762
Rest in peace.

353
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:19,738
Damn allergies.

354
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,079
Yeah, me too.
Damn stupid allergies.

355
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:26,551
Unfair, bogus allergies!

356
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:33,655
Unfair, cheating, blind ref!

357
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:36,821
Bogus Sinclair allergies!

358
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:39,555
Damn Diamond Dallas Page!

359
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:42,099
Right, Sean, let it out, man.

360
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:45,739
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

361
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,284
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy...

362
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,485
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

363
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,918
Oh, my God.

364
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,120
We made it!

365
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:15,127
We're alive!

366
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:19,359
Would that be raw sewage I'm smelling?

367
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:23,133
Yeah. I kind of
always liked the smell.

368
00:27:24,408 --> 00:27:27,844
Yeah, me too.
Kind of smells like French toast.

369
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:31,769
What? French toast dipped in shit.

370
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,023
Damn it, Jim.
We're firemen, not janitors.

371
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:47,716
We sure as hell
aren't gonna clean this up.

372
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:11,207
Shit!

373
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,861
What're the odds of that?

374
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:48,413
That truck and that business were
all my dad left me when he died.

375
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:51,312
That's all I've got
to remember him by.

376
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,854
I'll remember my dad by the epic
beating I get for coming home late.

377
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:58,847
We got no jobs, Gordie.

378
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:01,117
State police, here I come.

379
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:05,262
I can't believe how much we suck!

380
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:07,523
Everything's changed overnight.

381
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,234
Yeah, but if Jimmy King
can win the title back...

382
00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:11,594
- Gordie.
- What?

383
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:16,034
You heard what Sinclair said, right?
He kicked Jimmy King out of the WCW.

384
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:18,801
A lifetime ban. No rematch.

385
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:21,440
It's over, Gordie.

386
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,942
Jimmy King's dead, okay?

387
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:26,780
- Sean?
- What?

388
00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:29,317
You think things
happen for a reason?

389
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,784
What could possibly
be the reason for this?

390
00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:36,083
All right. Don't you think
it's a little strange...

391
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:39,293
...that we were in Cheyenne
the same day Jimmy King...

392
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:43,965
...was cheated out of his title
and banned from the WCW for life?

393
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:48,602
Don't you think it's strange that
we crashed the truck on the way home?

394
00:29:48,836 --> 00:29:52,272
It's a little strange,
but what are we supposed to do?

395
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:53,734
Exactly.

396
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:55,899
What?

397
00:29:57,043 --> 00:29:58,567
What would King do?

398
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:02,204
I don't know, Gordie.
What would he do?

399
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:05,008
I'll tell you.
He'd fight to make it right.

400
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:10,220
You just let me know when he
shows up and does that, okay?

401
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:14,657
There's a part of King inside me,
telling me we got one choice.

402
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:17,322
We gotta find Jimmy King.

403
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,520
This must've happened for a reason.

404
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:22,857
It's gotta be some kind of test.

405
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:26,497
We gotta find the King.

406
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:30,907
We gotta find the King?

407
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:34,674
You and me?

408
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:39,611
Things happen for a reason, man.
We gotta find the King.

409
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:40,872
What do you say?

410
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:45,311
How far is Atlanta from here?

411
00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:54,425
Sir, it's cold.

412
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,195
Jerk!

413
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:01,623
- Oh, yes.
- Thank God.

414
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:07,638
Hey. We're trying to get to Atlanta.

415
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:10,670
We're headed to Daytona.
Atlanta's on our way.

416
00:31:11,242 --> 00:31:12,641
Come on in, boys.

417
00:31:12,843 --> 00:31:13,810
Hallelujah.

418
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:18,580
Kumbaya, my Lord

419
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:20,911
Kumbaya

420
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:25,446
Kumbaya, my Lord

421
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:28,087
Kumbaya

422
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:32,918
Michael, row your boat ashore

423
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:36,027
Alleluia

424
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:39,462
Michael, row your boat ashore

425
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,803
Alleluia

426
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:47,134
- Do you guys know any Van Halen?
- No.

427
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:48,942
No.

428
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:50,844
No.

429
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:57,575
Running with the devil

430
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:03,316
Running with the devil

431
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:06,551
Break it down, mama.

432
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:11,695
I live my life
Like there's no tomorrow

433
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,388
All I've got I had to steal

434
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,163
She stole it.

435
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:21,838
I don't need to beg or borrow

436
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:26,304
Yes, I'm living at a pace that kills

437
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:33,881
Running with the devil

438
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,147
Running with the devil

439
00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:40,452
Oh, yeah

440
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:56,458
- Thank you.
- See you later.

441
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,469
You chicks rock!

442
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:05,342
Hey, bro, I know we just
got all this religion...

443
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:08,603
...but I got a question,
and I need a serious answer.

444
00:33:08,814 --> 00:33:10,543
- Swear to God?
- Swear to God.

445
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:13,784
Did you fart in that van?

446
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,043
It wasn't me. Swear to God.

447
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:18,983
Me neither. Swear to God.

448
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,383
Oh, my God.

449
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,651
They were the farting nuns.

450
00:33:27,731 --> 00:33:28,891
Bingo!

451
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:30,530
Let's do this.

452
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:35,696
I will rule you!

453
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,677
Gonna be a while.
Me and Jimmy King don't lose.

454
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:49,379
Down with King?
Big Jimmy King fan?

455
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,616
King is king.

456
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,547
Bullshit what happened.

457
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,287
Makes me wanna puke. But my dad
says puking's for pussies.

458
00:33:58,058 --> 00:34:00,787
I puke all the time
and I'm not a pussy.

459
00:34:03,696 --> 00:34:06,164
Listen, me and my associate...

460
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:08,298
...we're on a quest to find King.

461
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,331
You know where his mansion is?

462
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:14,169
I heard he lives in a castle.
I never seen it, though.

463
00:34:14,372 --> 00:34:15,998
I could probably find it.

464
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,071
You can find Jimmy King?

465
00:34:18,776 --> 00:34:20,767
I can find anyone on the Net.

466
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,738
I'll search the Web for info
on King's whereabouts.

467
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,039
Good. Smart.

468
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:28,207
You're the King!

469
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:32,386
- Oh, yeah? I will rule you!
- Dude.

470
00:34:32,588 --> 00:34:34,317
Dude, my dad'll hear you.

471
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,588
Sorry, man. I'll keep it down.

472
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:37,960
Thanks.

473
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:41,352
Give it to you two times!

474
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:43,023
Sorry.

475
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:47,892
I found a site. "King, Jimmy."

476
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:50,395
Wife, Eugenia."

477
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:53,569
Hey, and you're in luck.

478
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:56,167
Here's the address.

479
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:59,971
Sir Isaac,
you've served your king well.

480
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,907
My loneliness is killing me

481
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:09,386
I must confess I still believe

482
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:17,293
Give me a sign

483
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:20,792
Hit me baby one more time

484
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:26,565
It's not exactly a castle.

485
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:40,304
Eugenia King?

486
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:43,343
- Jimmy King's wife?
- Yeah.

487
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:45,176
The queen.

488
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:47,549
Front and present.

489
00:35:50,157 --> 00:35:52,591
We're looking for the King.
Is he home?

490
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:55,819
What are you, high?
He hasn't been home in two years.

491
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:59,496
All I got to remember him by
is an itchy crotch.

492
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,967
You ever seen crabs up close?

493
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:03,636
You wanna see?

494
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,468
- Fantastic.
- Wait, no.

495
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:09,706
I got this.

496
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,366
Ma'am...

497
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,607
...could you say who
his associates are?

498
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,216
Yeah. They're all scumbags.
You could try Louise.

499
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,475
And Louise is...?

500
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:22,947
A whore. She's a whore.

501
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,183
Good. Whores.

502
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:28,881
Scumbags and whores. Great.
Thank you. You've been a lot of help.

503
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,252
If you find him...

504
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:34,224
...tell him he owes me child support,
alimony and dental bills.

505
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:39,693
Tell him I hope his diddly turns black
and falls in the crapper.

506
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:44,972
It's the prince.

507
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:54,981
You looking for my dad?

508
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:57,716
Yeah. We're on a quest.
Prince Jimmy!

509
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,076
I'm Frankie.

510
00:36:59,953 --> 00:37:01,477
Are you bounty hunters?

511
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:05,382
I'll help you find him
if you split the reward with me.

512
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:07,558
- Know where we can find him?
- No.

513
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,855
I haven't seen him for months.

514
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:12,330
Mama says he's gotta pay
for my braces...

515
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,090
...otherwise they're gonna
repossess them.

516
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,998
Nice.

517
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,434
My research shows he has three kids...

518
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:25,335
...two illegitimate, two wives
and has filed for bankruptcy 3 times.

519
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:29,103
This doesn't make sense!
Jimmy King wouldn't do that stuff!

520
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,904
It's a conspiracy, all right?

521
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:35,584
Sinclair set up King to make him
lose face in front of his own family.

522
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,754
And I found his parents.
Maybe they can help.

523
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:40,786
Kid's wasted his entire life.

524
00:37:41,657 --> 00:37:42,954
Wrestling.

525
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,650
He could have been a doctor.

526
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:51,564
Well, an ambulance driver, at least.

527
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:54,132
Jimmy was never very bright.

528
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:55,927
Left school in 10th grade.

529
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:57,727
I beg to differ.

530
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:03,033
According to his authorized biography,
King worked very hard in high school.

531
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:07,575
And after you died in a plane crash,
he went to community college.

532
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,408
And he supported you
while he held two jobs.

533
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:14,583
I ought to kick your ass, freak!

534
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:17,084
We saw him last week.

535
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,856
He came and "borrowed" our motor home.

536
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:25,495
We haven't seen him since.
The big shit!

537
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:29,926
Yes. Jimmy King received a speeding
ticket, driving a motor home.

538
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:33,329
He gave them an address.
St. Francis Motor Court.

539
00:38:33,536 --> 00:38:36,004
- Space 14.
- Get off the phone, you pussy!

540
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,799
I gotta go. My dad says yakking
on the phone is for pussies.

541
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:03,593
Let's go. That's not the King,
just some weird lady.

542
00:39:03,764 --> 00:39:04,890
Oh, my God.

543
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:08,001
That's her.

544
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:11,496
I mean, that's him. That's the King.

545
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,339
Are you telling me the King's a queen?

546
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:23,506
There's gotta be an explanation.
But we came all this way.

547
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:25,416
He needs us.

548
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:29,081
It's another plot. A "rouge."

549
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:35,755
- King! Jimmy King?
- Yeah, baby.

550
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:38,421
Jimmy King!

551
00:39:42,165 --> 00:39:44,962
- Who's there? Who's there?
- It's us.

552
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:51,029
The nice boys from the pharmacy.

553
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:55,366
Leave my husband's medicine on the top
step. I'll tip you next time...

554
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:59,375
- No, no. No pharmacy.
- We're your most loyal "surgeons."

555
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,638
- Why are you doing this?
- It's us!

556
00:40:01,848 --> 00:40:04,749
- You're a chick?
- Give me the stuff or I'll crown you!

557
00:40:04,918 --> 00:40:07,580
- It's him!
- It's him! King!

558
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:08,845
Jimmy King!

559
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:11,585
We're your biggest fans.

560
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,519
- You're fans?
- Yeah.

561
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:18,861
I ought to break your geeky necks.

562
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:22,265
We're on a quest
to restore your throne!

563
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:25,027
- We believe in you, Jimmy King!
- Piss off!

564
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:29,002
There's hope.

565
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:32,209
See, he's got some fight left in him.

566
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:36,137
Could we come in? Five minutes
is all we ask of the King.

567
00:40:36,413 --> 00:40:37,402
Please?

568
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:39,681
How much money you got?

569
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,346
- Thirty dollars.
- Show it to me.

570
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,018
Personal appearance fee.

571
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:56,889
Thirty dollars, five minutes. Enter!

572
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:01,963
- You were right.
- I told you.

573
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,838
Things happen for a reason.

574
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:21,485
It's a conspiracy. We know
this isn't you. You're our king.

575
00:41:22,054 --> 00:41:25,820
This is a disguise. I'm hiding out
from a couple of people.

576
00:41:26,023 --> 00:41:28,116
You're hiding out from Sinclair.

577
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,426
I ain't scared of that circus freak.

578
00:41:31,796 --> 00:41:33,491
You understand me?

579
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:37,257
I made that league and he knows it.
I put the butts in the seats.

580
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:39,262
- I know.
- He's done exploiting me...

581
00:41:39,502 --> 00:41:44,370
...so he plots a massacre with his
sissies and kicks me out for good.

582
00:41:44,573 --> 00:41:46,666
- That's so unjust.
- That sucks.

583
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:50,606
It's not like the rest of my life
been a bowl of cherries either.

584
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,682
But I just try and play
the cards that's dealt me.

585
00:41:56,752 --> 00:41:58,743
Keep my chin up.

586
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:02,947
Even though my wife just left me...

587
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:06,755
...and my little boy's
confined to a wheelchair.

588
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:10,763
And my mommy and daddy just passed.

589
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:14,734
We met your wife.

590
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:18,532
And she says that you left her.

591
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,404
Not how I remember it.

592
00:42:22,675 --> 00:42:24,870
And your son's not in a wheelchair.

593
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,307
Your parents aren't dead anymore.

594
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,545
Good Lord! I am blessed!

595
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,479
Praise Him, in all His mercies!

596
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,246
Piss off! Five minutes are up.
Get out!

597
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:40,321
Wait.

598
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:41,955
- Get out!
- Wait, wait.

599
00:42:42,158 --> 00:42:43,716
Can we do something for you?

600
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,862
We can go on a beer run, right?
We can go on a beer run for you.

601
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:49,554
Beer is good. Beer.

602
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:55,601
Get me two sixes.

603
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,702
You try and skip out with my money,
I'm gonna find you...

604
00:43:03,043 --> 00:43:04,670
"I will find you..."

605
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,138
"I will find you" and...?

606
00:43:10,316 --> 00:43:12,307
- "I will rule you!"
- Yeah.

607
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:15,216
Give us a "rule you," please?

608
00:43:15,455 --> 00:43:16,887
- Wait, no.
- Come on!

609
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:19,022
Give us a "begone."

610
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:21,192
Yeah, please?

611
00:43:21,427 --> 00:43:22,519
How about this:

612
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:25,026
Go get my damn beer,
you frigging morons!

613
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,365
- How are we gonna get back to Lusk?
- What do you mean?

614
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:34,732
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

615
00:43:34,939 --> 00:43:37,840
Drunk Jimmy King in a dress.
We're out of here.

616
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:40,840
Wait, no, no. Sean, we can't.

617
00:43:41,044 --> 00:43:43,137
He needs us now more than ever.

618
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:45,840
My hope...

619
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:50,780
...is that you two figured out that
I ain't the fella you came to see.

620
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:54,353
It's been a pleasure sitting with you.

621
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,922
Thank you for getting me
two boxes of beer.

622
00:43:58,126 --> 00:43:59,855
Shut the door on your way out.

623
00:44:00,061 --> 00:44:02,359
I know what's going on here.

624
00:44:02,597 --> 00:44:04,758
You need to get back into the ring.

625
00:44:04,966 --> 00:44:06,194
Never happen.

626
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,099
Sinclair created and owns
my character. It's over. Cheers.

627
00:44:11,305 --> 00:44:13,830
Sinclair?
So what? You're the King.

628
00:44:14,641 --> 00:44:16,505
You can beat anyone.

629
00:44:19,512 --> 00:44:21,742
- Beat anyone?
- Yeah.

630
00:44:22,982 --> 00:44:24,608
Y'all know it's just a show?

631
00:44:25,217 --> 00:44:26,741
Best show in the world.

632
00:44:26,985 --> 00:44:28,885
It's like dancing, you know?

633
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:32,011
- It's a circus show with dancing.
- Right.

634
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:33,655
- Dancing clowns.
- We got you.

635
00:44:33,824 --> 00:44:34,916
Honk, honk.

636
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:37,493
A little soap opera thrown in.

637
00:44:37,695 --> 00:44:40,993
This clown just got fired, that's all.
No more wrestling.

638
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,567
Listen to me, you dumbshits!

639
00:44:46,736 --> 00:44:49,363
I ain't no king!
There never was no king!

640
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:54,008
The King is a fake creation.
I ain't a has-been. I'm a never-was.

641
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,610
You got it, stupid?

642
00:44:56,779 --> 00:45:00,305
Now, get the hell out of my house!
I'm done with you. Get out!

643
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:02,706
Come on.

644
00:45:04,853 --> 00:45:06,285
Get. Get out.

645
00:45:16,062 --> 00:45:17,620
Know what I don't get?

646
00:45:19,632 --> 00:45:21,725
How can you be phony
if we believe in you?

647
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:27,702
We need you, King.
Your fans need you.

648
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:31,601
We need you to rise above this
and take Sinclair down.

649
00:45:32,342 --> 00:45:35,209
I wouldn't mind taking a swing
at that turd bump.

650
00:45:35,412 --> 00:45:39,780
That's what we're talking about.
You'll get as many swings as you want.

651
00:45:39,982 --> 00:45:42,382
I'm a little banged up.
I don't know.

652
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:45,917
Oh, please! You fought
with a broken back before.

653
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:50,114
You were paralyzed, you hopped out
of a wheelchair and whupped Canyon!

654
00:45:51,493 --> 00:45:54,690
Sting broke six bones
in your neck with a bat.

655
00:45:54,863 --> 00:45:57,057
In two weeks, you came back and ruled!

656
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:01,025
- Come on!
- Come on, man! This is nothing!

657
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:03,802
What's the matter?

658
00:46:05,238 --> 00:46:06,830
Come on! This is nothing!

659
00:46:07,674 --> 00:46:09,869
- Let go!
- Show us some of that old King!

660
00:46:10,076 --> 00:46:12,374
- Let go or...
- Or what? Or what?

661
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,004
Or I will rule you!

662
00:46:29,827 --> 00:46:30,725
Crown us!

663
00:46:30,928 --> 00:46:31,952
Crown us, come on!

664
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:34,687
- Please, crown us!
- Crown us!

665
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:39,257
That was great, man!

666
00:46:39,502 --> 00:46:41,026
You happy now?

667
00:46:50,813 --> 00:46:52,838
Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey.

668
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:55,672
- Guess what?
- What?

669
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:59,919
Taking you up on your offer to get
one good swing at Titus Sinclair.

670
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:01,918
You're gonna pound Sinclair?

671
00:47:02,957 --> 00:47:05,481
Oh, yeah. I'm driving first leg.

672
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,755
Here tonight, in a hard-core match...

673
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,860
...Sid Vicious is gonna
be locking up with Sting.

674
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:54,195
Plus in his very first title offense,
Diamond Dallas Page...

675
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:58,463
...faces none other than the Disco
Inferno. Should be interesting.

676
00:48:00,942 --> 00:48:02,000
Out of the way!

677
00:48:02,544 --> 00:48:04,773
- Excuse us!
- Smells like poop in here.

678
00:48:05,146 --> 00:48:06,943
We're almost in position.

679
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:10,275
When we have access to Sinclair,
Gordie will call.

680
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:18,719
When you hear that, jump out
and we'll have our meeting.

681
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:22,184
Sit tight, King.

682
00:48:22,428 --> 00:48:25,591
Have you back on that throne
in no time. Come on.

683
00:48:31,002 --> 00:48:32,629
Here, girls.
Here, here, here.

684
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,337
Oh, my goodness!

685
00:48:35,973 --> 00:48:37,132
- Look!
- Naked things.

686
00:48:40,844 --> 00:48:42,903
The naked, naked things.

687
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,808
- All the naked things.
- Naked. Naked.

688
00:48:50,753 --> 00:48:52,277
Oh, extra-naked.

689
00:48:59,894 --> 00:49:01,293
Excuse me.

690
00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:02,495
Boys.

691
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:04,656
Can I help you?

692
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:07,526
No. We were just
checking out your breasts.

693
00:49:09,503 --> 00:49:11,561
We're checking the pipes in the wall.

694
00:49:11,805 --> 00:49:14,273
See, they're round and large.

695
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:15,874
Well, thanks.

696
00:49:21,013 --> 00:49:24,881
That was Sasha. Perhaps the
Nitro-est Nitro Girl of them all.

697
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,926
Mr. Page? Got 60 seconds.

698
00:49:38,162 --> 00:49:42,622
I want to start tight on the belt,
then reveal us, pulling back.

699
00:49:42,867 --> 00:49:44,356
About time you put it on me.

700
00:49:44,601 --> 00:49:46,569
Anybody's better than Jimmy King.

701
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,295
Ungrateful tub of lard,
that's what he was.

702
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,269
I know that. You know that.

703
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:55,909
I don't get what
these kids dig about him.

704
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:59,406
Let me tell you about these kids.
They're morons.

705
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:01,512
They love who I tell them to.

706
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:06,278
"I'm Jimmy King! I will rule you!"

707
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:08,614
I will reign supreme!

708
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:12,450
"As soon as I finish
these here beers."

709
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:13,960
Funny?

710
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:15,626
Let's roll. We'll do it.

711
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:18,955
Five. Four. Three. Two.

712
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:23,362
Page, what do you really feel
about Jimmy King?

713
00:50:23,602 --> 00:50:25,126
Yo, snapper-head, up here!

714
00:50:25,704 --> 00:50:29,161
Jimmy King, he doesn't know
a wristlock from a wristwatch.

715
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,569
As far as being
in shape is concerned...

716
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:35,710
...that boy was so out of shape,
in the ring it was like fighting...

717
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:38,539
...a harpooned whale.

718
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:40,740
That's sweet, man. What a bum.

719
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:42,316
Jimmy King is not a...

720
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:45,314
I ain't no damn bum!

721
00:50:53,296 --> 00:50:55,059
King's not in the script!

722
00:51:10,244 --> 00:51:11,302
Foreign object!

723
00:51:18,384 --> 00:51:20,648
Fatty just made you
his shithouse bitch!

724
00:51:26,224 --> 00:51:27,623
Who are you guys?

725
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:29,793
- We're fans!
- Jimmy King's, asshole!

726
00:51:30,028 --> 00:51:32,087
Get them off of me!

727
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:46,676
King!

728
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:51,475
Is that all you got?

729
00:52:01,222 --> 00:52:03,520
- Do your job!
- You went down!

730
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:06,722
One. Two. Three.

731
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:09,361
The winner by pinfall, Jimmy King!

732
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:11,321
We have a new champion!

733
00:52:11,532 --> 00:52:13,500
Jimmy King rules!

734
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:17,661
No!

735
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:19,838
That was unsanctioned!

736
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:24,237
And per the bylaws of the WCW,
that belt cannot be passed.

737
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:28,470
- You give me what's mine, you freak!
- You can't ambush your opponent.

738
00:52:28,681 --> 00:52:31,514
- Any match, anytime, baby!
- You heard him.

739
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:33,775
Any match, anytime!

740
00:52:34,052 --> 00:52:36,782
You want a match, you got one match.

741
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:39,319
- One match, you name it!
- The steel cage.

742
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:41,854
Steel cage? Done! When?

743
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:44,993
- He doesn't even have to win.
- He's not gonna win.

744
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:49,026
- No, he's gonna win.
- All you have to do is survive.

745
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:53,634
You survive and you get this belt.

746
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,231
Plus $1 million!

747
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,562
But if he loses...

748
00:52:59,374 --> 00:53:02,832
...you forfeit your crown
and never be able to wrestle again.

749
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:05,238
- It's a deal!
- You got a match, baby!

750
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,004
Hold on, baby. Hold the damn phones.

751
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:10,947
Ladies and gentlemen,
you heard it here.

752
00:53:11,185 --> 00:53:15,644
A new first. Four weeks from tonight,
MGM Grand, pay-per-view.

753
00:53:16,356 --> 00:53:19,757
- Be there!
- We're gonna reign supreme!

754
00:53:20,026 --> 00:53:23,961
- Good, save it! Save that emotion!
- Save it!

755
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:26,164
Tonight we rejoice! We rejoice!

756
00:53:26,365 --> 00:53:29,129
- With the King in his motor castle!
- Party!

757
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,538
Sasha.

758
00:53:44,115 --> 00:53:45,082
Oh, my God.

759
00:53:48,985 --> 00:53:49,917
I'm Gordie.

760
00:53:50,554 --> 00:53:52,545
I saw you in that brawl tonight.

761
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:54,984
Pretty awesome.

762
00:53:58,494 --> 00:53:59,688
Got a beer?

763
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:03,899
- Dick!
- Thanks.

764
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:08,099
I got your poster up in my room.

765
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:09,303
Really?

766
00:54:09,938 --> 00:54:10,734
Which one?

767
00:54:11,005 --> 00:54:12,063
Is it...

768
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:15,331
...this one? Or wait.

769
00:54:17,644 --> 00:54:20,078
- That one?
- No, it's this one.

770
00:54:23,716 --> 00:54:25,946
- That's my favorite.
- Me too!

771
00:54:27,787 --> 00:54:29,414
You're really sweet.

772
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:32,955
And masculine.

773
00:54:33,225 --> 00:54:35,785
I really like how
you stood up to Sinclair.

774
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:38,586
We did it for that guy right there.

775
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:41,492
Isn't he the best?

776
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:43,963
He's the best. There's no better.

777
00:54:45,803 --> 00:54:49,966
Growing up in Cody, Wyoming,
I lived to watch Jimmy King fight.

778
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,299
You're from Cody? No way!

779
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:55,306
- I'm from Lusk!
- Really?

780
00:54:55,545 --> 00:54:56,533
Oh, my God!

781
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,447
You wanna dance?

782
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,896
Do people think I'm sexy?

783
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,870
I think you're sexy, Gene.
Really I do.

784
00:55:31,377 --> 00:55:35,677
But right now, I'm gonna train
for this freaking death match, baby.

785
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:40,015
A little pure protein,
send me on my way.

786
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:53,320
No goddamn way, baby!

787
00:56:09,594 --> 00:56:10,561
Oh, my God.

788
00:56:12,465 --> 00:56:14,228
How'd you know
where to find him?

789
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,765
We're in the business.

790
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:20,338
Found him in drainage tunnel 14.
He didn't want to leave.

791
00:56:20,814 --> 00:56:22,577
We'll take care of him from here.

792
00:56:22,817 --> 00:56:24,011
Good luck.

793
00:56:25,456 --> 00:56:26,753
Do your magic.

794
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:31,230
You cannot run away.

795
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:33,732
You got a fight,
major responsibilities.

796
00:56:34,006 --> 00:56:35,371
I got news for you.

797
00:56:35,575 --> 00:56:38,409
I sucker-punched Page last night.
It was a fluke!

798
00:56:38,614 --> 00:56:40,309
How can you say that?

799
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:42,309
We got you this far!

800
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,583
We're gonna get you a trainer.

801
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,393
Trainer?

802
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:51,157
I don't need a trainer.
I need a safe house, baby.

803
00:56:51,404 --> 00:56:54,567
Or a new identity from the FBI.
Or a fast car.

804
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:59,544
Jimmy King is not scared.
Jimmy King does not back down.

805
00:56:59,785 --> 00:57:01,048
Don't you get it?

806
00:57:01,288 --> 00:57:04,747
Sinclair wants to kill me.
End my life.

807
00:57:05,062 --> 00:57:09,966
So I'm dead and buried in the ground.
Little tiny bugs feasting on my ass.

808
00:57:10,204 --> 00:57:12,502
No bugs are gonna feast on your ass!

809
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:16,509
You'll win the money and get
your belt back. That's our mission.

810
00:57:17,585 --> 00:57:19,348
I'm scared, baby. I'm scared.

811
00:57:19,855 --> 00:57:22,825
We can help. Sean, sing the song.

812
00:57:23,262 --> 00:57:24,388
I don't want to sing.

813
00:57:24,597 --> 00:57:27,965
Sing the song for Mr. King! Come on.

814
00:57:31,377 --> 00:57:34,540
Jimmy King is the best wrestler

815
00:57:34,782 --> 00:57:36,444
He's the best-ler

816
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,213
Better than all the rest-ler

817
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:41,187
- He's got class
- He's really fast

818
00:57:41,428 --> 00:57:44,830
- He'll rule ass
- He'll rule that ass

819
00:57:46,037 --> 00:57:49,701
Jimmy, Jimmy King

820
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:52,208
- It's not done.
- We're still working on it.

821
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,521
Where are you taking me?

822
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:01,025
It's a surprise. Don't worry.

823
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:09,744
Hello?

824
00:58:12,151 --> 00:58:13,778
What the hell is that, baby?

825
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:27,912
I got three words for you, baby,
9-1-1.

826
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:34,448
Stifle!

827
00:58:47,516 --> 00:58:48,881
Sal Bandini.

828
00:58:49,118 --> 00:58:50,609
Wanna wrestle?

829
00:58:50,855 --> 00:58:51,651
Sal Bandini?

830
00:58:53,025 --> 00:58:54,220
This is an honor...

831
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:00,862
Tap out, son.

832
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:06,672
This is who you called about?

833
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,184
I've seen you.

834
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:12,051
You're big, tough. You don't
know shit about wrestling.

835
00:59:12,328 --> 00:59:15,764
Always worried, what,
about TV time and endorsements?

836
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:17,936
- Well...
- Stifle. You talk too much.

837
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,607
Mr. Bandini, he's ready
to listen and learn.

838
00:59:20,844 --> 00:59:24,975
Good. I'm just finishing up with
the local high school wrestling team.

839
00:59:27,122 --> 00:59:28,952
All right, whackers, go home.

840
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:30,659
You did real good today.

841
00:59:30,862 --> 00:59:33,057
But remember what I told you.

842
00:59:33,332 --> 00:59:36,734
Apply pressure until
you hear cartilage snap...

843
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:39,737
...or they crap in their pants.
Come on, wuss, move it!

844
00:59:39,978 --> 00:59:42,345
And you, work on that for tomorrow!

845
00:59:42,784 --> 00:59:46,117
Gentlemen, step into my office.

846
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,755
Just take it easy.

847
00:59:49,394 --> 00:59:50,691
Come on, Jimmy.

848
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,762
Show me one of your fancy moves.

849
00:59:56,174 --> 00:59:57,141
Come on, King.

850
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:03,076
- That's not good.
- Come on. It's embarrassing.

851
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:08,220
Tap out, punk.
I seen you favor that leg.

852
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:10,931
Lesson one:
Never reveal your weaknesses.

853
01:00:11,502 --> 01:00:12,730
Bite me, old man.

854
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:13,995
Right spirit.

855
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,299
Wrong old man to be messing with.

856
01:00:16,578 --> 01:00:17,546
Tap out.

857
01:00:26,163 --> 01:00:28,223
You kicked him in the face, King.

858
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:30,698
The crazy old bastard was
gonna kill me.

859
01:00:30,939 --> 01:00:32,270
I think you killed him.

860
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:33,509
What?

861
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:35,904
How hard did you hit him?
He's an old man!

862
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,640
Only gave him a little flick.

863
01:00:37,852 --> 01:00:40,253
No, you kicked him in the face.

864
01:00:43,128 --> 01:00:45,495
Sal, you all right?
You all right, baby?

865
01:00:52,446 --> 01:00:54,039
You know, kicking me was right.

866
01:00:54,285 --> 01:00:56,048
Seeing if I was okay is wrong.

867
01:00:56,856 --> 01:01:01,659
Lesson one: The possum ain't dead
till it's scraped off the road.

868
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,459
It's treachery.

869
01:01:03,938 --> 01:01:05,702
Did you have to squash
the possum's nuts?

870
01:01:05,908 --> 01:01:06,966
Stifle.

871
01:01:12,688 --> 01:01:14,657
Buenos nachos, señorita.

872
01:01:15,526 --> 01:01:17,426
I didn't know you spoke Spanish.

873
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:19,526
Yeah, I took it in high school.

874
01:01:19,735 --> 01:01:20,895
A bunch of times.

875
01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:23,705
Are you fluent?

876
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,901
No. I feel fine.

877
01:01:29,387 --> 01:01:31,048
Got something for you.

878
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:35,194
Thanks.

879
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:39,462
Flower guy was closed,
so I picked those up for you.

880
01:01:39,773 --> 01:01:40,740
Great.

881
01:01:41,543 --> 01:01:42,635
Come on in.

882
01:01:44,548 --> 01:01:46,813
Candles and food and everything.

883
01:01:47,054 --> 01:01:48,715
Yeah. I figured, why go out?

884
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,093
We can stay in.

885
01:01:59,712 --> 01:02:01,839
So how's training going?

886
01:02:02,616 --> 01:02:03,811
Pretty good.

887
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:08,282
Got him a coach, he's starting
to listen. Things are looking up.

888
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:10,729
A coach? Really?

889
01:02:10,932 --> 01:02:12,195
Do I know him?

890
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:15,901
Sal Bandini. You heard of him?

891
01:02:17,546 --> 01:02:19,343
No, I don't think I know him.

892
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,140
He's old school.

893
01:02:22,055 --> 01:02:23,249
Yeah, he's a real pro.

894
01:02:23,692 --> 01:02:25,957
Kind of been training alongside him...

895
01:02:26,197 --> 01:02:29,656
...so picking up some really,
really awesome moves.

896
01:02:30,306 --> 01:02:32,297
Awesome moves, huh?

897
01:02:34,813 --> 01:02:37,407
I'd love you to show me
your awesome moves.

898
01:02:42,462 --> 01:02:44,123
Show me what you got, big boy.

899
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:47,534
Well, I got some moves for you.

900
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:52,046
Are you sure?

901
01:02:52,982 --> 01:02:54,449
I'm sure.

902
01:03:01,098 --> 01:03:02,156
That was a snap-mare.

903
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,604
Take me to the bedroom.

904
01:03:09,214 --> 01:03:11,842
I meant, why don't we wrestle in here?

905
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,552
Bedroom match.

906
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,183
I'd love to wrestle you in here.

907
01:03:17,396 --> 01:03:18,863
Give it to me, big boy.

908
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,412
I will now unveil my...

909
01:03:30,654 --> 01:03:32,519
...secret weapons.

910
01:03:34,864 --> 01:03:36,229
Foreign objects!

911
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:41,674
Oh, God!

912
01:03:45,316 --> 01:03:47,682
Dear Dad: I am fine.

913
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,825
Sean and I are helping Jimmy King
reclaim his lost glory.

914
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:56,995
King's a good man who just
seems to have lost his way.

915
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,004
Also, Dad, I met this
really, really sweet girl.

916
01:04:00,246 --> 01:04:02,545
And I'm not a virgin anymore.

917
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:06,187
Sorry about missing
the state trooper's exam.

918
01:04:06,424 --> 01:04:10,191
I'm sure there's another one coming up
that you can force me to take.

919
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:21,615
Respectfully, Gordon.

920
01:04:22,422 --> 01:04:25,915
Sweetie, I don't think King needs
any other wrestlers.

921
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:28,894
- I think it's a bad idea.
- You think so, boopie?

922
01:04:29,603 --> 01:04:31,070
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

923
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:33,706
Boopie thinks it's a bad idea.
We shouldn't do it.

924
01:04:33,945 --> 01:04:36,608
I think that boopie
should keep her mouth shut.

925
01:04:36,883 --> 01:04:39,010
- Don't talk to boopie like that.
- I'm telling you...

926
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:42,088
...I have a terrible vibe
about this whole thing.

927
01:04:42,328 --> 01:04:45,992
Listen. You need a posse of guys
who are gonna support you.

928
01:04:47,371 --> 01:04:49,465
There he is. Come on.

929
01:04:53,415 --> 01:04:56,317
Oh, hey, Big Bill!
Goldberg, what are you doing?

930
01:04:56,554 --> 01:04:59,251
I didn't know you were in town.
You're looking good.

931
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,861
What's going on? Why are you here?

932
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:03,726
I'm doing Letterman.

933
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:06,996
What are you doing here?
Preparing for your execution?

934
01:05:09,312 --> 01:05:11,304
- You think I have no chance?
- Get real.

935
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:14,883
Sinclair's pissed off,
and he'll make an example out of you.

936
01:05:15,122 --> 01:05:18,354
Face it. You're a second-rate
wrestler and a third-rate man.

937
01:05:18,596 --> 01:05:21,225
You're still sore about
that spot I blew in Akron.

938
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:22,825
You were drunk.

939
01:05:23,072 --> 01:05:26,065
I'm sorry. I was having
terrible back spasms that day.

940
01:05:26,311 --> 01:05:27,335
You puked on me.

941
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:29,309
The audience liked it.

942
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:30,540
I was your partner!

943
01:05:32,956 --> 01:05:35,755
I made you. If it wasn't for me,
you'd be nothing.

944
01:05:35,928 --> 01:05:36,917
Yeah?

945
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,789
Damn.

946
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:43,238
Mr. Goldberg, that was a nice throw.
How you doing?

947
01:05:43,442 --> 01:05:46,378
We represent Mr. King
in his upcoming pay-per-view.

948
01:05:46,615 --> 01:05:49,550
You are the mack. You are it, man!

949
01:05:49,787 --> 01:05:51,688
His majesty needs you in the corner.

950
01:05:51,924 --> 01:05:54,825
Look, I used to look up to Jimmy
just like you two.

951
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:58,129
But the fact is, he let me down.

952
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:01,032
I know. I know. King lost his way.

953
01:06:01,274 --> 01:06:03,606
But he has seen the light.
He's a changed man.

954
01:06:03,845 --> 01:06:05,211
The change is coming!

955
01:06:05,449 --> 01:06:07,177
Please, for a second...?

956
01:06:07,851 --> 01:06:10,480
Whatever's happened in the past
is the past.

957
01:06:10,724 --> 01:06:12,955
But ultimately,
he's your friend, right?

958
01:06:13,195 --> 01:06:16,961
And you can't turn your back
on a friend. Right?

959
01:06:17,403 --> 01:06:20,895
Sorry, guys.
The fact is, I work alone.

960
01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:04,417
That's him.

961
01:07:18,849 --> 01:07:20,510
Sal Bandini. Want to wrestle?

962
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:39,107
Who's your daddy, bitch?

963
01:07:39,653 --> 01:07:40,621
Who sent you?

964
01:07:40,855 --> 01:07:42,550
Sinclair.

965
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:45,792
He wants you to stay away from King.

966
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:48,829
You tell your boss
I'll train whoever I want.

967
01:08:00,057 --> 01:08:02,082
I'm so sorry, Gordie.

968
01:08:02,595 --> 01:08:04,563
It's not your fault, Sasha.

969
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:06,459
Poor Sal.

970
01:08:08,205 --> 01:08:10,070
Mr. Bandini's a tough old man.

971
01:08:10,576 --> 01:08:13,910
But he'll have to stay here a while.
He's got multiple injuries.

972
01:08:15,987 --> 01:08:17,079
Any questions?

973
01:08:17,323 --> 01:08:18,688
- Can we see him?
- Sure.

974
01:08:19,826 --> 01:08:21,590
I'm gonna get him a Butterfinger.

975
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:24,094
I have to use the little girls' room.

976
01:08:30,614 --> 01:08:32,479
Can I have a Butterfinger too?

977
01:08:36,924 --> 01:08:37,892
It's over.

978
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:39,116
It's done.

979
01:08:39,396 --> 01:08:41,227
Now can I please get out of here?

980
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:43,928
Sasha, take it easy.
You did good.

981
01:08:44,272 --> 01:08:47,106
Titus, I'm wasting my time
at the hospital.

982
01:08:47,378 --> 01:08:50,245
Poor guy should be in the morgue
after what you guys did.

983
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:52,980
Who do you wuv?

984
01:08:54,022 --> 01:08:55,820
I wuv you.

985
01:08:57,896 --> 01:09:00,525
Now, please, just get me out of here.

986
01:09:00,768 --> 01:09:03,635
Bandini guy's like
100 years old, anyway.

987
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:05,000
105.

988
01:09:05,777 --> 01:09:08,906
But tell that to
Saturn and Sid Vicious over here.

989
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:10,412
Morons.

990
01:09:12,088 --> 01:09:13,454
You did great.

991
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:17,629
So how does head Nitro Girl sound?

992
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:19,994
My balls are in my throat...

993
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:23,563
...my prostate is the size
of a melon...

994
01:09:23,943 --> 01:09:26,538
...and I'm crapping tapioca.

995
01:09:27,116 --> 01:09:29,346
I feel like a kid again.

996
01:09:31,758 --> 01:09:34,124
Don't worry about me.
Sit down. Sit down.

997
01:09:38,069 --> 01:09:38,866
Listen to me.

998
01:09:39,105 --> 01:09:41,266
And this is the final lesson.

999
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,076
Always attack a man's strengths.

1000
01:09:45,784 --> 01:09:47,547
I think he means weaknesses.

1001
01:09:48,055 --> 01:09:49,488
No, I mean strengths.

1002
01:09:49,724 --> 01:09:53,957
No one ever expects you to attack
the strongest part of the fort.

1003
01:09:54,533 --> 01:09:55,864
Up the middle.

1004
01:09:56,102 --> 01:09:58,071
That's where the action is.

1005
01:09:58,608 --> 01:09:59,973
And it's the same in life.

1006
01:10:01,012 --> 01:10:03,105
Look, I know you got demons.

1007
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:04,948
But don't run away.

1008
01:10:05,187 --> 01:10:08,748
Attack them head on as
they're coming to you full speed.

1009
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:11,121
Because that, my friend...

1010
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:13,128
...is living.

1011
01:10:17,175 --> 01:10:19,201
Got something for you, Sal.

1012
01:10:19,813 --> 01:10:20,939
My favorite!

1013
01:10:21,682 --> 01:10:24,447
- Thank you.
- Can we do anything for you?

1014
01:10:24,922 --> 01:10:26,651
Get out of town.

1015
01:10:27,294 --> 01:10:29,785
This place is no good for a wrestler.

1016
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:31,590
Get back to basics.

1017
01:10:32,203 --> 01:10:33,636
I know a place we can do that.

1018
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:39,079
Oh, man!

1019
01:10:39,315 --> 01:10:41,341
This town turned my head around.

1020
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:44,287
Forgot our mission,
what was important.

1021
01:10:44,624 --> 01:10:48,618
You know what? I'll do what it takes
from here on out to get the job done.

1022
01:10:48,865 --> 01:10:51,130
Yes, you are. And I am too.

1023
01:10:53,073 --> 01:10:54,837
We're gonna get you that belt back.

1024
01:10:55,077 --> 01:10:56,840
Man, I don't know, baby.

1025
01:10:57,247 --> 01:10:58,215
What?

1026
01:10:58,750 --> 01:10:59,717
What?

1027
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,848
What's the matter?
What did Sal just say?

1028
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,923
It's about what's in here!

1029
01:11:06,765 --> 01:11:07,891
Dude...

1030
01:11:08,668 --> 01:11:11,365
...you just crushed
my Butterfinger, baby.

1031
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:13,632
Butterfinger?!

1032
01:11:13,878 --> 01:11:15,779
Get in the van now, okay?

1033
01:11:16,016 --> 01:11:17,142
Sorry.

1034
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:20,813
Sorry, I had to make a call.

1035
01:11:21,259 --> 01:11:22,556
How's Sal?

1036
01:11:22,794 --> 01:11:24,888
- He's gonna make it.
- Oh, good.

1037
01:11:27,937 --> 01:11:30,099
That's more than I can say for us.

1038
01:11:30,809 --> 01:11:31,935
What's going on?

1039
01:11:32,545 --> 01:11:34,343
We're going back to basics.

1040
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:35,880
To find our heart.

1041
01:11:36,252 --> 01:11:37,241
Well, can I come?

1042
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:40,549
No. Because you don't have one.

1043
01:12:08,044 --> 01:12:10,274
I can't believe I met Goldberg.

1044
01:12:10,782 --> 01:12:12,876
That's cool, you know?

1045
01:12:17,562 --> 01:12:20,087
I know you don't wanna talk
about your fallout...

1046
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:21,665
You're right. I don't.

1047
01:12:21,902 --> 01:12:24,769
- Look, I just...
- Mind your own business, all right?

1048
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:30,609
Where we going, King?

1049
01:12:30,886 --> 01:12:32,820
There's something I gotta do.

1050
01:12:39,302 --> 01:12:40,826
Hello, Eugenia.

1051
01:12:41,539 --> 01:12:42,563
Jimmy King.

1052
01:12:45,846 --> 01:12:47,838
You are a bastard!

1053
01:12:50,955 --> 01:12:52,184
Let me help you up.

1054
01:12:53,727 --> 01:12:55,092
I guess I deserved that.

1055
01:12:56,933 --> 01:12:59,231
I just had to kick you
in the diddly again.

1056
01:13:02,409 --> 01:13:03,376
Jesus!

1057
01:13:03,578 --> 01:13:05,877
Oh, the humanity. Make it stop.

1058
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:10,990
How's your diddly?

1059
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,193
Hope I broke it.

1060
01:13:13,396 --> 01:13:15,331
It's definitely bruised.

1061
01:13:15,967 --> 01:13:18,493
What the hell you thinking,
coming back here?

1062
01:13:19,006 --> 01:13:20,132
I'm not exactly sure.

1063
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:22,777
I think that the King
is ready to be a man.

1064
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:25,315
Well, how does it feel?

1065
01:13:26,085 --> 01:13:29,613
Like Richard Petty ran a stock car
into my balls...

1066
01:13:29,893 --> 01:13:31,862
...going 400 miles an hour.

1067
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,799
Well, look what the rat puked up.

1068
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:38,336
Oh, Jesus.

1069
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:42,271
You mean "cat," son, don't you?

1070
01:13:42,482 --> 01:13:44,143
I ain't your son.

1071
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:46,713
Frankie...

1072
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:49,517
...I came to say I was sorry.

1073
01:13:50,163 --> 01:13:51,425
Too late!

1074
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,029
Jesus, look at that grill!

1075
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,499
I mean, no, son. How you doing?
It's good to see...

1076
01:14:00,849 --> 01:14:03,216
Eugenia, please.

1077
01:14:04,956 --> 01:14:07,357
I'm sorry that I took off on you...

1078
01:14:07,596 --> 01:14:09,860
...when I should've been
taking care of you.

1079
01:14:10,601 --> 01:14:12,365
Really. I'm really sorry.

1080
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:16,299
You can fry ice in hell, you bastard!

1081
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:20,449
What's the good in saying you're sorry?
What are you gonna do about it?

1082
01:14:20,687 --> 01:14:21,551
What am I gonna do?

1083
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,693
Well, I'm gonna get that belt back.

1084
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:29,492
I'm gonna win $1 million.

1085
01:14:29,736 --> 01:14:33,571
I'm gonna pay off all my debts.
I'm gonna do the right thing by you.

1086
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:35,434
That's what I'm gonna do.

1087
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:42,088
And by God, I'm gonna get that boy
a damn good dentist.

1088
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:56,772
Yo, Sean!

1089
01:14:57,954 --> 01:14:59,946
Wyoming! We're home, baby.

1090
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:03,528
We're home, baby. Wyoming.

1091
01:15:10,825 --> 01:15:12,453
No place like home.

1092
01:15:14,011 --> 01:15:15,740
I can breathe out here.

1093
01:15:27,316 --> 01:15:29,546
Approach the vehicle, son.

1094
01:15:30,635 --> 01:15:31,829
Hi, Dad.

1095
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:32,970
No back talk.

1096
01:15:33,722 --> 01:15:34,781
No excuses.

1097
01:15:35,465 --> 01:15:36,898
Just get in the car.

1098
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:45,511
- What'd he do?
- Nothing.

1099
01:15:51,326 --> 01:15:53,318
You're gonna be a cop, little mister.

1100
01:15:53,563 --> 01:15:57,523
No skimpy outfits,
no touching other men.

1101
01:15:58,201 --> 01:16:01,467
But I'm destined for other things.
I'm following my dream.

1102
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:03,197
Well, your dream is stupid!

1103
01:16:03,474 --> 01:16:07,935
Just because it's your dream doesn't
make it right or noble or whatever.

1104
01:16:08,181 --> 01:16:10,514
Charlie Manson was
following his dream.

1105
01:16:10,718 --> 01:16:13,779
Joe Stalin, Michael Bolton...
You get my point?

1106
01:16:35,414 --> 01:16:37,212
That's a 211, breaking and entering.

1107
01:16:38,852 --> 01:16:41,549
Gordie, come on.
We need you, brother. Let's go.

1108
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:45,822
Gordie, we need you, baby.
I need you.

1109
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:48,192
I need you in my corner, man.

1110
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:50,689
I need you to help me pick my posse.

1111
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,677
I don't know if I can do this
without you.

1112
01:16:54,912 --> 01:16:56,470
- Really?
- Yeah.

1113
01:16:56,707 --> 01:16:57,675
You do?

1114
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:01,513
I need you to help us go down to Vegas
and rule ass! Let's go!

1115
01:17:01,759 --> 01:17:03,159
Let's begone!

1116
01:17:08,217 --> 01:17:09,241
I can't.

1117
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:12,921
I gotta study for this cop exam.

1118
01:17:13,159 --> 01:17:14,126
My dad...

1119
01:17:19,394 --> 01:17:22,056
It's your dream.
It's your dream. Come on.

1120
01:17:26,798 --> 01:17:27,890
My dream's stupid.

1121
01:17:32,131 --> 01:17:34,760
Time for me to get rid of
all this junk.

1122
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:39,495
You know, get rid of all my childish
things. Time for me to grow up.

1123
01:17:44,804 --> 01:17:46,773
We've come all this way.

1124
01:17:48,672 --> 01:17:50,300
Why are you giving up on me now?

1125
01:17:53,111 --> 01:17:54,271
I'm sorry.

1126
01:17:55,848 --> 01:17:56,940
I can't.

1127
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,820
You guys better get out of here.

1128
01:18:03,324 --> 01:18:04,985
My dad'll shoot you.

1129
01:18:05,226 --> 01:18:06,352
He will.

1130
01:18:24,684 --> 01:18:25,652
Next, please.

1131
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:32,782
Hell, everybody knows
wrestling's fake.

1132
01:18:39,269 --> 01:18:40,759
That feel fake?

1133
01:18:48,268 --> 01:18:51,636
We are Satan's Siamese twins!

1134
01:18:52,585 --> 01:18:55,076
You guys aren't really
Siamese twins, are you?

1135
01:18:57,458 --> 01:18:58,425
Sorry.

1136
01:19:04,801 --> 01:19:09,205
Oklahoma, where the wind goes
Sweeping down the plains

1137
01:19:09,424 --> 01:19:12,882
Where the waving wheat
Sure smells sweet

1138
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:17,079
Aren't these the auditions
for Oklahoma?

1139
01:19:19,486 --> 01:19:21,009
Okay, Dawkins, who's left?

1140
01:19:21,217 --> 01:19:23,277
First, Fireman Fred.

1141
01:19:24,378 --> 01:19:27,280
I'm Fireman Fred,
and I'm gonna hose you!

1142
01:19:29,202 --> 01:19:31,467
Those are good, right?

1143
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:33,428
Next, this is The Chewer.

1144
01:19:40,744 --> 01:19:43,008
Come on. Last, but not least...

1145
01:19:43,495 --> 01:19:44,929
...this is Kitty.

1146
01:19:46,418 --> 01:19:50,617
Hi, darling, I'm afraid we need to
take people who can help us in Vegas.

1147
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,188
My friends, they call me Pretty Kitty.

1148
01:19:59,868 --> 01:20:01,837
What's she gonna do,
boob them to death?

1149
01:20:04,273 --> 01:20:05,831
How you feeling, big guy?

1150
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:08,974
- I feel pretty good.
- Good.

1151
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:10,943
Haven't felt this good in a long time.

1152
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:12,843
Good. Keep it up.

1153
01:20:13,551 --> 01:20:15,417
You ready for Vegas tomorrow?

1154
01:20:15,654 --> 01:20:16,678
Yeah.

1155
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:19,347
I wish Gordie was coming.

1156
01:20:19,559 --> 01:20:20,821
Me too.

1157
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:30,697
Thank you.

1158
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:32,999
Thank you.

1159
01:20:36,379 --> 01:20:37,347
Thank you very much.

1160
01:20:40,751 --> 01:20:43,084
See you, now. Bye-bye.

1161
01:20:44,223 --> 01:20:46,055
Hey, Sean.

1162
01:20:46,327 --> 01:20:48,659
I saw you on TNT.
What was New York like?

1163
01:20:48,862 --> 01:20:50,524
It was good. It was fun.

1164
01:20:50,765 --> 01:20:54,292
You know, but I'm not much
of a big-city fella.

1165
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:57,238
My heart's right here in Lusk.

1166
01:20:57,472 --> 01:20:58,872
I'll see you, okay?

1167
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:05,843
Excuse me.

1168
01:21:06,784 --> 01:21:07,911
Hi, Wendy.

1169
01:21:09,154 --> 01:21:12,283
I couldn't stop thinking about
how you were always nice to me.

1170
01:21:12,725 --> 01:21:17,129
And I was thinking I should've been a
lot nicer back. I got you something.

1171
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,766
Thank you, Sean.

1172
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:24,406
Like it?

1173
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,701
It's the greatest.

1174
01:21:28,379 --> 01:21:30,314
I have a gift for you too.

1175
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:32,978
Come here.

1176
01:21:55,212 --> 01:21:57,841
Really wish I could go with you,
but I can't.

1177
01:21:58,783 --> 01:21:59,909
I'm sorry.

1178
01:22:00,386 --> 01:22:02,217
I feel like I let you down.

1179
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:05,023
I understand. Really, I do.

1180
01:22:05,227 --> 01:22:07,058
And I want to tell you something.

1181
01:22:07,295 --> 01:22:09,196
No matter what happens in Vegas...

1182
01:22:09,398 --> 01:22:12,196
...I can't thank you enough
for what you did for me.

1183
01:22:13,302 --> 01:22:14,496
All right?

1184
01:22:16,173 --> 01:22:17,732
Good luck to you, now.

1185
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:23,510
You take care of yourself.

1186
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,380
Wait! Stop the car!

1187
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:59,259
Good luck, King!

1188
01:22:59,994 --> 01:23:01,461
- You all right?
- Totally.

1189
01:23:01,664 --> 01:23:04,326
- I just want to say good luck.
- Thank you.

1190
01:23:04,534 --> 01:23:06,799
- I'll see you at the restaurant.
- Definitely.

1191
01:23:10,675 --> 01:23:12,267
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1192
01:23:12,477 --> 01:23:15,140
I'll totally be thinking of you. Bye!

1193
01:23:58,168 --> 01:24:00,637
Listen to me very carefully.

1194
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,368
If you plan to have
any future at all...

1195
01:24:06,579 --> 01:24:08,275
...in my business...

1196
01:24:09,783 --> 01:24:12,514
...you will not allow Jimmy King...

1197
01:24:13,221 --> 01:24:15,155
...to reach that belt.

1198
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:17,781
What?

1199
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,019
Excuse me, Mr. Sinclair?
They're ready.

1200
01:24:20,262 --> 01:24:21,662
Thank you.

1201
01:24:26,872 --> 01:24:29,467
I will kill you if you fuck this up.

1202
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:51,362
Looking good, baby.

1203
01:24:51,937 --> 01:24:54,462
Thank you. You're looking good.

1204
01:24:55,207 --> 01:24:56,436
Am I?

1205
01:24:57,043 --> 01:24:58,476
Are you ready?

1206
01:25:05,521 --> 01:25:07,079
Hell, yeah.

1207
01:25:09,826 --> 01:25:11,919
Ladies and gentlemen...

1208
01:25:12,095 --> 01:25:16,465
- Why did you drag me here?
- Because he sent the tickets.

1209
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:20,104
And welcome to One-Man Suicide!

1210
01:25:20,805 --> 01:25:24,367
Tonight the WCW belt...

1211
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:26,341
...is on the line!

1212
01:25:27,849 --> 01:25:32,310
One million dollars is on the line!

1213
01:25:33,756 --> 01:25:36,248
And one man's life...

1214
01:25:36,893 --> 01:25:40,057
...is on the line!

1215
01:25:44,837 --> 01:25:46,134
Jimmy King!

1216
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:48,806
You want the belt?

1217
01:25:49,443 --> 01:25:51,809
Come on down and get it!

1218
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:57,949
It's on top of the cage of death.

1219
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,211
Which is on top of another cage.

1220
01:26:01,425 --> 01:26:05,988
Which is yet on top of another cage!

1221
01:26:10,102 --> 01:26:11,400
Three cages...

1222
01:26:12,472 --> 01:26:14,167
...two warriors...

1223
01:26:15,176 --> 01:26:16,734
...one belt.

1224
01:26:17,478 --> 01:26:18,843
Triple cage.

1225
01:26:19,314 --> 01:26:21,839
Come on down.

1226
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:28,322
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time...

1227
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:33,129
...for the WCW Royal Bash main event...

1228
01:26:33,665 --> 01:26:38,103
...for the Heavyweight Championship
of the World!

1229
01:26:40,941 --> 01:26:43,910
Coming to the ring first,
from Marietta, Georgia...

1230
01:26:44,077 --> 01:26:46,774
Okay, baby, triple cage.

1231
01:26:47,014 --> 01:26:50,542
You watch my back.
Keep that posse on standby.

1232
01:26:51,287 --> 01:26:53,949
Jimmy King!

1233
01:26:56,927 --> 01:26:58,623
Watch out for the pyro!

1234
01:26:59,397 --> 01:27:00,523
What was that?

1235
01:27:03,235 --> 01:27:05,226
What was that last thing?

1236
01:27:06,439 --> 01:27:08,533
Oh, my God, I'm on fire! I'm melting!

1237
01:27:08,742 --> 01:27:11,803
I'm melting!
Sweet Jesus, I'm melting!

1238
01:27:13,248 --> 01:27:16,047
I said, "Watch out for the pyro."

1239
01:27:16,385 --> 01:27:19,115
And now, making his entrance
to the ring...

1240
01:27:19,423 --> 01:27:20,755
...DDP...

1241
01:27:20,957 --> 01:27:23,892
...Diamond Dallas Page!

1242
01:27:39,215 --> 01:27:42,913
I heard Sal was just too beat up
to make the trip.

1243
01:27:44,354 --> 01:27:48,587
And now the triple cage is
in place and ready.

1244
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:52,854
The challenger and champion are ready.

1245
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,428
Are we ready?

1246
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,832
For the thousands in attendance...

1247
01:28:02,009 --> 01:28:05,173
...and the millions watching
around the world...

1248
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:07,839
...ladies and gentlemen...

1249
01:28:08,217 --> 01:28:09,412
...we are...

1250
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:13,078
...ready to rumble!

1251
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:25,396
See you in hell.

1252
01:28:25,607 --> 01:28:29,772
There's the opening bell. You can feel
the electricity and the emotion...

1253
01:28:29,978 --> 01:28:31,606
...in this great arena.

1254
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,216
Come on, let's do this!

1255
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:41,321
You can't spit!

1256
01:28:46,566 --> 01:28:47,362
Yeah, that's it!

1257
01:28:54,744 --> 01:28:56,678
Oh, jeez, God, that's bad.

1258
01:29:03,055 --> 01:29:05,854
Come on, King.
Let me give you a hand, buddy.

1259
01:29:06,358 --> 01:29:07,347
Page!

1260
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:12,223
You idiot! That stuff doesn't work.

1261
01:29:15,504 --> 01:29:17,768
A diamond upside down is a pussy!

1262
01:29:17,973 --> 01:29:19,771
- Come on, King!
- Son of a bitch!

1263
01:29:19,975 --> 01:29:21,806
King positioning the ladder
in the ring.

1264
01:29:21,977 --> 01:29:23,069
Hurry up! Come on!

1265
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,544
He's headed up to the second cage.

1266
01:29:25,748 --> 01:29:26,578
Get him now!

1267
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:30,619
Who are these two guys that are
coming out? That's Juventud Guerrero.

1268
01:29:31,623 --> 01:29:34,593
Juventud Guerrero just
drop-kicked the ladder!

1269
01:29:36,965 --> 01:29:38,899
Who's that other masked wrestler?

1270
01:29:40,736 --> 01:29:43,068
- The crown!
- King's going for the crown!

1271
01:29:43,271 --> 01:29:44,932
Come on, King.

1272
01:29:45,107 --> 01:29:47,735
Smack him around like
a toothless crack whore!

1273
01:29:51,249 --> 01:29:54,651
Everybody out here now!
All of you, let's go! Come on!

1274
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:58,046
Four men are coming out.
Of course, it's DDP's goons.

1275
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:02,025
Look out, Jimmy!

1276
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:12,332
Yeah, baby! That's it!
That's what I'm talking about!

1277
01:30:14,244 --> 01:30:15,472
Don't, Dad, don't!

1278
01:30:15,712 --> 01:30:17,010
Don't do it, Dad.

1279
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:18,945
Why did Jimmy King stop?

1280
01:30:19,484 --> 01:30:22,716
What's going on here?
He just stopped in his tracks.

1281
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:25,052
Son?

1282
01:30:25,259 --> 01:30:27,625
Jesus, what the hell are you doing?

1283
01:30:27,828 --> 01:30:28,817
Paying you back!

1284
01:30:32,501 --> 01:30:35,733
Now Jimmy King's the recipient
of a horrible beating.

1285
01:30:35,938 --> 01:30:37,873
And it all started with his own son.

1286
01:30:49,088 --> 01:30:50,146
Yeah, baby!

1287
01:30:52,192 --> 01:30:53,181
Here comes relief.

1288
01:30:53,727 --> 01:30:56,720
Look, it's Goldberg.
It's the Disco Inferno...

1289
01:30:56,932 --> 01:30:58,490
...Kidman and Booker T.!

1290
01:30:59,501 --> 01:31:02,198
There's no way they can
get through the gate.

1291
01:31:04,374 --> 01:31:06,774
Mike, what is this?
What's this right here?

1292
01:31:29,739 --> 01:31:32,368
- Get him good!
- You want to turn that crap off?

1293
01:31:32,976 --> 01:31:35,445
My son almost threw away a career
for that nonsense.

1294
01:31:35,681 --> 01:31:38,206
Your son's starting a career
with that nonsense.

1295
01:31:38,418 --> 01:31:39,909
Hit him, hit him.

1296
01:31:40,086 --> 01:31:41,815
Come on. You can do it.

1297
01:31:42,923 --> 01:31:43,913
Come on, King!

1298
01:31:44,092 --> 01:31:46,185
Son of a bitch!

1299
01:31:47,662 --> 01:31:49,494
Get up and get that belt!

1300
01:31:50,066 --> 01:31:53,127
That's my best friend.
He's not really a cop, though.

1301
01:31:56,408 --> 01:31:58,138
Harpoon his ass!

1302
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,676
That's my boy!

1303
01:32:07,454 --> 01:32:09,115
Nice spear, kid.

1304
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:11,247
Who you calling "kid"?

1305
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:13,825
You hear me?
Go in there and get them!

1306
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:17,055
Jimmy King has made his way
up to the second cage.

1307
01:32:17,267 --> 01:32:19,964
You have the right to an attorney!
If you cannot...

1308
01:32:20,471 --> 01:32:23,930
- Good to have you back, brother!
- Good to be back, brother.

1309
01:32:24,576 --> 01:32:27,101
Did you check it out?
Do you like my deal?

1310
01:32:27,312 --> 01:32:28,803
You're such the Ponch!

1311
01:32:29,015 --> 01:32:31,575
Gordie, you look great
in that uniform.

1312
01:32:31,819 --> 01:32:33,980
And the fans love you.

1313
01:32:34,155 --> 01:32:36,180
I think we should get back together.

1314
01:32:37,559 --> 01:32:40,529
I could never forgive you
for what you did to Sal.

1315
01:32:40,762 --> 01:32:42,024
You're a mean lady.

1316
01:32:43,665 --> 01:32:44,654
Shut up, Sean!

1317
01:32:44,901 --> 01:32:45,925
You shouldn't...

1318
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:51,040
...stand so close to the ring
when there's a ladder match going on.

1319
01:32:54,278 --> 01:32:56,974
Now both Diamond Dallas Page
and Jimmy King...

1320
01:32:57,617 --> 01:33:00,314
...have made it up to the second cage.

1321
01:33:07,529 --> 01:33:10,657
The further you get up,
the tougher it is...

1322
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,766
...and they are wasting each other.

1323
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:16,531
Can you imagine the intensity?

1324
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:21,678
This thing has turned into
a hard-core street fight.

1325
01:33:27,488 --> 01:33:30,947
DDP is headed up. He's made his way
into cage number three.

1326
01:33:54,822 --> 01:33:58,816
He just sent Jimmy King down
all the way to cage number one!

1327
01:34:07,738 --> 01:34:10,640
It's Sting! He nailed
Diamond Dallas Page!

1328
01:34:13,913 --> 01:34:15,312
What are you doing, freak?!

1329
01:34:16,616 --> 01:34:19,415
Sting is helping Jimmy King!
Can you believe this?

1330
01:34:19,788 --> 01:34:21,085
This is a shocker!

1331
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:25,725
Jimmy King's all right by me.

1332
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:28,288
You love Jimmy King.

1333
01:34:29,032 --> 01:34:30,660
I love Jimmy King.

1334
01:34:30,902 --> 01:34:31,994
We're men.

1335
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:35,299
And we're not afraid to say
that we love other men.

1336
01:34:36,075 --> 01:34:37,064
I love you.

1337
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:41,541
Me too, man. Hit me! My turn!

1338
01:34:42,516 --> 01:34:44,348
It's even. It's back to square one.

1339
01:34:45,253 --> 01:34:49,281
They're fighting their way up
the side of the cage toward the top.

1340
01:35:13,489 --> 01:35:15,924
Who the hell are you fighting for?

1341
01:35:16,092 --> 01:35:17,787
Me!

1342
01:35:40,389 --> 01:35:43,756
You got it, King! You got it!
Come on!

1343
01:36:09,293 --> 01:36:12,229
Diamond Dallas Page has taken
a horrible fall!

1344
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:13,692
He's down!

1345
01:36:18,637 --> 01:36:20,538
Yeah! Come on, buddy!

1346
01:36:33,458 --> 01:36:36,120
And Jimmy King has the belt!
He did it!

1347
01:36:36,327 --> 01:36:38,592
Jimmy King is the champion!

1348
01:36:39,831 --> 01:36:41,560
Yeah, baby!

1349
01:36:41,768 --> 01:36:43,429
You did it!

1350
01:36:58,789 --> 01:37:01,054
Yeah! That's right!

1351
01:37:05,632 --> 01:37:07,998
What a struggle, what a battle!

1352
01:37:08,201 --> 01:37:11,659
Jimmy King has overcome all the odds,
Mike! He's the champion!

1353
01:37:11,871 --> 01:37:14,397
You suck, Sinclair!

1354
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,835
Get out of here!

1355
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,683
What are you talking about?

1356
01:37:23,687 --> 01:37:26,350
I made wrestling! Me!

1357
01:37:26,858 --> 01:37:28,553
I made them all!

1358
01:37:30,896 --> 01:37:33,558
You didn't make wrestling!
We made wrestling!

1359
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:37,459
Yeah, geek.

1360
01:37:37,672 --> 01:37:40,164
The people, the fans made wrestling.

1361
01:37:53,559 --> 01:37:56,723
We want King! We want King!

1362
01:37:58,265 --> 01:38:01,633
In the most amazing battle ever
witnessed, ladies and gentlemen...

1363
01:38:01,836 --> 01:38:05,864
...the undisputed WCW
Heavyweight Champion of the World:

1364
01:38:06,075 --> 01:38:08,600
Jimmy King!

1365
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,145
You regained the heavyweight title.

1366
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:16,218
What about tag-team belts?
Any thoughts about unification?

1367
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:19,982
Excuse me. Jimmy, looks like
you need a tag-team partner.

1368
01:38:20,191 --> 01:38:21,488
What do you say?

1369
01:38:22,127 --> 01:38:24,926
Bill, I appreciate it. Really, I do.

1370
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:30,629
But I think I already got me
a tag-team partner out here somewhere.

1371
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,366
Where is he?

1372
01:38:35,244 --> 01:38:37,338
There he is. That's him right there.

1373
01:38:38,615 --> 01:38:40,516
My new tag-team partner.

1374
01:38:40,718 --> 01:38:42,777
That's Gordie Boggs, a.k.a. The Law!

1375
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:47,948
I will bust you!

1376
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:50,653
That's it! That's it!

1377
01:38:50,864 --> 01:38:52,855
Right here's our new manager...

1378
01:38:53,066 --> 01:38:55,865
...Sean "Sugar Daddy" Dawkins!

1379
01:39:00,843 --> 01:39:02,869
I love you, Sean!

1380
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:05,048
I love Sean!

1381
01:39:30,347 --> 01:39:31,609
So you see...

1382
01:39:31,983 --> 01:39:33,315
...dreams can come true.

1383
01:39:33,517 --> 01:39:36,008
Yeah, but it was a one-time deal.

1384
01:39:36,187 --> 01:39:39,316
Like you'll really manage King,
and Gordie's gonna wrestle.

1385
01:39:56,848 --> 01:39:58,713
Can you say it now?

1386
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:03,381
I'm your bitch and you're my daddy?

1387
01:40:05,524 --> 01:40:07,185
Rolled right off his tongue.

1388
01:40:07,426 --> 01:40:09,861
That should teach you
to be nice to kids.

1389
01:40:15,303 --> 01:40:16,201
Gentlemen...

1390
01:40:17,006 --> 01:40:18,200
...we've gotta go.

1391
01:40:28,554 --> 01:40:31,080
God bless America!

1392
01:40:47,379 --> 01:40:49,677
You like Samoan butt sex?

1393
01:40:51,482 --> 01:40:55,078
There's a lot of glare coming off
of that dome of yours, anus-breath!

1394
01:40:55,253 --> 01:40:58,951
There's a lot of glare coming off
of that dome of yours, booger-face!

1395
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:02,617
I know. It smells like you poured it
right from your butt.

1396
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:05,823
Smells like you poured it
right from your butt. Sorry.

1397
01:41:08,972 --> 01:41:10,668
Wait, I forgot the line.

1398
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:13,070
Now I'm gonna get you!

1399
01:41:14,812 --> 01:41:15,779
Oh, shit, man!

1400
01:41:15,981 --> 01:41:19,076
Michael got himself a whore

1401
01:41:19,252 --> 01:41:20,719
Sorry.

1402
01:41:21,187 --> 01:41:23,179
That was quite a thrill.
How you...?

1403
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:25,153
That's my hand. It's broken now.

1404
01:41:25,326 --> 01:41:26,759
Come on, this is nothing!

1405
01:41:26,962 --> 01:41:29,897
You remember when Macho Man
threw you off the rail?

1406
01:41:30,198 --> 01:41:31,187
Go. Start again.

1407
01:41:31,399 --> 01:41:32,696
Come on, this is nothing!

1408
01:41:32,901 --> 01:41:35,598
You remember when Macho Man
threw you off the rail?

1409
01:41:35,806 --> 01:41:37,671
No, that's bad. One more time.

1410
01:41:37,875 --> 01:41:39,740
Come on, this is nothing!

1411
01:41:39,943 --> 01:41:41,138
- Sorry.
- Shut up.

1412
01:41:41,312 --> 01:41:45,044
Yeah, and he broke five ribs
and dislocated your shoulder...

1413
01:41:45,217 --> 01:41:47,276
...but you broke...

1414
01:41:47,653 --> 01:41:50,020
You broke five ribs
and dislocated your shoulder!

1415
01:41:50,191 --> 01:41:52,523
You still came back to whip all three!

1416
01:41:54,495 --> 01:41:56,690
He's worthless.

1417
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,493
He can't do it.

1418
01:42:00,538 --> 01:42:02,564
Breasts. Jugs. Hooters.

1419
01:42:03,842 --> 01:42:06,368
I can't stop looking at them!

1420
01:42:13,187 --> 01:42:14,711
Terrifying.

1421
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:32,743
Oh, the humanity!
