1
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,435
It is safe to assume
that professional wrestlers...

2
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:11,562
...are universally recognized
as the greatest athletes of all time.

3
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:15,668
Sammartino, Blassie,
Gorgeous George...

4
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,778
...George "The Animal" Steele,
Superfly Snooka...

5
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:21,142
...Andre the Giant, Hulk Hogan.

6
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,014
These are heroes of history.

7
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:28,383
Superior athletes...

8
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,024
...superior men.

9
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:40,995
Giants come and go in this great sport
of ours, but there is only one king:

10
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,760
Jimmy King.

11
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:46,296
Jimmy King is the greatest
wrestler of all time.

12
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,476
He's undefeated,
and he holds the record...

13
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:53,512
...for the longest winning streak in
the history of professional wrestling.

14
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,612
King says, and I quote:

15
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,051
"People said I was a dreamer...

16
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:04,885
...an idiot, and a waste of life,
and I will never amount to anything."

17
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,560
Hey, jackass.

18
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:11,196
You're a waste of life. Why don't you
go amount to nothing somewhere else?

19
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:15,733
And I told you little turdlets not to
park your junk in front of the shop!

20
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,571
Wrestling is for retards!

21
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,603
"Jimmy King's the greatest!"

22
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:26,080
You guys are as dumb as paint.

23
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:28,543
Really dumb paint.

24
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,581
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

25
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:36,418
Listen, Jimmy King is
the people's champion.

26
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,586
He's immortal, timeless.
He can raise the dead!

27
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:44,629
Can he really raise the dead? My dog,
Skipper, is buried under my sandbox.

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,691
Well, I don't know
about your dog, Skipper.

29
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,564
But don't worry,
because tomorrow night...

30
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,435
...Jimmy King is gonna whup
Diamond Dallas Page's ass.

31
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:55,940
We're gonna be there.

32
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:57,908
Right, Gordie?

33
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,414
Gordie?

34
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,353
Gordie?

35
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:16,964
What do you want, boob?

36
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,996
Purple sugar slush, king-size.

37
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,396
That'll be $1.26.

38
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:27,441
$1.25. That's all I got.

39
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:31,200
That's just not good enough,
now, is it, you little boob?

40
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:34,040
You little Jimmy the King fan boob!

41
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:38,651
Jimmy King's a big fat loser!
He's a sissy in tights!

42
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:43,222
There's a lot of glare coming off
that dome of yours, squirrel nuts!

43
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,759
Listen, sunshine...

44
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:50,692
...l'm gonna open up a fresh can
of whup-ass on you, boy!

45
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,095
Bring it on!

46
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,140
Tag me! Tag me!

47
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:06,646
Now you're gonna get it!

48
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,712
You messed with
the "Macho Man" Randy Savage!

49
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,980
I'm gonna get you! Yeah!

50
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,089
Bam! Bam! Bam!

51
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,227
King!

52
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,263
One! Two! Three!

53
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:12,011
Gordie?

54
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,883
Whoa, serious brain freeze.
That icy sugar locked up my nog-nog.

55
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,982
What about me, guy?
I was thirsty too.

56
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,247
I'll get you a refill.

57
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,481
No, don't sweat it.
The guy's a moron.

58
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,292
Come on, I feel bad.

59
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:29,928
Hey, Gordie?

60
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:31,762
Yeah?

61
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,830
Why does it look like you have
your finger in your butt?

62
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:37,197
Because I do.

63
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,475
Jerko, what do you want?

64
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,810
- I need a new sugar slush.
- Why?

65
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:54,680
There's something wrong
with this one. Smell it.

66
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,783
That's awful.

67
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:00,686
I know.

68
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,362
Smells like...

69
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:05,088
- Like...
- Like my ass, right?

70
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,696
- Or maybe your ass. It's weird, huh?
- Like a bitter, sour ass!

71
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,872
Like you poured it from your butt.

72
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,444
I will get you another one ASAP.

73
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:20,079
- Thanks.
- It's so bad.

74
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:21,646
How could you drink that?

75
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:26,920
I struggled through most of it, but
the butt-fruit settled at the bottom.

76
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,521
Freeze, loafer!

77
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,159
Come on. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

78
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,334
Come on, you know the drill.

79
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,805
You got any stuff on you?

80
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,476
Whoa. What's this?

81
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,644
My nuts.

82
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,679
Listen, pal, wouldn't you rather
be on the other side of this search?

83
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,647
You want me to grab your nuts?

84
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,683
Whoa. Yeah, you too.

85
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,689
Come on, sweetheart. Join the party.

86
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,449
Keep your hands where I can see them!

87
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,364
Dad, you gotta cut the crap
with the shakedowns.

88
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:15,935
You're gonna be a good cop, Gordie.
It'll change your life.

89
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,162
Look what it's done
for your mom and your sister.

90
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,533
What is this crap?

91
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:23,903
Wrestling?

92
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,843
Wrestling's fake.

93
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,948
Wrestling's not fake!

94
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:36,881
I like wrestling.

95
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:39,149
Are you gonna be a wrestler?

96
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:40,853
You got trouble...

97
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:44,724
...wrestling your wee-wee out
of your trousers to take a leak.

98
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,027
It's not that I have trouble.
Just sometimes I don't see the point.

99
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,293
Gordon.

100
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,869
Wrestling's a game for little boys.

101
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,571
Police work's for men.

102
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,411
Come on, let's bounce.

103
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,584
Wrestling's for dirtbags
and lily-pickers.

104
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,344
You'll be back.

105
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,579
The badge'll be waiting!

106
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,764
- My dad sucks, man.
- At least you got one.

107
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,906
Right, sorry. It's just that he's
always on my ass about getting a job.

108
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,041
I mean, he's making me
take that cop exam.

109
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,212
- You have a job.
- I know.

110
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,879
I should decide what
I want to do with my life.

111
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,314
- That's right.
- Like Jimmy King says:

112
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,284
"This is America.
I can be anyone I want!"

113
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,823
He actually says,
"I can beat up anyone I want."

114
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,654
- Really?
- Yeah.

115
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,830
But who cares, bro?
What's tonight?

116
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,862
Monday Night Nitro!

117
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,228
Live, baby, live
Live, baby, live

118
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,407
This'll be awesome.
It'll be out of control.

119
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,715
Page vs. King
and it's not a pay-per-view?

120
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:11,941
Oh, yeah!

121
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,119
Hey, shit-boys!
How's the shit work?

122
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,283
Excuse the mess.
My aim's a little off.

123
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,826
I've been using the jackhammer.

124
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,565
All done. We did it.
Good job, Gordie.

125
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,933
You too.

126
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,372
Little too much coffee for me today.

127
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,122
- Don't do it.
- What?

128
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,824
Don't "what" me.
You know what. Don't do it.

129
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,154
- Friends don't do it to friends.
- Okay.

130
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,758
If you do it, Jimmy King'll
get hurt tonight. Don't.

131
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,434
Don't worry. I won't.

132
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,850
Gordie?

133
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,055
Nothing can hurt Jimmy King.

134
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,422
Stop it!

135
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,586
Gordie, stop it, please!

136
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,130
I'm gonna kick your ass!

137
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,432
Make it stop!

138
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,701
Sorry, man, I couldn't help it.

139
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,934
Sean, are you okay, man?

140
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,406
Sean!

141
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,224
Couldn't help it?
I can't help delivering a suplex!

142
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,456
Get off me!

143
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,530
Welcome to EZ Take-Out Burger.
How may I help you?

144
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,800
Sean wants Brittany's taco,
with cheese all over it.

145
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:16,998
Stop!

146
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,476
I should have smelled it was you.
What do you guys want?

147
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,509
Hi, Brittany, I'm sorry.
Can I please have...

148
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,553
...a cheeseburger maxi-meal...

149
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,123
- And a Brittany bare-ass buffet...
- Please! Please!

150
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,154
What?

151
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,257
He said that he wanted the Brittany...
Stop it!

152
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,488
- Did you say...?
- We'll pull up now.

153
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,361
Why?

154
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,298
Why don't you just ask her out?

155
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,666
How does my hair look?
Is it the Finesse?

156
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,435
You're driving a truck of ass-juice.
Don't worry about your hair.

157
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:56,215
I cannot deal with these losers.
I'm gonna work with the cheese.

158
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,080
Hi, Gordie.

159
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,720
- Sean.
- Hi, Wendy.

160
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,152
- Where'd Brittany go?
- She switched to cheese.

161
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,192
Sean, you think King's gonna put
a hurting on Diamond Dallas Page?

162
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,860
Yes, I most certainly do.

163
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:17,332
Hey, Brittany! How's the weather
in there? Cold today, hot tamale?

164
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,561
Leave me alone, loser!

165
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:23,071
Au corvair. Would a loser
have two tickets...

166
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,871
...to Monday Night Nitro,
live from Cheyenne, tonight?

167
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,569
Yes.

168
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,883
Brittany, listen.
Let's go out again.

169
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,679
We'll go out.
We won't talk about wrestling.

170
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,048
We'll talk about us...

171
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:43,924
You should give up on Brittany.

172
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:48,930
No way. She's my dream girl, bro.
Come on.

173
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,831
Well, what about Wendy?
She digs you.

174
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,303
No. She's too much
like one of the guys.

175
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,677
- That's bad?
- That's gay.

176
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,082
Right.

177
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,585
Look what I made.

178
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:16,959
Oh, wicked.

179
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,024
No. It stands for something.

180
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,694
W-W-K-D.

181
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,603
"What Would King Do?"

182
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,166
When I got a problem
and don't know what to do...

183
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,968
...I look down, and I look at it
and I think:

184
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,339
What would King do?

185
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,015
Man, that rocks.

186
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,650
I made two.

187
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,290
That rocks hard, man.

188
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,255
Mrs. MacKenzie!

189
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,659
Ready for that big match tonight?

190
00:13:55,867 --> 00:14:00,429
Oh, yes, boys. Jimmy King is gonna
bitch-slap Diamond Dallas.

191
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,233
We're gonna be there.
We're going.

192
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,671
Get me a T-shirt.
A really tight one.

193
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:11,182
That's gross, Mrs. MacKenzie.

194
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,853
Freeze!

195
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,231
Your sister shot her first perp today.

196
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,099
That's nice, Gabby.

197
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,169
She put one shot in his right buttock.

198
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,840
Just doing her job.

199
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,643
That's great. See you guys later.

200
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You better be back by 11.

201
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,212
You got a police admission
seminar tomorrow.

202
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,675
I've given that a lot of thought...

203
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,047
See you at 11.

204
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:06,368
Kid, move your fat head!
I can't see!

205
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:09,301
Sorry, Uncle Billy said
they were good seats.

206
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,503
Uncle Billy sucks!

207
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,610
He lost his right nut in Nam.

208
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:17,339
Kick him in his left nut
when you see him. These seats bite!

209
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,818
Hey, if you only have one left...

210
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,951
...is it still your left nut?

211
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,751
Let's get closer.
King's coming up.

212
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,469
Nitro girls, dead ahead.

213
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,742
There's Chae. She's the best.

214
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,885
Do not concur.
Sasha is the best of the best.

215
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,502
How you doing, Booker?

216
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:17,435
How you doing, boys?
Look, King's late again.

217
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:20,667
I don't know what to do.
I'm so sick of this shit.

218
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:23,709
- What's the finish?
- The finish is gonna be...

219
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,714
He'll pile-drive you, crown you,
and he's gonna get the win.

220
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,910
Works for me.
I'll tell the King.

221
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:32,645
Nice to see you, Billy.

222
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,949
Dallas, I want to talk to you.

223
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:39,123
Forget what I just told you.

224
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,764
Remember I told you
I'd take care of you?

225
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,594
Tonight's your night.

226
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,826
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

227
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:48,702
Works for me, bro.

228
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:51,106
Ladies and gentlemen...

229
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:55,438
...here we go with tonight's main
event for the WCWheavyweight crown.

230
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:57,513
Page vs. King! Page vs. King!

231
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:59,979
- Hell, yeah!
- Page vs. King!

232
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,516
Diamond Dallas Page!

233
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,493
It's time, folks.
It's finally here.

234
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,930
King vs. Diamond Dallas Page.

235
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:22,835
Come on, Diamond Dallas.
Take it like the punk bitch you are!

236
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,607
The King of Rock
is holding court tonight.

237
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:30,177
Here's the reigning WCW Heavyweight...

238
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,076
...Champion of the World:

239
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:36,276
Please welcome Jimmy King!

240
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:38,415
Behold the King!

241
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:06,049
Yeah, baby!

242
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:08,080
All night long.

243
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,587
Here comes Jimmy.

244
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:18,694
Look at that. With all the majesty
and flair befitting a true king.

245
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:28,561
Hello, Cheyenne, Wyoming.
We're gonna rule some ass tonight!

246
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:34,468
I want to welcome you
to the royal ass-kicking...

247
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:37,168
...of Diamond Dallas Page!

248
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:43,610
You wanna see me make
Diamond Dallas Page...

249
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:47,119
...one of my ladies
in waiting tonight?

250
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:52,319
You wanna see me take
Diamond Dallas Page...

251
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:54,554
...down into my dungeon...

252
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:59,360
...and make him my medieval
puppy-dog bitch tonight?

253
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:02,301
Yeah! That's what I thought!

254
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:05,467
- I'm the...
- Sing it, man!

255
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:07,803
I'm King of Rock
There is none higher

256
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:10,309
Sucker emcees just call me sire

257
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:12,573
To rule my kingdom
You must use fire

258
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:15,884
I won't stop rocking till I retire

259
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:17,986
I love that shit!

260
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,359
Look and listen
to this capacity crowd...

261
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:34,129
...and the reaction we would
expect for Titus Sinclair...

262
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:36,066
...who's in the ring.

263
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:37,900
Glad you made it.

264
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,200
- Boo!
- You suck, Sinclair!

265
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:44,404
For chrissake, Titus,
you're hogging my spotlight.

266
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:47,982
Your spotlight?
I invented you, you idiot.

267
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,914
This is mine.
You seem to have forgotten that.

268
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,587
Count your money, midget.

269
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,324
You know, Jimmy...

270
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,925
...you're still the same dumb trailer
hitch I discovered 14 years ago.

271
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:07,662
I just want to have
this final moment together.

272
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,938
The bell sounds
and the battle is underway.

273
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:20,275
What, Elvis? Won't be on time
with the rest of us?

274
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:23,486
Traffic, baby, traffic.
Come on, come on!

275
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:28,822
You're not too good today, King.

276
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,890
- What you got?
- Hammerlock, baby.

277
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:32,494
Good God!

278
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:37,096
The King's showing
what's made him the champion.

279
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:38,690
Ready?

280
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:42,630
Good sound effects.

281
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:59,283
Double neck-breaker.
Both men are down!

282
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,088
What a vicious move that is!
King goes for the cover.

283
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:05,954
He's trying for an early win.
He didn't get it.

284
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,860
- Three!
- You do your job, I'll do mine.

285
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:20,207
Okay, Pagey. Hip toss, baby.

286
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:25,371
Oh, did you see that elbow?
Down goes Jimmy King!

287
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:27,071
What the hell was that?

288
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,126
Jimmy's in trouble!

289
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,727
This is as vicious as we've
ever seen Diamond Dallas Page!

290
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:42,022
- What are you doing?
- Get out of my face!

291
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,724
Why?

292
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,733
Boss's orders, fat boy.

293
00:21:56,613 --> 00:21:59,138
- Kick his leathery ass!
- Destroy him!

294
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:01,544
And Jimmy King is not done yet!

295
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:05,155
A pair of shots from King
has DDP on the defensive.

296
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:10,321
See you!

297
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:20,900
He broke the table!
Oh, my goodness!

298
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:27,632
King down on the floor,
trying to get up to a knee.

299
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:28,901
Come on, fat boy.

300
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:31,112
Let me help you back in. Come on.

301
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:36,579
Out of nowhere, Jimmy King with a
foreign object to the head of DDP!

302
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:38,345
King mounting the corner.

303
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:40,954
I think he's gonna
go up for the crown.

304
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:44,526
- Crown him, King!
- Prepare to be varnished!

305
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:57,472
Here's a move we've seen before.
Very familiar. Diamond Dallas...

306
00:22:57,673 --> 00:23:00,938
...motioning to the crowd that
it's time for the diamond cutter.

307
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:03,940
King caught him!

308
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:08,277
That will stop anything, including
the diamond cutter, I'll tell you.

309
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:10,348
Both men down!
Wait a minute!

310
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:13,250
Here come Page's goons,
led by Sid Vicious!

311
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:18,156
They're the biggest, meanest men
in our sport, coming to help Dallas.

312
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:19,587
Watch out, King!

313
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:29,264
Power bomb by Sid Vicious on King!

314
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:34,104
The double diamond cutter!

315
00:23:34,577 --> 00:23:35,669
No! No!

316
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,270
Toss him out!

317
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:46,278
Here they come! Finally, the King's
men have come to bail him out!

318
00:23:46,522 --> 00:23:48,490
- That's right!
- Oh, yeah!

319
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:53,094
The wrestlers are surrounding King.
I don't know what's going on here.

320
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:57,530
Wait a minute.
They're all attacking Jimmy King!

321
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:01,103
They turned on him!
Sinclair must have got to them.

322
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:06,574
What's wrong with you?

323
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:11,274
DDP motioning to his goons
to head up to the top rope.

324
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:13,549
King!

325
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,255
This is what you get when you
suck your money down the toilet!

326
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,190
- You jinxed him!
- No, God, no!

327
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:30,695
- Get off of me!
- This isn't even a pay-per-view!

328
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:32,066
Four men.

329
00:24:32,302 --> 00:24:35,169
There's four wrestlers
on the four corner posts.

330
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,672
- A four-post massacre!
- No one can survive this!

331
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:40,770
No!

332
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:56,922
It's a four-post massacre.
They all come up at the same time!

333
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:58,592
Incredible!

334
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:02,024
Come on, get up! Count him out!
Count him out!

335
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:08,594
Count it, ref.
One! Two! Three!

336
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:11,203
Ladies and gentlemen.

337
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:14,808
Your winner and new WCW...

338
00:25:15,044 --> 00:25:17,239
...Heavyweight Champion
of the World:

339
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:20,847
Diamond Dallas Page!

340
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:27,789
Ladies and gentlemen.

341
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:32,586
You have witnessed the demise...

342
00:25:32,828 --> 00:25:34,420
...of Jimmy King.

343
00:25:35,364 --> 00:25:38,060
He will never, ever...

344
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:42,499
...fight for the WCW again.

345
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:47,371
Long live the new king
and reigning champion...

346
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:50,977
...Diamond Dallas Page!

347
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:57,650
Feel that, Jimmy?

348
00:25:58,587 --> 00:26:00,646
That's your spotlight fading.

349
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:04,282
- Why?
- Why?

350
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,751
Why not?

351
00:26:06,996 --> 00:26:10,261
You're through. I'm done with you.

352
00:26:12,668 --> 00:26:14,499
Rest in peace.

353
00:26:32,488 --> 00:26:33,477
Damn allergies.

354
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:37,819
Yeah, me too.
Damn stupid allergies.

355
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:40,291
Unfair, bogus allergies!

356
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:47,396
Unfair, cheating, blind ref!

357
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,562
Bogus Sinclair allergies!

358
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:53,297
Damn Diamond Dallas Page!

359
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:55,841
Right, Sean, let it out, man.

360
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:59,481
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

361
00:27:13,194 --> 00:27:16,027
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy...

362
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,229
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

363
00:27:22,604 --> 00:27:23,662
Oh, my God.

364
00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:26,865
We made it!

365
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:28,872
We're alive!

366
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:33,104
Would that be raw sewage I'm smelling?

367
00:27:33,682 --> 00:27:36,879
Yeah. I kind of
always liked the smell.

368
00:27:38,154 --> 00:27:41,590
Yeah, me too.
Kind of smells like French toast.

369
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,516
What? French toast dipped in shit.

370
00:27:55,938 --> 00:27:58,771
Damn it, Jim.
We're firemen, not janitors.

371
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:01,465
We sure as hell
aren't gonna clean this up.

372
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:24,957
Shit!

373
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:43,614
What're the odds of that?

374
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:02,168
That truck and that business were
all my dad left me when he died.

375
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:05,067
That's all I've got
to remember him by.

376
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:09,610
I'll remember my dad by the epic
beating I get for coming home late.

377
00:29:11,113 --> 00:29:12,603
We got no jobs, Gordie.

378
00:29:12,848 --> 00:29:14,873
State police, here I come.

379
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:19,019
I can't believe how much we suck!

380
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:21,280
Everything's changed overnight.

381
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,991
Yeah, but if Jimmy King
can win the title back...

382
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:25,352
- Gordie.
- What?

383
00:29:25,594 --> 00:29:29,792
You heard what Sinclair said, right?
He kicked Jimmy King out of the WCW.

384
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:32,558
A lifetime ban. No rematch.

385
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:35,198
It's over, Gordie.

386
00:29:35,436 --> 00:29:37,700
Jimmy King's dead, okay?

387
00:29:38,673 --> 00:29:40,538
- Sean?
- What?

388
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:43,076
You think things
happen for a reason?

389
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,543
What could possibly
be the reason for this?

390
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:49,842
All right. Don't you think
it's a little strange...

391
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:53,053
...that we were in Cheyenne
the same day Jimmy King...

392
00:29:53,288 --> 00:29:57,725
...was cheated out of his title
and banned from the WCW for life?

393
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:02,363
Don't you think it's strange that
we crashed the truck on the way home?

394
00:30:02,597 --> 00:30:06,033
It's a little strange,
but what are we supposed to do?

395
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:07,496
Exactly.

396
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:09,661
What?

397
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:12,329
What would King do?

398
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:15,967
I don't know, Gordie.
What would he do?

399
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:18,771
I'll tell you.
He'd fight to make it right.

400
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:23,983
You just let me know when he
shows up and does that, okay?

401
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:28,421
There's a part of King inside me,
telling me we got one choice.

402
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:31,086
We gotta find Jimmy King.

403
00:30:32,294 --> 00:30:34,285
This must've happened for a reason.

404
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:36,622
It's gotta be some kind of test.

405
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:40,262
We gotta find the King.

406
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:44,672
We gotta find the King?

407
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:48,439
You and me?

408
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:53,377
Things happen for a reason, man.
We gotta find the King.

409
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,638
What do you say?

410
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:59,078
How far is Atlanta from here?

411
00:31:06,293 --> 00:31:08,193
Sir, it's cold.

412
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:09,963
Jerk!

413
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,392
- Oh, yes.
- Thank God.

414
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:21,407
Hey. We're trying to get to Atlanta.

415
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:24,440
We're headed to Daytona.
Atlanta's on our way.

416
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:26,411
Come on in, boys.

417
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:27,580
Hallelujah.

418
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:32,351
Kumbaya, my Lord

419
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:34,682
Kumbaya

420
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:39,217
Kumbaya, my Lord

421
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:41,859
Kumbaya

422
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:46,690
Michael, row your boat ashore

423
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:49,800
Alleluia

424
00:31:50,004 --> 00:31:53,235
Michael, row your boat ashore

425
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:55,575
Alleluia

426
00:31:58,245 --> 00:32:00,907
- Do you guys know any Van Halen?
- No.

427
00:32:01,748 --> 00:32:02,715
No.

428
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,617
No.

429
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:11,349
Running with the devil

430
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,091
Running with the devil

431
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,326
Break it down, mama.

432
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:25,471
I live my life
Like there's no tomorrow

433
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:29,164
All I've got I had to steal

434
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:30,940
She stole it.

435
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:35,615
I don't need to beg or borrow

436
00:32:35,816 --> 00:32:40,082
Yes, I'm living at a pace that kills

437
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:47,659
Running with the devil

438
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:51,926
Running with the devil

439
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:54,231
Oh, yeah

440
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:10,238
- Thank you.
- See you later.

441
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,249
You chicks rock!

442
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:19,123
Hey, bro, I know we just
got all this religion...

443
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,385
...but I got a question,
and I need a serious answer.

444
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:24,325
- Swear to God?
- Swear to God.

445
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,566
Did you fart in that van?

446
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:30,826
It wasn't me. Swear to God.

447
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:32,766
Me neither. Swear to God.

448
00:33:34,574 --> 00:33:36,166
Oh, my God.

449
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,435
They were the farting nuns.

450
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:42,675
Bingo!

451
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:44,314
Let's do this.

452
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:49,481
I will rule you!

453
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:59,463
Gonna be a while.
Me and Jimmy King don't lose.

454
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:03,165
Down with King?
Big Jimmy King fan?

455
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,403
King is king.

456
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:07,334
Bullshit what happened.

457
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:11,074
Makes me wanna puke. But my dad
says puking's for pussies.

458
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:14,575
I puke all the time
and I'm not a pussy.

459
00:34:17,484 --> 00:34:19,952
Listen, me and my associate...

460
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:22,086
...we're on a quest to find King.

461
00:34:22,288 --> 00:34:24,119
You know where his mansion is?

462
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,957
I heard he lives in a castle.
I never seen it, though.

463
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,787
I could probably find it.

464
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:31,860
You can find Jimmy King?

465
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:34,556
I can find anyone on the Net.

466
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:38,528
I'll search the Web for info
on King's whereabouts.

467
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:39,829
Good. Smart.

468
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:41,997
You're the King!

469
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:46,177
- Oh, yeah? I will rule you!
- Dude.

470
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,108
Dude, my dad'll hear you.

471
00:34:48,582 --> 00:34:50,379
Sorry, man. I'll keep it down.

472
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:51,751
Thanks.

473
00:34:53,153 --> 00:34:55,144
Give it to you two times!

474
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:56,815
Sorry.

475
00:34:58,658 --> 00:35:01,684
I found a site. "King, Jimmy.

476
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:04,188
Wife, Eugenia."

477
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,362
Hey, and you're in luck.

478
00:35:08,368 --> 00:35:09,960
Here's the address.

479
00:35:11,638 --> 00:35:13,765
Sir Isaac,
you've served your king well.

480
00:35:14,174 --> 00:35:17,701
My loneliness is killing me

481
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:23,181
I must confess I still believe

482
00:35:28,154 --> 00:35:31,089
Give me a sign

483
00:35:31,892 --> 00:35:34,587
Hit me baby one more time

484
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:40,361
It's not exactly a castle.

485
00:35:52,578 --> 00:35:54,102
Eugenia King?

486
00:35:55,014 --> 00:35:57,141
- Jimmy King's wife?
- Yeah.

487
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,974
The queen.

488
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,347
Front and present.

489
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:06,390
We're looking for the King.
Is he home?

490
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:09,618
What are you, high?
He hasn't been home in two years.

491
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:13,296
All I got to remember him by
is an itchy crotch.

492
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,767
You ever seen crabs up close?

493
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:17,436
You wanna see?

494
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:21,269
- Fantastic.
- Wait, no.

495
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:23,507
I got this.

496
00:36:23,677 --> 00:36:25,167
Ma'am...

497
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:28,409
...could you say who
his associates are?

498
00:36:28,582 --> 00:36:32,018
Yeah. They're all scumbags.
You could try Louise.

499
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:35,277
And Louise is...?

500
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:36,750
A whore. She's a whore.

501
00:36:37,223 --> 00:36:38,986
Good. Whores.

502
00:36:39,192 --> 00:36:42,684
Scumbags and whores. Great.
Thank you. You've been a lot of help.

503
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,055
If you find him...

504
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:48,027
...tell him he owes me child support,
alimony and dental bills.

505
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:53,497
Tell him I hope his diddly turns black
and falls in the crapper.

506
00:36:57,309 --> 00:36:58,776
It's the prince.

507
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:08,786
You looking for my dad?

508
00:37:09,054 --> 00:37:11,522
Yeah. We're on a quest.
Prince Jimmy!

509
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,882
I'm Frankie.

510
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,283
Are you bounty hunters?

511
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:19,189
I'll help you find him
if you split the reward with me.

512
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:21,365
- Know where we can find him?
- No.

513
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:23,662
I haven't seen him for months.

514
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:26,137
Mama says he's gotta pay
for my braces...

515
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:28,898
...otherwise they're gonna
repossess them.

516
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:30,806
Nice.

517
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:35,243
My research shows he has three kids...

518
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:39,144
...two illegitimate, two wives
and has filed for bankruptcy 3 times.

519
00:37:39,351 --> 00:37:42,912
This doesn't make sense!
Jimmy King wouldn't do that stuff!

520
00:37:43,156 --> 00:37:44,714
It's a conspiracy, all right?

521
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:49,394
Sinclair set up King to make him
lose face in front of his own family.

522
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:52,565
And I found his parents.
Maybe they can help.

523
00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:54,597
Kid's wasted his entire life.

524
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:56,765
Wrestling.

525
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:00,461
He could have been a doctor.

526
00:38:01,974 --> 00:38:05,375
Well, an ambulance driver, at least.

527
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:07,943
Jimmy was never very bright.

528
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:09,739
Left school in 10th grade.

529
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:11,539
I beg to differ.

530
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:16,845
According to his authorized biography,
King worked very hard in high school.

531
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:21,388
And after you died in a plane crash,
he went to community college.

532
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:24,221
And he supported you
while he held two jobs.

533
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:28,397
I ought to kick your ass, freak!

534
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:30,898
We saw him last week.

535
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:34,671
He came and "borrowed" our motor home.

536
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:39,310
We haven't seen him since.
The big shit!

537
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:43,742
Yes. Jimmy King received a speeding
ticket, driving a motor home.

538
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:47,145
He gave them an address.
St. Francis Motor Court.

539
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:49,820
- Space 14.
- Get off the phone, you pussy!

540
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:53,616
I gotta go. My dad says yakking
on the phone is for pussies.

541
00:39:14,113 --> 00:39:17,412
Let's go. That's not the King,
just some weird lady.

542
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,709
Oh, my God.

543
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:21,820
That's her.

544
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:25,316
I mean, that's him. That's the King.

545
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:32,159
Are you telling me the King's a queen?

546
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:37,327
There's gotta be an explanation.
But we came all this way.

547
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,237
He needs us.

548
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,903
It's another plot. A "rouge."

549
00:39:45,811 --> 00:39:49,577
- King! Jimmy King?
- Yeah, baby.

550
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:52,244
Jimmy King!

551
00:39:55,988 --> 00:39:58,786
- Who's there? Who's there?
- It's us.

552
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:04,853
The nice boys from the pharmacy.

553
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,191
Leave my husband's medicine on the top
step. I'll tip you next time...

554
00:40:09,434 --> 00:40:13,200
- No, no. No pharmacy.
- We're your most loyal "surgeons."

555
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:15,464
- Why are you doing this?
- It's us!

556
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:18,575
- You're a chick?
- Give me the stuff or I'll crown you!

557
00:40:18,744 --> 00:40:21,406
- It's him!
- It's him! King!

558
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:22,671
Jimmy King!

559
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:25,411
We're your biggest fans.

560
00:40:26,184 --> 00:40:28,345
- You're fans?
- Yeah.

561
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:32,688
I ought to break your geeky necks.

562
00:40:33,658 --> 00:40:36,092
We're on a quest
to restore your throne!

563
00:40:36,294 --> 00:40:38,854
- We believe in you, Jimmy King!
- Piss off!

564
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,830
There's hope.

565
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:46,037
See, he's got some fight left in him.

566
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:49,966
Could we come in? Five minutes
is all we ask of the King.

567
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:51,231
Please?

568
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,510
How much money you got?

569
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:59,176
- Thirty dollars.
- Show it to me.

570
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:07,849
Personal appearance fee.

571
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:10,720
Thirty dollars, five minutes. Enter!

572
00:41:14,032 --> 00:41:15,795
- You were right.
- I told you.

573
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:18,670
Things happen for a reason.

574
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:35,319
It's a conspiracy. We know
this isn't you. You're our king.

575
00:41:35,888 --> 00:41:39,653
This is a disguise. I'm hiding out
from a couple of people.

576
00:41:39,857 --> 00:41:41,950
You're hiding out from Sinclair.

577
00:41:42,894 --> 00:41:45,260
I ain't scared of that circus freak.

578
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,325
You understand me?

579
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:51,092
I made that league and he knows it.
I put the butts in the seats.

580
00:41:51,402 --> 00:41:53,097
- I know.
- He's done exploiting me...

581
00:41:53,337 --> 00:41:58,206
...so he plots a massacre with his
sissies and kicks me out for good.

582
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:00,502
- That's so unjust.
- That sucks.

583
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:04,442
It's not like the rest of my life
been a bowl of cherries either.

584
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:09,519
But I just try and play
the cards that's dealt me.

585
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,580
Keep my chin up.

586
00:42:13,258 --> 00:42:16,785
Even though my wife just left me...

587
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:20,593
...and my little boy's
confined to a wheelchair.

588
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:24,602
And my mommy and daddy just passed.

589
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:28,573
We met your wife.

590
00:42:30,142 --> 00:42:32,372
And she says that you left her.

591
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:35,244
Not how I remember it.

592
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:38,710
And your son's not in a wheelchair.

593
00:42:40,953 --> 00:42:43,148
Your parents aren't dead anymore.

594
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:46,386
Good Lord! I am blessed!

595
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:49,320
Praise Him, in all His mercies!

596
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:52,087
Piss off! Five minutes are up.
Get out!

597
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,162
Wait.

598
00:42:54,432 --> 00:42:55,797
- Get out!
- Wait, wait.

599
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,558
Can we do something for you?

600
00:42:57,802 --> 00:43:01,704
We can go on a beer run, right?
We can go on a beer run for you.

601
00:43:01,906 --> 00:43:03,396
Beer is good. Beer.

602
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:09,444
Get me two sixes.

603
00:43:11,382 --> 00:43:15,546
You try and skip out with my money,
I'm gonna find you...

604
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,514
"I will find you..."

605
00:43:19,924 --> 00:43:21,983
"I will find you" and...?

606
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:26,152
- "I will rule you!"
- Yeah.

607
00:43:26,797 --> 00:43:29,061
Give us a "rule you," please?

608
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,733
- Wait, no.
- Come on!

609
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:32,868
Give us a "begone."

610
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,038
Yeah, please?

611
00:43:35,273 --> 00:43:36,365
How about this:

612
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,873
Go get my damn beer,
you frigging morons!

613
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:45,212
- How are we gonna get back to Lusk?
- What do you mean?

614
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:48,580
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

615
00:43:48,787 --> 00:43:51,688
Drunk Jimmy King in a dress.
We're out of here.

616
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,688
Wait, no, no. Sean, we can't.

617
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:56,986
He needs us now more than ever.

618
00:43:58,597 --> 00:43:59,689
My hope...

619
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:04,629
...is that you two figured out that
I ain't the fella you came to see.

620
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,202
It's been a pleasure sitting with you.

621
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:11,772
Thank you for getting me
two boxes of beer.

622
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:13,705
Shut the door on your way out.

623
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:16,209
I know what's going on here.

624
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:18,608
You need to get back into the ring.

625
00:44:18,816 --> 00:44:20,044
Never happen.

626
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:24,950
Sinclair created and owns
my character. It's over. Cheers.

627
00:44:25,156 --> 00:44:27,681
Sinclair?
So what? You're the King.

628
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:30,357
You can beat anyone.

629
00:44:33,364 --> 00:44:35,594
- Beat anyone?
- Yeah.

630
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,461
Y'all know it's just a show?

631
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,594
Best show in the world.

632
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:42,738
It's like dancing, you know?

633
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,865
- It's a circus show with dancing.
- Right.

634
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,509
- Dancing clowns.
- We got you.

635
00:44:47,678 --> 00:44:48,770
Honk, honk.

636
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,347
A little soap opera thrown in.

637
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:54,848
This clown just got fired, that's all.
No more wrestling.

638
00:44:58,522 --> 00:45:00,422
Listen to me, you dumbshits!

639
00:45:00,591 --> 00:45:03,219
I ain't no king!
There never was no king!

640
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:07,864
The King is a fake creation.
I ain't a has-been. I'm a never-was.

641
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:10,466
You got it, stupid?

642
00:45:10,635 --> 00:45:14,161
Now, get the hell out of my house!
I'm done with you. Get out!

643
00:45:15,573 --> 00:45:16,562
Come on.

644
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:20,142
Get. Get out.

645
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,478
Know what I don't get?

646
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,583
How can you be phony
if we believe in you?

647
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:41,561
We need you, King.
Your fans need you.

648
00:45:42,298 --> 00:45:45,461
We need you to rise above this
and take Sinclair down.

649
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:49,069
I wouldn't mind taking a swing
at that turd bump.

650
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:53,641
That's what we're talking about.
You'll get as many swings as you want.

651
00:45:53,843 --> 00:45:56,243
I'm a little banged up.
I don't know.

652
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:59,778
Oh, please! You fought
with a broken back before.

653
00:45:59,983 --> 00:46:03,976
You were paralyzed, you hopped out
of a wheelchair and whupped Canyon!

654
00:46:05,355 --> 00:46:08,552
Sting broke six bones
in your neck with a bat.

655
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:10,920
In two weeks, you came back and ruled!

656
00:46:11,794 --> 00:46:14,888
- Come on!
- Come on, man! This is nothing!

657
00:46:16,266 --> 00:46:17,665
What's the matter?

658
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:20,694
Come on! This is nothing!

659
00:46:21,538 --> 00:46:23,733
- Let go!
- Show us some of that old King!

660
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,238
- Let go or...
- Or what? Or what?

661
00:46:27,843 --> 00:46:29,868
Or I will rule you!

662
00:46:43,693 --> 00:46:44,591
Crown us!

663
00:46:44,794 --> 00:46:45,818
Crown us, come on!

664
00:46:46,062 --> 00:46:48,553
- Please, crown us!
- Crown us!

665
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:53,124
That was great, man!

666
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:54,893
You happy now?

667
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:06,706
Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey.

668
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:09,541
- Guess what?
- What?

669
00:47:09,852 --> 00:47:13,788
Taking you up on your offer to get
one good swing at Titus Sinclair.

670
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,787
You're gonna pound Sinclair?

671
00:47:16,826 --> 00:47:19,351
Oh, yeah. I'm driving first leg.

672
00:47:58,434 --> 00:48:00,629
Here tonight, in a hard-core match...

673
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,734
...Sid Vicious is gonna
be locking up with Sting.

674
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:08,069
Plus in his very first title offense,
Diamond Dallas Page...

675
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:12,338
...faces none other than the Disco
Inferno. Should be interesting.

676
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:15,875
Out of the way!

677
00:48:16,419 --> 00:48:18,649
- Excuse us!
- Smells like poop in here.

678
00:48:19,022 --> 00:48:20,819
We're almost in position.

679
00:48:21,057 --> 00:48:24,151
When we have access to Sinclair,
Gordie will call.

680
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,596
When you hear that, jump out
and we'll have our meeting.

681
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:36,062
Sit tight, King.

682
00:48:36,306 --> 00:48:39,469
Have you back on that throne
in no time. Come on.

683
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,508
Here, girls.
Here, here, here.

684
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:48,216
Oh, my goodness!

685
00:48:49,852 --> 00:48:51,012
- Look!
- Naked things.

686
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,782
The naked, naked things.

687
00:48:59,594 --> 00:49:02,688
- All the naked things.
- Naked. Naked.

688
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:06,157
Oh, extra-naked.

689
00:49:13,775 --> 00:49:15,174
Excuse me.

690
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,377
Boys.

691
00:49:17,446 --> 00:49:18,538
Can I help you?

692
00:49:18,814 --> 00:49:21,408
No. We were just
checking out your breasts.

693
00:49:23,385 --> 00:49:25,444
We're checking the pipes in the wall.

694
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:28,156
See, they're round and large.

695
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:29,757
Well, thanks.

696
00:49:34,897 --> 00:49:38,765
That was Sasha. Perhaps the
Nitro-est Nitro Girl of them all.

697
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:51,812
Mr. Page? Got 60 seconds.

698
00:49:52,048 --> 00:49:56,508
I want to start tight on the belt,
then reveal us, pulling back.

699
00:49:56,753 --> 00:49:58,243
About time you put it on me.

700
00:49:58,488 --> 00:50:00,456
Anybody's better than Jimmy King.

701
00:50:01,657 --> 00:50:04,182
Ungrateful tub of lard,
that's what he was.

702
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:07,156
I know that. You know that.

703
00:50:07,396 --> 00:50:09,796
I don't get what
these kids dig about him.

704
00:50:10,165 --> 00:50:13,293
Let me tell you about these kids.
They're morons.

705
00:50:13,535 --> 00:50:15,400
They love who I tell them to.

706
00:50:15,604 --> 00:50:20,166
"I'm Jimmy King! I will rule you!

707
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:22,502
I will reign supreme!

708
00:50:23,211 --> 00:50:26,339
As soon as I finish
these here beers."

709
00:50:26,882 --> 00:50:27,849
Funny?

710
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:29,515
Let's roll. We'll do it.

711
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:32,845
Five. Four. Three. Two.

712
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:37,252
Page, what do you really feel
about Jimmy King?

713
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,016
Yo, snapper-head, up here!

714
00:50:39,594 --> 00:50:43,052
Jimmy King, he doesn't know
a wristlock from a wristwatch.

715
00:50:43,265 --> 00:50:45,460
As far as being
in shape is concerned...

716
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,602
...that boy was so out of shape,
in the ring it was like fighting...

717
00:50:49,871 --> 00:50:52,431
...a harpooned whale.

718
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:54,632
That's sweet, man. What a bum.

719
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:56,208
Jimmy King is not a...

720
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,207
I ain't no damn bum!

721
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,953
King's not in the script!

722
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:25,197
Foreign object!

723
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,544
Fatty just made you
his shithouse bitch!

724
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:41,520
Who are you guys?

725
00:51:41,756 --> 00:51:43,690
- We're fans!
- Jimmy King's, asshole!

726
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:45,984
Get them off of me!

727
00:51:59,608 --> 00:52:00,575
King!

728
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,375
Is that all you got?

729
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:17,421
- Do your job!
- You went down!

730
00:52:17,893 --> 00:52:20,623
One. Two. Three.

731
00:52:20,897 --> 00:52:23,263
The winner by pinfall, Jimmy King!

732
00:52:23,733 --> 00:52:25,223
We have a new champion!

733
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:27,402
Jimmy King rules!

734
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:31,563
No!

735
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:33,740
That was unsanctioned!

736
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:38,139
And per the bylaws of the WCW,
that belt cannot be passed.

737
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,373
- You give me what's mine, you freak!
- You can't ambush your opponent.

738
00:52:42,584 --> 00:52:45,417
- Any match, anytime, baby!
- You heard him.

739
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,679
Any match, anytime!

740
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,686
You want a match, you got one match.

741
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,223
- One match, you name it!
- The steel cage.

742
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,759
Steel cage? Done! When?

743
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:58,898
- He doesn't even have to win.
- He's not gonna win.

744
00:52:59,768 --> 00:53:02,931
- No, he's gonna win.
- All you have to do is survive.

745
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:07,540
You survive and you get this belt.

746
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,137
Plus $1 million!

747
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,469
But if he loses...

748
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:16,739
...you forfeit your crown
and never be able to wrestle again.

749
00:53:17,018 --> 00:53:19,145
- It's a deal!
- You got a match, baby!

750
00:53:19,387 --> 00:53:21,912
Hold on, baby. Hold the damn phones.

751
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:24,855
Ladies and gentlemen,
you heard it here.

752
00:53:25,093 --> 00:53:29,553
A new first. Four weeks from tonight,
MGM Grand, pay-per-view.

753
00:53:30,265 --> 00:53:33,666
- Be there!
- We're gonna reign supreme!

754
00:53:33,935 --> 00:53:37,871
- Good, save it! Save that emotion!
- Save it!

755
00:53:38,106 --> 00:53:40,074
Tonight we rejoice! We rejoice!

756
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:43,038
- With the King in his motor castle!
- Party!

757
00:53:56,391 --> 00:53:57,449
Sasha.

758
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:58,993
Oh, my God.

759
00:54:02,897 --> 00:54:03,829
I'm Gordie.

760
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:06,457
I saw you in that brawl tonight.

761
00:54:07,235 --> 00:54:08,896
Pretty awesome.

762
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:13,601
Got a beer?

763
00:54:15,844 --> 00:54:17,812
- Dick!
- Thanks.

764
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:22,013
I got your poster up in my room.

765
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,217
Really?

766
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:24,648
Which one?

767
00:54:24,919 --> 00:54:25,977
Is it...

768
00:54:27,255 --> 00:54:29,246
...this one? Or wait.

769
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,993
- That one?
- No, it's this one.

770
00:54:37,632 --> 00:54:39,862
- That's my favorite.
- Me too!

771
00:54:41,703 --> 00:54:43,330
You're really sweet.

772
00:54:45,507 --> 00:54:46,872
And masculine.

773
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:49,702
I really like how
you stood up to Sinclair.

774
00:54:49,978 --> 00:54:52,503
We did it for that guy right there.

775
00:54:54,182 --> 00:54:55,409
Isn't he the best?

776
00:54:55,616 --> 00:54:57,880
He's the best. There's no better.

777
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,884
Growing up in Cody, Wyoming,
I lived to watch Jimmy King fight.

778
00:55:04,158 --> 00:55:06,217
You're from Cody? No way!

779
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,224
- I'm from Lusk!
- Really?

780
00:55:09,463 --> 00:55:10,452
Oh, my God!

781
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:13,366
You wanna dance?

782
00:55:35,657 --> 00:55:37,818
Do people think I'm sexy?

783
00:55:38,493 --> 00:55:41,792
I think you're sexy, Gene.
Really I do.

784
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,600
But right now, I'm gonna train
for this freaking death match, baby.

785
00:55:50,105 --> 00:55:53,939
A little pure protein,
send me on my way.

786
00:56:05,186 --> 00:56:07,245
No goddamn way, baby!

787
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:24,316
Oh, my God.

788
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:27,982
How'd you know
where to find him?

789
00:56:28,857 --> 00:56:30,518
We're in the business.

790
00:56:30,894 --> 00:56:34,091
Found him in drainage tunnel 14.
He didn't want to leave.

791
00:56:34,566 --> 00:56:36,329
We'll take care of him from here.

792
00:56:36,569 --> 00:56:37,763
Good luck.

793
00:56:39,207 --> 00:56:40,504
Do your magic.

794
00:56:42,512 --> 00:56:44,980
You cannot run away.

795
00:56:45,217 --> 00:56:47,481
You got a fight,
major responsibilities.

796
00:56:47,755 --> 00:56:49,120
I got news for you.

797
00:56:49,324 --> 00:56:52,157
I sucker-punched Page last night.
It was a fluke!

798
00:56:52,362 --> 00:56:54,057
How can you say that?

799
00:56:54,499 --> 00:56:56,057
We got you this far!

800
00:56:57,237 --> 00:56:59,330
We're gonna get you a trainer.

801
00:56:59,774 --> 00:57:01,139
Trainer?

802
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,903
I don't need a trainer.
I need a safe house, baby.

803
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:08,312
Or a new identity from the FBI.
Or a fast car.

804
00:57:08,988 --> 00:57:13,288
Jimmy King is not scared.
Jimmy King does not back down.

805
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:14,791
Don't you get it?

806
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,489
Sinclair wants to kill me.
End my life.

807
00:57:18,804 --> 00:57:23,706
So I'm dead and buried in the ground.
Little tiny bugs feasting on my ass.

808
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:26,242
No bugs are gonna feast on your ass!

809
00:57:26,482 --> 00:57:30,248
You'll win the money and get
your belt back. That's our mission.

810
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,086
I'm scared, baby. I'm scared.

811
00:57:33,593 --> 00:57:36,562
We can help. Sean, sing the song.

812
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:38,125
I don't want to sing.

813
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:41,701
Sing the song for Mr. King! Come on.

814
00:57:45,112 --> 00:57:48,275
Jimmy King is the best wrestler

815
00:57:48,517 --> 00:57:50,178
He's the best-ler

816
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,947
Better than all the rest-ler

817
00:57:53,191 --> 00:57:54,920
- He's got class
- He's really fast

818
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:58,562
- He'll rule ass
- He'll rule that ass

819
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:03,432
Jimmy, Jimmy King

820
00:58:03,675 --> 00:58:05,939
- It's not done.
- We're still working on it.

821
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:12,250
Where are you taking me?

822
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:14,754
It's a surprise. Don't worry.

823
00:58:22,038 --> 00:58:23,471
Hello?

824
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,504
What the hell is that, baby?

825
00:58:38,664 --> 00:58:41,633
I got three words for you, baby,
9-1-1.

826
00:58:47,144 --> 00:58:48,168
Stifle!

827
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:02,598
Sal Bandini.

828
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:04,325
Wanna wrestle?

829
00:59:04,571 --> 00:59:05,367
Sal Bandini?

830
00:59:06,741 --> 00:59:07,935
This is an honor...

831
00:59:13,552 --> 00:59:14,576
Tap out, son.

832
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,385
This is who you called about?

833
00:59:20,964 --> 00:59:21,896
I've seen you.

834
00:59:22,634 --> 00:59:25,762
You're big, tough. You don't
know shit about wrestling.

835
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:29,475
Always worried, what,
about TV time and endorsements?

836
00:59:29,712 --> 00:59:31,646
- Well...
- Stifle. You talk too much.

837
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:34,316
Mr. Bandini, he's ready
to listen and learn.

838
00:59:34,553 --> 00:59:38,683
Good. I'm just finishing up with
the local high school wrestling team.

839
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:42,661
All right, whackers, go home.

840
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,367
You did real good today.

841
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,764
But remember what I told you.

842
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,440
Apply pressure until
you hear cartilage snap...

843
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:53,442
...or they crap in their pants.
Come on, wuss, move it!

844
00:59:53,683 --> 00:59:56,049
And you, work on that for tomorrow!

845
00:59:56,488 --> 00:59:59,821
Gentlemen, step into my office.

846
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:02,458
Just take it easy.

847
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:04,394
Come on, Jimmy.

848
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:06,464
Show me one of your fancy moves.

849
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:10,842
Come on, King.

850
01:00:14,182 --> 01:00:16,776
- That's not good.
- Come on. It's embarrassing.

851
01:00:19,257 --> 01:00:21,919
Tap out, punk.
I seen you favor that leg.

852
01:00:22,195 --> 01:00:24,629
Lesson one:
Never reveal your weaknesses.

853
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,428
Bite me, old man.

854
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:27,692
Right spirit.

855
01:00:27,937 --> 01:00:29,996
Wrong old man to be messing with.

856
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:31,242
Tap out.

857
01:00:39,858 --> 01:00:41,917
You kicked him in the face, King.

858
01:00:42,196 --> 01:00:44,391
The crazy old bastard was
gonna kill me.

859
01:00:44,632 --> 01:00:45,963
I think you killed him.

860
01:00:46,235 --> 01:00:47,202
What?

861
01:00:47,537 --> 01:00:49,596
How hard did you hit him?
He's an old man!

862
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:51,332
Only gave him a little flick.

863
01:00:51,544 --> 01:00:53,944
No, you kicked him in the face.

864
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,184
Sal, you all right?
You all right, baby?

865
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:07,726
You know, kicking me was right.

866
01:01:07,972 --> 01:01:09,735
Seeing if I was okay is wrong.

867
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:15,344
Lesson one: The possum ain't dead
till it's scraped off the road.

868
01:01:15,552 --> 01:01:17,144
It's treachery.

869
01:01:17,623 --> 01:01:19,386
Did you have to squash
the possum's nuts?

870
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:20,650
Stifle.

871
01:01:26,371 --> 01:01:28,339
Buenos nachos, seorita.

872
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:31,108
I didn't know you spoke Spanish.

873
01:01:31,512 --> 01:01:33,207
Yeah, I took it in high school.

874
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:34,576
A bunch of times.

875
01:01:35,986 --> 01:01:37,385
Are you fluent?

876
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:40,581
No. I feel fine.

877
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:44,727
Got something for you.

878
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:48,872
Thanks.

879
01:01:49,442 --> 01:01:53,139
Flower guy was closed,
so I picked those up for you.

880
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,417
Great.

881
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:56,311
Come on in.

882
01:01:58,224 --> 01:02:00,488
Candles and food and everything.

883
01:02:00,729 --> 01:02:02,390
Yeah. I figured, why go out?

884
01:02:03,334 --> 01:02:04,767
We can stay in.

885
01:02:13,383 --> 01:02:15,510
So how's training going?

886
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:17,481
Pretty good.

887
01:02:18,459 --> 01:02:21,951
Got him a coach, he's starting
to listen. Things are looking up.

888
01:02:22,498 --> 01:02:24,398
A coach? Really?

889
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:25,863
Do I know him?

890
01:02:27,941 --> 01:02:29,568
Sal Bandini. You heard of him?

891
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:33,010
No, I don't think I know him.

892
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:34,806
He's old school.

893
01:02:35,721 --> 01:02:36,915
Yeah, he's a real pro.

894
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:39,622
Kind of been training alongside him...

895
01:02:39,862 --> 01:02:43,320
...so picking up some really,
really awesome moves.

896
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,961
Awesome moves, huh?

897
01:02:48,476 --> 01:02:51,070
I'd love you to show me
your awesome moves.

898
01:02:56,123 --> 01:02:57,784
Show me what you got, big boy.

899
01:02:58,794 --> 01:03:01,194
Well, I got some moves for you.

900
01:03:04,738 --> 01:03:05,705
Are you sure?

901
01:03:06,641 --> 01:03:08,108
I'm sure.

902
01:03:14,755 --> 01:03:15,813
That was a snap-mare.

903
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,260
Take me to the bedroom.

904
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:25,496
I meant, why don't we wrestle in here?

905
01:03:25,738 --> 01:03:27,205
Bedroom match.

906
01:03:27,777 --> 01:03:29,836
I'd love to wrestle you in here.

907
01:03:31,048 --> 01:03:32,515
Give it to me, big boy.

908
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,061
I will now unveil my...

909
01:03:44,303 --> 01:03:46,168
...secret weapons.

910
01:03:48,512 --> 01:03:49,877
Foreign objects!

911
01:03:53,854 --> 01:03:55,321
Oh, God!

912
01:03:58,962 --> 01:04:01,328
Dear Dad: I am fine.

913
01:04:01,566 --> 01:04:06,469
Sean and I are helping Jimmy King
reclaim his lost glory.

914
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:10,638
King's a good man who just
seems to have lost his way.

915
01:04:10,883 --> 01:04:13,647
Also, Dad, I met this
really, really sweet girl.

916
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:16,187
And I'm not a virgin anymore.

917
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:19,828
Sorry about missing
the state trooper's exam.

918
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:23,831
I'm sure there's another one coming up
that you can force me to take.

919
01:04:32,921 --> 01:04:35,253
Respectfully, Gordon.

920
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:39,551
Sweetie, I don't think King needs
any other wrestlers.

921
01:04:39,799 --> 01:04:42,529
- I think it's a bad idea.
- You think so, boopie?

922
01:04:43,238 --> 01:04:44,705
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

923
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,340
Boopie thinks it's a bad idea.
We shouldn't do it.

924
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,241
I think that boopie
should keep her mouth shut.

925
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,643
- Don't talk to boopie like that.
- I'm telling you...

926
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:55,720
...I have a terrible vibe
about this whole thing.

927
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,623
Listen. You need a posse of guys
who are gonna support you.

928
01:05:01,002 --> 01:05:03,095
There he is. Come on.

929
01:05:07,045 --> 01:05:09,946
Oh, hey, Big Bill!
Goldberg, what are you doing?

930
01:05:10,183 --> 01:05:12,879
I didn't know you were in town.
You're looking good.

931
01:05:13,123 --> 01:05:15,489
What's going on? Why are you here?

932
01:05:15,726 --> 01:05:17,353
I'm doing Letterman.

933
01:05:17,596 --> 01:05:20,622
What are you doing here?
Preparing for your execution?

934
01:05:22,938 --> 01:05:24,929
- You think I have no chance?
- Get real.

935
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:28,508
Sinclair's pissed off,
and he'll make an example out of you.

936
01:05:28,747 --> 01:05:31,978
Face it. You're a second-rate
wrestler and a third-rate man.

937
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,848
You're still sore about
that spot I blew in Akron.

938
01:05:35,459 --> 01:05:36,448
You were drunk.

939
01:05:36,695 --> 01:05:39,687
I'm sorry. I was having
terrible back spasms that day.

940
01:05:39,933 --> 01:05:40,957
You puked on me.

941
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:42,930
The audience liked it.

942
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,161
I was your partner!

943
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:49,374
I made you. If it wasn't for me,
you'd be nothing.

944
01:05:49,547 --> 01:05:50,536
Yeah?

945
01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:53,407
Damn.

946
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:56,855
Mr. Goldberg, that was a nice throw.
How you doing?

947
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,994
We represent Mr. King
in his upcoming pay-per-view.

948
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:03,166
You are the mack. You are it, man!

949
01:06:03,403 --> 01:06:05,303
His majesty needs you in the corner.

950
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:08,440
Look, I used to look up to Jimmy
just like you two.

951
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:11,743
But the fact is, he let me down.

952
01:06:11,983 --> 01:06:14,645
I know. I know. King lost his way.

953
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,219
But he has seen the light.
He's a changed man.

954
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:18,823
The change is coming!

955
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:20,790
Please, for a second...?

956
01:06:21,464 --> 01:06:24,092
Whatever's happened in the past
is the past.

957
01:06:24,336 --> 01:06:26,566
But ultimately,
he's your friend, right?

958
01:06:26,806 --> 01:06:30,572
And you can't turn your back
on a friend. Right?

959
01:06:31,013 --> 01:06:34,505
Sorry, guys.
The fact is, I work alone.

960
01:07:17,186 --> 01:07:18,016
That's him.

961
01:07:32,444 --> 01:07:34,105
Sal Bandini. Want to wrestle?

962
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,698
Who's your daddy, bitch?

963
01:07:53,244 --> 01:07:54,211
Who sent you?

964
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,140
Sinclair.

965
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:59,381
He wants you to stay away from King.

966
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:02,418
You tell your boss
I'll train whoever I want.

967
01:08:13,643 --> 01:08:15,667
I'm so sorry, Gordie.

968
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:18,147
It's not your fault, Sasha.

969
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:20,043
Poor Sal.

970
01:08:21,788 --> 01:08:23,653
Mr. Bandini's a tough old man.

971
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:27,492
But he'll have to stay here a while.
He's got multiple injuries.

972
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:30,660
Any questions?

973
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:32,269
- Can we see him?
- Sure.

974
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,170
I'm gonna get him a Butterfinger.

975
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:37,674
I have to use the little girls' room.

976
01:08:44,192 --> 01:08:46,057
Can I have a Butterfinger too?

977
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:51,468
It's over.

978
01:08:51,703 --> 01:08:52,692
It's done.

979
01:08:52,972 --> 01:08:54,803
Now can I please get out of here?

980
01:08:55,342 --> 01:08:57,503
Sasha, take it easy.
You did good.

981
01:08:57,847 --> 01:09:00,680
Titus, I'm wasting my time
at the hospital.

982
01:09:00,952 --> 01:09:03,819
Poor guy should be in the morgue
after what you guys did.

983
01:09:05,325 --> 01:09:06,553
Who do you wuv?

984
01:09:07,595 --> 01:09:09,392
I wuv you.

985
01:09:11,468 --> 01:09:14,096
Now, please, just get me out of here.

986
01:09:14,339 --> 01:09:17,206
Bandini guy's like
100 years old, anyway.

987
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:18,570
105.

988
01:09:19,347 --> 01:09:22,475
But tell that to
Saturn and Sid Vicious over here.

989
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:23,981
Morons.

990
01:09:25,657 --> 01:09:27,021
You did great.

991
01:09:27,259 --> 01:09:31,195
So how does head Nitro Girl sound?

992
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:33,560
My balls are in my throat...

993
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:37,128
...my prostate is the size
of a melon...

994
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:40,102
...and I'm crapping tapioca.

995
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,910
I feel like a kid again.

996
01:09:45,321 --> 01:09:47,687
Don't worry about me.
Sit down. Sit down.

997
01:09:51,631 --> 01:09:52,427
Listen to me.

998
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:54,827
And this is the final lesson.

999
01:09:56,406 --> 01:09:58,636
Always attack a man's strengths.

1000
01:09:59,344 --> 01:10:01,107
I think he means weaknesses.

1001
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,047
No, I mean strengths.

1002
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:07,515
No one ever expects you to attack
the strongest part of the fort.

1003
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:09,422
Up the middle.

1004
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,628
That's where the action is.

1005
01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:13,530
And it's the same in life.

1006
01:10:14,568 --> 01:10:16,661
Look, I know you got demons.

1007
01:10:17,173 --> 01:10:18,504
But don't run away.

1008
01:10:18,742 --> 01:10:22,303
Attack them head on as
they're coming to you full speed.

1009
01:10:22,548 --> 01:10:24,675
Because that, my friend...

1010
01:10:24,885 --> 01:10:26,682
...is living.

1011
01:10:30,728 --> 01:10:32,753
Got something for you, Sal.

1012
01:10:33,365 --> 01:10:34,491
My favorite!

1013
01:10:35,234 --> 01:10:37,998
- Thank you.
- Can we do anything for you?

1014
01:10:38,473 --> 01:10:40,201
Get out of town.

1015
01:10:40,843 --> 01:10:43,334
This place is no good for a wrestler.

1016
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,138
Get back to basics.

1017
01:10:45,751 --> 01:10:47,184
I know a place we can do that.

1018
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:52,626
Oh, man!

1019
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:54,887
This town turned my head around.

1020
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:57,833
Forgot our mission,
what was important.

1021
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:02,163
You know what? I'll do what it takes
from here on out to get the job done.

1022
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,674
Yes, you are. And I am too.

1023
01:11:06,617 --> 01:11:08,380
We're gonna get you that belt back.

1024
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,383
Man, I don't know, baby.

1025
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:11,757
What?

1026
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:13,259
What?

1027
01:11:14,262 --> 01:11:16,389
What's the matter?
What did Sal just say?

1028
01:11:16,633 --> 01:11:18,464
It's about what's in here!

1029
01:11:20,305 --> 01:11:21,431
Dude...

1030
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,904
...you just crushed
my Butterfinger, baby.

1031
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,171
Butterfinger?!

1032
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,317
Get in the van now, okay?

1033
01:11:29,554 --> 01:11:30,680
Sorry.

1034
01:11:31,825 --> 01:11:34,350
Sorry, I had to make a call.

1035
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:36,093
How's Sal?

1036
01:11:36,331 --> 01:11:38,424
- He's gonna make it.
- Oh, good.

1037
01:11:41,473 --> 01:11:43,634
That's more than I can say for us.

1038
01:11:44,344 --> 01:11:45,470
What's going on?

1039
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,877
We're going back to basics.

1040
01:11:48,117 --> 01:11:49,414
To find our heart.

1041
01:11:49,786 --> 01:11:50,775
Well, can I come?

1042
01:11:51,522 --> 01:11:54,081
No. Because you don't have one.

1043
01:12:21,569 --> 01:12:23,799
I can't believe I met Goldberg.

1044
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:26,400
That's cool, you know?

1045
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:33,610
I know you don't wanna talk
about your fallout...

1046
01:12:33,822 --> 01:12:35,187
You're right. I don't.

1047
01:12:35,424 --> 01:12:38,291
- Look, I just...
- Mind your own business, all right?

1048
01:12:43,037 --> 01:12:44,129
Where we going, King?

1049
01:12:44,406 --> 01:12:46,340
There's something I gotta do.

1050
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:54,344
Hello, Eugenia.

1051
01:12:55,057 --> 01:12:56,081
Jimmy King.

1052
01:12:59,364 --> 01:13:01,355
You are a bastard!

1053
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:05,699
Let me help you up.

1054
01:13:07,242 --> 01:13:08,607
I guess I deserved that.

1055
01:13:10,447 --> 01:13:12,745
I just had to kick you
in the diddly again.

1056
01:13:15,922 --> 01:13:16,889
Jesus!

1057
01:13:17,091 --> 01:13:19,389
Oh, the humanity. Make it stop.

1058
01:13:23,068 --> 01:13:24,501
How's your diddly?

1059
01:13:25,271 --> 01:13:26,704
Hope I broke it.

1060
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:28,841
It's definitely bruised.

1061
01:13:29,477 --> 01:13:32,002
What the hell you thinking,
coming back here?

1062
01:13:32,515 --> 01:13:33,641
I'm not exactly sure.

1063
01:13:33,851 --> 01:13:36,285
I think that the King
is ready to be a man.

1064
01:13:36,923 --> 01:13:38,823
Well, how does it feel?

1065
01:13:39,593 --> 01:13:43,120
Like Richard Petty ran a stock car
into my balls...

1066
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,368
...going 400 miles an hour.

1067
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:50,304
Well, look what the rat puked up.

1068
01:13:50,544 --> 01:13:51,841
Oh, Jesus.

1069
01:13:53,215 --> 01:13:55,775
You mean "cat," son, don't you?

1070
01:13:55,986 --> 01:13:57,647
I ain't your son.

1071
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:00,216
Frankie...

1072
01:14:01,461 --> 01:14:03,019
...I came to say I was sorry.

1073
01:14:03,665 --> 01:14:04,927
Too late!

1074
01:14:05,335 --> 01:14:07,530
Jesus, look at that grill!

1075
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:12,999
I mean, no, son. How you doing?
It's good to see...

1076
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,715
Eugenia, please.

1077
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,854
I'm sorry that I took off on you...

1078
01:14:21,093 --> 01:14:23,357
...when I should've been
taking care of you.

1079
01:14:24,098 --> 01:14:25,861
Really. I'm really sorry.

1080
01:14:27,303 --> 01:14:29,794
You can fry ice in hell, you bastard!

1081
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:33,943
What's the good in saying you're sorry?
What are you gonna do about it?

1082
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:35,045
What am I gonna do?

1083
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:41,186
Well, I'm gonna get that belt back.

1084
01:14:41,392 --> 01:14:42,984
I'm gonna win $1 million.

1085
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:47,062
I'm gonna pay off all my debts.
I'm gonna do the right thing by you.

1086
01:14:47,367 --> 01:14:48,925
That's what I'm gonna do.

1087
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:55,577
And by God, I'm gonna get that boy
a damn good dentist.

1088
01:15:09,269 --> 01:15:10,258
Yo, Sean!

1089
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,431
Wyoming! We're home, baby.

1090
01:15:15,112 --> 01:15:17,012
We're home, baby. Wyoming.

1091
01:15:24,308 --> 01:15:25,935
No place like home.

1092
01:15:27,493 --> 01:15:29,222
I can breathe out here.

1093
01:15:40,794 --> 01:15:43,024
Approach the vehicle, son.

1094
01:15:44,112 --> 01:15:45,306
Hi, Dad.

1095
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,447
No back talk.

1096
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,257
No excuses.

1097
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:50,374
Just get in the car.

1098
01:15:56,824 --> 01:15:58,985
- What'd he do?
- Nothing.

1099
01:16:04,799 --> 01:16:06,790
You're gonna be a cop, little mister.

1100
01:16:07,035 --> 01:16:10,994
No skimpy outfits,
no touching other men.

1101
01:16:11,672 --> 01:16:14,937
But I'm destined for other things.
I'm following my dream.

1102
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:16,667
Well, your dream is stupid!

1103
01:16:16,944 --> 01:16:21,404
Just because it's your dream doesn't
make it right or noble or whatever.

1104
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,982
Charlie Manson was
following his dream.

1105
01:16:24,186 --> 01:16:27,246
Joe Stalin, Michael Bolton...
You get my point?

1106
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:50,673
That's a 211, breaking and entering.

1107
01:16:52,313 --> 01:16:55,009
Gordie, come on.
We need you, brother. Let's go.

1108
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:59,281
Gordie, we need you, baby.
I need you.

1109
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:01,651
I need you in my corner, man.

1110
01:17:01,849 --> 01:17:04,147
I need you to help me pick my posse.

1111
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:07,134
I don't know if I can do this
without you.

1112
01:17:08,369 --> 01:17:09,927
- Really?
- Yeah.

1113
01:17:10,164 --> 01:17:11,131
You do?

1114
01:17:11,636 --> 01:17:14,969
I need you to help us go down to Vegas
and rule ass! Let's go!

1115
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:16,614
Let's begone!

1116
01:17:21,671 --> 01:17:22,695
I can't.

1117
01:17:23,712 --> 01:17:26,374
I gotta study for this cop exam.

1118
01:17:26,612 --> 01:17:27,579
My dad...

1119
01:17:32,845 --> 01:17:35,507
It's your dream.
It's your dream. Come on.

1120
01:17:40,248 --> 01:17:41,340
My dream's stupid.

1121
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:48,208
Time for me to get rid of
all this junk.

1122
01:17:48,881 --> 01:17:52,942
You know, get rid of all my childish
things. Time for me to grow up.

1123
01:17:58,249 --> 01:18:00,217
We've come all this way.

1124
01:18:02,116 --> 01:18:03,743
Why are you giving up on me now?

1125
01:18:06,554 --> 01:18:07,714
I'm sorry.

1126
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,382
I can't.

1127
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:16,261
You guys better get out of here.

1128
01:18:16,764 --> 01:18:18,425
My dad'll shoot you.

1129
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:19,792
He will.

1130
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,087
Next, please.

1131
01:18:43,725 --> 01:18:46,216
Hell, everybody knows
wrestling's fake.

1132
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:54,191
That feel fake?

1133
01:19:01,698 --> 01:19:05,065
We are Satan's Siamese twins!

1134
01:19:06,014 --> 01:19:08,504
You guys aren't really
Siamese twins, are you?

1135
01:19:10,885 --> 01:19:11,852
Sorry.

1136
01:19:18,226 --> 01:19:22,629
Oklahoma, where the wind goes
Sweeping down the plains

1137
01:19:22,848 --> 01:19:26,306
Where the waving wheat
Sure smells sweet

1138
01:19:28,136 --> 01:19:30,502
Aren't these the auditions
for Oklahoma?

1139
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:34,039
Oklahoma, okay

1140
01:19:32,908 --> 01:19:34,432
Okay, Dawkins, who's left?

1141
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,699
First, Fireman Fred.

1142
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,701
I'm Fireman Fred,
and I'm gonna hose you!

1143
01:19:42,623 --> 01:19:44,887
Those are good, right?

1144
01:19:45,153 --> 01:19:46,848
Next, this is The Chewer.

1145
01:19:54,162 --> 01:19:56,426
Come on. Last, but not least...

1146
01:19:56,913 --> 01:19:58,346
...this is Kitty.

1147
01:19:59,835 --> 01:20:04,033
Hi, darling, I'm afraid we need to
take people who can help us in Vegas.

1148
01:20:07,475 --> 01:20:10,603
My friends, they call me Pretty Kitty.

1149
01:20:13,282 --> 01:20:15,250
What's she gonna do,
boob them to death?

1150
01:20:17,686 --> 01:20:19,244
How you feeling, big guy?

1151
01:20:20,588 --> 01:20:22,385
- I feel pretty good.
- Good.

1152
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,353
Haven't felt this good in a long time.

1153
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:26,253
Good. Keep it up.

1154
01:20:26,961 --> 01:20:28,826
You ready for Vegas tomorrow?

1155
01:20:29,063 --> 01:20:30,087
Yeah.

1156
01:20:31,265 --> 01:20:32,755
I wish Gordie was coming.

1157
01:20:32,967 --> 01:20:34,229
Me too.

1158
01:20:42,977 --> 01:20:44,103
Thank you.

1159
01:20:45,346 --> 01:20:46,404
Thank you.

1160
01:20:49,784 --> 01:20:50,751
Thank you very much.

1161
01:20:54,155 --> 01:20:56,487
See you, now. Bye-bye.

1162
01:20:57,626 --> 01:20:59,457
Hey, Sean.

1163
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:02,061
I saw you on TNT.
What was New York like?

1164
01:21:02,264 --> 01:21:03,925
It was good. It was fun.

1165
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:07,693
You know, but I'm not much
of a big-city fella.

1166
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:10,638
My heart's right here in Lusk.

1167
01:21:10,872 --> 01:21:12,271
I'll see you, okay?

1168
01:21:18,013 --> 01:21:19,241
Excuse me.

1169
01:21:20,182 --> 01:21:21,308
Hi, Wendy.

1170
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:25,679
I couldn't stop thinking about
how you were always nice to me.

1171
01:21:26,121 --> 01:21:30,524
And I was thinking I should've been a
lot nicer back. I got you something.

1172
01:21:32,295 --> 01:21:34,159
Thank you, Sean.

1173
01:21:36,832 --> 01:21:37,799
Like it?

1174
01:21:38,033 --> 01:21:41,093
It's the greatest.

1175
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:43,705
I have a gift for you too.

1176
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:46,369
Come here.

1177
01:22:08,598 --> 01:22:11,226
Really wish I could go with you,
but I can't.

1178
01:22:12,168 --> 01:22:13,294
I'm sorry.

1179
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:15,601
I feel like I let you down.

1180
01:22:15,938 --> 01:22:18,406
I understand. Really, I do.

1181
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:20,441
And I want to tell you something.

1182
01:22:20,678 --> 01:22:22,578
No matter what happens in Vegas...

1183
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:25,578
...I can't thank you enough
for what you did for me.

1184
01:22:26,683 --> 01:22:27,877
All right?

1185
01:22:29,554 --> 01:22:31,112
Good luck to you, now.

1186
01:22:35,592 --> 01:22:36,889
You take care of yourself.

1187
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:07,751
Wait! Stop the car!

1188
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:12,629
Good luck, King!

1189
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:14,831
- You all right?
- Totally.

1190
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:17,695
- I just want to say good luck.
- Thank you.

1191
01:23:17,903 --> 01:23:20,167
- I'll see you at the restaurant.
- Definitely.

1192
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:25,634
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1193
01:23:25,844 --> 01:23:28,506
I'll totally be thinking of you. Bye!

1194
01:24:11,524 --> 01:24:13,992
Listen to me very carefully.

1195
01:24:16,195 --> 01:24:19,722
If you plan to have
any future at all...

1196
01:24:19,933 --> 01:24:21,628
...in my business...

1197
01:24:23,136 --> 01:24:25,866
...you will not allow Jimmy King...

1198
01:24:26,573 --> 01:24:28,507
...to reach that belt.

1199
01:24:30,143 --> 01:24:31,132
What?

1200
01:24:31,311 --> 01:24:33,370
Excuse me, Mr. Sinclair?
They're ready.

1201
01:24:33,613 --> 01:24:35,012
Thank you.

1202
01:24:40,221 --> 01:24:42,815
I will kill you if you fuck this up.

1203
01:25:03,545 --> 01:25:04,705
Looking good, baby.

1204
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,805
Thank you. You're looking good.

1205
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:09,778
Am I?

1206
01:25:10,385 --> 01:25:11,817
Are you ready?

1207
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,418
Hell, yeah.

1208
01:25:23,164 --> 01:25:25,257
Ladies and gentlemen...

1209
01:25:25,433 --> 01:25:29,802
- Why did you drag me here?
- Because he sent the tickets.

1210
01:25:30,004 --> 01:25:33,440
And welcome to One-Man Suicide!

1211
01:25:34,141 --> 01:25:37,702
Tonight the WCW belt...

1212
01:25:37,912 --> 01:25:39,675
...is on the line!

1213
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:45,643
One million dollars is on the line!

1214
01:25:47,089 --> 01:25:49,580
And one man's life...

1215
01:25:50,225 --> 01:25:53,388
...is on the line!

1216
01:25:58,167 --> 01:25:59,464
Jimmy King!

1217
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:02,135
You want the belt?

1218
01:26:02,772 --> 01:26:05,138
Come on down and get it!

1219
01:26:06,977 --> 01:26:11,277
It's on top of the cage of death.

1220
01:26:12,048 --> 01:26:14,539
Which is on top of another cage.

1221
01:26:14,752 --> 01:26:19,314
Which is yet on top of another cage!

1222
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:24,724
Three cages...

1223
01:26:25,796 --> 01:26:27,491
...two warriors...

1224
01:26:28,499 --> 01:26:30,057
...one belt.

1225
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:32,166
Triple cage.

1226
01:26:32,636 --> 01:26:35,161
Come on down.

1227
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:41,642
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time...

1228
01:26:42,045 --> 01:26:46,448
...for the WCW Royal Bash main event...

1229
01:26:46,984 --> 01:26:51,421
...for the Heavyweight Championship
of the World!

1230
01:26:54,258 --> 01:26:57,227
Coming to the ring first,
from Marietta, Georgia...

1231
01:26:57,394 --> 01:27:00,090
Okay, baby, triple cage.

1232
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:03,857
You watch my back.
Keep that posse on standby.

1233
01:27:04,602 --> 01:27:07,264
Jimmy King!

1234
01:27:10,241 --> 01:27:11,936
Watch out for the pyro!

1235
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:13,836
What was that?

1236
01:27:16,547 --> 01:27:18,538
What was that last thing?

1237
01:27:19,751 --> 01:27:21,844
Oh, my God, I'm on fire! I'm melting!

1238
01:27:22,053 --> 01:27:25,113
I'm melting!
Sweet Jesus, I'm melting!

1239
01:27:26,558 --> 01:27:29,356
I said, "Watch out for the pyro."

1240
01:27:29,694 --> 01:27:32,424
And now, making his entrance
to the ring...

1241
01:27:32,732 --> 01:27:34,063
...DDP...

1242
01:27:34,265 --> 01:27:37,199
...Diamond Dallas Page!

1243
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:56,215
I heard Sal was just too beat up
to make the trip.

1244
01:27:57,656 --> 01:28:01,888
And now the triple cage is
in place and ready.

1245
01:28:02,161 --> 01:28:06,154
The challenger and champion are ready.

1246
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,727
Are we ready?

1247
01:28:13,105 --> 01:28:15,130
For the thousands in attendance...

1248
01:28:15,307 --> 01:28:18,470
...and the millions watching
around the world...

1249
01:28:19,612 --> 01:28:21,136
...ladies and gentlemen...

1250
01:28:21,514 --> 01:28:22,708
...we are...

1251
01:28:22,915 --> 01:28:26,373
...ready to rumble!

1252
01:28:37,597 --> 01:28:38,689
See you in hell.

1253
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:43,064
There's the opening bell. You can feel
the electricity and the emotion...

1254
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:44,897
...in this great arena.

1255
01:28:48,141 --> 01:28:49,505
Come on, let's do this!

1256
01:28:53,779 --> 01:28:54,609
You can't spit!

1257
01:28:59,853 --> 01:29:00,649
Yeah, that's it!

1258
01:29:08,029 --> 01:29:09,963
Oh, jeez, God, that's bad.

1259
01:29:16,338 --> 01:29:19,136
Come on, King.
Let me give you a hand, buddy.

1260
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,629
Page!

1261
01:29:22,376 --> 01:29:25,504
You idiot! That stuff doesn't work.

1262
01:29:28,784 --> 01:29:31,048
A diamond upside down is a pussy!

1263
01:29:31,253 --> 01:29:33,050
- Come on, King!
- Son of a bitch!

1264
01:29:33,254 --> 01:29:35,085
King positioning the ladder
in the ring.

1265
01:29:35,256 --> 01:29:36,348
Hurry up! Come on!

1266
01:29:36,558 --> 01:29:38,822
He's headed up to the second cage.

1267
01:29:39,026 --> 01:29:39,856
Get him now!

1268
01:29:40,062 --> 01:29:43,896
Who are these two guys that are
coming out? That's Juventud Guerrero.

1269
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,869
Juventud Guerrero just
drop-kicked the ladder!

1270
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:52,174
Who's that other masked wrestler?

1271
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:56,342
- The crown!
- King's going for the crown!

1272
01:29:56,545 --> 01:29:58,206
Come on, King.

1273
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:01,007
Smack him around like
a toothless crack whore!

1274
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,921
Everybody out here now!
All of you, let's go! Come on!

1275
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:11,316
Four men are coming out.
Of course, it's DDP's goons.

1276
01:30:13,929 --> 01:30:15,294
Look out, Jimmy!

1277
01:30:22,003 --> 01:30:25,598
Yeah, baby! That's it!
That's what I'm talking about!

1278
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:28,738
Don't, Dad, don't!

1279
01:30:28,978 --> 01:30:30,275
Don't do it, Dad.

1280
01:30:30,447 --> 01:30:32,210
Why did Jimmy King stop?

1281
01:30:32,749 --> 01:30:35,980
What's going on here?
He just stopped in his tracks.

1282
01:30:37,087 --> 01:30:38,315
Son?

1283
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:40,888
Jesus, what the hell are you doing?

1284
01:30:41,091 --> 01:30:42,080
Paying you back!

1285
01:30:45,763 --> 01:30:48,994
Now Jimmy King's the recipient
of a horrible beating.

1286
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:51,133
And it all started with his own son.

1287
01:31:02,346 --> 01:31:03,404
Yeah, baby!

1288
01:31:05,449 --> 01:31:06,438
Here comes relief.

1289
01:31:06,984 --> 01:31:09,976
Look, it's Goldberg.
It's the Disco Inferno...

1290
01:31:10,188 --> 01:31:11,746
...Kidman and Booker T.!

1291
01:31:12,757 --> 01:31:15,452
There's no way they can
get through the gate.

1292
01:31:17,627 --> 01:31:20,027
Mike, what is this?
What's this right here?

1293
01:31:42,987 --> 01:31:45,615
- Get him good!
- You want to turn that crap off?

1294
01:31:46,223 --> 01:31:48,691
My son almost threw away a career
for that nonsense.

1295
01:31:48,927 --> 01:31:51,452
Your son's starting a career
with that nonsense.

1296
01:31:51,664 --> 01:31:53,154
Hit him, hit him.

1297
01:31:53,331 --> 01:31:55,060
Come on. You can do it.

1298
01:31:56,168 --> 01:31:57,157
Come on, King!

1299
01:31:57,336 --> 01:31:59,429
Son of a bitch!

1300
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:02,737
Get up and get that belt!

1301
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:06,369
That's my best friend.
He's not really a cop, though.

1302
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,379
Harpoon his ass!

1303
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:18,915
That's my boy!

1304
01:32:20,693 --> 01:32:22,354
Nice spear, kid.

1305
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:24,485
Who you calling "kid"?

1306
01:32:24,697 --> 01:32:27,062
You hear me?
Go in there and get them!

1307
01:32:27,265 --> 01:32:30,291
Jimmy King has made his way
up to the second cage.

1308
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:33,199
You have the right to an attorney!
If you cannot...

1309
01:32:33,706 --> 01:32:37,164
- Good to have you back, brother!
- Good to be back, brother.

1310
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:40,335
Did you check it out?
Do you like my deal?

1311
01:32:40,546 --> 01:32:42,036
You're such the Ponch!

1312
01:32:42,248 --> 01:32:44,808
Gordie, you look great
in that uniform.

1313
01:32:45,051 --> 01:32:47,212
And the fans love you.

1314
01:32:47,387 --> 01:32:49,412
I think we should get back together.

1315
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:53,760
I could never forgive you
for what you did to Sal.

1316
01:32:53,993 --> 01:32:55,255
You're a mean lady.

1317
01:32:56,896 --> 01:32:57,885
Shut up, Sean!

1318
01:32:58,131 --> 01:32:59,155
You shouldn't...

1319
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:04,269
- stand so close to the ring
when there's a ladder match going on.

1320
01:33:07,506 --> 01:33:10,202
Now both Diamond Dallas Page
and Jimmy King...

1321
01:33:10,845 --> 01:33:13,541
...have made it up to the second cage.

1322
01:33:20,754 --> 01:33:23,882
The further you get up,
the tougher it is...

1323
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:25,990
...and they are wasting each other.

1324
01:33:27,729 --> 01:33:29,754
Can you imagine the intensity?

1325
01:33:32,067 --> 01:33:34,900
This thing has turned into
a hard-core street fight.

1326
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:44,166
DDP is headed up. He's made his way
into cage number three.

1327
01:34:08,036 --> 01:34:12,029
He just sent Jimmy King down
all the way to cage number one!

1328
01:34:20,949 --> 01:34:23,850
It's Sting! He nailed
Diamond Dallas Page!

1329
01:34:27,122 --> 01:34:28,521
What are you doing, freak?!

1330
01:34:29,825 --> 01:34:32,623
Sting is helping Jimmy King!
Can you believe this?

1331
01:34:32,996 --> 01:34:34,293
This is a shocker!

1332
01:34:37,499 --> 01:34:38,932
Jimmy King's all right by me.

1333
01:34:39,936 --> 01:34:41,494
You love Jimmy King.

1334
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:43,865
I love Jimmy King.

1335
01:34:44,107 --> 01:34:45,199
We're men.

1336
01:34:45,375 --> 01:34:48,503
And we're not afraid to say
that we love other men.

1337
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:50,268
I love you.

1338
01:34:52,582 --> 01:34:54,743
Me too, man. Hit me! My turn!

1339
01:34:55,718 --> 01:34:57,549
It's even. It's back to square one.

1340
01:34:58,454 --> 01:35:02,481
They're fighting their way up
the side of the cage toward the top.

1341
01:35:26,684 --> 01:35:29,118
Who the hell are you fighting for?

1342
01:35:29,286 --> 01:35:30,981
Me!

1343
01:35:53,577 --> 01:35:56,944
You got it, King! You got it!
Come on!

1344
01:36:22,474 --> 01:36:25,409
Diamond Dallas Page has taken
a horrible fall!

1345
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:26,872
He's down!

1346
01:36:31,816 --> 01:36:33,716
Yeah! Come on, buddy!

1347
01:36:46,633 --> 01:36:49,295
And Jimmy King has the belt!
He did it!

1348
01:36:49,502 --> 01:36:51,766
Jimmy King is the champion!

1349
01:36:53,005 --> 01:36:54,734
Yeah, baby!

1350
01:36:54,941 --> 01:36:56,602
You did it!

1351
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:14,223
Yeah! That's right!

1352
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:21,165
What a struggle, what a battle!

1353
01:37:21,367 --> 01:37:24,825
Jimmy King has overcome all the odds,
Mike! He's the champion!

1354
01:37:25,037 --> 01:37:27,562
You suck, Sinclair!

1355
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:29,999
Get out of here!

1356
01:37:34,413 --> 01:37:35,846
What are you talking about?

1357
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:39,512
I made wrestling! Me!

1358
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,715
I made them all!

1359
01:37:44,057 --> 01:37:46,719
You didn't make wrestling!
We made wrestling!

1360
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:50,619
Yeah, geek.

1361
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:53,323
The people, the fans made wrestling.

1362
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:09,878
We want King! We want King!

1363
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:14,787
In the most amazing battle ever
witnessed, ladies and gentlemen...

1364
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:19,017
...the undisputed WCW
Heavyweight Champion of the World:

1365
01:38:19,228 --> 01:38:21,753
Jimmy King!

1366
01:38:24,432 --> 01:38:26,297
You regained the heavyweight title.

1367
01:38:26,502 --> 01:38:29,368
What about tag-team belts?
Any thoughts about unification?

1368
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:33,131
Excuse me. Jimmy, looks like
you need a tag-team partner.

1369
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:34,637
What do you say?

1370
01:38:35,276 --> 01:38:38,074
Bill, I appreciate it. Really, I do.

1371
01:38:39,715 --> 01:38:43,776
But I think I already got me
a tag-team partner out here somewhere.

1372
01:38:44,386 --> 01:38:45,512
Where is he?

1373
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:50,483
There he is. That's him right there.

1374
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,660
My new tag-team partner.

1375
01:38:53,862 --> 01:38:55,921
That's Gordie Boggs, a.k.a. The Law!

1376
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:01,091
I will bust you!

1377
01:39:01,804 --> 01:39:03,795
That's it! That's it!

1378
01:39:04,006 --> 01:39:05,997
Right here's our new manager...

1379
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:09,006
...Sean "Sugar Daddy" Dawkins!

1380
01:39:13,983 --> 01:39:16,008
I love you, Sean!

1381
01:39:16,219 --> 01:39:18,187
I love Sean!

1382
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:44,742
So you see...

1383
01:39:45,116 --> 01:39:46,447
...dreams can come true.

1384
01:39:46,649 --> 01:39:49,140
Yeah, but it was a one-time deal.

1385
01:39:49,319 --> 01:39:52,447
Like you'll really manage King,
and Gordie's gonna wrestle.

1386
01:40:09,975 --> 01:40:11,840
Can you say it now?

1387
01:40:13,845 --> 01:40:16,507
I'm your bitch and you're my daddy?

1388
01:40:18,649 --> 01:40:20,310
Rolled right off his tongue.

1389
01:40:20,551 --> 01:40:22,985
That should teach you
to be nice to kids.

1390
01:40:28,426 --> 01:40:29,324
Gentlemen...

1391
01:40:30,128 --> 01:40:31,322
...we've gotta go.

1392
01:40:41,674 --> 01:40:44,199
God bless America!

1393
01:41:00,493 --> 01:41:02,791
You like Samoan butt sex?

1394
01:41:04,596 --> 01:41:08,191
There's a lot of glare coming off
of that dome of yours, anus-breath!

1395
01:41:08,366 --> 01:41:12,063
There's a lot of glare coming off
of that dome of yours, booger-face!

1396
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:15,728
I know. It smells like you poured it
right from your butt.

1397
01:41:15,941 --> 01:41:18,933
Smells like you poured it
right from your butt. Sorry.

1398
01:41:22,082 --> 01:41:23,777
Wait, I forgot the line.

1399
01:41:23,984 --> 01:41:26,179
Now I'm gonna get you!

1400
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:28,887
Oh, shit, man!

1401
01:41:29,089 --> 01:41:32,183
Michael got himself a whore

1402
01:41:32,359 --> 01:41:33,826
Sorry.

1403
01:41:34,294 --> 01:41:36,285
That was quite a thrill.
How you...?

1404
01:41:36,496 --> 01:41:38,259
That's my hand. It's broken now.

1405
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:39,865
Come on, this is nothing!

1406
01:41:40,067 --> 01:41:43,002
You remember when Macho Man
threw you off the rail?

1407
01:41:43,303 --> 01:41:44,292
Go. Start again.

1408
01:41:44,503 --> 01:41:45,800
Come on, this is nothing!

1409
01:41:46,005 --> 01:41:48,701
You remember when Macho Man
threw you off the rail?

1410
01:41:48,909 --> 01:41:50,774
No, that's bad. One more time.

1411
01:41:50,978 --> 01:41:52,843
Come on, this is nothing!

1412
01:41:53,046 --> 01:41:54,240
- Sorry.
- Shut up.

1413
01:41:54,414 --> 01:41:58,145
Yeah, and he broke five ribs
and dislocated your shoulder...

1414
01:41:58,318 --> 01:42:00,377
...but you broke...

1415
01:42:00,754 --> 01:42:03,120
You broke five ribs
and dislocated your shoulder!

1416
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:05,623
You still came back to whip all three!

1417
01:42:07,593 --> 01:42:09,788
He's worthless.

1418
01:42:09,998 --> 01:42:11,590
He can't do it.

1419
01:42:13,635 --> 01:42:15,660
Breasts. Jugs. Hooters.

1420
01:42:16,938 --> 01:42:19,463
I can't stop looking at them!

1421
01:42:26,281 --> 01:42:27,805
Terrifying.

1422
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,832
Oh, the humanity!
