00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,156
It is safe to assume
that professional wrestlers...

3
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:59,282
...are universally recognized
as the greatest athletes of all time.

4
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:03,388
Sammartino, Blassie,
Gorgeous George...

5
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,497
...George "The Animal" Steele,
Superfly Snooka...

6
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,861
...Andre the Giant, Hulk Hogan.

7
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,732
These are heroes of history.

8
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,101
Superior athletes...

9
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,742
...superior men.

10
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,713
Giants come and go in this great sport
of ours, but there is only one king

11
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:30,477
Jimmy King.

12
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:34,013
Jimmy King is the greatest
wrestler of all time.

13
00:01:34,258 --> 00:01:37,193
He's undefeated,
and he holds the record...

14
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:41,228
...for the longest winning streak in
the history of professional wrestling.

15
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:45,328
King says, and I quote

16
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,766
"People said I was a dreamer...

17
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:52,600
...an idiot, and a waste of life,
and I will never amount to anything."

18
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,275
Hey, jackass.

19
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:58,910
You're a waste of life. Why don't you
go amount to nothing somewhere else?

20
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:03,446
And I told you little turdlets not to
park your junk in front of the shop!

21
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:07,284
Wrestling is for retards!

22
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:10,316
"Jimmy King's the greatest!"

23
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:13,792
You guys are as dumb as paint.

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,255
Really dumb paint.

25
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:20,292
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

26
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:24,129
Listen, Jimmy King is
the people's champion.

27
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,297
He's immortal, timeless.
He can raise the dead!

28
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,339
Can he really raise the dead? My dog,
Skipper, is buried under my sandbox.

29
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,401
Well, I don't know
about your dog, Skipper.

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,273
But don't worry,
because tomorrow night...

31
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:42,145
...Jimmy King is gonna whup
Diamond Dallas Page's ass.

32
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,650
We're gonna be there.

33
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:45,617
Right, Gordie?

34
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,123
Gordie?

35
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,061
Gordie?

36
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:04,671
What do you want, boob?

37
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:07,703
Purple sugar slush, king-size.

38
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:10,103
That'll be $1.26.

39
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:15,147
$1.25. That's all I got.

40
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:18,906
That's just not good enough,
now, is it, you little boob?

41
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,745
You little Jimmy the King fan boob!

42
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:26,356
Jimmy King's a big fat loser!
He's a sissy in tights!

43
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:30,926
There's a lot of glare coming off
that dome of yours, squirrel nuts!

44
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:34,463
Listen, sunshine...

45
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:38,395
...l'm gonna open up a fresh can
of whup-ass on you, boy!

46
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:41,798
Bring it on!

47
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:51,842
Tag me! Tag me!

48
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:54,348
Now you're gonna get it!

49
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:57,414
You messed with
the "Macho Man" Randy Savage!

50
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,682
I'm gonna get you! Yeah!

51
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:03,790
Bam! Bam! Bam!

52
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:07,928
King!

53
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,959
One! Two! Three!

54
00:04:58,273 --> 00:04:59,706
Gordie?

55
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:04,577
Whoa, serious brain freeze.
That icy sugar locked up my nog-nog.

56
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:08,677
What about me, guy?
I was thirsty too.

57
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:10,941
I'll get you a refill.

58
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:13,175
No, don't sweat it.
The guy's a moron.

59
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:14,986
Come on, I feel bad.

60
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,621
Hey, Gordie?

61
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:19,455
Yeah?

62
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,523
Why does it look like you have
your finger in your butt?

63
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,890
Because I do.

64
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,166
Jerko, what do you want?

65
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,501
- I need a new sugar slush.
- Why?

66
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:42,371
There's something wrong
with this one. Smell it.

67
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,473
That's awful.

68
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:48,376
I know.

69
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,052
Smells like...

70
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:52,777
- Like...
- Like my ass, right?

71
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,385
- Or maybe your ass. It's weird, huh?
- Like a bitter, sour ass!

72
00:05:57,593 --> 00:05:59,560
Like you poured it from your butt.

73
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:05,132
I will get you another one ASAP.

74
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,767
- Thanks.
- It's so bad.

75
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,333
How could you drink that?

76
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,607
I struggled through most of it, but
the butt-fruit settled at the bottom.

77
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,208
Freeze, loafer!

78
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,845
Come on. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

79
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:29,020
Come on, you know the drill.

80
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:34,490
You got any stuff on you?

81
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:38,161
Whoa. What's this?

82
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:39,329
My nuts.

83
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:44,363
Listen, pal, wouldn't you rather
be on the other side of this search?

84
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:46,331
You want me to grab your nuts?

85
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,367
Whoa. Yeah, you too.

86
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,372
Come on, sweetheart. Join the party.

87
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:54,132
Keep your hands where I can see them!

88
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:59,046
Dad, you gotta cut the crap
with the shakedowns.

89
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:03,617
You're gonna be a good cop, Gordie.
It'll change your life.

90
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:06,844
Look what it's done
for your mom and your sister.

91
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,214
What is this crap?

92
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:11,584
Wrestling?

93
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:16,523
Wrestling's fake.

94
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,628
Wrestling's not fake!

95
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:24,560
I like wrestling.

96
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:26,828
Are you gonna be a wrestler?

97
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,532
You got trouble...

98
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:32,403
...wrestling your wee-wee out
of your trousers to take a leak.

99
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,706
It's not that I have trouble.
Just sometimes I don't see the point.

100
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:37,972
Gordon.

101
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,547
Wrestling's a game for little boys.

102
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:44,249
Police work's for men.

103
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,089
Come on, let's bounce.

104
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,261
Wrestling's for dirtbags
and lily-pickers.

105
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:56,021
You'll be back.

106
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,255
The badge'll be waiting!

107
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:09,439
- My dad sucks, man.
- At least you got one.

108
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:14,580
Right, sorry. It's just that he's
always on my ass about getting a job.

109
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:17,715
I mean, he's making me
take that cop exam.

110
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:20,886
- You have a job.
- I know.

111
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,552
I should decide what
I want to do with my life.

112
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:26,987
- That's right.
- Like Jimmy King says

113
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:29,957
"This is America.
I can be anyone I want!"

114
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:33,495
He actually says,
"I can beat up anyone I want."

115
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:35,326
- Really?
- Yeah.

116
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,502
But who cares, bro?
What's tonight?

117
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,533
Monday Night Nitro!

118
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,899
Live, baby, live
Live, baby, live

119
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:55,078
This'll be awesome.
It'll be out of control.

120
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:58,385
Page vs. King
and it's not a pay-per-view?

121
00:08:58,587 --> 00:08:59,611
Oh, yeah!

122
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,788
Hey, shit-boys!
How's the shit work?

123
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,952
Excuse the mess.
My aim's a little off.

124
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:11,495
I've been using the jackhammer.

125
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:21,233
All done. We did it.
Good job, Gordie.

126
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:24,600
You too.

127
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:27,039
Little too much coffee for me today.

128
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,788
- Don't do it.
- What?

129
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:40,489
Don't "what" me.
You know what. Don't do it.

130
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,819
- Friends don't do it to friends.
- Okay.

131
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:47,422
If you do it, Jimmy King'll
get hurt tonight. Don't.

132
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:49,098
Don't worry. I won't.

133
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:08,513
Gordie?

134
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,718
Nothing can hurt Jimmy King.

135
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,084
Stop it!

136
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,248
Gordie, stop it, please!

137
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:20,792
I'm gonna kick your ass!

138
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:25,093
Make it stop!

139
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,362
Sorry, man, I couldn't help it.

140
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:31,594
Sean, are you okay, man?

141
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:33,066
Sean!

142
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:45,883
Couldn't help it?
I can't help delivering a suplex!

143
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:48,114
Get off me!

144
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:59,187
Welcome to EZ Take-Out Burger.
How may I help you?

145
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:03,456
Sean wants Brittany's taco,
with cheese all over it.

146
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:04,654
Stop!

147
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:09,133
I should have smelled it was you.
What do you guys want?

148
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:12,165
Hi, Brittany, I'm sorry.
Can I please have...

149
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:15,209
...a cheeseburger maxi-meal...

150
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:19,779
- And a Brittany bare-ass buffet...
- Please! Please!

151
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:20,809
What?

152
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,912
He said that he wanted the Brittany...
Stop it!

153
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,143
- Did you say...?
- We'll pull up now.

154
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,015
Why?

155
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,952
Why don't you just ask her out?

156
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,320
How does my hair look?
Is it the Finesse?

157
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,088
You're driving a truck of ass-juice.
Don't worry about your hair.

158
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:43,868
I cannot deal with these losers.
I'm gonna work with the cheese.

159
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,732
Hi, Gordie.

160
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:50,372
- Sean.
- Hi, Wendy.

161
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:53,804
- Where'd Brittany go?
- She switched to cheese.

162
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:57,843
Sean, you think King's gonna put
a hurting on Diamond Dallas Page?

163
00:11:58,748 --> 00:12:00,511
Yes, I most certainly do.

164
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:04,982
Hey, Brittany! How's the weather
in there? Cold today, hot tamale?

165
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,211
Leave me alone, loser!

166
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:10,721
Au corvair. Would a loser
have two tickets...

167
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:14,520
...to Monday Night Nitro,
live from Cheyenne, tonight?

168
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:16,218
Yes.

169
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,531
Brittany, listen.
Let's go out again.

170
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:23,328
We'll go out.
We won't talk about wrestling.

171
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:24,697
We'll talk about us...

172
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:31,572
You should give up on Brittany.

173
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:36,577
No way. She's my dream girl, bro.
Come on.

174
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,478
Well, what about Wendy?
She digs you.

175
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:43,950
No. She's too much
like one of the guys.

176
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:47,323
- That's bad?
- That's gay.

177
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:50,728
Right.

178
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,230
Look what I made.

179
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:04,603
Oh, wicked.

180
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,668
No. It stands for something.

181
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:10,337
W-W-K-D.

182
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,246
"What Would King Do?"

183
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,809
When I got a problem
and don't know what to do...

184
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:18,610
...I look down, and I look at it
and I think

185
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:21,981
What would King do?

186
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:24,657
Man, that rocks.

187
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:29,291
I made two.

188
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:33,932
That rocks hard, man.

189
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:40,896
Mrs. MacKenzie!

190
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:43,300
Ready for that big match tonight?

191
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:48,069
Oh, yes, boys. Jimmy King is gonna
bitch-slap Diamond Dallas.

192
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,873
We're gonna be there.
We're going.

193
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:55,310
Get me a T-shirt.
A really tight one.

194
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:58,821
That's gross, Mrs. MacKenzie.

195
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,491
Freeze!

196
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,868
Your sister shot her first perp today.

197
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:16,736
That's nice, Gabby.

198
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,805
She put one shot in his right buttock.

199
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:22,476
Just doing her job.

200
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:26,278
That's great. See you guys later.

201
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,176
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You better be back by 11.

202
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,847
You got a police admission
seminar tomorrow.

203
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,310
I've given that a lot of thought...

204
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:37,681
See you at 11.

205
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:54,001
Kid, move your fat head!
I can't see!

206
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:56,934
Sorry, Uncle Billy said
they were good seats.

207
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,136
Uncle Billy sucks!

208
00:14:59,343 --> 00:15:01,242
He lost his right nut in Nam.

209
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,971
Kick him in his left nut
when you see him. These seats bite!

210
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:08,449
Hey, if you only have one left...

211
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:10,582
...is it still your left nut?

212
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:15,382
Let's get closer.
King's coming up.

213
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:35,097
Nitro girls, dead ahead.

214
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:37,370
There's Chae. She's the best.

215
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:41,513
Do not concur.
Sasha is the best of the best.

216
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:01,128
How you doing, Booker?

217
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,061
How you doing, boys?
Look, King's late again.

218
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:08,292
I don't know what to do.
I'm so sick of this shit.

219
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:11,334
- What's the finish?
- The finish is gonna be...

220
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:16,338
He'll pile-drive you, crown you,
and he's gonna get the win.

221
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,534
Works for me.
I'll tell the King.

222
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,269
Nice to see you, Billy.

223
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:22,573
Dallas, I want to talk to you.

224
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,746
Forget what I just told you.

225
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,387
Remember I told you
I'd take care of you?

226
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,217
Tonight's your night.

227
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,448
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

228
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,324
Works for me, bro.

229
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,728
Ladies and gentlemen...

230
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,059
...here we go with tonight's main
event for the WCWheavyweight crown.

231
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:45,134
Page vs. King! Page vs. King!

232
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,600
- Hell, yeah!
- Page vs. King!

233
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:50,136
Diamond Dallas Page!

234
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,112
It's time, folks.
It's finally here.

235
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:05,549
King vs. Diamond Dallas Page.

236
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:10,453
Come on, Diamond Dallas.
Take it like the punk bitch you are!

237
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:14,226
The King of Rock
is holding court tonight.

238
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:17,795
Here's the reigning WCW Heavyweight...

239
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:19,694
...Champion of the World

240
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:23,893
Please welcome Jimmy King!

241
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:26,032
Behold the King!

242
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,663
Yeah, baby!

243
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,694
All night long.

244
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:02,200
Here comes Jimmy.

245
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:06,306
Look at that. With all the majesty
and flair befitting a true king.

246
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:16,172
Hello, Cheyenne, Wyoming.
We're gonna rule some ass tonight!

247
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:22,079
I want to welcome you
to the royal ass-kicking...

248
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:24,779
...of Diamond Dallas Page!

249
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:31,220
You wanna see me make
Diamond Dallas Page...

250
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:34,729
...one of my ladies
in waiting tonight?

251
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:39,928
You wanna see me take
Diamond Dallas Page...

252
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,163
...down into my dungeon...

253
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:46,969
...and make him my medieval
puppy-dog bitch tonight?

254
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:49,909
Yeah! That's what I thought!

255
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:53,075
- I'm the...
- Sing it, man!

256
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:55,411
I'm King of Rock
There is none higher

257
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:57,916
Sucker emcees just call me sire

258
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:00,180
To rule my kingdom
You must use fire

259
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,491
I won't stop rocking till I retire

260
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:05,592
I love that shit!

261
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,964
Look and listen
to this capacity crowd...

262
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:21,733
...and the reaction we would
expect for Titus Sinclair...

263
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:23,670
...who's in the ring.

264
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:25,504
Glad you made it.

265
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:28,804
- Boo!
- You suck, Sinclair!

266
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:32,007
For chrissake, Titus,
you're hogging my spotlight.

267
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:35,585
Your spotlight?
I invented you, you idiot.

268
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:38,517
This is mine.
You seem to have forgotten that.

269
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:40,190
Count your money, midget.

270
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,927
You know, Jimmy...

271
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:48,527
...you're still the same dumb trailer
hitch I discovered 14 years ago.

272
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:55,264
I just want to have
this final moment together.

273
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,538
The bell sounds
and the battle is underway.

274
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:07,875
What, Elvis? Won't be on time
with the rest of us?

275
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:11,086
Traffic, baby, traffic.
Come on, come on!

276
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:16,421
You're not too good today, King.

277
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:18,489
- What you got?
- Hammerlock, baby.

278
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:20,093
Good God!

279
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,694
The King's showing
what's made him the champion.

280
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:26,288
Ready?

281
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,227
Good sound effects.

282
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:46,878
Double neck-breaker.
Both men are down!

283
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:50,684
What a vicious move that is!
King goes for the cover.

284
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:53,550
He's trying for an early win.
He didn't get it.

285
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:57,455
- Three!
- You do your job, I'll do mine.

286
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:07,801
Okay, Pagey. Hip toss, baby.

287
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:12,964
Oh, did you see that elbow?
Down goes Jimmy King!

288
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:14,664
What the hell was that?

289
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:23,718
Jimmy's in trouble!

290
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:27,319
This is as vicious as we've
ever seen Diamond Dallas Page!

291
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:29,613
- What are you doing?
- Get out of my face!

292
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,315
Why?

293
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,324
Boss's orders, fat boy.

294
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,727
- Kick his leathery ass!
- Destroy him!

295
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,133
And Jimmy King is not done yet!

296
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,744
A pair of shots from King
has DDP on the defensive.

297
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,909
See you!

298
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:08,488
He broke the table!
Oh, my goodness!

299
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:15,219
King down on the floor,
trying to get up to a knee.

300
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,488
Come on, fat boy.

301
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:18,699
Let me help you back in. Come on.

302
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:24,165
Out of nowhere, Jimmy King with a
foreign object to the head of DDP!

303
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:25,931
King mounting the corner.

304
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:28,539
I think he's gonna
go up for the crown.

305
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:32,111
- Crown him, King!
- Prepare to be varnished!

306
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,055
Here's a move we've seen before.
Very familiar. Diamond Dallas...

307
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:48,521
...motioning to the crowd that
it's time for the diamond cutter.

308
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:51,523
King caught him!

309
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:55,859
That will stop anything, including
the diamond cutter, I'll tell you.

310
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:57,930
Both men down!
Wait a minute!

311
00:22:58,136 --> 00:23:00,832
Here come Page's goons,
led by Sid Vicious!

312
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,737
They're the biggest, meanest men
in our sport, coming to help Dallas.

313
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,168
Watch out, King!

314
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,845
Power bomb by Sid Vicious on King!

315
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:21,684
The double diamond cutter!

316
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:23,249
No! No!

317
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,849
Toss him out!

318
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:33,857
Here they come! Finally, the King's
men have come to bail him out!

319
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:36,068
- That's right!
- Oh, yeah!

320
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:40,672
The wrestlers are surrounding King.
I don't know what's going on here.

321
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:45,107
Wait a minute.
They're all attacking Jimmy King!

322
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:48,680
They turned on him!
Sinclair must have got to them.

323
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:54,150
What's wrong with you?

324
00:23:55,153 --> 00:23:58,850
DDP motioning to his goons
to head up to the top rope.

325
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:01,124
King!

326
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:11,829
This is what you get when you
suck your money down the toilet!

327
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,764
- You jinxed him!
- No, God, no!

328
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,268
- Get off of me!
- This isn't even a pay-per-view!

329
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:19,639
Four men.

330
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,742
There's four wrestlers
on the four corner posts.

331
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:26,244
- A four-post massacre!
- No one can survive this!

332
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:28,343
No!

333
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,493
It's a four-post massacre.
They all come up at the same time!

334
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,163
Incredible!

335
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,595
Come on, get up! Count him out!
Count him out!

336
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:56,164
Count it, ref.
One! Two! Three!

337
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,773
Ladies and gentlemen.

338
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:02,377
Your winner and new WCW...

339
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:04,808
...Heavyweight Champion
of the World

340
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:08,415
Diamond Dallas Page!

341
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:15,357
Ladies and gentlemen.

342
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,153
You have witnessed the demise...

343
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:21,987
...of Jimmy King.

344
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,626
He will never, ever...

345
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:30,065
...fight for the WCW again.

346
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:34,936
Long live the new king
and reigning champion...

347
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:38,542
...Diamond Dallas Page!

348
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:45,215
Feel that, Jimmy?

349
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:48,211
That's your spotlight fading.

350
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:51,846
- Why?
- Why?

351
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,315
Why not?

352
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,825
You're through. I'm done with you.

353
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:02,062
Rest in peace.

354
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:21,038
Damn allergies.

355
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,379
Yeah, me too.
Damn stupid allergies.

356
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:27,851
Unfair, bogus allergies!

357
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:34,955
Unfair, cheating, blind ref!

358
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:38,121
Bogus Sinclair allergies!

359
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:40,855
Damn Diamond Dallas Page!

360
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,399
Right, Sean, let it out, man.

361
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:47,039
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

362
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:03,584
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy...

363
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:07,785
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

364
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,218
Oh, my God.

365
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:14,420
We made it!

366
00:27:14,664 --> 00:27:16,427
We're alive!

367
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:20,659
Would that be raw sewage I'm smelling?

368
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:24,433
Yeah. I kind of
always liked the smell.

369
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:29,144
Yeah, me too.
Kind of smells like French toast.

370
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:33,069
What? French toast dipped in shit.

371
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,323
Damn it, Jim.
We're firemen, not janitors.

372
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:49,016
We sure as hell
aren't gonna clean this up.

373
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:12,507
Shit!

374
00:28:29,297 --> 00:28:31,161
What're the odds of that?

375
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:49,713
That truck and that business were
all my dad left me when he died.

376
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,612
That's all I've got
to remember him by.

377
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:57,154
I'll remember my dad by the epic
beating I get for coming home late.

378
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:00,147
We got no jobs, Gordie.

379
00:29:00,392 --> 00:29:02,417
State police, here I come.

380
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,562
I can't believe how much we suck!

381
00:29:06,764 --> 00:29:08,823
Everything's changed overnight.

382
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,534
Yeah, but if Jimmy King
can win the title back...

383
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:12,894
- Gordie.
- What?

384
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:17,334
You heard what Sinclair said, right?
He kicked Jimmy King out of the WCW.

385
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:20,101
A lifetime ban. No rematch.

386
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:22,740
It's over, Gordie.

387
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:25,242
Jimmy King's dead, okay?

388
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:28,080
- Sean?
- What?

389
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:30,617
You think things
happen for a reason?

390
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:34,084
What could possibly
be the reason for this?

391
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:37,383
All right. Don't you think
it's a little strange...

392
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:40,593
...that we were in Cheyenne
the same day Jimmy King...

393
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:45,265
...was cheated out of his title
and banned from the WCW for life?

394
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:49,902
Don't you think it's strange that
we crashed the truck on the way home?

395
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:53,572
It's a little strange,
but what are we supposed to do?

396
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:55,034
Exactly.

397
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:57,199
What?

398
00:29:58,343 --> 00:29:59,867
What would King do?

399
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,504
I don't know, Gordie.
What would he do?

400
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:06,308
I'll tell you.
He'd fight to make it right.

401
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:11,520
You just let me know when he
shows up and does that, okay?

402
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:15,957
There's a part of King inside me,
telling me we got one choice.

403
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:18,622
We gotta find Jimmy King.

404
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,820
This must've happened for a reason.

405
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:24,157
It's gotta be some kind of test.

406
00:30:26,102 --> 00:30:27,797
We gotta find the King.

407
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:32,207
We gotta find the King?

408
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:35,974
You and me?

409
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:40,911
Things happen for a reason, man.
We gotta find the King.

410
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:42,172
What do you say?

411
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:46,611
How far is Atlanta from here?

412
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:55,725
Sir, it's cold.

413
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:57,495
Jerk!

414
00:31:01,332 --> 00:31:02,923
- Oh, yes.
- Thank God.

415
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:08,938
Hey. We're trying to get to Atlanta.

416
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:11,970
We're headed to Daytona.
Atlanta's on our way.

417
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:13,941
Come on in, boys.

418
00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:15,110
Hallelujah.

419
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:19,880
Kumbaya, my Lord

420
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:22,211
Kumbaya

421
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:26,746
Kumbaya, my Lord

422
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:29,387
Kumbaya

423
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:34,218
Michael, row your boat ashore

424
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:37,327
Alleluia

425
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:40,762
Michael, row your boat ashore

426
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:43,103
Alleluia

427
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:48,434
- Do you guys know any Van Halen?
- No.

428
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:50,242
No.

429
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:52,144
No.

430
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:58,875
Running with the devil

431
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,616
Running with the devil

432
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,851
Break it down, mama.

433
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:12,995
I live my life
Like there's no tomorrow

434
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,688
All I've got I had to steal

435
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,463
She stole it.

436
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:23,138
I don't need to beg or borrow

437
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:27,604
Yes, I'm living at a pace that kills

438
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,181
Running with the devil

439
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,447
Running with the devil

440
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:41,752
Oh, yeah

441
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:57,758
- Thank you.
- See you later.

442
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,769
You chicks rock!

443
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:06,642
Hey, bro, I know we just
got all this religion...

444
00:33:06,878 --> 00:33:09,903
...but I got a question,
and I need a serious answer.

445
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,843
- Swear to God?
- Swear to God.

446
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,084
Did you fart in that van?

447
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,343
It wasn't me. Swear to God.

448
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:20,283
Me neither. Swear to God.

449
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:23,683
Oh, my God.

450
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:25,951
They were the farting nuns.

451
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:30,191
Bingo!

452
00:33:30,465 --> 00:33:31,830
Let's do this.

453
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:36,996
I will rule you!

454
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,977
Gonna be a while.
Me and Jimmy King don't lose.

455
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:50,679
Down with King?
Big Jimmy King fan?

456
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:52,916
King is king.

457
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:54,847
Bullshit what happened.

458
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,587
Makes me wanna puke. But my dad
says puking's for pussies.

459
00:33:59,358 --> 00:34:02,087
I puke all the time
and I'm not a pussy.

460
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:07,464
Listen, me and my associate...

461
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:09,598
...we're on a quest to find King.

462
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,631
You know where his mansion is?

463
00:34:12,102 --> 00:34:15,469
I heard he lives in a castle.
I never seen it, though.

464
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:17,298
I could probably find it.

465
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,371
You can find Jimmy King?

466
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:22,067
I can find anyone on the Net.

467
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:26,038
I'll search the Web for info
on King's whereabouts.

468
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:27,339
Good. Smart.

469
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,507
You're the King!

470
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:33,686
- Oh, yeah? I will rule you!
- Dude.

471
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:35,617
Dude, my dad'll hear you.

472
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:37,888
Sorry, man. I'll keep it down.

473
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,260
Thanks.

474
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,652
Give it to you two times!

475
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:44,323
Sorry.

476
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:49,192
I found a site. "King, Jimmy.

477
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:51,695
Wife, Eugenia."

478
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:54,869
Hey, and you're in luck.

479
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,467
Here's the address.

480
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:01,271
Sir Isaac,
you've served your king well.

481
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,207
My loneliness is killing me

482
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:10,686
I must confess I still believe

483
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:18,593
Give me a sign

484
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:22,092
Hit me baby one more time

485
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,865
It's not exactly a castle.

486
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:41,604
Eugenia King?

487
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,643
- Jimmy King's wife?
- Yeah.

488
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:46,476
The queen.

489
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:48,849
Front and present.

490
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:53,891
We're looking for the King.
Is he home?

491
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:57,119
What are you, high?
He hasn't been home in two years.

492
00:35:57,396 --> 00:36:00,796
All I got to remember him by
is an itchy crotch.

493
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,267
You ever seen crabs up close?

494
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:04,936
You wanna see?

495
00:36:06,504 --> 00:36:08,768
- Fantastic.
- Wait, no.

496
00:36:10,108 --> 00:36:11,006
I got this.

497
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:12,666
Ma'am...

498
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:15,907
...could you say who
his associates are?

499
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,516
Yeah. They're all scumbags.
You could try Louise.

500
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:22,775
And Louise is...?

501
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:24,247
A whore. She's a whore.

502
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,483
Good. Whores.

503
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:30,181
Scumbags and whores. Great.
Thank you. You've been a lot of help.

504
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,552
If you find him...

505
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:35,524
...tell him he owes me child support,
alimony and dental bills.

506
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:40,993
Tell him I hope his diddly turns black
and falls in the crapper.

507
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:46,272
It's the prince.

508
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:56,281
You guys looking for my dad?

509
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:59,016
Yeah. We're on a quest man,
Prince Jimmy!

510
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,376
I'm Frankie.

511
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,777
Are you guys bounty hunters?

512
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,682
cuz I'll help you find him
if you split the reward with me.

513
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,858
- Know where we can find him?
-Hell No.

514
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,155
I haven't seen him for 6 months.

515
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,630
My Mama says he's gotta pay
for my braces...

516
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,390
...otherwise they're gonna
repossess them.

517
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,298
Nice.

518
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:22,734
My research Confirms he has atleast three kids...

519
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:26,635
...two illegitimate, two wives
and has filed for bankruptcy 3 times.

520
00:37:26,842 --> 00:37:30,403
This doesn't make any sense!
Jimmy King wouldn't do that stuff!

521
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,204
It's a conspiracy, all right?

522
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:36,884
Sleazy Sinclair, he set up King to make him
lose face in front of his own family.

523
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:40,054
And I found his parents.
Maybe they can help.

524
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:42,086
Kid's wasted his entire life.

525
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:44,254
Wrestling.

526
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,950
He could have been a doctor.

527
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:52,864
Well, an ambulance driver, at least.

528
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:55,432
Jimmy was never very bright.

529
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:57,227
Left school in 10th grade.

530
00:37:57,503 --> 00:37:59,027
I beg to differ.

531
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,333
According to his authorized biography,
Jimmy King worked very hard in high school.

532
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:08,875
And after you died in a plane crash,
he went to community college.

533
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,708
And he supported you
while he held two jobs.

534
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,883
I ought to kick your ass, freak!

535
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,384
We saw him last week.

536
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,156
He came and "borrowed" our motor home.

537
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:26,795
We haven't seen him since.
The big shit!

538
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:31,226
Yes. Jimmy King received a speeding
ticket, driving a motor home.

539
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:34,629
He gave them an address.
St. Francis Motor Court.

540
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:37,836
- Space 14.
- Get off the phone, you pussy!

541
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:41,573
I gotta go. My dad says yakking
on the phone is for pussies.

542
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:04,893
Let's get outta here. That's not the King,
just some weird lady.

543
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:06,190
Oh, my God.

544
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:09,301
That's her.

545
00:39:10,169 --> 00:39:12,796
I mean, that's him. That's the King.

546
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,639
Are you telling me the King's a queen?

547
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:24,806
There's gotta be an explanation. there has to be,
But we came all this way.

548
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:26,716
He needs us.

549
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,381
It's another plot. A "rouge."

550
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:37,055
- King! Jimmy King?
- Yeah, baby.

551
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:39,721
Jimmy King!

552
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,262
- Who's there? Who's there?
- It's us.

553
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,329
The nice boys from the pharmacy.

554
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:56,666
Leave my husband's medicine on the top
step. I'll tip you next time...

555
00:39:56,909 --> 00:40:00,675
- No, no. No pharmacy.
- We're your most loyal "surgeons."

556
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,938
- Wat's the matter with you? Why are you doing this?
- It's us man!

557
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:06,049
- Why are you dressed like a chick?
- Give me the stuff or I'll crown you!

558
00:40:06,218 --> 00:40:08,880
- It's him!
- It's him! King!

559
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:10,145
Jimmy King!

560
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:12,885
We're your biggest fans.

561
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:15,819
- You're fans?
- Yeah.

562
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:20,161
I ought to break your geeky necks.

563
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:23,565
We're on a quest
to restore your throne!

564
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:26,327
- We believe in you, Jimmy King!
- Piss off!

565
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:30,302
There's hope.

566
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:33,509
See, he's got some fight left in him.

567
00:40:33,877 --> 00:40:37,437
Could we come in? Mr.King Five minutes, Five minutes
is all we ask of the King.

568
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:38,702
Please?

569
00:40:39,081 --> 00:40:40,981
How much money you got?

570
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,646
- Thirty dollars.
- Show it to me.

571
00:40:53,794 --> 00:40:55,318
Personal appearance fee.

572
00:40:55,595 --> 00:40:58,189
Thirty dollars, five minutes. Enter!

573
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,263
- You were right.
- I told you.

574
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,138
Things happen for a reason.

575
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,785
It's a conspiracy. We know
this isn't you. You're our king.

576
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:27,120
This is a disguise. I'm hiding out
from a couple of people.

577
00:41:27,323 --> 00:41:29,416
You're hiding out from Sinclair.

578
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,726
I ain't scared of that circus freak.

579
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:34,791
You understand me?

580
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:38,557
I made that league and he knows it.
I put the butts in the seats.

581
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,562
- I know.
- He's done exploiting me...

582
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:45,670
...so he plots a massacre with his
sissies and kicks me out for good.

583
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:47,966
- That's so unjust.
- That sucks.

584
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:51,906
It's not like the rest of my life
been a bowl of cherries either.

585
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,982
But I just try and play
the cards that's dealt me.

586
00:41:58,052 --> 00:42:00,043
Keep my chin up.

587
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:04,247
Even though my wife just left me...

588
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:08,055
...and my little boy's
confined to a wheelchair.

589
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:12,063
And my mommy and daddy just passed.

590
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:16,034
We met your wife.

591
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:19,832
And she says that you left her.

592
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,704
Not how I remember it.

593
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,170
And your son's not in a wheelchair.

594
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,607
Your parents aren't dead anymore.

595
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:33,845
Good Lord! I am blessed!

596
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,779
Praise Him, in all His mercies!

597
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:39,546
Piss off! Five minutes are up.
Get out!

598
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:41,621
Wait.

599
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:43,255
- Get out!
- Wait, wait.

600
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,016
Can we do something for you?

601
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,162
We can go on a beer run, right?
We can go on a beer run for you.

602
00:42:49,364 --> 00:42:50,854
Beer is good. Beer.

603
00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:56,901
Get me two sixes.

604
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:03,002
You try and skip out with my money,
I'm gonna find you...

605
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:05,970
"I will find you..."

606
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,438
"I will find you" and...?

607
00:43:11,616 --> 00:43:13,607
- "I will rule you!"
- Yeah.

608
00:43:14,252 --> 00:43:16,516
Give us a "rule you," please?

609
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:18,187
- Wait, no.
- Come on!

610
00:43:18,422 --> 00:43:20,322
Give us a "begone."

611
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:22,492
Yeah, please?

612
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:23,819
How about this

613
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:26,326
Go get my damn beer,
you frigging morons!

614
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,665
- How are we gonna get back to Lusk?
- What do you mean?

615
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:36,032
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

616
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,140
Drunk Jimmy King in a dress.
We're out of here.

617
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:42,140
Wait, no, no. Sean, we can't.

618
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:44,437
He needs us now more than ever.

619
00:43:46,048 --> 00:43:47,140
My hope...

620
00:43:47,382 --> 00:43:52,080
...is that you two figured out that
I ain't the fella you came to see.

621
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:55,653
It's been a pleasure sitting with you.

622
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,222
Thank you for getting me
two boxes of beer.

623
00:43:59,426 --> 00:44:01,155
Shut the door on your way out.

624
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:03,659
I know what's going on here.

625
00:44:03,897 --> 00:44:06,058
You need to get back into the ring.

626
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:07,494
Never happen.

627
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,399
Sinclair created and owns
my character. It's over. Cheers.

628
00:44:12,605 --> 00:44:15,130
Sinclair?
So what? You're the King.

629
00:44:15,941 --> 00:44:17,805
You can beat anyone.

630
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:23,042
- Beat anyone?
- Yeah.

631
00:44:24,282 --> 00:44:25,908
Y'all know it's just a show?

632
00:44:26,517 --> 00:44:28,041
Best show in the world.

633
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:30,185
It's like dancing, you know?

634
00:44:30,787 --> 00:44:33,311
- It's a circus show with dancing.
- Right.

635
00:44:33,556 --> 00:44:34,955
- Dancing clowns.
- We got you.

636
00:44:35,124 --> 00:44:36,216
Honk, honk.

637
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:38,793
A little soap opera thrown in.

638
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:42,293
This clown just got fired, that's all.
No more wrestling.

639
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:47,867
Listen to me, you dumbshits!

640
00:44:48,036 --> 00:44:50,663
I ain't no king!
There never was no king!

641
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:55,308
The King is a fake creation.
I ain't a has-been. I'm a never-was.

642
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,910
You got it, stupid?

643
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,605
Now, get the hell out of my house!
I'm done with you. Get out!

644
00:45:03,017 --> 00:45:04,006
Come on.

645
00:45:06,153 --> 00:45:07,585
Get. Get out.

646
00:45:17,362 --> 00:45:18,920
Know what I don't get?

647
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:23,025
How can you be phony
if we believe in you?

648
00:45:25,168 --> 00:45:29,002
We need you, King.
Your fans need you.

649
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:32,901
We need you to rise above this
and take Sinclair down.

650
00:45:33,642 --> 00:45:36,509
I wouldn't mind taking a swing
at that turd bump.

651
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:41,080
That's what we're talking about.
You'll get as many swings as you want.

652
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:43,682
I'm a little banged up.
I don't know.

653
00:45:43,918 --> 00:45:47,217
Oh, please! You fought
with a broken back before.

654
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:51,414
You were paralyzed, you hopped out
of a wheelchair and whupped Canyon!

655
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:55,990
Sting broke six bones
in your neck with a bat.

656
00:45:56,163 --> 00:45:58,357
In two weeks, you came back and ruled!

657
00:45:59,231 --> 00:46:02,325
- Come on!
- Come on, man! This is nothing!

658
00:46:03,703 --> 00:46:05,102
What's the matter?

659
00:46:06,538 --> 00:46:08,130
Come on! This is nothing!

660
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,169
- Let go!
- Show us some of that old King!

661
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:13,674
- Let go or...
- Or what? Or what?

662
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:17,304
Or I will rule you!

663
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:32,025
Crown us!

664
00:46:32,228 --> 00:46:33,252
Crown us, come on!

665
00:46:33,496 --> 00:46:35,987
- Please, crown us!
- Crown us!

666
00:46:38,067 --> 00:46:40,557
That was great, man!

667
00:46:40,802 --> 00:46:42,326
You happy now?

668
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:54,138
Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey.

669
00:46:55,483 --> 00:46:56,972
- Guess what?
- What?

670
00:46:57,283 --> 00:47:01,219
Taking you up on your offer to get
one good swing at Titus Sinclair.

671
00:47:01,421 --> 00:47:03,218
You're gonna pound Sinclair?

672
00:47:04,257 --> 00:47:06,781
Oh, yeah. I'm driving first leg.

673
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:48,055
Here tonight, in a hard-core match...

674
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,160
...Sid Vicious is gonna
be locking up with Sting.

675
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:55,495
Plus in his very first title offense,
Diamond Dallas Page...

676
00:47:55,736 --> 00:47:59,763
...faces none other than the Disco
Inferno. Should be interesting.

677
00:48:02,242 --> 00:48:03,300
Out of the way!

678
00:48:03,844 --> 00:48:06,073
- Excuse us!
- Smells like poop in here.

679
00:48:06,446 --> 00:48:08,243
We're almost in position.

680
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:11,575
When we have access to Sinclair,
Gordie will call.

681
00:48:16,788 --> 00:48:20,019
When you hear that, jump out
and we'll have our meeting.

682
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:23,484
Sit tight, King.

683
00:48:23,728 --> 00:48:26,891
Have you back on that throne
in no time. Come on.

684
00:48:32,302 --> 00:48:33,929
Here, girls.
Here, here, here.

685
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,637
Oh, my goodness!

686
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:38,432
- Look!
- Naked things.

687
00:48:42,144 --> 00:48:44,203
The naked, naked things.

688
00:48:47,014 --> 00:48:50,108
- All the naked things.
- Naked. Naked.

689
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:53,577
Oh, extra-naked.

690
00:49:01,194 --> 00:49:02,593
Excuse me.

691
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:03,795
Boys.

692
00:49:04,864 --> 00:49:05,956
Can I help you?

693
00:49:06,232 --> 00:49:08,826
No. We were just
checking out your breasts.

694
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:12,861
We're checking the pipes in the wall.

695
00:49:13,105 --> 00:49:15,573
See, they're round and large.

696
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,174
Well, thanks.

697
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:26,181
That was Sasha. Perhaps the
Nitro-est Nitro Girl of them all.

698
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,226
Mr. Page? Got 60 seconds.

699
00:49:39,462 --> 00:49:43,922
I want to start tight on the belt,
then reveal us, pulling back.

700
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,656
About time you put it on me.

701
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:47,869
Anybody's better than Jimmy King.

702
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,595
Ungrateful tub of lard,
that's what he was.

703
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,569
I know that. You know that.

704
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:57,209
I don't get what
these kids dig about him.

705
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:00,706
Let me tell you about these kids.
They're morons.

706
00:50:00,948 --> 00:50:02,812
They love who I tell them to.

707
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:07,578
"I'm Jimmy King! I will rule you!

708
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:09,914
I will reign supreme!

709
00:50:10,622 --> 00:50:13,750
As soon as I finish
these here beers."

710
00:50:14,293 --> 00:50:15,260
Funny?

711
00:50:15,527 --> 00:50:16,926
Let's roll. We'll do it.

712
00:50:17,162 --> 00:50:20,255
Five. Four. Three. Two.

713
00:50:21,499 --> 00:50:24,662
Page, what do you really feel
about Jimmy King?

714
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:26,426
Yo, snapper-head, up here!

715
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:30,461
Jimmy King, he doesn't know
a wristlock from a wristwatch.

716
00:50:30,674 --> 00:50:32,869
As far as being
in shape is concerned...

717
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:37,010
...that boy was so out of shape,
in the ring it was like fighting...

718
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:39,839
...a harpooned whale.

719
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:42,040
That's sweet, man. What a bum.

720
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,616
Jimmy King is not a...

721
00:50:44,987 --> 00:50:46,614
I ain't no damn bum!

722
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:56,359
King's not in the script!

723
00:51:11,544 --> 00:51:12,602
Foreign object!

724
00:51:19,684 --> 00:51:21,948
Fatty just made you
his shithouse bitch!

725
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:28,923
Who are you guys?

726
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:31,093
- We're fans!
- Jimmy King's, asshole!

727
00:51:31,328 --> 00:51:33,387
Get them off of me!

728
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:47,976
King!

729
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:52,775
Is that all you got?

730
00:52:02,522 --> 00:52:04,820
- Do your job! Do your job!
- You went down!

731
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:08,022
One. Two. Three.

732
00:52:08,296 --> 00:52:10,661
The winner by pinfall, Jimmy King!

733
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:12,621
it appear We have a new world champion!

734
00:52:12,832 --> 00:52:14,800
Jimmy King rules!

735
00:52:17,937 --> 00:52:18,961
No!

736
00:52:19,705 --> 00:52:21,138
That was unsanctioned!

737
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:25,537
And per the bylaws of the WCW,
that belt cannot be passed.

738
00:52:25,777 --> 00:52:29,770
- You give me what's mine, you slimey ass freak!
- You can't win by ambushing your opponent.

739
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,814
- Any match, anytime, baby!
- You heard him. sinclair

740
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:35,075
Any match, anytime!

741
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,082
You want a match, you got one match.

742
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,619
- One match, you name it!
- The steel cage.

743
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,154
Steel cage? Done! When?

744
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:46,293
- He doesn't even have to win.
- He's not gonna win.

745
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:50,326
- No, he's gonna win.
- All you have to do is survive.

746
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:54,934
You survive and you get this belt.

747
00:52:56,371 --> 00:52:57,531
Plus $1 million!

748
00:52:58,373 --> 00:52:59,862
But if he loses...

749
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:04,132
...you forfeit your crown
and never be able to wrestle again.

750
00:53:04,411 --> 00:53:06,538
- It's a deal!
- You got a match, baby!

751
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,304
Hold on, baby. Hold the damn phones.

752
00:53:09,983 --> 00:53:12,247
Ladies and gentlemen,
you heard it here.

753
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:16,944
A new first. Four weeks from tonight,
MGM Grand, pay-per-view.

754
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:21,057
- Be there!
- We're gonna reign supreme!

755
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:25,261
- Good, save it! Save that emotion!
- Save it!

756
00:53:25,496 --> 00:53:27,464
Tonight we rejoice! We rejoice!

757
00:53:27,665 --> 00:53:30,429
- With the King in his motor castle!
- Party!

758
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,838
Sasha.

759
00:53:45,415 --> 00:53:46,382
Oh, my God.

760
00:53:50,285 --> 00:53:51,217
I'm Gordie.

761
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,845
I saw you in that brawl tonight.

762
00:53:54,623 --> 00:53:56,284
Pretty awesome.

763
00:53:59,794 --> 00:54:00,988
Got a beer?

764
00:54:03,231 --> 00:54:05,199
- Dick!
- Thanks.

765
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:09,399
I got your poster up in my room.

766
00:54:09,636 --> 00:54:10,603
Really?

767
00:54:11,238 --> 00:54:12,034
Which one?

768
00:54:12,305 --> 00:54:13,363
Is it...

769
00:54:14,641 --> 00:54:16,631
...this one? Or wait.

770
00:54:18,944 --> 00:54:21,378
- That one?
- No, it's this one.

771
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:27,246
- That's my favorite.
- Me too!

772
00:54:29,087 --> 00:54:30,714
You're really sweet.

773
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,255
And masculine.

774
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:37,085
I really like how
you stood up to Sinclair.

775
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:39,886
We did it for that guy right there.

776
00:54:41,564 --> 00:54:42,792
Isn't he the best?

777
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:45,263
He's the best. There's no better.

778
00:54:47,103 --> 00:54:51,266
Growing up in Cody, Wyoming,
I lived to watch Jimmy King fight.

779
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,599
You're from Cody? No way!

780
00:54:53,842 --> 00:54:56,606
- I'm from Lusk!
- Really?

781
00:54:56,845 --> 00:54:57,833
Oh, my God!

782
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,747
You wanna dance?

783
00:55:23,035 --> 00:55:25,196
Do people think I'm sexy?

784
00:55:25,871 --> 00:55:29,170
I think you're sexy, Gene.
Really I do.

785
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:36,977
But right now, I'm gonna train
for this freaking death match, baby.

786
00:55:37,482 --> 00:55:41,315
A little pure protein,
send me on my way.

787
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:54,620
No goddamn way, baby!

788
00:56:10,894 --> 00:56:11,861
Oh, my God.

789
00:56:13,765 --> 00:56:15,528
How'd you know
where to find him?

790
00:56:16,403 --> 00:56:18,065
We're in the business.

791
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:21,638
Found him in drainage tunnel 14.
He didn't want to leave.

792
00:56:22,114 --> 00:56:23,877
We'll take care of him from here.

793
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:25,311
Good luck.

794
00:56:26,756 --> 00:56:28,053
Do your magic.

795
00:56:30,061 --> 00:56:32,530
You cannot run away.

796
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,032
You got a fight,
major responsibilities.

797
00:56:35,306 --> 00:56:36,671
I got news for you.

798
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,709
I sucker-punched Page last night.
It was a fluke!

799
00:56:39,914 --> 00:56:41,609
How can you say that?

800
00:56:42,051 --> 00:56:43,609
We got you this far!

801
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,883
We're gonna get you a trainer.

802
00:56:47,327 --> 00:56:48,693
Trainer?

803
00:56:49,431 --> 00:56:52,457
I don't need a trainer.
I need a safe house, baby.

804
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:55,867
Or a new identity from the FBI.
Or a fast car.

805
00:56:56,543 --> 00:57:00,844
Jimmy King is not scared.
Jimmy King does not back down.

806
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,348
Don't you get it?

807
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:06,047
Sinclair wants to kill me.
End my life.

808
00:57:06,362 --> 00:57:11,266
So I'm dead and buried in the ground.
Little tiny bugs feasting on my ass.

809
00:57:11,504 --> 00:57:13,802
No bugs are gonna feast on your ass!

810
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:17,809
You'll win the money and get
your belt back. That's our mission.

811
00:57:18,885 --> 00:57:20,648
I'm scared, baby. I'm scared.

812
00:57:21,155 --> 00:57:24,125
We can help. Sean, sing the song.

813
00:57:24,562 --> 00:57:25,688
I don't want to sing.

814
00:57:25,897 --> 00:57:29,265
Sing the song for Mr. King! Come on.

815
00:57:32,677 --> 00:57:35,840
Jimmy King is the best wrestler

816
00:57:36,082 --> 00:57:37,744
He's the best-ler

817
00:57:37,953 --> 00:57:40,513
Better than all the rest-ler

818
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,487
- He's got class
- He's really fast

819
00:57:42,728 --> 00:57:46,130
- He'll rule ass
- He'll rule that ass

820
00:57:47,337 --> 00:57:51,001
Jimmy, Jimmy King

821
00:57:51,244 --> 00:57:53,508
- It's not done.
- We're still working on it.

822
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,821
Where are you taking me?

823
00:58:00,027 --> 00:58:02,325
It's a surprise. Don't worry.

824
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,044
Hello?

825
00:58:13,451 --> 00:58:15,078
What the hell is that, baby?

826
00:58:26,242 --> 00:58:29,212
I got three words for you, baby,
9-1-1.

827
00:58:34,724 --> 00:58:35,748
Stifle!

828
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,181
Sal Bandini.

829
00:58:50,418 --> 00:58:51,909
Wanna wrestle?

830
00:58:52,155 --> 00:58:52,951
Sal Bandini?

831
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:55,520
This is an honor...

832
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:02,162
Tap out, son.

833
00:59:05,947 --> 00:59:07,972
This is who you called about?

834
00:59:08,552 --> 00:59:09,484
I've seen you.

835
00:59:10,222 --> 00:59:13,351
You're big, tough. You don't
know shit about wrestling.

836
00:59:13,628 --> 00:59:17,064
Always worried, what,
about TV time and endorsements?

837
00:59:17,301 --> 00:59:19,236
- Well...
- Stifle. You talk too much.

838
00:59:19,438 --> 00:59:21,907
Mr. Bandini, he's ready
to listen and learn.

839
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:26,275
Good. I'm just finishing up with
the local high school wrestling team.

840
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:30,252
All right, whackers, go home.

841
00:59:30,492 --> 00:59:31,959
You did real good today.

842
00:59:32,162 --> 00:59:34,357
But remember what I told you.

843
00:59:34,632 --> 00:59:38,034
Apply pressure until
you hear cartilage snap...

844
00:59:38,272 --> 00:59:41,037
...or they crap in their pants.
Come on, wuss, move it!

845
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,645
And you, work on that for tomorrow!

846
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:47,417
Gentlemen, step into my office.

847
00:59:48,758 --> 00:59:50,055
Just take it easy.

848
00:59:50,694 --> 00:59:51,991
Come on, Jimmy.

849
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,062
Show me one of your fancy moves.

850
00:59:57,474 --> 00:59:58,441
Come on, King.

851
01:00:01,782 --> 01:00:04,376
- That's not good.
- Come on. It's embarrassing.

852
01:00:06,858 --> 01:00:09,520
Tap out, punk.
I seen you favor that leg.

853
01:00:09,796 --> 01:00:12,231
Lesson one
Never reveal your weaknesses.

854
01:00:12,802 --> 01:00:14,030
Bite me, old man.

855
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:15,295
Right spirit.

856
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,599
Wrong old man to be messing with.

857
01:00:17,878 --> 01:00:18,846
Tap out.

858
01:00:27,463 --> 01:00:29,523
You kicked him in the face, King.

859
01:00:29,802 --> 01:00:31,998
The crazy old bastard was
gonna kill me.

860
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:33,570
I think you killed him.

861
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:34,809
What?

862
01:00:35,144 --> 01:00:37,204
How hard did you hit him?
He's an old man!

863
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:38,940
Only gave him a little flick.

864
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:41,553
No, you kicked him in the face.

865
01:00:44,428 --> 01:00:46,795
Sal, you all right?
You all right, baby?

866
01:00:53,746 --> 01:00:55,339
You know, kicking me was right.

867
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,348
Seeing if I was okay is wrong.

868
01:00:58,156 --> 01:01:02,959
Lesson one: The possum ain't dead
till it's scraped off the road.

869
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:04,759
It's treachery.

870
01:01:05,238 --> 01:01:07,002
Did you have to squash
the possum's nuts?

871
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,266
Stifle.

872
01:01:13,988 --> 01:01:15,957
Buenos nachos, señorita.

873
01:01:16,826 --> 01:01:18,726
I didn't know you spoke Spanish.

874
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,826
Yeah, I took it in high school.

875
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:22,195
A bunch of times.

876
01:01:23,605 --> 01:01:25,005
Are you fluent?

877
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:28,201
No. I feel fine.

878
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,348
Got something for you.

879
01:01:35,061 --> 01:01:36,494
Thanks.

880
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:40,762
Flower guy was closed,
so I picked those up for you.

881
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:42,040
Great.

882
01:01:42,843 --> 01:01:43,935
Come on in.

883
01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:48,113
Candles and food and everything.

884
01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:50,015
Yeah. I figured, why go out?

885
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,393
We can stay in.

886
01:02:01,012 --> 01:02:03,139
So how's training going?

887
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:05,111
Pretty good.

888
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:09,582
Got him a coach, he's starting
to listen. Things are looking up.

889
01:02:10,129 --> 01:02:12,029
A coach? Really?

890
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:13,495
Do I know him?

891
01:02:15,573 --> 01:02:17,201
Sal Bandini. You heard of him?

892
01:02:18,846 --> 01:02:20,643
No, I don't think I know him.

893
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,440
He's old school.

894
01:02:23,355 --> 01:02:24,549
Yeah, he's a real pro.

895
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:27,257
Kind of been training alongside him...

896
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:30,956
...so picking up some really,
really awesome moves.

897
01:02:31,606 --> 01:02:33,597
Awesome moves, huh?

898
01:02:36,113 --> 01:02:38,707
I'd love you to show me
your awesome moves.

899
01:02:43,762 --> 01:02:45,423
Show me what you got, big boy.

900
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:48,834
Well, I got some moves for you.

901
01:02:52,379 --> 01:02:53,346
Are you sure?

902
01:02:54,282 --> 01:02:55,749
I'm sure.

903
01:03:02,398 --> 01:03:03,456
That was a snap-mare.

904
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:07,904
Take me to the bedroom.

905
01:03:10,514 --> 01:03:13,142
I meant, why don't we wrestle in here?

906
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:14,852
Bedroom match.

907
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,483
I'd love to wrestle you in here.

908
01:03:18,696 --> 01:03:20,163
Give it to me, big boy.

909
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:31,712
I will now unveil my...

910
01:03:31,954 --> 01:03:33,819
...secret weapons.

911
01:03:36,164 --> 01:03:37,529
Foreign objects!

912
01:03:41,507 --> 01:03:42,974
Oh, God!

913
01:03:46,616 --> 01:03:48,982
Dear Dad I am fine.

914
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:54,125
Sean and I are helping Jimmy King
reclaim his lost glory.

915
01:03:55,234 --> 01:03:58,295
King's a good man who just
seems to have lost his way.

916
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,304
Also, Dad, I met this
really, really sweet girl.

917
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,845
And I'm not a virgin anymore.

918
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:07,487
Sorry about missing
the state trooper's exam.

919
01:04:07,724 --> 01:04:11,491
I'm sure there's another one coming up
that you can force me to take.

920
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:22,915
Respectfully, Gordon.

921
01:04:23,722 --> 01:04:27,215
Sweetie, I don't think King needs
any other wrestlers.

922
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:30,194
- I think it's a bad idea.
- You think so, boopie?

923
01:04:30,903 --> 01:04:32,370
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

924
01:04:32,605 --> 01:04:35,006
Boopie thinks it's a bad idea.
We shouldn't do it.

925
01:04:35,245 --> 01:04:37,908
I think that boopie
should keep her mouth shut.

926
01:04:38,183 --> 01:04:40,310
- Don't talk to boopie like that.
- I'm telling you...

927
01:04:40,554 --> 01:04:43,388
...I have a terrible vibe
about this whole thing.

928
01:04:43,628 --> 01:04:47,292
Listen. You need a posse of guys
who are gonna support you.

929
01:04:48,671 --> 01:04:50,765
There he is. Come on.

930
01:04:54,715 --> 01:04:57,617
Oh, hey, Big Bill!
Goldberg, what are you doing?

931
01:04:57,854 --> 01:05:00,551
I didn't know you were in town.
You're looking good.

932
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:03,161
What's going on? Why are you here?

933
01:05:03,398 --> 01:05:05,026
I'm doing Letterman.

934
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:08,296
What are you doing here?
Preparing for your execution?

935
01:05:10,612 --> 01:05:12,604
- You think I have no chance?
- Get real.

936
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,183
Sinclair's pissed off,
and he'll make an example out of you.

937
01:05:16,422 --> 01:05:19,654
Face it. You're a second-rate
wrestler and a third-rate man.

938
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:22,525
You're still sore about
that spot I blew in Akron.

939
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:24,125
You were drunk.

940
01:05:24,372 --> 01:05:27,365
I'm sorry. I was having
terrible back spasms that day.

941
01:05:27,611 --> 01:05:28,635
You puked on me.

942
01:05:28,879 --> 01:05:30,609
The audience liked it.

943
01:05:30,851 --> 01:05:31,840
I was your partner!

944
01:05:34,256 --> 01:05:37,055
I made you. If it wasn't for me,
you'd be nothing.

945
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:38,217
Yeah?

946
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,089
Damn.

947
01:05:41,636 --> 01:05:44,538
Mr. Goldberg, that was a nice throw.
How you doing?

948
01:05:44,742 --> 01:05:47,678
We represent Mr. King
in his upcoming pay-per-view.

949
01:05:47,915 --> 01:05:50,850
You are the mack. You are it, man!

950
01:05:51,087 --> 01:05:52,988
His majesty needs you in the corner.

951
01:05:53,224 --> 01:05:56,125
Look, I used to look up to Jimmy
just like you two.

952
01:05:56,631 --> 01:05:59,429
But the fact is, he let me down.

953
01:05:59,669 --> 01:06:02,332
I know. I know. King lost his way.

954
01:06:02,574 --> 01:06:04,906
But he has seen the light.
He's a changed man.

955
01:06:05,145 --> 01:06:06,511
The change is coming!

956
01:06:06,749 --> 01:06:08,477
Please, for a second...?

957
01:06:09,151 --> 01:06:11,780
Whatever's happened in the past
is the past.

958
01:06:12,024 --> 01:06:14,255
But ultimately,
he's your friend, right?

959
01:06:14,495 --> 01:06:18,261
And you can't turn your back
on a friend. Right?

960
01:06:18,703 --> 01:06:22,195
Sorry, guys.
The fact is, I work alone.

961
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:05,717
That's him.

962
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:21,810
Sal Bandini. Want to wrestle?

963
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:40,407
Who's your daddy, bitch?

964
01:07:40,953 --> 01:07:41,921
Who sent you?

965
01:07:42,155 --> 01:07:43,850
Sinclair.

966
01:07:44,793 --> 01:07:47,092
He wants you to stay away from King.

967
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:50,129
You tell your boss
I'll train whoever I want.

968
01:08:01,357 --> 01:08:03,382
I'm so sorry, Gordie.

969
01:08:03,895 --> 01:08:05,863
It's not your fault, Sasha.

970
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:07,759
Poor Sal.

971
01:08:09,505 --> 01:08:11,370
Mr. Bandini's a tough old man.

972
01:08:11,876 --> 01:08:15,210
But he'll have to stay here a while.
He's got multiple injuries.

973
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:18,379
Any questions?

974
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:19,988
- Can we see him?
- Sure.

975
01:08:21,126 --> 01:08:22,890
I'm gonna get him a Butterfinger.

976
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:25,394
I have to use the little girls' room.

977
01:08:31,914 --> 01:08:33,779
Can I have a Butterfinger too?

978
01:08:38,224 --> 01:08:39,192
It's over.

979
01:08:39,427 --> 01:08:40,416
It's done.

980
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:42,527
Now can I please get out of here?

981
01:08:43,066 --> 01:08:45,228
Sasha, take it easy.
You did good.

982
01:08:45,572 --> 01:08:48,406
Titus, I'm wasting my time
at the hospital.

983
01:08:48,678 --> 01:08:51,545
Poor guy should be in the morgue
after what you guys did.

984
01:08:53,052 --> 01:08:54,280
Who do you wuv?

985
01:08:55,322 --> 01:08:57,120
I wuv you.

986
01:08:59,196 --> 01:09:01,825
Now, please, just get me out of here.

987
01:09:02,068 --> 01:09:04,935
Bandini guy's like
100 years old, anyway.

988
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:06,300
105.

989
01:09:07,077 --> 01:09:10,206
But tell that to
Saturn and Sid Vicious over here.

990
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,712
Morons.

991
01:09:13,388 --> 01:09:14,754
You did great.

992
01:09:14,992 --> 01:09:18,929
So how does head Nitro Girl sound?

993
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:21,294
My balls are in my throat...

994
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:24,863
...my prostate is the size
of a melon...

995
01:09:25,243 --> 01:09:27,838
...and I'm crapping tapioca.

996
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:30,646
I feel like a kid again.

997
01:09:33,058 --> 01:09:35,424
Don't worry about me.
Sit down. Sit down.

998
01:09:39,369 --> 01:09:40,166
Listen to me.

999
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:42,566
And this is the final lesson.

1000
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:46,376
Always attack a man's strengths.

1001
01:09:47,084 --> 01:09:48,847
I think he means weaknesses.

1002
01:09:49,355 --> 01:09:50,788
No, I mean strengths.

1003
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:55,257
No one ever expects you to attack
the strongest part of the fort.

1004
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,164
Up the middle.

1005
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:59,371
That's where the action is.

1006
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:01,273
And it's the same in life.

1007
01:10:02,312 --> 01:10:04,405
Look, I know you got demons.

1008
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:06,248
But don't run away.

1009
01:10:06,487 --> 01:10:10,048
Attack them head on as
they're coming to you full speed.

1010
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:12,421
Because that, my friend...

1011
01:10:12,631 --> 01:10:14,428
...is living.

1012
01:10:18,475 --> 01:10:20,501
Got something for you, Sal.

1013
01:10:21,113 --> 01:10:22,239
My favorite!

1014
01:10:22,982 --> 01:10:25,747
- Thank you.
- Can we do anything for you?

1015
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,951
Get out of town.

1016
01:10:28,594 --> 01:10:31,085
This place is no good for a wrestler.

1017
01:10:31,331 --> 01:10:32,890
Get back to basics.

1018
01:10:33,503 --> 01:10:34,936
I know a place we can do that.

1019
01:10:38,912 --> 01:10:40,379
Oh, man!

1020
01:10:40,615 --> 01:10:42,641
This town turned my head around.

1021
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:45,587
Forgot our mission,
what was important.

1022
01:10:45,924 --> 01:10:49,918
You know what? I'll do what it takes
from here on out to get the job done.

1023
01:10:50,165 --> 01:10:52,430
Yes, you are. And I am too.

1024
01:10:54,373 --> 01:10:56,137
We're gonna get you that belt back.

1025
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,140
Man, I don't know, baby.

1026
01:10:58,547 --> 01:10:59,515
What?

1027
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,017
What?

1028
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,148
What's the matter?
What did Sal just say?

1029
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:06,223
It's about what's in here!

1030
01:11:08,065 --> 01:11:09,191
Dude...

1031
01:11:09,968 --> 01:11:12,665
...you just crushed
my Butterfinger, baby.

1032
01:11:13,442 --> 01:11:14,932
Butterfinger?!

1033
01:11:15,178 --> 01:11:17,079
Get in the van now, okay?

1034
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:18,442
Sorry.

1035
01:11:19,587 --> 01:11:22,113
Sorry, I had to make a call.

1036
01:11:22,559 --> 01:11:23,856
How's Sal?

1037
01:11:24,094 --> 01:11:26,188
- He's gonna make it.
- Oh, good.

1038
01:11:29,237 --> 01:11:31,399
That's more than I can say for us.

1039
01:11:32,109 --> 01:11:33,235
What's going on?

1040
01:11:33,845 --> 01:11:35,643
We're going back to basics.

1041
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:37,180
To find our heart.

1042
01:11:37,552 --> 01:11:38,541
Well, can I come?

1043
01:11:39,289 --> 01:11:41,849
No. Because you don't have one.

1044
01:12:09,344 --> 01:12:11,574
I can't believe I met Goldberg.

1045
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:14,176
That's cool, you know?

1046
01:12:18,862 --> 01:12:21,387
I know you don't wanna talk
about your fallout...

1047
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:22,965
You're right. I don't.

1048
01:12:23,202 --> 01:12:26,069
- Look, I just...
- Mind your own business, all right?

1049
01:12:30,816 --> 01:12:31,909
Where we going, King?

1050
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:34,120
There's something I gotta do.

1051
01:12:40,602 --> 01:12:42,126
Hello, Eugenia.

1052
01:12:42,839 --> 01:12:43,863
Jimmy King.

1053
01:12:47,146 --> 01:12:49,138
You are a bastard!

1054
01:12:52,255 --> 01:12:53,484
Let me help you up.

1055
01:12:55,027 --> 01:12:56,392
I guess I deserved that.

1056
01:12:58,233 --> 01:13:00,531
I just had to kick you
in the diddly again.

1057
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:04,676
Jesus!

1058
01:13:04,878 --> 01:13:07,177
Oh, the humanity. Make it stop.

1059
01:13:10,857 --> 01:13:12,290
How's your diddly?

1060
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,493
Hope I broke it.

1061
01:13:14,696 --> 01:13:16,631
It's definitely bruised.

1062
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:19,793
What the hell you thinking,
coming back here?

1063
01:13:20,306 --> 01:13:21,432
I'm not exactly sure.

1064
01:13:21,642 --> 01:13:24,077
I think that the King
is ready to be a man.

1065
01:13:24,715 --> 01:13:26,615
Well, how does it feel?

1066
01:13:27,385 --> 01:13:30,913
Like Richard Petty ran a stock car
into my balls...

1067
01:13:31,193 --> 01:13:33,162
...going 400 miles an hour.

1068
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,099
Well, look what the rat puked up.

1069
01:13:38,339 --> 01:13:39,636
Oh, Jesus.

1070
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,571
You mean "cat," son, don't you?

1071
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:45,443
I ain't your son.

1072
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,013
Frankie...

1073
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,817
...I came to say I was sorry.

1074
01:13:51,463 --> 01:13:52,725
Too late!

1075
01:13:53,133 --> 01:13:55,329
Jesus, look at that grill!

1076
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,799
I mean, no, son. How you doing?
It's good to see...

1077
01:14:02,149 --> 01:14:04,516
Eugenia, please.

1078
01:14:06,256 --> 01:14:08,657
I'm sorry that I took off on you...

1079
01:14:08,896 --> 01:14:11,160
...when I should've been
taking care of you.

1080
01:14:11,901 --> 01:14:13,665
Really. I'm really sorry.

1081
01:14:15,107 --> 01:14:17,599
You can fry ice in hell, you bastard!

1082
01:14:17,812 --> 01:14:21,749
What's the good in saying you're sorry?
What are you gonna do about it?

1083
01:14:21,987 --> 01:14:22,851
What am I gonna do?

1084
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,993
Well, I'm gonna get that belt back.

1085
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,792
I'm gonna win $1 million.

1086
01:14:31,036 --> 01:14:34,871
I'm gonna pay off all my debts.
I'm gonna do the right thing by you.

1087
01:14:35,176 --> 01:14:36,734
That's what I'm gonna do.

1088
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,388
And by God, I'm gonna get that boy
a damn good dentist.

1089
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:58,072
Yo, Sean!

1090
01:14:59,254 --> 01:15:01,246
Wyoming! We're home, baby.

1091
01:15:02,927 --> 01:15:04,828
We're home, baby. Wyoming.

1092
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:13,753
No place like home.

1093
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:17,040
I can breathe out here.

1094
01:15:28,616 --> 01:15:30,846
Approach the vehicle, son.

1095
01:15:31,935 --> 01:15:33,129
Hi, Dad.

1096
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:34,270
No back talk.

1097
01:15:35,022 --> 01:15:36,081
No excuses.

1098
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:38,198
Just get in the car.

1099
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,811
- What'd he do?
- Nothing.

1100
01:15:52,626 --> 01:15:54,618
You're gonna be a cop, little mister.

1101
01:15:54,863 --> 01:15:58,823
No skimpy outfits,
no touching other men.

1102
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:02,767
But I'm destined for other things.
I'm following my dream.

1103
01:16:02,939 --> 01:16:04,497
Well, your dream is stupid!

1104
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:09,235
Just because it's your dream doesn't
make it right or noble or whatever.

1105
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,814
Charlie Manson was
following his dream.

1106
01:16:12,018 --> 01:16:15,079
Joe Stalin, Michael Bolton...
You get my point?

1107
01:16:36,714 --> 01:16:38,512
That's a 211, breaking and entering.

1108
01:16:40,152 --> 01:16:42,849
Gordie, come on.
We need you, brother. Let's go.

1109
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:47,122
Gordie, we need you, baby.
I need you.

1110
01:16:47,695 --> 01:16:49,492
I need you in my corner, man.

1111
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,989
I need you to help me pick my posse.

1112
01:16:52,883 --> 01:16:54,977
I don't know if I can do this
without you.

1113
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:57,770
- Really?
- Yeah.

1114
01:16:58,007 --> 01:16:58,975
You do?

1115
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,813
I need you to help us go down to Vegas
and rule ass! Let's go!

1116
01:17:03,059 --> 01:17:04,459
Let's begone!

1117
01:17:09,517 --> 01:17:10,541
I can't.

1118
01:17:11,558 --> 01:17:14,221
I gotta study for this cop exam.

1119
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:15,426
My dad...

1120
01:17:20,694 --> 01:17:23,356
It's your dream.
It's your dream. Come on.

1121
01:17:28,098 --> 01:17:29,190
My dream's stupid.

1122
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:36,060
Time for me to get rid of
all this junk.

1123
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:40,795
You know, get rid of all my childish
things. Time for me to grow up.

1124
01:17:46,104 --> 01:17:48,073
We've come all this way.

1125
01:17:49,972 --> 01:17:51,600
Why are you giving up on me now?

1126
01:17:54,411 --> 01:17:55,571
I'm sorry.

1127
01:17:57,148 --> 01:17:58,240
I can't.

1128
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:04,120
You guys better get out of here.

1129
01:18:04,624 --> 01:18:06,285
My dad'll shoot you.

1130
01:18:06,526 --> 01:18:07,652
He will.

1131
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:26,952
Next, please.

1132
01:18:31,591 --> 01:18:34,082
Hell, everybody knows
wrestling's fake.

1133
01:18:40,569 --> 01:18:42,059
That feel fake?

1134
01:18:49,568 --> 01:18:52,936
We are Satan's Siamese twins!

1135
01:18:53,885 --> 01:18:56,376
You guys aren't really
Siamese twins, are you?

1136
01:18:58,758 --> 01:18:59,725
Sorry.

1137
01:19:06,101 --> 01:19:10,505
Oklahoma, where the wind goes
Sweeping down the plains

1138
01:19:10,724 --> 01:19:14,182
Where the waving wheat
Sure smells sweet

1139
01:19:16,013 --> 01:19:18,379
Aren't these the auditions
for Oklahoma?

1140
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:21,916
Oklahoma, okay

1141
01:19:20,786 --> 01:19:22,309
Okay, Dawkins, who's left?

1142
01:19:22,517 --> 01:19:24,577
First, Fireman Fred.

1143
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:28,580
I'm Fireman Fred,
and I'm gonna hose you!

1144
01:19:30,502 --> 01:19:32,767
Those are good, right?

1145
01:19:33,033 --> 01:19:34,728
Next, this is The Chewer.

1146
01:19:42,044 --> 01:19:44,308
Come on. Last, but not least...

1147
01:19:44,795 --> 01:19:46,229
...this is Kitty.

1148
01:19:47,718 --> 01:19:51,917
Hi, darling, I'm afraid we need to
take people who can help us in Vegas.

1149
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,488
My friends, they call me Pretty Kitty.

1150
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:03,137
What's she gonna do,
boob them to death?

1151
01:20:05,573 --> 01:20:07,131
How you feeling, big guy?

1152
01:20:08,477 --> 01:20:10,274
- I feel pretty good.
- Good.

1153
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:12,243
Haven't felt this good in a long time.

1154
01:20:12,482 --> 01:20:14,143
Good. Keep it up.

1155
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:16,717
You ready for Vegas tomorrow?

1156
01:20:16,954 --> 01:20:17,978
Yeah.

1157
01:20:19,156 --> 01:20:20,647
I wish Gordie was coming.

1158
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:22,121
Me too.

1159
01:20:30,871 --> 01:20:31,997
Thank you.

1160
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,299
Thank you.

1161
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:38,647
Thank you very much.

1162
01:20:42,051 --> 01:20:44,384
See you, now. Bye-bye.

1163
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:47,355
Hey, Sean.

1164
01:20:47,627 --> 01:20:49,959
I saw you on TNT.
What was New York like?

1165
01:20:50,162 --> 01:20:51,824
It was good. It was fun.

1166
01:20:52,065 --> 01:20:55,592
You know, but I'm not much
of a big-city fella.

1167
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:58,538
My heart's right here in Lusk.

1168
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:00,172
I'll see you, okay?

1169
01:21:05,915 --> 01:21:07,143
Excuse me.

1170
01:21:08,084 --> 01:21:09,211
Hi, Wendy.

1171
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:13,583
I couldn't stop thinking about
how you were always nice to me.

1172
01:21:14,025 --> 01:21:18,429
And I was thinking I should've been a
lot nicer back. I got you something.

1173
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,066
Thank you, Sean.

1174
01:21:24,739 --> 01:21:25,706
Like it?

1175
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:29,001
It's the greatest.

1176
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,614
I have a gift for you too.

1177
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,278
Come here.

1178
01:21:56,512 --> 01:21:59,141
Really wish I could go with you,
but I can't.

1179
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,209
I'm sorry.

1180
01:22:01,686 --> 01:22:03,517
I feel like I let you down.

1181
01:22:03,854 --> 01:22:06,323
I understand. Really, I do.

1182
01:22:06,527 --> 01:22:08,358
And I want to tell you something.

1183
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:10,496
No matter what happens in Vegas...

1184
01:22:10,698 --> 01:22:13,496
...I can't thank you enough
for what you did for me.

1185
01:22:14,602 --> 01:22:15,796
All right?

1186
01:22:17,473 --> 01:22:19,032
Good luck to you, now.

1187
01:22:23,513 --> 01:22:24,810
You take care of yourself.

1188
01:22:54,018 --> 01:22:55,680
Wait! Stop the car!

1189
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,559
Good luck, King!

1190
01:23:01,294 --> 01:23:02,761
- You all right?
- Totally.

1191
01:23:02,964 --> 01:23:05,626
- I just want to say good luck.
- Thank you.

1192
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:08,099
- I'll see you at the restaurant.
- Definitely.

1193
01:23:11,975 --> 01:23:13,567
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1194
01:23:13,777 --> 01:23:16,440
I'll totally be thinking of you. Bye!

1195
01:23:59,468 --> 01:24:01,937
Listen to me very carefully.

1196
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:07,668
If you plan to have
any future at all...

1197
01:24:07,879 --> 01:24:09,575
...in my business...

1198
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:13,814
...you will not allow Jimmy King...

1199
01:24:14,521 --> 01:24:16,455
...to reach that belt.

1200
01:24:18,092 --> 01:24:19,081
What?

1201
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,319
Excuse me, Mr. Sinclair?
They're ready.

1202
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:22,962
Thank you.

1203
01:24:28,172 --> 01:24:30,767
I will kill you if you fuck this up.

1204
01:24:51,501 --> 01:24:52,662
Looking good, baby.

1205
01:24:53,237 --> 01:24:55,762
Thank you. You're looking good.

1206
01:24:56,507 --> 01:24:57,736
Am I?

1207
01:24:58,343 --> 01:24:59,776
Are you ready?

1208
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:08,379
Hell, yeah.

1209
01:25:11,126 --> 01:25:13,219
Ladies and gentlemen...

1210
01:25:13,395 --> 01:25:17,765
- Why did you drag me here?
- Because he sent the tickets.

1211
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:21,404
And welcome to One-Man Suicide!

1212
01:25:22,105 --> 01:25:25,667
Tonight the WCW belt...

1213
01:25:25,877 --> 01:25:27,641
...is on the line!

1214
01:25:29,149 --> 01:25:33,610
One million dollars is on the line!

1215
01:25:35,056 --> 01:25:37,548
And one man's life...

1216
01:25:38,193 --> 01:25:41,357
...is on the line!

1217
01:25:46,137 --> 01:25:47,434
Jimmy King!

1218
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,106
You want the belt?

1219
01:25:50,743 --> 01:25:53,109
Come on down and get it!

1220
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:59,249
It's on top of the cage of death.

1221
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,511
Which is on top of another cage.

1222
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:07,288
Which is yet on top of another cage!

1223
01:26:11,402 --> 01:26:12,700
Three cages...

1224
01:26:13,772 --> 01:26:15,467
...two warriors...

1225
01:26:16,476 --> 01:26:18,034
...one belt.

1226
01:26:18,778 --> 01:26:20,143
Triple cage.

1227
01:26:20,614 --> 01:26:23,139
Come on down.

1228
01:26:27,289 --> 01:26:29,622
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time...

1229
01:26:30,025 --> 01:26:34,429
...for the WCW Royal Bash main event...

1230
01:26:34,965 --> 01:26:39,403
...for the Heavyweight Championship
of the World!

1231
01:26:42,241 --> 01:26:45,210
Coming to the ring first,
from Marietta, Georgia...

1232
01:26:45,377 --> 01:26:48,074
Okay, baby, triple cage.

1233
01:26:48,314 --> 01:26:51,842
You watch my back.
Keep that posse on standby.

1234
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:55,249
Jimmy King!

1235
01:26:58,227 --> 01:26:59,923
Watch out for the pyro!

1236
01:27:00,697 --> 01:27:01,823
What was that?

1237
01:27:04,535 --> 01:27:06,526
What was that last thing?

1238
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:09,833
Oh, my God, I'm on fire! I'm melting!

1239
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:13,103
I'm melting!
Sweet Jesus, I'm melting!

1240
01:27:14,548 --> 01:27:17,347
I said, "Watch out for the pyro."

1241
01:27:17,685 --> 01:27:20,415
And now, making his entrance
to the ring...

1242
01:27:20,723 --> 01:27:22,055
...DDP...

1243
01:27:22,257 --> 01:27:25,192
...Diamond Dallas Page!

1244
01:27:40,515 --> 01:27:44,213
I heard Sal was just too beat up
to make the trip.

1245
01:27:45,654 --> 01:27:49,887
And now the triple cage is
in place and ready.

1246
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:54,154
The challenger and champion are ready.

1247
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,728
Are we ready?

1248
01:28:01,107 --> 01:28:03,132
For the thousands in attendance...

1249
01:28:03,309 --> 01:28:06,473
...and the millions watching
around the world...

1250
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,139
...ladies and gentlemen...

1251
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:10,712
...we are...

1252
01:28:10,919 --> 01:28:14,378
...ready to rumble!

1253
01:28:25,604 --> 01:28:26,696
See you in hell.

1254
01:28:26,907 --> 01:28:31,072
There's the opening bell. You can feel
the electricity and the emotion...

1255
01:28:31,278 --> 01:28:32,906
...in this great arena.

1256
01:28:36,151 --> 01:28:37,516
Come on, let's do this!

1257
01:28:41,791 --> 01:28:42,621
You can't spit!

1258
01:28:47,866 --> 01:28:48,662
Yeah, that's it!

1259
01:28:56,044 --> 01:28:57,978
Oh, jeez, God, that's bad.

1260
01:29:04,355 --> 01:29:07,154
Come on, King.
Let me give you a hand, buddy.

1261
01:29:07,658 --> 01:29:08,647
Page!

1262
01:29:10,394 --> 01:29:13,523
You idiot! That stuff doesn't work.

1263
01:29:16,804 --> 01:29:19,068
A diamond upside down is a pussy!

1264
01:29:19,273 --> 01:29:21,071
- Come on, King!
- Son of a bitch!

1265
01:29:21,275 --> 01:29:23,106
King positioning the ladder
in the ring.

1266
01:29:23,277 --> 01:29:24,369
Hurry up! Come on!

1267
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:26,844
He's headed up to the second cage.

1268
01:29:27,048 --> 01:29:27,878
Get him now!

1269
01:29:28,084 --> 01:29:31,919
Who are these two guys that are
coming out? That's Juventud Guerrero.

1270
01:29:32,923 --> 01:29:35,893
Juventud Guerrero just
drop-kicked the ladder!

1271
01:29:38,265 --> 01:29:40,199
Who's that other masked wrestler?

1272
01:29:42,036 --> 01:29:44,368
- The crown!
- King's going for the crown!

1273
01:29:44,571 --> 01:29:46,232
Come on, King.

1274
01:29:46,407 --> 01:29:49,035
Smack him around like
a toothless crack whore!

1275
01:29:52,549 --> 01:29:55,951
Everybody out here now!
All of you, let's go! Come on!

1276
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,346
Four men are coming out.
Of course, it's DDP's goons.

1277
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,325
Look out, Jimmy!

1278
01:30:10,036 --> 01:30:13,632
Yeah, baby! That's it!
That's what I'm talking about!

1279
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:16,772
Don't, Dad, don't!

1280
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:18,310
Don't do it, Dad.

1281
01:30:18,482 --> 01:30:20,245
Why did Jimmy King stop?

1282
01:30:20,784 --> 01:30:24,016
What's going on here?
He just stopped in his tracks.

1283
01:30:25,123 --> 01:30:26,352
Son?

1284
01:30:26,559 --> 01:30:28,925
Jesus, what the hell are you doing?

1285
01:30:29,128 --> 01:30:30,117
Paying you back!

1286
01:30:33,801 --> 01:30:37,033
Now Jimmy King's the recipient
of a horrible beating.

1287
01:30:37,238 --> 01:30:39,173
And it all started with his own son.

1288
01:30:50,388 --> 01:30:51,446
Yeah, baby!

1289
01:30:53,492 --> 01:30:54,481
Here comes relief.

1290
01:30:55,027 --> 01:30:58,020
Look, it's Goldberg.
It's the Disco Inferno...

1291
01:30:58,232 --> 01:30:59,790
...Kidman and Booker T.!

1292
01:31:00,801 --> 01:31:03,498
There's no way they can
get through the gate.

1293
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:08,074
Mike, what is this?
What's this right here?

1294
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:33,668
- Get him good!
- You want to turn that crap off?

1295
01:31:34,276 --> 01:31:36,745
My son almost threw away a career
for that nonsense.

1296
01:31:36,981 --> 01:31:39,506
Your son's starting a career
with that nonsense.

1297
01:31:39,718 --> 01:31:41,209
Hit him, hit him.

1298
01:31:41,386 --> 01:31:43,115
Come on. You can do it.

1299
01:31:44,223 --> 01:31:45,213
Come on, King!

1300
01:31:45,392 --> 01:31:47,485
Son of a bitch!

1301
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:50,794
Get up and get that belt!

1302
01:31:51,366 --> 01:31:54,427
That's my best friend.
He's not really a cop, though.

1303
01:31:57,708 --> 01:31:59,438
Harpoon his ass!

1304
01:32:05,383 --> 01:32:06,976
That's my boy!

1305
01:32:08,754 --> 01:32:10,415
Nice spear, kid.

1306
01:32:11,558 --> 01:32:12,547
Who you calling "kid"?

1307
01:32:12,759 --> 01:32:15,125
You hear me?
Go in there and get them!

1308
01:32:15,328 --> 01:32:18,355
Jimmy King has made his way
up to the second cage.

1309
01:32:18,567 --> 01:32:21,264
You have the right to an attorney!
If you cannot...

1310
01:32:21,771 --> 01:32:25,230
- Good to have you back, brother!
- Good to be back, brother.

1311
01:32:25,876 --> 01:32:28,401
Did you check it out?
Do you like my deal?

1312
01:32:28,612 --> 01:32:30,103
You're such the Ponch!

1313
01:32:30,315 --> 01:32:32,875
Gordie, you look great
in that uniform.

1314
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:35,280
And the fans love you.

1315
01:32:35,455 --> 01:32:37,480
I think we should get back together.

1316
01:32:38,859 --> 01:32:41,829
I could never forgive you
for what you did to Sal.

1317
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:43,324
You're a mean lady.

1318
01:32:44,965 --> 01:32:45,954
Shut up, Sean!

1319
01:32:46,201 --> 01:32:47,225
You shouldn't...

1320
01:32:48,903 --> 01:32:52,340
- stand so close to the ring
when there's a ladder match going on.

1321
01:32:55,578 --> 01:32:58,274
Now both Diamond Dallas Page
and Jimmy King...

1322
01:32:58,917 --> 01:33:01,614
...have made it up to the second cage.

1323
01:33:08,829 --> 01:33:11,957
The further you get up,
the tougher it is...

1324
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,066
...and they are wasting each other.

1325
01:33:15,805 --> 01:33:17,831
Can you imagine the intensity?

1326
01:33:20,144 --> 01:33:22,978
This thing has turned into
a hard-core street fight.

1327
01:33:28,788 --> 01:33:32,247
DDP is headed up. He's made his way
into cage number three.

1328
01:33:56,122 --> 01:34:00,116
He just sent Jimmy King down
all the way to cage number one!

1329
01:34:09,038 --> 01:34:11,940
It's Sting! He nailed
Diamond Dallas Page!

1330
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:16,612
What are you doing, freak?!

1331
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:20,715
Sting is helping Jimmy King!
Can you believe this?

1332
01:34:21,088 --> 01:34:22,385
This is a shocker!

1333
01:34:25,592 --> 01:34:27,025
Jimmy King's all right by me.

1334
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,588
You love Jimmy King.

1335
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:31,960
I love Jimmy King.

1336
01:34:32,202 --> 01:34:33,294
We're men.

1337
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:36,599
And we're not afraid to say
that we love other men.

1338
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:38,364
I love you.

1339
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,841
Me too, man. Hit me! My turn!

1340
01:34:43,816 --> 01:34:45,648
It's even. It's back to square one.

1341
01:34:46,553 --> 01:34:50,581
They're fighting their way up
the side of the cage toward the top.

1342
01:35:14,789 --> 01:35:17,224
Who the hell are you fighting for?

1343
01:35:17,392 --> 01:35:19,087
Me!

1344
01:35:41,689 --> 01:35:45,056
You got it, King! You got it!
Come on!

1345
01:36:10,593 --> 01:36:13,529
Diamond Dallas Page has taken
a horrible fall!

1346
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:14,992
He's down!

1347
01:36:19,937 --> 01:36:21,838
Yeah! Come on, buddy!

1348
01:36:34,758 --> 01:36:37,420
And Jimmy King has the belt!
He did it!

1349
01:36:37,627 --> 01:36:39,892
Jimmy King is the champion!

1350
01:36:41,131 --> 01:36:42,860
Yeah, baby!

1351
01:36:43,068 --> 01:36:44,729
You did it!

1352
01:37:00,089 --> 01:37:02,354
Yeah! That's right!

1353
01:37:06,932 --> 01:37:09,298
What a struggle, what a battle!

1354
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:12,959
Jimmy King has overcome all the odds,
Mike! He's the champion!

1355
01:37:13,171 --> 01:37:15,697
You suck, Sinclair!

1356
01:37:17,076 --> 01:37:18,135
Get out of here!

1357
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:23,983
What are you talking about?

1358
01:37:24,987 --> 01:37:27,650
I made wrestling! Me!

1359
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:29,853
I made them all!

1360
01:37:32,196 --> 01:37:34,858
You didn't make wrestling!
We made wrestling!

1361
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:38,759
Yeah, geek.

1362
01:37:38,972 --> 01:37:41,464
The people, the fans made wrestling.

1363
01:37:54,859 --> 01:37:58,023
We want King! We want King!

1364
01:37:59,565 --> 01:38:02,933
In the most amazing battle ever
witnessed, ladies and gentlemen...

1365
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:07,164
...the undisputed WCW
Heavyweight Champion of the World

1366
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:09,900
Jimmy King!

1367
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:14,445
You regained the heavyweight title.

1368
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:17,518
What about tag-team belts?
Any thoughts about unification?

1369
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:21,282
Excuse me. Jimmy, looks like
you need a tag-team partner.

1370
01:38:21,491 --> 01:38:22,788
What do you say?

1371
01:38:23,427 --> 01:38:26,226
Bill, I appreciate it. Really, I do.

1372
01:38:27,867 --> 01:38:31,929
But I think I already got me
a tag-team partner out here somewhere.

1373
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:33,666
Where is he?

1374
01:38:36,544 --> 01:38:38,638
There he is. That's him right there.

1375
01:38:39,915 --> 01:38:41,816
My new tag-team partner.

1376
01:38:42,018 --> 01:38:44,077
That's Gordie Boggs, a.k.a. The Law!

1377
01:38:47,758 --> 01:38:49,248
I will bust you!

1378
01:38:49,961 --> 01:38:51,953
That's it! That's it!

1379
01:38:52,164 --> 01:38:54,155
Right here's our new manager...

1380
01:38:54,366 --> 01:38:57,165
...Sean "Sugar Daddy" Dawkins!

1381
01:39:02,143 --> 01:39:04,169
I love you, Sean!

1382
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,348
I love Sean!

1383
01:39:31,647 --> 01:39:32,909
So you see...

1384
01:39:33,283 --> 01:39:34,615
...dreams can come true.

1385
01:39:34,817 --> 01:39:37,308
Yeah, but it was a one-time deal.

1386
01:39:37,487 --> 01:39:40,616
Like you'll really manage King,
and Gordie's gonna wrestle.

1387
01:39:58,148 --> 01:40:00,013
Can you say it now?

1388
01:40:02,019 --> 01:40:04,681
I'm your bitch and you're my daddy?

1389
01:40:06,824 --> 01:40:08,485
Rolled right off his tongue.

1390
01:40:08,726 --> 01:40:11,161
That should teach you
to be nice to kids.

1391
01:40:16,603 --> 01:40:17,501
Gentlemen...

1392
01:40:18,306 --> 01:40:19,500
...we've gotta go.

1393
01:40:29,854 --> 01:40:32,380
God bless America!

1394
01:40:48,679 --> 01:40:50,977
You like Samoan butt sex?

1395
01:40:52,782 --> 01:40:56,378
There's a lot of glare coming off
of that dome of yours, anus-breath!

1396
01:40:56,553 --> 01:41:00,251
There's a lot of glare coming off
of that dome of yours, booger-face!

1397
01:41:00,458 --> 01:41:03,917
I know. It smells like you poured it
right from your butt.

1398
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:07,123
Smells like you poured it
right from your butt. Sorry.

1399
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,968
Wait, I forgot the line.

1400
01:41:12,175 --> 01:41:14,370
Now I'm gonna get you!

1401
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:17,079
Oh, shit, man!

1402
01:41:17,281 --> 01:41:20,376
Michael got himself a whore

1403
01:41:20,552 --> 01:41:22,019
Sorry.

1404
01:41:22,487 --> 01:41:24,479
That was quite a thrill.
How you...?

1405
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:26,453
That's my hand. It's broken now.

1406
01:41:26,626 --> 01:41:28,059
Come on, this is nothing!

1407
01:41:28,262 --> 01:41:31,197
You remember when Macho Man
threw you off the rail?

1408
01:41:31,498 --> 01:41:32,487
Go. Start again.

1409
01:41:32,699 --> 01:41:33,996
Come on, this is nothing!

1410
01:41:34,201 --> 01:41:36,898
You remember when Macho Man
threw you off the rail?

1411
01:41:37,106 --> 01:41:38,971
No, that's bad. One more time.

1412
01:41:39,175 --> 01:41:41,040
Come on, this is nothing!

1413
01:41:41,243 --> 01:41:42,438
- Sorry.
- Shut up.

1414
01:41:42,612 --> 01:41:46,344
Yeah, and he broke five ribs
and dislocated your shoulder...

1415
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:48,576
...but you broke...

1416
01:41:48,953 --> 01:41:51,320
You broke five ribs
and dislocated your shoulder!

1417
01:41:51,491 --> 01:41:53,823
You still came back to whip all three!

1418
01:41:55,795 --> 01:41:57,990
He's worthless.

1419
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,793
He can't do it.

1420
01:42:01,838 --> 01:42:03,864
Breasts. Jugs. Hooters.

1421
01:42:05,142 --> 01:42:07,668
I can't stop looking at them!

1422
01:42:14,487 --> 01:42:16,011
Terrifying.

1423
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:34,043
Oh, the humanity!
