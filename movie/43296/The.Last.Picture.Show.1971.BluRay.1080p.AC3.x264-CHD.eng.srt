[Sonny] You can have another stick of gum.
That's all I got on me.

You can give me a dollar too.

That's how much it cost me and Marlene
for the show.

Hi. What y'all doing
back here in the dark?

Where'd the boys go?

[Joan Bennett] Ben had some date,
and Tommy went to basketball practice.

- Oh, Delilah, will you bring the coffee, please?
- Yes, Mrs. Banks.

I don't see why they should get
the pickup first all the time.

Oh, my God, Charlene.

Yeah. One thing leads to another.

My mama told me how that old stuff goes.

I might have known you wasn't dependable.

- She don't even have a good disposition.

What are you blue about then?

There ain't nobody to go with in this town.

You don't have to eat so fast.
You ain't in a race.

Jacy will bring him more misery
than she'll ever be worth.

You and Duane both in a boardin' house.
