1
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:29,616
<i>President Truman will be here tomorrow,
so all you folks in Dallas turn out.</i>

2
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,911
<i>This is Cowboy Rhythms on KTRN,
Wichita Falls.</i>

3
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:35,997
<i>Here's Hank Williams' big hit tune,
"Cold, Cold Heart."</i>

4
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:44,172
You ain't ever gonna amount to nothing.

5
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:48,259
Already spent a dime this morning,
ain't even had a decent breakfast.

6
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,221
Give me the chalk.

7
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:57,769
Why don't you comb your hair, Sonny?

8
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:01,022
It sticks up. Look like you smelled a wolf.

9
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,617
I'm surprised
you had the nerve to show up...

10
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:14,994
...after that stomping
you all took last night.

11
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,539
- Well, could've been worse.
- What'd you say?

12
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:22,335
- Could've been worse.
- Yeah.

13
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:25,004
You can say that
about nearly everything, I guess.

14
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,594
A few football teams have had
some luck with tackling.

15
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:34,305
Keeps the other team
from scoring quite so often.

16
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:36,808
Sounds too rough for me.

17
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,401
You don't even care
if it was your last game.

18
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:50,238
You ain't ever gonna get stomped for
your own high-school ball team again.

19
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:53,658
- Where's your school spirit?
- Don't know.

20
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:58,329
You working today?

21
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:00,623
The truck's being greased.

22
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:28,526
So, you see, this is what I get for betting
on my own hometown ball team.

23
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:31,738
I ought to have better sense.

24
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,449
Wouldn't hurt if you had a better hometown.

25
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,744
You mind pointing that
at the floor till I get by?

26
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,288
I don't want my eye poked out.

27
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,586
Don't let Billy get too far away,
will you, son?

28
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:52,926
You're damn more dangerous in a pool
hall than you are on a football field.

29
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,429
Hey-

30
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,265
You ever heard of tackling?

31
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:17,617
Hey, Duane!

32
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,495
Boy, I froze my ass last night!

33
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:23,873
Hey, why the hell
can't you kids learn to tackle?

34
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:38,763
Hey, how about taking Genevieve some
change, being as you're going that way?

35
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:51,734
Toss me one!

36
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,863
Pick up the ball, Crawford.

37
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,074
Look, Larry, they can catch.

38
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:01,369
Feisty sons of bitches, aren't they?
Wish they could tackle.

39
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:03,663
Or do something useful.

40
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,041
Team wasn't worth a kiss-my-ass this year.

41
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,511
Fade out, Crawford. One more time.

42
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,434
All right, you boys. Cut it out.

43
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,937
I got enough problems without you
playing that game over again.

44
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:31,107
We could've run off
to Mexico with this, you know.

45
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,820
- Hey, play the new one we heard.
- Which one?

46
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:37,280
Down payment on breakfast.

47
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:39,282
Let somebody prosperous play the jukebox.

48
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,076
Nobody prosperous would eat here.

49
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:50,793
- Well, I ain't very hungry.
- Well, I am.

50
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,712
You want the pickup first tonight?

51
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,089
I oughtn't get it first every Saturday.
It's half yours.

52
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:56,841
- Go ahead.
- You sure?

53
00:06:57,008 --> 00:07:00,053
Sure, I'm sure. Anyways, I got lots
of deliveries to make.

54
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,263
- And I have to go clear to Ranger.
- Okay.

55
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,725
I'll be lucky to get back
for the second show.

56
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,105
My goodness, Sonny.

57
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,482
Frank oughtn't work you so late on weekends.

58
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,109
That's what I keep telling him.

59
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,654
You ain't got in in time
to see the comedy in three weeks.

60
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:02,865
Hope you don't want popcorn,
because there ain't none.

61
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,034
And you missed the newsreel too.

62
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:08,997
The main show's done started,
so I'll just charge you 30 cents.

63
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:10,289
Thanks, Miss Mosey.

64
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,460
<i>I was wondering if my daughter had
deserted us too, when I heard her voice.</i>

65
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,089
<i>Pa! Pa! Hi, Pa.</i>

66
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:19,924
<i>Kay was our only daughter.</i>

67
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:24,220
<i>I know a father's not supposed
to have favourites, but when it's Kay...</i>

68
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:27,306
<i>- You smell good.
- You like it?</i>

69
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:30,435
<i>- What's that?
- An atomiser.</i>

70
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,061
<i>What'd you get? A present?</i>

71
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,938
<i>Who from?</i>

72
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:35,773
<i>Somebody.</i>

73
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:44,532
I decided you had a wreck.

74
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:51,539
<i>What's happened to you? You look different.</i>

75
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,875
- I do?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,378
<i>You look all lit up inside.</i>

77
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,590
<i>You're not wearing your usual deadpan look.</i>

78
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:03,301
<i>That "How'd I ever get
into this family?" look.</i>

79
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:05,136
<i>Father.</i>

80
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:07,680
<i>You've been taking those vitamins
Dr Gray sent you.</i>

81
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,640
<i>That's right.</i>

82
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:26,157
<i>I guess I'll get me some of those vitamins.</i>

83
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:28,659
<i>I'll get it, Delilah.</i>

84
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,581
<i>What's the matter with her?
She looks kind of queer.</i>

85
00:09:33,748 --> 00:09:36,959
- Guess what.
- What?

86
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,048
- It's our anniversary.
- What?

87
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,760
We've been going steady a year tonight.

88
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:47,470
Yeah?

89
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:51,557
Seems like a lot longer.

90
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,019
You should've got me
some anniversary present.

91
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:58,064
You can have another stick of gum.
That's all I got on me.

92
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,565
You can give me a dollar too.

93
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,568
That's how much it cost me
and Marlene for the show.

94
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,947
Hi. What are y'all doing
back here in the dark?

95
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:11,369
<i>- He's coming for me in a few minutes.
- I'll get your coffee.</i>

96
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,874
<i>- Where'd the boys go?
- Ben had some date.</i>

97
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,668
<i>Tommy went for basketball practice.</i>

98
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,050
I don't see why they should get
the pickup first all the time.

99
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:29,011
All they ever wanna do is neck anyway.

100
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,391
<i>Buckley says that's not too young
for them to marry.</i>

101
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:36,519
<i>- I didn't marry your mother till I was 25.
- Oh, I know, Pop.</i>

102
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,319
- Need some help, Jessie?
- Yeah, sure do.

103
00:10:45,486 --> 00:10:47,113
- So long, Sam.
- Bye, Sam.

104
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,322
- Come on.
- Good night.

105
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:51,117
- Good night. Sure did like the picture.
- Well, good.

106
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,161
- Good night.
- Good night.

107
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,703
Crack your window. Leave the motor running.

108
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,247
It's just too cold in here.

109
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,262
Your hands are like ice!

110
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,973
Put on my gloves.

111
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:18,329
What's the matter with you?
You act plain bored.

112
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,166
Quit! Quit!

113
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,627
You said this was our anniversary.

114
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,963
Let's do something different.

115
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:30,216
Well, I like that! You cheapskate.

116
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:34,011
Didn't even get me a present,
and now you wanna get me pregnant.

117
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,972
My God, Charlene! It was just my hand.

118
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,432
Yeah. One thing leads to another.

119
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,352
My mama told me how that old stuff goes.

120
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,772
We'll have plenty of time for that
when we get married.

121
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,233
You wasn't no livelier than me.

122
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,612
Because you ain't good-looking enough.
You ain't even got a ducktail.

123
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,823
Well, anyway, I'm done late.

124
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,033
Let's go on home.

125
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,411
Some anniversary.

126
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,957
If that's the way you feel about it,
I'd just as soon break up, Charlene.

127
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:06,460
I don't wanna spoil
no more anniversaries for you.

128
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:09,046
That's the way
nice girls get treated in this town!

129
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:11,048
I might've known you wasn't dependable.

130
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:13,134
You wasn't even in the backfield either.

131
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:17,096
This jacket's got a hole in the pocket,
but don't ask me to sew it for you.

132
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,181
You can give me back my pictures too.

133
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,560
I don't want you showing all
the other boys and telling how hot I am.

134
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,021
You wasn't very hot.

135
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,506
I hope you ain't down
in the mouth about Charlene.

136
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:56,677
- I ain't blue about her.
- What are you blue about then?

137
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:59,180
Ain't nobody to go with in this town.

138
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:02,433
Jacy's the only pretty girl in school
and Duane's got her.

139
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,186
I'd call that his tough luck.

140
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:08,689
You don't have to eat so fast.
You ain't in a race.

141
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:12,318
Jacy will bring you more misery
than she'll ever be worth.

142
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,073
Did your dad give you this?

143
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,283
He needs all he's got.

144
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,245
Wouldn't hurt you to take something
from him once in a while.

145
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:27,333
I don't know. You and Duane
both in a boarding house.

146
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,170
Him with the mother, and you
with the father. Don't seem right.

147
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:34,507
And your dad's taking
too many pills, you know.

148
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,092
Yeah.

149
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,636
But I'm no one to talk.

150
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:41,097
I never did get on with Mama. I still don't.

151
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:43,849
Say, I hear Dan's going back to work soon.

152
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,395
- I guess you'll be quitting before long.
- Honey...

153
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:52,149
...we got 4000 dollars' worth
of doctor bills to pay.

154
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:56,654
I will probably be making cheeseburgers
for your grandkids.

155
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,122
Look at it. Your little ducktail over here.

156
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,652
Well...

157
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,239
...I wonder what my chances are,
this morning...

158
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,658
...of interesting you kids in John Keats.

159
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,577
None at all.

160
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,082
Joe Bob?

161
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,835
I read that poem of his
about the nightingale.

162
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:54,670
I didn't think it was so good.

163
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:57,798
Sounded like he wanted to be a nightingale.

164
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:01,927
I don't think he wanted
to be a nightingale, Joe Bob.

165
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,305
Maybe he just wanted to be immortal.

166
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:08,309
All you have to do to be immortal
is lead a good Christian life.

167
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,145
Anyone can do it if they love the Lord.

168
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:13,981
Well, maybe so, Joe Bob, maybe so.

169
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:16,484
Here now, let me-- Let me read you this.

170
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,572
"When old age shall this generation waste...

171
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:26,202
...thou shalt remain
in midst of other woe than ours...

172
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:30,664
...a friend to man, to whom thou say'st:

173
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:34,293
'Beauty is truth, truth beauty'--

174
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,129
That is all ye know on earth...

175
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,256
...and all ye need to know."

176
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,425
Run, you little pissants, run!

177
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:45,513
Tough it out! Tough it out!
You gotta be men like the rest of us.

178
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,640
Ain't none of you pretty enough to be women.

179
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,225
Here, Joe Bob.

180
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:52,228
Quit flapping your arms.
You look like a goddamn goose.

181
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:55,356
Even for a preacher's boy,
you ought to be in better shape.

182
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:57,608
What kind of female are you ever gonna get?

183
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,946
Tough it out! Tough it out!

184
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:04,114
Run, you little pissants.

185
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,285
All right, off the court.

186
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,707
If you all didn't jack off so damn much,
maybe you could stay in shape.

187
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:15,626
Come here a minute, Sonny.

188
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:21,173
Now, you do me a favour,
and I'll do you one.

189
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,133
Sure, coach.

190
00:17:25,386 --> 00:17:28,055
My old lady's got to go
to the doctor tomorrow.

191
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:30,099
You know women. Always something wrong.

192
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,392
Yeah, I guess.

193
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,605
Well, take it from me. Anyway,
I haven't got have time to drive her.

194
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:40,985
Now, if you'll do this for me,
I'll get you out of civics class.

195
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:44,280
I'll be glad to.
That's the best offer I've had all day.

196
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:46,699
You tell her you got to get back
for practice...

197
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,951
...so she won't stay in there too long.

198
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,203
I've got enough bills to pay already.

199
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,543
"Know what the trouble is with you?

200
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,838
You ain't got no school spirit."

201
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,385
<i>Anarene High School, we love you</i>

202
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,722
<i>Love you ever so grand</i>

00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,392

204
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,187

<i>And we'll fight for you</i>

209
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:50,054
You need a haircut.

210
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,436
Hey, come on, Jimmie Sue.
We're hungry over here too.

211
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,023
I'm coming. I'm coming. Hold your horses!

212
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:09,323
Better watch it. Here comes your mama.

213
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,669
Jacy, we're having supper at home tonight.

214
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:24,380
I expect you there in 15 minutes, you hear?

215
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:27,758
Okay, Mama.
I was just giving the boys a ride.

216
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,095
Hey, Abilene.

217
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:55,077
<i>Now here's a tune that's been
on the pop hit list for some weeks.</i>

218
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:56,537
<i>Listen and tell us the name.</i>

219
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,083
<i>What is it?</i>

220
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,710
<i>What is it, huh?</i>

221
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:06,213
<i>- "Shrimp Boats."
- "Shrimp Boats" You got it!</i>

222
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:10,634
<i>Very good, Thomas. You were in on that too.</i>

223
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:13,095
<i>All right. There's $120.
We're going along fine.</i>

224
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,681
<i>Now we come to City Limits. This is...</i>

225
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:30,279
Guess you hate me tonight, huh?

226
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:34,366
Oh, Mama, I love you, but I love
Duane too. Even if you don't like it.

227
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,786
I don't care. I'd just hate
to see you marry him, that's all.

228
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,621
You wouldn't be rich anymore.

229
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,082
- I don't care about money. Not at all.
- In two months, he'll stop flattering you.

230
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:43,333
You're pretty stupid then.

231
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,171
You married Daddy when he was poor,
and he got rich, didn't he?

232
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,965
Scared your daddy
into getting rich, beautiful.

233
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,800
If Daddy could do it, Duane could too.

234
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,554
Not married to you. You're not scary enough.

235
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,932
Well, you're rich and miserable.
I sure don't wanna be like you.

236
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,685
Not much danger of that.

237
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:04,563
- You slept with him?
- Mama!

238
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,775
Go to the doctor sometime
and arrange something...

239
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:11,153
...so you don't have to worry
about babies. You have to be careful.

240
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,157
But it's a sin unless you're married.
You know I wouldn't do that.

241
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:17,409
Don't be so mealy-mouthed!

242
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,203
I thought if you slept with him...

243
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:22,414
...you might find out that there isn't
anything magic about him.

244
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,625
Then we can send you away to a good school--

245
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,835
- But I don't wanna leave.
- Marry some wealthy boy.

246
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:29,338
Why can't I stay here and go
to college in Wichita Falls?

247
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:30,756
Because.

248
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,926
Everything is flat and empty here.

249
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,844
And nothing to do!

250
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,429
Can I have some of that?

251
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,890
Help yourself. Don't you have any?

252
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:43,769
Well, yeah, but I feel like
smelling good right now.

253
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:47,606
Don't you ever feel like
doing anything right now?

254
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:54,530
You ought to leave your face just like that.

255
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:57,157
All you really need now is
a little eyebrow pencil.

256
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:05,958
Okay. Good night.

257
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:14,258
Just remember, beautiful, everything
gets old if you do it often enough.

258
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:18,554
So if you wanna find out about
monotony real quick, marry Duane.

Hello, Sonny. What you want?

280
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,027
Coach said you need a driver.

281
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,074
Didn't he tell you I was coming?

282
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,953
No, he didn't mention it. I thought
he was gonna drive me himself.

283
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,538
I guess he just couldn't get off.

284
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,084
Let me just get the radio.

285
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:49,329
Is it something bad?

286
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,790
No.

287
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:56,086
It's something very...

288
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:33,832
Thank you.

289
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,959
Here's the keys.

290
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:43,842
I guess I'd better
be getting back to school.

291
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,013
It was nice of you to drive me.

292
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,266
Well, it beats sitting
through civics, ma'am.

293
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,910
Wouldn't you like to come in
and have a soda?

294
00:26:10,077 --> 00:26:13,038
If you can stand me for a few more minutes.

295
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:15,957
Okay.

296
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,377
I hate these northers.

297
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,234
Would you prefer milk?
Just sit at the table.

298
00:26:42,943 --> 00:26:45,070
Or you can go right now if you want.

299
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:49,282
I was just scared to be alone for
a minute. I'm sorry I made you come in.

300
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:51,701
I'll take a Dr Pepper.

301
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:49,509
You'll never forgive me, I know.

302
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:53,972
Go on. You don't have to stay any longer.

303
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:57,434
Thank you for the Dr Pepper.

304
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:01,229
I guess you'll be glad
when basketball season's over.

305
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:03,982
Why?

306
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:07,068
Well, coach probably don't get
to stay home much...

307
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:09,571
...during football and basketball season.

308
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:15,076
My God, you don't know
a thing about it, do you?

309
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:27,214
You better go on to basketball practice.

310
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,177
Thanks for the Dr Pepper.

311
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:11,883
- Hi, Jacy.
- Oh, hi.

312
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,010
Duane coming?

313
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:17,305
Say, you know Bobby Sheen, don't you?
Over at Wichita Falls?

314
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:18,890
I met him at the country club.

315
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,977
Well, he's gonna have
this midnight swimming party tonight.

316
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,521
- You wanna run over there with me?
- I can't.

317
00:29:24,688 --> 00:29:26,564
I guess you heard about the last one.

318
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:30,193
His folks were gone to Miami,
and everybody swam naked.

319
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,238
His folks are gone again,
so it'll probably be pretty wild.

320
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,449
Sure wish you could come.
Bobby has great parties.

321
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:39,869
A lot of kids from the club gonna be there.

322
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:46,418
Gee, Lester, I'd like to go.

323
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:50,255
I'm gonna have a big problem
with Duane though.

324
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:53,675
Well, don't go off without me. Maybe I can.

325
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,768
- Hi, Duane.
- What did Lester want?

326
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,438
Oh, Lester. He's such a bore.

327
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:16,031
- Hey, Abilene!
- What do you say, buddy?

328
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:22,120
Hey there. Hi.

329
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,957
Merry Christmas.

330
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:30,045
This is Jackie Lee French.
This is Lois Farrow, my boss's wife.

331
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,339
What do you mean, kissing her like that?

332
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:34,132
I ought to slap your face!

333
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,468
Well, why don't you just kiss my ass?

334
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,720
I never come here to referee no fight.

335
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:41,681
Well, good, then come dance with me.

336
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:45,060
Get yourself a drink, honey. I'll be back.

337
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:53,485
Hi, Ruth.

338
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:38,071
<i>Wait for me outside.</i>

339
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,584
--a thousand barrels of oil a day.

340
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:55,797
A thousand barrels.

341
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,929
It's too hot in here. Let's go outside.

342
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:05,140
I don't want drunks tromping on my feet.

343
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:07,642
I got something to give you anyway.

344
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:09,018
- Hey, Sonny-
- Hey, Sonny-

345
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:10,478
Hi.

346
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:17,652
Hi, Sonny.

347
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:18,945
Hi, Dad.

348
00:32:19,112 --> 00:32:20,989
How you doing?

349
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:23,658
Okay.

350
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,910
Well, that's good.

351
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:32,292
See you.

352
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:34,043
Sure.

353
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,301
- You mean, my Christmas present.
- Yep.

354
00:32:41,468 --> 00:32:43,803
I haven't had time to get you anything yet.

355
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,430
I haven't had a minute to shop.

356
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:48,099
Hope you like it.
I saved up for six months to get it.

357
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,644
Oh, it's just beautiful.

358
00:32:51,811 --> 00:32:54,105
It's just what I've been wanting.

359
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,358
You're so sweet,
spending all that money on me.

360
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:02,530
Oh, you're so sexy, Duane.

361
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:05,116
I just wish I didn't have
to leave you tonight.

362
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:06,618
Well, you don't.

363
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,621
Oh, I do too. I could just kill my mother!

364
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:10,830
What do you mean?

365
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:15,084
She made me promise to go to a swim
party in Wichita with Lester Marlow.

366
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:17,337
Because his folks are rich. Don't be mad.

367
00:33:17,504 --> 00:33:19,130
I ain't mad at you, but goddamn it!

368
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,966
It's all Lester's fault.
He keeps asking Mama.

369
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,968
All I wanna do is stay with the man I love.

370
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,637
Goddamn.

371
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,441
No, no, Duane! I gotta go. I gotta go.

372
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:45,133
What do you mean, asking my girl for a date?

373
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,927
- You turn me loose!
- I will when you're ready to fight.

374
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:49,137
Let's have it out!

375
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,597
Come on, Marlow.

376
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:55,560
Here, knock off that shit, boys.
This is the Christmas season.

377
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,020
Run along here, Wichita.

378
00:34:57,186 --> 00:35:01,107
I can't stand here all night
protecting your shoeshine.

379
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:12,160
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
about him. He's so crazy about me.

380
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:15,705
Nothing against Duane,
but that's a roughneck for you.

381
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:18,333
They aren't sophisticated
about these things.

382
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,420
Well, Merry Christmas!

383
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:25,798
Come on in, let's have some punch, boy.

384
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:38,478
- Hi, Sonny.
- Oh, hi.

385
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:41,648
- Wanna help me?
- Okay.

386
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,161
You're not dancing.
Don't you have a girlfriend?

387
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:57,997
I did have. We broke up a couple months ago.

388
00:35:58,164 --> 00:36:01,876
Oh, why? Mind my asking?

389
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:04,962
I was going with Charlene Duggs.

390
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,549
She thought I got fresh with her.
I never did, really.

391
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:12,512
I guess we broke up because we didn't
like each other much to begin with.

392
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:15,014
I hope you're not sad about it.

393
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,850
I don't think
Charlene's near nice enough for you.

394
00:36:18,017 --> 00:36:20,103
I didn't see you dancing.

395
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,106
No, I don't dance much.

396
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:14,240
Will you drive me
to the clinic again next week?

397
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:16,367
Well, you bet.

398
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,586
We better not dawdle here.

399
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:41,225
Bobby.

400
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:44,520
Hey, look! New victims!

401
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:49,776
- Hi, Jacy.

402
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:52,612
Glad you could make it.
We're dressed informally.

403
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:53,988
Hi, Jacy.

404
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:56,407
You know Annie-Annie.

405
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,701
Wanna join the club?

406
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:00,244
Sure.

407
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,623
Well, you gotta get undressed
out there on the diving board.

408
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,375
So everybody gets to watch.

409
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:07,919
We all do it the first time.

410
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:11,172
- That's the rule.
- Yeah. I did it last Easter.

411
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:14,425
- Okay?
- Okay.

412
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,636
Everybody out for the strip show!

413
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,082
Don't pay any attention to Sandy.
He's my little brother.

414
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:49,460
If he gooses you or anything,
I'll make him go to bed.

415
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:55,341
Goodness!
I hope I don't fall off this thing.

416
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:57,385
Sandy can fish you out if you do.

417
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:03,970
Duane, been looking for you.
Hey, where's Jacy?

418
00:41:04,136 --> 00:41:07,306
Oh, don't remind him.
We just got him quiet. Want a drink?

419
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:09,767
- Where'd you get it?
- Found it in a guy's car.

420
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,019
- When he weren't looking.
- Let's do something.

421
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,355
Good idea. Why don't we hunt up some pussy?

422
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:18,067
Oh, you wouldn't know what to do with it
if we found some.

423
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:19,276
What happened?

424
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,571
Lester took his girl to a swimming party.

425
00:41:22,738 --> 00:41:24,573
Let's all go out and get a fuck.

426
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,452
I know where's a heifer.
It belongs to my Uncle Hank.

427
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,413
Why the hell not?

428
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:33,040
- I say a heifer beats nothing.
- Pussy's pussy!

429
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:35,376
I don't want no heifer.

430
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,004
We ought to buy Billy a piece of ass.

431
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,382
- Yeah, we oughtn't let him die a virgin.
- Yeah.

432
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:43,759
Mama says idiot kids don't live long.

433
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:45,928
He ain't no idiot kid. He just don't talk.

434
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:47,680
Bet he's still a virgin, though.

435
00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:51,017
Hey, we ought to fix him up with Jimmie Sue.

436
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:52,935
It'd make no difference to Billy.

437
00:41:53,102 --> 00:41:55,312
Look, we shouldn't try anything like that.

438
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,024
Why not? It wouldn't cost us
more than $1.50.

439
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,276
If that's all,
we ought to get her ourselves.

440
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:03,195
Shit! A heifer's better than Jimmie Sue.

441
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:06,699
Get the stupid little thing in here.
I ain't got all night.

442
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:09,577
Let's get those pants off, boys.

443
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:12,913
You won't be a virgin much longer.

444
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,624
Come on, Billy, we're gonna get you laid.

445
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,255
Grab on now. Come on, do your job.

446
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:23,424
Get her, Billy-boy!

447
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,431
This is the dumbest thing I ever seen!

448
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:33,601
- He don't even know what to do!
- Come on, Billy. It worked for me.

449
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,352
Damn it, put it to her, boy!

450
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,272
- Get her, Billy.
- Come on, Billy. Screw it to her, boy.

451
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:40,149
You stop that yelling out there.

452
00:42:40,316 --> 00:42:41,942
It ain't even in!

453
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:43,611
Goddamn!

454
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,155
Goddamn, you stupid little thing!

455
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:48,908
Couldn't even wait. Look at this mess!

456
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:02,338
You okay, Billy?

457
00:43:02,505 --> 00:43:04,256
You all right?

458
00:43:15,101 --> 00:43:18,813
Well, now I know. Idiots as bad as Mexicans.

459
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:21,857
Don't bother me no more
for that crazy thing.

460
00:43:22,024 --> 00:43:25,778
Wouldn't mess with him again
for less than three and a half.

461
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:57,977
Which one of you bloodied his nose?

462
00:43:58,477 --> 00:44:02,439
I've told you all not to fight with Billy.
He don't understand about fighting.

463
00:44:02,982 --> 00:44:04,108
What happened, Sonny?

464
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:07,528
- It weren't none of us, Sam.
- No, it was Jimmie Sue.

465
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:11,574
Jimmie Sue? How'd he get messed up with her?

466
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:16,162
We bought him a piece of ass.
Thought he was tired of being a virgin.

467
00:44:16,328 --> 00:44:20,040
She got mad about something
and bloodied his nose.

468
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:23,794
You boys get on out of here.

469
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,630
I don't wanna have no more to do with you.

470
00:44:27,506 --> 00:44:29,800
Scaring a poor,
unfortunate creature like Billy...

471
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,511
...just so you could have a few laughs.

472
00:44:32,678 --> 00:44:36,599
I've been around
that trashy behaviour all my life.

473
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:39,310
I'm getting tired of putting up with it.

474
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:42,438
You can stay out
of this pool hall, my café...

475
00:44:42,605 --> 00:44:44,857
...and my picture show too.

476
00:44:45,941 --> 00:44:48,611
I don't want no more of your business.

477
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,324
We didn't mean for anything bad
to happen, Sam. We--

478
00:44:54,283 --> 00:44:57,244
You didn't even have the decency
to wash his face.

479
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:23,354
We're his best customers.
He can't run us off.

480
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:27,650
Can he'?

481
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:40,663
Lucky I fell asleep.
I'd hate not being able to shoot no pool.

482
00:45:57,596 --> 00:45:59,223
You sure he won't come?

483
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:03,560
You know he won't.
He's just starting basketball practice.

484
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:55,881
It's all right.

485
00:49:18,964 --> 00:49:21,258
I'm sorry I cried.

486
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:25,095
Just scared, I guess.

487
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:28,640
He ain't gonna come.

488
00:49:28,807 --> 00:49:31,268
They're probably running plays
right now, I bet.

489
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,896
No, not scared of that.

490
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:38,901
Scared I could never do this, I guess.

491
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:43,947
Can't seem to do anything
without crying about it.

492
00:49:45,991 --> 00:49:48,035
How could you like me?

493
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:50,245
I like you.

494
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:54,666
I'm glad.

495
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:53,744
Come on in.
I ain't gonna throw bottles at you.

496
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:57,247
Hi.

497
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:00,417
What have you been doing? You lost weight.

498
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,462
Ain't had any
of your cheeseburgers in weeks.

499
00:52:03,629 --> 00:52:06,173
Come on. I'll fix you one.

500
00:52:06,506 --> 00:52:09,843
Even though that wasn't
a very nice thing y'all done to Billy.

501
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:12,346
Can't blame Sam.

502
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:14,264
- Was that your idea?
- No.

503
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,893
Duane's? He was there, wasn't he?

504
00:52:18,393 --> 00:52:21,229
Just didn't have the decency
to own up to it.

505
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:27,611
Don't worry, I won't tell on him.
I should, though.

506
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,489
Sure smells good.

507
00:52:30,656 --> 00:52:32,532
One thing I know for sure.

508
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,409
A person can't sneeze in this town...

509
00:52:34,576 --> 00:52:36,203
...without somebody offering a handkerchief.

510
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:38,664
- What you mean?
- Nothing.

511
00:52:39,414 --> 00:52:41,958
It's an awful small town
for any kind of carrying on.

512
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,504
Don't forget to put some onions on.

513
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,799
And some people got a lot of guns.

514
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,722
All right, you don't need my advice anyway.

515
00:52:55,889 --> 00:52:59,643
Why don't you go play a record?
These will be done in a minute.

516
00:53:28,547 --> 00:53:31,133
Just come in to say hello to Genevieve.

517
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,098
Sonny...

518
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,393
...food's getting cold.

519
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:52,988
What are you grinning about?

520
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:56,032
Chicken-fry me a steak,
and try to use meat this time.

521
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:07,669
I heard about the ball game last night.

522
00:54:07,836 --> 00:54:10,881
121 to 14.

523
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,091
Must be pretty near a record.

524
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:17,387
Sam.

525
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,389
I'm sorry.

526
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:24,269
I reckon y'all need glasses.

527
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:37,199
Now hold still.

528
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:40,368
Want some more cookies?

529
00:54:40,535 --> 00:54:43,497
- More milk?
- I'm full.

530
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:55,634
How come you've stayed with the coach?

531
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:57,594
You don't like him much.

532
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,222
I wasn't brought up to leave a husband.

533
00:55:00,388 --> 00:55:02,432
I guess that's why.

534
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,935
Maybe I was just scared to.

535
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:08,855
I never noticed how ugly this room is.

536
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:10,607
What's your favourite colour?

537
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,234
I don't know. Blue.

538
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,237
- Maybe I'll re-paper it.
- Why'd you marry him?

539
00:55:15,403 --> 00:55:16,571
I don't know.

540
00:55:16,738 --> 00:55:20,075
My mother didn't like him.
Maybe that was it.

541
00:55:20,408 --> 00:55:22,285
But I was 20 years old.

542
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:26,623
I thought hairy-chested
football coaches were about it.

543
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,668
I'm gonna buy us a new quilt.

544
00:55:29,835 --> 00:55:31,419
A blue one.

545
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,090
What you think he'd do if he found us?

546
00:55:35,257 --> 00:55:37,509
Shoot us, probably.

547
00:55:37,676 --> 00:55:41,179
He's always glad to have an excuse
to use his deer rifle.

548
00:55:58,697 --> 00:56:00,740
I thought you boys wanted to fish.

549
00:56:00,907 --> 00:56:03,535
Come on. Keep an eye on them corks, Billy.

550
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:12,294
I don't think there's anything
in this tank except turtles.

551
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,171
That's what I like about it,
tell you the truth.

552
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:18,008
- Wanna try one?
- Sure.

553
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:23,555
I never liked to clean fish
or eat them either.

554
00:56:23,722 --> 00:56:26,808
You spend half your time picking out bone.

555
00:56:29,227 --> 00:56:31,855
I just come out here
to get a little scenery.

556
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,774
Too pretty a day to spend in town.

557
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,907
You wouldn't believe
how this country's changed.

558
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:48,580
First time I seen it,
there wasn't a mesquite tree on it.

559
00:56:48,747 --> 00:56:50,999
Or a prickly pear neither.

560
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:53,668
I used to own this land, you know.

561
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:57,547
First time I watered a horse at this tank...

562
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,133
...was more than 40 years ago.

563
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:04,346
I reckon the reason
I always drag you out here is...

564
00:57:04,512 --> 00:57:08,934
...I'm just as sentimental as the next
feller when it comes to old times.

565
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,774
Old times.

566
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:18,985
I brought a young lady
swimming out here once...

567
00:57:19,152 --> 00:57:21,488
...more than 20 years ago.

568
00:57:24,157 --> 00:57:26,993
It was after my wife had lost her mind.

569
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,537
And my boys was dead.

570
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:36,670
Me and this young lady was pretty wild,
lguess.

571
00:57:37,337 --> 00:57:39,297
In pretty deep.

572
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:46,221
We used to come here on horseback
and swim without no bathing suits.

573
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:53,269
One day, she wanted to swim
the horses across this tank.

574
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:56,773
Kind of a crazy thing to do,
but we done it anyway.

575
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:01,277
She bet me a silver dollar
she could beat me across.

576
00:58:01,903 --> 00:58:03,571
She did.

577
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:08,368
This old horse I was riding
didn't wanna take the water.

578
00:58:08,535 --> 00:58:12,497
But she was always looking
for something to do like that.

579
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,625
Something wild.

580
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,547
I'll bet she's still got that silver dollar.

581
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:25,218
Whatever happened to her?

582
00:58:26,386 --> 00:58:28,304
Oh, she growed up.

583
00:58:29,055 --> 00:58:31,641
She was just a girl then, really.

584
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,854
Here, let me help you with that.

585
00:58:36,938 --> 00:58:40,150
Why didn't you ever marry her
after your wife died?

586
00:58:42,235 --> 00:58:44,487
She was already married.

587
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:52,579
Her and her husband was young
and miserable with one another...

588
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:55,540
...like so many young married folks are.

589
00:58:55,957 --> 00:58:59,002
I thought they'd change with some age...

590
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:01,087
...but it didn't turn out that way.

591
00:59:01,254 --> 00:59:04,090
- Is being married always so miserable?
- No. Not really.

592
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:07,302
About 80 percent of the time, I guess.

593
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,974
We ought to go
to a real fishing tank next year.

594
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:16,895
It don't do to think
about things like that too much.

595
00:59:18,605 --> 00:59:21,316
If she was here,
I'd probably be just as crazy now...

596
00:59:21,483 --> 00:59:24,652
...as I was then in about five minutes.

597
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,072
Ain't that ridiculous?

598
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,242
No, it ain't really.

599
00:59:31,409 --> 00:59:35,955
Being crazy about a woman like her
is always the right thing to do.

600
00:59:37,582 --> 00:59:41,461
Being a decrepit, old bag of bones,
that's what's ridiculous.

601
00:59:41,628 --> 00:59:43,588
Getting old.

602
01:00:35,473 --> 01:00:37,350
My God, I'm glad I wasn't on fire.

603
01:00:37,517 --> 01:00:40,645
I would've burned to death
before you got one button undone.

604
01:00:40,812 --> 01:00:43,439
I'm going to get a drink of water.

605
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,822
Hi.

606
01:00:50,989 --> 01:00:54,534
I wondered where you went.
Annie-Annie asleep?

607
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:56,369
Yeah.

608
01:01:11,176 --> 01:01:14,012
Nice. You a virgin?

609
01:01:15,054 --> 01:01:16,472
Guess I am.

610
01:01:17,682 --> 01:01:18,725
Too bad.

611
01:01:20,185 --> 01:01:23,062
- I don't wanna be, though.
- I don't blame you.

612
01:01:23,688 --> 01:01:25,523
Come see me when you're not.

613
01:01:50,423 --> 01:01:54,093
Why don't we just go someplace?
I'm sick and tired of this town.

614
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:57,055
- You're the only friend I got.
- You mean, go and stay gone?

615
01:01:57,222 --> 01:01:59,140
No, I don't know.

616
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:02,977
Hey, we go to Mexico.
Be back sometime Monday.

617
01:02:03,144 --> 01:02:06,272
- You reckon the pickup would make it?
- Yeah. How much money you got?

618
01:02:06,439 --> 01:02:07,857
Oh, 30 bucks about.

619
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:10,193
Well, I got 40. We can make it. Come on!

620
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,861
Okay.

621
01:02:12,946 --> 01:02:14,572
You boys want--? Hey.

622
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:16,824
- Where are you going?
- Mexico.

623
01:02:16,991 --> 01:02:18,451
Where?

624
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:28,127
Better come with us, Sam.
We're headed for the valley.

625
01:02:28,294 --> 01:02:30,171
- Going where did you say?
- Mexico.

626
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:32,632
- It's about the wildest.
- All the way down.

627
01:02:33,258 --> 01:02:37,345
You going all the way to Mexico tonight
in this old heap of junk?

628
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:38,846
My God.

629
01:02:39,013 --> 01:02:42,183
Reckon the town will get along
without us till Monday?

630
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:43,393
I reckon.

631
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,521
If I was young enough to bounce,
I'd probably go with you.

632
01:02:46,688 --> 01:02:49,482
- Need any money?
- No, we got plenty.

633
01:02:49,649 --> 01:02:53,820
Well, you'd better take some
for some insurance.

634
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:57,240
Take money below that border,
it sort of melts sometimes.

635
01:02:57,407 --> 01:02:58,992
Thanks, Sam.

636
01:02:59,534 --> 01:03:02,203
Try not to drink too much
of that buggy water.

637
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:05,915
We'll just drink beer and tequila.

638
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:09,961
You catch the clap,
you'll wish you hadn't drunk nothing.

639
01:03:22,348 --> 01:03:24,100
Oh, Well.

640
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,476
We'll see you.

641
01:03:25,643 --> 01:03:27,603
So long!

642
01:03:57,842 --> 01:04:00,511
Duane. Hey, wake up!

643
01:04:00,678 --> 01:04:02,263
We're back.

644
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,768
My stomach don't feel so good.
Got any more of those Tums?

645
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:10,730
You ate them all
before we got to San Antone.

646
01:04:12,023 --> 01:04:15,777
Genevieve will have something.
My stomach don't feel so good.

647
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:19,364
"Closed."

648
01:04:19,864 --> 01:04:21,491
Closed?

649
01:04:21,908 --> 01:04:23,201
Yeah.

650
01:04:23,368 --> 01:04:25,620
I ain't never seen her closed before.

651
01:04:25,787 --> 01:04:28,373
No, not even for Christmas.

652
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:33,086
Maybe Sam will have something. I'm sick.

653
01:04:55,566 --> 01:04:57,735
Well, it ain't that early.

654
01:04:57,902 --> 01:04:59,570
Must be some kind of holiday.

655
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:02,281
Sam don't close on holidays.

656
01:05:02,448 --> 01:05:05,034
Maybe he had to go someplace.

657
01:05:08,454 --> 01:05:10,039
Well, let's go ask Andy.

658
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:11,833
Okay.

659
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:26,848
- Hey, Andy. Hey, where is everybody?
- Somebody will steal the town.

660
01:05:27,014 --> 01:05:28,808
Asleep. Everybody that's got any sense.

661
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:31,477
Why'd Sam close the café?

662
01:05:31,644 --> 01:05:34,522
Oh, yeah. Y'all been gone, ain't you?

663
01:05:34,689 --> 01:05:36,482
Gone to Mexico.

664
01:05:36,649 --> 01:05:38,693
- You don't know about it.
- About what?

665
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,653
Sam died yesterday morning.

666
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:43,573
Died?

667
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,575
Yep. Quite a blow.

668
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:49,579
Keeled over one of the snooker tables.
Had a stroke.

669
01:05:50,121 --> 01:05:53,207
- Sam the Lion?
- Yep.

670
01:05:53,374 --> 01:05:54,542
Sam's dead.

671
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:56,836
He was quite a feller.

672
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:01,883
He had his own way of doing things,
that's for sure.

673
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:06,846
They found his will.
Craziest thing you ever heard.

674
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:11,142
He left you the pool hall, Sonny.
What do you think about that?

675
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:14,729
He left Genevieve the cafe.

676
01:06:14,896 --> 01:06:18,274
That's the only thing he done
that made any sense.

677
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:21,152
Left the picture show to old Miss Mosey.

678
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:25,323
Hell, she's too far gone
to even run a popcorn machine.

679
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:27,366
And the craziest thing of all...

680
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:31,621
...he left $1000 to Joe Bob Blanton,
the preacher's boy.

681
01:06:32,163 --> 01:06:34,582
Beats all I ever heard of.

682
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:37,376
He could just as easily left that to me.

683
01:06:37,543 --> 01:06:41,506
I deserve it at least as much
as that ignorant little bastard.

684
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,884
Anyhow, it's done.

685
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:47,386
They're burying him tomorrow.

686
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:10,488
Come in.

687
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:28,422
- I love you.
- I love you too.

688
01:09:58,869 --> 01:10:00,413
Oh, Duane, hurry.

689
01:10:35,573 --> 01:10:37,032
What's wrong, honey?

690
01:10:38,951 --> 01:10:40,828
I don't know.

691
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:44,582
That tickles.
You know I can't stand to be tickled.

692
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:55,968
What's the matter? Aren't you gonna do it?

693
01:10:57,136 --> 01:10:58,429
I don't know what's wrong.

694
01:10:58,596 --> 01:11:02,266
How could anything be wrong?
Just go on and do it.

695
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:07,855
Oh, what's the matter with you?

696
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,649
I don't know. Something's happened.

697
01:11:10,816 --> 01:11:13,819
Well, get off a minute!
You might fall and mash me.

698
01:11:13,986 --> 01:11:15,446
I don't know what happened.

699
01:11:15,613 --> 01:11:18,365
It was Mexico.
No telling what you got down there.

700
01:11:18,532 --> 01:11:21,243
I just hate you! I don't know
why I ever went with you.

701
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:22,661
I don't know what happened.

702
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:28,834
Put your clothes on. You think I wanna
sit around here and look at you naked?

703
01:11:30,795 --> 01:11:33,547
I knew you couldn't do it.
Now I'll never not be a virgin!

704
01:11:33,714 --> 01:11:36,008
What do we tell everybody?
The whole class knows.

705
01:11:36,175 --> 01:11:38,594
I just wanna cry.
You're the meanest boy I ever saw.

706
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,971
My mother was dead-right about you.

707
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:43,808
I don't know what happened.

708
01:11:43,974 --> 01:11:46,852
Don't go out there! We haven't had time
to do it. They'd know.

709
01:11:47,019 --> 01:11:50,272
I don't want one soul to know.
You better not tell one soul.

710
01:11:50,856 --> 01:11:52,817
You just pretend it was wonderful!

711
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:55,444
Well, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.

712
01:11:56,403 --> 01:11:58,489
If you say that one more time,
I'll bite you!

713
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:21,095
Tell us about it, Jacy. What was it like?

714
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,767
I just can't describe it.

715
01:12:26,934 --> 01:12:29,562
I just can't describe it in words.

716
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:13,355
Jacy.Jacy.

717
01:13:14,273 --> 01:13:16,984
I can do it now. I know I can.

718
01:13:17,985 --> 01:13:19,653
JacY.

719
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:54,939
Oh, quit prissing!
I don't think you did it right anyway.

720
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:06,700
Come on.

721
01:14:16,543 --> 01:14:20,255
It's your graduation present.
Hope you like it.

722
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:32,434
I never seen one as nice.

723
01:14:44,697 --> 01:14:46,657
<i>- Hello.
- Jacy?</i>

724
01:14:46,824 --> 01:14:48,534
What's on your feeble mind, Duane?

725
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:50,452
Same as it's been. I want a date.

726
01:14:51,578 --> 01:14:53,664
Why don't you just go back to Mexico?

727
01:14:53,831 --> 01:14:56,333
I guess girls are just easier
to please down there.

728
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,627
Just go with me one more time.

729
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:00,379
<i>You can at least see me.</i>

730
01:15:00,546 --> 01:15:03,007
Find somebody else to pester.
Got a new boyfriend.

731
01:15:03,173 --> 01:15:05,259
<i>- And I can't be talking to you.</i>
- Who?

732
01:15:05,426 --> 01:15:07,011
- Bobby Sheen, of course.
- Bobby Sheen?

733
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:10,639
- You crazy?
- I certainly am not.

734
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:14,560
I guess I wanted to go with him all along
and never realised it.

735
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:17,604
Maybe we'll see you in Wichita sometime.

736
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:35,539
Goddamn it! Goddamn it to hell!

737
01:15:47,092 --> 01:15:48,510
I hate to see you go, Duane.

738
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,888
Not a goddamn thing to stay for.

739
01:15:51,055 --> 01:15:54,224
Roughnecks say you can get a job
out in Odessa anytime.

740
01:15:54,767 --> 01:15:56,977
Come on back if you don't.

741
01:16:09,907 --> 01:16:12,201
Hey, listen, you hear they busted up,
let me know.

742
01:16:40,521 --> 01:16:43,273
<i>Why don't we watch the movie?</i>

743
01:16:47,653 --> 01:16:48,695
Hi. Didn't hear you.

744
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:50,864
Gene home?

745
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:53,784
No, he and Mama went to the club.

746
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:01,792
What are you doing home on a Saturday night?

747
01:17:03,127 --> 01:17:05,462
Bobby Sheen ran off and got married.

748
01:17:08,298 --> 01:17:09,842
Annie-Annie Martin.

749
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,097
Want me to turn the TV off?

750
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:19,726
No, I'm gonna go play some pool.
Tell your dad that well came in okay.

751
01:17:21,019 --> 01:17:23,981
I wish I could go to the pool hall.
I've always wanted to.

752
01:17:24,148 --> 01:17:27,442
It's terrible,
the things girls aren't allowed to do.

753
01:17:29,153 --> 01:17:32,322
Well, hell, come on.
I'll show you the pool hall.

754
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:33,824
Aren't there people there?

755
01:17:33,991 --> 01:17:36,660
If there are, they'll be in back asleep now.

756
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:40,038
Won't bother us. Got my own key.

757
01:17:41,248 --> 01:17:43,458
Okay, I will then.

758
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:02,060
Goodness, it sure is dark in here.

759
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:06,328
What a night! I never thought
something like this would happen.

760
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:10,207
How about hopping out?

761
01:21:23,553 --> 01:21:26,765
<i>And in Chicago today,
Governor Adlai E. Stevenson accepted...</i>

762
01:21:26,932 --> 01:21:28,934
<i>...the Democratic presidential nomination...</i>

763
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:32,396
<i>...and picked Senator John Sparkman
of Alabama to be his running mate.</i>

764
01:21:33,647 --> 01:21:36,233
<i>In Dallas county,
General Dwight D. Eisenhower scored...</i>

765
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,277
<i>...a second landslide victory
over old-guard Republican forces.</i>

766
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:47,744
Oh, he's just awful, Mama!
Why do you fool with him?

767
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:50,789
- Daddy's nicer than him, isn't he?
- He sure is, beautiful.

768
01:21:50,956 --> 01:21:52,916
Your daddy's a very nice man.

769
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:55,877
I ought to been giving Abilene hell
instead of him.

770
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:59,423
Bobby was the last one.
I'm just gonna be an old maid.

771
01:21:59,589 --> 01:22:03,468
That's just the way it goes sometimes.
You win a few, you lose a few.

772
01:22:03,635 --> 01:22:04,928
What do you do?

773
01:22:05,095 --> 01:22:07,222
Nothing's ever the way it's supposed to be.

774
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:09,558
You're right. Come on.

775
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:17,023
I want to tell you, what I've done
has not worked out too well.

776
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:21,153
I think maybe we better think
of something else for you.

777
01:22:22,821 --> 01:22:26,199
Right now, I guess Ruth Popper's got
about as good a setup as anyone.

778
01:22:26,366 --> 01:22:30,328
Why, sure. Sonny's reasonably
good-looking and he's young.

779
01:22:30,495 --> 01:22:33,707
Don't you know about that? It's been
going on about six months now.

780
01:22:33,874 --> 01:22:36,501
- I thought you kids knew everything.
- That's silly!

781
01:22:36,668 --> 01:22:38,086
She's 40 years old.

782
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:41,089
So am I, honey. It's kind of an itchy age.

783
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:42,883
Want an orange?

784
01:22:43,049 --> 01:22:45,093
I don't believe it.

785
01:22:45,552 --> 01:22:48,722
Sonny's always wanted to go with me.

786
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:55,937
Pretty easy shot, sheriff.

787
01:23:04,488 --> 01:23:05,864
Sheriff, we got some trouble.

788
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:10,994
Goddamn you, Monroe! You made me scratch.

789
01:23:11,161 --> 01:23:15,248
Sorry, sheriff, but Johnny Clarg's
little girl's kind of been kidnapped.

790
01:23:15,415 --> 01:23:18,668
They say the preacher's boy put her
in his car two hours ago.

791
01:23:18,835 --> 01:23:22,964
Well, what the hell? Maybe Joe Bob
just give her a ride home.

792
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:25,759
Be doing her a favour in this hot weather.

793
01:23:25,926 --> 01:23:28,553
Who'd want to kidnap Molly Clarg?

794
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,514
I just know she's not home.

795
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,766
They was seen headed
out of town toward Olney.

796
01:23:32,933 --> 01:23:36,102
Well, Mrs Clarg's kind of afraid
that Joe Bob might be...

797
01:23:36,269 --> 01:23:39,564
- ...gonna molest her or something.
- Sonny.

798
01:23:39,731 --> 01:23:41,691
You and some of these boys come with us.

799
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:46,029
If that's the way it is,
no telling what we'll find.

800
01:24:12,097 --> 01:24:15,433
Molly! Molly!

801
01:24:18,645 --> 01:24:20,730
Get him! Ain't you going to?

802
01:24:21,273 --> 01:24:22,566
Here's my little girl.

803
01:24:22,732 --> 01:24:25,652
He's the one that done it.
Why don't you get him?

804
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:28,989
If my husband was here, he'd kill him dead.

805
01:24:34,327 --> 01:24:37,414
What did you do to that child?
We know you done something.

806
01:24:37,581 --> 01:24:38,957
Come on.

807
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,961
Filthy!

808
01:24:43,128 --> 01:24:46,631
Here now, grab her.
None of this goddamn frenzy.

809
01:24:46,798 --> 01:24:49,676
Filthy! Filthy! Filthy!

810
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,221
It's the Lord's justice, son.

811
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:55,765
You'll suffer with the murderer
and the thief.

812
01:24:55,932 --> 01:25:00,353
Sonny, drive that Plymouth to town.
We gotta get this man to jail.

813
01:25:09,946 --> 01:25:12,782
- Doctor said he didn't do nothing.
- Never had the guts.

814
01:25:12,949 --> 01:25:15,410
- Preacher's boy.
- Sheriff figured he done something.

815
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:16,995
Yeah.

816
01:25:23,168 --> 01:25:26,087
Isn't it terrible, Sonny? Were you there?
Did you see anything?

817
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,465
Oh, weren't nothing to see except Mrs Clarg.

818
01:25:28,632 --> 01:25:31,259
If she had a gun,
she might've killed us all.

819
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,011
Joe Bob didn't do nothing.

820
01:25:33,178 --> 01:25:36,514
He must've done something.
It scares me to death.

821
01:25:36,681 --> 01:25:40,101
You just never can tell when something
terrible's gonna happen.

822
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:43,480
It's okay. They got him now.

823
01:25:43,647 --> 01:25:45,398
I called you before.

824
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:47,317
You did?

825
01:25:48,318 --> 01:25:49,611
I felt lonesome.

826
01:25:49,778 --> 01:25:51,905
Thought you might wanna drive around awhile.

827
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:57,786
Well, I'm supposed to be someplace.

828
01:25:57,952 --> 01:26:01,790
I'm still a little scared.
Please take me riding.

829
01:26:06,378 --> 01:26:08,922
Well, where will we drive?

830
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,283
You ever hear from Duane?

831
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:38,702
Got a postcard.

832
01:26:38,868 --> 01:26:41,663
I really feel sad about that.

833
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:45,417
He's-- He's making 320 a month.
Said he bought a car.

834
01:26:46,418 --> 01:26:48,420
I guess I'll always be a little bit
in love with Duane.

835
01:26:48,586 --> 01:26:51,297
We had too much against us.

836
01:26:51,631 --> 01:26:54,592
It wasn't easy being the one to break up.

837
01:27:23,997 --> 01:27:26,166
- Sonny.
- What?

838
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,556
Not here.

839
01:28:23,723 --> 01:28:26,893
I'm too old for screwing in cars.

840
01:28:29,854 --> 01:28:32,148
I don't like to hurry.

841
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:36,611
Why don't we go to Wichita
and get a motel room?

842
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:39,656
I'm afraid to.
I think my folks are watching me.

843
01:28:39,823 --> 01:28:41,574
They know I don't wanna go to college.

844
01:28:41,741 --> 01:28:44,536
They might think we're gonna run off
and get married.

845
01:28:46,538 --> 01:28:49,082
We'll do it when it's safe.

846
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:52,335
We got all summer.

847
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:47,265
- Hey, Duane.
- Hey, buddy!

848
01:29:48,433 --> 01:29:49,601
You turned roughneck.

849
01:29:49,767 --> 01:29:52,312
Gotta make a living
so I can keep the pool hall open.

850
01:29:52,478 --> 01:29:53,521
When'd you get in?

851
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:56,774
About 2. I thought I'd surprise you.

852
01:29:58,151 --> 01:29:59,277
Is this yours?

853
01:29:59,444 --> 01:30:03,114
Yeah, how about that? Thirty-eight
thousand miles, and she runs like new.

854
01:30:03,281 --> 01:30:05,116
- Say, you want a beer?
- Not me.

855
01:30:05,658 --> 01:30:07,994
That's about all I eat
for breakfast anymore.

856
01:30:08,161 --> 01:30:10,371
Hey, sure is a nice car.

857
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:14,709
Yeah, I like to drive it so much, I thought
I'd just drop home for the weekend.

858
01:30:16,252 --> 01:30:19,797
Yeah, you can't take too good care
of a car like this.

859
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:21,591
I wash her every week.

860
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:24,344
Oh, it looks great.

861
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:25,929
Hear about Joe Bob?

862
01:30:26,095 --> 01:30:28,348
Yeah, I always knew he was crazy.

863
01:30:28,514 --> 01:30:32,727
He didn't do nothing, except get her
to take her underpants off.

864
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:35,480
- He's out of jail now.
- Yeah.

865
01:30:35,647 --> 01:30:37,982
Are you still screwing that old lady?

866
01:30:38,858 --> 01:30:41,653
No. Yeah. I've been kind of busy.

867
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,656
I seen old Leroy last week.

868
01:30:44,822 --> 01:30:47,492
He said he thought you and Jacy
had been going together.

869
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:49,452
Yeah, we have, a little.

870
01:30:49,619 --> 01:30:53,206
She's been kind of bored, so once
in a while, we go eat Mexican food.

871
01:30:53,373 --> 01:30:55,750
Well, I hear that ain't all you been eating.

872
01:30:56,793 --> 01:31:00,213
Well, whoever told you that don't know
what he's talking about.

873
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:02,256
Sure, I've been going with her. Why not?

874
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:05,468
I never said I blamed you for it.
I don't blame you much.

875
01:31:05,635 --> 01:31:08,554
I never thought you'd do that.
I thought we were best friends.

876
01:31:08,721 --> 01:31:12,141
We are. What you so mad for?
I never done nothing.

877
01:31:12,308 --> 01:31:14,894
- Screwing my girl ain't nothing?
- I ain't screwing her.

878
01:31:15,061 --> 01:31:17,480
- Hell, you ain't!
- Well, I ain't.

879
01:31:17,647 --> 01:31:19,357
- She's not your girl.
- She is my girl!

880
01:31:19,524 --> 01:31:21,317
You don't even live here anymore.

881
01:31:21,484 --> 01:31:24,237
That don't make no difference!
I'm getting her back.

882
01:31:24,404 --> 01:31:26,197
She's gonna marry me one of these days.

883
01:31:26,364 --> 01:31:28,658
- She won't.
- We're meant to get married.

884
01:31:28,825 --> 01:31:30,034
She's off to college soon.

885
01:31:30,201 --> 01:31:33,830
I doubt I'll ever get to go
with her again myself, once she gets off.

886
01:31:33,997 --> 01:31:37,000
I never saw what it could hurt
to go with her this summer though.

887
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:40,628
- She's never gonna marry you.
- She is! Don't tell me she won't!

888
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:42,964
She'd never let you screw her.
That's for sure.

889
01:31:43,131 --> 01:31:45,550
Hell, I was just seeing how honest you was.

890
01:31:45,717 --> 01:31:49,012
Jacy would never let you screw her.
You ain't that good a cocksman.

891
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:52,306
You never even screwed
Charlene Duggs all that time.

892
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:53,516
Course I didn't!

893
01:31:53,683 --> 01:31:54,934
You know why?

894
01:31:55,101 --> 01:31:58,312
Because you had the pickup
all the time Saturday night, that's why.

895
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:00,231
Nobody could've screwed in the time I had.

896
01:32:00,398 --> 01:32:03,317
I could've screwed her in five minutes.
I wouldn't need no pickup.

897
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:08,698
She only went with you because you was
in the backfield and I was in the line.

898
01:32:08,865 --> 01:32:10,908
What you talking about? We was in love.

899
01:32:11,075 --> 01:32:14,245
Oh, you was. She likes me
just as much as she ever liked you.

900
01:32:14,704 --> 01:32:17,373
- That's a lie.
<i>- I'll</i> stay with her all night too.

901
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,042
- She promised.
- You won't either.

902
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:20,376
I Will. Why Shouldn't I?

903
01:32:20,543 --> 01:32:24,088
She done told me you couldn't even do it
that time in Wichita Falls.

904
01:32:46,986 --> 01:32:49,030
What happened?

905
01:32:51,783 --> 01:32:52,909
Sonny?

906
01:32:53,576 --> 01:32:56,579
<i>This is your turntable matinee
here on KTRN...</i>

907
01:32:56,746 --> 01:33:01,501
<i>...where you can hear Fulton Lewis, Jr
every Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.</i>

908
01:33:01,667 --> 01:33:04,045
<i>Now here's Hank Williams.</i>

909
01:33:04,796 --> 01:33:08,341
There's a lady in the waiting room.
She sent you this.

910
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:22,605
Could you tell her I'm asleep?

911
01:33:23,147 --> 01:33:24,524
Please?

912
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:26,359
All right.

913
01:33:52,385 --> 01:33:53,636
That too cold?

914
01:33:53,803 --> 01:33:55,680
No, it's great.

915
01:33:57,181 --> 01:33:59,934
Say, I hear Duane joined the Army.

916
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:02,145
Good place for him too.

917
01:34:02,311 --> 01:34:04,772
He didn't mean to hit me with the bottle.

918
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:08,025
That boy's always had meanness in him.

919
01:34:08,401 --> 01:34:11,487
Jacy's just the kind of girl
that brings out the meanness in a man.

920
01:34:11,654 --> 01:34:14,240
She's just like her grandmother.

921
01:34:16,492 --> 01:34:20,371
I hadn't ought to talk about them.
We was all good friends once.

922
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:24,041
Dan roughnecked with Gene Farrow.

923
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,044
He and Lois used to live
in this one-room place...

924
01:34:27,211 --> 01:34:29,505
...over the newspaper office.

925
01:34:29,672 --> 01:34:33,718
Lois couldn't afford a flour sack,
much less a mink.

926
01:34:35,928 --> 01:34:39,182
I've always had a soft spot for her, though.

927
01:34:41,058 --> 01:34:44,061
Yeah, I wondered a lot of times
what would've happened...

928
01:34:44,228 --> 01:34:46,856
...if my Dan had made the strikes
that Gene made.

929
01:34:47,023 --> 01:34:49,859
They offered that rig to him first.

930
01:34:50,735 --> 01:34:52,153
YUP-

931
01:34:53,571 --> 01:34:57,283
Dan Morgan never took a chance in his life.

932
01:34:57,742 --> 01:34:59,327
Do you wish y'all had made it?

933
01:35:03,331 --> 01:35:06,083
Sure, I wish we'd made it.

934
01:35:08,252 --> 01:35:11,797
I guess the Army won't take me now,
I just got one good eye.

935
01:35:11,964 --> 01:35:14,342
You wanna go over to Korea
and get yourself killed?

936
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:19,138
You ain't got your senses back yet,
what few you ever had.

937
01:35:20,097 --> 01:35:22,600
The café won't run itself. You rest up now.

938
01:35:22,767 --> 01:35:24,936
Here's for the cheeseburger.

939
01:35:25,102 --> 01:35:27,605
Okay, I'll bring your change
when I bring your supper.

940
01:35:27,772 --> 01:35:29,273
Thanks.

941
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:57,760
Sonny?

942
01:35:59,762 --> 01:36:01,597
Oh, come on in.

943
01:36:01,764 --> 01:36:04,684
<i>"I Can't Help It." Hank Williams.
Big sound from last year.</i>

944
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:07,812
<i>Now here's a brand-new one,
just came in from Webb Pierce.</i>

945
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:09,855
<i>Gonna hear it a lot, I bet.</i>

946
01:36:10,022 --> 01:36:12,108
Oh, I was so worried. I just had to see you.

947
01:36:12,275 --> 01:36:13,985
Oh, I've been missing you.

948
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:17,488
And I'm a lot better than I was.
Here, sit down.

949
01:36:17,863 --> 01:36:21,534
You can't believe how famous we are.
We're all anybody talks about in town.

950
01:36:21,701 --> 01:36:24,245
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I want us to get married.

951
01:36:24,912 --> 01:36:26,998
- What?
- I really do.

952
01:36:27,164 --> 01:36:28,207
Get married?

953
01:36:28,374 --> 01:36:30,584
Just as soon as you want to.
Don't you want to?

954
01:36:31,002 --> 01:36:33,045
Oh, yeah.

955
01:36:33,212 --> 01:36:36,632
I bet the town will be knocked for a loop.
They'll never forget it.

956
01:36:36,799 --> 01:36:38,342
Ain't you going to college?

957
01:36:38,509 --> 01:36:42,221
I don't care about that.
I love you, and that's more important.

958
01:36:43,014 --> 01:36:45,016
You were so dear to fight for me.

959
01:36:45,182 --> 01:36:47,184
My folks won't like it, but we'll run off.

960
01:36:47,351 --> 01:36:49,228
- They'll kill us.
- No, they won't.

961
01:36:49,395 --> 01:36:51,314
- They'll kill me.
- They'll get over it.

962
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,316
You're working for Daddy now anyway.

963
01:36:53,482 --> 01:36:56,861
Pretty soon, they'll love you
just as much as I do.

964
01:36:59,405 --> 01:37:01,240
Can we?

965
01:37:01,407 --> 01:37:04,618
Sure, I just hope I can see to drive.

966
01:37:04,785 --> 01:37:07,413
Don't you worry. I can drive.

967
01:37:17,256 --> 01:37:19,175
Don't do that, Sonny.

968
01:37:19,342 --> 01:37:21,010
Why not?

969
01:37:21,177 --> 01:37:23,471
We're man and wife now. We can do anything.

970
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:26,640
Not while I'm driving. I might have a wreck.

971
01:37:27,016 --> 01:37:31,228
Goodness. Wouldn't it be awful if Mama
and Daddy got the police after us?

972
01:37:31,395 --> 01:37:34,774
- They don't even know where we are.
- Well, I had to leave them a note.

973
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:37,568
So they wouldn't be worried
out of their mind.

974
01:37:37,735 --> 01:37:39,403
Oh, you shouldn't have done that.

975
01:37:39,570 --> 01:37:41,947
I figured they'd have to know sometime.

976
01:37:42,114 --> 01:37:44,283
Well, what could they get us for?

977
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:47,453
We got a right to get married. Ain't we?

978
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:49,705
I guess so.

979
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:55,920
I wish you didn't have
that stupid eye patch. It's really creepy.

980
01:37:56,087 --> 01:37:59,090
Oh, hey, I can take it off pretty soon.

981
01:37:59,799 --> 01:38:04,470
About two hours, will be Lake Texoma.
Have a room to ourself.

982
01:38:04,637 --> 01:38:08,557
My goodness! You're sitting so close,
I can barely drive.

983
01:38:35,167 --> 01:38:36,460
Oh, goodness.

984
01:38:59,733 --> 01:39:00,776
Howdy.

985
01:39:00,943 --> 01:39:03,279
- What part of Texas y'all from?
- Anarene.

986
01:39:03,446 --> 01:39:05,656
Newlyweds, ain't you?

987
01:39:05,823 --> 01:39:09,326
Y'all better follow me on in.
I think somebody's looking for you.

988
01:39:09,493 --> 01:39:12,371
We got a right to get married.
How can you arrest us?

989
01:39:12,538 --> 01:39:15,916
I ain't arresting you.
I just want you to come with me.

990
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:17,751
I don't know what your rights are.

991
01:39:17,918 --> 01:39:19,795
I guess we better follow him, honey.

992
01:39:19,962 --> 01:39:22,506
I'll just be heartbroken
if my folks have done this.

993
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:31,515
You think I worked hard so my daughter
could end up in a pool hall?

994
01:39:31,682 --> 01:39:34,059
- We was gonna get another apartment.
- I'll bet!

995
01:39:34,226 --> 01:39:35,311
Where are your car keys?

996
01:39:35,478 --> 01:39:37,730
It's a hell of a note! Just a hell of a note!

997
01:39:37,897 --> 01:39:40,566
- Oh, shut up and take her home.
- You bet I will!

998
01:39:40,733 --> 01:39:44,695
You take her car.
As far as I'm concerned, he can walk!

999
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:15,976
- Not much of a wedding night, huh?
- Nope.

1000
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:17,228
Not much of one.

1001
01:40:17,394 --> 01:40:20,856
Here. Have a little drink of bourbon.
It'll pick you up.

1002
01:40:21,023 --> 01:40:23,609
Take all of it. I'm gonna drive.

1003
01:40:25,736 --> 01:40:26,904
You won't believe this...

1004
01:40:27,071 --> 01:40:30,699
...but you're lucky we got you
clear of her quick as we did.

1005
01:40:30,866 --> 01:40:33,827
You'd have been a lot better off
staying with Ruth Popper.

1006
01:40:33,994 --> 01:40:36,372
Does everybody know about that?

1007
01:40:36,539 --> 01:40:38,207
Course.

1008
01:40:38,374 --> 01:40:42,753
Sounded like a good deal to me, kiddo.
Shouldn't let Jacy turn your head.

1009
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:45,089
Well, she's prettier.

1010
01:40:45,839 --> 01:40:50,094
I guess I shouldn't have, though.
I guess I treated her terrible.

1011
01:40:50,261 --> 01:40:51,679
Guess you did.

1012
01:41:11,657 --> 01:41:13,534
Sure weren't out of Texas very long.

1013
01:41:13,701 --> 01:41:17,204
Well, Oklahoma's not much of an improvement.

1014
01:41:22,418 --> 01:41:24,712
It's not the same now.

1015
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:29,133
Nothing's really been right
since Sam the Lion died.

1016
01:41:32,052 --> 01:41:33,554
No.

1017
01:41:34,722 --> 01:41:36,932
No, it hasn't.

1018
01:41:40,269 --> 01:41:42,271
Oh, God.

1019
01:41:44,898 --> 01:41:47,860
I get sad if I think of Sam for long.

1020
01:41:51,447 --> 01:41:53,532
Did you know he had beautiful hands?

1021
01:41:55,409 --> 01:41:58,037
I guess you liked him, didn't you?

1022
01:41:58,662 --> 01:42:00,873
I guess everybody did.

1023
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:06,503
Well, I'll tell you,
it was different with me, Sonny.

1024
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:08,505
I loved him.

1025
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:11,592
He loved me too.

1026
01:42:15,054 --> 01:42:16,597
Are you--?

1027
01:42:17,264 --> 01:42:19,016
Are you the one he'd take swimming...

1028
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,060
...out at the tank?

1029
01:42:21,226 --> 01:42:23,812
He told you about that, huh?

1030
01:42:24,647 --> 01:42:26,148
Yeah, I was the one.

1031
01:42:29,777 --> 01:42:32,738
I guess if it wasn't for Sam, I'd...

1032
01:42:32,905 --> 01:42:36,784
...just about have missed it.
Whatever it is.

1033
01:42:37,993 --> 01:42:41,372
I'd have been one of them amity types
that thinks that...

1034
01:42:41,538 --> 01:42:45,542
...playing bridge is about
the best thing that life has to offer.

1035
01:42:53,008 --> 01:42:55,552
Old Sam the Lion.

1036
01:42:58,055 --> 01:43:02,685
Sam the Lion. Nobody knows
where he got that name. I gave it to him.

1037
01:43:02,851 --> 01:43:04,436
One night...

1038
01:43:04,603 --> 01:43:07,773
...it just came to me.

1039
01:43:11,151 --> 01:43:13,362
He was so pleased.

1040
01:43:16,699 --> 01:43:19,493
I was 22 years old then.

1041
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:22,579
Can you imagine?

1042
01:43:26,291 --> 01:43:27,459
I tell you, Sonny...

1043
01:43:27,626 --> 01:43:29,586
...it's terrible to only meet one man
in your whole life...

1044
01:43:29,753 --> 01:43:31,880
...who knows what you're worth.

1045
01:43:33,298 --> 01:43:34,341
Just terrible.

1046
01:43:37,553 --> 01:43:39,513
I've looked too.

1047
01:43:40,889 --> 01:43:43,684
You wouldn't believe how I've looked.

1048
01:43:48,063 --> 01:43:52,443
- Well, now I know why Sam liked you.
- Loved me.

1049
01:43:52,609 --> 01:43:54,361
Loved you, I mean.

1050
01:43:55,154 --> 01:43:56,780
Do you?

1051
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:01,285
I can kind of see what he saw in you too.

1052
01:44:10,252 --> 01:44:12,588
Nope. I'll just go on home.

1053
01:44:12,755 --> 01:44:14,089
Go on. Get out.

1054
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:22,264
Think I could--?
Think I could learn to drink?

1055
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:31,023
You might. Better keep on practising.

1056
01:45:01,386 --> 01:45:03,806
That Logan boy's a quarterback,
now, ain't he?

1057
01:45:03,972 --> 01:45:06,558
Boy, we've finally got us a team!

1058
01:45:06,725 --> 01:45:08,977
Didn't back in your day, did they, Sonny?

1059
01:45:09,144 --> 01:45:10,771
No, we wasn't much good.

1060
01:45:10,938 --> 01:45:13,106
Well, you just never learned
the fundamentals.

1061
01:45:13,273 --> 01:45:16,068
You know, blocking and tackling.

1062
01:45:16,235 --> 01:45:17,903
Not like this team.

1063
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:20,447
- When was it you graduated?
- Last year.

1064
01:45:20,614 --> 01:45:21,740
You don't mean it.

1065
01:45:21,907 --> 01:45:25,244
Seems like longer than that
since you and old Duane played ball.

1066
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:26,954
I seen Duane a while ago.

1067
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,623
He's home on leave, wearing his uniform.

1068
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:32,042
I ain't seen him yet.

1069
01:45:37,256 --> 01:45:39,007
- How are you, Chester?
- Fine, coach.

1070
01:45:39,174 --> 01:45:42,427
Now, listen, see if we can't stretch
that goddamn thing a little.

1071
01:45:42,594 --> 01:45:47,182
You know a man never ought to cheat,
unless it's for a good cause.

1072
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:50,394
He's a good old boy, ain't he?

1073
01:46:42,696 --> 01:46:44,323
Hi, Mrs Jackson.

1074
01:46:44,489 --> 01:46:45,616
Duane here?

1075
01:46:45,782 --> 01:46:50,078
That's his car out there, ain't it?
He's here if he ain't walked off.

1076
01:46:57,878 --> 01:46:59,421
Hi, how you been?

1077
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,924
<i>Oh, pretty ggm</i>

1078
01:47:04,092 --> 01:47:06,887
I been thinking all week
that I'd run into you.

1079
01:47:07,054 --> 01:47:08,263
Yeah.

1080
01:47:09,514 --> 01:47:11,391
I heard you was going off to Korea.

1081
01:47:11,558 --> 01:47:14,519
Thought I'd get over here
and see you before you got off.

1082
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:18,649
Glad you did. I'm taking
the bus out early in the morning.

1083
01:47:26,281 --> 01:47:27,699
Want to go to the picture show?

1084
01:47:28,408 --> 01:47:31,078
Miss Mosey's having to close it.
Tonight's the last night.

1085
01:47:31,495 --> 01:47:33,455
Yeah, might as well go.

1086
01:47:33,622 --> 01:47:36,708
Hate to miss the last night.
Take the Mercury.

1087
01:47:36,875 --> 01:47:39,503
Be the last chance I'll have
to drive it for a while.

1088
01:47:45,759 --> 01:47:47,135
<i>Ready, Matthew?</i>

1089
01:47:47,302 --> 01:47:48,345
<i>All ready.</i>

1090
01:48:14,204 --> 01:48:16,581
<i>Take them to Missouri, Matt.</i>

1091
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,225
- That was a good movie.
- Yeah.

1092
01:49:17,392 --> 01:49:19,728
Seen it here before once.

1093
01:49:20,645 --> 01:49:23,190
Why don't we run over to Wichita
and drink some beer?

1094
01:49:23,356 --> 01:49:25,942
Okay. I got lots of time till morning.

1095
01:49:26,109 --> 01:49:27,360
Sure.

1096
01:49:29,154 --> 01:49:30,405
Well, so long, Miss Mosey.

1097
01:49:30,572 --> 01:49:31,907
Sorry you're closing the show.

1098
01:49:32,074 --> 01:49:34,618
Nobody wants to come to shows no more.

1099
01:49:35,077 --> 01:49:39,081
Kid baseball in the summer,
television all the time.

1100
01:49:40,290 --> 01:49:43,960
Sam had lived, I believe
we could've kept it going.

1101
01:49:44,127 --> 01:49:46,797
But I just didn't have the know-how.

1102
01:49:47,923 --> 01:49:50,300
Won't be much to do in town
with the picture show closed.

1103
01:49:50,467 --> 01:49:51,927
Yeah.

1104
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,722
Well, so long.

1105
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:57,057
Duane.

1106
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:00,393
You watch out now, overseas.

1107
01:50:23,458 --> 01:50:25,794
Sure weren't no women around.

1108
01:50:28,463 --> 01:50:31,424
I guess the next piece of ass
I get will be yellow.

1109
01:50:32,175 --> 01:50:33,969
I wish I was going with you.

1110
01:50:36,346 --> 01:50:38,306
Why don't you take care of the car for me?

1111
01:50:38,849 --> 01:50:40,350
Your ma don't need it?

1112
01:50:40,517 --> 01:50:43,562
I wouldn't want her driving it.
No better than she can drive.

1113
01:50:43,728 --> 01:50:46,064
Help her take the groceries home
if you got time.

1114
01:50:46,231 --> 01:50:47,607
Okay.

1115
01:50:59,953 --> 01:51:01,371
You ever--?

1116
01:51:01,538 --> 01:51:03,039
You ever hear from Jacy?

1117
01:51:03,832 --> 01:51:05,792
No, not a thing.

1118
01:51:05,959 --> 01:51:10,005
She don't get home much.
Ain't been back to town since August.

1119
01:51:10,172 --> 01:51:12,257
I guess she just stays in Dallas
all the time.

1120
01:51:12,966 --> 01:51:15,135
Yeah, probably does.

1121
01:51:16,261 --> 01:51:18,263
I guess there's lots to do down in Dallas.

1122
01:51:23,977 --> 01:51:26,438
I ain't over her yet, you know.

1123
01:51:28,523 --> 01:51:30,734
I ain't over her yet.

1124
01:51:31,610 --> 01:51:33,820
It's the damnedest thing.

1125
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:38,617
That's the only reason--

1126
01:51:38,783 --> 01:51:41,870
The only reason you and I got
into it that time, you know.

1127
01:51:43,788 --> 01:51:46,082
Hey, reckon she likes it down in Dallas?

1128
01:51:46,249 --> 01:51:47,918
It's hard to say. Maybe she does.

1129
01:51:51,421 --> 01:51:54,549
Reckon you and her would've got it
all straighted out if I hadn't butted in?

1130
01:51:54,716 --> 01:51:56,426
No.

1131
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:58,720
No.

1132
01:51:58,887 --> 01:52:01,848
No, they'd have annulled me too,
even if we had.

1133
01:52:03,892 --> 01:52:05,644
Y'all--?

1134
01:52:06,978 --> 01:52:08,855
Y'all never even got into the motel?

1135
01:52:09,481 --> 01:52:11,066
No.

1136
01:52:14,945 --> 01:52:16,571
Well...

1137
01:52:17,572 --> 01:52:20,367
...better get on before we both freeze.

1138
01:52:30,085 --> 01:52:31,962
Here are the keys.

1139
01:52:33,546 --> 01:52:36,174
- So long, buddy.
- So long, Duane.

1140
01:52:36,841 --> 01:52:38,593
Be careful.

1141
01:52:38,927 --> 01:52:40,470
I'll take care of the Mercury.

1142
01:52:40,637 --> 01:52:43,265
I'll see you in a year or two
if I don't get shot.

1143
01:54:12,937 --> 01:54:13,980
He ought to be in bed.

1144
01:54:14,147 --> 01:54:17,984
- The wind is blowing real hard.
- He was right out in front of that station.

1145
01:54:18,151 --> 01:54:20,403
Christ, the trucker didn't have a chance.

1146
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:23,198
Yeah, he's out here all the time
doing something.

1147
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:26,326
I can see it wasn't your fault.

1148
01:54:29,996 --> 01:54:33,041
The sand was blowing. I never noticed him.

1149
01:54:33,208 --> 01:54:34,751
Figured nobody'd be in the street.

1150
01:54:34,918 --> 01:54:37,462
What was he doing out there
carrying that broom?

1151
01:54:37,629 --> 01:54:40,548
He weren't doing nothing.
Just a simple-minded kid.

1152
01:54:40,715 --> 01:54:42,384
- Never had no sense.
- Wasn't your fault.

1153
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:44,469
Hell, no, mister! I can see that.

1154
01:54:44,636 --> 01:54:46,429
He was just a dumb old kid.

1155
01:54:46,596 --> 01:54:49,557
Didn't know enough
to keep his ass out of the cold.

1156
01:54:49,724 --> 01:54:51,726
Let's go to the café. Ain't had breakfast.

1157
01:54:51,893 --> 01:54:54,813
I'd still like to know
what he was doing with that broom.

1158
01:54:54,979 --> 01:54:57,816
He was sweeping, you sons of bitches!

1159
01:54:57,982 --> 01:55:00,026
He was sweeping!

1160
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:06,217
Y'all got some crazy kids in this town,
if you ask me.

1161
01:58:34,157 --> 01:58:35,366
Hi.

1162
01:58:39,662 --> 01:58:42,248
Could I have a cup of coffee with you?

1163
01:58:45,126 --> 01:58:46,919
I guess.

1164
01:58:55,386 --> 01:58:58,431
I'm sorry. I'm still in my bathrobe.

1165
01:59:20,203 --> 01:59:22,538
What am I doing apologising to you?

1166
01:59:22,705 --> 01:59:25,625
Why am I always apologising to you,
you little bastard?

1167
01:59:26,876 --> 01:59:29,962
Three months I've apologised to you
without you even being here!

1168
01:59:30,129 --> 01:59:33,800
I haven't done anything wrong.
Why can't I quit apologising?

1169
01:59:33,966 --> 01:59:35,468
You ought to be sorry!

1170
01:59:35,802 --> 01:59:38,096
I wouldn't still be in my bathrobe
if not for you.

1171
01:59:38,262 --> 01:59:40,139
I'd have my clothes on hours ago.

1172
01:59:40,306 --> 01:59:44,227
You're the one made me quit caring
if I got dressed or not!

1173
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:47,355
Just because your friend got killed...

1174
01:59:47,522 --> 01:59:51,067
...you want me to forget what you did
and make it all right.

1175
01:59:51,234 --> 01:59:53,361
I'm not sorry for you.

1176
01:59:53,528 --> 01:59:56,072
You'd have left Billy too,
just like you left me.

1177
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,282
I bet you left him plenty of nights...

1178
01:59:58,449 --> 02:00:00,326
...whenever Jacy whistled.

1179
02:00:00,493 --> 02:00:02,412
I wouldn't treat a dog that way.

1180
02:00:02,912 --> 02:00:07,333
You thought I was so old and ugly,
you didn't owe me any explanation.

1181
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,168
You didn't need to be careful of me.

1182
02:00:09,335 --> 02:00:12,588
There was nothing I could do
about you and her, so why be careful?

1183
02:00:12,755 --> 02:00:13,965
You didn't love me.

1184
02:00:14,882 --> 02:00:15,925
Look at me.

1185
02:00:17,927 --> 02:00:19,721
Can't you even look at me?

1186
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:34,193
See?

1187
02:00:35,236 --> 02:00:37,363
Shouldn't have come here.

1188
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:39,991
I'm around that corner now.

1189
02:00:40,867 --> 02:00:42,410
You've ruined it.

1190
02:00:42,577 --> 02:00:45,246
It's lost completely.

1191
02:00:47,373 --> 02:00:50,793
Just your needing me
won't make it come back.

1192
02:02:35,106 --> 02:02:37,692
Never you mind, honey.

1193
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:40,361
Never you mind.
