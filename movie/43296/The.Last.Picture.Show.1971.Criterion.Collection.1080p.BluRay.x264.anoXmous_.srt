1
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,030
You ain't ever gonna amount to nothin'.

2
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,830
Already spent a dime this morning
and ain't even had a decent breakfast.

3
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Give me the chalk.

4
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,750
Why don't you comb your hair, Sonny?
It sticks up. Look like you smelled a wolf.

5
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,740
I'm surprised you had the
nerve to show up this

6
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,150
mornin' after that stompin'
y'all took last night.

7
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,150
- Well, it could've been worse.
- What'd you say?

8
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,400
- Could've been worse.
- Yeah.

9
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,940
You could say that
about nearly everything, I guess.

10
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,620
A few football teams
have had some luck with tackling.

11
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,330
Keeps the other team
from scoring quite so often.

12
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,000
Sounds too rough for me.

13
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,340
- You don't even care if it was your last game.

14
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,140
You ain't ever gonna get stomped
for your own high school ball team again.

15
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,390
- Where's your school spirit?
- Don't know.

16
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,520
- You workin' today?
- No, the truck's being greased.

17
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,080
Now, you see, this is what I get
for bettin' on my hometown ball team.

18
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,590
I ought to have better sense.

19
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,680
Wouldn't hurt
if you had a better hometown.

20
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,640
Do you mind pointing that at the floor
till I get by?

21
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,230
I don't want my eye poked out.

22
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,270
- Don't let Billy get too far away, will you, son?

23
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,530
You're a damn sight more dangerous in a
pool hall than you are on a football field.

24
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,330
- Hey.

25
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,790
You ever heard of tackling?

26
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,310
- Hey, Duane.
- Boy, I froze my ass last night.

27
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,350
Hey! Why the hell can't you kids
learn to tackle?

28
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,580
Hey, how about taking Genevieve some
change, being as you're goin' that way?

29
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,550
Hike me one!

30
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,110
Here comes the bomb, Crawford!

31
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,810
- Look at that, Larry. They can catch.
- Feisty sons of bitches, ain't they?

32
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,060
- Wish they could tackle.
- Or do something useful.

33
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,420
Team wasn't worth a kiss-my-ass this year.

34
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,720
- Hey, hup!
- Hup!

35
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,120
Straight out, Crawford, one more time.
Whoo-ee!

36
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,370
All right, you boys. Cut it out.

37
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,840
I got enough problems
without you playing that game over again.

38
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,050
- We could have run off to Mexico with this, you know.
- Mmm.

39
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,800
- Hey, play that new one we heard.
- Which one?

40
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,180
Down payment on breakfast.
Let somebody prosperous play the jukebox.

41
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,070
Nobody prosperous would eat here.

42
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,690
- Well, I ain't very hungry.
- Well, I am.

43
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,740
- Say, you want the pickup first tonight?
- Nah.

44
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,410
I oughtn't get it first every Saturday
night. It's half yours, you know.

45
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,910
- Go ahead.
- You sure?

46
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,160
Sure, I'm sure.
Anyways, I got lots of deliveries to

47
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,580
make, and I have to go clear
to Ranger this afternoon.

48
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,580
- Okay.
- I'll be lucky to get back for the second show.

49
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,260
Give me that coffee, hon?
I need another cup.

50
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,090
My goodness, Sonny.

51
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,550
Frank hadn't ought to
work you so late on weekends.

52
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,340
That's what I keep telling him.

53
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,550
You ain't got in in time
to see the comedy in three weeks.

54
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,970
Hope you don't want no popcorn,
'cause there ain't none.

55
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,970
And you missed the newsreel too.

56
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,640
And the main show's done started,
so I'll just charge you 30 cents.

57
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,650
Thanks, Miss Mosey.

58
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,460
<i>I was wondering if my daughter</i>

59
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,320
<i>had deserted us, too,
when I heard her voice.</i>

60
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,530
<i>Pa! Pa!</i>

61
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,910
<i>- Hi, Pa.
- Kay was our only daughter.</i>

62
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,330
<i>I know a father's not supposed
to have favorites...</i>

63
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,120
<i>but when it's Kay...</i>

64
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,160
<i>- Mmm, you smell good.
- You like it?</i>

65
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,330
<i>- What's that?
- An atomizer.</i>

66
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,340
<i>- Where'd you get it? A present?</i>

67
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,340
<i>- Who from?
- Oh, somebody.</i>

68
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,470
I decided you had a wreck.

69
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,350
<i>What's happened to you? You look different.</i>

70
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,720
<i>- I do?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

71
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,780
<i>You look all lit up inside.</i>

72
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,950
<i>You're not wearing</i>
<i>your usual deadpan look...</i>

73
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,740
<i>that "how did I ever get</i>
<i>into this family" look.</i>

74
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,030
<i>Oh, Father.</i>

75
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,700
<i>Oh, I know. You've been taking
those vitamins that Dr. Gray sent you, huh?</i>

76
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,020
<i>That's right.</i>

77
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,220
<i>I guess I'll get me some of those vitamins.</i>

78
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,170
<i>I'll get it, Delilah.</i>

79
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,230
<i>What's the matter with her?</i>

80
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,480
<i>She looks kind of queer.</i>

81
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,150
Guess what.

82
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,400
What?

83
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,760
It's our anniversary.

84
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,030
What?

85
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,580
We've been going steady a year tonight.

86
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,840
Yeah?

87
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,020
Seems like a lot longer.

88
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,000
You should have got me
some anniversary present.

89
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,920
You can have another stick of gum.
That's all I got on me.

90
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,550
You can give me a dollar too.

91
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,550
That's how much it cost me and Marlene
for the show.

92
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,390
Hi. What y'all doing
back here in the dark?

93
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,530
- He's coming for me in a few minutes.
- I'll get your coffee.

94
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,270
Where'd the boys go?

95
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,610
Ben had some date,
and Tommy went to basketball practice.

96
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,240
- Oh, Delilah, will you bring the coffee, please?
- Yes, Mrs. Banks.

97
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,950
I don't see why they should get
the pickup first all the time.

98
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,950
All they ever want to do is neck anyway.

99
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,290
Buckley says I'm not too young
for a man to marry.

100
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,320
- I didn't marry your mother till I was 25.
- Oh, I know, Pop...

101
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,130
- Need some help, Jessie?
- Yeah, I sure do.

102
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,640
- Hey, so long, Sam.
- Bye, Sam. Come on!

103
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,140
- Good night.
- Good night, Sam. Sure did like the picture.

104
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,540
- Well, good. - Good night.
- Good night.

105
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,560
Crack your window.
Leave the motor running.

106
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,810
It's just too cold in here.

107
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,030
Number two on the national chart.

108
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,620
- Your hands are like ice.

109
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,160
I could put on my gloves.

110
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,020
What's the matter with you?
You act plain bored.

111
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,980
Quit! Quit!

112
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,570
- You said this was our anniversary.

113
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,780
Let's do something different.

114
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,110
Well, I like that. You cheapskate.

115
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,990
Didn't even get me an anniversary present,
and now you wanna go and get me pregnant.

116
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,080
Oh, my God, Charlene.
It was just my hand.

117
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,370
Yeah. One thing leads to another.

118
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,330
My mama told me how that old stuff goes.

119
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,090
We'll have plenty of time for that
when we get married.

120
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,130
You wasn't no livelier than me.

121
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,550
That's 'cause you ain't good-lookin'
enough. You ain't even got a ducktail.

122
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,930
Well, anyway, I'm done late.
Let's go on home.

123
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,020
Some anniversary.

124
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,480
If that's the way you feel about it,
I'd just as soon break up, Charlene.

125
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,360
- What?
- I don't want to spoil no more anniversaries for you.

126
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,860
That's the way nice girls
get treated in this town.

127
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,950
I might have known you wasn't dependable.

128
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,620
- You wasn't even in the backfield either.
- Now, what's that got to do with it?

129
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,080
This jacket's got a hole in the pocket, but
you needn't ask me to sew it up for you.

130
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,120
And you give me back my pictures too.

131
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,460
I don't want you showing them to all the
other boys and telling 'em how hot I am.

132
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,020
You wasn't very hot.

133
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,360
I hope you ain't down in the mouth
about Charlene.

134
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,950
- I ain't blue about her.
- She don't even have a good disposition.

135
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,950
What are you blue about then?

136
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,120
There ain't nobody to go with in this town.

137
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,370
Jacy's the only pretty girl in school,
and Duane's got her.

138
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,740
I call that his tough luck.

139
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,840
You don't have to eat so fast.
You ain't in a race.

140
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,070
Jacy will bring him more misery
than she'll ever be worth.

141
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,010
Did your dad give you this?

142
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,180
He needs all he's got.

143
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,440
It wouldn't hurt you to take a little
something from him once in a while.

144
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,150
I don't know.
You and Duane both in a boardin' house.

145
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,940
Him with a mother and you with a father.
It don't seem right.

146
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,240
And your dad's taking too many pills,
you know.

147
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,070
Yeah.

148
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,000
Then I'm no one to talk.
I never did get on with Mama. Still don't.

149
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,500
- Say, I hear Dan's goin' back to work soon.

150
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,290
I guess you'll be quittin' before long.

151
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,090
Honey, we got $4,000 worth
of doctor bills to pay.

152
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,140
I will probably be making cheeseburgers
for your grandkids.

153
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,440
Look at the little ducktail over here!

154
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,680
Oh, go to hell.

155
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,620
What's wrong with you, you duck ass?

156
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,900
Well...

157
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,890
I wonder what my chances are
this morning...

158
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,560
of interesting you kids in John Keats.

159
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,710
None at all.

160
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,810
Joe Bob.

161
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,190
Well, I read that poem of his
about the nightingale...

162
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,650
and I didn't think it was so good.

163
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,570
Sounded like he wanted
to be a nightingale.

164
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,780
Right. I don't think he wanted
to be a nightingale, Joe Bob.

165
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,250
Maybe he just wanted to be immortal.

166
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,170
All you have to do to be immortal
is lead a good Christian life.

167
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,750
Anyone can do it if they love the Lord.

168
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,050
Well, maybe so, Joe Bob. Maybe so.

169
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,750
Here now. Let me... Let me read you this.

170
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,470
"When old age
shall this generation waste...

171
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,470
"thou shalt remain...

172
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,140
"in midst of other woe than ours...

173
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,440
"a friend to man...

174
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,560
"to whom thou sayest...

175
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,150
"beauty is truth; Truth, beauty.

176
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,990
"That is all ye know on earth...

177
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,150
and all ye need to know."

178
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,320
Run, you little pissants! Run!

179
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,450
Tough it out! Tough it out!
You gotta be men like the rest of us.

180
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,500
Ain't none of you pretty enough
to be women.

181
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,000
Here, Joe Bob, quit flapping your arms.

182
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,170
You look like a goddamned goose.

183
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,250
Even for a preacher's boy,
you ought to be in better shape.

184
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,860
What kind of female you ever gonna get?

185
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,840
Tough it out! Tough it out.

186
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,300
Run, you little pissants.

187
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,170
All right, off the court.

188
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,610
If y'all didn't jack off so damn much,
maybe you could stay in shape.

189
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,000
Come here a minute, Sonny.

190
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,110
Now, you do me a favor,
and I'll do you one.

191
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,620
Sure, Coach.

192
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,950
Now, my old lady's got to go over
to the doctor in Olney tomorrow.

193
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,210
You know women.
There's always something wrong with them.

194
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,960
Yeah, I guess.

195
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,210
Well... Take it from me.

196
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,550
Anyway, I haven't got time to drive her.

197
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,760
Now, if you'll do this for me...

198
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,880
I'll get you out of civic class.

199
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,180
I'll be glad to.
That's the best offer I've had all day.

200
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,720
You tell her you got to get back
in time for practice...

201
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,810
so she won't stay in there too long.

202
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,470
I've got enough bills to pay already.

203
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,400
Hey, you know what's the trouble
with you little pissants?

204
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,900
You ain't got no school spirit!

205
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:59,740
"Anarene High School We love you..."

206
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
You need a haircut.

207
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,540
Hey, come on, Jimmie Sue.
We're hungry over here too.

208
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,750
- I'm comin'! I'm comin'! Hold your horses.
- It's been a half hour.

209
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,820
Uh-oh. Better watch it.
Here comes your mama.

210
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,280
Jacy, we're havin' supper at home tonight.
I expect you there in 15 minutes, you hear?

211
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,660
Okay, Mama.
I was just giving the boys a ride.

212
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,490
Mmm.

213
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,250
- Hey, Abilene.

214
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,020
Now, here's a tune that's been, uh,
on the pop hit list for a number of weeks.

215
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,480
You listen and tell us
the name of this one.

216
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
What is it?

217
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,730
- What is it, huh? Hear it again.
- "Shrimp Boats."

218
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,030
"Shrimp Boats." You got it. Very good!

219
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,530
Very good, Carlos.
You were in on that too.

220
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,040
All right. There's a hundred twenty
dollars. We're goin' along fine.

221
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,620
Now we come to City Limits.
This is geographic.

222
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,180
Guess you hate me tonight, huh?

223
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,220
Oh, Mama, you know I love you. But I love
Duane, too, even if you don't like it.

224
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,560
I don't care. I'd just hate to
see you marry him. That's all.

225
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,980
You wouldn't be rich any more,
and in about two months...

226
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,360
- I don't care about money. Not at all.
- He'd stop flattering you.

227
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Well, you're pretty stupid then.

228
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Well, you married Daddy when he was poor,
and he got rich, didn't he?

229
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,860
Scared your daddy
into getting rich, beautiful.

230
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,740
Well, if daddy could do it,
Duane could too.

231
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,450
Not married to you.
You're not scary enough.

232
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,870
Well, you're rich and you're miserable.
I sure don't want to be like you.

233
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,230
Not much danger of that.

234
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,590
- You slept with him?
- Mama!

235
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,090
We'll go to the doctor sometime
and arrange something...

236
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,300
so that you don't have to worry
about babies.

237
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,470
- You do have to be careful of that, you know.
- But, Mama, it's a sin, isn't it?

238
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,100
Unless you're married?
You know I wouldn't do that.

239
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,270
Oh! Don't be so mealymouthed.

240
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,270
I thought, if you slept
with him a few times...

241
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,270
you might find out that there
isn't anything magic about him.

242
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,340
Then we can send you away to a good
school and you can marry some wealthy boy.

243
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,530
But I don't want to leave.

244
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,280
Why can't I just stay here
and go to college in Wichita Falls?

245
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,780
Because everything is flat and empty here.

246
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,990
Ain't nothin' to do.

247
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,710
- Can I have some of that?
- Help yourself. Don't you have any?

248
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,150
Well, yeah, but I feel like
smelling good right now.

249
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,910
Don't you ever feel like
doing anything right now?

250
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,690
You ought to leave your
face just like that.

251
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,100
All you really need now is
a little eyebrow pencil.

252
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
- Okay. Good night.

253
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Just remember, beautiful...

254
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,320
everything gets old
if you do it often enough.

255
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,870
So if you want to find out
about monotony real quick...

256
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,450
marry Duane.

257
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,450
- Hello.
- Abilene, you... you asleep?

258
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,460
- No.
- Feel like company?

259
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,540
Now again, here's Warren Hull!

260
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,710
Well, I thought I'd drive out,
see how my well is coming.

261
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,880
Drill hard.
You're better at oil wells anyway.

262
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,210
 Oh, hello, Sonny. What you want?

263
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,930
Uh, Coach said you needed a driver.

264
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,430
- Didn't he tell you I was coming?

265
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,930
No, he didn't mention it.
I thought he was gonna drive me himself.

266
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,270
I guess he just couldn't get off.

267
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,360
Let me just get the radio.

268
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,530
Is it something bad?

269
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,270
No.

270
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,420
Just something... dreary.

271
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
Thank you.

272
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,210
Here's the keys.

273
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,660
Uh, I guess I'd better be getting
back to the school.

274
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,990
It was nice of you to drive me.

275
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,950
Well, it beats sitting
through civics, ma'am.

276
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,850
Wouldn't you like to come in
and have a soda...

277
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,980
if you can stand me
for a few more minutes?

278
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,060
Oh.

279
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,860
Okay.

280
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,070
I hate these northers.

281
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,380
Ah.

282
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,170
Would you prefer milk?
Just sit at the table.

283
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,970
Or you can go right now if you want.

284
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,510
I... I was just scared to be alone for a
minute. I'm sorry I made you come in.

285
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,980
I'll take a Dr. Pepper.

286
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,610
You'll never forgive me, I know.

287
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,910
Go on. You don't have to stay
any... any longer.

288
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,060
Thank you for the Dr. Pepper.

289
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,170
I guess you'll be glad
when basketball season's over.

290
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,920
Why?

291
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,510
Well, Coach probably
don't get to stay home much...

292
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,000
during football and basketball season.

293
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,630
My God, you don't know a thing
about it, do you?

294
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,830
You better go on to basketball practice.

295
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,930
Thanks for the Dr. Pepper.

296
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,740
- Hi, Jacy!
- Oh, hi.

297
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,030
- Duane coming?
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,910
Say, you know Bobby Sheen, don't
you, over to Wichita Falls? - Sure.

299
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,910
I met him at the country club.

300
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,000
Well, he's gonna have
this midnight swimming party tonight.

301
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,460
- You want to run over there with me later?
- I can't.

302
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,550
I guess you heard about the last one.

303
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,670
His folks were gone to Miami,
and everybody swam naked.

304
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,090
Yeah? - His folks are gone again,
so it will probably be pretty wild.

305
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,430
Sure wish you could come.
Bobby has great parties.

306
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,370
A lot of kids from the club gonna be there.

307
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,050
Gee, Lester, I'd like to go.

308
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,150
I'm gonna have a big problem
with Duane though.

309
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,500
Well, don't go off without me.
Maybe I can.

310
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,960
- Hi, Duane.
- What did Lester want?

311
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,460
Hmm? Oh, Lester, he's such a bore.

312
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,010
- Hey, Abilene.
- What do you say, buddy?

313
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,120
Hey there. Hi.

314
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,070
- Merry Christmas.
- Uh, this here's Jackie Lee French.

315
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,480
Jackie Lee, this is Lois
Farrow, my boss's wife.

316
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,150
- Hi, Jackie.
- What do you mean kissing her like that?

317
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,160
I ought to slap your face.

318
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,450
Oh, why don't you just kiss my ass?

319
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,740
I never come here to referee no fight.

320
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,830
Well, good.
Then come and dance with me.

321
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,370
Uh, uh... You get yourself a drink, honey.
I'll be back.

322
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,370
Hi, Ruth.

323
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,910
A thousand barrels...
A thousand barrels of oil a day.

324
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,920
Lousy field.

325
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,790
It's too hot in here.
Let's go outside.

326
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,330
I don't want a lot of drunk hillbillies
trompin' on my feet.

327
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,370
I got something to give you anyway.

328
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,040
- Hey, Sonny.
- Hey, Sonny.

329
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,310
Hi.

330
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,840
- Hi, Sonny.
- Hi, Dad.

331
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,110
How you doing?

332
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,850
Okay.

333
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,110
Well, that's good.

334
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
See you.

335
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,620
Sure.

336
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,910
- My Christmas present.
- Yeah.

337
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,200
Oh, goodness.
I haven't had time to get you anything yet.

338
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,580
- Well, that's okay.
- I just couldn't get loose a minute to shop.

339
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,700
I hope you like it.
I saved up for six months to get it.

340
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,540
Oh, it's just beautiful.

341
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,050
It's just what I've been wantin'.

342
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,000
You're so sweet,
spendin' all that money on me.

343
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,830
Oh, you're so sexy, Duane.

344
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,060
I just wish I didn't have
to leave you tonight.

345
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,890
- Well, you don't.
- Oh, I do too.

346
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,520
- I could just kill my mother.
- What do you mean?

347
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,320
She made me promise to go to a swim party in
Wichita with what's-his-name... Lester Marlow.

348
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,860
- Well, goddamn. What kind of thing is that?
- 'Cause his folks are so rich.

349
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,450
- Don't be mad at me, Duane.
- I ain't mad at you, but goddamn it!

350
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,490
It's all Lester's fault.
He keeps asking Mama.

351
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,990
- Well, goddamn!
- All I wanna do is stay with the man I love.

352
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,550
Goddamn!

353
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,810
No, no, Duane.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

354
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,070
What do you think you're doing,
asking my girl for a date?

355
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,910
- You turn me loose!
- I'll turn you loose anytime you're ready to fight.

356
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,540
Come on. Let's have it out.
Come on, Marlow!

357
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,340
Here, knock off that shit, boys.
This is the Christmas season.

358
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,470
Run along here, Wichita. I can't stand here
all night protecting your shoeshine.

359
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,260
I just don't know
what I'm gonna do about him.

360
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,480
He's so crazy about me,
he doesn't have good sense.

361
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,650
Well, I'm not saying anything against
Duane, but that's a roughneck for you.

362
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,700
They never are very sophisticated
about these things.

363
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,640
Well, merry Christmas!

364
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,350
Come in and let's have some punch, boys.

365
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,250
Hi, Sonny.

366
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,670
- Oh, hi.
- Want to help me?

367
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,980
Okay.

368
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,140
You're not dancing.
Don't you have a girlfriend?

369
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,900
Well, I did have.
We broke up a couple months ago.

370
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,940
Oh? Why?

371
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,940
Do you mind my asking?

372
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,860
I was goin' with Charlene Duggs.

373
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,010
She thought I got fresh with her.
I never did really.

374
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,450
I guess we broke up because we didn't
like each other much to begin with.

375
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,870
I hope you're not sad about it.

376
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,830
I don't think Charlene's
near nice enough for you.

377
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,170
Didn't see you dancing.

378
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,530
No, I don't dance much.

379
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,220
Will you drive me to the clinic
again next week?

380
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,580
Oh, you bet.

381
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,800
We better not dawdle here.

382
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,670
- Bobby.

383
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,420
Hey, look! New victims!

384
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,550
Hi, Jacy.

385
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,680
- Hi.
- Glad you could make it.

386
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,930
- We're dressed informally, as you can see.
- Hi, Jacy.

387
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:10,310
- You know Annie Annie.
- Want to join the club?

388
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,140
Sure.

389
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,690
Well, you gotta get undressed
out there on the diving board.

390
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,940
So everybody gets to watch.

391
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,940
- We all do it the first time.
- That's the rule.

392
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,070
Yeah. I did it last Easter.

393
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,320
- Okay?
- Okay.

394
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,180
Everybody out for the strip show.

395
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,060
Don't pay any attention to Sandy.
He's my little brother.

396
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,730
If he gooses you or anything,
I'll make him go to bed.

397
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,240
Goodness.
Hope I don't fall off this thing.

398
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,450
Sandy can fish you out if you do.

399
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,870
Duane, been lookin' for you.
Where's Jacy?

400
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,120
Aw, don't remind him.
We just got him quiet. You want a drink?

401
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,620
- Okay. Where'd you get it?
- Found it in a guy's car.

402
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,960
- When he weren't looking.
- Let's all go do something!

403
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,340
Good idea! Why don't we try
and hunt up some pussy?

404
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,210
Aw, you wouldn't know
what to do with it if we found some.

405
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,090
Hey. What happened, Duane?

406
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,470
Lester took his girl to a swimming party.

407
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,560
Let's all go out and get a fuck.

408
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,810
Hey, I know where there's a heifer.
It belongs to my Uncle Hank.

409
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,350
Yeah. Why the hell not?

410
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,060
- I say a heifer beats nothin'.
- Pussy's pussy.

411
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,320
I don't want no heifer.

412
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,190
Hell, what we ought to do
is buy Billy here a piece of ass.

413
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,280
- Yeah, we oughtn't let him die a virgin.
- Yeah.

414
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,780
Mama says idiot kids
don't live long anyway.

415
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,870
He ain't no idiot kid.
He just don't talk.

416
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,660
I bet he's still a virgin though.

417
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,040
Hey, we oughta fix him up
with Jimmie Sue.

418
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,880
- Ew!
- It wouldn't make no difference to Billy.

419
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,210
Look, I don't think
we should try anything like that.

420
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,010
Why not? It wouldn't cost us
more than a dollar and a half.

421
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,380
Hell, if that's all she costs,
we ought to get her ourselves.

422
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,140
Shit! Heifer's better than Jimmie Sue.

423
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,600
Get the stupid little thing in here.
I ain't got all night.

424
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,970
Come on. Let's get those pants off, boys.

425
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,980
Whoo!

426
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,020
You ain't gonna be a virgin much longer.

427
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,560
Come on, Billy. We're gonna get you laid.

428
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,400
Whoo!

429
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
Strap her on, Billy. Now come on.

430
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,850
- Do the job, Billy.
- Get her, Billy boy.

431
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,330
Why, this is the dumbest thing I ever seen!

432
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,500
- He don't even know what to do.
- Come on, Billy!

433
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,250
Damn it. Put it to her, boy.

434
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,170
- Get her, Billy.
- Come on, Billy. Screw it to her, boy!

435
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,880
You kids stop that yelling out there.
Got a hold of this thing. It ain't even in!

436
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,180
Goddamn... What you...
Goddamn, you stupid little thing!

437
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,410
Couldn't even wait. Look at this mess!

438
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,710
- You okay, Billy?
- You all right?

439
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,710
Well, now I know.
Idiot's as bad as Mexicans.

440
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,800
Don't bother me no more
for that crazy thing.

441
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,320
Wouldn't mess with him again
for less than three and a half.

442
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,920
Which one of you bloodied his nose?

443
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,380
I've told y'all not to fight with Billy
'cause he don't understand about fightin'.

444
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,470
- What happened, Sonny?
- It weren't none of us, Sam.

445
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,470
Nah. It was Jimmie Sue.

446
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:23,510
Jimmie Sue?
How'd he get messed up with her?

447
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,140
We all chipped in
and bought him a piece of ass.

448
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,060
Thought he was getting tired
of being a virgin.

449
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,810
She got mad about somethin'
and bloodied his nose.

450
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:38,780
Now, you boys can get on out of here. I
don't want to have no more to do with you.

451
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,620
Scaring a poor,
unfortunate creature like Billy...

452
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,370
just so's you could have a few laughs.

453
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:48,460
I've been around
that trashy behavior all my life.

454
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,250
I'm getting tired of putting up with it.

455
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,340
Now, you can stay out of this pool hall...

456
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,140
out of my café
and my picture show too.

457
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,550
I don't want no more of your business.

458
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,260
We didn't mean for anything bad
to happen, Sam. We...

459
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:09,840
You didn't even have the decency
to wash his face.

460
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,000
We're his best customers.
He can't run us off.

461
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,070
Can he?

462
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,520
Lucky I fell asleep.
I'd hate not to be able to shoot no pool.

463
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,200
You're sure he won't come?

464
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,140
You know he won't.
He's just startin' basketball practice.

465
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,920
It's all right.

466
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,970
I'm sorry I cried.

467
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,870
Just a-scared, I guess.

468
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,580
Oh, he ain't gonna come.

469
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,290
They're probably running plays
right now, I bet.

470
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,650
No, not scared of that.

471
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,250
Scared I could never do this, I guess.

472
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,590
Can't seem to do anything
without crying about it.

473
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,980
How could you like me?

474
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,340
Oh, I like you.

475
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,910
I'm glad.

476
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,140
Well, come on in.
I ain't gonna throw bottles at you.

477
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,480
Hi.

478
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,320
What have you been doing?
You lost weight.

479
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,280
Ain't had any of your cheeseburgers
in weeks.

480
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,150
Well, come on. I'll fix you one...

481
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,780
even though that wasn't
a very nice thing y'all done to Billy.

482
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,290
Can't blame Sam.

483
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,000
- Was that your idea?
- No.

484
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,410
- Duane's?
- Huh?

485
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,130
He was there, wasn't he?

486
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:33,080
Just didn't have the decency
to own up to it.

487
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:38,840
Oh, don't worry.
I won't tell on him. I should though.

488
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,790
Sure smells good.

489
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:44,470
One thing I know for sure...

490
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,930
A person can't sneeze in this town without
somebody offering him a handkerchief.

491
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,300
- What you mean?
- Nothin'.

492
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,300
Just an awful small town
for any kind of carrying-on.

493
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,720
Don't forget to put some onions on 'em.

494
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,050
And some people got a lot of guns.

495
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:07,620
All right.
You don't need my advice anyway.

496
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,710
Why don't you go play a record?
These will be done in a minute.

497
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,070
I just came in
to say hello to Genevieve.

498
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,040
Sonny?

499
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,040
Food's gettin' cold.

500
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,890
What are you grinnin' about?

501
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:08,430
Chicken-fry me a steak,
and try to use meat this time.

502
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,690
I heard about the ball game last night.

503
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,900
121 to 14.

504
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:25,030
Must be pretty near a record.

505
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,730
Sam, I'm sorry.

506
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,670
I reckon y'all need glasses.

507
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,100
Hold still.

508
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,760
Hold still.

509
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,270
- Want some more cookies?
- Mm-mmm.

510
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,100
- More milk?
- I'm full.

511
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,530
Hey, how come you've stayed
with the coach?

512
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,530
You don't like him much.

513
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,120
Oh, I weren't brought up
to leave a husband.

514
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,460
I guess that's why.

515
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,820
Maybe I was just scared to.

516
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:20,710
I never noticed how ugly this room is.

517
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:24,170
- What's your favorite color?
- Oh, I don't know. Blue.

518
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:27,140
- Maybe I'll repaper it.
- Well, why'd you marry him?

519
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,800
I don't know.
My mother didn't like him.

520
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:32,140
Maybe that was it.

521
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,230
But I was 20 years old.

522
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:38,160
I thought hairy-chested football coaches
were about it.

523
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,570
I'm gonna buy us a new quilt.

524
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,280
A blue one.

525
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,030
What do you think he'd do
if he found us?

526
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:49,490
Shoot us probably.

527
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:53,030
He's always glad to have an excuse
to use his deer rifle.

528
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,390
I thought you boys wanted to fish.

529
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,490
Come on.
Keep an eye on them corks, Billy.

530
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:24,110
I don't think there's anything
in this tank 'cept turtles.

531
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:27,030
That's what I like about it,
tell you the truth.

532
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,390
- Want to try one?
- Sure.

533
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,540
I never liked to clean fish
or eat them either.

534
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,540
Spend half your time picking out bones.

535
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,750
Yeah, I just come out here
to get a little scenery.

536
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,660
Too pretty a day to spend in town.

537
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,300
You wouldn't believe
how this country's changed.

538
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,310
First time I seen it,
there wasn't a mesquite tree on it...

539
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,940
or a prickly pear neither.

540
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,690
I used to own this land, you know.

541
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:11,450
First time I watered a horse at this tank
was more than 40 years ago.

542
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,990
I reckon the reason
why I always drag you out here...

543
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,720
is probably I'm just as sentimental as the
next fella when it comes to old times.

544
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,630
Old times.

545
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:30,880
I brought a young lady
swimming out here once.

546
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,440
More than 20 years ago.

547
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:40,730
It was after my wife had lost her mind
and my boys was dead.

548
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,190
Me and this young lady
was pretty wild, I guess.

549
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:51,420
In pretty deep.

550
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:57,620
We used to come out here a-horseback
and go swimmin' without no bathin' suits.

551
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,210
One day, she wanted
to swim the horses across this tank.

552
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:08,750
Kind of a crazy thing to do,
but we done it anyway.

553
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:13,190
She bet me a silver dollar
she could beat me across.

554
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,980
She did.

555
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:20,350
This old horse I was a-ridin'
didn't want to take the water.

556
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:24,290
But she was always lookin'
for somethin' to do like that.

557
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:27,500
Somethin' wild.

558
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:32,220
I'll bet she's still got
that silver dollar.

559
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,710
Whatever happened to her?

560
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,790
Oh, she growed up.

561
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:43,540
She was just a girl then really.

562
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,100
Here, let me help you with that.

563
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,660
Why didn't you ever marry her
after your wife died?

564
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,330
She was already married.

565
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,190
Her and her husband was young
and miserable with one another...

566
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:07,190
like so many young married folks are.

567
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:12,410
I thought they'd change with some
age, but... didn't turn out that way.

568
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,030
Is being married always so miserable?

569
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:18,870
No, not really.
About 80% of the time, I guess.

570
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:25,000
We ought to go
to a real fishing tank next year.

571
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,490
Nah, it don't do to think about
things like that too much.

572
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,880
If she was here, I'd probably be
just as crazy now as I was then...

573
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,200
in about five minutes.

574
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,210
Ain't that ridiculous?

575
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:43,180
No, it ain't really...

576
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:47,980
'cause being crazy about a woman like her
is always the right thing to do.

577
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:51,070
Being a decrepit old bag of bones...

578
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:53,400
that's what's ridiculous.

579
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,660
Gettin' old.

580
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,100
- My God, I'm glad it wasn't on fire.

581
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,920
I would have burned to death
before you got one button undone.

582
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,960
I'm going to get a drink of water.

583
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,720
Hi.

584
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,430
I wondered where you went.
Annie Annie asleep?

585
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,700
Yeah.

586
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:25,250
Nice. You a virgin?

587
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,610
Guess I am.

588
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,870
Too bad.

589
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,000
- I don't want to be though.
- I don't blame you.

590
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,810
Come see me when you're not.

591
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,030
Why don't we just take off and go
someplace? I'm sick and tired of this town.

592
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,540
- You're the only friend I got here.
- You mean go and stay gone?

593
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,800
Except Jacy. No, I don't know.

594
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,920
Hey, we could go to Mexico.
Be back sometime Monday.

595
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,800
- You reckon the pickup would make it?
- It might. How much money you got?

596
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,800
Oh, 30 bucks about.

597
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,430
Well, I got 40.
We could make a run with that. Come on!

598
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:24,680
Okay.

599
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,720
- You boys want... Hey, where you going?
- Mexico.

600
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,720
Where?

601
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,480
- Better come with us, Sam.
We're headed for the valley.

602
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,070
- Going where, did you say?
- Mexico.

603
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:44,570
- I hear it's about the wildest.
- Yeah, all the way down.

604
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:48,660
You're going all the way to Mexico tonight
in this old heap of junk?

605
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,660
My God.

606
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,080
Reckon the town
get along without us till Monday?

607
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,080
Oh, I reckon.

608
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,420
If I was young enough to bounce that far,
I'd go with you.

609
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,420
- Need any money?
- No, we got plenty.

610
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:05,360
Well, you'd better take some
for some insurance.

611
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,060
Take money below that border,
it sort of melts sometimes.

612
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,270
Well, thanks, Sam.

613
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,730
And try not to drink too much
of that buggy water.

614
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:17,770
Oh, we'll just drink beer and tequila.

615
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:20,750
Yeah. You catch the clap,
you'll wish you hadn't drunk nothin'.

616
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,380
Oh, well. We'll see you.

617
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,740
- Adios!
- So long!

618
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,490
Duane. Hey, wake up.

619
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,860
We're back.

620
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:18,710
Oh, my stomach don't feel so good.
Got any more of those Tums?

621
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:23,330
Aw, you ate 'em all
before we got to San Antone.

622
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:27,640
Well, Genevieve will have something.
My stomach, it don't feel so good.

623
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,300
Closed.

624
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,720
Closed?

625
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,310
Yeah.

626
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:37,640
I never seen it closed before.

627
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,010
No, not even for Christmas.

628
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:44,680
Maybe Sam will have something.
'Cause I'm sick.

629
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,590
Oh, it ain't that early.

630
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:11,430
Must be some kind of holiday.

631
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,310
Sam don't close on holidays.

632
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,570
Maybe he had to go someplace.

633
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:23,190
- Well, let's go ask Andy, huh?
- Okay.

634
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:37,410
- Hey, Andy.
- It's a wonder somebody don't steal the town.

635
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:38,700
Hey, where is everybody?

636
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,750
Asleep, if everybody's got any sense.

637
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,460
Well, why'd Sam close the café?

638
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,500
Oh, yeah, y'all been gone, ain't you?

639
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,590
Gone to Mexico.

640
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,590
- You don't know about it.
- About what?

641
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,900
Sam died yesterday morning.

642
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,430
- Died?
- Yep. Quite a blow.

643
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:01,220
Keeled over on one of the snooker tables.
Had a stroke.

644
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,270
Sam the Lion?

645
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,480
Yep. Sam's dead.

646
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,840
He was quite a feller.

647
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,410
He had his own way of doin' things.
That's for sure.

648
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:18,230
They found his will...
craziest thing you ever heard.

649
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:22,720
He left you the pool hall, Sonny.
What do you think about that?

650
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,420
He left Genevieve the café.

651
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:29,770
That's the only thing he done
that made any sense.

652
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,050
Left the picture show to old Miss Mosey.

653
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:36,930
Hell, she's too far gone
to even run a popcorn machine.

654
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,310
And the craziest thing of all...

655
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:43,560
he left a thousand dollars to Joe
Bob Blanton, the preacher's boy.

656
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,520
Beats all I ever heard of.

657
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,190
He could just as easily left that to me...

658
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:52,980
'cause I deserve it least as much
as that ignorant little bastard.

659
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:56,870
Anyhow, it's done.

660
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:59,230
They're burying him tomorrow.

661
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:43,500
Duane's gonna get it, sure enough.

662
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:55,570
Don't shit in your pants.
Everybody can't please everyone.

663
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:09,710
- You better get somethin'.

664
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,800
Come in.

665
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:40,530
- I love you.
- I love you too.

666
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:12,350
Oh, Duane, hurry.

667
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,200
What's wrong, honey?

668
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,700
Um, I don't know.

669
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:56,900
That tickles.
You know I can't stand to be tickled.

670
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,260
What's the matter?
Aren't you gonna do it?

671
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:11,750
- I don't know what's wrong.
- What do you mean? How could anything be wrong?

672
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,060
Just go on and do it.

673
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,800
Oh! What's the matter with you?

674
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,550
I don't know. I don't know.
Something's happened.

675
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,720
Well, get off a minute, for goodness sake.
You might fall and mash me.

676
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,510
I don't know what happened.

677
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:30,350
It was Mexico.
No telling what you got down there.

678
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:33,140
I just hate you!
I don't know why I ever went with you.

679
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,850
I don't know what happened.

680
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,880
Put your clothes on. You think I wanna
sit around here and look at you naked?

681
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:45,530
I might have known you couldn't do it.
Now I'll never get to not be a virgin.

682
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:47,870
What'll we tell everybody?
The whole class knows.

683
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,450
I just wanna cry.
I think you're the meanest boy I ever saw.

684
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,910
My mother was dead right about you.

685
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:56,460
- I don't know what happened.
- Don't go out there!

686
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,580
We haven't had time to do it.
They'd know.

687
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:02,050
I don't want one soul to know.
You'd better not tell one soul.

688
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:04,720
You just pretend it was wonderful.

689
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,720
Hell, I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

690
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,140
Oh!

691
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:12,310
- If you say that one more time, I'll bite you!
- Now here's Tony Bennett.

692
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:33,380
Oh, gee, tell us about it, Jacy.
What was it like?

693
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,830
I just can't describe it.

694
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:41,500
I just can't describe it in words.

695
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,500
Jacy?

696
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,000
Jacy?

697
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,710
I can do it now. I know I can.

698
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,430
Jacy?

699
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:06,350
Oh, quit prissin'.
I don't think you did it right anyway.

700
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,080
Come on.

701
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,610
It's your graduation present.
Hope you like it.

702
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:44,380
I never seen one as nice.

703
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,560
- Hello.
- Jacy?

704
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,430
What's on your feeble mind, Duane?

705
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:02,390
Same as it's been. I want a date.

706
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:05,600
Uh-huh. Why don't you
just go back to Mexico?

707
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:08,270
I guess girls are just
easier to please down there.

708
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,480
Just go out with me once more.
Just one more time.

709
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:13,740
- You can at least see me.
- Uh-uh. You find somebody else to pester.

710
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,110
I've got a new boyfriend now,
and I can't be talkin' to you.

711
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,910
- What new boyfriend? Who?
- Bobby Sheen, of course.

712
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:20,490
Bobby Sheen?

713
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,500
- You crazy?
- I certainly am not.

714
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,500
I guess I've just been wanting to go with
him all along and never realized it.

715
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,060
Maybe we'll see you
in Wichita sometime.

716
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,020
- Goddamn it!

717
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,480
Goddamn it to hell!

718
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:00,580
Well, I hate to see you go, Duane.

719
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,910
I don't have
a goddamn thing to stay for.

720
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:06,200
The roughnecks say you can
get a job out in Odessa anytime.

721
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:08,990
Come on back if you don't.

722
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,500
Hey, listen.
You hear they busted up, let me know.

723
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:02,760
- Hi. I didn't hear you.
- Gene home?

724
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,160
No. He and Mama went to the club.

725
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,050
What are you doing home
on a Saturday night?

726
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,400
Bobby Sheen ran off and got married.

727
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,140
Annie Annie Martin.

728
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,040
Want me to turn the TV off?

729
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,250
No. I'm gonna go play some pool.

730
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:31,630
Just tell your daddy
that well came in okay.

731
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:34,290
I wish I could go to the pool hall.

732
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,130
I've always wanted to.

733
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:39,030
It's terrible
the things girls aren't allowed to do.

734
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:44,220
Well, hell, come on.
I'll show you the pool hall.

735
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:48,640
- Aren't there people there?
- If there are, they'll be in back asleep now.

736
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,480
Won't bother us. Got my own key.

737
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:55,820
Okay, I will then.

738
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,480
Goodness, it sure is dark in here.

739
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,860
What a night. I never thought
somethin' like this would happen.

740
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:22,010
How about hoppin' out?

741
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:59,680
Oh, he's just awful, Mama!
Why do you fool with him?

742
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:01,390
Daddy's a nicer man than him, isn't he?

743
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,770
Oh, he sure is, beautiful.
Your daddy's a very nice man.

744
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:06,570
I oughta have been givin' Abilene hell
instead of him.

745
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:09,530
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Bobby was the last one.

746
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:11,280
- No.
- I'm just gonna be an old maid.

747
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,530
Honey, that's just the way
it goes sometimes, you know?

748
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:16,910
- You win a few, you lose a few.
- What do you do?

749
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,200
Nothing's ever the way
it's supposed to be at all.

750
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:21,470
You're right. Come on.

751
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:26,250
I want to tell you something.

752
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:28,920
What I've done has not
worked out too well.

753
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,430
I think maybe we better think
of something else for you, huh?

754
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,390
Right now, I guess Ruth Popper's
got about as good a setup as anyone.

755
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:40,430
- Ruth Popper?
- I think Sonny's reasonably good-looking...

756
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:43,850
- Sonny? Sonny Crawford?
- Oh, don't you know about that?

757
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:46,810
It's been going on about six months now.
I thought you kids knew everything.

758
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:49,820
It's the silliest thing I ever heard of.
She's 40 years old.

759
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:53,070
So am I, honey.
It's kind of an itchy age.

760
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:56,520
- You want an orange?
- I don't believe it.

761
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:00,290
Sonny's always wanted to go with me.

762
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,700
- Pretty easy shot, Sheriff.

763
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,640
Sheriff, we got some trouble.

764
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,890
Goddamn you, Monroe!
You made me scratch.

765
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,890
Sorry, Sheriff. Didn't mean to, but...

766
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,150
Well, Johnny Clarg's little girl's
kinda been kidnapped.

767
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:28,780
They said they saw the
preacher's boy put her in

768
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,570
his car about two hours ago
over at the drugstore.

769
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:34,820
Well, what the hell?
Maybe Joe Bob just give her a ride home.

770
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:37,660
Be doin' her a favor in this hot weather.

771
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:40,450
Who would want to kidnap Molly Clarg?

772
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:42,410
Don't ask me.
I just know she's not home.

773
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:44,040
They was seen
headed out of town toward Olney...

774
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:48,130
and, well, Miz Clarg's kind of afraid
that Joe Bob might be...

775
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:50,630
gonna molest her or somethin'.

776
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:53,630
Sonny, you and some of these boys
come with us.

777
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:57,520
If that's the way it is,
no telling what we'll find.

778
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:27,940
Molly! Molly!

779
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:32,670
Get him! Ain't you goin' to?

780
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:36,220
Here's my little girl.
He's the one that done it.

781
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:40,740
Why don't you get him?
If my husband was here, he'd kill him dead!

782
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:49,310
What'd you do to that child?
We know you done something.

783
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:51,080
Come on.

784
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:54,980
Filthy! Filthy, filthy!

785
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:58,400
Here now. Grab her.
None of this goddamn frenzy.

786
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:00,960
Filthy, filthy, filthy!

787
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:06,540
It's the Lord's justice, Son. You'll have
to suffer with the murderer and the thief.

788
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:09,250
- The Lord will help you now.
- Sonny, you drive that Plymouth to town.

789
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:12,890
We gotta get this man to jail.

790
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:25,470
- Doctor said he didn't do nothin'.
- Never had the guts. Preacher's boy.

791
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,270
Sheriff figured he'd done somethin'.

792
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:30,610
Yeah, stands to reason.

793
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:38,110
Were you there? Did you see anything?

794
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,150
Oh, weren't nothing to
see except Miz Clarg.

795
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,280
And if she had a gun,
she might've killed us all.

796
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,080
And Joe Bob didn't do nothin'.

797
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:48,410
Oh, you know he must've done somethin'.
Scares me to death.

798
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:51,930
You just never can tell when somethin'
terrible's gonna happen.

799
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,460
It's okay. They got him now.

800
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:57,300
I called you before.

801
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,260
You did?

802
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:01,550
Mm-hmm. I felt lonesome.

803
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:04,160
Thought you might wanna
drive around a while.

804
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,390
Well, I'm supposed to be someplace.

805
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:11,730
I'm still a little scared.

806
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:13,990
Please take me riding.

807
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:21,260
Well, where will we drive?

808
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:50,600
- You ever hear from Duane?
- Had a postcard.

809
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,520
I really feel sad about that.

810
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,360
He's, uh... Makes 320 a month.
Said he bought a car.

811
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,190
Guess I'll always be
a little bit in love with Duane.

812
01:27:00,190 --> 01:27:02,560
We just had too much against us.

813
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:07,530
It wasn't easy
being the one to break up.

814
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:38,060
- Sonny?
- What?

815
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,620
Not here.

816
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:38,280
I'm too old for screwin' in cars.

817
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:44,510
I don't like to hurry.

818
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:48,590
Why don't we go to Wichita
and get a motel room?

819
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:51,680
I'm afraid to right now.
I think my folks are watching me.

820
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,350
They know I don't want to go to college.

821
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:56,300
They might think
we're gonna run off and get married.

822
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,400
We'll do it when it's safe.

823
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,860
We got all summer.

824
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:58,780
- Hey, Duane.
- Hey, buddy.

825
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,460
I didn't know you
turned roughneck.

826
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:04,290
Gotta make a livin' somehow so's
I can afford to keep the pool hall open.

827
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:06,710
- When'd you get in?
- Oh, about 2:00.

828
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:09,070
Thought I'd surprise you.

829
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:12,510
- This yours?
- Yeah. How about that?

830
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:15,050
38,000 miles on her.
She runs like new.

831
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,060
- Say, you want a beer?
- Not me.

832
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:20,020
It's about all I eat
for breakfast any more.

833
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:22,400
Hey, sure is a nice car.

834
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,760
Yeah, I like to drive it so much I thought
I'd just drop home for the weekend.

835
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:31,220
Yeah, you can't take too good care
of a car like this.

836
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:36,410
- I wash her every week.
- Oh, it looks great.

837
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:40,370
- Hear about Joe Bob?
- Yeah, I always knew he was crazy.

838
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:44,060
He didn't do nothing...
except get her to take her underpants off.

839
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:47,500
- He's out of jail now.
- Yeah.

840
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:50,670
Are you still screwing that old lady?

841
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:53,590
No. Yeah. I been kind of busy.

842
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:56,600
I seen old Leroy last week.

843
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,430
He said he thought you and Jacy
had been going together a little.

844
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:01,430
Yeah. We have a little.

845
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,100
She's been kinda bored, so once in a while
we go out, eat Mexican food or something.

846
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:08,060
The way I hear it,
that ain't all you been eating.

847
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:12,130
Well, whoever told you that
don't know what he's talkin' about.

848
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:14,110
Sure, I been goin' with her. Why not?

849
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:17,320
Never said I blamed you for it.
I don't blame you much.

850
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:20,450
Just never thought you'd do me that way.
I thought we were still best friends.

851
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:24,040
We are. What you so mad for?
I never done nothin' to you.

852
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,790
- I guess screwin' my girl ain't nothin' to you.
- I ain't screwing her.

853
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:29,630
- Hell you ain't!
- Well, I ain't.

854
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:31,630
- She's not your girl any more anyhow.
- She is my girl. I don't care if we did break up.

855
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:33,630
- Hell, you don't live here any more.
- That don't make no difference.

856
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:36,260
I'll always live here. I'm gettin'
her back. I'm tellin' you right now.

857
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,260
She's gonna marry me one of these days
when I get a little bit more money.

858
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:40,060
- She won't marry you.
- Sure, she will.

859
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:42,060
- We always meant to get married.
- She's going off to college soon.

860
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:45,980
I doubt I'll ever get to go with her
again myself once she gets off.

861
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:48,980
I never saw what it could hurt
to go with her this summer though.

862
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:51,820
- She's never gonna marry you.
- She is, by God! Don't you tell me she won't!

863
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:54,650
She'd never let you screw her.
That's for sure.

864
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:57,490
Hell, I was just seein'
how honest you was.

865
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:01,240
Jacy would never let you screw her.
You ain't that good a cocksman.

866
01:32:01,569 --> 01:32:04,330
You never even screwed Charlene Duggs
all that time you went with her.

867
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:06,830
Course I didn't. You know why?

868
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:10,040
'Cause you had the pickup
all time Saturday night! That's why.

869
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:12,130
Nobody could have screwed her
in the time I had left.

870
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:15,170
I could have screwed her in five minutes.
I wouldn't even need no pickup.

871
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:18,470
Oh, yeah? Well, the only reason
she went with you as long as she did...

872
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:20,600
was 'cause you was in the backfield
and I was in the goddamn line.

873
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,810
What you talkin' about?
Me and her was in love.

874
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:26,190
Oh, you was. She likes me
just as much as she ever liked you.

875
01:32:26,190 --> 01:32:29,270
- That's a lie.
- I'll stay with her all night one of these nights too.

876
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:30,940
- She done promised.
- You won't either.

877
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,640
Yes, I will. Why shouldn't I?
She done told me you

878
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,320
couldn't even do it that
time in Wichita Falls!

879
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,240
What about that?

880
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,830
What happened?

881
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:04,850
Sonny?

882
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:19,360
There's a lady in the waiting room.
She sent you this.

883
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:36,590
Could you tell her I'm asleep? Please.

884
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:38,510
All right.

885
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:08,950
- That too cold?
- Nah, it's great.

886
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,960
Say, I hear Duane joined the army.

887
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,130
Good place for him too.

888
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:16,800
Aw, he was just holding that bottle.
Didn't mean to hit me with it.

889
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,130
That boy's always had meanness in him.

890
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:23,430
Of course, Jacy's just the kind of girl
that brings out the meanness in a man.

891
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:25,790
She's just like her grandmother.

892
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:32,070
I hadn't ought to talk about 'em anyhow.
We was all good friends once.

893
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,710
Dan roughnecked with Gene Farrow.

894
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:41,120
He and Lois, they used to live in this little
one-room place over the newspaper office.

895
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:45,420
Hell, Lois couldn't afford a flour sack,
much less a mink.

896
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:51,400
I've always had a soft spot for her though.

897
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:55,040
Yeah, I wondered a lot of times, you know,
what would have happened...

898
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,840
if my Dan had made the strikes
that Gene made.

899
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,590
They offered that rig to him first.

900
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:04,620
Yep.

901
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:09,180
Dan Morgan never took a chance in his life.

902
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:11,540
Do you wish y'all had made it?

903
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:17,600
Oh, sure, I wish we'd made it.

904
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:23,700
Guess the army won't take me
now I just got one good eye.

905
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:26,280
You want to go over to Korea
and get yourself killed, huh?

906
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:30,810
You ain't got your senses back yet...
what few you ever had.

907
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:34,670
Well, café won't run itself.
You rest up now.

908
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:37,040
Oh, here's for the cheeseburger.

909
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,960
Okay, I'll bring your change
when I bring your supper.

910
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,210
Thanks.

911
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:12,200
- Sonny?
- Come on in.

912
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,920
Oh, I was so worried.
I just had to see you.

913
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,920
Oh, I been missing you.

914
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:28,880
And I'm a lot better than I was.
Here, sit down.

915
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,600
You just can't believe
how famous we are.

916
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,890
- We're all anybody talks about in this town now.
- Yeah, I guess so.

917
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:37,600
- I want us to get married.
- What?

918
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,110
- I really do.
- Get married?

919
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:42,520
Just as soon as you want to.
Don't you want to?

920
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:44,940
Oh, yeah.

921
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:48,530
I bet the whole town will be knocked for a
loop if we do. They'll never forget it.

922
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:51,280
- Ain't you goin' to college?
- Oh, I don't care about that.

923
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,870
I love you, and that's more important.

924
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:57,000
You were so dear to fight for me.

925
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,080
My folks won't like it,
but we can run off.

926
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,130
- They'll kill us.
- No, they won't.

927
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:03,210
- Kill me anyhow.
- They'll get over it.

928
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:05,300
You're working for Daddy now anyway.

929
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:08,300
Pretty soon, they'll love you
just as much as I do.

930
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:13,060
Can we?

931
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,640
Sure.

932
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,480
I just hope I can see to drive.

933
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,030
Don't you worry. I can drive.

934
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,070
Don't do that, Sonny.

935
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:35,490
Why not? We're man and wife now.
We can do anything.

936
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,710
Not while I'm driving.
I might have a wreck.

937
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:42,500
Goodness. Wouldn't it be just awful
if Mama and Daddy got the police after us?

938
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:44,960
Oh, they don't even know where we are.

939
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:49,510
Well, I had to leave 'em a note, you know, so
they wouldn't be worried out of their minds.

940
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:51,300
You shouldn't have done that.

941
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,850
I had to.
I figured they'd have to know sometime.

942
01:37:53,850 --> 01:37:56,220
Well, what could they get us for?

943
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,350
We got a right to get married,
ain't we?

944
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,710
I guess so.

945
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,820
I wish you didn't have that stupid
eye patch. It's really creepy.

946
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,530
I can take it off pretty soon.

947
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:14,070
'Bout two hours,
we'll be in Lake Texoma...

948
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,370
and have a room to ourself, hmm?

949
01:38:16,370 --> 01:38:20,110
My goodness, you're sitting so close
I can barely drive.

950
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,400
Oh, goodness.

951
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:14,300
Howdy. What part of Texas y'all from?

952
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:17,550
- Anarene.
- Newlyweds, ain't you?

953
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:20,560
Well, y'all better follow me on in.
I think somebody's lookin' for you.

954
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,770
We ain't done nothin' wrong.
Ain't we got a right to get married?

955
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:25,310
- How can you arrest us just like that?
- I ain't arresting you.

956
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:27,810
I just want you to come with me
till we find out somethin'.

957
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:29,780
I don't know what your rights are.

958
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:31,690
I guess we better follow him, honey.

959
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:34,450
I'll just be heartbroken
if my folks have done this.

960
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,960
You think I worked like a dog all my life
so my daughter can end up in a pool hall?

961
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,750
We was gonna get another apartment.

962
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:47,250
I'll bet you was.
Where are your car keys, hon?

963
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:49,590
It's a hell of a note. A hell of a note.
Just a hell of a note!

964
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:51,800
- Oh, shut up and take her home.
- You bet I will!

965
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,630
- I'm tired of this.
- You take her car.

966
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:55,990
As far as I'm concerned,
he can walk!

967
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:26,830
Not much of a wedding night, huh?

968
01:40:26,830 --> 01:40:29,250
Nope, not much of one.

969
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:32,840
Here, have a little drink of bourbon.
It'll pick you up.

970
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:35,150
Take all of it. I'm gonna drive.

971
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:42,310
You won't believe this, Sonny, but you're lucky
we got you clear of her quick as we did.

972
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,770
You'd have been a lot better off
staying with Ruth Popper.

973
01:40:45,770 --> 01:40:47,850
Does everybody know about that?

974
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:50,150
Of course.

975
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:52,520
Sounded like a good deal to me, kiddo.

976
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:54,740
You shouldn't have let
Jacy turn your head.

977
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:57,650
Well, she's prettier.

978
01:40:57,660 --> 01:41:00,240
I guess I shouldn't have though.

979
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:04,130
- I guess I treated her terrible.
- Guess you did.

980
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:25,560
Sure weren't out of Texas very long.

981
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:28,900
Well, Oklahoma's not much
of an improvement.

982
01:41:34,190 --> 01:41:36,550
It's not the same now.

983
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:41,540
Nothing's really been right
since Sam the Lion died.

984
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:45,680
No.

985
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,600
No, it hasn't.

986
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,020
Oh, God.

987
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:59,520
I get sad if I think of Sam for long.

988
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:05,780
Did you know he had beautiful hands?

989
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:09,580
I guess you liked him, didn't you?

990
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,110
I guess everybody did.

991
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:18,440
Well, I'll tell you.
It was different with me, Sonny.

992
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:20,760
I loved him.

993
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:23,810
He loved me too.

994
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:29,160
Are you...

995
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:33,000
Are you the one he used
to take swimmin' out in the tank?

996
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,070
He told you about that, huh?

997
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:38,310
Yeah, I was the one.

998
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:46,430
- I guess if it wasn't for Sam, I'd...
just about have missed it...

999
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:48,740
whatever it is.

1000
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:53,310
I'd have been one of them Amity types
that thinks that...

1001
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:57,650
playin' bridge is about
the best thing that life has to offer.

1002
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:07,000
Old Sam the Lion.

1003
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:12,460
"Sam the Lion." You know,
nobody knows where he got that name.

1004
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:14,670
I gave it to him.

1005
01:43:14,670 --> 01:43:19,290
One night, oh, it just came to me.

1006
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:25,000
He... He was so pleased.

1007
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:30,880
I was 22 years old then.

1008
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:34,820
Can you imagine?

1009
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:39,360
I'll tell you, Sonny...

1010
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:43,950
it's terrible to only meet one man in your
whole life who knows what you're worth.

1011
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:46,470
Just terrible.

1012
01:43:49,290 --> 01:43:51,650
I've looked too.

1013
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:55,650
You wouldn't believe
how I've looked.

1014
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:04,340
- Well, now I know why Sam liked you.
- Loved me!

1015
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:06,300
Loved you, I mean.

1016
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:09,890
Do you?

1017
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:12,500
Well, I can kind of see
what he saw in you too.

1018
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:24,440
Nope, I'll just go on home.

1019
01:44:24,450 --> 01:44:26,030
Go on, get out.

1020
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:33,660
Think I could...
think I could learn to drink?

1021
01:44:40,210 --> 01:44:42,920
You might.
You better keep on practicing.

1022
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,790
That Logan boy's
a quarterback now, ain't he?

1023
01:45:15,790 --> 01:45:18,580
Boy, we finally got us a team.

1024
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:20,960
Didn't back in your day,
did they, Sonny?

1025
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,790
Nah, we wasn't much good.

1026
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,130
Well, you just never learned
the fundamentals...

1027
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:29,800
you know, blocking and tackling...
not like this team.

1028
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:32,300
- When was it you graduated?
- Last year.

1029
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:33,890
You don't mean it?

1030
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:37,180
Seems like longer than that
since you and old Duane played ball.

1031
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:40,020
I seen old Duane a while ago.
He's home on leave.

1032
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:43,980
- Wearin' his uniform.
- I ain't seen him yet.

1033
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:50,990
- How are you, Chuck?
- Fine, Coach.

1034
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:54,330
Now, listen, see if we can't stretch
that goddamn thing a little.

1035
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:58,850
You know a man never ought to cheat...
unless'n it's for a good cause.

1036
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,500
He's a good old boy, ain't he?

1037
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:57,390
Hi, Miz Jackson. Duane here?

1038
01:46:57,390 --> 01:46:59,390
That's his car out there, ain't it?

1039
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:01,700
He's here if he ain't walked off.

1040
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:13,290
- Hi. How you been?
- Oh, pretty good.

1041
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:18,740
Yeah, I been thinking all week
that, you know, I'd run into you.

1042
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:21,370
Yeah.

1043
01:47:21,370 --> 01:47:23,370
I heard you was going off to Korea.

1044
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:26,420
I thought I'd better get over here
and see you before you got off.

1045
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,590
Glad you did.

1046
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:30,590
I'm taking the bus out
early in the morning.

1047
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:32,750
Oh.

1048
01:47:37,010 --> 01:47:39,600
Thought you might want to go
to the picture show.

1049
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,020
Miss Mosey's having to close it.
Tonight's the last night.

1050
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:47,440
Yeah, might as well go.
Hate to miss the last night.

1051
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:51,440
Take the Mercury. Be the last chance
I'll have to drive it for a while.

1052
01:47:56,910 --> 01:48:00,290
- Ready, Matthew?
- All ready.

1053
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:27,690
Take 'em to Missouri, Matt.

1054
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:32,260
- That was a good movie.
- Yeah, I seen it here before once.

1055
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:35,130
Why don't we run over to Wichita
and drink a little beer, huh?

1056
01:49:35,130 --> 01:49:37,720
Okay. I got lots of time till morning.

1057
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,490
Sure.

1058
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:43,810
- Well, so long, Miss Mosey.
- Sorry you're closing the show.

1059
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:46,560
Nobody wants to come
to shows no more.

1060
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,520
Kid baseball in the summer...

1061
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,780
television all the time.

1062
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:55,320
If Sam had lived, I...
l believe we could have kept it goin'.

1063
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:59,250
But I just didn't have the know-how.

1064
01:49:59,629 --> 01:50:01,870
Won't be much to do in town
with the picture show closed.

1065
01:50:01,870 --> 01:50:03,240
Yeah.

1066
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:07,580
Well, so long.

1067
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:09,150
Duane.

1068
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,640
You watch out now overseas.

1069
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:37,470
Sure weren't no women around.

1070
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:43,360
I guess the next piece of ass I get
will be yellow.

1071
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:46,270
Wished I was going with you.

1072
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,250
Hey, why don't you take care
of the car for me?

1073
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:52,250
What, your ma don't need it?

1074
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:55,540
I wouldn't want her driving it,
no better than she can drive.

1075
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:57,960
You might help her take the groceries home,
you got the time.

1076
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,550
Okay.

1077
01:51:11,730 --> 01:51:14,980
You ever, uh... You ever hear from Jacy?

1078
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:17,690
No, not a thing.

1079
01:51:17,690 --> 01:51:22,030
She don't get home much.
Ain't been back to town since August.

1080
01:51:22,030 --> 01:51:24,160
I guess she just stays
in Dallas all the time.

1081
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,520
Yeah, probably does.

1082
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:30,590
I guess there's lots to do down in Dallas.

1083
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:38,200
I ain't over her yet, you know.

1084
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:42,690
I ain't over her yet.

1085
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:45,830
It's the damndest thing.

1086
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:50,470
That's the only reason, uh...

1087
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:53,710
the only reason you and I
got into it that time, you know.

1088
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:57,190
Reckon she likes it down in Dallas?

1089
01:51:57,190 --> 01:52:00,240
It's hard to say.
Maybe she does.

1090
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:06,450
You reckon you and her would have got it all
straighted out if I hadn't have butted in?

1091
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:08,780
Oh, no.

1092
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:10,700
No.

1093
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:13,430
No. They'd have annulled me, too,
even if we had.

1094
01:52:15,710 --> 01:52:20,510
Y'all, uh... Y'all never even
got into the motel?

1095
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,860
No.

1096
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,570
Well.

1097
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:32,000
Better get on before we both freeze.

1098
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:44,160
Here are the keys.

1099
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,720
- So long, buddy.
- So long, Duane.

1100
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:50,330
Be careful.

1101
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:52,370
I'll take care of the Mercury for you.

1102
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:55,150
I'll see you in a year or two
if I don't get shot.

1103
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:30,170
He run right out in front of that station.

1104
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:32,340
Christ, he didn't...
Trucker didn't have a chance.

1105
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:34,470
Yeah, he's out here
all the time doin' something.

1106
01:54:34,470 --> 01:54:38,270
I could see it wasn't your fault.

1107
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:41,140
You can call the kid retarded.
You couldn't help it.

1108
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:44,940
- Sand was blowin'. I never noticed him.
- Yeah. Hard to see.

1109
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:46,650
Never figured
nobody would be in the street.

1110
01:54:46,650 --> 01:54:48,360
What was he doin' out there, anyway,
carrying that broom?

1111
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:52,450
Aw, he weren't doin' nothin'.
He's just an old simple-minded kid.

1112
01:54:52,450 --> 01:54:54,320
- Never had no sense.
- Sorta retarded. Wasn't your fault.

1113
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,370
Hell, no, mister. I can see that.

1114
01:54:56,370 --> 01:54:59,040
He was just a dumb old kid.
Never was good for nothin'.

1115
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:01,460
Didn't know enough to keep
his ass out of the cold, mornin' like this.

1116
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:03,620
Let's go to the café.
I ain't had no breakfast.

1117
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:06,790
I'd still like to know what was he doin'
lugging that broom around this time of day.

1118
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:09,800
He was sweepin', you sons of bitches!

1119
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:12,110
He was sweepin'!

1120
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:18,120
Y'all got some crazy kids
in this town, if you ask me.

1121
01:58:45,930 --> 01:58:47,310
Hi.

1122
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:54,780
Could I have a cup of coffee with you?

1123
01:58:56,940 --> 01:58:59,000
- I guess.

1124
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:08,830
I'm sorry I'm still in my bathrobe.

1125
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:34,600
What am I doing apologizing to you?

1126
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:37,570
Why am I always apologizing to you?
You little bastard!

1127
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:41,990
Three months I've been apologizing to you
without you even being here!

1128
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:45,700
I haven't done anything wrong.
Why can't I quit apologizin'?

1129
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,410
You're the one ought to be sorry.

1130
01:59:47,410 --> 01:59:49,950
I wouldn't still be in my bathrobe
if it hadn't have been for you.

1131
01:59:49,950 --> 01:59:52,040
I'd have had my clothes on hours ago.

1132
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:56,630
You're the one made me quit caring
if I got dressed or not.

1133
01:59:56,630 --> 01:59:59,250
I guess just because
your friend got killed...

1134
01:59:59,250 --> 02:00:03,050
you want me to forget what you did
and make it all right.

1135
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:05,300
I'm not sorry for you.

1136
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,970
You'd have left Billy, too,
just like you left me.

1137
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:12,310
I'll bet you left him plenty of nights
whenever Jacy whistled.

1138
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:14,350
I wouldn't treat a dog that way.

1139
02:00:14,350 --> 02:00:17,400
I guess you thought
I was so old and ugly...

1140
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:21,110
you didn't owe me any explanation,
you didn't need to be careful of me.

1141
02:00:21,110 --> 02:00:23,110
There weren't anything I could do
about you and her.

1142
02:00:23,110 --> 02:00:25,910
Why should you be careful of me?
You didn't love me.

1143
02:00:26,910 --> 02:00:29,170
Look at me.

1144
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:31,660
Can't you even look at me?

1145
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:46,300
See?

1146
02:00:47,010 --> 02:00:49,390
You shouldn't have come here.

1147
02:00:49,390 --> 02:00:52,390
I'm around that corner now.

1148
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:54,390
You've ruined it.

1149
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:56,710
It's lost completely.

1150
02:00:59,060 --> 02:01:01,440
Just your needing me
won't make it come back.

1151
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:51,180
Never you mind, honey.
Never you mind.
