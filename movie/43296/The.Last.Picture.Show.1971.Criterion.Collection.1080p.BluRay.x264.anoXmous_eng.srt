Oh, my God, Charlene.
It was just my hand.

Yeah. One thing leads to another.

172
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,830
My mama told me how that old stuff goes.

enough. You ain't even got a ducktail.

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,430
Well, anyway, I'm done late.
Let's go on home.

177
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,520
Some anniversary.

178
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,980
If that's the way you feel about it,
I'd just as soon break up, Charlene.

179
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,860
- What?
- I don't want to spoil no more anniversaries for you.

180
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,360
That's the way nice girls
get treated in this town.

181
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,450
I might have known you wasn't dependable.

182
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,120
- You wasn't even in the backfield either.
- Now, what's that got to do with it?

183
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,580
This jacket's got a hole in the pocket, but
you needn't ask me to sew it up for you.

184
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,620
And you give me back my pictures too.

185
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,960
I don't want you showing them to all the
other boys and telling 'em how hot I am.

186
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,520
You wasn't very hot.

187
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,860
I hope you ain't down in the mouth
about Charlene.

188
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,450
- I ain't blue about her.
- She don't even have a good disposition.

189
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,450
What are you blue about then?

190
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,620
There ain't nobody to go with in this town.

191
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,870
Jacy's the only pretty girl in school,
and Duane's got her.

192
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,240
I call that his tough luck.

193
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,340
You don't have to eat so fast.
You ain't in a race.

194
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,570
Jacy will bring him more misery
than she'll ever be worth.

195
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,510
Did your dad give you this?

196
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,680
He needs all he's got.

197
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,940
It wouldn't hurt you to take a little
something from him once in a while.

198
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,650
I don't know.
You and Duane both in a boardin' house.

199
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,440
Him with a mother and you with a father.
It don't seem right.

200
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,740
And your dad's taking too many pills,
you know.

201
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,570
Yeah.

202
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,500
Then I'm no one to talk.
I never did get on with Mama. Still don't.

of doctor bills to pay.

207

Well...

211
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,390

214
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,310
Joe Bob.

215
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,690
Well, I read that poem of his
about the nightingale...

216
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,150
and I didn't think it was so good.

217
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,070
Sounded like he wanted
to be a nightingale.

218
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,280
Right. I-I don't think he wanted
to be a nightingale, Joe Bob.

219
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,750
Maybe he just wanted to be immortal.

220
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,670
All you have to do to be immortal
is lead a good Christian life.

221
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,250
Anyone can do it if they love the Lord.

222
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,550
Well, maybe so, Joe Bob. Maybe so.

223
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,250
Here now. Let me... Let me read you this.

224
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,970
"When old age
shall this generation waste...

230
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,490
"That is all ye know on earth...

to be women.

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,500
Here, Joe Bob, quit flapping your arms.

236
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,670
You look like a goddamned goose.

237
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,750

you ought to be in better shape.

238
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,360

239
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,340
Tough it out! Tough it out.

240

245
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,120
Sure, Coach.

246
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,450
Now, my old lady's got to go over
to the doctor in Olney tomorrow.

247
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,710
You know women.
There's always something wrong with them.

248
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,460
Yeah, I guess.

249
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,710
Well... Take it from me.

250
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,050
Anyway, I haven't got time to drive her.

251
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,260
Now, if you'll do this for me...

252

I'll get you out of civic class.

253

I'll be glad to.
That's the best offer I've had all day.

254
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,220
You tell her you got to get back
in time for practice...

255

Duane, too, even if you don't like it.

303
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,060
I don't care. I'd just hate to
see you marry him. That's all.

304
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,480
You wouldn't be rich any more,
and in about two months...

305
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,860
- I don't care about money. Not at all.
- He'd stop flattering you.

Well, you're pretty stupid then.

Well, if daddy could do it,
Duane could too.

You're not scary enough.

I sure don't want to be like you.

- You slept with him?
- Mama!

314
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,590
We'll go to the doctor sometime
and arrange something...

315
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,800
so that you don't have to worry
about babies.

316
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,970

Unless you're married?
You know I wouldn't do that.

Oh! Don't be so mealymouthed.

319
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,770
I thought, if you slept
with him a few times...

320
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,770
you might find out that there
isn't anything magic about him.

321
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,840
Then we can send you away to a good

00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,330
Oh, you're so sexy, Duane.

453
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,560
I just wish I didn't have
to leave you tonight.

454
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,390
- Well, you don't.
- Oh, I do too.

455
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,020
- I could just kill my mother.
- What do you mean?

456
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,820
She made me promise to go to a swim party in
Wichita with what's-his-name... Lester Marlow.

457
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,360
- Well, goddamn. What kind of thing is that?
- 'Cause his folks are so rich.

458
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,950
- Don't be mad at me, Duane.
- I ain't mad at you, but goddamn it!

459
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,990
It's all Lester's fault.
He keeps asking Mama.

460
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,490
- Well, goddamn!
- All I wanna do is stay with the man I love.

461
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,050
Goddamn!

462
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,310
No, no, Duane.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

463
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,570
What do you think you're doing,
asking my girl for a date?

464
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,410
- You turn me loose!
- I'll turn you loose anytime you're ready to fight.

465
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,040
Come on. Let's have it out.
Come on, Marlow!

466
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,840
Here, knock off that shit, boys.
This is the Christmas season.

467
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:11,970
Run along here, Wichita. I can't stand here
all night protecting your shoeshine.

468
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,760
I just don't know
what I'm gonna do about him.

469
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,980
He's so crazy about me,
he doesn't have good sense.

470
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,150
Well, I'm not saying anything against
Duane, but that's a roughneck for you.

471
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,200
They never are very sophisticated
about these things.

472
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,140
Well, merry Christmas!

473
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,850
Come in and let's have some punch, boys.

474
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,750
Hi, Sonny.

475
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,170
- Oh, hi.
- Want to help me?

476
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,480
Okay.

477
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,640
You're not dancing.
Don't you have a girlfriend?

478
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,400
Well, I did have.
We broke up a couple months ago.

479
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,440
Oh? Why?

480
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Do you mind my asking?

481
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,360
I was goin' with Charlene Duggs.

482
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,510
She thought I got fresh with her.
I never did really.

483
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,950
I guess we broke up because we didn't
like each other much to begin with.

484
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,370
I hope you're not sad about it.

485
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,330
I don't think Charlene's
near nice enough for you.

486
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,670
Didn't see you dancing.

487
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,030
No, I don't dance much.

488
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,720
Will you drive me to the clinic
again next week?

489
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,080
Oh, you bet.

490
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,300

Duane, been lookin' for you.
Where's Jacy?

528
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,620
Aw, don't remind him.
We just got him quiet. You want a drink?

529
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,120
- Okay. Where'd you get it?
- Found it in a guy's car.

530
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,460
- When he weren't looking.
- Let's all go do something!

531
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,840
Good idea! Why don't we try
and hunt up some pussy?

532
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,710
Aw, you wouldn't know
what to do with it if we found some.

533
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,590
Hey. What happened, Duane?

534
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,970
Lester took his girl to a swimming party.

535
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,060
Let's all go out and get a fuck.

536
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,310
Hey, I know where there's a heifer.
It belongs to my Uncle Hank.

537
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,850
Yeah. Why the hell not?

538
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,560
- I say a heifer beats nothin'.
- Pussy's pussy.

539
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,820
I don't want no heifer.

540
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,690
Hell, what we ought to do
is buy Billy here a piece of ass.

541
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,780
- Yeah, we oughtn't let him die a virgin.
- Yeah.

542
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,280
Mama says idiot kids
don't live long anyway.

543
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,370
He ain't no idiot kid.
He just don't talk.

544
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,160
I bet he's still a virgin though.

545
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,540
Hey, we oughta fix him up
with Jimmie Sue.

546
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,380
- Ew!
- It wouldn't make no difference to Billy.

547
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,710
Look, I don't think
we should try anything like that.

548
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,510
Why not? It wouldn't cost us
more than a dollar and a half.

549
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,880
Hell, if that's all she costs,
we ought to get her ourselves.

550
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,640
Shit! Heifer's better than Jimmie Sue.

551
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,100
Get the stupid little thing in here.
I ain't got all night.

552
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,470
Come on. Let's get those pants off, boys.

553
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Whoo!

554
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,520
You ain't gonna be a virgin much longer.

555
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,060
Come on, Billy. We're gonna get you laid.

556
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,900
Whoo!

557
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,900
Strap her on, Billy. Now come on.

558
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,350
- Do the job, Billy.
- Get her, Billy boy.

559
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,830
Why, this is the dumbest thing I ever seen!

560
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,000
- He don't even know what to do.
- Come on, Billy!

561
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,750
Damn it. Put it to her, boy.

562
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,670
- Get her, Billy.
- Come on, Billy. Screw it to her, boy!

563
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,380
You kids stop that yelling out there.
Got a hold of this thing. It ain't even in!

564
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,680
Goddamn... What you...
Goddamn, you stupid little thing!

565
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,910
Couldn't even wait. Look at this mess!

566
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,210
- You okay, Billy?
- You all right?

567
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:30,210
Well, now I know.
Idiot's as bad as Mexicans.

568
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,300
Don't bother me no more
for that crazy thing.

569
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,820
Wouldn't mess with him again
for less than three and a half.

570
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,420
Which one of you bloodied his nose?

571
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,880
I've told y'all not to fight with Billy
'cause he don't understand about fightin'.

572
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,970
- What happened, Sonny?
- It weren't none of us, Sam.

573
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,970
Nah. It was Jimmie Sue.

574
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:23,010
Jimmie Sue?
How'd he get messed up with her?

575
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,640
We all chipped in
and bought him a piece of ass.

576
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,560
Thought he was getting tired
of being a virgin.

577
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,310
She got mad about somethin'
and bloodied his nose.

578
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,280
Now, you boys can get on out of here. I
don't want to have no more to do with you.

579
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,120
Scaring a poor,
unfortunate creature like Billy...

580
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,870
just so's you could have a few laughs.

581
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,960
I've been around
that trashy behavior all my life.

582
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,750
I'm getting tired of putting up with it.

583
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,840
Now, you can stay out of this pool hall...

584
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,640
out of my café
and my picture show too.

585
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,050
I don't want no more of your business.

586
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:04,760
We didn't mean for anything bad
to happen, Sam. We...

587
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:09,340
You didn't even have the decency
to wash his face.

588
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,500
We're his best customers.
He can't run us off.

589
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,570
Can he?

590
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:52,020
Lucky I fell asleep.
I'd hate not to be able to shoot no pool.

591
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,700
You're sure he won't come?

592
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,640
You know he won't.
He's just startin' basketball practice.

593
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,420
It's all right.

594
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,470
I'm sorry I cried.

595
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,370
Just a-scared, I guess.

596
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,080
Oh, he ain't gonna come.

597
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,790
They're probably running plays
right now, I bet.

598
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,150
No, not scared of that.

599
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,750
Scared I could never do this, I guess.

600
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:55,090
Can't seem to do anything
without crying about it.

- No.

633
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,630
He was there, wasn't he?

634
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,580
Just didn't have the decency
to own up to it.

635
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,340
Oh, don't worry.
I won't tell on him. I should though.

00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,430

- Nothin'.

You don't need my advice anyway.

- Mm-mmm.

Hey, how come you've stayed
with the coach?

You don't like him much.

672
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,620
Oh, I weren't brought up
to leave a husband.

673
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,960
I guess that's why.

674
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,320
Maybe I was just scared to.

675
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,210
I never noticed how ugly this room is.

676
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,670
- What's your favorite color?
- Oh, I don't know. Blue.

677
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:26,640
- Maybe I'll repaper it.
- Well, why'd you marry him?

678
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,300
I don't know.
My mother didn't like him.

679
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,640
Maybe that was it.

680
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,730
But I was 20 years old.

681
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,660
I thought hairy-chested football coaches
were about it.

682
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,070
I'm gonna buy us a new quilt.

683
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,780
A blue one.

684
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,530
What do you think he'd do
if he found us?

685
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,990
Shoot us probably.

686
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,530
He's always glad to have an excuse
to use his deer rifle.

687
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:11,890
I thought you boys wanted to fish.

688
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:14,990
Come on.
Keep an eye on them corks, Billy.

689
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,610
I don't think there's anything
in this tank 'cept turtles.

690
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:26,530
That's what I like about it,
tell you the truth.

691
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,890
- Want to try one?
- Sure.

692
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,040
I never liked to clean fish
or eat them either.

693
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,040
Spend half your time picking out bones.

694
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,250
Yeah, I just come out here
to get a little scenery.

695
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:46,160
Too pretty a day to spend in town.

696
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,800
You wouldn't believe
how this country's changed.

697
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:59,810
First time I seen it,
there wasn't a mesquite tree on it...

698
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,440
or a prickly pear neither.

699
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,190
I used to own this land, you know.

700
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:10,950
First time I watered a horse at this tank
was more than 40 years ago.

701
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,490
I reckon the reason
why I always drag you out here...

702
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:20,220
is probably I'm just as sentimental as the
next fella when it comes to old times.

703
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,130
Old times.

704
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:30,380
I brought a young lady
swimming out here once.

705
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,940
More than 20 years ago.

706
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:40,230
It was after my wife had lost her mind
and my boys was dead.

707
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,690
Me and this young lady
was pretty wild, I guess.

708
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:50,920
In pretty deep.

709
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,120
We used to come out here a-horseback
and go swimmin' without no bathin' suits.

710
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:04,710
One day, she wanted
to swim the horses across this tank.

711
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:08,250
Kind of a crazy thing to do,
but we done it anyway.

712
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:12,690
She bet me a silver dollar
she could beat me across.

713
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,480
She did.

714
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:19,850
This old horse I was a-ridin'
didn't want to take the water.

715
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:23,790
But she was always lookin'
for somethin' to do like that.

716
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,000
Somethin' wild.

717
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:31,720
I'll bet she's still got
that silver dollar.

718
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,210
Whatever happened to her?

719
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,290
Oh, she growed up.

720
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:43,040
She was just a girl then really.

721
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,600
Here, let me help you with that.

722
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:51,160
Why didn't you ever marry her
after your wife died?

723
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,830
She was already married.

724
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,690
Her and her husband was young
and miserable with one another...

725
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:06,690
like so many young married folks are.

726
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:11,910
I thought they'd change with some
age, but... didn't turn out that way.

727
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,530
Ls being married always so miserable?

728
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:18,370
No, not really.
About 80% of the time, I guess.

729
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:24,500
We ought to go
to a real fishing tank next year.

730
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,990
Nah, it don't do to think about
things like that too much.

731
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,380
If she was here, I'd probably be
just as crazy now as I was then...

732
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,700
in about five minutes.

733
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,710
Ain't that ridiculous?

734
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,680
No, it ain't really...

735
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,480
'cause being crazy about a woman like her
is always the right thing to do.

736
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,570
Being a decrepit old bag of bones...

737
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,900
that's what's ridiculous.

738

- You don't know about it.
- About what?

824
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:52,400
Sam died yesterday morning.

825
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,930
- Died?
- Yep. Quite a blow.

826
01:05:56,930 --> 01:06:00,720
Keeled over on one of the snooker tables.
Had a stroke.

He was quite a feller.

830
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,910

That's for sure.

craziest thing you ever heard.

832

What do you think about that?

833
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,920
He left Genevieve the café.

834
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,270
That's the only thing he done
that made any sense.

835
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,550
Left the picture show to old Miss Mosey.

I'll show you the pool hall.

- Aren't there people there?
- If there are, they'll be in back asleep now.

960
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:51,980
Won't bother us. Got my own key.

Goodness, it sure is dark in here.

What a night. I never thought
somethin' like this would happen.

01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:21,510
How about hoppin' out?

965
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,540
And in Chicago today...

966
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:40,330
Governor Adlai E. Stevenson accepted
the Democratic presidential nomination...

967
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:43,840
and picked Senator John Sparkman of Alabama
to be his running mate.

968
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:48,380
In Dallas County, General Dwight D. Eisenhower
scored a second landslide victory...

969
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,720
over old guard Republican forces...

970

Oh, he's just awful, Mama!
Why do you fool with him?

971
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,890
Daddy's a nicer man than him, isn't he?

972
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:04,270
Oh, he sure is, beautiful.
Your daddy's a very nice man.

Bobby was the last one.

975
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,780
- No.
- I'm just gonna be an old maid.

Honey, that's just the way
it goes sometimes, you know?

977
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:16,410
- You win a few, you lose a few.
- What do you do?

978
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:18,700
Nothing's ever the way
it's supposed to be at all.

979
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:20,970
You're right. Come on.

worked out too well.

982

I think maybe we better think
of something else for you, huh?

983
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,890
Right now, I guess Ruth Popper's
got about as good a setup as anyone.

984
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:39,930
- Ruth Popper?
- I think Sonny's reasonably good-looking...

985
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:43,350
- Sonny? Sonny Crawford?

headed out of town toward Olney...

we go out, eat Mexican food or something.

I never done nothin' to you.

- I ain't screwing her.

- Hell you ain't!
- Well, I ain't.

1104
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:31,130
- She's not your girl any more anyhow.
- She is my girl. I don't care if we did break up.

1105
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:33,130

her back. I'm tellin' you right now.

1107
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,760
She's gonna marry me one of these days
when I get a little bit more money.

1108
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,560
- She won't marry you.
- Sure, she will.

1109
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,560
- We always meant to get married.
- She's going off to college soon.

1110
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:45,480
I doubt I'll ever get to go with her
again myself once she gets off.

1111
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,480
I never saw what it could hurt
to go with her this summer though.

1112
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,320
- She's never gonna marry you.
- She is, by God! Don't you tell me she won't!

1113
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:54,150
She'd never let you screw her.
That's for sure.

1114
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:56,990
Hell, I was just seein'
how honest you was.

1115
01:31:56,990 --> 01:32:00,740
Jacy would never let you screw her.
You ain't that good a cocksman.

1116
01:32:01,069 --> 01:32:03,830
You never even screwed Charlene Duggs
all that time you went with her.

1117
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:06,330
Course I didn't. You know why?

1118
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:09,540

all time Saturday night! That's why.

1119
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:11,630
Nobody could have screwed her
in the time I had left.

1120
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:14,670
I could have screwed her in five minutes.
I wouldn't even need no pickup.

1121
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:17,970
Oh, yeah? Well, the only reason
she went with you as long as she did...

1122
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:20,100
was 'cause you was in the backfield
and I was in the goddamn line.

Well, I had to leave 'em a note, you know, so
they wouldn't be worried out of their minds.

1205
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:50,800
You shouldn't have done that.

1206
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,350
I had to.
I figured they'd have to know sometime.

1207
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:55,720
Well, what could they get us for?

1208
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,850
We got a right to get married,
ain't we?

1209
01:37:58,850 --> 01:38:01,210
I guess so.

1210
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,320
I wish you didn't have that stupid
eye patch. It's really creepy.

1211
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:10,030
I can take it off pretty soon.

1212
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:13,570
'Bout two hours,
we'll be in Lake Texoma...

1213
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:15,870
and have a room to ourself, hmm?

1214
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:19,610

Howdy. What part of Texas y'all from?

1225
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,050
- Anarene.
- Newlyweds, ain't you?

1226
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:20,060
Well, y'all better follow me on in.
I think somebody's lookin' for you.

1227
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:22,270
We ain't done nothin' wrong.
Ain't we got a right to get married?

1228
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:24,810
- How can you arrest us just like that?
- I ain't arresting you.

1229
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:27,310
I just want you to come with me
till we find out somethin'.

1230
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,280
I don't know what your rights are.

1231
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,190
I guess we better follow him, honey.

1232
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:33,950
I'll just be heartbroken
if my folks have done this.

1233
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:42,460
You think I worked like a dog all my life
so my daughter can end up in a pool hall?

1234
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:44,250
We was gonna get another apartment.

1235
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,750
I'll bet you was.
Where are your car keys, hon?

1236
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:49,090
It's a hell of a note. A hell of a note.
Just a hell of a note!

1237
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:51,300
- Oh, shut up and take her home.
- You bet I will!

1238
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,130
- I'm tired of this.
- You take her car.

1239
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:55,490
As far as I'm concerned,
he can walk!

1240
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:26,330
Not much of a wedding night, huh?

1241
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:28,750
Nope, not much of one.

1242
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:32,340
Here, have a little drink of bourbon.
It'll pick you up.

1243
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:34,650
Take all of it. I'm gonna drive.

1244
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:41,810
You won't believe this, Sonny, but you're lucky
we got you clear of her quick as we did.

1245
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:45,270
You'd have been a lot better off
staying with Ruth Popper.

1246
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:47,350
Does everybody know about that?

1247
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:49,650
Of course.

1248
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:52,020
Sounded like a good deal to me, kiddo.

1249
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:54,240
You shouldn't have let
Jacy turn your head.

1250
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:57,150
Well, she's prettier.

1251
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,740
I guess I shouldn't have though.

1252
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:03,630
- I guess I treated her terrible.
- Guess you did.

1253
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:25,060
Sure weren't out of Texas very long.

1254
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:28,400
Well, Oklahoma's not much
of an improvement.

1255
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:36,050
It's not the same now.

1256
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:41,040
Nothing's really been right
since Sam the Lion died.

1257
01:41:43,410 --> 01:41:45,180
No.

1258
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,100
No, it hasn't.

1259
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:53,520
Oh, God.

1260
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:59,020
I get sad if I think of Sam for long.

1261
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,280
Did you know he had beautiful hands?

1262
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:09,080
I guess you liked him, didn't you?

1263
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,610
I guess everybody did.

1264
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,940
Well, I'll tell you.
It was different with me, Sonny.

1265
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:20,260
I loved him.

1266
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:23,310
He loved me too.

1267
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:28,660
Are you...

1268
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:32,500
Are you the one he used
to take swimmin' out in the tank?

1269
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:34,570
He told you about that, huh?

1270
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,810
Yeah, I was the one.

1271
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:45,930
- I guess if it wasn't for Sam, I'd...
- Just about have missed it...

1272
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:48,240
whatever it is.

1273
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:52,810
I'd have been one of them Amity types
that thinks that...

1274
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:57,150
playin' bridge is about
the best thing that life has to offer.

1275
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:06,500
Old Sam the Lion.

1276
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:11,960
"Sam the Lion." You know,
nobody knows where he got that name.

1277
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:14,170
I gave it to him.

1278
01:43:14,170 --> 01:43:18,790
One night, oh, it just came to me.

1279
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,500
He... He was so pleased.

1280
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:30,380
I was 22 years old then.

1281
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:34,320
Can you imagine?

1282
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:38,860
I'll tell you, Sonny...

1283
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:43,450
it's terrible to only meet one man in your
whole life who knows what you're worth.

1284
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,970
Just terrible.

1285
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:51,150
I've looked too.

1286
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:55,150
You wouldn't believe
how I've looked.

1287
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:03,840
- Well, now I know why Sam liked you.
- Loved me!

1288
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,800
Loved you, I mean.

1289
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:09,390
Do you?

1290
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:12,000
Well, I can kind of see
what he saw in you too.

1291
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:23,940
Nope, I'll just go on home.

1292
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:25,530
Go on, get out.

1298
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:18,080
Boy, we finally got us a team.

1299
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,460
Didn't back in your day,
did they, Sonny?

1300

Nah, we wasn't much good.

not like this team.

That's his car out there, ain't it?

- Oh, pretty good.

1322
01:47:15,410 --> 01:47:18,240
Yeah, I been thinking all week
that, you know, I'd run into you.

1323
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:20,870
Yeah.

1324
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:22,870
I heard you was going off to Korea.

1325
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:25,920
I thought I'd better get over here
and see you before you got off.

1326
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,090
Glad you did.

1327
01:47:28,090 --> 01:47:30,090
I'm taking the bus out
early in the morning.

1328
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:32,250
Oh.

1329
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:39,100
Thought you might want to go
to the picture show.

1330
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:42,520
Miss Mosey's having to close it.
Tonight's the last night.

1331
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:46,940
Yeah, might as well go.
Hate to miss the last night.

1332
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:50,940
Take the Mercury. Be the last chance
I'll have to drive it for a while.

1333
01:47:56,410 --> 01:47:59,790
- Ready, Matthew?
- All ready.

1334
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:27,190
Take 'em to Missouri, Matt.

- Yeah, I seen it here before once.

1347
01:49:31,790 --> 01:49:34,630
Why don't we run over to Wichita
and drink a little beer, huh?

1348
01:49:34,630 --> 01:49:37,220
Okay. I got lots of time till morning.

- Sorry you're closing the show.

1351
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:46,060
Nobody wants to come

If Sam had lived, I...
l believe we could have kept it goin'.

1355
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:58,750
But I just didn't have the know-how.

1356
01:49:59,129 --> 01:50:01,370
Won't be much to do in town
with the picture show closed.

1357
01:50:01,370 --> 01:50:02,740
Yeah.

1358
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:07,080
Well, so long.

1359
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,650
Duane.

1360
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:12,140
You watch out now overseas.

1361
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:24,310
♪ Each night I laid there in prison ♪

1362
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:31,150
♪ I pictured a future so bright ♪

1363
01:50:34,610 --> 01:50:36,970
Sure weren't no women around.

1364
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:42,860
I guess the next piece of ass I get
will be yellow.

1365
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:45,770
Wished I was going with you.

1366
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:49,750
Hey, why don't you take care
of the car for me?

1367
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,750
What, your ma don't need it?

1368
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:55,040
I wouldn't want her driving it,
no better than she can drive.

1369
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,460
You might help her take the groceries home,
you got the time.

1370
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:59,050
Okay.

1371
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:14,480
You ever, uh... You ever hear from Jacy?

1372
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,190
No, not a thing.

1373
01:51:17,190 --> 01:51:21,530
She don't get home much.
Ain't been back to town since August.

1374
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:23,660
I guess she just stays
in Dallas all the time.

1375
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:26,020
Yeah, probably does.

1376
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:30,090
I guess there's lots to do down in Dallas.

1377
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:37,700
I ain't over her yet, you know.

1378
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:42,190
I ain't over her yet.

1379
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:45,330
It's the damndest thing.

1380
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,970
That's the only reason, uh...

1381
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:53,210
the only reason you and I
got into it that time, you know.

1382
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,690
Reckon she likes it down in Dallas?

1383
01:51:56,690 --> 01:51:59,740
It's hard to say.
Maybe she does.

1384
01:52:02,510 --> 01:52:05,950
You reckon you and her would have got it all
straighted out if I hadn't have butted in?

1385
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:08,280
Oh, no.

1386
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,200
No.

1387
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,930
No. They'd have annulled me, too,
even if we had.

1388
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:20,010
Y'all, uh... Y'all never even
got into the motel?

1389
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,360
No.

1390
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:28,070
Well.

1391
01:52:28,850 --> 01:52:31,500
Better get on before we both freeze.

1392
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:43,660
Here are the keys.

1393
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:47,220
- So long, buddy.
- So long, Duane.

1394
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:49,830
Be careful.

1395
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:51,870
I'll take care of the Mercury for you.

1396
01:52:51,870 --> 01:52:54,650
I'll see you in a year or two
if I don't get shot.

1397
01:54:27,630 --> 01:54:29,670
He run right out in front of that station.

1398
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,840
Christ, he didn't...
Trucker didn't have a chance.

1399
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,970
Yeah, he's out here
all the time doin' something.

1400
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:37,770
I could see it wasn't your fault.

1401
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:40,640
You can call the kid retarded.
You couldn't help it.

1402
01:54:40,650 --> 01:54:44,440
- Sand was blowin'. I never noticed him.
- Yeah. Hard to see.

1403
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:46,150
Never figured
nobody would be in the street.

1404
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:47,860
What was he doin' out there, anyway,
carrying that broom?

1405
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:51,950
Aw, he weren't doin' nothin'.
He's just an old simple-minded kid.

1406
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:53,820
- Never had no sense.
- Sorta retarded. Wasn't your fault.

1407
01:54:53,820 --> 01:54:55,870
Hell, no, mister. I can see that.

1408
01:54:55,870 --> 01:54:58,540
He was just a dumb old kid.
Never was good for nothin'.

1409
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:00,960
Didn't know enough to keep
his ass out of the cold, mornin' like this.

1410
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,120
Let's go to the café.
I ain't had no breakfast.

1411
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:06,290
I'd still like to know what was he doin'
lugging that broom around this time of day.

1412
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:09,300
He was sweepin', you sons of bitches!

1413
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,610
He was sweepin'!

1414
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:17,620
Y'all got some crazy kids
in this town, if you ask me.

1415
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:46,810
Hi.

1416
01:58:49,850 --> 01:58:54,280
Could I have a cup of coffee with you?

1417
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:59,900
- I guess.
- Leave them alone.

1418
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:02,280
Leave them alone.

1419
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:05,730
It's in the book!

1420
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:08,330
I'm sorry I'm still in my bathrobe.

1421
01:59:08,330 --> 01:59:10,640
Leave them alone.

1422
01:59:12,210 --> 01:59:17,010
And they... they being the sheep...

1423
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:19,130
they will come.

1424
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:21,970
Oh, yes, they'll come.

1425
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:26,550
Oh, there'll be a brighter day tomorrow.
They will come.

1426
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:29,000
It's in the book.

1427
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:34,100
What am I doing apologizing to you?

1428
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:37,070
Why am I always apologizing to you?
You little bastard!

1429
01:59:38,110 --> 01:59:41,490
Three months I've been apologizing to you
without you even being here!

1430
01:59:41,490 --> 01:59:45,200
I haven't done anything wrong.
Why can't I quit apologizin'?

1431
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:46,910
You're the one ought to be sorry.

1432
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:49,450
I wouldn't still be in my bathrobe
if it hadn't have been for you.

1433
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:51,540
I'd have had my clothes on hours ago.

1434
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:56,130
You're the one made me quit caring
if I got dressed or not.

1435
01:59:56,130 --> 01:59:58,750
I guess just because
your friend got killed...

1436
01:59:58,750 --> 02:00:02,550
you want me to forget what you did
and make it all right.

1437
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:04,800
I'm not sorry for you.

1438
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,470
You'd have left Billy, too,
just like you left me.

1439
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:11,810
I'll bet you left him plenty of nights
whenever Jacy whistled.

1440
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:13,850
I wouldn't treat a dog that way.

1441
02:00:13,850 --> 02:00:16,900
I guess you thought
I was so old and ugly...

1442
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:20,610
you didn't owe me any explanation,
you didn't need to be careful of me.

1443
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:22,610
There weren't anything I could do
about you and her.

1444
02:00:22,610 --> 02:00:25,410
Why should you be careful of me?
You didn't love me.

1445
02:00:25,410 --> 02:00:27,670
Look at me.

1446
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:31,160
Can't you even look at me?

1447
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:45,800
See?

1448
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:48,890
You shouldn't have come here.

1449
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:51,890
I'm around that corner now.

1450
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:53,890
You've ruined it.

1451
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:56,210
It's lost completely.

1452
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:00,940
Just your needing me
won't make it come back.
