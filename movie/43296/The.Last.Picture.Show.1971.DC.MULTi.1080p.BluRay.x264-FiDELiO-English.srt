1
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:29,609
<i>President Truman will be here tomorrow,
so all you folks in Dallas turn out.</i>

2
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:32,904
<i>This is Cowboy Rhythms on KTRN,
Wichita Falls.</i>

3
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,990
<i>Here's Hank Williams' big hit tune,
"Cold, Cold Heart."</i>

4
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,165
You ain't ever gonna amount to nothing.

5
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:48,253
Already spent a dime this morning,
ain't even had a decent breakfast.

6
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,214
Give me the chalk.

7
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,762
Why don't you comb your hair, Sonny?

8
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:01,015
It sticks up.
Look like you smelled a wolf.

9
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,610
I'm surprised
you had the nerve to show up…

10
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,988
… after that stomping
you all took last night.

11
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,532
- Well, could've been worse.
- What'd you say?

12
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,328
- Could've been worse.
- Yeah.

13
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,998
You can say that
about nearly everything, I guess.

14
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,588
A few football teams have had
some luck with tackling.

15
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:34,299
Keeps the other team
from scoring quite so often.

16
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,801
Sounds too rough for me.

17
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,394
You don't even care
if it was your last game.

18
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,231
You ain't ever gonna get stomped for
your own high-school ball team again.

19
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,651
- Where's your school spirit?
- Don't know.

20
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,323
You working today?

21
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,617
The truck's being greased.

22
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:28,519
So, you see, this is what I get for betting
on my own hometown ball team.

23
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,731
I ought to have better sense.

24
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:34,442
Wouldn't hurt if you had
a better hometown.

25
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,737
You mind pointing that
at the floor till I get by?

26
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,281
I don't want my eye poked out.

27
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,579
Don't let Billy get too far away,
will you, son?

28
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:52,919
You're damn more dangerous in a pool
hall than you are on a football field.

29
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,422
Hey.

30
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,258
You ever heard of tackling?

31
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,610
Hey, Duane!

32
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,488
Boy, I froze my ass last night!

33
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,866
Hey, why the hell
can't you kids learn to tackle?

34
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:38,756
Hey, how about taking Genevieve some
change, being as you're going that way?

35
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,728
Toss me one!

36
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,856
Pick up the ball, Crawford.

37
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,067
Look, Larry, they can catch.

38
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:01,362
Feisty sons of bitches, aren't they?
Wish they could tackle.

39
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,656
Or do something useful.

40
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:07,035
Team wasn't worth
a kiss-my-ass this year.

41
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:18,504
Fade out, Crawford. One more time.

42
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:24,427
All right, you boys. Cut it out.

43
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:27,930
I got enough problems without you
playing that game over again.

44
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:31,100
We could've run off
to Mexico with this, you know.

45
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,813
- Hey, play the new one we heard.
- Which one?

46
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,273
Down payment on breakfast.

47
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,275
Let somebody prosperous play
the jukebox.

48
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:42,070
Nobody prosperous would eat here.

49
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,787
- Well, I ain't very hungry.
- Well, I am.

50
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,705
You want the pickup first tonight?

51
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:55,083
I oughtn't get it first every Saturday.
It's half yours.

52
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,834
- Go ahead.
- You sure?

53
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,046
Sure, I'm sure. Anyways, I got lots
of deliveries to make.

54
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,256
- And I have to go clear to Ranger.
- Okay.

55
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,718
I'll be lucky to get back
for the second show.

56
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:52,098
My goodness, Sonny.

57
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,475
Frank oughtn't work you so late
on weekends.

58
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,102
That's what I keep telling him.

59
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,647
You ain't got in in time
to see the comedy in three weeks.

60
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,859
Hope you don't want popcorn,
because there ain't none.

61
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,027
And you missed the newsreel too.

62
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,990
The main show's done started,
so I'll just charge you 30 cents.

63
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:10,283
Thanks, Miss Mosey.

64
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,453
<i>I was wondering if my daughter had</i>
<i>deserted us too, when I heard her voice.</i>

65
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,082
<i>Pa! Pa! Hi, Pa.</i>

66
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,917
<i>Kay was our only daughter.</i>

67
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:24,213
<i>I know a father's not supposed</i>
<i>to have favourites, but when it's Kay….</i>

68
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,300
<i>- You smell good.</i>
<i>- You like it?</i>

69
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,428
<i>- What's that?</i>
<i>- An atomiser.</i>

70
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,054
<i>What'd you get? A present?</i>

71
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,931
<i>Who from?</i>

72
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,766
<i>Somebody.</i>

73
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:44,525
I decided you had a wreck.

74
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,532
<i>What's happened to you?</i>
<i>You look different.</i>

75
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,868
<i>- I do?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

76
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,371
<i>You look all lit up inside.</i>

77
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:00,583
<i>You're not wearing</i>
<i>your usual deadpan look.</i>

78
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,294
<i>That "How'd I ever get</i>
<i>into this family?" look.</i>

79
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,129
<i>Father.</i>

80
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,673
<i>You've been taking those vitamins</i>
<i>Dr Gray sent you.</i>

81
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,634
<i>That's right.</i>

82
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:26,150
<i>I guess I'll get me</i>
<i>some of those vitamins.</i>

83
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,653
<i>I'll get it, Delilah.</i>

84
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,574
<i>What's the matter with her?</i>
<i>She looks kind of queer.</i>

85
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,953
- Guess what.
- What?

86
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:42,041
- It's our anniversary.
- What?

87
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,753
We've been going steady a year tonight.

88
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,463
Yeah?

89
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:51,550
Seems like a lot longer.

90
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:55,012
You should've got me
some anniversary present.

91
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:58,057
You can have another stick of gum.
That's all I got on me.

92
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,558
You can give me a dollar too.

93
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,561
That's how much it cost me
and Marlene for the show.

94
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,940
Hi. What are y'all doing
back here in the dark?

95
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,362
<i>- He's coming for me in a few minutes.</i>
<i>- I'll get your coffee.</i>

96
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,867
<i>- Where'd the boys go?</i>
<i>- Ben had some date.</i>

97
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,661
<i>Tommy went for basketball practice.</i>

98
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:26,043
I don't see why they should get
the pickup first all the time.

99
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,005
All they ever wanna do is neck anyway.

100
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,384
<i>Buckley says that's not too young</i>
<i>for them to marry.</i>

101
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,512
<i>- I didn't marry your mother till I was 25.</i>
<i>- Oh, I know, Pop.</i>

102
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:45,313
- Need some help, Jessie?
- Yeah, sure do.

103
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,106
- So long, Sam.
- Bye, Sam.

104
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:48,316
- Come on.
- Good night.

105
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,110
- Good night. Sure did like the picture.
- Well, good.

106
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,154
- Good night.
- Good night.

107
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,696
Crack your window.
Leave the motor running.

108
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,240
It's just too cold in here.

109
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,255
Your hands are like ice!

110
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,966
Put on my gloves.

111
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:18,322
What's the matter with you?
You act plain bored.

112
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:22,159
Quit! Quit!

113
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:24,620
You said this was our anniversary.

114
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,956
Let's do something different.

115
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:30,209
Well, I like that! You cheapskate.

116
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:34,004
Didn't even get me a present,
and now you wanna get me pregnant.

117
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,965
My God, Charlene!
It was just my hand.

118
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,426
Yeah. One thing leads to another.

119
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,345
My mama told me
how that old stuff goes.

120
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,765
We'll have plenty of time for that
when we get married.

121
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,226
You wasn't no livelier than me.

122
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:51,605
Because you ain't good-looking enough.
You ain't even got a ducktail.

123
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,816
Well, anyway, I'm done late.

124
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,026
Let's go on home.

125
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,404
Some anniversary.

126
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:02,950
If that's the way you feel about it,
I'd just as soon break up, Charlene.

127
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:06,454
I don't wanna spoil
no more anniversaries for you.

128
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,039
That's the way
nice girls get treated in this town!

129
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,041
I might've known you wasn't dependable.

130
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,127
You wasn't even in the backfield either.

131
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:17,089
This jacket's got a hole in the pocket,
but don't ask me to sew it for you.

132
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,175
You can give me back my pictures too.

133
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,553
I don't want you showing all
the other boys and telling how hot I am.

134
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,014
You wasn't very hot.

135
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,500
I hope you ain't down
in the mouth about Charlene.

136
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,670
- I ain't blue about her.
- What are you blue about then?

137
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,173
Ain't nobody to go with in this town.

138
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,426
Jacy's the only pretty girl in school
and Duane's got her.

139
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,179
I'd call that his tough luck.

140
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,682
You don't have to eat so fast.
You ain't in a race.

141
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:12,311
Jacy will bring you more misery
than she'll ever be worth.

142
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,066
Did your dad give you this?

143
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,276
He needs all he's got.

144
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:23,239
Wouldn't hurt you to take something
from him once in a while.

145
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,326
I don't know. You and Duane
both in a boarding house.

146
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:31,163
Him with the mother, and you
with the father. Don't seem right.

147
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,500
And your dad's taking
too many pills, you know.

148
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,085
Yeah.

149
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,629
But I'm no one to talk.

150
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,090
I never did get on with Mama.
I still don't.

151
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,842
Say, I hear Dan's going back
to work soon.

152
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,388
- I guess you'll be quitting before long.
- Honey…

153
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:52,142
… we got 4000 dollars' worth
of doctor bills to pay.

154
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:56,647
I will probably be making cheeseburgers
for your grandkids.

155
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:06,115
Look at it. Your little ducktail over here.

156
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,645
Well…

157
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,232
… I wonder what my chances are,
this morning…

158
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,651
… of interesting you kids in John Keats.

159
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,570
None at all.

160
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,075
Joe Bob?

161
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,828
I read that poem of his
about the nightingale.

162
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,663
I didn't think it was so good.

163
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,791
Sounded like he wanted
to be a nightingale.

164
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,920
I don't think he wanted
to be a nightingale, Joe Bob.

165
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,298
Maybe he just wanted to be immortal.

166
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:08,302
All you have to do to be immortal
is lead a good Christian life.

167
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:11,138
Anyone can do it if they love the Lord.

168
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,974
Well, maybe so, Joe Bob, maybe so.

169
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,477
Here now, let me—
Let me read you this.

170
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:21,565
"When old age shall
this generation waste…

171
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:26,195
… thou shalt remain
in midst of other woe than ours…

172
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:30,658
… a friend to man,
to whom thou say'st:

173
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,286
'Beauty is truth, truth beauty'—

174
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,122
That is all ye know on earth…

175
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:39,249
… and all ye need to know."

176
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,418
Run, you little pissants, run!

177
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:45,506
Tough it out! Tough it out!
You gotta be men like the rest of us.

178
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,633
Ain't none of you pretty enough
to be women.

179
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,218
Here, Joe Bob.

180
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:52,221
Quit flapping your arms.
You look like a goddamn goose.

181
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,349
Even for a preacher's boy,
you ought to be in better shape.

182
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,601
What kind of female
are you ever gonna get?

183
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,939
Tough it out! Tough it out!

184
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,108
Run, you little pissants.

185
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:08,278
All right, off the court.

186
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:13,701
If you all didn't jack off so damn much,
maybe you could stay in shape.

187
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,619
Come here a minute, Sonny.

188
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,166
Now, you do me a favour,
and I'll do you one.

189
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,127
Sure, coach.

190
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,048
My old lady's got to go
to the doctor tomorrow.

191
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,092
You know women.
Always something wrong.

192
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,385
Yeah, I guess.

193
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:36,598
Well, take it from me. Anyway,
I haven't got have time to drive her.

194
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:40,978
Now, if you'll do this for me,
I'll get you out of civics class.

195
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:44,273
I'll be glad to.
That's the best offer I've had all day.

196
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,692
You tell her you got to get back
for practice…

197
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,944
… so she won't stay in there too long.

198
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,196
I've got enough bills to pay already.

199
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,536
"Know what the trouble is with you?

200
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,831
You ain't got no school spirit."

201
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,378
<i>Anarene High School, we love you</i>

202

Hey, come on, Jimmie Sue.
We're hungry over here too.

211
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:01,016
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Hold your horses!

212
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,316
Better watch it. Here comes your mama.

213
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,662
Jacy, we're having supper
at home tonight.

214
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,373
I expect you there in 15 minutes,
you hear?

215
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,751
Okay, Mama.
I was just giving the boys a ride.

216
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,088
Hey, Abilene.

217
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:55,070
<i>Now here's a tune that's been</i>
<i>on the pop hit list for some weeks.</i>

00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,530

00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,703
<i>What is it, huh?</i>

<i>- "Shrimp Boats" You got it!</i>

<i>You were in on that too.</i>

223
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,088
<i>All right. There's $120.</i>
<i>We're going along fine.</i>

225
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,272
Guess you hate me tonight, huh?

226
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:34,359
Oh, Mama, I love you, but I love
Duane too. Even if you don't like it.

227
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:37,779
I don't care. I'd just hate
to see you marry him, that's all.

228
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,615
You wouldn't be rich anymore.

229
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,075
- I don't care about money. Not at all.
- In two months, he'll stop flattering you.

230
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,327
You're pretty stupid then.

231
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:47,164
You married Daddy when he was poor,
and he got rich, didn't he?

232
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,958
Scared your daddy
into getting rich, beautiful.

233
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,793
If Daddy could do it,
Duane could too.

234
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,547
Not married to you.
You're not scary enough.

235
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,926
Well, you're rich and miserable.
I sure don't wanna be like you.

236
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,678
Not much danger of that.

237
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,556
- You slept with him?
- Mama!

238
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:07,768
Go to the doctor sometime
and arrange something…

239
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:11,146
… so you don't have to worry
about babies. You have to be careful.

240
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:15,150
But it's a sin unless you're married.
You know I wouldn't do that.

241
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,402
Don't be so mealy-mouthed!

242
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,196
I thought if you slept with him…

243
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:22,407
… you might find out that there isn't
anything magic about him.

244
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,618
Then we can send you away
to a good school—

245
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,828
- But I don't wanna leave.
- Marry some wealthy boy.

246
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,331
Why can't I stay here and go
to college in Wichita Falls?

247
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,749
Because.

248
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,919
Everything is flat and empty here.

249
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,837
And nothing to do!

250
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,422
Can I have some of that?

251
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,883
Help yourself. Don't you have any?

252
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,762
Well, yeah, but I feel like
smelling good right now.

253
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,599
Don't you ever feel like
doing anything right now?

254
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,523
You ought to leave your face
just like that.

255
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,150
All you really need now is
a little eyebrow pencil.

256
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,951
Okay. Good night.

257
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:14,251
Just remember, beautiful, everything
gets old if you do it often enough.

258
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:18,547
So if you wanna find out about
monotony real quick, marry Duane.

Hello, Sonny. What you want?

280
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,020
Coach said you need a driver.

281
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,067
Didn't he tell you I was coming?

282
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:05,946
No, he didn't mention it. I thought
he was gonna drive me himself.

283
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,532
I guess he just couldn't get off.

00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,077
Let me just get the radio.

285

Is it something bad?

No.

287
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:56,079
It's something very….

288
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,825
Thank you.

289
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,952
Here's the keys.

290
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:43,835
I guess I'd better
be getting back to school.

291
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,006
It was nice of you to drive me.

292
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:51,259
Well, it beats sitting
through civics, ma'am.

293
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,903
Wouldn't you like to come in
and have a soda?

294
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,031

Or you can go right now if you want.

299
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,276

a minute. I'm sorry I made you come in.

You'll never forgive me, I know.

302
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,965
Go on. You don't have
to stay any longer.

303
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,427
Thank you for the Dr Pepper.

304
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:01,222
I guess you'll be glad
when basketball season's over.

305
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,975
Why?

306
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,062
Well, coach probably don't get
to stay home much…

307
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,564
… during football and basketball season.

308
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:15,070
My God, you don't know
a thing about it, do you?

309
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,207
You better go on to basketball practice.

310
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,170
Thanks for the Dr Pepper.

311
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,876
- Hi, Jacy.
- Oh, hi.

312
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:14,003
Duane coming?

313
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,298
Say, you know Bobby Sheen, don't you?
Over at Wichita Falls?

314
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,883
I met him at the country club.

315
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,970
Well, he's gonna have
this midnight swimming party tonight.

316
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,514
- You wanna run over there with me?
- I can't.

317
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,558
I guess you heard about the last one.

318
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:30,186
His folks were gone to Miami,
and everybody swam naked.

319
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:33,231
His folks are gone again,
so it'll probably be pretty wild.

320
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:36,443
Sure wish you could come.
Bobby has great parties.

321
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,863
A lot of kids from the club
gonna be there.

322
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,411
Gee, Lester, I'd like to go.

323
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:50,248
I'm gonna have a big problem
with Duane though.

324
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,668
Well, don't go off without me.
Maybe I can.

325
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:03,761
- Hi, Duane.
- What did Lester want?

326
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:06,431
Oh, Lester. He's such a bore.

327
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:16,024
- Hey, Abilene!
- What do you say, buddy?

328
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,113
Hey there. Hi.

329
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:25,950
Merry Christmas.

330
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:30,038
This is Jackie Lee French.
This is Lois Farrow, my boss's wife.

331
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,332
What do you mean,
kissing her like that?

332
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,125
I ought to slap your face!

333
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:36,461
Well, why don't you just kiss my ass?

334
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,713
I never come here to referee no fight.

335
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,674
Well, good, then come dance with me.

336
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:45,053
Get yourself a drink, honey. I'll be back.

337
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,478
Hi, Ruth.

338
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:38,064
<i>Wait for me outside.</i>

339
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,578
—a thousand barrels of oil a day.

340
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:55,790
A thousand barrels.

341
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,922
It's too hot in here. Let's go outside.

342
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,133
I don't want drunks tromping on my feet.

343
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,635
I got something to give you anyway.

344
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:09,012
- Hey, Sonny.
- Hey, Sonny.

345
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,471
Hi.

346
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:17,645
Hi, Sonny.

347
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:18,938
Hi, Dad.

348
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,982
How you doing?

349
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,651
Okay.

350
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,903
Well, that's good.

351
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,285
See you.

352
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,037
Sure.

353
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,294
- You mean, my Christmas present.
- Yep.

354
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,796
I haven't had time
to get you anything yet.

355
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,423
I haven't had a minute to shop.

356
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,092
Hope you like it.
I saved up for six months to get it.

357
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:51,638
Oh, it's just beautiful.

358
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,098
It's just what I've been wanting.

359
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:57,352
You're so sweet,
spending all that money on me.

360
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:02,523
Oh, you're so sexy, Duane.

361
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,109
I just wish I didn't have
to leave you tonight.

362
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:06,611
Well, you don't.

363
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,614
Oh, I do too. I could just kill my mother!

364
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:10,823
What do you mean?

365
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:15,078
She made me promise to go to a swim
party in Wichita with Lester Marlow.

366
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,330
Because his folks are rich.
Don't be mad.

367
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,123
I ain't mad at you, but goddamn it!

368
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,959
It's all Lester's fault.
He keeps asking Mama.

369
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:23,961
All I wanna do is stay with
the man I love.

370
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,630
Goddamn.

371
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,435
No, no, Duane! I gotta go. I gotta go.

372
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,126
What do you mean,
asking my girl for a date?

373
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,920
- You turn me loose!
- I will when you're ready to fight.

374
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,130
Let's have it out!

375
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,590
Come on, Marlow.

376
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:55,553
Here, knock off that shit, boys.
This is the Christmas season.

377
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,013
Run along here, Wichita.

378
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,100
I can't stand here all night
protecting your shoeshine.

379
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:12,153
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
about him. He's so crazy about me.

380
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,698
Nothing against Duane,
but that's a roughneck for you.

381
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,326
They aren't sophisticated
about these things.

382
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:22,413
Well, Merry Christmas!

383
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:25,792
Come on in, let's have some punch, boy.

384
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:38,471
- Hi, Sonny.
- Oh, hi.

385
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:41,641
- Wanna help me?
- Okay.

386
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,154
You're not dancing.
Don't you have a girlfriend?

387
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,990
I did have.
We broke up a couple months ago.

388
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:01,869
Oh, why? Mind my asking?

389
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:04,956
I was going with Charlene Duggs.

390
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:08,543
She thought I got fresh with her.
I never did, really.

391
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:12,505
I guess we broke up because we didn't
like each other much to begin with.

392
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,007
I hope you're not sad about it.

393
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:17,844
I don't think
Charlene's near nice enough for you.

394
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,096
I didn't see you dancing.

395
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:23,099
No, I don't dance much.

396
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:14,233
Will you drive me
to the clinic again next week?

397
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,360
Well, you bet.

398
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,579
We better not dawdle here.

399
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,218
Bobby.

400
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:44,513
Hey, look! New victims!

401
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,769
- Hi, Jacy.
- Hi.

402
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:52,605
Glad you could make it.
We're dressed informally.

403
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:53,981
Hi, Jacy.

404
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:56,400
You know Annie-Annie.

405
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,694
Wanna join the club?

406
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,237
Sure.

407
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:03,616
Well, you gotta get undressed
out there on the diving board.

408
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:06,369
So everybody gets to watch.

409
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:07,912
We all do it the first time.

410
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,165
- That's the rule.
- Yeah. I did it last Easter.

411
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:14,418
- Okay?
- Okay.

412
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,629
Everybody out for the strip show!

413
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,075
Don't pay any attention to Sandy.
He's my little brother.

414
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:49,453
If he gooses you or anything,
I'll make him go to bed.

415
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,334
Goodness!
I hope I don't fall off this thing.

416
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,378
Sandy can fish you out if you do.

417
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,963
Duane, been looking for you.
Hey, where's Jacy?

418
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,299
Oh, don't remind him.
We just got him quiet. Want a drink?

419
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,760
- Where'd you get it?
- Found it in a guy's car.

420
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:12,012
- When he weren't looking.
- Let's do something.

421
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,348
Good idea. Why don't
we hunt up some pussy?

422
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:18,060
Oh, you wouldn't know what to do with it
if we found some.

423
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:19,270
What happened?

424
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,565
Lester took his girl
to a swimming party.

425
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,567
Let's all go out and get a fuck.

426
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:28,445
I know where's a heifer.
It belongs to my Uncle Hank.

427
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,406
Why the hell not?

428
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:33,033
- I say a heifer beats nothing.
- Pussy's pussy!

429
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,369
I don't want no heifer.

430
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,997
We ought to buy Billy a piece of ass.

431
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:41,375
- Yeah, we oughtn't let him die a virgin.
- Yeah.

432
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,752
Mama says idiot kids don't live long.

433
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,921
He ain't no idiot kid. He just don't talk.

434
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,673
Bet he's still a virgin, though.

435
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,010
Hey, we ought to fix him up
with Jimmie Sue.

436
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:52,928
It'd make no difference to Billy.

437
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:55,306
Look, we shouldn't try
anything like that.

438
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:58,017
Why not? It wouldn't cost us
more than $1.50.

439
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:00,269
If that's all,
we ought to get her ourselves.

440
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:03,189
Shit! A heifer's better than Jimmie Sue.

441
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:06,692
Get the stupid little thing in here.
I ain't got all night.

442
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:09,570
Let's get those pants off, boys.

443
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,907
You won't be a virgin much longer.

444
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:15,618
Come on, Billy, we're gonna
get you laid.

445
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,248
Grab on now. Come on, do your job.

446
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:23,417
Get her, Billy-boy!

447
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,424
This is the dumbest thing I ever seen!

448
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,594
- He don't even know what to do!
- Come on, Billy. It worked for me.

449
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:35,346
Damn it, put it to her, boy!

450
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:38,265
- Get her, Billy.
- Come on, Billy. Screw it to her, boy.

451
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:40,142
You stop that yelling out there.

452
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,936
It ain't even in!

453
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,604
Goddamn!

454
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:46,148
Goddamn, you stupid little thing!

455
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:48,901
Couldn't even wait. Look at this mess!

456
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,331
You okay, Billy?

457
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:04,250
You all right?

458
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:18,806
Well, now I know.
Idiots as bad as Mexicans.

459
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:21,850
Don't bother me no more
for that crazy thing.

460
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:25,771
Wouldn't mess with him again
for less than three and a half.

461
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,970
Which one of you bloodied his nose?

462
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:02,433
I've told you all not to fight with Billy.
He don't understand about fighting.

463
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,101
What happened, Sonny?

464
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:07,521
- It weren't none of us, Sam.
- No, it was Jimmie Sue.

465
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:11,567
Jimmie Sue?
How'd he get messed up with her?

466
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:16,155
We bought him a piece of ass.
Thought he was tired of being a virgin.

467
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:20,034
She got mad about something
and bloodied his nose.

468
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:23,787
You boys get on out of here.

469
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:26,623
I don't wanna have no more
to do with you.

470
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,793
Scaring a poor,
unfortunate creature like Billy…

471
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,504
… just so you could have a few laughs.

472
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:36,592
I've been around
that trashy behaviour all my life.

473
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:39,303
I'm getting tired of putting up with it.

474
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:42,431
You can stay out
of this pool hall, my café…

475
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:44,850
… and my picture show too.

476
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,604
I don't want no more of your business.

477
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:53,317
We didn't mean for anything bad
to happen, Sam. We—

478
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:57,237
You didn't even have the decency
to wash his face.

479
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:23,347
We're his best customers.
He can't run us off.

480
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,643
Can he?

481
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:40,656
Lucky I fell asleep.
I'd hate not being able to shoot no pool.

482
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,216
You sure he won't come?

483
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:03,554
You know he won't.
He's just starting basketball practice.

484
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:55,874
It's all right.

485
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,251
I'm sorry I cried.

486
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:25,088
Just scared, I guess.

487
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,634
He ain't gonna come.

488
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,261
They're probably running plays
right now, I bet.

489
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:33,889
No, not scared of that.

490
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,894
Scared I could never do this, I guess.

491
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,940
Can't seem to do anything
without crying about it.

492
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,028
How could you like me?

493
00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:50,238
I like you.

494
00:49:52,908 --> 00:49:54,660
I'm glad.

495
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:53,737
Come on in.
I ain't gonna throw bottles at you.

496
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:57,240
Hi.

497
00:51:57,741 --> 00:52:00,410
What have you been doing?
You lost weight.

498
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:03,455
Ain't had any
of your cheeseburgers in weeks.

499
00:52:03,622 --> 00:52:06,166
Come on. I'll fix you one.

500
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,836
Even though that wasn't
a very nice thing y'all done to Billy.

501
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:12,339
Can't blame Sam.

502
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:14,257
- Was that your idea?
- No.

503
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:17,886
Duane's? He was there, wasn't he?

504
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:21,223
Just didn't have the decency
to own up to it.

505
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:27,604
Don't worry, I won't tell on him.
I should, though.

506
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:30,482
Sure smells good.

507
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:32,526
One thing I know for sure.

508
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,402
A person can't sneeze in this town…

509
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:36,196
… without somebody offering
a handkerchief.

510
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:38,657
- What you mean?
- Nothing.

511
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,952
It's an awful small town
for any kind of carrying on.

512
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,497
Don't forget to put some onions on.

513
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:48,792
And some people got a lot of guns.

514
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:55,715
All right, you don't need
my advice anyway.

515
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:59,636
Why don't you go play a record?
These will be done in a minute.

516
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,126
Just come in to say hello to Genevieve.

517
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:38,091
Sonny…

518
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:41,386
… food's getting cold.

519
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:52,981
What are you grinning about?

520
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:56,026
Chicken-fry me a steak,
and try to use meat this time.

521
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:07,662
I heard about the ball game last night.

522
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:10,874
121 to 14.

523
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:13,084
Must be pretty near a record.

524
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:17,380
Sam.

525
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:19,382
I'm sorry.

526
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:24,262
I reckon y'all need glasses.

527
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,192
Now hold still.

528
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:40,362
Want some more cookies?

529
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:43,490
- More milk?
- I'm full.

530
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,627
How come you've stayed
with the coach?

531
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:57,587
You don't like him much.

532
00:54:57,754 --> 00:55:00,215
I wasn't brought up to leave a husband.

533
00:55:00,382 --> 00:55:02,425
I guess that's why.

534
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:04,928
Maybe I was just scared to.

535
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:08,848
I never noticed how ugly this room is.

536
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:10,600
What's your favourite colour?

537
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:12,227
I don't know. Blue.

538
00:55:12,394 --> 00:55:15,230
- Maybe I'll re-paper it.
- Why'd you marry him?

539
00:55:15,397 --> 00:55:16,564
I don't know.

540
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:20,068
My mother didn't like him.
Maybe that was it.

541
00:55:20,402 --> 00:55:22,278
But I was 20 years old.

542
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:26,616
I thought hairy-chested
football coaches were about it.

543
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:29,661
I'm gonna buy us a new quilt.

544
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:31,413
A blue one.

545
00:55:32,622 --> 00:55:35,083
What you think he'd do if he found us?

546
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,502
Shoot us, probably.

547
00:55:37,669 --> 00:55:41,172
He's always glad to have an excuse
to use his deer rifle.

548
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,734
I thought you boys wanted to fish.

549
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,528
Come on.
Keep an eye on them corks, Billy.

550
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:12,287
I don't think there's anything
in this tank except turtles.

551
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:15,165
That's what I like about it,
tell you the truth.

552
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:18,001
- Wanna try one?
- Sure.

553
00:56:20,962 --> 00:56:23,548
I never liked to clean fish
or eat them either.

554
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:26,801
You spend half your time
picking out bone.

555
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,848
I just come out here
to get a little scenery.

556
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:34,768
Too pretty a day to spend in town.

557
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:41,900
You wouldn't believe
how this country's changed.

558
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:48,573
First time I seen it,
there wasn't a mesquite tree on it.

559
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,992
Or a prickly pear neither.

560
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:53,661
I used to own this land, you know.

561
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:57,540
First time I watered a horse
at this tank…

562
00:56:57,707 --> 00:57:00,126
… was more than 40 years ago.

563
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,339
I reckon the reason
I always drag you out here is…

564
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:08,927
… I'm just as sentimental as the next
feller when it comes to old times.

565
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:15,767
Old times.

566
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:18,978
I brought a young lady
swimming out here once…

567
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:21,481
… more than 20 years ago.

568
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,986
It was after my wife had lost her mind.

569
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:29,531
And my boys was dead.

570
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:36,663
Me and this young lady was pretty wild,
I guess.

571
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,290
In pretty deep.

572
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,214
We used to come here on horseback
and swim without no bathing suits.

573
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:53,263
One day, she wanted to swim
the horses across this tank.

574
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:56,766
Kind of a crazy thing to do,
but we done it anyway.

575
00:57:57,767 --> 00:58:01,271
She bet me a silver dollar
she could beat me across.

576
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:03,565
She did.

577
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:08,361
This old horse I was riding
didn't wanna take the water.

578
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:12,490
But she was always looking
for something to do like that.

579
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:15,618
Something wild.

580
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:20,540
I'll bet she's still got that silver dollar.

581
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:25,211
Whatever happened to her?

582
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,298
Oh, she growed up.

583
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:31,634
She was just a girl then, really.

584
00:58:33,803 --> 00:58:35,847
Here, let me help you with that.

585
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:40,143
Why didn't you ever marry her
after your wife died?

586
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:44,480
She was already married.

587
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:52,572
Her and her husband was young
and miserable with one another…

588
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:55,533
… like so many young married folks are.

589
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,995
I thought they'd change with some age…

590
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:01,080
… but it didn't turn out that way.

591
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,083
- Is being married always so miserable?
- No. Not really.

592
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:07,295
About 80 percent of the time, I guess.

593
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:12,967
We ought to go
to a real fishing tank next year.

594
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:16,888
It don't do to think
about things like that too much.

595
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:21,309
If she was here,
I'd probably be just as crazy now…

596
00:59:21,476 --> 00:59:24,646
… as I was then in about five minutes.

597
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:27,065
Ain't that ridiculous?

598
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:31,236
No, it ain't really.

599
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:35,949
Being crazy about a woman like her
is always the right thing to do.

600
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:41,454
Being a decrepit, old bag of bones,
that's what's ridiculous.

601
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,581
Getting old.

602
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:37,343
My God, I'm glad I wasn't on fire.

603
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:40,638
I would've burned to death
before you got one button undone.

604
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:43,433
I'm going to get a drink of water.

605
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,815
Hi.

606
01:00:50,982 --> 01:00:54,527
I wondered where you went.
Annie-Annie asleep?

607
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:56,362
Yeah.

608
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:14,005
Nice. You a virgin?

609
01:01:15,048 --> 01:01:16,466
Guess I am.

610
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:18,718
Too bad.

611
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:23,056
- I don't wanna be, though.
- I don't blame you.

612
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:25,516
Come see me when you're not.

613
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:54,087
Why don't we just go someplace?
I'm sick and tired of this town.

614
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:57,048
- You're the only friend I got.
- You mean, go and stay gone?

615
01:01:57,215 --> 01:01:59,133
No, I don't know.

616
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:02,970
Hey, we go to Mexico.
Be back sometime Monday.

617
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:06,265
- You reckon the pickup would make it?
- Yeah. How much money you got?

618
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,850
Oh, 30 bucks about.

619
01:02:08,017 --> 01:02:10,186
Well, I got 40.
We can make it. Come on!

620
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:11,854
Okay.

621
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:14,565
You boys want—? Hey.

622
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:16,818
- Where are you going?
- Mexico.

623
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:18,444
Where?

624
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:28,121
Better come with us, Sam.
We're headed for the valley.

625
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,164
- Going where did you say?
- Mexico.

626
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:32,625
- It's about the wildest.
- All the way down.

627
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:37,338
You going all the way to Mexico tonight
in this old heap of junk?

628
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:38,840
My God.

629
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:42,176
Reckon the town will get along
without us till Monday?

630
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:43,386
I reckon.

631
01:02:43,553 --> 01:02:46,514
If I was young enough to bounce,
I'd probably go with you.

632
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:49,475
- Need any money?
- No, we got plenty.

633
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:53,813
Well, you'd better take some
for some insurance.

634
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:57,233
Take money below that border,
it sort of melts sometimes.

635
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,985
Thanks, Sam.

636
01:02:59,527 --> 01:03:02,196
Try not to drink too much
of that buggy water.

637
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:05,908
We'll just drink beer and tequila.

638
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:09,954
You catch the clap,
you'll wish you hadn't drunk nothing.

639
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:24,093
Oh, well.

640
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,470
We'll see you.

641
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,597
So long!

642
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:00,505
Duane. Hey, wake up!

643
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:02,256
We're back.

644
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:06,761
My stomach don't feel so good.
Got any more of those Tums?

645
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:10,723
You ate them all
before we got to San Antone.

646
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:15,770
Genevieve will have something.
My stomach don't feel so good.

647
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:19,357
"Closed."

648
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,484
Closed?

649
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,194
Yeah.

650
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:25,613
I ain't never seen her closed before.

651
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,366
No, not even for Christmas.

652
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:33,079
Maybe Sam will have something.
I'm sick.

653
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,728
Well, it ain't that early.

654
01:04:57,895 --> 01:04:59,564
Must be some kind of holiday.

655
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:02,275
Sam don't close on holidays.

656
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:05,027
Maybe he had to go someplace.

657
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:10,032
Well, let's go ask Andy.

658
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:11,826
Okay.

659
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:26,841
- Hey, Andy. Hey, where is everybody?
- Somebody will steal the town.

660
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:28,801
Asleep.
Everybody that's got any sense.

661
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,470
Why'd Sam close the café?

662
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:34,515
Oh, yeah. Y'all been gone, ain't you?

663
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:36,475
Gone to Mexico.

664
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:38,686
- You don't know about it.
- About what?

665
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:40,646
Sam died yesterday morning.

666
01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:43,566
Died?

667
01:05:43,733 --> 01:05:45,568
Yep. Quite a blow.

668
01:05:45,735 --> 01:05:49,572
Keeled over one of the snooker tables.
Had a stroke.

669
01:05:50,114 --> 01:05:53,200
- Sam the Lion?
- Yep.

670
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:54,535
Sam's dead.

671
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:56,829
He was quite a feller.

672
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:01,876
He had his own way of doing things,
that's for sure.

673
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:06,839
They found his will.
Craziest thing you ever heard.

674
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:11,135
He left you the pool hall, Sonny.
What do you think about that?

675
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:14,722
He left Genevieve the café.

676
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:18,267
That's the only thing he done
that made any sense.

677
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:21,145
Left the picture show to old Miss Mosey.

678
01:06:21,312 --> 01:06:25,316
Hell, she's too far gone
to even run a popcorn machine.

679
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:27,360
And the craziest thing of all…

680
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:31,614
… he left $1000 to Joe Bob Blanton,
the preacher's boy.

681
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:34,575
Beats all I ever heard of.

682
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:37,370
He could just as easily left that to me.

683
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:41,499
I deserve it at least as much
as that ignorant little bastard.

684
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,877
Anyhow, it's done.

685
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:47,380
They're burying him tomorrow.

686
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:10,481
Come in.

687
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:28,415
- I love you.
- I love you too.

688
01:09:58,863 --> 01:10:00,406
Oh, Duane, hurry.

689
01:10:35,566 --> 01:10:37,026
What's wrong, honey?

690
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:40,821
I don't know.

691
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:44,575
That tickles.
You know I can't stand to be tickled.

692
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:55,961
What's the matter?
Aren't you gonna do it?

693
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:58,422
I don't know what's wrong.

694
01:10:58,589 --> 01:11:02,259
How could anything be wrong?
Just go on and do it.

695
01:11:06,055 --> 01:11:07,848
Oh, what's the matter with you?

696
01:11:08,724 --> 01:11:10,643
I don't know. Something's happened.

697
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:13,812
Well, get off a minute!
You might fall and mash me.

698
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:15,439
I don't know what happened.

699
01:11:15,606 --> 01:11:18,359
It was Mexico.
No telling what you got down there.

700
01:11:18,525 --> 01:11:21,236
I just hate you! I don't know
why I ever went with you.

701
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:22,655
I don't know what happened.

702
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:28,827
Put your clothes on. You think I wanna
sit around here and look at you naked?

703
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:33,540
I knew you couldn't do it.
Now I'll never not be a virgin!

704
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:36,001
What do we tell everybody?
The whole class knows.

705
01:11:36,168 --> 01:11:38,587
I just wanna cry.
You're the meanest boy I ever saw.

706
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:40,965
My mother was dead-right about you.

707
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:43,801
I don't know what happened.

708
01:11:43,968 --> 01:11:46,845
Don't go out there! We haven't had time
to do it. They'd know.

709
01:11:47,012 --> 01:11:50,265
I don't want one soul to know.
You better not tell one soul.

710
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:52,810
You just pretend it was wonderful!

711
01:11:52,977 --> 01:11:55,437
Well, I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

712
01:11:56,397 --> 01:11:58,482
If you say that one more time,
I'll bite you!

713
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:21,088
Tell us about it, Jacy. What was it like?

714
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:26,760
I just can't describe it.

715
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:29,555
I just can't describe it in words.

716
01:13:10,012 --> 01:13:13,348
Jacy. Jacy.

717
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:16,977
I can do it now. I know I can.

718
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:19,646
Jacy.

719
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:54,932
Oh, quit prissing!
I don't think you did it right anyway.

720
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:06,693
Come on.

721
01:14:16,537 --> 01:14:20,249
It's your graduation present.
Hope you like it.

722
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:32,427
I never seen one as nice.

723
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,650
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Jacy?

724
01:14:46,817 --> 01:14:48,527
What's on your feeble mind, Duane?

725
01:14:48,694 --> 01:14:50,445
Same as it's been. I want a date.

726
01:14:51,572 --> 01:14:53,657
Why don't you just go back to Mexico?

727
01:14:53,824 --> 01:14:56,326
I guess girls are just easier
to please down there.

728
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,620
Just go with me one more time.

729
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:00,372
<i>You can at least see me.</i>

730
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:03,000
Find somebody else to pester.
Got a new boyfriend.

731
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:05,252
<i>- And I can't be talking to you.</i>
- Who?

732
01:15:05,419 --> 01:15:07,004
- Bobby Sheen, of course.
<i>- Bobby Sheen?</i>

733
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:10,632
- You crazy?
<i>- I certainly am not.</i>

734
01:15:10,799 --> 01:15:14,553
I guess I wanted to go with him all along
and never realised it.

735
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,598
Maybe we'll see you
in Wichita sometime.

736
01:15:31,904 --> 01:15:35,532
Goddamn it! Goddamn it to hell!

737
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:48,503
I hate to see you go, Duane.

738
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,881
Not a goddamn thing to stay for.

739
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:54,218
Roughnecks say you can get a job
out in Odessa anytime.

740
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,970
Come on back if you don't.

741
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,194
Hey, listen, you hear they busted up,
let me know.

742
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:43,267
<i>Why don't we watch the movie?</i>

743
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:48,689
Hi. Didn't hear you.

744
01:16:49,815 --> 01:16:50,857
Gene home?

745
01:16:51,483 --> 01:16:53,777
No, he and Mama went to the club.

746
01:16:58,907 --> 01:17:01,785
What are you doing home
on a Saturday night?

747
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,455
Bobby Sheen ran off and got married.

748
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:09,835
Annie-Annie Martin.

749
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:15,090
Want me to turn the TV off?

750
01:17:15,924 --> 01:17:19,720
No, I'm gonna go play some pool.
Tell your dad that well came in okay.

751
01:17:21,013 --> 01:17:23,974
I wish I could go to the pool hall.
I've always wanted to.

752
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:27,436
It's terrible,
the things girls aren't allowed to do.

753
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:32,316
Well, hell, come on.
I'll show you the pool hall.

754
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:33,817
Aren't there people there?

755
01:17:33,984 --> 01:17:36,653
If there are,
they'll be in back asleep now.

756
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:40,032
Won't bother us. Got my own key.

757
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:43,452
Okay, I will then.

758
01:17:59,134 --> 01:18:02,054
Goodness, it sure is dark in here.

759
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:06,321
What a night! I never thought
something like this would happen.

760
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:10,200
How about hopping out?

761
01:21:23,547 --> 01:21:26,758
<i>And in Chicago today,</i>
<i>Governor Adlai E. Stevenson accepted…</i>

762
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:28,927
<i>… the Democratic</i>
<i>presidential nomination…</i>

763
01:21:29,094 --> 01:21:32,389
<i>… and picked Senator John Sparkman</i>
<i>of Alabama to be his running mate.</i>

764
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,226
<i>In Dallas county,</i>
<i>General Dwight D. Eisenhower scored…</i>

765
01:21:36,393 --> 01:21:39,271
<i>… a second landslide victory</i>
<i>over old-guard Republican forces.</i>

766
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:47,737
Oh, he's just awful, Mama!
Why do you fool with him?

767
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:50,782
- Daddy's nicer than him, isn't he?
- He sure is, beautiful.

768
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:52,909
Your daddy's a very nice man.

769
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:55,870
I ought to been giving Abilene hell
instead of him.

770
01:21:56,037 --> 01:21:59,416
Bobby was the last one.
I'm just gonna be an old maid.

771
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:03,461
That's just the way it goes sometimes.
You win a few, you lose a few.

772
01:22:03,628 --> 01:22:04,921
What do you do?

773
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:07,215
Nothing's ever the way
it's supposed to be.

774
01:22:07,382 --> 01:22:09,551
You're right. Come on.

775
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:17,017
I want to tell you, what I've done
has not worked out too well.

776
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:21,146
I think maybe we better think
of something else for you.

777
01:22:22,814 --> 01:22:26,192
Right now, I guess Ruth Popper's got
about as good a setup as anyone.

778
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:30,322
Why, sure. Sonny's reasonably
good-looking and he's young.

779
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:33,700
Don't you know about that? It's been
going on about six months now.

780
01:22:33,867 --> 01:22:36,494
- I thought you kids knew everything.
- That's silly!

781
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:38,079
She's 40 years old.

782
01:22:38,246 --> 01:22:41,082
So am I, honey. It's kind of an itchy age.

783
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:42,876
Want an orange?

784
01:22:43,043 --> 01:22:45,086
I don't believe it.

785
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:48,715
Sonny's always wanted to go with me.

786
01:22:53,595 --> 01:22:55,930
Pretty easy shot, sheriff.

787
01:23:04,481 --> 01:23:05,857
Sheriff, we got some trouble.

788
01:23:07,776 --> 01:23:10,987
Goddamn you, Monroe!
You made me scratch.

789
01:23:11,154 --> 01:23:15,241
Sorry, sheriff, but Johnny Clarg's
little girl's kind of been kidnapped.

790
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:18,662
They say the preacher's boy put her
in his car two hours ago.

791
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:22,957
Well, what the hell? Maybe Joe Bob
just give her a ride home.

792
01:23:23,124 --> 01:23:25,752
Be doing her a favour
in this hot weather.

793
01:23:25,919 --> 01:23:28,546
Who'd want to kidnap Molly Clarg?

794
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:30,507
I just know she's not home.

795
01:23:30,674 --> 01:23:32,759
They was seen headed
out of town toward Olney.

796
01:23:32,926 --> 01:23:36,096
Well, Mrs Clarg's kind of afraid
that Joe Bob might be…

797
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:39,557
- … gonna molest her or something.
- Sonny.

798
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,685
You and some of these boys come
with us.

799
01:23:42,352 --> 01:23:46,022
If that's the way it is,
no telling what we'll find.

800
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:15,427
Molly! Molly!

801
01:24:18,638 --> 01:24:20,724
Get him! Ain't you going to?

802
01:24:21,266 --> 01:24:22,559
Here's my little girl.

803
01:24:22,726 --> 01:24:25,645
He's the one that done it.
Why don't you get him?

804
01:24:25,812 --> 01:24:28,982
If my husband was here,
he'd kill him dead.

805
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,407
What did you do to that child?
We know you done something.

806
01:24:37,574 --> 01:24:38,950
Come on.

807
01:24:41,703 --> 01:24:42,954
Filthy!

808
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:46,624
Here now, grab her.
None of this goddamn frenzy.

809
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:49,669
Filthy! Filthy! Filthy!

810
01:24:51,379 --> 01:24:53,214
It's the Lord's justice, son.

811
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:55,759
You'll suffer with the murderer
and the thief.

812
01:24:55,925 --> 01:25:00,346
Sonny, drive that Plymouth to town.
We gotta get this man to jail.

813
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:12,776
- Doctor said he didn't do nothing.
- Never had the guts.

814
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:15,403
- Preacher's boy.
- Sheriff figured he done something.

815
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:16,988
Yeah.

816
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:26,080
Isn't it terrible, Sonny? Were you there?
Did you see anything?

817
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:28,458
Oh, weren't nothing to see
except Mrs Clarg.

818
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:31,252
If she had a gun,
she might've killed us all.

819
01:25:31,419 --> 01:25:33,004
Joe Bob didn't do nothing.

820
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:36,508
He must've done something.
It scares me to death.

821
01:25:36,674 --> 01:25:40,094
You just never can tell when something
terrible's gonna happen.

822
01:25:41,429 --> 01:25:43,473
It's okay. They got him now.

823
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,391
I called you before.

824
01:25:46,267 --> 01:25:47,310
You did?

825
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:49,604
I felt lonesome.

826
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:51,898
Thought you might wanna
drive around awhile.

827
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:57,779
Well, I'm supposed to be someplace.

828
01:25:57,946 --> 01:26:01,783
I'm still a little scared.
Please take me riding.

829
01:26:06,371 --> 01:26:08,915
Well, where will we drive?

830
01:26:35,984 --> 01:26:37,277
You ever hear from Duane?

831
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:38,695
Got a postcard.

832
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:41,656
I really feel sad about that.

833
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:45,410
He's— He's making 320 a month.
Said he bought a car.

834
01:26:46,411 --> 01:26:48,413
I guess I'll always be a little bit
in love with Duane.

835
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:51,291
We had too much against us.

836
01:26:51,624 --> 01:26:54,586
It wasn't easy
being the one to break up.

837
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:26,159
- Sonny.
- What?

838
01:28:21,589 --> 01:28:23,549
Not here.

839
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:26,886
I'm too old for screwing in cars.

840
01:28:29,847 --> 01:28:32,141
I don't like to hurry.

841
01:28:32,684 --> 01:28:36,604
Why don't we go to Wichita
and get a motel room?

842
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:39,649
I'm afraid to.
I think my folks are watching me.

843
01:28:39,816 --> 01:28:41,567
They know
I don't wanna go to college.

844
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:44,529
They might think we're gonna run off
and get married.

845
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:49,075
We'll do it when it's safe.

846
01:28:49,534 --> 01:28:52,328
We got all summer.

847
01:29:44,672 --> 01:29:47,258
- Hey, Duane.
- Hey, buddy!

848
01:29:48,426 --> 01:29:49,594
You turned roughneck.

849
01:29:49,761 --> 01:29:52,305
Gotta make a living
so I can keep the pool hall open.

850
01:29:52,472 --> 01:29:53,514
When'd you get in?

851
01:29:53,681 --> 01:29:56,768
About 2. I thought I'd surprise you.

852
01:29:58,144 --> 01:29:59,270
Is this yours?

853
01:29:59,437 --> 01:30:03,107
Yeah, how about that? Thirty-eight
thousand miles, and she runs like new.

854
01:30:03,274 --> 01:30:05,109
- Say, you want a beer?
- Not me.

855
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:07,987
That's about all I eat
for breakfast anymore.

856
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:10,364
Hey, sure is a nice car.

857
01:30:10,531 --> 01:30:14,702
Yeah, I like to drive it so much, I thought
I'd just drop home for the weekend.

858
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:19,791
Yeah, you can't take too good care
of a car like this.

859
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:21,584
I wash her every week.

860
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:24,337
Oh, it looks great.

861
01:30:24,712 --> 01:30:25,922
Hear about Joe Bob?

862
01:30:26,089 --> 01:30:28,341
Yeah, I always knew he was crazy.

863
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:32,720
He didn't do nothing, except get her
to take her underpants off.

864
01:30:32,887 --> 01:30:35,473
- He's out of jail now.
- Yeah.

865
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,975
Are you still screwing that old lady?

866
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:41,646
No. Yeah. I've been kind of busy.

867
01:30:42,313 --> 01:30:44,649
I seen old Leroy last week.

868
01:30:44,816 --> 01:30:47,485
He said he thought you and Jacy
had been going together.

869
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:49,445
Yeah, we have, a little.

870
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:53,199
She's been kind of bored, so once
in a while, we go eat Mexican food.

871
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:55,743
Well, I hear that ain't all
you been eating.

872
01:30:56,786 --> 01:31:00,206
Well, whoever told you that don't know
what he's talking about.

873
01:31:00,373 --> 01:31:02,250
Sure, I've been going with her. Why not?

874
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:05,461
I never said I blamed you for it.
I don't blame you much.

875
01:31:05,628 --> 01:31:08,548
I never thought you'd do that.
I thought we were best friends.

876
01:31:08,714 --> 01:31:12,135
We are. What you so mad for?
I never done nothing.

877
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:14,887
- Screwing my girl ain't nothing?
- I ain't screwing her.

878
01:31:15,054 --> 01:31:17,473
- Hell, you ain't!
- Well, I ain't.

879
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,350
- She's not your girl.
- She is my girl!

880
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:21,310
You don't even live here anymore.

881
01:31:21,477 --> 01:31:24,230
That don't make no difference!
I'm getting her back.

882
01:31:24,397 --> 01:31:26,190
She's gonna marry me
one of these days.

883
01:31:26,357 --> 01:31:28,651
- She won't.
- We're meant to get married.

884
01:31:28,818 --> 01:31:30,027
She's off to college soon.

885
01:31:30,194 --> 01:31:33,823
I doubt I'll ever get to go
with her again myself, once she gets off.

886
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:36,993
I never saw what it could hurt
to go with her this summer though.

887
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:40,621
- She's never gonna marry you.
- She is! Don't tell me she won't!

888
01:31:40,788 --> 01:31:42,957
She'd never let you screw her.
That's for sure.

889
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:45,543
Hell, I was just seeing
how honest you was.

890
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:49,005
Jacy would never let you screw her.
You ain't that good a cocksman.

891
01:31:49,797 --> 01:31:52,300
You never even screwed
Charlene Duggs all that time.

892
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:53,509
Course I didn't!

893
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:54,927
You know why?

894
01:31:55,094 --> 01:31:58,306
Because you had the pickup
all the time Saturday night, that's why.

895
01:31:58,472 --> 01:32:00,224
Nobody could've screwed
in the time I had.

896
01:32:00,391 --> 01:32:03,311
I could've screwed her in five minutes.
I wouldn't need no pickup.

897
01:32:03,477 --> 01:32:08,691
She only went with you because you was
in the backfield and I was in the line.

898
01:32:08,858 --> 01:32:10,902
What you talking about? We was in love.

899
01:32:11,068 --> 01:32:14,238
Oh, you was. She likes me
just as much as she ever liked you.

900
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:17,366
- That's a lie.
- I'll stay with her all night too.

901
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:19,035
- She promised.
- You won't either.

902
01:32:19,202 --> 01:32:20,369
I will. Why shouldn't I?

903
01:32:20,536 --> 01:32:24,081
She done told me you couldn't even do it
that time in Wichita Falls.

904
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:49,023
What happened?

905
01:32:51,776 --> 01:32:52,902
Sonny?

906
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:56,572
<i>This is your turntable matinee</i>
<i>here on KTRN…</i>

907
01:32:56,739 --> 01:33:01,494
<i>… where you can hear Fulton Lewis, Jr</i>
<i>every Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.</i>

908
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:04,038
<i>Now here's Hank Williams.</i>

909
01:33:04,789 --> 01:33:08,334
There's a lady in the waiting room.
She sent you this.

910
01:33:20,888 --> 01:33:22,598
Could you tell her I'm asleep?

911
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,517
Please?

912
01:33:24,684 --> 01:33:26,352
All right.

913
01:33:52,378 --> 01:33:53,629
That too cold?

914
01:33:53,796 --> 01:33:55,673
No, it's great.

915
01:33:57,174 --> 01:33:59,927
Say, I hear Duane joined the Army.

916
01:34:00,094 --> 01:34:02,138
Good place for him too.

917
01:34:02,305 --> 01:34:04,765
He didn't mean to hit me
with the bottle.

918
01:34:04,932 --> 01:34:08,019
That boy's always had meanness in him.

919
01:34:08,394 --> 01:34:11,480
Jacy's just the kind of girl
that brings out the meanness in a man.

920
01:34:11,647 --> 01:34:14,233
She's just like her grandmother.

921
01:34:16,485 --> 01:34:20,364
I hadn't ought to talk about them.
We was all good friends once.

922
01:34:21,324 --> 01:34:24,035
Dan roughnecked with Gene Farrow.

923
01:34:24,493 --> 01:34:27,038
He and Lois used to live
in this one-room place…

924
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:29,498
… over the newspaper office.

925
01:34:29,665 --> 01:34:33,711
Lois couldn't afford a flour sack,
much less a mink.

926
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:39,175
I've always had
a soft spot for her, though.

927
01:34:41,052 --> 01:34:44,055
Yeah, I wondered a lot of times
what would've happened…

928
01:34:44,221 --> 01:34:46,849
… if my Dan had made the strikes
that Gene made.

929
01:34:47,016 --> 01:34:49,852
They offered that rig to him first.

930
01:34:50,728 --> 01:34:52,146
Yup.

931
01:34:53,564 --> 01:34:57,276
Dan Morgan never took a chance
in his life.

932
01:34:57,735 --> 01:34:59,320
Do you wish y'all had made it?

933
01:35:03,324 --> 01:35:06,077
Sure, I wish we'd made it.

934
01:35:08,245 --> 01:35:11,791
I guess the Army won't take me now,
I just got one good eye.

935
01:35:11,957 --> 01:35:14,335
You wanna go over to Korea
and get yourself killed?

936
01:35:14,502 --> 01:35:19,131
You ain't got your senses back yet,
what few you ever had.

937
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:22,593
The café won't run itself.
You rest up now.

938
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,929
Here's for the cheeseburger.

939
01:35:25,096 --> 01:35:27,598
Okay, I'll bring your change
when I bring your supper.

940
01:35:27,765 --> 01:35:29,266
Thanks.

941
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:57,753
Sonny?

942
01:35:59,755 --> 01:36:01,590
Oh, come on in.

943
01:36:01,757 --> 01:36:04,677
<i>"I Can't Help It." Hank Williams.</i>
<i>Big sound from last year.</i>

944
01:36:04,844 --> 01:36:07,805
<i>Now here's a brand-new one,</i>
<i>just came in from Webb Pierce.</i>

945
01:36:07,972 --> 01:36:09,849
<i>Gonna hear it a lot, I bet.</i>

946
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:12,101
Oh, I was so worried.
I just had to see you.

947
01:36:12,268 --> 01:36:13,978
Oh, I've been missing you.

948
01:36:14,145 --> 01:36:17,481
And I'm a lot better than I was.
Here, sit down.

949
01:36:17,857 --> 01:36:21,527
You can't believe how famous we are.
We're all anybody talks about in town.

950
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:24,238
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I want us to get married.

951
01:36:24,905 --> 01:36:26,991
- What?
- I really do.

952
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:28,200
Get married?

953
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:30,578
Just as soon as you want to.
Don't you want to?

954
01:36:30,995 --> 01:36:33,038
Oh, yeah.

955
01:36:33,205 --> 01:36:36,625
I bet the town will be knocked for a loop.
They'll never forget it.

956
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,335
Ain't you going to college?

957
01:36:38,502 --> 01:36:42,214
I don't care about that.
I love you, and that's more important.

958
01:36:43,007 --> 01:36:45,009
You were so dear to fight for me.

959
01:36:45,176 --> 01:36:47,178
My folks won't like it, but we'll run off.

960
01:36:47,344 --> 01:36:49,221
- They'll kill us.
- No, they won't.

961
01:36:49,388 --> 01:36:51,307
- They'll kill me.
- They'll get over it.

962
01:36:51,474 --> 01:36:53,309
You're working for Daddy now anyway.

963
01:36:53,476 --> 01:36:56,854
Pretty soon, they'll love you
just as much as I do.

964
01:36:59,398 --> 01:37:01,233
Can we?

965
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,612
Sure, I just hope I can see to drive.

966
01:37:04,778 --> 01:37:07,406
Don't you worry. I can drive.

967
01:37:17,249 --> 01:37:19,168
Don't do that, Sonny.

968
01:37:19,335 --> 01:37:21,003
Why not?

969
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:23,464
We're man and wife now.
We can do anything.

970
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:26,634
Not while I'm driving.
I might have a wreck.

971
01:37:27,009 --> 01:37:31,222
Goodness. Wouldn't it be awful if Mama
and Daddy got the police after us?

972
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:34,767
- They don't even know where we are.
- Well, I had to leave them a note.

973
01:37:35,392 --> 01:37:37,561
So they wouldn't be worried
out of their mind.

974
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:39,396
Oh, you shouldn't have done that.

975
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:41,941
I figured they'd have to know sometime.

976
01:37:42,107 --> 01:37:44,276
Well, what could they get us for?

977
01:37:44,443 --> 01:37:47,446
We got a right to get married. Ain't we?

978
01:37:47,613 --> 01:37:49,698
I guess so.

979
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:55,913
I wish you didn't have
that stupid eye patch. It's really creepy.

980
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,083
Oh, hey, I can take it off pretty soon.

981
01:37:59,792 --> 01:38:04,463
About two hours, will be Lake Texoma.
Have a room to ourself.

982
01:38:04,630 --> 01:38:08,551
My goodness! You're sitting so close,
I can barely drive.

983
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,453
Oh, goodness.

984
01:38:59,727 --> 01:39:00,769
Howdy.

985
01:39:00,936 --> 01:39:03,272
- What part of Texas y'all from?
- Anarene.

986
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:05,649
Newlyweds, ain't you?

987
01:39:05,816 --> 01:39:09,320
Y'all better follow me on in.
I think somebody's looking for you.

988
01:39:09,486 --> 01:39:12,364
We got a right to get married.
How can you arrest us?

989
01:39:12,531 --> 01:39:15,909
I ain't arresting you.
I just want you to come with me.

990
01:39:16,076 --> 01:39:17,745
I don't know what your rights are.

991
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:19,788
I guess we better follow him, honey.

992
01:39:19,955 --> 01:39:22,499
I'll just be heartbroken
if my folks have done this.

993
01:39:27,963 --> 01:39:31,508
You think I worked hard so my daughter
could end up in a pool hall?

994
01:39:31,675 --> 01:39:34,053
- We was gonna get another apartment.
- I'll bet!

995
01:39:34,219 --> 01:39:35,304
Where are your car keys?

996
01:39:35,471 --> 01:39:37,723
It's a hell of a note! Just a hell of a note!

997
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:40,559
- Oh, shut up and take her home.
- You bet I will!

998
01:39:40,726 --> 01:39:44,688
You take her car.
As far as I'm concerned, he can walk!

999
01:40:12,966 --> 01:40:15,969
- Not much of a wedding night, huh?
- Nope.

1000
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:17,221
Not much of one.

1001
01:40:17,388 --> 01:40:20,849
Here. Have a little drink of bourbon.
It'll pick you up.

1002
01:40:21,016 --> 01:40:23,602
Take all of it. I'm gonna drive.

1003
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:26,897
You won't believe this…

1004
01:40:27,064 --> 01:40:30,693
… but you're lucky we got you
clear of her quick as we did.

1005
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:33,821
You'd have been a lot better off
staying with Ruth Popper.

1006
01:40:33,987 --> 01:40:36,365
Does everybody know about that?

1007
01:40:36,532 --> 01:40:38,200
Course.

1008
01:40:38,367 --> 01:40:42,746
Sounded like a good deal to me, kiddo.
Shouldn't let Jacy turn your head.

1009
01:40:42,913 --> 01:40:45,082
Well, she's prettier.

1010
01:40:45,833 --> 01:40:50,087
I guess I shouldn't have, though.
I guess I treated her terrible.

1011
01:40:50,254 --> 01:40:51,672
Guess you did.

1012
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,527
Sure weren't out of Texas very long.

1013
01:41:13,694 --> 01:41:17,197
Well, Oklahoma's not much
of an improvement.

1014
01:41:22,411 --> 01:41:24,705
It's not the same now.

1015
01:41:26,123 --> 01:41:29,126
Nothing's really been right
since Sam the Lion died.

1016
01:41:32,045 --> 01:41:33,547
No.

1017
01:41:34,715 --> 01:41:36,925
No, it hasn't.

1018
01:41:40,262 --> 01:41:42,264
Oh, God.

1019
01:41:44,892 --> 01:41:47,853
I get sad if I think of Sam for long.

1020
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,525
Did you know he had beautiful hands?

1021
01:41:55,402 --> 01:41:58,030
I guess you liked him, didn't you?

1022
01:41:58,655 --> 01:42:00,866
I guess everybody did.

1023
01:42:03,035 --> 01:42:06,497
Well, I'll tell you,
it was different with me, Sonny.

1024
01:42:06,663 --> 01:42:08,499
I loved him.

1025
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,585
He loved me too.

1026
01:42:15,047 --> 01:42:16,590
Are you—?

1027
01:42:17,257 --> 01:42:19,009
Are you the one he'd take swimming…

1028
01:42:19,593 --> 01:42:21,053
… out at the tank?

1029
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:23,806
He told you about that, huh?

1030
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,141
Yeah, I was the one.

1031
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:32,731
I guess if it wasn't for Sam, I'd…

1032
01:42:32,898 --> 01:42:36,777
… just about have missed it.
Whatever it is.

1033
01:42:37,986 --> 01:42:41,365
I'd have been one of them amity types
that thinks that…

1034
01:42:41,532 --> 01:42:45,536
… playing bridge is about
the best thing that life has to offer.

1035
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:55,546
Old Sam the Lion.

1036
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:02,678
Sam the Lion. Nobody knows
where he got that name. I gave it to him.

1037
01:43:02,845 --> 01:43:04,429
One night…

1038
01:43:04,596 --> 01:43:07,766
… it just came to me.

1039
01:43:11,144 --> 01:43:13,355
He was so pleased.

1040
01:43:16,692 --> 01:43:19,486
I was 22 years old then.

1041
01:43:20,487 --> 01:43:22,573
Can you imagine?

1042
01:43:26,285 --> 01:43:27,452
I tell you, Sonny…

1043
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:29,580
… it's terrible to only meet one man
in your whole life…

1044
01:43:29,746 --> 01:43:31,874
… who knows what you're worth.

1045
01:43:33,292 --> 01:43:34,334
Just terrible.

1046
01:43:37,546 --> 01:43:39,506
I've looked too.

1047
01:43:40,883 --> 01:43:43,677
You wouldn't believe how I've looked.

1048
01:43:48,056 --> 01:43:52,436
- Well, now I know why Sam liked you.
- Loved me.

1049
01:43:52,603 --> 01:43:54,354
Loved you, I mean.

1050
01:43:55,147 --> 01:43:56,773
Do you?

1051
01:43:57,983 --> 01:44:01,278
I can kind of see what he saw in you too.

1052
01:44:10,245 --> 01:44:12,581
Nope. I'll just go on home.

1053
01:44:12,748 --> 01:44:14,082
Go on. Get out.

1054
01:44:18,712 --> 01:44:22,257
Think I could—?
Think I could learn to drink?

1055
01:44:28,472 --> 01:44:31,016
You might. Better keep on practising.

1056
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,799
That Logan boy's a quarterback,
now, ain't he?

1057
01:45:03,966 --> 01:45:06,551
Boy, we've finally got us a team!

1058
01:45:06,718 --> 01:45:08,971
Didn't back in your day,
did they, Sonny?

1059
01:45:09,137 --> 01:45:10,764
No, we wasn't much good.

1060
01:45:10,931 --> 01:45:13,100
Well, you just never learned
the fundamentals.

1061
01:45:13,266 --> 01:45:16,061
You know, blocking and tackling.

1062
01:45:16,228 --> 01:45:17,896
Not like this team.

1063
01:45:18,063 --> 01:45:20,440
- When was it you graduated?
- Last year.

1064
01:45:20,607 --> 01:45:21,733
You don't mean it.

1065
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:25,237
Seems like longer than that
since you and old Duane played ball.

1066
01:45:25,404 --> 01:45:26,947
I seen Duane a while ago.

1067
01:45:27,114 --> 01:45:29,616
He's home on leave,
wearing his uniform.

1068
01:45:29,783 --> 01:45:32,035
I ain't seen him yet.

1069
01:45:37,249 --> 01:45:39,001
- How are you, Chester?
- Fine, coach.

1070
01:45:39,167 --> 01:45:42,421
Now, listen, see if we can't stretch
that goddamn thing a little.

1071
01:45:42,587 --> 01:45:47,175
You know a man never ought to cheat,
unless it's for a good cause.

1072
01:45:48,135 --> 01:45:50,387
He's a good old boy, ain't he?

1073
01:46:42,689 --> 01:46:44,316
Hi, Mrs Jackson.

1074
01:46:44,483 --> 01:46:45,609
Duane here?

1075
01:46:45,776 --> 01:46:50,072
That's his car out there, ain't it?
He's here if he ain't walked off.

1076
01:46:57,871 --> 01:46:59,414
Hi, how you been?

1077
01:46:59,873 --> 01:47:01,917
Oh, pretty good.

1078
01:47:04,086 --> 01:47:06,880
I been thinking all week
that I'd run into you.

1079
01:47:07,047 --> 01:47:08,256
Yeah.

1080
01:47:09,508 --> 01:47:11,384
I heard you was going off to Korea.

1081
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:14,513
Thought I'd get over here
and see you before you got off.

1082
01:47:15,472 --> 01:47:18,642
Glad you did. I'm taking
the bus out early in the morning.

1083
01:47:26,274 --> 01:47:27,692
Want to go to the picture show?

1084
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:31,071
Miss Mosey's having to close it.
Tonight's the last night.

1085
01:47:31,488 --> 01:47:33,448
Yeah, might as well go.

1086
01:47:33,615 --> 01:47:36,701
Hate to miss the last night.
Take the Mercury.

1087
01:47:36,868 --> 01:47:39,496
Be the last chance I'll have
to drive it for a while.

1088
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:47,129
<i>Ready, Matthew?</i>

1089
01:47:47,295 --> 01:47:48,338
<i>All ready.</i>

1090
01:48:14,197 --> 01:48:16,575
<i>Take them to Missouri, Matt.</i>

1091
01:49:15,634 --> 01:49:17,219
- That was a good movie.
- Yeah.

1092
01:49:17,385 --> 01:49:19,721
Seen it here before once.

1093
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,183
Why don't we run over to Wichita
and drink some beer?

1094
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:25,936
Okay. I got lots of time till morning.

1095
01:49:26,102 --> 01:49:27,354
Sure.

1096
01:49:29,147 --> 01:49:30,398
Well, so long, Miss Mosey.

1097
01:49:30,565 --> 01:49:31,900
Sorry you're closing the show.

1098
01:49:32,067 --> 01:49:34,611
Nobody wants to come
to shows no more.

1099
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:39,074
Kid baseball in the summer,
television all the time.

1100
01:49:40,283 --> 01:49:43,954
Sam had lived, I believe
we could've kept it going.

1101
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:46,790
But I just didn't have the know-how.

1102
01:49:47,916 --> 01:49:50,293
Won't be much to do in town
with the picture show closed.

1103
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:51,920
Yeah.

1104
01:49:53,713 --> 01:49:55,715
Well, so long.

1105
01:49:55,882 --> 01:49:57,050
Duane.

1106
01:49:58,343 --> 01:50:00,387
You watch out now, overseas.

1107
01:50:23,451 --> 01:50:25,787
Sure weren't no women around.

1108
01:50:28,456 --> 01:50:31,418
I guess the next piece of ass
I get will be yellow.

1109
01:50:32,168 --> 01:50:33,962
I wish I was going with you.

1110
01:50:36,339 --> 01:50:38,300
Why don't you take care
of the car for me?

1111
01:50:38,842 --> 01:50:40,343
Your ma don't need it?

1112
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:43,555
I wouldn't want her driving it.
No better than she can drive.

1113
01:50:43,722 --> 01:50:46,057
Help her take the groceries home
if you got time.

1114
01:50:46,224 --> 01:50:47,600
Okay.

1115
01:50:59,946 --> 01:51:01,364
You ever—?

1116
01:51:01,531 --> 01:51:03,033
You ever hear from Jacy?

1117
01:51:03,825 --> 01:51:05,785
No, not a thing.

1118
01:51:05,952 --> 01:51:09,998
She don't get home much.
Ain't been back to town since August.

1119
01:51:10,165 --> 01:51:12,250
I guess she just stays in Dallas
all the time.

1120
01:51:12,959 --> 01:51:15,128
Yeah, probably does.

1121
01:51:16,254 --> 01:51:18,256
I guess there's lots to do
down in Dallas.

1122
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:26,431
I ain't over her yet, you know.

1123
01:51:28,516 --> 01:51:30,727
I ain't over her yet.

1124
01:51:31,603 --> 01:51:33,813
It's the damnedest thing.

1125
01:51:36,483 --> 01:51:38,610
That's the only reason—

1126
01:51:38,777 --> 01:51:41,863
The only reason you and I got
into it that time, you know.

1127
01:51:43,782 --> 01:51:46,076
Hey, reckon she likes it
down in Dallas?

1128
01:51:46,242 --> 01:51:47,911
It's hard to say. Maybe she does.

1129
01:51:51,414 --> 01:51:54,542
Reckon you and her would've got it
all straighted out if I hadn't butted in?

1130
01:51:54,709 --> 01:51:56,419
No.

1131
01:51:57,003 --> 01:51:58,713
No.

1132
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:01,841
No, they'd have annulled me too,
even if we had.

1133
01:52:03,885 --> 01:52:05,637
Y'all—?

1134
01:52:06,971 --> 01:52:08,848
Y'all never even got into the motel?

1135
01:52:09,474 --> 01:52:11,059
No.

1136
01:52:14,938 --> 01:52:16,564
Well…

1137
01:52:17,565 --> 01:52:20,360
… better get on before we both freeze.

1138
01:52:30,078 --> 01:52:31,955
Here are the keys.

1139
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:36,167
- So long, buddy.
- So long, Duane.

1140
01:52:36,835 --> 01:52:38,586
Be careful.

1141
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,463
I'll take care of the Mercury.

1142
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:43,258
I'll see you in a year or two
if I don't get shot.

1143
01:54:12,931 --> 01:54:13,973
He ought to be in bed.

1144
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:17,977
- The wind is blowing real hard.
- He was right out in front of that station.

1145
01:54:18,144 --> 01:54:20,396
Christ, the trucker didn't have a chance.

1146
01:54:20,563 --> 01:54:23,191
Yeah, he's out here all the time
doing something.

1147
01:54:24,234 --> 01:54:26,319
I can see it wasn't your fault.

1148
01:54:29,989 --> 01:54:33,034
The sand was blowing.
I never noticed him.

1149
01:54:33,201 --> 01:54:34,744
Figured nobody'd be in the street.

1150
01:54:34,911 --> 01:54:37,455
What was he doing out there
carrying that broom?

1151
01:54:37,622 --> 01:54:40,542
He weren't doing nothing.
Just a simple-minded kid.

1152
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:42,377
- Never had no sense.
- Wasn't your fault.

1153
01:54:42,544 --> 01:54:44,462
Hell, no, mister! I can see that.

1154
01:54:44,629 --> 01:54:46,422
He was just a dumb old kid.

1155
01:54:46,589 --> 01:54:49,551
Didn't know enough
to keep his ass out of the cold.

1156
01:54:49,717 --> 01:54:51,719
Let's go to the café. Ain't had breakfast.

1157
01:54:51,886 --> 01:54:54,806
I'd still like to know
what he was doing with that broom.

1158
01:54:54,973 --> 01:54:57,809
He was sweeping, you sons of bitches!

1159
01:54:57,976 --> 01:55:00,019
He was sweeping!

1160
01:56:03,583 --> 01:56:06,210
Y'all got some crazy kids in this town,
if you ask me.

1161
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:35,359
Hi.

1162
01:58:39,655 --> 01:58:42,241
Could I have a cup of coffee with you?

1163
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:46,913
I guess.

1164
01:58:55,379 --> 01:58:58,424
I'm sorry. I'm still in my bathrobe.

1165
01:59:20,196 --> 01:59:22,532
What am I doing apologising to you?

1166
01:59:22,698 --> 01:59:25,618
Why am I always apologising to you,
you little bastard?

1167
01:59:26,869 --> 01:59:29,956
Three months I've apologised to you
without you even being here!

1168
01:59:30,122 --> 01:59:33,793
I haven't done anything wrong.
Why can't I quit apologising?

1169
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:35,461
You ought to be sorry!

1170
01:59:35,795 --> 01:59:38,089
I wouldn't still be in my bathrobe
if not for you.

1171
01:59:38,256 --> 01:59:40,132
I'd have my clothes on hours ago.

1172
01:59:40,299 --> 01:59:44,220
You're the one made me quit caring
if I got dressed or not!

1173
01:59:45,304 --> 01:59:47,348
Just because your friend got killed…

1174
01:59:47,515 --> 01:59:51,060
… you want me to forget what you did
and make it all right.

1175
01:59:51,227 --> 01:59:53,354
I'm not sorry for you.

1176
01:59:53,521 --> 01:59:56,065
You'd have left Billy too,
just like you left me.

1177
01:59:56,232 --> 01:59:58,276
I bet you left him plenty of nights…

1178
01:59:58,442 --> 02:00:00,319
… whenever Jacy whistled.

1179
02:00:00,486 --> 02:00:02,405
I wouldn't treat a dog that way.

1180
02:00:02,905 --> 02:00:07,326
You thought I was so old and ugly,
you didn't owe me any explanation.

1181
02:00:07,493 --> 02:00:09,161
You didn't need to be careful of me.

1182
02:00:09,328 --> 02:00:12,582
There was nothing I could do
about you and her, so why be careful?

1183
02:00:12,748 --> 02:00:13,958
You didn't love me.

1184
02:00:14,876 --> 02:00:15,918
Look at me.

1185
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,714
Can't you even look at me?

1186
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:34,186
See?

1187
02:00:35,229 --> 02:00:37,356
Shouldn't have come here.

1188
02:00:37,523 --> 02:00:39,984
I'm around that corner now.

1189
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,403
You've ruined it.

1190
02:00:42,570 --> 02:00:45,239
It's lost completely.

1191
02:00:47,366 --> 02:00:50,786
Just your needing me
won't make it come back.

1192
02:02:35,099 --> 02:02:37,685
Never you mind, honey.

1193
02:02:38,144 --> 02:02:40,354
Never you mind.
