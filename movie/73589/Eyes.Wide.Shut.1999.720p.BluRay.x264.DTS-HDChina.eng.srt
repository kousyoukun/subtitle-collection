1
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,462
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:08,215
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:17,266
Now listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:18,517
I know.

5
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,603
How do I look?

6
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:22,271
Perfect.

7
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:24,190
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:25,816
It's great.

9
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:28,110
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,780
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:32,907
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:35,451
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,120
Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:39,330
Coming.

15
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:41,791
All right.

16
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,250
I'm ready.

17
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:01,978
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:03,104
Roz.

19
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:08,526
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,570
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:14,073
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:16,909
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch The Nutcracker?

23
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:19,036
-What time's it on?
-9:00.

24
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:21,872
-You can watch that.
-Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:25,167
-No, darling.
-it'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,586
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:30,548
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:32,508
We shouldn't be later than 1 :00.

29
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:35,428
-I'll hold our cab to take you home.
-Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:37,013
You be good, baby.

31
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:40,641
-Good night, sweetheart.
-See you in the morning.

32
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:53,195
-Victor, Illona.
-Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:55,948
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:56,324 --> 00:03:00,786
-Thanks so much for coming.
-We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:04,081
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

36
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,208
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

37
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,169
-Yes, he does.
-He does?

38
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:11,380
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:14,967
-You ought to see my serve now.
-He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:17,678
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:20,306
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:23,225
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:38,240
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:42,078
Not a soul.

45
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:54,382
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:59,971
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:13,359
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:16,988
I went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,656
Really?

50
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:24,412
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:28,791
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:34,380
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:37,925
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 1 0 minutes.

54
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:39,760
Thank you.

55
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,853
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:51,480
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:55,610
You go and say hello, and 
meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,153
Good.

59
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:09,165
Nightingale.

60
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:11,125
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,669
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,964
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:20,718
-How long has it been?
-I don't know. 10 years?

64
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:22,261
And a couple.

65
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:24,680
-Do you have time for a drink?
-Sure.

66
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,937
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,023
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:36,943
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,445
I see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:42,198
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:45,660
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:49,914
You know what they say:
""Once a doctor, always a doctor. ""

73
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:54,418
Yes, or in my case:
""Never a doctor, never a doctor. ""

74
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:57,672
I never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:00,758
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

76
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:02,176
Cheers.

77
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,180
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

78
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:08,015
Be right with you.

79
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,893
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

80
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:14,897
... I'll be down at the Village
For two weeks at the Sonata Caf?

81
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:17,775
-Stop by if you get a chance.
-I'll be there.

82
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:21,570
-it's great seeing you.
-Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,490
I think that's my glass.

84
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:09,827
I'm absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:27,845
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

86
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:40,900
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,277
I'm American.

88
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:45,863
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:52,203
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?

90
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,959
Didn't he wind up all by himself...?

91
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,920
...crying his eyes out...

92
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:04,882
...in some place with 
a very bad climate?

93
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:09,011
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,806
A very good time.

95
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:17,061
Are you here with 
anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:22,191
With my husband.

97
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:24,443
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:30,116
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:37,123
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:41,085
Well, at the moment...

101
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,213
... I'm looking for a job.

102
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:49,176
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:51,929
But it went broke.

104
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,641
What a shame.

105
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:59,854
I have some friends in the art game.

106
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:02,773
Perhaps I can be of some help.

107
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:08,195
Thank you.

108
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,008
Someone you know?

109
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:34,555
My...

110
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:36,557
... Husband.

111
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:44,315
Don't you think one of 
the charms of marriage...

112
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:49,153
... Is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

113
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:55,701
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

114
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:59,914
...who could have any man in 
this room, wants to be married?

115
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,835
Why wouldn't she?

116
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,756
is it as bad as that?

117
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:12,343
As good as that.

118
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,929
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

119
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:19,767
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

120
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:23,771
How do you spell Nuala?

121
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:29,318
N-U-A-L-A.

122
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:33,781
You don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:37,535
You were very kind to me once.

124
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:41,497
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

125
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:47,169
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

126
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:48,963
...on a very windy day...?

127
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,384
-And you got something in your eye.
-Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

128
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:57,305
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

129
00:10:57,471 --> 00:11:00,016
...which was also clean.

130
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:05,396
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

131
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:09,483
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

132
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:13,237
Why don't you tell me?

133
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:17,950
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

134
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:21,954
...and be free to do what 
they wanted with other men.

135
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,207
The ones they really wanted.

136
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,881
Fascinating.

137
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:39,597
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

138
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:44,727
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

139
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:49,065
They always seem so...

140
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:51,525
...knowledgeable.

141
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:56,364
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

142
00:11:56,572 --> 00:11:59,450
...about all sorts of things.

143
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,537
But I bet they work too hard.

144
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:07,833
Just think of all they miss.

145
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:11,087
You're probably right.

146
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:16,884
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

147
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:19,095
Exactly?

148
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:24,100
Where the rainbow ends.

149
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:26,560
Where the rainbow ends?

150
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:30,231
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,526
Now that depends where that is.

152
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:35,403
Well, let's find out.

153
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:38,447
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

154
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:42,952
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

155
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:46,455
Fine.

156
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:49,625
To be continued?

157
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,525
Bill, thanks for coming.

158
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:19,405
We had a little accident here.

159
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,157
What happened?

160
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,618
Well, she was...

161
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:28,289
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

162
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:31,292
What did she take?

163
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:35,796
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

164
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:37,840
It's heroin and coke.

165
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,803
Heroin and coke?

166
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:46,641
Anything else?

167
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:51,562
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

168
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:53,731
How long has she been like this?

169
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,401
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

170
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,736
What's her name?

171
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:01,113
Mandy.

172
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:12,541
Can you hear me, Mandy?

173
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,505
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

174
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:22,093
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

175
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:23,886
You can hear me.

176
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:28,307
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

177
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:32,353
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

178
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:35,564
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

179
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:38,609
Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:42,530
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

181
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,199
Good.

182
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:48,077
Good.

183
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:53,332
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

184
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:59,130
It's wonderful.

185
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:03,634
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

186
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,640
I haven't.

187
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:15,229
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

188
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,567
Do you like the period?

189
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:24,447
I do.

190
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:27,241
I adore it.

191
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,787
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

192
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:35,249
Would you like to see it?

193
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,129
I can show it to you.

194
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:45,635
We won't be gone long.

195
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,852
Maybe...

196
00:15:57,521 --> 00:16:00,650
...not just...

197
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:03,235
...now.

198
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:25,549
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

199
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:28,469
Sorry.

200
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,605
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

201
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:42,775
Better.

202
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,831
You are a very, very lucky girl.

203
00:16:57,957 --> 00:16:59,375
You know that?

204
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:03,212
I know.

205
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:06,549
You're gonna be okay this time.

206
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:11,053
But you can't keep doing this.

207
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:13,306
You understand?

208
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:21,647
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

209
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,026
I know.

210
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,413
Well, Victor...

211
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,167
... I'll leave the rest to you.

212
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:44,086
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

213
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:48,007
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

214
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:49,675
Another hour?

215
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:54,597
Then have someone take her home.

216
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,146
Good night, Mandy.

217
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:07,276
I can't thank you enough for this.

218
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:10,279
-You saved my ass.
-I'm glad I was here.

219
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:12,907
Bill, I probably... .

220
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:17,244
I know I don't have to mention this...

221
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:20,414
... but this is just between us.

222
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:22,166
Of course.

223
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,918
Thanks.

224
00:18:44,981 --> 00:18:49,568
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

225
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,325
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

226
00:18:56,534 --> 00:19:01,163
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

227
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,084
Yes...

228
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:08,129
...but will I?

229
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:10,464
Of course you will.

230
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:19,473
I really have to go.
I have to go.

231
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:21,475
You don't, you know.

232
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:25,813
Yes, I do.

233
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,987
I must see you again.

234
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:37,408
-That's impossible.
-Why?

235
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:40,620
Because...

236
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:45,499
...I'm married.

237
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:51,816
Good morning, Lisa.

238
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:54,151
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

239
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:57,280
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

240
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,115
-Sure.
-Thank you.

241
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:02,660
-Good morning, Sarah.
-Good morning, doctor.

242
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,955
""'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...

243
00:21:06,122 --> 00:21:09,000
...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse. ""

244
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:15,756
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

245
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,179
Hold this for Mommy.

246
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:25,558
Looking forward to Christmas?

247
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:28,394
Does this hurt?

248
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,993
Right there?

249
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,839
Daddy's gonna like that.

250
00:21:57,548 --> 00:21:59,300
Very good choice.

251
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:02,386
""--before me...

252
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:07,850
...when I jump into my bed. ""

253
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:14,023
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

254
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:16,859
I've taken care of that.

255
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:19,820
Good.

256
00:22:20,696 --> 00:22:24,158
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

257
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:28,037
Let's do that tomorrow.

258
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,252
Tell me something.

259
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:24,510
Those two girls...

260
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:28,973
...at the party last night... .

261
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:36,814
Did you...

262
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:40,192
...by any chance...

263
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:42,903
...happen to...

264
00:23:44,572 --> 00:23:47,366
...fuck them?

265
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:51,329
What?

266
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,917
What are you talking about?

267
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:04,592
I'm talking about the two girls...

268
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:08,763
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

269
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:13,517
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

270
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:18,564
Who were they?

271
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:25,529
They were just a couple of models.

272
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:34,121
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

273
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,290
Wait a minute.

274
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:44,674
I didn't disappear with anybody.

275
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:50,096
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

276
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,808
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

277
00:24:57,603 --> 00:25:00,564
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

278
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:09,615
A friend of the Zieglers.

279
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:13,703
What did he want?

280
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:15,997
What did he want?

281
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:24,338
Sex...

282
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,342
...upstairs.

283
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,304
Then and there.

284
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:35,266
Is that all?

285
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:38,185
Yeah, that was all.

286
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:41,188
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

287
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:47,028
That's right.

288
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:49,655
Well, I guess that's understandable.

289
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:54,827
Understandable?

290
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:57,872
Because you are a very...

291
00:25:58,914 --> 00:26:01,083
...very beautiful woman.

292
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,546
Wait.

293
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,218
Because I'm a beautiful woman...

294
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:15,723
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

295
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,938
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

296
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:29,403
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

297
00:26:31,697 --> 00:26:36,410
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

298
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:40,414
So on that basis...

299
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:45,628
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

300
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:50,591
There are exceptions.

301
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:56,138
And what makes you an exception?

302
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:02,561
What makes me an exception is that...

303
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:06,232
...I happen to be in love with you.

304
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:08,901
And because we're married...

305
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,406
...and because I would never
lie to you...

306
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:15,658
...or hurt you.

307
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:27,378
Do you realize that
what you' re saying...

308
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:30,965
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

309
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:33,759
...is out of consideration for me?

310
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:37,013
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

311
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,141
Let's just relax, Alice.

312
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:42,935
This pot is making you aggressive.

313
00:27:43,185 --> 00:27:46,564
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

314
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:49,400
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

315
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,194
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

316
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:55,615
I don't even know what 
we're arguing about here.

317
00:27:55,823 --> 00:27:58,034
I'm not arguing.

318
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:03,289
I'm just trying to find out
where you' re coming from.

319
00:28:03,664 --> 00:28:05,249
Where I'm coming from?

320
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:14,425
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

321
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:18,763
...standing in your office naked...

322
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:21,641
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

323
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:23,643
Now, what I want to know... .

324
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:28,856
I want to know what you're thinking
about when you' re squeezing them.

325
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,194
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

326
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,988
It's all very impersonal...

327
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:39,784
...and you know there's 
always a nurse present.

328
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:45,206
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

329
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:46,457
Exactly.

330
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:51,212
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

331
00:28:52,546 --> 00:28:56,676
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

332
00:28:56,884 --> 00:28:59,136
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

333
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:03,641
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

334
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:10,022
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

335
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:14,485
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

336
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:16,612
And what makes you so sure?

337
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:23,661
If for no better reason...

338
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:27,164
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

339
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,837
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

340
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,298
What then?

341
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:38,926
I don't know, Alice... .

342
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:41,762
What then?

343
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:47,602
Women don't... 

344
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:52,315
They basically just don't
think like that.

345
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:58,154
Millions of years of evolution, right?

346
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,450
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

347
00:30:02,658 --> 00:30:05,870
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

348
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:08,331
...and whatever the fuck else!

349
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:12,293
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

350
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:16,464
If you men only knew.

351
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:21,969
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

352
00:30:22,178 --> 00:30:25,306
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

353
00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:27,642
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

354
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,018
No, I'm not.

355
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:31,312
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

356
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:32,521
No, I haven't.

357
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,232
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

358
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:39,403
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

359
00:30:39,612 --> 00:30:41,989
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

360
00:30:42,198 --> 00:30:44,992
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

361
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:49,497
You are very, very sure of yourself...

362
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:50,998
... aren't you?

363
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,667
No.

364
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:55,169
I'm sure of you.

365
00:31:07,473 --> 00:31:09,308
Do you think that's funny?

366
00:31:18,317 --> 00:31:20,027
All right. Fuck it.

367
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,615
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

368
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:37,545
Do you... 

369
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:43,384
Do you remember last 
summer at Cape Cod?

370
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,394
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

371
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:55,771
...there was this young naval officer...

372
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,568
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

373
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,112
No.

374
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:09,952
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

375
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,830
Nothing rings a bell?

376
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:20,796
Well...

377
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:26,802
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

378
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:30,264
He was checking into the hotel...

379
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:34,018
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

380
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:36,687
... to the elevator.

381
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:45,613
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

382
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,616
Nothing more.

383
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:59,085
But I could hardly...

384
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:02,296
...move.

385
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:13,516
That afternoon...

386
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,855
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

387
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,736
...and you and I made love.

388
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:33,327
And we made plans about our future...

389
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:38,499
...and we talked about Helena.

390
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,877
And yet...

391
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:45,715
...at no time...

392
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,635
...was he ever...

393
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:54,599
...out of my mind.

394
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:04,942
And I thought if he wanted me...

395
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:09,280
...even if it was only...

396
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:12,783
...for one night...

397
00:34:16,996 --> 00:34:20,791
...I was ready to give up everything.

398
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,878
You.

399
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:27,923
Helena.

400
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:34,305
My whole fucking future.

401
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:38,184
Everything.

402
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:49,111
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

403
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:53,032
...you were dearer to me than ever.

404
00:34:57,536 --> 00:35:00,665
And at that moment, my love for you...

405
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:04,543
...was both...

406
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:11,968
...tender and sad.

407
00:35:22,895 --> 00:35:25,648
I barely slept that night...

408
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,862
...and I woke up the 
next morning in a panic.

409
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:37,952
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

410
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:42,790
...or that he might still be there.

411
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:50,339
But by dinner...

412
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:56,846
...I realized he was gone...

413
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:05,521
...and I was...

414
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,482
...relieved.

415
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:39,221
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

416
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:47,396
When did it happen?

417
00:36:54,236 --> 00:36:55,738
I have the address.

418
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:57,865
Thank you.

419
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:07,833
Lou Nathanson just died.

420
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:19,387
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

421
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:15,985
-Hello, Rosa.
-Good evening, Dr. Harford.

422
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:21,282
-How is Miss Nathanson?
-Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

423
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:22,575
Thank you.

424
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,133
Come in.

425
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:46,515
Marion...

426
00:38:48,351 --> 00:38:50,186
Oh, Dr. Harford...

427
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,731
How good of you to come.

428
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,400
I came as soon as I got the message.

429
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:57,818
Thank you.

430
00:38:59,862 --> 00:39:01,989
-I'm so sorry.
-Thank you.

431
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:04,033
Your father was... 

432
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,037
He was a very brave man.

433
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:10,289
Oh, thank you.

434
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:12,708
How are you holding up?

435
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,712
I'm a bit numb.

436
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:19,924
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

437
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,469
Would you like to sit down?

438
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,459
It's so unreal.

439
00:39:56,752 --> 00:39:58,838
Daddy had such a good day.

440
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:05,428
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

441
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,558
Then he had a little dinner...

442
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,270
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

443
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:20,401
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

444
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,864
...and when I went to see how he was...

445
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:27,450
...I just thought he was asleep.

446
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:36,459
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

447
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:43,841
From what you've said...

448
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:48,095
...I'm sure your father died 
peacefully in his sleep.

449
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,099
Oh, God, I hope so.

450
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:59,273
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

451
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:02,026
...than his death itself.

452
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:06,572
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

453
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:13,162
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

454
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:16,624
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

455
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,710
...and he'll be coming over soon.

456
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,301
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

457
00:41:28,678 --> 00:41:31,764
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

458
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:34,016
A math professor.

459
00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:40,648
We're going to get married in May.

460
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:46,612
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

461
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:51,826
Thank you.

462
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:58,124
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

463
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,418
We'll be moving out there soon.

464
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:05,256
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

465
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,849
It really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

466
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:36,704
Oh, my God, no... .

467
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:58,392
I love you.

468
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,229
I love you.

469
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:05,191
I love you, I love you, I love you.

470
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,402
I don't want to go away with Carl.

471
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:10,780
Marion, I don't think you realize--

472
00:43:10,947 --> 00:43:12,281
I do.

473
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:17,536
Even if I'm never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

474
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,290
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

475
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:27,380
You're very upset, and I don't think
you realize what you' re saying.

476
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,591
I love you.

477
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:34,887
We barely know each other.

478
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:39,558
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

479
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,477
I love you.

480
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,527
That's probably Carl.

481
00:43:50,653 --> 00:43:52,863
Please don't despise me.

482
00:43:58,661 --> 00:44:00,746
-Hello, Rosa.
-Hello, Mr. Thomas.

483
00:44:02,415 --> 00:44:05,751
-is she in the bedroom?
-Yes, she is.

484
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,044
Thank you.

485
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:19,557
Come in.

486
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,063
Darling.

487
00:44:30,026 --> 00:44:32,111
I'm so very sorry.

488
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:34,572
Are you all right?

489
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:36,657
I'm okay.

490
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:42,079
-Dr. Harford, good evening.
-Good evening, Carl.

491
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:45,207
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

492
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,336
-it's the least I could do.
-it means a lot to us.

493
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:49,795
Thank you.

494
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:57,511
I was actually on my way out.

495
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:01,515
Marion...

496
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:05,394
...your father was very proud of you...

497
00:45:05,686 --> 00:45:10,691
...and I know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

498
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,402
Thank you.

499
00:45:19,992 --> 00:45:22,203
I'll show you out.

500
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,082
Good night.

501
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:16,424
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

502
00:46:16,632 --> 00:46:19,135
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

503
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:22,722
I'm serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

504
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,807
What team's this switch hitter
playing for?

505
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:27,435
-Looks like the pink team.
-Look at this faggot!

506
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:29,395
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

507
00:46:29,604 --> 00:46:31,939
Merry Christmas, Mary!

508
00:46:32,148 --> 00:46:34,734
-Your butt-brothers are back there!
-Prime cut of meat!

509
00:46:34,984 --> 00:46:38,446
You want to take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

510
00:46:39,488 --> 00:46:42,450
You should have tits,
you' re standing so close!

511
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:46,746
-I got dumps that are bigger than you!
-Come on, macho man!

512
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:50,207
-You want a piece of this, baby?
-Exit only, honey.

513
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:54,003
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

514
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,403
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

515
00:47:20,363 --> 00:47:22,031
Ten past 12.

516
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:26,243
Going anywhere special?

517
00:47:26,661 --> 00:47:29,664
No, I'm just taking a walk.

518
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:36,837
How'd you like to have a little fun?

519
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:39,757
I'm sorry?

520
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:42,927
Have a little fun?

521
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,681
I just live right down there.

522
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,059
Would you like to come inside with me?

523
00:47:51,185 --> 00:47:53,396
Come inside with you?

524
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:59,652
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

525
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:08,619
You live in there?

526
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,082
By yourself?

527
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:16,043
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

528
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,005
Hey, it's okay.

529
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:21,841
Listen, no one will bother us.

530
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:24,385
It's okay. Come on.

531
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:26,220
Come on.

532
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:53,748
This is it.

533
00:48:57,919 --> 00:48:59,420
That's a nice tree.

534
00:49:05,718 --> 00:49:09,472
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

535
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,613
It's...

536
00:49:26,822 --> 00:49:28,616
...cozy. It's a...

537
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:30,952
...cozy place.

538
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:33,496
It's okay.

539
00:49:49,303 --> 00:49:53,724
Do you suppose we should 
talk about money?

540
00:49:54,475 --> 00:49:55,977
Yeah, I guess so.

541
00:49:57,645 --> 00:49:59,730
That depends on what you want to do.

542
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:05,778
What do you want to do?

543
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:11,867
What do you recommend?

544
00:50:16,664 --> 00:50:18,374
What do I recommend?

545
00:50:33,014 --> 00:50:35,891
I'd rather not put it into words.

546
00:50:38,686 --> 00:50:40,855
How about you just leave it up to me?

547
00:50:41,355 --> 00:50:43,149
I'm in your hands.

548
00:50:46,027 --> 00:50:48,613
And how does 1 50 sound?

549
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:52,116
Sounds wonderful.

550
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,082
Don't worry. I don't
keep track of the time.

551
00:51:07,924 --> 00:51:08,841
Thank you.

552
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,051
Prego, Prego.

553
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:12,553
-Grazie.
-You're welcome.

554
00:51:13,512 --> 00:51:16,015
If I was Italian, he'd have
answered me in Italian.

555
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:01,644
Shall we?

556
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,372
Excuse me.

557
00:52:35,678 --> 00:52:37,471
Is everything all right?

558
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:44,645
I was just wondering if you
were going to be much longer?

559
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:51,152
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

560
00:52:51,986 --> 00:52:53,863
It could be awhile.

561
00:52:55,323 --> 00:52:57,491
Any idea how long?

562
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:00,786
No, I don't really know.

563
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:03,914
We're still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

564
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,212
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now.

565
00:53:28,522 --> 00:53:32,276
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

566
00:53:52,546 --> 00:53:54,048
Do you have to go?

567
00:53:55,341 --> 00:53:57,468
Do I have to go?

568
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:03,808
I think I do.

569
00:54:06,602 --> 00:54:08,020
Are you sure?

570
00:54:14,193 --> 00:54:16,404
Yes, I'm afraid so.

571
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:22,576
But listen, I want to pay you anyway.

572
00:54:23,077 --> 00:54:27,456
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

573
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,922
But you know what? You don't
have to bother about that.

574
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:36,591
No, it's all right.

575
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:40,636
-No, really. You don't have to.
-No, I want to.

576
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:44,181
Really?

577
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:48,728
Well, thank you very much.

578
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:34,649
Thank you.

579
00:55:49,163 --> 00:55:52,458
Would you like a table,
or would you like to sit at the bar?

580
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:55,503
-I'd like a table.
-Please follow me.

581
00:56:03,636 --> 00:56:05,846
-Can I take your coat?
-Thank you.

582
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:09,016
Could I get you anything to drink?

583
00:56:10,184 --> 00:56:12,520
-I'd like a beer.
-Certainly.

584
00:56:23,322 --> 00:56:25,533
One, two, one-two-three-four.

585
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:28,995
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

586
00:56:29,203 --> 00:56:33,916
On the bass, Mr. Larry McVey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

587
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:38,212
And on the guitar,
the one, the only, Mr. Bobby Berman.

588
00:56:38,421 --> 00:56:42,633
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

589
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:45,428
I'm Nick Nightingale. Good night.

590
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:58,399
-Nick, that was great.
-Thanks.

591
00:56:58,774 --> 00:57:02,111
-Nightingale.
-Hey, Bill, you made it.

592
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,865
I'm sorry, I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

593
00:57:06,073 --> 00:57:09,118
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

594
00:57:09,744 --> 00:57:12,913
-What are you drinking?
-A vodka and tonic, please.

595
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:15,541
Thank you.

596
00:57:17,293 --> 00:57:19,587
So what brings you out at this hour?

597
00:57:19,795 --> 00:57:22,965
-I have a patient in the neighborhood.
-You live in the Village?

598
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:26,093
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

599
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:27,720
You're married?

600
00:57:28,346 --> 00:57:29,722
Nine years.

601
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:33,100
-Any kids?
-Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

602
00:57:33,309 --> 00:57:34,352
How about you?

603
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,188
I've got a wife
and four boys in Seattle.

604
00:57:37,396 --> 00:57:38,773
You're a long way from home.

605
00:57:39,231 --> 00:57:41,901
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

606
00:57:42,735 --> 00:57:43,736
Thank you.

607
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:52,244
-is this your band?
-No, it's a pick-up band.

608
00:57:52,453 --> 00:57:56,499
-Who do you normally play with?
-Anybody, anywhere.

609
00:57:56,749 --> 00:57:59,210
I got another gig later tonight.

610
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:01,337
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

611
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:03,256
They only get started around 2.

612
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:05,258
in the Village?

613
00:58:07,468 --> 00:58:10,888
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

614
00:58:11,305 --> 00:58:12,348
You don't?

615
00:58:13,015 --> 00:58:17,770
No. it may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

616
00:58:17,979 --> 00:58:20,773
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

617
00:58:20,982 --> 00:58:23,651
-A different place every time?
-So far.

618
00:58:24,777 --> 00:58:25,987
What's the big mystery?

619
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:30,032
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

620
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:36,998
Nick, I'm sorry.
is there something I'm missing here?

621
00:58:40,042 --> 00:58:42,878
I play blindfolded.

622
00:58:44,005 --> 00:58:45,172
What?

623
00:58:47,008 --> 00:58:49,594
I play blindfolded.

624
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:55,182
You're putting me on.

625
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:57,852
No, it's the truth.

626
00:58:58,853 --> 00:59:03,482
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

627
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,570
Oh, man.

628
00:59:08,738 --> 00:59:13,075
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

629
00:59:13,451 --> 00:59:15,119
...but never...

630
00:59:15,494 --> 00:59:17,913
...never anything like this...

631
00:59:18,664 --> 00:59:21,709
...and never such women.

632
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:33,220
Excuse me.

633
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:40,144
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

634
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:47,818
I know where that is.

635
00:59:55,409 --> 00:59:56,369
Right.

636
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:01,916
Well, I'm on my way right now.

637
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:05,211
Okay, sir. Thank you.

638
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:08,923
What is this?

639
01:00:10,508 --> 01:00:13,135
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

640
01:00:17,932 --> 01:00:19,600
it's the password.

641
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,852
The password?

642
01:00:23,104 --> 01:00:26,774
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

643
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:31,654
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

644
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:40,663
You know there is no way on earth...

645
01:00:41,122 --> 01:00:44,625
...that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

646
01:00:45,293 --> 01:00:48,963
-Come on, buddy, give me a break.
-Nick, I'll tell you what.

647
01:00:49,171 --> 01:00:52,425
I've already got the password.

648
01:00:53,342 --> 01:00:56,512
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

649
01:00:56,721 --> 01:01:00,308
...and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

650
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:07,189
Listen, let's just say
for one second...

651
01:01:08,149 --> 01:01:10,359
...that I was prepared to do that.

652
01:01:10,693 --> 01:01:14,030
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

653
01:01:15,197 --> 01:01:16,532
Why not?

654
01:01:16,991 --> 01:01:21,287
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

655
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:25,791
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

656
01:01:45,728 --> 01:01:47,897
Thanks. Keep the change.

657
01:02:01,035 --> 01:02:03,329
Yes? Who is it?

658
01:02:03,537 --> 01:02:05,289
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

659
01:02:05,498 --> 01:02:09,919
I apologize for disturbing you
at this hour, but I need your help.

660
01:02:11,045 --> 01:02:12,964
Who is it that you want?

661
01:02:14,548 --> 01:02:17,510
I'm very sorry.
I'm looking for Peter Grenning...

662
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,221
...the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

663
01:02:22,348 --> 01:02:23,849
What's your name?

664
01:02:24,058 --> 01:02:26,394
My name is Bill Harford.

665
01:02:26,602 --> 01:02:28,813
I'm Mr. Grenning's doctor.

666
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:31,732
You are Grenning's doctor?

667
01:02:34,902 --> 01:02:36,070
Okay.

668
01:02:36,612 --> 01:02:38,072
Just a moment.

669
01:02:53,254 --> 01:02:55,339
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

670
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,133
Yes, I am.

671
01:02:57,633 --> 01:03:01,512
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

672
01:03:02,305 --> 01:03:04,515
He moved to Chicago?

673
01:03:07,184 --> 01:03:09,228
I wasn't aware of that.

674
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:14,775
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

675
01:03:14,984 --> 01:03:16,611
Yes, I am.

676
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:17,987
Well, first of all...

677
01:03:18,237 --> 01:03:23,117
...please let me apologize again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr. 

678
01:03:23,326 --> 01:03:24,535
Milich.

679
01:03:24,744 --> 01:03:28,915
Mr. Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr. Harford...

680
01:03:29,123 --> 01:03:32,126
...this is my New York State
Medical Board card.

681
01:03:33,044 --> 01:03:36,005
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

682
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:39,634
If I see Peter, I tell him
you were looking for him.

683
01:03:39,842 --> 01:03:41,969
Oh, no, wait. Please, please...

684
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:46,098
Listen, the reason that
I came here tonight was...

685
01:03:48,142 --> 01:03:53,064
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

686
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:57,318
And I'd be happy to pay you
$ 1 00 over the rental price...

687
01:03:57,526 --> 01:03:59,195
...for the inconvenience.

688
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,323
A hundred dollars?

689
01:04:05,826 --> 01:04:07,495
I don't think so.

690
01:04:10,957 --> 01:04:12,833
How about $200?

691
01:04:13,459 --> 01:04:16,003
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

692
01:04:27,848 --> 01:04:29,100
Come in.

693
01:04:33,562 --> 01:04:36,190
Can't be too careful these days.

694
01:04:39,402 --> 01:04:40,569
Please.

695
01:04:43,322 --> 01:04:46,242
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

696
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:54,250
I need a tux, a cloak with a hood
and a mask.

697
01:04:54,709 --> 01:04:57,753
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

698
01:05:01,591 --> 01:05:04,176
I think we'll find something for you.

699
01:05:04,927 --> 01:05:06,596
Follow me, please.

700
01:05:07,138 --> 01:05:08,139
Good.

701
01:05:17,106 --> 01:05:19,275
Looks like alive, huh?

702
01:05:21,027 --> 01:05:23,029
-it's wonderful.
-Come.

703
01:05:24,071 --> 01:05:26,365
So what color cloak?

704
01:05:27,825 --> 01:05:29,535
Red, brown, red?

705
01:05:30,912 --> 01:05:31,996
Black.

706
01:05:32,204 --> 01:05:35,750
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

707
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:38,586
-I don't think so.
-Clowns, officers, pirates?

708
01:05:38,836 --> 01:05:41,464
No, just the tux, the black cloak--

709
01:05:41,672 --> 01:05:43,925
With a hood and a mask.

710
01:05:46,385 --> 01:05:47,887
May I take your coat?

711
01:05:49,764 --> 01:05:53,059
-You are medicine doctor, yes?
-Yes, I am.

712
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:57,855
-I have some problem with my hair.
-Your hair?

713
01:05:58,064 --> 01:06:00,107
It's starting to fall down too fast.

714
01:06:00,316 --> 01:06:03,235
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

715
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:05,446
Look at this. Here.

716
01:06:06,781 --> 01:06:07,907
You see?

717
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:09,784
And?

718
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,912
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

719
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,122
What? You can't help me?

720
01:06:15,331 --> 01:06:18,918
No. You should see a trichologist.
it's a hair specialist.

721
01:06:19,126 --> 01:06:22,755
Mr. Milich, I've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

722
01:06:22,964 --> 01:06:24,674
So if you don't mind--

723
01:06:24,882 --> 01:06:26,968
I'm in hurry too, to get back to bed.

724
01:06:27,176 --> 01:06:28,469
I understand.

725
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,055
So black cloak?

726
01:06:35,977 --> 01:06:37,395
Did you hear something?

727
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,275
What is this?

728
01:06:51,993 --> 01:06:53,786
What is it?

729
01:06:58,874 --> 01:07:00,835
What is this?

730
01:07:14,557 --> 01:07:17,226
What on earth is going on here?!

731
01:07:17,435 --> 01:07:19,562
Milich, I can explain everything.

732
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:22,064
You! What are you doing here?

733
01:07:22,273 --> 01:07:24,066
I promise I'll kill you!

734
01:07:24,317 --> 01:07:28,195
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

735
01:07:28,404 --> 01:07:32,199
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?!

736
01:07:32,408 --> 01:07:36,037
Milich, are you crazy? We were
invited here by the young lady.

737
01:07:36,245 --> 01:07:40,625
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

738
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:43,628
-You will have to explain to police!
-To the police?!

739
01:07:43,836 --> 01:07:46,672
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

740
01:07:46,881 --> 01:07:50,468
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

741
01:07:50,676 --> 01:07:52,845
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

742
01:07:53,054 --> 01:07:56,974
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

743
01:07:57,224 --> 01:07:59,310
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

744
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:01,103
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

745
01:08:01,354 --> 01:08:04,148
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

746
01:08:04,398 --> 01:08:07,026
You will please stay here
until I return.

747
01:08:07,193 --> 01:08:08,819
Let us out of here!

748
01:08:08,986 --> 01:08:10,947
That's out of the question.

749
01:08:11,238 --> 01:08:14,742
Doctor, sorry.
What color did you say?

750
01:08:14,992 --> 01:08:16,535
-Black?
-Black.

751
01:08:17,245 --> 01:08:20,873
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

752
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,292
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

753
01:08:23,584 --> 01:08:24,418
Sorry.

754
01:08:25,044 --> 01:08:28,589
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

755
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:31,175
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

756
01:08:31,968 --> 01:08:34,679
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

757
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:23,746
Okay, that's $74.50.

758
01:10:24,497 --> 01:10:28,334
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

759
01:10:29,502 --> 01:10:31,045
There's 80.

760
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:34,298
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

761
01:10:36,676 --> 01:10:40,054
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

762
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:41,847
Just let the meter run.

763
01:10:42,098 --> 01:10:45,476
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

764
01:10:45,601 --> 01:10:48,271
-Okay?
-How long you gonna be?

765
01:10:48,521 --> 01:10:51,899
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 1 0 minutes.

766
01:10:53,109 --> 01:10:55,027
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

767
01:11:12,962 --> 01:11:14,297
Good evening, sir.

768
01:11:15,256 --> 01:11:16,549
Good evening.

769
01:11:17,216 --> 01:11:18,593
Can we be of any help?

770
01:11:20,261 --> 01:11:22,179
I suppose you'd like the password.

771
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:23,973
If you'd like, sir.

772
01:11:24,432 --> 01:11:25,224
Fidelio.

773
01:11:25,474 --> 01:11:28,519
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

774
01:12:08,643 --> 01:12:10,311
Good evening, sir.

775
01:12:10,561 --> 01:12:11,896
Good evening.

776
01:12:12,188 --> 01:12:13,773
Password, sir?

777
01:12:14,565 --> 01:12:15,566
Fidelio.

778
01:12:16,192 --> 01:12:17,610
Thank you, sir.

779
01:18:23,017 --> 01:18:25,895
I'm not sure what you
think you' re doing.

780
01:18:26,312 --> 01:18:28,314
But you don't belong here.

781
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:34,070
I'm sorry, but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.

782
01:18:37,448 --> 01:18:40,534
Please! Don't be foolish.

783
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,954
You must go now.

784
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:48,960
Who are you?

785
01:18:49,293 --> 01:18:51,462
It doesn't matter who I am.

786
01:18:52,088 --> 01:18:54,340
You are in great danger.

787
01:18:55,341 --> 01:18:58,094
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

788
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:05,434
Would you be so good as 
to excuse us for a moment?

789
01:22:04,363 --> 01:22:06,908
Have you been enjoying yourself?

790
01:22:08,784 --> 01:22:12,371
Well, I've had a very
interesting look around.

791
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:18,586
Do you want to go somewhere
a little more private?

792
01:22:22,048 --> 01:22:23,090
Private?

793
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:27,470
That might be a good idea.

794
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:32,475
Here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

795
01:22:34,352 --> 01:22:36,354
May I borrow him
for just a few minutes?

796
01:22:36,646 --> 01:22:39,106
I promise to bring him right back.

797
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,161
I don't think you realize
the danger you' re in now.

798
01:22:52,411 --> 01:22:54,413
You can't fool them for much longer.

799
01:22:54,664 --> 01:22:57,708
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

800
01:22:59,627 --> 01:23:01,587
Why are you telling me this?

801
01:23:01,963 --> 01:23:03,839
It doesn't matter.

802
01:23:04,215 --> 01:23:05,091
Who are you?

803
01:23:06,884 --> 01:23:11,055
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

804
01:23:12,848 --> 01:23:14,433
Will you come with me?

805
01:23:14,684 --> 01:23:16,352
That's impossible.

806
01:23:16,602 --> 01:23:17,645
Why?

807
01:23:17,812 --> 01:23:22,149
Because it would cost me my life
and possibly yours.

808
01:23:23,442 --> 01:23:25,194
Let me see your face.

809
01:23:26,821 --> 01:23:27,947
Go!

810
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:31,784
Excuse me, sir.

811
01:23:34,996 --> 01:23:38,374
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

812
01:23:39,834 --> 01:23:41,043
Yes.

813
01:23:41,252 --> 01:23:45,423
Your driver's at the front door and
would urgently like a word with you.

814
01:24:47,735 --> 01:24:51,197
Please, come forward.

815
01:25:23,521 --> 01:25:26,774
May I have the password, please?

816
01:25:29,443 --> 01:25:31,237
Fidelio.

817
01:25:31,362 --> 01:25:34,991
That's right, sir.
That is the password...

818
01:25:35,074 --> 01:25:36,909
...for admittance.

819
01:25:37,702 --> 01:25:42,623
But may I ask, what is the password
for the house?

820
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:51,173
The password for the house?

821
01:26:02,476 --> 01:26:04,061
I'm sorry...

822
01:26:10,651 --> 01:26:12,278
I seem to have...

823
01:26:13,863 --> 01:26:15,448
...forgotten it.

824
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:19,660
That's unfortunate.

825
01:26:20,494 --> 01:26:25,458
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

826
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:28,544
...or if you never knew it.

827
01:26:29,754 --> 01:26:33,799
You will kindly remove your mask.

828
01:26:54,487 --> 01:26:55,655
Now...

829
01:26:56,364 --> 01:26:57,907
...get undressed.

830
01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:07,667
Get undressed?

831
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:12,088
Remove your clothes.

832
01:27:23,599 --> 01:27:26,936
Gentlemen, please... .

833
01:27:29,772 --> 01:27:32,566
Remove your clothes.

834
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:36,612
Or would you like us to do it for you?

835
01:27:38,114 --> 01:27:39,240
Stop!

836
01:27:45,079 --> 01:27:47,915
Let him go.

837
01:27:49,834 --> 01:27:51,627
Take me!

838
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:56,674
I am ready to redeem him.

839
01:28:02,847 --> 01:28:06,517
You are ready to redeem him?

840
01:28:08,603 --> 01:28:10,104
Yes.

841
01:28:12,982 --> 01:28:16,986
Are you sure you understand
what you' re taking upon yourself...

842
01:28:17,445 --> 01:28:19,530
...in doing this?

843
01:28:28,915 --> 01:28:30,249
Very well.

844
01:28:35,421 --> 01:28:37,173
You are free.

845
01:28:39,133 --> 01:28:40,760
But I warn you...

846
01:28:41,427 --> 01:28:44,013
...if you make any further inquiries...

847
01:28:44,138 --> 01:28:48,184
...or if you say a single word
to anyone...

848
01:28:48,309 --> 01:28:51,103
...about what you have seen...

849
01:28:51,228 --> 01:28:55,733
...there will be the most
dire consequences for you...

850
01:28:56,067 --> 01:28:57,985
...and your family.

851
01:28:59,737 --> 01:29:01,822
Do you understand?

852
01:29:41,696 --> 01:29:44,240
What is going to happen to that woman?

853
01:29:45,074 --> 01:29:48,077
No one can change her fate now.

854
01:29:48,911 --> 01:29:51,706
When a promise has been made here...

855
01:29:52,582 --> 01:29:55,084
...there is no turning back.

856
01:29:56,335 --> 01:29:57,587
Go!

857
01:32:07,717 --> 01:32:09,176
It's okay.

858
01:32:10,386 --> 01:32:11,846
I'm sorry.

859
01:32:12,388 --> 01:32:16,934
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

860
01:32:17,518 --> 01:32:18,978
Oh, God.

861
01:32:20,062 --> 01:32:22,982
I just had such a horrible dream.

862
01:32:24,775 --> 01:32:26,360
What time is it?

863
01:32:26,819 --> 01:32:28,696
It's a little after 4.

864
01:32:31,407 --> 01:32:33,409
Did you just get home?

865
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:39,874
It took longer than I thought.

866
01:32:40,291 --> 01:32:42,460
You must be exhausted.

867
01:32:43,085 --> 01:32:46,464
Come on, lie down.

868
01:32:55,139 --> 01:32:56,974
What were you dreaming?

869
01:33:03,147 --> 01:33:06,025
Just these weird things.

870
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:07,818
What was it?

871
01:33:11,489 --> 01:33:14,158
It was so weird.

872
01:33:16,786 --> 01:33:18,037
Tell me.

873
01:33:39,141 --> 01:33:42,311
We were in a deserted city...

874
01:33:47,358 --> 01:33:49,819
...and our clothes were gone.

875
01:33:51,737 --> 01:33:53,656
We were naked...

876
01:33:59,161 --> 01:34:01,872
...and I was terrified...

877
01:34:06,877 --> 01:34:09,297
...and I felt ashamed.

878
01:34:10,381 --> 01:34:12,008
Oh, God...

879
01:34:16,387 --> 01:34:20,433
And I was angry because
I thought it was your fault.

880
01:34:23,019 --> 01:34:27,356
You rushed away to go
find clothes for us.

881
01:34:31,777 --> 01:34:35,740
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

882
01:34:39,994 --> 01:34:41,996
I felt wonderful.

883
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:51,172
Then I was lying
in a beautiful garden...

884
01:34:51,672 --> 01:34:54,884
...stretched out naked
in the sunlight...

885
01:34:59,805 --> 01:35:02,683
...and a man walked out of the woods.

886
01:35:06,938 --> 01:35:11,234
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

887
01:35:13,945 --> 01:35:15,780
The naval officer.

888
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:22,870
He stared at me...

889
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:30,002
...and then he just laughed.

890
01:35:32,922 --> 01:35:35,091
He just laughed at me.

891
01:35:51,357 --> 01:35:53,192
But that's not the end...

892
01:35:54,277 --> 01:35:55,486
...is it?

893
01:36:01,284 --> 01:36:03,619
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

894
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,460
It's too awful.

895
01:36:13,296 --> 01:36:15,172
It's only a dream.

896
01:36:40,656 --> 01:36:42,742
He was kissing me...

897
01:36:49,165 --> 01:36:52,001
...and then we were making love.

898
01:36:57,006 --> 01:37:00,509
Then there were all these
other people around us...

899
01:37:00,718 --> 01:37:03,554
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

900
01:37:03,763 --> 01:37:06,307
Everyone was fucking.

901
01:37:12,146 --> 01:37:13,689
And then I... .

902
01:37:16,776 --> 01:37:19,278
I was fucking other men.

903
01:37:19,987 --> 01:37:21,697
So many...

904
01:37:23,282 --> 01:37:26,118
...I don't know how many I was with.

905
01:37:29,247 --> 01:37:34,126
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

906
01:37:37,004 --> 01:37:39,882
...just fucking all these men.

907
01:37:44,345 --> 01:37:47,056
I wanted to make fun of you...

908
01:37:48,808 --> 01:37:51,227
...to laugh in your face.

909
01:37:54,522 --> 01:37:59,485
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

910
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:16,752
That must have been
when you woke me up.

911
01:39:01,005 --> 01:39:02,465
Shit!

912
01:39:39,543 --> 01:39:41,629
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

913
01:39:50,263 --> 01:39:51,514
Anything else?

914
01:39:52,807 --> 01:39:54,558
No, thank you.

915
01:40:01,357 --> 01:40:02,775
Excuse me.

916
01:40:03,776 --> 01:40:06,946
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Caf?

917
01:40:07,154 --> 01:40:10,575
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

918
01:40:15,121 --> 01:40:19,625
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

919
01:40:19,834 --> 01:40:22,795
He's playing piano
over there right now.

920
01:40:23,087 --> 01:40:24,589
Nick Nightingale?

921
01:40:25,006 --> 01:40:27,592
Sure, he comes in here.

922
01:40:30,386 --> 01:40:33,180
Look, maybe you can help me...

923
01:40:33,389 --> 01:40:37,018
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

924
01:40:38,227 --> 01:40:39,979
Do you know where he's staying?

925
01:40:43,649 --> 01:40:46,736
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

926
01:40:46,944 --> 01:40:49,322
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

927
01:40:49,614 --> 01:40:52,074
I'm actually an old friend of his.

928
01:40:53,659 --> 01:40:55,161
Well, doctor...

929
01:40:57,663 --> 01:41:01,292
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

930
01:41:04,295 --> 01:41:06,213
To be perfectly honest...

931
01:41:08,507 --> 01:41:10,259
...it's a medical matter.

932
01:41:10,676 --> 01:41:14,972
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

933
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:43,167
Excuse me.

934
01:41:44,877 --> 01:41:47,088
Hi! How can I help you?

935
01:41:47,255 --> 01:41:51,050
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

936
01:41:51,592 --> 01:41:55,221
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

937
01:41:55,471 --> 01:41:56,973
He checked out?

938
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:04,939
-Did he leave a forwarding address?
-No, I'm afraid not.

939
01:42:06,315 --> 01:42:08,150
When did he check out?

940
01:42:09,652 --> 01:42:11,612
About 5:00 this morning.

941
01:42:11,862 --> 01:42:13,197
5:00?

942
01:42:14,907 --> 01:42:16,826
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

943
01:42:16,993 --> 01:42:19,829
it is a little on the early side, yeah.

944
01:42:23,916 --> 01:42:26,794
Did you notice anything...?

945
01:42:27,169 --> 01:42:28,629
...I don't know...

946
01:42:29,297 --> 01:42:32,341
...unusual about him when he left?

947
01:42:34,343 --> 01:42:35,720
Unusual?

948
01:42:37,346 --> 01:42:39,348
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

949
01:42:40,891 --> 01:42:42,226
No, I'm an old friend of his.

950
01:42:42,476 --> 01:42:43,603
Really?

951
01:42:44,061 --> 01:42:45,521
I'm a doctor.

952
01:42:48,816 --> 01:42:53,195
-Well, Bill...?
-Sure.

953
01:42:55,573 --> 01:42:58,492
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

954
01:42:58,701 --> 01:43:02,079
...because there was something
a little strange...

955
01:43:02,246 --> 01:43:04,790
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

956
01:43:05,124 --> 01:43:07,501
Really? What was that?

957
01:43:15,676 --> 01:43:20,222
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 am...

958
01:43:20,806 --> 01:43:22,725
...with two men.

959
01:43:23,726 --> 01:43:25,394
Big guys.

960
01:43:25,978 --> 01:43:28,940
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

961
01:43:29,148 --> 01:43:32,818
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

962
01:43:33,027 --> 01:43:34,820
...if you know what I mean.

963
01:43:37,615 --> 01:43:39,075
Anyways...

964
01:43:40,409 --> 01:43:45,164
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

965
01:43:45,915 --> 01:43:50,836
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

966
01:43:51,837 --> 01:43:53,005
Scared?

967
01:43:55,758 --> 01:43:57,385
He said he wanted to check out.

968
01:43:57,593 --> 01:44:01,472
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

969
01:44:01,806 --> 01:44:05,685
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

970
01:44:06,435 --> 01:44:10,565
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

971
01:44:10,815 --> 01:44:12,483
But they saw it and took it...

972
01:44:12,733 --> 01:44:15,653
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

973
01:44:15,861 --> 01:44:20,449
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

974
01:44:21,242 --> 01:44:23,744
And then they just
took him off in a car.

975
01:44:25,079 --> 01:44:27,415
Do you have any idea where they went?

976
01:44:27,832 --> 01:44:29,709
No, not a clue.

977
01:44:41,846 --> 01:44:44,015
I certainly appreciate your help.

978
01:44:44,223 --> 01:44:45,850
Anytime, Bill.

979
01:45:21,928 --> 01:45:24,680
Oh, the good doctor!

980
01:45:26,349 --> 01:45:31,354
-Was your outfit a success?
-Yes, it was. Thank you.

981
01:45:31,896 --> 01:45:33,189
Good, good.

982
01:45:33,397 --> 01:45:38,402
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

983
01:45:40,988 --> 01:45:44,742
I think you forgot the mask.

984
01:45:46,035 --> 01:45:47,536
It's not there?

985
01:45:48,454 --> 01:45:51,040
Maybe you left it at the party?

986
01:45:56,087 --> 01:45:57,672
I don't think so.

987
01:45:59,632 --> 01:46:03,177
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

988
01:46:03,386 --> 01:46:04,387
Sure.

989
01:46:08,683 --> 01:46:10,559
Here we are.

990
01:46:12,103 --> 01:46:16,190
That was 1 50 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

991
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:19,860
...25 for the mask. Sorry... 

992
01:46:22,613 --> 01:46:24,282
Three hundred seventy-five.

993
01:46:26,867 --> 01:46:28,202
Yes, dear?

994
01:46:28,536 --> 01:46:29,996
Come, come.

995
01:46:31,205 --> 01:46:34,208
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

996
01:46:43,509 --> 01:46:46,345
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

997
01:46:47,263 --> 01:46:49,181
Goodbye, gentlemen.

998
01:46:49,473 --> 01:46:52,727
-Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
-And you too.

999
01:46:53,686 --> 01:46:55,938
Well, Dr. Harford...

1000
01:46:57,189 --> 01:46:58,774
...here is your receipt.

1001
01:47:00,109 --> 01:47:02,361
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1002
01:47:03,529 --> 01:47:05,865
...and thanks for the business.

1003
01:47:10,453 --> 01:47:13,748
Mr. Milich, last night...

1004
01:47:16,542 --> 01:47:18,961
...you were going to call the police.

1005
01:47:20,504 --> 01:47:24,592
Things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1006
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:29,764
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1007
01:47:30,389 --> 01:47:32,141
...anything at all...

1008
01:47:33,142 --> 01:47:35,686
...it needn't be a costume.

1009
01:48:03,172 --> 01:48:04,423
Come in.

1010
01:48:06,133 --> 01:48:08,886
-Tuna salad and black coffee.
-Thanks.

1011
01:48:09,929 --> 01:48:12,974
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1012
01:48:13,182 --> 01:48:18,145
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1013
01:48:18,521 --> 01:48:22,733
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not going to be able to see them.

1014
01:48:22,984 --> 01:48:26,654
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1015
01:48:26,862 --> 01:48:28,781
-...and make new appointments.
-Sure.

1016
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:33,327
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1017
01:48:33,536 --> 01:48:34,870
No problem.

1018
01:52:24,642 --> 01:52:27,311
Any calls for me?

1019
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,482
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1020
01:52:32,775 --> 01:52:35,236
-Hey, gang.
-Hi, Daddy.

1021
01:52:36,112 --> 01:52:38,072
Look, I got all these right.

1022
01:52:38,281 --> 01:52:40,283
You got all of those right?

1023
01:52:40,825 --> 01:52:42,577
Every single one of them?

1024
01:52:42,952 --> 01:52:44,245
That's good.

1025
01:52:44,453 --> 01:52:46,038
You hungry?

1026
01:52:47,123 --> 01:52:48,457
Sort of.

1027
01:52:48,666 --> 01:52:50,459
Want to eat at 7?

1028
01:52:50,668 --> 01:52:53,004
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1029
01:52:53,212 --> 01:52:57,174
I have some appointments
at the office.

1030
01:52:57,383 --> 01:52:59,427
You have to go out again tonight?

1031
01:52:59,635 --> 01:53:00,636
I'm afraid so.

1032
01:53:00,845 --> 01:53:04,348
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1033
01:53:04,974 --> 01:53:07,435
We'll see about that, okay?

1034
01:53:10,021 --> 01:53:12,106
He could be a watchdog... .

1035
01:53:12,315 --> 01:53:13,816
We'll see.

1036
01:53:14,025 --> 01:53:16,777
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1037
01:53:17,028 --> 01:53:20,615
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1038
01:53:20,823 --> 01:53:25,453
And Mike has $ 1 .75.

1039
01:53:25,661 --> 01:53:29,332
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1040
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:31,876
$0.75?

1041
01:53:33,794 --> 01:53:37,173
So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

1042
01:53:40,927 --> 01:53:44,180
""How much more"" means that
it would be a subtraction.

1043
01:53:44,388 --> 01:53:47,433
Yeah, because you're going
to be taking. Right.

1044
01:53:47,725 --> 01:53:51,020
And there were all these
other people around Us.

1045
01:53:51,395 --> 01:53:53,856
Hundreds of them, everywhere.

1046
01:53:54,357 --> 01:53:56,609
Everyone was bucking.

1047
01:53:57,526 --> 01:54:01,030
And then I...
I was bucking other men.

1048
01:54:02,406 --> 01:54:04,075
So many...

1049
01:54:04,533 --> 01:54:07,495
...I don't know how many I was with.

1050
01:55:45,009 --> 01:55:47,720
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1051
01:56:18,376 --> 01:56:19,252
What is it?

1052
01:56:19,502 --> 01:56:20,711
Domino?

1053
01:56:21,045 --> 01:56:22,922
No, she's not in.

1054
01:56:26,884 --> 01:56:29,095
Are you expecting her back soon?

1055
01:56:29,303 --> 01:56:30,805
No, I'm not.

1056
01:56:37,436 --> 01:56:40,856
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

1057
01:56:41,732 --> 01:56:43,025
Just a minute.

1058
01:56:50,074 --> 01:56:51,867
Can I say who it's from?

1059
01:56:53,369 --> 01:56:55,746
Well, just tell her it's from...

1060
01:56:56,789 --> 01:56:57,790
...Bill.

1061
01:56:58,374 --> 01:56:59,625
You're Bill?

1062
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:05,214
The Bill? You're the doctor
who was here last night?

1063
01:57:06,257 --> 01:57:08,718
Well, I suppose I am.

1064
01:57:09,051 --> 01:57:11,345
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1065
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:13,764
Did she?

1066
01:57:16,601 --> 01:57:18,603
Why don't you come in for a second?

1067
01:57:21,647 --> 01:57:22,690
Sure.

1068
01:57:43,461 --> 01:57:44,962
I'm Sally.

1069
01:57:45,713 --> 01:57:47,590
Hello, Sally.

1070
01:57:50,635 --> 01:57:55,640
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

1071
01:57:59,185 --> 01:58:01,145
I have no idea.

1072
01:58:02,063 --> 01:58:04,065
You have no idea?

1073
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:14,533
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

1074
01:58:16,786 --> 01:58:19,622
She may not even be coming back?

1075
01:58:40,351 --> 01:58:41,519
I...

1076
01:58:44,939 --> 01:58:46,065
You...?

1077
01:58:46,315 --> 01:58:50,653
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

1078
01:58:51,153 --> 01:58:52,280
Really?

1079
01:58:54,031 --> 01:58:56,867
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

1080
01:58:57,076 --> 01:59:00,371
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

1081
01:59:04,417 --> 01:59:06,711
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1082
01:59:12,341 --> 01:59:15,219
Why don't you have a seat?

1083
01:59:15,928 --> 01:59:17,680
Let's sit down.

1084
01:59:33,863 --> 01:59:38,200
-I don't quite know how to say this.
-You don't quite know how?

1085
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:46,375
Well, considering that you
were with Domino last night...

1086
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:53,341
...I think it would be only fair to you
to let you know...

1087
01:59:56,469 --> 01:59:59,764
...that she got the results
of a blood test this morning...

1088
01:59:59,972 --> 02:00:03,226
...and it was HIV-positive.

1089
02:00:14,278 --> 02:00:16,113
HIV-positive?

1090
02:00:31,545 --> 02:00:36,425
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1091
02:00:43,641 --> 02:00:46,644
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1092
02:00:59,657 --> 02:01:02,326
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1093
02:01:02,868 --> 02:01:04,787
A cup of coffee maybe?

1094
02:01:13,462 --> 02:01:14,839
No, thank you.

1095
02:01:19,635 --> 02:01:21,220
I think...

1096
02:01:22,555 --> 02:01:24,473
...maybe I'd better be going.

1097
02:03:13,416 --> 02:03:15,001
-Taxi!
-Off duty.

1098
02:05:04,819 --> 02:05:07,863
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1099
02:05:08,072 --> 02:05:09,865
I'll bring it over to you.

1100
02:05:10,074 --> 02:05:11,242
Thank you.

1101
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:52,593
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1102
02:06:52,802 --> 02:06:54,262
I'm Dr. Harford.

1103
02:06:54,512 --> 02:06:58,849
One of my patients was admitted
this morning. Miss Amanda Curran.

1104
02:06:59,058 --> 02:07:01,102
Could you please
give me her room number?

1105
02:07:01,352 --> 02:07:05,106
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

1106
02:07:05,523 --> 02:07:08,109
Curran. Amanda Curran.

1107
02:07:08,317 --> 02:07:10,486
C-U-R-R-A-N?

1108
02:07:15,074 --> 02:07:16,909
Miss Amanda Curran?

1109
02:07:17,702 --> 02:07:18,995
That's right.

1110
02:07:19,745 --> 02:07:23,207
I'm sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

1111
02:07:27,253 --> 02:07:29,130
She died this afternoon?

1112
02:07:29,505 --> 02:07:32,842
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

1113
02:07:33,301 --> 02:07:34,760
I'm sorry.

1114
02:08:22,934 --> 02:08:25,561
Because it could cost me my life...

1115
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,522
...and possibly yours.

1116
02:10:14,420 --> 02:10:16,213
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

1117
02:10:18,382 --> 02:10:19,675
Tonight?

1118
02:10:20,384 --> 02:10:22,511
No, no, that's okay.

1119
02:10:26,599 --> 02:10:29,602
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

1120
02:10:53,251 --> 02:10:54,543
Come in.

1121
02:10:56,587 --> 02:11:00,299
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

1122
02:11:00,591 --> 02:11:03,302
-Let me have your coat.
-I was out anyway. Thank you.

1123
02:11:03,511 --> 02:11:04,929
How about a drink?

1124
02:11:05,471 --> 02:11:07,348
-Are you having one?
-Sure.

1125
02:11:07,807 --> 02:11:09,225
What would you like?

1126
02:11:09,684 --> 02:11:10,977
Just a little scotch.

1127
02:11:11,185 --> 02:11:12,228
Good.

1128
02:11:14,230 --> 02:11:15,398
How do you take it? Neat?

1129
02:11:15,606 --> 02:11:16,732
Please.

1130
02:11:18,484 --> 02:11:20,653
That was a terrific party
the other night.

1131
02:11:20,861 --> 02:11:24,657
-Alice and I had a wonderful time.
-Well, good.

1132
02:11:25,616 --> 02:11:27,410
It was great seeing you both.

1133
02:11:27,618 --> 02:11:29,078
Cheers.

1134
02:11:29,787 --> 02:11:31,205
Were you playing?

1135
02:11:31,664 --> 02:11:34,959
No, I was just
knocking a few balls around.

1136
02:11:36,210 --> 02:11:38,921
-Beautiful scotch.
-That's a 25-year-old.

1137
02:11:39,171 --> 02:11:41,632
-I'll send you over a case.
-No, please.

1138
02:11:41,841 --> 02:11:42,842
Why not?

1139
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,472
You feel like playing?

1140
02:11:48,681 --> 02:11:52,018
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

1141
02:11:54,562 --> 02:11:56,022
I was just... 

1142
02:11:58,816 --> 02:11:59,942
Listen... 

1143
02:12:06,532 --> 02:12:11,495
The reason I asked you
to come over is...

1144
02:12:13,414 --> 02:12:15,833
...I need to talk to you
about something.

1145
02:12:16,709 --> 02:12:17,960
Sure.

1146
02:12:21,172 --> 02:12:22,798
It's a little bit awkward.

1147
02:12:25,468 --> 02:12:28,346
And I have to be completely frank.

1148
02:12:30,556 --> 02:12:32,600
What kind of problem are you having?

1149
02:12:37,230 --> 02:12:39,315
It isn't a medical problem.

1150
02:12:45,029 --> 02:12:46,405
Actually...

1151
02:12:48,324 --> 02:12:50,243
...it concerns you.

1152
02:13:03,297 --> 02:13:06,342
I know what happened last night.

1153
02:13:10,346 --> 02:13:13,975
And I know what's been
going on since then.

1154
02:13:18,646 --> 02:13:21,983
And I think you just might...

1155
02:13:23,401 --> 02:13:26,821
...have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

1156
02:13:40,126 --> 02:13:42,587
I'm sorry, Victor, I... .

1157
02:13:44,589 --> 02:13:47,800
What in the hell
are you talking about?

1158
02:13:49,927 --> 02:13:52,597
Please, Bill, no games.

1159
02:13:54,765 --> 02:13:56,225
I was there.

1160
02:13:58,185 --> 02:13:59,729
At the house.

1161
02:14:03,316 --> 02:14:06,402
I saw everything that went on.

1162
02:14:18,289 --> 02:14:22,251
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1163
02:14:25,922 --> 02:14:29,258
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1164
02:14:30,426 --> 02:14:32,094
...how you'd heard about it...

1165
02:14:32,303 --> 02:14:35,932
...let alone got yourself
through the door.

1166
02:14:39,769 --> 02:14:44,732
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

1167
02:14:44,941 --> 02:14:48,194
...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1168
02:14:49,153 --> 02:14:52,156
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1169
02:14:56,619 --> 02:14:58,454
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1170
02:15:00,248 --> 02:15:01,791
It was mine.

1171
02:15:02,250 --> 02:15:04,252
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1172
02:15:04,627 --> 02:15:08,130
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1173
02:15:08,339 --> 02:15:11,050
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

1174
02:15:11,259 --> 02:15:14,220
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

1175
02:15:21,894 --> 02:15:23,813
What can I say?

1176
02:15:30,152 --> 02:15:31,487
I had...

1177
02:15:32,989 --> 02:15:34,574
...absolutely...

1178
02:15:35,491 --> 02:15:40,162
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

1179
02:15:41,581 --> 02:15:43,666
I know you didn't, Bill.

1180
02:15:45,585 --> 02:15:47,628
But I also know that you... .

1181
02:15:48,629 --> 02:15:51,215
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

1182
02:15:51,465 --> 02:15:53,217
...and talked to the desk clerk.

1183
02:15:54,802 --> 02:15:56,429
How do you know that?

1184
02:15:58,431 --> 02:16:00,474
Because I had you followed.

1185
02:16:06,397 --> 02:16:08,107
You had me followed?

1186
02:16:10,484 --> 02:16:12,695
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1187
02:16:13,195 --> 02:16:15,114
All right? I owe you an apology.

1188
02:16:15,323 --> 02:16:17,992
This was for your own good, believe me.

1189
02:16:18,409 --> 02:16:22,371
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1190
02:16:22,663 --> 02:16:25,917
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1191
02:16:26,208 --> 02:16:29,921
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1192
02:16:30,588 --> 02:16:32,465
...banging Mrs. Nick.

1193
02:16:33,758 --> 02:16:37,094
The clerk said he had 
a bruise on his face.

1194
02:16:39,055 --> 02:16:42,391
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1195
02:16:43,434 --> 02:16:46,354
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1196
02:16:47,271 --> 02:16:51,400
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1197
02:16:52,735 --> 02:16:54,820
Who do you think those people were?

1198
02:16:55,488 --> 02:16:57,740
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1199
02:16:57,865 --> 02:17:01,285
If I told you their names--
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1200
02:17:01,452 --> 02:17:05,164
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1201
02:17:08,876 --> 02:17:11,003
Was it the second password?

1202
02:17:12,338 --> 02:17:14,131
Is that what gave me away?

1203
02:17:16,175 --> 02:17:18,427
Yes, finally.

1204
02:17:20,513 --> 02:17:22,765
But not because you didn't know it.

1205
02:17:24,767 --> 02:17:27,770
It's because there was
no second password.

1206
02:17:28,896 --> 02:17:33,401
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1207
02:17:33,651 --> 02:17:36,153
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1208
02:17:36,279 --> 02:17:39,991
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1209
02:17:40,283 --> 02:17:43,452
...made out to you-know-who.

1210
02:18:01,053 --> 02:18:04,640
There was a woman there...

1211
02:18:10,479 --> 02:18:12,189
...who tried to warn me.

1212
02:18:17,904 --> 02:18:19,071
I know.

1213
02:18:24,911 --> 02:18:26,621
Do you know who she was?

1214
02:18:40,676 --> 02:18:42,386
She was a hooker.

1215
02:18:51,938 --> 02:18:53,648
Sorry, but...

1216
02:18:54,732 --> 02:18:56,692
...that's what she was.

1217
02:19:01,197 --> 02:19:02,406
A hooker.

1218
02:19:17,088 --> 02:19:19,632
Suppose I told you...

1219
02:19:21,342 --> 02:19:24,262
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1220
02:19:25,805 --> 02:19:29,809
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1221
02:19:30,101 --> 02:19:32,853
...her last-minute intervention...

1222
02:19:32,979 --> 02:19:36,816
...suppose I said that all of that...

1223
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:40,945
...was staged.

1224
02:19:43,072 --> 02:19:46,909
That it was a kind of charade.

1225
02:19:48,494 --> 02:19:50,329
That it was fake.

1226
02:19:55,001 --> 02:19:56,294
Fake?

1227
02:19:58,170 --> 02:20:00,673
Yes. Fake.

1228
02:20:12,184 --> 02:20:14,186
Why would they do that?

1229
02:20:14,979 --> 02:20:16,314
Why?

1230
02:20:17,481 --> 02:20:19,233
In plain words...

1231
02:20:20,151 --> 02:20:22,653
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1232
02:20:23,863 --> 02:20:27,158
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1233
02:20:27,825 --> 02:20:29,410
...and what you'd seen.

1234
02:20:49,555 --> 02:20:51,140
Have you seen this?

1235
02:21:08,491 --> 02:21:10,576
Yes, I have.

1236
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:19,085
I saw her body in the morgue.

1237
02:21:27,969 --> 02:21:31,138
Was she the woman at the party?

1238
02:21:43,484 --> 02:21:44,777
She was.

1239
02:21:59,083 --> 02:22:01,752
The woman lying dead in the morgue...

1240
02:22:03,754 --> 02:22:05,590
...was the woman at the party.

1241
02:22:14,348 --> 02:22:19,228
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1242
02:22:20,021 --> 02:22:23,608
You called it a fake, a charade.

1243
02:22:25,192 --> 02:22:28,487
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1244
02:22:28,863 --> 02:22:32,700
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1245
02:22:38,581 --> 02:22:43,210
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1246
02:22:43,336 --> 02:22:46,255
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1247
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:49,967
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1248
02:22:51,177 --> 02:22:54,722
That whole play-acted,
""take me"" phony sacrifice...

1249
02:22:55,014 --> 02:22:59,644
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1250
02:22:59,894 --> 02:23:03,481
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1251
02:23:03,731 --> 02:23:06,651
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1252
02:23:08,110 --> 02:23:12,615
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1253
02:23:13,241 --> 02:23:14,867
...and the rest is in the paper.

1254
02:23:14,992 --> 02:23:18,704
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1255
02:23:18,996 --> 02:23:23,209
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1256
02:23:24,669 --> 02:23:29,590
Come on. it was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1257
02:23:29,966 --> 02:23:31,551
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1258
02:23:31,676 --> 02:23:35,680
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1259
02:23:52,613 --> 02:23:56,742
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1260
02:23:57,118 --> 02:23:59,787
Someone died. it happens all the time.

1261
02:24:01,247 --> 02:24:03,624
But life goes on.

1262
02:24:03,874 --> 02:24:05,459
It always does...

1263
02:24:05,585 --> 02:24:07,044
...until it doesn't.

1264
02:24:08,796 --> 02:24:10,631
But you know that, don't you?

1265
02:27:35,294 --> 02:27:37,797
I'll tell you everything.

1266
02:27:43,094 --> 02:27:45,471
I'll tell you everything.

1267
02:28:37,273 --> 02:28:39,525
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1268
02:28:56,500 --> 02:29:00,713
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1269
02:29:25,488 --> 02:29:26,656
That's nice.

1270
02:29:26,822 --> 02:29:29,325
I could put Sabrina in here.

1271
02:29:30,117 --> 02:29:32,662
It's really pretty.

1272
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:34,789
It's old-fashioned.

1273
02:29:44,006 --> 02:29:45,091
He's big.

1274
02:29:45,466 --> 02:29:48,803
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1275
02:29:48,928 --> 02:29:50,263
You do?

1276
02:29:52,515 --> 02:29:54,767
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1277
02:30:09,031 --> 02:30:11,075
What do you think we should do?

1278
02:30:16,247 --> 02:30:17,540
What do I think we should do?

1279
02:30:17,957 --> 02:30:19,166
Look, Mommy!

1280
02:30:28,551 --> 02:30:31,220
What do I think?
I don't know.

1281
02:30:33,306 --> 02:30:35,182
I mean, maybe... 

1282
02:30:47,236 --> 02:30:50,656
Maybe I think...

1283
02:30:51,324 --> 02:30:53,701
...we should be grateful.

1284
02:30:59,665 --> 02:31:01,292
Grateful...

1285
02:31:01,792 --> 02:31:06,923
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1286
02:31:07,757 --> 02:31:09,342
...adventures...

1287
02:31:11,886 --> 02:31:14,263
...whether they were real...

1288
02:31:14,639 --> 02:31:16,891
...or only a dream.

1289
02:31:26,317 --> 02:31:30,154
Are you sure of that?

1290
02:31:34,075 --> 02:31:35,701
Am I sure?

1291
02:31:51,467 --> 02:31:53,177
Only as sure as I am...

1292
02:31:53,469 --> 02:31:57,306
...that the reality of one night...

1293
02:31:58,641 --> 02:32:01,394
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1294
02:32:03,938 --> 02:32:06,440
...can ever be the whole truth.

1295
02:32:13,197 --> 02:32:15,199
And no dream is ever...

1296
02:32:17,034 --> 02:32:18,744
...just a dream.

1297
02:32:27,336 --> 02:32:29,338
The important thing is...

1298
02:32:31,257 --> 02:32:32,925
...we're awake now...

1299
02:32:34,343 --> 02:32:36,637
...and hopefully...

1300
02:32:39,682 --> 02:32:41,934
...for a long time to come.

1301
02:32:45,563 --> 02:32:47,106
Forever.

1302
02:32:49,233 --> 02:32:50,693
Forever?

1303
02:32:53,070 --> 02:32:54,530
Forever.

1304
02:32:56,908 --> 02:33:00,536
Let's not use that word. You know?

1305
02:33:01,829 --> 02:33:03,789
It frightens me.

1306
02:33:14,133 --> 02:33:17,261
But I do love you...

1307
02:33:20,348 --> 02:33:21,933
...and you know...

1308
02:33:23,184 --> 02:33:25,394
...there is something very important...

1309
02:33:25,519 --> 02:33:28,314
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1310
02:33:29,482 --> 02:33:30,942
What's that?

1311
02:33:33,986 --> 02:33:35,446
Fuck.
