你呢?  還是在當醫生嗎?
How about you? You still in the doctor business?

78
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,850
你也知道他們是怎麼說的  "一日為醫  終生為醫"
You know what they say, "Once a doctor, always a doctor."

79
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,350
沒錯  我的案例是  "從未行醫  終生非醫"
Yes, or in my case, "Never a doctor, never a doctor."

把眼睛都哭瞎了...
crying his eyes out...

98
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,860
最後被流放到寒冷北方?
in some place with a very bad climate?

99

喔  真可悲

104
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,130
不過我想  他應該不介意我們共舞
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man who wouldn't mind if we danced.

105
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,100
妳是做什麼的  艾莉絲?

妳是個美麗的女人...
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

為什麼不呢?

122

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,370
有時我就是這種英雄
Well, that is the kind of hero I can be sometimes.

137
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,460
妳知道從前女人為何結婚嗎?
You know why women used to get married, don't you?

138
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,170
何不由你來告訴我呢?
Why don't you tell me?

139
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,920
這是她們唯一能失去童貞的方法...
It was the only way they could lose their virginity...

140
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,930
然後才能夠跟其他男人做想做的事
and be free to do what they wanted with other men.

141
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,180
她們真正想要的男人
The ones they really wanted.

142
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,770
真有意思
Fascinating.

143
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,570
你知道醫生為什麼迷人嗎?
Do you know what's so nice about doctors?

144
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,620
其實不如外界想像得好
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

145
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,040
他們看起來總是...
They always seem so...

146
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,460
學識淵博
knowledgeable.

147
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,340
喔  非常學識淵博...
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

148
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,380
在所有的事情上
about all sorts of things.

149
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,470
不過我想他們工作太認真了
But I bet they work too hard.

150
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,810
錯過了那麼多樂趣
Just think of all they miss.

151
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,060
妳說的可能沒錯
You're probably right.

152
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,860
女士們  我們到底要去哪兒?
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

153
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,070
說真的?
Exactly?

154
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,990
彩虹的盡頭
Where the rainbow ends.

155
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,530
彩虹的盡頭?
Where the rainbow ends?

156
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,160
難道你不想去彩虹的盡頭?
Don't you wanna go where the rainbow ends?

157
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,500
那要看在哪裡而定
Now that depends where that is.

158
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,380
讓我們一起去探索吧
Well, let's find out.

159
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,420
抱歉  女士們  哈福醫生  打擾一下
Excuse me, ladies. Sorry, Dr. Harford.

160
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,920
可以跟我來一下嗎?  紀格勒先生有事找你
Could you come with me for a moment? Something for Mr. Ziegler.

161
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,430
好吧
Fine.

162
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,600
待會兒再繼續?
To be continued?

163
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,870
來了
Yeah.

164
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,500
比爾  謝謝你過來
Bill, thanks for coming.

165
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,340
我們有點小意外
We had a little accident here.

166
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,130
怎麼了?
What happened?

167
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,590
她...
Well, she was...

168
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,260
她打了一針  就倒下去了
She was shooting up and she had a bad reaction.

169
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,220
她注射了什麼?
What did she take?

170
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,730
高速球還是雪球什麼的
A speedball or a snowball or whatever the hell they call it.

171
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,810
就是海洛英加古柯鹼
It's heroin and coke.

172
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,780
海洛英加古柯鹼?
Heroin and coke?

173
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,570
還有別的嗎?
Anything else?

174
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,490
我們還喝了幾杯香檳  就這樣了
We had a couple of drinks, some champagne. That was it.

175
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,660
她這樣有多久了?
How long has she been like this?

176
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,370
大概有五六分鐘吧  我想
Maybe five minutes, six minutes, something like that.

177
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,710
她叫什麼名字?
What's her name?

178
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,920

妳聽得到我嗎  曼蒂?
Can you hear me, Mandy?

182

Can you open your eyes for me? Mandy, can you do that?

看著我  看著我  曼蒂
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

214
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,180

妳這次沒事
You're gonna be okay this time.

216
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,070
不過妳不能繼續這樣做
But you can't keep doing this.

217
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,280
懂嗎?
You understand?

218
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,110
明白

223
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,150
這一切就交給你了
I'll leave the rest to you.

224
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,060
她可以穿上衣服離開了嗎?
Is it okay if I dress her and get her out of here?

225
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,980
不行  我會再觀察她一個小時
No, I'd keep her here for another hour.

226
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,690
再一個小時?
Another hour?

227
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,490
然後再派人帶她回家
Then I'd have someone take her home.

228
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,740
好的

00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,300
我知道我不必多說...
I know I don't have to mention this...

234
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,430
你也知道這是我倆的祕密

235
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,180

I think I have to go and find my husband now.

239
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,140
不過我想他一個人應該也沒問題
But I'm sure he'll be all right on his own a little longer.

240
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,060
沒錯...
Yes...

241
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,060
不過我呢?

我真的該走了  我得走了
I really have to go. I have to go.

245
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,410
妳知道妳不必走
You don't, you know.

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,790
你...
Did you...

278
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,160
是否...
by any chance...

279
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,830
有機會...
happen to...

280
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,300
上她們?
fuck them?

281
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,260
什麼?
What?

282
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,890
妳在說什麼啊?
What are you talking about?

283
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,560
我說的是那兩個...
I'm talking about the two girls...

284
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,730
你哈得不得了的女孩
that you were so blatantly hitting on.

285
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,450
我對她們沒有興趣
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

286
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,490
她們是誰?
Who were they?

287
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,460
只是兩個模特兒
They were just a couple of models.

288
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:34,050
還有你為什麼跟她們一起消失這麼久?
And where did you disappear to with them for so long?

289
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,260
等等
Wait a minute.

290
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,560
我沒有跟誰一起消失
I didn't disappear with anybody.

291
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,070
紀格勒身體不舒服...
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

292
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,740
我被叫上樓去看他
and I got called upstairs to see him.

293
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,540
那妳自己又在跟誰跳舞?
Anyway, who was the guy you were dancing with?

294
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,590
紀格勒夫婦的朋友
A friend of the Zieglers.

295
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,670
他想要什麼?
What did he want?

296
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,970
他想要什麼?
What did he want?

297
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
他想要什麼?
What did he want?

298
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,310
去樓上...
Sex...

299
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,270
做愛
upstairs.

300
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,230
當時當地
Then and there.

301
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,240
就這樣?
Is that all?

302
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,160
對  就這樣
Yeah, that was all.

303
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,120
只是想要上我老婆
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

304
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,960
沒錯
That's right.

305
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,630
我可以理解
Well, I guess that's understandable.

306
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,800
可以理解?
Understandable?

307
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,800
因為妳是個...
Because you are a very...

308
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,060
非常美麗的女人
very beautiful woman.

309
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,520
等等
Wait. So...

310
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,190
只因為我是個美麗的女人...
because I'm a beautiful woman...

311
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,700
所以男人願意跟我說話...
the only reason any man ever wants to talk to me...

312
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,910
只是因為他想上我  你是這個意思?
is because he wants to fuck me. Is that what you're saying?

313
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,330
我想事情不像妳說的那麼簡單...
Well, I don't think it's quite that black and white...

314
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:36,380
不過我們都知道男人是什麼德行
but I think we both know what men are like.

315
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,390
所以基本上...
So on that basis...

316
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,520
我也可以假設你想搞那兩個模特兒
I should conclude that you wanted to fuck those two models.

317
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,520
我是例外
There are exceptions.

318
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,110
為什麼你是例外?
And what makes you an exception?

319
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,530
我是例外  因為...
What makes me an exception is that...

320
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,160
我剛好很愛妳
I happen to be in love with you.

321
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,870
因為我們已經結婚了...
And because we're married...

322
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,340
而且我絕不會對妳說謊...
and because I would never lie to you...

323
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,590
或傷害妳
or hurt you.

324
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,390
所以你的意思是...
Do you realize that what you're saying...

325
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,900
你不上那兩個模特兒的原因...
is that the only reason you wouldn't fuck those models...

326
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,730
是為了我著想?
is out of consideration for me?

327
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,980
而不是因為你不想
Not because you really wouldn't want to.

328
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,110
放輕鬆  艾莉絲
Let's just relax, Alice.

329
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,910
大麻讓妳容易激動
This pot is making you aggressive.

330
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,540
不  不是大麻  是你
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

331
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,370
你為什麼就不能給我一個直接的答案呢?
Why can't you ever give me a straight fucking answer?

332
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,170
我以為我給的就是直接答案啊
I was under the impression that's what I was doing.

333
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,590
我已經搞不清楚我們在吵什麼了
I don't even know what we're arguing about here.

334
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,010
我不是在吵架
I'm not arguing.

335
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,260
我只是想知道你話裡的涵意
I'm just trying to find out where you're coming from.

336
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,220
我話裡的涵意?
Where I'm coming from?

337
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,570
假設...
Let's say--

338
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:14,400
假設來說好了  有個大美女...
Let's say, for example, you have some gorgeous woman...

339
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,730
裸體站在你辦公室裡...
standing in your office naked...

340
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,610
你正在摸她的乳房
and you're feeling her fucking tits.

341
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,610
我想知道的是...
Now, what I wanna know...

342
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,790
我想知道當你抓著乳房時  你在想什麼
I wanna know what you're thinking about when you're squeezing them.

343
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,170
艾莉絲  我是個醫生
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

344
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,960
這非常公事化...
It's all very impersonal...

345
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,760
而且旁邊一定有護士
and you know there's always a nurse present.

346
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,140
你是說  當你摸她的乳房時  你想的只有你的專業態度?
So when you're feeling tits, it's nothing more than your professionalism?

347
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,430
沒錯
Exactly.

348
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,180
當我幫病人看診時  我絕對不會想到性
Sex is the last thing on my mind when I'm with a patient.

349
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,610
那當她的小乳頭被你擠弄時...
Now, when she is having her little titties squeezed...

350
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,110
難道你不認為她可能正幻想著...
do you think she ever has fantasies...

351
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,610
英俊比爾醫生的小弟弟長什麼樣嗎?
about what handsome Dr. Bill's dickie might be like?

352
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,990
拜託  我可以向妳保證  這個他媽的虛構女病人...
Come on, I can assure you sex is the last thing...

353
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,420
心裡想的絕對不可能是性
on this fucking hypothetical woman patient's mind.

354
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,580
你為什麼這麼肯定?
And what makes you so sure?

355
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,630
如果沒有其他原因...
If for no better reason...

356
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,140
她可能只是害怕我將要告訴她的診斷
because she's afraid of what I might find.

357
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,860
好吧
Okay, okay.

358
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,810
那當你告訴她一切都沒事以後  接下來呢?
So after you tell her that everything's fine, what then?

359
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,230
接下來怎樣?
What then?

360
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,860
我不知道  艾莉絲...
I don't know, Alice...

361
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,690
接下來怎樣?
What then?

362
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,990
聽著
Look,

363
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,530
女人不會...
women don't...

364
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,240
女人基本上不會有那種想法
They basically just don't think like that.

365
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,080
百萬年的進化  是嗎?
Millions of years of evolution, right?

366
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,670
是嗎?
Right?

367
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,420
男人就得到處找洞插...
Men have to stick it every place they can...

368
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,840
而女人呢  只關心安全跟承諾...
but for women, it is just about security and commitment...

369
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,300
還有其他什麼鬼的
and whatever the fuck else!

370
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,260
有點過於簡化  艾莉絲  不過大概就是那樣
A little oversimplified, Alice. But yes, something like that.

371
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,440
你們男人真是搞不懂
If you men only knew.

372
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:21,900
我知道妳只是頭腦發昏  想要跟我吵架...
What I do know is you got stoned, you tried to pick a fight...

373
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,240
而現在妳又想讓我嫉妒
and now you're trying to make me jealous.

374
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,570
不過你不是會嫉妒的類型  對吧?
But you're not the jealous type, are you?

375
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,990
沒錯  我不是
No, I'm not.

376
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,280
你從來不會為我感到嫉妒  對吧?
You've never been jealous about me, have you?

377
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,490
沒錯  從來沒有
No, I haven't.

378
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,160
那你為什麼從沒為我感到嫉妒過?
And why haven't you ever been jealous about me?

379
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,380
我不知道  艾莉絲  也許因為妳是我老婆
Well, I don't know, Alice. Maybe because you're my wife.

380
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,920
也許因為妳是我孩子的母親...
Maybe because you're the mother of my child...

381
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,920
我知道妳絕不會對我不忠
and I know you would never be unfaithful to me.

382
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,430
你對你自己真是有信心啊...
You are very, very sure of yourself...

383
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,970
不是嗎?
aren't you?

384
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,600
不
No.

385
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,140
我是對妳有信心
I'm sure of you.

386
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,280
妳覺得很好笑嗎?
Do you think that's funny?

387
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,000
好吧  去他的
All right. Fuck it.

388
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,590
現在我們開始笑了嗎?
Now we get the fucking laughing fit, right?

389
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,470
你...
Do you...?

390
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,310
你還記得去年夏天在鱈角嗎?
Do you remember last summer at Cape Cod?

391
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
記得
Yes.

392
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,370
你還記得有天晚上在餐廳...
Do you remember one night in the dining room...

393
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,740
有個年輕的海軍軍官...
there was this young naval officer...

394
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,500
他跟其他兩位軍官坐在我們隔壁桌?
and he was sitting near our table with two other officers?

395
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,080
不記得
No.

396
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,920
服務生給他捎來一張紙條  他就離開了
The waiter brought him a message, at which point he left.

397
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,800
完全沒印象嗎?
Nothing rings a bell?

398
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
沒有
No.

399
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,770
嗯...
Well...

400
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,770
我那天早上在大廳第一次見到他
I first saw him that morning in the lobby.

401
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,190
他剛要登記進旅館...
He was checking into the hotel...

402
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,950
他跟著拉著行李的門僮...
and he was following the bellboy with his luggage...

403
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,620
走向電梯
to the elevator.

404
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,580
他看了我一眼  然後走過去  只是一眼
He glanced at me as he walked past. Just a glance.

405
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,550
就這樣
Nothing more.

406
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,060
但我幾乎...
But I could hardly...

407
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,230
動彈不得
move.

408
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,490
那天下午...
That afternoon...

409
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,830
女兒海蓮娜跟她的朋友去看電影...
Helena went to the movies with her friend...

410
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,830
而你跟我則在做愛
and you and I made love.

411
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:33,260
我們為未來做了計畫...
And we made plans about our future...

412
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,430
還談到了女兒海蓮娜
and we talked about Helena.

413
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,850
不過...
And yet...

414
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,640
我從頭到尾...
at no time...

415
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,610
想的只有...
was he ever...

416
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,610
他
out of my mind.

417
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:04,960
我想如果他要我...
And I thought if he wanted me...

418
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,290
即使只是...
even if it was only...

419
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,760
一夜情...
for one night...

420
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,760
我也願意放棄一切
I was ready to give up everything:

421
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,810
你
You...

422
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,980
海蓮娜
Helena...

423
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,320
我他媽的未來
my whole fucking future.

424
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,160
一切
Everything.

425
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,080
實在很奇怪  因為在那個時候...
And yet it was weird, because at the same time...

426
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,000
對我來說  沒有什麼比你來得重要
you were dearer to me than ever.

427
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,590
在當時  我對你的愛...
And at that moment, my love for you...

428
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,520
是既溫柔...
was both...

429
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,980
又悲傷
tender and sad.

430
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,540
我當晚幾乎睡不著...
I barely slept that night...

431
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,790
我第二天早上醒來  感到驚恐
and I woke up the next morning in a panic.

432
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,920
我不知道我是擔心他已經離開...
I didn't know whether I was afraid that he had left...

433
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,760
還是擔心他還在那兒
or that he might still be there.

434
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,350
但到了晚餐時間...
But by dinner...

435
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,820
我才知道他已經走了...
I realized he was gone...

436
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,410
我感到...
and I was...

437
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,450
鬆了一口氣
relieved.

438
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,730
喂?
Hello.

439
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,280
是  我是哈福醫生
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

440
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,370
什麼時候發生的?
When did it happen?

441
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,600
不  不用了
No, no.

442
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,100
我知道地址
I have the address.

443
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,960
謝謝
Thank you.

444
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,800
路·耐森剛剛去世
Lou Nathanson just died.

445
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,360
我得去一趟  露個面
I think I have to go over there and show my face.

446
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,040
- 妳好  羅莎  - 晚上好  哈福醫生
- Hello, Rosa. - Good evening, Dr. Harford.

- How is Miss Nathanson? - Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

448

瑪莉安...

451
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,200
哈福醫生...

452
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,700
你能來真好
How good of you to come.

453
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,370
我一聽到消息就趕來了
I came as soon as I got the message.

454
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,830
- 謝謝  - 我...

455
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,040
- 我很遺憾  - 謝謝
- I'm so sorry. - Thank you.

456
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,050
妳的父親...
Your father was...

457
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,010
他是個勇敢的人
He was a very brave man.

458
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,260
喔  謝謝你
Oh, thank you.

459
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,720
妳還好嗎?
How are you holding up?

460
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,730
我有點麻痺
I'm a bit numb.

461
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,060
我想我還不能接受
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

462
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,440
你要不要先坐下?
Would you like to sit down?

463
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,470
感覺很不真實
It's so unreal.

464
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,680
爹地今天過得很好
Daddy had such a good day.

465
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,400
他神智清醒  記得很多事
His mind was clear, and he remembered so many things.

466
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,610
然後他吃了一點晚餐...
Then he had a little dinner...

467
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,240
說他想睡一下
and he said he felt like taking a nap.

468
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,460
我進廚房跟羅莎說了不到半小時的話...
I went into the kitchen and talked to Rosa for half an hour at most...

469
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,920
當我走進來時  他已經...
and when I went to see how he was...

470
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,420
我以為他只是睡著了
I just thought he was asleep.

471
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,300
然後我...
Then I...

472
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,430
然後我才發現  他呼吸已經停了
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

473
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,260
瑪莉安...
Marion,

474
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,850
從妳告訴我的過程...
from what you've said...

475
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,110
我相信妳父親是在睡眠中安詳過世的
I'm sure your father died peacefully in his sleep.

476
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,030
天呐  我希望是
Oh, God, I hope so.

477
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,200
我想我擔心他去世的方式...
I think I've been more afraid of the way it was going to happen...

478
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,040
遠超過擔心他去世
than his death itself.

479
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,590
妳打電話給其他親戚了嗎?
Have you had a chance to phone any of your relatives?

480
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,220
我試著打給我在倫敦的繼母  不過她不在
I tried to call my stepmother in London, but she was out.

481
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,640
我男朋友卡爾  已經幫我連絡了一些人...
My boyfriend, Carl, is making some calls...

482
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,680
他很快就會過來

483
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,310
我想你見過卡爾幾次
I think you've met Carl here a few times.

484
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,740
是的  我記得  他是老師  對吧?
Yes, I remember him. He's a teacher, isn't he?

485
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,990
數學教授
A math professor.

486
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,700
我們即將在五月結婚
We're going to get married in May.

487
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,580
那真是好消息  恭喜

489
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:58,090
卡爾收到密西根大學的聘書

490

我們很快就會搬過去

Michigan's a beautiful state. I think you'll like it a lot.

492
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,060

493
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,900
這對妳可能是很棒的改變  瑪莉安
It really could be a wonderful change for you, Marion.

494
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,630
我的天  不...

我不想跟卡爾走
I don't want to go away with Carl.

499
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,750
瑪莉安  我想妳不知道...
Marion, I don't think you realize--

500
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,250
我懂
I do.

501
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:17,510
即使我再也見不到你  至少我也要離你近一點
Even if I'm never to see you again, I want at least to live near you.

502
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,300
瑪莉安  聽我說...
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

503
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:27,430
妳太傷心了  不知道自己在說什麼
You're very upset right now, and I don't think you realize what you're saying.

504

我們根本不熟
We barely know each other.

506
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,570
我們的對話內容僅限於妳父親的健康

507
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,490

531
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,350
聽好了  她嘴裡含著一朵紅玫瑰
Listen to this. She had a red rose in her mouth.

532
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,110
就纏著我開始跳起墨西哥艷舞
She was doing a Mexican lap dance right in my face.

533
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,690

I'm serious! I got scars on the back of my neck.

534
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,780

What team's this switch hitter playing for?

535
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,360

You wanna take a ride in this fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

540
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,380
你應該要有胸部的  你站那麼近
You should have tits, you're standing so close!

547
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,630
不  我只是在散步
No, I'm just taking a walk.

548
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,770
要不要找點樂子?
How'd you like to have a little fun?

549
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,690

556
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,620
在裡面總比外面好
It's a lot nicer in there than it is out here.

557
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,660
妳...
You...

558
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,810
妳住在這兒?
You live in there?

559
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,630
對
Yes.

560
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,970
一個人住?
By yourself?

561
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,010
不  我有個室友  不過她不在家
No. I have a roommate, but she's not home.

562
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,980
不會有事的
Hey, it's okay.

563
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,810
沒有人會打擾我們
Listen, no one will bother us.

564
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,310
沒關係  進來吧
It's okay. Come on.

565
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,150
來吧
Come on.

566
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,720
就是這兒
This is it.

567
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,390
樹還不錯
That's a nice tree.

568
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:09,400
抱歉有點亂  女傭今天休息
Sorry about the mess. Maid's day off.

569
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,580
這裡很...
It's...

570
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,540
舒適...
cozy. It's a...

571
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,880
很舒適的地方
cozy place.

572
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,420
還好啦
It's okay.

573
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,810
那麼...
So...

574
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,650
我們應該先談價錢吧?
Do you suppose we should talk about money?

575
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,910
也對
Yeah, I guess so.

576
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,700
要看你想做什麼而定
That depends on what you wanna do.

577
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,750
你想做什麼?
What do you wanna do?

578
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,750
妳推薦什麼?
Well, what do you recommend?

579

我推薦什麼?
What do I recommend?

580
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,680
嗯...
Well...

581
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,780
我寧願不要說出來
I'd rather not put it into words.

582
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,830
讓我幫你決定  怎麼樣?
How about you just leave it up to me?

583
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,080
- 我是妳的人了  - 好吧
- I'm in your hands. - Okay.

584
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,580
一百五怎樣?
And how does 150 sound?

585
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,090
非常好
Sounds wonderful.

586
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:59,970
別擔心  我不計時
Don't worry. I don't keep track of the time.

<i>If I was Italian, he'd have answered me in Italian.</i>

591
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,860
那麼...
So...

592
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,530
可以開始了嗎?
shall we?

593
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,340
抱歉
Excuse me.

594
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:32,270
喂?

喂
Hi.

596

一切都還好吧?
Hi. Is everything all right?

597
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,240
還好  我只是...
Yeah. I was...

598
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,570
我只是在想  你還要在那邊待多久?
I was just wondering if you were gonna be much longer.

599
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,120
我現在不方便說話
Listen, it's a little difficult to talk right now.

600
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,750
大概還要一點時間
It could be a while.

601
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,460
你知道要多久嗎?
Any idea how long?

602
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,720
不  我不知道
No, I don't really know.

603
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,890
我們還在等其他親戚到
We're still waiting for some relatives to arrive.

604
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:10,140
那我要去睡了

605
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,850
好的  再見
Okay. Bye-bye.

606
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,210
那是比爾醫生太太?
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

607
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,590
是的
Yes. Yes.

608
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,020
你得走了嗎?
Do you have to go?

609
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,440
我得走了嗎?
Do I have to go?

610
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,740
我想是的
I think I do.

611
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,990
你確定?
Are you sure?

612
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,370
恐怕是的
Yes, I'm afraid so.

613
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,510
不過我還是想付妳錢

妳之前說多少?  一百五?
How much did you say it was? Hundred and fifty?

對
Yeah.

616
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,850
不過說真的  不必麻煩了
But you know what? You don't have to bother about that.

617
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,520
不  沒關係
No, it's all right.

618

I'm sorry, I got here just as you were finishing your last set.

640
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
沒關係  反正今天樂團表現很差

你離家很遠呐

在東村?
In the Village?

660
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,820

你不知道?
You don't?

662
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:17,700
不  聽來也許荒謬  不過每次都在不同的地方...
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's in a different place every time...

663
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:20,740
而且之前我都只待一個小時左右
and I only get it an hour or so before.

664
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,620
- 每次都是不同的地方?  - 目前為止

老兄  我只是個鋼琴手
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

667
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,930
尼克  抱歉  是不是有什麼事我沒聽懂?
Nick, I'm sorry. Is there something I'm missing here?

668
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,770
我矇著眼睛彈
I play blindfolded.

669
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,310

我矇著眼睛彈
I play blindfolded.

671
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:55,110
你在賣關子
You're putting me on.

672
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,820
不  我是說真的
No, it's the truth.

673
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:03,450
上次的矇眼布綁得不夠緊
And the last time, the blindfold wasn't on so well.

674
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:07,540
老天
Oh, man.

675
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:12,960
比爾  我這輩子看過的怪事不少...
Bill, I have seen one or two things in my life...

676
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,050
不過我從來...
but never...

677
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,880
沒看過這種事...
never anything like this...

678
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:21,680
也沒看過那麼棒的女人
and never such women.

679
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,100
好吧
Well...

680
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,190
抱歉
Excuse me.

681

683
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,790
我知道那在哪裡
I know where that is.

684
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,320
好
Right.

685
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:57,970

Okay.

687
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,840

（費德里歐）

690
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,890
這是什麼?
What is this?

691
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,110
這是貝多芬的歌劇  對吧?
It's the name of a Beethoven opera, isn't it?

692
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,110
尼克
Nick.

693
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,570
這是暗語
It's the password.

694
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,780
暗語?
The password?

695
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:26,700
我很抱歉  必須把你丟在這兒  比爾
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry to do this to you, Bill.

696
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:31,580
我真的得走了...
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

697
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,920
尼克
Nick...

698
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:40,590
你知道我絕不可能...
you know there is no way on earth...

699
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,600
就這樣讓你走  帶我跟你去
that you are going to leave here without taking me with you.

700
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,930
- 拜託  饒了我吧  - 尼克  聽我說
- Come on, buddy, give me a break. - Nick, I'll tell you what.

701
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,390
既然我已經有了暗語
I've already got the password.

702
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:56,480
給我地址就好  我自己去...
Just give me the address. I'll go there by myself...

703
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,280
我們之間完全沒有關聯
and there won't be any connection between us whatsoever.

704
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:07,160
聽著  即使我願意...
Listen, let's just say for one second...

705
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,250
假設我願意
that I was prepared to do that.

706
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,920
你穿的衣服也不可能讓你進得去
You couldn't get in anyway in those clothes.

707
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,500
為什麼?
Why not?

708
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,220
因為所有人都穿戴著戲服跟面具
Because everyone is always costumed and masked.

709
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,760
你怎麼可能在這種時候租得到戲服跟面具?
Where the hell are you gonna get a costume at this hour?

710
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,870
謝謝  零錢不必找了
Thanks. Keep the change.

730
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,200
我完全不知道
I wasn't aware of that.

731
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,700
那你是彩虹時尚店的現任老闆囉?
Then are you the present owner of Rainbow Fashions?

732
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:16,540
對

01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,730
那麼...
Okay.

748
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,760

749
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:16,390
比租價多兩百塊?

750
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,890

黑色
Black.

768
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,680
當醫生的難道不想要色彩豐富一點的斗篷嗎?
The good doctor wouldn't like something more colorful?

769
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,560
- 我想不了  - 小丑  警察  海盜?
- I don't think so. - Clowns, officers, pirates?

770
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,430

774
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:53,030
- 你是看病的醫生  對吧?  - 對

我最近掉髮很嚴重
It's starting to fall down too fast.

777
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,210
我兩個禮拜就掉了一大堆  大部分在這裡
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair. Mostly here.

778
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:06,550

我想這恐怕不是我的領域
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

782
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,050
什麼?  你幫不了我?
What? You can't help me?

783
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,890
你應該要找髮理學家  看頭髮的專科醫生
No. You should see a trichologist. It's a hair specialist.

784
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:22,720
米里區先生  說真的  現在時間已經很晚了
Mr. Milich, I've obviously left things a bit late tonight.

- 如果你不介意...  - 我也在趕時間啊  趕回去睡覺

我了解
I understand.

787
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,980
黑斗篷  是吧?
So black cloak?

788
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,320
你有聽見什麼聲音嗎?
Did you hear something?

789
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,150
嗯
Mm.

790
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,240
那是什麼?
What is this?

791
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,300
（彩虹）

792
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,760
在搞什麼?
What is it?

793
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,800
在搞什麼?
What is this?

794
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,200
這裡到底發生了什麼鬼事?
What on earth is going on here?!

795
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,530
米里區  讓我解釋
Milich, I can explain everything.

796
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:22,030
妳  妳在這裡做什麼?
You! What are you doing here?

797
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,040
我一定要殺了妳
I promise I'll kill you!

798
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,120
還有你  難道你完全沒有羞恥心嗎?
And you! Have you no sense of decency?

799
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:32,170
兩位  難道你們完全沒有羞恥心嗎?
Gentlemen, have you no sense of decency?!

800
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,880
米里區  你瘋了嗎?
Milich, are you crazy?

801
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:36,060
是這位年輕小姐請我們來的
We were invited here by the young lady.

802
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,210
年輕小姐?  那是我女兒
Young lady? This is my daughter!

803
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,590
難道你看不出來她只是個孩子?
Couldn't you see she's a child?

804
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,600
- 你最好去跟警察解釋  - 警察?
- You will have to explain to police! - To the police?!

805
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,640
妳這小賤貨  我要殺了妳
You little whore! I kill you for this.

806
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:50,400
我發誓我會殺了妳
I promise, I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

807
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,810
請幫我把那小女孩抓住
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

808
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,940
米里區  豈有此理
Milich, this is preposterous.

809
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:56,990
這位年輕小姐邀請我們來的
The young lady invited us here.

810
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:59,280
你們看不出來她已經瘋了嗎
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

811
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:01,160
醫生  很抱歉讓你久等
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

812
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,160
各位  這已經是警察的事了
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

813
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,950
請在此等候  直到我回來
You will please stay here until I return.

814
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,830
讓我們出去
Let us out of here!

815
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,960
那是不可能的
That's out of the question.

816
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,800
醫生  不好意思  你說你要什麼顏色的?
Doctor, sorry, what color did you say?

817
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,590
- 黑色?  - 黑色
- Black? - Black.

818
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:20,840
兩位  請有點禮貌  好嗎?  安靜下來
Gentlemen, please have the goodness to be quiet for the moment!

819
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,300
難道沒看到我在招呼客人?
Couldn't you see I try to serve my customer?

820
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:24,510
對不起
Sorry.

821
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:28,600
還有妳  小賤貨  馬上去睡覺  邪惡的東西
And you, little whore, go to bed at once, you depraved creature.

822
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,230
等我招呼好這位先生  我就來好好地修理妳
I'll deal with you ater I serve this gentleman.

823
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,900
你應該穿鑲白鼬皮邊的斗篷
You should have a cloak lined with ermine.

824
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,730
（佳節愉快）

825
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,800
好  一共是七十四塊半
Okay, that's $74.50.

826
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:28,350
七十四塊半  好吧
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

827
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:31,060
這是八十塊
There's 80.

828
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:34,390
我答應多給你五十塊  對吧?
I promised you 50 bucks over the meter, right?

829
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:40,110
如果你等我  我就給你一百塊
I'll make that a hundred, if you wait for me.

830
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,860
讓計價表繼續跑
Just let the meter run.

831
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:45,450
我給你另一半鈔票  再加上計價錶的錢
I'll give you the other half plus the meter when I get back.

832
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:48,280
- 怎樣?  - 你會去多久?
- Okay? - How long you gonna be?

833
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:51,870
我不知道  也許一小時  也許十分鐘
I don't know, maybe an hour or more. But maybe only 10 minutes.

834
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,040
我把我的東西留在這兒
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

835
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,920
- 好嗎?  - 好吧
- Okay? - Okay.

836
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,310
晚上好  先生
Good evening, sir.

837
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,520
晚上好
Good evening.

838
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,520
有什麼我能為您效勞的嗎?
Can we be of any help?

839
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:22,190
我想你要的是暗語
I suppose you'd like the password.

840
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,030
是的  先生
If you'd like, sir.

841
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,360
費德里歐
Fidelio.

842
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:28,570
謝謝您  先生  我們會帶路
Thank you, sir. We'll run you up to the house.

843
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,320
晚上好  先生
Good evening, sir.

844
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:11,870
晚上好
Good evening.

845
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,740
暗語是?
Password, sir?

846
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,620
費德里歐
Fidelio.

847
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,620
謝謝
Thank you, sir.

848
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:26,030
我不知道你以為你在幹什麼
I'm not sure what you think you're doing.

849
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,280
不過你不屬於這兒
But you don't belong here.

850
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:34,080
很抱歉  不過我想妳認錯人了
I'm sorry, but I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

851
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:40,460
拜託  別傻了
Please! Don't be foolish.

852
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,920
你必須立刻離開
You must go now.

853
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,970
妳是誰?
Who are you?

854
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,390
我是誰不重要
It doesn't matter who I am.

855
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,350
你現在非常危險
You are in great danger.

856
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:58,100
趁現在還有機會快點走
You must get away while there's still a chance.

857
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,400
抱歉  能不能麻煩您讓我們單獨談談?
Would you be so good as to excuse us for a moment?

858
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,880
你玩得開心嗎?
Have you been enjoying yourself?

859
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:12,420
我到處看看  覺得很有趣
Well, I've had a very interesting look around.

860
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:18,600
你想跟我去一個更私密的地方嗎?
Do you wanna go somewhere a little more private?

861
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,060
私密?
Private?

862
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:27,480
也許是個好主意
That might be a good idea.

863
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:32,440
你在這裡啊  我到處在找你
Oh, here you are. I've been looking all over for you.

864
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,410
我可以把他借走幾分鐘嗎?
May I borrow him for just a few minutes?

865
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:39,120
我保證馬上帶他回來
I promise to bring him right back.

866
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:52,210
我想你不知道自己現在多危險
I don't think you realize the danger you're in now.

867
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:54,470
你騙不了他們多久的
You can't fool them for much longer.

868
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,640
你得在一切都太遲之前趕快離開
You've got to get away before it's too late.

869
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:01,640
妳為什麼要告訴我這些?
Why are you telling me this?

870
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,810
這不重要
It doesn't matter.

871
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,140
妳是誰?
Who are you?

872
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:11,070
你不需要知道  不過你得走了  快
You don't want to know. But you must go. Now!

873
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,440
妳能跟我來嗎?
Will you come with me?

874
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:16,400
不可能
That's impossible.

875
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:17,660
為什麼?
Why?

876
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:22,080
因為這會賠上我的生命  可能還有你的
Because it could cost me my life and possibly yours.

877
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:25,160
- 讓我看妳的臉  - 不行
- Let me see your face. - No!

878
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:27,960
快走
Go!

879
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:31,750
抱歉  先生
Excuse me, sir.

880
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,340
在外面等的計程車是您的嗎?
Are you the gentleman with the taxi waiting for him?

881
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,010
是的
Yes.

882
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:45,430
您的司機正在門口  急須跟您說話
Your driver's at the front door and would urgently like a word with you.

883
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:51,170
請向前來
Please, come forward.

884
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,700
請告訴我們暗語  好嗎?
May I have the password, please?

885
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:30,790
費德里歐
Fidelio.

886
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:36,000
沒錯  那是暗語...
That's right, sir. That is the password...

887
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:38,000
大門專用的
for admittance.

888
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,720
不過  您知道房子的暗語是什麼嗎?
But may I ask, what is the password for the house?

889
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:52,650
房子的暗語?
The password for the house?

890
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,730
是的
Yes.

891
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:05,160
很抱歉  我...
I'm sorry, I...

892
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,370
我好像...
I seem to have...

893
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,670
忘記了
forgotten it.

894
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,800
真是不巧
That's unfortunate.

895
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:26,590
因為在這裡  不論是忘記...
Because here, it doesn't matter whether you have forgotten it...

896
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:29,680
或根本不知道
or if you never knew it.

897
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:35,020
都必須卸下面具
You will kindly remove your mask.

898
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:56,790
現在...
Now...

899
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,130
請卸下衣物
get undressed.

900
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,760
卸下衣物?
Get undressed?

901
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:13,140
脫下你的衣服
Remove your clothes.

902
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:28,030
各位...
Gentlemen, please...

903
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:33,620
脫下你的衣服
Remove your clothes.

904
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:37,710
還是你要我們幫你脫?
Or would you like us to do it for you?

905
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:40,330
住手
Stop!

906
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:49,010
讓他走
Let him go.

907
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:52,720
讓我來
Take me!

908
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:57,810
我願意替他贖罪
I am ready to redeem him.

909
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:07,740
妳願意替他贖罪?
You are ready to redeem him?

910
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,200
是的
Yes.

911
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:18,210
妳知道如果這麼做...
Are you sure you understand what you're taking upon yourself...

912
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,540
妳會被怎麼處置嗎?
in doing this?

913
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,880
知道
Yes.

914
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:31,390
非常好
Very well.

915
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,310
你可以走了
You are free.

916
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:41,900
不過我警告你...
But I warn you...

917
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,110
如果你再繼續調查...
if you make any further inquiries...

918
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,320
或跟任何人提到...
or if you say a single word to anyone...

919
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:52,240
你今晚所見到的...
about what you have seen...

920
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:56,910
你跟你家人的下場...
there will be the most dire consequences for you...

921
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,160
將慘不忍睹
and your family.

922
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:03,040
你了解嗎?
Do you understand?

923
01:29:42,830 --> 01:29:45,290
那女人會被如何處置?
What is gonna happen to that woman?

924
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:49,210
沒有人能改變她的命運
No one can change her fate now.

925
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:52,800
在這裡立下的承諾...
When a promise has been made here...

926
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,220
絕不可能改變
there is no turning back.

927
01:29:57,470 --> 01:29:58,760
快走
Go!

928
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:33,130
（海蓮娜）

929
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,180
艾莉絲
Alice.

930
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,760
艾莉絲
Alice.

931
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:10,270
沒事了  沒事了
It's okay. It's okay.

932
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,940
對不起
I'm sorry.

933
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:18,030
對不起把妳吵醒  我以為妳在做惡夢
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought you were having a nightmare.

934
01:32:18,570 --> 01:32:20,070
天呐
Oh, God.

935
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,080
我做了一個可怕的夢
I just had such a horrible dream.

936
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,450
現在幾點了?
What time is it?

937
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,750
剛過四點
It's a little after 4.

938
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,500
- 你剛到家?  - 對
- Did you just get home? - Yes.

939
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:40,970
比我預期的還要久
It took longer than I thought.

940
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:43,510
你一定累壞了
You must be exhausted.

941
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:49,140
來  躺下來吧
Come on, lie down. Lie down.

942
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,990
妳夢到什麼?
What were you dreaming?

943
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,450
就是一些...
It's Just...

944
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,160
一些詭異的事
Just these weird things.

945
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:08,830
什麼事?
What was it?

946
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,250
感覺好詭異
It was so weird.

947
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,130
告訴我
Tell me.

948
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:37,730
我們...
We were...

949
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:43,450
我們在一座荒廢的城市裡...
We were in a deserted city...

950
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:50,910
我們的衣服都不見了
and our clothes were gone.

951
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,750
我們裸著身體...
We were naked...

952
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,880
我好害怕...
and I was terrified...

953
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,890
而且我...
and I...

954
01:34:07,890 --> 01:34:10,390
我又覺得羞恥
and I felt ashamed.

955
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,140
天呐...
Oh, God...

956
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:21,490
我好生氣  因為我覺得那是你的錯
And I was angry because I thought it was your fault.

957
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:28,410
你跑去幫我們找衣服
You rushed away to go find clothes for us.

958
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:36,830
你一不見  情況就不一樣了
As soon as you were gone, it was completely different.

959
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:43,090
我覺得好舒暢
I felt wonderful.

960
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:52,270
然後我躺在一座美麗的花園裡...
Then I was lying in a beautiful garden...

961
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:55,940
全身赤裸伸展在陽光下...
stretched out naked in the sunlight...

962
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,780
一個男人從樹林中走出來
and a man walked out of the woods.

963
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:12,330
就是我跟你說過的  在旅館遇見的男人
He was the man from the hotel, the one I told you about.

964
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,830
海軍軍官
The naval officer.

965
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:23,920
他看著我...
He stared at me...

966
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:31,100
然後大笑
and then he just laughed.

967
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,140
他嘲笑我
He just laughed at me.

968
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:54,240
不過還沒結束...
But that's not the end...

969
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:56,580
對吧?
is it?

970
01:35:58,370 --> 01:35:59,370
還沒結束
No.

971
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,670
為什麼不告訴我後來的情節?
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

972
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:08,180
那...
It's...

973
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:12,550
太恐怖了
It's too awful.

974
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,180
那只是一個夢
It's only a dream.

975
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,840
他吻著我...
He was kissing me...

976
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:53,050
然後我們開始做愛
and then we were making love.

977
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:01,600
我們身邊有好多人...
Then there were all these other people around us...

978
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:04,650
上百個人  到處都是
hundreds of them, everywhere.

979
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,400
大家都在亂搞
Everyone was fucking.

980
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,780
然後我...
And then I...

981
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:20,370
我開始搞其他男人
I was fucking other men.

982
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,750
好多人...
So many...

983
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:27,170
我不知道有多少
I don't know how many I was with.

984
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:35,220
你看見我躺在這些男人的臂彎裡...
And I knew you could see me in the arms of all these men...

985
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,980
操這些男人
just fucking all these men.

986
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:44,770
而我...
And I...

987
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,110
我想嘲笑你...
I wanted to make fun of you...

988
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:52,280
在你面前大笑
to laugh in your face.

989
01:37:55,620 --> 01:38:00,540
我盡全力笑你
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

990
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:17,800
那大概就是你叫醒我的時候
That must have been when you woke me up.

991
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:57,390
（奏鳴曲咖啡館）

992
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,520
該死
Shit!

993
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:31,440
（吉斯比斯咖啡館  二十四小時營業）

994
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:39,720
- 你好  - 妳好

995
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:42,720
一杯咖啡  謝謝

996

還要什麼嗎?
Anything else?

997
01:39:52,730 --> 01:39:54,480
不了  謝謝
No, thank you.

998
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:02,700
不好意思
Excuse me.

999
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:06,870
妳知道隔壁的奏鳴曲咖啡館何時開門嗎?
Do you know when they get in next door at the Sonata Café?

1000
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:10,500
- 我想通常兩三點會有人在辦公室  - 兩三點...
- I think there's usually someone in the office around 2 or 3. - 2 or 3.

1001
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:19,550
我猜妳大概不認識尼克·南丁格爾吧?
I don't suppose, by any chance, you know Nick Nightingale?

1002
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,680
他目前在那兒演奏鋼琴
He's playing piano over there right now.

1003
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:24,430
尼克·南丁格爾?
Nick Nightingale?

1004
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:27,520
當然  他常來這兒
Sure, he comes in here.

1005
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:33,110
也許妳可以幫上忙...
Look, maybe you can help me...

1006
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:36,940
因為我必須跟他聯絡上
because it's important that I get in touch with him.

1007
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:39,860
妳知道他住在哪兒嗎?
Do you know where he's staying?

1008
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:41,610
嗯...
Well...

1009
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:46,660
我想我不應該隨便把他的地址給人
I don't know if he'd want me to give out his address.

1010
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:49,210
沒關係  我是醫生
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

1011
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,960
我其實是他的老朋友
I'm actually a very old friend of his.

1012
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:55,090
呃  醫生...
Well, doctor...

1013
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:01,220
他今晚有演出  你不能等嗎?
he'll be playing there tonight. Can't it wait until then?

1014
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,020
聽著
Listen,

1015
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:06,140
說實話...
to be perfectly honest...

1016
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:10,140
是跟病情有關
it's a medical matter.

1017
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:14,900
檢驗結果  我想他會希望能趕快知道
Some tests. I know he'll wanna know about them as soon as possible.

1018
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,500
（旅館）

1019
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,130
抱歉
Excuse me.

1020
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:47,010
有什麼我能效勞的嗎?
Hi! How can I help you?

1021

可以幫我接通尼克·南丁格爾先生的房間嗎?
Can you please ring Mr. Nightingale's room for me? Nick Nightingale.

很抱歉  南丁格爾先生已經退房了
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale has already checked out.

1023
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,230
- 他退房了?  - 是的
- He checked out? - Yes.

1024
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:04,860
- 他有留下地址嗎?  - 恐怕沒有
- Did he leave a forwarding address? - No, I'm afraid not.

1025
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,030
他何時退房的?
When did he check out?

1026
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,540
大概今晨五點
About 5:00 this morning.

1027
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:13,200
- 五點?  - 對
- 5:00? - Yes.

1028
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:16,750
不會太早了嗎?
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

1029
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,710
是有點早  沒錯
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

1030
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,010
那麼...
Look...

1031
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,720
當他走時  你有沒有注意到...
did you notice anything...

1032
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:28,510
不知道...
I don't know...

1033
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:32,230
什麼不尋常的地方?
unusual about him when he left?

1034
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:35,650
不尋常?
Unusual?

1035
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:39,770
- 你該不會是條子吧?  - 不
- Hey, you're not Five-O, are you? - No.

1036
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,190
不  我是他朋友
No, I'm an old friend of his.

1037
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,490
真的?
Really?

1038
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,410
我是個醫生
I'm a doctor.

1039
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:53,120
- 可以叫你比爾嗎?  - 當然
- Well, Bill...? - Sure.

1040
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:58,420
你問這問題真是有趣  比爾...
It's funny you should ask that question, Bill...

1041
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:01,960
因為南丁格爾先生離開時...
because actually there was something a little strange...

1042
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,720
的確有些不尋常
about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

1043
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:07,430
真的嗎?  發生了什麼事?
Really? What was that?

1044
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:20,150
他大約在今晨四點半進來...
He came in this morning, about 4:30 a. m...

1045
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:22,610
跟兩個男人
with two men.

1046
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:25,360
非常壯碩
Big guys.

1047
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:28,870
他們穿著體面  談吐得體
They were very well-dressed and very well-spoken.

1048
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:32,740
不過你絕對不會想招惹他們...
But they weren't the kind of people you'd fool around with...

1049
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:34,750
你知道我意思吧
if you know what I mean.

1050
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,000
然後...
Anyways...

1051
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:45,090
我注意到南丁格爾先生臉上有塊淤青
I noticed Mr. Nightingale had a bruise on his cheek.

1052
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,720
說實話  我覺得他看起來有點害怕
To be perfectly honest, I also thought he looked a little scared.

1053
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,930
害怕?
Scared?

1054
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,180
對  對
Yes. Yes.

1055
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,310
他說他要退房
He said he wanted to check out.

1056
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:01,400
然後他跟其中一個男人上樓去
And then he went upstairs to his room with one of the men.

1057
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:05,610
另一個男人留在大廳  幫他結帳
The other guy stayed down in the lobby and settled his bill.

1058
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:10,490
當他們回來時  南丁格爾先生想塞給我一封信
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale tried to pass me an envelope.

1059
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,450
不過被發現後  他們拿走了...
But they saw it and took it...

1060
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:15,580
說如果有任何他的郵件或訊息...
and said that any mail or messages for him...

1061
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:20,330
都會有經過授權的人來幫他收件
would be collected by someone properly authorized to do so.

1062
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:23,670
然後他就被帶進車裡了
And then they just took him off in a car.

1063
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,300
你知道他們去哪裡嗎?
Do you have any idea where they went?

1064
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,630
不  完全不知道
No, not a clue.

1065
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:39,100
既然如此...
Well, anyway...

1066
01:44:41,730 --> 01:44:43,900
非常感謝你的幫助
I certainly appreciate your help.

1067
01:44:44,110 --> 01:44:45,780

Maybe you left it at the party?

1076

我想不可能
I don't think so.

1077

01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:33,520
（放棄你的追蹤調查  這是沒有用的...

1111
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:36,770
這些話是給你的第二次警告

1112
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:40,680
為了你好  這已經足夠）

1113
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:19,890
- 嗨  - 嗨  爹地

妳們好
Hi.

1115
01:52:24,570 --> 01:52:27,240
有人打電話找我嗎?
Any calls for me?

1116
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:31,370
桑德斯醫生與夏皮洛太太
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1117
01:52:32,450 --> 01:52:33,850
嗨  親愛的
Hey, gang.

1118
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,800
- 嗨  爹地  - 嗨
- Hi, Daddy. - Hey.

1119
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
你看  我全都算對了
Look, I got all these right.

1120
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:40,470
- 妳全都算對啦?  - 是呀
- You got all of those right? - Yeah.

1121
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:42,640
- 每一題嗎?  - 嗯
- Every single one of them? - Mm-hmm.

1122
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,170
真棒
That's good.

1123
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:45,920
你餓了嗎?
You hungry?

1124
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:48,380
有點
Sort of.

1125
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:50,380
七點吃飯  好嗎?
Wanna eat at 7?

1126
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:52,890
七點?  不能再早一點嗎?
Seven? Listen, can we make that earlier?

1127
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:57,060
我辦公室還有事
I have some appointments at the office.

1128
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:59,350
你晚上還要出診?
You have to go out again tonight?

1129
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:00,520
恐怕是
I'm afraid so.

1130
01:53:00,730 --> 01:53:04,270
爹地  我聖誕節禮物可以要一隻小狗嗎?
Daddy, am I gonna get a puppy for Christmas?

1131
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:07,360
我們再考慮看看  好嗎?
We'll see about that, okay?

1132
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:12,030
他可以當看門狗...
He could be a watchdog...

1133
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,700
再看看
We'll see.

1134
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:16,700
來吧  寶貝  把這題做完
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1135
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:20,540
好吧  這是喬  他有兩塊半
All right, we have Joe. And Joe has $2.50.

1136
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:25,340
麥克有一塊錢又七十五分
And Mike has $1.75.

1137
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:29,220
喬比麥克多多少錢?
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1138
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:31,800
七十五分?
$0.75?

1139
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:37,100
所以我們應該用減法還是加法?
So is it gonna be a subtraction or an addition?

1140
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:44,100
"多多少"表示我們應該要用減法
"How much more" means that it would be a subtraction.

1141
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:47,320
因為妳要拿走  對
Yeah, because you're gonna be taking... Right.

1142
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:50,900
<i>我們身邊都是人</i>
<i>And there were all these other people around us.</i>

1143
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,740
<i>上百個人  到處都是</i>
<i>Hundreds of them, everywhere.</i>

1144
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:56,490
<i>大家都在亂搞</i>
<i>Everyone was fucking.</i>

1145
01:53:57,450 --> 01:54:00,910
<i>我...  我也在搞其他男人</i>
<i>And then I... I was fucking other men.</i>

1146
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:03,920
<i>好多...</i>
<i>So many...</i>

1147
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:07,380
<i>我不知道我跟多少人搞過</i>
<i>I don't know how many I was with.</i>

1148
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:13,820
喂?
Hello.

1149
01:55:15,650 --> 01:55:17,250

1151
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:47,650
零錢留著  聖誕快樂

1152
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:20,680
- 誰啊?  - 多米諾?
- What is it? - Domino?

1153
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:22,810
她不在
No, she's not in.

1154
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:29,020
妳想她很快就會回來嗎?
Are you expecting her back soon?

1155
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:30,730
我不認為
No, I'm not.

1156
01:56:34,690 --> 01:56:35,820
好吧
Okay.

1157
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:40,780
我有東西要給她  可以交給妳嗎?
I have something for her. Can I leave this with you?

1158
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,950
等一下
Just a minute.

1159
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,790
你的大名是...?
Can I say who it's from?

1160
01:56:53,290 --> 01:56:55,670
就跟她說我是...
Well, just tell her it's from...

1161

1162
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:00,460
- 你是比爾?  - 對
- You're Bill? - Yes.

1163
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:05,140
比爾?  你是昨晚的醫生?
The Bill? You're the doctor who was here last night?

1164
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:08,600
我想沒錯
Well, I suppose I am.

1165
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:11,270
多米諾說你對她很好
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1166
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:13,650
是嗎?
Did she?

1167
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:18,530
進來坐一下吧?
Why don't you come in for a second?

1168
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:22,610

- 妳好  莎莉  - 你好
- Hello, Sally. - Hi.

1171
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:55,480
妳知道多米諾何時回來嗎?
So do you have any idea when you expect Domino back?

1172
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:58,320
不
No.

1173
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:01,030
不知道
I have no idea.

1174
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:03,990
- 妳不知道?  - 對
- You have no idea? - No.

1175
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:14,420
說實話  我想她不會回來了
To be perfectly honest, she may not even be coming back.

1176
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:19,510
她不會回來了?
She may not even be coming back?

1177
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,060
嗯  我...
Well...

1178
01:58:40,190 --> 01:58:41,440
我...
I...

1179
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:46,040
妳...?
You...?

1180
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:50,580
我想有些事我得告訴你
I think there's something that I should tell you.

1181
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,750
- 是嗎?  - 是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

1182
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,750
不過我不知道...
But I just don't know. I don't know.

1183
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:00,210
妳不知道?  那是什麼?
You don't know? Well, what is it?

1184
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:06,640
我不知道我該不該告訴你
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1185
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:15,140
先坐下來吧
Why don't you have a seat?

1186
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:17,560
我們先坐下來
Let's sit down.

1187
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:38,080
- 我不知道該怎麼說  - 妳不知道該怎麼說?
- I don't quite know how to say this. - You don't quite know how?

1188
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:46,260
如果你昨晚跟多米諾在一起...
Well, considering that you were with Domino last night...

1189
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:53,270
我想你有權知道...
I think it would be only fair to you to let you know...

1190
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:59,650
她今天早上接到了血液檢查的結果...
that she got the results of a blood test this morning...

1191
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:03,110

1195
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:46,490
那是很大的打擊
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1196
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:02,290
你要喝點什麼嗎?
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1197
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:04,710
咖啡還是...?

不了  謝謝妳
No, thank you.

1199
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,100
我想...
I think...

1200
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,400
也許我該走了
maybe I'd better be going.

1201
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:30,940
好的
Okay.

1202

1247
02:11:39,050 --> 02:11:41,560
- 我送你一箱  - 不了  謝謝
- I'll send you over a case. - No, please.

1248
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,060
- 為什麼不?  - 不用了
- Why not? - No.

1249
02:11:46,230 --> 02:11:48,350
要不要玩?
You feel like playing?

1250
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:51,900
不  謝謝  你繼續玩  我看就好
No, thanks. You go ahead, I'll watch.

1251
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:55,950
我只是...
I was just...

1252
02:11:58,740 --> 02:11:59,820
聽著...
Listen...

1253
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:02,580
比爾...
Bill...

1254
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:11,340
我請你來的原因是...
The reason I asked you to come over is...

1255
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:15,670
我有話要跟你說
I need to talk to you about something.

1256
02:12:16,590 --> 02:12:17,840
沒問題
Sure.

1257
02:12:21,010 --> 02:12:22,680
有點尷尬
It's a little bit awkward.

1258
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:28,230
我必須坦白說
And I have to be completely frank.

1259
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:32,480
你有什麼樣的問題嗎?
What kind of problem are you having?

1260
02:12:37,150 --> 02:12:39,240
不是健康問題
It isn't a medical problem.

1261
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:46,330
實際上...
Actually...

1262
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:50,170
跟你有關
it concerns you.

1263
02:12:58,840 --> 02:12:59,840
比爾...
Bill...

1264
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:06,270
我知道昨晚發生了什麼事
I know what happened last night.

1265
02:13:10,230 --> 02:13:13,860
我也知道之後發生了什麼事
And I know what's been going on since then.

1266
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:21,910
我想你大概...
And I think you just might...

1267
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:26,740
對某些事有些誤解
have the wrong idea about one or two things.

1268
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:42,510
很抱歉  維克特  我...
I'm sorry, Victor, I...

1269
02:13:44,470 --> 02:13:47,720
我搞不懂你到底在說什麼?
What in the hell are you talking about?

1270
02:13:49,850 --> 02:13:52,480
拜託  比爾  別裝了
Please, Bill, no games.

1271
02:13:54,650 --> 02:13:56,150
我也在那兒
I was there.

1272
02:13:58,110 --> 02:13:59,650
在那房子裡
At the house.

1273
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:06,280
我目睹了整個過程
I saw everything that went on.

1274
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:16,130
比爾...
Bill...

1275
02:14:18,210 --> 02:14:22,130
你以為你在搞什麼鬼啊?
What the hell did you think you were doing?

1276
02:14:24,130 --> 02:14:25,230
我根本...
I couldn't...

1277
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:29,140
我根本無法想像...
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1278
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:32,020
你是怎麼知道這回事...
how you'd even heard about it...

1279
02:14:32,230 --> 02:14:35,860
更不要說  你是怎麼通過大門的
let alone got yourself through the door.

1280
02:14:39,690 --> 02:14:44,660
然後我想起  你曾跟那該死的鋼琴手聊天...
Then I remembered seeing you with that prick piano player...

1281
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:48,120
叫尼克什麼的  管他叫啥鬼名  在我家的派對上
Nick whatever the fuck his name was, at my party.

1282
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:52,000
之後就不難推測了
And it didn't take much to figure out the rest.

1283
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:58,340
那不是尼克的錯
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1284
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:01,710
那是我的錯
It was mine.

1285
02:15:02,090 --> 02:15:04,180
那當然是尼克的錯
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1286
02:15:04,510 --> 02:15:08,050
如果他沒跟你提起  這一切都不會發生了
If he hadn't mentioned it to you, none of this would've happened.

1287
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:10,970
我把那雜種推薦給這些人...
I recommended that cocksucker to those people...

1288
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:14,140
他卻讓我顏面盡失
and he's made me look like a complete asshole.

1289
02:15:18,770 --> 02:15:19,770
維克特...
Victor...

1290
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:23,690
我能說什麼?
What can I say?

1291
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:31,410
我...
I had...

1292
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:34,500
完全...
absolutely...

1293
02:15:35,410 --> 02:15:40,040
沒想到你會被捲入這件事
no idea you were involved in any way.

1294
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:43,590
我知道你沒想到  比爾
I know you didn't, Bill.

1295
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:47,550
不過我也知道...
But I also know that you...

1296
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:51,140
你今早去了尼克的旅館...
You went to Nick's hotel this morning...

1297
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:53,140
還跟門房打探消息
and talked to the desk clerk.

1298
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:56,350
你怎麼知道?
How do you know that?

1299
02:15:58,350 --> 02:16:00,400
因為我派人跟蹤你
Because I had you followed.

1300
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:07,990
你派人跟蹤我?
You had me followed?

1301
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:12,740
好吧  我很抱歉
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1302
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,040
好嗎?  我是該向你道歉
All right? I owe you an apology.

1303
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:17,960
不過那是為你好  相信我
This was for your own good, believe me.

1304
02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:22,380
我知道門房對你說了什麼  不過他沒告訴你...
I know what the desk clerk told you. But what he didn't tell you is...

1305
02:16:22,590 --> 02:16:25,760
他們只是把尼克架上飛機送回西雅圖
all they did was put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1306
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:29,480
現在他大概已經回到家裡...
By now he's probably back with his family...

1307
02:16:29,630 --> 02:16:32,390
在操尼克太太了
you know, banging Mrs. Nick.

1308
02:16:33,810 --> 02:16:37,060
門房說他臉上有淤青
The clerk said he had a bruise on his face.

1309
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:42,320
好吧  他臉上是有淤青
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1310
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:46,360
他應得的懲罰比那嚴重多了
That's a hell of a lot less than he deserves.

1311
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:51,280
比爾  我想你不知道你昨晚惹上的麻煩有多大
Listen, Bill, I don't think you realize what kind of trouble you were in last night.

1312
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:54,870
你以為這些人是誰?
Who do you think those people were?

1313
02:16:55,450 --> 02:16:57,660
他們可不是一般人
Those were not just ordinary people there.

1314
02:16:57,870 --> 02:17:01,170
如果我說出他們的名字...  可我不會告訴你的...
If I told you their names-- I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1315
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:05,170
不過如果我說了  你晚上大概睡不著覺
but if I did, I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1316
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:10,930
是第二道暗語嗎?
Was it the second password?

1317
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:13,970
那是洩漏我身分的原因嗎?
Is that what gave me away?

1318
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:18,430
是的  你總算懂了
Yes, finally.

1319
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,860
但不是因為你不知道
But not because you didn't know it.

1320
02:17:24,770 --> 02:17:27,650
而是因為根本沒有第二道暗語
It's because there was no second password.

1321
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:33,410
況且這些人是坐禮車來的  而你是搭計程車來的...
Of course it didn't help a whole lot that those people arrive in limos...

1322
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:36,120
那也太明顯了一點
and you showed up in a taxi.

1323
02:17:36,370 --> 02:17:40,080
加上他們又在你外套裡找到戲服租借的收據...
Or that they found the receipt from the rental house in your coat...

1324
02:17:40,290 --> 02:17:43,420
馬上就知道你是誰了
made out to you-know-who.

1325
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:54,200
那裡...
There was a...

1326
02:17:58,500 --> 02:17:59,700
那裡...
There was a...

1327
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:04,610
那裡有個女人...
There was a woman there...

1328
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:07,950
她...
who...

1329
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:12,400
曾經想要警告我
tried to warn me.

1330
02:18:17,850 --> 02:18:19,150
我知道
I know.

1331
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:26,800
你知道她是誰嗎?
Do you know who she was?

1332
02:18:32,050 --> 02:18:33,250
知道
Yes.

1333
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:37,550
她是個...
She was...

1334
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:42,440
她是個妓女
She was a hooker.

1335
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:53,670
抱歉  不過...
Sorry, but...

1336
02:18:54,740 --> 02:18:56,840
她真的就是個妓女
that's what she was.

1337
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,250
妓女
A hooker.

1338
02:19:11,850 --> 02:19:13,050
比爾...
Bill...

1339
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:19,640
假設說...
suppose I told you...

1340
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:24,190
當時發生的一切...
that everything that happened to you there...

1341
02:19:25,730 --> 02:19:29,860
威脅  女孩的警告...
the threats, the girl's warnings...

1342
02:19:30,070 --> 02:19:32,820
她最後一刻的發言...
her last-minute intervention...

1343
02:19:33,030 --> 02:19:36,780
假設我告訴你  那一切...
suppose I said that all of that...

1344
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:40,830
都是設計好的
was staged.

1345
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:46,870
只是一場戲
That it was a kind of charade.

1346
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:50,380
那都是假的
That it was fake.

1347
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:56,340
假的?
Fake?

1348
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:00,640
是的  假的
Yes. Fake.

1349
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:14,110
他們為什麼要那麼做?
Why would they do that?

1350
02:20:14,990 --> 02:20:16,150
為什麼?
Why?

1351
02:20:17,490 --> 02:20:19,200
簡單地說...
In plain words...

1352
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:22,660
就是要把你嚇得屁滾尿流
to scare the living shit out of you.

1353
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:27,250
讓你不敢再提起你去過哪兒...
To keep you quiet about where you'd been...

1354
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:29,460
還有你看到過什麼
and what you'd seen.

1355
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:51,150
你看過這個了嗎?
Have you seen this?

1356
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:03,530
（前選美皇后在旅館用藥過量）

1357
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:10,460
知道  我看過了
Yes, I have.

1358
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:19,050
我在太平間看到她屍體了
I saw her body in the morgue.

1359
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:24,560
她是...
Was she...

1360
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:31,060
她是在派對上的那個女人嗎?
Was she the woman at the party?

1361
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:40,440
是的
Yes.

1362
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:44,830
她是的
She was.

1363
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:56,710
維克特...
Victor...

1364
02:21:59,130 --> 02:22:01,680
躺在太平間的屍體...
the woman lying dead in the morgue...

1365
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:05,600
就是派對上的那個女人
was the woman at the party?

1366
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:08,770
對
Yes.

1367
02:22:14,230 --> 02:22:19,150
維克特  也許我搞不清楚
Well, Victor, maybe I'm missing something here.

1368
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:23,450
你說這是假的  一場戲
You called it a fake, a charade.

1369
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:28,540
那這是他媽的哪一種戲...
Do you mind telling me what kind of fucking charade...

1370
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:32,620
會有人在戲裡真的死掉?
ends with somebody turning up dead?

1371
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:43,180
好吧  比爾  我就直接了當說  好嗎?
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit. All right?

1372
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:46,180
你在過去二十四小時內  幹了一堆超過你本分的事
You've been way out of your depth for the last 24 hours.

1373
02:22:46,390 --> 02:22:49,850
你想知道這是什麼戲嗎?  我就告訴你這是什麼戲
You wanna know what kind of charade? I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1374
02:22:51,140 --> 02:22:54,770
這齣戲從"讓我來"的假犧牲開始...
That whole play-acted, "take me" phony sacrifice...

1375
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:59,610
你的亂來與她真正的死因根本毫無關係
that you've been jerking off with had nothing to do with her real death.

1376
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:03,450
你走了之後  在她身上發生的事  之前也曾發生過
Nothing happened after you left that hadn't happened to her before.

1377
02:23:03,650 --> 02:23:06,700
她已經心智不正常了  就這樣
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1378
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:12,500
當他們帶她回家後  她還很好...
When they took her home, she was just fine...

1379
02:23:13,150 --> 02:23:14,950
剩下的都在報紙上了
and the rest is in the paper.

1380
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:18,800
她是個藥頭  嗑藥致死  沒什麼可疑的
She was a junkie. She OD'd. There was nothing suspicious.

1381
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,300
她的門從內反鎖  警方高興  案子也結了
Her door was locked from the inside. The police are happy. End of story.

1382
02:23:24,590 --> 02:23:29,510
她的死是早晚的事
Come on. It was always gonna be just a matter of time with her.

1383
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:31,600
記得吧  你自己也對她說過
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1384
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:35,800
那個在我房間裡嗑藥過量的波霸美女?
You remember, the one with the great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1385
02:23:52,490 --> 02:23:56,670
聽著  比爾  沒有誰殺誰
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1386
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:59,710
有人死了  這種事常有的
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1387
02:24:01,210 --> 02:24:03,610
不過我們還是繼續過活
But life goes on.

1388
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:05,400
總是這樣...
It always does...

1389
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:07,550
直到我們死去
until it doesn't.

1390
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:10,680
不過你已經知道了  對吧?
But you know that, don't you?

1391
02:27:35,220 --> 02:27:37,760
我會把一切都告訴妳
I'll tell you everything.

1392
02:27:43,180 --> 02:27:45,440
我會把一切都告訴妳
I'll tell you everything.

1393
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:39,490
海蓮娜快起床了
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1394
02:28:50,850 --> 02:28:52,350
她一直...
She's...

1395
02:28:56,420 --> 02:29:00,680
她等著我們帶她去買聖誕節禮物
She's expecting us to take her Christmas shopping today.

1396
02:29:25,490 --> 02:29:26,580
不錯
That's nice.

1397
02:29:26,790 --> 02:29:29,410
我可以把莎賓娜玩偶放在裡面
I could put Sabrina in here.

1398
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:32,580
真漂亮
It's really pretty.

1399
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:34,800
很傳統
It's old-fashioned.

1400
02:29:43,930 --> 02:29:45,180
好大啊
He's big.

1401
02:29:45,390 --> 02:29:48,770
我希望聖誕老公公今年會給我這個
I hope Santa Claus gets me one of these for Christmas.

1402
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:50,230
真的嗎?
You do?

1403
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:54,730
那妳就得等著瞧囉
Well, you're gonna have to wait and see.

1404
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:01,980
艾莉絲...
Alice.

1405
02:30:08,910 --> 02:30:10,910
妳覺得我們該怎麼辦?
What do you think we should do?

1406
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:17,700
我覺得我們該怎麼辦?
What do I think we should do?

1407
02:30:17,850 --> 02:30:19,350
看  媽咪
Look, Mommy!

1408
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:23,220
嗨
Hey.

1409
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:31,180
我的想法嗎?  我不知道
What do I think? I don't know.

1410
02:30:33,350 --> 02:30:35,210
也許...
I mean, maybe...

1411
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:37,610
嗨
Hey.

1412
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:50,660
我想...
Maybe I think...

1413
02:30:51,330 --> 02:30:53,720
我們應該感到慶幸
we should be grateful.

1414
02:30:59,670 --> 02:31:01,500
慶幸...
Grateful...

1415
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:06,800
我們能夠捱過這些...
that we've managed to survive through all of our...

1416
02:31:07,720 --> 02:31:09,730
冒險...
adventures...

1417
02:31:11,850 --> 02:31:14,190
不論是真的冒險...
whether they were real...

1418
02:31:14,730 --> 02:31:17,080
還是只是一場夢
or only a dream.

1419
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:30,080
妳確定嗎?
Are you sure of that?

1420
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:35,820
我確定嗎?
Am I sure?

1421
02:31:47,590 --> 02:31:49,250
只能...
Only...

1422
02:31:51,330 --> 02:31:53,180
我只能確定...
Only as sure as I am...

1423
02:31:53,390 --> 02:31:57,270
一晚的真實...
that the reality of one night...

1424
02:31:58,520 --> 02:32:01,400
甚至是一輩子的真實...
let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1425
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:06,420
也不可能是全部的真相
can ever be the whole truth.

1426
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:15,180
夢也不會...
And no dream is ever...

1427
02:32:16,900 --> 02:32:19,100
只是一場夢
just a dream.

1428
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:29,400
最重要的是...
The important thing is...

1429
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:33,400
我們現在醒了...
we're awake now...

1430
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:36,600
希望...
and hopefully...

1431
02:32:39,550 --> 02:32:42,050
這能持續好長一段時間
for a long time to come.

1432
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:47,500
永遠
Forever.

1433
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:51,200
永遠?
Forever?

1434
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:54,950
永遠
Forever.

1435
02:32:56,870 --> 02:33:00,670
別用那個字眼  好嗎?
Let's not use that word. You know?

1436
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:04,050
它让我感到害怕
It frightens me.

1437
02:33:14,010 --> 02:33:17,100
不過我真的愛你...
But I do love you...

1438
02:33:20,250 --> 02:33:22,250
而且你知道...
and you know...

1439
02:33:23,150 --> 02:33:25,280
有件事更重要...
there is something very important...

1440
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:28,240
我們必須馬上進行
that we need to do as soon as possible.

1441
02:33:29,550 --> 02:33:31,350
是什麼?
What's that?

1442
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,200
上床做愛
Fuck.
