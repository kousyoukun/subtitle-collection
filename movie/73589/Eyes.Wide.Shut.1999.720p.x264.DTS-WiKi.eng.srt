1
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,970
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,680
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,730
Now listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,980
I know.

5
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,080
How do I look?

6
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,740
Perfect.

7
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,650
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,280
It's great.

9
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,570
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,250
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,370
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,910
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,580
Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,790
Coming.

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,260
All right.

16
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,710
I'm ready.

17
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,440
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,610
Roz.

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,990
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,030
You look amazing, Mrs.Harford.

21
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,580
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,410
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch The Nutcracker?

23
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,540
- What time's it on?
- 9:00.

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,380
- You can watch that.
- Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,670
- No, darling.
- It'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,130
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,020
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,970
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

29
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,900
- I'll hold our cab to take you home.
- Thanks, Dr.Harford.

30
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,490
You be good, baby.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,110
- Good night, sweetheart.
- See you in the morning.

32
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,660
- Victor, Illona.
- Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,410
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,260
- Thanks so much for coming.
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,550
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

36
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,670
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

37
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,630
- Yes, he does.
- He does?

38
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,850
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,430
- You ought to see my serve now.
- He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,140
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,770
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,690
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,700
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,540
Not a soul.

45
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,840
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,520
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,820
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,570
I went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,120
Really?

50
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,920
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,300
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,510
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

54
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,220
Thank you.

55
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,320
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,940
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
You go and say hello, and I'll
meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,740
Good.

59
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,640
Nightingale.

60
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,630
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,130
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,550
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,180
- How long has it been?
- I don't know. 10 years?

64
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,720
And a couple.

65
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,140
- Do you have time for a drink?
- Sure.

66
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,400
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,490
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,420
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,910
I see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,660
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,120
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,390
You know what they say:
"Once a doctor, always a doctor."

73
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,880
Yes, or in my case:
"Never a doctor, never a doctor."

74
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,130
I never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,220
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

76
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,640
Cheers.

77
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,640
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

78
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,490
Be right with you.

79
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,370
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

80
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,360
...I'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata Cafe.

81
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,250
- Stop by if you get a chance.
- I'll be there.

82
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,030
- It's great seeing you.
- Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,950
I think that's my glass.

84
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,290
I'm absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,310
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

86
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,360
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,740
I'm American.

88
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,330
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,670
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?

90
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,420
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

91
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,380
...crying his eyes out...

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,340
...in some place
with a very bad climate?

93
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,470
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,270
A very good time.

95
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,520
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,700
With my husband.

97
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,990
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,620
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,670
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,590
Well, at the moment...

101
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,760
...I'm looking for a job.

102
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,680
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,470
But it went broke.

104
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,110
What a shame.

105
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,360
I have some friends in the art game.

106
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,240
Perhaps I can be of some help.

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,660
Thank you.

108
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,470
Someone you know?

109
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,020
My...

110
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,110
...husband.

111
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,820
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage...

112
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,700
...is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

113
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,190
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

114
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,380
...who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

115
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,340
Why wouldn't she?

116
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,220
Is it as bad as that?

117
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,890
As good as that.

118
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,390
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

119
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,230
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

120
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,280
How do you spell Nuala?

121
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,820
N-U-A-L-A.

122
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,340
You don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,070
You were very kind to me once.

124
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,040
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

125
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,640
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

126
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,430
...on a very windy day...?

127
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,860
- And you got something in your eye.
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

128
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,770
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

129
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,480
...which was also clean.

130
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,860
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

131
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,950
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

132
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,700
Why don't you tell me?

133
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,410
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

134
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,420
...and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

135
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,670
The ones they really wanted.

136
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,340
Fascinating.

137
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,060
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

138
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,190
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

139
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,530
They always seem so...

140
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,000
...knowledgeable.

141
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,830
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

142
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,910
...about all sorts of things.

143
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,000
But I bet they work too hard.

144
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,300
Just think of all they miss.

145
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,550
You're probably right.

146
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,350
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

147
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,570
Exactly?

148
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,560
Where the rainbow ends.

149
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,020
Where the rainbow ends?

150
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,690
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,000
Now that depends where that is.

152
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,860
Well, let's find out.

153
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,920
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr.Harford.

154
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,410
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr.Ziegler.

155
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,920
Fine.

156
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,090
To be continued?

157
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,990
Bill, thanks for coming.

158
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,870
We had a little accident here.

159
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,630
What happened?

160
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,080
Well, she was...

161
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,750
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

162
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,750
What did she take?

163
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,260
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

164
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,300
It's heroin and coke.

165
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,270
Heroin and coke?

166
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,100
Anything else?

167
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,020
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

168
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,190
How long has she been like this?

169
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,860
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

170
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,200
What's her name?

171
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,580
Mandy.

172
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,000
Can you hear me, Mandy?

173
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,970
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

174
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,570
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

175
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,350
You can hear me.

176
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,780
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

177
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,820
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

178
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,030
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

179
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,070
Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,990
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

181
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,660
Good.

182
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,550
Good.

183
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,790
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

184
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,590
It's wonderful.

185
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,100
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

186
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,100
I haven't.

187
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,690
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

188
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,030
Do you like the period?

189
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,910
I do.

190
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,700
I adore it.

191
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,250
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

192
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,710
Would you like to see it?

193
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,590
I can show it to you.

194
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,100
We won't be gone long.

195
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,310
Maybe...

196
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,110
...not just...

197
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,700
...now.

198
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,010
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

199
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,930
Sorry.

200
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,070
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

201
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,240
Better.

202
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,350
You are a very, very lucky girl.

203
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,850
You know that?

204
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,670
I know.

205
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,050
You're gonna be okay this time.

206
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,560
But you can't keep doing this.

207
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,810
You understand?

208
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,110
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

209
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,490
I know.

210
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,880
Well, Victor...

211
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,630
...I'll leave the rest to you.

212
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,600
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

213
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,510
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

214
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,220
Another hour?

215
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,060
Then I'd have someone take her home.

216
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,610
Good night, Mandy.

217
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,780
I can't thank you enough for this.

218
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,740
- You saved my ass.
- I'm glad I was here.

219
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,410
Bill, I probably...

220
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,790
I know I don't have to mention this...

221
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,920
...but this is just between us.

222
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,670
Of course.

223
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,460
Thanks.

224
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,070
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

225
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,790
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

226
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,630
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

227
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,560
Yes...

228
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,590
...but will I?

229
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,970
Of course you will.

230
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,940
I really have to go.
I have to go.

231
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,940
You don't, you know.

232
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,280
Yes, I do.

233
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,450
I must see you again.

234
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,860
- That's impossible.
- Why?

235
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,120
Because...

236
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,960
...I'm married.

237
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,330
Good morning, Lisa.

238
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,660
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

239
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,790
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

240
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,620
- Sure.
- Thank you.

241
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,160
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, doctor.

242
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,420
"'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...

243
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,500
...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse."

244
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,260
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

245
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,690
Hold this for Mommy.

246
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,060
Looking forward to Christmas?

247
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,860
Does this hurt?

248
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,460
Right there?

249
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,340
Daddy's gonna like that.

250
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,770
Very good choice.

251
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,890
"...before me...

252
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,350
...when I jump into my bed."

253
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,530
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

254
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,320
I've taken care of that.

255
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,330
Good.

256
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,660
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

257
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,540
Let's do that tomorrow.

258
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,710
Tell me something.

259
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,970
Those two girls...

260
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,440
...at the party last night...

261
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Did you...

262
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,650
...by any chance...

263
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,370
...happen to...

264
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,830
...fuck them?

265
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,790
What?

266
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,380
What are you talking about?

267
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,050
I'm talking about the two girls...

268
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,220
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

269
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,980
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

270
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,030
Who were they?

271
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,990
They were just a couple of models.

272
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,580
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

273
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,750
Wait a minute.

274
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,130
I didn't disappear with anybody.

275
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,560
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

276
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,270
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

277
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,030
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

278
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,090
A friend of the Zieglers.

279
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,180
What did he want?

280
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,460
What did he want?

281
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,800
Sex...

282
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,800
...upstairs.

283
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,770
Then and there.

284
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,740
Is that all?

285
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,650
Yeah, that was all.

286
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,650
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

287
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,500
That's right.

288
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,120
Well, I guess that's understandable.

289
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,290
Understandable?

290
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,330
Because you are a very...

291
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,550
...very beautiful woman.

292
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,020
Wait.

293
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,680
Because I'm a beautiful woman...

294
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,190
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

295
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,400
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

296
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,870
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

297
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,870
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

298
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,880
So on that basis...

299
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,090
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

300
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,050
There are exceptions.

301
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,600
And what makes you an exception?

302
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,020
What makes me an exception is that...

303
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,690
...I happen to be in love with you.

304
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,360
And because we're married...

305
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,880
...and because I would never
lie to you...

306
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,120
...or hurt you.

307
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,840
Do you realize that
what you're saying...

308
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,430
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

309
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,220
...is out of consideration for me?

310
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,470
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

311
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,600
Let's just relax, Alice.

312
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,400
This pot is making you aggressive.

313
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,030
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

314
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,860
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

315
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,650
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

316
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,080
I don't even know
what we're arguing about here.

317
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,500
I'm not arguing.

318
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,750
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

319
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,710
Where I'm coming from?

320
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,890
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

321
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,220
...standing in your office naked...

322
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,110
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

323
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,100
Now, what I want to know...

324
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,320
I want to know what you're thinking
about when you're squeezing them.

325
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,660
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

326
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,450
It's all very impersonal...

327
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:40,250
...and you know
there's always a nurse present.

328
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,670
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

329
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,920
Exactly.

330
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,670
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

331
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,150
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

332
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,600
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

333
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,110
...about what handsome Dr.Bill's
dickie might be like?

334
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,480
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

335
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,960
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

336
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,070
And what makes you so sure?

337
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,120
If for no better reason...

338
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,630
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

339
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,300
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

340
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,760
What then?

341
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,390
I don't know, Alice...

342
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,220
What then?

343
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,060
Women don't...

344
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,780
They basically just don't
think like that.

345
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,620
Millions of years of evolution, right?

346
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,910
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

347
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,330
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

348
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,790
...and whatever the fuck else!

349
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,760
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

350
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,930
If you men only knew.

351
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,430
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

352
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,770
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

353
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,100
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

354
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,480
No, I'm not.

355
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,770
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

356
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,980
No, I haven't.

357
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,690
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

358
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,870
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

359
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,450
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

360
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,450
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

361
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,970
You are very, very sure of yourself...

362
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,450
...aren't you?

363
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,130
No.

364
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,630
I'm sure of you.

365
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,770
Do you think that's funny?

366
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,500
All right. Fuck it.

367
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,080
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

368
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,020
Do you...

369
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,850
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

370
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,870
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

371
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,230
...there was this young naval officer...

372
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:01,030
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

373
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,570
No.

374
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,410
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

375
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,300
Nothing rings a bell?

376
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,260
Well...

377
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,280
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

378
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,740
He was checking into the hotel...

379
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,480
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

380
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,150
...to the elevator.

381
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,080
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

382
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,080
Nothing more.

383
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,550
But I could hardly...

384
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,770
...move.

385
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,980
That afternoon...

386
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,330
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

387
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,200
...and you and I made love.

388
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:33,790
And we made plans about our future...

389
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,960
...and we talked about Helena.

390
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,350
And yet...

391
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,180
...at no time...

392
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,150
...was he ever...

393
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,100
...out of my mind.

394
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,490
And I thought if he wanted me...

395
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,830
...even if it was only...

396
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,250
...for one night...

397
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,250
...I was ready to give up everything.

398
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,340
You.

399
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,480
Helena.

400
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,810
My whole fucking future.

401
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,700
Everything.

402
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,620
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

403
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,550
...you were dearer to me than ever.

404
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,140
And at that moment, my love for you...

405
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,010
...was both...

406
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:12,510
...tender and sad.

407
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,110
I barely slept that night...

408
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,320
...and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

409
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,410
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

410
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,290
...or that he might still be there.

411
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,840
But by dinner...

412
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,350
...I realized he was gone...

413
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,970
...and I was...

414
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,990
...relieved.

415
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,820
Yes, this is Dr.Harford.

416
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,870
When did it happen?

417
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,330
I have the address.

418
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,440
Thank you.

419
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,380
Lou Nathanson just died.

420
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,900
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

421
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,570
- Hello, Rosa.
- Good evening, Dr.Harford.

422
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,740
- How is Miss Nathanson?
- Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

423
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,080
Thank you.

424
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,600
Come in.

425
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,980
Marion...

426
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,730
Oh, Dr.Harford...

427
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,200
How good of you to come.

428
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,860
I came as soon as I got the message.

429
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,320
Thank you.

430
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,530
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

431
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,540
Your father was...

432
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,500
He was a very brave man.

433
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,800
Oh, thank you.

434
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,210
How are you holding up?

435
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,220
I'm a bit numb.

436
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,550
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

437
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,970
Would you like to sit down?

438
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,960
It's so unreal.

439
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,300
Daddy had such a good day.

440
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,890
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

441
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,100
Then he had a little dinner...

442
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,730
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

443
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,950
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

444
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,410
...and when I went to see how he was...

445
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,910
...I just thought he was asleep.

446
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,970
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

447
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,360
From what you've said...

448
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,610
...I'm sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

449
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,600
Oh, God, I hope so.

450
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,740
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

451
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,530
...than his death itself.

452
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,080
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

453
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,710
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

454
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,140
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

455
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,180
...and he'll be coming over soon.

456
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,850
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

457
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,240
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

458
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,480
A math professor.

459
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:41,190
We're going to get married in May.

460
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,120
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

461
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,340
Thank you.

462
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:58,590
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

463
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,960
We'll be moving out there soon.

464
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

465
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,400
It really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

466
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,170
Oh, my God, no...

467
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,850
I love you.

468
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,860
I love you.

469
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,750
I love you, I love you, I love you.

470
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,910
I don't want to go away with Carl.

471
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,240
Marion, I don't think you realize...

472
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,730
I do.

473
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:18,000
Even if I'm never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

474
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,790
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

475
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,930
You're very upset, and I don't think
you realize what you're saying.

476
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,110
I love you.

477
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,390
We barely know each other.

478
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,060
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

479
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,980
I love you.

480
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,990
That's probably Carl.

481
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,450
Please don't despise me.

482
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,250
- Hello, Rosa.
- Hello, Mr.Thomas.

483
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,260
- Is she in the bedroom?
- Yes, she is.

484
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,630
Thank you.

485
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,020
Come in.

486
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,570
Darling.

487
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,620
I'm so very sorry.

488
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,080
Are you all right?

489
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,160
I'm okay.

490
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,580
- Dr.Harford, good evening.
- Good evening, Carl.

491
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,680
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

492
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,840
- It's the least I could do.
- It means a lot to us.

493
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,260
Thank you.

494
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,970
I was actually on my way out.

495
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,980
Marion...

496
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,980
...your father was very proud of you...

497
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,200
...and I know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

498
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,860
Thank you.

499
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,670
I'll show you out.

500
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,540
Good night.

501
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,890
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

502
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,600
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

503
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,180
I'm serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

504
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,270
What team's this switch hitter
playing for?

505
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,900
- Looks like the pink team.
- Look at this faggot!

506
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,860
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

507
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,400
Merry Christmas, Mary!

508
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,190
- Your butt-brothers are back there!
- Prime cut of meat!

509
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,910
You want to take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

510
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,910
You should have tits,
you're standing so close!

511
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:47,210
- I got dumps that are bigger than you!
- Come on, macho man!

512
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,391
- You want a piece of this, baby?
- Exit only, honey.

513
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:19,779
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

514
00:47:20,749 --> 00:47:22,399
Ten past 12.

515
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,619
Going anywhere special?

516
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,039
No, I'm just taking a walk.

517
00:47:34,879 --> 00:47:37,209
How'd you like to have a little fun?

518
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:40,129
I'm sorry?

519
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,299
Have a little fun?

520
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:47,049
I just live right down there.

521
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:50,439
Would you like to come inside with me?

522
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,769
Come inside with you?

523
00:47:56,409 --> 00:48:00,019
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

524
00:48:07,419 --> 00:48:08,989
You live in there?

525
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:13,459
By yourself?

526
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:16,429
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

527
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:19,389
Hey, it's okay.

528
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:22,209
Listen, no one will bother us.

529
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:24,759
It's okay. Come on.

530
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:26,589
Come on.

531
00:48:52,919 --> 00:48:54,119
This is it.

532
00:48:58,299 --> 00:48:59,789
That's a nice tree.

533
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:09,839
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

534
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:25,969
It's...

535
00:49:27,209 --> 00:49:28,989
...cozy. It's a...

536
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:31,309
...cozy place.

537
00:49:32,499 --> 00:49:33,879
It's okay.

538
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:54,099
Do you suppose we
should talk about money?

539
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:56,349
Yeah, I guess so.

540
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:00,099
That depends on what you want to do.

541
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:06,159
What do you want to do?

542
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:12,239
What do you recommend?

543
00:50:17,049 --> 00:50:18,759
What do I recommend?

544
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:36,259
I'd rather not put it into words.

545
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,229
How about you just leave it up to me?

546
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,519
I'm in your hands.

547
00:50:46,409 --> 00:50:48,969
And how does 150 sound?

548
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:52,489
Sounds wonderful.

549
00:50:56,499 --> 00:51:00,439
Don't worry. I don't
keep track of the time.

550
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:09,209
Thank you.

551
00:51:09,429 --> 00:51:10,419
Prego, prego.

552
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:12,929
- Grazie.
- You're welcome.

553
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:16,389
If I was Italian, he'd have
answered me in Italian.

554
00:52:00,689 --> 00:52:02,019
Shall we?

555
00:52:20,419 --> 00:52:21,739
Excuse me.

556
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,849
Is everything all right?

557
00:52:41,689 --> 00:52:45,019
I was just wondering if you
were going to be much longer?

558
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:51,519
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

559
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,239
It could be awhile.

560
00:52:55,709 --> 00:52:57,859
Any idea how long?

561
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,159
No, I don't really know.

562
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:04,299
We're still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

563
00:53:06,379 --> 00:53:10,599
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now.

564
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:32,649
Was that Mrs.Dr.Bill?

565
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,419
Do you have to go?

566
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:57,839
Do I have to go?

567
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,179
I think I do.

568
00:54:06,979 --> 00:54:08,389
Are you sure?

569
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:16,779
Yes, I'm afraid so.

570
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,949
But listen, I want to pay you anyway.

571
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:27,839
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

572
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:35,289
But you know what? You don't
have to bother about that.

573
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:36,969
No, it's all right.

574
00:54:37,889 --> 00:54:41,009
- No, really. You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

575
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:44,549
Really?

576
00:54:47,149 --> 00:54:49,099
Well, thank you very much.

577
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:34,518
Thank you.

578
00:55:49,048 --> 00:55:52,328
Would you like a table,
or would you like to sit at the bar?

579
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:55,388
- I'd like a table.
- Please follow me.

580
00:56:03,518 --> 00:56:05,718
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

581
00:56:06,898 --> 00:56:08,888
Could I get you anything to drink?

582
00:56:10,068 --> 00:56:12,388
- I'd like a beer.
- Certainly.

583
00:56:23,198 --> 00:56:25,408
One, two, one-two-three-four.

584
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:28,868
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

585
00:56:29,088 --> 00:56:33,788
On the bass, Mr.Larry McVey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

586
00:56:34,008 --> 00:56:38,078
And on the guitar,
the one, the only, Mr.Bobby Berman.

587
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:42,518
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

588
00:56:42,768 --> 00:56:45,298
I'm Nick Nightingale. Good night.

589
00:56:55,738 --> 00:56:58,268
- Nick, that was great.
- Thanks.

590
00:56:58,658 --> 00:57:01,978
- Nightingale.
- Hey, Bill, you made it.

591
00:57:02,198 --> 00:57:05,738
I'm sorry, I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

592
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:08,988
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

593
00:57:09,628 --> 00:57:12,788
- What are you drinking?
- A vodka and tonic, please.

594
00:57:14,378 --> 00:57:15,408
Thank you.

595
00:57:17,178 --> 00:57:19,458
So what brings you out at this hour?

596
00:57:19,678 --> 00:57:22,838
- I have a patient in the neighborhood.
- You live in the Village?

597
00:57:23,058 --> 00:57:25,968
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

598
00:57:26,178 --> 00:57:27,588
You're married?

599
00:57:28,228 --> 00:57:29,598
Nine years.

600
00:57:30,018 --> 00:57:32,968
- Any kids?
- Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

601
00:57:33,188 --> 00:57:34,218
How about you?

602
00:57:34,438 --> 00:57:37,058
I've got a wife
and four boys in Seattle.

603
00:57:37,278 --> 00:57:38,658
You're a long way from home.

604
00:57:39,108 --> 00:57:41,778
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

605
00:57:42,618 --> 00:57:43,608
Thank you.

606
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:52,118
- Is this your band?
- No, it's a pick-up band.

607
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:56,378
- Who do you normally play with?
- Anybody, anywhere.

608
00:57:56,628 --> 00:57:59,078
I got another gig later tonight.

609
00:57:59,298 --> 00:58:01,208
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

610
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:03,138
They only get started around 2.

611
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:05,128
In the Village?

612
00:58:07,348 --> 00:58:10,758
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

613
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:12,218
You don't?

614
00:58:12,898 --> 00:58:17,638
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

615
00:58:17,858 --> 00:58:20,648
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

616
00:58:20,858 --> 00:58:23,528
- A different place every time?
- So far.

617
00:58:24,658 --> 00:58:25,858
What's the big mystery?

618
00:58:26,658 --> 00:58:29,898
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

619
00:58:33,628 --> 00:58:36,868
Nick, I'm sorry.
Is there something I'm missing here?

620
00:58:39,928 --> 00:58:42,758
I play blindfolded.

621
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:45,038
What?

622
00:58:46,888 --> 00:58:49,468
I play blindfolded.

623
00:58:53,518 --> 00:58:55,068
You're putting me on.

624
00:58:55,268 --> 00:58:57,718
No, it's the truth.

625
00:58:58,738 --> 00:59:03,348
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

626
00:59:05,738 --> 00:59:07,448
Oh, man.

627
00:59:08,618 --> 00:59:12,948
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

628
00:59:13,328 --> 00:59:14,988
...but never...

629
00:59:15,378 --> 00:59:17,788
...never anything like this...

630
00:59:18,548 --> 00:59:21,578
...and never such women.

631
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:33,088
Excuse me.

632
00:59:36,978 --> 00:59:40,018
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

633
00:59:45,868 --> 00:59:47,688
I know where that is.

634
00:59:55,288 --> 00:59:56,238
Right.

635
00:59:59,878 --> 01:00:01,788
Well, I'm on my way right now.

636
01:00:02,548 --> 01:00:05,078
Okay, sir. Thank you.

637
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:08,778
What is this?

638
01:00:10,388 --> 01:00:13,008
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

639
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:19,468
It's the password.

640
01:00:20,228 --> 01:00:21,718
The password?

641
01:00:22,988 --> 01:00:26,648
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

642
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:31,528
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

643
01:00:36,578 --> 01:00:40,538
You know there is no way on earth...

644
01:00:40,998 --> 01:00:44,498
...that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

645
01:00:45,178 --> 01:00:48,838
- Come on, buddy, give me a break.
- Nick, I'll tell you what.

646
01:00:49,048 --> 01:00:52,298
I've already got the password.

647
01:00:53,218 --> 01:00:56,378
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

648
01:00:56,598 --> 01:01:00,178
...and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

649
01:01:02,898 --> 01:01:07,058
Listen, let's just say
for one second...

650
01:01:08,028 --> 01:01:10,228
...that I was prepared to do that.

651
01:01:10,578 --> 01:01:13,898
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

652
01:01:15,078 --> 01:01:16,398
Why not?

653
01:01:16,868 --> 01:01:21,158
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

654
01:01:21,998 --> 01:01:25,658
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

655
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:47,768
Thanks. Keep the change.

656
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:03,198
Yes? Who is it?

657
01:02:03,418 --> 01:02:05,158
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

658
01:02:05,378 --> 01:02:09,788
I apologize for disturbing you
at this hour, but I need your help.

659
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:12,838
Who is it that you want?

660
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:17,378
I'm very sorry.
I'm looking for Peter Grenning...

661
01:02:17,638 --> 01:02:20,088
...the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

662
01:02:22,228 --> 01:02:23,718
What's your name?

663
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:26,268
My name is Bill Harford.

664
01:02:26,478 --> 01:02:28,688
I'm Mr.Grenning's doctor.

665
01:02:29,698 --> 01:02:31,598
You are Grenning's doctor?

666
01:02:34,778 --> 01:02:35,938
Okay.

667
01:02:36,488 --> 01:02:37,948
Just a moment.

668
01:02:53,138 --> 01:02:55,208
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

669
01:02:55,718 --> 01:02:57,008
Yes, I am.

670
01:02:57,518 --> 01:03:01,378
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

671
01:03:02,188 --> 01:03:04,388
He moved to Chicago?

672
01:03:07,068 --> 01:03:09,098
I wasn't aware of that.

673
01:03:11,068 --> 01:03:14,648
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

674
01:03:14,868 --> 01:03:16,488
Yes, I am.

675
01:03:16,948 --> 01:03:17,858
Well, first of all...

676
01:03:18,118 --> 01:03:22,988
...please let me apologize again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr...

677
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,408
Milich.

678
01:03:24,628 --> 01:03:28,788
Mr.Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr.Harford...

679
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:31,998
...this is my New York State
Medical Board card.

680
01:03:32,928 --> 01:03:35,878
Okay, so you are Dr.Harford.

681
01:03:36,098 --> 01:03:39,508
If I see Peter, I tell him
you were looking for him.

682
01:03:39,718 --> 01:03:41,838
Oh, no, wait. Please, please...

683
01:03:42,478 --> 01:03:45,968
Listen, the reason that
I came here tonight was...

684
01:03:48,018 --> 01:03:52,938
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

685
01:03:53,408 --> 01:03:57,188
And I'd be happy to pay you
$ 100 over the rental price...

686
01:03:57,408 --> 01:03:59,068
...for the inconvenience.

687
01:04:00,908 --> 01:04:02,198
A hundred dollars?

688
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,368
I don't think so.

689
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:12,708
How about $200?

690
01:04:13,338 --> 01:04:15,878
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

691
01:04:27,728 --> 01:04:28,968
Come in.

692
01:04:33,448 --> 01:04:36,058
Can't be too careful these days.

693
01:04:39,278 --> 01:04:40,438
Please.

694
01:04:43,198 --> 01:04:46,108
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

695
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:54,118
I need a tux, a cloak with a hood
and a mask.

696
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:57,628
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

697
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:04,038
I think we'll find something for you.

698
01:05:04,808 --> 01:05:06,468
Follow me, please.

699
01:05:07,018 --> 01:05:08,008
Good.

700
01:05:16,988 --> 01:05:19,148
Looks like alive, huh?

701
01:05:20,908 --> 01:05:22,898
- It's wonderful.
- Come.

702
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:26,238
So what color cloak?

703
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:29,418
Red, brown, red?

704
01:05:30,788 --> 01:05:31,868
Black.

705
01:05:32,088 --> 01:05:35,618
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

706
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:38,458
- I don't think so.
- Clowns, officers, pirates?

707
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:41,338
No, just the tux, the black cloak...

708
01:05:41,548 --> 01:05:43,798
With a hood and a mask.

709
01:05:46,268 --> 01:05:47,758
May I take your coat?

710
01:05:49,648 --> 01:05:52,928
- You are medicine doctor, yes?
- Yes, I am.

711
01:05:53,898 --> 01:05:57,728
- I have some problem with my hair.
- Your hair?

712
01:05:57,948 --> 01:05:59,978
It's starting to fall down too fast.

713
01:06:00,198 --> 01:06:03,108
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

714
01:06:03,328 --> 01:06:05,318
Look at this. Here.

715
01:06:06,658 --> 01:06:07,778
You see?

716
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:09,658
And?

717
01:06:10,538 --> 01:06:12,778
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

718
01:06:12,998 --> 01:06:14,988
What? You can't help me?

719
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:18,788
No. You should see a trichologist.
It's a hair specialist.

720
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:22,628
Mr.Milich, I've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

721
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:24,548
So if you don't mind...

722
01:06:24,758 --> 01:06:26,838
I'm in hurry too, to get back to bed.

723
01:06:27,058 --> 01:06:28,328
I understand.

724
01:06:29,348 --> 01:06:30,928
So black cloak?

725
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:37,268
Did you hear something?

726
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:42,148
What is this?

727
01:06:51,878 --> 01:06:53,658
What is it?

728
01:06:58,758 --> 01:07:00,708
What is this?

729
01:07:14,438 --> 01:07:17,108
What on earth is going on here?!

730
01:07:17,318 --> 01:07:19,428
Milich, I can explain everything.

731
01:07:19,648 --> 01:07:21,938
You! What are you doing here?

732
01:07:22,158 --> 01:07:23,938
I promise I'll kill you!

733
01:07:24,198 --> 01:07:28,068
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

734
01:07:28,288 --> 01:07:32,068
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?!

735
01:07:32,288 --> 01:07:35,908
Milich, are you crazy? We were
invited here by the young lady.

736
01:07:36,128 --> 01:07:40,508
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

737
01:07:40,758 --> 01:07:43,508
- You will have to explain to police!
- To the police?!

738
01:07:43,718 --> 01:07:46,548
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

739
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:50,338
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

740
01:07:50,558 --> 01:07:52,718
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

741
01:07:52,938 --> 01:07:56,888
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

742
01:07:57,108 --> 01:07:59,178
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

743
01:07:59,398 --> 01:08:01,058
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

744
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:04,058
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

745
01:08:04,278 --> 01:08:06,898
You will please stay here
until I return.

746
01:08:07,118 --> 01:08:08,728
Let us out of here!

747
01:08:08,988 --> 01:08:10,858
That's out of the question.

748
01:08:11,118 --> 01:08:14,698
Doctor, sorry.
What color did you say?

749
01:08:14,918 --> 01:08:16,528
- Black?
- Black.

750
01:08:17,128 --> 01:08:20,748
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

751
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,208
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

752
01:08:23,468 --> 01:08:24,368
Sorry.

753
01:08:24,968 --> 01:08:28,498
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

754
01:08:28,718 --> 01:08:31,168
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

755
01:08:31,928 --> 01:08:34,688
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

756
01:10:21,588 --> 01:10:23,698
Okay, that's $74.50.

757
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:28,248
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

758
01:10:29,428 --> 01:10:30,968
There's 80.

759
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:34,298
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

760
01:10:36,598 --> 01:10:40,008
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

761
01:10:40,228 --> 01:10:41,768
Just let the meter run.

762
01:10:41,978 --> 01:10:45,348
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

763
01:10:45,568 --> 01:10:48,178
- Okay?
- How long you gonna be?

764
01:10:48,448 --> 01:10:51,768
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 10 minutes.

765
01:10:53,028 --> 01:10:54,938
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

766
01:11:12,838 --> 01:11:14,218
Good evening, sir.

767
01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:16,458
Good evening.

768
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:18,478
Can we be of any help?

769
01:11:20,228 --> 01:11:22,138
I suppose you'd like the password.

770
01:11:22,348 --> 01:11:23,978
If you'd like, sir.

771
01:11:24,358 --> 01:11:25,178
Fidelio.

772
01:11:25,398 --> 01:11:28,468
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

773
01:12:08,568 --> 01:12:10,218
Good evening, sir.

774
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:11,818
Good evening.

775
01:12:12,198 --> 01:12:13,688
Password, sir?

776
01:12:14,528 --> 01:12:15,518
Fidelio.

777
01:12:16,118 --> 01:12:17,578
Thank you, sir.

778
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:25,748
I'm not sure what you
think you're doing.

779
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,168
But you don't belong here.

780
01:18:28,998 --> 01:18:33,918
I'm sorry, but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.

781
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:40,338
Please! Don't be foolish.

782
01:18:41,048 --> 01:18:42,798
You must go now.

783
01:18:47,608 --> 01:18:48,848
Who are you?

784
01:18:49,098 --> 01:18:51,268
It doesn't matter who I am.

785
01:18:51,988 --> 01:18:54,218
You are in great danger.

786
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:57,948
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

787
01:19:02,248 --> 01:19:05,288
Would you be so good
as to excuse us for a moment?

788
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:06,718
Have you been enjoying yourself?

789
01:22:08,638 --> 01:22:12,248
Well, I've had a very
interesting look around.

790
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:18,428
Do you want to go somewhere
a little more private?

791
01:22:21,858 --> 01:22:22,888
Private?

792
01:22:25,648 --> 01:22:27,318
That might be a good idea.

793
01:22:27,538 --> 01:22:32,278
Here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

794
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:36,248
May I borrow him
for just a few minutes?

795
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:38,958
I promise to bring him right back.

796
01:22:49,128 --> 01:22:52,048
I don't think you realize
the danger you're in now.

797
01:22:52,258 --> 01:22:54,308
You can't fool them for much longer.

798
01:22:54,518 --> 01:22:57,518
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

799
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:01,508
Why are you telling me this?

800
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:03,648
It doesn't matter.

801
01:23:04,108 --> 01:23:04,978
Who are you?

802
01:23:06,738 --> 01:23:10,908
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

803
01:23:12,658 --> 01:23:14,278
Will you come with me?

804
01:23:14,498 --> 01:23:16,248
That's impossible.

805
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:17,488
Why?

806
01:23:17,718 --> 01:23:21,958
Because it would cost me my life
and possibly yours.

807
01:23:23,338 --> 01:23:24,998
Let me see your face.

808
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:27,788
Go!

809
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:31,638
Excuse me, sir.

810
01:23:34,808 --> 01:23:38,228
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

811
01:23:39,688 --> 01:23:40,848
Yes.

812
01:23:41,098 --> 01:23:45,318
Your driver's at the front door and
would urgently like a word with you.

813
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:50,998
Please, come forward.

814
01:25:23,288 --> 01:25:26,578
May I have the password, please?

815
01:25:27,848 --> 01:25:29,628
Fidelio.

816
01:25:32,498 --> 01:25:36,028
That's right, sir.
That is the password...

817
01:25:36,168 --> 01:25:37,998
...for admittance.

818
01:25:38,918 --> 01:25:43,658
But may I ask, what is the password
for the house?

819
01:25:49,258 --> 01:25:52,218
The password for the house?

820
01:26:03,568 --> 01:26:05,148
I'm sorry, I...

821
01:26:11,788 --> 01:26:13,368
I seem to have...

822
01:26:15,078 --> 01:26:16,618
...forgotten it.

823
01:26:18,418 --> 01:26:20,788
That's unfortunate.

824
01:26:21,588 --> 01:26:26,548
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

825
01:26:26,968 --> 01:26:29,638
...or if you never knew it.

826
01:26:30,928 --> 01:26:34,978
You will kindly remove your mask.

827
01:26:55,538 --> 01:26:56,788
Now...

828
01:26:57,498 --> 01:26:59,078
...get undressed.

829
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:08,748
Get undressed?

830
01:27:09,928 --> 01:27:13,138
Remove your clothes.

831
01:27:24,728 --> 01:27:27,988
Gentlemen, please...

832
01:27:30,858 --> 01:27:33,618
Remove your clothes.

833
01:27:33,828 --> 01:27:37,658
Or would you like us to do it for you?

834
01:27:39,208 --> 01:27:40,318
Stop!

835
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:49,008
Let him go.

836
01:27:51,008 --> 01:27:52,668
Take me!

837
01:27:54,218 --> 01:27:57,808
I am ready to redeem him.

838
01:28:03,938 --> 01:28:07,688
You are ready to redeem him?

839
01:28:09,688 --> 01:28:11,198
Yes.

840
01:28:14,118 --> 01:28:18,198
Are you sure you understand
what you're taking upon yourself...

841
01:28:18,578 --> 01:28:20,568
...in doing this?

842
01:28:30,008 --> 01:28:31,378
Very well.

843
01:28:36,548 --> 01:28:38,298
You are free.

844
01:28:40,178 --> 01:28:41,918
But I warn you...

845
01:28:42,558 --> 01:28:45,048
...if you make any further inquiries...

846
01:28:45,268 --> 01:28:49,278
...or if you say a single word
to anyone...

847
01:28:49,478 --> 01:28:52,198
...about what you have seen...

848
01:28:52,398 --> 01:28:56,908
...there will be the most
dire consequences for you...

849
01:28:57,158 --> 01:28:59,148
...and your family.

850
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:02,998
Do you understand?

851
01:29:42,788 --> 01:29:45,328
What is going to happen to that woman?

852
01:29:46,168 --> 01:29:49,198
No one can change her fate now.

853
01:29:50,128 --> 01:29:52,758
When a promise has been made here...

854
01:29:53,668 --> 01:29:56,168
...there is no turning back.

855
01:29:57,428 --> 01:29:58,708
Go!

856
01:32:08,768 --> 01:32:10,228
It's okay.

857
01:32:11,438 --> 01:32:12,898
I'm sorry.

858
01:32:13,438 --> 01:32:17,978
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

859
01:32:18,568 --> 01:32:20,028
Oh, God.

860
01:32:21,108 --> 01:32:24,028
I just had such a horrible dream.

861
01:32:25,828 --> 01:32:27,408
What time is it?

862
01:32:27,868 --> 01:32:29,748
It's a little after 4.

863
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:34,448
Did you just get home?

864
01:32:37,168 --> 01:32:40,918
It took longer than I thought.

865
01:32:41,338 --> 01:32:43,498
You must be exhausted.

866
01:32:44,138 --> 01:32:47,498
Come on, lie down.

867
01:32:56,228 --> 01:32:58,018
What were you dreaming?

868
01:33:04,198 --> 01:33:07,118
Just these weird things.

869
01:33:07,408 --> 01:33:08,868
What was it?

870
01:33:12,538 --> 01:33:15,208
It was so weird.

871
01:33:17,838 --> 01:33:19,088
Tell me.

872
01:33:40,228 --> 01:33:43,398
We were in a deserted city...

873
01:33:48,408 --> 01:33:50,868
...and our clothes were gone.

874
01:33:52,788 --> 01:33:54,698
We were naked...

875
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:02,918
...and I was terrified...

876
01:34:07,928 --> 01:34:10,338
...and I felt ashamed.

877
01:34:11,428 --> 01:34:13,098
Oh, God...

878
01:34:17,438 --> 01:34:21,478
And I was angry because
I thought it was your fault.

879
01:34:24,068 --> 01:34:28,398
You rushed away to go
find clothes for us.

880
01:34:32,828 --> 01:34:36,778
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

881
01:34:41,038 --> 01:34:43,038
I felt wonderful.

882
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:52,208
Then I was lying
in a beautiful garden...

883
01:34:52,758 --> 01:34:55,928
...stretched out naked
in the sunlight...

884
01:35:00,858 --> 01:35:03,778
...and a man walked out of the woods.

885
01:35:07,988 --> 01:35:12,278
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

886
01:35:14,998 --> 01:35:16,828
The naval officer.

887
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:23,918
He stared at me...

888
01:35:28,878 --> 01:35:31,038
...and then he just laughed.

889
01:35:33,968 --> 01:35:36,128
He just laughed at me.

890
01:35:52,408 --> 01:35:54,238
But that's not the end...

891
01:35:55,328 --> 01:35:56,528
...is it?

892
01:36:02,328 --> 01:36:04,658
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

893
01:36:10,548 --> 01:36:12,508
It's too awful.

894
01:36:14,348 --> 01:36:16,218
It's only a dream.

895
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:43,778
He was kissing me...

896
01:36:50,218 --> 01:36:53,048
...and then we were making love.

897
01:36:58,058 --> 01:37:01,558
Then there were all these
other people around us...

898
01:37:01,768 --> 01:37:04,598
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

899
01:37:04,808 --> 01:37:07,358
Everyone was fucking.

900
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:14,738
And then I...

901
01:37:17,828 --> 01:37:20,318
I was fucking other men.

902
01:37:21,038 --> 01:37:22,748
So many...

903
01:37:24,328 --> 01:37:27,168
...I don't know how many I was with.

904
01:37:30,298 --> 01:37:35,178
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

905
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:40,928
...just fucking all these men.

906
01:37:45,398 --> 01:37:48,108
I wanted to make fun of you...

907
01:37:49,858 --> 01:37:52,268
...to laugh in your face.

908
01:37:55,568 --> 01:38:00,538
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

909
01:38:14,628 --> 01:38:17,798
That must have been
when you woke me up.

910
01:39:02,058 --> 01:39:03,518
Shit!

911
01:39:40,588 --> 01:39:42,668
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

912
01:39:50,148 --> 01:39:51,398
Anything else?

913
01:39:52,688 --> 01:39:54,428
No, thank you.

914
01:40:01,238 --> 01:40:02,658
Excuse me.

915
01:40:03,658 --> 01:40:06,828
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Cafe?

916
01:40:07,038 --> 01:40:10,458
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

917
01:40:14,998 --> 01:40:19,498
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

918
01:40:19,718 --> 01:40:22,678
He's playing piano
over there right now.

919
01:40:22,968 --> 01:40:24,468
Nick Nightingale?

920
01:40:24,888 --> 01:40:27,458
Sure, he comes in here.

921
01:40:30,268 --> 01:40:33,058
Look, maybe you can help me...

922
01:40:33,268 --> 01:40:36,888
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

923
01:40:38,108 --> 01:40:39,858
Do you know where he's staying?

924
01:40:43,528 --> 01:40:46,618
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

925
01:40:46,828 --> 01:40:49,198
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

926
01:40:49,498 --> 01:40:51,958
I'm actually an old friend of his.

927
01:40:53,538 --> 01:40:55,038
Well, doctor...

928
01:40:57,548 --> 01:41:01,158
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

929
01:41:04,178 --> 01:41:06,088
To be perfectly honest...

930
01:41:08,388 --> 01:41:10,138
...it's a medical matter.

931
01:41:10,558 --> 01:41:14,848
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

932
01:41:42,128 --> 01:41:43,048
Excuse me.

933
01:41:44,758 --> 01:41:46,968
Hi! How can I help you?

934
01:41:47,178 --> 01:41:50,928
Can you please ring
Mr.Nightingale's room for me?

935
01:41:51,468 --> 01:41:55,088
I'm sorry, sir, Mr.Nightingale
has already checked out.

936
01:41:55,348 --> 01:41:56,858
He checked out?

937
01:42:00,938 --> 01:42:04,858
- Did he leave a forwarding address?
- No, I'm afraid not.

938
01:42:06,198 --> 01:42:08,018
When did he check out?

939
01:42:09,528 --> 01:42:11,488
About 5:00 this morning.

940
01:42:11,748 --> 01:42:13,078
5:00?

941
01:42:14,788 --> 01:42:16,698
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

942
01:42:16,918 --> 01:42:19,708
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

943
01:42:23,798 --> 01:42:26,718
Did you notice anything...

944
01:42:27,048 --> 01:42:28,508
...I don't know...

945
01:42:29,178 --> 01:42:32,218
...unusual about him when he left?

946
01:42:34,228 --> 01:42:35,638
Unusual?

947
01:42:37,228 --> 01:42:39,218
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

948
01:42:40,768 --> 01:42:42,148
No, I'm an old friend of his.

949
01:42:42,358 --> 01:42:43,468
Really?

950
01:42:43,938 --> 01:42:45,448
I'm a doctor.

951
01:42:48,738 --> 01:42:53,078
- Well, Bill...?
- Sure.

952
01:42:55,458 --> 01:42:58,378
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

953
01:42:58,628 --> 01:43:01,958
...because there was something
a little strange...

954
01:43:02,168 --> 01:43:04,658
...about the way Mr.Nightingale left.

955
01:43:05,008 --> 01:43:07,378
Really? What was that?

956
01:43:15,558 --> 01:43:20,108
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a.m...

957
01:43:20,688 --> 01:43:22,598
...with two men.

958
01:43:23,608 --> 01:43:25,318
Big guys.

959
01:43:25,858 --> 01:43:28,818
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

960
01:43:29,028 --> 01:43:32,698
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

961
01:43:32,948 --> 01:43:34,688
...if you know what I mean.

962
01:43:37,498 --> 01:43:38,958
Anyways...

963
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:45,038
...I noticed Mr.Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

964
01:43:45,798 --> 01:43:50,708
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

965
01:43:51,718 --> 01:43:52,888
Scared?

966
01:43:55,638 --> 01:43:57,268
He said he wanted to check out.

967
01:43:57,478 --> 01:44:01,398
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

968
01:44:01,688 --> 01:44:05,558
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

969
01:44:06,318 --> 01:44:10,488
When they came back, Mr.Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

970
01:44:10,698 --> 01:44:12,408
But they saw it and took it...

971
01:44:12,658 --> 01:44:15,538
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

972
01:44:15,788 --> 01:44:20,328
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

973
01:44:21,168 --> 01:44:23,658
And then they just
took him off in a car.

974
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:27,288
Do you have any idea where they went?

975
01:44:27,708 --> 01:44:29,588
No, not a clue.

976
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:43,888
I certainly appreciate your help.

977
01:44:44,108 --> 01:44:45,728
Anytime, Bill.

978
01:45:21,855 --> 01:45:24,605

Oh, the good doctor!

979
01:45:26,315 --> 01:45:31,285

- Was your outfit a success?
- Yes, it was. Thank you.

980
01:45:31,825 --> 01:45:33,105

Good, good.

981
01:45:33,325 --> 01:45:38,315

Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

982
01:45:40,915 --> 01:45:44,665

I think you forgot the mask.

983
01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:47,465

It's not there?

984
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:50,965

Maybe you left it at the party?

985
01:45:56,015 --> 01:45:57,585

I don't think so.

986
01:45:59,555 --> 01:46:03,095

I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

987
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:04,315

Sure.

988
01:46:08,615 --> 01:46:10,485

Here we are.

989
01:46:12,035 --> 01:46:16,115

That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

990
01:46:16,325 --> 01:46:19,775

...25 for the mask. Sorry...

991
01:46:22,545 --> 01:46:24,195

Three hundred seventy-five.

992
01:46:26,835 --> 01:46:28,115

Yes, dear?

993
01:46:28,465 --> 01:46:29,925

Come, come.

994
01:46:31,175 --> 01:46:34,125

Would you like to say hello
to Dr.Harford?

995
01:46:43,435 --> 01:46:46,275

Thank you, Mr.Milich.
I'll call you soon.

996
01:46:47,195 --> 01:46:49,095

Goodbye, gentlemen.

997
01:46:49,405 --> 01:46:52,655

- Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
- And you too.

998
01:46:53,615 --> 01:46:55,855

Well, Dr.Harford...

999
01:46:57,115 --> 01:46:58,705

...here is your receipt.

1000
01:47:00,035 --> 01:47:02,275

I'm tearing up your deposits...

1001
01:47:03,455 --> 01:47:05,785

...and thanks for the business.

1002
01:47:10,385 --> 01:47:13,665

Mr.Milich, last night...

1003
01:47:16,465 --> 01:47:18,875

...you were going to call the police.

1004
01:47:20,435 --> 01:47:24,515

Things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1005
01:47:24,725 --> 01:47:29,695

And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1006
01:47:30,315 --> 01:47:32,065

...anything at all...

1007
01:47:33,065 --> 01:47:35,615

...it needn't be a costume.

1008
01:48:03,311 --> 01:48:04,571
Come in.

1009
01:48:06,281 --> 01:48:09,031
- Tuna salad and black coffee.
- Thanks.

1010
01:48:10,071 --> 01:48:13,111
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1011
01:48:13,321 --> 01:48:18,291
I think it's just Mrs.Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs.Kominski at 4.

1012
01:48:18,661 --> 01:48:22,881
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not going to be able to see them.

1013
01:48:23,131 --> 01:48:26,801
Please ask Dr.Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1014
01:48:27,011 --> 01:48:28,911
...and make new appointments.
- Sure.

1015
01:48:29,381 --> 01:48:33,471
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1016
01:48:33,681 --> 01:48:35,011
No problem.

1017
01:52:24,781 --> 01:52:27,451
Any calls for me?

1018
01:52:27,661 --> 01:52:31,611
Dr.Sanders and Mrs.Shapiro.

1019
01:52:32,921 --> 01:52:35,381
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, Daddy.

1020
01:52:36,251 --> 01:52:38,211
Look, I got all these right.

1021
01:52:38,421 --> 01:52:40,411
You got all of those right?

1022
01:52:40,971 --> 01:52:42,721
Every single one of them?

1023
01:52:43,091 --> 01:52:44,381
That's good.

1024
01:52:44,601 --> 01:52:46,181
You hungry?

1025
01:52:47,271 --> 01:52:48,601
Sort of.

1026
01:52:48,811 --> 01:52:50,601
Want to eat at 7?

1027
01:52:50,811 --> 01:52:53,141
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1028
01:52:53,351 --> 01:52:57,311
I have some appointments
at the office.

1029
01:52:57,531 --> 01:52:59,571
You have to go out again tonight?

1030
01:52:59,781 --> 01:53:00,781
I'm afraid so.

1031
01:53:00,991 --> 01:53:04,491
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1032
01:53:05,121 --> 01:53:07,581
We'll see about that, okay?

1033
01:53:10,161 --> 01:53:12,241
He could be a watchdog...

1034
01:53:12,461 --> 01:53:13,961
We'll see.

1035
01:53:14,171 --> 01:53:16,921
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1036
01:53:17,171 --> 01:53:20,761
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1037
01:53:20,971 --> 01:53:25,601
And Mike has $ 1.75.

1038
01:53:25,801 --> 01:53:29,471
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1039
01:53:29,681 --> 01:53:32,011
$0.75?

1040
01:53:33,941 --> 01:53:37,311
So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

1041
01:53:41,071 --> 01:53:44,321
"How much more" means that
it would be a subtraction.

1042
01:53:44,531 --> 01:53:47,581
Yeah, because you're going
to be taking. Right.

1043
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:51,151
And there were all these
other people around us.

1044
01:53:51,541 --> 01:53:54,001
Hundreds of them, everywhere.

1045
01:53:54,501 --> 01:53:56,741
Everyone was fucking.

1046
01:53:57,671 --> 01:54:01,171
And then I...
I was fucking other men.

1047
01:54:02,551 --> 01:54:04,221
So many...

1048
01:54:04,681 --> 01:54:07,641
...I don't know how many I was with.

1049
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:47,861
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1050
01:56:18,521 --> 01:56:19,381
What is it?

1051
01:56:19,641 --> 01:56:20,841
Domino?

1052
01:56:21,191 --> 01:56:23,061
No, she's not in.

1053
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:29,241
Are you expecting her back soon?

1054
01:56:29,451 --> 01:56:30,951
No, I'm not.

1055
01:56:37,581 --> 01:56:41,001
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

1056
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:43,161
Just a minute.

1057
01:56:50,221 --> 01:56:52,011
Can I say who it's from?

1058
01:56:53,511 --> 01:56:55,891
Well, just tell her it's from...

1059
01:56:56,931 --> 01:56:57,931
...Bill.

1060
01:56:58,521 --> 01:56:59,771
You're Bill?

1061
01:57:01,351 --> 01:57:05,361
The Bill? You're the doctor
who was here last night?

1062
01:57:06,401 --> 01:57:08,861
Well, I suppose I am.

1063
01:57:09,191 --> 01:57:11,491
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1064
01:57:12,821 --> 01:57:13,911
Did she?

1065
01:57:16,741 --> 01:57:18,731
Why don't you come in for a second?

1066
01:57:21,791 --> 01:57:22,821
Sure.

1067
01:57:43,601 --> 01:57:45,101
I'm Sally.

1068
01:57:45,861 --> 01:57:47,731
Hello, Sally.

1069
01:57:50,781 --> 01:57:55,771
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

1070
01:57:59,331 --> 01:58:01,291
I have no idea.

1071
01:58:02,211 --> 01:58:04,201
You have no idea?

1072
01:58:09,711 --> 01:58:14,681
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

1073
01:58:16,931 --> 01:58:19,761
She may not even be coming back?

1074
01:58:40,491 --> 01:58:41,661
I...

1075
01:58:45,081 --> 01:58:46,201
You...?

1076
01:58:46,461 --> 01:58:50,841
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

1077
01:58:51,301 --> 01:58:52,461
Really?

1078
01:58:54,221 --> 01:58:57,011
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

1079
01:58:57,221 --> 01:59:00,501
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

1080
01:59:04,561 --> 01:59:06,851
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1081
01:59:12,481 --> 01:59:15,361
Why don't you have a seat?

1082
01:59:16,071 --> 01:59:17,861
Let's sit down.

1083
01:59:34,011 --> 01:59:38,331
- I don't quite know how to say this.
- You don't quite know how?

1084
01:59:42,721 --> 01:59:46,511
Well, considering that you
were with Domino last night...

1085
01:59:49,061 --> 01:59:53,481
...I think it would be only fair to you
to let you know...

1086
01:59:56,611 --> 01:59:59,901
...that she got the results
of a blood test this morning...

1087
02:00:00,111 --> 02:00:03,371
...and it was HIV-positive.

1088
02:00:14,421 --> 02:00:16,251
HIV-positive?

1089
02:00:31,691 --> 02:00:36,571
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1090
02:00:43,781 --> 02:00:46,791
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1091
02:00:59,801 --> 02:01:02,511
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1092
02:01:03,011 --> 02:01:04,921
A cup of coffee maybe?

1093
02:01:13,611 --> 02:01:15,021
No, thank you.

1094
02:01:19,781 --> 02:01:21,361
I think...

1095
02:01:22,701 --> 02:01:24,611
...maybe I'd better be going.

1096
02:03:13,561 --> 02:03:15,141
- Taxi!
- Off duty.

1097
02:05:04,961 --> 02:05:08,011
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1098
02:05:08,211 --> 02:05:10,011
I'll bring it over to you.

1099
02:05:10,221 --> 02:05:11,381
Thank you.

1100
02:06:51,441 --> 02:06:52,731
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1101
02:06:52,941 --> 02:06:54,401
I'm Dr.Harford.

1102
02:06:54,651 --> 02:06:58,991
One of my patients was admitted
this morning. Miss Amanda Curran.

1103
02:06:59,201 --> 02:07:01,281
Could you please
give me her room number?

1104
02:07:01,491 --> 02:07:05,281
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

1105
02:07:05,671 --> 02:07:08,241
Curran. Amanda Curran.

1106
02:07:08,461 --> 02:07:10,621
C-U-R-R-A-N?

1107
02:07:15,221 --> 02:07:17,041
Miss Amanda Curran?

1108
02:07:17,841 --> 02:07:19,131
That's right.

1109
02:07:19,891 --> 02:07:23,341
I'm sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

1110
02:07:27,401 --> 02:07:29,271
She died this afternoon?

1111
02:07:29,651 --> 02:07:32,981
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

1112
02:07:33,441 --> 02:07:34,901
I'm sorry.

1113
02:08:23,081 --> 02:08:25,701
Because it could cost me my life...

1114
02:08:26,661 --> 02:08:28,711
...and possibly yours.

1115
02:10:14,561 --> 02:10:16,361
Yes, this is Dr.Harford.

1116
02:10:18,531 --> 02:10:19,811
Tonight?

1117
02:10:20,531 --> 02:10:22,651
No, no, that's okay.

1118
02:10:26,741 --> 02:10:29,741
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

1119
02:10:53,391 --> 02:10:54,681
Come in.

1120
02:10:56,731 --> 02:11:00,431
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

1121
02:11:00,731 --> 02:11:03,441
- Let me have your coat.
- I was out anyway. Thank you.

1122
02:11:03,651 --> 02:11:05,071
How about a drink?

1123
02:11:05,611 --> 02:11:07,491
- Are you having one?
- Sure.

1124
02:11:07,951 --> 02:11:09,371
What would you like?

1125
02:11:09,831 --> 02:11:11,111
Just a little scotch.

1126
02:11:11,331 --> 02:11:12,361
Good.

1127
02:11:14,371 --> 02:11:15,541
How do you take it? Neat?

1128
02:11:15,751 --> 02:11:16,861
Please.

1129
02:11:18,631 --> 02:11:20,791
That was a terrific party
the other night.

1130
02:11:21,001 --> 02:11:24,791
- Alice and I had a wonderful time.
- Well, good.

1131
02:11:25,761 --> 02:11:27,551
It was great seeing you both.

1132
02:11:27,761 --> 02:11:29,221
Cheers.

1133
02:11:29,931 --> 02:11:31,351
Were you playing?

1134
02:11:31,811 --> 02:11:35,091
No, I was just
knocking a few balls around.

1135
02:11:36,351 --> 02:11:39,061
- Beautiful scotch.
- That's a 25-year-old.

1136
02:11:39,311 --> 02:11:41,771
- I'll send you over a case.
- No, please.

1137
02:11:41,981 --> 02:11:42,981
Why not?

1138
02:11:46,451 --> 02:11:48,601
You feel like playing?

1139
02:11:48,821 --> 02:11:52,161
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

1140
02:11:54,701 --> 02:11:56,161
I was just...

1141
02:11:58,961 --> 02:12:00,071
Listen...

1142
02:12:06,671 --> 02:12:11,641
The reason I asked you
to come over is...

1143
02:12:13,561 --> 02:12:15,971
...I need to talk to you
about something.

1144
02:12:16,851 --> 02:12:18,101
Sure.

1145
02:12:21,311 --> 02:12:22,941
It's a little bit awkward.

1146
02:12:25,611 --> 02:12:28,491
And I have to be completely frank.

1147
02:12:30,701 --> 02:12:32,741
What kind of problem are you having?

1148
02:12:37,371 --> 02:12:39,451
It isn't a medical problem.

1149
02:12:45,171 --> 02:12:46,551
Actually...

1150
02:12:48,471 --> 02:12:50,371
...it concerns you.

1151
02:13:03,441 --> 02:13:06,481
I know what happened last night.

1152
02:13:10,491 --> 02:13:14,111
And I know what's been
going on since then.

1153
02:13:18,791 --> 02:13:22,131
And I think you just might...

1154
02:13:23,541 --> 02:13:26,961
...have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

1155
02:13:40,271 --> 02:13:42,731
I'm sorry, Victor, I...

1156
02:13:44,731 --> 02:13:47,931
What in the hell
are you talking about?

1157
02:13:50,071 --> 02:13:52,741
Please, Bill, no games.

1158
02:13:54,911 --> 02:13:56,371
I was there.

1159
02:13:58,331 --> 02:13:59,871
At the house.

1160
02:14:03,461 --> 02:14:06,541
I saw everything that went on.

1161
02:14:18,431 --> 02:14:22,381
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1162
02:14:26,061 --> 02:14:29,401
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1163
02:14:30,571 --> 02:14:32,231
...how you'd heard about it...

1164
02:14:32,451 --> 02:14:36,061
...let alone got yourself
through the door.

1165
02:14:39,911 --> 02:14:44,871
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

1166
02:14:45,081 --> 02:14:48,341
...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1167
02:14:49,301 --> 02:14:52,301
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1168
02:14:56,761 --> 02:14:58,601
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1169
02:15:00,391 --> 02:15:01,931
It was mine.

1170
02:15:02,391 --> 02:15:04,381
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1171
02:15:04,771 --> 02:15:08,271
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1172
02:15:08,481 --> 02:15:11,191
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

1173
02:15:11,401 --> 02:15:14,361
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

1174
02:15:22,041 --> 02:15:23,951
What can I say?

1175
02:15:30,301 --> 02:15:31,631
I had...

1176
02:15:33,131 --> 02:15:34,721
...absolutely...

1177
02:15:35,631 --> 02:15:40,291
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

1178
02:15:41,721 --> 02:15:43,801
I know you didn't, Bill.

1179
02:15:45,731 --> 02:15:47,771
But I also know that you...

1180
02:15:48,771 --> 02:15:51,351
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

1181
02:15:51,611 --> 02:15:53,361
...and talked to the desk clerk.

1182
02:15:54,941 --> 02:15:56,571
How do you know that?

1183
02:15:58,571 --> 02:16:00,621
Because I had you followed.

1184
02:16:06,541 --> 02:16:08,251
You had me followed?

1185
02:16:10,631 --> 02:16:12,951
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1186
02:16:13,341 --> 02:16:15,251
All right? I owe you an apology.

1187
02:16:15,471 --> 02:16:18,181
This was for your own good, believe me.

1188
02:16:18,591 --> 02:16:22,601
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1189
02:16:22,851 --> 02:16:26,051
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1190
02:16:26,431 --> 02:16:30,221
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1191
02:16:30,771 --> 02:16:32,681
...banging Mrs.Nick.

1192
02:16:34,031 --> 02:16:37,281
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1193
02:16:39,361 --> 02:16:42,531
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1194
02:16:43,621 --> 02:16:46,581
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1195
02:16:47,411 --> 02:16:51,541
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1196
02:16:52,961 --> 02:16:55,091
Who do you think those people were?

1197
02:16:55,761 --> 02:16:57,881
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1198
02:16:58,091 --> 02:17:01,431
If I told you their names...
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1199
02:17:01,641 --> 02:17:05,391
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1200
02:17:09,021 --> 02:17:11,151
Was it the second password?

1201
02:17:12,521 --> 02:17:14,271
Is that what gave me away?

1202
02:17:16,401 --> 02:17:18,641
Yes, finally.

1203
02:17:20,741 --> 02:17:23,061
But not because you didn't know it.

1204
02:17:24,991 --> 02:17:27,911
It's because there was
no second password.

1205
02:17:29,121 --> 02:17:33,631
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1206
02:17:33,841 --> 02:17:36,331
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1207
02:17:36,591 --> 02:17:40,291
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1208
02:17:40,511 --> 02:17:43,631
...made out to you-know-who.

1209
02:18:01,361 --> 02:18:04,811
There was a woman there...

1210
02:18:10,621 --> 02:18:12,421
...who tried to warn me.

1211
02:18:18,091 --> 02:18:19,341
I know.

1212
02:18:25,091 --> 02:18:26,841
Do you know who she was?

1213
02:18:40,861 --> 02:18:42,571
She was a hooker.

1214
02:18:52,121 --> 02:18:53,791
Sorry, but...

1215
02:18:54,961 --> 02:18:56,951
...that's what she was.

1216
02:19:01,381 --> 02:19:02,551
A hooker.

1217
02:19:17,401 --> 02:19:19,861
Suppose I told you...

1218
02:19:21,531 --> 02:19:24,451
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1219
02:19:25,951 --> 02:19:30,081
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1220
02:19:30,291 --> 02:19:33,041
...her last-minute intervention...

1221
02:19:33,251 --> 02:19:37,031
...suppose I said that all of that...

1222
02:19:38,421 --> 02:19:41,091
...was staged.

1223
02:19:43,211 --> 02:19:47,081
That it was a kind of charade.

1224
02:19:48,681 --> 02:19:50,641
That it was fake.

1225
02:19:55,231 --> 02:19:56,601
Fake?

1226
02:19:58,351 --> 02:20:00,931
Yes. Fake.

1227
02:20:12,451 --> 02:20:14,361
Why would they do that?

1228
02:20:15,211 --> 02:20:16,461
Why?

1229
02:20:17,751 --> 02:20:19,421
In plain words...

1230
02:20:20,341 --> 02:20:22,881
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1231
02:20:24,051 --> 02:20:27,471
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1232
02:20:27,971 --> 02:20:29,681
...and what you'd seen.

1233
02:20:49,781 --> 02:20:51,371
Have you seen this?

1234
02:21:08,721 --> 02:21:10,711
Yes, I have.

1235
02:21:16,181 --> 02:21:19,311
I saw her body in the morgue.

1236
02:21:28,111 --> 02:21:31,311
Was she the woman at the party?

1237
02:21:43,631 --> 02:21:45,091
She was.

1238
02:21:59,351 --> 02:22:01,931
The woman lying dead in the morgue...

1239
02:22:03,941 --> 02:22:05,821
...was the woman at the party.

1240
02:22:14,491 --> 02:22:19,371
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1241
02:22:20,251 --> 02:22:23,751
You called it a fake, a charade.

1242
02:22:25,381 --> 02:22:28,741
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1243
02:22:29,011 --> 02:22:32,841
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1244
02:22:38,771 --> 02:22:43,391
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1245
02:22:43,601 --> 02:22:46,401
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1246
02:22:46,651 --> 02:22:50,101
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1247
02:22:51,361 --> 02:22:55,031
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1248
02:22:55,241 --> 02:22:59,821
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1249
02:23:00,041 --> 02:23:03,651
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1250
02:23:03,871 --> 02:23:06,911
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1251
02:23:08,341 --> 02:23:12,751
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1252
02:23:13,381 --> 02:23:15,091
...and the rest is in the paper.

1253
02:23:15,301 --> 02:23:19,001
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1254
02:23:19,221 --> 02:23:23,431
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1255
02:23:24,811 --> 02:23:29,771
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1256
02:23:30,111 --> 02:23:31,781
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1257
02:23:31,991 --> 02:23:35,851
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1258
02:23:52,761 --> 02:23:56,891
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1259
02:23:57,301 --> 02:23:59,971
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1260
02:24:01,431 --> 02:24:03,761
But life goes on.

1261
02:24:04,181 --> 02:24:05,601
It always does...

1262
02:24:05,851 --> 02:24:07,311
...until it doesn't.

1263
02:24:08,941 --> 02:24:10,821
But you know that, don't you?

1264
02:27:35,481 --> 02:27:37,971
I'll tell you everything.

1265
02:27:43,401 --> 02:27:45,701
I'll tell you everything.

1266
02:28:37,541 --> 02:28:39,751
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1267
02:28:56,641 --> 02:29:00,941
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1268
02:29:25,711 --> 02:29:26,801
That's nice.

1269
02:29:27,051 --> 02:29:29,621
I could put Sabrina in here.

1270
02:29:30,391 --> 02:29:32,791
It's really pretty.

1271
02:29:33,011 --> 02:29:35,001
It's old-fashioned.

1272
02:29:44,151 --> 02:29:45,401
He's big.

1273
02:29:45,611 --> 02:29:49,031
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1274
02:29:49,241 --> 02:29:50,491
You do?

1275
02:29:52,821 --> 02:29:54,981
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1276
02:30:09,171 --> 02:30:11,221
What do you think we should do?

1277
02:30:16,391 --> 02:30:17,851
What do I think we should do?

1278
02:30:18,101 --> 02:30:19,381
Look, Mommy!

1279
02:30:28,741 --> 02:30:31,401
What do I think?
I don't know.

1280
02:30:33,571 --> 02:30:35,371
I mean, maybe...

1281
02:30:47,381 --> 02:30:50,881
Maybe I think...

1282
02:30:51,591 --> 02:30:53,921
...we should be grateful.

1283
02:30:59,931 --> 02:31:01,511
Grateful...

1284
02:31:02,061 --> 02:31:07,051
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1285
02:31:07,941 --> 02:31:09,651
...adventures...

1286
02:31:12,071 --> 02:31:14,451
...whether they were real...

1287
02:31:14,951 --> 02:31:17,191
...or only a dream.

1288
02:31:26,461 --> 02:31:30,301
Are you sure of that?

1289
02:31:34,221 --> 02:31:35,841
Am I sure?

1290
02:31:51,651 --> 02:31:53,391
Only as sure as I am...

1291
02:31:53,611 --> 02:31:57,481
...that the reality of one night...

1292
02:31:58,781 --> 02:32:01,621
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1293
02:32:04,121 --> 02:32:06,581
...can ever be the whole truth.

1294
02:32:13,341 --> 02:32:15,331
And no dream is ever...

1295
02:32:17,221 --> 02:32:19,011
...just a dream.

1296
02:32:27,481 --> 02:32:29,551
The important thing is...

1297
02:32:31,441 --> 02:32:33,151
...we're awake now...

1298
02:32:34,491 --> 02:32:36,811
...and hopefully...

1299
02:32:39,871 --> 02:32:42,081
...for a long time to come.

1300
02:32:45,751 --> 02:32:47,251
Forever.

1301
02:32:49,421 --> 02:32:50,881
Forever?

1302
02:32:53,211 --> 02:32:54,711
Forever.

1303
02:32:57,091 --> 02:33:00,711
Let's not use that word. You know?

1304
02:33:02,061 --> 02:33:04,021
It frightens me.

1305
02:33:14,281 --> 02:33:17,391
But I do love you...

1306
02:33:20,531 --> 02:33:22,191
...and you know...

1307
02:33:23,371 --> 02:33:25,531
...there is something very important...

1308
02:33:25,751 --> 02:33:28,461
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1309
02:33:29,791 --> 02:33:31,071
What's that?

1310
02:33:34,251 --> 02:33:35,711
Fuck.
