你呢?  还是在当医生吗?
How about you? You still in the doctor business?

78
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,850
你也知道他们是怎么说的  "一日为医  终生为医"
You know what they say, "Once a doctor, always a doctor."

96
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,930
他最后不是孤单一人...
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

97
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,890
把眼睛都哭瞎了...
crying his eyes out...

98
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,860
最后被流放到寒冷北方?
in some place with a very bad climate?

99
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,980
不过他之前过得很风流啊

喔  真可悲
Oh, how sad.

104
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,130
不过我想  他应该不介意我们共舞
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man who wouldn't mind if we danced.

105
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,100
你是做什么的  艾莉丝?
What do you do, Alice?

106

你不认为婚姻最迷人的地方...
Don't you think one of the charms of marriage...

118
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,210
就是两方都有欺瞒的必要吗?
is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?

119
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,720
你是个美丽的女人...
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

120
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,890
可以拥有大厅里任何一个男人  为何要结婚?
who could have any man in this room, wants to be married?

121
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,850
为什么不呢?
Why wouldn't she?

122
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,690
有那么糟糕吗?
Is it as bad as that?

123
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,360
好得不得了
As good as that.

124
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,900
你认识诺拉·温莎吗?

128
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,800
你不记得我了  对不对?
You don't remember me, do you?

129
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,550
你曾经对我非常亲切
You were very kind to me once.

130
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,550
曾经?  听起来真是糟糕

- 有东西跑进你眼里  - 第五大道上一半的东西
- And you got something in your eye. - Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

134
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,280
你真是位绅士  你把你的手帕给我...
You were such a gentleman! You gave me your handkerchief...

135

有时我就是这种英雄
Well, that is the kind of hero I can be sometimes.

137
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,460
你知道从前女人为何结婚吗?
You know why women used to get married, don't you?

138
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,170
何不由你来告诉我呢?
Why don't you tell me?

139
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,920
这是她们唯一能失去童贞的方法...
It was the only way they could lose their virginity...

140
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,930
然后才能够跟其他男人做想做的事
and be free to do what they wanted with other men.

141
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,180
她们真正想要的男人
The ones they really wanted.

142
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,770
真有意思
Fascinating.

143
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,570
你知道医生为什么迷人吗?
Do you know what's so nice about doctors?

144
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,620
其实不如外界想象得好
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

145
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,040
他们看起来总是...
They always seem so...

146
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,460
学识渊博
knowledgeable.

147
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,340
喔  非常学识渊博...
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

148
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,380
在所有的事情上
about all sorts of things.

149
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,470
不过我想他们工作太认真了
But I bet they work too hard.

150
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,810
错过了那么多乐趣
Just think of all they miss.

151
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,060
你说的可能没错
You're probably right.

152
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,860
女士们  我们到底要去哪儿?
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

153
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,070
说真的?
Exactly?

154
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,990
彩虹的尽头
Where the rainbow ends.

155
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,530
彩虹的尽头?
Where the rainbow ends?

156
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,160
难道你不想去彩虹的尽头?
Don't you wanna go where the rainbow ends?

157
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,500
那要看在哪里而定
Now that depends where that is.

158
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,380
让我们一起去探索吧
Well, let's find out.

159
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,420
抱歉  女士们  哈福医生  打扰一下
Excuse me, ladies. Sorry, Dr. Harford.

160
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,920
可以跟我来一下吗?  纪格勒先生有事找你
Could you come with me for a moment? Something for Mr. Ziegler.

161
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,430
好吧
Fine.

162
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,600
待会儿再继续?
To be continued?

163
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,870
来了
Yeah.

164
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,500
比尔  谢谢你过来
Bill, thanks for coming.

165
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,340
我们有点小意外
We had a little accident here.

166
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,130
怎么了?
What happened?

167
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,590
她...
Well, she was...

168
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,260
她打了一针  就倒下去了
She was shooting up and she had a bad reaction.

169
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,220
她注射了什么?
What did she take?

170
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,730
高速球还是雪球什么的
A speedball or a snowball or whatever the hell they call it.

171
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,810
就是海洛英加可卡因
It's heroin and coke.

172
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,780
海洛英加可卡因?
Heroin and coke?

173
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,570
还有别的吗?
Anything else?

174
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,490
我们还喝了几杯香槟  就这样了
We had a couple of drinks, some champagne. That was it.

175
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,660
她这样有多久了?
How long has she been like this?

176
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,370
大概有五六分钟吧  我想
Maybe five minutes, six minutes, something like that.

177
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,710
她叫什么名字?
What's her name?

178
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,920

你听得到我吗  曼蒂?
Can you hear me, Mandy?

182
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,440
你听得到我吗?  如果你听得到我就摇摇头
Can you hear me? Move your head if you can hear me.

183
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,070
如果你听得到我就摇摇头  曼蒂  很好
Move your head if you can hear me, Mandy. There you go.

Can you open your eyes for me? Mandy, can you do that?

186
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,330
让我看看你的眼睛  很好  加油
Let me see you open your eyes. There you go, come on.

187
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,450
加油  看着我  看着我

看着我  看着我  曼蒂
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

190

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,010
很好

我还没看过
I haven't.

197
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,200

198
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,500

你知道吗?
You know that?

214
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,180
我知道

215

你这次没事
You're gonna be okay this time.

216
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,070
不过你不能继续这样做
But you can't keep doing this.

217
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,280
懂吗?
You understand?

218
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,110
明白

219
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,580
你必须去戒毒所  你知道吧?
You're gonna need some rehab. You know that, don't you?

221
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,790

223
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,150
这一切就交给你了
I'll leave the rest to you.

224
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,060
她可以穿上衣服离开了吗?
Is it okay if I dress her and get her out of here?

225
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,980
不行  我会再观察她一个小时
No, I'd keep her here for another hour.

226
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,690
再一个小时?
Another hour?

227
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,490
然后再派人带她回家
Then I'd have someone take her home.

228
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,740
好的

233
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,300
我知道我不必多说...
I know I don't have to mention this...

234
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,430
你也知道这是我俩的秘密
but this is just between us, okay?

235
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,180

我想我喝太多香槟了
I think I've had a little too much champagne.

I think I have to go and find my husband now.

239
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,140
不过我想他一个人应该也没问题
But I'm sure he'll be all right on his own a little longer.

240
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,060
没错...
Yes...

241
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,060

你知道你不必走
You don't, you know.

happen to...

280
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,300
上她们?
fuck them?

281
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,260
什么?
What?

282
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,890
你在说什么啊?
What are you talking about?

283
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,560
我说的是那两个...
I'm talking about the two girls...

284
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,730
你着迷得不得了的女孩
that you were so blatantly hitting on.

285
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,450
我对她们没有兴趣
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

286
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,490
她们是谁?
Who were they?

287
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,460
只是两个模特
They were just a couple of models.

288
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:34,050
还有你为什么跟她们一起消失这么久?
And where did you disappear to with them for so long?

289
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,260
等等
Wait a minute.

290
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,560
我没有跟谁一起消失
I didn't disappear with anybody.

291
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,070
纪格勒身体不舒服...
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

292
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,740
我被叫上楼去看他
and I got called upstairs to see him.

293
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,540
那你自己又在跟谁跳舞?
Anyway, who was the guy you were dancing with?

294
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,590
纪格勒夫妇的朋友
A friend of the Zieglers.

295
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,670
他想要什么?
What did he want?

296
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,970
他想要什么?
What did he want?

297
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
他想要什么?
What did he want?

298
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,310
去楼上...
Sex...

299
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,270
做爱
upstairs.

300
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,230
当时当地
Then and there.

301
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,240
就这样?
Is that all?

302
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,160
对  就这样
Yeah, that was all.

303
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,120
只是想要上我老婆
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

304
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,960
没错
That's right.

305
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,630
我可以理解
Well, I guess that's understandable.

306
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,800
可以理解?
Understandable?

307
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,800
因为你是个...
Because you are a very...

308
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,060
非常美丽的女人
very beautiful woman.

309
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,520
等等
Wait. So...

310
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,190
只因为我是个美丽的女人...
because I'm a beautiful woman...

311
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,700
所以男人愿意跟我说话...
the only reason any man ever wants to talk to me...

312
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,910
只是因为他想上我  你是这个意思?
is because he wants to fuck me. Is that what you're saying?

313
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,330
我想事情不像你说的那么简单...
Well, I don't think it's quite that black and white...

314
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:36,380
不过我们都知道男人是什么德行
but I think we both know what men are like.

315
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,390
所以基本上...
So on that basis...

316
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,520
我也可以假设你想搞那两个模特
I should conclude that you wanted to fuck those two models.

317
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,520
我是例外
There are exceptions.

318
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:56,110
为什么你是例外?
And what makes you an exception?

319
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,530
我是例外  因为...
What makes me an exception is that...

320
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,160
我刚好很爱你
I happen to be in love with you.

321
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,870
因为我们已经结婚了...
And because we're married...

322
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,340
而且我绝不会对你说谎...
and because I would never lie to you...

323
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,590
或伤害你
or hurt you.

324
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,390
所以你的意思是...
Do you realize that what you're saying...

325
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,900
你不上那两个模特的原因...
is that the only reason you wouldn't fuck those models...

326
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,730
是为了我着想?
is out of consideration for me?

327
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,980
而不是因为你不想
Not because you really wouldn't want to.

328
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,110
放轻松  艾莉丝
Let's just relax, Alice.

329
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,910
大麻让你容易激动
This pot is making you aggressive.

330
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,540
不  不是大麻  是你
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

331
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,370
你为什么就不能给我一个直接的答案呢?
Why can't you ever give me a straight fucking answer?

332
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,170
我以为我给的就是直接答案啊
I was under the impression that's what I was doing.

333
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,590
我已经搞不清楚我们在吵什么了
I don't even know what we're arguing about here.

334
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,010
我不是在吵架
I'm not arguing.

335
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,260
我只是想知道你话里的含义
I'm just trying to find out where you're coming from.

336
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,220
我话里的含义?
Where I'm coming from?

337
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,570
假设...
Let's say--

338
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:14,400
假设来说好了  有个大美女...
Let's say, for example, you have some gorgeous woman...

339
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,730
裸体站在你办公室里...
standing in your office naked...

340
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,610
你正在摸她的乳房
and you're feeling her fucking tits.

341
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,610
我想知道的是...
Now, what I wanna know...

342
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,790
我想知道当你抓着乳房时  你在想什么
I wanna know what you're thinking about when you're squeezing them.

343
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,170
艾莉丝  我是个医生
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

344
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,960
这非常公事化...
It's all very impersonal...

345
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,760
而且旁边一定有护士
and you know there's always a nurse present.

346
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,140
你是说  当你摸她的乳房时  你想的只有你的专业态度?
So when you're feeling tits, it's nothing more than your professionalism?

347
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,430
没错
Exactly.

348
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,180
当我帮病人看诊时  我绝对不会想到性
Sex is the last thing on my mind when I'm with a patient.

349
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,610
那当她的小乳头被你挤弄时...
Now, when she is having her little titties squeezed...

350
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,110
难道你不认为她可能正幻想着...
do you think she ever has fantasies...

351
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,610
英俊比尔医生的小弟弟长什么样吗?
about what handsome Dr. Bill's dickie might be like?

352
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,990
拜托  我可以向你保证  这个他妈的虚构女病人...
Come on, I can assure you sex is the last thing...

353
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,420
心里想的绝对不可能是性
on this fucking hypothetical woman patient's mind.

354
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,580
你为什么这么肯定?
And what makes you so sure?

355
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,630
如果没有其他原因...
If for no better reason...

356
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,140
她可能只是害怕我将要告诉她的诊断
because she's afraid of what I might find.

357
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,860
好吧
Okay, okay.

358
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,810
那当你告诉她一切都没事以后  接下来呢?
So after you tell her that everything's fine, what then?

359
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,230
接下来怎样?
What then?

360
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,860
我不知道  艾莉丝...
I don't know, Alice...

361
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,690
接下来怎样?
What then?

362
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,990
听着
Look,

363
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,530
女人不会...
women don't...

364
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,240
女人基本上不会有那种想法
They basically just don't think like that.

365
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,080
百万年的进化  是吗?
Millions of years of evolution, right?

366
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,670
是吗?
Right?

367
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,420
男人就得到处找洞插...
Men have to stick it every place they can...

368
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,840
而女人呢  只关心安全跟承诺...
but for women, it is just about security and commitment...

369
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,300
还有其他什么鬼的
and whatever the fuck else!

370
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,260
有点过于简化  艾莉丝  不过大概就是那样
A little oversimplified, Alice. But yes, something like that.

371
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,440
你们男人真是搞不懂
If you men only knew.

372
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:21,900
我知道你只是头脑发昏  想要跟我吵架...
What I do know is you got stoned, you tried to pick a fight...

373
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,240
而现在你又想让我嫉妒
and now you're trying to make me jealous.

374
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,570
不过你不是会嫉妒的类型  对吧?
But you're not the jealous type, are you?

375
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,990
没错  我不是
No, I'm not.

376
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,280
你从来不会为我感到嫉妒  对吧?
You've never been jealous about me, have you?

377
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,490
没错  从来没有
No, I haven't.

378
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,160
那你为什么从没为我感到嫉妒过?
And why haven't you ever been jealous about me?

379
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,380
我不知道  艾莉丝  也许因为你是我老婆
Well, I don't know, Alice. Maybe because you're my wife.

380
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,920
也许因为你是我孩子的母亲...
Maybe because you're the mother of my child...

381
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,920
我知道你绝不会对我不忠
and I know you would never be unfaithful to me.

382
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,430
你对你自己真是有信心啊...
You are very, very sure of yourself...

383
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,970
不是吗?
aren't you?

384
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,600
不
No.

385
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,140
我是对你有信心
I'm sure of you.

386
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,280
你觉得很好笑吗?
Do you think that's funny?

387
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,000
好吧  去他的
All right. Fuck it.

388
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,590
现在我们开始笑了吗?
Now we get the fucking laughing fit, right?

389
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,470
你...
Do you...?

390
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,310
你还记得去年夏天在鳕角吗?
Do you remember last summer at Cape Cod?

391
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
记得
Yes.

392
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,370
你还记得有天晚上在餐厅...
Do you remember one night in the dining room...

393
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,740
有个年轻的海军军官...
there was this young naval officer...

394
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,500
他跟其他两位军官坐在我们隔壁桌?
and he was sitting near our table with two other officers?

395
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,080
不记得
No.

396
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,920
服务生给他捎来一张纸条  他就离开了
The waiter brought him a message, at which point he left.

397
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,800
完全没印象吗?
Nothing rings a bell?

398
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
没有
No.

399
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,770
嗯...
Well...

400
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,770
我那天早上在大厅第一次见到他
I first saw him that morning in the lobby.

401
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,190
他刚要登记进旅馆...
He was checking into the hotel...

402
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,950
他跟着拉着行李的门僮...
and he was following the bellboy with his luggage...

403
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,620
走向电梯
to the elevator.

404
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,580
他看了我一眼  然后走过去  只是一眼
He glanced at me as he walked past. Just a glance.

405
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,550
就这样
Nothing more.

406
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,060
但我几乎...
But I could hardly...

407
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,230
动弹不得
move.

408
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,490
那天下午...
That afternoon...

409
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,830
女儿海莲娜跟她的朋友去看电影...
Helena went to the movies with her friend...

410
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,830
而你跟我则在做爱
and you and I made love.

411
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:33,260
我们为未来做了计划...
And we made plans about our future...

412
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,430
还谈到了女儿海莲娜
and we talked about Helena.

413
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,850
不过...
And yet...

414
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,640
我从头到尾...
at no time...

415
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,610
想的只有...
was he ever...

416
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,610
他
out of my mind.

417
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:04,960
我想如果他要我...
And I thought if he wanted me...

418
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,290
即使只是...
even if it was only...

419
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,760
一夜情...
for one night...

420
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,760
我也愿意放弃一切
I was ready to give up everything:

421
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,810
你
You...

422
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,980
海莲娜
Helena...

423
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,320
我他妈的未来
my whole fucking future.

424
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,160
一切
Everything.

425
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,080
实在很奇怪  因为在那个时候...
And yet it was weird, because at the same time...

426
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,000
对我来说  没有什么比你来得重要
you were dearer to me than ever.

427
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,590
在当时  我对你的爱...
And at that moment, my love for you...

428
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,520
是既温柔...
was both...

429
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,980
又悲伤
tender and sad.

430
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,540
我当晚几乎睡不着...
I barely slept that night...

431
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,790
我第二天早上醒来  感到惊恐
and I woke up the next morning in a panic.

432
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,920
我不知道我是担心他已经离开...
I didn't know whether I was afraid that he had left...

433
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,760
还是担心他还在那儿
or that he might still be there.

434
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,350
但到了晚餐时间...
But by dinner...

435
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,820
我才知道他已经走了...
I realized he was gone...

436
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,410
我感到...
and I was...

437
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,450
松了一口气
relieved.

438
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,730
喂?
Hello.

439
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,280
是  我是哈福医生
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

440
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,370
什么时候发生的?
When did it happen?

441
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,600
不  不用了
No, no.

442
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,100
我知道地址
I have the address.

443
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,960
谢谢
Thank you.

444
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,800
路·耐森刚刚去世
Lou Nathanson just died.

445
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,360
我得去一趟  露个面
I think I have to go over there and show my face.

446
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,040
- 你好  罗莎  - 晚上好  哈福医生

448

玛莉安...

451
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,200
哈福医生...

452
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,700
你能来真好
How good of you to come.

453
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,370
我一听到消息就赶来了
I came as soon as I got the message.

454
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,830
- 谢谢  - 我...

455
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,040

456
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,050
你的父亲...
Your father was...

457
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,010
他是个勇敢的人
He was a very brave man.

458
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,260
喔  谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

459
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,720
你还好吗?
How are you holding up?

460
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,730
我有点麻痹
I'm a bit numb.

461
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,060
我想我还不能接受
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

462
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,440
你要不要先坐下?
Would you like to sit down?

463
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,470
感觉很不真实
It's so unreal.

464
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,680
爹地今天过得很好
Daddy had such a good day.

465
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,400
他神智清醒  记得很多事
His mind was clear, and he remembered so many things.

466
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,610
然后他吃了一点晚餐...
Then he had a little dinner...

467
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,240
说他想睡一下
and he said he felt like taking a nap.

468
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,460
我进厨房跟罗莎说了不到半小时的话...
I went into the kitchen and talked to Rosa for half an hour at most...

469
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,920
当我走进来时  他已经...
and when I went to see how he was...

470
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,420
我以为他只是睡着了
I just thought he was asleep.

471
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,300
然后我...
Then I...

472
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,430
然后我才发现  他呼吸已经停了
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

473
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,260
玛莉安...
Marion,

474
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,850
从你告诉我的过程...
from what you've said...

475
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,110
我相信你父亲是在睡眠中安详过世的
I'm sure your father died peacefully in his sleep.

476
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,030
天呐  我希望是
Oh, God, I hope so.

477
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,200
我想我担心他去世的方式...
I think I've been more afraid of the way it was going to happen...

478
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,040
远超过担心他去世
than his death itself.

479
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,590
你打电话给其他亲戚了吗?
Have you had a chance to phone any of your relatives?

480
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,220
我试着打给我在伦敦的继母  不过她不在
I tried to call my stepmother in London, but she was out.

481

My boyfriend, Carl, is making some calls...

482
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,680
他很快就会过来

483
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,310
我想你见过卡尔几次
I think you've met Carl here a few times.

484
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,740
是的  我记得  他是老师  对吧?
Yes, I remember him. He's a teacher, isn't he?

485
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,990
数学教授
A math professor.

486
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,700
我们即将在五月结婚

493
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,900
这对你可能是很棒的改变  玛莉安
It really could be a wonderful change for you, Marion.

494
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,630
我的天  不...

玛莉安  我想你不知道...
Marion, I don't think you realize--

500
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,250
我懂
I do.

501
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:17,510
即使我再也见不到你  至少我也要离你近一点
Even if I'm never to see you again, I want at least to live near you.

502
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,300
玛莉安  听我说...

507
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,490

Listen to this. She had a red rose in her mouth.

532

She was doing a Mexican lap dance right in my face.

I'm serious! I got scars on the back of my neck.

What team's this switch hitter playing for?

You wanna take a ride in this fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

540

549
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,690

By yourself?

561
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,010
不  我有个室友  不过她不在家
No. I have a roommate, but she's not home.

562
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,980
不会有事的
Hey, it's okay.

563
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,810
没有人会打扰我们
Listen, no one will bother us.

564
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,310
没关系  进来吧
It's okay. Come on.

565
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,150
来吧
Come on.

566
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,720
就是这儿
This is it.

567
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,390
树还不错
That's a nice tree.

568
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:09,400
抱歉有点乱  女佣今天休息
Sorry about the mess. Maid's day off.

569

很舒适的地方

572
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,420

It's okay.

573
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,810
那么...
So...

574
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,650
我们应该先谈价钱吧?
Do you suppose we should talk about money?

575
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,910
也对
Yeah, I guess so.

576
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,700
要看你想做什么而定
That depends on what you wanna do.

577
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,750
你想做什么?
What do you wanna do?

578
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,750

我宁愿不要说出来
I'd rather not put it into words.

582
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,830
让我帮你决定  怎么样?
How about you just leave it up to me?

583
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,080
- 我是你的人了  - 好吧
- I'm in your hands. - Okay.

584
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,580
一百五怎样?
And how does 150 sound?

585
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,090
非常好
Sounds wonderful.

586
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:59,970
别担心  我不计时
Don't worry. I don't keep track of the time.

591
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,860
那么...
So...

592
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,530
可以开始了吗?
shall we?

593
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,340
抱歉
Excuse me.

594

00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,240
还好  我只是...
Yeah. I was...

598
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,570
我只是在想  你还要在那边待多久?
I was just wondering if you were gonna be much longer.

599
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,120
我现在不方便说话
Listen, it's a little difficult to talk right now.

600
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,750
大概还要一点时间
It could be a while.

601
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,460
你知道要多久吗?
Any idea how long?

602
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,720
不  我不知道
No, I don't really know.

603
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,890
我们还在等其他亲戚到
We're still waiting for some relatives to arrive.

604
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:10,140
那我要去睡了

605
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,850
好的  再见
Okay. Bye-bye.

那是比尔医生太太?
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

607
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,590
是的
Yes. Yes.

608
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,020
你得走了吗?
Do you have to go?

609
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,440
我得走了吗?
Do I have to go?

610
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,740
我想是的
I think I do.

611
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,990
你确定?
Are you sure?

612
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,370
恐怕是的
Yes, I'm afraid so.

613
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,510
不过我还是想付你钱

你之前说多少?  一百五?

00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,850
不过说真的  不必麻烦了
But you know what? You don't have to bother about that.

617
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,520
不  没关系
No, it's all right.

618

640
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
没关系  反正今天乐团表现很差

你不知道?
You don't?

662
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:17,700
不  听来也许荒谬  不过每次都在不同的地方...
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's in a different place every time...

663
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:20,740
而且之前我都只待一个小时左右

Nick, I'm sorry. Is there something I'm missing here?

668

我蒙着眼睛弹
I play blindfolded.

669

你在卖关子
You're putting me on.

672
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,820
不  我是说真的
No, it's the truth.

673
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:03,450
上次的蒙眼布绑得不够紧
And the last time, the blindfold wasn't on so well.

674
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:07,540
老天
Oh, man.

675

677
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,880
没看过这种事...
never anything like this...

678
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:21,680
也没看过那么棒的女人
and never such women.

679
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,100
好吧
Well...

680

I know where that is.

684
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,320

（费德里欧）

690
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,890
这是什么?
What is this?

691
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,110
这是贝多芬的歌剧  对吧?
It's the name of a Beethoven opera, isn't it?

692
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,110
尼克
Nick.

693
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,570
这是暗语
It's the password.

暗语?
The password?

695
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:26,700
我很抱歉  必须把你丢在这儿  比尔
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry to do this to you, Bill.

696
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:31,580
我真的得走了...
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

697
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,920
尼克
Nick...

698
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:40,590
你知道我绝不可能...
you know there is no way on earth...

699
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,600
就这样让你走  带我跟你去
that you are going to leave here without taking me with you.

700
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,930
- 拜托  饶了我吧  - 尼克  听我说
- Come on, buddy, give me a break. - Nick, I'll tell you what.

Just give me the address. I'll go there by myself...

703
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,280
我们之间完全没有关联

704
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:07,160
听着  即使我愿意...
Listen, let's just say for one second...

假设我愿意
that I was prepared to do that.

你穿的衣服也不可能让你进得去
You couldn't get in anyway in those clothes.

707
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,500
为什么?
Why not?

708
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,220
因为所有人都穿戴着戏服跟面具
Because everyone is always costumed and masked.

709
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,760
你怎么可能在这种时候租得到戏服跟面具?
Where the hell are you gonna get a costume at this hour?

710
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,870
谢谢  零钱不必找了
Thanks. Keep the change.

我完全不知道
I wasn't aware of that.

731
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,700
那你是彩虹时尚店的现任老板啰?
Then are you the present owner of Rainbow Fashions?

732
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:16,540

768
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,680
当医生的难道不想要色彩丰富一点的斗篷吗?
The good doctor wouldn't like something more colorful?

769
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,560
- 我想不了  - 小丑  警察  海盗?
- I don't think so. - Clowns, officers, pirates?

我最近掉发很严重
It's starting to fall down too fast.

777

我想这恐怕不是我的领域
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

782
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,050
什么?  你帮不了我?
What? You can't help me?

783
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:18,890
你应该要找发理学家  看头发的专科医生
No. You should see a trichologist. It's a hair specialist.

784
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:22,720
米里区先生  说真的  现在时间已经很晚了
Mr. Milich, I've obviously left things a bit late tonight.

你有听见什么声音吗?
Did you hear something?

789
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,150
嗯
Mm.

790
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,240
那是什么?
What is this?

791
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,300
（彩虹）

792
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,760

793
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,800
在搞什么?
What is this?

794
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,200
这里到底发生了什么鬼事?
What on earth is going on here?!

795
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,530
米里区  让我解释
Milich, I can explain everything.

796
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:22,030
你  你在这里做什么?
You! What are you doing here?

797
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,040
我一定要杀了你
I promise I'll kill you!

798
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,120
还有你  难道你完全没有羞耻心吗?
And you! Have you no sense of decency?

799
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:32,170
两位  难道你们完全没有羞耻心吗?
Gentlemen, have you no sense of decency?!

800
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,880
米里区  你疯了吗?
Milich, are you crazy?

801
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:36,060
是这位年轻小姐请我们来的
We were invited here by the young lady.

802
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,210
年轻小姐?  那是我女儿
Young lady? This is my daughter!

803
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,590
难道你看不出来她只是个孩子?
Couldn't you see she's a child?

804
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,600
- 你最好去跟警察解释  - 警察?
- You will have to explain to police! - To the police?!

805
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,640
你这小贱货  我要杀了你
You little whore! I kill you for this.

806
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:50,400
我发誓我会杀了你
I promise, I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

807
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,810
请帮我把那小女孩抓住
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

808
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,940
米里区  岂有此理
Milich, this is preposterous.

809
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:56,990
这位年轻小姐邀请我们来的
The young lady invited us here.

810
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:59,280
你们看不出来她已经疯了吗
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

811
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:01,160
医生  很抱歉让你久等
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

812
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,160
各位  这已经是警察的事了
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

813
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,950
请在此等候  直到我回来
You will please stay here until I return.

814
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,830
让我们出去
Let us out of here!

815
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,960
那是不可能的
That's out of the question.

816
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,800
医生  不好意思  你说你要什么颜色的?
Doctor, sorry, what color did you say?

817
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,590
- 黑色?  - 黑色
- Black? - Black.

818
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:20,840
两位  请有点礼貌  好吗?  安静下来
Gentlemen, please have the goodness to be quiet for the moment!

819
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,300
难道没看到我在招呼客人?
Couldn't you see I try to serve my customer?

820
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:24,510
对不起
Sorry.

821
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:28,600
还有你  小贱货  马上去睡觉  邪恶的东西
And you, little whore, go to bed at once, you depraved creature.

822
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,230
等我招呼好这位先生  我就来好好地修理你
I'll deal with you ater I serve this gentleman.

823
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,900
你应该穿镶白鼬皮边的斗篷
You should have a cloak lined with ermine.

824
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,730
（佳节愉快）

825
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,800
好  一共是七十四块半

827

这是八十块

828
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:34,390

如果你等我  我就给你一百块
I'll make that a hundred, if you wait for me.

830
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,860
让计价表继续跑
Just let the meter run.

831
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:45,450
我给你另一半钞票  再加上计价表的钱
I'll give you the other half plus the meter when I get back.

832
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:48,280

01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,920
- 好吗?  - 好吧
- Okay? - Okay.

836
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,310
晚上好  先生
Good evening, sir.

837
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,520
晚上好
Good evening.

838
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,520
有什么我能为您效劳的吗?
Can we be of any help?

839
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:22,190
我想你要的是暗语
I suppose you'd like the password.

840
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,030
是的  先生
If you'd like, sir.

841
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,360
费德里欧
Fidelio.

842
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:28,570
谢谢您  先生  我们会带路
Thank you, sir. We'll run you up to the house.

843
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,320
晚上好  先生
Good evening, sir.

844
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:11,870
晚上好
Good evening.

845
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,740
暗语是?
Password, sir?

846
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,620
费德里欧
Fidelio.

847
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,620
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

848
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:26,030
我不知道你以为你在干什么
I'm not sure what you think you're doing.

849
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,280
不过你不属于这儿
But you don't belong here.

850
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:34,080
很抱歉  不过我想你认错人了
I'm sorry, but I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

851
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:40,460
拜托  别傻了
Please! Don't be foolish.

852
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,920
你必须立刻离开
You must go now.

853
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,970
你是谁?
Who are you?

854
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,390
我是谁不重要
It doesn't matter who I am.

855
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,350
你现在非常危险
You are in great danger.

856
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:58,100
趁现在还有机会快点走
You must get away while there's still a chance.

857
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,400
抱歉  能不能麻烦您让我们单独谈谈?
Would you be so good as to excuse us for a moment?

858
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,880
你玩得开心吗?
Have you been enjoying yourself?

859
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:12,420
我到处看看  觉得很有趣
Well, I've had a very interesting look around.

860
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:18,600
你想跟我去一个更私密的地方吗?
Do you wanna go somewhere a little more private?

861
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,060
私密?
Private?

862
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:27,480
也许是个好主意
That might be a good idea.

863
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:32,440
你在这里啊  我到处在找你
Oh, here you are. I've been looking all over for you.

864
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,410
我可以把他借走几分钟吗?
May I borrow him for just a few minutes?

865
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:39,120
我保证马上带他回来
I promise to bring him right back.

866
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:52,210
我想你不知道自己现在多危险
I don't think you realize the danger you're in now.

867
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:54,470
你骗不了他们多久的
You can't fool them for much longer.

868
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,640
你得在一切都太迟之前赶快离开
You've got to get away before it's too late.

869
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:01,640
你为什么要告诉我这些?
Why are you telling me this?

870
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,810
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

871
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,140
你是谁?
Who are you?

872
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:11,070
你不需要知道  不过你得走了  快
You don't want to know. But you must go. Now!

873
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,440
你能跟我来吗?
Will you come with me?

874
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:16,400
不可能
That's impossible.

875
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:17,660
为什么?
Why?

876
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:22,080
因为这会赔上我的生命  可能还有你的
Because it could cost me my life and possibly yours.

877
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:25,160
- 让我看你的脸  - 不行
- Let me see your face. - No!

878
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:27,960
快走
Go!

879
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:31,750
抱歉  先生
Excuse me, sir.

880
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,340
在外面等的计程车是您的吗?
Are you the gentleman with the taxi waiting for him?

881
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,010
是的
Yes.

882
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:45,430
您的司机正在门口  急需跟您说话
Your driver's at the front door and would urgently like a word with you.

883
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:51,170
请向前来
Please, come forward.

884
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,700
请告诉我们暗语  好吗?
May I have the password, please?

885
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:30,790
费德里欧
Fidelio.

886
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:36,000
没错  那是暗语...
That's right, sir. That is the password...

887
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:38,000
大门专用的
for admittance.

888
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,720
不过  您知道房子的暗语是什么吗?
But may I ask, what is the password for the house?

889
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:52,650
房子的暗语?
The password for the house?

890
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,730
是的
Yes.

891
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:05,160
很抱歉  我...
I'm sorry, I...

892
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,370
我好像...
I seem to have...

893
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,670
忘记了
forgotten it.

894
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,800
真是不巧
That's unfortunate.

895
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:26,590
因为在这里  不论是忘记...
Because here, it doesn't matter whether you have forgotten it...

896
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:29,680
或根本不知道
or if you never knew it.

897
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:35,020
都必须卸下面具
You will kindly remove your mask.

898
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:56,790
现在...
Now...

899
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,130
请卸下衣物
get undressed.

900
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,760
卸下衣物?
Get undressed?

901
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:13,140
脱下你的衣服
Remove your clothes.

902
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:28,030
各位...
Gentlemen, please...

903
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:33,620
脱下你的衣服
Remove your clothes.

904
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:37,710
还是你要我们帮你脱?
Or would you like us to do it for you?

905
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:40,330
住手
Stop!

906
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:49,010
让他走
Let him go.

907
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:52,720
让我来
Take me!

908
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:57,810
我愿意替他赎罪
I am ready to redeem him.

909
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:07,740
你愿意替他赎罪?
You are ready to redeem him?

910
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,200
是的
Yes.

911
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:18,210
你知道如果这么做...
Are you sure you understand what you're taking upon yourself...

912
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,540
你会被怎么处置吗?
in doing this?

913
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,880
知道
Yes.

914
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:31,390
非常好
Very well.

915
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,310
你可以走了
You are free.

916
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:41,900
不过我警告你...
But I warn you...

917
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,110
如果你再继续调查...
if you make any further inquiries...

918
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,320
或跟任何人提到...
or if you say a single word to anyone...

919
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:52,240
你今晚所见到的...
about what you have seen...

920
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:56,910
你跟你家人的下场...
there will be the most dire consequences for you...

921
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,160
将惨不忍睹
and your family.

922
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:03,040
你了解吗?
Do you understand?

923
01:29:42,830 --> 01:29:45,290
那女人会被如何处置?
What is gonna happen to that woman?

924
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:49,210
没有人能改变她的命运
No one can change her fate now.

925
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:52,800
在这里立下的承诺...
When a promise has been made here...

926
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,220
绝不可能改变
there is no turning back.

927
01:29:57,470 --> 01:29:58,760
快走
Go!

928
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:33,130
（海莲娜）

929
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,180
艾莉丝
Alice.

930
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,760
艾莉丝
Alice.

931
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:10,270
没事了  没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

932
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,940
对不起
I'm sorry.

933
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:18,030
对不起把你吵醒  我以为你在做恶梦
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought you were having a nightmare.

934
01:32:18,570 --> 01:32:20,070
天呐
Oh, God.

935
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,080
我做了一个可怕的梦
I just had such a horrible dream.

936
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,450
现在几点了?
What time is it?

937
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,750
刚过四点
It's a little after 4.

938
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,500
- 你刚到家?  - 对
- Did you just get home? - Yes.

939
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:40,970
比我预期的还要久
It took longer than I thought.

940
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:43,510
你一定累坏了
You must be exhausted.

941
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:49,140
来  躺下来吧
Come on, lie down. Lie down.

942
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,990
你梦到什么?
What were you dreaming?

943
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,450
就是一些...
It's Just...

944
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,160
一些诡异的事
Just these weird things.

945
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:08,830
什么事?
What was it?

946
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,250
感觉好诡异
It was so weird.

947
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,130
告诉我
Tell me.

948
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:37,730
我们...
We were...

949
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:43,450
我们在一座荒废的城市里...
We were in a deserted city...

950
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:50,910
我们的衣服都不见了
and our clothes were gone.

951
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,750
我们裸着身体...
We were naked...

952
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,880
我好害怕...
and I was terrified...

953
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,890
而且我...
and I...

954
01:34:07,890 --> 01:34:10,390
我又觉得羞耻
and I felt ashamed.

955
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,140
天呐...
Oh, God...

956
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:21,490
我好生气  因为我觉得那是你的错
And I was angry because I thought it was your fault.

957
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:28,410
你跑去帮我们找衣服
You rushed away to go find clothes for us.

958
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:36,830
你一不见  情况就不一样了
As soon as you were gone, it was completely different.

959
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:43,090
我觉得好舒畅
I felt wonderful.

960
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:52,270
然后我躺在一座美丽的花园里...
Then I was lying in a beautiful garden...

961
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:55,940
全身赤裸伸展在阳光下...
stretched out naked in the sunlight...

962
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,780
一个男人从树林中走出来
and a man walked out of the woods.

963
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:12,330
就是我跟你说过的  在旅馆遇见的男人
He was the man from the hotel, the one I told you about.

964
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,830
海军军官
The naval officer.

965
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:23,920
他看着我...
He stared at me...

966
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:31,100
然后大笑
and then he just laughed.

967
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,140
他嘲笑我
He just laughed at me.

968
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:54,240
不过还没结束...
But that's not the end...

969
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:56,580
对吧?
is it?

970
01:35:58,370 --> 01:35:59,370
还没结束
No.

971
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,670
为什么不告诉我后来的情节?
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

972
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:08,180
那...
It's...

973
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:12,550
太恐怖了
It's too awful.

974
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,180
那只是一个梦
It's only a dream.

975
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,840
他吻着我...
He was kissing me...

976
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:53,050
然后我们开始做爱
and then we were making love.

977
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:01,600
我们身边有好多人...
Then there were all these other people around us...

978
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:04,650
上百个人  到处都是
hundreds of them, everywhere.

979
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,400
大家都在乱搞
Everyone was fucking.

980
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,780
然后我...
And then I...

981
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:20,370
我开始搞其他男人
I was fucking other men.

982
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,750
好多人...
So many...

983
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:27,170
我不知道有多少
I don't know how many I was with.

984
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:35,220
你看见我躺在这些男人的臂弯里...
And I knew you could see me in the arms of all these men...

985
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,980
操这些男人
just fucking all these men.

986
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:44,770
而我...
And I...

987
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,110
我想嘲笑你...
I wanted to make fun of you...

988
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:52,280
在你面前大笑
to laugh in your face.

989
01:37:55,620 --> 01:38:00,540
我尽全力笑你
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

990
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:17,800
那大概就是你叫醒我的时候
That must have been when you woke me up.

991
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:57,390
（奏鸣曲咖啡馆）

992
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,520
该死
Shit!

993
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:31,440
（吉斯比斯咖啡馆  二十四小时营业）

994
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:39,720
- 你好  - 你好

995
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:42,720
一杯咖啡  谢谢
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

996
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:51,400
还要什么吗?
Anything else?

997
01:39:52,730 --> 01:39:54,480
不了  谢谢
No, thank you.

998
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:02,700
不好意思
Excuse me.

999
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:06,870
你知道隔壁的奏鸣曲咖啡馆何时开门吗?
Do you know when they get in next door at the Sonata Café?

1000
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:10,500
- 我想通常两三点会有人在办公室  - 两三点...
- I think there's usually someone in the office around 2 or 3. - 2 or 3.

1001
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:19,550
我猜你大概不认识尼克·南丁格尔吧?
I don't suppose, by any chance, you know Nick Nightingale?

1002
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,680
他目前在那儿演奏钢琴
He's playing piano over there right now.

1003
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:24,430
尼克·南丁格尔?
Nick Nightingale?

1004
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:27,520
当然  他常来这儿
Sure, he comes in here.

1005
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:33,110
也许你可以帮上忙...
Look, maybe you can help me...

1006
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:36,940
因为我必须跟他联络上
because it's important that I get in touch with him.

1007
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:39,860
你知道他住在哪儿吗?
Do you know where he's staying?

1008
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:41,610
嗯...
Well...

1009
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:46,660
我想我不应该随便把他的地址给人
I don't know if he'd want me to give out his address.

1010
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:49,210
没关系  我是医生
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

1011
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,960
我其实是他的老朋友
I'm actually a very old friend of his.

1012
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:55,090
呃  医生...
Well, doctor...

1013
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:01,220
他今晚有演出  你不能等吗?
he'll be playing there tonight. Can't it wait until then?

1014
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,020
听着
Listen,

1015
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:06,140
说实话...
to be perfectly honest...

1016
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:10,140
是跟病情有关
it's a medical matter.

1017
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:14,900
检验结果  我想他会希望能赶快知道
Some tests. I know he'll wanna know about them as soon as possible.

1018
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,500
（旅馆）

1019
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,130
抱歉

Can you please ring Mr. Nightingale's room for me? Nick Nightingale.

I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale has already checked out.

1023

1024
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:04,860
- 他有留下地址吗?  - 恐怕没有
- Did he leave a forwarding address? - No, I'm afraid not.

1025
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,030
他何时退房的?
When did he check out?

1026
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,540
大概今晨五点
About 5:00 this morning.

1027
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:13,200
- 五点?  - 对

1028
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:16,750
不会太早了吗?
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

1029
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,710
是有点早  没错
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

1030
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,010
那么...
Look...

1031
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,720
当他走时  你有没有注意到...
did you notice anything...

1032
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:28,510
不知道...
I don't know...

1033
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:32,230
什么不寻常的地方?
unusual about him when he left?

1034
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:35,650
不寻常?
Unusual?

1035
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:39,770
- 你该不会是警察吧?  - 不
- Hey, you're not Five-O, are you? - No.

1036
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,190
不  我是他朋友
No, I'm an old friend of his.

1037
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,490
真的?
Really?

1038
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,410
我是个医生
I'm a doctor.

1039
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:53,120
- 可以叫你比尔吗?  - 当然
- Well, Bill...? - Sure.

1040
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:58,420
你问这问题真是有趣  比尔...
It's funny you should ask that question, Bill...

1041
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:01,960
因为南丁格尔先生离开时...
because actually there was something a little strange...

1042
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,720
的确有些不寻常
about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

1043
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:07,430
真的吗?  发生了什么事?
Really? What was that?

1044
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:20,150
他大约在今晨四点半进来...
He came in this morning, about 4:30 a. m...

1045
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:22,610
跟两个男人
with two men.

1046
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:25,360
非常壮硕
Big guys.

1047
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:28,870
他们穿着体面  谈吐得体
They were very well-dressed and very well-spoken.

1048
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:32,740
不过你绝对不会想招惹他们...
But they weren't the kind of people you'd fool around with...

1049
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:34,750
你知道我意思吧
if you know what I mean.

1050
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,000
然后...
Anyways...

1051
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:45,090
我注意到南丁格尔先生脸上有块淤青
I noticed Mr. Nightingale had a bruise on his cheek.

1052
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,720
说实话  我觉得他看起来有点害怕
To be perfectly honest, I also thought he looked a little scared.

1053
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,930
害怕?
Scared?

1054
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,180
对  对
Yes. Yes.

1055
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,310
他说他要退房
He said he wanted to check out.

1056
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:01,400
然后他跟其中一个男人上楼去
And then he went upstairs to his room with one of the men.

1057
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:05,610
另一个男人留在大厅  帮他结帐
The other guy stayed down in the lobby and settled his bill.

1058
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:10,490
当他们回来时  南丁格尔先生想塞给我一封信
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale tried to pass me an envelope.

1059
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,450
不过被发现后  他们拿走了...
But they saw it and took it...

1060
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:15,580
说如果有任何他的邮件或讯息...
and said that any mail or messages for him...

1061
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:20,330
都会有经过授权的人来帮他收件
would be collected by someone properly authorized to do so.

1062
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:23,670
然后他就被带进车里了
And then they just took him off in a car.

1063
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,300
你知道他们去哪里吗?
Do you have any idea where they went?

1064
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,630
不  完全不知道
No, not a clue.

1065
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:39,100
既然如此...
Well, anyway...

1066
01:44:41,730 --> 01:44:43,900
非常感谢你的帮助
I certainly appreciate your help.

1067

Maybe you left it at the party?

1076

我想不可能
I don't think so.

1077

01:52:32,450 --> 01:52:33,850
嗨  亲爱的
Hey, gang.

1118
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,800
- 嗨  爹地  - 嗨
- Hi, Daddy. - Hey.

1119
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
你看  我全都算对了
Look, I got all these right.

1120
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:40,470
- 你全都算对啦?  - 是呀
- You got all of those right? - Yeah.

1121
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:42,640
- 每一题吗?  - 嗯
- Every single one of them? - Mm-hmm.

1122
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,170
真棒
That's good.

1123
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:45,920
你饿了吗?
You hungry?

1124
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:48,380
有点
Sort of.

1125
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:50,380
七点吃饭  好吗?
Wanna eat at 7?

1126
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:52,890
七点?  不能再早一点吗?
Seven? Listen, can we make that earlier?

1127
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:57,060
我办公室还有事
I have some appointments at the office.

1128
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:59,350
你晚上还要出诊?
You have to go out again tonight?

1129
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:00,520
恐怕是
I'm afraid so.

1130
01:53:00,730 --> 01:53:04,270
爹地  我圣诞节礼物可以要一只小狗吗?
Daddy, am I gonna get a puppy for Christmas?

1131
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:07,360
我们再考虑看看  好吗?
We'll see about that, okay?

1132
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:12,030
他可以当看门狗...
He could be a watchdog...

1133
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,700
再看看
We'll see.

1134
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:16,700
来吧  宝贝  把这题做完
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1135
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:20,540
好吧  这是乔  他有两块半
All right, we have Joe. And Joe has $2.50.

1136
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:25,340
麦克有一块钱又七十五分
And Mike has $1.75.

1137
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:29,220
乔比麦克多多少钱?
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1138
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:31,800
七十五分?
$0.75?

1139
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:37,100
所以我们应该用减法还是加法?
So is it gonna be a subtraction or an addition?

1140
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:44,100
"多多少"表示我们应该要用减法
"How much more" means that it would be a subtraction.

1141
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:47,320
因为你要拿走  对
Yeah, because you're gonna be taking... Right.

1142
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:50,900
<i>我们身边都是人</i>
<i>And there were all these other people around us.</i>

1143
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,740
<i>上百个人  到处都是</i>
<i>Hundreds of them, everywhere.</i>

1144
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:56,490
<i>大家都在乱搞</i>
<i>Everyone was fucking.</i>

1145
01:53:57,450 --> 01:54:00,910
<i>我...  我也在搞其他男人</i>
<i>And then I... I was fucking other men.</i>

1146
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:03,920
<i>好多...</i>
<i>So many...</i>

1147
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:07,380
<i>我不知道我跟多少人搞过</i>
<i>I don't know how many I was with.</i>

1148
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:13,820
喂?
Hello.

1149
01:55:15,650 --> 01:55:17,250
喂?
Hello?

1150
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:20,620
喂?
Hello?

1151
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:47,650
零钱留着  圣诞快乐
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1152
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:20,680
- 谁啊?  - 多米诺?
- What is it? - Domino?

1153
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:22,810
她不在
No, she's not in.

1154
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:29,020
你想她很快就会回来吗?
Are you expecting her back soon?

1155
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:30,730
我不认为
No, I'm not.

1156
01:56:34,690 --> 01:56:35,820
好吧
Okay.

1157
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:40,780
我有东西要给她  可以交给你吗?
I have something for her. Can I leave this with you?

1158
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,950
等一下
Just a minute.

1159
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,790
你的大名是...?
Can I say who it's from?

1160
01:56:53,290 --> 01:56:55,670
就跟她说我是...
Well, just tell her it's from...

1161
01:56:56,710 --> 01:56:57,720
比尔
Bill.

1162
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:00,460
- 你是比尔?  - 对
- You're Bill? - Yes.

1163
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:05,140
比尔?  你是昨晚的医生?
The Bill? You're the doctor who was here last night?

1164
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:08,600
我想没错
Well, I suppose I am.

1165
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:11,270
多米诺说你对她很好
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1166
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:13,650
是吗?
Did she?

1167
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:18,530
进来坐一下吧?
Why don't you come in for a second?

1168
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:22,610
好啊
Sure.

1169
01:57:43,390 --> 01:57:44,850
我是莎莉
I'm Sally.

1170
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,640
- 你好  莎莉  - 你好
- Hello, Sally. - Hi.

1171
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:55,480
你知道多米诺何时回来吗?
So do you have any idea when you expect Domino back?

1172
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:58,320
不
No.

1173
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:01,030
不知道
I have no idea.

1174
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:03,990
- 你不知道?  - 对
- You have no idea? - No.

1175
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:14,420
说实话  我想她不会回来了
To be perfectly honest, she may not even be coming back.

1176
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:19,510
她不会回来了?
She may not even be coming back?

1177
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,060
嗯  我...
Well...

1178
01:58:40,190 --> 01:58:41,440
我...
I...

1179
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:46,040
你...?
You...?

1180
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:50,580
我想有些事我得告诉你
I think there's something that I should tell you.

1181
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,750
- 是吗?  - 是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

1182
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,750
不过我不知道...
But I just don't know. I don't know.

1183
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:00,210
你不知道?  那是什么?
You don't know? Well, what is it?

1184
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:06,640
我不知道我该不该告诉你
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1185
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:15,140
先坐下来吧
Why don't you have a seat?

1186
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:17,560
我们先坐下来
Let's sit down.

1187
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:38,080
- 我不知道该怎么说  - 你不知道该怎么说?
- I don't quite know how to say this. - You don't quite know how?

1188
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:46,260
如果你昨晚跟多米诺在一起...
Well, considering that you were with Domino last night...

1189
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:53,270
我想你有权知道...
I think it would be only fair to you to let you know...

1190
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:59,650
她今天早上接到了血液检查的结果...
that she got the results of a blood test this morning...

1191
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:03,110
是HIV阳性（艾滋病）
and it was HIV-positive.

1192
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:16,160
- HIV阳性?  - 对
- HIV-positive? - Yeah.

1193
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:36,310
我感到非常遗憾
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1194
02:00:40,690 --> 02:00:41,940
是啊
Yeah.

1195
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:46,490
那是很大的打击
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1196
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:02,290
你要喝点什么吗?
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1197
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:04,710
咖啡还是...?
A cup of coffee maybe?

1198
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:14,810
不了  谢谢你
No, thank you.

1199
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,100
我想...
I think...

1200
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,400
也许我该走了
maybe I'd better be going.

1201
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:30,940
好的
Okay.

1202
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:15,300
- 计程车  - 下班了
- Taxi! - Off duty.

1203
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:07,750
给我一杯卡布奇诺  谢谢
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1204
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:09,790
我会拿过去给你
I'll bring it over to you.

1205
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,080
谢谢
Thank you.

我请你来的原因是...
The reason I asked you to come over is...

1255
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:15,670
我有话要跟你说
I need to talk to you about something.

1256
02:12:16,590 --> 02:12:17,840
没问题
Sure.

1257
02:12:21,010 --> 02:12:22,680
有点尴尬
It's a little bit awkward.

1258
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:28,230
我必须坦白说
And I have to be completely frank.

1259
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:32,480
你有什么样的问题吗?
What kind of problem are you having?

1260
02:12:37,150 --> 02:12:39,240
不是健康问题
It isn't a medical problem.

1261
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:46,330
实际上...
Actually...

1262
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:50,170
跟你有关
it concerns you.

1263
02:12:58,840 --> 02:12:59,840
比尔...
Bill...

1264
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:06,270
我知道昨晚发生了什么事
I know what happened last night.

1265
02:13:10,230 --> 02:13:13,860
我也知道之后发生了什么事
And I know what's been going on since then.

1266
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:21,910
我想你大概...
And I think you just might...

1267
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:26,740
对某些事有些误解
have the wrong idea about one or two things.

1268
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:42,510
很抱歉  维克特  我...
I'm sorry, Victor, I...

1269
02:13:44,470 --> 02:13:47,720
我搞不懂你到底在说什么?
What in the hell are you talking about?

1270
02:13:49,850 --> 02:13:52,480
拜托  比尔  别装了
Please, Bill, no games.

1271
02:13:54,650 --> 02:13:56,150
我也在那儿
I was there.

1272
02:13:58,110 --> 02:13:59,650
在那房子里
At the house.

1273
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:06,280
我目睹了整个过程
I saw everything that went on.

1274
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:16,130
比尔...
Bill...

1275
02:14:18,210 --> 02:14:22,130
你以为你在搞什么鬼啊?
What the hell did you think you were doing?

1276
02:14:24,130 --> 02:14:25,230
我根本...
I couldn't...

1277
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:29,140
我根本无法想象...
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1278
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:32,020
你是怎么知道这回事...
how you'd even heard about it...

1279
02:14:32,230 --> 02:14:35,860
更不要说  你是怎么通过大门的
let alone got yourself through the door.

1280
02:14:39,690 --> 02:14:44,660
然后我想起  你曾跟那该死的钢琴手聊天...
Then I remembered seeing you with that prick piano player...

1281
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:48,120
叫尼克什么的  管他叫啥鬼名  在我家的派对上
Nick whatever the fuck his name was, at my party.

1282
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:52,000
之后就不难推测了
And it didn't take much to figure out the rest.

1283
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:58,340
那不是尼克的错
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1284
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:01,710
那是我的错
It was mine.

1285
02:15:02,090 --> 02:15:04,180
那当然是尼克的错
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1286
02:15:04,510 --> 02:15:08,050
如果他没跟你提起  这一切都不会发生了
If he hadn't mentioned it to you, none of this would've happened.

1287
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:10,970
我把那杂种推荐给这些人...
I recommended that cocksucker to those people...

1288
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:14,140
他却让我颜面尽失
and he's made me look like a complete asshole.

1289
02:15:18,770 --> 02:15:19,770
维克特...
Victor...

1290
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:23,690
我能说什么?
What can I say?

1291
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:31,410
我...
I had...

1292
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:34,500
完全...
absolutely...

1293
02:15:35,410 --> 02:15:40,040
没想到你会被卷入这件事
no idea you were involved in any way.

1294
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:43,590
我知道你没想到  比尔
I know you didn't, Bill.

1295
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:47,550
不过我也知道...
But I also know that you...

1296
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:51,140
你今早去了尼克的旅馆...
You went to Nick's hotel this morning...

1297
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:53,140
还跟门房打探消息
and talked to the desk clerk.

1298
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:56,350
你怎么知道?
How do you know that?

1299
02:15:58,350 --> 02:16:00,400
因为我派人跟踪你
Because I had you followed.

1300
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:07,990
你派人跟踪我?
You had me followed?

1301
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:12,740
好吧  我很抱歉
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1302
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,040
好吗?  我是该向你道歉
All right? I owe you an apology.

1303
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:17,960
不过那是为你好  相信我
This was for your own good, believe me.

1304
02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:22,380
我知道门房对你说了什么  不过他没告诉你...
I know what the desk clerk told you. But what he didn't tell you is...

1305
02:16:22,590 --> 02:16:25,760
他们只是把尼克架上飞机送回西雅图
all they did was put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1306
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:29,480
现在他大概已经回到家里...
By now he's probably back with his family...

1307
02:16:29,630 --> 02:16:32,390
在操尼克太太了
you know, banging Mrs. Nick.

1308
02:16:33,810 --> 02:16:37,060
门房说他脸上有淤青
The clerk said he had a bruise on his face.

1309
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:42,320
好吧  他脸上是有淤青
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1310
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:46,360
他应得的惩罚比那严重多了
That's a hell of a lot less than he deserves.

1311
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:51,280
比尔  我想你不知道你昨晚惹上的麻烦有多大
Listen, Bill, I don't think you realize what kind of trouble you were in last night.

1312
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:54,870
你以为这些人是谁?
Who do you think those people were?

1313
02:16:55,450 --> 02:16:57,660
他们可不是一般人
Those were not just ordinary people there.

1314
02:16:57,870 --> 02:17:01,170
如果我说出他们的名字...  可我不会告诉你的...
If I told you their names-- I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1315
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:05,170
不过如果我说了  你晚上大概睡不着觉
but if I did, I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1316
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:10,930
是第二道暗语吗?
Was it the second password?

1317
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:13,970
那是泄漏我身份的原因吗?
Is that what gave me away?

1318
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:18,430
是的  你总算懂了
Yes, finally.

1319
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,860
但不是因为你不知道
But not because you didn't know it.

1320
02:17:24,770 --> 02:17:27,650
而是因为根本没有第二道暗语
It's because there was no second password.

1321
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:33,410
况且这些人是坐礼车来的  而你是搭计程车来的...
Of course it didn't help a whole lot that those people arrive in limos...

1322
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:36,120
那也太明显了一点
and you showed up in a taxi.

1323
02:17:36,370 --> 02:17:40,080
加上他们又在你外套里找到戏服租借的收据...
Or that they found the receipt from the rental house in your coat...

1324
02:17:40,290 --> 02:17:43,420
马上就知道你是谁了
made out to you-know-who.

1325
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:54,200
那里...
There was a...

1326
02:17:58,500 --> 02:17:59,700
那里...
There was a...

1327
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:04,610
那里有个女人...
There was a woman there...

1328
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:07,950
她...
who...

1329
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:12,400
曾经想要警告我
tried to warn me.

1330
02:18:17,850 --> 02:18:19,150
我知道
I know.

1331
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:26,800
你知道她是谁吗?
Do you know who she was?

1332
02:18:32,050 --> 02:18:33,250
知道
Yes.

1333
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:37,550
她是个...
She was...

1334
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:42,440
她是个妓女
She was a hooker.

1335
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:53,670
抱歉  不过...
Sorry, but...

1336
02:18:54,740 --> 02:18:56,840
她真的就是个妓女
that's what she was.

1337
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,250
妓女
A hooker.

1338
02:19:11,850 --> 02:19:13,050
比尔...
Bill...

1339
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:19,640
假设说...
suppose I told you...

1340
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:24,190
当时发生的一切...
that everything that happened to you there...

1341
02:19:25,730 --> 02:19:29,860
威胁  女孩的警告...
the threats, the girl's warnings...

1342
02:19:30,070 --> 02:19:32,820
她最后一刻的发言...
her last-minute intervention...

1343
02:19:33,030 --> 02:19:36,780
假设我告诉你  那一切...
suppose I said that all of that...

1344
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:40,830
都是设计好的
was staged.

1345
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:46,870
只是一场戏
That it was a kind of charade.

1346
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:50,380
那都是假的
That it was fake.

1347
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:56,340
假的?
Fake?

1348
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:00,640
是的  假的
Yes. Fake.

1349
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:14,110
他们为什么要那么做?
Why would they do that?

1350
02:20:14,990 --> 02:20:16,150
为什么?
Why?

1351
02:20:17,490 --> 02:20:19,200
简单地说...
In plain words...

1352
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:22,660
就是要把你吓得屁滚尿流
to scare the living shit out of you.

1353
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:27,250
让你不敢再提起你去过哪儿...
To keep you quiet about where you'd been...

1354
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:29,460
还有你看到过什么
and what you'd seen.

1355
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:51,150
你看过这个了吗?
Have you seen this?

1356
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:03,530
（前选美皇后在旅馆用药过量）

1357
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:10,460
知道  我看过了
Yes, I have.

1358
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:19,050
我在太平间看到她尸体了
I saw her body in the morgue.

1359
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:24,560
她是...
Was she...

1360
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:31,060
她是在派对上的那个女人吗?
Was she the woman at the party?

1361
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:40,440
是的
Yes.

1362
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:44,830
她是的
She was.

1363
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:56,710
维克特...
Victor...

1364
02:21:59,130 --> 02:22:01,680
躺在太平间的尸体...
the woman lying dead in the morgue...

1365
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:05,600
就是派对上的那个女人
was the woman at the party?

1366
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:08,770
对
Yes.

1367
02:22:14,230 --> 02:22:19,150
维克特  也许我搞不清楚
Well, Victor, maybe I'm missing something here.

1368
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:23,450
你说这是假的  一场戏
You called it a fake, a charade.

1369
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:28,540
那这是他妈的哪一种戏...
Do you mind telling me what kind of fucking charade...

1370
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:32,620
会有人在戏里真的死掉?
ends with somebody turning up dead?

1371
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:43,180
好吧  比尔  我就直接了当说  好吗?
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit. All right?

1372
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:46,180
你在过去二十四小时内  干了一堆超过你本分的事
You've been way out of your depth for the last 24 hours.

1373
02:22:46,390 --> 02:22:49,850
你想知道这是什么戏吗?  我就告诉你这是什么戏
You wanna know what kind of charade? I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1374
02:22:51,140 --> 02:22:54,770
这出戏从"让我来"的假牺牲开始...
That whole play-acted, "take me" phony sacrifice...

1375
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:59,610
你的乱来与她真正的死因根本毫无关系
that you've been jerking off with had nothing to do with her real death.

1376
02:22:59,820 --> 02:23:03,450
你走了之后  在她身上发生的事  之前也曾发生过
Nothing happened after you left that hadn't happened to her before.

1377
02:23:03,650 --> 02:23:06,700
她已经心智不正常了  就这样
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1378
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:12,500
当他们带她回家后  她还很好...
When they took her home, she was just fine...

1379
02:23:13,150 --> 02:23:14,950
剩下的都在报纸上了
and the rest is in the paper.

1380
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:18,800
她是个毒瘾者  嗑药致死  没什么可疑的
She was a junkie. She OD'd. There was nothing suspicious.

1381
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,300
她的门从内反锁  警方高兴  案子也结了
Her door was locked from the inside. The police are happy. End of story.

1382
02:23:24,590 --> 02:23:29,510
她的死是早晚的事
Come on. It was always gonna be just a matter of time with her.

1383
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:31,600
记得吧  你自己也对她说过
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1384
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:35,800
那个在我房间里嗑药过量的波霸美女?
You remember, the one with the great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1385
02:23:52,490 --> 02:23:56,670
听着  比尔  没有谁杀谁
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1386
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:59,710
有人死了  这种事常有的
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1387
02:24:01,210 --> 02:24:03,610
不过我们还是继续过活
But life goes on.

1388
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:05,400
总是这样...
It always does...

1389
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:07,550
直到我们死去
until it doesn't.

1390
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:10,680
不过你已经知道了  对吧?
But you know that, don't you?

1391

海莲娜快起床了

1394

1395
02:28:56,420 --> 02:29:00,680

1398

真漂亮
It's really pretty.

1399
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:34,800
很传统
It's old-fashioned.

1400
02:29:43,930 --> 02:29:45,180

艾莉丝...
Alice.

1405
02:30:08,910 --> 02:30:10,910

我觉得我们该怎么办?

也许...

1413
02:30:51,330 --> 02:30:53,720
我们应该感到庆幸

庆幸...

1415
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:06,800

冒险...
adventures...

1417
02:31:11,850 --> 02:31:14,190
不论是真的冒险...
whether they were real...

1418
02:31:14,730 --> 02:31:17,080
还是只是一场梦
or only a dream.

1419
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:30,080
你确定吗?
Are you sure of that?

1420
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:35,820
我确定吗?
Am I sure?

1421
02:31:47,590 --> 02:31:49,250
只能...

1422
02:31:51,330 --> 02:31:53,180
我只能确定...
Only as sure as I am...

1423
02:31:53,390 --> 02:31:57,270
一晚的真实...
that the reality of one night...

1424
02:31:58,520 --> 02:32:01,400
甚至是一辈子的真实...
let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1425
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:06,420
也不可能是全部的真相
can ever be the whole truth.

1426
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:15,180
梦也不会...
And no dream is ever...

1427
02:32:16,900 --> 02:32:19,100
只是一场梦
just a dream.

1428

最重要的是...
The important thing is...

永远
Forever.

1435
02:32:56,870 --> 02:33:00,670
别用那个字眼  好吗?
Let's not use that word. You know?

1436
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:04,050
它让我感到害怕
It frightens me.

1437
02:33:14,010 --> 02:33:17,100
不过我真的爱你...
But I do love you...

1441
02:33:29,550 --> 02:33:31,350
是什么?
What's that?

1442
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,200
上床做爱
