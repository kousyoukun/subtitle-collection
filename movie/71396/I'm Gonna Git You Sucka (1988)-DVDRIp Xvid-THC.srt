## Gold fever ##

2
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,973
## Gold fever ##

3
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,967
## Gold fever ##

4
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,392
## I'm changin' things
I'm changin' things ##

5
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:37,714
## I'm gonna git you, sucka ##

6
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:39,955
## You dirty mother... ##
Don't say that.

7
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:43,398
## I'm gonna teach you
that crime just don't pay ##

8
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:46,839
## I'm gonna git you, sucka ##

9
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:49,320
## You dirty mother... ##
Hold on, brother.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,282
## I'm gonna stay on your case
till they put you away ##

11
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:57,148
## I know you think that life's
a bowl of cherries ##

12
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,128
## And you can absolutely
do no wrong ##

13
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:07,089
## Big brother
a word from the wise
should be sufficient ##

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,492
## So I suggest
you pay close attention
to the words to this song ##

15
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:13,429
## Whoo ##

16
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:15,894
## Gold fever ##

17
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:20,296
## Gold fever ##

18
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,682
## Gold fever ##

00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,653
## I'm changin' things
I'm changin' things ##

20
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:33,104
## Livin' in the fast lane
beatin' up the street kids ##

21
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:35,025
## Got plenty money to burn ##
Don't say that.

22
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:37,506
## World's a game of double cross
till you became the boss ##

23
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:39,906
## Now it's my turn ##

24
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:42,068
## Get so we don't agree
menace to society ##

25
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,988
## Smile, yeah, you're on top ##
Wait a minute, Doc.

26
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,150
## 'Cause a smile is just
a frown turned upside down ##

27
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,550
## Get ready for the big drop ##

28
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,113
## 'Cause
I'm gonna git you sucka ##

29
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:53,514
## You dirty mother... ##
Hey, Doc, Doc.

30
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,539
## I'm gonna stay on your case
till they put you away ####

31
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,384
What do you say, Charlie?
Good evening, lieutenant.

32
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:52,265
So, what do you got for me?
John Doe.

33
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:54,666
Between 25 and 30 years of age.

34
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,066
Cause of death looks like O.G.

35
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:59,949
- "Over gold."
- Yeah.

36
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,870
Any signs of foul play
around here?

37
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,191
No, sir. Looks like a case of
just too many gold chains.

38
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:17,318
Jesus Christ!

39
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,679
This guy looks like
a fucking statue.

40
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,521
I wonder how he went to the
bathroom with all this stuff on.

41
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,844
Oh, boy.

42
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,571
All right, Charlie.

43
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,893
Why don't we just wrap it up?

44
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,014
All right, wrap it up.

45
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:54,906
- Friends.
- Yes?

46
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:58,267
I was thinking as we drove up
here in those long Cadillacs...

47
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:01,148
- Mm-hmm.
- How serious this is.

48
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,550
- Yes, it is.
- Death is serious.

49
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,472
Yes, it is.

50
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:07,984
You got to prepare to die.

51
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:09,905
Yes, yes.

52
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:13,746
This boy here loved gold.
We stripped him of all that gold.

53
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:17,589
- That's why we got this
beautiful sermon today.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,598
- He was prepared to die!
- Prepared!

55
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,961
Lord,

56
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:28,763
We ask you to look down on
this young soul known on Earth...

57
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:30,684
as Junebug Spade.

58
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:33,805
Junebug Spade?
Ain't this Lester Wilson's funeral?

59
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,966
No, ma'am.
Lester Wilson was at 9:00.

60
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,720
Oh, hell! Come on,
let's get out of here.

61
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,122
Hold on one second.
No, no. Hold on.

62
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:43,043
- Can I get an amen?
- Don't even know him.

63
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:45,444
- Get out of my way!
- Praise the saints?

64
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:47,846
Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?

65
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:49,767
Put that down.

66
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,490
You know Junebug Spade?

67
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,170
- Yes, we do.
- Yes, I'm his mother.

68
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,571
He was my husband.

69
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:11,618
Mama, I just can't believe that
Junebug didn't have any friends.

70
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,940
Did you notice that not one
person stayed when they
found out it was Junebug?

71
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,300
- Now, baby, you know the boy
wasn't shit.
- Mama!

72
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,183
Don't get me wrong. He was my son,
and I loved him.

73
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:25,064
But when he got hooked
on that gold, he changed.

74
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:27,466
I bet he owed everybody
he ever knew money.

75
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:29,387
Mama, Junebug may have
been a little crooked,

76
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:32,269
But I'm sure that somebody
besides us loved him too.

77
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,669
I don't know.

78
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,071
Maybe that's Jack.

79
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:43,794
- Yes?
- Good afternoon, miss lady ma'am.

80
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:45,715
May we come in?

81
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:48,116
Y'all ain't selling
NoWay products, are you?

82
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:51,479
No! We friends
with Junebug.

83
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,879
They're friends of Junebug's, mama.

84
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,281
Come right in.

85
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:58,202
I'm Cheryl, Junebug's widow,

86
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:02,045
And this is Mrs. Bell Spade,
Junebug's mother.

87
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,965
Hmm.
What's up?

88
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,847
I'm Willie.
This here's Leonard.

89
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,689
- And we come here...
- What you tell them
our real name for?

90
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,609
Are you stupid?

91
00:06:12,609 --> 00:06:15,971
- No, they told us
their real names, so...
- Who's in charge?

92
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:18,372
- You are.
- Who?

93
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:20,294
You in charge.

94
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,695
Then shut the fuck up.

95
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:25,576
- You all mind telling me
what you want?
- Certainly.

96
00:06:26,057 --> 00:06:28,457
- Junebug used to work for me.
- Used to work for us.

97
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,860
- I work for Mr. Big.
- We work for Mr. Big.

98
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,701
It just so happens
that Junebug died...

99
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:38,543
- Owing Mr. Big $5,000.
- Five thousand...

100
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:42,625
- We here to collect.
- Five thousand dollars?

101
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,027
We don't have that kind of money.

102
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:47,427
No shit.

103
00:06:47,427 --> 00:06:49,349
"No shit"!

104
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:51,270
They don't have that kind of money!

105
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,191
Get off me!

106
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:57,993
I could look at these plastic
slipcovers, the slipcovers.

107
00:06:57,993 --> 00:07:00,395
The stupid painted-on walls,
look at this stupid painted...

108
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:02,795
And tell that type of money
ain't around here.

109
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:05,677
You see the dude
that painted those walls?
They got doo-doo paint!

110
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:09,647
It's all bullshit.
Look at these white pillows.
Look at these stupid magazines.

111
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:13,009
Look, they got oranges and shit!

112
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,852
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,693
But I do see somethin'.

114
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:25,014
Somethin' that's gonna
be worth at least...

115
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:27,896
ten times that amount
of money to Mr. Big.

116
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:30,410
Well, what is it?
What do you want?

117
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,331
- You.
- Mama!

118
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:35,692
Don't you touch...

119
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:37,614
Ooh!

120
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:39,535
Good. If she moves, hit her again.

121
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:42,416
- Looks like mama gonna have
to teach you some manners.
- Okay, come on, mama.

122
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,184
You don't ever
come in my house...

123
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:48,420
Acting like no fool, fool!

124
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,110
Now, clean up that mess you made.

125
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:56,344
You, put those pillows
back on the couch
where you found 'em.

126
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:59,226
That's right.
Pick all that shit up!

127
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:02,587
All of it! And puff
these pillows up too, man.

128
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:04,749
- You stupid... come here!

129
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,349
Come here! Why you gonna
go mess the nice lady's
house up for, man?

130
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,672
I only did it... you told me
when we came in to beat her up
and mess up her house!

131
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,073
- I didn't tell you shit
like that, man!
- Yes, you did!

132
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:16,994
Now, mister, you and your
friend got a choice.

133
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:21,317
You can either go out that
window or take the stairs.

134
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:23,717
Okay. We gonna take the stairs.
Yeah, we'll take...

135
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,639
Yeah, we'll take the stairs.

136
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,001
Oh! Ow!
Get your pants outta my face!

137
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,801
Oh!
Get off me, man.
Get off me!

138
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:37,085
- Ma!
- Jack!

139
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:40,927
- Mama!
- Oh, Lord,
my baby's home at last!

140
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:44,769
Mama!

141
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,690
My baby's home!
Come on in.

142
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,051
Ma, you okay?
Oh, yes, just some bill
collectors. Cheryl.

143
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,972
Come look who's here.

144
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:56,295
Oh, honey, you look
so good in this uniform.
All them medals!

145
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:00,616
You remember Cheryl, don't you?

146
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:02,779
Hello, Jack.

147
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:04,588
Hi, Cheryl.

148
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:08,909
Been a long time, huh?

149
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,032
Yeah, it has been a long time.

150
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:20,675
Honey, why don't you go
put your things in the room
and have something to eat?

151
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:24,518
- Cheryl made a fine dinner.
- Mama, that sounds
like a good idea.

152
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:26,919
And Jack, baby,
Mama wants you to know...

153
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,800
I kept your room just the way
you left it ten years ago.

154
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:33,163
Oh, ma.

155
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:35,084
My baby's home.

156
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:01,258
Right here.

157
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:03,658
Smells good. It is good.

158
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,020
Mama, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the funeral.

159
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,420
I got here as soon as I could.

160
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,783
I know, baby.
Just glad you're here now.

161
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:18,546
Mama, exactly how
did Junebug die?

162
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:20,468
He...

163
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:22,868
Mama...

164
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:26,230
She's really
taking this pretty hard.

165
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,073
You know how
your mother is, Jack.

166
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:31,993
Is somebody gonna tell me
what's going on?

167
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:34,874
Jack, not too long
after you left,

168
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:37,275
Junebug started hanging out
with a bad crowd.

169
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:41,118
I mean, he even started
selling drugs, Jack.

170
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,519
And then things
really got bad when he...

171
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,361
Well, what?

172
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:50,723
Cheryl, come on.

173
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,085
He started wearing
gold chains, Jack.

174
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:56,005
Oh, God, no!

175
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,927
It started out
as just one or two.

176
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:02,248
It seemed like every time
he'd get some money,
he'd buy more gold chains.

177
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:05,610
He was wearing hundreds
of them, Jack. Hundreds.

178
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,532
Not gold.
Yes, Jack.

179
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:10,414
Gold chains and medallions
and rings...

180
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:12,335
And even his teeth.

181
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:15,216
You can't imagine what it was
like to kiss him.

182
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,098
He took a picture
just before he died.

183
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:21,458
We put it on the mantle.

184
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,265
Junebug!

185
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,587
How did he go to the bathroom
with all this stuff on?

186
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,469
Okay.

187
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:42,350
All right, who are these people
Junebug was hanging out with?

188
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,230
Well,

189
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:48,113
He worked for a man
named Mr. Big.

190
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:50,514
He rules the crime world here.

191
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:54,356
- Those men that your mother
threw down the stairs?
- They work for Mr. Big too.

192
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:57,718
They came in here
saying that Junebug owed 'em
all kinds of money, crazy money.

193
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,600
And I really think that they're
the ones who killed him.

194
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,001
Well, don't you worry
about a thing.

195
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,403
Jack Spade is here, and I'm
gonna get to the bottom of this.

196
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:07,323
Oh.

197
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:10,925
I better go check on mama.

198
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:16,560
- Where is the girl?
- we almost had the girl, Mr. Big.

199
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,480
Yeah, we almost.
She's beautiful.

200
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,362
She's gonna be worth far more
than the money Junebug owes.

201
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:23,763
She'll be worth
maybe 10 or 20 times.
Far more than money.

202
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:27,606
Anyway, she's got a real soft
juicy fruit butt.

203
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:30,487
But the only problem
was that this old lady,

204
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:32,407
She punched me in the stomach
real hard!

205
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:35,290
Then she started crying
and screaming and stuff,
right?

206
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,211
And a dude came in,
this big dude.

207
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,611
- I think it's her son or something.
- What dude?

208
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,532
- The soldier dude.
- I didn't see him.

209
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:44,414
The dude.
The fucking dude that came in!

210
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:47,776
- Then he started...
He hit me from behind.
- He hit you?

211
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:49,697
- And I went down.
- Oh, you mean the soldier dude!

212
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,466
- Yeah, the soldier dude.
- Okay, okay.

213
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:55,828
Then he hit me from behind.
And I went down.
I was like this.

214
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,821
- Then the dude shot me!
- He didn't shoot you.

215
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:01,223
He did. Kept on
biting on my ankles.

216
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:04,105
- Where did you get
a stupid lie like that from?
- Enough.

217
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:06,986
Now,

218
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,907
Junebug worked under you,

219
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:11,756
Which means you
owe me his debts.

220
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:14,879
If that girl is anything
you say she is,

221
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,800
Then we'll call it even.

222
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,641
I have no patience
when it comes to collecting.

223
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:24,436
Now, I suspect...

224
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,836
You'll bring me that girl
right away.

225
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:30,678
Yes, sir, uncle Mr. Big.
Yes, sir, Mr. Big.

226
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,521
Uncle Mr. Big, I have a question.

227
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:36,442
What about the mother?

228
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:41,725
If he gets in your way,
kill him.

229
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:44,606
I better not hear any more
about that guy...

230
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,527
Or it's your asses!

231
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,448
You got that?

232
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:50,849
Yes, sir, uncle Mr. Big.
It'll be our asses.
It'll be your ass.

233
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,770
Good.

234
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:57,093
You boys can leave
either through the window...

235
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,455
or the stairs.

236
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:03,336
We'll take the stairs.
We always take the stairs.

237
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,257
- Lenny?
- What?

238
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:09,098
- You mad at me?
- I'm gonna be mad on the way
down these stairs.

239
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:13,069
Ooh! Ow!

240
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,990
Ooh! Ooh!
Oh!

241
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:17,263
He was such a sweet baby.

242
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:20,145
I don't know how he
turned out so bad.

243
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:25,427
He missed you
when you was gone, Jack.

244
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:27,348
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

245
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:29,270
I missed him too, mama.

246
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:34,071
You know, I remember
when me and Junebug
used to go to the park.

247
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:36,473
Junebug loved the swings.

248
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:38,874
He'd say, "Jack, give me a push."

249
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:41,756
And I'd take him and run,
but I wouldn't push him.

250
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,637
I'd run back in,
then I'd run again.
Still wouldn't push him.

251
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:48,480
Shut up, Jack!
Do you remember this?

252
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,322
Do you remember when you
made that for mama?

253
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:54,723
I made this
in Mrs. Wilson's class.

254
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:58,084
That's right.
You was always so thoughtful
to your mama.

255
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,926
- That's why I'm so glad
you're home.
- Mama.

256
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:05,288
W-wait a minute.
What?

257
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:07,690
Mama!

258
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,091
That's John Slade.
Yeah?

259
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:12,012
I didn't know you knew him.

260
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:15,373
Yes. We was very much
in love once.

261
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,295
Before I met your father.

262
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,696
I almost married Slade.

263
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:23,057
But he was so busy
being a crime fighter,

264
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:26,419
Flying in and out of windows,
chasing criminals.

265
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:29,301
Hmm. Had no time to settle down.

266
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:33,143
Anyway, wish he was here now.

267
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:35,543
He'd find out what happened to
my boy and he'd make 'em pay.

268
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:37,465
Hey, mama, now.

269
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:40,827
Mama, I'm here, and I'm gonna
find out what happened to Junebug.

270
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,228
No, no, no, no.

271
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:46,590
You're all I got!
Don't you do nothing foolish.

272
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,511
I'm just gonna ask
a few questions, that's all.

273
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,872
- No, Jack.
- Ma, just a few questions.
I promise.

274
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:55,234
- Okay?
- Okay.

275
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,156
Okay.

276
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,077
- Be careful.
- I will.

277
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,133
"John Slade to host
youth gang competition."

278
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:19,087
2:00.
- Hey, move it!
- Can I get a cab?

279
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,415
I want this shit clean.

280
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:40,457
Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!

281
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,303
It's a new record!

282
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:12,876
Right now I'd like to talk
to a man who's no stranger
to this community.

283
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:16,237
And he's considered by many to
be, well, a local hero of sorts.

284
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:20,558
While serving the community
in the '70s, he helped topple
such crime bosses as Mr. Big.

285
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:22,480
He's responsible
for today's events.

286
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,841
I'm speaking, of course,
of Mr. John Slade.

287
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:30,164
A lot of people would like to
see you come back and help rid
the old neighborhood of Mr. Big.

288
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:34,006
- How do you respond to that?
- No, skip. I'm sorry.
I'm retired now.

289
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,407
It's a job for
the police department.

290
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:39,769
Oh, but tell us, Mr. Slade,
what is today really about?

291
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:43,131
To provide for these young
people an opportunity
to let steam off...

292
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:45,532
In a very positive way...

293
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,893
By competing in events that
are familiar, if you will,

294
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,295
to their environment.

295
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:53,216
Do you know
what I mean, brother?

296
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:55,617
Well, actually, I don't.
I didn't grow up around blacks.

297
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,498
I grew up in the suburbs.
My dad was a lawyer.
My mom was a doctor.

298
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:00,420
All my friends were white.

299
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:03,301
Everybody used to tease me
'cause I didn't speak jive.

300
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,222
I couldn't dance
to save my life.

301
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:07,624
The only step I really knew was
that step that Springsteen does...

302
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:10,023
In the "Dancing in the Dark"
video.

303
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,386
I love Springsteen.
Yes.

304
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:16,268
Reporting for WBLD news,
this is Skip Balins saying,

305
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:19,629
in the immortal words of our
negro poet, Don Cornelius,

306
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,031
"Peace and soul."

307
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:23,952
Thanks, guys.

308
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:30,324
- John Slade?
- Yeah.

309
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:32,244
I need to talk to you.

310
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,645
- You sellin' NoWay products?
- No.

311
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:36,566
Oh, okay.

312
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,929
- Can we go somewhere
more private?
- Yeah. This way.

313
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:42,329
Senior Citizen Mugging
Competition...

314
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,452
will begin in five minutes.

315
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:48,333
Okay, young man.
What can I do for you?

316
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:54,576
- Do you remember that woman?
- Yeah, I sure do.

317
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,977
That's Bell Brown.

318
00:18:56,977 --> 00:19:00,820
We used to call her
"hot chocolate."
She had the softest eyes.

319
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:07,062
She had these big old
round, brown, firm ti...

320
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,425
She would do this
little trick with her mouth
where she would...

321
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:12,698
That's my mother, man.

322
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,099
She was a good woman,
your mother. Yes, she was.
Absolutely, a good woman.

323
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,501
I should have married
your mother.

324
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:20,382
Wait a minute. You ain't gonna
tell me I'm your daddy or no
shit like that now...

325
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,302
because I don't wanna
hear no bullshit.

326
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,072
No. Nothin' like that.

327
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:26,993
That's my brother.

328
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:30,354
He's dead. He O.G.'d.

329
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:33,717
How does he go to the bathroom
with all this shit on?

330
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:35,637
Look, I'm sorry
about your brother...

331
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:39,960
And I'm really sorry for Bell
because she don't deserve it.

332
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:43,322
Look at this.

333
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:45,722
I bought that on the street.

334
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:49,085
You know what that shit
is doing to our kids?
I know. I'm from the streets.

335
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:53,758
Every day I see kids
walking around killing
and stealing for gold chains.

336
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:56,161
I see kids with medallions
so big they can hardly stand up.

337
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:59,522
All stooped over and shit,
trying to carry that stuff.

338
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:02,403
But what's really awful, man,
is you see a young brother...

339
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:06,246
with this cheap, imitation
electroplated gold crap
around their necks,

340
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,647
and it breaks out
in this funky green rash...

341
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:10,567
with these bumps and shit.

342
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,968
It just make you wanna puke.

343
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:17,292
Yeah. Yeah,
I know it's happenin'.
What do you want with me?

344
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,212
I want you...

345
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:22,094
to take down Mr. Big and put
an end to this gold-chain shit.

346
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:25,937
Hey, look, I'm sorry about your
brother. I'm sorry for Bell.

347
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:28,337
But I don't wanna be
no hero no more, man.

348
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:31,699
- I'm a long way from that.
- Yeah, and look what happened.

349
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:35,060
- The people need you.
- The people need me?

350
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,462
It was the people, man,
that made me retire.

351
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:41,064
The people said
I was too violent,
a bad image for the kids.

352
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:43,946
So fuck the people.
The people...

353
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:46,827
Look, I'm retired now,
okay?

354
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:49,709
And I kind of enjoy
the feeling of staying alive.
Okay, brother?

355
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:54,512
I was one of those kids
that looked up to you, man.
I believed in you.

356
00:20:54,512 --> 00:20:57,392
I wanted to be like you.

357
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:01,234
You were the best.

358
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:25,247
Hello!

359
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,368
Hello?

360
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:30,769
Is anybody here?

361
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:33,172
Yes, my brother.

362
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:35,092
How may I help you?

363
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:38,934
Yeah, are you Kalinga, leader of
the people's revolutionary army?

364
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:41,335
- Are you C.I.A.?
- No.

365
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:44,697
- I am Kalinga.
- I need to talk to you.

366
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:47,578
Have a seat.
Would you care for
something to eat?

367
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:49,499
A bean pie perhaps?

368
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:51,421
No, uh, I'm not hungry.

369
00:21:51,421 --> 00:21:55,263
Something to drink?
Please sit down.
Herb tea? A soda?

370
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:57,184
Okay, soda's fine.

371
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:04,628
Articulate your needs.
I'm here to listen.

372
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:06,549
How may I help you?

373
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:08,949
Well, first of all...

374
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,321
It's an acquired taste.

375
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:18,683
Now... How may I help you,
my brother?

376
00:22:18,683 --> 00:22:21,565
Look, I'm here because
I can't stand what's happening
in this community.

377
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:23,966
- Yes!
- And somebody has to
make a change.

378
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:25,407
- Yes!
- Brother, will you help me?

379
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,807
Yes! Well...

380
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:30,690
I wish I could.

381
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,531
Damn it, man. I heard
the people's revolutionary army
was once a thousand strong.

382
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:37,893
- Now, what happened?
- They got government jobs.

383
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:41,255
What?

384
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,136
You know that government office
building on 25th street?

385
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:47,498
- Yeah?
- We went down to take it over.

386
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:50,860
But they were hiring that day.

387
00:22:51,212 --> 00:22:53,133
The brothers
walked in with guns...

388
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,455
and came out with jobs.

389
00:22:57,455 --> 00:22:59,856
The brothers
weren't mad anymore.

390
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:02,738
Yes.

391
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:05,619
Whitey...
Is something else.

392
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:11,383
Damn.

393
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:15,705
My great nubian warrior,
dinner's ready.

394
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,235
We have a guest.
Meet my Ofay Wench.

395
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:24,957
Uh, nice to meet you.
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

396
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:28,432
She makes the best bean dishes
in all the world.

397
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,642
Daddy!
Daddy, can we watch TV?

398
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:36,484
Daddy, oh, brave black king,
I finished my homework.

399
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:39,237
Can we watch TV?

400
00:23:39,237 --> 00:23:42,599
Let me hear... Your report.

401
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,921
Okay. "Abraham Lincoln was

412
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:17,177
I am very pleased.

413
00:24:17,177 --> 00:24:20,059
Yes, you and your lovely sister,

414
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:23,307
You may go and watch TV.

415
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:25,229
Go and enjoy.

416
00:24:28,111 --> 00:24:30,032
Are you sure, my brother,

417
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,952
You will not join us?

418
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:34,353
- No.
- Oh, bean ice cream.

Thanks, I'm regular.

Look, I gotta be going, man.
Thanks.

00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:57,085
Hi, soldier boy.
How you doing?

426
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:59,598
What can I get for you?

427
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,960
Just a soda.

428
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:08,243
I came to pick you up.
You gettin' off soon?

429
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:14,007
I was just waiting for ma
to come and take me home.

430
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:15,928
She's probably had a long day.

431
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:18,329
Call and tell her I'm here.

432
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,689
Okay. I'll be back in a minute.

433
00:25:32,577 --> 00:25:35,458
You Jack Spade?

434
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:38,820
Yeah, I'm Jack... Spade.

435
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,623
We hear you been asking
a lot of questions
around town about Mr. Big.

436
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:45,543
Mr. Big don't like it.

437
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,424
- Jack.
- Come here, Cheryl.

438
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:50,825
Don't you worry about a thing.
I can handle this.

439
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:54,188
Only thing you're gonna
be able to handle, soldier boy,
is a wheelchair.

440
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,589
- Jack, no!
- Oh, yeah.

441
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,510
Yeah.

442
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:04,273
Hold it right there.
Ain't nobody layin' a finger
on my baby.

443
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,194
Ma!

444
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:12,197
How did you do that?

445
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:34,288
You know, ma, you really didn't
have to do that.

446
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:36,209
That was my fight.

447
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:40,051
That's all right, sugar.
Mama don't want her baby
fightin' that street trash.

448
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:42,933
Come on, let's go home.
Put your jacket on, Jack.
Put the jacket on.

449
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:45,814
Put your jacket on.
It's cold outside.

450
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,735
Come on. Move.

451
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:59,309
Look, ma,
I'm not a boy anymore.
I'm a man.

452
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,671
My whole life,
every time I get in a fight,
here you come.

453
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:05,553
I don't need you
to fight for me no more.

454
00:27:07,953 --> 00:27:09,875
All right,
Mr. Tough Guy.

455
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:14,198
I remember when you
wasn't so tough.

456
00:27:14,198 --> 00:27:18,520
I remember when you was always
calling for your mama!

457
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,361
Like the time when
that Lois Mitchell girl
was kicking your ass...

458
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:24,762
Up and down, up and down
the schoolyard!

459
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:28,125
All I could hear was,
"Mama! Mama!"

460
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:31,487
Oh, yeah, and the time
when that Evans family,
those little midgets,

461
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,239
Was chasing you home
'cause you didn't want to
give them your lunch money.

462
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,082
I could hear your punk ass
calling me a half a mile away.

463
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:40,963
"Mama, help me!
Mama, help me!"

464
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:43,365
Now you don't need me
no more, huh?

465
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:45,285
Fine.

466
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:49,607
You don't never
have to worry about me
fighting for you no more.

467
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:51,528
- Good.
- Now what you gonna do?

468
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:53,449
Finish the fight Big started.

469
00:27:53,449 --> 00:27:56,331
- Don't be no fool.
They'll kill you, Jack!
- Maybe.

470
00:27:56,331 --> 00:27:58,733
Jack!

471
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:05,456
Slade.

472
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:09,298
How you doin', Bell?
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

473
00:28:09,778 --> 00:28:13,140
I need you. I really need you.

474
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,541
I've been pretty horny
myself lately.

475
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:19,383
That's a gun.
Jack, what are you doing
with a gun?

476
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:21,304
I'm in the army,
remember?

477
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:25,147
- Mama's right.
They're gonna kill you.
- Mr. Big is gonna pay.

478
00:28:25,147 --> 00:28:28,989
And if I see
those little Evans midgets,
they ass is mine!

479
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:31,390
I'm... it's payback.
And Lois Mitchell.

480
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,310
You know, she snuck me.
She snuck me.

481
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,192
In fifth grade...
I was eating my jell-o
when you hit me, baby.

482
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,113
They were just kids!

483
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:41,955
A family full of midgets
is not considered kids.
That's a gang!

484
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:46,277
Jack, wait a minute.
Getting yourself killed
is not gonna prove anything.

485
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:48,679
Proves I can beat a woman
and some midgets.

486
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,321
He's gonna get himself killed.

487
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:54,683
How ya doing, Jack?

488
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,484
Slade, please.
Please stop him.
He's all I got left.

489
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,125
Don't worry, Bell.
I'll take care of him.

490
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:07,408
Jack.

491
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:10,290
Jack, where the hell
do you think you're going?

492
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,210
To war.
You mean to get killed.

493
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,093
Look, I came to you for help.
You don't want to help me, cool.

494
00:29:15,573 --> 00:29:17,974
But don't try to stop me
from doin' what I gotta do,
okay?

495
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:20,375
You go out there alone,
they gonna shoot your ass off.

496
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,737
- I'm a soldier, man.
I've been trained for combat.

497
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:28,539
Oh, my god!
Heads up!

498
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:31,420
Be cool!
They shootin'!

499
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,342
They shootin'!
Somebody shootin'!

500
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:37,184
Get down!
Get your ass down, boy!

501
00:29:37,184 --> 00:29:39,586
I thought you were
trained for combat.

502
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:42,948
Yeah. Yeah, I was,
but I ain't never been in it.

503
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,348
What are these
fancy medals for?

504
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:48,117
Well, this one is shorthand.

505
00:29:48,598 --> 00:29:50,999
And this one here's M.P.V.

506
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,401
- And, uh, this is surfin'.
- Never mind. Never mind.

507
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:55,322
- You got your weapon?
- Yeah.

508
00:29:55,322 --> 00:29:57,723
Give it to me.

509
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:00,604
Give me a clip.

510
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:02,526
Hurry up, Jack.

511
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:04,447
- Ma'am, how is he?
- He's dead.

512
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:07,328
Can't you hear the music?

513
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,130
Ma'am?

514
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,532
- I waited 12 years for this.
- Let me see.

515
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:17,765
Not bad.
At least he wasn't cheap.

516
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,535
I'm sure he won't mind.

517
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:34,334
Jack, go now!

518
00:30:40,818 --> 00:30:42,739
Go that way.

519
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:45,140
I'll go this way.

520
00:30:49,463 --> 00:30:51,864
Cover the door.
They're comin' up.

521
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:54,265
- Where are you goin'?
- Comin' around the corner.
Cover the door.

522
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:56,665
They're comin' out!

523
00:31:00,155 --> 00:31:02,557
Here, take it!

524
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,431
Cover me! Cover me!

525
00:31:13,603 --> 00:31:16,965
Don't do this, man!

526
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,479
Who is it?

527
00:31:20,918 --> 00:31:23,799
Come on, come on.
Against the wall, punk.

528
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,680
Hold it!
It's over, it's over.

529
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,004
Now, who are you guys
and why are you trying
to kill us?

530
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:33,885
What, you think
it's that easy?
You think it's that easy?

531
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:37,246
You just ask us,
and we tell you, right?
We supposed to tell you?

532
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:39,168
Shit.
That's funny.

533
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:41,570
You're gonna have to
kill him first.

534
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,451
Why you gonna
kill me first, Lenny?

535
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,293
You guys talk a lot of shit
to be so light in the ass.

536
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:52,135
- Uh, uncle Mr. Big
told us to kill him.
- why does Big want me dead?

537
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,295
The word's on the street
you been sticking your nose
in business that's not yours.

538
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:56,698
You're sticking
your nose in it.

539
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:58,619
And you, Mr. Whoever You Are.
Whoever you are.

540
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:01,500
The same is gonna happen to you
when Mr. Big finds out
what you did tonight.

541
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,509
Well, you know what?
You guys are real lucky.

542
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:07,023
I'm in a good mood tonight,
so I'm gonna let you go, okay?

543
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:10,384
- I thought so.
- Hey, Lenny, wait a minute.

544
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:14,706
Why were you gonna let us go
when we was just over there
trying to kill you?

545
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:17,588
Stupid.
What do you care why?

546
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,989
- Let's just go.
- Look.

547
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:22,390
You tell Mr. Big...

548
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,792
that John Slade is back.

549
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,674
He's got 24 hours
to get outta town.

550
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,555
Now, you guys can either
go over the side...

551
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:32,476
- Or you can ...
- Yeah, we'll take the stairs.

552
00:32:32,955 --> 00:32:35,358
Yeah, I thought you knew.
Come on. Let's go.
Go on. Shut up.

553
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:37,887
Fucking get off me, man.

554
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:40,287
Come on.

555
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:42,208
Go ahead.

556
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:48,932
When they get back to Big,
it's gonna get rough.

557
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:51,334
You better score
some big guns.

558
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:58,970
## When the saints ##

559
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,331
## Go marchin' in ##

560
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,694
## When the saints ##

561
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:10,496
## Go marchin' in ##

562
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:12,417
Do that march, baby.

563
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:14,339
## I wanna be, uh ##

564
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:17,220
## In that number ##
How you doing, brother man?

565
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,141
- May I help you gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

566
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:21,061
We wanna see one-eyed Sam.

567
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:23,943
You ain't selling
any NoWay products,
are you?

568
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:25,864
We look like salesmen
to you?

569
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:27,785
He ain't here, okay?

570
00:33:27,785 --> 00:33:30,666
You call him on the phone
and you tell him
that John Slade...

571
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:32,587
has got to score tonight.

572
00:33:33,068 --> 00:33:35,949
Yeah, Okay. John Slade.

573
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:38,351
I'll get his line
here for you.

574
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,712
## Refuses to shine ##

575
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:44,594
Sam, sorry to wake you.

576
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:48,916
Two big ugly-looking guys,
one guy who thinks
he's at sea world.

577
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:52,758
This other guy named Slade.

578
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:55,640
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Slade says he
needs a big score.

579
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,442
Okay. Later.

580
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:02,843
Uh, Slade, Slade.

581
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:04,764
I-I'm sorry about that.

582
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:09,454
Sam says he'll be right over
and for me to get you guys
a drink on the house.

583
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:12,816
- Enjoy the show.
Sorry about that, man.
- No problem.

584
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:14,737
All right.

585
00:34:15,698 --> 00:34:19,539
## When the saints ##

586
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,343
## Go mar-wa-wa-waah ##

587
00:34:24,343 --> 00:34:27,705
## Saints ##
Hi, can I get you fellas
something to drink?

588
00:34:27,705 --> 00:34:31,067
Yes, baby, give me
a whiskey double, okay?

589
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:32,987
One whiskey double.
And?

590
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:36,220
Um, I'll have a Pepsi double.

591
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:40,094
One whiskey double
and one Pepsi coming right up.

592
00:34:40,575 --> 00:34:44,865
## Be in that number ##

593
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:48,707
## When the saints ##

594
00:34:48,707 --> 00:34:50,629
## Go marchin' in ##

595
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:53,991
## I-i-i-in, whoo ##

596
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:57,351
## Will you be there with me
I'm asking, will you
be there with me ##

597
00:34:57,351 --> 00:35:01,194
- Who is that?
- That's the director's sister.

598
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,441
- One whiskey double.
- Thank you.

599
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:18,323
and a... Pepsi double.

600
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:23,125
You've got some things to learn
about being a hero.

601
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:25,045
Like what?

602
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:26,966
I mean, a Pepsi?

603
00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:30,809
- Jack, come on.
- Wh-what's wrong with Pepsi?

604
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:32,730
When's the last time
you been laid?

605
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,651
- What?
- You heard what I said.

606
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,052
Uh, well, not ...

607
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:38,974
Been a while, hasn't it?

608
00:35:38,974 --> 00:35:42,816
Yeah, okay, so ...
So yeah, all right.
So it's been a while.

609
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:45,696
But that's only 'cause
I'm waiting on somebody ...

610
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:47,618
Waiting on somebody special.

611
00:35:47,618 --> 00:35:50,019
Somebody special.
You got a lot to learn.

612
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:52,900
You gotta learn the difference
between being loved...

613
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,789
and being laid.

614
00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:58,584
Now, when I was with your mom ...
When I was with your mom,

615
00:35:58,584 --> 00:36:00,953
That was being loved.

616
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:03,835
But you see down at the end
of the bar there?

617
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:06,717
That is for being laid.

618
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,752
I ...
She's comin' over here!

619
00:36:14,752 --> 00:36:16,673
Be cool. Loosen up.

620
00:36:16,673 --> 00:36:19,555
Let her do the talking.

621
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:29,641
Hi. My name's Cherry.

622
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:32,041
What's yours?

623
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,922
- Jack.
- Jack.

624
00:36:34,922 --> 00:36:37,773
That's such
a strong-sounding name.

625
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:39,693
Jack.

626
00:36:40,173 --> 00:36:42,094
Do you find me attractive?

627
00:36:42,094 --> 00:36:45,937
Oh, yeah.

628
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:50,243
I was just wondering,
what are you doing
in a place like this?

629
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:54,534
Looking for Mr. Right,
and I think I might
have just found him.

630
00:36:56,455 --> 00:36:58,855
Why?

631
00:36:59,335 --> 00:37:03,658
Well, any man
with such a strong name
and strong body...

632
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:07,468
Probably has
exactly what I need.

633
00:37:09,341 --> 00:37:11,261
What's that?

634
00:37:13,182 --> 00:37:16,545
Twelve inches.

635
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:18,914
Twelve inches.

636
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,677
Uh, well ...

637
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:28,038
I...

638
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,919
Hmm?
I guess I'd do.

639
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:33,802
Well, hello, Mr. Right.

640
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:36,683
Say, Jack, honey, I've got a
place just around the corner.

641
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:41,966
Let's say we get out of here.

642
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:45,327
- Get out.
- Get out.

643
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:48,689
Oh, oh, I don't know.

644
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:51,090
I-I'm here with my friend,
and, you know, we got...

645
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,012
business.

646
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:57,334
No problem.
I got plenty of time.
Help yourself.

647
00:37:57,334 --> 00:38:00,695
I'll just sit here
and wait for Sam.

648
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:17,504
## Never met a girl
like you before ##

649
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:21,827
## You're so cute ####

650
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,913
Oh, shoot me, hurt me.

651
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,833
Ooh, yes!

652
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:40,075
Oh! You ...

653
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:42,478
You are so sexy.

654
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:45,359
Jack, I can't wait.

655
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,280
Hmm, baby.
Give me ...

656
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,681
Give me... Give me
all the 12 inches.

657
00:38:49,681 --> 00:38:51,602
All the 12...
Now!

658
00:38:51,602 --> 00:38:54,004
Oh, the 12. Um...
Now! Now!

659
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:55,925
Now!
Oh, the 12, the 12.

660
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:59,157
Yeah, that's good.
Ooh, that's good.
We gotta talk about this 12.

661
00:38:59,157 --> 00:39:01,079
Huh?
Twelve.

662
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,361
I... Yeah,
about those 12 inches?

663
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:09,244
Well, uh, I lied.

664
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:13,085
I-I really don't have
12 inches.

665
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:15,006
No?

666
00:39:15,006 --> 00:39:16,927
I hope I didn't
disappoint you.

667
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,210
Well, I have a confession
to make too.

668
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,131
Really?

669
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:27,973
My eyes...

670
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:29,895
Aren't really green.

671
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:35,177
You know what else?

672
00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:37,578
Another secret. What?

673
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:44,782
But this is nice
in the summer!

674
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:48,865
Oh, wait.
I am glad to get these off.

675
00:39:48,865 --> 00:39:52,226
No, not that. Not the tits.
Please don't be the ...

676
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:55,107
They're not even
the right color!

677
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:59,430
- whoo!
- this voluptuous ass of mine?

678
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:06,154
Oh, wait.

679
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:09,035
Guys always get a kick
out of this one. Wait.

680
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:16,158
Oh, god, I feel so much better.
I know you do too.

681
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:19,520
Look, ooh... Whoo!
Hey, you see?

682
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,401
It... You-you...
No, wait.

683
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:25,283
I got to... I have got to...

684
00:40:25,283 --> 00:40:27,685
Oh, please,
Jack, honey, come on.

685
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:32,135
Don't make me...
Don't make me hop after you.
Come on, baby.

686
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:38,859
That was quick. What happened?

687
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:42,220
It was unbelievable.

688
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,141
- Slade!
- Hey, Sam!

689
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:46,543
How are you, man?
You're lookin' good.

690
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,464
Hey.
Good to see you.

691
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:51,345
What's so damn important
you gotta wake me
out of my bed?

692
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:53,746
We've got to score,
and we got to score tonight.

693
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:56,149
- Follow me.
- You the man.

694
00:40:56,149 --> 00:40:58,068
Let's go.

695
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:11,227
Sam, this youngblood
is Jack Spade.

696
00:41:11,227 --> 00:41:13,148
Jack, Sam.

697
00:41:13,148 --> 00:41:16,511
- You a soldier, boy?
- Yes, sir.

698
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:19,392
What was your specialty,
son?

699
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:21,680
I was a...

700
00:41:24,563 --> 00:41:27,444
I was the intermilitary
administrator.

701
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,845
Well, I'll be damned.

702
00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:31,749
A secretary.

703
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,521
Well, good to meet you, son.

704
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:39,290
I was intermilitary
administrator myself.

705
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:45,533
Sam. Sam, hold it, man.
You told me you served in 'nam.

706
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:47,454
I did. Saigon.

707
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,855
How'd you lose your eye?
Fuckin' around in the office.

708
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:53,697
We were shootin' paper clips,
and one of the damn fools
hit me in the eye.

709
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:55,618
Same thing
almost happened to me.

710
00:41:55,618 --> 00:41:58,500
How'd you win those fuckin'
medals on your coat?

711
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,901
Well, this one is for typin'.

712
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:04,856
And this one
is for dart champion.
This one is for surfin'.

713
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,777
I got that one!
Never mind, never mind!

714
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:09,658
Shut up.
Show me what you got.

715
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:19,503
Well, they need to be cleaned
and oiled, but they work.

716
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:21,425
Well, I could do that.

717
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:24,306
Hey, all we need now
is an army.

718
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:30,548
You take care of the weapons,
and I'll get us an army.

719
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:52,161
Jack, I'm glad you're okay.
I was really worried about you.

720
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:55,042
I cleaned the room up for you.

721
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,963
Do you like it?

722
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:00,805
Yeah, it's nice.

723
00:43:02,726 --> 00:43:04,647
May I sit down?

724
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:08,008
Yeah.

725
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:20,016
Jack,

726
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:24,336
why didn't you write to me
all those years?

727
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:29,620
I didn't have nothin'
to tell you.

728
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,462
Well, you could have just
told me you were alive.

729
00:43:33,462 --> 00:43:36,343
Cheryl, I went away
to prove something to you.

730
00:43:36,343 --> 00:43:39,226
No, not to you.
Prove something to myself.

731
00:43:39,226 --> 00:43:43,067
That I can be a man for you,
that I can protect you.

732
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:47,388
I mean, our whole lives,
every time we got into trouble,
my mother came.

733
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:51,231
I never had a chance to prove
to you I could be a man.

734
00:43:51,231 --> 00:43:53,632
I figured I'd go in the army,
get into combat,

735
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,033
have some great war stories
to tell you.

736
00:43:56,514 --> 00:43:59,396
I mean, I wait ten years
for a war... Nothing.

737
00:43:59,396 --> 00:44:02,757
I wind up being a secretary.

738
00:44:02,757 --> 00:44:06,599
Jack, you didn't
have to prove anything.

739
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,001
Not to me.

740
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:11,401
You've always been
the man for me, Jack.

741
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,803
Yeah, and what about Junebug?

742
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:17,165
I went out with Junebug
to remind me of you.

743
00:44:19,085 --> 00:44:21,006
You know, Jack...

744
00:44:28,691 --> 00:44:32,533
Remember when we used to go
down to the Soul Train Disco?

745
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:34,933
And you would
get all dressed up,

746
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:38,776
And I would put my hair
in those afro puffs?

747
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:44,539
## Rhythmatic, acrobatic
she's a dynamite attraction ##

748
00:44:46,461 --> 00:44:48,381
## Yeah ##

749
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:52,591
## She knows what she's doing
she's super-bad now ##

750
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:56,433
## She's dancing
it really blows your mind ##

751
00:45:02,195 --> 00:45:04,598
Down! Ha-yii!

752
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:15,996
## Dancin', dancin', dancin' ##

753
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:18,878
Boy, we were a real knockout.

754
00:45:18,878 --> 00:45:21,758
Yeah. We were somethin'.

755
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,482
## If ever a love there was ##

756
00:45:28,482 --> 00:45:31,843
## If ever two stars
were crossed ##

757
00:45:32,324 --> 00:45:34,726
## If ever a dream was born ##

758
00:45:34,726 --> 00:45:36,646
## Yeah ##

759
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:38,567
## Then it was yours and mine ##

760
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:42,890
## If ever a touch was right ##

761
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:46,732
## or a future looked bright ##

762
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:51,582
## If ever a love there was ##

763
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:10,792
- May I help you, sir?
- How much for an order of ribs?

764
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:13,674
- Uh, 2.50.
- 2.50?

765
00:46:14,154 --> 00:46:16,075
How many ribs
do I get with that?

766
00:46:16,555 --> 00:46:18,956
- Uh, about five.
- Five?

767
00:46:20,397 --> 00:46:23,279
So I guess that's about
50 cents a rib, huh?

768
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:25,200
Yeah, about.

769
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,121
Let me get one.

770
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:30,002
Right on.
One order.
One order of ribs.

771
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:32,885
No, no. No, no.
One rib.

772
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:34,805
One rib?

773
00:46:35,284 --> 00:46:37,686
I sure am hungry.

774
00:46:39,607 --> 00:46:42,969
Um, make that one rib to go.

775
00:46:43,321 --> 00:46:46,202
- One rib?
- One rib.

776
00:46:47,163 --> 00:46:49,564
- What else?
- You got any soda?

777
00:46:49,564 --> 00:46:51,966
One dollar.

778
00:46:52,447 --> 00:46:55,328
Ah, come on now.
Look out for a brother, man.

779
00:46:55,328 --> 00:46:58,688
Come on. Check this out.
Why don't you let me get
a sip for 15 cents?

780
00:46:59,169 --> 00:47:02,531
My cups cost more than 15 cents.

781
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:05,893
All right, fuck the cup.
Pour it in my hand
for a dime.

782
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:09,254
Look, you greasy-headed,
jeri-curl wearin'...

783
00:47:09,254 --> 00:47:12,617
Pay me and get the hell
out of my store.

784
00:47:20,781 --> 00:47:23,182
You got change for a hundred?

785
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:27,503
Look, we're gonna need
an orthopedic surgeon
to remove my foot from your ass.

786
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:29,906
Hammer, Hammer.
No, brother, don't do it.

787
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:32,307
You know the customer
is always king.
Hammer!

788
00:47:32,787 --> 00:47:34,708
Slade!
You son of a bitch.

789
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:37,590
Slam, how you doin'?
Hey, man, I thought you
were dead or something.

790
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:39,991
No, no.
Or worse...
Married and shit.

791
00:47:40,472 --> 00:47:42,872
Don't put that on me.
How you doing, brother?

792
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:46,234
How you guys doing?
You all right?
Really good to see you.

793
00:47:46,234 --> 00:47:48,635
Listen, how would you guys
like to upgrade your image?

794
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,037
What you talkin' about,
Slade?

795
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:52,958
I'm talkin' about
doin' it one more time.

796
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:56,319
I'm talkin' about
takin' it to the man.

797
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,089
- Mr. Big.
- You got it, Slam.

798
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:01,970
Man, you must be crazy.
Check this out.

799
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,851
- We are businessmen now.
- Give me a break.

800
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:09,654
You two big motherfuckers
in here making red beans
and grits is business?

801
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:13,016
Damn, Slade.

802
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:16,377
You sure know how
to piss on a man's parade.

803
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:19,740
But, you know, it sure would be
good to be back on top again.

804
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,526
- What do you say, Slammer?
- What the fuck.

805
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,944
I ain't killed nobody
in a long time.

806
00:48:26,944 --> 00:48:30,306
The old warehouse,
6:00 P.M.

807
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:34,146
Be there or be square.

808
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:39,622
Five minutes, Flyguy.

809
00:48:42,023 --> 00:48:45,385
What do you say, buddy?
How you holdin' up?

810
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:47,066
I'm hangin'.

811
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:50,668
A few more hours,
I'll be a free man.

812
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:52,109
So what are your plans?

813
00:48:55,471 --> 00:48:58,351
Hey, man,
let's cut the bullshit.

814
00:48:58,351 --> 00:49:00,753
We known each other
too long for that.

815
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,522
- What are you here for?
- Mr. Big.

816
00:49:04,963 --> 00:49:09,526
- Big? What about him?
- We're gonna take him down.

817
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:16,729
I've been away too long.
Count me out.

818
00:49:16,729 --> 00:49:19,563
The reason you been away so long
is 'cause Mr. Big shot your ass
through the grease...

819
00:49:19,563 --> 00:49:21,963
and put your black butt
in this joint.

820
00:49:22,203 --> 00:49:25,886
At one time, you were
the biggest and baddest
player out there, man.

821
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:27,807
Remember?

822
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:33,009
Yeah, I remember.

823
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:34,931
I was Pimp of the Year.

824
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:37,332
Now, this has really been
an exciting competition.

825
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:39,733
Now we'd like to announce
our two finalists.

826
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:43,095
But first, how about a big hand
for all our contestants?

827
00:49:43,095 --> 00:49:45,017
All right.
There we go.

828
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:53,661
The final category is talent.

829
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:58,223
Representing the big apple,
Flyguy!

830
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:02,065
I'm gonna try to do
a little poetry for y'all.

831
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:08,308
It's an original piece
written by me, Flyguy.

832
00:50:08,677 --> 00:50:12,037
I want to dedicate this piece
to all you players...

833
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:15,400
And all you ladies out there.

834
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,321
Come on, baby!

835
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:20,202
Name of this piece is called...

836
00:50:20,682 --> 00:50:22,604
"My bitch better have my money."

837
00:50:25,597 --> 00:50:28,479
My bitch better have my money...

838
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,880
through rain, sleet or snow.

839
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,241
- Brother's a Shakespeare!
- My ho better have my money.

840
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:35,683
That boy's a genius!
Tell it!

841
00:50:35,683 --> 00:50:38,564
Not half, not some,

842
00:50:38,564 --> 00:50:41,446
But all my cash.

843
00:50:41,446 --> 00:50:43,367
Because if she don't,

844
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:45,288
I'm gonna put my foot
dead in her ass.

845
00:50:47,209 --> 00:50:50,571
The pimp of the year is Flyguy!

846
00:50:51,052 --> 00:50:53,933
Flyguy! Flyguy!

847
00:50:53,933 --> 00:50:59,214
## Picked by the brother's
brother here ##

848
00:50:59,454 --> 00:51:03,777
## Picked by a jury
of his peers ##

849
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:08,579
## He's the pimp of the year ##
Flyguy! Flyguy!

850
00:51:08,707 --> 00:51:11,110
Flyguy! Flyguy!
## He's the pimp ##

851
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,991
## Of the year ##

852
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:17,785
## He's the pimp of the year ##
Flyguy.

853
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:21,515
I want some information
about the operation.

854
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:24,396
Where it is, how big it is,
how many places.

855
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:28,237
Ten years of conversations
in this place, with these cats
coming in and out,

856
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:29,759
You got the 4-1-1.

857
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,120
Okay, I can do that for you.

858
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:37,683
You gotta promise me
y'all won't hassle me.

859
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:41,046
I'm goin' back out
on the street...

860
00:51:41,046 --> 00:51:43,927
And I'm takin' back
what's mine,

861
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:47,287
And everything's gonna be
just like it used to be.

862
00:51:48,248 --> 00:51:51,130
I got no beef with you,
Flyguy,

863
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,051
But I want Mr. Big.

864
00:51:53,051 --> 00:51:54,940
Solid.

865
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:58,574
## It's so real
you can feel it ##

866
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,975
## And it's real ##

867
00:52:01,087 --> 00:52:03,008
## So real ##
## So real, so real

868
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:05,410
Oh, man.

869
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:09,253
It's so good
to be off my feet, man.
They been killin' me.

870
00:52:09,732 --> 00:52:11,172
## I can dig it
He can dig it
We can dig it ##

871
00:52:11,172 --> 00:52:13,093
## She can dig it
They can dig it
You can dig it ##

872
00:52:13,093 --> 00:52:15,014
## Oh, we're diggin'... ##

873
00:52:15,014 --> 00:52:16,935
Hey, man, do you have to sing?

874
00:52:16,935 --> 00:52:20,297
I told you
my feet been killin' me,
you don't even care.

875
00:52:20,297 --> 00:52:24,139
Say, man, if you can't dig
my melodious voice,

876
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:27,502
then just step on outside
and walk on them precious,
tender feet of yours.

877
00:52:27,502 --> 00:52:29,423
Walk?

878
00:52:29,423 --> 00:52:32,784
Man, I ain't walkin' nowhere,
as bad as these bunions feel.

879
00:52:32,784 --> 00:52:35,185
You must be crazy.

880
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:38,194
Let's go.
Oh, here we go.

881
00:52:38,194 --> 00:52:41,076
Shit. Man, I hate
comin' into the city.

882
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:43,349
I'll get it
nice and clean for you, man.

883
00:52:43,717 --> 00:52:45,991
Let me get your window!
Get off the goddamn car.

884
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,201
Hey!
Oh, man!

885
00:52:50,554 --> 00:52:52,954
Yeah, man, okay.
I got it.

886
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:54,875
It's in my hands.

887
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:36,306
## Down from the bar ##

888
00:53:36,306 --> 00:53:39,187
## There's a platform stage ##

889
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:41,220
## People primpin', pimpin' ##

890
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,102
## Sharp as razor blades ##

891
00:53:44,102 --> 00:53:46,022
Yo, check out homeboy.

892
00:53:49,383 --> 00:53:51,304
Say, dominic,
brother's out there, huh?

893
00:53:57,549 --> 00:54:00,430
Look at the fish in those shoes!

894
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,719
Girl, he must be a rock star.

895
00:54:05,121 --> 00:54:07,522
This brother's walkin'
on an aquarium.

896
00:54:08,002 --> 00:54:10,402
Say, brother, do you get
nosebleeds way up there?

897
00:54:10,883 --> 00:54:13,765
Maybe it's his dinner.

898
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:17,607
Hey, homey,
are you expectin' a flood?

899
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,492
Say, brother, you been shoppin'
at the Goodwill?

900
00:54:26,492 --> 00:54:30,333
Hey, brother, that's
an endangered species.

901
00:54:30,573 --> 00:54:33,088
He looks like a clown!

902
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:37,889
Where's the Mardi Gras?

903
00:54:43,172 --> 00:54:45,093
Hey, Jack.
All right.

904
00:54:45,093 --> 00:54:47,495
You got the stuff?
Yeah.

905
00:54:47,495 --> 00:54:49,416
All cleaned and oiled.

906
00:54:50,857 --> 00:54:53,738
Oh, yeah.
Beautiful. Beautiful.

907
00:54:53,738 --> 00:54:56,619
- Let's get it on.
- Who are these guys?

908
00:54:56,619 --> 00:55:00,461
That's my theme music.
Every good hero
should have some.

909
00:55:12,948 --> 00:55:14,869
Hammer.
Good to see you.

910
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:17,750
Slade.
Slammer, glad you could make it.

911
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:21,593
Who are we waitin' on?
Kung Fu Joe.

912
00:55:22,073 --> 00:55:23,513
He'll be here in a minute.

913
00:55:23,994 --> 00:55:25,434
Who is he?

914
00:55:25,914 --> 00:55:28,796
This is Jack Spade, that new
blood I was talkin' about.

915
00:55:28,796 --> 00:55:30,718
What?

916
00:55:30,718 --> 00:55:33,599
Yo, new blood, you ever kill
a man before?

917
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,520
No.

918
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:39,250
You ever splatter a man's brains
up against the wall?

919
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,171
No.

920
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:45,253
You ever took a big, shiny blade
and just ripped a man
from his ass to his appetite?

921
00:55:45,253 --> 00:55:49,095
- No.
- Then cut his balls off and
made him squeal like a pig?

922
00:55:49,574 --> 00:55:51,976
Hammer. Hammer!
And then stuffed 'em
in his mouth and...

923
00:55:52,456 --> 00:55:53,897
Okay.

924
00:55:54,377 --> 00:55:56,297
It's all right.

925
00:55:56,778 --> 00:56:00,621
- Well, have you?
- No, but I been trained
to go out...

926
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:03,502
Hey, man, no way.
This cat get
all our asses killed.

927
00:56:03,982 --> 00:56:06,384
Man, look at him.
He look funny.
Look how he's lookin' at us.

928
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,305
I can handle myself.

929
00:56:08,305 --> 00:56:10,225
Oh, yeah?

930
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:16,821
What makes you think
you can be a black hero?

931
00:56:19,703 --> 00:56:21,624
I'm an ex-football player.

932
00:56:31,229 --> 00:56:33,630
Hey! Kung Fu Joe.
Oh, my brothers.

933
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,550
I see you started without me.

934
00:56:36,031 --> 00:56:37,472
Hiii! How are you?

935
00:56:37,953 --> 00:56:40,353
What's happenin'?

936
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:43,235
- Kung Fu!
- My man! Hyah!

937
00:56:43,235 --> 00:56:45,636
Hey, man, look, now that we're
here, what's happenin'?

938
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:47,558
Here's the deal.

939
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:51,400
The first thing we do
is disrupt Big's businesses.
Break 'em all up.

940
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,761
The next thing is, we harass
all of his people.

941
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:58,123
Now look, once the deal goes
down, ain't no backin' off.

942
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,965
They killed my teacher!
Why, why, why, why, why?

943
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:05,327
Teacher! Teacher!

944
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:08,208
Wow!

945
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:11,570
Master Lee was
your kung fu teacher?

946
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,451
No. Acting.

947
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:17,813
Let's get that sucka.

948
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:24,056
All right, guys, this is it.

949
00:57:24,056 --> 00:57:25,978
Mr. Big's hottest night spot.

950
00:57:25,978 --> 00:57:30,299
Every criminal and major player
in town is inside.

951
00:57:32,701 --> 00:57:35,102
Gentlemen, you gotta have big
hats to come in here.

952
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:37,023
That's the rules of the house.

953
00:57:37,504 --> 00:57:40,032
I think you're gonna make an
exception this time, brother.

954
00:57:40,513 --> 00:57:42,434
All right, okay.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

955
00:57:47,236 --> 00:57:49,637
Hey, are y'all crazy?

956
00:57:49,637 --> 00:57:52,038
Don't you know
this is Mr. Big's place?

957
00:57:52,038 --> 00:57:55,400
Looks like you just lost
your liquor license.

958
00:58:00,075 --> 00:58:02,477
Everybody get your hands up,

959
00:58:02,477 --> 00:58:05,359
Take that funky gold
off your necks,

960
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:08,720
and put it on the table
right now!

961
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:12,689
Let's go. Hurry up.

962
00:58:18,564 --> 00:58:20,966
Okay, you guys, come out from
under those hats.

963
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:23,367
Come on!

964
00:58:23,736 --> 00:58:25,176
Wayne Evans!

965
00:58:25,529 --> 00:58:27,450
The Evans Family!

966
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,259
- Fifth grade!

967
00:58:29,738 --> 00:58:33,454
I want my nickel!
Give me my nickel back!

968
00:58:33,454 --> 00:58:36,814
This is for your brother!
Let's just say I ain't forgot!
No! Come on, man!

969
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:39,103
I ain't forgot!
I ain't forgot fifth grade!

970
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:41,858
Hey, man, from the waist down,
you're mine!

971
00:58:41,858 --> 00:58:45,827
Yeah? Get on a ladder
and see how tough you are!
Let me put you in a chair!

972
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:48,469
I was gonna buy a scooter pie
with that money, man!

973
00:58:48,948 --> 00:58:50,869
Jack, shut up! Shut up!

974
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:53,272
Now, all y'all listen up here!

975
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:56,633
Don't try to follow us,
'cause all your cars
are on blocks.

976
00:58:56,633 --> 00:59:00,955
But don't worry. The police'll
be here to take y'all to jail.

977
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:04,316
And you tell
the rest of your family,
when I see 'em, they mine!

978
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:06,718
They mine!

979
00:59:06,718 --> 00:59:08,639
And Lois Mitchell too!

980
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:17,043
## Who's makin' love ##

981
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:19,445
## to your old lady ##

982
00:59:19,445 --> 00:59:21,846
## are you out makin' love ##

983
00:59:21,846 --> 00:59:25,207
Come out of there!
Move it! Move it!

984
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:27,128
Let's go! Come on!

985
00:59:27,128 --> 00:59:30,490
Come on, let's go!
Move, move, move, move!

986
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,411
Let's go!

987
00:59:33,371 --> 00:59:35,292
Let's go! Come on!

988
00:59:35,292 --> 00:59:37,213
Get out of here!

989
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:42,497
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

990
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:45,858
- Can I get a little coffee?
- Sure, just a moment.
We got your greasy dairy.

991
00:59:45,858 --> 00:59:48,499
Miss, I'd like a little
coffee here, please!

992
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:52,822
I just want a little coffee.

993
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,743
These cramps are killing me.

994
00:59:54,743 --> 00:59:56,904
I'd like a little coffee,
please!

995
00:59:57,256 --> 01:00:00,619
What are you, deaf?
Can I get a little coffee?
Please?

996
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:02,540
Cheryl, you okay?

997
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,901
I think I'd better go home.

998
01:00:06,382 --> 01:00:08,783
- It's my time.
- Girl, me too.

999
01:00:09,744 --> 01:00:13,105
I'm gonna go and lay down.
Okay?

1000
01:00:13,105 --> 01:00:15,505
I know exactly how you feel.

1001
01:00:15,505 --> 01:00:17,426
Be strong.

1002
01:01:09,663 --> 01:01:13,024
All right, sweet thing, it's
time to come home to daddy.

1003
01:01:13,984 --> 01:01:17,347
Please, please,
just leave me alone.

1004
01:01:17,347 --> 01:01:20,228
Bitch, I said
you comin' with me.

1005
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,714
Oh, shit!
You must got the devil in you!

1006
01:01:33,675 --> 01:01:35,597
No!

1007
01:01:35,597 --> 01:01:37,517
Cramps!

1008
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:47,122
I asked you nicely.

1009
01:01:47,602 --> 01:01:51,443
Now I'm going to
rip your balls off!

1010
01:01:55,286 --> 01:01:57,207
You okay, Lenny?

1011
01:01:57,688 --> 01:02:00,088
Yeah. It's a good thing
you came, boy.

1012
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:02,970
Yeah, 'cause I heard you
screamin' all the way down there.

1013
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:05,372
I wasn't screamin'!
All right?

1014
01:02:05,852 --> 01:02:07,773
- Yes, you was...
- I said I wasn't screamin'.

1015
01:02:08,254 --> 01:02:10,174
- I was whistlin'.
- You was what?

1016
01:02:10,174 --> 01:02:12,094
I was whistlin' for you!

1017
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:15,937
You was whistlin',
"Willie, help get this bitch
off of me"?

1018
01:02:15,937 --> 01:02:17,858
Yeah!

1019
01:02:17,858 --> 01:02:21,219
Now get her butt in the car
before she wake up again.

1020
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:43,872
Nobody, but I mean nobody
does this to me and lives.

1021
01:02:43,872 --> 01:02:45,792
Give me lieutenant Baker
on the phone.

1022
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:48,674
Leonard.

1023
01:02:48,674 --> 01:02:51,075
Take the girl to the hideout.
Yes, Mr. Big.

1024
01:02:51,075 --> 01:02:54,437
- Lt. Baker is on the line.
- Hello, Baker. This is Big.

1025
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:56,358
What the hell happened
last night?

1026
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:59,239
That soldier boy and his goons
hit every one of my operations.

1027
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:02,121
He stole everyone's drugs,
money and gold chains.

1028
01:03:02,602 --> 01:03:05,963
I want you to help me
find those bastards that hit me
and get rid of 'em!

1029
01:03:05,963 --> 01:03:08,364
How am I gonna do that?
I'm a cop.

1030
01:03:08,844 --> 01:03:12,687
I don't give a damn how. Set 'em
up or something. Just do it.

1031
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:25,525
You wanna get out of the car?

1032
01:03:25,525 --> 01:03:26,966
What's the problem, officer?

1033
01:03:27,446 --> 01:03:29,367
Just step out of the car.

1034
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:33,690
The door is ajar.

1035
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:36,571
- Get your hands on the hood.
- Please close the door.

1036
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:39,933
Your door is ajar.

1037
01:03:40,173 --> 01:03:41,614
Look what we got here.

1038
01:03:42,094 --> 01:03:44,496
I said, close the door,
shithead!

1039
01:03:44,975 --> 01:03:46,895
So you want to try
and set me up, huh?

1040
01:03:47,376 --> 01:03:49,778
## Everybody
was kung fu fighting ##

1041
01:03:51,219 --> 01:03:55,061
## Those cats
were fast as lightning ##

1042
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:59,143
## In fact, it was
a little bit frightening ##

1043
01:04:00,824 --> 01:04:02,264
## But they did it
with expert timing ####

1044
01:04:02,745 --> 01:04:06,106
Your arm! Spare ribs!
Have a nice nap!

1045
01:04:08,509 --> 01:04:12,350
Ohh, I'm gonna
kick some ass now.

1046
01:04:23,395 --> 01:04:28,198
So, just you 57 punks
against Kung Fu Joe?

1047
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:32,889
Master of karate,
kung fu, jujitsu...

1048
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,249
And all other shit
you ain't never heard of!

1049
01:04:41,533 --> 01:04:44,415
Hey!
You boys goin' somewhere?

1050
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:56,422
How come their guns are so much
bigger than ours?

1051
01:04:56,422 --> 01:04:58,934
It's a phallic thing.
I don't know.

1052
01:05:00,854 --> 01:05:03,256
Oh, no!
Hey, what are you doing?

1053
01:05:03,736 --> 01:05:05,177
Get off of me!

1054
01:05:05,177 --> 01:05:08,299
Ohh! Oh, no!

1055
01:05:13,101 --> 01:05:15,984
Hey, sorry, man.
I don't know that karate.

1056
01:05:15,984 --> 01:05:17,904
Me neither.

1057
01:05:17,904 --> 01:05:20,306
- You wanna fake it?
- I don't care.

1058
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:28,230
No!
I didn't shoot you!

1059
01:05:28,709 --> 01:05:31,959
I could've shot you.
I made sure that I missed.
I did.

1060
01:05:31,959 --> 01:05:33,880
Wait a minute!
Wait one minute!

1061
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,762
You got a .45 revolver
that holds six bullets.

1062
01:05:36,762 --> 01:05:40,124
I counted at least 20 shots,
and you never reloaded.

1063
01:05:40,124 --> 01:05:42,525
- That's right.
- Come on!

1064
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:44,927
Hold it!
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1065
01:05:44,927 --> 01:05:47,327
Hold it.
That's Big's nephew.

1066
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:49,488
He just might come in handy.

1067
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,281
You okay, man?

1068
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:54,163
All that damn runnin', man,
got my feet hurtin'.

1069
01:05:54,643 --> 01:05:57,045
But other than that,
I'm all right.

1070
01:05:57,525 --> 01:05:59,445
We'd better go find Slade.

1071
01:06:06,058 --> 01:06:08,459
Five, four, three, two.

1072
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,221
- Hello?
- Slade?

1073
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:17,103
- Yeah.
- It's Joe.

1074
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:20,465
I've come to warn you...

1075
01:06:20,465 --> 01:06:22,866
They tried to ambush me.

1076
01:06:23,827 --> 01:06:26,708
And now they're going to
try and ambush you...

1077
01:06:28,629 --> 01:06:30,070
and the brothers.

1078
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,953
I fooled you.
I'm not home right now.

1079
01:06:33,432 --> 01:06:36,313
- Leave your name and number.
I'll call you back.
- Say what?

1080
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:39,675
- Thanks for calling. Bye.
- He ain't home?

1081
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:42,557
Aw, homey ain't home.

1082
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:47,679
- I've gotta find Cheryl.
- And just how you plan
on doin' that?

1083
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,560
We don't even know
where they're holdin' her.

1084
01:06:52,002 --> 01:06:55,363
Yeah? Well, I bet
my man over here does.

1085
01:06:58,245 --> 01:07:01,126
Well, I'm glad you finally
figured something out,
G.I. Joe.

1086
01:07:01,126 --> 01:07:04,007
But I'm not tellin' you shit.
So how you like me now?

1087
01:07:04,007 --> 01:07:06,169
Yes, you will.

1088
01:07:07,129 --> 01:07:09,530
Well, my pretty,

1089
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:13,373
Soon it'll be you and me.

1090
01:07:13,373 --> 01:07:17,215
By midnight, your lover and his
friends will be dead...

1091
01:07:17,695 --> 01:07:21,057
and you will be Mr. Big's
big moneymaker.

1092
01:07:21,057 --> 01:07:23,938
Yes, you will.

1093
01:07:24,418 --> 01:07:25,859
## War##

1094
01:07:25,859 --> 01:07:26,819
## Yeah ##

1095
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,740
## What is it good for ##

1096
01:07:29,221 --> 01:07:30,662
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

1097
01:07:30,662 --> 01:07:33,063
## Uh-huh, uh-huh ##
## War ##

1098
01:07:33,063 --> 01:07:35,464
## Huhh ##
## Yeah ##

1099
01:07:35,464 --> 01:07:37,385
## What is it good for ##

1100
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:38,826
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

1101
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,748
## Say it again, y'all ##

1102
01:07:40,748 --> 01:07:42,669
## War, look out ##

1103
01:07:42,669 --> 01:07:45,422
## What is it good for ##

1104
01:07:45,422 --> 01:07:46,382
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

1105
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,744
## Listen to me
Ohhh, war ##

1106
01:07:49,744 --> 01:07:51,665
## I despise ##

1107
01:07:52,145 --> 01:07:54,546
## 'Cause it means
destruction ##

1108
01:07:55,026 --> 01:07:57,667
## of innocent lives ##

1109
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:00,790
## War means tears to
thousands of mothers' eyes ##

1110
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:03,191
## When their sons
go off to fight ##

1111
01:08:03,191 --> 01:08:05,592
## and lose their lives ##

1112
01:08:05,592 --> 01:08:09,322
## I said, war, huhh
good god, y'all ##

1113
01:08:09,322 --> 01:08:11,242
## What is it good for ##

1114
01:08:11,242 --> 01:08:12,923
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

1115
01:08:13,404 --> 01:08:16,285
## Say it again ##
## War ##

1116
01:08:16,285 --> 01:08:17,726
## Whoa-ohh-ohh, lord ##

1117
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,128
## What is it good for ##

1118
01:08:20,128 --> 01:08:21,089
## Absolutely ##
## Nothin' ##

1119
01:08:21,568 --> 01:08:23,009
## Listen to me ##

1120
01:08:23,009 --> 01:08:24,450
## War ##
## It ain't nothin'
but a heartbreak ##

1121
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:27,331
Hey, man, are you sure
you got enough?

1122
01:08:27,331 --> 01:08:29,733
You can never have enough,
brother.

1123
01:08:29,733 --> 01:08:32,134
## Ohh, war ##

1124
01:08:32,134 --> 01:08:35,735
## Is an enemy
to all mankind ##

1125
01:08:35,735 --> 01:08:39,209
## The thought of war
blows my mind ##

1126
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,223
Oh, jesus!
My nuts!

1127
01:09:02,629 --> 01:09:06,472
Hammer! Hammer!
Are you all right, man?

1128
01:09:08,505 --> 01:09:10,426
Did we get
that son of a bitch?

1129
01:09:10,906 --> 01:09:14,268
Hold on, brother. We got an
ambulance on the way.

1130
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,111
Let's get that sucka!

1131
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,912
You think I'm cute?

1132
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,715
I'm cute, right?

1133
01:09:27,715 --> 01:09:30,116
Mm-hmm.
I'm cuter than Jack?

1134
01:09:34,678 --> 01:09:36,600
There she is!

1135
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,481
There's only a few guys guarding
her, but I don't see Mr. Big.

1136
01:09:39,481 --> 01:09:41,402
Let me see it.

1137
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,165
Yeah.

1138
01:09:47,165 --> 01:09:50,046
Look, here's the plan.

1139
01:09:50,046 --> 01:09:52,895
I'll take this rope and repel
down the wall over there,

1140
01:09:52,895 --> 01:09:55,729
take one of these bombs,
crash through the window
causing a diversion.

1141
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:59,571
Once I'm inside, Jack, you go
through that window,

1142
01:10:00,052 --> 01:10:01,492
and Slammer,
go through that door.

1143
01:10:01,973 --> 01:10:04,855
How come I can't go
through the window?
I never get to no more.

1144
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:06,776
Well, pardon fuckin' me, then.

1145
01:10:07,256 --> 01:10:09,626
Okay, you crash through
the goddamn window,

1146
01:10:09,626 --> 01:10:11,545
and Jack,
you go through the door.

1147
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:13,467
Got it.

1148
01:10:13,467 --> 01:10:17,549
I'll start at the top,
you get at the bottom, and if
we're lucky we'll survive this.

1149
01:10:17,549 --> 01:10:19,950
Lift!
Ohh!

1150
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:22,351
Give me a hand.

1151
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:15,532
You farted?

1152
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:18,061
Slade! Slade, come in!

1153
01:11:19,982 --> 01:11:22,496
You ready?

1154
01:11:25,857 --> 01:11:27,297
Nobody move!

1155
01:11:43,147 --> 01:11:44,587
Are you all right?

1156
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:48,428
Man, I'm all right.
It's been a long time.
I'm just a little rusty.

1157
01:11:48,428 --> 01:11:51,791
## Here we go, here we go ##

1158
01:12:05,717 --> 01:12:07,638
Weasel... What?

1159
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:09,560
What happened to you, Weasel?

1160
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:13,401
Soldier boy!

1161
01:12:13,401 --> 01:12:16,282
Oh, damn!
The soldier boy is here, man!

1162
01:12:23,487 --> 01:12:25,888
Jack! I'm hit!

1163
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:31,651
Shit.
You okay?

1164
01:12:31,651 --> 01:12:33,572
I'm hit.

1165
01:12:33,572 --> 01:12:35,492
Where you... Where you hit at?

1166
01:12:35,492 --> 01:12:37,413
In my foot.

1167
01:12:37,413 --> 01:12:39,335
Oh, my god.

1168
01:12:39,335 --> 01:12:42,216
They shot me in my bunion, man.

1169
01:12:42,216 --> 01:12:44,618
Damn, man, I can't go on.

1170
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:47,980
W-well, what am I gon' do?

1171
01:12:48,461 --> 01:12:49,901
Get 'em for me, Jack.

1172
01:12:50,382 --> 01:12:53,263
I c... But I can't!
I can't go alone!

1173
01:12:53,263 --> 01:12:55,184
You're down,
and Slade's not here!

1174
01:12:55,184 --> 01:12:57,106
I c...

1175
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,027
Slade!

1176
01:12:59,027 --> 01:13:01,426
Ain't nobody
shootin' my baby.

1177
01:13:01,426 --> 01:13:03,347
Ma! Ma, you promised!

1178
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:07,190
Shh! I know I promised.
What am I supposed to do,
stand by while they kill you?

1179
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,831
- Let's get out of here.
Follow me.
- No, you follow me.

1180
01:13:10,311 --> 01:13:12,713
- Follow me!
- I don't care who follows who.

1181
01:13:13,192 --> 01:13:17,035
If y'all step on my bunion,
I'll kill both of you.

1182
01:13:17,035 --> 01:13:20,877
- You gon' be okay, man?
- I'll be okay.

1183
01:13:20,877 --> 01:13:23,278
I can do it, man.

1184
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:25,198
I won't let you down.

1185
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,962
You gotta put that foot
in some epsom salts,
get that swellin' outta there.

1186
01:13:31,442 --> 01:13:33,363
- Come on, mama!
- Let's get outta here.

1187
01:13:37,686 --> 01:13:39,607
Through that door!
Go, go, go!

1188
01:13:40,567 --> 01:13:43,097
Open this door!

1189
01:13:43,097 --> 01:13:44,890
Jack, let me outta here!
Jack!

1190
01:13:45,371 --> 01:13:48,251
Jack! Jack!
Let me outta here!

1191
01:13:48,731 --> 01:13:52,461
Open this door!
Slade? Anybody!

1192
01:14:04,628 --> 01:14:06,549
## Hard-core military ##

1193
01:14:48,282 --> 01:14:49,723
Jack!

1194
01:14:51,163 --> 01:14:53,085
Jack!

1195
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:06,900
Jack!

1196
01:15:11,703 --> 01:15:13,624
Aaah!
My eyes!

1197
01:15:22,269 --> 01:15:24,670
My eyes! My eyes!

1198
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:41,479
Get me outta here!
I missed you too, muffin.

1199
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:44,600
Oh, this?
This hurt real bad.

1200
01:15:45,081 --> 01:15:47,002
But I'm okay, you know.

1201
01:15:47,114 --> 01:15:50,475
All right, soldier boy.
Party's over, baby.
Where you want your bullet?

1202
01:15:51,564 --> 01:15:53,004
Where you want it?

1203
01:15:53,356 --> 01:15:56,718
## He's a Flyguy ##

1204
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,639
Chill it, brother.

1205
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:05,011
I wouldn't do that
if I was you... Chump.

1206
01:16:08,853 --> 01:16:11,255
Man, I don't know who you are,
but I owe you one.

1207
01:16:11,255 --> 01:16:14,135
Now, you...
Where's Big?

1208
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:17,977
Forget about Big.
Grab the chick.
Let's split.

1209
01:16:17,977 --> 01:16:19,899
Not so fast, boys!

1210
01:16:19,899 --> 01:16:23,261
Nobody moves,
or the girl gets it first.

1211
01:16:23,261 --> 01:16:25,182
Get over there!

1212
01:16:26,142 --> 01:16:29,024
You?
You're Mr. Big?

1213
01:16:30,464 --> 01:16:32,946
- But I thought you were...
- What?

1214
01:16:33,425 --> 01:16:37,218
Above playing
an exploitation villain?
Well, you're wrong!

1215
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:40,709
Lots of famous people have
done exploitation movies.

1216
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:43,111
Uh, Shelley Winters
was in...

1217
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:45,271
Cleopatra Jones.

1218
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:47,866
Uh, Angie Dickinson.

1219
01:16:47,866 --> 01:16:50,266
- Uh, Big Bad Mama!
- Big Bad Mama.

1220
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:52,556
Jamie Lee Curtis?

1221
01:16:53,036 --> 01:16:54,477
Halloween!
Right, right, right!

1222
01:16:54,957 --> 01:16:56,878
And now I'm Mr. Big.

1223
01:16:57,359 --> 01:16:58,800
And I'm sorry, boys,

1224
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,680
But there ain't gonna be
a sequel to this one.

1225
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,121
Don't try it, Big.

1226
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:13,207
I got you, sucka.

1227
01:17:23,292 --> 01:17:25,212
You did it, Jack.

1228
01:17:26,173 --> 01:17:28,575
You did it.

1229
01:17:28,575 --> 01:17:31,456
Yeah.
Yeah, I did it.

1230
01:17:42,022 --> 01:17:43,943
Let's go home.

1231
01:17:44,423 --> 01:17:46,344
Okay.

1232
01:17:46,344 --> 01:17:48,745
- What about him?
- Ah, let him go.

1233
01:17:48,745 --> 01:17:50,185
Hey, thanks, man.

1234
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,587
I promise, man,
I'm gon' go straight.

1235
01:17:53,067 --> 01:17:56,430
- Yeah, well, you know
there's two ways out of here.
- Oh, man!

1236
01:17:56,909 --> 01:18:01,472
All y'all just kiss
my natural black ass!

1237
01:18:06,275 --> 01:18:09,108
Didn't he know
about the elevator?

1238
01:18:09,108 --> 01:18:10,757
Okay, let's go!

1239
01:18:13,637 --> 01:18:15,559
Let's move it!
Move it!

1240
01:18:19,881 --> 01:18:21,802
Watch your head.

1241
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:30,447
Looks like I'd better
go check my flypaper,
see what's stickin'.

1242
01:18:30,447 --> 01:18:32,368
You owe me one.

1243
01:18:32,368 --> 01:18:34,290
And you got it.

1244
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:36,210
Get in that car!
Watch your head.

1245
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,610
Hey, Peterson,
clear this mess up.
You got it.

1246
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:41,012
What about Hammer and Slammer?

1247
01:18:41,012 --> 01:18:43,894
Hammer'll be all right.
A few flesh wounds.

1248
01:18:43,894 --> 01:18:47,255
It seems that bullets
have a difficult time
finding his vital parts.

1249
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:50,617
And Slammer, well,
it'll be a while before
he wears any tight shoes.

1250
01:18:50,617 --> 01:18:55,532
Jack! Jack Spade!
I will never forgive you
for lockin' me in that closet.

1251
01:18:55,532 --> 01:18:58,894
How could you do that
to your mama?
Huh? How could you?

1252
01:18:59,374 --> 01:19:02,736
M-ma, now listen.
I can ex...
You can explain?

1253
01:19:02,736 --> 01:19:08,018
Explain how I laid up in that
hospital for 36 hours in labor,
tryin' to give birth to you!

1254
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:09,459
I almost died.

1255
01:19:09,939 --> 01:19:14,742
Explain how I sacrificed
my entire life for you,
tryin' to raise you right!

1256
01:19:15,223 --> 01:19:17,143
Explain!
Bell. Bell.

1257
01:19:17,623 --> 01:19:20,025
I told him to do it.

1258
01:19:20,025 --> 01:19:21,947
How could you,
Slade?

1259
01:19:21,947 --> 01:19:25,787
Because I love you,
and I wanted to make sure
we'd be together again.

1260
01:19:25,787 --> 01:19:28,188
Oh, Slade.
Oh, baby.

1261
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:34,432
- Yo, Jack, what's up, man?
- Yo, B.D.P.

1262
01:19:37,441 --> 01:19:40,804
Jack, who are these guys?

1263
01:19:40,804 --> 01:19:43,205
That's my theme music.

1264
01:19:43,205 --> 01:19:45,607
Every good hero
should have some.

1265
01:19:46,086 --> 01:19:47,526
See you around.

1266
01:19:48,006 --> 01:19:50,409
## Again we start
let me say my part ##

1267
01:19:50,409 --> 01:19:52,330
## About the only guy
who has some heart ##

1268
01:19:52,809 --> 01:19:55,691
## It took some time
for the heart to come
but it's here ##

1269
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:57,132
## And everybody's in fear ##

1270
01:19:57,132 --> 01:19:59,533
## Crashin' through
the door of that whore ##

1271
01:19:59,533 --> 01:20:01,454
## Bringin' an end
to this gold chain war ##

1272
01:20:01,454 --> 01:20:04,336
## What you saw
KRS-ONE is now seeing ##

1273
01:20:04,336 --> 01:20:05,777
## Another fly human being ##

1274
01:20:05,777 --> 01:20:08,177
## Making no excuses
for the losers ##

1275
01:20:08,177 --> 01:20:10,580
## Chain snatchers, pimps
drug abusers ##

1276
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,980
## You don't like it
but you gotta keep pushing ##

1277
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,861
## Until somebody starts
mushing all these suckers ##

1278
01:20:15,861 --> 01:20:17,302
## Claimin' to rule
they environment ##

1279
01:20:17,302 --> 01:20:19,224
## No, man
I ain't buyin' it ##

1280
01:20:19,224 --> 01:20:22,105
## You seem to think that
everybody can be taught ##

1281
01:20:22,105 --> 01:20:23,546
## That everyone else
can be bought ##

1282
01:20:23,546 --> 01:20:26,427
## But you took it short
'cause one guy
hasn't been paid ##

1283
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:37,614
Slade. I must Slade.

1284
01:24:37,685 --> 01:24:40,076
Kung Fu Joe is here!

1285
01:24:42,488 --> 01:24:45,838
I'm sorry, buddy. They've already gone.

1286
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,596
Yo, bro, you got a Band-Aid?
