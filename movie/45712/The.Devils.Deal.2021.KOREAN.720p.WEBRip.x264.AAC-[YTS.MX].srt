00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,445
This film is a work of fiction.

4
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:36,824
Names, characters, places and incidents
are a product of filmmakers' imagination.

5
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,746
Honorable citizens of Korea,

6
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:43,706
it's been 20 years!

7
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:47,000
20 years since I dove into

8
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:49,545
the world of politics,
I, Jeon Hae-woong,

9
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:52,172
will become a congressman.

10
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:54,174
I may not have much,

11
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:57,636
but I will not compromise
to lies and injustice,

12
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:02,891
and I'll become a just politician
who will side with the weak!

13
00:01:02,892 --> 00:01:05,351
With a landslide victory,

14
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:09,440
I will thank and repay
you for your votes!

15
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:13,068
This is not my victory alone,

16
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,778
it is our victory,

17
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:19,659
moreover, it will be a victory for
Republic of Korea's democracy!

18
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:25,289
Well, well... "Republic of
Korea" seems too much.

19
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,334
<i>Korea's democracy</i>

20
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:45,851
<i>Busan
March, 1992</i>

21
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:49,020

22
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:52,023

<i>To capture the popular sentiment, many

24
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:59,698
<i>President Roh Tae-woo

<i>and presents various

<i>and vows to turn Metropolitan Busan

Jesus Christ.

28
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:15,088
Redevelopment is always part
of every election campaign.

29
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:18,550
Do they also plant trees
that grow money?

30
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:20,135
Sons of bitches.

31
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,137
They'll announce it,

32
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:23,471
jack up the land value,

33
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:26,057
kick out the residents!

34
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:28,810
And they'll fill up their
own pot bellies, not?

35
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,311
Those bastards...

36
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:31,396
Am I right, Rep. Jeon?

37
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:35,527
They can't redevelop on a
whim like they did before.

38
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,988
The world has changed, and
so has Democratic Party.

39
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,367
And Busan's Haeundae has
me, what's there to worry?

40
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:45,410
Is this better?

41
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:48,038
You're the problem!

42
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,456
Because pricks like you
are getting into politics!

43
00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:52,293
Honey, long time no see...

44
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:54,753
See?

45
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:57,005
That's what you say to your wife?

46
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:59,174
Honey bun, don't say that
on this wonderful day.

47
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:01,051
How about we take
10? You two can chat...

48
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:02,010
Good! Break time.

49
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,929
No, let's just get it
over with, I'm busy.

50
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,180
- Hurry, hurry.
- She's busy.

51
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:07,140
- Busy?
- Yeah, very.

52
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:09,392
- I'll stand on this side.
- Yes, very nice.

53
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:11,145
All right, one, two.

54
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,105
Raise your hand.

55
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:16,482
Come home for once, mother's sick.

56
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:17,525
Again?

57
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:20,987
Probably faking it
since she misses you.

58
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:22,739
All right, that's enough.

59
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,117
She must really love her son
who doesn't make any money.

60
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,077
Come on, smile.

61
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:29,746
You'll be the wife of
a congressman soon.

62
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:32,082
Once I get this win, you'll
get your own driver.

63
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,876
I'll also win 3, 4 terms and more!

64
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:37,796
I don't need all that, just
get your shit together.

65
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:39,505
Can't we live ordinary lives?

66
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:42,634
I'm not doing this for my own sake.

67
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:45,637
- It's for the good of Korea...
- Are we done?

68
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:48,056
Yeah, done, all done.

69
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:49,808
Yeah, I guess so...

70
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:52,018
- We got plenty.
- More than enough.

71
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,479
Very well.

72
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,858
Leaving so soon? Not gonna have lunch?

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,819
This is for meals, not booze!

74
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,990
It's a sure thing, once
I get the party nom.

75
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:07,201
A nomination equals elected!

76
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:11,455
Let's take 5.

77
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:13,708
She's usually very respectful.

78
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:29,932
<i>Haeundae Residential

79
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:32,309

00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,150
- Welcome!
- Thank you.

82
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:41,192
Good work.

83
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,361
Hello, nice to see you.

84
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:44,071
Hello there.

85
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:46,281
- Hey, Hae-woong!
- Let's go up.

86
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:47,602
- You must be tired.
- Not at all.

87
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,493
Redevelopment?

88
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:53,830
Is that as easy as
drawing a line on a map?

89
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,707
So what's happening now?

90
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,211
Even the president
is floating the idea!

91
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:01,713
What will happen then?

92
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:05,425
All the rich folks in the country,

93
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:09,429
developers and big construction
companies will zero in!

94
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,097
So, what do we do about it?

95
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:14,017
They'll come with bundles
of cash and shovels!

96
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:16,144
Should we sell our land?

97
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:17,103
No way!

98
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:20,774
Don't ever sell your land
and resist at all costs!

99
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:23,694
Who will be kicked out
of our homes? Us!

100
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,486
- Who'll get the boot?
- Us!

101
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:27,030
- Who?
- Us!

102
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,908
- Madame, who?
- Us!

103
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:31,952
When I'm elected,

104
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:34,037
I'll become the voice of you all,

105
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:38,625
and fight this with everything I got!

106
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:41,044
Good!

107
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,921
You're the only one on our side!

108
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:43,464
Thank you!

109
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,173

<i>Seoul
March 1992</i>

112
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:51,388
$500M?

113
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,766
Combined with general
election, we're looking at $1B.

114
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:57,894
Don't you know the legal limit
for presidential campaign fund?

115
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:00,731
It's under $40M, $36.7M to be exact.

116
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:04,110
What kind of idiot put on a
campaign with that money?

117
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:09,572
Losing the general election means
losing the presidential election.

118
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:11,700
It's the end of the
world as we know it.

119
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:16,537
<i>Busan Metropolitan City Development Proposal</i>
This is our only option at the moment.

120
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:18,957
Use this to for seed money,

121
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:23,378
and once we increase the ratings,
corporations will back us.

122
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:27,215
Busan port is at its limit,
so development is crucial,

123
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:30,093
<i>therefore it'll be easy
to rake in the funds.</i>

124
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:32,763
<i>I'll gather some VIPs from there.</i>

125
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:34,306
I'll go there myself.

126
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:39,520
There is someone who controls Busan.

127
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:42,688
<i>His name is Kwon Soon-tae,</i>

128
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:47,444
<i>money or land, everything
goes through him.</i>

129
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,867
Are we in the '70s?

130
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,287
You can't dabble into everything.

131
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:02,209
You must focus on one district
to get the cash flowing.

132
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,711
<i>Haeundae Development Amended Proposal</i>

133
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:08,966
This is the only one right now.

134
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:13,470
What? Haeundae?

135
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:17,182
Wait, rezone this district?

136
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,641
It's the cream of the crop.

137
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:21,813
Should I work up a storm
in the whole city then?

138
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,689
You up for it?

139
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,275
No, that's not what I meant...

140
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:29,278
Let's do it his way.

141
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:32,823
We are in a state of emergency.

142
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:36,326
We must trust Mr. Kwon's judgment.

143
00:07:36,327 --> 00:07:37,703
To that end...

144
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:42,333
- <i>CV: Jeon Hae-woong</i>
- let's fix the election first.

145
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,626
What are you doing?

146
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:47,587
Our work can't be done by just anybody.

147
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:50,549
But the nomination will
be announced in 2 days...

148
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:06,690
This is Park Yong-sik,
he's obedient and kind.

149
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,567
He passed the bar while
attending Seoul U.

150
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:11,611
But even so...

151
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:13,654
He's a newbie!

152
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:14,907
I will

153
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:18,119
get it done.

154
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,252
- Director Moon.
- Sir?

155
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,630
Got any insider tip?

156
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:37,637
Buy some land behind the
bowling alley in Jaesong.

157
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:39,180
Why? What's up?

158
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:42,059
Don't ask any questions, just buy some.

159
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,189
That's the place?

160
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:49,942
Yes, that's the place.

161
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,404
Good evening.

162
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:56,489
Look who it is!

163
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,158
Rep. Jeon is here!

164
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,825
- Good to see you.
- Have you been well?

165
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:00,826
You came!

166
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:02,412
I'm sorry for being late, sir.

167
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:03,621
Not at all.

168
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:06,291
You're bound for greatness,
just you being here is a boon.

169
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,333
- Hey there.
- Hello.

170
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:08,669
- Rep. Jeon.
- Sir.

171
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:12,798
Hey, it's been a while,
I heard you were busy.

172
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:16,801
You're the busiest
man, and he's second.

173
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:18,137
I'm not that busy at all.

174
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,180
Good to see you here.

175
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:23,433
When you go to the congress,
it'll be harder to see you.

176
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,518
I'll have to visit more often.

177
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,978
Very good.

178
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:30,065

and help each other out.

179
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,400

Speaking of which...

184
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,746
Attention everyone!

185
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:48,083
Hae-woong, come on, get up.

186
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:49,585
Yes, of course.

187
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:54,797
Our proud alum Jeon Hae-woong,

188
00:09:54,798 --> 00:10:00,972
will be running for office
at the 14th general election!

189
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:05,601
I'll do my best!

190
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:08,354
All right!

191
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:12,649
Raise your glasses!

192
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:16,570
- We're no!
- Strangers!

193
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,008
Why didn't she put it away?

194
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,717
I'm just saying you got a cute kid.

195
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:41,928
Don't you pull that
gangster crap on me!

196
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:45,681
What's going on, honey?

197
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:47,475
Hey! Let go of her!

198
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:49,269

199

How dare you come here!

207
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:09,789

210
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:20,216
It's not like we're hooligans.

211
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,217
But we're...

212
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:28,975
- Let me help you up.
- Piss off!

213
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:31,812
Is he okay?

214
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,483
My apologies.

215
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:39,861
My boys are a bit on the dumb side.

216
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:45,117
But Rep. Jeon, what'll you do?

217
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,619
We lend you the money
as a show of support

218
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,622
thinking that you'd get the nomination.

219
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,916
But that went to shit,

220
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:56,212
too bad for you.

221
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:01,342
Nomination? What did you say?

222
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:03,050
Are you nuts?

223
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:06,680
You didn't know?

224
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:10,934
You're not in the know?

225
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,020
You're in politics, no less.

226
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,829
Politics isn't some bandwagon,

227
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:34,124
how do you just kick
someone off overnight?

228
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,667
I'm lost for words!

229
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:38,003
Mr. Kwon!

230
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:43,758
This is the crappiest horse
shit I've ever heard, spill it!

231
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,844
You didn't listen and blabbered
on to the residents.

232
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:49,597
If I'm not siding with them,
why am I in politics?

233
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:52,767
Listening to people's
wailings is politics?

234
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:54,353
Is that how I taught you?

235
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:59,149
So you replaced me
with an obedient dog?

236
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,152
You know the pawns in chess?

237
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,862
Do you know what they're for?

238
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:07,949
You use them and kill
them when you want to.

239
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,372
Are you saying I'm a pawn?!

240
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:16,833
What did you think you were?

241
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:25,175

00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:36,936
How many years have
I cleaned your shit?

246
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:38,104
A while.

00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:41,650

But us businessmen don't trust people.

Good morning, Mr. Jeon.

373
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:28,898
We will need a traffic light there.

374
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:30,024

Gosh, sorry to keep you waiting.

376
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:34,988
We had to tour the Jaesong district.

377
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:38,283
So, you're the reporter, huh?

378
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:41,244
They sent a nobody...

379
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,915
How long have you worked as a reporter?

380
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,042
2 years now.

381
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:50,169
Is that a problem?

382
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,963
No, why'd that be a problem?

383
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:55,633
To be honest, aren't
you the bigger nobody?

384
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:58,469
You're a feisty one.

385
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:01,556
How did you fail to clench
the Democratic Party nom?

386
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:05,143
I really like you, Ms. Song Dana.

387
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:08,854
How should I put this,

388
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:13,151
it could be interpreted
as difference in vision.

389
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:18,281
- A cup of coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

390
00:26:21,201 --> 00:26:22,785
I heard you were kicked out?

391
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:27,623
That is one interpretation
of what happened.

392
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:29,375
The real truth is,

393
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:34,588
it was a textbook case of nepotism,

394
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:38,301
during the time when the
president is proclaiming that

395
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:41,303
he only wants "fair election."

396
00:26:41,304 --> 00:26:45,433
I'm the victim of
political machination.

397
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:52,440
You must've felt wronged,
you're just a naïve sheep.

398
00:26:54,317 --> 00:26:55,651
It's all right.

399
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:59,696
I'm not someone who dwell on the past.

400
00:26:59,697 --> 00:27:03,659
There's bound to be trouble
when our goals don't align.

401
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:10,833
A man of justice who
threw away vested rights?

402
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:13,210
That's not bad.

403
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:16,006
How about something that
encapsulates my life...

404
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:20,342
Champion of democracy,
yeah, let's go with that.

405
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:22,428
- Champion of democracy.
- Yeah, that's right.

406
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:28,600
When I was in college,
I participated in protests.

407
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:31,645
I get cold sweat thinking
about those days.

408
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:35,982

01:08:43,741 --> 01:08:46,869
I see it now...

893
01:08:49,287 --> 01:08:51,414
Now I see the whole picture.

894
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,854
I'm thinking of doing
a follow-up in 2 days.

895
01:09:14,855 --> 01:09:17,774
The new city case, right?

896
01:09:17,775 --> 01:09:20,235
Lee will do the follow-up.

897
01:09:21,403 --> 01:09:23,906
Why don't you take a vacation?

898
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:27,284
What are you doing?

899
01:09:29,787 --> 01:09:32,706
Who is it this time?

900
01:09:33,248 --> 01:09:36,375
Whose money did you take?

901
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:37,752
It's not like that.

902
01:09:37,753 --> 01:09:38,962
Then why?

903
01:09:40,839 --> 01:09:42,965
Just do what I say!

904
01:09:42,966 --> 01:09:44,885
Tell me why!

905
01:09:45,803 --> 01:09:46,804
We're told to stop.

906
01:09:47,555 --> 01:09:48,638
By whom?

907
01:09:48,639 --> 01:09:51,058
The one paying our salaries.

908
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:01,902
Even if we got a bad reputation,

909
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,822
this is crossing the line.

910
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:09,075
If you sell yourself to everyone,

911
01:10:09,076 --> 01:10:13,246
how can we call ourselves reporters?

912
01:10:22,798 --> 01:10:24,174
I'm resigning.

913
01:10:27,678 --> 01:10:28,971
Man...

914
01:10:31,724 --> 01:10:35,018
I wanted to cook steaks,
so I built a cowshed.

915
01:10:35,644 --> 01:10:37,354
Then I brought a calve,

916
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,066
fed it and cleaned it too.

917
01:10:43,526 --> 01:10:46,237
But someone else lit the barbecue.

918
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:48,198
So I came to see who it was,

919
01:10:49,157 --> 01:10:51,827
I didn't think you'd be here.

920
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,370
I didn't intend to take what's yours.

921
01:10:54,371 --> 01:10:55,705
I know.

922
01:10:55,706 --> 01:10:59,084
Presidential election's coming
up, the pressure is on,

923
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:02,129
your only way was to use money.

924
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,882
But numbers are a separate matter.

925
01:11:05,883 --> 01:11:11,638
Take Busan's 2 km² out,

926
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:19,395
compensation site is 1 km²,
total compensation is $320M,

927
01:11:19,396 --> 01:11:22,439
market price went up
by 2, but we'll go 50-50,

928
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,027
take out the initial capital,
which comes to $160M,

929
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:29,823
plus bribes from the developers!

930
01:11:31,366 --> 01:11:33,869
Shouldn't I have some stake in it too?

931
01:11:35,913 --> 01:11:39,291
You're sounding more like a capitalist.

932
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:42,836
How will you play politics like that?

933
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:45,547
Remember what you said?

934
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:52,220
To be in politics, either have
a lifeline, or shit ton of money.

935
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:56,809
I'm holding your lifeline.

936
01:11:57,851 --> 01:12:01,813
I also told you to ask for a favor
to someone stronger than you.

937
01:12:01,814 --> 01:12:06,401
"To see who is stronger,
see what they're holding."

938
01:12:09,697 --> 01:12:12,531
All right, let's hear it,
what are you holding?

939
01:12:12,532 --> 01:12:14,576
Obviously, the new city plan,

940
01:12:15,535 --> 01:12:20,622
Democratic Party's suspicious
illegal slush fund sources.

941
01:12:20,623 --> 01:12:23,542
When I sell these to the
opposition before the election,

942
01:12:23,543 --> 01:12:25,795
they'll really have a field day, no?

943
01:12:25,796 --> 01:12:27,922
If you don't want it to come to that,

944
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:33,178
it'd be wiser to bargain with
me at a dirt cheap price.

945
01:12:48,443 --> 01:12:50,153
How much stake are you thinking of?

946
01:12:52,948 --> 01:12:53,948
10%.

947
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,786
As an independent fighter,
I need at least that much.

948
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:08,922
Oh my!

949
01:13:12,843 --> 01:13:14,677
You got ambition, good.

950
01:13:17,514 --> 01:13:18,723
Ambition?

951
01:13:21,018 --> 01:13:26,564
You took that away from me years ago,

952
01:13:28,776 --> 01:13:30,485
this isn't ambition,

953
01:13:32,487 --> 01:13:34,572
it's revenge.

954
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:49,838
You're still quite naïve,
going after revenge and all.

955
01:13:54,717 --> 01:13:56,178
You listen now.

956
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,557
Revenge is one of two things:

957
01:14:01,766 --> 01:14:05,437
either beat him to death,

958
01:14:07,147 --> 01:14:09,274
or be on the same side.

959
01:14:10,567 --> 01:14:12,986
If you don't go all the way,

960
01:14:16,114 --> 01:14:18,200
I'll end up killing you.

961
01:14:31,713 --> 01:14:33,340
I won't wait long.

962
01:14:35,175 --> 01:14:37,260
I'll prep a large safe.

963
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:44,101
Hae-woong.

964
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:47,938
Clench your fist tightly.

965
01:14:49,772 --> 01:14:52,860
Or your lifeline will slip through.

966
01:14:55,278 --> 01:14:57,405
Don't you worry about me.

967
01:15:09,792 --> 01:15:10,792
Song!

968
01:15:12,337 --> 01:15:13,380
Hey, Song!

969
01:15:14,214 --> 01:15:16,008
Make your own damn coffee!

970
01:15:16,884 --> 01:15:17,758
I'm sick of you all...

971
01:15:17,759 --> 01:15:20,720
No, answer this call,
someone's asking for you!

972
01:15:24,849 --> 01:15:26,434
This is Song Dana.

973
01:15:28,728 --> 01:15:29,812
A tip?

974
01:15:34,401 --> 01:15:35,903
Stop the car.

975
01:15:53,378 --> 01:15:54,879
So? What did he say?

976
01:15:58,175 --> 01:16:03,555
We went to a foxhole to catch
a fox, but found a tiger.

977
01:16:06,766 --> 01:16:09,352
There's only one answer then.

978
01:16:10,687 --> 01:16:12,814
We have to catch the tiger.

979
01:16:15,692 --> 01:16:17,069
Pil-do.

980
01:16:18,445 --> 01:16:21,823
When a politician's bank gets fat,

981
01:16:23,533 --> 01:16:25,702
it means there's risk to his life.

982
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,623
What is a risk-free life?

983
01:16:31,374 --> 01:16:34,336
One ankle sprain could lead to death.

984
01:16:36,879 --> 01:16:41,218
Right? You're correct.

985
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,221
There's no turning back now,

986
01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:47,307
all right! Let's do this!

987
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:53,313
Now you feel like a politician.

988
01:17:02,322 --> 01:17:03,322
<i>Incarceration Record</i>

989
01:17:03,323 --> 01:17:06,826
He's one of top Busan
loan sharking gangsters.

990
01:17:07,327 --> 01:17:11,413
During the anti-gang initiative,
all the big names got swooped up,

991
01:17:11,414 --> 01:17:14,792
and he took over the castle.

992
01:17:15,627 --> 01:17:16,753
What's wrong?

993
01:17:17,587 --> 01:17:18,796
It's nothing.

994
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:22,592
He's working with Hae-woong recently.

995
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:26,803
They've been working
together since the election.

996
01:17:26,804 --> 01:17:29,307
Funds from Jung Han-mo,
muscles from Kim Pil-do.

997
01:17:30,767 --> 01:17:31,767
Jung Han-mo?

998
01:17:32,102 --> 01:17:36,773
He worked as a developer
but demolition and scraps too.

999
01:17:37,899 --> 01:17:39,358
He's practically a swindler.

1000
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,738
After the election, he had a fit
about not getting his money back,

1001
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:46,199
it was a shit show.

1002
01:17:46,949 --> 01:17:47,949
So?

1003
01:17:49,744 --> 01:17:51,745
- He's dead.
- How?

1004
01:17:51,746 --> 01:17:54,749
He drunk drove off a cliff.

1005
01:17:57,252 --> 01:17:59,962
So this bastard killed him.

1006
01:18:01,214 --> 01:18:02,757
Put together a script.

1007
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:08,137
But it's...

1008
01:18:08,138 --> 01:18:10,098
Are you on Hae-woong's payroll?

1009
01:18:13,768 --> 01:18:15,395
Christ...

1010
01:18:18,481 --> 01:18:22,069
Start anew, a scenario
that benefits you too.

1011
01:18:23,111 --> 01:18:24,111
I will, sir.

1012
01:18:31,035 --> 01:18:33,288
Push through! Go!

1013
01:18:34,497 --> 01:18:35,497
What the hell?!

1014
01:18:40,044 --> 01:18:43,505
I don't know who you
are, but that's enough.

1015
01:18:43,506 --> 01:18:44,716
Mr. Kim Pil-do?

1016
01:18:45,883 --> 01:18:47,510
So hot in here.

1017
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,055
You need to come with us.

1018
01:18:51,806 --> 01:18:53,849
Where? It's a bad day for a trip.

1019
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:56,269
- You know Jung Han-mo?
- Jung Han-mo?

1020
01:18:59,522 --> 01:19:02,442
Mr. Jung? Yeah, I know him.

1021
01:19:03,025 --> 01:19:04,693
Is he doing well?

1022
01:19:04,694 --> 01:19:08,448
He's dead, and you're
the prime suspect.

1023
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:10,742
May I make a call?

1024
01:19:11,368 --> 01:19:13,203
To Jeon Hae-woong?

1025
01:19:13,828 --> 01:19:15,788
He's indisposed at the moment.

1026
01:19:17,332 --> 01:19:22,462
How crazy would I be
to order a hit on him?

1027
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:29,927
Look, prosecutor, Jung
was my main supporter.

1028
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:33,013
I'm asking because
there's enough plausibility.

1029
01:19:33,014 --> 01:19:34,974
Plausibility?! Really?!

1030
01:19:35,725 --> 01:19:39,060
Why'd you threaten a citizen
with just plausibility?

1031
01:19:39,061 --> 01:19:41,105
Do I look that easy?

1032
01:19:42,815 --> 01:19:45,317
And the investigation looks easy?

1033
01:19:45,318 --> 01:19:47,944
You're a murder suspect!

1034
01:19:47,945 --> 01:19:48,945
Me?

1035
01:19:51,073 --> 01:19:53,743
Didn't he die after getting hammered?

1036
01:19:54,827 --> 01:19:58,664
Alcohol was found in
his lung during autopsy.

1037
01:19:58,665 --> 01:20:00,167
Do you know what that means?

1038
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:04,045
Alcohol was poured into him!

1039
01:20:04,629 --> 01:20:08,549
He drank like that, he
poured alcohol into him.

1040
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:10,967
I've had it with you, goddamn hooligan!

1041
01:20:10,968 --> 01:20:14,138
Fess up! Did Jeon order you?!

1042
01:20:15,848 --> 01:20:18,226
Listen now, Mr. Prosecutor.

1043
01:20:21,354 --> 01:20:27,568
Tables can turn at any
moment in one's life.

1044
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:29,111
Think this carefully.

1045
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:34,033
And I'm a politician.

1046
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:37,203
If a gangster is dead, go
catch a rival gangster,

1047
01:20:37,204 --> 01:20:39,705
I really don't understand
why you're hassling me.

1048
01:20:39,706 --> 01:20:42,875
Even gangsters have
a reason when they kill.

1049
01:20:43,793 --> 01:20:46,086
It's money or a job.

1050
01:20:46,087 --> 01:20:48,340
Then you got an answer!

1051
01:20:48,881 --> 01:20:52,050
They fought over money,
and one side flexed too hard!

1052
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:54,554
That's what gangsters do!

1053
01:20:56,223 --> 01:20:57,390
How dare you...

1054
01:20:59,351 --> 01:21:03,230
If you got nothing else, I'm gonna go.

1055
01:21:04,188 --> 01:21:06,316
I have a lunch appointment.

1056
01:21:24,542 --> 01:21:26,209
<i>How is it going?</i>

1057
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:28,129
Is this also your work, sir?

1058
01:21:29,005 --> 01:21:33,175
If you want to live,
turn the car around.

1059
01:21:33,885 --> 01:21:40,099
Push comes to shove,
I won't go down alone.

1060
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,644
No regrets, you hear?

1061
01:22:08,628 --> 01:22:11,631
We've met before.

1062
01:22:14,426 --> 01:22:17,178
What brings a man like you here?

1063
01:22:19,389 --> 01:22:22,600
You must be tight with
the prosecutors too.

1064
01:22:23,643 --> 01:22:26,896
Very impressive.

1065
01:22:28,398 --> 01:22:30,858
We operate in the shadows though.

1066
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:37,740
Loyalty is good.

1067
01:22:39,283 --> 01:22:40,452
Beautiful, even.

1068
01:22:42,454 --> 01:22:46,207
The important thing is,
for whom you serve.

1069
01:22:47,834 --> 01:22:50,002
Do you know what's moronic?

1070
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,966
Loyalty among morons.

1071
01:23:27,457 --> 01:23:30,917
I brought quality stuff, so I
ordered expensive dishes.

1072
01:23:30,918 --> 01:23:33,170
It must be explosive then.

1073
01:23:34,547 --> 01:23:35,673
Let's hear it.

1074
01:23:50,813 --> 01:23:51,981
<i>A tip?</i>

1075
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:56,230
<i>$160M Bribery Scandal Over
Busan New City Development</i>

1076
01:24:21,428 --> 01:24:26,474
Could you repeat what you
said in an answer form?

1077
01:24:27,224 --> 01:24:30,852
- What is your name? - Park Sang-man.

1078
01:24:30,853 --> 01:24:32,104
Occupation?

1079
01:24:32,605 --> 01:24:36,275
Manager at Haeundae District
Election Commission.

1080
01:24:38,235 --> 01:24:43,157
What happened on the night of April 12?

1081
01:24:47,537 --> 01:24:50,832
<i>And I'm a politician.</i>

1082
01:24:51,541 --> 01:24:54,000
<i>If a gangster is dead, go
catch a rival gangster,</i>

1083
01:24:54,001 --> 01:24:56,963
<i>I really don't understand
why you're hassling me.</i>

1084
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:04,721
I leaked film negatives for ballots,
serial numbers and seals.

1085
01:25:05,805 --> 01:25:06,931
<i>Why?</i>

1086
01:25:07,974 --> 01:25:11,392
<i>Even gangsters have
a reason when they kill.</i>

1087
01:25:11,393 --> 01:25:14,437
<i>It's money or a job.</i>

1088
01:25:14,438 --> 01:25:18,525
<i>They fought over money, and
one side flexed too hard!</i>

1089
01:25:18,526 --> 01:25:21,112
<i>That's what gangsters do!</i>

1090
01:25:23,322 --> 01:25:25,700
- I made a deal.
- A deal?

1091
01:25:26,325 --> 01:25:28,828
He said he'll get my
child a heart surgery.

1092
01:25:30,705 --> 01:25:31,956
Ms. Song...

1093
01:25:32,832 --> 01:25:35,001
<i>My wife is not reachable...</i>

1094
01:25:42,091 --> 01:25:46,596
Do you feel it now? To
whom you must be loyal?

1095
01:25:48,515 --> 01:25:51,601
I heard you've made a mint.

1096
01:25:52,602 --> 01:25:55,605
You need to go big to make big bucks.

1097
01:25:57,607 --> 01:25:59,734
Think very carefully.

1098
01:26:15,249 --> 01:26:18,752
Had he called early, I'd
have prepped something.

1099
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:20,378
I'm so sorry for this.

1100
01:26:20,379 --> 01:26:23,381
Eat slowly, there's plenty more.

1101
01:26:23,382 --> 01:26:25,301
Okay, thank you.

1102
01:26:34,769 --> 01:26:38,396
Ms. Song, you're so pretty.

1103
01:26:38,397 --> 01:26:39,649
Thank you.

1104
01:26:40,524 --> 01:26:42,902
Take good care of him.

1105
01:26:44,195 --> 01:26:49,200
- He's a bit lacking... but he is no harm...
- Head on in.

1106
01:26:50,284 --> 01:26:52,704
This is not bad, but...

1107
01:26:55,331 --> 01:26:57,499
we need a stinger.

1108
01:26:59,376 --> 01:27:01,419
Then let's do our own thing.

1109
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,630
I'll be fine on my own.

1110
01:27:03,631 --> 01:27:04,631
So...

1111
01:27:07,176 --> 01:27:08,344
how about a show?

1112
01:27:11,555 --> 01:27:13,265
Let's have a press conference.

1113
01:27:14,308 --> 01:27:17,812
Gather all the reporters
in town, line the cameras!

1114
01:27:18,771 --> 01:27:20,857
Go big in one fell swoop!

1115
01:27:24,193 --> 01:27:26,696
Let's reset this country.

1116
01:27:32,243 --> 01:27:33,452
Hello?

1117
01:27:35,705 --> 01:27:39,000
What's up at this hour?

1118
01:27:39,917 --> 01:27:43,838
I didn't do much, no
need to give me gifts.

1119
01:27:44,421 --> 01:27:46,215
I found it!

1120
01:27:55,892 --> 01:27:57,977
<i>Motel Romeo - 1992-4-27
Prosecutors Ahn and Kim</i>

1121
01:28:00,062 --> 01:28:01,688
What are you getting at?

1122
01:28:01,689 --> 01:28:03,524
<i>You recognized it immediately?</i>

1123
01:28:06,568 --> 01:28:07,945
<i>Do you see me?</i>

1124
01:28:09,321 --> 01:28:12,908
You'll go after the prosecutors now?

1125
01:28:12,909 --> 01:28:14,535
<i>My father said once,</i>

1126
01:28:15,286 --> 01:28:17,996
to work a cow, put a ring on its nose.

1127
01:28:17,997 --> 01:28:19,790
<i>You think this straight.</i>

1128
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:22,543
If you fool around, how'll
you handle the backlash?

1129
01:28:24,211 --> 01:28:26,463
Does it look like I'm fooling around?!

1130
01:28:30,927 --> 01:28:35,014
If you don't want that
on TV, let Kim Pil-do go.

1131
01:29:12,218 --> 01:29:15,221
<i>Motel Romeo</i>

1132
01:29:16,305 --> 01:29:20,058
Of course you're innocent.

1133
01:29:20,059 --> 01:29:21,893
I greased the officials,

1134
01:29:21,894 --> 01:29:25,230
to be frank, they got nothing.

1135
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:26,607
They were bluffing.

1136
01:29:27,358 --> 01:29:32,696
You just have to hold out.

1137
01:29:33,322 --> 01:29:34,322
Got it?

1138
01:29:35,157 --> 01:29:36,325
Here, here.

1139
01:29:40,121 --> 01:29:41,873
You did good.

1140
01:29:56,512 --> 01:29:58,890
- Hae-woong.
- Yeah?

1141
01:30:02,518 --> 01:30:04,270
Let's stop this.

1142
01:30:05,813 --> 01:30:06,813
Stop what?

1143
01:30:08,107 --> 01:30:12,403
Whatever it is, what you're doing now.

1144
01:30:13,695 --> 01:30:21,695
Bud, we're almost there,
we got the winning hand.

1145
01:30:25,582 --> 01:30:30,254
Pil-do, you stick to muscles.

1146
01:30:32,965 --> 01:30:35,968
I'll do all the thinking, got it?

1147
01:30:41,557 --> 01:30:44,643
On a fishing boat on
the night of April 12th,

1148
01:30:45,686 --> 01:30:48,480
I handed ballot film negatives,

1149
01:30:49,148 --> 01:30:53,986
serial numbers and seals to
Kwon Soon-tae personally.

1150
01:30:55,154 --> 01:30:56,280
One moment.

1151
01:30:58,908 --> 01:31:02,119
We should emphasize
that you were threatened.

1152
01:31:04,246 --> 01:31:06,123
<i>Attempted murder</i>

1153
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:12,171
<i>Illegal election tampering</i>

1154
01:31:13,589 --> 01:31:16,382
<i>Political conspiracy</i>

1155
01:31:16,383 --> 01:31:18,970
<i>Destruction of democracy</i>

1156
01:31:24,808 --> 01:31:27,227
Huh? The door's open.

1157
01:31:27,228 --> 01:31:30,397
Ancestral rite? Good timing.

1158
01:31:31,357 --> 01:31:33,650
Old man, let's bet again.

1159
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:38,447
I got an ace up my sleeve.

1160
01:31:45,121 --> 01:31:46,705
Wait outside.

1161
01:31:55,923 --> 01:31:57,083
Where's the chief prosecutor?

1162
01:31:57,674 --> 01:32:00,676
At his office, where else?

1163
01:32:00,677 --> 01:32:02,513
Probably drafting a warrant.

1164
01:32:03,722 --> 01:32:04,555
<i>Park Sang-man</i>

1165
01:32:04,556 --> 01:32:06,433
To lock you up.

1166
01:32:06,976 --> 01:32:08,394
He's the Jesus.

1167
01:32:11,563 --> 01:32:13,607
He has resurrected from the dead.

1168
01:32:14,108 --> 01:32:18,279
Politics isn't like a gangster
movie, this is way too dramatic.

1169
01:32:19,488 --> 01:32:22,408
So much trouble to kill a pawn like me?

1170
01:32:27,413 --> 01:32:31,542
It wasn't just for you,
so don't feel too bad.

1171
01:32:32,043 --> 01:32:36,255
No elections ever have
the proper results, right?

1172
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,675
So what will you do?

1173
01:32:47,766 --> 01:32:49,185
I feel so bad that

1174
01:32:52,063 --> 01:32:54,480
I might expose everything.

1175
01:32:54,481 --> 01:32:55,524
If you do?

1176
01:32:58,819 --> 01:33:00,862
Will it change anything?

1177
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:04,241
Slush funds for a rigged
election isn't exactly news.

1178
01:33:04,825 --> 01:33:08,369
Ruling and opposition parties,
prosecutors, the president,

1179
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:10,038
they are all in on it.

1180
01:33:10,039 --> 01:33:11,915
Will anyone care?

1181
01:33:13,459 --> 01:33:14,668
Is that so?

1182
01:33:16,337 --> 01:33:19,798
Then why did you leave your
family event to be here?

1183
01:33:25,137 --> 01:33:28,389
I'll give you your 10%.

1184
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:31,517
You seriously underestimate me.

1185
01:33:31,518 --> 01:33:33,980
That was before my ace.

1186
01:33:35,064 --> 01:33:39,150
I'll make absolutely sure
you get elected, wait, wait.

1187
01:33:39,151 --> 01:33:41,861
There's a by-election in October.

1188
01:33:41,862 --> 01:33:44,322
Our deal is one thing,

1189
01:33:44,323 --> 01:33:48,118
isn't a mutual apology in order

1190
01:33:48,119 --> 01:33:50,037
for our past mistakes?

1191
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:57,669
I'm sorry, accept my apology.

1192
01:33:59,338 --> 01:34:01,632
- For what?
- The election.

1193
01:34:02,591 --> 01:34:07,304
Elections come around
in time, am I right?

1194
01:34:08,555 --> 01:34:13,019
But the dead won't.

1195
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:16,772
His wife is unreachable.

1196
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:21,777
If you must apologize,
do it to Mr. Park first.

1197
01:34:24,655 --> 01:34:26,490
Go on, apologize.

1198
01:34:41,297 --> 01:34:43,049
Mr. Park.

1199
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:46,302
I am truly sorry.

1200
01:35:21,878 --> 01:35:23,214
It's me.

1201
01:35:25,216 --> 01:35:27,050
Prep for a delivery.

1202
01:35:42,524 --> 01:35:44,485
Let's get going.

1203
01:36:00,626 --> 01:36:02,711
- Did you have breakfast?
- Yeah.

1204
01:36:23,815 --> 01:36:27,944
- What's going on?
- Press conference for what?

1205
01:36:29,363 --> 01:36:30,947
<i>Emergency Press Conference</i>

1206
01:36:37,204 --> 01:36:39,748
- Let me know.
- I will.

1207
01:36:40,416 --> 01:36:42,376
Hello, hello.

1208
01:37:09,361 --> 01:37:10,987
Is this happening?

1209
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:16,410
Start already!

1210
01:37:30,841 --> 01:37:32,551
It's starting!

1211
01:37:40,517 --> 01:37:42,268
Good morning.

1212
01:37:42,269 --> 01:37:44,980
I'm Director of Planning, Moon Jang-ho.

1213
01:37:52,195 --> 01:37:54,239
- Come out.
- Come!

1214
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,157
What's going on? Please...

1215
01:37:57,075 --> 01:37:58,702
What's going on…

1216
01:37:59,911 --> 01:38:03,748
During the planning phase of
Haeundae new city business,

1217
01:38:03,749 --> 01:38:06,959
I was assaulted and threatened
by violent gangs,

1218
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,171
and had to hand over confidential
copy of the proposal,

1219
01:38:11,172 --> 01:38:15,343
which included proposed
sites, compensation plans,

1220
01:38:15,344 --> 01:38:19,389
and Yellow Dragon Dev's
Jung Han-mo died

1221
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:23,644
after a struggle with a rival gang.

1222
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:28,106
You died once,

1223
01:38:28,774 --> 01:38:30,484
second time will be easier.

1224
01:38:33,236 --> 01:38:34,321
Take care.

1225
01:38:54,049 --> 01:38:56,009
- Let me use the phone.
- Sure.

1226
01:39:21,284 --> 01:39:23,745
Don't kill me, please!

1227
01:39:25,121 --> 01:39:26,581
Please!

1228
01:39:26,582 --> 01:39:27,791
Don't kill me!

1229
01:39:43,849 --> 01:39:45,642
Answer please!

1230
01:40:12,293 --> 01:40:13,753
I'd like to make a reservation.

1231
01:40:13,754 --> 01:40:15,422
Which day?

1232
01:40:17,007 --> 01:40:18,007
Is there a room?

1233
01:40:18,008 --> 01:40:19,385
One moment.

1234
01:40:57,798 --> 01:41:00,426
Any last words? Make it good.

1235
01:41:03,303 --> 01:41:06,389
Pil-do, I told you,

1236
01:41:08,934 --> 01:41:10,436
stick to muscles.

1237
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:21,697
Stupid last words.

1238
01:41:25,909 --> 01:41:27,243
Begin!

1239
01:41:55,313 --> 01:41:56,940
Beautiful weather.

1240
01:41:57,899 --> 01:42:02,529
<i>I will cooperate fully with
prosecutor's investigation,</i>

1241
01:42:03,154 --> 01:42:11,154
<i>and if I am responsible for this,
I will accept any punishment.</i>

1242
01:42:12,581 --> 01:42:16,209
Are you willing to
reveal your assaulter?

1243
01:42:20,964 --> 01:42:21,964
Yes.

1244
01:42:23,466 --> 01:42:25,093
It's Kim Pil-do.

1245
01:42:44,988 --> 01:42:46,657
Mr. Park.

1246
01:42:47,448 --> 01:42:49,200
I am truly sorry.

1247
01:42:51,745 --> 01:42:53,872
Now, your turn.

1248
01:42:56,124 --> 01:42:59,210
Apologize to Jung Han-mo in hell.

1249
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:06,259
Kim Pil-do spilled his guts.

1250
01:43:16,978 --> 01:43:18,772
This is...

1251
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:22,400
called a draw, isn't it?

1252
01:43:37,498 --> 01:43:38,709
Look here.

1253
01:43:55,225 --> 01:43:56,602
This is...

1254
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:02,273
called win-win, am I right?

1255
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:04,901
Win-win?

1256
01:44:11,366 --> 01:44:14,745
My boy, you're all grown up.

1257
01:44:18,539 --> 01:44:24,671
I was going to kill you today...

1258
01:44:29,635 --> 01:44:31,803
I guess it won't be necessary.

1259
01:44:36,016 --> 01:44:39,477
Hae-woong, listen to my words.

1260
01:44:40,729 --> 01:44:45,025
Politics is a deal with the devil.

1261
01:44:46,735 --> 01:44:48,611
To gain power,

1262
01:44:53,283 --> 01:44:58,288
you have to sell your soul.

1263
01:45:10,466 --> 01:45:11,467
Okay.

1264
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:31,863
Dude.

1265
01:45:33,907 --> 01:45:35,867
It's a dirty world.

1266
01:45:39,746 --> 01:45:45,836
Yeah, the world is dirty,
and life's a bitch.

1267
01:45:48,504 --> 01:45:49,547
Take care.

1268
01:47:00,786 --> 01:47:04,539
<i>9 months later</i>

1269
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:40,616
Come, this is the gold badge.

1270
01:47:42,202 --> 01:47:46,497
You're doing me the honor?
I feel so privileged.

1271
01:47:47,833 --> 01:47:51,877
Play politics properly,
only for the people.

1272
01:47:51,878 --> 01:47:54,005
Don't you worry.

1273
01:47:54,755 --> 01:47:56,842
Now you look the part.

1274
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,857
- Hae-woong.
- Yes?

1275
01:48:12,858 --> 01:48:15,443
When you step inside, do not ever bow.

1276
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:19,405
It's the real jungle in there.

1277
01:48:20,156 --> 01:48:21,241
Understood.

1278
01:48:23,076 --> 01:48:24,701
Good evening!

1279
01:48:24,702 --> 01:48:28,373
Thank you for coming a long way!

1280
01:48:29,290 --> 01:48:30,290
Say hello.

1281
01:48:30,791 --> 01:48:34,336
Rep. Jeon, welcome, a tough road here?

1282
01:48:34,337 --> 01:48:35,671
No, not at all.

1283
01:48:36,297 --> 01:48:38,048
- Greet others.
- Of course.

1284
01:48:38,049 --> 01:48:40,175
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1285
01:48:40,176 --> 01:48:42,136
- Good to meet you.
- Likewise, sir.

1286
01:48:42,137 --> 01:48:43,596
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1287
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:46,598
- Rep. Jeon?
- Yes?

1288
01:48:46,599 --> 01:48:47,392
Nice to meet you.

1289
01:48:47,393 --> 01:48:48,267
Over here.

1290
01:48:48,268 --> 01:48:51,436
I'm sorry for making you come so far.

1291
01:48:51,437 --> 01:48:54,274
Any chance to see Seoul is good by me.

1292
01:48:55,066 --> 01:48:55,941
Please sit down.

1293
01:48:55,942 --> 01:48:57,193
- Sit.
- Yes, sir.

1294
01:49:00,863 --> 01:49:03,073
Be at ease, we're all family now.

1295
01:49:03,074 --> 01:49:04,575
Of course.

1296
01:49:05,952 --> 01:49:08,913
By the way, the trouble starts now.

1297
01:49:08,914 --> 01:49:13,542
We've been bluffing all over,
what can we do about it?

1298
01:49:13,543 --> 01:49:16,336
Must we do that too?

1299
01:49:16,337 --> 01:49:19,423
They gotta clean up their own mess.

1300
01:49:19,424 --> 01:49:21,591
You worry too much.

1301
01:49:21,592 --> 01:49:23,969
Who even remembers those words?

1302
01:49:23,970 --> 01:49:28,141
People are too busy to remember
campaign promises.
