I'll knock your block off, you big stiff!
You're a bum!

UMPIRE: Strike! You're out!

WOMAN: (Giggling) Elmer, here it is.

REPORTER: I knew you'd find it.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Boy, I could sure use a drink.

8
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:05,566
I wonder if any big shots
are getting married today?

9
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:10,890
Looks like the same suckers
get married every day.

10
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:12,041
Come on.

11
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,482
Hey, the guy with the cheaters.

12
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:19,444
(Slow instrumental music)

13
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:22,210
Now what's he hiding from?

14
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:31,045
-Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?
-Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic?

15
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:35,806
No, it's not him. But what a scoop it'd be!

16
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:40,323
The guy who wroteThe Bachelor's Bible
getting hooked. It's too good to be true.

17
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:42,767
Let's snap the mayor
in his new fire helmet and go.

18
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:44,808
Let's stick around, see who the guy is.

(Sings) "Two by two they come and go"

20
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,443
Good morning, children.
Your name, please?

ELAINE: Elaine Harper.
CLERK: Speak a little louder.

Elaine Harper.

23
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,005
Thank you. Yours?

Mortimer Brewster.

26
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:05,525
CLERK: Speak up, sonny.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

27
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:13,570
I want to keep this undercover.

28
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,849
Love her? Of course you love her.
You're marrying her, right?

29
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,684
You don't understand. Come here.

30
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:20,808
I don't want this to get out for a while.

31
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:22,610
I'm Mortimer Brewster.

32

You're who?

33
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:25,725
MORTIMER: (Yells) Mortimer Brew--

(The Wedding March plays)

35
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:30,687
That's him!

REPORTER: Mr. Brewster!

37
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,245
Now, look--

38
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,365
MORTIMER: Goodbye, dear.

39
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:51,600
MORTIMER: Don't you understand?
How can I marry you?

40
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:54,843
Me, the symbol of bachelorhood.
I've sneered at every love scene.

41
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:57,162
I've written four million words
against marriage!

42
00:03:57,252 --> 00:04:01,291
Not only hooked, but to a minister's
daughter, and a girl from Brooklyn.

43
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:04,648
Look at the way you look!
What is that contraption you've got there?

44
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:08,647
A pin I borrowed from your aunts.
You know, "Something borrowed--"

45
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:11,565
I know, "Something borrowed,
something blue." Old, new.

46
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,086
Rice and old shoes.
Carry you over the threshold.

47
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,164
Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe.
Is this what I've come to?

48
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:19,971
I can't go through with it.
I won't marry you. That's that.

49
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,885
-Yes, Mortimer.
-What do you mean, "Yes, Mortimer"?

50
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:25,367
Aren't you insulted?
Aren't you going to cry?

51
00:04:25,452 --> 00:04:28,330
-No, Mortimer.
-And don't "No, Mortimer" me, either!

52
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,283
Marriage is a superstition.

53
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:32,369
It's old-fashioned. It's....

54
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:47,084
(The Wedding March continues)

55
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:18,440
O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't realize...

56
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:21,444
...l'm turning over to you
the nicest, best beat in Brooklyn.

57
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:24,330
Now look at that old church.
And them old houses.

58
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:27,008
Did George Washington ever sleep here?

59
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:30,721
Of course he did. This whole neighborhood
just stinks with atmosphere.

60
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:34,244
-And look at that old house.
-The original owners still there?

BROPHY: Don't crack wise
about the Brewster sisters.

62
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:40,766
They're two of the dearest, sweetest
old ladies that ever walked the earth.

63
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:42,604
They're out of this world.

64
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:46,563
They're like pressed rose leaves.

65
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:48,126
Pressed rose leaves?

66
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,728
PAT: The old girls must be kind of hard up.

67
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:54,448
Their old man left them fixed for life.

68
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:56,602
Don't you call them "the girls," either.

69
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,284
Brophy. Is Lieutenant around?

70
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:00,169
So what are they renting rooms for?

71
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:03,369
They don't. But you can bet
if anybody came looking for a room...

72
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:06,649
...they wouldn't go away
without a good meal and a couple of bucks.

73
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,770
BROPHY: That's their way
of digging up people to do good to.

(Harpsichord music plays)

75
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:21,129
Reverend Harper, I do hope
you don't disapprove of Mortimer...

76
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:25,444
...because he's a dramatic critic
and takes your daughter to the theater.

77
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:28,292
It's not that I disapprove
of his being a critic...

78
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:31,728
...but no man with this published attitude...

79
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:36,724
...should take any man's daughter
anyplace, at any time.

80
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:37,921
(Loud sneeze)

81
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,970
I must be catching cold.

82
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,044
ABBY: No, dear. It was Reverend Harper
who sneezed. Bless you.

83
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,642
ABBY: We mustn't be angry with Mortimer.

84
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:51,725
He's so very much in love with her.
Sister Martha and I are so happy.

85
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,049
He used to come to see us
only occasionally, and now...

86
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:57,442
...he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.

87
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,968
BROPHY: Remember now,
watch your language.

88
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:03,008
PAT: You know I'm not a swearing man.

89
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:05,845
BROPHY: You'd be surprised
what they'd consider swearing.

90
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,690
(Doorbell rings)

91
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:11,841
Will you excuse me?
No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.

92
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:18,167
-Come right in, Mr. Brophy.
-Miss Abby, we came for the toys.

93
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,886
This is Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my beat.

94
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:23,930
PAT: How do you do, miss?
ABBY: Welcome to our neighborhood.

95
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:26,162
Gentlemen, what news
have you brought me?

96
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:28,568
Colonel, we have nothing to report.

97
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:33,282
No, absolutely nothing to report.

98
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:35,366
Splendid!

99
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,688
Thank you, gentlemen. At ease.

100
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:42,084
You know the Reverend Dr. Harper
from the church next door?

101
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:45,482
Hello. This is Officer O'Hara,
the new man on the beat.

102
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:48,086
PAT: How do you do, sir?
It's nice to meet you.

103
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:55,000
The toys are on the chair up here,
by the library door.

104
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:02,808
Teddy, run upstairs and bring down your
Army and Navy from Aunt Martha's room.

105
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:04,291
They're all packed.

106
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:08,127
REV. HARPER: That's splendid work
you men do...

107
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:10,567
...fixing up discarded toys
for the kids at camp.

108
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:11,607
(Shouts) Charge!

109
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:16,402
(Door slams, clock chimes)

110
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:20,483
(lndulgent laughter)

111
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:24,247
It gives us something to do at the station.
You get tired of playing cards.

112
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,125
BROPHY: So these are the toys?
ABBY: How's Mrs. Brophy?

113
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,931
She's better, thank you.
But a little weak, still.

114
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:39,651
I'll get some beef broth
for you to take to her.

115
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:42,451
Please don't bother.
You've done so much already.

116
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,961
ABBY: Stop the nonsense!
I won't be a minute.

117
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:47,643
(Cheery instrumental music)

118
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:54,563
Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness
and absolute generosity are...

119
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:57,531
...it's because I've known
the Brewster sisters.

120
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:59,603
(Bugle blows)

121
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:04,845
BROPHY: Teddy, you promised me
you wouldn't do that anymore.

122
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:07,730
But I have to call a Cabinet meeting
to get those supplies.

123
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:10,446
BROPHY: Now don't do that again.
Do you hear me?

124
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,523
(Door slams, clock chimes)

125
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,083
BROPHY: He used to do that at night...

126
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:18,811
...and the neighbors raised Cain.
They're afraid of him.

127
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,282
Look, Sarge, I promised I wouldn't swear,
but what the heck--

128
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:24,206
What's going on here?

129
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,886
-He's quite harmless.
-He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt.

130
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:29,770
There's a lot of worse guys
he could think he was.

131
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:33,286
That's right.

132
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:35,767
I'll make a note.
He's an interesting character.

133
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:37,570
Isn't it a shame, Father....

134
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:42,091
Isn't it a shame, Reverend, that this nice
family should be hatching a cuckoo?

135
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,488
Well, now, isn't this nice!

136
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:48,484
BROPHY: Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.
MARTHA: How do you do?

137
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:51,245
-Good afternoon.
-Reverend, how do you do?

138
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:54,011
Miss Martha, Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my duties.

139
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,207
How do you do?

140
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,931
MARTHA: I'm very glad to know you.
PAT: Thank you.

141
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:00,125
ABBY: Martha, you're back.

142
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:03,249
ABBY: Here's the broth.
Be sure it's good and hot.

143
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:05,641
BROPHY: You bet I will,
and thank you very much.

144
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,848
The Army and Navy are ready for action.

145
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:11,089
BROPHY: Colonel, this is grand.
It'll make a lot of kids happy.

146
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:13,083
What's this? The Oregon?

147
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:15,163
Teddy, dear, put it back.

148
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:18,245
TEDDY: But the Oregon goes to Australia.
ABBY: Now, Teddy....

149
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:19,811
No, it goes to Australia.

150
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:22,964
BROPHY: These are lovely. Thank you.
ABBY: Not at all.

151
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:28,244
BROPHY: The children will go crazy.
MARTHA: Don't mention it.

152
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:29,845
So long, Colonel.

153
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,246
Hey, Sarge.

154
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,886
Yes.

155
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:36,721
Dismissed!

156
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:40,325
BROPHY: Goodbye and thank you.
ABBY: Don't mention it.

157
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:43,404
ABBY: Careful of the step with the toys.
BROPHY: Good night.

158
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:49,681
Young man, let that be a lesson to you.

159
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:55,251
Goodbye.

160
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,290
REV. HARPER: Well, I must be going.
TEDDY: (Shouts) Charge!

161
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:04,410
Charge the blockhouse!

162
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:08,331
(Clock chimes)

163
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:12,161
Blockhouse?

164
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,407
The stairs are always San Juan Hill.

165
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:17,521
Bless you!

166
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:20,041
Have you tried to persuade him
he wasn't Roosevelt?

167
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:23,329
-Oh, no!
-He's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt.

168
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,808
ABBY: Do you remember, Martha?

169
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:29,402
Once, a long time ago,
we thought if he'd be George Washington...

170
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:32,211
...it might be a change for him,
and we suggested it.

171
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,323
And do you know what happened?

172
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:37,802
He just stayed under his bed for days
and wouldn't be anybody.

173
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:42,162
Well, if he's happy, and what's
more important, you're happy....

174
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,852
MARTHA: Our only worry for Teddy
is after we're gone.

175
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,486
REV. HARPER: Yes, indeed.
That is quite a problem.

176
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:50,040
Mortimer's made all the arrangements
for Teddy...

177
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:52,965
...to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium
after we pass on.

178
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,441
Splendid idea! A very pleasant place.

179
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:59,720
(Cheery instrumental music)

180
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:01,803
Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.

181
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:07,762
You know, Martha,
I do believe he's beginning to see the light.

182
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,683
I'm sure we needn't worry about him.

183
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:12,969
He won't interfere with our plans
for Mortimer and Elaine.

184
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,684
Did you just have tea?

185
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:16,728
Yes.

186
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:20,211
And dinner's going to be late, too.

187
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,171
So, why?

188
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,771
(Door slams)

189
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:28,284
ABBY: Good news for you.

190
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,921
You're going to Panama
and dig another lock for the canal.

191
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,124
Delighted!

192
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:36,283
That's bully! Just bully!

193
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:38,921
I shall prepare at once for the journey.

194
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,610
TEDDY: Charge!

195
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:45,926
(Door slams)

196
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:47,969
(Cheery instrumental music)

197
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:50,088
Abby! While I was out?

198
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:52,606
Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you.

199
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,923
I didn't know when you'd be back,
and Reverend Harper was coming.

200
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:59,049
-But all by yourself.
-I got along fine.

201
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,772
-I'll run right downstairs and see.
-No, dear.

202
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,969
There wasn't time. And I was all alone.

203
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:08,962
Well?

204
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:14,206
Just look in the windowseat.

205
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,921
(Light instrumental music)

206
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:25,848
(Knock on window)

207
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:28,241
MARTHA: It's Elaine!
ELAINE: Hello, darlings.

208
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,043
-But, Elaine!
-What did she mean?

209
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:35,402
You don't suppose they've gone and--

210
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:37,286
Elaine!

211
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,801
(The Wedding March plays)

212
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:41,047
Listen, buddy.

213
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:44,602
-This old cab has seen osculation but....
-You ain't seen anything yet.

214
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,286
-You've got to drive us to the station.
-Take her hat.

215
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:49,962
CAB DRIVER: Wait a minute.
And her brooch.

216
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:52,845
If you find her hairpins, keep them.
Hold on to that.

217
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:58,120
There they are.

218
00:13:58,692 --> 00:13:59,966
Here's your hat.

219
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:03,280
Just throw it.
I don't like that look in your eyes.

220
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:07,206
-What's the matter with it?
-Father preached about it only last Sunday.

221
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:09,324
He did? What did he say?

222
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:12,091
-He was against it.
-But that was only Sunday.

223
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:15,367
(Light, playful instrumental music)

224
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,563
Please! For heaven's sake!

225
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,326
But, Mortimer, right out here
with everyone looking?

226
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,880
Yes, right out here with everyone looking.

227
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:25,042
Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.

228
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:28,083
(Abby and Martha giggle)

229
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,531
(Mortimer grunts)

230
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:37,884
But, Mortimer, you're going to love me
for my mind, too?

231
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,570
One thing at a time.

232
00:14:39,652 --> 00:14:41,290
ELAINE: There's that look again!

233
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:46,449
"There's that look again, Mortimer! "
You better get used to it.

234
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:49,251
You'll see it often. It goes just before this.

235
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:53,168
You know what we're doing?
Wasting time.

236
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:55,288
I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your....

237
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:58,728
No, don't tell your father.
You'll run his cold into a pneumonia.

238
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,888
I can handle Father. He's a dear.

239
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:03,770
Look, why don't we wire him
from Niagara Falls?

240
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:05,571
Niagara Falls?

241
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,128
That's why you stopped at your office.

242
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:10,601
Yes, certainly!
We're going to go the whole hog.

243
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:13,126
Niagara Falls!
Everybody ought to go there.

244
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,721
You should've seen my secretary's face.

245
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:18,690
We've a room on the train,
the bridal suite in the hotel...

246
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:21,525
...and tomorrow morning
we go over the falls in a barrel.

247
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:24,410
Go on, darling, hurry and pack.

248
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:27,245
I don't have to.
I started packing the day after I met you.

249
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:29,129
MORTIMER: There, you see! You see?

250
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:32,130
That's what I mean.
That's what I hate about women.

251
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:35,247
(Slow instrumental music)

252
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,568
I wonder what Mary's doing now?

253
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:44,964
-The train leaves in an hour, hurry.
-It'll be a few minutes.

254
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:47,964
-Father may want to pray over me.
-Whistle when you're ready.

255
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:49,041
Elaine?

256
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:51,043
When you whistle, open the front door fast.

257
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:54,488
If you see a tall, dark streak of light,
it's me.

258
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:59,324
(Elaine whistles)

259
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,127
What? Now?

260
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:02,361
No, not now!

261
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:05,523
Look surprised when he tells us.

262
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:09,491
Hold on to your bustles.

263
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:11,767
We're married. Elaine and I are married.

264
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,729
ABBY: Oh, darling, how wonderful!

265
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,882
Isn't it wonderful? They're married!

266
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:19,442
Don't pretend to be so surprised either,
you two old frauds.

267
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:22,611
MORTIMER: Can I use the telephone?
ABBY: Of course.

268
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:24,808
Isn't it too, too wonderful?

269
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:27,884
And to think that it happened
right here in this room!

270
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,280
Now, here.

271
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,642
Benson's Florists?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

272
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:35,405
Did you send those roses
to Mrs. Brewster? Good.

273
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:38,802
Send four dozen more to drawing room A,
Grand Central Station.

274
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:41,690
Hurry. And throw in a flock
of orange blossoms.

275
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:44,246
But before you go,
we can have our celebration.

276
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:46,482
I'll open a bottle of wine and we'll sing.

277
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,324
And we'll invite a few neighbors in.

278
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:51,961
-And, of course, a wedding cake.
-You won't have time to bake a cake.

279
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:54,287
We're going to Niagara Falls.
A taxi's waiting.

280
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,681
It's all ready. It's been ready since--

281
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:59,240
I bet it's been ready
since the first day I met her.

282
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:01,892
Did everybody know
I was getting married, except me?

283
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:04,486
We knew you'd find out about it in time.

284
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:08,482
I've got the two nicest aunts in the world.

285
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:11,245
Of course, you've got
the nicest nephew in the world, too.

286
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:14,252
MARTHA: Well, I'll run along
and get everything ready.

287
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:17,770
Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend
isn't too angry.

288
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,570
You know how your books upset him.

289
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:23,440
I'm going to burn all my books.
I'll let the Reverend light the first match.

290
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,042
Did I leave some notes here
for my new book?

291
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,088
You mean Mind Over Matrimony?

292
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:29,721
Where are they?

293
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:32,167
-I hid them someplace--
-Come along.

294
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,207
Now you behave.

295
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,681
Let's find them before Elaine sees them.

296
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:42,128
Hello, Mortimer!

297
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:46,562
-How are you, Mr. President?
-Bully, thank you. Just bully.

298
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:50,082
-What news have you brought me?
-The country's squarely behind you.

299
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,208
Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful?

300
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:55,290
Well, goodbye. I'm off to Panama.

301
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,363
MORTIMER: Goodbye, Mr. President.

302
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,608
A new lock for the canal, you know.

303
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,367
TEDDY: (Sings)
"Oh, tell the news to Mother"

304
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:06,252
-Oh, dear.
-Find those notes? What's wrong?

305
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:09,091
There's a baby picture
of your brother Jonathan.

306
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:13,881
MORTIMER: You ought to put that in
the fire with my books. My, what a face!

307
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,487
I remember now.
He'd scare grownups with it.

308
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:18,847
Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me.

309
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,402
Do you remember how he used to cut
worms in two with his teeth?

310
00:18:23,772 --> 00:18:27,082
Jonathan? He's probably in prison
or hanged or something by now.

311
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,808
MORTIMER: I saw a play, had a character
in it, reminded me of Jonathan.

312
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:31,847
Really?

313
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:36,331
MORTIMER: A honey of a lunatic. One of
those whodunits called Murder Will Out.

314
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:37,447
ABBY: Oh, dear!

315
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:38,965
Yeah, what a play.

316
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:44,121
When the curtain goes up,
the first thing you see is a dead body.

317
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:45,811
The next thing--

318
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,241
Hey, mister.

319
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:06,131
(Elaine whistles)

320
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,285
(Mortimer tries to whistle, unsuccessfully)

321
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:19,131
(Abby hums cheerfully)

322
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:32,241
MARTHA: Happy bridegroom!
ABBY: Congratulations, darling!

323
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:36,008
Never mind that now.

324
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,850
Now, listen, darlings.

325
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:40,251
Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha....

326
00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:43,529
You know how we've always planned
to send Teddy to Happy Dale?

327
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:46,001
Yes, dear. That's after we're gone.

328
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:48,925
Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper
about it.

329
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:52,767
Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now.
At once!

330
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:56,731
-He's in the cellar. Get him up here now.
-There's no such hurry as that.

331
00:19:57,012 --> 00:20:00,766
When Teddy's working on the canal,
you can't get his mind on anything else.

332
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,005
Well, look, darlings.

333
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:06,164
I'm frightfully sorry,
but I've got an awful shock for you.

334
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:08,608
Teddy's killed a man, darlings!

335
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,601
Nonsense!

336
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,643
There's a body in the windowseat!

337
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:14,962
Yes, dear. We know.

338
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,162
-You know?
-Of course.

339
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,806
Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.

340
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:26,485
Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it.

341
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:28,722
Forget you ever saw the gentleman.

342
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:30,322
Forget?

343
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,687
We never dreamed you'd peek.

344
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:34,606
What the....

345
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,761
Who is he?

346
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,884
He's a Mr. Hoskins. Adam Hoskins.

347
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:44,082
That's really all I know about him,
except that he's a Methodist.

348
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:46,447
He's a Methodist? lsn't that nice.

349
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,807
That's all you know?
What's he doing here?

350
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,883
-What happened to him?
-He died.

351
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:54,489
Aunt Martha, men just don't get
into windowseats and die.

352
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,365
No, dear. He died first.

353
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,290
Wait! Stop all this.

354
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:02,330
Now look, how did he die?

355
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:05,012
Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive.

356
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:10,202
The gentleman died because he drank
some wine with poison in it.

357
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:14,368
How did the poison get in the wine?

358
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,886
We put it in wine
because it's less noticeable.

359
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:19,406
When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.

360
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,766
You mean you....

361
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:24,211
You put it in the wine?

362
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:27,648
Yes. And I put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat...

363
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:30,007
...because Reverend Harper was coming.

364
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,530
Look at me, darling.

365
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:40,047
You knew what you'd done and didn't want
Reverend Harper to see the body?

366
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,204
Well, not at tea.
That wouldn't have been very nice.

367
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:47,291
It's first-degree.

368
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,921
Now, Mortimer, you know all about it
and just forget about it.

369
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:55,171
I do think that Martha and I have the right
to our own little secrets.

370
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:02,247
Abby, while I was out I dropped in
on Mrs. Schultz. She's much better.

371
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:04,687
But she wants us to take Junior
to the movies again.

372
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:06,888
We must do that, tomorrow or next day.

373
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,930
Yes, but this time we'll go
where we want to go.

374
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:14,211
Junior's not going to drag me
into another one of those scary pictures.

375
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:18,731
ABBY: They ought not to be allowed
to make pictures just to frighten people.

376
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:23,244
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

377
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:39,007
Operator?

378
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:41,243
Can you hear my voice?

379
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:43,201
You can?

380
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:44,846
Are you sure?

381
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:47,246
Then I must be here.

382
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:50,011
(Elaine whistles)

383
00:23:04,052 --> 00:23:06,043
(Children squeal)

384
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:17,090
ABBY: The dears. Isn't Halloween
a wonderful time for them?

385
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,766
Yes, it is. They have so much fun.

386
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:21,166
(Abby hums cheerfully)

387
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,527
Now, Mortimer, don't be so impatient.

388
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,007
-We'll let you lick the bowl.
-Lick the bowl?

389
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,560
I don't want to.
I want to know what we're going to do!

390
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:30,290
We're going to celebrate.

391
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:33,131
Celebrate? There's a body
in the windowseat!

392
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,009
ABBY: Yes, dear. Mr. Hoskins.

393
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:38,369
I know what his name is. I want to know
what we're going to do.

394
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:40,090
We can't turn you over to the police.

395
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:41,844
MARTHA: Stop worrying about it.

396
00:23:41,932 --> 00:23:43,843
We told you to forget the whole thing.

397
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:47,766
Forget? Can't I make you realize
that something has to be done?

398
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,883
Now, Mortimer, you behave.

399
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:53,004
You're too old
to be flying off the handle like this.

400
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:56,047
-But Mr. Hodgekiss--
-Hoskins, dear.

401
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:58,600
Whatever his name is,
you can't leave him in there.

402
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:00,205
We don't intend to, dear.

403
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:03,329
Teddy's down in the cellar now,
digging the lock.

404
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:11,367
You're going to bury
Mr. Hodgekiss in the cellar?

405
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:14,046
Yes, dear.
That's what we did with the others.

406
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:17,242
Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't....

407
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:20,685
MORTIMER: Others?
ABBY: The other gentlemen.

408
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:24,846
When you say "others,"
do you mean "others"?

409
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:27,766
-More than one "others"?
-Yes, dear.

410
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:30,884
Let me see now. This is 1 1, isn't it, Abby?

411
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:33,162
No, dear. This makes 12.

412
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:37,121
Abby, dear, I think you're wrong.
This one is only 1 1 .

413
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:40,802
No, dear, because I remember
when Mr. Hoskins first came in...

414
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:43,929
...it occurred to me
that he'd make just an even dozen.

415
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:49,651
MARTHA: But, Abby, dear, I really don't
think you should count the first one.

416
00:24:49,852 --> 00:24:52,889
ABBY: I was counting the first one,
and that makes it 12.

417
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,281
It does?

418
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:58,884
Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is.

419
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:00,963
I get them mixed up sometimes.

420
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:02,521
Makes it 12.

421
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,851
(Phone rings)

422
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:10,521
Hello.

423
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:16,451
Whatever is the matter
with Mortimer today?

424
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:18,409
Why, Abby,
what do you think happened to him?

425
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:20,248
Hello?

426
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:22,840
(Whistling over the phone)

427
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:29,245
Not now. For heaven's sake,
keep your shirt on!

428
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:33,130
Elaine, I didn't mean--

429
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:38,563
Now, let's see. Where were we?

430
00:25:38,652 --> 00:25:39,971
Twelve. Twelve!

431
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:41,606
MARTHA: Yes, dear.

432
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:44,126
Abby thinks we should count the first one.

433
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,487
Never mind about that. Just sit down.

434
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:48,528
Tell me, who was the first one?

435
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:51,286
Mr. Midgely. He was a Baptist.

436
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:53,602
MARTHA: He was such a lonely,
old gentleman.

437
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,242
ABBY: All his kith and kin were dead.

438
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:58,288
We felt so sorry for him.

439
00:25:58,532 --> 00:26:01,444
And then, when his heart attack came...

440
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:04,808
...and he sat there dead in that chair...

441
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:08,682
...looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha?

442
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:12,001
We made up our minds, then and there...

443
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:15,050
...that if we could help
other lonely, old men...

444
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:17,322
...to find that same peace...

445
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:18,721
...we would.

446
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,040
Why, you poor....

447
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:23,891
You mean, he dropped dead
right in this chair?

448
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:30,043
And then, you see,
Teddy came up from digging in Panama...

449
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,369
...and he thought Mr. Midgely
was a yellow-fever victim.

450
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:36,570
And that meant
he had to be buried immediately.

451
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:39,884
So, we all took him down to Panama...

452
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:43,891
...and put him in the lock
and gave him a decent Christian burial.

453
00:26:44,212 --> 00:26:48,524
MARTHA: There, now you see? That's why
we told you not to bother about it...

454
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,365
...because we know exactly
what's to be done.

455
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,606
Wait a minute!

456
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:58,286
Come here, darling.
What about the others?

457
00:26:58,732 --> 00:27:01,121
All 12 of them didn't walk in here
and drop dead.

458
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:03,130
No, dear. Of course not!

459
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:04,361
Well, so....

460
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:13,451
-(Whispers) Mortimer.
-What?

461
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,330
Do you remember those jars of poison
on the shelves...

462
00:27:16,412 --> 00:27:18,687
...in Grandfather's laboratory
all these years?

463
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:21,570
You know your Aunt Martha's knack
for mixing things.

464
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:23,961
You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.

465
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:27,569
Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine...

466
00:27:27,652 --> 00:27:30,246
...l take one teaspoonful of arsenic...

467
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:32,641
...then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine.

468
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:36,361
And then, just a pinch of cyanide.

469
00:27:38,372 --> 00:27:40,044
Should have quite a kick.

470
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:41,646
Yes.

471
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:45,129
As a matter of fact,
one of our gentlemen found time to say:

472
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:46,406
"How delicious! "

473
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:48,801
He did? Well, wasn't that nice of him?

474
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:51,890
Abby, we mustn't be standing here
gossiping all night.

475
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:53,485
We must get that cake frosted.

476
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,450
Don't worry about the cake.
I couldn't eat a thing.

477
00:27:56,732 --> 00:28:00,520
You newlyweds! A sip of wine
will give you an appetite.

478
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,445
That'd be nice, darling, a sip of....
A sip of wine!

479
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:04,801
Wine!

480
00:28:19,332 --> 00:28:21,527
(Cat meows)

481
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,972
I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.

482
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:32,611
He's wonderful. Happy as a lark.
Singing away, digging locks.

483
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:35,126
Got him working on a yellow-fever victim.

484
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:37,364
I can see the headlines now:

485
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:40,762
"Murder lncorporator Rides Again"
right across the front page.

486
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:42,720
Let me see....

487
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:46,091
Teddy! Of course.
Everybody knows he's crazy.

488
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:49,883
Let me see. Who can I call up?
Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell?

489
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:51,610
No, Winchell's no good.

490
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:53,646
Old Judge Cullman!

491
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,609
I wonder if I got his number.

492
00:28:56,492 --> 00:28:58,369
What am I doing with tickets?

493
00:28:58,572 --> 00:28:59,721
Information.

494
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,407
Information?

495
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:09,962
Get me the number of Judge Cullman
on North Shore Road, Brooklyn.

496
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:11,326
Yeah, would you call me back?

497
00:29:14,932 --> 00:29:17,002
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if he wasn't there?

498
00:29:18,532 --> 00:29:19,408
ELAINE: Hey, you!

499
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,130
(Mortimer yelps)

500
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,726
Thought you were tall, dark streak of light.

501
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,525
What are you doing here?

502
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:28,325
What am I doing here?
Didn't you hear me whistle?

503
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:29,811
Whistle? Oh, yes.

504
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:31,611
I heard you whistle.

505
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:33,884
-How do I look?
-You look fine.

506
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,361
-Run on home. I'll call you up tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

507
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:39,250
You know I always call you up
every day or two.

508
00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:42,768
You and your gags! Where's your hat?
The bags are in the taxi.

509
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:45,452
-Come on!
-I'm so sorry. Something's happened.

510
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:47,410
What'd you do, lose your nerve?

511
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:49,960
Where's that look
I was going to see so often?

512
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:52,043
(Elaine whistles The Wedding March)

513
00:29:52,132 --> 00:29:54,441
Stop! Don't whistle in my ear, please.

514
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:56,604
What's wrong? Look at your hair.

515
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:58,762
What color is it? Has it turned?

516
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,124
Darling, what's the matter?
What happened?

517
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:05,404
Those flowers are so beautiful.

518
00:30:05,492 --> 00:30:08,290
If I could only tell you, Elaine.
You smell so nice.

519
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:09,441
(Phone rings)

520
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:10,760
You better go home!

521
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:14,128
-But, darling, we were married today.
-Go to bed, get some rest!

522
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,088
Rest?

523
00:30:17,252 --> 00:30:19,049
Who? Judge Cullman?

524
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:23,885
This is Mortimer Brewster. I'll tell you
why I called you. It's about Teddy.

525
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,008
I've got to come over
and see you right away.

526
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,969
It won't wait until tomorrow, Judge.

527
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:31,203
It's very, very important.
We've got to do something immediately.

528
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,248
But it's a matter of life and.... Elaine!

529
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:36,161
Will you get out of here?

530
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:39,005
What on earth is going on here?
I don't know where I stand!

531
00:30:39,092 --> 00:30:41,765
-Anywhere, but don't stand there!
-But Niagara Falls!

532
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:44,452
-If it does, we'll let it!
-Wait a minute! Listen.

533
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:46,602
You can't marry me
and then throw me out!

534
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:50,162
I'm not throwing you out of the house!
Will you get out of here?

535
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:56,369
I'm sorry, Judge. A thing happened.

536
00:30:56,652 --> 00:30:58,404
Judge, about Teddy, he's--

537
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,691
It's his bugle blowing.

538
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:04,730
The police want to throw him
into a state institution.

539
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:07,605
How do you like that?

540
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:10,650
-I read an ad here about a room to rent.
-Shut up!

541
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:21,121
If you sign the papers and Teddy commits
himself, we can get him to Happy Dale.

542
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,884
It's a wonderful place.

543
00:31:22,972 --> 00:31:23,961
You will?

544
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,686
Fine! I'll be over
as soon as I've made another call.

545
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:28,251
(Doorbell rings)

546
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:30,450
Doorbell's ringing, dear.

547
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:36,684
ABBY: How do you do? Come in.

548
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:39,247
MR. GIBBS: I understand you've got
a room to rent.

549
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,924
ABBY: Do step in.

550
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:44,363
-Are you the lady of the house?
-Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.

551
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:46,886
MORTIMER: Operator?
Give me long distance, please.

552
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,645
And this is my sister.
Another Miss Brewster.

553
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:52,963
MR. GIBBS: My name's Gibbs.
ABBY: Well, do sit down.

554
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:56,090
I'm sorry,
we're just setting the table for dinner.

555
00:31:56,772 --> 00:32:00,481
Now, this would be
a nice comfortable chair.

556
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:05,000
Long distance? I want the Happy Dale
Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.

557
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:08,926
ABBY: ls Brooklyn your home?
MR. GIBBS: I live in a hotel. Don't like it.

558
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:12,647
Are your family Brooklyn people?

559
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:16,008
-Haven't got any family.
-All alone in the world?

560
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:17,161
Yeah.

561
00:32:17,372 --> 00:32:20,170
ABBY: Well, Martha....
MORTIMER: No, Happy Dale.

562
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,370
ABBY: Well, you've come
to just the right house.

563
00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:25,170
ABBY: Do sit down.
MORTIMER: Dale.

564
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:28,006
MORTIMER: "D" Iike in "dig,"
when you dig a lock.

565
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:30,652
That's right.
"A " Iike in "arsenic. " Got that?

566
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:33,123
Is there always this much noise?

567
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:34,930
He doesn't live with us.

568
00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:37,242
I can see the headlines now. Please.

569
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:41,490
I'd like to see the room.
I don't think I'll like it.

570
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:43,005
The room's upstairs.

571
00:32:43,092 --> 00:32:46,323
Won't you try a glass of our wine
before we start up?

572
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:47,811
Never touch it.

573
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:52,130
Well, we make this ourselves.
It's elderberry wine.

574
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:54,687
Elderberry?

575
00:32:57,252 --> 00:33:00,005
I haven't tasted elderberry wine
since I was a boy.

576
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,208
MR. GIBBS: Thank you.
MORTIMER: Operator!

577
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:05,682
I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry!
I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium!

578
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:08,445
Sanitarium! Sanitarium!
Yes, like a broken record!

579
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:13,168
-Have your own elderberry bushes?
-No, but the cemetery's full of them.

580
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:15,410
Well, skoal.

581
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:18,251
MORTIMER: Hello, operator!
What's taking so long?

582
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,800
It's only across the river!
I could swim it faster!

583
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:21,722
Yes!

584
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:23,806
Hello! Hell--

585
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:25,202
What--

586
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,725
What, they're busy?

587
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:27,927
Busy?

588
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:30,090
They're busy and you're dizzy!

589
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:33,209
No, I'm not drunk, madam,
but you've given me an idea!

590
00:33:33,332 --> 00:33:35,323
(Banging)

591
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:39,731
Mortimer, no...no.

592
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:42,362
Darling, I'm nervous. Don't do that.

593
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:44,486
Not that.

594
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:48,531
MORTIMER: (Shrieks) No!

595
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:57,208
Get out of here! Do you want
to be poisoned, murdered, killed?

596
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:02,840
They're nuts!

597
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:05,050
CAB DRIVER: You're telling me!

598
00:34:12,612 --> 00:34:15,445
Look, you can't do things like that!

599
00:34:22,212 --> 00:34:25,010
Now I don't know
how I can explain this to you...

600
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:30,321
...but it's not only against the law,
it's wrong.

601
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,204
ABBY: Oh, piffle!

602
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:34,409
It's not a nice thing to do.

603
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:38,403
People wouldn't understand.
He wouldn't understand.

604
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:42,564
What I mean is....

605
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:46,810
This is developing into a very bad habit!

606
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,605
(Phone rings)

607
00:34:54,612 --> 00:34:56,523
Who? Happy Dale Sanitarium?

608
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:58,444
That's amazing, operator.

609
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,486
Happy Dale?
Let me talk to Mr. Witherspoon, please.

610
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:03,210
Mr. Witherspoon speaking.

611
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:06,201
How do you do, Mr. Brewster?
How are you?

612
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:10,883
Mr. Witherspoon, do you--
I'm fine, thanks. How are you?

613
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:15,361
Do you remember our conversation about
committing my brother to Happy Dale?

614
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:18,205
You do? Well, we want
to commit him there immediately.

615
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:19,322
Oh, dear.

616
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:21,170
Oh, dear. That's too bad.

617
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:25,089
Well, I'd hoped we wouldn't have him
for some time yet.

618
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:28,284
We have several Theodore Roosevelts
at the moment...

619
00:35:28,412 --> 00:35:30,448
...and it would lead to trouble.

620
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:33,843
Well, now, if he thought that--

621
00:35:33,972 --> 00:35:37,521
Mr. Brewster, we're a bit short
of Napoleons at present.

622
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,723
Bonaparte. And if--

623
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:43,530
Oh, I see. Of course.

624
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,531
Well, if your mind is made up. Yes.

625
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:48,725
Have you had the papers drawn up?

626
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:51,610
No, but I'll do it now
and call you as soon as I have them.

627
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:53,611
Thank you, Mr.-- What?

628
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:56,088
All right. Thank you, Mr. Witherspoon.

629
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:59,362
Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear.

630
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:04,328
Now listen, I'm going to Judge Cullman's,
but I want you to promise me something.

631
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,880
MARTHA: Well, we'd have to know
what it was first.

632
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,123
I love you both very much.

633
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,527
You know I'd do anything for you,
don't you?

634
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:12,681
ABBY: Yes, dear.

635
00:36:12,892 --> 00:36:15,360
I want you to do one thing for me,
like good girls.

636
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:17,044
ABBY: What do you want us to do?

637
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:19,965
Don't do anything.
I mean, don't do anything!

638
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:23,404
Don't let anyone in the house
and leave Mr. Whosit where he is.

639
00:36:23,492 --> 00:36:27,007
Get off that thing. I can't talk to you....
I can't concentrate.

640
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:30,010
I wouldn't want anything
in the world to happen to you.

641
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:32,447
What on earth could happen to us?

642
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:33,806
Well, darling....

643
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:36,571
Anyway, you'll do that little thing for me,
won't you?

644
00:36:36,932 --> 00:36:38,809
Where's my hat? There it is.

645
00:36:38,972 --> 00:36:40,928
MARTHA: But, Mortimer.
MORTIMER: What?

646
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:43,970
We were planning to hold services
before dinner.

647
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:48,127
-Couldn't that wait until I get back?
-You could join us in the hymns!

648
00:36:48,212 --> 00:36:51,329
Yes, darling, I'll sing with you,
I'll dance with you, anything.

649
00:36:51,972 --> 00:36:55,009
Remember, don't let anybody in the house
until I get back.

650
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:56,241
You promise?

651
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:57,447
Good.

652
00:36:58,332 --> 00:36:59,526
ABBY: Mortimer!

653
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:00,567
What?

654
00:37:02,412 --> 00:37:04,164
Stop that. What is it?

655
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:05,845
Mr. Hoskins' hat!

656
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:07,971
(Mortimer yelps)

657
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:14,562
CAB DRIVER: Do you still want me to wait?
MORTIMER: Yes! Call me a cab!

658
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:17,962
-Hey, cab! Here you are.
-Don't open it. I'll sit with you!

659
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:21,528
Yeah, that's right.
I can go faster that way. Sure.

660
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,763
Wait a minute! What am I doing?

661
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:31,567
Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat
all mussed up.

662
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:34,652
Shame! Such a nice hat.

663
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:39,929
MARTHA: You know, Mortimer didn't seem
to be quite himself today.

664
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,281
No.

665
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:43,047
Oh, well.

666
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,241
What were you saying about Mortimer?

667
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:56,130
I think I understand why
he seemed so upset.

668
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:57,202
Why?

669
00:37:57,732 --> 00:37:59,609
He's just been married.

670
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:03,610
I believe that always makes
a man a little nervous.

671
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,330
Yes. The poor dears.

672
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:10,088
I'm so happy for Elaine.

673
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:11,882
MARTHA: Abby!

674
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:16,131
If Mortimer's coming back for the services,
we'll need another hymnal.

675
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:18,124
There's one up in my room.

676
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:22,130
I'll go, dear.

677
00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:26,564
We promised Mortimer
we wouldn't let anyone come in.

678
00:38:32,052 --> 00:38:34,441
It's two men,
and I've never seen them before.

679
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:36,409
ABBY: Are you sure?
MARTHA: Yes.

680
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:39,248
ABBY: Let me look.
MARTHA: You look.

681
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,930
-Do you recognize them?
-No, they're strangers to me.

682
00:38:48,732 --> 00:38:51,292
We'll just have to pretend
we're not at home.

683
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:56,201
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

684
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:22,725
JONATHAN: Come in, doctor.

685
00:39:26,812 --> 00:39:28,689
This is the home of my youth.

686
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:33,009
As a boy, I couldn't wait to escape
from this house.

687
00:39:34,212 --> 00:39:36,646
Now I'm glad to escape back into it.

688
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:40,042
Yes, Johnny, it's a good hideout.

689
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:43,723
The family must still live here.

690
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:49,887
I hope there's a fatted calf
awaiting the return of the prodigal.

691
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:51,764
DR. EINSTEIN: A fatted calf?.

692
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,203
Johnny, I'm so hungry.

693
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:56,762
Look, Johnny. Drink.

694
00:39:57,492 --> 00:39:59,483
As if we were expected.

695
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,921
A good omen.

696
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,050
Who are you?

697
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:05,050
What are you doing here?

698
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:09,121
JONATHAN: Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha.

699
00:40:10,852 --> 00:40:12,126
It's Jonathan.

700
00:40:12,732 --> 00:40:14,245
You get out of here!

701
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:16,644
I'm Jonathan, you know.

702
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,924
Your nephew, Jonathan.

703
00:40:19,132 --> 00:40:20,360
ABBY: No, you're not.

704
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:23,529
You're nothing like Jonathan,
so don't pretend you are.

705
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:25,330
You just get out of here.

706
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:28,404
I see you're still wearing
the lovely garnet ring...

707
00:40:28,532 --> 00:40:31,000
...that Grandma Brewster
bought in England.

708
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,685
And you, Aunt Martha,
still the high collar...

709
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:38,242
...to hide the scar
where Grandfather's acid burned you.

710
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:41,845
Why, his voice is like Jonathan's.

711
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:46,566
Have you been in an accident?

712
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,005
My face.

713
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:51,931
Dr. Einstein is responsible for that.

714
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:53,850
He's a plastic surgeon.

715
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:56,721
But I've seen that face before.

716
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,563
Do you remember when we took
the little Schultz boy to the movies...

717
00:41:02,652 --> 00:41:04,244
...and I was so frightened?

718
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:05,685
MARTHA: It was that face.

719
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:11,043
Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy.

720
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:14,329
Don't worry. The last five years,
I give him three different faces.

721
00:41:14,412 --> 00:41:16,482
I give him another one right away.

722
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:20,162
That last face. I saw that picture, too...

723
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:24,644
...just before I operated. I was intoxicated.

724
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,292
JONATHAN: You see, doctor,
what you've done to me?

725
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:30,604
-Even my own family think I'm--
-Johnny, Johnny!

726
00:41:30,812 --> 00:41:34,407
You are home in this lovely house.

727
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:36,046
You know...

728
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:40,046
...how many times he tells me...

729
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:43,728
...about Brooklyn, about this house
and about his aunts...

730
00:41:43,812 --> 00:41:45,370
...he loves so much?

731
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:46,841
They know you.

732
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:48,650
DR. EINSTEIN: Please tell him so.

733
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,164
Jonathan...

734
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:55,090
...it's been a long time.

735
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,806
JONATHAN: Bless you.
It's good to be home again.

736
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,041
Well, Martha....

737
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:05,691
We mustn't let what's on the stove
boil over.

738
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:09,932
If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan.

739
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:13,528
Unless you're in a hurry to go somewhere.

740
00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:18,121
(Slow foreboding instrumental music)

741
00:42:31,052 --> 00:42:32,041
Well, Johnny....

742
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:34,083
Where do we go from here?

743
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:38,127
You know, we got to think fast.

744
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:43,084
The police got pictures of that face.
I got to operate on you right away.

745
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:45,210
We got to find someplace.

746
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:49,570
We got to find someplace
for Mr. Spenalzo, too.

747
00:42:50,332 --> 00:42:52,448
Don't waste any worry on that rat.

748
00:42:52,732 --> 00:42:55,610
But we got a hot stiff on our hands.

749
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:57,730
JONATHAN: Forget Mr. Spenalzo.

750
00:42:58,052 --> 00:43:01,249
But, Johnny, we can't leave
a dead body in the rumble seat.

751
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:03,604
You shouldn't have killed him.

752
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:07,002
Just because he knows something
about us, what happens?

753
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:12,924
We come to him for help
and he tries to shake us down.

754
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:19,845
Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff.

755
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:24,524
That's your work, doctor.

756
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:26,011
You did that to me.

757
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:28,003
Please, Johnny, take it easy.

758
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:31,363
We'll find some place
and I'll fix you up right away.

759
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:34,012
Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first.

760
00:43:34,252 --> 00:43:37,210
JONATHAN: This time, I want the face
of an absolute nonentity.

761
00:43:37,652 --> 00:43:40,689
Yes. I know exactly what I'm going to do.

762
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:44,162
You see, I'm going to take this piece here
and lift it up--

763
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:46,322
Be careful about the stitches this time.

764
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:48,084
You leave that up to me.

765
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:49,685
I'll give you nice ears and--

766
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:52,491
-You were careless last time.
-And new stitches.

767
00:43:52,612 --> 00:43:55,809
And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt.
That's my specialty.

768
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:59,163
-I take it together like this--
-Leave the eyes alone.

769
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:00,924
Leave the nose alone.

770
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,605
Poor Teddy.

771
00:44:03,132 --> 00:44:05,248
I imagine it's for the best.

772
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:11,048
"Ours not to reason why, ours but to do--"

773
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:13,640
Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me.

774
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:15,251
Right there.

775
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:19,240
Sometimes I think,
with the world in its present chaotic state--

776
00:44:19,332 --> 00:44:23,166
Yes, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale.
I sign here as next of kin, don't l?

777
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:27,047
Only last week I created a mild sensation...

778
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:30,044
...at the Bar Association, when I said--

779
00:44:30,172 --> 00:44:32,208
Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.

780
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:36,251
JUDGE: Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over
this week. I've been feeling rather lonely.

781
00:44:36,372 --> 00:44:39,205
No! Never tell them
you've been lonely. Never!

782
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:41,681
JUDGE: Why, I don't--
MORTIMER: Judge!

783
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:44,602
Tell me, are you a drinking man?

784
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:47,565
Why, no. I never indulge.

785
00:44:47,692 --> 00:44:49,603
Good! Then you'll live longer.

786
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:51,808
JUDGE: Of course a little wine now--

787
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:54,042
(Shouts) No! For heaven's sake, no wine!

788
00:44:56,692 --> 00:44:59,126
I may be committing the wrong Brewster.

789
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:04,602
ABBY: Well, I'm sure you both want to get
to wherever you're going.

790
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:09,005
My dear, sweet aunties,
I'm so full of your delicious dinner...

791
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:12,887
-...l'm unable to move a muscle.
-Yes, it's nice here.

792
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:14,491
I found it!

793
00:45:16,852 --> 00:45:18,365
Gentlemen, be seated.

794
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:24,364
Here it is, gentlemen.
The story of my life, my biography.

795
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:27,524
Here's the picture I was telling you about.
Here we both are.

796
00:45:27,612 --> 00:45:30,206
President Roosevelt and General Goethals
at Culebra Cut.

797
00:45:30,372 --> 00:45:32,488
TEDDY: That's me, General, and that's you.

798
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:35,488
My, how I've changed!

799
00:45:36,252 --> 00:45:40,404
That picture hasn't been taken yet.
We haven't started work on Culebra Cut.

800
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,011
We're still digging locks.

801
00:45:42,092 --> 00:45:45,846
And now, General, we will both go
to Panama and inspect the new lock.

802
00:45:45,932 --> 00:45:48,002
ABBY: No, Teddy. Not to Panama.

803
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:51,971
Maybe some other time, Mr. President.
Panama is a long ways off.

804
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,805
-Nonsense! It's just down in the cellar.
-The cellar?

805
00:45:55,332 --> 00:45:58,563
We let him dig the Panama Canal
in the cellar.

806
00:45:59,212 --> 00:46:01,203
-General Goethals?
-Yes, sir.

807
00:46:01,412 --> 00:46:04,370
As President of the US, Commander
in Chief of the Army and Navy...

808
00:46:04,452 --> 00:46:06,408
...and the man who gave you this job...

809
00:46:06,492 --> 00:46:10,041
...l demand that you accompany me
on the inspection of the new lock.

810
00:46:10,132 --> 00:46:12,441
I think it's time for you to go to bed.

811
00:46:12,932 --> 00:46:16,208
I beg your pardon. Who are you?

812
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:18,203
I'm Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed.

813
00:46:20,412 --> 00:46:23,563
No, you're not Wilson.
But your face is familiar.

814
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:28,285
You're not anyone I know now.
Perhaps later, on my hunting trip to Africa.

815
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:31,125
You look like someone
I might meet in the jungle.

816
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:34,889
ABBY: I think, perhaps,
you had better go to bed, Teddy.

817
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:37,850
He and his friend want to get back
to their hotel.

818
00:46:38,532 --> 00:46:40,329
General Goethals, inspect the canal.

819
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:43,846
All right, Mr. President, we go to Panama.

820
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:46,685
Bully, bully! Follow me, General.

821
00:46:50,092 --> 00:46:52,003
It's down south, you know.

822
00:46:55,252 --> 00:46:56,651
Well, bon voyage!

823
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:01,041
Aunt Abby....

824
00:47:01,692 --> 00:47:03,842
I must correct your misapprehension.

825
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,769
You talked of our hotel.

826
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:10,407
We have no hotel. We came here directly.

827
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:14,771
This is not your home,
and I'm afraid you can't stay here.

828
00:47:15,052 --> 00:47:17,441
(Dramatic instrumental music)

829
00:47:19,092 --> 00:47:22,721
Dr. Einstein and I need a place to sleep.

830
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:26,324
You remember that, as a boy,
I could be disagreeable.

831
00:47:27,172 --> 00:47:30,403
It would not be pleasant for any of us if....

832
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:33,245
I don't have to go into details, do l?

833
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:36,280
Perhaps we'd better let them
stay here tonight.

834
00:47:36,692 --> 00:47:38,045
Hey, Johnny....

835
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:39,890
Come here. Quick.

836
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:41,451
JONATHAN: I forgot to tell you...

837
00:47:41,532 --> 00:47:45,320
...Doctor and I are turning Grandfather's
laboratory into an operating room.

838
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:47,528
We expect to be very busy.

839
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,966
-Down here, what do you think I find?
-What?

840
00:47:54,052 --> 00:47:55,849
The Panama Canal.

841
00:47:56,532 --> 00:47:58,602
And it just fits Mr. Spenalzo.

842
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:02,768
See the hole he's digging.
Four feet wide, six feet long.

843
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:04,205
He just fits!

844
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:07,642
You'd think he knew
we were bringing Mr. Spenalzo along.

845
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:09,570
That's hospitality.

846
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,889
Rather a good joke on my aunts.

847
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,248
They're living in a house
with a body buried in the cellar.

848
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:19,723
How do we get him in here?

849
00:48:20,012 --> 00:48:23,925
Yes, we can't just walk
Mr. Spenalzo in through the door.

850
00:48:24,052 --> 00:48:28,523
We'll get the car and after they're in bed,
we'll bring him in through the window.

851
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:29,488
Bed.

852
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:35,288
We're moving the car behind the house.
You'd better get to bed.

853
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:37,966
ABBY: The car is all right where it is
until morning.

854
00:48:38,052 --> 00:48:42,011
I don't want to leave it in the street.
That might be against the law.

855
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:47,521
Abby?

856
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:49,409
What are we going to do?

857
00:48:49,612 --> 00:48:53,525
We're not going to let them spend
more than one night in this house.

858
00:48:53,732 --> 00:48:55,484
What would the neighbors think?

859
00:48:55,572 --> 00:48:59,042
People coming in here with one face
and going out with another.

860
00:48:59,972 --> 00:49:02,406
What are we going to do
about Mr. Hoskins?

861
00:49:02,972 --> 00:49:04,564
Mr. Hoskins!

862
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:07,730
ABBY: It can't be very comfortable
for him in there.

863
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,084
And he's been so patient, the poor dear.

864
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:16,525
I think Teddy had better take
Mr. Hoskins downstairs right away.

865
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:21,730
General Goethals was very pleased.
He said the canal was just the right size.

866
00:49:23,452 --> 00:49:26,967
Teddy, there's been
another yellow-fever victim.

867
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,642
Dear me!
This will be a shock to the General.

868
00:49:31,372 --> 00:49:34,125
ABBY: No, we must keep it a secret.

869
00:49:34,252 --> 00:49:35,321
Yes.

870
00:49:35,612 --> 00:49:36,806
A state secret?

871
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,763
Yes, a state secret.

872
00:49:38,972 --> 00:49:39,961
Promise?

873
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:43,445
You have the word of the President
of the United States.

874
00:49:43,532 --> 00:49:47,002
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Now, let's see.

875
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:50,041
How are we going to keep it a secret?

876
00:49:50,252 --> 00:49:53,688
Teddy, I think you'd better get back down
into the cellar.

877
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:55,001
And then...

878
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:58,761
...when I turn out the lights,
when everything's dark here...

879
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:01,771
...you come up and take
the poor man down to the canal.

880
00:50:01,852 --> 00:50:03,001
Now get along.

881
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:06,130
MARTHA: And we'll come down later
and hold services.

882
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:09,850
TEDDY: Where is the poor devil?
MARTHA: ln the windowseat.

883
00:50:09,932 --> 00:50:11,331
It seems to be spreading.

884
00:50:11,412 --> 00:50:13,562
We've never had yellow fever there before.

885
00:50:17,772 --> 00:50:20,650
I've never even seen Mr. Hoskins!

886
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:24,088
My goodness! That's right, you were out.

887
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:28,283
You just come right along
and see him now.

888
00:50:29,252 --> 00:50:33,848
You know, he's really very nice looking,
considering that he's a Methodist.

889
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,923
(Abby and Martha scream)

890
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:44,247
(Threatening instrumental music)

891
00:50:49,972 --> 00:50:52,327
We're bringing the luggage through here.

892
00:50:58,612 --> 00:51:02,161
ABBY: Your room is waiting for you.
You can go right up.

893
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:06,806
I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours.
You two run along to bed.

894
00:51:07,052 --> 00:51:10,089
But you must be very tired. Both of you.

895
00:51:10,252 --> 00:51:14,245
-And we don't go to bed this early.
-It's time I came home to take care of you.

896
00:51:14,492 --> 00:51:16,323
Take the bags upstairs.

897
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:19,291
For the instruments, I'll come back later.

898
00:51:19,572 --> 00:51:20,846
Good night.

899
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:22,805
Now, we'll all go to bed.

900
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:26,601
I'll wait until you're up
and then turn out the lights.

901
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,089
JONATHAN: Run along, Aunt Martha.

902
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:32,522
Just off the laboratory, Doctor.

903
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,440
-All right, Aunt Abby.
-I'll be right up.

904
00:51:42,612 --> 00:51:44,842
Now! Turn out the lights.

905
00:51:51,852 --> 00:51:54,446
(Dramatic instrumental music)

906
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,811
JONATHAN: Aunt Abby.

907
00:52:20,052 --> 00:52:22,646
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

908
00:52:24,052 --> 00:52:25,531
(Footsteps)

909
00:52:49,052 --> 00:52:51,043
(Windowseat hinges creak)

910
00:53:11,452 --> 00:53:14,728
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

911
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,131
(Cat yowls)

912
00:54:02,852 --> 00:54:04,524
(Tumbling and crashing noises)

913
00:54:16,932 --> 00:54:18,763
DR. EINSTEIN: He's all right, Johnny.

914
00:54:27,092 --> 00:54:30,243
JONATHAN: I'll open the window.
You go round and hand him through.

915
00:54:30,452 --> 00:54:32,727
But he's too heavy for me.

916
00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:37,602
DR. EINSTEIN: You go outside and push,
and I'll stay here and pull.

917
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:40,531
And then together we take him
down to Panama.

918
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:44,611
JONATHAN: All right. We must be quick.
I'll take a look around outside the house.

919
00:54:44,812 --> 00:54:47,280
When I tap on the glass,
you open the window.

920
00:54:47,372 --> 00:54:48,521
DR. EINSTEIN: Yeah.

921
00:54:56,012 --> 00:54:57,809
DR. EINSTEIN: It's dark in here.

922
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:01,289
(Crashing)

923
00:55:01,372 --> 00:55:03,249
(Dr. Einstein whimpers)

924
00:55:03,452 --> 00:55:04,931
(Windowseat hinges creak)

925
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,687
Where am l?

926
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:13,847
Here I am.

927
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,162
Who left this open?

928
00:55:17,292 --> 00:55:18,771
(Tap on window)

929
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,610
DR. EINSTEIN: Okay, wait a minute.
Hand him over.

930
00:55:25,812 --> 00:55:28,372
Now I have him. Allez, up!

931
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:33,526
Now, wait a minute, Johnny.
You lost a leg somewhere.

932
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:37,849
Help me. He's so heavy.

933
00:55:38,052 --> 00:55:41,203
Now I have him. Now I got him.

934
00:55:42,132 --> 00:55:45,329
JONATHAN: Be careful.
DR. EINSTEIN: But his shoe came off.

935
00:55:46,332 --> 00:55:49,130
Help me, Johnny. He's so heavy.

936
00:55:49,332 --> 00:55:51,448
Now I've got him!

937
00:55:51,572 --> 00:55:52,561
(Knock on door)

938
00:55:53,052 --> 00:55:56,169
DR. EINSTEIN: Johnny,
somebody's at the door. Go open, quick.

939
00:55:56,372 --> 00:55:59,444
I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick!

940
00:55:59,852 --> 00:56:01,444
(Knock on door)

941
00:56:05,052 --> 00:56:06,531
(Creaking)

942
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:12,362
(The Wedding March plays
with an eerie nuance)

943
00:56:12,532 --> 00:56:13,726
ELAINE: Mortimer!

944
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,281
Aunt Abby!

945
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:22,366
Aunt Martha!

946
00:56:25,452 --> 00:56:26,931
(Door closes)

947
00:56:27,532 --> 00:56:28,567
Who is it?

948
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,051
Is that you, Teddy?

949
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:31,326
JONATHAN: Who are you?

950
00:56:31,412 --> 00:56:33,607
ELAINE: I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.

951
00:56:33,692 --> 00:56:35,330
JONATHAN: What are you doing here?

952
00:56:35,412 --> 00:56:37,721
ELAINE: I came here
to see my husband, Mortimer.

953
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,962
JONATHAN: Why did you say
your name was Harper?

954
00:56:40,052 --> 00:56:42,168
ELAINE: It is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster.

955
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:44,641
I'm not very used to it.
I'm a brand-new Brewster.

956
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:45,881
JONATHAN: Doctor!

957
00:56:46,932 --> 00:56:48,763
It's all right. It's okay.

958
00:56:57,612 --> 00:57:00,490
ELAINE: Maybe you'd better explain
what you're doing here.

959
00:57:00,572 --> 00:57:02,528
JONATHAN: We happen to live here.

960
00:57:02,812 --> 00:57:04,291
ELAINE: You don't live here.

961
00:57:04,372 --> 00:57:06,966
I'm in this house every day,
I've never seen you before.

962
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:10,124
Where are Martha and Abby?
What have you done to them?

963
00:57:11,212 --> 00:57:13,601
Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves.

964
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:16,526
May I present Dr. Einstein?

965
00:57:16,972 --> 00:57:18,928
Dr. Einstein?

966
00:57:19,092 --> 00:57:21,481
JONATHAN: A surgeon of great distinction.

967
00:57:23,772 --> 00:57:25,842
And something of a magician.

968
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:30,281
-I suppose you'll tell me you're Boris--
-I am Jonathan Brewster.

969
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,921
-You're Jonathan.
-You've heard of me?

970
00:57:35,092 --> 00:57:38,004
-Yes, they talk about you.
-What do they say about me?

971
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:41,448
Just that there's another brother
named Jonathan, that's all.

972
00:57:42,132 --> 00:57:45,169
That explains everything.
Now that I know who you are...

973
00:57:45,332 --> 00:57:48,768
...l'll just be running along
if you'll kindly unlock the door.

974
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:04,682
"That explains everything."
Just what do you mean by that?

975
00:58:04,812 --> 00:58:07,280
Why do you come here
at this time of night?

976
00:58:07,412 --> 00:58:11,087
I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up.
I suppose it was you.

977
00:58:11,652 --> 00:58:13,847
(Dramatic instrumental music)

978
00:58:14,212 --> 00:58:16,521
You thought you saw someone drive up?

979
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:19,645
Yes. Weren't you just outside?
lsn't that your car?

980
00:58:19,732 --> 00:58:22,121
JONATHAN: You saw someone at the car?
ELAINE: Yes.

981
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,369
JONATHAN: What else did you see?
ELAINE: Just that, that's all!

982
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:27,926
JONATHAN: I see.
Is that why you came over here?

983
00:58:28,012 --> 00:58:31,448
No, I came to see Mortimer.
But if he's not home, I'll run--

984
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:33,528
-You've given two names.
-You're hurting me!

985
00:58:33,612 --> 00:58:35,682
I think she's dangerous.

986
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:38,167
No visitors. It's going to be
a private funeral.

987
00:58:40,772 --> 00:58:41,841
ELAINE: Teddy!

988
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:45,322
-Tell these men who I am!
-That's my daughter, Alice.

989
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:46,448
No!

990
00:58:47,772 --> 00:58:50,491
Don't be a tomboy.
Don't play rough with the gentlemen.

991
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:51,561
Charge!

992
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,927
(Dramatic instrumental music)

993
00:59:00,452 --> 00:59:02,124
JONATHAN: Doctor, the cellar.

994
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:05,410
ELAINE: (Yells) Let go of me!

995
00:59:06,132 --> 00:59:07,804
Let go of me!

996
00:59:08,852 --> 00:59:11,047
MARTHA: What's the matter?
What's happening down there?

997
00:59:14,772 --> 00:59:17,286
ABBY: What's the matter?
What are you doing there?

998
00:59:17,652 --> 00:59:20,962
JONATHAN: We caught a burglar,
a sneak thief. Go back to your room.

999
00:59:21,132 --> 00:59:22,884
ABBY: We'll call the police.

1000
00:59:22,972 --> 00:59:25,361
JONATHAN: I'll handle this.
Go back to your room.

1001
00:59:25,452 --> 00:59:26,680
Do you hear me?

1002
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,240
(Knock on door)

1003
00:59:29,372 --> 00:59:30,851
JONATHAN: Don't answer that.

1004
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:33,285
Don't answer that!

1005
00:59:33,372 --> 00:59:35,044
ELAINE: (Screams) Miss Abby!

1006
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:40,280
(Doorbell rings insistently)

1007
00:59:46,212 --> 00:59:50,000
Where's Teddy? ls he upstairs?
Never mind that now, darling.

1008
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:52,731
What are you doing
with your best clothes on?

1009
00:59:53,252 --> 00:59:55,322
Holy.... What's that?

1010
00:59:57,412 --> 00:59:59,972
What's that thing that looks like
a cigar-store dummy?

1011
01:00:00,052 --> 01:00:04,489
-It's your brother and Dr. Einstein.
-Didn't I tell you not to let anybody in?

1012
01:00:04,572 --> 01:00:07,723
-Who did you say it was?
-It's your brother, Jonathan!

1013
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,884
(Overlapping conversation)

1014
01:00:12,492 --> 01:00:15,325
JONATHAN: I've come back home.
MORTIMER: What?

1015
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:17,523
I've come back home, Mortimer.

1016
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:20,729
"I've come back home, Mortimer."
Listen, it talks!

1017
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:23,324
Yes, I talk.

1018
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:28,370
Mortimer, have you forgotten
the things I used to do to you...

1019
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:30,802
...when you were tied to the bedpost?

1020
01:00:30,892 --> 01:00:34,282
The needles under your fingernails.

1021
01:00:34,492 --> 01:00:36,403
-Mortimer, he--
-Wait a minute.

1022
01:00:44,132 --> 01:00:45,724
Holy mackerel!

1023
01:00:45,932 --> 01:00:46,967
It is Jonathan!

1024
01:00:47,052 --> 01:00:49,247
JONATHAN: I'm glad you remember,
Mortimer.

1025
01:00:50,452 --> 01:00:51,851
Yeah, I remember.

1026
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:53,930
How could I forget you?

1027
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:56,647
Where'd you get that face? Hollywood?

1028
01:00:57,292 --> 01:01:01,570
Don't you two boys start quarreling
the minute you've seen each other.

1029
01:01:01,652 --> 01:01:04,928
We invited Jonathan
and Dr. Einstein to stay.

1030
01:01:05,372 --> 01:01:07,363
-What?
-Just for tonight.

1031
01:01:07,492 --> 01:01:09,369
No, I'm staying here tonight.

1032
01:01:09,492 --> 01:01:12,052
-In fact, I'm staying here from now on.
-What about me?

1033
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:14,088
There's no room for anybody else here.

1034
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:15,571
Please, just a moment.

1035
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:17,927
So take that little squirt and beat it!

1036
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,771
Where's Teddy?
I've got to see him right away.

1037
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:23,809
DR. EINSTEIN: We don't take up
much room.

1038
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:26,884
Johnny can sleep on the sofa,
and I'll sleep on the windowseat.

1039
01:01:26,972 --> 01:01:28,246
Nothing to....

1040
01:01:28,532 --> 01:01:29,885
Windowseat?

1041
01:01:30,652 --> 01:01:32,165
Certainly not on the windowseat.

1042
01:01:32,252 --> 01:01:34,482
I'm going to sleep on the windowseat.

1043
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:36,729
I'll sleep on the windowseat from now on.

1044
01:01:36,812 --> 01:01:38,291
Mortimer!

1045
01:01:38,772 --> 01:01:39,761
Now look.

1046
01:01:40,732 --> 01:01:42,165
Now, be a good fellow.

1047
01:01:42,252 --> 01:01:44,971
Here's $10. Go out
and haunt yourself a hotel.

1048
01:01:47,492 --> 01:01:51,451
Mortimer, you know what I do
to people who order me around.

1049
01:01:52,252 --> 01:01:53,731
Johnny....

1050
01:01:54,652 --> 01:01:56,165
Mr. Spenalzo.

1051
01:01:56,252 --> 01:01:57,287
JONATHAN: What?

1052
01:01:57,372 --> 01:02:00,569
DR. EINSTEIN: What's going to happen
to Mr. Spenalzo?

1053
01:02:01,732 --> 01:02:04,485
We can't leave him here
in the windowseat.

1054
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:13,208
Doctor, I've completely lost track
of Mr. Spenalzo.

1055
01:02:13,372 --> 01:02:15,761
MORTIMER: Wait!
Who's this Mr. Spenalzo?

1056
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,241
A friend of ours Johnny was looking for.

1057
01:02:18,332 --> 01:02:20,800
Don't bring anyone else in here.
Now, beat it!

1058
01:02:20,892 --> 01:02:22,245
It's all right, Johnny.

1059
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:24,926
While we are packing,
I'll tell you about him.

1060
01:02:31,132 --> 01:02:34,204
I'll take care of you, Mortimer,
in just a little while.

1061
01:02:34,892 --> 01:02:36,564
MORTIMER: How do you like that?

1062
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,928
The guy stays away for 20 years
and picks tonight to come back.

1063
01:02:40,012 --> 01:02:41,923
Elaine, what are you doing here?

1064
01:02:42,052 --> 01:02:44,247
-Mortimer!
-What's the matter, darling?

1065
01:02:44,332 --> 01:02:47,324
-I almost got killed.
-Killed?

1066
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,725
Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha!

1067
01:02:51,092 --> 01:02:52,764
No! It was Jonathan!

1068
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:55,168
He mistook her for a sneak thief.

1069
01:02:55,252 --> 01:02:57,561
MORTIMER: Oh, that.
ELAINE: It was worse than that.

1070
01:02:57,652 --> 01:02:58,926
He's some kind of a maniac.

1071
01:02:59,012 --> 01:03:00,001
I'm afraid of him.

1072
01:03:00,092 --> 01:03:03,209
MORTIMER: Darling, don't worry about it.
I'm here now. Forget it.

1073
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:06,443
ELAINE: We were married today,
we were going over Niagara Falls...

1074
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,888
...your brother tries to strangle me,
a taxi's waiting...

1075
01:03:10,092 --> 01:03:12,287
...and now you want to sleep
on a windowseat!

1076
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,203
Windowseat. Witherspoon.

1077
01:03:14,452 --> 01:03:16,408
-You'd better run along home.
-What?

1078
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:19,211
Go on home like a good girl.
I got things to do.

1079
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:20,771
ELAINE: But--
MORTIMER: Please.

1080
01:03:20,852 --> 01:03:23,366
Operator?
Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.

1081
01:03:23,652 --> 01:03:26,041
But didn't you hear what I was just saying?

1082
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:29,169
Your own brother Jonathan,
he was trying to strangle me!

1083
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:31,567
-Please! This is important!
-That?

1084
01:03:32,252 --> 01:03:34,402
Mr. Witherspoon?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

1085
01:03:34,492 --> 01:03:36,528
Yes, Mr. Brewster.

1086
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:38,770
Well, I don't understand you.

1087
01:03:38,852 --> 01:03:42,288
ELAINE: He was going to kill me!
MORTIMER: Wait, I can't hear the man.

1088
01:03:42,372 --> 01:03:44,522
Well, look.
I've got the papers all drawn up.

1089
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:48,969
I know it's late, but come down here
and get my brother immediately!

1090
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,127
Please, darling.

1091
01:03:50,212 --> 01:03:54,046
By the way, you've had the papers signed
by your brother and the doctor, of course?

1092
01:03:54,132 --> 01:03:55,281
By the doctor?

1093
01:03:55,412 --> 01:03:58,245
Oh, holy mackerel! I forgot the doctor!

1094
01:03:58,332 --> 01:03:59,811
ELAINE: (Cries) Mortimer!

1095
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:03,084
Please, be quiet! Can't you see
I've got to get a doctor?

1096
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,408
What kind of a doctor? A family doctor?

1097
01:04:05,492 --> 01:04:08,848
You can take your honeymoon,
wedding ring, taxi, windowseat...

1098
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:11,810
...put them in a barrel,
and push them all over Niagara Falls!

1099
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:13,564
Thank you, darling. Thank you.

1100
01:04:13,652 --> 01:04:15,688
Why don't you come down here anyway?

1101
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:19,128
While you're getting here,
I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures.

1102
01:04:19,212 --> 01:04:20,122
(Door slams)

1103
01:04:20,212 --> 01:04:21,167
Elaine!

1104
01:04:21,252 --> 01:04:24,050
I'll get both signatures.
Yeah, well, come right away.

1105
01:04:24,172 --> 01:04:26,402
Elaine! What's the matter with her?

1106
01:04:28,372 --> 01:04:30,363
Elaine! Elaine!

1107
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:39,330
Let me sit down.
Let me think about this thing.

1108
01:04:40,452 --> 01:04:43,205
Doctor, Teddy, signature....

1109
01:04:43,972 --> 01:04:45,200
Hoskins!

1110
01:05:03,012 --> 01:05:05,128
Ye gods! There's another one!

1111
01:05:06,452 --> 01:05:07,805
Aunt Abby! Aunt Martha!

1112
01:05:07,892 --> 01:05:10,008
MORTIMER: Come in here!
ABBY: We're busy.

1113
01:05:10,092 --> 01:05:12,083
No, you come in here now!

1114
01:05:13,972 --> 01:05:16,406
Yes, dear, what is it? Where's Elaine?

1115
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,807
Didn't you promise not to let anyone in?

1116
01:05:18,892 --> 01:05:21,122
-Jonathan just walked in.
-I don't mean Jonathan!

1117
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:24,170
I don't mean Dr. Einstein!
Who is that in the windowseat?

1118
01:05:24,252 --> 01:05:25,924
We told you. Mr. Hoskins.

1119
01:05:26,012 --> 01:05:28,367
It is not Mr. Hoskins!

1120
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,047
There!

1121
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:33,451
Who can that be?

1122
01:05:35,892 --> 01:05:39,328
-Are you saying you've never seen him?
-I certainly am.

1123
01:05:39,492 --> 01:05:41,130
This is a fine how-do-you-do!

1124
01:05:41,212 --> 01:05:43,567
It's getting so anyone thinks
he can walk in!

1125
01:05:43,692 --> 01:05:47,571
Don't you try to get out of this!
That's another one of your gentlemen!

1126
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,802
How can you say such a thing?

1127
01:05:50,172 --> 01:05:52,242
That man's an impostor.

1128
01:05:53,172 --> 01:05:57,085
And if he came here to be buried
in our cellar, he's mistaken.

1129
01:05:58,492 --> 01:06:00,960
You admitted you put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat.

1130
01:06:01,052 --> 01:06:01,848
Yes, I did.

1131
01:06:01,932 --> 01:06:04,651
This man couldn't have got the idea
from Mr. Hoskins!

1132
01:06:04,732 --> 01:06:08,168
-By the way, where is Mr. Hoskins?
-He must have gone to Panama.

1133
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:10,010
-What? You buried him?
-Not yet.

1134
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:12,970
He's down there
waiting for the services, poor dear.

1135
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:16,442
We haven't had a minute,
what with Jonathan in the house.

1136
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:19,328
Oh, dear.

1137
01:06:19,492 --> 01:06:22,962
We've always wanted
to hold a double funeral.

1138
01:06:23,172 --> 01:06:26,801
But I will not read services
over a total stranger!

1139
01:06:27,812 --> 01:06:30,610
A total stranger. How can I believe you?

1140
01:06:30,692 --> 01:06:33,490
There are 12 men down there,
you admit you poisoned them!

1141
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:37,531
Yes, I did. But you don't think
I'd stoop to telling a fib!

1142
01:06:38,052 --> 01:06:39,041
ABBY: Martha!

1143
01:06:39,132 --> 01:06:41,088
What do you think has happened?

1144
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:42,651
"A fib! "

1145
01:06:58,012 --> 01:07:02,210
This may interest you, Mortimer.
I've decided that we're staying.

1146
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:06,644
And I've also decided that you're leaving,
and I mean now.

1147
01:07:06,812 --> 01:07:09,770
Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood
to debate the question.

1148
01:07:09,852 --> 01:07:12,924
Are you getting out,
or am I throwing you out on your ear?

1149
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:15,242
I've led a strange life.

1150
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:17,764
Martha, you come straight along here.

1151
01:07:17,852 --> 01:07:20,605
You just look and see
what's in that windowseat.

1152
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:23,720
No. Don't....

1153
01:07:44,652 --> 01:07:46,131
Jonathan....

1154
01:07:46,292 --> 01:07:48,931
Let Aunt Martha see
what's in the windowseat.

1155
01:07:52,812 --> 01:07:55,770
Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.

1156
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:59,248
I've got some very good news for you.
Jonathan is leaving.

1157
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:04,406
And he's taking Dr. Einstein
and that cold companion with him.

1158
01:08:09,692 --> 01:08:12,570
Listen. You're my brother,
you're a Brewster.

1159
01:08:12,652 --> 01:08:15,803
I'll give you a chance to get away
and take the evidence with you.

1160
01:08:15,972 --> 01:08:18,202
You can't ask for more than that.

1161
01:08:19,132 --> 01:08:20,121
Well?

1162
01:08:22,692 --> 01:08:25,684
All right, in that case,
I'll have to call the police.

1163
01:08:27,852 --> 01:08:29,729
Don't reach for the telephone.

1164
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:33,561
JONATHAN: Remember, what happened
to Mr. Spenalzo can happen to you, too.

1165
01:08:33,772 --> 01:08:35,046
Spenalzo?

1166
01:08:35,252 --> 01:08:37,527
I knew he was a foreigner.

1167
01:08:38,252 --> 01:08:40,129
Put down that telephone.

1168
01:08:40,212 --> 01:08:41,691
(Doorbell rings)

1169
01:08:48,692 --> 01:08:49,886
ABBY: Officer O'Hara!

1170
01:08:49,972 --> 01:08:52,725
I saw the lights and thought
you might have sickness....

1171
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:54,643
You got company? Sorry I disturbed you.

1172
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:57,087
-No! Come in.
-Yes, do come in.

1173
01:08:57,172 --> 01:09:00,005
Come right in, Officer.
This is our nephew, Mortimer.

1174
01:09:00,092 --> 01:09:01,969
-Pleased to meet you.
-Glad to see you.

1175
01:09:02,052 --> 01:09:03,804
And this is another nephew, Jonathan.

1176
01:09:03,892 --> 01:09:05,689
PAT: Pleased to make your acquaintance.

1177
01:09:06,052 --> 01:09:09,010
Your face is familiar.
Haven't I seen a picture of you?

1178
01:09:09,092 --> 01:09:10,844
I don't think so.

1179
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:12,206
PAT: I'll be running along.

1180
01:09:12,292 --> 01:09:13,964
Why? Stay until my brother leaves.

1181
01:09:14,052 --> 01:09:15,405
I got to ring in, Mr.--

1182
01:09:15,492 --> 01:09:18,564
Are you "the" Mortimer Brewster,
the writer and dramatic critic?

1183
01:09:18,692 --> 01:09:19,488
Yes, why?

1184
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:23,406
What a break for me! I'm a playwright.
I'm working on a play now.

1185
01:09:23,532 --> 01:09:26,763
You are? Well, well, well!

1186
01:09:26,972 --> 01:09:30,044
-Maybe I can help you with it.
-Would you? What a break!

1187
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,521
I get wonderful ideas,
but I can't spell them.

1188
01:09:32,612 --> 01:09:34,967
I can spell like the dickens.
Constantinople?

1189
01:09:35,052 --> 01:09:37,646
Let's go into the kitchen.
You can tell me all about it.

1190
01:09:37,732 --> 01:09:39,643
Couldn't you whip up a sandwich?

1191
01:09:39,732 --> 01:09:42,963
MARTHA: I hope you don't mind
eating in the kitchen, Officer O'Hara.

1192
01:09:43,092 --> 01:09:44,969
And where else would you eat?

1193
01:09:45,052 --> 01:09:46,041
(Laughter)

1194
01:09:46,132 --> 01:09:47,804
MORTIMER: See you in a moment.

1195
01:09:49,492 --> 01:09:51,005
This is your last chance.

1196
01:09:51,092 --> 01:09:53,652
I'll keep O'Hara busy
to give you a chance to get out.

1197
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:56,121
All three of you:
you, Dr. Einstein and Spenalzo.

1198
01:09:56,212 --> 01:10:00,490
If you don't leave here, I'll introduce
Officer O'Hara to Mr. Spenalzo.

1199
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,005
My play takes place in--

1200
01:10:02,092 --> 01:10:04,560
I'll be right with you, O'Hara.
Right with you.

1201
01:10:05,732 --> 01:10:07,404
Just give me one moment.

1202
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:10,646
Now get going! All three of you.

1203
01:10:20,172 --> 01:10:23,369
This affair between my brother and myself
has got to be settled.

1204
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:27,127
DR. EINSTEIN: But we've got
trouble enough as it is. Come, let's go.

1205
01:10:27,332 --> 01:10:30,324
We're not going.
We're sleeping right here in this house.

1206
01:10:30,412 --> 01:10:34,291
DR. EINSTEIN: With a cop in the kitchen
and Spenalzo in the windowseat?

1207
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:38,041
That's all he's got on us. We'll take
Spenalzo and dump him in the bay.

1208
01:10:38,132 --> 01:10:41,522
After that, we're coming back here.
Then if he tries to interfere--

1209
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,364
No, no, Johnny. No, please.

1210
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:46,489
We've got a wonderful setup here.
We can make a fortune.

1211
01:10:46,692 --> 01:10:51,083
Two old ladies as a front.
Only Mortimer stands in our way.

1212
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:53,601
JONATHAN: I never did like Mortimer.

1213
01:10:53,772 --> 01:10:55,922
DR. EINSTEIN: Please, take it easy. Please!

1214
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:58,168
Doctor, you know
when I make up my mind--

1215
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:01,329
DR. EINSTEIN: When you make up
your mind, you lose your head.

1216
01:11:01,532 --> 01:11:04,171
Look, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you.

1217
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:07,721
Okay, Johnny. Okay!

1218
01:11:09,252 --> 01:11:12,608
JONATHAN: Take the instruments
and hide them in the cellar. Move fast.

1219
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:14,801
Mr. Brewster....

1220
01:11:14,932 --> 01:11:18,004
-You don't know what goes on in Brooklyn.
-I don't know.

1221
01:11:18,132 --> 01:11:20,851
-My mother was an actress.
-Legitimate?

1222
01:11:20,932 --> 01:11:22,570
Of course. She was my mother.

1223
01:11:22,652 --> 01:11:24,688
-Excuse me.
-Peaches La Tour was her name.

1224
01:11:25,252 --> 01:11:26,241
Hey, Johnny....

1225
01:11:26,332 --> 01:11:28,129
-Come quick!
-What's the matter?

1226
01:11:28,212 --> 01:11:29,611
You know that hole in the cellar?

1227
01:11:29,692 --> 01:11:30,727
JONATHAN: Yes.

1228
01:11:30,812 --> 01:11:32,803
Well, we got an ace in the hole.

1229
01:11:34,652 --> 01:11:37,450
It's no fly-by-night idea.
I worked on it for 12 years.

1230
01:11:37,852 --> 01:11:40,047
Well, rehash it. I'll be back in a minute.

1231
01:11:40,132 --> 01:11:41,770
-Swell.
-I like the first act.

1232
01:11:41,852 --> 01:11:43,729
I didn't tell you the first--

1233
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:52,764
I thought I told you....

1234
01:11:54,652 --> 01:11:56,131
Jonathan!

1235
01:11:57,452 --> 01:11:59,170
JONATHAN: Yes, Mortimer.

1236
01:12:01,052 --> 01:12:04,249
MORTIMER: What are you doing still here?
I thought I said beat it.

1237
01:12:04,332 --> 01:12:05,321
We're not going.

1238
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:07,403
MORTIMER: You're not going?
DR. EINSTEIN: No.

1239
01:12:07,492 --> 01:12:09,084
MORTIMER: You stay out of this.

1240
01:12:09,172 --> 01:12:11,083
All right, you asked for it.

1241
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:13,283
MORTIMER: Officer O'Hara?
PAT: Coming.

1242
01:12:13,732 --> 01:12:16,121
If you tell O'Hara
what's in the windowseat...

1243
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:18,203
...l'll tell him what's in the cellar.

1244
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,247
Cellar?

1245
01:12:19,532 --> 01:12:23,127
There's an elderly gentleman down there
who seems to be very dead.

1246
01:12:24,652 --> 01:12:27,246
-What were you doing there?
-What's he doing there?

1247
01:12:27,332 --> 01:12:29,607
Now what are you going to tell O'Hara?

1248
01:12:29,932 --> 01:12:33,163
Your aunts want to hear the rest.
Shall I bring them in here?

1249
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:35,852
You can't do that now.
You'd better ring in.

1250
01:12:36,052 --> 01:12:38,725
The heck with ringing in!
I want to tell you the plot.

1251
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,167
You can't tell me
in front of those two fellas.

1252
01:12:41,252 --> 01:12:42,287
Lowbrows, huh?

1253
01:12:42,412 --> 01:12:45,722
Let's go where we can be alone.
I'll meet you there later.

1254
01:12:45,852 --> 01:12:48,127
How about the backroom at Kelly's?

1255
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:51,050
Fine place. Bohemian atmosphere.
Genius at work.

1256
01:12:51,132 --> 01:12:53,043
You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.

1257
01:12:53,172 --> 01:12:55,561
JONATHAN: Why don't you both go down
in the cellar?

1258
01:12:55,652 --> 01:12:57,483
That's all right with me.

1259
01:12:57,612 --> 01:13:00,763
There's a much more literary atmosphere
in Kelly's, I assure you.

1260
01:13:00,852 --> 01:13:02,331
PAT: This opening will kill you.

1261
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:04,323
I'm waiting to be born and the doctor--

1262
01:13:04,412 --> 01:13:05,561
The doctor!

1263
01:13:05,692 --> 01:13:08,126
Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.

1264
01:13:08,252 --> 01:13:11,130
You won't stand me up, will you?
This is a great play.

1265
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:13,203
-I'll see you down there.
-Can't wait!

1266
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:14,486
Doctor, doctor.

1267
01:13:14,652 --> 01:13:17,007
Where are those papers? There they are.

1268
01:13:18,452 --> 01:13:22,127
You're smug, aren't you? You think
you've got it over me. You haven't.

1269
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:26,166
You think I'm afraid to tell about Spenalzo
because of Hoskins. Well, I'm not!

1270
01:13:26,252 --> 01:13:27,605
The moment I get Spenalzo....

1271
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:30,923
The moment the doctor signs,
I don't care who knows about Hoskins.

1272
01:13:31,012 --> 01:13:34,084
And you better feel the same way
about Spenalzo. Yes, Spenalzo!

1273
01:13:34,172 --> 01:13:35,525
JONATHAN: Where are you going?

1274
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:37,170
To the doctor's. Where do you....

1275
01:13:37,252 --> 01:13:40,005
When I come back,
I expect to find you gone. Wait for me!

1276
01:13:40,692 --> 01:13:42,569
We'll wait for him.

1277
01:13:43,572 --> 01:13:45,164
Did he look guilty!

1278
01:13:45,852 --> 01:13:49,003
Well, Martha,
I think we can start the services now.

1279
01:13:50,372 --> 01:13:52,169
ABBY: We thought we heard you leave.

1280
01:13:52,252 --> 01:13:55,210
Perish the thought, dear aunties.
That was just Mortimer.

1281
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:57,123
And speaking of services...

1282
01:13:57,252 --> 01:14:01,484
...will you make us some coffee
while we take Spenalzo down to the cellar?

1283
01:14:02,132 --> 01:14:04,692
MARTHA: No, Jonathan.
You've got to take him with you!

1284
01:14:04,812 --> 01:14:08,009
There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs
waiting for him.

1285
01:14:08,132 --> 01:14:11,283
ABBY: A friend of Mortimer's?
JONATHAN: Take his feet, Doctor.

1286
01:14:11,772 --> 01:14:14,491
Mr. Spenalzo and he
will get along fine together.

1287
01:14:14,572 --> 01:14:16,005
They're both dead.

1288
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,524
He must mean Mr. Hoskins.

1289
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:20,131
DR. EINSTEIN: Mr. Hoskins?

1290
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:27,128
You know about what's down there?

1291
01:14:27,252 --> 01:14:30,483
Of course we do.
And he's no friend of Mortimer's.

1292
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:33,206
-He's one of our gentlemen.
-Your gentlemen?

1293
01:14:33,412 --> 01:14:37,121
Yes. And we won't have
any strangers buried in our cellar.

1294
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:40,284
-But Mr. Hoskins--
-Mr. Hoskins is no stranger.

1295
01:14:40,412 --> 01:14:42,846
Besides, there's no room for Mr. Spenalzo.

1296
01:14:42,932 --> 01:14:44,763
The cellar's crowded already.

1297
01:14:44,852 --> 01:14:46,285
Crowded? With what?

1298
01:14:46,412 --> 01:14:49,006
There are 12 graves down there now.

1299
01:14:55,012 --> 01:14:56,491
Twelve graves.

1300
01:14:56,572 --> 01:14:59,723
That leaves very little room
and we're going to need it.

1301
01:15:00,052 --> 01:15:02,646
You mean, you and Aunt Martha
have murdered 12--

1302
01:15:02,772 --> 01:15:05,889
Murdered? Certainly not.
It's one of our charities.

1303
01:15:05,972 --> 01:15:08,691
MARTHA: Why, what we've been doing
is a mercy.

1304
01:15:08,812 --> 01:15:12,964
So you just take your Mr. Spenalzo
out of here.

1305
01:15:13,052 --> 01:15:14,724
(Dr. Einstein cackles)

1306
01:15:17,692 --> 01:15:19,728
You've done all that...

1307
01:15:20,212 --> 01:15:24,046
...right here in this house
and buried them in the cellar?

1308
01:15:25,412 --> 01:15:27,846
That's wonderful, Johnny!

1309
01:15:28,132 --> 01:15:30,362
We've been chased all over the world...

1310
01:15:30,452 --> 01:15:34,411
...and they stay right here in Brooklyn,
and they do just as good as you do.

1311
01:15:34,532 --> 01:15:35,567
What?

1312
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:39,082
You got 12, they got 12.

1313
01:15:39,572 --> 01:15:40,687
I've got 13.

1314
01:15:40,892 --> 01:15:44,089
-No, Johnny, 12. Don't brag.
-Thirteen.

1315
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:47,768
There's Mr. Spenalzo.
Then the first one in London.

1316
01:15:47,972 --> 01:15:50,770
Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney,
one in Melbourne...

1317
01:15:50,852 --> 01:15:53,491
...two in San Francisco,
one in Phoenix, Arizona.

1318
01:15:53,572 --> 01:15:54,561
Phoenix?

1319
01:15:54,812 --> 01:15:57,201
-The filling station.
-Filling....

1320
01:15:57,332 --> 01:16:00,165
Three in Chicago and one in South Bend.

1321
01:16:00,372 --> 01:16:01,646
That makes 13.

1322
01:16:01,732 --> 01:16:05,042
You cannot count the one in South Bend.
He died of pneumonia.

1323
01:16:05,132 --> 01:16:07,965
He wouldn't have died of pneumonia
if I hadn't shot him.

1324
01:16:08,052 --> 01:16:10,043
You cannot count him.

1325
01:16:10,372 --> 01:16:12,727
You got 12, they got 12.

1326
01:16:12,852 --> 01:16:16,162
DR. EINSTEIN: The old ladies
is just as good as you are.

1327
01:16:18,932 --> 01:16:20,923
They are, are they?

1328
01:16:21,972 --> 01:16:24,406
Well, that's easily taken care of.

1329
01:16:24,612 --> 01:16:27,046
All I need is one more.

1330
01:16:27,252 --> 01:16:30,005
That's all. Just one more.

1331
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:34,762
And I've a pretty good idea who it is.

1332
01:16:35,372 --> 01:16:38,489
I'm a lucky man to have caught you
at home, Dr. Gilchrist.

1333
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:40,244
This is most irregular.

1334
01:16:40,372 --> 01:16:43,967
I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed,
but only you can help me.

1335
01:16:44,052 --> 01:16:47,601
I know Teddy blows bugles,
but I can't commit a man just on that.

1336
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:49,085
If you'd talk with him...

1337
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:51,970
...l'm sure you'd be convinced.
Here's the house l--

1338
01:16:52,052 --> 01:16:54,361
(Abby and Martha sing hymns)

1339
01:16:54,452 --> 01:16:56,204
-There goes Hoskins.
-Who?

1340
01:16:56,332 --> 01:16:58,209
What? Did I say....

1341
01:17:00,212 --> 01:17:01,645
-You better wait.
-Here?

1342
01:17:01,732 --> 01:17:02,960
I'll bring Teddy out.

1343
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:05,930
I wouldn't want to alarm the old ladies,
seeing a doctor.

1344
01:17:06,012 --> 01:17:08,162
-You wait here.
-In the cemetery?

1345
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:09,566
It's Halloween.

1346
01:17:09,652 --> 01:17:11,927
The pixies won't be out till after midnight.

1347
01:17:12,012 --> 01:17:15,687
Make yourself comfortable.
Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right back.

1348
01:17:16,212 --> 01:17:17,770
-Hey, $22.50!
-What?

1349
01:17:17,892 --> 01:17:18,881
$22.50!

1350
01:17:19,012 --> 01:17:21,207
Oh, yes, looks good on you!

1351
01:17:21,852 --> 01:17:23,604
CAB DRIVER: Not the suit, the meter!

1352
01:17:24,972 --> 01:17:27,770
"Looks good on me." $22.50.

1353
01:17:31,692 --> 01:17:34,764
-Did you give him a 21-gun salute?
-Yes, with a Maxim silencer.

1354
01:17:34,852 --> 01:17:37,082
CAB DRIVER: Five more bucks
and you'll own it.

1355
01:17:37,172 --> 01:17:39,163
No, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.

1356
01:17:40,932 --> 01:17:43,844
-Mr. President, may I present--
-Dr. Livingstone!

1357
01:17:43,932 --> 01:17:46,969
-Livingstone?
-That's what he presumes.

1358
01:17:47,092 --> 01:17:49,811
The doctor would like
to have a few words with you.

1359
01:17:49,892 --> 01:17:52,770
Certainly. Welcome to Washington.

1360
01:17:52,932 --> 01:17:55,685
Arlington is beautiful
at this time of year, is it not?

1361
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:57,330
DR. GILCHRIST: Yes, indeed.

1362
01:18:02,212 --> 01:18:04,487
Well now, that's that.

1363
01:18:04,692 --> 01:18:06,683
It gives me a chance to rest.

1364
01:18:10,412 --> 01:18:11,731
So far, so good.

1365
01:18:14,452 --> 01:18:15,726
Not so good.

1366
01:18:21,612 --> 01:18:23,523
Do you or do you not love me?

1367
01:18:23,652 --> 01:18:25,244
Oh, Elaine....

1368
01:18:25,332 --> 01:18:28,847
How can you say such a thing?
Darling, of course I love you.

1369
01:18:28,932 --> 01:18:30,604
-Do you?
-Yes, darling.

1370
01:18:30,732 --> 01:18:34,088
Then why have you been treating me
the way you have?

1371
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:40,846
Darling, I love you so much,
I can't go through with our marriage.

1372
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:44,690
Have you suddenly gone crazy?

1373
01:18:44,772 --> 01:18:47,491
I don't think so,
but it's only a matter of time.

1374
01:18:47,572 --> 01:18:51,087
Darling, would you want to have children
with three heads?

1375
01:18:51,172 --> 01:18:55,051
You wouldn't want to set up housekeeping
in a padded cell.

1376
01:18:55,212 --> 01:18:58,249
-What are you talking about?
-Well, I don't quite know.

1377
01:18:58,452 --> 01:19:01,762
I probably should have told you this before,
but you see...

1378
01:19:01,852 --> 01:19:04,924
...well, insanity runs in my family.

1379
01:19:05,012 --> 01:19:06,001
(Hymns continue)

1380
01:19:06,092 --> 01:19:08,083
It practically gallops.

1381
01:19:09,892 --> 01:19:12,406
Just because Teddy's strange,
that doesn't mean--

1382
01:19:12,492 --> 01:19:14,926
No, darling. It's way back before Teddy.

1383
01:19:15,132 --> 01:19:18,807
This goes back to the first Brewster
who came over on the Mayflower.

1384
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:22,926
You know how in those days
the lndians used to scalp the settlers?

1385
01:19:23,372 --> 01:19:25,408
He used to scalp the lndians.

1386
01:19:26,252 --> 01:19:28,004
Darling, that's ancient history.

1387
01:19:28,092 --> 01:19:31,562
Doctor, I'll run for a third term,
but I won't be elected.

1388
01:19:31,652 --> 01:19:34,485
That'll mean the last of the Roosevelts
in the White House.

1389
01:19:34,572 --> 01:19:37,928
-That's what you think.
-Of course, if the country insists....

1390
01:19:38,012 --> 01:19:40,207
Darling, all this doesn't prove a thing.

1391
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:43,170
Look at your aunts.
They're Brewsters, aren't they?

1392
01:19:43,252 --> 01:19:45,925
They're the sweetest,
sanest people I've ever known.

1393
01:19:48,332 --> 01:19:51,130
Well, even they have their peculiarities.

1394
01:19:51,212 --> 01:19:54,090
What of it? So your family's crazy.
So you're crazy.

1395
01:19:54,172 --> 01:19:55,969
That's the way I love you.

1396
01:19:56,332 --> 01:19:58,641
I'm crazy too, but kiss me.

1397
01:19:58,972 --> 01:20:00,530
No, no. I....

1398
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:07,368
Goodbye, Ambassador.
I've enjoyed this little talk very much.

1399
01:20:07,452 --> 01:20:10,842
Anytime you're in Washington,
drop in to see me at the White House.

1400
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:19,285
-Those papers.
-Go away. Papers!

1401
01:20:19,452 --> 01:20:21,886
-I'll commit him to any place.
-You will?

1402
01:20:21,972 --> 01:20:24,202
I've just been appointed
Ambassador to Bolivia!

1403
01:20:24,292 --> 01:20:26,886
You see? Didn't I tell you?

1404
01:20:26,972 --> 01:20:30,044
Don't worry about that.
Just go on signing the papers.

1405
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:32,161
Thank you.

1406
01:20:34,332 --> 01:20:38,007
ABBY: All right! We'll find out
whose house this is!

1407
01:20:38,132 --> 01:20:40,726
ABBY: I'm warning you, you better stop it.

1408
01:20:40,812 --> 01:20:44,248
There's no use doing what you're doing.
It'll just have to be undone.

1409
01:20:44,332 --> 01:20:45,970
JONATHAN: Aunt Abby, go to bed!

1410
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:50,005
It's a terrible thing to do to bury
a good Methodist with a foreigner.

1411
01:20:50,092 --> 01:20:51,491
Where have you been?

1412
01:20:51,572 --> 01:20:54,132
Getting some papers signed.
Is Teddy in his room?

1413
01:20:54,212 --> 01:20:55,930
What is the matter with you?

1414
01:20:56,012 --> 01:20:58,924
Running around getting papers signed
at a time like this.

1415
01:20:59,012 --> 01:21:01,128
Martha and I are going for the police.

1416
01:21:01,212 --> 01:21:02,167
Police!

1417
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:04,041
Wait!

1418
01:21:04,132 --> 01:21:06,441
-You can't go for the police.
-Oh, no?

1419
01:21:06,572 --> 01:21:08,244
You know what Jonathan's doing?

1420
01:21:08,332 --> 01:21:11,210
He's putting Mr. Hoskins
and Mr. Spenalzo in together.

1421
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:12,520
All right, let him.

1422
01:21:12,612 --> 01:21:15,251
DR. EINSTEIN: This is all fixed up nice now.

1423
01:21:15,452 --> 01:21:17,807
Nice and smooth like a lake.

1424
01:21:17,972 --> 01:21:21,965
The President will be very proud
of his Panama Canal.

1425
01:21:23,532 --> 01:21:25,887
Johnny, bed feels good already.

1426
01:21:25,972 --> 01:21:29,521
You know, we didn't get any sleep
for 48 hours.

1427
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:31,370
You're forgetting, Doctor.

1428
01:21:32,612 --> 01:21:35,888
If Jonathan and Mr. Spenalzo
aren't out this house before morning...

1429
01:21:35,972 --> 01:21:37,724
...we're going for the police.

1430
01:21:37,812 --> 01:21:39,450
I'll get them out, I promise!

1431
01:21:39,532 --> 01:21:43,445
-Then you get the wedding silver.
-Remember, no police! No police!

1432
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:45,843
Look, go to bed, will you?

1433
01:21:45,972 --> 01:21:49,442
Get out of those clothes!
You look like a double blackout.

1434
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:51,967
My brother, Mortimer.

1435
01:21:52,252 --> 01:21:53,970
I just heard him upstairs.

1436
01:21:54,612 --> 01:21:57,046
No! I am tired.

1437
01:21:57,132 --> 01:22:01,410
You forget, I got to operate
on your face tomorrow.

1438
01:22:01,612 --> 01:22:04,410
JONATHAN: You are going
to operate tomorrow, Doctor.

1439
01:22:04,572 --> 01:22:07,245
But tonight we are taking care
ofMortimer.

1440
01:22:07,372 --> 01:22:10,409
But Johnny, not tonight! I'm sleepy.

1441
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:12,926
We'll do it tomorrow. Or the next day.

1442
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:15,203
JONATHAN: Look at me, Doctor.

1443
01:22:16,052 --> 01:22:19,761
You can see that it's got to be done,
can't you?

1444
01:22:20,012 --> 01:22:23,482
Yeah, I know that look.

1445
01:22:23,692 --> 01:22:26,968
It's a little late to dissolve our partnership.

1446
01:22:27,172 --> 01:22:29,561
Okay, Johnny. Okay, we'll do it.

1447
01:22:29,692 --> 01:22:32,889
But the quick way, huh?
The quick twist like in London.

1448
01:22:33,092 --> 01:22:37,051
No, Doctor. I think this calls
for something special.

1449
01:22:37,732 --> 01:22:41,122
I think, perhaps, the Melbourne method.

1450
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:43,965
Not the Melbourne method, please!

1451
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:45,764
Two hours!

1452
01:22:45,932 --> 01:22:48,287
And then when it was all over, what?

1453
01:22:48,492 --> 01:22:52,246
The fellow in London was just as dead
as the fellow in Melbourne.

1454
01:22:53,972 --> 01:22:55,564
Don't do that, Mr. President.

1455
01:22:55,652 --> 01:22:58,530
But I cannot sign anything
without consulting my Cabinet.

1456
01:22:58,612 --> 01:22:59,840
This must be secret.

1457
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:02,571
A secret proclamation? How unusual.

1458
01:23:02,772 --> 01:23:05,605
Yes, it's the only way
we can outsmart the other fellow.

1459
01:23:05,692 --> 01:23:07,922
-Who's the other fellow?
-That's the secret.

1460
01:23:08,012 --> 01:23:09,764
Oh, I see!

1461
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:11,520
Very clever.

1462
01:23:11,852 --> 01:23:14,366
A secret proclamation
has to be signed in secret.

1463
01:23:14,452 --> 01:23:17,410
-Of course, Mr. President.
-I'll put on my signing clothes.

1464
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,608
You already have them on, Mr. President.

1465
01:23:19,692 --> 01:23:21,922
So I have. Wait here.

1466
01:23:25,252 --> 01:23:27,208
(Whispers) Hey, Mr. Brewster.

1467
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:28,845
MORTIMER: What is it, mice?

1468
01:23:31,932 --> 01:23:34,844
-You get out of this house.
-Can't you see I'm busy?

1469
01:23:34,972 --> 01:23:36,451
(Bugle blows)

1470
01:23:43,492 --> 01:23:45,164
Thank you, Mr. President.

1471
01:23:45,732 --> 01:23:48,371
What a load off my mind.
Boy, could I use a drink!

1472
01:23:48,452 --> 01:23:52,001
-Get out of here, will you, please?
-What? Speak up. I can't hear you.

1473
01:23:52,092 --> 01:23:53,889
Johnny's in a bad mood. Get out!

1474
01:23:53,972 --> 01:23:57,328
-Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.
-Please listen to me. Get out.

1475
01:23:57,412 --> 01:24:01,007
Stop all this! What are you doing?
Look, Doc-- Are you really a doctor?

1476
01:24:01,092 --> 01:24:02,889
Yes, Heidelberg, 1919.

1477
01:24:03,012 --> 01:24:05,572
Heidelberg?
How'd you hook up with Jonathan?

1478
01:24:05,692 --> 01:24:09,571
I tell you later about that, but you go now.
Please listen to me.

1479
01:24:10,532 --> 01:24:11,851
Stop it, Doctor!

1480
01:24:11,932 --> 01:24:14,810
You get out of here!
Look, when Johnny's in that mood...

1481
01:24:14,892 --> 01:24:17,087
...he's a madman. He's a maniac!

1482
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:20,250
And then things happen. Horrible things.

1483
01:24:20,332 --> 01:24:22,527
-Get out of here!
-Will you stop it?

1484
01:24:22,612 --> 01:24:25,206
Stop telling me about Jonathan,
I'll take care of him.

1485
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:28,090
You take care of yourself.
Get going, little fellow.

1486
01:24:28,172 --> 01:24:30,208
-What's that? Wait.
-My schnapps.

1487
01:24:30,292 --> 01:24:32,760
-I could use that.
-That's mine.

1488
01:24:33,932 --> 01:24:36,002
Please. Only for dramatic critics.

1489
01:24:36,092 --> 01:24:38,811
You beat it before things start popping
around here.

1490
01:24:38,892 --> 01:24:40,962
But, look, Mr. Brewster, please.

1491
01:24:41,052 --> 01:24:42,610
You've just been married.

1492
01:24:42,692 --> 01:24:46,082
You have a nice little wife waiting for you.
Please go now.

1493
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:47,526
Please.

1494
01:24:49,092 --> 01:24:51,083
(Exasperated mutters)

1495
01:24:51,572 --> 01:24:54,245
Don't those plays you see all the time
teach you anything?

1496
01:24:54,532 --> 01:24:58,081
Don't get me on the subject of plays!
I've got to wait for Mr. Witherspoon.

1497
01:24:58,172 --> 01:25:00,606
At least people in plays
act like they got sense.

1498
01:25:00,692 --> 01:25:03,490
Did anybody in a play
ever act like they got intelligence?

1499
01:25:03,572 --> 01:25:06,723
-How can somebody be so stupid?
-You ought to have my job.

1500
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:10,811
When you get out of prison, have yourself
wheeled to the Garrick Theater.

1501
01:25:11,132 --> 01:25:14,442
There's a play that's so bad,
it'll still be running when you get out.

1502
01:25:14,532 --> 01:25:16,329
There's a man.... Now listen to this.

1503
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:19,848
He knows he's in the house with murderers
and should know he's in danger.

1504
01:25:19,932 --> 01:25:22,321
He's even been warned to get out.
And does he go?

1505
01:25:22,412 --> 01:25:24,130
No, he doesn't. He stays!

1506
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:28,803
This fellow doesn't even have sense
to be scared or to be on his guard.

1507
01:25:29,012 --> 01:25:30,968
The murderer even invites him to sit down.

1508
01:25:31,052 --> 01:25:32,963
-What do you think he does?
-I don't know.

1509
01:25:33,052 --> 01:25:34,690
He sits down!

1510
01:25:34,772 --> 01:25:37,889
He deliberately pulls up a chair
and he sits down in it.

1511
01:25:38,012 --> 01:25:39,445
Isn't that great?

1512
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:43,602
So there he is,
all waiting to be trussed up and gagged.

1513
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:48,160
What do you think they tied him up with?
The curtain cord.

1514
01:25:49,252 --> 01:25:50,731
DR. EINSTEIN: Curtain cord?

1515
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,889
But didn't he see him get it?

1516
01:25:52,972 --> 01:25:56,044
No. The silly chump sits down
with his back toward the murderer.

1517
01:25:56,132 --> 01:25:58,930
All he has to do is look around,
but does he? No!

1518
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:03,728
MORTIMER: See, brother Heidelberg,
in a play or even in a movie...

1519
01:26:03,972 --> 01:26:07,123
...a fellow never sees or hears anything.
That's right.

1520
01:26:07,212 --> 01:26:09,043
DR. EINSTEIN: But what does he do?

1521
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:12,921
The big chump sits there.
This fellow's supposed to be bright.

1522
01:26:13,012 --> 01:26:16,163
Now get a load of this.
Look at the attitude.

1523
01:26:16,492 --> 01:26:20,121
Large as life! He sits there
waiting to be tied up and gagged.

1524
01:26:20,692 --> 01:26:22,011
The big dope!

1525
01:26:24,652 --> 01:26:28,122
(Dramatic instrumental music)

1526
01:26:30,772 --> 01:26:34,481
You were right about that fellow.
He wasn't very bright.

1527
01:26:35,692 --> 01:26:37,125
JONATHAN: Yes, Mortimer.

1528
01:26:38,172 --> 01:26:40,686
I've been away for 20 years.

1529
01:26:40,972 --> 01:26:44,123
But never, my dear brother,
were you out of my mind.

1530
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:49,723
In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.

1531
01:26:53,252 --> 01:26:56,528
(Dramatic instrumental music)

1532
01:27:11,572 --> 01:27:15,281
The more you struggle
the more you strangle yourself.

1533
01:27:17,972 --> 01:27:20,645
Later on, you may consider that a blessing.

1534
01:27:52,892 --> 01:27:54,086
Now, Doctor...

1535
01:27:55,892 --> 01:27:57,405
...we go to work.

1536
01:27:57,492 --> 01:27:59,847
Johnny, for me, the quick way. Please.

1537
01:28:00,892 --> 01:28:03,645
-This must be an artistic achievement.
-Please.

1538
01:28:03,852 --> 01:28:07,401
After all, we're performing
before a very distinguished critic.

1539
01:28:08,052 --> 01:28:09,280
DR. EINSTEIN: Please!

1540
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:13,362
All right. Let's get it over with.

1541
01:28:14,252 --> 01:28:17,642
But I cannot see this without the drink.

1542
01:28:18,292 --> 01:28:20,089
JONATHAN: Pull yourself together.

1543
01:28:20,172 --> 01:28:23,960
But I can't pull myself together
without a drink.

1544
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:26,885
You remember when we came in,
there was some wine.

1545
01:28:26,972 --> 01:28:29,805
And then they took it.
Where did they put it?

1546
01:28:31,212 --> 01:28:33,123
I found some wine.

1547
01:28:34,572 --> 01:28:36,563
Here, I'll split it with you.

1548
01:28:36,652 --> 01:28:39,246
We both have a drink before we operate.

1549
01:28:39,492 --> 01:28:43,883
I am so happy that we don't have
to operate without a drink.

1550
01:28:48,852 --> 01:28:50,126
JONATHAN: Doctor.

1551
01:28:50,412 --> 01:28:51,811
One moment, please.

1552
01:28:52,652 --> 01:28:54,449
Where are your manners?

1553
01:28:57,092 --> 01:28:58,571
Yes, Mortimer.

1554
01:28:58,812 --> 01:29:02,691
I realize now that it was you
who brought me back to Brooklyn.

1555
01:29:02,772 --> 01:29:04,171
We drink to you.

1556
01:29:05,492 --> 01:29:07,403
To my dear, dead brother.

1557
01:29:13,852 --> 01:29:15,205
(Bugle blows)

1558
01:29:21,652 --> 01:29:23,131
(Clock chimes)

1559
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:25,520
JONATHAN: That idiot!

1560
01:29:25,612 --> 01:29:27,443
He goes next. That's all. He goes next!

1561
01:29:27,532 --> 01:29:29,090
DR. EINSTEIN: Not Teddy! Please!

1562
01:29:29,252 --> 01:29:31,766
-We'll get to him later.
-You won't at all!

1563
01:29:31,932 --> 01:29:33,809
We have to work fast. The quick way.

1564
01:29:33,892 --> 01:29:35,405
The quick way, yes!

1565
01:29:35,492 --> 01:29:38,723
If it has to be, then the quick way.
I'll help you.

1566
01:29:39,052 --> 01:29:40,531
(Doorbell rings)

1567
01:29:52,892 --> 01:29:55,008
The colonel has to quit blowing that horn.

1568
01:29:55,092 --> 01:29:58,050
It's all right. We're taking
the bugle away from him.

1569
01:29:58,132 --> 01:30:01,090
I'd better talk to him myself.
Where's the lights?

1570
01:30:03,652 --> 01:30:05,722
(Muffled shouts)

1571
01:30:07,292 --> 01:30:08,964
You stood me up!

1572
01:30:09,532 --> 01:30:12,444
PAT: I've been waiting for you
for over an hour at Kelly's.

1573
01:30:13,412 --> 01:30:15,368
-What happened to him?
-Nothing.

1574
01:30:15,532 --> 01:30:20,526
He was explaining a play he saw and
that's what happened to a man in the play.

1575
01:30:21,212 --> 01:30:22,122
I see.

1576
01:30:22,652 --> 01:30:24,722
Did that really happen in a play you saw?

1577
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:27,401
How do you like that?
You can't trust nobody.

1578
01:30:27,492 --> 01:30:29,926
They practically stole that from my play.

1579
01:30:30,252 --> 01:30:33,961
In the second act, just--
Maybe I'd better start at the beginning.

1580
01:30:35,932 --> 01:30:37,285
Yeah, sure.

1581
01:30:40,492 --> 01:30:41,971
No.

1582
01:30:42,892 --> 01:30:45,360
You've got to hear the plot!

1583
01:30:48,492 --> 01:30:52,201
My mother's making up.
Like a flash, out of a clear sky...

1584
01:30:52,332 --> 01:30:54,926
...the door opens and a man
with a mustache comes in.

1585
01:30:55,012 --> 01:30:58,641
He says, "Miss Peaches La Tour,
will you marry me?"

1586
01:30:59,492 --> 01:31:04,202
That's the first scene. My mother doesn't
say they're married. That's the surprise!

1587
01:31:04,332 --> 01:31:05,606
What a kick!

1588
01:31:06,052 --> 01:31:09,522
Twenty-five years pass.
Well, in the meantime, there's me.

1589
01:31:09,692 --> 01:31:13,048
Growing into a magnificent specimen.
So what do I do?

1590
01:31:13,132 --> 01:31:16,329
I join the police force and become
one of New York's finest.

1591
01:31:16,412 --> 01:31:19,848
I'm cleaning out a crooked laundry, see?
Little do I know it...

1592
01:31:19,972 --> 01:31:22,361
...but a dope fiend with a knife is after me.

1593
01:31:22,452 --> 01:31:23,931
I'm in great danger.

1594
01:31:25,292 --> 01:31:28,284
It's getting you, ain't it?
I can see it in your eyes.

1595
01:31:29,732 --> 01:31:31,529
You ain't heard nothing yet.

1596
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:34,724
All of a sudden, a fire breaks out.
What an effect!

1597
01:31:34,812 --> 01:31:37,121
Firemen rush in and who's leading them?

1598
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:39,408
Mayor Fiorello La Guardia!

1599
01:31:42,092 --> 01:31:43,571
What's the matter with him?

1600
01:31:43,652 --> 01:31:46,246
-Probably your play put him to sleep.
-What?

1601
01:31:46,332 --> 01:31:50,245
-I personally like it very much.
-It's probably over his head.

1602
01:31:50,572 --> 01:31:53,450
-Where have I seen that face before?
-No, please.

1603
01:31:55,572 --> 01:31:58,484
The scene changes. It's an evolving stage.

1604
01:31:58,572 --> 01:32:00,767
I'm walking along my beat, casual-like...

1605
01:32:00,852 --> 01:32:04,003
...when a guy that I'm following,
it turns out he's following me!

1606
01:32:04,092 --> 01:32:05,081
(Knock on door)

1607
01:32:05,172 --> 01:32:07,527
Don't let nobody in.
I figures I'll outsmart him.

1608
01:32:07,612 --> 01:32:09,364
PAT: There's a vacant house on the corner.

1609
01:32:09,452 --> 01:32:11,090
Johnny, the cops!

1610
01:32:11,172 --> 01:32:13,891
PAT: I sees the door handle turn,
so I pulls out my gun...

1611
01:32:13,972 --> 01:32:16,327
...braces myself against the wall and I says:

1612
01:32:16,412 --> 01:32:17,401
"Come in! "

1613
01:32:21,372 --> 01:32:22,771
Hello, boys.

1614
01:32:23,212 --> 01:32:26,807
-What the Sam Hill's going on?
-Sarge, this is Mortimer Brewster.

1615
01:32:26,892 --> 01:32:30,089
-He's going to help me write my play.
-Do you have to tie him up?

1616
01:32:30,172 --> 01:32:32,049
BROPHY: Report in.
Why didn't you ring in?

1617
01:32:32,132 --> 01:32:34,202
The whole force is out looking for you.

1618
01:32:34,292 --> 01:32:37,284
Right in the middle of the second act.
Did they send you here?

1619
01:32:37,372 --> 01:32:39,124
No, we came to warn the old ladies.

1620
01:32:39,212 --> 01:32:40,725
The colonel blew that bugle again.

1621
01:32:40,812 --> 01:32:41,961
PAT: I heard him.

1622
01:32:42,052 --> 01:32:45,089
BROPHY: Neighbors are phoning in.
The Lieutenant's on the warpath.

1623
01:32:45,172 --> 01:32:47,447
He says we've got
to put him away someplace.

1624
01:32:47,572 --> 01:32:49,051
Now, who the heck is this?

1625
01:32:49,132 --> 01:32:51,805
Mr. Brewster's brother.
My play put him to sleep.

1626
01:32:51,892 --> 01:32:54,804
That's the one that ran away.
So he came back.

1627
01:32:55,052 --> 01:32:56,531
Brophy. Get me Mac.

1628
01:32:56,692 --> 01:33:00,128
Have you got yourself in a mess!
You're two hours overdue at the station.

1629
01:33:00,412 --> 01:33:02,607
I better let them know that I found you.

1630
01:33:02,692 --> 01:33:04,410
PAT: It wasn't that bad, was it?

1631
01:33:05,692 --> 01:33:09,571
Tell the Lieutenant he can call off
the big manhunt. We found him.

1632
01:33:09,852 --> 01:33:12,241
At the Brewster house.

1633
01:33:12,332 --> 01:33:14,448
Shall we bring him in?

1634
01:33:14,652 --> 01:33:16,882
All right, we'll hold him right here.

1635
01:33:18,532 --> 01:33:21,000
The Lieutenant is on his way over.

1636
01:33:21,412 --> 01:33:23,926
So I've been turned in?

1637
01:33:24,492 --> 01:33:27,052
All right, you've got me.

1638
01:33:27,892 --> 01:33:31,931
I suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother
will split the reward.

1639
01:33:32,052 --> 01:33:33,167
Yes, reward!

1640
01:33:33,252 --> 01:33:35,083
JONATHAN: Now I'll do some turning in!

1641
01:33:35,212 --> 01:33:36,804
PAT: Wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.

1642
01:33:36,892 --> 01:33:40,282
You think my aunts are sweet,
charming old ladies, don't you?

1643
01:33:40,372 --> 01:33:43,523
Well, there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar!

1644
01:33:44,012 --> 01:33:44,967
Yes, 13.

1645
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:47,805
BROPHY: Careful what you say.
Your aunts are our friends.

1646
01:33:47,892 --> 01:33:50,804
JONATHAN: I'll show them to you.
BROPHY: Don't make trouble!

1647
01:33:50,892 --> 01:33:53,122
Never mind, Mr. Brewster.
Leave him to me.

1648
01:33:53,212 --> 01:33:55,680
JONATHAN: Come down to the cellar.
PAT: Wait a minute.

1649
01:33:55,772 --> 01:33:58,332
Thirteen bodies.
I'll show you where they're buried.

1650
01:33:58,932 --> 01:34:01,366
-Go to the cellar with him.
-Yes, come to the cellar.

1651
01:34:01,452 --> 01:34:03,090
PAT: Well, look, do I have to?

1652
01:34:04,212 --> 01:34:06,442
Maybe I don't want to go down
to the cellar.

1653
01:34:06,532 --> 01:34:08,568
Go on down the cellar with him!

1654
01:34:08,652 --> 01:34:11,883
Now, please. I'll tell you
the rest of my play later.

1655
01:34:12,052 --> 01:34:13,929
BROPHY: Go on down the cellar with him.

1656
01:34:14,012 --> 01:34:15,081
Do I have to?

1657
01:34:15,212 --> 01:34:17,680
Look at that puss.
He looks like Boris Karloff.

1658
01:34:17,772 --> 01:34:18,966
PAT: Don't! Sarge!

1659
01:34:25,572 --> 01:34:26,891
BROPHY: Look out, Pat!

1660
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:33,882
BROPHY: Look out!
SAUNDERS: He's got a gun.

1661
01:34:34,492 --> 01:34:36,767
BROPHY: I got him, Pat. Look out!

1662
01:34:37,132 --> 01:34:39,009
Fight. Go on and fight.

1663
01:34:43,532 --> 01:34:46,410
That's enough, that's enough.
Everybody off.

1664
01:34:49,412 --> 01:34:50,686
BROPHY: Pat, look out!

1665
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:51,887
Amazing.

1666
01:34:51,972 --> 01:34:55,442
(Crashing and fighting)

1667
01:34:57,492 --> 01:34:59,801
Such a fine day, too.

1668
01:34:59,892 --> 01:35:03,726
All I did was cross the bridge
and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing.

1669
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:10,611
Don't bother me now.

1670
01:35:10,692 --> 01:35:12,648
You could use this in the third act.

1671
01:35:12,732 --> 01:35:15,200
PAT: I got something better.
Let me tell you--

1672
01:35:15,852 --> 01:35:17,251
I'll see you later.

1673
01:35:20,772 --> 01:35:23,570
The papers are all signed. What do I care?

1674
01:35:23,892 --> 01:35:25,371
Go ahead, fight.

1675
01:35:31,732 --> 01:35:34,485
I'd better call and see
if Witherspoon has left.

1676
01:35:35,492 --> 01:35:36,561
Telephone.

1677
01:35:37,652 --> 01:35:39,210
I'll get every one of you!

1678
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:42,284
I hate cops. I'll brain the first one
that comes near me!

1679
01:35:42,372 --> 01:35:45,409
A little higher, brother.
Thank you very much. That's fine.

1680
01:35:46,052 --> 01:35:47,405
Don't do that, please.

1681
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:48,686
Get him, Pat.

1682
01:35:49,132 --> 01:35:51,771
That won't have any effect.
I've tried it before--

1683
01:35:51,852 --> 01:35:53,126
It did. Isn't that amazing?

1684
01:35:55,572 --> 01:35:58,291
Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.

1685
01:35:58,452 --> 01:35:59,441
(Doorbell rings)

1686
01:36:00,012 --> 01:36:01,968
MORTIMER: Witherspoon.
BROPHY: Come in.

1687
01:36:15,492 --> 01:36:17,130
What has occurred?

1688
01:36:17,212 --> 01:36:19,806
Never mind!
Didn't I tell you I'd handle this?

1689
01:36:20,052 --> 01:36:21,280
Well, Lieutenant!

1690
01:36:21,372 --> 01:36:24,967
-We were just acting in self-defense.
-What happened? He put up a fight?

1691
01:36:25,052 --> 01:36:27,282
This isn't the one who blows the bugle.

1692
01:36:27,372 --> 01:36:31,809
-This is his brother who tried to kill O'Hara.
-All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.

1693
01:36:31,892 --> 01:36:33,769
Boris.... Turn him over.

1694
01:36:37,452 --> 01:36:39,807
Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.

1695
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:42,560
You "kind of think
he's wanted somewhere"?

1696
01:36:42,812 --> 01:36:45,849
If you guys can't look
at the circulars we put up...

1697
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,401
...you can at least read
short detective stories.

1698
01:36:48,492 --> 01:36:50,483
Certainly, he's wanted. In lndiana!

1699
01:36:50,572 --> 01:36:53,882
He escaped from the prison
for criminally insane. He's a lifer.

1700
01:36:53,972 --> 01:36:55,166
That's my brother.

1701
01:36:55,252 --> 01:36:59,086
That's the way they described him.
"He looked like Karloff."

1702
01:36:59,572 --> 01:37:00,925
Why'd you knock him out?

1703
01:37:01,012 --> 01:37:04,243
He tried to get us to go to the cellar.
He says 13 bodies are there.

1704
01:37:04,332 --> 01:37:05,765
Thirteen bodies in the cellar...

1705
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:08,844
...and that don't tip you off
the guy's from a nuthouse?

1706
01:37:08,932 --> 01:37:10,081
Thanks, pal.

1707
01:37:10,212 --> 01:37:12,203
PAT: About my not ringing in, I want to--

1708
01:37:12,292 --> 01:37:14,522
Where have you been all night?
Don't tell me.

1709
01:37:14,612 --> 01:37:18,002
I was right here writing a play
with Mortimer Brewster.

1710
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:20,851
You're going to have
a long time on that play.

1711
01:37:21,012 --> 01:37:22,445
You're suspended.

1712
01:37:22,532 --> 01:37:24,170
Now go on. Report in.

1713
01:37:24,252 --> 01:37:27,244
Bring him to and find out
where his accomplice is.

1714
01:37:27,332 --> 01:37:29,721
The guy who helped him escape.
He's wanted, too.

1715
01:37:29,812 --> 01:37:30,801
Here.

1716
01:37:30,892 --> 01:37:34,726
ROONEY: I've been after these guys
for 48 hours. Nothing to eat. No sleep.

1717
01:37:34,812 --> 01:37:36,689
No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in.

1718
01:37:36,772 --> 01:37:39,969
With flatheads like you on the force.
Falling for a story like that!

1719
01:37:40,052 --> 01:37:41,883
Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar.

1720
01:37:42,052 --> 01:37:44,327
But there are 13 bodies in the cellar!

1721
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:47,760
-Who are you?
-I'm President Roosevelt.

1722
01:37:49,452 --> 01:37:52,922
-(Whispers) What the blazes is this?
-He's the one that blows the bugle.

1723
01:37:53,212 --> 01:37:54,725
Howdy, Colonel.

1724
01:37:58,292 --> 01:38:01,648
Colonel, you've blown your last bugle.
Get this guy out of here.

1725
01:38:01,852 --> 01:38:04,127
Dear me! Another yellow-fever victim?

1726
01:38:04,572 --> 01:38:07,086
All the bodies in the cellar
are yellow-fever victims.

1727
01:38:07,172 --> 01:38:10,448
No, Colonel. This is a spy.
We caught him at the White House.

1728
01:38:10,532 --> 01:38:13,000
Take him out and bring him to.
I want to question him.

1729
01:38:13,092 --> 01:38:16,607
-Questioning of spies is my department.
-Hey, you, keep out of that.

1730
01:38:16,932 --> 01:38:20,845
You're forgetting that as President
I am also head of the Secret Service.

1731
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:30,091
MORTIMER: No, no, no.

1732
01:38:30,612 --> 01:38:31,931
ROONEY: Who are you?

1733
01:38:32,452 --> 01:38:33,601
What's your name?

1734
01:38:33,692 --> 01:38:36,490
Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster.
But I'm not myself today.

1735
01:38:36,572 --> 01:38:40,451
You're his brother. Look, no argument.
He's got to be put away.

1736
01:38:40,572 --> 01:38:45,088
No arguments, Captain. No arguments.
Just a minute, take it easy. Read this.

1737
01:38:45,172 --> 01:38:47,049
Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight.

1738
01:38:47,132 --> 01:38:50,329
-I'm waiting for Mr. Witherspoon.
-As long as he's going someplace.

1739
01:38:50,412 --> 01:38:52,528
He's scaring the neighbors with that bugle.

1740
01:38:52,612 --> 01:38:55,922
And that cockeyed story
about 13 bodies being--

1741
01:39:04,212 --> 01:39:07,488
I've been without sleep for 48 hours.
I'm liable to think anything.

1742
01:39:07,572 --> 01:39:09,483
I know just how you feel.

1743
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:11,802
There's people dumb enough
to believe that.

1744
01:39:11,892 --> 01:39:14,964
Last year there was a crazy guy,
started a murder rumor.

1745
01:39:15,092 --> 01:39:17,652
I had to dig up a half acre plot
before I could prove--

1746
01:39:17,732 --> 01:39:19,609
-What's this?
-What's the matter?

1747
01:39:19,692 --> 01:39:21,410
-These papers aren't any good.
-Why not?

1748
01:39:21,492 --> 01:39:23,960
He signed it Theodore Roosevelt!

1749
01:39:28,772 --> 01:39:32,003
-Is your taxi engaged?
-Losing dough every minute. Any offers?

1750
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:36,125
I'm Mr. Witherspoon of Happy Dale
Sanitarium, I have come to get a Brewster.

1751
01:39:36,212 --> 01:39:39,249
I would like you to drive us back
to the sanitarium.

1752
01:39:40,492 --> 01:39:43,086
I knew this would end up in a nuthouse!

1753
01:39:44,532 --> 01:39:47,569
We like to think of it as a rest home.

1754
01:39:50,852 --> 01:39:52,843
(Overlapping background conversation)

1755
01:39:58,052 --> 01:39:59,770
MR. WITHERSPOON: Mr. Brewster?

1756
01:40:02,732 --> 01:40:04,882
MR. WITHERSPOON:
Mr. Witherspoon is here.

1757
01:40:08,132 --> 01:40:11,920
Supposing the spy steals this document
and finds the name Roosevelt on it.

1758
01:40:12,052 --> 01:40:15,010
Think what that would mean
to the safety of the nation!

1759
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,560
-No, it's chicanery.
-What is this? Come on!

1760
01:40:17,652 --> 01:40:20,769
-He's come to. He's ready to talk.
-Hold him till I get there.

1761
01:40:20,852 --> 01:40:24,367
Let me explain. The name Brewster
is code for Roosevelt.

1762
01:40:24,772 --> 01:40:26,967
-Code for Roosevelt?
-Take the name Brewster.

1763
01:40:27,052 --> 01:40:29,122
Take away the "B" and what have you got?

1764
01:40:29,212 --> 01:40:31,487
-Rooster.
-And what does a rooster do?

1765
01:40:31,572 --> 01:40:34,882
-Crows.
-It crows! Where do you hunt in Africa?

1766
01:40:35,052 --> 01:40:37,247
-On the veldt!
-There you are! "Crowsveldt."

1767
01:40:37,332 --> 01:40:40,529
Ingenious! My compliments
to the boys in the code department.

1768
01:40:40,612 --> 01:40:42,682
That's all right! Do that again for me.

1769
01:40:42,772 --> 01:40:45,286
Never mind! Give me that pen.

1770
01:40:46,052 --> 01:40:47,565
This is fun.

1771
01:40:47,932 --> 01:40:50,241
Now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.

1772
01:40:56,812 --> 01:40:58,564
I'm so glad to see you.

1773
01:40:58,692 --> 01:41:00,364
Mr. Witherspoon, before....

1774
01:41:00,492 --> 01:41:02,289
You will take good care of Teddy?

1775
01:41:02,372 --> 01:41:04,647
-Best of care of him.
-That's fine.

1776
01:41:04,772 --> 01:41:06,524
And no wagon when he leaves.

1777
01:41:06,612 --> 01:41:08,648
Why? To take him away? Never, never.

1778
01:41:08,732 --> 01:41:11,451
Taxicabs. We always....
I have one waiting now.

1779
01:41:11,572 --> 01:41:13,085
It means a great deal to me.

1780
01:41:13,172 --> 01:41:16,130
You will personally see
that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale?

1781
01:41:16,212 --> 01:41:18,567
-He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.
-That's good.

1782
01:41:18,652 --> 01:41:21,644
You know, I sometimes envy
some of our patients, secretly.

1783
01:41:21,732 --> 01:41:24,849
You do? It must be a nice place.
I've never been there.

1784
01:41:24,932 --> 01:41:26,843
You never can tell.

1785
01:41:27,212 --> 01:41:30,090
This is a particularly happy moment
for me tonight.

1786
01:41:30,172 --> 01:41:33,960
-I've never met a dramatic critic before.
-The woods are full of them.

1787
01:41:34,052 --> 01:41:37,488
I have here something that will explain
what we're trying to do.

1788
01:41:37,572 --> 01:41:40,962
-A pamphlet about Happy Dale?
-No, it's a play.

1789
01:41:41,092 --> 01:41:42,764
Something I've been working on.

1790
01:41:42,852 --> 01:41:46,447
It's a dramatization of many incidents
that have happened at Happy Dale.

1791
01:41:46,532 --> 01:41:48,124
MORTIMER: Captain! Captain!

1792
01:41:49,412 --> 01:41:53,769
I want you to read this carefully.
I want you to be just as harsh as you like.

1793
01:41:53,852 --> 01:41:55,205
I shan't mind, you know--

1794
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:57,601
Captain, this is Mr. Witherspoon.

1795
01:41:58,052 --> 01:41:59,531
Oh, yes, yes.

1796
01:42:00,132 --> 01:42:02,009
He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.

1797
01:42:02,092 --> 01:42:04,003
-Come, my boy.
-What is this?

1798
01:42:05,492 --> 01:42:08,723
No, you got it wrong.
This is Captain Rooney.

1799
01:42:08,932 --> 01:42:10,524
The police?

1800
01:42:11,892 --> 01:42:15,805
I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed.
Now you can take him away.

1801
01:42:15,892 --> 01:42:18,008
I'll be in my office vetoing some bills.

1802
01:42:18,092 --> 01:42:20,367
MORTIMER: Mr. President,
I have good news for you.

1803
01:42:20,452 --> 01:42:22,761
Your term of office is over.

1804
01:42:23,612 --> 01:42:26,046
-Is this March 4?
-Practically.

1805
01:42:26,132 --> 01:42:27,406
Let's see....

1806
01:42:29,612 --> 01:42:31,842
Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa!

1807
01:42:31,972 --> 01:42:34,532
Well, I must get started immediately.

1808
01:42:40,492 --> 01:42:43,609
Is he trying to move into the White House
before I've moved out?

1809
01:42:43,692 --> 01:42:45,444
Who, Mr. President?

1810
01:42:45,532 --> 01:42:46,362
Taft!

1811
01:42:49,492 --> 01:42:54,361
No, this isn't Mr. Taft.
It's Mr. Witherspoon, your guide to Africa.

1812
01:42:54,692 --> 01:42:56,091
Bully! Bully!

1813
01:42:56,252 --> 01:42:58,766
Wait right here.
I'll bring down my equipment.

1814
01:42:58,852 --> 01:42:59,887
Happy man.

1815
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:02,123
Goodbye, Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha.

1816
01:43:02,212 --> 01:43:04,885
I'm on my way to Africa.
Isn't it wonderful?

1817
01:43:04,972 --> 01:43:06,007
Charge!

1818
01:43:08,452 --> 01:43:10,488
MORTIMER: It's all right, I've got it.

1819
01:43:11,532 --> 01:43:12,442
Oh, dear.

1820
01:43:12,932 --> 01:43:15,810
And Happy Dale is full of staircases.

1821
01:43:20,692 --> 01:43:23,331
You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you?

1822
01:43:23,412 --> 01:43:27,087
ROONEY: No, he's come to take him.
Teddy's been blowing his bugle again.

1823
01:43:27,172 --> 01:43:30,323
No, he can't go now! We won't permit it.

1824
01:43:30,452 --> 01:43:32,841
We promise to take his bugle
away from him.

1825
01:43:32,932 --> 01:43:36,163
-We won't be separated from Teddy.
-I'm sorry.

1826
01:43:36,572 --> 01:43:37,561
Mortimer....

1827
01:43:37,692 --> 01:43:39,808
How can you allow this? You promised.

1828
01:43:39,892 --> 01:43:43,089
Brewster's got nothing to do with this.
The law is the law!

1829
01:43:43,212 --> 01:43:45,726
Teddy's committed himself
and he's got to go.

1830
01:43:46,572 --> 01:43:51,566
ABBY: lf he's going, we're going, too!
MARTHA: You'll have to take us with him.

1831
01:43:52,452 --> 01:43:54,602
Why not? Why not, indeed?

1832
01:43:55,252 --> 01:43:57,891
MR. WITHERSPOON: It's sweet of them,
but impossible.

1833
01:43:58,092 --> 01:44:00,128
We never take sane people at Happy Dale.

1834
01:44:01,452 --> 01:44:02,851
Oh, no...no.

1835
01:44:04,372 --> 01:44:08,524
These little sane people will get lost
in the shuffle. You could arrange that.

1836
01:44:08,612 --> 01:44:11,490
Just put them in
and they'll get all mixed up.

1837
01:44:11,732 --> 01:44:14,007
Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy.

1838
01:44:17,092 --> 01:44:19,401
ROONEY: Now, let's be sensible, ladies.

1839
01:44:19,532 --> 01:44:22,763
Here I am wasting my time
when I could be doing some serious work.

1840
01:44:22,852 --> 01:44:25,241
There are still murders
to be solved in Brooklyn.

1841
01:44:25,332 --> 01:44:28,483
It ain't only his bugle blowing.
Things are going to get worse.

1842
01:44:28,572 --> 01:44:31,211
We're liable to have to dig up your cellar.

1843
01:44:31,292 --> 01:44:32,566
Our cellar?

1844
01:44:33,772 --> 01:44:37,287
Teddy's been telling around
there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar.

1845
01:44:37,372 --> 01:44:39,727
There are 13 bodies in our cellar.

1846
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:46,208
What?

1847
01:44:46,292 --> 01:44:49,648
Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.

1848
01:44:54,652 --> 01:44:55,641
Charge!

1849
01:45:01,812 --> 01:45:03,245
Isn't that amazing?

1850
01:45:04,452 --> 01:45:05,965
ABBY: You behave yourself.

1851
01:45:06,052 --> 01:45:09,124
You know very well there are
13 bodies down in our cellar.

1852
01:45:09,212 --> 01:45:11,362
Certainly there's 13 bodies in the cellar.

1853
01:45:11,452 --> 01:45:15,161
And there are hundreds more
up in the attic, Captain!

1854
01:45:19,372 --> 01:45:21,602
-What is this?
-You mustn't mind Mortimer.

1855
01:45:21,692 --> 01:45:23,603
-How about it?
-I'll be right there.

1856
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:25,523
He's been a little strange all day.

1857
01:45:25,612 --> 01:45:29,241
Right now I wouldn't know what is
and what ain't strange anymore.

1858
01:45:29,332 --> 01:45:32,210
-I'll look in that cellar.
-I'll tell you what we'll do.

1859
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:35,682
I'll bring my bodies from the attic
and you get yours from the cellar...

1860
01:45:35,772 --> 01:45:40,482
...and we'll get them all together,
and we'll send them to Happy Dale.

1861
01:45:42,372 --> 01:45:46,001
ABBY: No, you wouldn't have to dig.
The graves are all marked.

1862
01:45:46,412 --> 01:45:49,324
-We put flowers on them every Sunday.
-Flowers?

1863
01:45:49,412 --> 01:45:51,926
Sure, I put neon lights on mine.

1864
01:45:53,692 --> 01:45:55,330
Humor them, humor them.

1865
01:45:56,052 --> 01:45:57,007
Smile.

1866
01:45:59,412 --> 01:46:01,687
There's one down there, a Mr. Spenalzo...

1867
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:02,921
Hasn't got it yet.

1868
01:46:03,012 --> 01:46:05,287
...who doesn't belong here
and has to leave.

1869
01:46:05,372 --> 01:46:09,126
-But the other 12 are our gentlemen.
-Your gentlemen?

1870
01:46:09,212 --> 01:46:12,090
You'd like mine better.
None of mine are gentlemen.

1871
01:46:13,252 --> 01:46:15,766
-You mustn't mind him at all.
-He got married today.

1872
01:46:15,852 --> 01:46:19,162
(Sings) "There is a Happy Dale far, far away

1873
01:46:19,252 --> 01:46:21,208
"There is a Happy"

1874
01:46:22,052 --> 01:46:23,531
Yeah, yeah.

1875
01:46:25,372 --> 01:46:27,328
He got it. It's amazing.

1876
01:46:27,932 --> 01:46:30,366
Don't you think you can find room
for the ladies?

1877
01:46:30,452 --> 01:46:31,805
Just the ladies?

1878
01:46:33,372 --> 01:46:35,090
Just the ladies!

1879
01:46:36,012 --> 01:46:38,526
-How about it?
-They'd have to be committed.

1880
01:46:38,812 --> 01:46:42,600
Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they?
All they have to do is sign the papers.

1881
01:46:42,692 --> 01:46:44,011
Certainly.

1882
01:46:44,092 --> 01:46:47,129
If we can go with Teddy,
we'll sign the papers.

1883
01:46:47,212 --> 01:46:48,201
Where are they?

1884
01:46:48,292 --> 01:46:50,601
MR. WITHERSPOON: I have them, ladies,
right here.

1885
01:46:50,692 --> 01:46:53,684
Sign them up, will you?
I want this all cleaned up.

1886
01:46:53,812 --> 01:46:57,282
I'm going out to talk to that spy.
Maybe I can understand him.

1887
01:46:57,372 --> 01:46:59,044
Thirteen bodies in the cellar.

1888
01:46:59,132 --> 01:47:01,362
MR. WITHERSPOON: Ladies,
if you'll sign right here.

1889
01:47:12,052 --> 01:47:13,451
ABBY: Here?
MR. WITHERSPOON: Yes.

1890
01:47:13,532 --> 01:47:15,807
MR. WITHERSPOON:
It's on the right-hand side there.

1891
01:47:15,892 --> 01:47:18,122
I'm really looking forward to going.

1892
01:47:18,212 --> 01:47:20,521
The neighborhood here has changed so.

1893
01:47:20,652 --> 01:47:23,803
Yes. Especially since they won
that old pennant thing.

1894
01:47:26,772 --> 01:47:29,332
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.
We've overlooked something.

1895
01:47:29,412 --> 01:47:32,848
It's absolutely compulsory that we have
the signature of a physician.

1896
01:47:32,932 --> 01:47:34,047
MORTIMER: A doctor.

1897
01:47:34,172 --> 01:47:36,732
Dr. Einstein! Come here
and sign some papers, please.

1898
01:47:36,812 --> 01:47:38,803
DR. EINSTEIN: Good night.
MORTIMER: Come here.

1899
01:47:38,892 --> 01:47:40,086
-A doctor?
-Yes.

1900
01:47:40,212 --> 01:47:43,761
Dr. Einstein almost operated on me earlier.
Come along, Doctor.

1901
01:47:45,852 --> 01:47:48,286
Now, here. Just sign right here,
please, Doctor.

1902
01:47:48,372 --> 01:47:51,284
ABBY: Were you leaving, Doctor?
DR. EINSTEIN: Yes, please.

1903
01:47:51,372 --> 01:47:53,966
Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan?

1904
01:47:54,092 --> 01:47:56,890
I don't think we go to the same place.

1905
01:47:57,092 --> 01:48:00,562
ROONEY: Hello, Mac. We picked up
that guy that's wanted in lndiana.

1906
01:48:00,652 --> 01:48:03,644
His accomplice's description is
on the circular, on the desk.

1907
01:48:03,732 --> 01:48:04,767
Read it to me, will you?

1908
01:48:07,252 --> 01:48:08,446
About 40.

1909
01:48:08,932 --> 01:48:10,411
Five-foot-three.

1910
01:48:10,732 --> 01:48:12,245
One hundred and forty pounds.

1911
01:48:12,892 --> 01:48:14,166
Pop eyes.

1912
01:48:15,652 --> 01:48:17,643
Talks with a German accent.

1913
01:48:17,972 --> 01:48:19,405
Poses as a doctor.

1914
01:48:19,612 --> 01:48:21,091
Okay, Mac. Thanks.

1915
01:48:21,212 --> 01:48:24,363
It's all right. The doctor
has completed the signatures.

1916
01:48:24,492 --> 01:48:25,686
That's great!

1917
01:48:25,852 --> 01:48:29,242
Thanks, Doc.
You've done Brooklyn a great service.

1918
01:48:34,212 --> 01:48:36,009
ABBY: But Dr. Einstein!

1919
01:48:39,332 --> 01:48:42,642
-Now, Mr. Witherspoon--
-You're Witherspoon, I'm Brewster.

1920
01:48:42,772 --> 01:48:45,366
It's contagious, yes. It's your turn.

1921
01:48:45,732 --> 01:48:47,768
-Don't play games--
-You sign.

1922
01:48:47,892 --> 01:48:49,928
You sign as next of kin.

1923
01:48:50,292 --> 01:48:53,682
Why didn't you say so?
I'm all confused. Don't mind me.

1924
01:48:55,532 --> 01:48:56,806
Mr. Witherport.

1925
01:48:57,252 --> 01:48:59,083
-Spoon.
-Here.

1926
01:48:59,692 --> 01:49:01,011
Come up and pack my duffel.

1927
01:49:03,292 --> 01:49:04,441
Duffel?

1928
01:49:04,532 --> 01:49:07,092
Pack his duffel. He's President, you know?

1929
01:49:07,452 --> 01:49:09,363
TEDDY: And bring along my bugle.

1930
01:49:11,132 --> 01:49:12,247
President.

1931
01:49:21,172 --> 01:49:22,491
Don't charge!

1932
01:49:32,052 --> 01:49:33,531
Mortimer?

1933
01:49:35,172 --> 01:49:38,130
We're really very worried about something.

1934
01:49:38,892 --> 01:49:41,486
Now, darling, don't be worried.

1935
01:49:41,972 --> 01:49:45,044
-Me too, Mortimer.
-Well, of course, darling.

1936
01:49:45,892 --> 01:49:47,883
You'll both be very happy at Happy Dale.

1937
01:49:47,972 --> 01:49:52,170
We're very happy about the whole thing,
but that's just it.

1938
01:49:52,492 --> 01:49:54,642
We don't want anything to go wrong.

1939
01:49:56,492 --> 01:49:59,165
Will they investigate those signatures?

1940
01:50:00,172 --> 01:50:03,960
-They won't look up Dr. Einstein--
-But it's not his signature, dear.

1941
01:50:04,092 --> 01:50:05,923
-It's yours.
-Mine?

1942
01:50:06,012 --> 01:50:09,129
You see, you signed as next of kin.

1943
01:50:09,412 --> 01:50:13,451
-What's wrong about that, darling?
-Martha, you tell him.

1944
01:50:15,492 --> 01:50:16,766
Well, dear.

1945
01:50:16,852 --> 01:50:20,606
-What, dear?
-You're not really a Brewster.

1946
01:50:21,932 --> 01:50:24,366
-What?
-Your mother came to us as a cook.

1947
01:50:24,492 --> 01:50:26,722
And you were born
about three months afterwards.

1948
01:50:26,812 --> 01:50:29,645
And she was such a sweet woman
and such a good cook...

1949
01:50:29,732 --> 01:50:33,168
...we didn't want to lose her.
So brother married her.

1950
01:50:33,412 --> 01:50:35,403
Your real father was a cook, too.

1951
01:50:35,532 --> 01:50:38,569
He was a chef on a tramp steamer.

1952
01:50:40,652 --> 01:50:41,641
You mean....

1953
01:50:41,812 --> 01:50:44,963
You mean I'm not really a Brewster?

1954
01:50:46,892 --> 01:50:49,406
-Darling!
-Don't feel so badly about it.

1955
01:50:49,532 --> 01:50:52,524
I'm sure it won't make any difference
to Elaine.

1956
01:50:53,852 --> 01:50:55,843
(Mortimer squeals)

1957
01:50:59,852 --> 01:51:01,126
MORTIMER: (Shouts) Elaine!

1958
01:51:01,212 --> 01:51:04,170
Where are you? Can you hear me?
I'm not really a Brewster!

1959
01:51:04,252 --> 01:51:06,049
I'm the son of a sea cook!

1960
01:51:06,692 --> 01:51:07,681
(Elaine screams)

1961
01:51:09,852 --> 01:51:11,444
ELAINE: Mortimer!

1962
01:51:12,252 --> 01:51:14,368
It's true! I saw them. It's true.

1963
01:51:14,492 --> 01:51:17,006
It's true! There are 13 bodies down there!

1964
01:51:17,172 --> 01:51:18,844
But I saw them--

1965
01:51:20,372 --> 01:51:21,885
What's all this screaming about?

1966
01:51:21,972 --> 01:51:25,009
-But I saw them--
-It's way past her bedtime.

1967
01:51:26,492 --> 01:51:27,607
MORTIMER: Quiet!

1968
01:51:31,052 --> 01:51:33,168
ELAINE: But, Mortimer--
MORTIMER: Goodbye!

1969
01:51:33,252 --> 01:51:35,482
ABBY: 'Bye.
MARTHA: Goodbye, darling!

1970
01:51:37,532 --> 01:51:40,649
-What is all this?
-They're going on their honeymoon.

1971
01:51:41,052 --> 01:51:43,008
They're off to a flying start.

1972
01:51:49,292 --> 01:51:50,691
ELAINE: I really did see--

1973
01:51:51,292 --> 01:51:53,328
You'll own two cabs!

1974
01:51:54,012 --> 01:51:56,128
I mean the meter!

1975
01:51:56,452 --> 01:51:57,965
ELAINE: Oh, Mortimer.

1976
01:52:04,652 --> 01:52:06,449
(lmitates Elaine) Oh, Mortimer.

1977
01:52:08,492 --> 01:52:10,881
We're going to Niagara Falls.
Call me a cab, dear.

1978
