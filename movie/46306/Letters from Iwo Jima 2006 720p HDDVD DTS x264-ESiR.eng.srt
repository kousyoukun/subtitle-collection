00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:55,248
Letters From Iwo Jima

2
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:08,490
IWO JIMA

3
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:20,051
How did those soldiers ever manage
to dig out these tunnels?

4
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:22,248
Let's get a rotation in here.

5
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:24,212
Hey, I found something!

6
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:38,454
IWO JIMA

7
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:39,684
<i>Hanako...</i>

8
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,446
<i>We soldiers dig.</i>

9
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:45,495
<i>We dig all day.</i>

10
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:49,406
<i>This is the hole that we will fight...</i>

11
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:51,847
<i>and die in.</i>

12
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:55,494
<i>Hanako...</i>

13
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:59,132
<i>am I digging my own grave?</i>

14
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:34,885
<i>Today, I head for the post</i>
<i>where my men await.</i>

15
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:39,774
<i>I am determined to serve</i>
<i>and give my life for my country.</i>

16
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:43,289
<i>I believe I have organized</i>
<i>everything at home...</i>

17
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:47,892
<i>but I am sorry I wasn 't able to attend</i>
<i>to the kitchen floor before I left.</i>

18
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:50,253
<i>I had all the intention...</i>

19
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:52,645
<i>but had to leave</i>
<i>without having the time...</i>

20
00:03:53,055 --> 00:03:55,046
<i>and I am still worried about it.</i>

21
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:58,287
<i>So make sure to have</i>
<i>Taro take care of it promptly.</i>

22
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:07,923
Damn this island!
The Americans can have it.

23
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:11,569
Nothing grows here.

24
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:17,330
It smells. It's hot. There are too many
damn bugs, and there's no water.

25
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:23,164
This island is part
of Japan's sacred homeland.

26
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:25,446
There's nothing sacred about this island.

27
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:29,970
Saigo.

28
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,050
We should just give the island
to the Americans...

29
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:35,694
and then we can go home.

30
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:40,164
Saigo!

31
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:43,209
What did you say, soldier?

32
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:48,125
I said if we beat the Americans,
then we can go home.

33
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,291
You there, is that what he said?

34
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,890
Yes, sir.

35
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:15,370
I'm Kuribayashi.

36
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,135
Welcome, General.
I am Admiral Ohsugi.

37
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:20,725
How long have you been
waiting here for me?

38
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,134
Three hours, sir.

39
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:24,569
Sorry to hear that.

40
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,970
They wouldn't allow me
to wire my arrival...

41
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:29,126
after what happened
to Admiral Yamamoto.

42
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,444
I understand, sir.

43
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:32,492
This is my aide, Lieutenant Fujita.

44
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:35,484
What's the matter, Admiral?
You don't look very well.

45
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,892
It's nothing, sir. The water
doesn't agree with me here.

46
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:40,488
Sorry to hear that.

47
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,568
This way to your quarters.

48
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:45,323
Admiral, I want to make a round
of the island first.

49
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:47,491
Shall I fetch a vehicle?

50
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,532
No, let's walk.

51
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,053
Walking is good for the health.

52
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:54,285
It might be just what you need, Ohsugi.

53
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,247
So that's Suribachi.

54
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:20,970
You unpatriotic...

55
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:22,929
no-good peasants!

56
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,569
Hey, stop it!

57
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:29,210
Stand up!

58
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,494
What are you doing?

59
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:35,369
These soldiers...

60
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:40,006
were conspiring
with unpatriotic words, sir.

61
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:42,084
I see.

62
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,849
And, Captain, do you have
such an excess of soldiers...

63
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:47,529
that you could put two
of them out of commission?

64
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:49,564
No, sir.

65
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:52,013
Then stop beating them.

66
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,570
Deny their lunch rations instead.

67
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:58,644
A good captain uses his brain,
not just his whip.

68
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:05,087
What is all this?

69
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:06,844
All this?

70
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,363
Trenches, sir.

71
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,727
Why are the men digging trenches here?

72
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,974
This is where the Americans
are expected to land.

73
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,407
Have them stop immediately.

74
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,528
But, General...

75
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:21,284
And, Captain...

76
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:24,006
make sure these men get proper breaks.

77
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:26,690
They look like they're from Mars.

78
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:40,089
Stop digging!

79
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:58,129
Just as well.

80
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:02,014
My stomach has been
bothering me anyway.

81
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,291
A toast to General Kuribayashi...

82
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,527
a fine commander.

83
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,967
Better than sake!

84
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,447
I heard he lived in America.

85
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:19,970
Maybe that's why he
doesn't want us digging trenches.

86
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:21,773
Maybe he likes Americans.

87
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,451
No, stupid.
He studied the Americans.

88
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,128
So now he knows how to beat them.

89
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,493
I heard from someone in the 204th...

90
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:38,572
that another general was
supposed to command the island...

91
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:42,247
but he didn't want the job.

92
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:47,534
So Premier Tojo gave it
to Kuribayashi instead.

93
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:52,609
Nozaki, you hear a lot of things...

94
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,045
but your ears are full of wax!

95
00:09:57,655 --> 00:10:01,534
Anyway, you can't trust anyone
from the 204th.

96
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:03,492
They're part of the Navy.

97
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:06,693
I think this Kuribayashi
must be a superb general.

98
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:08,364
Look...

99
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:14,169
we're not digging those damn trenches
in the sand anymore, are we?

100
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,893
This heat is more than I had anticipated.

101
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:42,290
This island is bigger than I thought.
I'm exhausted.

102
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,730
Ito, reporting for duty.

103
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:52,851
Thank you for coming right away.

104
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:56,569
How much air force
do we have available?

105
00:10:56,735 --> 00:10:59,203
41 Zekes and 13 bombers, sir.

106
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,364
Is that all?

107
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,448
In order to support Saipan,
we lost 66 planes a few days ago.

108
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:09,847
We will have to rely on support
from the Combined Fleet then.

109
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:13,648
Is this the current defense plan?

110
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:21,933
And what about the Army troops?
Where will they be stationed?

111
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:26,452
I don't know exactly.

112
00:11:26,615 --> 00:11:29,368
They are under independent
command of Colonel Adachi.

113
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:31,810
You have not coordinated
your plans with the Army?

114
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:34,614
According to Navy rules,
until the enemy lands...

115
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,573
This is a real war!
You are aware of that, aren't you?

116
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:44,570
This will not work.

117
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:47,090
You are concentrating all
your efforts on the beaches.

118
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:50,567
- Move the artillery to higher ground.
- But, sir, we just had them...

119
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,248
moved down to the beaches.

120
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:53,814
Well, move them back.

121
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,563
Coordinate with the Army
and have them start immediately.

122
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:01,693
Fortifications at Suribachi are the priority.

123
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:03,363
I'm going to walk some more.

124
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:06,328
- It's pitch black out there, sir.
- I know.

125
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,328
This one is trouble.

126
00:12:20,215 --> 00:12:23,412
Army commanders usually are, sir.

127
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,694
Another letter?

128
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:08,853
You know that the mail only goes out
when there's a boat available?

129
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:10,648
I have a lot of family.

130
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:13,848
Then how come all your letters
are addressed to your wife?

131
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,490
Nosey!

132
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,253
Here, let me do you a favor.

133
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:21,812
Otherwise, your letters
will never make it through.

134
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,573
Hey, what are you doing?

135
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:28,285
I used to work at the censorship office
in Tokyo before I was transferred.

136
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,933
You mean demoted.

137
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:35,245
"To Hanako: We soldiers dig.
We dig all day."

138
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:38,015
No, no, no. This will never pass.

139
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,448
Give me that back!

140
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:54,093
There. You'll thank me
for this later, Saigo.

141
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:58,890
Next!

142
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,329
Good!

143
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:33,328
Are you blind?

144
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:36,533
Can't you see the target?

145
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:41,012
Even my six-year-old could
shoot better than you do.

146
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,284
Do it again!

147
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:52,451
You're an embarrassment!
You call yourself an Imperial soldier?

148
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:57,731
Tonight you will clean the boots
of your entire troop.

149
00:14:57,895 --> 00:14:58,930
Go to the rear!

150
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:04,805
They should learn to clean their guns
properly, rather than their boots.

151
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,687
What are those tanks doing here?

152
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:44,849
Those are out of commission, sir.
They are waiting for parts.

153
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:47,569
- For how long?
- About a month, sir.

154
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:09,846
<i>Taro, America is filled with cars.</i>

155
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:14,928
<i>I have to be very careful</i>
<i>when I cross the street...</i>

156
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:18,203
<i>there are so many cars everywhere.</i>

157
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:23,049
<i>Taro, are you behaving yourself</i>
<i>and listening to your mother?</i>

158
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,333
<i>I miss you.</i>

159
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:38,092
These civilians need to be
evacuated as soon as possible.

160
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:40,927
Yes, sir.

161
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:40,724
<i>Hanako...</i>

162
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:43,446
<i>we have a celebrity here.</i>

163
00:17:44,015 --> 00:17:47,212
<i>Baron Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist</i>
<i>in horse jumping.</i>

164
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,248
<i>He will lead the 26th tank regiment...</i>

165
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:54,648
<i>and has just arrived from Tokyo.</i>

166
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:13,008
<i>Nishi is very handsome, and there are</i>
<i>rumors of his womanizing skills.</i>

167
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:18,288
<i>But there are no women</i>
<i>left on the island to woo.</i>

168
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:46,487
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi!
You brought your horse.

169
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:48,170
From Chichi Jima.

170
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:56,006
I used to be a cavalryman myself,
you know.

171
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:58,166
Of course, I know.

172
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:01,691
I've been looking forward
to serving under you.

173
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:04,644
One who understands horses
the way I do.

174
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:08,808
When we used to ride horses
through the battlefield...

175
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:10,772
those were the good old days...

176
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:14,091
not like these mechanized contraptions.

177
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,491
I could send for another horse...

178
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,768
and we could ride together.

179
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,527
I'm afraid my riding days are over.

180
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:27,651
But tell me about this famous horse
of yours that you won the Olympics with.

181
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:29,769
My stallion, Uranus.

182
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:43,687
Oh, yes, this horse has a fine back.

183
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,012
I bought him in Italy.

184
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,726
They were happy to get rid of him.

185
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:54,534
He was such a wild horse.

186
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:59,613
No one could tame the beast,
but I told them...

187
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:01,606
such a headstrong horse...

188
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:05,246
is a perfect match for me.

189
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:12,015
Come dine with me tonight.
I feel like having a drink.

190
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:14,328
I think that can be arranged.

191
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,964
How did you manage to get
the Johnnie Walker?

192
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:28,287
I drank some already.

193
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,048
I'm sorry. This is all we have.

194
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,251
That's fine, as long as we have this.

195
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,127
What is this empty plate?

196
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:48,166
I have told our cook that all officers...

197
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:50,565
will have the same rations
and food as our men.

198
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:53,693
I'm sorry, but serving three dishes
is regulation.

199
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:58,244
Oh, but of course we have the right to be
served more than three dishes per meal.

200
00:20:58,415 --> 00:20:59,609
You're absolutely right.

201
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:12,047
When you think about it...

202
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:16,533
it is regrettable that most of the
Combined Fleet was destroyed.

203
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:19,727
We still have some battleships left...

204
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:24,685
but we have very little striking power
from the air or sea.

205
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:27,208
Nishi, what do you mean?

206
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:34,852
So you have not heard about
the Mariana battle?

207
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:40,685
Admiral Ozawa's carrier and boat planes
were destroyed.

208
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:44,494
The Imperial headquarters...

209
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:47,888
is deceiving not just the people,
but us as well.

210
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:50,934
If you want my honest opinion, General...

211
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:54,406
the best thing to do...

212
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:59,572
would be to sink the island
to the bottom of the sea.

213
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,732
And yet, you still came?

214
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:07,810
Well...

215
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:13,005
I figured your men were going to need
all the tanks that I could bring.

216
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:01,374
This must be it.

217
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:03,652
Yes, the enemy must land here.

218
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:09,930
Run!

219
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:12,493
Like you were one of the Americans!

220
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,526
Go on! Which direction would you take?

221
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:43,404
Hey...

222
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:46,486
I think your general has gone mad.

223
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,967
Look at the gun he has.

224
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,253
He probably took it
from a dead American.

225
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:01,688
Maybe.

226
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:10,729
Break time is over.

227
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:12,609
Back to work!

228
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:18,733
Are you all right, Kashiwara?

229
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:20,853
You look pale.

230
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:24,566
I'm fine. It's just the damn water.

231
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,884
But... I... really... need to go.

232
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,651
There will be a major change
in our strategy.

233
00:24:50,295 --> 00:24:54,846
We will dig caves in the Motoyama,
Higashiyama, and Suribachi-yama areas.

234
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:59,573
We will build these underground
fortifications, and fight to the end.

235
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:02,927
- What about the beach defenses, sir?
- Not needed.

236
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:07,884
But, sir, the beach trenches
are our first line of defense.

237
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:11,286
Without the beach trenches,
how do you expect us to win?

238
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:16,245
Hayashi, do you know how many cars
America produces in a year?

239
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,530
Five million.

240
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,933
The Americans' technological
advancements cannot be underestimated.

241
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:23,768
They will cross the beaches eventually.

242
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:27,684
If we waste our soldiers there,
there is no hope for victory.

243
00:25:27,855 --> 00:25:29,573
It is inevitable that men will die...

244
00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:33,252
but I never heard of an island operation
without beach fortifications.

245
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:36,885
General, it will be a futile waste of time
to start digging tunnels now.

246
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:38,613
We should force the enemy
near the island...

247
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:40,845
and launch a pincer drive
from the sea and air.

248
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:43,290
I agree. That makes the most sense.

249
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:44,530
Ohsugi...

250
00:25:45,535 --> 00:25:47,173
doesn't the Navy know?

251
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:54,411
The Combined Fleet has been completely
destroyed off the Marianas.

252
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:56,606
The island is now isolated.

253
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,484
What's more, I received a new order from
the Imperial headquarters this morning.

254
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,164
The remaining fighter planes
are to be sent back...

255
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:09,893
to Tokyo to defend the mainland.

256
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:12,967
Outrageous! How are we to fight?

257
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,329
We do not have time for discussion.
We should head back.

258
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:53,090
<i>Dear Mother...</i>

259
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,772
<i>I have been commissioned</i>
<i>to a new troop today.</i>

260
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:02,811
<i>I cannot talk about this transfer now.</i>

261
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,973
<i>Take good care of yourself.</i>

262
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:20,849
Look at this picture.

263
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,613
That's some fancy castle.

264
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,415
You know who this castle was built for?

265
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,933
Someone who was already dead.

266
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:36,329
They must have had
a lot of money back then...

267
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:38,851
to build a castle like that
for a dead person.

268
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:42,531
Why are you reading that book anyway?

269
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,689
We're never going to war over there.

270
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:49,767
We'll be lucky if we even get
a hole in the ground when we're dead.

271
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:52,406
Don't talk about that. It's bad luck.

272
00:27:57,855 --> 00:27:59,573
Is this the 312th?

273
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,248
That's right.

274
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:04,563
I'm Nozaki. This is Saigo.

275
00:28:07,095 --> 00:28:09,689
Shimizu, you can put your bedroll there.

276
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:15,772
There's an empty space in the back.

277
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:18,529
Don't mind him.

278
00:28:19,735 --> 00:28:23,045
His friend Kashiwara just died.

279
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:25,613
That used to be his spot.

280
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:34,806
But we are all going to die.

281
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:37,486
That's the plan, isn't it?

282
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:41,566
For our country, it is an honor.

283
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:45,970
Kashiwara died of honorable dysentery.

284
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,935
Shimizu, where are you from?

285
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:53,369
Kanagawa-ken.

286
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,971
Ozawa is from there, aren't you?

287
00:28:57,975 --> 00:28:59,249
That's right.

288
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:04,613
Where were you trained?

289
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:08,168
Maybe we were at the same school?

290
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:10,210
No.

291
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:12,965
I trained in Tokyo.

292
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,605
I trained in Tokyo, too. Where?

293
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:24,805
The <i>Koho Kimmu Yoin Yoseijo.</i>

294
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,323
Hey...

295
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,930
why do you think they put
a <i>Kempeitai</i> in our unit?

296
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:42,414
I don't know.

297
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:49,612
He's not wearing the white armband.
He's not <i>Kempeitai.</i>

298
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:53,405
He went to the <i>Kempeitai</i>
military academy.

299
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:56,332
Maybe he was kicked out.

300
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:01,965
He acts like a <i>Kempeitai.</i>

301
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,730
Look at his holster.
That's not standard issue.

302
00:30:10,815 --> 00:30:14,012
He's been put here to spy on us.

303
00:30:15,695 --> 00:30:18,084
Why would he spy on us?

304
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:23,325
Maybe it's those letters
you've been writing.

305
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,088
You should be careful.

306
00:30:52,655 --> 00:30:54,646
Weed soup again?

307
00:30:56,655 --> 00:31:00,011
Kuribayashi is conserving
our food supplies for the battle.

308
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:04,450
We'll be dead
before the Americans even get here.

309
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:09,207
And you would think that with all my
war effort contributions...

310
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:12,891
we should be eating <i>kasutera</i> cakes
or sandwiches.

311
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:15,370
What?

312
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:21,123
I ran a bakery in Ohmiya with my wife.

313
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:23,287
Back when we could still get sugar...

314
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:29,132
we sold <i>ampan</i> and <i>kasutera</i> cakes.

315
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:40,449
However, his <i>Kempeitai</i> brethren...

316
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:43,730
used to come and take
whatever they wanted.

317
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:48,613
For the war...

318
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,093
For the country...

319
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,968
Why bread?

320
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:04,089
We ran into those types
at our clothing store as well.

321
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:08,530
When we started making sandwiches...

322
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:12,091
they took those, too.

323
00:32:14,095 --> 00:32:17,531
And when we ran out of meat
and just had bread, they still came.

324
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:26,647
Eventually, they took all of our
baking equipment for the metal...

325
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:32,207
and we were out of business.

326
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:37,693
I should have been a fisherman.

327
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:43,051
It must have been hard on your wife...

328
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:48,249
without the shop
and without her husband.

329
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:24,363
Tell them to go away.
We have nothing to sell.

330
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,770
Congratulations! Your husband
is going to war.

331
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:49,613
Thank you very much.

332
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:53,930
I'm happy to serve the country.

333
00:33:57,855 --> 00:34:01,211
Prayers for your eternal success at arms.

334
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:06,053
I beg of you! We have only each other.

335
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:12,004
This is not the time.

336
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:18,446
We have all sent our husbands
and sons to war.

337
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:23,294
We all have to do our part.

338
00:34:26,975 --> 00:34:29,648
At least you'll have a little one
to carry on your name.

339
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:44,849
I can't eat with you like that.

340
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:51,853
What am I going to do after you die?

341
00:34:57,975 --> 00:35:00,125
I'm not in the coffin yet.

342
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:06,410
The men never come home,
not even a soul.

343
00:35:09,095 --> 00:35:10,892
They'll never let you come home.

344
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:14,208
Don't worry.

345
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,173
And now, with the baby.

346
00:35:40,895 --> 00:35:42,123
Can you hear me?

347
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:45,043
It's Dad.

348
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:48,930
Listen.

349
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:55,324
Don't tell anyone
what I'm telling you now.

350
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:58,650
It's a secret.

351
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,404
Your dad...

352
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:20,051
is going to come home for you.

353
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,164
Hurry up!

354
00:37:18,455 --> 00:37:19,934
The enemy approaches!

355
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:31,534
This is ridiculous!

356
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:34,290
Why waste time digging these tunnels?

357
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:36,926
They are all going to die anyway.

358
00:37:37,495 --> 00:37:40,931
At least he conceded
to the pillboxes on the beach.

359
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:54,973
You wanted to see me, sir?

360
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:57,574
Care for a drink?

361
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:05,010
You have been looking
quite pale these days.

362
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:12,050
It's the water. It has
never agreed with me.

363
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:13,604
That's not good.

364
00:38:15,095 --> 00:38:18,007
Why don't you go back
to the mainland to recoup?

365
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:23,528
I have commissioned Admiral Ichimaru
to take your place.

366
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:27,370
We are wasting time
digging these tunnels.

367
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:32,014
General, the island won't last
five days without fleet support.

368
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:35,810
We should fight to the death.

369
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:41,327
The tunnel-digging may be futile.

370
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:45,849
Maybe the stand on Iwo will be futile.

371
00:38:46,295 --> 00:38:48,411
Maybe the whole war is futile.

372
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:50,167
But will you give up then?

373
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,531
We will defend this island
until we are dead!

374
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:54,845
Until the very last soldier is dead!

375
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:59,807
If our children can live safely
for one more day...

376
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:03,047
it would be worth the one more day
that we defend this island!

377
00:39:03,935 --> 00:39:05,084
Ohsugi...

378
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:09,489
if you have an ounce
of pride left as an officer...

379
00:39:10,335 --> 00:39:11,609
I beg of you...

380
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:15,207
go back to headquarters
and ask them to send support.

381
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:42,484
So the rumor is true?
I couldn't believe it.

382
00:39:43,855 --> 00:39:47,530
I'm grateful to be leaving this island.

383
00:39:49,215 --> 00:39:51,126
We may have had our differences...

384
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:55,008
but I'm truly sorry to see you go.

385
00:39:56,455 --> 00:39:59,492
General Hayashi, it is up to you now.

386
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:05,691
Kuribayashi belongs behind a desk,
not commanding war.

387
00:40:06,415 --> 00:40:07,734
I understand.

388
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:11,445
There are many of us
who agree with you, sir.

389
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:26,884
Listen.

390
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,924
The Americans are likely to land here.

391
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,684
Crossfire positions will be here...

392
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:36,764
here...

393
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:38,970
and here.

394
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:41,563
The fact is...

395
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:47,765
we are completely
outnumbered in every sector.

396
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:51,406
But we have a great advantage.

397
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,843
Can anyone tell me what that is?

398
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:03,093
The Americans are weak-willed
and inferior to Japanese soldiers.

399
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,654
Very good, Shimizu.

400
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:06,968
Why is that?

401
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:08,768
They are not as disciplined...

402
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:11,529
and they let their emotions
interfere with their duty.

403
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:12,923
That is correct.

404
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:19,333
Here is the uniform
of an American medic.

405
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:21,929
He should be your target.

406
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:26,648
For Americans will risk the lives
of many soldiers to save this one.

407
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:28,570
Understood?

408
00:41:39,655 --> 00:41:42,453
General, may I speak with you?

409
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:47,084
Please keep an eye on
Major General Hayashi.

410
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:51,371
Thank you for your concern, Nishi...

411
00:41:51,695 --> 00:41:54,607
but we don't have any time to waste.

412
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:58,052
We must think about what
we can do at this moment.

413
00:42:01,215 --> 00:42:02,614
Admiral Ichimaru.

414
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:07,452
Reporting for duty, sir.

415
00:42:08,415 --> 00:42:09,973
Excuse me.

416
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,843
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

417
00:44:06,455 --> 00:44:07,570
Jupiter!

418
00:44:10,295 --> 00:44:11,523
Jupiter.

419
00:45:00,695 --> 00:45:01,844
Yamazaki...

420
00:45:02,855 --> 00:45:05,847
what are you doing just
sitting there? Help us...

421
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:46,894
I think he's writing about us
in his reports.

422
00:45:48,055 --> 00:45:49,647
He's just writing a letter.

423
00:45:50,135 --> 00:45:52,888
It's been two months, Nozaki.

424
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:56,013
He would have reported us by now.

425
00:45:56,175 --> 00:45:57,847
How can you be sure?

426
00:46:05,535 --> 00:46:08,208
Will they ever stop?

427
00:46:08,655 --> 00:46:11,567
Day and night, day and night...

428
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:15,732
It's driving me crazy!

429
00:46:16,535 --> 00:46:20,733
If the damn Americans
are going to invade...

430
00:46:22,535 --> 00:46:24,412
why don't they hurry up and land?

431
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:39,723
<i>Tako-Chan...</i>

432
00:46:40,055 --> 00:46:43,889
<i>the four chicks that were born</i>
<i>two months ago have grown so much.</i>

433
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:48,214
<i>The mother chicken leads them</i>
<i>for food every day...</i>

434
00:46:48,695 --> 00:46:52,688
<i>but they're giving me a hard time, picking</i>
<i>at the vegetable garden I have grown.</i>

435
00:46:57,455 --> 00:47:00,652
The fleet of American ships
has left Saipan.

436
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:10,327
So they are on their way.

437
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,613
Ready the troops.

438
00:47:47,895 --> 00:47:49,010
Men...

439
00:47:50,295 --> 00:47:53,173
the time has come
to show your true colors.

440
00:47:54,095 --> 00:47:56,325
As a member of the honorable
Imperial Army...

441
00:47:57,055 --> 00:47:59,410
I trust that you will fight with honor.

442
00:48:02,535 --> 00:48:06,323
This island is of utmost importance
to Japan.

443
00:48:07,575 --> 00:48:08,894
<i>Should the island fall...</i>

444
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:12,687
the enemy...

445
00:48:13,575 --> 00:48:17,488
will use it as their base
to attack our homeland.

446
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,368
For the mainland...

447
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:23,288
For our homeland...

448
00:48:23,815 --> 00:48:26,124
Until the very last man.

449
00:48:26,975 --> 00:48:30,012
<i>Our duty is to stop the enemy right here.</i>

450
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,774
<i>Not one of you...</i>

451
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:36,447
is allowed to die until you have killed
10 enemy soldiers.

452
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:43,532
Do not expect to return home alive.

453
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:49,890
I will always be in front of you.

454
00:48:58,655 --> 00:49:00,247
Long live the Emperor.

455
00:49:42,535 --> 00:49:45,732
<i>Take care and be well.</i>

456
00:49:47,175 --> 00:49:52,090
<i>I will fight courageously until the end,</i>
<i>in the spirit of Yamato.</i>

457
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:57,413
<i>My heart will always be with you.</i>

458
00:49:58,415 --> 00:49:59,609
<i>Takeichi.</i>

459
00:50:15,335 --> 00:50:20,489
<i>Every household is assigned a quota</i>
<i>of bag-making for the gunpowder.</i>

460
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:25,567
<i>I cannot help but get tense when I think</i>
<i>that these will be used in battle.</i>

461
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:29,253
<i>Taro and Yoko laugh at me for this.</i>

462
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:33,292
<i>Takako, on evacuation in Nagano,</i>
<i>is also doing well.</i>

463
00:50:34,095 --> 00:50:36,131
<i>I pray for your safety.</i>

464
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:39,370
<i>Sincerely, Yoshi.</i>

465
00:50:52,735 --> 00:50:54,373
No one can shoot me now.

466
00:50:58,215 --> 00:51:02,254
That's a nice belt.
My wife sent me one, too.

467
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:10,808
Doesn't look like Mr. <i>Kempeitai</i>
has a thousand-stitch belt, does he?

468
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:13,564
Maybe he thinks it will clash
with his uniform.

469
00:51:13,735 --> 00:51:16,169
He probably doesn't believe
in superstitions, anyway.

470
00:51:20,935 --> 00:51:23,130
His mother made him one after all.

471
00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:48,332
- Maybe they're trying to sink the island.
- My head hurts.

472
00:51:48,575 --> 00:51:51,453
How many ships do you think
there are out there?

473
00:51:51,615 --> 00:51:55,164
At least 30. Maybe even 50.

474
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:57,963
- They must be really close.
- I need to take a leak.

475
00:51:58,135 --> 00:52:00,774
Don't go near the sewers.
Dysentery is spreading through there.

476
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:02,050
Where do I go then?

477
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:04,286
There is a pot at the end of the cave.

478
00:52:23,815 --> 00:52:25,612
The shit pot is full.

479
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:27,772
Someone needs to throw it out.

480
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,650
If anything happens to that pot...

481
00:52:54,055 --> 00:52:58,731
you'll be carrying our shit away
with your hands.

482
00:54:03,055 --> 00:54:04,807
Is this some kind of a joke?

483
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,164
Why are you always picking on me?

484
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:49,813
Thank you, God. I take back
what I said before.

485
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,687
Shall we commence fire?

486
00:55:06,055 --> 00:55:07,090
Not yet.

487
00:55:12,015 --> 00:55:14,483
The men wish to commence firing.

488
00:55:21,695 --> 00:55:22,969
Hold your fire!

489
00:55:26,175 --> 00:55:27,449
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

490
00:55:27,775 --> 00:55:29,049
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

491
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:39,687
They will take the beach
in no time if we do not resist.

492
00:55:39,855 --> 00:55:41,766
Wait until the beach is full.

493
00:56:03,535 --> 00:56:06,288
Let's go. Commence firing!

494
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:13,368
Commence firing!

495
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:15,854
<i>Commence firing!</i>

496
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:17,371
The guns of the Kitakubo unit
were destroyed.

497
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:19,765
All the pillbox units on the beach
have been destroyed.

498
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:21,766
However, all other forces are intact...

499
00:57:21,935 --> 00:57:24,085
and we estimate more than
1,000 enemy casualties.

500
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:26,884
The pillbox destruction was unavoidable.

501
00:57:27,255 --> 00:57:29,291
Overall, that is good news.

502
00:57:29,535 --> 00:57:31,366
How are the men
holding up at Suribachi?

503
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,734
Forces are intact.

504
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:38,688
What is the enemy situation?

505
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,733
Approximately 20,000 men and 80 tanks.

506
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:46,168
There has to be more than that.
They still have men waiting in the boats.

507
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,764
Currently the enemy front extends...

508
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,809
between Suribachi
and the south landing...

509
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,485
and Chidori airfield south.

510
00:57:55,135 --> 00:57:59,174
Just as I thought... Suribachi
and the Motoyama airfield.

511
00:58:00,095 --> 00:58:02,290
They are making a two-pronged attack.

512
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:20,052
That's not enough! I need more ammo.

513
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:45,529
Take his place!

514
00:58:45,935 --> 00:58:47,971
- The machine gun is blasted.
- Use your rifle!

515
00:58:50,455 --> 00:58:51,934
Watch out! Imbecile!

516
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:54,124
I can't rely on you.

517
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:57,367
Go send a report to Colonel Adachi
that we need another machine gun.

518
00:58:57,775 --> 00:58:58,969
Hurry up!

519
00:59:24,335 --> 00:59:26,485
Colonel Adachi is asking
for reinforcements.

520
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:30,973
We can't afford to send reinforcements.
Tell him to hold out.

521
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:43,123
Shoot him!

522
00:59:50,815 --> 00:59:53,045
- What's the matter?
- We're out of bullets!

523
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:12,886
We are losing Suribachi.

524
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:17,847
All is lost. Request permission
to lead a suicide mission.

525
01:00:18,335 --> 01:00:21,213
No. You must try to hold them off.

526
01:00:21,935 --> 01:00:25,610
Do what you can to survive
and join forces in the north caves.

527
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,410
But, sir...

528
01:00:28,095 --> 01:00:30,893
I have failed to hold Suribachi.

529
01:00:31,135 --> 01:00:33,933
Permit me to die with honor with
my men.

530
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,370
No, Colonel.

531
01:00:36,015 --> 01:00:37,289
<i>This is an order!</i>

532
01:00:42,495 --> 01:00:43,610
Adachi.

533
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,810
Adachi!

534
01:00:59,215 --> 01:01:03,049
Sir, Captain Tanida
requests machine guns.

535
01:01:05,135 --> 01:01:06,363
It's over.

536
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:15,324
Suicide...

537
01:01:16,655 --> 01:01:18,532
That's the only thing left.

538
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,364
But...

539
01:01:21,655 --> 01:01:24,533
Here, take this to your commander.

540
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:11,125
I heard General Kuribayashi
order Colonel Adachi to escape.

541
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:12,284
Quiet!

542
01:02:15,695 --> 01:02:18,812
Escape is the coward's way.

543
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:21,129
Sit down!

544
01:02:32,775 --> 01:02:33,810
Men...

545
01:02:36,575 --> 01:02:37,610
we are...

546
01:02:40,335 --> 01:02:42,565
honorable soldiers of the Emperor.

547
01:02:46,135 --> 01:02:47,614
Don't ever forget that.

548
01:02:51,615 --> 01:02:53,446
The only way left for us...

549
01:02:55,295 --> 01:02:57,126
is to die with honor.

550
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,168
This is our fate...

551
01:03:03,775 --> 01:03:06,005
to find our place at Yasukuni Shrine.

552
01:03:10,895 --> 01:03:12,487
I'll see you there.

553
01:03:31,455 --> 01:03:33,366
Soldiers, farewell!

554
01:05:23,935 --> 01:05:24,970
Stop!

555
01:05:32,255 --> 01:05:35,691
You should die like an honorable soldier.

556
01:05:36,535 --> 01:05:38,014
Look, Shimizu...

557
01:05:40,655 --> 01:05:43,328
we can still join the troops
in the northern caves.

558
01:05:44,255 --> 01:05:46,815
Our orders are to stay here until death.

559
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:48,727
I heard General Kuribayashi himself.

560
01:05:49,815 --> 01:05:51,407
That's what he said...

561
01:05:53,175 --> 01:05:54,449
over the radio.

562
01:05:55,855 --> 01:05:57,049
It's true.

563
01:06:01,055 --> 01:06:03,125
We can die here...

564
01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:07,129
or we can continue fighting.

565
01:06:10,415 --> 01:06:13,168
Which would better serve the Emperor?

566
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,368
Which one?

567
01:06:38,655 --> 01:06:39,974
Where does this go?

568
01:06:40,135 --> 01:06:42,330
It will take us closer to Motoyama.

569
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:49,927
Do you have orders to move back?

570
01:06:51,295 --> 01:06:53,172
Where are the rest of your men?

571
01:06:53,655 --> 01:06:54,929
All dead.

572
01:06:56,415 --> 01:06:58,212
It's the same with us.

573
01:07:05,895 --> 01:07:08,045
There should be an outlet
somewhere near here.

574
01:07:08,255 --> 01:07:09,370
Be quiet!

575
01:07:55,135 --> 01:07:59,765
So you thought you could blow us up,
or burn us alive, did you?

576
01:08:14,815 --> 01:08:17,045
- Have we heard from Suribachi?
- No, sir.

577
01:08:17,215 --> 01:08:18,694
Send a messenger!

578
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:30,163
Lieutenant Oiso has ordered us
to rendezvous at the east cave.

579
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,848
We will make a run for Motoyama.

580
01:08:41,535 --> 01:08:44,049
There is no cover for two kilometers.

581
01:08:44,775 --> 01:08:47,289
It will be every man for himself.

582
01:08:53,695 --> 01:08:55,447
See you on the other side.

583
01:08:56,095 --> 01:08:59,724
If not on this earth,
then in the next world.

584
01:09:14,095 --> 01:09:16,655
Don't run with the herd.
That's where the enemy will fire.

585
01:09:16,815 --> 01:09:17,964
Stay back.

586
01:09:18,735 --> 01:09:20,054
That's cowardice!

587
01:09:21,935 --> 01:09:25,291
There is no use for a dead soldier.

588
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:56,085
Wait until the flare is gone.

589
01:10:21,135 --> 01:10:22,807
Crawl forward.

590
01:10:40,535 --> 01:10:42,014
What happened to the messenger?

591
01:10:42,255 --> 01:10:43,574
He never came back.

592
01:10:47,415 --> 01:10:48,973
I will go to Adachi myself.

593
01:10:49,215 --> 01:10:52,207
Motoyama's transmitter
still works, General.

594
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,212
Why not try there, sir?

595
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:17,366
Sir, these men retreated
from Mt. Suribachi.

596
01:11:24,175 --> 01:11:25,494
What are your names?

597
01:11:25,775 --> 01:11:28,209
Saigo, from the 312th.

598
01:11:28,815 --> 01:11:30,294
Shimizu, reporting for duty.

599
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,286
You escaped from Suribachi?

600
01:11:40,495 --> 01:11:42,451
How dare you!

601
01:11:44,295 --> 01:11:47,093
It was your duty
to stay in your position until death.

602
01:11:49,295 --> 01:11:50,808
You should have died...

603
01:11:51,695 --> 01:11:53,970
with your fellow troop members.

604
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:58,810
You are both a disgrace.

605
01:12:02,775 --> 01:12:04,208
Get on your knees.

606
01:12:06,735 --> 01:12:09,329
- But, sir...
- I said, get on your knees!

607
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:31,044
I don't want you to kill
my soldiers needlessly.

608
01:12:32,695 --> 01:12:34,208
Put down your sword.

609
01:12:34,695 --> 01:12:35,969
Put it down!

610
01:12:42,095 --> 01:12:43,574
What's going on here?

611
01:12:45,815 --> 01:12:49,854
These men ran from Suribachi.

612
01:12:52,255 --> 01:12:56,885
Lt. Ito, I gave the order that all survivors
retreat to the north caves.

613
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,727
I am very sorry, General.

614
01:13:02,895 --> 01:13:04,089
It's just...

615
01:13:05,335 --> 01:13:06,734
Suribachi...

616
01:13:09,015 --> 01:13:10,368
has fallen.

617
01:13:30,815 --> 01:13:32,407
Now that Suribachi has been taken...

618
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,884
the enemy will maneuver all forces
onto the hillside.

619
01:13:35,055 --> 01:13:36,966
We must move
our command center north, sir.

620
01:13:43,095 --> 01:13:44,164
Ito...

621
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,325
fight for your fallen brethren...

622
01:13:50,095 --> 01:13:51,733
until the end.

623
01:14:13,335 --> 01:14:14,734
Get up!

624
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,811
Major General Hayashi
is leading an attack.

625
01:14:20,975 --> 01:14:22,533
We are to join him.

626
01:14:25,935 --> 01:14:28,210
Kuribayashi's orders are
to remain in the caves.

627
01:14:30,615 --> 01:14:34,733
Lieutenant Ito says Kuribayashi
is a weak American sympathizer.

628
01:14:44,255 --> 01:14:46,974
We will take back Mt. Suribachi.

629
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:10,131
Where is Major General Hayashi?

630
01:15:12,615 --> 01:15:13,934
We don't know, sir.

631
01:15:14,535 --> 01:15:15,888
Who is in charge here?

632
01:15:16,135 --> 01:15:17,932
I'm not sure.

633
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,205
Stay here until
I determine the plan of action.

634
01:15:47,935 --> 01:15:49,368
We're dead.

635
01:15:55,095 --> 01:15:57,131
Pull back!

636
01:15:57,655 --> 01:15:59,407
We'll get reinforcements.

637
01:16:30,415 --> 01:16:35,045
Why didn't your regiment join the attack?

638
01:16:38,935 --> 01:16:40,573
Don't sit here like rats!

639
01:16:41,415 --> 01:16:44,851
Come out of your caves and fight!

640
01:16:46,575 --> 01:16:48,088
Where is your commander?

641
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,052
We haven't received the order to attack.

642
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:56,214
Didn't you receive the order
from General Hayashi?

643
01:16:57,575 --> 01:17:00,533
Kuribayashi countermanded
Hayashi's order.

644
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,886
There is to be no attack.

645
01:17:06,415 --> 01:17:08,485
We will take back Suribachi...

646
01:17:09,415 --> 01:17:10,973
with or without Kuribayashi.

647
01:17:11,655 --> 01:17:14,727
There are already troops on the attack.
Get your men in order.

648
01:17:14,895 --> 01:17:17,455
Lieutenant, may I remind you
of your rank!

649
01:17:17,615 --> 01:17:19,890
Your disrespect for senior officers...

650
01:17:20,695 --> 01:17:23,368
puts your men at needless risk.

651
01:17:25,335 --> 01:17:27,246
I suggest you go back to your cave...

652
01:17:27,415 --> 01:17:31,124
or hand over your men.

653
01:17:40,935 --> 01:17:42,084
Enough.

654
01:17:42,495 --> 01:17:44,167
We'll do it ourselves.

655
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,134
That's against regulations.

656
01:17:56,455 --> 01:17:59,891
That's the officer who tried to kill us.
He doesn't care.

657
01:18:30,735 --> 01:18:32,054
I won't go back.

658
01:18:34,015 --> 01:18:36,131
I've had enough of cave fighting.

659
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,008
You men are now under
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi's command.

660
01:18:52,615 --> 01:18:54,412
I will throw myself under an enemy tank.

661
01:18:57,855 --> 01:19:00,289
I will take out one of their machines.

662
01:19:27,735 --> 01:19:28,929
Hurry.

663
01:19:31,215 --> 01:19:32,568
What is the status?

664
01:19:34,295 --> 01:19:35,967
A thousand men were lost...

665
01:19:36,135 --> 01:19:37,932
in a night attack along Chidori airfield.

666
01:19:38,095 --> 01:19:40,768
Why? I have given them strict orders
not to kill themselves.

667
01:19:40,935 --> 01:19:44,530
It seems that the order to retreat
was not conveyed to all sectors.

668
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,569
Hayashi.

669
01:19:47,055 --> 01:19:48,329
Damn you!

670
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:50,808
And the American advancement?

671
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:55,004
A battalion is headed north and we
are fighting back along the west ridge.

672
01:19:55,175 --> 01:19:59,248
Good. Once they cross the west ridge,
they will be surrounded on three sides.

673
01:20:00,615 --> 01:20:01,843
This just arrived.

674
01:20:02,015 --> 01:20:03,084
Read it.

675
01:20:07,855 --> 01:20:09,334
From headquarters...

676
01:20:11,415 --> 01:20:15,886
"We regret that we are unable to send
reinforcements to Iwo at this time.

677
01:20:17,255 --> 01:20:20,611
We earnestly hope you will
fight honorably...

678
01:20:21,335 --> 01:20:23,451
and die for your country."

679
01:22:01,335 --> 01:22:02,404
Bring him in.

680
01:22:17,535 --> 01:22:18,524
Bring him in.

681
01:22:28,535 --> 01:22:30,605
Shall I finish him off?

682
01:22:31,335 --> 01:22:33,246
No. Treat him.

683
01:22:34,615 --> 01:22:35,809
But, sir...

684
01:22:35,975 --> 01:22:38,489
Okubo, you would expect the same,
wouldn't you?

685
01:22:38,655 --> 01:22:39,883
Endo, treat him.

686
01:22:40,295 --> 01:22:42,968
We are low on morphine as it is.

687
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:47,094
Sir, the Americans would not treat
a wounded Japanese soldier.

688
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:50,088
Son, have you ever met one?

689
01:22:51,575 --> 01:22:52,644
Treat him.

690
01:23:28,615 --> 01:23:30,606
Where are you, American tanks?

691
01:23:31,655 --> 01:23:33,213
Come and get me!

692
01:23:48,215 --> 01:23:49,773
How is the prisoner doing?

693
01:23:50,255 --> 01:23:51,529
He is awake, sir.

694
01:23:55,335 --> 01:23:58,372
I will question the prisoner
for information.

695
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:41,729
Damn.

696
01:25:44,015 --> 01:25:45,448
I've had enough of this.

697
01:25:46,135 --> 01:25:47,648
I'm going to surrender.

698
01:25:52,175 --> 01:25:54,006
Go ahead and arrest me.

699
01:25:55,215 --> 01:25:58,810
I don't care anymore. That's what
you were put here for, isn't it?

700
01:26:00,175 --> 01:26:02,530
To report treasonous thoughts.

701
01:26:06,855 --> 01:26:08,573
I was put here because...

702
01:26:09,975 --> 01:26:12,011
I was discharged from the <i>Kempeitai</i>.

703
01:26:15,135 --> 01:26:16,250
Discharged?

704
01:26:20,695 --> 01:26:23,846
I had only been in service
for five days.

705
01:26:26,975 --> 01:26:28,010
Shimizu...

706
01:26:28,175 --> 01:26:30,814
you must always be firm.

707
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:35,934
Any mercy and people
will take advantage of you.

708
01:26:41,215 --> 01:26:42,330
That's unpatriotic.

709
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:44,094
Go sort it out, Shimizu.

710
01:26:56,255 --> 01:26:58,974
You do not have the Imperial flag
properly displayed.

711
01:26:59,135 --> 01:27:00,329
I'm sorry.

712
01:27:00,495 --> 01:27:03,851
My husband has gone to war
and I couldn't put it up myself.

713
01:27:04,015 --> 01:27:06,609
It is unpatriotic
not to have the flag displayed.

714
01:27:06,775 --> 01:27:08,970
If you help me, I'll put it up now.

715
01:27:28,655 --> 01:27:30,486
Get that dog to shut up.

716
01:27:32,015 --> 01:27:33,130
What was that, sir?

717
01:27:34,255 --> 01:27:38,328
That dog is a nuisance.
It is disruptive of Army communications.

718
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:40,851
I am very sorry, sir.

719
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:48,966
Shimizu. Dispose of the dog.

720
01:27:50,255 --> 01:27:53,645
We can't have a dog interfering
with important military commands.

721
01:27:59,215 --> 01:28:00,773
Take the dog in the back.

722
01:28:01,095 --> 01:28:02,414
It's only a dog.

723
01:28:02,615 --> 01:28:05,083
It won't happen again.

724
01:28:05,535 --> 01:28:06,888
Take it out back.

725
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:08,967
Keep the children inside.

726
01:28:10,095 --> 01:28:11,289
Hurry up.

727
01:28:57,615 --> 01:28:59,845
Take the dog into the house
and keep him quiet...

728
01:29:00,495 --> 01:29:01,484
and never let him out.

729
01:29:13,175 --> 01:29:14,654
It's taken care of, sir.

730
01:29:51,455 --> 01:29:53,286
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

731
01:29:55,055 --> 01:30:00,175
If you can't even shoot a dog,
you'll never be able to handle the Reds.

732
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:03,208
You are unpatriotic!

733
01:30:09,175 --> 01:30:11,450
I was discharged for insubordination...

734
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:14,253
and sent here.

735
01:30:22,695 --> 01:30:24,367
Don't look so glum, Shimizu.

736
01:30:25,855 --> 01:30:28,369
At least now only the enemy hates you.

737
01:30:33,295 --> 01:30:34,967
I don't blame the dog.

738
01:30:59,695 --> 01:31:00,810
<i>Taro...</i>

739
01:31:01,215 --> 01:31:04,013
<i>tonight I attended my farewell party.</i>

740
01:31:04,615 --> 01:31:07,049
<i>The wives also attended,</i>
<i>so there was a lot of fuss.</i>

741
01:31:07,215 --> 01:31:10,013
<i>Greeting all the ladies...</i>

742
01:31:10,255 --> 01:31:13,247
<i>kept me from enjoying the food.</i>

743
01:33:51,575 --> 01:33:53,531
Is there any information
of the enemy's plan?

744
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,411
No, it's just a letter.

745
01:33:58,215 --> 01:33:59,933
It's from his mother.

746
01:34:02,295 --> 01:34:03,330
"Sam...

747
01:34:04,335 --> 01:34:06,565
I have mailed you
a couple of books to read.

748
01:34:07,175 --> 01:34:08,654
I hope that you like them.

749
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:10,924
Yesterday...

750
01:34:11,655 --> 01:34:16,206
the dogs dug a hole under the fence.

751
01:34:17,535 --> 01:34:21,608
They ran all over the neighborhood.

752
01:34:22,655 --> 01:34:24,771
By the time we found them...

753
01:34:25,935 --> 01:34:30,725
the Harrisons' roosters were terrorized.

754
01:34:31,495 --> 01:34:34,214
Don't worry about us.

755
01:34:35,415 --> 01:34:39,328
Just take care of yourself
and come back safely.

756
01:34:39,695 --> 01:34:43,244
Remember what I said to you...

757
01:34:46,735 --> 01:34:48,293
always do what is right...

758
01:34:49,335 --> 01:34:51,451
because it is right.

759
01:34:52,575 --> 01:34:56,090
I pray for a speedy end to the war...

760
01:34:56,255 --> 01:34:57,608
and your safe return.

761
01:34:59,135 --> 01:35:00,409
Love, Mom."

762
01:35:33,655 --> 01:35:36,169
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more medicine.

763
01:35:36,335 --> 01:35:39,372
It's all right. I'm useless now.
Go help the others!

764
01:37:06,975 --> 01:37:08,931
Okubo, come here.

765
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:17,047
How are we on ammunition?

766
01:37:19,055 --> 01:37:21,364
Not good, sir.

767
01:37:22,855 --> 01:37:24,732
Our mortars have been taken out...

768
01:37:25,495 --> 01:37:27,292
and we're out of machine gun ammo.

769
01:37:29,015 --> 01:37:32,212
We have only our rifles.

770
01:37:34,175 --> 01:37:35,164
Okubo...

771
01:37:35,335 --> 01:37:38,964
you are now in charge of the men.

772
01:37:43,535 --> 01:37:45,048
We can no longer hold this area.

773
01:37:45,775 --> 01:37:49,131
You must guide
the rest of the men north.

774
01:37:51,695 --> 01:37:54,926
Take whatever food and ammo
we have left.

775
01:37:56,055 --> 01:37:58,330
What about you, sir?

776
01:38:01,615 --> 01:38:04,891
I'm tired of sharing this cave
with all of you.

777
01:38:05,695 --> 01:38:08,129
I'm a one-man show from here on out.

778
01:38:08,455 --> 01:38:10,127
What are you talking about, sir?

779
01:38:11,455 --> 01:38:14,606
Your first order of business...

780
01:38:15,615 --> 01:38:17,287
is to find some water.

781
01:38:43,175 --> 01:38:44,290
Men...

782
01:38:45,695 --> 01:38:47,253
do your best.

783
01:38:48,695 --> 01:38:52,927
Do what is right...

784
01:38:54,695 --> 01:38:56,845
because it is right.

785
01:38:58,935 --> 01:39:00,129
Understood?

786
01:39:07,615 --> 01:39:12,370
I will make sure that they send you
medicine and food.

787
01:39:14,535 --> 01:39:15,809
It has been a great honor...

788
01:39:17,175 --> 01:39:18,369
to serve...

789
01:39:19,615 --> 01:39:21,014
under you.

790
01:39:58,575 --> 01:40:00,054
Hand me my rifle.

791
01:40:22,895 --> 01:40:24,692
I'm sorry, Okubo.

792
01:41:41,535 --> 01:41:44,607
Why am I not getting any reports?
Have we heard from Admiral Ichimaru?

793
01:41:44,775 --> 01:41:47,414
- No, sir.
- What about Nishi or Hayashi?

794
01:41:49,775 --> 01:41:52,687
- Send out messengers!
- We have. Many times.

795
01:41:52,935 --> 01:41:54,573
None of them have come back.

796
01:41:55,055 --> 01:41:56,773
You can't plan strategy like this!

797
01:42:07,495 --> 01:42:10,851
I have been thinking about
what Lt. Colonel Nishi said.

798
01:42:11,575 --> 01:42:12,928
He's right.

799
01:42:17,975 --> 01:42:20,773
I don't know anything about the enemy.

800
01:42:21,495 --> 01:42:25,010
I believed that the Americans
were cowards...

801
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:32,613
but they weren't.

802
01:42:37,615 --> 01:42:39,685
I was taught...

803
01:42:41,295 --> 01:42:42,933
that they were savages...

804
01:42:44,655 --> 01:42:46,566
but that American soldier...

805
01:42:53,775 --> 01:42:55,811
his mother's words...

806
01:42:59,575 --> 01:43:01,611
were the same as my mother's.

807
01:43:02,775 --> 01:43:06,609
I want to fulfill my duty
for the general...

808
01:43:07,495 --> 01:43:09,565
and our country...

809
01:43:11,215 --> 01:43:13,285
but I don't want to die for nothing.

810
01:43:19,055 --> 01:43:20,329
What do you think?

811
01:43:32,055 --> 01:43:33,124
You...

812
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:37,014
haven't lived enough to realize...

813
01:43:41,655 --> 01:43:44,010
what you are sacrificing.

814
01:43:52,015 --> 01:43:54,131
Will you surrender with me?

815
01:44:14,695 --> 01:44:15,969
Careful.

816
01:44:19,415 --> 01:44:23,044
They'll notice if we leave together.
You go first.

817
01:44:24,015 --> 01:44:25,687
I'll make up an excuse.

818
01:44:25,855 --> 01:44:28,369
After a while, I'll tell them
I'm going to check on you.

819
01:44:28,535 --> 01:44:30,446
We'll be gone before they even notice.

820
01:44:33,735 --> 01:44:35,691
Pretend that you have dysentery.

821
01:44:36,495 --> 01:44:38,611
Give me your dysentery look.

822
01:44:48,175 --> 01:44:49,767
I guess that'll have to do.

823
01:44:58,375 --> 01:44:59,854
Where are you going?

824
01:45:00,175 --> 01:45:01,767
I've got dysentery.

825
01:45:02,215 --> 01:45:04,046
You're going to surrender, aren't you?

826
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:06,251
If you are, take me with you.

827
01:45:06,855 --> 01:45:09,323
- I've had enough of this war.
- Be quiet!

828
01:45:17,455 --> 01:45:19,844
Where are you going?

829
01:45:20,095 --> 01:45:22,450
He said he wasn't feeling well.
It could be dysentery.

830
01:45:22,615 --> 01:45:23,843
You two! Stop!

831
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:30,603
Sir, maybe they got spooked.

832
01:45:47,215 --> 01:45:49,570
Miura, you're on guard.

833
01:45:50,215 --> 01:45:52,126
Make sure we have no more deserters.

834
01:47:14,895 --> 01:47:16,453
What unit were you with?

835
01:47:19,175 --> 01:47:22,884
Higashiyama 314th.

836
01:47:32,215 --> 01:47:33,614
Did you hear...

837
01:47:35,215 --> 01:47:38,685
I heard that they would give you a meal.

838
01:47:40,615 --> 01:47:41,764
A meal...

839
01:47:45,775 --> 01:47:47,413
That sounds good.

840
01:47:52,215 --> 01:47:53,807
I'm from Yokohama, too.

841
01:47:57,135 --> 01:48:00,286
After this is over, you can come visit me.

842
01:49:13,455 --> 01:49:14,604
Lieutenant!

843
01:49:54,575 --> 01:49:56,293
Let this be a lesson to anyone else...

844
01:49:58,415 --> 01:50:00,007
who wants to surrender.

845
01:51:09,935 --> 01:51:13,610
We need to get through the crossfire
to reach the north...

846
01:51:14,455 --> 01:51:16,093
and join our forces at the front.

847
01:51:21,895 --> 01:51:22,930
Listen.

848
01:51:23,975 --> 01:51:26,364
We'll head for that cave
and make our way from there.

849
01:51:29,775 --> 01:51:31,254
Don't waste a bullet!

850
01:51:32,375 --> 01:51:33,774
Not a single one.

851
01:51:34,295 --> 01:51:35,808
Don't shoot recklessly.

852
01:52:33,975 --> 01:52:37,888
These are Nishi's troops
and the survivors from Suribachi.

853
01:52:41,815 --> 01:52:43,692
Are there no officers?

854
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:49,570
You all did a good job making it here.

855
01:52:50,575 --> 01:52:52,167
Fujita, water for them.

856
01:52:56,655 --> 01:52:59,408
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more water.

857
01:53:03,095 --> 01:53:04,164
I'm sorry.

858
01:53:05,455 --> 01:53:06,729
At least you can rest.

859
01:53:21,295 --> 01:53:22,853
You look familiar.

860
01:53:27,855 --> 01:53:29,413
You almost lost your head.

861
01:53:32,335 --> 01:53:36,214
That was the second time you saved me.

862
01:53:38,895 --> 01:53:40,294
The first time...

863
01:53:40,975 --> 01:53:44,445
was the day you landed on the island.

864
01:53:48,055 --> 01:53:49,932
Of course. I remember.

865
01:53:51,535 --> 01:53:53,093
Well, everything happens in threes.

866
01:54:09,095 --> 01:54:10,369
<i>Hanako...</i>

867
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:13,650
<i>This letter will probably</i>
<i>never get to you...</i>

868
01:54:14,335 --> 01:54:15,324
<i>but...</i>

869
01:54:16,015 --> 01:54:18,131
<i>it comforts me to write.</i>

870
01:54:19,535 --> 01:54:21,969
<i>For five days, we've been</i>
<i>without water and food.</i>

871
01:54:23,215 --> 01:54:24,933
<i>To survive...</i>

872
01:54:26,615 --> 01:54:28,606
<i>we do unspeakable things.</i>

873
01:54:31,495 --> 01:54:33,247
<i>There is no escape now.</i>

874
01:54:33,975 --> 01:54:35,090
<i>But...</i>

875
01:54:36,295 --> 01:54:39,014
<i>my only concern is for you and the baby.</i>

876
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:46,774
Dig up some worms.

877
01:55:05,095 --> 01:55:07,689
<i>The battle is approaching its end...</i>

878
01:55:08,215 --> 01:55:10,854
<i>and there is no more ammunition,</i>
<i>no more water.</i>

879
01:55:11,015 --> 01:55:14,371
<i>All the survivors will engage</i>
<i>in a general attack.</i>

880
01:55:15,655 --> 01:55:18,931
<i>I pray for the victory</i>
<i>and safety of the Empire.</i>

881
01:55:19,535 --> 01:55:21,571
<i>I bid you farewell.</i>

882
01:55:23,175 --> 01:55:27,054
<i>For the country,</i>
<i>I could not fulfill all of my duties.</i>

883
01:55:27,215 --> 01:55:31,003
<i>Now that we have no ammunition,</i>
<i>it is with regret that we must perish.</i>

884
01:55:37,255 --> 01:55:40,292
You made it all the way from Suribachi?

885
01:55:43,055 --> 01:55:45,171
That must have been quite a journey.

886
01:55:50,695 --> 01:55:52,208
You are quite a soldier.

887
01:55:54,455 --> 01:55:55,808
No, sir.

888
01:55:56,815 --> 01:55:58,089
I'm just a simple baker.

889
01:55:58,895 --> 01:56:00,613
You were a baker?

890
01:56:02,055 --> 01:56:03,044
Any family?

891
01:56:04,055 --> 01:56:05,283
A wife...

892
01:56:05,895 --> 01:56:10,252
and a baby girl born
last summer in Ohmiya.

893
01:56:13,615 --> 01:56:15,173
I haven't met her yet.

894
01:56:21,175 --> 01:56:22,528
It's strange.

895
01:56:24,975 --> 01:56:28,365
I promised myself to fight
until death for my family...

896
01:56:30,215 --> 01:56:34,367
but the thought of my family
makes it difficult to keep that promise.

897
01:56:56,815 --> 01:56:58,692
A radio transmission from the homeland.

898
01:57:11,815 --> 01:57:13,214
<i>For General Kuribayashi...</i>

899
01:57:13,375 --> 01:57:17,573
<i>and his troops, who are fighting bravely</i>
<i>for our country...</i>

900
01:57:17,735 --> 01:57:19,930
<i>a song will be sung by the children</i>
<i>of Nagano...</i>

901
01:57:20,095 --> 01:57:22,131
<i>which is Kuribayashi's hometown.</i>

902
01:57:22,455 --> 01:57:26,414
<i>On the waves of the Pacific</i>

903
01:57:26,575 --> 01:57:29,726
<i>down south from the Imperial City</i>

904
01:57:30,255 --> 01:57:34,726
<i>a small lonely island floats</i>

905
01:57:37,975 --> 01:57:41,445
<i>The fate of our Imperial country</i>

906
01:57:41,615 --> 01:57:46,086
<i>lies in the hands of this island</i>

907
01:57:48,815 --> 01:57:51,329
<i>Iwo Jima</i>

908
01:57:54,735 --> 01:57:58,091
<i>As long as we stand</i>

909
01:57:58,535 --> 01:58:02,448
<i>we shall feel safe, as the Imperial land</i>

910
01:58:02,615 --> 01:58:07,086
<i>shall forever be at peace</i>

911
01:58:10,255 --> 01:58:14,726
<i>We shall fight with pride</i>
<i>and honor at any price</i>

912
01:58:17,015 --> 01:58:20,451
<i>Our proud island</i>

913
01:58:21,015 --> 01:58:23,575
<i>Iwo Jima</i>

914
01:58:44,975 --> 01:58:46,249
Do me a favor.

915
01:58:47,855 --> 01:58:51,484
Stay here and burn all these documents,
and my military chest.

916
01:58:52,615 --> 01:58:54,685
Everything happens in threes.

917
01:59:22,935 --> 01:59:24,891
We will make a general attack.

918
01:59:25,935 --> 01:59:28,165
Although Japan has lost...

919
01:59:28,855 --> 01:59:30,652
one day...

920
01:59:31,495 --> 01:59:33,531
our people will praise your dedication.

921
01:59:34,615 --> 01:59:38,494
A day will come when they
will weep and pray for your souls.

922
01:59:41,095 --> 01:59:43,290
Be proud to die for your country.

923
01:59:50,135 --> 01:59:52,524
I will always be in front of you.

924
02:02:28,495 --> 02:02:29,689
No more.

925
02:02:31,775 --> 02:02:32,764
No more.

926
02:02:40,495 --> 02:02:42,133
Thank you, Fujita.

927
02:03:12,975 --> 02:03:14,090
This is an order.

928
02:04:19,735 --> 02:04:20,884
You again.

929
02:04:24,215 --> 02:04:27,844
I have one more favor to ask of you.

930
02:04:29,815 --> 02:04:30,964
Bury me...

931
02:04:32,055 --> 02:04:33,966
so that no one will find me.

932
02:04:47,935 --> 02:04:48,924
<i>Taro...</i>

933
02:04:49,295 --> 02:04:50,728
<i>I will be home soon.</i>

934
02:04:51,935 --> 02:04:53,846
<i>I'm glad to be going back to Japan...</i>

935
02:04:54,775 --> 02:04:58,051
<i>but I'm a bit sad</i>
<i>to leave my friends behind.</i>

936
02:05:01,375 --> 02:05:02,888
<i>I drove home...</i>

937
02:05:03,935 --> 02:05:04,924
<i>but...</i>

938
02:05:05,335 --> 02:05:07,849
<i>it's lonely driving all by myself.</i>

939
02:05:19,775 --> 02:05:21,686
Is this still Japanese soil?

940
02:05:30,815 --> 02:05:32,487
This is still Japan.

941
02:07:33,695 --> 02:07:34,844
Just put the shovel down.

942
02:08:45,055 --> 02:08:46,124
Be careful.

943
02:14:54,415 --> 02:14:56,406
