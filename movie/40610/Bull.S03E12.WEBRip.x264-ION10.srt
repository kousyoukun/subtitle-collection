1
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,185
MAN:
There's another one,

2
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:14,188
down by the spa.

3
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,967
You asked me how to get ahead
at the firm.

4
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,578
That's how you do it.

5
00:00:56,621 --> 00:01:00,016
What about merit?
W-What about hard work?

6
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:04,020
Let me explain something to you.

7
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,848
For you to rise in the ranks,

8
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,632
someone has to make room
for you.

9
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:08,938
They have to give up something,

10
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:13,029
maybe a raise
or part of a bonus.

11
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,510
Now why is someone going to be
giving up something

12
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:18,078
unless they get something?

13
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:25,476
Oh, geez. It's behind you,
corner of the bar.

14
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:04,428
M.E. HENSON:
January 5th, 9:40 p.m.

15
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:05,951
Postmortem
examination.

16
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:09,477
External search: Negative.
Internal trunk exploration:

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,653
Negative.

18
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:15,047
Forensic evidence
discovered: None.

19
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,443
How is that possible?

20
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:20,966
Excuse me?

21
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,578
This man's killed four women
in a year and a half.

22
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:26,146
How is it he can hide
in women's bathrooms,

23
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,409
chloroform his victims,
undress them,

24
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:30,715
undress himself,
have sex with them,

25
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,152
strangle them to death,

26
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,371
and still not leave one bit
of forensic evidence?

27
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,982
Not one drop of semen?
Not one fleck of skin?

28
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,463
Listen, I know you're new here,
but, uh, Dr....?

29
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,465
Martin. Julia Martin.

30
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,119
We're talking
public bathrooms.

31
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,730
They're a convention center
of forensic evidence.

32
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,863
The victims' bodies,
that's another story.

33
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,865
That's how we'll get him.

34
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:55,131
PETER: Dr. Martin,
you're still here?

35
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,873
I'd like to take another look
at Emily Baker's body.

36
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,484
Eh, kind of late.
Everyone's gone.

37
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,530
That's okay. I'll be fine.

38
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,185
I'll put everything back
the way I found it.

39
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:11,234
HOLLOWAY: We're obviously
thrilled that this afternoon,

40
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:13,758
a jury of his peers
convicted John Malford,

41
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:16,544
otherwise known as
the "Bathroom Stall Butcher,"

42
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,763
for the murder
of young Emily Baker.

43
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,810
Special thanks to the New York City Medical Examiner's Office,

44
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,595
in particular
to Julia Martin,

45
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,032
whose tireless work led to the
discovery of the pivotal piece

46
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:29,557
of evidence against
John Malford.

47
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:36,041
Hi. Welcome to Billy's.

48
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:39,480
If you're gonna be a successful
attorney in Manhattan,

49
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:41,482
this is a place you need
to know about.

50
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,701
Oh, I didn't even know
there was a Billy's.

51
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:48,619
Well, consider tonight as a part
of your legal education.Thanks.

52
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:51,448
As a matter of fact,
FDR used to settle cases

53
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,710
at that table
right there

54
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,625
in the back.Oh, I don't care about all that.

55
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,453
Show me where
the Benny Colón booth is.

56
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,629
No, this ain't
Dunkin' Donuts.

57
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,544
Why don't you find us a table.

58
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,981
I'll grab us some drinks.

59
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:05,114
STELLA:
Benjamin Colón.

60
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:06,289
Stella!

61
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,509
And Ryan.

62
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,554
Wow...

63
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:11,860
What is the occasion?

64
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,557
You two look like a pair
of breathalyzer tests

65
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,776
waiting to happen.

66
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,778
Well, truth is I have
a pretty good shot

67
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,388
at getting a client
out of prison.

68
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:19,998
Guy was put away for life, so...

69
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,871
So what'd you do? You bake him
a cake with a hacksaw in it?

70
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:27,745
One better.
Ah.

71
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,878
I discovered the evidence
that got him convicted

72
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,401
may have been tampered with.

73
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,750
Seriously?Yeah.

74
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:34,578
By, uh, the police, or...?

75
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:35,884
Medical Examiner's Office.

76
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,538
Yeah.
I petitioned to have

77
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:40,236
a client's DNA evidence retested

78
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,195
and it came back-- no match,
not even close.

79
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,285
Well, who's
the medical examiner?

80
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,809
You know Julia Martin?

81
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,551
No, no, no, no.
That must be a mistake.

82
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:52,640
She was picked up this morning.

83
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,685
D.A.'s office thinks
it was intentional.

84
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,731
Who is your client?

85
00:04:56,774 --> 00:05:00,561
Remember the "Bathroom Stall
Butcher," John Malford?

86
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:03,955
BULL: I hate
trolling for cases.

87
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,653
I like to be asked.

88
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,481
I like to be the one
who can say no.

89
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:10,875
We are not trolling.
We are offering our services.

90
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,488
And trust me, so is every other
A-list criminal firm in town.

91
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,533
I mean, this is
Julia Martin.

92
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:19,536
Chief Medical Examiner
for the City of New York.

93
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,626
These are the kinds of cases
that get the town talking.

94
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,674
Plus, I know her. There's no way
she'd tamper with evidence.

95
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,502
Well, obviously the D.A.
doesn't agree with you

96
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:29,851
or he wouldn't have
arrested her.

97
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,548
Plus, I know she has
a big title,

98
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,377
but at the end of the day
she's just a civil servant.

99
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,161
What are you
trying to say?

100
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:38,033
Well, is this another
pro bono situation?

101
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:41,602
Because, frankly,
I've become such a pro at bono,

102
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,779
I'm getting ready to start
my own Irish rock band.

103
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:50,654
You wake up in the morning
and you go over in your head

104
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:53,353
all those hundreds of things
that you have to do this week.

105
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:58,140
It just doesn't occur to you
that you might get arrested.

106
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,751
You might spend
your first night in jail.

107
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:06,409
I'm the Chief Medical Examiner
for the City of New York.

108
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,063
We want to help you, Julia.

109
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:11,588
You know I can't afford to pay
top-shelf guys like you.

110
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:12,589
We'll be fine.

111
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,635
Will I be?

112
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,420
I also can't afford for you
to do a half-assed job

113
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:20,031
because you're just in it
for the free press.

114
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,425
Keep in mind the best press
for everyone

115
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,035
is about your
ultimate acquittal.

116
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,820
You keep that in mind.

117
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:33,262
All right then,
I guess it's the two of you.

118
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:34,568
Lucky us.

119
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,484
So here's what I know.
Six years ago,

120
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,834
when I found that hair
in the back of a woman's throat,

121
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:43,664
it was a perfect match
to John Malford's hair, perfect.

122
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:47,407
100%. I still have
the evidence that says so,

123
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,062
so I'm not clear
exactly why we're here.

124
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,760
The problem is
Malford's attorney

125
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,718
was running out of appeals,

126
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,199
so he decided
to throw a Hail Mary

127
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,984
and petitioned for
a new analysis of the hair,

128
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:03,161
an outside analysis
of the hair.

129
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:06,600
And when an outside lab tested
it, it came back negative.

130
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,340
And after they popped
their champagne,

131
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:11,735
they sent it to three more labs,
and it also came back negative.

132
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,781
It didn't match
Malford's hair at all.

133
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,826
That's not plausible.

134
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,613
Someone switched the hairs,
or they tested the wrong hair.

135
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,528
Julia, it's completely
plausible.

136
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,965
You don't have to agree with it,
but it's certainly plausible.

137
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,401
No. You're wrong. It isn't.

138
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,797
There's no circumstance
under which I would ever

139
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,973
tamper with evidence
in any case.

140
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,670
Everyone knows this
about me.

141
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:36,630
No. Everyone does not.

142
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:39,502
Think about it.

143
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:42,723
You performed the examination
sometime after midnight.

144
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,681
You were alone
in the autopsy room,

145
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,770
and lack of plausibility
is not the argument

146
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,468
that's gonna win
the case for you.

147
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,949
Okay. You know that
it was a pubic hair.

148
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,734
Right? It was
a man's pubic hair.

149
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:57,651
I found it in the deepest
recesses of her esophagus.

150
00:07:57,694 --> 00:08:01,785
So let's say that I am
going to plant a hair.

151
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:04,179
Where would I have gotten
a male pubic hair from?

152
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:07,225
Oh, come on. Those can't be that
hard to come by in the morgue.

153
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,097
Is it possible you made
a mistake?

154
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,447
Excuse me?I mean, maybe

155
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,667
you thought you
found evidence

156
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,886
that was relevant to
the case, but it wasn't.

157
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,714
Emily might've

158
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:20,108
indulged in oral sex
with someone else,

159
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:22,980
consensual contact.
You did an autopsy.

160
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:26,114
You found this hair.
It was a mistake.

161
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:30,466
No, that's not possible.
I ran every test that there was.

162
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,903
I ran every test myself.
That was his hair.

163
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,122
Keep in mind,

164
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:36,428
if it was truly
a mistake,

165
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,822
then there is
no criminal intent.

166
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:42,739
If there is no criminal intent,
then there's no crime.

167
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:45,220
Mistakes.
Everybody makes them.

168
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:51,269
So you're telling me,
if I say that I made a mistake,

169
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:52,880
the charges might be withdrawn?

170
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:55,143
Well, it's certainly something
I'd like to take to the D.A.

171
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:57,232
I can't imagine that they
would want to go forward

172
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:58,494
with this trial.

173
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,891
I can't.You can't what?

174
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,153
I can't say that

175
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:07,590
because I don't
make mistakes,

176
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,810
not when it comes
to forensic science.

177
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:14,510
Does that change anything
for the two of you?

178
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:21,691
Just makes the job harder,
but we didn't take up the offer

179
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,954
because we thought
it was gonna be easy.

180
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:28,219
We told you we wanted
to defend you, and we mean it.

181
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:31,788
So what's the plan?

182
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,355
Well, to get you out
on bail, for starters.

183
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:35,183
I'll talk to the D.A.
in the morning, get a lay

184
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,489
of the land and see what they
think they have on you.

185
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,795
Dr. Martin.

186
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,930
Julia.

187
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:48,805
Thank you.

188
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,984
Did you say...Thank you.

189
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,769
You're welcome.

190
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,652
The truth is you know
she couldn't have done this.

191
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:12,437
She'd rather cut off her own arm
than give you a false report.

192
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,917
And yet, she did.

193
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,485
You think I'm looking
to take down a medical examiner?

194
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,095
We work with them every day.

195
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:20,010
I've had these results
checked and rechecked

196
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,796
with four different labs.
She screwed up,

197
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,319
which makes all of us look bad.

198
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:26,060
Have you actually considered
the repercussions of this?

199
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,409
You convict the Chief

200
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,454
Medical Examiner for
the City of New York,

201
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,761
and you are handing
a "get out of jail free" card

202
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,502
to everyone you've ever
put behind bars.

203
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:37,114
You will have a mile-long line
of attorneys out your door

204
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,942
claiming that their clients
were falsely convicted.

205
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,161
Is that what you want?

206
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,165
Your discovery packet.

207
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,949
Assuming you're still
gonna want the case

208
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:47,429
once you see
what's in there.

209
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:48,909
Okay, what's in there?

210
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:52,521
Julia's first examination
of Emily Baker's corpse,

211
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:54,131
she came up with nothing.

212
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:57,265
Okay, so she found the evidence
the second time through.

213
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,701
And that's fine,

214
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:01,008
except she completely deleted
the first report.

215
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:02,705
The one where
she came up empty,

216
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,969
just plucked it out of the
system like it never happened.

217
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:07,623
That's a big no-no.

218
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,190
Okay.

219
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:12,410
You know it's a breach of
protocol to delete any reports.

220
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,935
Even ones that are later
replaced by updated results,

221
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:16,588
and you know why.

222
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:20,636
Because it can be construed
as consciousness of guilt.

223
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,118
Julia's the best there is.

224
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:27,948
Do you think she'd accidentally
forget protocol?

225
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:30,341
She couldn't find any evidence
on the dead girl,

226
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:32,735
she decided to take matters
into her own hands

227
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,215
and create some.

228
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,656
Oh, here's the bail agreement.

229
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,223
Is she on her way?Already here.

230
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,529
She and Benny are
waiting in your office.

231
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:48,359
Assistant District Attorney
Williams is not your friend.

232
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,144
I never said that he was.

233
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:53,016
He's claiming you destroyed
an official autopsy report.

234
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,629
Did you write an official report
stating that you didn't find

235
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:00,807
any physical evidence after
your examination of Emily Baker

236
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,853
and then delete that report from
the official citywide records?

237
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,420
Yes.

238
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,248
It was...

239
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,815
years ago. I mean...

240
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:11,121
You have to know how bad
that's gonna look to a jury.

241
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,775
That first report was useless.

242
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,256
It only said
that I didn't find anything.

243
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,823
Yes, but in a court of law,

244
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:20,000
it's going to look like
a prior inconsistent statement.

245
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:22,785
You weren't supposed
to delete it.

246
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,267
You were supposed to keep it
and turn it over in discovery.

247
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,877
No, I wasn't gonna do that.

248
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,879
Malford's lawyers
would've just used it

249
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:33,927
to-to call in to question
the evidence that I did find.

250
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,363
I know how these people operate.

251
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:39,671
Julia, that first report
is still evidence.

252
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,456
You can't just destroy evidence

253
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,066
because it doesn't
suit your needs.

254
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,853
Okay, technically, that first
report was about an absence

255
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,464
of evidence, which
isn't really evidence.

256
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,031
Okay, all right.

257
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,598
The bottom line is,
and-and I know

258
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,036
you couldn't see the future
from where you were standing,

259
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,342
you didn't do yourself
any favors.

260
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:01,955
The D.A.'s office is gonna say
that you intentionally deleted

261
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,609
that report
to make it easier for you

262
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,046
to intentionally
plant the evidence.

263
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,874
But that isn't what
actually happened.

264
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,093
Even if it looks like
that's what happened.

265
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,487
It really boils down to this:
either you made a mistake,

266
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,490
or someone, quite possibly you,
is guilty of malfeasance.

267
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,101
BENNY: Well, Danny's already
looking into malfeasance.

268
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,626
She's trying to find anyone
with the means and motive

269
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,976
to have switched out the hairs.

270
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,849
Which in the meantime
leaves us with: mistake.

271
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,851
As I've already explained
to you,

272
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,419
I don't make
those kinds of mistakes.

273
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,290
Well, then someone else did.

274
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,816
In either event, we need
to follow chain of custody.

275
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:40,820
I need to know everyone
who had access to that hair.

276
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,909
Julia, can you talk
to my investigator,

277
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,912
talk to her about how evidence
is catalogued and stored,

278
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,783
who had access,
how they get access?

279
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,393
Of course.Excellent.

280
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:52,962
Well, then, Mr. Colón and I will
see you in court

281
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:55,008
later this afternoon.

282
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,489
Everything all right?

283
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,535
I guess.

284
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:03,886
I just realized I don't know
where to go.

285
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,671
And what to do until court.

286
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:09,761
You know, my first instinct
is to rush back to the morgue

287
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:13,374
and then I remembered
that I can't.

288
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,686
Not to worry.

289
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,908
It is gonna be tough
to find jurors

290
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,257
who aren't put off
by our client.

291
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:28,911
Mm.

292
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:32,872
Maybe we should look for people
who only see the best in others.

293
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,049
Actually, I was thinking
just the opposite.

294
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:39,095
What? People who
only see the worst?

295
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,141
You ever heard
of Hanlon's razor?

296
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:42,185
No.

297
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:43,839
"Never attribute to malice

298
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,668
that which is adequately
explained by stupidity."

299
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:49,279
We need people who will
look at this situation

300
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:53,109
Julia's gotten into and think,
"This isn't some big conspiracy.

301
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:56,112
This is probably
just someone's stupid mistake."

302
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,114
Good afternoon.

303
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:02,205
So let's say you send
an e-mail to your boss

304
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:03,903
asking him for time off.

305
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,644
A day goes by
and he doesn't respond.

306
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,037
What do you make of that?

307
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,865
He's busy.

308
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,475
I like her. Tell me
why I shouldn't.

309
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,216
MARISSA:
Jennifer Thomas, single mom,

310
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,046
43 years old, two kids and
you are going to hate this:

311
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,136
she works at an insurance
company as a claims manager.

312
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:25,054
Can I pick 'em
or can I pick 'em?

313
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:28,405
Probably spends her days looking
at inflated insurance claims.

314
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:30,973
She's the very definition
of what we don't want.

315
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,714
We'd like to thank and excuse
this juror, Your Honor.

316
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,414
Personally?

317
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,156
I hate it when people
don't respond to my e-mails.

318
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,766
Why is that?

319
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,944
Well, they're trying to tell me
that I don't matter.

320
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,295
I guess I figured
he didn't get the e-mail,

321
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,471
or maybe he deleted it
by accident.

322
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:53,474
Because anyone can make
an honest mistake, right?

323
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:54,736
Sure.

324
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:59,393
This juror's acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

325
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:03,005
Then, ladies and gentlemen,
we have our jury.

326
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:05,007
Trial will commence
tomorrow morning.

327
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,226
Court is adjourned.

328
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,360
This thing that you're doing,
it's not gonna work.

329
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,233
I didn't make a mistake.
I don't make mistakes.

330
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:16,149
You're making one now.

331
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,499
DANNY: So you were the lab tech
on the Malford autopsies?

332
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,153
It made my career. Julia's, too.

333
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,329
I hear she's a tough boss.

334
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,505
She's a little uptight.

335
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,855
But honestly, that's what
you need around here.

336
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,030
And who handled
the evidence

337
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,205
besides Julia?

338
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,641
No one.

339
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,295
Really?

340
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,211
Julia insisted
on doing it all herself.

341
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:37,039
All of it?

342
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,041
She was certified to test DNA?

343
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:42,262
She's kind of a control freak.

344
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:46,092
So she put the hair in the bag,
tested it, sealed it,

345
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,311
signed it into the storage
locker all by herself?

346
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,401
WILLIAMS:
Dr. Henson,

347
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,664
you were
the defendant's supervisor

348
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,318
during the Malford
investigation.

349
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:58,060
There was a team of us
working on it,

350
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,410
looking for something
of forensic value.

351
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,586
And you didn't find anything,
did you?

352
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,023
No.

353
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,242
But then, something happened.

354
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:10,507
Dr. Martin stayed on after
we completed the autopsy.

355
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,988
A few hours later,
she notified me,

356
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,121
said she found a hair.

357
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:17,210
We were all stunned.

358
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,689
Why?

359
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:21,736
Well, we had searched every inch
of the victim's body.

360
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,825
But you were pleased.Of course.

361
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,305
We all wanted to put an end

362
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:28,221
to this horrible string
of sexual attacks and murders.

363
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:31,224
So you were proud of Dr. Martin?

364
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:34,227
I was proud of our unit.

365
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:38,013
I sense some hesitation
on your behalf

366
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,015
with regard to Dr. Martin.

367
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,323
She has always been
very diligent.

368
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,715
Very determined.

369
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,980
But frankly, she was
very hard on people.

370
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,244
She could be quite arrogant.

371
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,161
Thank you.

372
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:56,684
Nothing further.

373
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,560
Good morning, Dr. Henson.

374
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:05,519
I just need you

375
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,521
to clear something up.

376
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,436
You know, in the whole time
that you ran

377
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:13,875
the medical examiner's office,
you never once did complain

378
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:17,096
about my client's job
performance, did you?

379
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,663
Not in any
performance review,

380
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:22,405
not even casually,
in a face-to-face with her, say,

381
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,233
in your office?

382
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:25,452
No.

383
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:27,758
And isn't it true
that she replaced you?

384
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:30,805
That she went from being your
subordinate to your supervisor?

385
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,894
That's not how
I would describe it.

386
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:35,549
Ah, well, how would
you describe it?

387
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:39,379
I mean, uh, one day,
she's working for you,

388
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:42,382
and the next day,
she's your boss.

389
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:45,080
It stands to reason
that you probably harbor

390
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,517
some resentment towards
Dr. Martin, wouldn't you say?

391
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:48,779
Objection.

392
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:50,781
Ask another question.

393
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:54,916
I mean, she fired you.

394
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,047
Didn't she?

395
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:57,136
Objection.

396
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,007
What's the relevance?

397
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,791
It goes to bias, Your Honor.

398
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:04,273
Dr. Henson is using this
courtroom to settle a score.

399
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:06,188
JUDGE:
Overruled.

400
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:07,668
Please answer the question.

401
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:11,237
We had differences of opinion
on a number of cases.

402
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,066
But she has the right to work
with whomever she chooses.

403
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:21,029
I will admit that I did not like
the way she operated the unit.

404
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:25,512
In my opinion,
she was obsessive.

405
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,818
Determined to solve any
case, no matter what.

406
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:32,127
Sometimes even if the forensics
did not bear her out.

407
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,955
BENNY:
But again,

408
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,392
that is your opinion.

409
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:41,397
The opinion of the man she
replaced and ultimately fired.

410
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,053
Just my opinion.

411
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:47,621
No further questions,
Your Honor.

412
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,714
This is the last of it.

413
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,847
Every piece of information
about the hair that exists.

414
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:59,328
Your original analysis,
your second analysis,

415
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:03,027
the independent analysis,
photos, storage data.

416
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,687
Anything jumping out at you?

417
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:12,515
Not yet.

418
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,691
I'm not trying to get out
of anything, but honestly,

419
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:17,216
I have no idea
what I'm reading here.

420
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,478
Just give it to me.

421
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,524
You, too.
Give me yours.

422
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:33,014
You don't have to sit here.
I don't need a babysitter.

423
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,453
I'll be in my office.

424
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,368
I'll be in my bed.

425
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,125
Should I come back?

426
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:59,301
Of course not. What's up?

427
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:00,563
Pollen.

428
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:02,522
Excuse me?

429
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,785
The hair all the outside labs
have been testing

430
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,091
is covered with pollen.

431
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,442
And that matters because...?

432
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,357
Well, to begin with,
it makes me wonder

433
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,750
whether the hair is actually
a pubic hair at all.

434
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:17,145
And if so, how it possibly
came into contact with pollen.

435
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:20,540
Well, I'm sure,
with a little imagination,

436
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,716
someone will come up
with a scenario.

437
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:26,241
Emily was murdered
in the dead of winter.

438
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:30,506
And in the dead of winter,
there is no pollen.

439
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:35,511
This is not the hair
I found on Emily's body.

440
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,128
CHUNK:
Dr. Martin,

441
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,695
isn't it true that
the night that you

442
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:49,177
found the sole piece of DNA
evidence against Mr. Malford,

443
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,353
that everyone had gone home

444
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:54,138
and you were completely alone
with the victim's body?

445
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:56,750
Yes.And do you regularly

446
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,969
perform autopsies alone,

447
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:01,363
late at night, when everyone's
gone home for the day?

448
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:02,625
Yes.

449
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,497
And why is that?

450
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,326
I have a really
particular skill set,

451
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,371
and I find
that skill set works best

452
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:11,330
when there's just two of us
in the room.

453
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,680
Myself, and the cadaver.

454
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:17,640
Other people really just end up
being distractions.

455
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:20,382
All right.
Let's talk about that.

456
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,558
When you say that other people
are distractions,

457
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:26,083
it sounds very... negative.

458
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,302
Very dismissive.

459
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,912
One could easily get
the impression

460
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:31,132
that you just don't like people.

461
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:34,483
And we want the
jurors to like you.

462
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,094
And it helps if they think
you might like them.

463
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:40,359
I don't know them.

464
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,664
Of course.

465
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:46,408
Okay, um, let's forget
that line of thinking.

466
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,976
Here's another reason
why saying you find

467
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,196
other people distracting might
not serve your best interests:

468
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,198
anything that makes it sound
like you don't like

469
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,418
having people around
when you do your work

470
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,420
might make the jurors
think that you don't

471
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,205
want company because
it makes it harder

472
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,512
to manipulate evidence.

473
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:06,863
You see that, right?

474
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,431
I don't manipulate evidence.I know that.

475
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,955
But you're-you're talking
to people who don't know you.

476
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:15,394
So how would you suggest
I answer that?

477
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:19,223
Well, maybe there's another
reason you work late

478
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,443
that wouldn't lead them
to the same conclusion.

479
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:25,099
Maybe you find it
impossible to sleep

480
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,448
when there are grieving
friends and relatives

481
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,407
out there waiting for answers

482
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,235
as to what happened
to their loved ones?

483
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,413
I can't say that.
That's-that's not the truth.

484
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,023
Maybe there's a truth

485
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:39,069
that's more palatable
to the jury.

486
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:44,466
Mr. Palmer, I'm a scientist,
and scientists deal with facts.

487
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,078
There is one truth,
there's one right answer.

488
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:52,474
If you ask me a question, I am
going to give you that truth.

489
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,563
As to whether it's palatable,

490
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,783
that's not something
I've ever concerned myself with.

491
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,915
Well, it ought to be, because
you're gonna be spending

492
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:01,483
ten years in prison for
something that you didn't do

493
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,572
if we can't make the
jury understand

494
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,226
your side of the story.

495
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,794
Okay, again, there is
no "my side" of the story.

496
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:09,186
There is what happened,

497
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,450
and there is
what did not happen.

498
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:15,018
There is truth and fact,
and there is falsehood.

499
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:18,544
You can't spin the truth,
you cannot polish it up

500
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:21,460
or put lipstick on a pig,
which is what I feel like

501
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,722
you're trying to do
to me right now.

502
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:24,463
I am what I am.

503
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,595
I did what I did, and I don't
regret a minute of it

504
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:30,512
because I did it
all by the book.

505
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:32,993
So are we done here?

506
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:36,257
It certainly seems that way.

507
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,693
You talk to Chunk?Sure did.

508
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,565
You still want to put her
on the stand?

509
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,001
I do.

510
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,916
He said that
she's fundamentally incapable

511
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:45,527
of shading her answers
even one iota.

512
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:48,399
Even at the risk of sending
herself to prison.

513
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:50,358
I'm waiting for the bad news.

514
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:52,578
I'm pretty sure I just
gave you the bad news.

515
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:55,276
So the truth is, this woman
can't even fudge the facts

516
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,973
to keep herself out of jail.

517
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:59,541
Now we just have to get a jury
to understand that that means

518
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,587
she couldn't possibly
have fudged them

519
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,111
to put someone else behind bars.

520
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:05,547
BENNY:
We've heard a lot

521
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:08,681
about the fact
that you like to work alone

522
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,683
and often late at night.

523
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:12,554
Can you please tell us

524
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:15,209
why that's your practice,
Dr. Martin?

525
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:19,039
I'm not good with people.

526
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:23,086
I know how
that sounds.

527
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,393
Trust me, it's not made me
a lot of friends.

528
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,702
But I am good
at my job.

529
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:32,139
I'm great at my job.

530
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:34,228
And in order to be
the best at my job,

531
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,012
I have to be able
to concentrate.

532
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:38,972
I have to know that every single
step of that process

533
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:42,279
was done
with precision and care.

534
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:44,934
And if I do every step myself,
I don't have to worry

535
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:46,588
that it wasn't done properly.

536
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:49,504
I don't have to worry

537
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,985
that I offended someone
because I criticized them

538
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:53,987
for making a mistake.

539
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,597
Or that I forgot
to praise someone

540
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,773
for just doing their job.

541
00:25:57,817 --> 00:26:02,430
So what do you say
to the allegations

542
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,650
that you falsified evidence

543
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:07,609
in order to get a conviction
against John Malford?

544
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:10,003
I would say that's ridiculous.

545
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,440
I don't care about John Malford.

546
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:15,051
I have never cared
about who gets convicted.

547
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:17,445
That's not
a win for me.

548
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:20,230
A win for me is finding
the right answer.

549
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:23,973
It's solving the puzzle,
it's making the crime stop.

550
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,628
I do crosswords a lot.

551
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:29,675
And they have
these new apps now.

552
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:32,721
If you get stuck, you can prompt
it, and it'll give you a word,

553
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:34,331
or it will give you a letter.

554
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,465
And I would...
I would just never do that.

555
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:40,120
I would never
want to do that,

556
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:43,340
because having
a filled-out crossword,

557
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,734
that does nothing for me.

558
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:50,783
But solving it myself, that's
the part that's satisfying.

559
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:55,657
So no, I would never falsify
evidence to get a conviction,

560
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:59,182
because then I would
never really know who did it.

561
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:01,707
I wouldn't solve the puzzle.

562
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,754
If you cheat,
you never find the truth.

563
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:10,759
Marissa?

564
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:12,456
MARISSA:
No movement yet,

565
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,894
but they clearly want
to believe her.

566
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:17,592
Baby steps.

567
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:22,641
I'm starting to think Chunk
doesn't know his own strength.

568
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,425
Kept telling me she was
hopeless, but he actually

569
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:27,646
turned her into
a very effective witness.

570
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:32,346
Ah, speak of the devil.Oh...

571
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,696
What have we here?

572
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,611
TAYLOR:
Well,

573
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,787
I wasn't able to connect Malford
directly to any of the people

574
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:40,702
who worked at the medical
examiner's office,

575
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:43,357
but then Danny had a great idea.DANNY: Serial killers

576
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,576
like Malford tend to attract
obsessive fans.

577
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,143
Total strangers who begin
to believe they have

578
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:49,363
an intimate relationship
with these killers.

579
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:51,365
Excessive adoration disorder.

580
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:53,541
Oh, yeah.
I've heard of this.

581
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:57,284
Crazy ladies who marry prisoners
they've never met before.

582
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:59,678
Well, they're not all ladies
and they don't all get married,

583
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:02,376
but yes, that's what
we're talking about.

584
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,812
Malford hasn't had a
jailhouse wedding yet,

585
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:06,293
but he does have
quite the fan club.

586
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:08,599
TAYLOR: Our guy's gotten
thousands of letters,

587
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,558
and he's responded
to hundreds of them.

588
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:12,473
CHUNK: The good news is,
Sing Sing keeps a scan

589
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:13,692
of all incoming
and outgoing mail,

590
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,911
and they gave Taylor access.

591
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:18,174
Any one of these admirers
sound like they'd be willing

592
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:19,741
to help Malford
break out of prison?

593
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:20,960
TAYLOR:
Oh, yeah.

594
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:22,744
There's no shortage of those.

595
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,094
But we're still talking
about over two dozen people.

596
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:26,705
The math is not encouraging.

597
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,532
More than 80 people had access

598
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,578
to the evidence
storage facility.

599
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,145
More than two dozen crazies
writing love letters.

600
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,887
BENNY: That's a
lot of leads

601
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,280
to be running down in
the middle of a trial.

602
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:39,239
We don't have the time.

603
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:40,893
I'm betting a day,
maybe two,

604
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:44,113
before the judge forces
us to rest our case.

605
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:46,899
Maybe we should just
go right to the source.

606
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,510
Excuse me?

607
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:51,860
See how early Benny and I
can get into Sing Sing tomorrow

608
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,775
to talk with John Malford.

609
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:56,778
Uh-- John Malford?
Seriously?

610
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:59,868
Yeah. Sometimes the shortest
distance between two points

611
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:01,478
is a straight line.

612
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,829
We need to figure out
who's helping this guy

613
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,484
break out of prison;
why don't we just go ask him?

614
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:17,756
So what's
the game plan here, boss?

615
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,845
I just want to look him
in the eye, see what I see.

616
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,847
Maybe he'll offer something
useful, maybe he won't.

617
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,501
Serial killers tend to be
outsized narcissists.

618
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:27,113
Nothing they like to talk
about more than themselves.

619
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:29,376
I just want to
get him talking.

620
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,948
Ryan, good to see you.

621
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:37,906
I didn't know you'd
be joining us.

622
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,125
Benny, Dr. Bull, pleasure.

623
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,998
When the prison informed me
you'd requested a meeting,

624
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,783
I thought it wise to sit in.

625
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,088
BULL:
Of course.

626
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:47,916
Just to be clear,
this was all very last minute.

627
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,092
Nobody's trying to
pull a fast one...

628
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,920
Never even crossed my mind.

629
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:54,009
Just want to be certain
everyone remembers,

630
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,924
my client isn't on trial.

631
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,230
Yours is.

632
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,015
Oh, I think we're all
very clear about that.

633
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:03,584
You must be Mr. Malford.

634
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:05,629
Yeah. John.

635
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,022
Who are you?

636
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,110
RYAN: These are the
gentlemen representing

637
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:09,677
the medical examiner

638
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,853
who falsified the evidence
that got you locked up, John.

639
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:13,246
Hmm.

640
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:14,900
RYAN:
So...

641
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:16,815
what can we do for you?

642
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,381
Well, we just wanted
to get a look at the man

643
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:20,557
who's at the center of our case.

644
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:22,429
How you holding up
in here, John?

645
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,605
Holding up good.

646
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:27,782
Working out, food's okay.

647
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,784
How's your head?

648
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,656
You lonely?
You have any friends?

649
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,920
Oh, yeah. I got friends.

650
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:36,791
Inside and outside.

651
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,619
BULL:
Aha.

652
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:40,621
How do you mean, "outside"?

653
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:41,883
Oh, you know.

654
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:46,496
I get letters, pictures.
People want to visit.

655
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,500
Want to, um, make friends.

656
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,894
Women.
Mm.

657
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:57,072
Oh. That sounds like a...
great life.

658
00:30:57,116 --> 00:31:00,641
Some of those pictures
are naked.

659
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:02,948
RYAN: So, you two working
for the prison now?

660
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,733
Hmm? Conducting a customer
satisfaction survey?

661
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:07,996
The point is, John here's
been a model prisoner,

662
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,042
he's adapted to prison life
flawlessly.

663
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:13,567
Not a black mark on his record
to hinder his appeal.

664
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,483
Ah. Right. John's appeal.

665
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,920
Hey, I-I've got to ask,

666
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:21,618
why even bother
with the appeal?

667
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:23,751
You seem so content.

668
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:25,100
Because he's innocent.

669
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:27,146
JOHN:
What do I care

670
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:30,149
if this guy wants to
push some papers around?

671
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:31,411
No skin off my back.

672
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:32,934
I mean, what's the worst
thing that happens?

673
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:36,111
I actually... get out?

674
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:38,984
You're right.

675
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:40,724
No harm, no foul.

676
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:44,293
This has been great.

677
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:47,383
Really... helpful.

678
00:31:47,427 --> 00:31:49,168
Mr. Vance.

679
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,387
Mr. Malford.

680
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:55,870
Hey, why'd you cut bait
like that?

681
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,959
The guy was just warming up.

682
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:00,135
Maybe we could've gotten a name,

683
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,311
maybe found our inside man
at the morgue.

684
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:05,053
There is no name.

685
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:06,750
There is no inside man
at the morgue.

686
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:07,969
How do you mean?

687
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,191
Did Malford seem like
he'd even contemplated

688
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:13,714
life outside of prison?

689
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:16,369
No. It didn't seem like

690
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:18,937
he actually cared much
about his appeal at all.

691
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,982
Exactly. He also showed
very little interest

692
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,201
in Julia's case.

693
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:24,420
Now, if this guy spent
the last six years

694
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:27,858
hatching this scheme and
manipulating some admirer

695
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:29,295
to do his bidding,
don't you think he'd be

696
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,297
a little more invested
in the fruits of his labor?

697
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,821
So, Malford didn't do it?

698
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:36,084
Malford didn't change
the evidence?

699
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,520
Back to square one?

700
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:40,480
Maybe not.

701
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:43,091
Malford might have no
interest in Julia's case,

702
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:46,312
but someone put
this thing in motion.

703
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:48,314
Who do you mean?

704
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,752
Ryan? No.

705
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:54,450
Ryan's his lawyer.
He's just doing his job.

706
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:57,366
You don't think it strange
that he was there

707
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,152
at that meeting just now,
or that he has been

708
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,719
in court every day
of Julia's trial?

709
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,375
I don't know, Bull.

710
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,249
Ryan is not my favorite guy,

711
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:13,121
but what does he care
if Julia goes down?

712
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:15,254
I'm not sure.

713
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:16,864
I'm just telling you
what I see.

714
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,263
Since we moved off
the fangirl theory

715
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,134
and onto Malford's lawyer,

716
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,918
I circled back
to the 80 people

717
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:29,833
who had access to the
evidence storage facility

718
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:31,835
at the medical examiner's
office to see if I could

719
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,402
try to find some
kind of link.

720
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:35,839
We never did do a deep dive
into any of their finances,

721
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,450
because Malford was broke,

722
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:39,495
so it didn't seem
particularly relevant.

723
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:43,499
But Malford's attorney,
Mr. Ryan Vance, Esquire, is not.

724
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,197
He has plenty of money
to pay off

725
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,981
an overworked,
underpaid lab tech.

726
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,809
Like Skylar Brown.

727
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:51,594
Skylar was wrestling with a
significant amount of debt.

728
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,727
She maxed out four
credit cards and has

729
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,294
two delinquent
homeowner loans.

730
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:57,513
But, coincidentally,
Skylar seems to have had

731
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:59,472
a financial windfall,

732
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:01,126
just three weeks prior

733
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:02,649
to the independent analysis
of Malford's hair.

734
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:05,739
A cash deposit,
$60,000,

735
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,262
straight into her
personal checking account.

736
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:11,005
Hmm. Okay, $60,000 question.

737
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,094
Can we tie any of this cash
back to Ryan Vance?

738
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,618
Not yet, but we are
gonna keep at it.

739
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,795
I feel the heat all
the way over here.

740
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,101
Something not
clicking for you?

741
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:24,062
I got everything but the "why."

742
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:27,108
Why would a successful attorney
like Ryan Vance

743
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:31,417
put his entire livelihood,
his entire legacy on the line

744
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,247
for a rapist and a murderer
like John Malford?

745
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,118
So...

746
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:39,338
why frame Julia?

747
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:41,557
Why go to all the trouble?

748
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,951
Why risk putting
a homicidal sexual predator

749
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,997
back on the street, earn
the enmity of the D.A.'s office

750
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:51,915
by forcing them to reopen every
case where Julia's evidence

751
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,961
put someone away?

752
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,705
Why?

753
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:00,968
What are you thinking?

754
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,926
Taylor, how long
do you think it'd take

755
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,668
to get a list
of Ryan Vance's other clients?

756
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:08,149
The other clients that are
currently incarcerated?

757
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,934
I'm kind of
in the middle of something...

758
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:13,589
I don't care. I want that list.

759
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,243
BENNY:
With Your Honor's approval,

760
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:18,725
we'd like to call the person
sitting in the third row,

761
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:22,598
John Malford's attorney
Ryan Vance, to the stand.

762
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:24,426
JUDGE: Has the defense
subpoenaed Mr. Vance?

763
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,862
We don't typically allow

764
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:28,474
those seated in the gallery
to testify.

765
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,084
Yes, we're aware of that,
Your Honor.

766
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,217
But we're hoping
that the court will see fit

767
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,349
to grant us this approval.RYAN: Your Honor,

768
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:36,351
I'm sorry, I-- this is the first
I'm hearing of this.

769
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,570
BENNY:
Mr. Vance's

770
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,702
petition
for the independent analysis

771
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:41,617
of the Malford
evidence

772
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,228
initiated this whole trial.

773
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:45,882
I'd merely like him to speak

774
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:49,277
to the history of how
that new analysis came to be.

775
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:53,281
All right. I'll allow it.

776
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:56,589
BENNY: So Mr. Vance,
when you requested

777
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:58,591
an independent examination
of the evidence

778
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:02,377
in the John Malford case,
did you know a negative match

779
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:06,076
would call into question
the professional conduct

780
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,167
and scientific expertise
of my client,

781
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,299
Dr. Julia Martin?

782
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:12,953
That would be
a natural consequence.

783
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:15,347
She did perform
the original analysis.

784
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,788
Isn't it true

785
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:25,183
that other cases will be
reexamined as a result

786
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:27,707
of Dr. Martin's prosecution?

787
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,972
Countless other criminals,
murderers, rapists and thieves

788
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:34,453
are going to file for dismissal
of their sentences.

789
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:37,195
As well they should be, yes.

790
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:42,809
Ah. I-Isn't it also true
that you are the sole owner

791
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:48,162
of Barnaby Bank
account number 00403010?

792
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,556
I don't know, I...
It very well could be.

793
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,166
I don't have
my account number memorized.

794
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,518
I do bank at Barnaby,
so yes, I suppose.

795
00:36:56,562 --> 00:37:01,219
A-And isn't it also true that
you withdrew $60,000 in cash

796
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:03,525
on September 21st
from this account?

797
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:05,832
Again, it's months ago.

798
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,312
I don't have
every transaction memorized,

799
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:10,053
so yes, it's possible,
it sounds possible.

800
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,926
If you say so.

801
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:15,015
Well, it's not me saying it.

802
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:16,712
Your Honor,

803
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:19,585
these are Mr. Vance's
bank records

804
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:22,283
for the month of September.

805
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:26,026
I'd ask that you mark them

806
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,115
as defense exhibit
number 14.

807
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:29,725
So marked.

808
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:34,164
And lastly,
do you know a Skylar Brown?

809
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,471
RYAN:
Uh...

810
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:39,518
Uh, name rings a bell.
I-I can't be certain, though.

811
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:41,998
Well, she's an employee
of the medical examiner's office

812
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,828
with full access
to all evidence storage.

813
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:48,744
Including DNA samples.Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

814
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:51,138
I'm moments away,
Your Honor, I promise.

815
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,271
I certainly hope so. Overruled.

816
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:54,663
Isn't it strange

817
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:58,493
that just two days after
you made your withdrawal,

818
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:01,104
Skylar Brown paid off
all of her credit cards,

819
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:04,107
her delinquent loans?

820
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:06,849
All of her
outstanding debts?

821
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:11,898
Following a deposit
of exactly $60,000 in cash

822
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:13,682
into her
checking account?

823
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:17,817
I wouldn't say strange.
I might say coincidental.

824
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,254
Ah.

825
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,038
How old were you
when your brother

826
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:23,388
was convicted of murder?

827
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:28,828
I really don't think
that has anything to do

828
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:30,395
with the business at hand.

829
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:35,051
I-Isn't your brother Trevor
one of your clients?

830
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:40,274
And wasn't the evidence in his
case also assessed by my client,

831
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,624
Dr. Julia Martin?

832
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:45,323
And if Dr. Martin
is found guilty,

833
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:48,151
isn't Trevor's conviction
likely to be overturned,

834
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,328
just like John Malford's?

835
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,112
And isn't that
why you paid

836
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:56,812
Skylar Brown $60,000,

837
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:58,205
to replace the hair
that was used

838
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:01,251
to convict your client,
John Malford?

839
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,127
JUDGE:
Mr. Vance,

840
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,172
do you need
the question repeated?

841
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:13,394
Oh, that's all right,
Your Honor.

842
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:16,441
I think the jury already has
their answer.

843
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:18,181
No further questions.

844
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:25,580
Is the prosecution prepared
to cross-examine the witness?

845
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:32,631
Actually, no.

846
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,766
But we are prepared,
based on Ryan Vance's testimony

847
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,291
and the evidence presented
by Mr. Colón,

848
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:42,641
to withdraw our charges

849
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,643
against Dr. Martin...

850
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:47,950
...and offer our apologies.

851
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:01,399
Thank you.You're welcome.

852
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:24,552
Oh, Dr. Martin, it's 2:00 in the
morning, and I heard a noise.

853
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:27,990
No one else is here, you know,
and I was just about to leave.

854
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:29,905
You gonna be okay?

855
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:32,908
I'm going to be perfect.
