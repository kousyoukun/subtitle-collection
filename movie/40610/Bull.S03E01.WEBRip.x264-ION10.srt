So, who do we have here?

00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,934
This is Julia Summerfield.

147
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:54,326
Lives in Nevada.

148
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,980
Married mother of
two preschoolers.

149
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,634
Works from her home
doing data entry.

150
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:00,332
During the birth
of her youngest,

151
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,292
doctors discovered
she had endometrial cancer.

152
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:06,774
Soon as the baby was born,
they put Julia on chemo.

153
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,690
Then they operated,
surgically removed the cancer.

154
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,474
Or so they thought.

155
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:13,345
It was only later
that they realized

156
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,912
the cancer spread to her liver.

157
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,740
She went back into
the hospital last year

158
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,133
for microwave
treatments,

159
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,701
and there was
a horrible accident.

160
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:23,660
The treatment left a hole in
her liver the size of an apple.

161
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:25,053
My God.

162
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,142
Given how badly her immune
system had been taxed

163
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:31,320
by her earlier cancers, her
prognosis was pretty dire.

164
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,322
Without a liver transplant,

165
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:36,499
she was given only a year

00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:20,832
[sighs]

322
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,791
Found out late last night
that the plaintiff,

323
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,488
Mrs. Summerfield,

324
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,316
moved for
an emergency hearing

325
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,928
based on her declining
physical condition,

326
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,930
and the judge
granted the motion,

327
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,932
and we start voir dire tomorrow.

328
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,413
Okay. Talk us
through it.

329
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:39,068
Well, to begin with,
it's a civil trial,

330
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,549
which means we're only looking
at a six-person jury.

331
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,203
And for the plaintiff to win,

332
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,988
they require at least five of
those jurors to agree with them,

333
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,598
which means all we need to do

334
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,861
is convince two people
to side with us.

335
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:52,429
BENNY:
Oh.

336
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,344
Is that all?Yeah.

337
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:59,262
Ah. So here we are,
sitting in the courtroom,

338
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:01,612
Mrs. Summerfield behind
the plaintiff's table,

339
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:04,093
a dying mother
with a hole in her liver. Say hi to Mommy.

340
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,139
Who are these magical jurors
we're looking for,

341
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,488
who are gonna see past

342
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:10,839
a dying human being
pleading for her life

343
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,973
and sympathize with our client, the insurance company?

344
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,540
That sounds like a tall order
for voir dire.

345
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:17,715
BULL:
Maybe.

346
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,369
Maybe not.

347
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,023
So what would you have me ask?

348
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,330
I would have you say...

349
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,158
BULL:
Good morning.

350
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,986
Good morning.

351
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,858
You a mother?I am.

352
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,121
So I gather, like the rest
of us, you feel terrible

353
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:33,601
for Mrs. Summerfield?

354
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,692
I do.

355
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,999
You okay if we play
a game of pretend?

356
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,740
Okay.

357
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:45,526
BENNY:
So...

358
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,702
you're standing
at the edge of a dock.

359
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,008
You can't swim.

360
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,401
Two people in front of
you are in the water,

361
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,881
and they're drowning.

362
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,187
You only have
one life preserver.

363
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,579
Who do you throw it to?

364
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,974
Who do you throw it to?

365
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,628
Well, you haven't given me
any information

366
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,108
about the people
that are drowning.

367
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:04,893
I mean, how can you ask me
to make that decision?

368
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,286
You have to make that decision.

369
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,331
Two people in front of you
are drowning.

370
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,117
In three minutes,
they're going to be dead.

371
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,815
You can ask me a question,
I'll tell you what I know,

372
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,077
but time's a-wastin'.

373
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,123
Um, is one older than the other?

374
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,776
From where
you're standing,

375
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,215
one appears to be in their 70s
and the other one in their 20s.

376
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:25,087
Well, I kind of have to save
the 20-year-old, don't I?

377
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:29,961
I mean, he or she might have
50 or 60 more years.

378
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,964
The swimmer in their 70s,
maybe ten.

379
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,837
Then do it, do it.
Throw that life preserver.

380
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,363
Okay. I did it.

381
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,670
All right. [chuckles]

382
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:45,542
Good for you.
You just saved someone's life.

383
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:46,891
One more question.

384
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,893
Sure.

385
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,852
Would it be fair
if I prosecute you

386
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,332
for the murder
of the 70-year-old?

387
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:55,552
[chuckles]:
No, no, that's okay.

388
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,032
You don't have to answer that.

389
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,556
This juror is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

390
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,950
You just got to do that
two or three more times,

391
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,952
and we got a jury
we can win with.

392
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,002
So having successfully
treated Mrs. Summerfield

393
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:13,396
for her endometrial cancer,

394
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,572
you realized the cancer
had spread to her liver?

395
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,314
Yes, we discovered it
in its earliest stages,

396
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:21,883
and really felt confident
that we'd be able to treat it.

397
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:24,364
And you used a technique
called microwave ablation.

398
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,061
Can you explain how that works?

399
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,367
MARISSA [over earbud]:
I know how hard it was

400
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,716
to put together
a jury that would

401
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,892
even consider the
possibility that our client

402
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,155
might be in the right,
but at the moment,

403
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,462
I am seeing nothing but red.

404
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:37,377
BENDRY: ...with pinpoint
amounts of microwaves.

405
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,379
The microwave creates

406
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:41,903
intense heat, just like
it does in an oven,

407
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:44,558
and that heat
kills the cancer.

408
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,473
But that didn't happen
with Mrs. Summerfield.

409
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:49,084
No.

410
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,434
Our instruments malfunctioned,
and we delivered

411
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:54,524
about 40 times the level of heat
that was required,

412
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:57,875
and ended up destroying
a vast portion of her liver.

413
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,269
And is there a way
to rectify that?

414
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,053
Not really.

415
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:04,012
Not short of getting her
a new liver.

416
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,448
Which you'd like
to see happen?

417
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:08,799
I would. In fact,
even though Mrs. Summerfield

418
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:11,541
is suing us for
malpractice, I...

419
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,457
my whole team has offered
to waive their fees.

420
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,547
Anything to make
her surgery possible.

421
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,593
And the hospital where
we performed the procedure

422
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:22,378
has indicated they, too,
would like to help out,

423
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,075
waive certain costs.

424
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,121
WRIGHT: So if everyone
is pitching in,

425
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,992
if everyone wants
to see this happen,

426
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,820
what is standing in the way
of Mrs. Summerfield

427
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:31,648
getting the new liver
she requires?

428
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:35,217
Well, you can't just
order them up on Amazon Prime.

429
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,219
They're harvested
from healthy people

430
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:38,699
who meet an untimely end

431
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:40,831
and whose families
are willing to donate them,

432
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,093
which makes their availability

433
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,965
unpredictable.

434
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:45,793
Also, not just
any liver will do.

435
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,012
The liver has to be carefully
matched to the patient,

436
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,927
or the patient's body
rejects it.

437
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:53,017
All of which makes the process
of finding a liver

438
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,628
and all the necessary
testing and follow-up

439
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,760
very, very time-consuming

440
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:59,154
and very expensive.How expensive?

441
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,679
Anywhere from
$400,000 to $500,000.

442
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:05,116
[gallery murmuring quietly]

443
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,817
And without that transplant,

444
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,341
how long is Mrs. Summerfield
expected to live?

Come on, squirt,

Come on, handsome.[Lucas talks quietly]

452
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:39,194
MARISSA: I know it's not
technically possible,

453
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,500
but I'd almost swear

454
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:43,546
our six red jurors
got even redder.

455
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,643
Will the witness please
answer the question?

456
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,735
Without a transplant,

457
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:04,132
I believe life expectancy
is roughly four months.

458
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:05,916
Four months.

459
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,615
16 weeks.

460
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:11,922
No further questions,
Your Honor.

461
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,840
[Benny clears throat]

462
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:19,582
Thank you for your
testimony, Dr. Bendry.

463
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,628
Appreciate you taking
the time to be here,

464
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:25,588
and appreciate you offering
your services for free

465
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,590
to try to undo
the horrible situation

466
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,331
that Mrs. Summerfield
finds herself in.

467
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,246
You're welcome.

468
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,293
Just... one question.

469
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,383
What if it was
suddenly possible

470
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:40,647
for Mrs. Summerfield
to have the operation

471
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,605
you're saying she needs?

472
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:46,087
We find her a liver,
everything is paid for,

473
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,350
the operation's a success...

474
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:52,006
How long would you estimate
that she would live?

475
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,791
Ten years, 20 years,
30 years?

476
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,359
Objection. Counsel is
asking the witness to speculate.

477
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,230
The counsel
is asking the witness

478
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,798
for his expertise, Your Honor.

479
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,322
Objection overruled.

480
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,501
The witness will answer
the question.

481
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:13,332
Three years.
Maybe three and a half.

482
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,072
The first cancer took
a terrible toll on her,

483
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:17,597
and now this second one...

484
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,644
So 36 months, maybe 42.

485
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:25,256
And how much did you say
the operation would cost?

486
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,477
Between 400,000 and 500,000.

487
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,566
Half a million?

488
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:34,353
Got it.

489
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,833
No further questions,
Your Honor.

490
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,273
Nice.

491
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:43,492
MARISSA [over earbud]:
Chunk, Danny and I

492
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:45,146
all really thought it was
a huge mistake

493
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:47,191
to put a price tag
on the woman's life,

494
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,932
but then I just looked up,

495
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:52,196
and one of our red jurors
actually turned green.

496
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,809
Now the trick is not to lose
him or her along the way.

497
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:57,332
WRIGHT:
Let's talk about 42 months.

498
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,204
Some people might argue that
that doesn't seem like

499
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:01,771
a very long time,

500
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:03,469
particularly given
how scarce livers are...

501
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:07,386
how much it will cost
to do the surgery.

502
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,431
In 42 months,

503
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,868
my five-year-old son
will be in third grade.

504
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:14,436
If I get 42 more months,

505
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,178
I'll be able to see him
walk to school

506
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:18,701
through all four seasons
of the year

507
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,399
another couple hundred times.

508
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:24,403
I could help him
learn to read,

509
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:27,188
show him how
to tie his shoes.

510
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:30,409
And my little girl, Maura,

511
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,411
she'll be in first grade.

512
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,849
We'll get to buy
school supplies together,

513
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:38,068
make Halloween costumes.

514
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:41,637
I could teach her
how to brush her hair.

515
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:49,297
It's three more Christmases
and six more birthday parties.

516
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:56,522
Maybe I'll get to see them
ride bikes and ice skate

517
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:59,916
and swim with floaties.

518
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,570
Maybe even without.

519
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:07,881
But most of all,

520
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:10,013
I'll be able to
kiss them good night

521
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:13,364
over a thousand times more.

522
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:17,586
WRIGHT: We have no further
questions, Your Honor.

523
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,719
JUDGE:
Very well, then...

524
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:22,765
[sighs] ...let's take
a 20-minute recess.

525
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,288
[gavel bangs]

526
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:27,248
Hi, guys.
Come here.

527
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,119
Hello.

528
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,295
How are you guys?

529
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,167
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna pay for parking.Okay.

530
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,647
How are you guys doing?

531
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,345
Is Daddy taking good care of you
out here in the hall?

532
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:38,477
CHILDREN:
Yes.

533
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,695
Good.

534
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:42,655
I have to go to the bathroom.Right now?

535
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:46,441
Honey, Daddy just went to go
put money in the meter.

536
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,877
Can you wait till
he gets back?

537
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:51,315
No, I have to go right now.

538
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,708
But, honey, I can't
take you in the men's room,

539
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,144
and you're too big to go
in the ladies' room,

540
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:55,624
and this is New York City.

541
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:57,539
BULL: You know,
I can take him.

542
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,194
I couldn't help
but overhear.

543
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:02,849
I could take him to the men's.
I'll keep an eye on him.

544
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:07,506
You okay in there?
Yes.

545
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,638
Don't forget to flush.

546
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,901
[toilet flushes]

547
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:15,992
All right.
Wash your hands.

548
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:17,733
There's the soap.

549
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,779
Attaboy.

550
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:22,521
Are you a friend
of my mommy?

551
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,959
Uh... no.
Not really.

552
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:28,004
But you like her, right?

553
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,357
My daddy says my mommy's job
is to make sure everybody

554
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,490
in that room likes her.

555
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:50,505
I want to start the case
tomorrow by putting Hitchcock

556
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,291
on the stand, try and get
the jury to understand

557
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:56,598
what goes into making
a decision like this.

558
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,600
Okay.

559
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:01,472
I know what to do with that.
Then what?

560
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:03,562
Well, God may get me
for saying this, but...

561
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:04,606
do we go after the mother?

562
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,868
What do you mean?

563
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,262
Well, I'm just saying
maybe she contributed

564
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:10,003
to her current condition
somehow.

565
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,396
Drinking or drugs or...She didn't.

566
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,877
I checked.
She's a church girl.

567
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:16,966
Clean as a whistle.And even if she wasn't,

568
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,402
we don't want to go after
a dying mother

569
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,621
with a hole in her liver.

570
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,405
Not gonna win any hearts
and minds that way.

571
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:22,711
Hear, hear.

572
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,844
I'm just trying
to do my job.

573
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,368
Although...

574
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:32,678
...how many people our there are
waiting for liver transplants?

575
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,984
There are currently
17,000 people

576
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:37,030
waiting for
a liver transplant.

577
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:39,989
And, on average, how long
do they have to wait?

578
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,296
Last time they counted,
the average wait time

579
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,646
was 321 days.

580
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,127
Reach out to EquiSafe Insurance.

581
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,259
Get me the names of everyone
waiting for a liver,

582
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:51,087
how long they're
expected to live

583
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:52,219
and how long they've
been waiting.

584
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,177
And also, get me
the names of everyone

585
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:56,527
who was waiting for a liver,

586
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:58,094
but didn't make it.

587
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,546
How's it going
on the Cable front?

588
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,810
Uh, well, she's

589
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:20,290
officially on the FBI's list
of missing persons

590
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,857
as of today.

591
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:24,207
Her mom's, uh, a mess.

592
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:27,558
But, um, I have
one more idea

593
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:30,474
that I'm-I'm gonna
try tomorrow.

594
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:33,695
Well, let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

595
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:36,263
Let her mother know.

596
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:41,921
MARISSA:
I can't reach anyone
at EquiSafe,

597
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:43,357
but I will jump
back on it

598
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,359
first thing in the morning.

599
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:50,886
How's married life
treating you?

600
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,497
Come on, let me have it.

601
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,543
I know you've been dying
to give it to me all day.

602
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:57,893
Married life is good,
thank you very much.

603
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,242
I highly recommend it.

604
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,592
Yeah, I really think
it's gonna catch on.

605
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:04,726
Are you mad at me
for getting remarried?

606
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,294
Mm. maybe a little jealous.

607
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:10,253
Not like that.

608
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:12,255
Not jealous of your husband,

609
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:16,738
jealous... of your happiness?

610
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:21,047
Well, I don't know what
to do about that, Jason.

611
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:26,530
You know, when I was lying there
on those courthouse steps,

612
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:30,578
with this elephant
sitting on my chest...

613
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:36,758
I kept hearing this voice
in my head.

614
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:41,676
It was my ex-wife, telling me
that I'm no good alone.

615
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:46,942
She said that to me a week
before she got married again.

616
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,510
I'm starting to think
she might be right.

617
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,775
You really hate this case,
don't you?

618
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:56,604
We all do.

619
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,780
We all keep thinking,
"What if it were us?"

620
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:02,088
Three more years with
the people you love.

621
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:05,047
How do you put a price on that?

622
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:08,572
No. I'm sorry.

623
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:10,226
You're being myopic.

624
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,228
It's about the greater good.

625
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:14,753
It's about resources.

626
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:20,584
It's about making sure that
there's something for everyone.

627
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:25,676
And the simple fact is that
everyone can't have everything.

628
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,331
I know,
'cause I just went through...

629
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,769
I knew what
you went through.

630
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,596
I cried for weeks.

631
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,469
I prayed for weeks.

632
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:38,341
But Jason,
what happened to you

633
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:41,040
has nothing to do
with the rest of us.

634
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,957
How could you say that?

635
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,264
'Cause you're rich.

636
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:52,747
And yes, everybody gets it,
everybody can't have everything,

637
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,229
but it sure seems like
people like you,

638
00:29:56,272 --> 00:30:01,234
people like Mr. Hitchcock
always manage to get theirs.

639
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,241
I will do my best to get you
all that data from EquiSafe

640
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:10,286
first thing in the morning.

641
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,558
Look, I understand this
is a heartbreaking situation.

642
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,212
It is no fun to sit here

643
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:26,955
and look Mrs. Summerfield
in the eye and say no.

644
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:31,090
But according
to our actuaries

645
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:34,789
and our medical experts, the
chance for success is so low

646
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,923
and the chance for extended life
is so small

647
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:39,925
that it would be
irresponsible

648
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:43,754
for us to pay this claim
and allow this to go forward.

649
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:45,756
And can you explain that?

650
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,280
When you start

651
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:51,458
approving what amount
to Hail Mary medical procedures,

652
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:55,288
it inevitably drives up
premiums, so that people

653
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:58,857
with legitimate claims can't
afford to even buy insurance,

654
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,511
much less file a claim.

655
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:04,384
No further questions,
Your Honor.

656
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:05,820
JUDGE:
Thank you.

657
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,909
You may step down.

659

Do these people
give a damn about this?

660
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,178
They certainly don't appear to.

661
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:18,180
Got it.

662
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:20,704
And going forward, I'd
appreciate it if you'd reel in

663
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:22,924
your sense of self-satisfaction.

664
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,798
Mr. Toliver, how long have
you been waiting for a liver?

665
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:30,018
Going on 11 months.

666
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:32,151
So you've been waiting seven
months. And forgive me,

667
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:33,543
are you married?

668
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:35,894
No. Although I hope
to be, some day.

669
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,896
Obviously, no kids?Again,

670
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,550
maybe someday,
once I find my liver.

671
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:43,379
If they get to me, in time.

672
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:44,772
19 months.

673
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:47,209
So you've been waiting
19 months for your liver.

674
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:49,472
And what's your life expectancy
if you get one?

675
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:51,997
I've been told 30 to 35 years.

676
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,303
I've been told I could live
another 50 years.

677
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:56,436
I was told 50 to 60 years.

678
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,224
Talk to me.

679
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:05,619
I would, but there's
nothing to say.

Um, I need to get into
my friend's apartment again.

683
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:22,853
Whoa, okay. You're just
going to take that?

684
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,943
I'm not taking anything.

685
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:28,424
I-I don't think
I can let you do that.

686
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:29,860
Yes, you can.

687
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,340
Technically, it belongs
to my boss; he paid for it.

688

Okay, but I'm-I'm supposed
to just take your word for it?

689

Hey, my friend has fallen off
the face of the Earth, okay?

She's vanished.

Okay, look, hey. Listen.

Do what you want, okay?

00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,275
But for what it's worth,
it does happen, okay?

697
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,885
People do vanish.

BENNY: This is Powell.
23 years old.

Waited two years and

successfully performed.

This is Naomi.
After waiting 14 months,

a matching liver
was finally identified

to her hospital.

That's a tragic story,

Mr. Colón?

734
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:52,829
Your Honor, the defense is
simply trying to make the point

735
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:57,399
that livers, matching livers,
are limited commodities,

736
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:01,621
that many people
with greater life expectancies

737
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,102
have been waiting far longer
than the plaintiff

that she's entitled...

about entitlement.

This isn't about
jumping the line.

If she doesn't get
the operation

in the next 12 weeks,
she is going to die.

And you know what?
If she dies,

Make no mistake,
this is about money.

We should be identifying
livers right now.

We should be testing

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,949
I don't know.

797
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,995
Cry, maybe.

798
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:26,173
You want me to hang?

799
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:28,610
No.

800
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:31,352
I don't think I like the
idea of you being alone.

801
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:33,659
[sighs] I'm-I'm fine.

802
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:34,877
Are you sure?

803
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:37,619
You're not gonna do
something stupid,

804
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:40,143
like go get a drink?

805
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:42,842
I have a system for that.

806
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:46,324
Uh, as long as I have
taxi money, I have a system.

807
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,199
Seriously, I'm... I'm fine.

808
00:38:54,462 --> 00:38:57,030
You can go.

809
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:01,774
I'll be all right.

810
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:21,141
JUDGE:
Has the jury reached a verdict?

811
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:23,230
We have, Your Honor.

812
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:28,975
We, the jury,
find for the defendant,

813
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:30,542
EquiSafe Insurance.

[gallery exclaiming][gavel pounds]

815
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,720
JUDGE: The court thanks you
for your service.

816
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:36,417
I got you, I got you.

817
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,158
It's okay.
No!

818
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,552
We'll fight this.
[cries]

819
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,860
BULL:
We got two jurors.

820
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:47,210
Not among the mirror jurors,

821
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:50,997
but among the ones actually
sitting in the jury box.

822
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,259
I knew it.

823
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:54,522
I knew it.

824
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:56,002
I knew you'd be great at this.

825
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:57,873
Look, I know you said

826
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,528
this wasn't for you,
but, uh, wow.

827
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:11,234
Hey, if you change your mind.

828
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:23,072
Well... I guess
I owe you an apology.

829
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:26,075
I said we couldn't do this
and I was wrong.

830
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,903
No, I think you said
we shouldn't do this

831
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:29,078
and you were right.

832
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,080
[sighs]

833
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:33,039
By the way, I've been
meaning to tell you

834
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:34,997
those two cases you
lost while I was gone,

835
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:37,435
I read the transcripts
last night.

836
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,524
You were great.

837
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,569
Those two judges
were morons.

838
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:44,442
[chuckles]

839
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:46,444
Well, thank you, Bull.

No. Thanks.

I got to catch a cab.

844
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,457
Something I got to do.

845
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:09,467
BULL:
Mrs. Summerfield?

846
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:12,339
It's my friend.

847
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:15,081
What do you want?
We have a plane to catch.

848
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:18,084
I just wanted
to give you something.

849
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:28,224
I don't understand.
This is a check for $2 million

850
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:29,878
made out to some company.

851
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:34,666
My company. If you look on the
back, I signed it over to you.

852
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:37,843
What do you mean?
Why would you give me this?

853
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:40,280
I don't know.

854
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:42,500
I'm crazy. You can ask anyone
who works for me.

855
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:47,809
Also, I just lost somebody.

856
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:54,990
The truth is, it's EquiSafe
Insurance's money and...

00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:59,125
[blows a raspberry]

00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:03,782
put the rest away
for your family.

860
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:05,610
That's absurd.

861
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:07,307
Is this some kind of a joke?

862
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,135
No joke.

863
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:14,575
Get your 42 months, which,
by the way, who knows?

864
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,882
Might just be 42 years.

865
00:42:19,014 --> 00:42:22,017
You should really get going. You
don't want to miss your plane.
