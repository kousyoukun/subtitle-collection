Well, wanting is fine.
Doing is a whole other thing.

There are laws in this country.

Oh, you can't blame the jury.

45

They were never given the
evidence they needed to convict.

How is that even possible?

47

of this guy's car.

What more do you need?

50
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,615
Problem is, the jury
never heard any of that.

51
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,444
Turns out, the police had

52
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:23,099
a description
of the kidnapper's car.

53
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,276
Now, this Richard Briggs was
driving a car that matched,

54
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,626
so the police pulled him over
and they searched it.

55
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,152
Now, if there were a body
laying in the back seat,

56
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,544
wouldn't have been a problem.

57
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:34,719
But it was in the trunk.

58
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:37,505
And you're not allowed
to open the trunk

59

without probable cause.

60
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,292
At that point
the police didn't have it.

I spend half a day waiting
to be interviewed,

75
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,626
and then the attorneys
figure out who I am,

76
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,541
and they can't
get rid of me fast enough.

They're not ringing

while you were away,

ourselves of.

piano teacher.

107

I'd lost my 11-year-old,

and he was driving around town
like it was a holiday.

115

with murder.

00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,964
20 minutes.

164
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:42,184
How long do you think
it'll take me to get excused?

165
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:44,404
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

166
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,407
I'm betting 45 minutes.

167
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,977
A.A.G. LANFORD:
The defendant,

168
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:58,418
one Kendrick Gorman,
who is accused

169
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,724
of practicing law

170
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:04,467
without a license.

171
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,251
BULL: My God, he's actually
pronouncing every comma.

172
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:08,297
That's right.

173
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,214
Could there possibly be
a bigger abuse of trust?

174
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:17,045
You find yourself
on the wrong side of the law.

175
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,699
Desperate for help.

176
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,570
You hire an attorney.

177
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:24,356
Only to find that he's not
really an attorney.

178
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,536
But an impostor.

179
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,060
BULL: As opposed to an authentic idiot like you.

180
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:35,237
Dr. Jason Bull.

181
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,196
TheDr. Jason Bull?

182
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,981
Hmm. I'm afraid so.

183
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:42,113
What a pleasure
to finally meet you.

184
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:44,028
And you, as well.

185
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:46,770
And now, I know you've done work
with my office,

186
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:50,165
the state attorney
general's office, and I know

187
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,037
you're also thought to be
one of the best in your field.

188
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:55,475
So, just to be clear,
you advise

189
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:59,000
people like me
how to pick juries.

190
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:03,004
What to say to juries,
how to get the juries to come

191
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:06,703
to conclusions whoever hires you
needs them to come to.

192
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:07,965
Is that correct?

193
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,490
Well, that's not
how I'd put it, but...

194
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,188
Your Honor, we'd like
to strike this juror for cause.

195
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,624
What cause?

196
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,365
Well, you just heard him.

197
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,367
He is an expert

198
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,543
in all matters
pertaining to juries.

199
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,153
HUDSON:
And that's all well and good.

200
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:25,548
But as far as I can tell,
in this particular case,

201
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:28,682
Dr. Bull will not
be picking jurors.

202
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,336
Nor will he be advising either
side on what to say to them.

203
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,209
And as far as helping them
come to conclusions,

204
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,558
well, hopefully that's the job

205
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:39,344
of every juror during
the period of deliberations.

206
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:42,130
Ms. Dunn, would you care
to question the juror?

207
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,178
So you're a jury consultant?

208
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,180
A trial scientist, yes.

209
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:52,270
You advise lawyers
on how to try their cases.

210
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:54,708
Sometimes, yes.

211
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:58,712
So, in a sense, you practice law
without a license.

212
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,235
Just like my client.

213
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:02,411
No, I wouldn't exactly say that.

214
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:04,892
This juror
is acceptable to the defense.

215
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:07,808
Your Honor, uh, if I may,

216
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:10,332
I would love
to be seated on this jury.

217
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,769
Well, then, today's
your lucky day.

218
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,423
But unfortunately, um,

219
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:17,948
I have a-a previous commitment,
a legal commitment.

220
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,471
A legal commitment?

221
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:22,387
Yes, indeed. Uh, I am
in the midst of starting

222
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,869
a murder trial downstairs,
right in this very courthouse.

223
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:29,264
And, um... uh,
you may have heard of it.

224
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,658
The State v. Heather Spiro?

225
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,138
It's a very big, important case.

226
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,097
Yes, I have heard of it.

227
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,925
Well, aren't you the VIP?

228
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,013
[chuckles]

229
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,841
However, trial scientists
are not now,

230
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:42,930
nor have they ever been,
essential

231
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:45,454
to the American
criminal justice system.

232
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:47,630
But jurors are.

233
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,198
Your Honor, my client
is facing a life sentence.

234
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,373
She has a lawyer?

235
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,636
She does.

236
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,770
Good. Then everybody has
what they need.

237
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,337
She has a lawyer,
we have 12 jurors.

238
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:02,123
Welcome to my court, Dr. Bull.

239
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,952
And welcome to jury duty.

240
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:14,701
Ah. You can win
$100 million verdicts

241
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,528
against multinational
corporations,

242
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,792
but you can't argue
your way out of jury duty?

243
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,402
Trust me, I tried.

244
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,056
I think the judge
has a crush on me.

245
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,013
Needless to say,

246
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,972
our client is not pleased.

247
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,016
Oh, I don't blame her.

248
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,801
You just missed her.

249
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,020
They just put her in
the prison van ten minutes ago.

250
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:33,763
Well, the good news is, I won't
be on this jury for long.

251
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:35,809
There are only three people
on the witness list.

252
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,811
Whole thing should
be over in a day.

253
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,900
Now, I was thinking
for tomorrow,

254
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,076
it makes sense to promote Chunk
to the second chair.

255
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,078
Someone sitting next to you
with Marissa in his ear.

256
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:46,907
I get that.
So what's the strategy?

257
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,909
Well, I'm thinking
EED defense.

258
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,127
EED?

259
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,783
Extreme emotional disturbance?

260
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:56,177
No, that's not going to work.

261
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,048
EED happens in the moment.

262
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,746
And the evidence clearly proves

263
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,617
that this was not
a spontaneous act.

264
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,923
By her own admission,

265
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:05,882
she was lying in wait
for this guy for days.

266
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,624
I know. I just want to use it
to get our foot in the door.

267
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,800
Gives us an excuse
in your opening statement

268
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,410
to talk about
the horrific details

269
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:13,934
of what happened
to this woman's child,

270
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:14,978
which otherwise...

271
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:16,197
We're going to get caught.

272
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,374
And when that happens,
we will apologize

273
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,724
and come up with
a different attack.

274
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:22,899
But I'll be in the
courtroom by then

275
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,945
and we'll figure
something out.

276
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:28,775
Also, have Danny get a line
on the surviving daughter.

277
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:31,342
We need to give the jury
as many reasons as possible

278
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:34,215
to not send Heather to prison,
and what better reason

279
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:37,479
than she has a teenage
daughter who needs her

280
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,524
and is waiting for
her to come home?

281
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:49,186
DANNY:
The tattoo new?

282
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,189
Looks new.

283
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,887
I did it myself.

284
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,151
What about
the piercings?

285
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:59,501
Last weekend.

286
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:02,156
There's not a lot
to do around here,

287
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:04,636
and I don't really
know anybody.

288
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,682
I mean, I know
my aunt, but...

289
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,814
Would you like your mom
to see them?

290
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:08,815
I can take a picture for you.

291
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,817
No.

292
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,819
She's got enough
going on right now.

293
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,821
She doesn't need
to worry about me.

294
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:19,042
Well, she is...
worried about you.

295
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:20,783
She wants
to come home to you,

296
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:21,958
take care of you.

297
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,612
Mm-hmm.

298
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,746
Well, the reason I'm here, uh,

299
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,965
we'd like for you
to come to the city,

300
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,706
be a part of the trial.

301
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,491
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

302
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:37,060
Well, I can come here.
I can, I can pick you up.

303
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:38,758
Can sit with you in court.

304
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:45,242
The jury needs to see
that your mom still has a child,

305
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:49,203
a child who loves her,
misses her,

306
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,857
needs her at home.

307
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,208
I've been to court before.

308
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,863
My sister's trial.

309
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,213
I sat there the whole time,
waiting for a chance

310
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:00,997
to tell them what I knew,
and then, when the time came,

311
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,956
they wouldn't let me say it.

312
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,132
What wouldn't they let you say?

313
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:08,918
I... heard his voice.

314
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:11,181
I knew him.

315
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:16,230
[laughs]
He was my piano teacher.

316
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:21,061
I spent every Wednesday with him
for three years.

317
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:25,369
But, uh, they said
hearing someone's voice

318
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:30,070
and thinking you know who
they are isn't enough proof,

319
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:34,074
so I couldn't say it
on the stand.

320
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,858
You didn't see him?

321
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:39,079
I was sleeping.

322
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:44,127
He must've come in
through the window, but...

323
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:47,914
all I know is,
he put a bag over my head

324
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,568
and when I woke up,

325
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:55,747
he was wrapping tape
around the bag...

326
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,794
and over my mouth.

327
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,016
And he carried me to the closet
and locked me in.

328
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,714
And he said

329
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:11,024
if I made a sound, he
would kill my mother.

330
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:17,639
I thought he was
there for her.

331
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:27,301
Maybe if I'd been awake, none
of this would have happened.

332
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:30,043
Maybe he wouldn't
have gotten Ella

333
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:33,133
or my mom
wouldn't have shot him.

334
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:43,491
They're new, too.

335
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:48,061
So, today is all about something
called voir dire.

336
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,323
It's kind of our specialty.

337
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:51,542
It's about interviewing
prospective jurors

338
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:53,283
and doing everything
we can to make sure

339
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,677
that we pick the right ones,
the ones who are best able

340
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,723
to hear our argument,
sympathize with it, yeah.Okay.

341
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,204
Even though you won't be
testifying today-- no one will--

342
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:03,990
you have a very important job.

343
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:07,123
This is when the jurors get
their first look at you.

344
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,386
Prosecutor's gonna want
them to see a murderer,

345
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,866
a public menace.

346
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,434
I want them to see
the schoolteacher,

347
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,219
the grieving mother,

348
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,481
the victim of a
murderous deviant

349
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,441
who took advantage
of a family's trust.

350
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:22,225
But there's no sign
you can hold up

351
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,575
to show 'em all
those things.

352
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,186
You have to
do it in here.

353
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:30,451
You have to be it in here and
not just in the courtroom--

354
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,192
from the moment you leave
that cell in the morning

355
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,324
until your head hits the pillow
at night. Can you do that?

356
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,587
Yeah. I can do that.Great.

357
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:39,416
Now, Benny and
Chunk know exactly

358
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,244
what we're looking
for juror-wise.

359
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,507
Marissa back
at my office...
Wait a second.

360
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,770
You're not coming
to court with us today?

361
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,207
Well, I can't.
I have a...

362
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,253
What did I do?
What did I fall for?

363
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,951
I need a new lawyer. I need...No, you don't.

364
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,866
You need to lower your voice
and stop acting out in public.

365
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,825
Look around. There are
people walking by.

366
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:59,001
You have no idea
who they are.

367
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:02,004
Like I told you,
your job starts

368
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:04,180
the moment you leave
prison in the morning

369
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:07,836
until you get back
to your cell at night.

370
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,751
Now, I will do everything
in my power to get back

371
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,101
and be by your side
as soon as I can.

372
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,451
But let's not blow this
thing on deportment.

373
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,932
Shall we?

374
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,760
LANFORD: And how many times
did the defendant

375
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,892
hold himself out
to be an attorney?

376
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,677
At least 16.

377
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,853
And what kinds of cases
did he try?

378
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,159
BOONE:
All kinds.

379
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:29,249
Everything from traffic
violations to murder.

380
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:31,860
LANFORD: And while we already
know that he didn't have

381
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:35,603
a law degree, what kind
of education did he have?

382
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:38,606
High school.
A year of community college.

383
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,912
LANFORD:
High school?

384
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,740
A year of community college.

385
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,960
No further questions,
Your Honor.

386
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,180
Good afternoon.

387
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,095
Good afternoon.

388
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:52,924
You obtained a subpoena,
went into my client's office,

389
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,144
seized my client's records.

390
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,886
Did you happen to notice what he
charged for his legal services?

391
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,192
Objection. Relevance.

392
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:02,325
Simply because he didn't charge
a lot of money

393
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,154
doesn't change the fact that
he was breaking the law.

394
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,851
Objection sustained.

395
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,332
The jury will ignore
the question.

396
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:13,858
When you examined
my client's records,

397
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:18,950
were you able to ascertain the
sort of clients he represented?

398
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,300
What do you mean?

399
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:23,346
He didn't represent
rich people, did he?

400
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,131
Objection.
Relevance again.

401
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,654
[sighs]

402
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,525
Objection sustained. Again.

403
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,528
Ms. Dunn, please don't test me.

404
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:34,401
None of this is relevant
to the charges.

405
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:37,056
Do you have another question?

406
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:42,017
Yes, juror number four.
What can I do for you?

407
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,801
Well, I just, uh...

408
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,283
Well, Your Honor, I've been
in some courtrooms

409
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,894
where the judge allows jurors
to ask questions.

410
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,810
Do you have a question,
number four?

411
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:58,077
Thank you.

412
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:04,953
"Did the defendant ever lose
any of his cases?"

413
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:14,180
No. He didn't.

414
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,529
He never lost a case.

415
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:20,447
Thanks.

416
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:26,453
Our juror wants to know if any
of the defendant's clients

417
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:29,151
ever complained
about his work.

418
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,674
Not that I know of.

419
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:35,766
Um, juror four,
why don't you just go ahead

420
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,203
and ask your questions out loud?

421
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:38,204
Your Honor.

422
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,902
Overruled.

423
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:43,296
Sit.
BULL:
Okay.

424
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:46,168
Well, hasn't the defendant
already stipulated

425
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,214
that going forward,
he will no longer offer

426
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,825
his services as an attorney
until such time

427
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,609
as he completes his education
and passes the bar?

428
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,003
That's my understanding.

429
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:57,397
And one last question:
how did Mr. Gorman,

430
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,615
the defendant, get caught?

431
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:01,662
He defended a man
falsely accused

432
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:04,360
of being involved
in a drug-trafficking ring.

433
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,623
Which I'm assuming he won.

434
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,668
He did.

435
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,844
So... [chuckles]

436
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:11,106
a guy with a high
school education--

437
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,977
sorry, one year of
community college--

438
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,632
beats a City of New
York prosecutor.

439
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:17,808
You think maybe that's why
we're all sitting here?

440
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:20,376
Isn't it reasonable
to assume

441
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,770
that if Mr. Gorman had lost
that particular case,

442
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:24,554
the prosecutor wouldn't
have investigated him

443
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,295
and we wouldn't be
sitting here today?

444
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,818
Doesn't that sound
like an abuse of power?

445
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,952
I suppose.

446
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:33,824
Ah. I have no further questions.

447
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:36,087
And I have no further questions.

448
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:37,828
The defense rests.

449
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,352
HUDSON:
Then, tomorrow morning

450
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,962
the jury will hear
closing arguments

451
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,660
and commence deliberations.

452
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:46,185
Court is adjourned.

453
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,361
The good news is there's nothing
left but closing arguments

454
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:49,275
and deliberations.

455
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:51,102
The bad news is,
at this point,

456
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,975
I don't think either side
is carrying the day

457
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,934
and I'm worried that unless
something miraculous happens,

458
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:59,763
I could be locked up
in that jury room

459
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,548
for a couple more days
deliberating.

460
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:04,333
Can we just take a moment
and talk about Heather Spiro?

461
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,509
I think if she doesn't

462
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:09,773
see Jason Bull sitting by
her side in court pretty soon,

463
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,384
she's likely to fire us.

464
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:12,515
Which would defeat
the whole point

465
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,343
of our having
gotten involved,

466
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:15,953
which was to generate
some good press.

467
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,955
Well, I think
you're both overreacting.

468
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,479
I disagree.

469
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,437
I think they're telling
it to you straight.

470
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,918
We actually had a really
good day at court.

471
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,312
I think we got a jury that
you'll be really pleased with.

472
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,488
The one problem is, when they
glance at the defendant,

473
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:31,447
all they see is
an incredibly angry lady.

474
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:36,365
Okay. I'll walk her
into the courtroom again

475
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,497
tomorrow morning.

476
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,107
And then you'll turn around,

477
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,283
and Chunk and I will be stuck
with trying to convince her

478
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:42,545
that everything's
going to be all right.

479
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,373
And it will be.

480
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,896
It's the best I can do.

481
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,507
Everyone understands.

482
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,292
And you still want me to go with
EED in my opening statement?

483
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:54,383
EED it is.

484
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,211
BULL: Danny, we have
the daughter all teed up?

485
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,691
We need her testimony.

486
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:59,345
I don't think
you want to do that.

487
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,607
Well, then you'd be wrong

488
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,348
'cause that's exactly
what we need to do.

489
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:04,132
She's the only witness we have,

490
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:07,875
at least the only one who can
provide the jury with something

491
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:10,181
even close to a first-person
account of what happened

492
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:13,359
the night the victim
was snatched from her home.

493
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:17,014
Bull, she's 15 and
she's cutting herself.

494
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:18,494
She's got a tattoo
on her neck

495
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,235
and piercings in her face.

496
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,628
And who knows
what she's doing

497
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,325
to the other parts of her
body that I can't see.

498
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,196
Clearly she's really fragile,

499
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,503
and I'm afraid
if you put her on the...Well, stop being afraid.

500
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,331
We need her testimony.

501
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,464
Well, there is
another problem with that.

502
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:33,335
Heather Spiro won't have it.

503
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,511
She knows her daughter
is falling apart,

504
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:38,035
and she's refusing
to let her testify.

505
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,386
So she wants to go to prison
for the rest of her life?

506
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,865
She feels there's got

507
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,824
to be a way to present
her case without...

508
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:46,479
And neither of you could
disabuse her of that?

509
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:48,742
Nope. But I'm sure
you can do it

510
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:52,136
during your 90-second walk
with her into court tomorrow.

511
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,573
Night, all.

512
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:54,922
I have got a trial
to prepare for.

513
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,494
Well, I guess we're done here.

514
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,718
BULL:
Don't speak.

515
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:10,764
Three things.

516
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:13,854
First thing, I don't give a damn
who you're pissed off at or why.

517
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,246
When you're sitting
in that courtroom,

518
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,509
you better be looking
like a victim

519
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,032
and not like the
Wicked Witch of the West,

520
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:20,208
or you're not gonna fire me,
I will quit.

521
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,732
And if I do that, there's not
a law firm in this town

522
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:25,518
worth a damn that will touch you
with a ten-foot pole.

523
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:28,259
Second thing.
I am moving heaven and earth

524
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,523
to get down here
and be by your side.

525
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:33,352
I have every hope
that tomorrow morning

526
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,789
I will be there,
but I can't promise.

527
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:37,791
What I can promise is that
I am totally involved

528
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:40,620
in your defense, and those
two men standing behind me

529
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,361
are doing everything
they are supposed to be doing.

530
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,537
But if you're unhappy,
or you have a better idea,

531
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,627
or you have some secret plan
for getting away with murder

532
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,498
on a New York City sidewalk
in broad daylight,

533
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:50,847
I'd love to hear it.

534
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:54,373
I didn't think so.

535
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,680
And third, there is one thing
I am certain of.

536
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:59,290
If we don't put your daughter
on that stand,

537
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:00,901
you are going to prison.

538
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:03,947
And the only question will be
for a quarter of a century

539
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,427
or the rest of your life?

540
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,429
She'll never do it.

541
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,952
And I'll never let her.

542
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,824
Then we are all
wasting our time.

543
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,217
No. Not you.

544
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,828
Not yet.

545
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:18,440
You actually haven't given me
any of your time to waste.

546
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,442
[chuckles]
You guys are right.

547
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,226
She's a peach.
Well, maybe you haven't heard.

548
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,445
I like to win.

549
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:27,101
So buckle up,
put on a happy face,

550
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:29,233
and get ready to have
your mind changed.

551
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,416
[indistinct chatter]

552
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,906
You know, if I were advising
that Gorman fella,

553
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,735
I'd tell him to do the, uh,
closing argument himself.

554
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:55,346
He needs to show that jury that,
even though he doesn't have

555
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,261
a law license,
he's a great litigator.

556
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,481
Would you stop that, please?

557
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,309
We're not supposed
to be doing this.

558
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:02,658
Jurors are not supposed
to talk to defendants

559
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:04,312
outside the courtroom.

560
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:06,401
[elevator bell chimes]

561
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,229
I don't know what
you're talking about.

562
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:10,492
I didn't say a word.

563
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,407
BENNY: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

564
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,410
I intend to prove to you
that this,

565
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,412
this was no vigilante killing.

566
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,111
That this was an act of
desperation committed by a woman

567
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:25,594
who fell victim to a mental
condition called EED.

568
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,944
Extreme emotional disturbance.

569
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:29,424
Objection.

570
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,034
Objection?

571
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:36,562
Y... Your Honor, I'm still
giving my opening statement.

572
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,302
EED, really, Your Honor?

573
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,739
The State would like
to be heard.

574
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:42,176
Oh, well, the defense
would like to be heard, too.

575
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:44,265
As a matter of fact,
the defense would like

576
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:45,527
to finish
their opening statement.

577
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:48,225
Wow. We've barely started. Okay.

578
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,750
Want to see you both
in my chambers.

579
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:53,187
[gallery murmuring]

580
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,756
I love the law.

581
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,846
I know that must sound
ridiculous coming from someone

582
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:05,329
who's on trial for breaking it,
but it is the truth.

583
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:08,507
I never planned
on impersonating a-an attorney.

584
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,380
Five years ago,
a woman friend asked me

585
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:15,818
to go with her to, um,
small claims court,

586
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,428
offer moral support.

587
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:22,477
Um, I was wearing a suit
'cause, um... [chuckles]

588
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,698
I was a-a mortician
and I had a funeral that day.

589
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,917
And anyway, uh,
the judge started asking

590
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,136
a bunch of questions.

591
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:30,964
And my friend kind of froze.

592
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:36,404
So I started answering for her.

593
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,362
[laughs softly]

594
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:42,105
Next thing I know,
my friend won her case.

595
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:46,153
And as we, uh,
left the courtroom, this guy

596
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:49,373
came running up to me
to tell me how impressed he was,

597
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,723
and would I represent him

598
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:53,726
the following week
i-in traffic court?

599
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,511
One case led to another.

600
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:01,429
A-And, and the amazing thing
was, I, I never lost.

601
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,217
I also, uh, never charged
more than $35 an hour.

602
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:09,263
I know that sounds crazy,
but like I said,

603
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:12,005
I, I love the law.

604
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:14,094
And thank God for the Internet,

605
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:17,837
'cause anything I didn't know,
I, I cou-- I could look up.

606
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,057
But of course,
I-I knew it was wrong.

607
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:24,974
Although I'm not sure
it should be.

608
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:27,411
I mean, doesn't the law
belong to everyone?

609
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:31,024
Not just people with money
who can take seven years

610
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,852
off of their lives
and go to school?

611
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:36,638
Or-or clients who, who can
bankroll a defense?

612
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,293
[clears throat]

613
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:43,602
But, um, that's a conversation
for another day.

614
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,603
[clears throat]

615
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,391
I'm sorry.

616
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:53,307
Sorry for what I did,

617
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,526
but I-I would beg you
not to find me guilty.

618
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,487
Because if I'm convicted,
even when I pass the bar,

619
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:04,927
I will not ever be allowed to
practice my beloved law again.

620
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:12,892
Also, this will be
the first case I ever lose.

621
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,725
BULL:
Benny!

622
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,558
Terrific.

623
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,430
I'm here.

624
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:32,955
Oh, it's Benny of Arc.

625
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,174
[groans]

626
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:35,479
Don't make fun.

627
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:39,570
My back has declared war
on the rest of my body.

628
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,355
It's all in your head.

629
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:42,530
Nope. It's all in my back.

630
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:44,532
[grunts]

631
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,360
Why are you in such a good mood?

632
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:49,668
I have completed
my service as juror.

633
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,192
The accused was found
not guilty.

634
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,584
Unanimously.

635
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,456
Wow.But the big news is,

636
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:56,849
I am back on the team.

637
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,502
Ready to head into court

638
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:00,591
and fight for the freedom
of our delightful client.

639
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,637
Now,

640
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,074
what's making you so anxious
that your back's gone out?

641
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:07,686
The judge threw out
our EED defense.

642
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:11,037
Didn't even let me get
through my opening statement.

643
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,302
[sighing]:
Now my back's starting to hurt.

644
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:21,090
What if we lose?

645
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:24,790
Remember, we don't have
to change every juror's mind.

646
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:27,009
Just one will get us a mistrial.

647
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:29,403
Three or four, and the D.A.
might even dismiss the charges.

648
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:32,754
When you were a kid, you
believed in Santa, didn't you?

649
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,582
Till I was about 35.

650
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,062
Ah.

651
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:39,369
You think
what she did was wrong?

652
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:42,155
Yes.

653
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,418
You think punishing her
for it is right?

654
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,376
No.

655
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,771
Me either.

656
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,773
Benny, we can win this thing.

657
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:55,168
You have a plan B?

658
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:58,911
I have a plan B-minus.

659
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:04,220
It's not great, and it still
presents the same big problem.

660
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:06,092
Okay. Lay it on me.

661
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:09,443
We go in there tomorrow and
announce a new defense theory.

662
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,662
It's called defense of others.

663
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:12,794
Ah.

664
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,101
Defense of others.
I know it well.

665
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:18,408
It's kind of like self-defense,
only we argue that

666
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:21,629
Heather shot that man in order
to protect her daughter.

667
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:25,546
Which I believe with all
my heart is the truth.

668
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,766
Just can't figure out
how to prove it.

669
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,465
[grunting]:
Great. The pain is back.

670
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:33,510
[exhales]

671
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:41,431
Who did you say it was?

672
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:42,955
AUNT:
A friend of your mom's.

673
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,523
Hello?

674
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,525
Penny Spiro.

675
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:51,267
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

676
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,703
Sorry to show up
on your doorstep

677
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:54,488
so early in the morning,
but I'm part

678
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:56,403
of your mom's
legal team,

679
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:58,405
and I desperately need you
to do two things I've been told

680
00:29:58,448 --> 00:29:59,841
you're not gonna want to do.

681
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,843
I won't testify.

682
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:04,498
That's only the first one.

683
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:08,981
I also need you to convince
your mom to let you do it.

684
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,244
It's a pretty simple system.
Uh, four cameras.

685
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:12,636
Three inside the store.

686
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,203
One that focuses
on the cash register

687
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:15,857
and the customers as they pay.

688
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,425
Two that show customers walking
through the aisles of the store

689
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:20,296
from opposite sides
of the store.

690
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,864
And a wireless camera,
mounted without permission

691
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:25,345
on the lamp post outside
the store, presumably,

692
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,956
to capture people coming
into and out of the store,

693
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,871
specifically those
who haven't paid.

694
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,699
Shoplifters, that kind of thing.

695
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:35,877
And when you examined the DVR,
what did you discover?

696
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:38,532
I discovered that
on four consecutive days,

697
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,403
beginning with June 11,

698
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:43,667
the defendant planted herself
outside the store.

699
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,974
Twice in her car,
twice on foot.

700
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:48,237
And in your
professional opinion,

701
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,022
what was she doing?BENNY:
Objection, Your Honor.

702
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:52,546
The assistant district attorney
is asking

703
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:53,764
the witness to speculate.

704
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:55,723
She's asking
a professional investigator

705
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:57,377
to give her expert opinion

706
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,379
based on the evidence
in front of her.

707
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:00,859
Overruled.

708
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,991
You may answer the question.

709
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:05,472
Waiting. She's waiting.

710
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:06,516
Waiting.

711
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,562
Any idea for what?

712
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:10,520
Well, I think
that became apparent

713
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:14,002
on the fifth day,
when she executed Mr. Briggs.

714
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:15,482
WAKEFIELD:
The prosecution has no further
questions for this witness.

715
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:18,093
I need to hear
something positive.

716
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:21,575
Well, this jury
is positively unanimous.

717
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:23,229
Defense will cross-examine this
witness after the lunch break.

718
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:25,318
Court is in recess.[gavel bangs]

719
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,363
Thank God.

720
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:30,540
Nice of you to join us.

721
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,586
Ah. I thought so, too.

722
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,550
Oh, my God. Penny.

723
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:46,252
Oh...

724
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:50,386
I told Dr. Bull everything.

725
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:56,479
That I'm the reason
all this happened.

726
00:31:57,437 --> 00:32:01,441
And I want to take the stand.

727
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:02,746
BENNY:
Penny...

728
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:07,099
could you please tell
the jury about the day

729
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:10,015
they found Ella and caught
the man who killed her?

730
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:16,978
Well... it was
the worst day of my life.

731
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:19,763
[laughing nervously]:
And also,

732
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:22,984
weirdly, kind of the best.

733
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,855
How do you mean?

734
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,075
PENNY:
Well, uh,

735
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,514
it was horrible because it...

736
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:35,605
it was the moment I absolutely
knew my sister was gone.

737
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:38,608
Uh...

738
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,654
There was no denying it.

739
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:44,310
She was never coming back.

740
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:50,011
But later that night, um,

741
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:54,363
it finally started to sink in
that they caught him,

742
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:55,930
the guy who did it.

743
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,889
They had him,
and he was going

744
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,936
to prison forever.

745
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:10,031
I remember my mother holding me

746
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:15,036
and telling me...
it was going to be okay.

747
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:20,346
That it-it may never go back
to the way it was.

748
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:27,092
But it would go back
to a new normal.

749
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:29,485
I could live my life again.

750
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:33,054
I could leave my house.

751
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,362
I-I could go to school,
see my, see my friends.

752
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:39,669
In a couple of years,
go to college.

753
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:41,889
Have a future.

754
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:45,849
We were safe.

755
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:48,504
BENNY:
And then?

756
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:54,554
And then they let him
out of jail.

757
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:56,860
And I realized

758
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:59,863
there was never
gonna be a normal.

759
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:02,953
And what did that feel like?

760
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:06,044
We were terrified.

761
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:08,307
I was terrified.

762
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:12,398
My mom had to drive me
to and from school again.

763
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:15,966
And, uh,
when we got home,

764
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,534
we'd lock the doors
and check the windows.

765
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:23,539
And... I didn't see my friends.

766
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,976
I didn't play soccer.

767
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,935
I dropped out of chorus.

768
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:29,110
And it just

769
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:31,460
went on like this?

770
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:34,072
F-For a few months.

771
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:38,424
So I went to my mom and
I told her that if I couldn't

772
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:44,038
live a normal life,
that I was going to kill myself.

773
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:49,609
BENNY: And what was
her reaction to that?

774
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:50,784
PENNY:
We started experimenting.

775
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:56,181
I-I'd go out for, like, an hour.

776
00:34:56,224 --> 00:35:00,446
Or I'd walk home from school
with a friend.

777
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:04,667
I knew those must have been
the longest hours for my mother,

778
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:07,975
but I started
to feel alive again.

779
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,717
BENNY:
And...

780
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,328
what happened on June 10?

781
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:16,723
I was walking home from school
and I felt like a soda,

782
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,725
so I stopped at the bodega.

783
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,161
By yourself?

784
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:21,858
Uh, by myself.

785
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:25,123
And, um, I went
to the refrigerator case

786
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:29,344
and I grabbed a can

787
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:33,696
and I turned around
and he was standing there.

788
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,871
Mr. Briggs?

789
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:36,090
Mm-hmm.

790
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,397
And did he say anything to you?

791
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,748
No. He was just staring at me.

792
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,142
Did he touch you?

793
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,752
Try to reach
out to you?

794
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:46,709
No.

795
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:49,408
And what did you do?

796
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:52,193
I put the can down
and I ran out of there.

797
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:53,847
Did you go home?

798
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,894
No. I-I went to the coffee shop
next door and I called my mom.

799
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:00,854
And she came
and picked me up.

BENNY:
That was on June 10,

801
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,813
and on June 11 your mom began

802
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:05,554

at the bodega.

WAKEFIELD:
Objection.

804
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:09,036
That's not a question.
Counsel is testifying.

805
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,690
I apologize, Your Honor.

806
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:13,214
I just have one more question.

807
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:15,260
The last time

808
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:20,221
you were in court, during your
little sister's murder trial,

809
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:21,657
you were on the stand,

810
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:24,660
and there was something
that A.D.A. Wakefield

811
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:30,318
wouldn't allow you to say
that was important to you.

812
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:32,015
You want to say it now?

813
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,234
Your Honor.

814
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,410
Sit down, Ms. Wakefield.

815
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:40,894
I just wanted to tell the court

816
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:44,245
that I heard his voice.

When he broke in
that night

818
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:51,731
and covered my head and put me
in the closet, he spoke to me,

819
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:55,735
and I knew instantly

820
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:57,780
who it was.

821
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,828
We all knew who it was.

822
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:06,746
Why did you let him out?

823
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:13,753
The defense rests, Your Honor.

I can't explain it,
but nothing is moving here.

It seems in the matter
of The State v. Heather Spiro,

862
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:18,704
our jury is hopelessly
deadlocked.

863
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:20,836
I say "hopelessly" because,
according to this note,

864
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,623
while six of our jurors
find the defendant guilty,

865

six believe her to be innocent.

I see no other choice
but to declare a mistrial.

Would the prosecutor like to
schedule a date for a retrial?

00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,168
I believe, in their inability
to send a unified verdict,

869
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:51,476
our jurors are sending
an important message.

00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:54,653
Perhaps because of all
these months served behind bars,

perhaps in the loss of a child,

this woman is a threat to
