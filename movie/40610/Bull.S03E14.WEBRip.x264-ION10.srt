but that is not what...

179
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,455
But what?!

180
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,326
What is the truth here, Nate?

181
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:25,069
I'm your friend.
I want to help you.

182
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:27,550
But that message
along with everything else,

183
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,160
none of this looks good,

184
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:30,684
at all!

185
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:35,602
[exhales sharply]
You married?

186
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,473
No.

187
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,474
You I know about.

188
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,476
Well...

189
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,305
Marriage is a tricky deal.

190
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:46,308
You make a promise
about the future...

191
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,266
but you make it
at a moment in time

192
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,964
where you don't
really have any idea

193
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,053
of what the future
is gonna bring.

194
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:55,796
I was a hungry
junior investment banker.

195
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,233
She was writing fiction
no one was reading.

196
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,539
Five years later,

197
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,628
I was controlling
$3 billion in assets,

198
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:05,849
and she was the most read writer
on the planet.

199
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,897
People change.

200
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,726
Circumstances change.

201
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,729
Needs change.

202
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:21,996
I spoke to my wife
after she left that message.

203
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,869
She didn't want to be done
with the marriage.

204
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:30,308
She wanted to be done
with our... understanding.

205
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,528
What understanding?

206
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:40,231
She and I spent
a lot of time apart.

207
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,408
Her up at the lake.

208
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,847
Me here in the city.

209
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,545
We both made mistakes.

210
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:55,595
At a certain point,
we made a set of rules.

211
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:59,729
When we were together,
it was just the two of us.

212
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:02,558
But when we were apart,
it was...

213
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,604
we were not together.

214
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,694
Sorry. This is not
the sort of thing

215
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:10,827
you share with college buddies.

216
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,661
The point is, the last time
I spoke to her, she...

217
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:21,925
she said the whole thing
had just gotten exhausting.

218
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:25,146
You know, emotionally.

219
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:28,018
She just wanted to end it
with her friend.

220
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,805
She just wanted it...

221
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,068
She wanted it
to be just us again.

222
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,636
And how'd you feel about that?

223
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,465
I thought she was being
melodramatic.

224
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:44,252
[Nathan sniffles]

225
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,130
I didn't have the heart
to do it, but...

226
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,263
tomorrow I need
to ask him the names

227
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:56,917
of anyone
he consorted with.

228
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,441
And obviously...
her, too--

229
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:03,837
anyone she was...You're really
shocked, aren't you?

230
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,969
He's my friend.

231
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,711
[sighs]

232
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:11,105
It was one
of those marriages.

233
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:14,108
Even when I was married
to your sister...

234
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:18,242
when our marriage started
to fall apart...

235
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:21,158
I held on to hope,
because this friend of mine,

236
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,465
this guy that I admired,

237
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,989
who was married to this
really accomplished woman,

238
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:28,252
he was somehow
making it work.

239
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:30,907
[sighs] Sorry.

240
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:33,127
Doesn't make sense to me.

241
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,043
Why bother staying married
if you can't be faithful?

242
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:39,350
Maybe you don't want
to lose someone, so you...

243
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:42,702
start making compromises
with yourself.

244
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:44,747
I don't understand it.

245
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,794
And by the way,
neither will a jury.

246
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:50,361
I don't know how
to sell this to a jury.

247
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:52,320
Well, then let's not sell it.

248
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:55,410
Yeah, but... we have
to present a case.

249
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:59,153
You heard Nate-- he believes
his wife isn't actually dead.

250
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,938
So maybe our defense is:
she isn't.

251
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:03,461
BENNY:
Jury-wise,

252
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,681
I'm guessing we'll be
looking to get rid

253
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,683
of any potential Ava
Lewis Raynor superfans.

254
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,816
They're gonna be looking
for someone to blame,

255
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,818
and Nathan will be
sitting right there.

256
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,124
I don't know, I'm still
kind of hoping they'll be

257
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:17,562
the most desperate to believe
Ava is still with us, you know?

258
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:20,217
It's like the people who think
Tupac faked his own death

259
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,567
or Elvis never left
the building.

260
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,048
I need a jury who will
go for our

261
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,746
"no body, no death"
narrative.

262
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:30,575
I need people for whom
seeing is believing.

263
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,708
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

264
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,101
Anybody here believe in ghosts?

265
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,370
Your Honor,
we'd like to thank

266
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,980
and excuse
these three jurors.

267
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,766
I'm confused. Isn't he supposed
to ask them a question?

268
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,463
Somebody said
they believe in ghosts.

269
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,075
Well... if they're willing
to believe in ghosts,

270
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,990
they might be willing to
believe someone was killed

271
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,949
without anybody being
able to find a body,

272
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:59,430
and those are not the
kind of jurors we need.

273
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:02,259
But we also need to be wary
of jurors with a propensity

274
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:03,739
to blame the husband.

275
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,524
That is a very real
and a very powerful bias.

276
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,613
Anyone who feels
wronged or slighted

277
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:11,573
by a current or former partner
might be more likely

278
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:14,315
to hold Nathan responsible
regardless of the facts.

279
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:17,187
So we need to weed out
anyone with an ax to grind.

280
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,843
Good morning.

281
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,672
Now, I couldn't help but notice
your beautiful wedding ring.

282
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,239
How long have you
been married?

283
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:26,936
Almost nine months.Nine months.

284
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,330
[chuckles]: Wow. You're
practically a newlywed.

285
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:30,853
Congratulations.

286
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:34,161
And how is it going
so far, if I may ask?

287
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:37,120
Hmm. I keep pinching myself.
My husband's a dream.

288
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:39,296
I'm the luckiest girl
in the world.

289
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,909
[quietly]: Marissa,
is there a reason not to?

290
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,519
Yeah, I know
she presents well, Bull,

291
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,782
but juror number two is
on husband number three.

292
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,219
And she was so vindictive
toward her last ex

293
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,396
that she papered his Yelp page
with bad reviews

294
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,050
until his business closed down.

295
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:55,878
Oh, my.

296
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,098
We'd like to thank

297
00:13:58,141 --> 00:13:59,882
and excuse this
juror, Your Honor.

298
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,102
Juror number two,
you're excused.

299
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:05,540
What about you,
Ms. Nelson?

300
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,020
Are you married?

301
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,196
Nope. Single as single could be.

302
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,198
Ah. And how do you
feel about that?

303
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,939
Feeling good.

304
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,505
I like dating.

305
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:16,290
I've met lots of great guys.

306
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,553
I just... always find
a reason to break it off.

307
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:20,729
I think I'm just
one of those people

308
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:22,818
that doesn't want
to be tied down.

309
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,125
I think I've found "the one."

310
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:27,127
Free spirit.
Doesn't hold a grudge.

311
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,477
Please don't tell me
she's a serial killer

312
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,045
with men buried under her house.

313
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,916
All sunshine and rainbows
on my end, Bull.

314
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,223
She doesn't spend a lot of time
on social media,

315
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,703
but when she does,
she's usually trying to debunk

316
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,314
her aunt's conspiracy theories.

317
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:41,576
She likes facts.

318
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,752
So we like her.

319
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,363
This juror's acceptable

320
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,148
to the defense,
Your Honor.

321
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,367
JUDGE:
Then, ladies and gentlemen,

322
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,891
we have our jury.

323
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,109
[gavel bangs]

324
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,851
DANNY:
Clara?

325
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,896
Yes.

326
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,158
Are you Danny?

327
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,378
Thanks for coming down.

328
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:04,338
I have a desk
at Ava's publisher's office,

329
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:07,428
but this was her
favorite spot in the city.

330
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,647
How long have you been
her assistant?

331
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,258
Seven years.

332
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,216
So you must really like the job.

333
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,175
[chuckles]
Well, if you love books,

334
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:16,916
if you love writing, it's...

335
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,918
it's kind of like
winning the lottery.

336
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,397
Ava let me edit her drafts.

337
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:22,530
She helped me
with my own writing.

338
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:25,098
Even offered to pass along
my work to her publisher.

339
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,578
I mean, there was

340
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,102
the normal stuff, too:

341
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:31,974
pick up her dry cleaning,
run her dog to the vet.

342
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:34,716
But that notwithstanding,
it was...

343
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,632
kind of like a dream job.

344
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:40,200
Well, she sounds like
a very nice person to work for.

345
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:42,376
I know that these
last few days

346
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:44,334
have had to be difficult.

347
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,033
And I appreciate you taking
the time to meet with me.

348
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:49,905
I'm told that you were
involved in almost...

349
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,212
every aspect of Ava's life.

350
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:55,258
I guess.And we know that Ava

351
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:58,305
sometimes kept company with
people other than her husband.

352
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:01,090
It would be
incredibly helpful

353
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,483
for Nathan and his defense

354
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:04,572
if you could provide me
with some of those names.

355
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:07,401
I don't know where you're
getting your information,

356
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:09,620
but Ava loved her husband.

357
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,101
Ava adored her husband.

358
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,798
I don't doubt that.
And I appreciate

359
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,452
that you're trying
to protect Ava's legacy.

360
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,411
But we know she
was seeing someone else

361
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:19,021
and wanted to call it off.

362
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,675
We just don't know who.

363
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,984
Look...

364
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,464
I don't know anything for sure,

365
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,989
but after the last
Springersmovie premiere,

366
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:33,035
Ava left a necklace
in her hotel room.

367
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,559
I... went over
the next day

368
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:37,257
to get it...

369
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,348
and I also found a man's watch.

370
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,306
It wasn't Nathan's.

371
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,221
Do you know whose it was?

372
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,310
Not for sure.

373
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:50,400
But Chris wore one just like it.

374
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,055
Who's Chris?

375
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,796
Her driver.

376
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,406
Her bodyguard.

377
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,105
[gavel banging]

378
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:02,673
Your Honor, in light of
the ubiquitous media coverage

379
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,371
surrounding this case,
the People move

380
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:05,981
to sequester the jury.

381
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,330
Your Honor, please.

382
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:09,680
Jury sequestration is

383
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:12,509
an extraordinary
and unwarranted step.

384
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,076
That's why
it's rarely used

385
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,599
in the state
of New York.

386
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,079
It costs
the taxpayers

387
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,864
an exorbitant amount of money
and puts an undue burden

388
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:22,780
on jurors by taking them away
from their homes

389
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:23,999
and their families.

390
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,523
Furthermore, this
jury was not selected

391
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:30,092
based on who could bear
the burden of sequestration.

392
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,399
There could be,
uh, medical issues,

393
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:35,315
childcare considerations...Your Honor,
the People realize

394
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,752
this is an extreme ask,

395
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,536
but if ever a case
warranted it...

396
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,147
JUDGE:
Though your argument

397
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,324
is well-taken, Mr. Colón, given
the extraordinary attention

398
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:48,023
this case has received,
the People's motion is granted.

399
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,070
I order the jury sequestered.

400
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,201
I don't understand.

401
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,291
Why is a sequestered jury
so bad for us?

402
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:58,077
This jury's gonna be cut off
from the outside world.

403
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,080
They will be angry and
want someone to blame.

404
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,908
And in their minds, you're
the reason they're here,

405
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,302
so that someone
will be you.

406
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,484
A background check on the
bodyguard, Chris, turned up

407
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,139
a couple of misdemeanor
assault charges in his past,

408
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:18,793
all domestic, all dismissed.

409
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:22,144
Which is why the security firm
was able to hire him, but...

410
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:25,060
he's a strong guy
with a quick temper
and no alibi.

411
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,933
Claims he was home alone when
the cops think Ava was murdered.

412
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,674
Well, that sounds promising.

413
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,894
[sighs]:
Keep digging.CHUNK: Okay, uh,

414
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:35,549
how are we gonna deal
with the sequestration problem?

415
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,420
I still don't get
why it's a problem.

416
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:40,031
I mean, is it just me,
or doesn't a hotel stay

417
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,556
with someone else footing
the bill sound like heaven?

418
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,818
Mm.
I mean,
who cares

419
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,255
if the jury doesn't
get to watch the news?

420
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,822
They aren't supposed
to anyway.

421
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,563
BENNY: It's not
just the news.

422
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:52,609
All the computers and
televisions are removed
from their rooms.

423
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,917
Their only entertainment
will be group viewings

424
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,920
of preapproved DVDs.

425
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,749
They also handed over
their cell phones.

426
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,055
Any calls with family
have to be on speaker

427
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,841
from a court officer's phone
with him or her listening.

428
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,538
Big Brother, anyone?

429
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:09,887
Hey!

430
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:12,586
It's not like they're
in some 4-Diamond property

431
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:16,198
with a spa and day trips
to the local museum.

432
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,287
They'll have takeout
from the same three restaurants

433
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:19,593
every day.

434
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:21,203
DANNY: Hmm. Point
of information.

435
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,379
Wehave takeout from the same
three restaurants every day.

436
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,728
But we don't
spend 24/7

437
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,730
with only each other to talk to.

438
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,079
A sequestered jury does,

439
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:30,734
and that creates
a groupthink mentality.

440
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:33,128
Okay, uh, not to pour salt
on the wound,

441
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,912
but we go second, right?

442
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:36,218
We are the defense.

443
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,438
By the time
we get to make our case,

444
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,744
won't they just be...
sick of the whole thing?

445
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,833
BULL:
Yep.

446
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,227
Unless they aren't.

447
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,752
Well, the A.D.A. is smart.
To Chunk's point,

448
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:51,146
she'll want
to slow-play her hand

449
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,974
so that the jury is

450
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:55,411
out of patience
by the time it's our turn.

451
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:58,022
We can't let that happen.
We got to keep things moving.

452
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,546
We need to show those jurors

453
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,069
that we're on their side--
we want this thing

454
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:03,332
to be over with
as quickly as they do.

455
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,204
TRUMAN: So, is
it fair to say

456
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,249
that the knife was
the murder weapon?BENNY: Objection!

457
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,903
Asked and answered.

458
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,558
The jury has already heard
Mr. Richards say

459
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:14,125
it was the knife.JUDGE: Sustained.

460
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:16,954
Isn't it true, Mr. Richards,
that DNA was discovered

461
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:19,305
from both the defendant
and the deceased

462
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:22,221
on the handle
of the knife?Your Honor,

463
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,789
we just keep going over
the same ground again and again.

464
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,530
The defense
will happily stipulate

465
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:29,445
to the evidence at the scene.

466
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:32,274
Anything to keep these
proceedings moving.

467
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,233
Marissa, can you break out
some numbers for me

468
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,583
on how the jury's feeling
towards the A.D.A.?

469
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,021
Wow, show's you what Iknow.

470
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:42,632
I wasn't sure your strategy
would actually work,

471
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,939
but the jury
seems annoyed with her.

472
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:47,942
Even better, they're starting
to view Benny as their champion,

473
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:51,467
and some of that goodwill is
starting to flow Nathan's way.

474
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:52,729
In light of this stipulation,

475
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,296
do you have any more questions,
Ms. Truman?

476
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,994
If not, I'm gonna turn
this witness over to Mr. Colón.

477
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:59,780
As a matter
of fact, I do.

478
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:02,173
In addition to
the weapon,

479
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,871
what, if anything,

480
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:07,701
do these spatter patterns tell
us about the crime itself?

481
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,920
About who might have
done it and why?

482
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,922
Well, there are two types

483
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,402
of violent crimes:

484
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:16,797
what we call instrumental crimes
and expressive crimes.

485
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,800
An instrumental crime is likely
to occur between strangers

486
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:21,541
and is usually a means
to an end.

487
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:22,977
How do you mean?

488
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,979
Someone kills a guy
in a convenience store

489
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,981
to get the money
in the cash register.

490
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,243
What you'll usually see

491
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,071
is just enough violence
to get the job done.

492
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:33,074
But that's not
what happened here?No.

493
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,337
In this case, we're looking
at multiple stab wounds

494
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,339
when one or two
would have been enough

495
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:38,862
to end the victim's life.

496
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:40,560
That's why
we call it expressive.

497
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,258
It usually happens
when emotion runs high.

498
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,129
It suggests
an intimate relationship

499
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:48,263
between the victim
and the killer.

500
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,439
An intimate relationship.

501
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:53,399
Like a husband and wife?

502
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:54,922
Like a husband and wife.

503
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,750
TRUMAN:
So,

504
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,839
if I were to surmise
that Nathan Raynor

505
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,841
flew into a murderous rage

506
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:02,930
at the news
his wife was leaving him

507
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:05,193
and stabbed her
multiple times...

508
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:06,368
BENNY:
Objection!

509
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:09,763
Sustained.
You're pushing it, Ms. Truman.

510
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:11,808
Apologies, Your Honor.

511
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,114
I'll withdraw.

512
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:16,204
No further questions.

513
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,206
Remember what I said
about goodwill towards Nathan?

514
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,903
I do.

515
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,688
I think
I may have spoken too soon.

516
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,385
BENNY:
Forensic Specialist

517
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:24,734
Joaquin Richards.

518
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:27,433
Let's talk
about expressive violence.

519
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,478
Violence committed
by an intimate.

520
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:31,262
Now, that intimate

521
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:34,788
wouldn't have to be a husband,
would it?

522
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:36,355
What do you mean?

523
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:40,620
Well, couldn't it
just as easily be... a lover?

524
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,143
[gallery murmuring]

525
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:43,405
I suppose.

526
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,320
But I'm not aware
of any evidence

527
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,366
indicating that
to have been the case.

528
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,889
Ah, evidence.

529
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,543
[sighs]

530
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,545
You know,
I-I must be missing something,

531
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:56,026
but it looks to me
like all of this evidence

532
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,637
that everyone's been discussing

533
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,682
is very much open
to interpretation.

534
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:02,424
Now, here's an example.

535
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:05,471
Can you say without a doubt

536
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:07,386
how many times

537
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,171
the victim was actually stabbed
in that kitchen?

538
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,695
Well, the patterns suggest...It's a yes or no question,

539
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,697
Mr. Richards.

540
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:18,266
No. I cannot.

541
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:19,920
Hmm, I didn't think so.

542
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:22,749
And can you remind the jury,
please?

543
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:27,057
Is there any non-circumstantial
evidence that proves my client,

544
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,233
Nathan Raynor,
was the one

545
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:32,411
who committed whatever violence
occurred in that kitchen?

546
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,370
Well, no. But...

547
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,415
No! Of course not.

548
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,373
And is there any real proof,

549
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,853
any scientific proof

550
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:42,246
that the blood found
in that kitchen

551
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,381
is that of my client's wife,
Ava Lewis Raynor?

552
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,341
Mr. Richards?

553
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:53,344
No. The bleach
degraded the blood.

554
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:56,260
But we did get enough DNA
in our sample

555
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:59,307
to indicate a likely match
to Ava Lewis Raynor.

556
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,701
Ah. Likely, but not certainly?

557
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:04,965
Not certainly.

558
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:06,619
BENNY:
So you have

559
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:10,274
neither conclusive proof
that Ava is actually dead

560
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:11,841
or that Nathan killed her.

561
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,017
Objection! Compound.

562
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:16,411
Overruled. The witness
will answer the question.

563
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,673
No.

564
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,936
I cannot prove
that Ava Lewis Raynor is dead

565
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,069
or that her husband killed her.

566
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,549
Thank you.

567
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:25,942
No further questions,
Your Honor.

568
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:28,597
Well, that worked out
quite nicely.

569
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,120
[elevator bell chimes]

570
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:32,253
BENNY: Where did Nathan
say he was gonna meet us?

571
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:35,604
Sooner we can round him up and
head into the city, the better.

572
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:39,652
Traffic heading into town is
gonna be horrible at this hour.

573
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,571
I got this.Okay.

574
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:50,532
Nate, you coming?

575
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:53,666
We really need
to head back into town.

576
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:57,060
All that stuff your lawyer said
in court today...

577
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,891
Neither of you guys
really believe that.

578
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,980
Do you?

579
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:06,243
I believe you're my friend.

580
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:08,550
I believe you love your wife.

581
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:11,553
And I believe it's my job
to do everything I can

582
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:12,815
to keep you out of prison.

583
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,861
That's very well said.

584
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:19,822
You're a clever man, Jason.
You always were.

585
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:22,825
[exhales]

586
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:26,916
Attorney-client privilege apply
to lifelong friends

587
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,266
even though
you're not a real attorney?

588
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,881
I'm part of your legal team.

589
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:37,405
You can say anything you want.

590
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:40,408
And even if I weren't...I did it.

591
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,453
I did this.

592
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:46,414
I didn't kill her.

593
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:48,416
But I...

594
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,461
but I caused it.

595
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,115
I was the one.

596
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,465
I cheated first. I...

597
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,511
I broke us.

598
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:01,951
I was this wildly successful
finance guy,

599
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:04,606
and she was my adoring wife.

600
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:08,436
Then the first
Springersbook hit,

601
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:11,787
and suddenly she belonged
to the whole world.

602
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,833
Not just to me.

603
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,141
I couldn't handle it.

604
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,796
My ego couldn't handle it.

605
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,626
I don't know why
I let her success do that to me.

606
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,628
Makes no sense, but...

607
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,674
then I needed...

608
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:33,635
Then I needed a shoulder
to cry on.

609
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:38,031
So I went out and found one.

610
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,076
And then another.

611
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,557
And another.

612
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,821
[chuckles softly]

613
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:48,868
And then she found shoulders
of her own.

614
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,178
[chuckles softly]

615
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:58,573
So if some angry lover
killed Ava...

616
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,577
...it was my fault.

617
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,275
I set the whole thing in motion.

618
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:08,496
I did it.

619
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,543
[sighs]

620
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:16,199
[phone vibrates]

621
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,120
I'll be right back.

622
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:30,300
Sorry to pull you away,
but we have a problem.

623
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:33,216
The A.D.A. just called.

624
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,350
A hunter and his dog just found
a corpse in the forest

625
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:39,788
27 miles north of here.

626
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:42,269
They found the body.

627
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:44,314
They found Ava.

628
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,193
Look at these jurors.
They're all red,

629
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:55,369
and they're all miserable.

630
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:56,675
They haven't even
had the thrill

631
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,328
of being in court
for the last two days

632
00:27:58,372 --> 00:27:59,982
while they wait
for the medical examiner

633
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:01,288
to finish examining the body.

634
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:02,419
TAYLOR:
They miss their families.

635
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:03,682
They miss their own beds.

636
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,858
They miss food
that doesn't come out of a box.

637
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,511
I don't think
it can get any worse.

638
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:09,252
Oh, it can.

639
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,863
And it will.

640
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:13,039
We chose
a "seeing is believing" jury,

641
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:15,737
and as soon as
the forensic testing is done

642
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:18,044
and court resumes,

643
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:20,916
they are going to actually see
that there actually is a body.

644
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,223
A body that was
stabbed 12 times.

645
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:24,790
By a kitchen knife.

646
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,443
Most likely by
an intimate.

647
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,184
Everything the
A.D.A. asserted.

648
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:31,231
Sounds like it's time
for a plan B.

649
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,192
What if we put the
driver/bodyguard on the stand?

650
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,194
Chris?

651
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:40,893
Ask him about the watch he
left behind at the hotel.

652
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,591
Let the jurors pick up
on the inference.

653
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,158
Maybe rile the
guy up a bit.

654
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,942
Show the jurors
his temper.

655
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,858
Let them see that he could just
as easily have been Ava's killer

656
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:51,947
as Nathan.BENNY: Not bad.

657
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,601
More reasonable doubt.

658
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:55,559
I don't think
you want to go there.

659
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:58,606
I've been going back over the
medical examiner's report,

660
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,304
and there's a lot of postmortem
bruising on Ava's corpse.

661
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:03,611
That points to somebody
really manhandling the body.

662
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:05,004
Struggling with it.

663
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:08,007
Having a hard time moving it,
burying it.

664
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,227
Ava weighs 106 pounds.

665
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:13,664
Her bodyguard could bench-press
that in his sleep.

666
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,797
MARISSA: Yeah, but we don't need
to prove that Chris did it.

667
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,103
Just that he could have.

668
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,714
Well, I don't think
he could have.

669
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,281
Dr. Bull.

670
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:23,979
Oh, what do we have here?

671
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:26,068
"Further investigation revealed

672
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:28,114
"that the vast majority
of the wounds

673
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:29,985
were on the left side
of the victim's body."

674
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:31,682
And she was stabbed
from the front,

675
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:33,772
which means the killer
was right-handed.

676
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,208
Chris is left-handed.

677
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:38,167
So, what's our play?

678
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:40,474
BULL:
The only one we have.

679
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:42,084
We put Nathan on the stand.

680
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:44,652
Let him tell the truth and...

681
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,654
hope to God
the jury believes him.

682
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:49,396
Did you kill your wife,
Mr. Raynor?

683
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,181
No.

684
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,922
We made mistakes.

685
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,663
Imade mistakes.

686
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,230
But there wasn't a moment

687
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,059
from the time we met

688
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:02,801
that we weren't together here.

689
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,803
Here.

690
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,326
BENNY:
Thank you.

691
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,024
No further questions,
Your Honor.

692
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,333
No real movement here.

693
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:15,422
Well, that's better
than the alternative.

694
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,032
Let's brace for impact.

695
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,861
Mr. Raynor,

696
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:22,733
do you, by any chance,
wear reading glasses?

697
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,477
Yes. I wear reading glasses.

698
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:30,393
Could you describe
those glasses for me?

699
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,396
Uh, well, I have
quite a few.

700
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,834
Um, they're inexpensive.

701
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,923
Usually get them
at the drug store.

702
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:39,794
Usually buy black. 2.0.

703
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,969
Marissa, why are we talking

704
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:42,971
about reading glasses?
I don't know,

705
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,712
and I don't like
that I don't know.

706
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,888
I'm sorry, Bull. I-I'm
not seeing anything

707
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:48,629
in discovery about
reading glasses.

708
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:51,066
Nothing in the reports.

709
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,113
Are these your glasses,
Mr. Raynor?

710
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:57,420
I don't know.

711
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,118
They look like they could be.

712
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:02,469
Your Honor, the People would
like to enter into evidence

713
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:05,689
this pair of reading glasses
found in a forest preserve

714
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,910
five yards
from Ava Lewis Raynor's corpse

715
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:10,781
and this report

716
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:12,914
stating that several
of Nathan Raynor's cells

717
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,961
were found on these glasses.

718
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:21,488
I don't really have
any great answers

719
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:23,316
for you.
Ava would borrow

720
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:25,492
my glasses sometimes.

721
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,668
That's all I can think of.

722
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,458
The problem is,

723
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:37,765
our "seeing is believing" jury

724
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:39,941
is now convinced that,
when they're looking at you,

725
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,987
they're looking at
your wife's killer.

726
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:45,207
Are they right?

727
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,258
I'm not a killer, Jason.

728
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:54,086
You know that.

729
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:55,957
You know me.

730
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,959
Yeah, well,

731
00:31:58,003 --> 00:31:59,961
I thought I did.

732
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:03,399
What, you mean
my-my marriage?

733
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:06,054
[scoffs]
What do you want me to say?

734
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,752
It's not something
you share with friends.

735
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:11,320
It's not something
I'm terribly proud of.

736
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:14,802
It does not make me a killer.

737
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:17,718
I know.

738
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,242
And I know this sounds
ridiculous, but...

739
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:22,984
I thought you guys were it.

740
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:25,987
[scoffs]
Nobody's "it."

741
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:29,034
We're all just people,

742
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:32,167
living our lives.

743
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:33,516
[elevator bell chimes]

744
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,519
[exhales]

745
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,218
[knocking]

746
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:41,002
Yeah.

747
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:43,613
We were all thinking
of getting out of here.

748
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:46,529
Do you need anything
before I go?

749
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:51,534
[exhales]
I think my friend

750
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:54,015
is gonna spend the rest
of his life in prison.

751
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,409
And I think I failed him.

752
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:58,541
And I'm embarrassed to say that,

753
00:32:58,585 --> 00:32:59,890
at one point today,

754
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,544
I actually made the conversation

755
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:05,635
about how he might have
failed me.

756
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:10,858
Bull, come on.

757
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:13,687
You haven't
failed anybody.

758
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,341
This thing
isn't over yet.

759
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:16,429
[knocking]

760
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:17,865
They just want to know
if they can go.

761
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:20,041
It's okay! Go ahead!
I'll be leaving in a minute.

762
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:22,522
Can I show you something I was
just finally able to decrypt?

763
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:24,393
Do you mind if I
turn on the light?

764
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:30,747
[exhales]
What am I looking at?

765
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:33,011
TAYLOR: Text messages.
Every number Ava texted

766
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,316
during the last week
of her life.

767
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,404
There are only four.

768
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,363
Nathan, Chris,
her assistant,

769
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:39,756
and her publisher.

770
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,368
And where do I start?

771
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,935
"I want to spare you
the soul-crushing pain

772
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:48,069
of reading Clara's attempt
at a book."

773
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:50,985
And who is she texting,
her publisher?

774
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,247
Hmm.

775
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,989
"Her novel is excruciating.
Unpublishable.

776
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,295
"I'm just
gonna tell her

777
00:33:56,338 --> 00:34:00,429
"you passed
and let her down gently.

778
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:04,781
I'm just giving you a heads-up
in case she asks about it."

779
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:06,435
And this Clara...?

780
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,567
She's Ava's assistant.

781
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,177
She told me that
she was writing a book

782
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,223
and that Ava promised to help
get it to the right people.

783
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:13,834
And that proves...?

784
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:15,444
[exhales]
I mean,

785
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:18,708
if this Clara was angry
that her publisher rejected her,

786
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,319
why would she go after Ava?

787
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:22,277
TAYLOR: What if she saw
Ava's phone, saw the text,

788
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,845
found out Ava never even sent
the manuscript?

789
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:27,326
Mm. Well, the problem is,
it's just a theory,

790
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:29,284
and the jury needs proof

791
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:30,981
if they are going
to acquit Nathan.

792
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:31,721
DANNY:
What about

793
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:32,940
the postmortem bruising?

794
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:34,768
I mean, it makes sense
that a female killer

795
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,465
would have a much harder
time moving Ava's body

796
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:37,597
than some big burly guy.

797
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,599
A female killer.

798
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,471
MARISSA: We were scouring
for sightings of a man.

799
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,299
A supposed lover, not a woman.

800
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:45,866
Let me go back
through the database,

801
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,476
see if there are
any statements that mention

802
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,478
a woman fitting
Clara's description.

803
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:51,654
And I'll try and trace
where she was the day Ava died.

804
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:54,875
Maybe there's traffic cameras
near the lake house?

805
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,054
I'm sorry,

806
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,840
you were saying something
about failing someone?

807
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,712
Did I even say "come in"?

808
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:07,540
Can't a man wallow in self-pity

809
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,412
without his employees barging in
and pelting him with hope?

810
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:14,503
People take all the fun
out of feeling bad.

811
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,549
[grunts softly]

812
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:24,296
BENNY: Good morning,
Ms. Larson.

813
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,862
Really appreciate

814
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,473
you being here.

815
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:30,824
I know you must still be reeling
from Mrs. Raynor's death.

816
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:32,652
I'm not sure
I'll ever stop reeling.

817
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:34,219
Ah.

818
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:37,570
Can you please explain
to the jury

819
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:42,662
exactly who you were
to the late Ava Lewis Raynor?

820
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:44,968
I was her personal assistant.

821
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,883
Mm. In fact,

822
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:48,146
she called you her other,

823
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,147
didn't she?Mm.

824
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,626
[chuckles]

825
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,629
I'm sorry, I'm gonna need you
to speak your answers.

826
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:54,848
Uh, yes.

827
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:56,371
That's what she called me.Ah.

828
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,721
And just to help the jury
paint a picture here,

829
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:01,985
you were Ava's personal
assistant for over seven years.

830
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,336
Isn't that correct?

831
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,686
Yes. Seven years-plus.

832
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:09,602
And what does being
a personal assistant

833
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:12,213
for a famous novelist entail?

834
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:15,129
Well, in the beginning,
it was mostly mundane things.

835
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,218
Um, pick up her cleaning,

836
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,480
take her
to doctors' appointments.

837
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:19,960
But, over the years,

838
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:22,049
it got much more...

839
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:24,094
creative, much more intimate.

840
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:26,358
Copy edit her early
drafts, discuss

841
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:29,535
plot points,
function as a sounding board.

842
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:30,753
Wow.

843
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,626
So you really had
a front row seat.

844
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,889
I-I'm guessing you
weren't just...

845
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:38,674
intimately involved
in her creative life.

846
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,328
You must have been

847
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:43,810
very aware of what was
happening in her personal life.

848
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:45,420
Well...

849
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:46,900
to an extent.

850
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:49,903
Um, we were really close.

851
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,819
Which, I suppose,
was to be expected.Mm.

852
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:55,474
And how were you compensated
for your work, Ms. Larson?

853
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:56,562
Compensated?

854
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:57,824
You mean paid?

855
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:58,781
Mm.

856
00:36:58,825 --> 00:36:59,826
I got a salary.

857
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:00,827
Every week.

858
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,089
Anything else?

859
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,874
Any... perks?

860
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:07,747
I mean, you wanted to be
a writer, right?

861
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,315
Did she offer any tips?

862
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:13,883
Uh, promise to open up
some doors for you or...?

863
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:15,233
Objection. Where
are we going?

864
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,712
What are we doing?
Relevance?

865
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:18,410
BENNY: I can assure the court
that the relationship

866
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,021
between Ms. Larson
and the deceased

867
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:24,851
is extremely relevant
to my client's defense.

868
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:26,853
Overruled.

869
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:28,724
BENNY:
Thank you.

870
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,250
Didn't Mrs. Raynor

871
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,731
offer to show your work
to her publisher?

872
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:36,906
Yes.

873
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,865
Yes, she did.

874
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:42,042
And I'd bet you'd be
pretty upset if she didn't.

875
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:43,913
Huh?

876
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:47,787
After all of these years
of doing everything for her,

877
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,919
if she went back on her word...

878
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:52,226
Objection. Counsel
is testifying.

879
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,793
Sustained.

880
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:59,320
Now, you mentioned

881
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:02,802
dropping Mrs. Raynor off
at appointments.

882
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:04,891
You own a car, Ms. Larson?

883
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:06,153
I do.

884
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:07,328
A gray sedan?

885
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:09,287
Is that correct?Yes.

886
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,594
And where were you
on Monday the 28th,

887
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:15,467
the night the police believe

888
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,686
Ava Lewis Raynor was murdered?

889
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,948
I was at home.

890
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,298
By myself.

891
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,865
Ah. Really?

892
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,389
That's...

893
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:27,174
that's interesting.

894
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:30,786
Because a young lady
with blonde hair, about...

895
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,397
your height,
your weight,

896
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,355
your age was seen

897
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,443
driving a sedan

898
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:38,141
on the very night in question.

899
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:39,317
Here it comes.

900
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,361
Wait for it.

901
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:41,797
BENNY:
A few days ago,

902
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:45,366
after Ava's body was found
in the forest,

903
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,412
the owner
of a nearby hardware store

904
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:50,240
had reported that
he'd sold a shovel

905
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:52,547
to a young blonde woman

906
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:55,724
on the night we now know
Ava was murdered.

907
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,857
Yeah, he said
that she was

908
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,945
pretty anxious,

909
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:01,164
even shaking a little.

910
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,472
And after we reviewed
the in-store video,

911
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:07,083
ooh, he was absolutely right.

912
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:09,782
She sure was anxious.

913
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:12,393
She was shaking.

914
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,395
See,

915
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,355
that's the thing
about crimes of passion.

916
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:20,488
They're very difficult
to plan for.

917
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:23,404
Someone's
always forgetting a shovel.

918
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:25,711
[gallery murmuring][gavel banging]

919
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:29,236
BULL:
Come on,

920
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,151
was that worth the wait or what?

921
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:33,849
You sure you weren't shovel
shopping that night, Ms. Larson?

922
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:36,374
[loud murmuring]

923
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,897
JUDGE:
Order!

924
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,683
The witness
will answer the question.

925
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:43,381
Ooh, that's okay.
That's all right.

926
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:45,295
She doesn't need to answer.

927
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:48,951
See, the store owner
got a partial license plate,

928
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:52,520
and my office handed it over
to the FBI this morning.

929
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:55,305
Th-They're actually searching
your car as we speak.

930
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:56,872
I'm sure their findings

931
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,440
will make the answer
abundantly clear.

932
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:01,399
[exhales]
Thank you.

933
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,575
No further questions,
Your Honor.

934
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:14,977
[Nathan exhales]

935
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:17,893
Still can't bring myself
to go inside the house.

936
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:20,418
I should probably
just sell it.

937
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,420
But the lake...

938
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:25,771
the lake
reminds me of Ava.

939
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:30,297
When I'm here,
it's like she's...

940
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,431
still with me, you know?

941
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:39,001
Nathan,

942
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:41,526
I'm sorry.

943
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:45,443
I owe you an apology.

944
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:46,966
Are you kidding me?

945
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,184
You kept me out of prison.

946
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:50,099
I owe you.

947
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:52,754
I said some things.

948
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:55,148
I made some judgments.

949
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:56,497
[sighs]

950
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,803
I wasn't there.

951
00:40:57,846 --> 00:41:01,154
I wasn't inside your marriage.

952
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:03,722
I'm sorry.

953
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,855
It's okay.

954
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:10,380
You're just a guy who loved
his wife the best he could.

955
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:13,035
Nothing else really matters.

956
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,690
I just hope Ava knew.

957
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm pretty sure she did.

958
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,005
Her last manuscript.

959
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,876
Read the dedication.

960
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:33,099
"Nathan... the dock to my boat,

961
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:35,493

962
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:39,758

Always."
