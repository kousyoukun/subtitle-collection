00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:12,621
Whoo!

[laughs]

00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:17,060
Morgan, move!

00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:22,370
Morgan!

7
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,632
Morgan!

DISPATCHER:
All units be on the lookout

9
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,421
for a white church van

10
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:32,249
with heavy frontal damage.It's long gone.

11
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:36,993
Whoa. Forget I said anything.

12

[siren wailing]

13
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:44,261
Come to Papa.Unit 1-5-2,

14
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,220
we are northbound on River Road
just past Cannon.

15
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:47,699
Show us following a vehicle

16
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:50,180
possibly involved in felony
hit-and-run 45 minutes ago.

17
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,052
White Ford van
with license plate

18
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:55,664
nine, Eddie, three, seven,
Larry, Peter. Requesting backup.

[indistinct radio chatter]

20
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:21,733
Lower the window, then place
your hands back on the wheel.

21
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:29,480
Have you fellas found the woman?
Is she okay?

22
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,004
Sir, I smell alcohol.
Have you been drinking?

23
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:34,398
ANDY:
Oh, well...

24
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:40,012
I...Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

25
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,275
Keep your hands
in front of you.

26
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:42,841
But what about the girl?

27
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:44,104
Step out of the vehicle, now.

28
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,379
[church bell ringing]

You can set
your watch to it.

Sunday morning.

Benjamin Colón,
Attorney at Law emerges

33
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:16,005
from 9:00 mass looking

34
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:20,183
renewed and refreshed.[laughs]

35
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:24,318
Monsignor Espinoza! Wow!
Ah, I see you're slumming it.

36
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,015
Huh, what,
they bump you

37
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,190
back down to
parish priest?
[laughs]

38
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,018
Aren't you supposed
to be working the door

39
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,672
at St. Patrick's
Cathedral?
Hey, hey.

40
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,891
Do not be a wise guy.
Remember who I work for?

41
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:35,242
Ah, indeed, indeed.

42
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,765
So good to
see you, Father.

43
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:39,028
What brings you back down here?

44
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,596
You.

45
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,728
Your church needs
your help, Benny.

46
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,687
Mm. Promise you,
Monsignor,

47
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,733
I'm putting every dime
I can spare in that plate.

48
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:51,083
I mean professionally.

49
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:54,174
One of our parish priests
out on the end of Long Island,

50
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,045
Father Andy Tincher,

51
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:58,221
has been charged
in a hit-and-run.

52
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:01,181
Victim was a young woman
out jogging with her sister.

53
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:05,272
Yeah, I read about that.
Absolutely tragic.

54
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:09,580
But, I mean, what can I do?

55
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:12,888
I have to believe the diocese's
attorneys have it all covered,

56
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,586
and frankly,
from everything I've read,

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,459
the best move, maybe,
is to get your guys in there

58
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:19,416
and have them work out

59
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,896
a plea deal.

60
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,898
It's-it's a bit more
complicated than that.

61
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,771
They hit someone,

62
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:29,905
drove right to this church,
and then went to confession?

63
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:32,386
No, no, it was
a church van.

64
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:34,518
Whoever it was,
was driving a church van,

65
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:36,999
so they drove straight
back to the church,

66
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:40,307
Father Andy saw whoever it was,
saw that they were upset,

67
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,265
got them to
confess to him,

68
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,006
then tried to get
them to call 911.

69
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,835
And they wouldn't?Nope.

70
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,012
Worse still, the driver
didn't even know

71
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:52,536
if the victim was alive or dead.

72
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,800
So Father Andy did
the only thing he could do.

73
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,019
[elevator bell chimes]

74
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:00,022
So why didn't the
priest call 911?

75
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:02,503
Well, the Confessional Seal
demands that a priest

76
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:06,855
never reveal anything disclosed
to him during confession.

77
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:09,466
Father Andy thought
the victim might be

78
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,642
suffering on the side
of some dark road,

79
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:14,123
so he got back in
the van to find her

80
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,864
and see if
he could help.

81
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,301
With a blood alcohol
count of .09.

82
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:20,303
[elevator bell chimes]

83
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,957
Fine, he-he's guilty
of drunk driving,

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,699
no one is disputing that, but
the rest of it is exactly why

85
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:26,701
Monsignor Espinoza
needs our help.

86
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:28,833
He knows how this is
gonna sound to a jury.

87
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,095
Oh, Benny.
No, Bull,

88
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,489
you're not, you're not
hearing me.

89
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,317
This isn't just about
a hit-and-run.

90
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:38,278
This is about the Church--
the Roman Catholic Church,

91
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,368
the largest Christian church
in the world--

92
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:44,240
going to court to protect
the sanctity of confession,

93
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,763
one of the bedrock principles

94
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,678
of the religion,
and they want you and me

95
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:50,028
to make that case for them.

96
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:53,162
I feel terribly for
the poor woman's family.

97
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,512
I mean, trying to grieve
with all of this going on?

98
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:59,908
I think it's just best we
focus on the defense, Father.

99
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,910
BULL: As I'm sure
you know, Father,

100
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,825
as officers of the court,
there are any number

101
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:07,002
of privileges
that we deal with.

102
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:10,571
Attorney-client.
Doctor-patient.

103
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:13,661
But the Confessional Seal
is considerably broader

104
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:16,403
than what we've
worked with before.

105
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,536
So I just need to get a sense
of how big a blind spot it is

106
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,885
we're dealing
with here.

107
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:25,368
Of course, of course. Fire away.

108
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:28,850
So this someone, whose
name you can't share,

109
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,635
hits the woman
with the church van,

110
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,637
comes back here
and confesses.

111
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,683
Yeah.

112
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:38,686
And after that,
how did they leave?

113
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,254
Excuse me? I don't follow.

114
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:44,300
BENNY:
I-I think what

115
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,259
Dr. Bull is asking is,
what occurred

116
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:50,219
after the sacrament
of confession was performed?

117
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,352
Maybe there are some things
that you can tell us,

118
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,137
without violating the Seal,
that can help us

119
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,053
find the person
who actually did this.

120
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,447
I mean, wouldn't that
be the best

121
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,579
outcome for all of us?

122
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:09,978
I don't think I'm
gonna be much help here.

123
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:12,720
I mean...

124
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:14,809
if this had occurred

125
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:17,986
in the confessional booth,

126
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,684
I couldn't divulge information
about the confessor

127
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,120
as they left the church

128
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,732
because they're on the
other side of the curtain.

129
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:27,082
It's designed that way
on purpose.

130
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,955
I'm not supposed to see
who's offering the confession.

131
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,174
BULL:
But this confession

132
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:34,437
didn't take place
in a confessional booth.

133
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:37,832
It was in the church driveway.

134
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:42,053
I don't think where you confess
makes a difference to God.

135
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,797
Have you had any contact
with the driver

136
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:49,365
since he or she
made the confession?

137
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,282
It feels like these questions
are really all just an effort

138
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:56,981
to get to the identity
of the confessor,

139
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,418
which you have to understand,

140
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,421
I'm not at liberty to disclose.

141
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:03,423
I mean, not without
violating the spirit

142
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,425
of the Confessional Seal.

143
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,036
Father Andy, I don't know
what to tell you.

144
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,690
You were caught

145
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,040
in the van with
the victim's blood on it.

146
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,476
You were drunk.

147
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,783
You're being charged
with vehicular manslaughter,

148
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,872
leaving the scene
of an accident,

149
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:19,090
and driving under the influence.

150
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:21,353
The prosecution
has a very strong case.

151
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:22,920
Now, I'm not asking you
to break your vows

152
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:25,706
or the Confessional Seal,

153
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:29,318
but I can't defend you if you
won't help defend yourself.

154
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:31,581
Huh?

155
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,627
You just-- you got to give me
something to work with.

156
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:38,109
I'll understand
if you can't help me.

157
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,765
Will you really?

158
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,202
You're willing to spend
15 or 20 years in prison

159
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:45,943
for something you didn't do?

160
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:49,294
Do you believe in God, Dr. Bull?

161
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:52,863
Well, when I'm on a plane

162
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,517
and there's a lot of turbulence,

163
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,215
I sometimes wish I'd gone
to church a bit more,

164
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,479
but day in and day out?

165
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:02,394
Confession is a...
is a gift of grace

166
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:05,615
and a way back to God
for those who are lost.

167
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,313
It saves lives and souls.

168
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:12,187
I understand.

169
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,190
This is not a choice
for me, gentlemen.

170
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,105
I mean, confession's
not an obstacle to overcome

171
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,368
so you can catch
whoever did this.

172
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:22,589
It's-it's an essential step
on the path to redemption

173
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:25,853
for that tortured soul
who killed that woman.

174
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:29,117
So, no.

175
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,250
I can't give you
something to work with.

176
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:33,643
I'm doing the only thing

177
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,645
I know how.

178
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,126
I'm putting my trust in God.

179
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,576
Thing that makes
turbulence so frightening

180
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,013
is you never
see it coming.

181
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,672
Mr. Colón and I would be pleased
to represent you, Father.

182
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,068
♪

183
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:19,384
Ah. Don't think I've ever
tried a case in Suffolk County.

184
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,865
Well, that's the judge,
uh, there's the jury,

185
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:25,695
and we sit here.
Mm.

186
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:28,263
All right. So what's the plan?

187
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:31,745
Win.

188
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:35,400
Well, we need to make sure
whoever ends up in that jury box

189
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,794
understand the only reason
Father Andy was in that van

190
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:41,276
was because he made a solemn vow
he could not break.

191
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:42,843
Well, that doesn't
sound so tough.

192
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:45,280
People understand vows.

193
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,282
Marriage vows...

194
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:49,240
Well, you would
be surprised.

195
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,155
For most people, the idea
of going to prison

196
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,942
just to keep a promise,
that's gonna be a tough sell.

197
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:57,553
And it's not like we can put
Father Andy on the stand.

198
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,339
Why not? I can't imagine
a more trustworthy witness.

199
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,428
Well, the problem is he's
not gonna be able to answer

200
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:05,213
the questions the other
side is gonna ask,

201
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,780
and the jury's gonna
hold that against him.

202
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:10,522
They're gonna feel like he's
hiding something, which he is.

203
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,089
Even if it's for
the right reasons?

204
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,614
Trust me, it's human nature.

205
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,529
If someone's got a secret,
we want to know what it is.

206
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:19,749
What about these jurors?

207
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,403
I'm assuming we're
looking for Catholics,

208
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:23,971
or at the very least,
regular churchgoers?

209
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,756
Not necessarily.
Believe it or not,

210
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,150
church attendance is not always
such a great indicator

211
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,892
of a person's spiritual life.

212
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:34,764
I see that you attend
Hope Baptist Church?

213
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,332
17 years. Every Sunday.

214
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,334
MARISSA:
That may be what she's doing

215
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,249
on Sundays,
but the rest of the week,

216
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:43,338
she's having an
"emotional affair" via text

217
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,688
with a man from Albuquerque
she's never met,

218
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:49,300
and who her husband
is totally unaware of.

219
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,741
What we want are
moral objectivists.

220
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:57,134
Jurors with a strong
internal code

221
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:58,919
that doesn't change
with societal whims

222
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,703
and bureaucratic rules.

223
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:03,532
They're duty bound,
they know the value of a secret,

224
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:07,188
and more importantly, expect
everyone to keep their word.

225
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,711
Good morning, sir.

226
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:11,061
I see, from your
jury questionnaire

227
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,280
that you have
a 14-year-old daughter.

228
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:13,716
I do.

229
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,805
By any chance,
does she keep a diary?

230
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,808
She calls it a journal.Ah.

231
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,810
You ever think
about looking at it?

232
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,246
Reading it?

233
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,596
No. That's not...

234
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,989
What if

235
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,512
you were worried about her?

236
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,514
Something going on behaviorally

237
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,821
and she won't
talk to you about?

238
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:34,302
No. I couldn't.

239
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,738
It's hers.

240
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:37,348
BENNY:
Your Honor,

241
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,481
this juror is acceptable
to the defense.

242
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:44,051
And this is my domain.

243
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,530
Is this where someone would come

244
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,750
if they wanted
to check out the van?

245
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,883
[sighs]
If we still had one,

246
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,147
and you wanted to use it,
this is where you would come.

247
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,409
And the drivers?

248
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:57,499
Well, there's Father Andy,
of course,

249
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,415
and me, and eight others
are authorized to take it.

250
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,853
I'll get you the names.

251
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:06,638
How do you keep track of who
has the van at any given time?

252
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:11,774
Oh, well, every trip is entered
on the calendar.

253
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:14,995
We don't want our choir stranded

254
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:18,302
because someone decided to get
groceries for the kitchen.

255
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,347
And the key?

256
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,784
We keep it in here.

257
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,874
Only authorized drivers
are given the combination.

258
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:27,572
And we have this log,

259
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,183
which is where they're supposed
to sign out

260
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:30,619
whenever they take the key.

261
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,448
Unfortunately,
no one signed out

262
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,710
the night of the accident.

263
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:38,583
Oh, my gosh!

264
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:39,976
There he is.

265
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,978
Jacob. Harvard?

266
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,154
Oh, that is amazing.

267
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:45,895
I have been praying
you would hear good news.

268
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,114
Thanks.

269
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,159
ERIC:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

270
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,465
In the meantime,
we're all starving here.

271
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:51,727
Pizza should be
arriving any minute.

272
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,121
I'll get you your petty cash.

273
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:00,301
Oh. Give me a second.

274
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,838
I understand you also had
an opportunity to examine

275
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:18,928
the vehicle involved,
the St. Bernadine's church van?

276
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:21,235
Yes, I did.

277
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:22,627
And this wasn't
your first encounter

278
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,978
with this particular vehicle,
was it?

279
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,936
No.

280
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,765
MADDEN: Can you
tell us about it?

281
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,855
I stopped to assist Father Andy
two years ago.

282
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,465
He was in the same van

283
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:35,858
on the side of the road
with a flat tire.

284
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:38,469
Was there anything unusual
about this interaction?

285
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:44,388
He had clearly been drinking.

286
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:45,912
[people gasping]

287
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,130
BENNY:
Your Honor?

288
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:48,088
May we approach?

289
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,570
Your Honor,

290
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,877
this is impermissible
character evidence.

291
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,532
We all know that
the prosecution isn't permitted

292
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,969
to prove conduct
through a prior bad act.

293
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,710
MADDEN: Defense counsel asserted
in his opening statement

294
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:04,147
that the defendant
never would have driven drunk

295
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:05,322
but for the alleged confession.

296
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,758
He opened the door to this.

297
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:08,543
We're permitted--
in fact, we're obligated--

298
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,240
to refute that defense.

299
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,026
I'm gonna allow it.

300
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:21,730
And did you arrest the defendant
at that time? Cite him?

301
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:24,646
No.

302
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,735
He was a priest,
and I felt sorry for him,

303
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,955
so I drove him
back to the church.

304
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,913
No further questions,
Your Honor.

305
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,959
So how bad is it?

306
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,483
How bad would you like it?

307
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,093
We've lost them all.

308
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:38,486
Not a single green in the bunch.

309
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,409
ANDY: I never
put it together.

310
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,629
Not even when the
officer took the stand.

311
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,937
I-It's not like he, he asked me
if I'd been drinking, or...

312
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,330
It's not like he gave me

313
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,984
a breathalyzer test.

314
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:01,074
I-I was trying to change a tire
and he came over to help.

315
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,990
And, like, a
minute in, he said,

316
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:07,819
"How about I just give you
a ride back to the church?"

317
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:09,865
I'm guessing he could
smell it on you.

318
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,737
It's not like that.
I-I'd come from a wedding.

319
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:15,697
No. Sorry. It is like that.

320
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,918
You're on trial for murder,
for killing a young woman

321
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,093
while driving
under the influence.

322
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,964
I wasn't drunk.

323
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,401
I think I'd had two glasses
of wine. Maybe three...

324
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:26,534
BENNY: Father Andy,
we really need to know,

325
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:29,580
are there gonna be
any other surprises?

326
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,713
No. I'm certain of it. No.

327
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:34,063
Unfortunately, Officer Avery's
testimony made it sound

328
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,196
like this was
a pattern of behavior.

329
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:39,939
I'm gonna need you
to take the stand.

330
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:43,029
Uh... what would be the point?

331
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:45,335
I mean, what would
you want me to say?

332
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,339
The truth.

333
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,080
I need you to talk about
the night of the flat tire.

334
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:53,474
There's no confession involved.

335
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,519
You don't need to talk
about anybody but yourself.

336
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:59,436
It'll give the jurors a chance
to see who you really are.

337
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,699
That you're forthcoming.

338
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,440
That you're not afraid
to take the witness stand,

339
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,529
and most importantly,

340
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:09,098
that you're not someone
who normally drinks and drives.

341
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:16,018
And what happens if they start
asking about the hit-and-run?

342
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,760
We'll invoke
the cleric-penitent privilege.

343
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,980
What choice do we have?

344
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,633
CHUNK:
So,

345
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,026
at this
particular reception,

346
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,029
how many drinks
would you say you had?

347
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,900
Two.

348
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:30,946
Maybe three-- glasses of wine.

349
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,992
Two? Maybe three?

350
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,776
You don't remember?

351
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,431
I mean, w-was it two or three?

352
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,868
Well, truthfully,
I can't be sure.

353
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,609
It was over two years ago.

354
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:45,308
Well, you testified that you-you
really don't drink that often.

355
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:48,703
So I would think that you would
remember if it was two or three.

356
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:52,141
Maybe I'll just answer "three"
next time.

357
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:55,231
Ask me something else.

358
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:59,192
So it's your testimony, Father,

359
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:02,456
that the only two times

360
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,893
that you've been stopped
by law enforcement

361
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:08,288
happened to also be the only
two times that you've drank

362
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:11,508
and then got behind
the wheel of a car?

363
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,902
I-I... Now, I know
how that sounds.

364
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:18,167
I've-I've heard all the stories
and all the jokes about

365
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,517
drunken priests.

366
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,958
Go to a wedding,
everybody's dressed up,

367
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:29,439
everybody's there
to have a good time.

368
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:34,053
And there I am, with my collar
and my vows and my Bible,

369
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:37,491
and I'm-I'm a-a silent reminder

370
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:41,147
to everyone, uh,
not to have too much fun.

371
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,411
Not to have too good a time.

372
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:48,458
And what I've discovered
over the years is that

373
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,244
if I'm holding
a glass of something--

374
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,116
i-if I'm holding
a glass of anything--

375
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,075
people relax a little bit.

376
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,426
They-they forget a little bit.

377
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:02,646
Okay. That's better.

378
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,476
That's warmer,
it's a touch more human.

379
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,089
But frankly, the jury doesn't
want to hear excuses,

380
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:13,179
or that you drink to make them
feel more comfortable.

381
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,746
A woman is dead.

382
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,097
And you know what happened
and you won't tell anyone

383
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,403
and you're asking for a pass.

384
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:25,016
And so what I want in return--
what, what they want in return--

385
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,627
is to feel that they know you.

386
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,411
To feel that they can trust you.

387
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:31,284
Okay. How do I do that?

388
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,895
Take ownership of your mistakes.

389
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:36,767
"I drank too much. Period.

390
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,336
"I should not have
driven myself home. Period.

391
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,512
"I vowed to never
do it again.

392
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,384
"Period.
The night of the hit-and-run

393
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,995
"is a completely
different thing. Period.

394
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,606
"There was a woman on the side
of the road who needed help

395
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,176
and I was determined
to help her. Period."

396
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,178
[exhales]

397
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:59,094
Is this the way
you always do it,

398
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,270
prepare people for court?

399
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:03,881
I mean, you
raise your voice?

400
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:07,015
You taunt them?

401
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:09,017
Or is this just for me?

402
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,628
No.

403
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,630
I have a complicated
relationship

404
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,632
with organized religion,

405
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:18,635
and I think I projected that
onto you.

406
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,115
Hmm.

407
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,291
Well, you're in good company.

408
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:26,469
A lot of people have problems
with organized religion.

409
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:29,255
No, I don't have a problem
with organized religion.

410
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:32,562
It has a problem with me.

411
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,434
Catholic?

412
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,044
Baptist.

413
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:39,656
Hmm.

414
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,964
I went every Sunday.

415
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:46,663
I started singing in the choir
in eighth grade.

416
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:56,064
Those were tough years for me.

417
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:59,328
I carried around a lot of shame.

418
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,250
I wasn't sure who I was,

419
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:11,297
and when I started getting
surer, I wasn't sure I liked it.

420
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:16,650
I can't count the number of
nights that I'd go to sleep

421
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:20,131
praying to God
that he would fix me.

422
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:25,485
It was pretty clear that...

423
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:28,357
I was no longer welcome.

424
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:35,495
And I got to admit...
[scoffs]

425
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:38,062
I miss it.

426
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:45,200
But now I guess you could say

427
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,117
that my relationship with God
is my own.

428
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,512
Hmm.

429
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,689
Well, good for you.

430
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:57,560
I'm glad you didn't
give up on God

431
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:01,390
because your church
gave up on you.

432
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:08,441
Now, ask me another question.

433
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:09,920
DANNY:
I'm telling you,

434
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:12,358
anyone could have taken
that van key, authorized or not.

435
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,794
TAYLOR:
Well here's a crazy idea.

436
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:16,187
What if we forget about the who.

437
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:18,233
Maybe just concentrate
on the where.

438
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,930
I'm not following.

439
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,629
Well, I was thinking,
if I could just figure out

440
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:25,022
where the van had been
and where the van was heading,

441
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,807
it might help us
identify the driver.

442
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,200
You can do that?Already did.

443
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:30,680
The van has an onboard
navigation system,

444
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:32,073
which I was able
to access remotely.

445
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:35,642
The cool thing is,
any time the vehicle is on,

446
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,861
the system notes
and records its location

447
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:41,038
whether you're asking it
for directions or not.

448
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,214
We know the location
of the hit-and-run.

449
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:45,086
So what I've been doing
is looking for other trips

450
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:47,697
that used that road,
passed by that location.

451
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,438
And...?

452
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:52,093
And I found two others.

453
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:54,356
Both stopped
at the same address.

454
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,185
Do they correlate with any
other entries in the log pages?

455
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:59,448
TAYLOR:
They do not.

456
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,320
If you give me that address,
I'll go over and check it out,
see what I can find out.

457
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,669
Just e-mailed it to you.

458
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,323
[phone chimes]

459
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:08,109
So Officer Avery didn't actually
administer a breathalyzer test?

460
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,371
No. He didn't.

461
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:12,200
Or conduct any kind
of field sobriety testing?

462
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:15,943
No. Uh, but I-I still think
Officer Avery

463
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,728
did the right thing,
driving me home.

464
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,731
I'd had a few glasses of wine.

465
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:26,736
And, uh, I-I really
shouldn't have driven.

466
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,349
It was a mistake, and one
that I don't take lightly.

467
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,961
I don't make a habit
of drinking and driving.

468
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:38,226
Although, I-I do understand
how it must look.

469
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:40,620
And yet, you did drink and drive

470
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,752
on the night
of Ms. Newhouse's death.

471
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,059
Yes, I did.

472
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:47,409
And I plead guilty to that.

473
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:51,413
Father, can you please
explain to the court

474
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:54,329
how you ended up behind
the wheel of the van that night?

475
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,160
I was in my office.

476
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:00,814
Uh, typically,

477
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:03,599
Thursdays are
the only night that, uh,

478
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:06,950
I have any time to myself.

479
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:08,691
I have a Scotch.

480
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:10,911
I started to read.

481
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:13,653
A window was open

482
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:17,308
and I heard the parish van
drive up behind the rectory.

483
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:20,747
I didn't remember there being
anything scheduled.

484
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,793
To be honest, I didn't even know
that someone had taken it.

485
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:26,230
So I walked down
to see who it was.

486
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:29,756
And what did you find?

487
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,802
The driver-- this person--

488
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,456
was very upset.

489
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,024
Panicked.

490
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,287
And they confessed to me

491
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,159
that they had struck a woman
with the van.

492
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,901
And what did you do?

493
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:48,470
I gave absolution.

494
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:53,083
And then I pleaded
with the driver to call 911.

495
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,781
And did they?

496
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:58,915
The person-- the-the driver--

497
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,830
they were pretty distraught.

498
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,615
They were quite hysterical.

499
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:05,661
And I realized that this person

500
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,924
was not capable
of making that call.

501
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,665
So did you make it?

502
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:12,320
Did you call 911

503
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:13,582
when the driver refused to?

504
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:15,279
No.

505
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:18,805
No. The Confessional Seal
can't be broken.

506
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:20,502
So I couldn't.

507
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:22,504
And all I kept thinking about

508
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:25,072
was this woman
that I had just heard about.

509
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:28,510
And I-I had a...
only a vague description

510
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:30,512
of where all of this happened.

511
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:32,862
[sighs]

512
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,429
And the only thing
I could think to do

513
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,693
was to get in the van
and go look for her myself.

514
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:41,131
Father Andy...

515
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:42,959
were you driving the van

516
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,961
when it struck and killed
Morgan Newhouse?

517
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:50,401
When you called me up here,

518
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:54,318
you had me place my hand
on the Holy Bible.

519
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:57,583
And I swore
that I would tell the truth.

520
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,149
So here it is.

521
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:05,808
I was not in that van when
it struck poor Ms. Newhouse.

522
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:09,595
And I certainly was not driving
that van when it struck her.

523
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:14,077
I did get in it
and go look for her.

524
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:17,124
And I had a drink
shortly before.

525
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,300
[Andy sighs]

526
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:24,523
I know how much it must ache

527
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,003
not to know
what happened.

528
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,309
I know
how it pains me

529
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,920
not to be able to tell you.

530
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:33,532
But God has a plan.

531
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,752
I believe that
with all my heart.

532
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:39,189
Thank you, Father.

533
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,365
No further questions,
Your Honor.

534
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,631
[quietly]:
Drumroll, please...

535
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,589
They like him.

536
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,504
They sense
he's telling the truth.

537
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,724
We've won back three jurors.

538
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:52,855
Hmm.

539
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:57,338
Father Andy...

540
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:59,209
let me make sure
I understood you.

541
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,255
On the night in question,

542
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,083
you went down to the van.

543
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,433
This alleged driver did not
seek you out. Is that correct?

544
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,956
Yes, that's correct.

545
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,349
MADDEN:
Okay, then.

546
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:10,481
Now that we've
cleared that up,

547
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,266
I have
just one question for you.

548
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:15,443
If you weren't driving the van
that killed Morgan Newhouse...

549
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:16,836
who was?Objection!

550
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:19,621
Your Honor,
as we've previously established,

551
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,275
this information is protected

552
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,712
by the cleric-penitent
privilege.

553
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:25,540
I disagree, Your Honor.

554
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,065
Would the attorneys please
approach the bench?

555
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:34,810
Your Honor, based on
Father Andrew's testimony

556
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:38,248
just moments ago, the privilege
doesn't apply in this case.

557
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,641
To meet the legal threshold,

558
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,687
the penitent must be
intentionally seeking

559
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,558
spiritual guidance
and absolution.

560
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,994
Your client just admitted

561
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:46,605
that it was he
who sought out the driver,

562
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,606
not the other way around.

563
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,216
Well, that's ridiculous.

564
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:51,784
It's obvious what the intent
of the law is, Your Honor.

565
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:56,310
Mr. Colón,
I understand your argument,

566
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:58,225
but since the language
of the statute

567
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:00,575
doesn't support your position,

568
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,491
I'm going to have to side
with Mr. Madden.

569
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,754
I'm sorry, but no privilege
will be granted

570
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:07,451
with regard to
your client's testimony.

571
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,588
[quietly]:
I sense some turbulence coming.

572
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:20,900
The witness is instructed
to answer the question.

573
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:23,729
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

574
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:25,165
I cannot answer.

575
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,862
Father Andy,

576
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,385
the court ruled

577
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:30,866
that the clergy-penitent
privilege doesn't apply.

578
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,042
For the second time,

579
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:35,654
you are instructed
to answer the question.

580
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:40,006
Again-- I apologize
to the court--

581
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,399
but the Confessional Seal
forbids it.

582
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,924
My vow to the Church forbids it.

583
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:47,013
My oath to God forbids it.

584
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,579
This is your last chance.

585
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:50,886
If you don't
answer the question,

586
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,106
I will be forced to hold you
in contempt of court.

587
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,588
I'm sorry.

588
00:27:57,632 --> 00:28:00,591
I answer to God and the Vatican.

589
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:03,812
Unfortunately for you,
this is not a court of God.

590
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,118
This is a court of law.

591
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:06,902
I'm holding you
in contempt of court.

592
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,948
[gavel bangs]

593
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,993
And because you won't allow
yourself to be cross-examined,

594
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,691
your previous
testimony

595
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,170
is stricken from the record.

596
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,085
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

597
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:18,044
I instruct you to disregard
the testimony of the defendant

598
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,262
in its entirety.

599
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:22,048
You will not consider
anything he said

600
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:23,963
in your deliberations.

601
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:25,181
Take this man into custody.

602
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:41,807
I sought out this firm's help

603
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,461
for one reason
and one reason only.

604
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:46,942
The Church is committed
to protecting

605
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:50,163
the sanctity
of confession.

606
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:54,994
We cannot and we will not
allow a secular court

607
00:28:55,037 --> 00:29:00,216
to render 20 centuries of
Catholic sacrament irrelevant.

608
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,002
[sighs]
Monsignor...

609
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,744
But as this trial has commenced,

610
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:08,007
it has degenerated

611
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,836
from a reasoned conversation

612
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:14,056
about a treasured
Catholic sacrament

613
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,189
into something else entirely.

614
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,800
Into a spectacle.

615
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,455
The news is filled

616
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,805
with revelations
of drunk driving.

617
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,415
A Catholic priest

618
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:29,115
paraded before the press
in handcuffs.

619
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:33,075
A growing
public belief

620
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,949
that the Church
is harboring a priest

621
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:40,822
who is wielding confession
as a shield

622
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:45,871
behind which to hide
his own criminal behavior.

623
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:47,873
Well, w-we know how it looks,
but...

624
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,875
the trial isn't over yet.

625
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:51,659
It is.

626
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:53,226
For us.

627
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,796
I am sorry,
gentlemen.

628
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,363
I know how hard you've worked.

629
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,757
You're firing us.
No.

630
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,847
I am directing you
to negotiate a plea.

631
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:07,283
The quicker the better.

632
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:09,111
The sooner this case

633
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:11,418
is no longer a part of
the public conversation,

634
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:13,115
the better it will be
for everyone.

635
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,117
Except possibly Father Andy.

636
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:16,640
The man's innocent.

637
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:17,554
Really?

638
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:18,860
You still believe that,

639
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:20,862
after everything we heard
in that courtroom?

640
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,038
And you wonder why you don't
see me in church on Sundays.

641
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:24,474
It's guys like this.

642
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,041
They're with you
through thin and thin.

643
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:28,739
Don't you dare judge me.

644
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:33,353
I have

645
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:37,444
296 parishes

646
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:39,925
to worry about.

647
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:42,536
Hey, Benny.
Help your friend out.

648
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,407
I think he's looking
for the high side of the boat.

649
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,366
It's out that door,
down the elevator

650
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,020
and right out onto the street.

651
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:49,760
And just to be clear...

652
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,632
whether you pay our bill or not,

653
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:54,026
Benny and I are going to be
representing Father Andy

654
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:56,115
in court,
defending his innocence.

655
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:59,858
Because-- and this might be
a novel concept,

656
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,991
but when we make a promise,

657
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:05,951
when we make a pledge...

658
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:07,387
we keep it.

659
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:20,617
Oh, relax.

660
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:22,010
You're going to be fine.

661
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,403
It's me.

662
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:24,317
I'm going to hell.

663
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,016
But then again, I always was.

664
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,887
[doorbell rings]

665
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,630
Yes?
DANNY: Hi. Sorry
to bother you.

666
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:35,284
My name's Danny James.

667
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:38,070
I'm an investigator
working on behalf of Father Andy

668
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:40,115
from St. Bernadine Church.

669
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,161
I'm trying to track down some
information on a hit-and-run

670
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:44,076
that occurred a few weeks back
on River Road.

671
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,339
Oh, of course.
I read about that, yeah.

672
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:48,254
Have you seen this vehicle?

673
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:49,951
We have reason to
believe it was actually

674
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,300
parked in front of your house

675
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,823
a little over
a month ago.

676
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:53,824
Yeah.

677
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,348
Uh, Jacob drove it here.

678
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:56,784
I think that's his church's.

679
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,003
They let him drive it sometimes.

680
00:31:58,046 --> 00:31:59,482
Jacob?

681
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:00,396
Jacob Larson.

682
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,529
Oh, um...

683
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:06,881
We met at church camp
last summer.

684
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,623
He doesn't go to my school
or anything,

685
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,451
but we started
hanging out after that.

686
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:13,279
Do you still see him?

687
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,889
No.

688
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,586
Not for a few weeks, actually.

689
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:20,068
It wasn't serious or anything.

690
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:23,942
Or... maybe I thought it was
more serious than he did.

691
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,379
So, wait. You don't
see him anymore?

692
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:28,990
He got into Harvard.

693
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,992
And I guess
it kinda changed him.

694
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:32,994
How so?

695
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:35,866
Well, the day he got the letter,
he called me.

696
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,566
He was super excited,
because he got in. He got in!

697
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:44,310
And, um, he wanted to come over
that night and celebrate.

698
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:47,617
And then he just didn't show up.

699
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,010
And you haven't
talked to him since?

700
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:51,012
I... called him.

701
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:52,144
I texted him.

702
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:55,190
I even DM'd him on Instagram.

703
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,149
And... nothing.

704
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:00,804
Whatever.

705
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:01,892
I'm over it.

706
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:03,111
DANNY:
...and as it happens,

707
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,895
the quickest route
from St. Bernadine's

708
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:07,333
to Jessica's house
is River Road.

709
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:10,336
So Jacob would have driven right
by the scene of the accident.

710
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:15,689
Taylor, when did those Harvard
early admission notices go out?

711
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:19,432
E-mail notifications went
out Thursday the 29th.

712
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:20,389
Same day
as the hit-and-run.

713
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:21,695
BULL:
So...

714
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:24,828
Jacob gets into Harvard.
He's thrilled.

715
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:27,222
He's on his way over
to see his girl,

716
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,963
he hits Morgan.
He panics.

717
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,486
Turns around,
heads back to the church,

718
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,185
and afterwards,
he is scared and guilt-ridden,

719
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:35,709
and cuts off all contact
with Jessica.

720
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:37,624
So... we cracked the case,
right?

721
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,237
Still waiting for
our "attagirls." [chuckles]

722
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,326
Well, I wouldn't say
you cracked it.

723
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,067
More like dinged
it a little.

724
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:49,070
It's great, but not enough
to save Father Andy.

725
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,681
But we know who did it.BENNY: No.

726
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,205
No, actually, we don't.

727
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:55,250
It's just a theory.

728
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:57,513
We can't actually prove anything

729
00:33:57,557 --> 00:34:01,822
other than this Jacob
got into Harvard.

730
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:04,694
What else do we know
about this Jacob?

731
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:06,870
Lives with his mom,
straight-A student.

732
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:08,437
Spends a lot of time
at church

733
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,352
and volunteering,
and has never been in trouble.

734
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:12,093
So he's a good kid.

735
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,226
Not a cold-blooded killer.

736
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:16,793
Just someone who
made a horrible mistake.

737
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:20,406
Got to be... scared.

738
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,190
Riddled with guilt.

739
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:23,452
Dying to talk.

740
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,280
So what are you thinking?

741
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:28,066
I'm thinking this kid confessed
once before;

742
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,416
maybe we can get him
to do it again.

743
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:44,169
Can I help you?

744
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:46,562
Funny, I was about to
ask you the same thing.

745
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,651
Uh, I think you might be
in the wrong place.

746
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:50,175
I'm setting up
for a youth group.

747
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:51,785
There's a bulletin board outside
in the hall

748
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:53,134
that lists everything else
that's going on.

749
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:55,397
Nope. I'm in the right place.

750
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,443
You're Jacob, right?

751
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:00,924
My name's Dr. Jason Bull.

752
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:02,578
I'm part of Father Andy's
legal team.

753
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:04,624
[exhales]

754
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,929
I don't know if you've heard,

755
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:07,235
but things aren't going
very well.

756
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,324
How do you mean?

757
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:11,631
He's a priest.

758
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:14,808
Everyone knows he would never...Everybody knows what
they're told. Hmm?

759
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:17,898
Father Andy was driving the van.

760
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:21,293
He'd had a drink,
and a woman died.

761
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:25,732
The only real question is:
will he go to prison

762
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:28,430
for 15 years or
will it be 20?

763
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:32,782
Will he die in prison or will he
live long enough to get out

764
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:35,568
and have a few years of freedom?

765
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:40,921
My guess is
it was a horrible accident.

766
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:43,097
What's your guess?

767
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:50,235
It was an e-mail from Harvard's
Office of Admissions.

768
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:53,020
It said that I got in.

769
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:55,457
BENNY:
Harvard.

770
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,372
That's quite an accomplishment.

771
00:35:57,416 --> 00:36:00,723
You must have been very excited,
very proud.

772
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:03,422
I was.

773
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:06,207
And I was really grateful.
[sniffles]

774
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:08,905
I had got a lot of help.

775
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:11,691
Encouragement from... my mom.

776
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:14,172
People at the church.

777
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:18,480
I'm the first person
in my family to go to college.

778
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:21,701
Or, uh, would have been.

779
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:24,660
I'm guessing
you wanted to celebrate.

780
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,881
I was dating this girl, Jessica.

781
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:33,930
I thought maybe
we could do something.

782
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:37,804
Nothing big, you know.
Just... hang out.

783
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:42,504
I didn't have any money
for an Uber or a taxi,

784
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,550
or anything.

785
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:47,205
And I-- St. Bernadine's
is just down the street.

786
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,032
And I knew the van
would be there.

787
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:52,645
And that wasn't the first time
you borrowed the van, was it?

788
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:55,169
JACOB:
No, I had...

789
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,041
taken it twice before
to see Jessica.

790
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:01,044
And what happened
after you borrowed the van?

791
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,356
I was driving...

792
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,793
and I got a text.

793
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:14,319
It wasn't even... really for me.

794
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:17,235
It was just an ad
for some stupid game.

795
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:21,848
And there was a thud.

796
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:25,417
At first I thought
it was a deer.

797
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:31,031
But then I looked up.

798
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,774
BENNY:
And what did you do?

799
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:41,998
I didn't do anything.

800
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:44,218
I knew I should,
I should get out.

801
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,438
Help her, but...

802
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,570
I didn't.

803
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,920
So you just sat there.

804
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:53,314
[sniffles]
I turned around...

805
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,839
[sniffles] and I started driving
back to the church.

806
00:37:56,883 --> 00:38:01,061
I just... [sniffles]

807
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:04,630
I wanted to get out of that van.

808
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:07,894
I wanted to make it
not have happened.

809
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:11,724
I'd just gotten the best
news of my life.

810
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,856
BENNY: So you got back
to the church...

811
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,730
And I'm standing
in the parking lot.

812
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,993
I'm looking at the dent.

813
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:23,213
The blood.

814
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:24,737
[sniffles]

815
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,174
And there's Father Andy.

816
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:31,483
It was like
God had already told him.

817
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:37,924
He said God would
forgive me for anything,

818
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:41,057
but I needed to confess.

819
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,625
So I did.

820
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:47,325
And then, he tried to get me
to call the police.

821
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:52,155
But all I could think of
was my mom and my friends

822
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,333
and my future.

823
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:59,772
I'm... so, so sorry.

824
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:03,558
I-I never meant to hurt
your sister, your daughter.

825
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:06,735
Anyone. Not my mom.

826
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:09,434
Not Father Andy.

827
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:13,046
BENNY: No further questions,
Your Honor.

828
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:15,440
Mr. Madden, any questions?

829
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:21,881
Your Honor, in light of
this testimony,

830
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:25,624
we'd like to dismiss the charges
against Father Andrew Tincher.

831
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,800
And we'd also like to
seek an arrest warrant

832
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:30,977
for Jacob Larson in the felony
hit-and-run of Morgan Newhouse.

833
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,501
JUDGE:
So ordered.

834
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:35,329
[gavel bangs]

835
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:51,301
Just so you know, we're
gonna do everything we can

836
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:54,043
to get Jacob the
best deal possible.

837
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,134
You'd think
after all these years,

838
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:02,400
I'd have a better grasp
on how God works.

839
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:05,664
Still a mystery.

840
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:07,753
I was watching Jacob
on the stand,

841
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:12,148
and I...
I just kept wondering

842
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:15,325
maybe I'm just supposed to
plead guilty.

843
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:19,460
You don't really
believe that.

844
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:22,463
But you were willing to
do it, weren't you?

845
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:25,031
Give up one or two
decades of your life.

846
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:27,860
Walk all alone into a prison
for someone else.

847
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:31,429
I... I wouldn't have been alone.

848
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,391
I envy you.

849
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,611
You envy me?

850
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:43,179
Had myself a little heart
attack about six months ago

851
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:44,398
on the courthouse steps.

852
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,617
Not this courthouse...

853
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,793
I never would have known.

854
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,490
[sighs]

855
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:53,146
Funny thing is,
I was lying there,

856
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:56,236
ridiculous pain,
middle of the day,

857
00:40:56,279 --> 00:41:00,588
people... walking by.

858
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:03,983
Mm-hmm.

859
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:07,247
And I looked up and I
didn't see any angels,

860
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,944
I didn't see...

861
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:13,906
some glorious white light.

862
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:16,865
I just saw a
patch of blue sky.

863
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:24,177
I was dying in the
middle of New York City...

864
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,658
and I was all alone.

865
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,225
Ah.

866
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:32,620
Yeah, I envy you.

867
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:35,884
You're never
alone, are you?

868
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:39,148
No, I'm not.

869
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:44,153
You know, Dr. Bull,

870
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:47,156
you could have that, too.

871
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,246
There's always a place
at the church for you.

872
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,989
You know, I'd be pleased to
help you find the way.

873
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:57,906
Well, that's a very
tempting offer, Father.

874
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,954
The thing is, as
I'm sure you know,

875
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:03,912
God moves people
in mysterious ways.

876
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:05,305
Uh-huh.

877
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:07,960
The way he moves me,
I just cannot

878
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:10,571
drag my butt out of bed
on a Sunday morning.

879
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:12,355
But like you said...

880
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:16,229
who are we to question
how God works?

881
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:19,667
You know you're going
to hell, right?

882
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:22,844
Yup. Already
booked my suite.

883
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:23,932
