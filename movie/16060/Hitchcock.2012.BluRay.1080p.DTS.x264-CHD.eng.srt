1
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,322
- It's lucky it didn't reach the house.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:58,333
You know,

3
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,186
there's gonna be a lot more jobs at
that factory in Milwaukee come June.

4
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:07,867
- I could put in a word.
- You can't leave us, Henry.

5
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,922
She needs us both.

6
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,818
Can you stop being a momma's boy
for one second?

7
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:16,768
I'm not trying to hurt you, but Jesus,

8
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,010
you got to live your own life sometime.

9
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:21,614
That woman can take care
of her own goddamn...

10
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:36,907
Oh, good evening.

11
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,018
Brother has been killing brother
since Cain and Abel,

12
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:42,417
yet even I didn't see that coming.

13
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,022
I was as blind-sided as poor
old Henry down there.

14
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:50,638
Apparently the authorities
shared my naivet?

15
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:54,021
In other words,
they believed the young man's story

16
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:57,085
that Henry fell,
hit his head on a stone,

17
00:01:57,106 --> 00:02:00,438
and died of smoke asphyxiation.

18
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:04,994
On the other hand,
if they hadn't believed him,

19
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:09,473
Ed Gein would never have had
the opportunity to commit those

20
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:14,371
heinous crimes
for which he became most famous.

21
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:20,033
And we, of course, well... We wouldn't
have our little movie, would we?

22
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,797
Sync, corrected by icephoenix

23
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,343
Here he comes!

24
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:46,575
This thing's going to be gigantic.

25
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:49,264
I wish I had 20% of the take.

26
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:52,244
Does tonight's incredible reaction
surprise you, Mr. Hitchcock?

27
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:55,148
No, when I was planning
North by Northwest

28
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:58,950
I could already hear the
screams and the laughter.

29
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:03,198
Any questions, my dear?
Pity.

30
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,914
Mr. Hitchcock,
you've directed 46 motion pictures.

31
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,321
You're the most famous director
in the history of the medium...

32
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,810
But you're sixty years old.

33
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,023
Shouldn't you just quit
while you're ahead?

34
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:34,748
Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms
gouged out with arrows.

35
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:37,791
That must have been rather painful.

36
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,858
Talking of arrows,

37
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:44,963
did you read that little snippet from A.H.
Weiler's review in The New York Times?

38
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:48,822
He said he found the climax
to be "overdrawn."

39
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:52,535
Yes, well I doubt Mr. Weiler has
had a climax in years.

40
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:56,820
"North by Northwest
reminds us of Mr. Hitchcock's

41
00:03:56,843 --> 00:04:00,474
earlier, more inventive spy thrillers."

42
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:03,010
And there is an accompanying list.

43
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:07,166
The "New Masters of Suspense."

44
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,851
Why do they keep looking for new ones
when they still have the original?

45
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:13,666
Oh, don't be maudlin,
you know how much it aggravates me.

46
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,559
Just stop reading them.

47
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:17,440
You've been reading them for a week.

48
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,045
Tell me, my dear,

49
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,466
do you think I'm too old?

50
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:27,252
Yes, you're a true relic.

51
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:30,425
And lest we forget,
a notably corpulent one.

52
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:35,843
You always know precisely
where to plunge the dagger, don't you?

53
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,948
Right between the shoulder blades.
I learned it from your pictures.

54
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:41,755
Where, may I ask, are you off to?

55
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:43,704
I'm going to have brunch with Whit

56
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:46,353
after I drop you off at the studio.
Would you care to join us?

57
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:49,162
We've just established that
I'm far too corpulent

58
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,275
to be seen in broad daylight.

59
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:54,064
Oh, you'll feel better when
you find a new project.

60
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,730
Hasn't Peggy unearthed any
decent books for you recently?

61
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:59,788
Yes, sleeping pills with dust jackets.

62
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:03,911
So what do you think?

63
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:07,198
Very presentable.

64
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:12,781
Hurry up, dear, you're pruning.

65
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,082
- Good Morning.
- Ms. Hitchcock.

66
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:27,796
Mr. Hitchcock.

67
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,424
Sirs.

68
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:41,117
There's a project out there waiting
for you, Hitch. I promise you.

69
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,474
- I hope so. Thank you, love.
- Have a good day.

70
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:52,290
I'm treading water, Peggy. I need
something fresh, something different.

71
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:55,403
Without expensive stars to pretty it up.

72
00:05:55,427 --> 00:05:59,544
Fox is offering you The Diary of
Anne Frank for the third time.

73
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,458
The audience would spend the entire
picture waiting for Miss Frank

74
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:05,280
to discover the corpse
I'd hidden in the attic.

75
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,614
- Wouldn't you agree, Nuncio?
- Si.

76
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:10,945
MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book,
Casino Royale.

77
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,540
Cary Grant.
Definitely your style.

78
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:17,431
Doesn't she know I just made that movie?
It's called North by Northwest.

79
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,279
"Style," my dear, is mere self-plagiarism.

80
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:22,826
Oh, scusi!

81
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,736
A nice, clean, nasty little piece of work.
That's what I'm looking for.

82
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,118
I shall see what I can find.

83
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,816
- Serves you right.
- Yeah.

84
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:37,665
You know, Hitch always says that
your private life

85
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,623
is in danger of being more entertaining
than any of your plots.

86
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:44,034
I'm surprised he let me have you
for the whole afternoon.

87
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:46,287
Especially looking so beautiful.

88
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:49,880
So tell me,
what are you working on these days?

89
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:52,289
Me? Oh, oh...

90
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:54,685
I'm satisfied working in my garden.

91
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,800
Oh!
Well that's one lucky garden.

92
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:04,140
All this relentless sycophancy is
actually giving me indigestion.

93
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:06,806
What are you after?

94
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:13,627
I was hoping you may be able to apply
your considerable pruning skills to this.

95
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,918
Ah, all is finally revealed.

96
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:22,181
Whit, you are a little predictable.

97
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:27,042
The most fun I ever had
was working with you.

98
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:46,879
Anything come up, my dear?
Anything at all?

99
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:48,828
Nothing suitable.

100
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:51,111
Is that water
or do I need to call Alma?

101
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,967
Do whatever you want.

102
00:07:55,671 --> 00:08:00,532
Anthony Boucher says that
this book Psycho by Robert Bloch is

103
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:03,281
"fiendishly entertaining."

104
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:05,715
It sounds ghastly.
Everyone in town's already passed.

105
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,699
And who is everyone, pray?

106
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:11,468
The story department finished the
coverage this morning.

107
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,839
This about Ed Gein,
the mass murderer from Wisconsin?

108
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,591
Oh, yeah.

109
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:24,849
"Graphic elements of brutal violence,
voyeurism, transvestitism and incest."

110
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:30,146
Very nice. Not your average
run-of-the-mill nutcase, is he?

111
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,334
You're kidding.

112
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:35,805
Peggy, this is the boy
who dug up his own mother.

113
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,862
- Hungry?
- Famished.

114
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:54,019
You can have half a grapefruit later
if you're good.

115
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,956
Listen, Hitch.

116
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,223
Whit gave me the galleys to his new book
yesterday at lunch.

117
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,123
I've already got some ideas
about how we can adapt it.

118
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:05,329
It's elegant. It's sophisticated.
It's full of intrigue.

119
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:08,454
You mean the book or Mr. Whitfield Cook?

120
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:12,771
This could be the one, Hitch.

121
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:16,535
I'll read it later.

122
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:21,323
There are calories in that, you know.

123
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,887
Ma?

124
00:09:40,215 --> 00:09:41,401
Ma...

125
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,869
Aren't you cold?

126
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:14,243
No need to be afraid, Ma.

127
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:26,123
Oh, God!

128
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:30,912
I just want you to read
this little bit here.

129
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:34,951
It takes place in the motel bathroom.

130
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:37,206
"Mary started to scream,

131
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:39,562
"and then the curtains parted further

132
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:43,147
"and a hand appeared,
holding a butcher's knife.

133
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:45,824
"It was the knife that, a moment later,

134
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:49,222
cut off her scream,
and her head."

135
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,213
Charming.
Doris Day should do it as a musical.

136
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:59,142
That is nothing but low-budget
horror movie claptrap.

137
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:06,276
But what if someone really good
made a horror picture?

138
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,672
Just think of the shock value.

139
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:15,121
Killing off your leading lady
halfway through.

140
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:20,288
I mean, you are intrigued,
are you not, my dear?

141
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,751
Come on, admit it.

142
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,064
Admit it.

143
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,847
Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.

144
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:36,146
You shouldn't wait till halfway through.
Kill her off after thirty minutes.

145
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:40,882
Well!

146
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:45,360
Peggy,
I want you to summon your minions.

147
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:48,131
- Minions?
- Right away.

148
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:51,343
Certainly.
And who might they be?

149
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:55,100
Get them started buying copies of Psycho.

150
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:58,618
- How many do you need?
- All of them. Every copy, nationwide.

151
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:01,906
Scour every bookshop, every library.
And I mean everywhere.

152
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,879
Psycho is going to be my next movie,

153
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:07,417
and I don't want anyone to know the ending
until they see it in the theater.

154
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:12,210
Look at that.

155
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:19,976
Are you sure about this?
This is so unlike you.

156
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,048
That is exactly the point, my dear.

157
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:30,119
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

158
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,350
good afternoon.

159
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,041
I see you've all been devouring
the article on Mr. Ed Gein.

160
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,670
Violent chap,

161
00:12:42,694 --> 00:12:47,457
and the real-life inspiration
behind Psycho.

162
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:52,686
All of us harbor
dark recesses of violence,

163
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:55,633
and horror.

164
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:58,573
Fascinating, isn't it?

165
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:04,045
When the Wisconsin Police Department
raided Mr. Gein's farm,

166
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:08,464
they opened the door...
And voila!

167
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:14,137
They discovered ten female heads
with the tops sawn off.

168
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,987
Pass these around, would you?
And have a look.

169
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,476
Masks of human skin.

170
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,284
A pair of lips on a drawstring
for a window shade.

171
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:26,037
Oh, yes, and a jug
containing human noses.

172
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,606
Is this really going to be your
next picture, Mr. Hitchcock?

173
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,138
Well, that is my intention, yes, madam.

174
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:35,003
My only wish is that Ed
Gein looked a little

175
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:37,844
more like William Holden
instead of Elmer Fudd.

176
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:45,074
By the way, try the finger sandwiches.
They're real fingers.

177
00:13:46,313 --> 00:13:49,522
Bloody hell!

178
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,647
Now don't pretend you're
not upset he hasn't read it.

179
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,744
I'm not.
I'm a big boy, I can take it.

180
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,529
Well, I loved it.

181
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:58,657
It must be great fun to research.

182
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:01,339
Do you really think he will read it?

183
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:04,075
Ah, speak of the devil.

184
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:08,161
Hitch, I ran all over town
trying to find a copy of Psycho

185
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:10,415
but I simply cannot find one.

186
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:15,029
- I wonder how that could have happened.
- Yeah.

187
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,818
Don't stop looking on my behalf.

188
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,354
Hitch, you should come.

189
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:30,033
I've seen happier faces on a school bus
going over a cliff.

190
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:36,453
But they can't stop looking, can they?

191
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,047
Audiences want to be shocked, Barney.

192
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:47,642
They want something different.

193
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,286
And this is it.

194
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,726
Every time you want to do
something different

195
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:57,185
like The Wrong Man or Vertigo,
someone loses money.

196
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,498
So we should stop trying to
give them something new?

197
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:03,718
You owe Paramount one last picture,
Hitch.

198
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:06,771
Can't you do something like
North by Northwest

199
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:10,163
but for us this time
instead of for MGM?

200
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:14,956
Psycho.

201
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:21,673
No one respects
the name Hitchcock like Paramount.

202
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:27,894
Are you telling me "no," Barney?

203
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:30,923
I think you know me better than that,
Hitch.

204
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:34,879
What a putz.

205
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:38,251
You know what his family did
before they built those movie palaces?

206
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:40,440
Ran a grocery store.

207
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:44,491
My father ran a grocery store.

208
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:48,252
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.
He should show some respect.

209
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:53,731
They think I've lost my touch, Lew.

210
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:57,923
My association with television has
cheapened me.

211
00:15:57,946 --> 00:16:00,071
Are you referring to that deal I got you

212
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:03,873
where Bristol-Meyers pays you 29 grand
an episode and you own the negative?

213
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,296
That's my kind of cheap.

214
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:10,151
They just want the same thing
over and over and over.

215
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:13,880
They've put me in a coffin and
now they're nailing down the lid.

216
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:18,065
Hitch, as your agent,
I will never let that happen.

217
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:25,989
How much you think you can
make this picture for?

218
00:16:26,012 --> 00:16:28,770
$800,000, give or take.

219
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:39,920
You're home early.

220
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,192
Oh, it's lovely actually.

221
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:01,330
You know, I'm disappointed
you didn't give Whit's book a chance.

222
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,498
And what about Whit?
Is he disappointed?

223
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,846
Oh, no.
He knows you well enough.

224
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:09,814
Look at that!
Time for a new one anyway.

225
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,233
Well you'd better enjoy the pool,
my dear, while you can.

226
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,311
We might not have it much longer.

227
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:20,732
Why?

228
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:23,889
Paramount refuses to finance the movie.

229
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:27,487
Oh, Hitch, I'm so sorry.

230
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:32,024
Lew can't find the money.
At least, not fast enough.

231
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,558
Well why not wait?

232
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,070
No.

233
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:44,811
Just going to have to go it alone,
old girl.

234
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:47,209
Finance it ourselves.

235
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:58,019
Are we going to have to sell
the whole house or just the pool?

236
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:02,571
I just want to do the film.

237
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,223
I will ask you this once
and I'll never mention it again.

238
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:15,857
Why this one, Hitch?

239
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,573
It's not just because so many people
are saying "no," is it?

240
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:27,165
Do you remember the fun we had
when we started out all those years ago?

241
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:31,249
We didn't have any money then, did we?

242
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,753
We didn't have any time, either,
but we took risks, do you remember?

243
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:43,920
We experimented.
We invented new ways of making pictures

244
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:46,430
because we had to.

245
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:55,206
I want to feel
that kind of freedom again.

246
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,414
Like we used to, you know?

247
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:12,694
We are about to propose
a restructured deal for Psycho.

248
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,031
I'm listening.

249
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:19,312
We finance it independently.

250
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:24,518
Hitch waives his directorial fee.
Paramount only distributes it,

251
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:28,203
in exchange for 40% of the profits.

252
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:33,440
Interesting. But what exactly
is Paramount distributing?

253
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:37,790
Is this still a picture about a queer
killing people in his mother's dress?

254
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:41,690
What this picture is about
is the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock.

255
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:45,283
- No one is arguing that.
- Barney,

256
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:48,488
it's very simple.

257
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:51,545
This is Mr. Hitchcock's next film.

258
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:56,142
Are you in or are you out?

259
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:05,312
Fine. We'll take that deal.

260
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:09,895
If you can get the money.

261
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,018
We already have the money, Barney.

262
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:22,991
Who do I make it out to?

263
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:31,357
If this picture fails, Alma,

264
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:36,500
we'll be in for a long,
humiliating bout of crow-eating.

265
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:43,720
- It'll be splendid.
- Are you sure?

266
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:48,871
Of the movie? Not at all.

267
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:53,291
But of you? Unquestionably.

268
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,100
Ahem.

269
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,738
- Joe Stefano. Good to meet you.
- Sit down.

270
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:07,323
I'm sorry I was late.

271
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:09,542
My shrink session went overtime.

272
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:15,701
I see him every day
and it's still not enough.

273
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:19,511
I thought it was only director's
assistants who needed psychiatrists,

274
00:21:19,523 --> 00:21:21,730
not writers.

275
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:28,467
Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock?

276
00:21:28,491 --> 00:21:31,228
I have to confess, Mr. Stefano,

277
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:33,846
It boggles my brain
just trying to imagine

278
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:36,863
what you and your shrink
could possibly talk about every day.

279
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:44,206
The usual: Sex. Rage. My mother.

280
00:21:54,124 --> 00:21:56,466
Good morning, sir.

281
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:00,091
Let me have a look at you.

282
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:04,920
The only thing worse than a visit to
the dentist is a visit to censor.

283
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:07,855
Whatever you do, Hitch,
don't lose your temper.

284
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:11,382
- See you later.
- Good luck.

285
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:17,975
The Code will absolutely not permit you

286
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:21,227
to show a knife
penetrating a woman's flesh.

287
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:23,056
I assure you, Geoffrey,

288
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,317
my murders are always models of taste
and discretion.

289
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:31,954
Is there any improper
suggestion of nudity in this

290
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:34,223
murder scene in the shower?

291
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:38,335
She won't be nude.
She'll be wearing a shower cap.

292
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,659
We might accept a shot
from outside the bathroom window

293
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:49,042
of Marion in silhouette
above the shoulders.

294
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:51,848
Provided that the glass is frosted.

295
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:54,281
Thank you.

296
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:58,647
And the scene with the toilet.

297
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,118
It is completely necessary
to show the toilet,

298
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:04,602
because Marion Crane attempts
to flush evidence down it.

299
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:07,615
Remnants of which are later
discovered by her sister.

300
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:13,641
These remnants, you understand,
are clues to her vanishing.

301
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:18,505
No American movie has ever found it
necessary to show a toilet,

302
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,818
let alone to flush one.

303
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:23,935
Perhaps we ought to
shoot the film in France

304
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,540
and use a bidet instead.

305
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:35,003
Mr. Hitchcock,
if this office denies you a seal,

306
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:37,569
and we're certainly heading
in that direction,

307
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:43,159
your movie will not be released
in a single theater in this country.

308
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:46,086
Will you be making jokes then?

309
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:51,877
Everyone in Hollywood resents me.

310
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:54,255
I make them millions of dollars,

311
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:59,058
and every year I sit at those
dreadful award show dinners,

312
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:03,205
waiting for someone just to say,
"You're good."

313
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:10,835
They take sadistic pleasure in
denying me that one little moment.

314
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:12,981
That must hurt.

315
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,954
Deeply, Ed. Deeply.

316
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:26,521
Sorry, doctor.
I'm just not used to this...

317
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,434
process.

318
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,158
Just think of me more like a friend.

319
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:38,385
It's just that more and more
I've been having these...

320
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:39,571
impulses.

321
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:47,104
What kind of impulses?

322
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:54,749
Strong ones.

323
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,028
Here.

324
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:18,492
The Lazar Office tell me
he's crazy to work with you.

325
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:22,543
Tell Swifty Lazar he should not have
overexposed his client on television.

326
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:25,164
Unlike some we could mention.

327
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:30,867
- Anthony Perkins.
- Oh...

328
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:34,106
Think of the duality
he could bring to the role of Norman.

329
00:25:34,124 --> 00:25:36,697
The rage lurking behind that
little boy grin.

330
00:25:36,722 --> 00:25:40,339
The winsome charm he uses
to keep from being found out.

331
00:25:40,362 --> 00:25:44,859
Why, Alma,
you're not suggesting Mr. Perkins is...?

332
00:25:44,883 --> 00:25:46,562
Hm.

333
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:49,745
What?

334
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,829
I like your office.

335
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:05,680
I can't count how many times
I've seen Strangers on a Train.

336
00:26:05,704 --> 00:26:08,476
And Rope.

337
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:11,256
Well, Norman Bates is
the logical extension

338
00:26:11,257 --> 00:26:14,012
of those two characters in that movie.

339
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:17,873
Appealing, sensitive,
suffering the terrible burden

340
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:21,430
of being forced to pretend to be
something he is not.

341
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:29,362
I'm sick of all this romantic crap
the studios keep shoving me into.

342
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:32,262
But my only worry is,

343
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:35,589
well, playing Norman might
cut too close to home.

344
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,070
How so?

345
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:48,417
When I was younger,
I was incredibly close to my mother.

346
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:52,759
So close that I remember
wishing my father would drop dead.

347
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:58,669
And then when I was five,
he did just that.

348
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,970
He keeled over from a heart attack.

349
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:11,681
You see I've been guilty my whole life,
Mr. Hitchcock.

350
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:19,775
You know,
I'm getting blisters just watching you.

351
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,337
Oh, stop complaining.

352
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,261
A bit of fresh air and exercise
will do you good.

353
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:26,115
I'm going to have a drink.

354
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:27,945
No you're not. You're
going to finish that hedge.

355
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:29,312
You've got to go all the
way around there, all

356
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:30,667
the way around there, all
the way around there.

357
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,996
- It's impossible. I can't do that.
- Yes you can.

358
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,274
You know, I was thinking, if I could
get Grace Kelly to play the girl,

359
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:42,458
they'd let me get away with murder.

360
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:46,433
Well you can't. She's a princess now,
which makes her permanently unattainable.

361
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,758
And all the more desirable.

362
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:52,283
What about Deborah Kerr?
Lew mentioned her.

363
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:54,440
No, she's too Scottish.

364
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:58,527
What about Janet Leigh?

365
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:02,807
I know she's normally the "good girl,"
but she was awfully good in Touch of Evil.

366
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:07,230
You remember how you always used to remark
on her figure at the Wassermans' parties?

367
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,401
Yeah.

368
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,188
- Good evening.
- Hello.

369
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:20,105
- Lovely to see you.
- Charmed.

370
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:22,124
- Hi.
- Hello, Janet. How are you?

371
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:24,062
Wonderful to see you.

372
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:27,918
- Well, my dear, you look very beautiful.
- Thank you.

373
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,996
Very beautiful.

374
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:36,108
Of course the real
secret of Mrs. Simpson's

375
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,300
appeal to the Duke of Windsor

376
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:42,132
was that she could make a toothpick
feel like a cigar.

377
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:46,674
Oh, I've been so immersed
in preparing to play Marion

378
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:49,121
I'd almost forgotten how to laugh.

379
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,512
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

380
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:53,889
Now, now, you must try
the banana shortcake.

381
00:28:53,903 --> 00:28:56,791
Oh, no. Nothing for me, thank you.
I'm watching my figure.

382
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:59,755
Yes, you're not the only one.
We're fine, thank you.

383
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,567
George, bring her the banana shortcake.

384
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:04,984
In fact, make that two large portions.
Thank you.

385
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:09,381
Now tell me, my dear, how else have you
prepared for the part of Marion Crane?

386
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:11,859
Well, I've written an entire history
for her,

387
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:15,457
which seems a little silly, I know,
but it really does help.

388
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,099
- It doesn't sound silly at all.
- No?

389
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:21,648
Why don't you tell us
one of her deepest secrets?

390
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:27,360
Well, she leads a double life.

391
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:30,824
At the Lowery Office,
she wears Tweed perfume.

392
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:33,172
But when she's with Sam,

393
00:29:33,196 --> 00:29:37,775
she recklessly breaks out
her most expensive bottle.

394
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,170
"My Sin" by Lanvin.

395
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:42,874
- "My Sin"?
- Yes.

396
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:44,861
Good Lord!

397
00:29:44,877 --> 00:29:47,643
I do have a concern or two.

398
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:51,892
I'm an actress, of course,
but I'm first a wife and a mother.

399
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,145
And I'm just curious to know...

400
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,894
How are you going to shoot
this shower scene?

401
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:00,642
Yes, you and the Shurlock Office.

402
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:05,843
It's only that, well, from here up,
I'm not exactly boyish.

403
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:09,079
Allow me to set your mind at rest,
my dear.

404
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:12,578
I will be shooting short bits of film
from various angles.

405
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:16,693
Cut together, the montage
will only suggest nudity.

406
00:30:16,716 --> 00:30:18,124
Suggest violence.

407
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:20,533
Nothing will actually be shown.

408
00:30:21,646 --> 00:30:24,545
But of course, having you in the shower

409
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:28,807
would make it all the more,
well, titillating.

410
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:32,351
Will you excuse me?

411
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:50,508
Alma, dear, how lovely to see you.

412
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:52,986
Oh, hello, Lillian.

413
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:54,829
You're looking a little pale.

414
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,194
No wonder with that thing
your husband's working on now.

415
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:00,426
You can't possibly approve.

416
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,623
Why are you letting him do
something so tasteless?

417
00:31:03,647 --> 00:31:07,314
Don't upset yourself, darling.
It's only a bloody movie.

418
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:28,159
I can't believe
you made Vera Miles play the sister.

419
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:31,998
Well, I've still got her under contract.
May as well get something out of her.

420
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:34,786
Rather a thankless role,
don't you think?

421
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,660
For an utterly thankless girl.

422
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:52,229
Horrible.

423
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:54,977
The old man really is unhappy with me,
isn't he?

424
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:57,779
Wait till you see the undergarments
he has picked out for you.

425
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:04,091
Okay. Well, I am just going to
have to keep telling myself,

426
00:32:04,114 --> 00:32:07,854
one more picture
and I'm free as a bird.

427
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,465
So I've made a list of places
where we can tighten our belts.

428
00:32:25,483 --> 00:32:27,256
Huh?

429
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:31,460
We could all learn the art of
self-restraint, couldn't we, Alfred?

430
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:36,970
Gardeners once a week,
weekend off for the driver...

431
00:32:36,994 --> 00:32:40,287
No, that's impossible.
We'll have to find other places to cut.

432
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:42,131
There aren't any other places.

433
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:46,333
And there's be no more shipments
flown in from Maxim's of Paris.

434
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:48,700
We can't afford it.

435
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:51,618
The foie gras at Chasen's
is more than adequate.

436
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:55,653
But those geese are from Barstow,
not from Marseilles.

437
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:58,278
Yes, well we all have
to make our sacrifices

438
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:00,878
for the greater good, don't we, Alfred?

439
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:36,989
I'll go get the knives.

440
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:02,729
Am I making a terrible mistake?

441
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:08,691
What if it's another Vertigo?

442
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:12,234
Just get the first take under your belt.
You'll be fine.

443
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,776
Are you decent, my dear?

444
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,107
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

445
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:30,766
Am I all right?

446
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,807
- Perfect.
- Wow.

447
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:35,439
- Morning.
- Morning.

448
00:34:35,463 --> 00:34:38,313
I want to thank you once again
for this opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.

449
00:34:38,332 --> 00:34:40,412
You may call me "Hitch."
Hold the cock.

450
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:43,699
Well look at you two.
America's favorite boy and girl next door.

451
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:45,917
Yes, and we're about to move
to a whole new neighborhood.

452
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,899
- Morning, Janet. Morning, Tony.
- Morning, Vera.

453
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,482
- Thanks for the wardrobe, Hitch.
- Do you approve?

454
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:53,343
You're the genius.

455
00:34:53,364 --> 00:34:56,194
One thing, though.
My script is missing its last ten pages.

456
00:34:56,217 --> 00:35:00,659
Everyone's script is missing ten pages
until Alma finishes the revisions.

457
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,019
You're just in time for the Oath.

458
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:06,571
- The what?
- The Oath.

459
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:09,765
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

460
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:13,029
Would you all raise your right hands?

461
00:35:13,053 --> 00:35:15,378
That includes you, Vera Miles.

462
00:35:18,138 --> 00:35:21,379
- I do solemnly promise...
- I do solemnly promise...

463
00:35:21,403 --> 00:35:24,955
- That I will not divulge...
- That I will not divulge...

464
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:28,189
The plot nor the many
secrets of Psycho...

465
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,399
The plot nor the many
secrets of Psycho...

466
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:35,309
- To friends, relatives...
- To friends, relatives...

467
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,771
- Trade reporters...
- Trade reporters...

468
00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:42,053
Not even outgoing
President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

469
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,741
Thank you all very much.

470
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:33,673
Here we are, Norman's inner sanctum.

471
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,692
Now, Hitch.

472
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:45,201
Explain to me
why I'm watching Marion undress?

473
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:47,044
I feel like I should
take offense at that.

474
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:50,005
Perhaps Norman
secretly watched his mother

475
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:53,233
preparing for her nightly bath.

476
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:56,168
Yes, maybe there was a transom
over the bathroom door?

477
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,868
Yeah, which he could access
by climbing on a chair,

478
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:03,120
so long as he was stealthy.

479
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:06,748
A boy's first glimpse of a naked woman
is usually his mother.

480
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,067
So I'm reliving the past,

481
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:13,505
repeating a ritual with Marion?

482
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:15,442
Don't ask me.

483
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:20,363
I'm just a man hiding in the corner
with my camera, watching.

484
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:24,575
My camera will tell you the truth.
The absolute truth.

485
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:28,168
Hitch, I have a question.

486
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:31,480
Why is the hole
so much larger on this side?

487
00:38:31,503 --> 00:38:34,187
All the better to see you with,
my dear.

488
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:38,477
At the greatest possible angle.

489
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,757
And cut!

490
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,231
If you ask me, the credits should read

491
00:39:25,254 --> 00:39:29,338
"Screenplay by Joseph Stefano
and Alma Reville."

492
00:39:29,361 --> 00:39:31,840
The people who matter know.

493
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:40,340
Alma, you always know the answer.
Is this really going to work?

494
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,953
See you tomorrow.

495
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,394
Hello, stranger.

496
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:08,434
- Whit!
- Where have you been hiding?

497
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:10,512
Oh, God...!

498
00:40:10,524 --> 00:40:13,424
- I've been finishing the revisions on...
- Psycho.

499
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:16,160
- Mm-hmm.
- And how is the old boy?

500
00:40:16,182 --> 00:40:20,439
He is in a state of unbridled ecstasy
now that he's back on the set.

501
00:40:20,463 --> 00:40:22,517
And you? How are you?

502
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:28,659
Well, two thousand words to do
for Reader's Digest on

503
00:40:28,683 --> 00:40:32,018
what it's like to be married to
a man obsessed by murder.

504
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:38,578
Alma, you deserve a break.

505
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,599
Let's drive up to Santa Barbara.

506
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:45,620
We'll have Emilio fry up those juicy
steaks that we love so much at El Encanto.

507
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,794
Mr. Hitchcock,
we're ready for you on the set.

508
00:40:54,096 --> 00:40:57,836
- Mr. Hitchcock.
- I'll be there in a moment.

509
00:41:21,765 --> 00:41:24,228
Long line at the supermarket?

510
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:29,894
No. Actually,
I'm home earlier than I expected.

511
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:38,243
- Would you like a cocktail?
- No, and you shouldn't have one either.

512
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:49,684
- That hasn't been washed yet.
- I don't care.

513
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:57,102
Oh, I was filming all day today
with John Gavin.

514
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,529
He's a good-looking chap.

515
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:03,017
But really, plywood is more expressive.

516
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,916
I think his love scene with Janet Leigh

517
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,693
may be most horrifying thing
in the movie.

518
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,205
Even your friend Mr. Whitfield Cook

519
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:19,793
would be better in the scene.

520
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:24,528
Why don't you tell him yourself?
I'm sure he'd be very flattered.

521
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,244
You know, my dear,

522
00:42:38,268 --> 00:42:43,681
maybe I was a bit too dismissive
about your friend

523
00:42:43,698 --> 00:42:46,688
Whitfield's book.

524
00:42:47,885 --> 00:42:53,232
Perhaps he and Elizabeth
could come over this weekend

525
00:42:53,255 --> 00:42:55,755
and walk me through it, as they say.

526
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,654
Lovely woman, Elizabeth.

527
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:09,054
I was hoping you could
come to the set tomorrow.

528
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:14,012
Yes. Well,
I'll see how my day shapes up.

529
00:43:15,002 --> 00:43:17,035
Yes.

530
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:26,491
You think you can get away with it,
don't you? But you can't.

531
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:29,229
You think they can't tell,
but they can.

532
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:31,162
They know.

533
00:43:31,186 --> 00:43:35,988
You can feel that noose tightening
around that breakable little neck.

534
00:43:36,006 --> 00:43:37,993
I mean,
you could return the money secretly,

535
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:40,165
but what would that prove?
It's too late.

536
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:42,999
Marion Crane always so tight,
so respectable,

537
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:46,713
so prim and so proper and perfect.
Untouchable unsullied Miss Crane.

538
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:49,107
Daddy's perfect little angel.

539
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:54,080
Now they all know those dirty
little secrets you've been hiding so long.

540
00:43:54,102 --> 00:43:56,151
Messy, sticky little lunchtime trysts

541
00:43:56,175 --> 00:44:00,458
with that oh-so-handsome failure
Mr. Samuel Loomis.

542
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:02,823
They'll smirk, they'll gossip,
and they'll whisper.

543
00:44:02,846 --> 00:44:06,333
Even your boss, straight-laced,
hatchet-faced Mr. George Lowery,

544
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:11,538
why even he can smell the rancid,
pungent scent of sex all over you.

545
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,750
All right. Circle that and print it.

546
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,905
Let's get this thing fixed
once and for all.

547
00:44:16,928 --> 00:44:19,277
I'm sick and tired of it.
Come on.

548
00:44:21,145 --> 00:44:23,199
Why's it making that noise?

549
00:44:23,223 --> 00:44:26,992
- What's it going to take to reset?
- About five.

550
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,308
Come in.

551
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:40,417
Thought you could use a little
pick-me-up.

552
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:42,921
- Oh, you're so sweet. Thank you.
- Not at all.

553
00:44:42,944 --> 00:44:45,707
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

554
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,546
I can't imagine your husband will be
too pleased with what just happened.

555
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:52,017
Well, you know.

556
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,248
Tony and the kids, you'd be surprised
what comes out of their mouths sometimes.

557
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,370
That's true.

558
00:44:58,207 --> 00:45:00,890
You haven't spoken to him
much about your personal life, have you?

559
00:45:01,525 --> 00:45:04,475
Hitch?
No, not really.

560
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:08,107
I'd keep it that way if I were you.

561
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:13,950
Why?

562
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,553
Well, it starts with him
wanting to choose your hairstyle.

563
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:19,539
Then he wants to choose your clothes,

564
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:22,917
and your friends,
and how many children you should have.

565
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:29,084
You know that poor, tortured soul
Jimmy Stewart played in Vertigo?

566
00:45:29,108 --> 00:45:31,503
That's Hitch...

567
00:45:31,526 --> 00:45:34,091
Only younger,
slimmer and better-looking.

568
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:36,275
Oh, I don't know.

569
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:38,577
Compared to Orson Welles,
he's a sweetheart.

570
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,403
See?
He's always watching.

571
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:33,609
- Jack, how long is this going to take?
- Just need five minutes.

572
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:35,673
Let's get a move on it.
We haven't got all day.

573
00:46:35,685 --> 00:46:38,139
Why does it keep
burning out all the time?

574
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:42,070
- Get it fixed. What's the hold-up?
- It's still engaged.

575
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,823
Hitch, I'm stuck on Lila's first scene.

576
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:48,260
I don't know how strongly
I should confront Sam and the detective...

577
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:52,316
Darling, just fake it. Fake it.
You know how to do that. Act.

578
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,618
Where are my revisions?

579
00:46:57,163 --> 00:47:00,666
Come on, does it really require
two men to carry a light stand?

580
00:47:00,689 --> 00:47:01,969
Help them.

581
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:03,249
I'll take care of it
right away, Mr. Hitchcock.

582
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,099
All the difference when the money's
coming out of your own pocket, isn't it?

583
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,992
- We'll have a late lunch.
- Right.

584
00:47:08,016 --> 00:47:11,620
- I'll make the reservation for 1:30.
- Oh, Whit.

585
00:47:11,644 --> 00:47:14,036
What would I do without you?

586
00:47:14,402 --> 00:47:17,733
- Till then, bye-bye.
- Bye.

587
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:28,136
Whit, what did you forget now?

588
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:31,387
Whit?

589
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:37,229
Whit?

590
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:01,510
- Mr. Hitchcock, sir, please...
- No, not now.

591
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,159
Every press outlet is dying for photos.

592
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,761
If we could just get one photo, please!

593
00:48:04,762 --> 00:48:07,647
Get off my set! I'll have security...
Get off my set!

594
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,844
Just go! Get rid of this man.
He's a bloody pest.

595
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:11,800
Get him off the set now!

596
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:14,263
- Are you okay? You've gone very pale.
- I tell you get away.

597
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:16,914
Stop following me around
like a puppy dog and get me a drink.

598
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:20,098
- It's not even 3:00...
- Now give me the key to the cabinets.

599
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:27,357
Hello, Hitch.
How's the picture?

600
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,165
I'm hearing interesting things.

601
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:31,220
It's a miracle anyone can hear anything

602
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:34,340
above the noise coming from
Geoffrey Shurlock's office.

603
00:48:34,364 --> 00:48:37,569
You know, I shouldn't be in a position of
just hearing things, Hitch.

604
00:48:37,593 --> 00:48:40,814
- It's time you showed me some footage.
- Why?

605
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:44,114
To see if you're making a picture
Paramount can actually release.

606
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:49,117
As you well know,
my contract guarantees me final cut.

607
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:50,954
Your contract also says

608
00:48:50,977 --> 00:48:53,255
Paramount isn't required
to distribute any film

609
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,793
that could cause us embarrassment.

610
00:48:54,817 --> 00:48:58,796
Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis
films you're all so proud of.

611
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,661
I demand to see some footage.
Hitch!

612
00:49:01,684 --> 00:49:05,637
You show me some damn footage now!
Hitch!

613
00:49:23,464 --> 00:49:27,230
You have no idea how wonderful it is
not to have to look after someone.

614
00:49:27,254 --> 00:49:30,436
I mean,
even if it's just for two hours.

615
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:34,088
So where are we going, Whit?
You haven't told me.

616
00:49:34,111 --> 00:49:38,103
- I have a little surprise.
- Ooh!

617
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:53,435
- Where's your driver?
- I've been asking myself the same thing.

618
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:55,936
Well, I can give you a ride
if you'd like.

619
00:49:56,967 --> 00:50:00,055
Oh, my God.
What a tiny car.

620
00:50:00,078 --> 00:50:02,511
What are these things?
I keep looking at them.

621
00:50:02,512 --> 00:50:05,439
- Candy corn. The girls love them.
- Candy corn?

622
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:08,016
I nicked them from Tony's dressing room.

623
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:11,709
Oh. Very nice.

624
00:50:11,732 --> 00:50:14,804
I thought you only ate those
Fauchon chocolates.

625
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:18,094
Needs must when the devil drives,
my dear.

626
00:50:19,128 --> 00:50:25,038
- Oh, luckily I'm driving.
- Thank God for that.

627
00:50:25,061 --> 00:50:27,897
He's always had obsessions
with his leading ladies.

628
00:50:27,898 --> 00:50:31,944
Just that this time it feels like
he's using them against me.

629
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:34,499
Well I suppose
he's like any great artist.

630
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,539
Impossible to live with,
but worth the effort.

631
00:50:37,562 --> 00:50:40,666
Did you know before we got together,
I was his boss?

632
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:44,229
He had to work his way up to assistant
director before he dared ask me out.

633
00:50:44,245 --> 00:50:45,771
- Really? Huh!
- Mm-hmm.

634
00:50:51,002 --> 00:50:52,864
See that house over there?

635
00:50:54,116 --> 00:50:56,688
- Yes.
- What do you think of it?

636
00:50:56,711 --> 00:51:01,131
- Lovely, isn't it. What a great position.
- It's mine.

637
00:51:01,154 --> 00:51:03,315
I just talked to Elizabeth.
She didn't say anything about it.

638
00:51:03,338 --> 00:51:06,836
She doesn't know anything about it.
Nobody does.

639
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:08,514
Want to see it?

640
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:23,535
- Thank you, my dear.
- Any time.

641
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,529
- Can I keep these?
- Absolutely.

642
00:51:25,553 --> 00:51:27,601
- Would you like one?
- No thank you.

643
00:51:27,622 --> 00:51:29,102
- All right. Well, thank you.
- Hitch?

644
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,440
What?

645
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:35,627
What really did happen
with you and Vera?

646
00:51:36,776 --> 00:51:39,288
Oh. Vera.

647
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:44,805
She was going to play
the lead in Vertigo.

648
00:51:44,824 --> 00:51:49,212
Two weeks before filming
she told me was pregnant.

649
00:51:50,317 --> 00:51:53,393
I was going to make her into a star.

650
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:57,539
But she chose
the life of a housewife instead.

651
00:52:01,642 --> 00:52:04,549
Why do they do it, I wonder?

652
00:52:05,364 --> 00:52:08,174
Why do they always betray me?

653
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:16,212
Oh, very Bohemian.

654
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:19,291
I just leased it for the off season.

655
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:23,860
A place to get away from the wife,
and kids, and writing.

656
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:34,324
Whit, I hope you don't
have the wrong idea.

657
00:52:36,121 --> 00:52:41,125
If you were serious
about helping me adapt my book,

658
00:52:41,148 --> 00:52:44,082
I thought it might make the perfect...

659
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:47,709
hideaway.

660
00:53:00,996 --> 00:53:04,272
Relax! Naughty boys, calm down.

661
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:51,195
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you

662
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:54,503
I read your treatment of that story.

663
00:55:55,761 --> 00:55:58,428
Taxi to... Where was it, dear?

664
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:02,052
- Dubrovnik.
- That's it. Dubrovnik.

665
00:56:05,457 --> 00:56:09,677
- Would you care to hear my opinion?
- Well, yes, naturally.

666
00:56:11,383 --> 00:56:13,102
Right, then.

667
00:56:15,013 --> 00:56:18,578
Well, my dear, there's no
other way of saying it, is there?

668
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:20,953
It's a stillborn.

669
00:56:25,895 --> 00:56:27,703
How so?

670
00:56:27,726 --> 00:56:30,289
First of all,
the plot's a bit of a muddle, isn't it?

671
00:56:31,252 --> 00:56:33,214
Some of those jokes
are awfully like the ones

672
00:56:33,238 --> 00:56:35,646
we did so much better
hundreds of years ago

673
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:37,918
in The Lady Vanishes.

674
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:42,827
Also your villain is rather weak.
Well he's very weak, in fact.

675
00:56:43,882 --> 00:56:45,785
But I think the big failure

676
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:51,443
is the relationship between
the heroine and the hero, you see.

677
00:56:54,352 --> 00:56:58,203
Probably if you weren't so smitten
with your friend Whitfield Cook,

678
00:56:58,226 --> 00:57:01,318
you'd be able to see that,
wouldn't you?

679
00:57:05,576 --> 00:57:06,668
But then I suppose

680
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:12,345
women never really care to face the truth
when their hearts are involved, do they?

681
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:18,229
How would you know what really goes on
between a man and a woman?

682
00:57:34,348 --> 00:57:37,177
My God, what a bloody mess.

683
00:58:28,779 --> 00:58:30,494
- No!
- Ah!

684
00:58:30,513 --> 00:58:32,796
More! More!

685
00:58:32,816 --> 00:58:34,960
- No! Oh!
- Use some guts!

686
00:58:34,977 --> 00:58:36,938
- Come on! No!
- Oh!

687
00:58:36,962 --> 00:58:40,043
- More anger!
- Oh! Oh!

688
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:42,265
All right, cut!
Cut! Cut!

689
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:43,737
For God's sake!

690
00:58:43,738 --> 00:58:46,460
Will someone get me
a proper stunt double?

691
00:58:46,473 --> 00:58:49,091
Now give me the knife!
Not yet!

692
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,311
Ungovernable rage!

693
00:58:56,248 --> 00:58:59,388
Homicidal violence!

694
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:25,804
Cut!
Cut and print!

695
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,468
We've got it.

696
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:56,898
Oh, not now, Ed.

697
00:59:56,921 --> 00:59:59,997
It's really not the time.

698
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:10,491
You just can't keep this stuff
bottled up.

699
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,079
Oh, God! Hitch, Hitch, you all right?

700
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:31,506
- Can you hear me?
- Alma...

701
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:38,593
What if Bridget and Constantine
get into the cab at the same time?

702
01:00:38,617 --> 01:00:41,658
Now what if they try and get in
at exactly the same time?

703
01:00:41,682 --> 01:00:44,176
- Yes. What do you mean, "exactly"?
- Ie reach the door...

704
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,921
I mean they both reach for the cab door
at exactly the same time.

705
01:00:48,922 --> 01:00:50,587
- They quickly touch.
- Yes.

706
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:54,075
We start on the hands,
we pan up to the eyes, and...

707
01:00:54,098 --> 01:00:56,897
Oh, that feels better already.

708
01:00:59,954 --> 01:01:02,373
- Are you going to get that?
- What?

709
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:30,639
Listen, I've told Peggy

710
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:34,323
you have to get this sequence
shot today.

711
01:01:34,346 --> 01:01:35,579
What's the hold-up?

712
01:01:35,603 --> 01:01:37,728
We tried it ten different ways
and it looks terrible.

713
01:01:37,745 --> 01:01:44,483
No, it has to be a high angle.
You'll tip off the big surprise.

714
01:01:44,508 --> 01:01:46,347
Just get the process shot.

715
01:01:46,675 --> 01:01:50,096
How can he hold on to the camera frame
if he's waving his arms?

716
01:01:51,101 --> 01:01:54,566
Why don't you just push all the gas
from the top of the stairs?

717
01:01:56,326 --> 01:01:57,864
No one's going to get hurt.

718
01:01:57,876 --> 01:01:59,686
What bloody idiots they are.

719
01:02:00,872 --> 01:02:02,791
- What are you doing?
- No more phone calls.

720
01:02:02,815 --> 01:02:05,269
- Oh, but...
- You're burning up.

721
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:08,019
Burning off our money,
that's what we're doing.

722
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:11,095
We're two days behind
and I'm stuck in this bloody bed.

723
01:02:11,118 --> 01:02:13,106
- Where do you think you're going?
- I've got to go to the set.

724
01:02:13,127 --> 01:02:18,071
- We can't lose another day.
- You stay in bed. I'll deal with it.

725
01:02:18,094 --> 01:02:22,067
I'd hate to take you away from
your writing partner.

726
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:25,847
You stay under the blankets, Alfred.

727
01:02:31,026 --> 01:02:32,263
- Mrs. Hitchcock.
- Good morning.

728
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:34,285
Where's Mr. Hitchcock?

729
01:02:39,727 --> 01:02:42,193
Don't stop work because of me.

730
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:45,869
I'm only here as one of the two people
paying your salaries.

731
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:48,578
- What's the scene number?
- 173.

732
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,444
Storyboards?

733
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:58,097
All right. Put Martin in the chair.
Turn the camera around to face him.

734
01:02:58,098 --> 01:03:01,096
We'll shoot the fall
against a rear screen.

735
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,134
And, Jack, that lens should be a 35mm.

736
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:09,066
Now, David,
you know how Paramount loves Jerry Lewis,

737
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,787
but this one is right up your alley,
and I would consider...

738
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,607
Barney?

739
01:03:12,618 --> 01:03:14,297
Alma!

740
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,953
You know David Kirkpatrick.

741
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:17,156
- Hello.
- Hello.

742
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:19,510
He's working on Jerry Lewis
developing a new picture.

743
01:03:19,533 --> 01:03:21,878
So he's free to help if you need.

744
01:03:23,158 --> 01:03:24,520
That won't be necessary.

745
01:03:24,543 --> 01:03:28,378
- But you're nearly three days behind.
- Yes. Well, we can manage.

746
01:03:28,402 --> 01:03:31,715
Alma, we both know
what kind of film this is.

747
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:35,066
The smart thing to do would be
to help Hitch finish it.

748
01:03:35,085 --> 01:03:36,711
Thank you for your concern, Barney.

749
01:03:36,735 --> 01:03:40,383
But on a Hitchcock picture,
there is only one director.

750
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:52,870
No need to gawp.

751
01:03:59,676 --> 01:04:02,276
You forgot to look in the bathroom.

752
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:10,111
A man like you missing
a vital clue like that...

753
01:04:12,455 --> 01:04:14,315
What do you mean?

754
01:04:17,726 --> 01:04:20,674
My mother always said

755
01:04:21,642 --> 01:04:23,986
"If you want to do a job,

756
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:27,896
do it right."

757
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:43,336
Check the floor.

758
01:04:46,709 --> 01:04:48,543
Closer.

759
01:05:03,913 --> 01:05:07,264
You still think they're just
writing together?

760
01:05:10,628 --> 01:05:13,257
What are you gonna do about it?

761
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,402
Oh, Mrs. Hitchcock.

762
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:36,051
I know Hitch isn't feeling very well,
so I got him a little something.

763
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:38,918
Oh, how kind. Thank you very much.

764
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:41,732
Candy corn.

765
01:05:41,756 --> 01:05:44,644
Well, he's always been
very considerate of me.

766
01:05:44,668 --> 01:05:47,024
I haven't always had that
from my directors.

767
01:05:49,114 --> 01:05:52,310
Janet, I'd just like to say that

768
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:55,920
you've been very professional.

769
01:05:57,179 --> 01:05:59,520
It hasn't gone unappreciated.

770
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:02,359
Thank you.

771
01:06:02,382 --> 01:06:04,662
- Lovely seeing you.
- You, too.

772
01:06:24,753 --> 01:06:26,867
May I turn it down?

773
01:06:34,931 --> 01:06:38,691
Well you'll be pleased to know
that order has been restored.

774
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:42,622
And a "thank you" would be nice.

775
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,170
We're still two days behind
and $60,000 over budget.

776
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:49,442
Yes, well I'll cancel the wrap party.
That'll save us $2000 right there.

777
01:06:49,466 --> 01:06:53,626
And you won't be tempted
by any champagne and cake.

778
01:06:53,627 --> 01:06:56,730
Beware,
all men are potential murderers.

779
01:06:58,622 --> 01:07:00,786
And for good reason.

780
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:03,610
All right, what's this all about?

781
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:17,902
Spending a lot of time at the beach?

782
01:07:22,555 --> 01:07:24,628
Yes. Yes, it's where
Whit and I are writing.

783
01:07:24,629 --> 01:07:26,701
He's rented a place.

784
01:07:26,702 --> 01:07:30,235
Hardly the ideal situation
to avoid distractions.

785
01:07:30,236 --> 01:07:33,388
Actually, it's very conducive to
creative collaboration.

786
01:07:33,389 --> 01:07:35,890
I've already told you
that treatment is a waste of time.

787
01:07:35,913 --> 01:07:38,795
Well, didn't they say
the same thing about Psycho?

788
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,205
Are you and Whit having an affair?

789
01:07:54,198 --> 01:07:56,347
Oh, don't be absurd.

790
01:07:56,371 --> 01:08:00,609
He's working on something new.
He just needs a little help, that's all.

791
01:08:00,632 --> 01:08:03,455
Oh, what a coincidence.
I'm working on something new

792
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:05,041
and I could use a little help, too!

793
01:08:05,064 --> 01:08:06,411
Well, what do you think
I've been doing?

794
01:08:06,422 --> 01:08:08,465
Why are you spending all the hours
of day and night with that

795
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:11,125
talentless mummy's boy?

796
01:08:12,118 --> 01:08:13,585
Because it's fun!

797
01:08:13,609 --> 01:08:16,658
I am under extraordinary pressures
on this picture,

798
01:08:16,682 --> 01:08:20,640
and the least you could do
is give me your full support.

799
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:23,857
Full support?

800
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:26,286
We've mortgaged our house.

801
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:29,333
Might I remind you

802
01:08:29,357 --> 01:08:32,062
I have weighed in
on every aspect of this film so far,

803
01:08:32,086 --> 01:08:35,835
as I have done on every film
you've made in the last three decades.

804
01:08:35,859 --> 01:08:39,595
First time you show the film,
it will be my notes that you want.

805
01:08:39,618 --> 01:08:41,837
I celebrate with you
when the reviews are good.

806
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:43,468
I cry for you when they are bad.

807
01:08:43,491 --> 01:08:47,002
I host your parties and
I put up with those fantasy romances

808
01:08:47,025 --> 01:08:49,346
with your leading ladies.

809
01:08:49,347 --> 01:08:51,623
And when you're out
promoting this film around the world,

810
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:54,031
I will be there beside you,
or rather, slightly behind you,

811
01:08:54,054 --> 01:08:58,396
smiling endlessly for the press
even though I'm ready to drop,

812
01:08:58,419 --> 01:09:02,095
and being gracious to people who
look through me as if I were invisible

813
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,399
or elbow me aside because all they can see

814
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,326
is the great and glorious
genius Alfred Hitchcock!

815
01:09:08,348 --> 01:09:12,366
And now, for the first time in years,

816
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:16,517
I dare to work on something that isn't
an Alfred Hitchcock production

817
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:19,835
and I'm met with
accusation and criticisms?

818
01:09:21,379 --> 01:09:25,429
The work I am doing with Whit
gives me pleasure and purpose,

819
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:29,000
and it takes absolutely
nothing away from you.

820
01:09:30,368 --> 01:09:34,664
Consider this a reminder:
I am your wife, Alma Reville.

821
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:37,550
Not one of those contract blondes
you badger

822
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,732
and torment with your
oh-so-specific directions.

823
01:10:14,998 --> 01:10:16,681
Well...

824
01:10:16,694 --> 01:10:18,812
I guess this is goodbye.

825
01:10:22,178 --> 01:10:24,632
Why didn't you stay with me?

826
01:10:26,308 --> 01:10:30,617
I would have made you
as big a star as Grace Kelly.

827
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:37,999
Well, unlike Grace Kelly,
I can pick my own dry cleaning.

828
01:10:38,603 --> 01:10:41,286
I've got a family, Hitch. A home.

829
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:48,187
That blonde woman of mystery
you're always after?

830
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,159
She's a fantasy.

831
01:10:50,183 --> 01:10:51,852
She doesn't exist.

832
01:10:53,523 --> 01:10:56,871
There was a time when
I thought I understood you.

833
01:10:58,404 --> 01:11:00,687
Understood women.

834
01:11:52,172 --> 01:11:55,318
Alma, I thought you were coming
later this afternoon.

835
01:11:55,342 --> 01:11:57,091
I thought you rented this place
so we could write.

836
01:11:57,115 --> 01:11:58,841
I did.

837
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,459
You're not going to
say anything, are you?

838
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,542
Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.

839
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:07,094
I mean to Hitch.

840
01:12:08,415 --> 01:12:13,699
Alma, we can't all be geniuses.

841
01:12:13,723 --> 01:12:15,801
You're incredibly talented.

842
01:12:15,824 --> 01:12:18,917
But, after all, we want him
to read the script with an open mind.

843
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,197
Don't we?

844
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,766
I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.

845
01:12:28,689 --> 01:12:31,307
Sheriff, please, I'm worried.

846
01:12:31,331 --> 01:12:34,419
Arbogast said he'd call
as soon as he spoke with Mrs. Bates.

847
01:12:34,431 --> 01:12:36,485
That was yesterday evening.

848
01:12:36,509 --> 01:12:40,546
- Norman isn't married.
- He said it was his mother.

849
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:44,366
Your detective saw Norman's mother
up at the motel?

850
01:12:44,389 --> 01:12:46,139
In the upstairs window.

851
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:48,582
He rang me right after
she called out to him.

852
01:12:48,606 --> 01:12:52,740
Missy, I think your detective
must be a few cups in.

853
01:12:52,764 --> 01:12:59,024
Mrs. Bates died of strychnine poisoning
more than ten years ago.

854
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:02,488
- Are you sure?
- That body was...

855
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:12,307
This is my favorite place.

856
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:17,987
I just shut the door
and make the world go away.

857
01:13:18,844 --> 01:13:22,419
Don't you ever get lonely out here?

858
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,989
I can always talk to my mother.

859
01:13:38,769 --> 01:13:41,528
That's strange.

860
01:13:41,552 --> 01:13:44,823
Jesus Christ.
I think we found his hiding place.

861
01:13:51,263 --> 01:13:53,747
That's my mother's room.

862
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:56,565
That's my mother's room.

863
01:14:03,365 --> 01:14:05,719
You can't go in there!

864
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:07,778
Don't go in my mother's room!

865
01:14:21,854 --> 01:14:24,203
Hitch?

866
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:26,152
Hitch?

867
01:14:27,244 --> 01:14:29,645
So what's the verdict?

868
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:33,755
Let's just say it was a four-letter review
and it wasn't "good."

869
01:14:36,212 --> 01:14:37,550
Screw him.

870
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:41,082
It's too late for Paramount to back out,
no matter what Balaban says.

871
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:48,009
The other route is to re-cut it
as a two-parter for the TV series.

872
01:14:48,031 --> 01:14:50,299
Because of the budget
and the Hitchcock name,

873
01:14:50,311 --> 01:14:52,401
we stand a good chance
of breaking even.

874
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:59,324
Look, I made Jimmy Stewart
a millionaire on Winchester 73,

875
01:14:59,347 --> 01:15:00,744
and that was a dog.

876
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:03,676
At least I could sit through
your picture.

877
01:15:06,508 --> 01:15:09,982
More importantly, what does Alma think?

878
01:15:34,383 --> 01:15:36,250
I was afraid you'd try to
blame yourself.

879
01:15:36,274 --> 01:15:37,577
I'm not talking of blame.

880
01:15:37,589 --> 01:15:40,031
Leigh, how can you make plans
if you're still not sure?

881
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:02,751
Whit must've enjoyed writing for Colbert.

882
01:16:09,393 --> 01:16:11,960
How was the beach?

883
01:16:13,643 --> 01:16:16,004
Cold and miserable.

884
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:21,281
Just like Barney Balaban's face.

885
01:16:25,592 --> 01:16:27,848
Poor old Whit.

886
01:16:29,469 --> 01:16:33,336
He isn't worth a damn
when he's not working with you.

887
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:40,487
Neither am I.

888
01:16:46,724 --> 01:16:50,994
I couldn't pull off the picture this time.

889
01:16:51,018 --> 01:16:54,570
It just sits there,

890
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:57,192
refusing to come to life.

891
01:17:01,323 --> 01:17:04,717
I guess there's no other way of saying it,
is there?

892
01:17:07,011 --> 01:17:09,344
It's stillborn.

893
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:18,028
I let you down, my love.

894
01:17:23,124 --> 01:17:25,923
You deserve better.

895
01:17:33,271 --> 01:17:35,473
Better go feed Geoffrey and Stanley.

896
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:39,400
Come on, boys.

897
01:18:58,695 --> 01:19:01,705
I don't think I can stand us
both being maudlin.

898
01:19:02,798 --> 01:19:08,192
That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation
I've been helping Whit finish is done.

899
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,957
You know there's only
one solution to all this.

900
01:19:13,981 --> 01:19:16,458
That we get back to work together.

901
01:19:17,472 --> 01:19:20,537
The fact is I rather like
living in this house.

902
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,430
So I suggest, for everyone's sake,
we start whipping Psycho into shape.

903
01:19:27,356 --> 01:19:29,706
You may not be the easiest man
to live with,

904
01:19:29,717 --> 01:19:32,908
but you know how to cut a picture
better than anyone else.

905
01:19:37,489 --> 01:19:39,852
Except for you.

906
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:45,015
The second take.
The light is much better on the hands.

907
01:19:49,089 --> 01:19:52,182
Only cut back to Janet
once the car's already moving.

908
01:19:52,194 --> 01:19:53,967
Cut it tighter.

909
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:00,365
Ooh, you imp, you got nudity in there!

910
01:20:00,388 --> 01:20:05,457
Her breasts were rather large.
It was a challenge not to show them.

911
01:20:05,481 --> 01:20:07,221
You'll have to cut
those six or seven frames

912
01:20:07,232 --> 01:20:09,474
where she blinks after
she's supposed to be dead.

913
01:20:09,492 --> 01:20:12,863
Alma, we've viewed the film
a thousand times.

914
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:14,671
She does not blink.

915
01:20:17,447 --> 01:20:20,888
- How's it going in there?
- Swimmingly.

916
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:23,145
Everyone's saying it's
like a dog with fleas.

917
01:20:24,177 --> 01:20:26,220
No, absolutely not!

918
01:20:26,231 --> 01:20:29,449
I do not want music
over the show murder scene.

919
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,820
But what Alma and I talked about
is really going to play.

920
01:20:31,838 --> 01:20:35,324
Bernie, this is not Vertigo.
It's not a romantic movie.

921
01:20:35,339 --> 01:20:37,121
The images must work on their own.

922
01:20:37,144 --> 01:20:39,481
Yes, but you can't scare people
just by going, "Boo!"

923
01:20:39,492 --> 01:20:41,500
All right, you do it then.
You know best.

924
01:20:41,524 --> 01:20:43,212
- They have to anticipate it.
- You always know best, just do it!

925
01:20:43,235 --> 01:20:44,752
Take a step back.

926
01:20:58,788 --> 01:21:03,037
- What do you think?
- I think I'll never have a shower again.

927
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:08,571
- Hitch?
- It's getting there.

928
01:21:12,496 --> 01:21:15,953
I distinctly saw both
the stabbing and the nudity.

929
01:21:15,972 --> 01:21:20,658
What you think you're seeing is purely
informed by the power of suggestion.

930
01:21:20,673 --> 01:21:23,785
I assure you once you
view the final version

931
01:21:23,808 --> 01:21:26,110
with Mr. Herrmann's lovely,
lyrical score...

932
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:30,512
A lyrical score is not going to
change my opinion.

933
01:21:31,698 --> 01:21:34,621
We're denying your seal.

934
01:21:35,526 --> 01:21:38,903
Geoffrey, would you mind if we had a word
in private, please?

935
01:21:45,411 --> 01:21:47,257
Thank you.

936
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:55,508
Now look here.

937
01:21:55,531 --> 01:21:58,666
I have a modest proposal to make.

938
01:21:58,678 --> 01:22:02,013
If you're willing to leave
the shower sequence as it is,

939
01:22:02,036 --> 01:22:07,415
I will re-shoot the opening love scene
to your exact specifications.

940
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:12,718
In fact, I would welcome your
personal supervision on the set.

941
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:18,558
To my specifications?

942
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,376
But of course, my dear fellow.

943
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,277
If only audiences
could fully comprehend

944
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:27,729
how tirelessly you work
to help us entertain them

945
01:22:27,753 --> 01:22:31,882
while protecting them
from filth and indecency.

946
01:22:38,646 --> 01:22:41,131
He's been harassing you
since you announced this project,

947
01:22:41,154 --> 01:22:43,550
you invite him to the set,
and he doesn't even show up?

948
01:22:43,573 --> 01:22:45,228
What did you tell him?

949
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:48,119
That I respected him deeply.

950
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:57,181
Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap.
Thank you all very much.

951
01:23:00,655 --> 01:23:04,107
- I thought we were re-shooting the scene.
- The charade is over.

952
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:05,907
Thank you.

953
01:23:11,926 --> 01:23:15,578
See, I wasn't that much of a monster
to work with, was I?

954
01:23:15,601 --> 01:23:17,280
Not at all.

955
01:23:17,304 --> 01:23:20,257
I hope I was sufficiently loyal
to the cause.

956
01:23:20,281 --> 01:23:23,183
Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear.

957
01:23:45,485 --> 01:23:47,058
I hope you don't mind,

958
01:23:47,082 --> 01:23:50,423
I told Mrs. Bates
she could use your dressing room.

959
01:23:57,394 --> 01:24:00,850
No, that's splendid. Splendid.

960
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:04,627
Yes, thank you.

961
01:24:05,509 --> 01:24:07,223
Thank you.

962
01:24:07,247 --> 01:24:09,897
We have the seal
from the Shurlock Office.

963
01:24:09,922 --> 01:24:12,987
So now,
we lead the lambs to the slaughter.

964
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:16,267
Paramount confirmed they're only
opening the movie in two theaters,

965
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:18,450
as we suspected.
And no premiere.

966
01:24:19,725 --> 01:24:22,695
We don't get word of mouth, we're dead.

967
01:24:24,287 --> 01:24:27,422
Then we'd better get started.
Peggy, take a memo.

968
01:24:27,445 --> 01:24:31,540
We're going to write a manual
on how to sell Psycho.

969
01:24:33,883 --> 01:24:36,796
"My first instruction to Theater Owners:

970
01:24:36,819 --> 01:24:42,272
Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce
our unique admission policies."

971
01:24:42,296 --> 01:24:44,613
There may be riots here tonight.

972
01:24:44,614 --> 01:24:46,929
"Because is Psycho is
so terrifying and unique,

973
01:24:46,952 --> 01:24:51,664
"the guards can help you deal
with customers who run amok.

974
01:24:51,687 --> 01:24:53,588
"Post our special lobby clocks

975
01:24:53,612 --> 01:24:57,980
"to remind audiences
of the starting times for Psycho.

976
01:24:58,003 --> 01:25:02,850
The manager of this fine motion picture
theater has been advised

977
01:25:02,874 --> 01:25:07,955
not to allow anyone to enter the theater
once Psycho begins.

978
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:12,608
Now, should you be so foolish as to
attempt to slip in by a side entrance,

979
01:25:12,631 --> 01:25:15,434
a fire escape or through a skylight,

980
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:18,922
you will be ejected by brute force.

981
01:25:18,945 --> 01:25:21,383
More playful, darling.

982
01:25:21,406 --> 01:25:27,336
"To further emphasize the sheer,
unrelenting shock and suspense of Psycho,

983
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:30,457
"right after the closing title "The End,"

984
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,480
"we strongly recommend
that you close your house

985
01:25:34,481 --> 01:25:38,480
curtains over the screen
for a full 30 seconds.

986
01:25:39,908 --> 01:25:43,102
"By doing so, the horror of Psycho

987
01:25:43,125 --> 01:25:49,102
"will be indelibly etched
in the mind and heart of your audience.

988
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:53,924
Sincerely and emphatically,
Alfred Hitchcock."

989
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:56,247
Well at least there are some people here,
Hitch.

990
01:26:04,616 --> 01:26:06,536
We've roped off some seats for you.

991
01:26:07,812 --> 01:26:09,754
- You go on ahead.
- Are you sure?

992
01:26:09,773 --> 01:26:12,473
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment. I'm
just going to check the print. You go on.

993
01:26:12,497 --> 01:26:14,904
All right, darling.
We'll save you a seat, all right?

994
01:26:16,336 --> 01:26:18,345
This way, Mr. Hitchcock.

995
01:28:18,781 --> 01:28:20,584
Just got off the phone with Balaban.

996
01:28:20,607 --> 01:28:24,181
He said congratulations. A well-deserved
triumph, as we always knew.

997
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,534
As we always knew, ha!

998
01:28:26,557 --> 01:28:28,674
Does this mean I can
take the weekend off now?

999
01:28:28,675 --> 01:28:30,791
Yes, dear. Thank you so much.

1000
01:28:30,815 --> 01:28:33,105
- Where's Alma?
- Go. Go on.

1001
01:28:44,566 --> 01:28:46,923
Alma, come here.

1002
01:28:53,957 --> 01:28:57,581
You know, darling, this could be the
biggest success of your career.

1003
01:28:59,061 --> 01:29:01,597
Our career.

1004
01:29:03,143 --> 01:29:10,761
Alma, I will never be able to find
a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you.

1005
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:19,858
I've waited thirty years
to hear you say that.

1006
01:29:19,882 --> 01:29:26,142
And that, my dear, is why they
call me the Master of Suspense.

1007
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:51,028
And so, gentle viewers,

1008
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:54,828
Psycho turned out to be
one of my greatest achievements,

1009
01:29:54,851 --> 01:30:00,099
and Alma and I got to keep the house
and the swimming pool.

1010
01:30:00,122 --> 01:30:03,445
But you know what they say in Hollywood:

1011
01:30:03,469 --> 01:30:07,011
You're only as good as your last picture.

1012
01:30:07,029 --> 01:30:11,573
So if you'll excuse me,
I had better toddle away

1013
01:30:11,597 --> 01:30:16,373
to begin the exhaustive search
for my next project.

1014
01:30:16,397 --> 01:30:23,913
Unfortunately, I find myself once again
quite bereft of any inspiration.

1015
01:30:23,937 --> 01:30:29,778
However, I do hope
something comes along soon.

1016
01:30:34,548 --> 01:30:36,984
Good evening.
