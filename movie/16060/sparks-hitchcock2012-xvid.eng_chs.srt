Apparently the authorities shared my naivet

15
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:55,021
In other words, they believed the young man's story

I could already hear the screams and the laughter.
我已经能听到观众的尖叫声和笑声了

Any questions, my dear? Pity.

32
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:12,810
But you're sixty years old.
可是你已经60岁了

33
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,023

Talking of arrows,
说起箭

你看到纽约时报上A.H.Weiler写的短评么？

他说他觉得影片的高潮”太过了“

为什么明知原汁原味的还在他们还要找新人啊？

45
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:14,666
Oh, don't be maudlin, you know how much it aggravates me.
矮油，别多愁善感了，你也知道这玩意儿多容易激怒我

46
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,559

You've been reading them for a week.

Right between the shoulder blades. I learned it from your pictures.
不就在一对肩胛骨之间么，这可是从你电影里学到的

我只是在想你能不能在这上面使用一下你的修建花园的手艺

It takes place in the motel bathroom.

00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:50,222
cut off her scream, and her head."
切断了尖叫声，还有她的头颅”

136
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,213
Charming. Doris Day should do it as a musical.
不错。Doris Day可以把它演成音乐剧

137
00:10:55,237 --> 00:11:00,142
That is nothing but low-budget horror movie claptrap.
这根本就是小成本恐怖电影的俗烂桥段

138
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:07,276
But what if someone really good made a horror picture?
但是如果交到某个非常擅长于制作惊悚片的人手里呢？

139
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,672
Just think of the shock value.

Killing off your leading lady halfway through.
在影片一半的时候杀掉女主角

Admit it.
承认吧！

144
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,847
Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.
恰恰相反，我倒是觉得是个巨大的错误

145
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:37,146
You shouldn't wait till halfway through. Kill her off after thirty minutes.
你完全不需要等到影片的一半。三十分钟后就杀了她

146
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:41,882
Well!
哈

147
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:46,360
Peggy, I want you to summon your minions.
Peggy，叫上你的下属们过来

148
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:49,131
- Minions? - Right away.

149
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:52,343
Certainly. And who might they be?

150
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:56,100
Get them started buying copies of Psycho.
让他们将市面上所有的《惊魂记》买回来！

- 你要多少本？ - 全部！每一本！全国范围内！

152
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:02,906
Scour every bookshop, every library. And I mean everywhere.
搜刮所有的书店、图书馆，也就是所有地方。

153
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,879
Psycho is going to be my next movie,
《惊魂记》就是我下一部电影

154
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:08,417
and I don't want anyone to know the ending until they see it in the theater.
我不想让任何人在看电影前就知道结局

155
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:13,210
Look at that.
看

156
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:20,976
Are you sure about this? This is so unlike you.
你确定要做这个？这一点也不是你的风格

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,048
That is exactly the point, my dear.

good afternoon.

and the real-life inspiration behind Psycho.
以及这本书背后的我的真实的灵感

163
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:53,686
All of us harbor dark recesses of violence,

and horror.

165
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:59,573
Fascinating, isn't it?
精彩吧？

166
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:05,045
When the Wisconsin Police Department raided Mr. Gein's farm,
当Wisconsin警察局突袭了Gein先生的农场后，

167
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:09,464
they opened the door... And voila!
他们打开门。然后，哇！

168
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:15,137
They discovered ten female heads with the tops sawn off.
他们发现十个顶部被锯平的女性头颅

169
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,987
Pass these around, would you? And have a look.

170
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,476
Masks of human skin.

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,284
A pair of lips on a drawstring for a window shade.

啊对了，还有一个装满鼻子的罐子

这真是是你下一部电影吗，希区柯克先生？

Well, that is my intention, yes, madam.
嗯是的夫人，那我的打算

我唯一的希望就是Ed Gein看起来更像William Holden而不是Elmer Fudd

By the way, try the finger sandwiches. They're real fingers.
说起来，试试手指三明治。里面可是夹着真的手指。

177

Bloody hell!

178
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,647
Now don't pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it.
你别假装不对他没读你的剧本而生气了

179
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,744
I'm not. I'm a big boy, I can take it.
我没有生气。我是个大男孩了，可以接受这一切

180
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,529

It must be great fun to research.

182
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:02,339
Do you really think he will read it?

183
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:05,075
Ah, speak of the devil.
啊，说曹操曹操到

184
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:09,161
Hitch, I ran all over town trying to find a copy of Psycho
阿希啊，我跑遍全城想找一本《惊魂记》来看看

185
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:11,415
but I simply cannot find one.
可是我连一本都找不到。

186
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:16,029
- I wonder how that could have happened. - Yeah.
- 我也想知道为什么会这样 - 好吧

187
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,818
Don't stop looking on my behalf.
你为了我也得继续找下去

188
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:21,354
Hitch, you should come.
希区先生，你应该来一下

189
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:31,033
I've seen happier faces on a school bus going over a cliff.
校车路过悬崖孩子们都比这个高兴

190
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:37,453
But they can't stop looking, can they?
但是他们没法不看，对吧？

191
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:46,047
Audiences want to be shocked, Barney.
观众想被惊吓，Barney

192
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:48,642
They want something different.

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,726
Every time you want to do something different
每一次你想做些有新意的事情

195
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:58,185
like The Wrong Man or Vertigo, someone loses money.
像《申冤记》或者《迷魂记》，总有人会亏钱

196
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,498
So we should stop trying to give them something new?
所以我们就不能做有新意的事情了么

197
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,718
You owe Paramount one last picture, Hitch.
你还差派拉蒙最后一部电影

198
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:07,771
Can't you do something like North by Northwest
你就不能做一部像《西北偏北》这样的电影

199
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:11,163
but for us this time instead of for MGM?
而且是为我们做一部，而不是为米高梅

200
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:15,956
Psycho.
就做《惊魂记》

201
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:22,673
No one respects the name Hitchcock like Paramount.
没有人比派拉蒙更尊重希区柯克这四个字

202
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:28,894
Are you telling me "no," Barney?
你的意思是不接受么，Barney？

203
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,923
I think you know me better than that, Hitch.
我觉得你没明白我的意思

204
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,879
What a putz.
这算什么

205
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:39,251
You know what his family did before they built those movie palaces?

My father ran a grocery store.
我父亲也曾经营杂货店

208
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:49,252
Exactly. That's what I'm saying. He should show some respect.
对啊，这正是我想说的，他应该表现出更多的尊重

209
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:54,731
They think I've lost my touch, Lew.
他们觉得我江郎才尽了，Lew

210
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:58,923
My association with television has cheapened me.
我和电视界的交情在他们看来使我贬值了

211
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:01,071
Are you referring to that deal I got you
你指的是我那次帮你找的机会

212
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:04,873
where Bristol-Meyers pays you 29 grand
an episode and you own the negative?
Bristol-Meyers付你2万9千一集的薪酬，并且底片仍属于你自己

213
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,296
That's my kind of cheap.
我倒觉得这才是贬值

214
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:11,151
They just want the same thing over and over and over.
我总是反反复复追求同一个风格

215
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:14,880
They've put me in a coffin and now they're nailing down the lid.
他们已经将我放在一副棺材里而现在正想把棺材盖钉死

216
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:19,065
Hitch, as your agent, I will never let that happen.
希区柯克，我作为你的经纪人，绝对不会让这件事发生的

217
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:26,989
How much you think you can make this picture for?
你估计需要多少钱

218
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:29,770
$800,000, give or take.

219
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,920
You're home early.

220
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,192
Oh, it's lovely actually.
噢，这其实挺好的

221
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,330
You know, I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's book a chance.
你没给Whit的书一个机会让我还蛮失落的

222
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:04,498
And what about Whit? Is he disappointed?
Whit怎么想？他失落么？

223
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,846
Oh, no. He knows you well enough.
他不会，他知道你的作风

224
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:10,814
Look at that! Time for a new one anyway.
哎呀你看看这件衣服。反正也该买件新的。

225
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:14,233
Well you'd better enjoy the pool, my dear, while you can.
你应该多用用这池塘，亲爱的，特别是趁你腿脚还利索的时候

226
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,311
We might not have it much longer.
《惊魂记》可能拍不下去了

227
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:21,732
Why?
为什么？

228
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:24,889
Paramount refuses to finance the movie.
派拉蒙不愿意投资

229
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:28,487
Oh, Hitch, I'm so sorry.
噢，小希，好遗憾啊

230
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:33,024
Lew can't find the money. At least, not fast enough.
Lew还没能找到资金。或者说，没那么快能找到资金

231
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,558
Well why not wait?
为什么不等一段时间呢？

232
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:38,070
No.
不行

233
00:17:40,712 --> 00:17:45,811
Just going to have to go it alone, old girl.
可能要不得不要独立出片了，老女孩

234
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:48,209
Finance it ourselves.
自己投资

235
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,019
Are we going to have to sell the whole house or just the pool?
你是想卖掉整套房子呢，还是只卖这个池塘。

236
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:03,571
I just want to do the film.
我只是想把这电影拍出来

237
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,223
I will ask you this once and I'll never mention it again.
我只问一次这个问题

238
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:16,857
Why this one, Hitch?
为什么现在一定要拍《惊魂记》？

239
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,573
It's not just because so many people are saying "no," is it?
不仅仅是因为那么多人说“不同意”吧？

240
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:28,165
Do you remember the fun we had when we started out all those years ago?
你还记得当年我们刚开始做电影时的快乐么

241
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:32,249
We didn't have any money then, did we?
当时我们一分钱没有，不是么？

242
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,753
We didn't have any time, either, but we took risks, do you remember?
时间我们也没有多少。但是我们愿意冒险，你还记得吗？

243
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:44,920
We experimented. We invented new ways of making pictures

244
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:47,430
because we had to.
因为我们必须得这样做

245
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:56,206
I want to feel that kind of freedom again.

246
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,414
Like we used to, you know?
就像我们当年那样，你明白么？

247
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:13,694
We are about to propose a restructured deal for Psycho.
我们打算做一个重建《惊魂记》提议

248
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:16,031
I'm listening.
说吧

249
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:20,312
We finance it independently.
我们自己独立出资

250
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:25,518
Hitch waives his directorial fee. Paramount only distributes it,
阿希放弃他的导演费用。派拉蒙只负责发行，

251
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:29,203
in exchange for 40% of the profits.
40%的收益归派拉蒙所有（但愿没翻译错）

252
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:34,440
Interesting. But what exactly is Paramount distributing?
有意思。但是派拉蒙为什么发行？

253
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:38,790
Is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mother's dress?
这不还是那部怪胎穿着妈妈的裙子干谋杀的电影么？

254
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:42,690
What this picture is about is the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock.
这部电影其实是代表了希区柯克的名声

255
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:46,283
- No one is arguing that. - Barney,
- 没人不同意这一点 - Barney

256
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:49,488
it's very simple.
其实很简单

257
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:52,545
This is Mr. Hitchcock's next film.
这就是希区柯克下一部电影

258
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:57,142
Are you in or are you out?
干不干这一票，你决定

259
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:06,312
Fine. We'll take that deal.
好，派拉蒙同意

260
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,895
If you can get the money.
只要你能筹到钱

261
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,018
We already have the money, Barney.
我们已经有足够的钱了，Barney

262
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,991
Who do I make it out to?
支票应该开给谁？

263
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:32,357
If this picture fails, Alma,
如果这部电影不卖座，Alma

264
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:37,500
we'll be in for a long, humiliating bout of crow-eating.
我们会吃很长一段时间的丢人的闭门羹

265
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:44,720
- It'll be splendid. - Are you sure?
- 会很精彩的 - 你确定？

266
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:49,871
Of the movie? Not at all.
电影？从来没这么觉得

267
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:54,291
But of you? Unquestionably.
但是希区柯克？毫无疑问的

268
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,100
Ahem.
咳

269
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,738
- Joe Stefano. Good to meet you. - Sit down.
- 我是Joe Stefano，很高兴见到你 - 坐下吧

270
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:08,323
I'm sorry I was late.
抱歉我迟到了

271
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,542
My shrink session went overtime.
我被心理诊疗的时间延误了

272
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:16,701
I see him every day and it's still not enough.
我每天都去他那儿，但还是不够

273
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:20,511
I thought it was only director's assistants who needed psychiatrists,
我以为只有导演助理才需要去看精神科医生

274
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:22,730
not writers.
而不是编剧

275
00:21:27,143 --> 00:21:29,467
Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock?
你会去看心理医生么，希区柯克先生？

276
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:32,228
I have to confess, Mr. Stefano,
我必须承认，Stefano先生

277
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:34,846
It boggles my brain just trying to imagine.
幻想才是烦恼我大脑的东西

278
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,863
What you and your shrink could possibly talk about every day?
你和你的心理医生每天都说些什么内容？

279
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:45,206
The usual: Sex. Rage. My mother.
老三样：性、强奸和我妈

280
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:57,466
Good morning, sir.
早上好，先生

281
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:01,091
Let me have a look at you.
让我检查下你

282
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:05,920
The only thing worse than a visit to the dentist is a visit to censor.
比看牙医还糟糕的事情只有见审查员了

283
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:08,855
Whatever you do, Hitch, don't lose your temper.
不管怎么样，你都要控制好情绪

284
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,382
- See you later. - Good luck.
- 再见 - 祝你好运

285
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:18,975
The Code will absolutely not permit you
（海斯）法典肯定不允许你的这部电影

286
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:22,227
to show a knife penetrating a woman's flesh.
有一把刀插入女性的身体

287
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,056
I assure you, Geoffrey,
我向你保证，Geoffrey

288
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,317
my murders are always models of taste and discretion.
我的杀人犯一直是品味和谨慎的典范

289
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:32,954
Is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this
电影会有不恰当的裸体暗示

290
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,223
murder scene in the shower?
在这段浴室谋杀戏当中么？

291
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:39,335
She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a shower cap.
女主角不会裸体，她会带着浴帽。。。

292
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:47,659
We might accept a shot from outside the bathroom window
我们也许允许一个从浴室窗户外面拍摄的

293
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:50,042
of Marion in silhouette above the shoulders.
Marion的过肩黑色轮廓的镜头，

294
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,848
Provided that the glass is frosted.
而且还要在窗户有雾气的情况下

295
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:55,281
Thank you.
感激不尽

296
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:59,647
And the scene with the toilet.
然后还有那场厕所的戏

297
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,118
It is completely necessary to show the toilet,
真的非常有必要拍摄厕所

298
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:05,602
because Marion Crane attempts to flush evidence down it.
因为Marion Crane尝试在马桶冲掉所有的证据

299
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:08,615
Remnants of which are later discovered by her sister.
而未被处理掉的证据在这之后会被女主人公的姐姐发现

300
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:14,641
These remnants, you understand, are clues to her vanishing.
这些证据，你要明白，是她无故消失的线索

301
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:19,505
No American movie has ever found it necessary to show a toilet,
没有美国电影觉得有必要展示厕所

302
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,818
let alone to flush one.
更别说冲厕所了

303
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:24,935
Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France
我想应该在法国拍这电影

304
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,540
and use a bidet instead.
用（洗生殖器和臀部用的）坐浴盆来替代马桶

305
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:36,003
Mr. Hitchcock, if this office denies you a seal,
希区柯克先生，如果本部门送你一个禁映

306
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:38,569
and we're certainly heading in that direction,
而且我们现在看起来也正往这个方向上走去

307
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:44,159
your movie will not be released in a single theater in this country.
你的电影将不会有资格在这个国家任何一个电影院上映

308
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:47,086
Will you be making jokes then?
到那时你再开玩笑吧

309
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:52,877
Everyone in Hollywood resents me.
每个在好莱坞的人都恨我

310
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:55,255
I make them millions of dollars,
我为他们赚了成千上万的钱

311
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,058
and every year I sit at those dreadful award show dinners,
而且每年还要参加那些无聊的颁奖晚宴

312
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:04,205
waiting for someone just to say, "You're good."
等着某个人来说一句“你真牛”

313
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:11,835
They take sadistic pleasure in denying me that one little moment.
他们从拒绝我的那一瞬间中获取病态的快乐

314
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,981
That must hurt.
那一定很受伤

315
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,954
Deeply, Ed. Deeply.
伤得很深，Ed，非常深

316
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:27,521
Sorry, doctor. I'm just not used to this...
不好意思，医生。我只是不习惯这个

317
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,434
process.
过程

318
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:35,158
Just think of me more like a friend.
就把我想象成你个朋友

319
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:39,385
It's just that more and more I've been having these...
这些冲动我到现在为止变得越来越多

320
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:40,571
impulses.

321
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:48,104
What kind of impulses?
什么冲动？

322
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,749
Strong ones.
强烈的冲动

323
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,028
Here.
这个

324
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:19,492
The Lazar Office tell me he's crazy to work with you.
Lazar告诉我他非常想和你合作

325
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:23,543
Tell Swifty Lazar he should not have overexposed his client on television.
告诉他他不应该让他的客户在电视上过分曝光

326
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:26,164
Unlike some we could mention.
不像有一些事情我们可以提一下

327
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:31,867
- Anthony Perkins. - Oh...
- Anthony Perkins - 噢。。

328
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:35,106
Think of the duality he could bring to the role of Norman.
想想他能给角色Norman带去多少的二重性

329
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:37,697
The rage lurking beneath that little boy grin.
多少暴戾隐藏在这个小男孩的笑容里

330
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:41,339
The winsome charm he uses to keep from being found out.
他的迷人气质让人从不察觉到他的秘密

331
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:45,859
Why, Alma, you're not suggesting Mr. Perkins is...?
为什么，Alma？你不会是在暗示Perkins先生是？

332
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:47,562
Hm.
嗯~

333
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:50,745
What?
什么？

334
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,829
I like your office.
我喜欢你的办公室

335
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:06,680
I can't count how many times I've seen Strangers on a Train.
我已经数不过来看过多少次《火车怪客》了

336
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,476
And Rope.
还有《夺魂索》

337
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:15,012
Well, Norman Bates is the logical extension of those two characters in that movie.
好吧。Norman Bates合理延伸了刚才你提到的那种电影当中两个主角

338
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:18,873
Appealing, sensitive, suffering the terrible burden
他很诱人、敏感、承受着

339
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:22,430
of being forced to pretend to be something he is not.
被迫假装不属于他的一个身份的折磨

340
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:30,362
I'm sick of all this romantic crap the studios keep shoving me into.
我已经受不了这些制片公司硬塞给我的浪漫陈词滥调的角色

341
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:33,262
But my only worry is,
但是我唯一担心的是

342
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:36,589
well, playing Norman might cut too close to home.
嗯，饰演Norman也许太相似于我的过去了

343
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,070
How so?
为什么？

344
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:49,417
When I was younger, I was incredibly close to my mother.
在我年轻的时候，我非常黏我的母亲

345
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,759
So close that I remember wishing my father would drop dead.
黏到我以至于非常希望父亲可以就此死掉

346
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:59,669
And then when I was five, he did just that.
而我爸确实死了，在我五岁的时候

347
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:01,970
He keeled over from a heart attack.
死于心脏病

348
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:12,681
You see I've been guilty my whole life, Mr. Hitchcock.
我一直有罪恶感，希区柯克先生

349
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:20,775
You know, I'm getting blisters just watching you.
你知道么，我光是看着你做这些就能起水泡

350
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,337
Oh, stop complaining.
噢，别抱怨了

351
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,261
A bit of fresh air and exercise will do you good.
新鲜空气和运动对你是有好处的

352
00:27:25,284 --> 00:27:28,945
- I'm going to have a drink. - No you're not. You're going to finish that hedge.
- 我去喝点东西 - 不，不行。你要去搞定那个篱笆

353
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,667
You've got to go all the way around there, all the way around there, all the way around there.
你要修好所有的

354
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,996
- It's impossible. I can't do that. - Yes you can.
- 这不可能，我没法做完 - 你可以

355
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,274
You know, I was thinking, if I could get Grace Kelly to play the girl,
你知道，我在想，如果我能让Grace Kelly饰演女主角

356
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:43,458
they'd let me get away with murder.
他们就会让我拍凶杀戏

357
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:47,433
Well you can't. She's a princess now, which makes her permanently unattainable.
这不可能。她是公主，这就意味着你根本请不到她

358
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,758
And all the more desirable.
这让我更想要她了

359
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:53,283
What about Deborah Kerr? Lew mentioned her.
Deborah Kerr怎么样？Lew提起过她

360
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:55,440
No, she's too Scottish.
不行，她太苏格兰化了

361
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:59,527
What about Janet Leigh?
诶，Janet怎么样？

362
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:03,807
I know she's normally the "good girl," but she was awfully good in Touch of Evil.
我知道她基本上算是一个乖乖女，但是她在《历劫佳人》里表现得太出色了

363
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:08,230
You remember how you always used to remark on her figure at the Wassermans' parties?
你还记得在Wassermans的派对上你曾经“提到”过她的身材么？

364
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,401
Yeah.
对诶

365
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,188
- Good evening. - Hello.
- 晚上好 - 你好

366
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,105
- Lovely to see you. - Charmed.
- 很高兴见到你 - 你真迷人

367
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:23,124
- Hi. - Hello, Janet. How are you?
- 你好 - 你好，Janet

368
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:25,062
Wonderful to see you.
见到你太好了

369
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:28,918
- Well, my dear, you look very beautiful. - Thank you.

370
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:30,996
Very beautiful.
真的非常漂亮

371
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:39,300
Of course the real secret of Mrs. Simpson's appeal to the Duke of Windsor
当然了，Simpson女士之所以会喜欢Windsor公爵的真实原因在于

372
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:43,132
was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar.
她可以将一支雪茄变得像一支雪茄

373
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:47,674
Oh, I've been so immersed in preparing to play Marion
噢。我一直非常投入准备扮演Marion

374
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:50,121
I'd almost forgotten how to laugh.
我都快忘记怎么大笑了

375
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:51,512
- Oh, really? - Yes.
- 是么？ - 是的

376
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:54,889
Now, now, you must try the banana shortcake.
现在，你必须尝尝这里的香蕉油酥糕饼

377
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:57,791
Oh, no. Nothing for me, thank you. I'm watching my figure.
噢，不了，我吃不动了。谢谢。我必须要照顾好我的身材。

378
00:28:57,815 --> 00:29:00,755
Yes, you're not the only one. We're fine, thank you.
是的，不仅仅只有你需要照顾。我们不用了，谢谢。

379
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,567
George, bring her the banana shortcake.
George，给她来一份香蕉油酥糕饼

380
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:05,984
In fact, make that two large portions. Thank you.
呃等会儿，两份大的吧。谢谢

381
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:10,381
Now tell me, my dear, how else have you prepared for the part of Marion Crane?
告诉我亲爱的，你还为Marion Crane准备了什么？

382
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:12,859
Well, I've written an entire history for her,
嗯，我写下了她的整个历程

383
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:16,457
which seems a little silly, I know, but it really does help.
这看起来确实有点傻，我知道，可还是很有用的

384
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,099
- It doesn't sound silly at all. - No?
- 一点都不傻 - 真的？

385
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:22,648
Why don't you tell us one of her deepest secrets?
要不你告诉我们她其中一个深藏的秘密

386
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:28,360
Well, she leads a double life.

At the Lowery Office, she wears Tweed perfume.

388
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:34,172
But when she's with Sam,

389
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:38,775
she recklessly breaks out her most expensive bottle.

"My Sin" by Lanvin.

- "My Sin"? - Yes.

392
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:45,861
Good Lord!
上帝啊

393
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,643
I do have a concern or two.
我确实有一两个顾虑

394
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:52,892
I'm an actress, of course, but I'm first a wife and a mother.
我是一名女演员，这点没错，但是我首先还是一个妻子和母亲

395
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,145
And I'm just curious to know...

How are you going to shoot this shower scene?

Yes, you and the Shurlock Office.
是的，你还有福尔摩斯

398
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:06,843
It's only that, well, from here up, I'm not exactly boyish.
如果只是，要拍上半身全身，嗯，我还没那么爷们儿

399
00:30:06,867 --> 00:30:10,079
Allow me to set your mind at rest, my dear.
允许我让你放松一下，亲爱的

400
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:13,578
I will be shooting short bits of film from various angles.
我将会拍摄好几个不同角度的短镜头

401
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:17,693
Cut together, the montage will only suggest nudity.
最后剪辑在一起，蒙太奇会暗示出裸露的信息

402
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,124
Suggest violence.

403
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:21,533
Nothing will actually be shown.
不会真的裸露出来

404
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:25,545
But of course, having you in the shower
不过当然了，如果能够有一场你的洗浴的戏

405
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:29,807
would make it all the more, well, titillating.
会让这部分，嗯，更加挑逗

406
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:33,351
Will you excuse me?

407
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:51,508
Alma, dear, how lovely to see you.
Alma，怎么在这里见到你了

408

Oh, hello, Lillian.
噢，你好，Lillian

409
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:55,829
You're looking a little pale.
你气色看起来不怎么样啊

410
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:59,194
No wonder with that thing your husband's working on now.
这也不奇怪，因为你丈夫做的那么诡异的事情

411
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:01,426
You can't possibly approve.

Why are you letting him do something so tasteless?
干嘛要让他做这么没有品位的事情

413
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:08,314
Don't upset yourself, darling. It's only a bloody movie.
亲爱的，你倒是干嘛那么气色差？这无非就是一部电影

414
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:29,159
I can't believe you made Vera Miles play the sister.
你居然让Vera Miles演姐姐

415
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:32,998
Well, I've still got her under contract. May as well get something out of her.
反正她还在合同期内，总要用一下她不是么

416
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:35,786
Rather a thankless role, don't you think?
她可是一个从来不领情的人，你难道不觉得么？

417
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:38,660
For an utterly thankless girl.
是非常的不领情

418
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:53,229
Horrible.
太倒胃口了

419
00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:55,977
The old man really is unhappy with me, isn't he?
那个老家伙真的对我不满呢

420
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,779
Wait till you see the undergarments he has picked out for you.
等下你先试试他给你挑的内衣

421
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:05,091
Okay. Well, I am just going to have to keep telling myself,
这样，好吧。我就告诉自己

422
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:08,854
one more picture and I'm free as a bird.
这是给他拍的最后一部电影，之后我就自由了

423
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,465
So I've made a list of places where we can tighten our belts.
我做好了一份我们哪儿可以节省的清单？

424
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:28,256
Huh?
啊？

425
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:32,460
We could all learn the art of self-restraint, couldn't we, Alfred?
我们都可以学习一下节俭的技巧，不是么阿弗？

426
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:37,970
Gardeners once a week, weekend off for the driver...
一周只请一次园丁、周末不请司机

427
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:41,287
No, that's impossible. We'll have to find other places to cut.
这怎么行。我们还是找别的方面来节流吧

428
00:32:41,311 --> 00:32:43,131
There aren't any other places.
没有其他方面了

429
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:47,333
And there's be no more shipments flown in from Maxim's of Paris.
然后，还有从巴黎的Maxim's运来的货物我们也得放弃

430
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:49,700
We can't afford it.
我们付不起了

431
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:52,618
The foie gras at Chasen's is more than adequate.
Chasen's的鹅肝我们也吃不起了

432
00:32:52,642 --> 00:32:56,653
But those geese are from Barstow, not from Marseilles.
但是那些鹅是从Barstow来的，又不是从Marseilles

433
00:32:56,677 --> 00:33:01,878
Yes, well we all have to make our sacrifices for the greater good, don't we, Alfred?
我们都要为了实现长远的目标牺牲一下不是么阿弗？

434

I'll go get the knives.
我去拿下刀子

435

Am I making a terrible mistake?

436
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,691
What if it's another Vertigo?
要是这只是又一部《迷魂记》怎么办？

00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,234
Just get the first take under your belt. You'll be fine.
你先拍下第一个镜头，一切都会好起来的

438
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,776
Are you decent, my dear?

我还想再谢谢你能给我这个机会，希区柯克先生

你可以叫我希胖，把“柯克”去掉

445
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:44,699
Well look at you two. America's favorite boy and girl next door.
好了，看看你们俩，美国最受欢迎的邻家男孩女孩

是啊，现在又要搬进一座新的“邻家”

You're the genius.

One thing, though. My script is missing its last ten pages.
还有一件事就是，我的剧本最后十页怎么没了？

等我的Alma把剧本修订完了，所有人呢的剧本才能补上最后十页

I feel like I should take offense at that.

Perhaps Norman secretly watched his mother

preparing for her nightly bath.

Hitch, I have a question.

would be better in the scene.

你完全可以亲自告诉他，他会非常开心的

515
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,244
You know, my dear,
亲爱的，

516
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:44,681
maybe I was a bit too dismissive about your friend

517
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:47,688
Whitfield's book.

Perhaps he and Elizabeth could come over this weekend

and walk me through it, as they say.

Lovely woman, Elizabeth.

Yes.

00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:27,491
You think you can get away with it, don't you? But you can't.
你以为你可以逃掉。可是你逃不掉

525
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:30,229
You think they can't tell, but they can.

They know.

You can feel that noose tightening around that breakable little neck.

528
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:38,993
I mean, you could return the money secretly,
换句话说，你完全可以把钱悄悄还回去

529
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:41,165
but what would that prove? It's too late.
但是那又有什么用？亡羊补牢了

530
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:43,999
Marion Crane always so tight, so respectable,
Marion Crane做事总是特别紧凑、体面

现在他们都知道了你那些隐藏已久的秘密

534
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:57,151
Messy, sticky little lunchtime trysts
和一个叫Samuel Loomis“哎呀妈真帅”的失败男人

535
00:43:57,175 --> 00:44:01,458
with that oh-so-handsome failure Mr. Samuel Loomis.
纠缠、粘黏的午间秘密约会

他们偷笑，他们会八卦，他们会窃窃私语

537
00:44:03,846 --> 00:44:07,333
Even your boss, straight-laced, hatchet-faced Mr. George Lowery,
甚至你那个古板严肃的瘦脸George Lowery小老板

538
00:44:07,357 --> 00:44:12,538
why even he can smell the rancid, pungent scent of sex all over you.
为什么连他能嗅出你身上散发的刺鼻的性爱恶臭！？

539
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,750
All right. Circle that and print it.
好了，把那卷到时候洗出来

540
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:17,905
Let's get this thing fixed once and for all.
一次过就好了，而且争取所有的都顺利

I'm sick and tired of it. Come on.

542
00:44:22,145 --> 00:44:24,199
Why's it making that noise?

543

544
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,308
Come in.

00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:41,417
Thought you could use a little pick-me-up.
喝点提神的吧

I can't imagine your husband will be too pleased with what just happened.
你丈夫要是知道了刚才发生的事情应该会不乐意吧

549
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,017
Well, you know.

Tony and the kids, you'd be surprised what comes out of their mouths sometimes.
Tony和孩子们，有的时候他们说的话会让你大吃一惊

551
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:58,370
That's true.
那倒是

552
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:01,890
You haven't spoken to him much about your personal life, have you?
你也不太对他聊你自己的私人生活吧？

553
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:05,475
Hitch? No, not really.
你是说希胖？是不会

554

I'd keep it that way if I were you.

555
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:14,950
Why?
怎么说？

00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:18,553
Well, it starts with him wanting to choose your hairstyle.

Then he wants to choose your clothes,

and your friends, and how many children you should have.

That's Hitch...

Only younger, slimmer and better-looking.

Oh, I don't know.

Compared to Orson Welles, he's a sweetheart.
和奥逊威尔逊比起来，希胖算好的了

快点，时间不多了

567
00:46:36,685 --> 00:46:39,139
Why does it keep burning out all the time?
这玩意儿怎么总是会烧坏？

568

- Get it fixed. What's the hold-up? - It's still engaged.
- 快点弄好。有人接么？ - 还是占线

希胖，我不看懂这第一场戏

I don't know how strongly I should confront Sam and the detective...
我不知道对抗Sam和侦探的时候应该用什么情感？

00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:53,316
Darling, just fake it. Fake it. You know how to do that. Act.

Where are my revisions?

拜托，搬个灯架真的需要两个人么

- 帮他们 - 就快好了希区柯克先生

575
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,099

Whit?
Whit？

00:47:36,826 --> 00:47:38,229
Whit?

- 希区柯克先生，拜托了，希…… - 现在不行！

Every press outlet is dying for photos.

If we could just get one photo, please!

Get off my set! I'll have security... Get off my set!
滚出我的片场！不然我就叫保安了

Hello, Hitch. How's the picture?

I'm hearing interesting things.

- 总该该给我看看一些片段吧 - 为什么？

that could cause us embarrassment.

反正我的电影不像你引以为豪的五部Martin&Lewis大电影

Oh, my God. What a tiny car.

- Oh, luckily I'm driving. - Thank God for that.
- 还好是我不是魔鬼（Drive的双关） - 谢天谢地

He's always had obsessions with his leading ladies.
他总是对他电影里的女主角有感觉

她本来要演《迷魂记》里的女主角

641
00:51:45,824 --> 00:51:50,212
Two weeks before filming she told me was pregnant.
开拍两周前她告诉我她怀孕了

642
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,393
I was going to make her into a star.
我本来可以把她捧红的

643
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:58,539
But she chose the life of a housewife instead.
但是她还是选择做家庭主妇

644
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:05,549
Why do they do it, I wonder?
我不明白女人为什么那么善变

645
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:09,174
Why do they always betray me?
为什么她们总要背叛我

646
00:52:13,696 --> 00:52:17,212
Oh, very Bohemian.
哇，很波西米亚风格嘛

647
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:20,291
I just leased it for the off season.
租这套房子无非是图个清静

648
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:24,860
A place to get away from the wife, and kids, and writing.
一个没有妻子、孩子还有写作的地方

649
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:35,324
Whit, I hope you don't have the wrong idea.
Whit，我不希望你想歪了

650
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:42,125
If you were serious about helping me adapt my book,
如果你想要认真帮我改编我的书

651
00:52:42,148 --> 00:52:45,082
I thought it might make the perfect...
我真心觉得这个地方

652
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:48,709
hideaway.
再也合适不过了

653
00:53:01,996 --> 00:53:05,272
Relax! Naughty boys, calm down.
乖大头乖

654
00:55:49,448 --> 00:55:52,195
Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you
噢，我差点忘记告诉你

655
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:55,503
I read your treatment of that story.
我了你对那个故事的改编

656
00:55:56,761 --> 00:55:59,428
Taxi to... Where was it, dear?
“去往什么的出租车”啊？

657
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:03,052
- Dubrovnik. - That's it. Dubrovnik.
- “去往Dubrovnik” - 对就是这个，Dubrovnik

658
00:56:06,457 --> 00:56:10,677
- Would you care to hear my opinion? - Well, yes, naturally.
- 你想听听我的建议么？ - 当然了当然了

659
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:14,102
Right, then.
那好

660
00:56:16,013 --> 00:56:19,578
Well, my dear, there's no other way of saying it, is there?
嗯，怎么说好呢，不过也没什么其他的表达方式了

661
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,953
It's a stillborn.
有种要死的感觉

662
00:56:26,895 --> 00:56:28,703
How so?
怎么说？

663
00:56:28,726 --> 00:56:31,289
First of all, the plot's a bit of a muddle, isn't it?
首先，剧情就有点混乱

664
00:56:32,252 --> 00:56:34,214
Some of those jokes are awfully like the ones
有些玩笑话也太像

665
00:56:34,238 --> 00:56:36,646
we did so much better hundreds of years ago
我几百年前就已经在

666
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:38,918
in The Lady Vanishes.
《贵妇失踪记》里玩烂的了

667
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:43,827
Also your villain is rather weak. Well he's very weak, in fact.
而且你们的反派也太弱了。实话说，是弱爆了

668
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:46,785
But I think the big failure
但是我觉得最大的失败就在于

669
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:52,443
is the relationship between the heroine and the hero, you see.
男女主人公之间的感情关系，你觉得呢？

670
00:56:55,352 --> 00:56:59,203
Probably if you weren't so smitten with your friend Whitfield Cook,
可能如果你没跟Whitfield Cook走那么近

671
00:56:59,226 --> 00:57:02,318
you'd be able to see that, wouldn't you?
也许你看的更清楚，不是么？

672
00:57:06,576 --> 00:57:07,668
But then I suppose
当然了，我也知道

673
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:13,345
women never really care to face the truth when their hearts are involved, do they?
女人们一但将心投入进去之后很难再让她们回头了不是么？

674
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:19,229
How would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman?
你哪知道什么男人和女人之间的事情

675
00:57:35,348 --> 00:57:38,177
My God, what a bloody mess.
我的天啊，这也太脏了

676
00:58:29,779 --> 00:58:31,494
- No! - Ah!
- 别！ - 啊！

677
00:58:31,513 --> 00:58:33,796
More! More!
强烈一点！强烈一点！

678
00:58:33,816 --> 00:58:35,960
- No! Oh! - Use some guts!
- 不要！啊！ - 再凶狠点

679
00:58:35,977 --> 00:58:37,938
- Come on! No! - Oh!
- 扎凶一点！ - 啊！

680
00:58:37,962 --> 00:58:41,043
- More anger! - Oh! Oh!
- 愤怒点 - 啊啊

681
00:58:41,066 --> 00:58:43,265
All right, cut! Cut! Cut!
别拍了

682
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:44,737
For God's sake!
我的妈呀

683
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:47,460
Will someone get me a proper stunt double?
谁能帮我找个靠谱点的凶手替身啊？

684
00:58:47,473 --> 00:58:50,091
Now give me the knife! Not yet!
把刀给我！情绪还不对！

685
00:58:52,327 --> 00:58:55,311
Ungovernable rage!
给我无法控制的情绪！

686
00:58:57,248 --> 00:59:00,388
Homicidal violence!
这是杀人狂一般的暴力！

687
00:59:23,854 --> 00:59:26,804
Cut! Cut and print!
好了。洗出来吧

688
00:59:30,649 --> 00:59:32,468
We've got it.
搞好了

689
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:57,898
Oh, not now, Ed.
Ed，这个时候别闹我

690
00:59:57,921 --> 01:00:00,997
It's really not the time.
时候不对

691
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:11,491
You just can't keep this stuff bottled up.
你根本没法平息你的怒气

692
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:29,079
Oh, God! Hitch, Hitch, you all right?
希胖，你还好么？

693
01:00:29,808 --> 01:00:32,506
- Can you hear me? - Alma...
- 你能听到我说话么？ - Alma……

694
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:39,593
What if Bridget and Constantine get into the cab at the same time?
如果让男主角和女主角在同一辆出租车里呢？

695
01:00:39,617 --> 01:00:42,658
Now what if they try and get in at exactly the same time?
那如果他们俩刚刚好同时进出租呢？

696
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:45,176
- Yes. What do you mean, "exactly"?
- 嗯，什么是“刚刚好”？

697
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,921
I mean they both reach for the cab door at exactly the same time.
我的意思是他们俩同时碰到车门

698
01:00:49,922 --> 01:00:51,587
- They quickly touch. - Yes.
- 他们瞬间触碰到对方 - 好

699
01:00:51,611 --> 01:00:55,075
We start on the hands, we pan up to the eyes, and...
镜头先是给到他们俩的手，镜头升起，到它们的眼睛

700
01:00:55,098 --> 01:00:57,897
Oh, that feels better already.
非常棒

701
01:01:00,954 --> 01:01:03,373
- Are you going to get that? - What?
- 你不接电话了么？ - 什么？

702
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:31,639
Listen, I've told Peggy
听着，我已经告诉Peggy了

703
01:01:31,663 --> 01:01:35,323
you have to get this sequence shot today.
今天要给我拍好这个长镜头

704
01:01:35,346 --> 01:01:36,579
What's the hold-up?
有什么问题？

705
01:01:36,603 --> 01:01:38,728
We tried it ten different ways and it looks terrible.
我们拍了十次，都太糟糕了

706
01:01:38,745 --> 01:01:45,483
No, it has to be a high angle. You'll tip off the big surprise.
必须得用大角度摄影，这样才能显出惊讶

707
01:01:45,508 --> 01:01:47,347
Just get the process shot.
反正就是全程摄影

708
01:01:47,675 --> 01:01:51,096
How can he hold on to the camera frame if he's waving his arms?
如果他要挥手，那到底怎么拿稳摄像机啊？

709
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:55,566
Why don't you just push all the gas from the top of the stairs?
你就把所以气体从楼梯最上面一层喷出来嘛

710
01:01:57,326 --> 01:01:58,864
No one's going to get hurt.
不会有人因此受伤的

711
01:01:58,876 --> 01:02:00,686
What bloody idiots they are.
这群笨蛋

712
01:02:01,872 --> 01:02:03,791
- What are you doing? - No more phone calls.
- 你这是干嘛？ - 不许再打电话了

713
01:02:03,815 --> 01:02:06,269
- Oh, but... - You're burning up.
- 可是 - 你不能再逼自己了

714
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:09,019
Burning off our money, that's what we're doing.
你这是在浪费我们的资金

715
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:12,095
We're two days behind and I'm stuck in this bloody bed.
进度已经延迟两天了，而我还在这儿躺着

716
01:02:12,118 --> 01:02:14,106
- Where do you think you're going? - I've got to go to the set.
- 你以为你能去哪？ - 我必须去片场

717
01:02:14,127 --> 01:02:19,071
- We can't lose another day. - You stay in bed. I'll deal with it.
- 我们不能再延迟一天啊 - 你给我躺着，我去帮你处理

718
01:02:19,094 --> 01:02:23,067
I'd hate to take you away from your writing partner.
我才不想把你从你的绯闻男友那儿拽回来

719
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:26,847
You stay under the blankets, Alfred.
你好好给我躺着，艾弗

720
01:02:32,026 --> 01:02:33,263
- Mrs. Hitchcock. - Good morning.
- 希区柯克夫人你好 - 早上好

721
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:35,285
Where's Mr. Hitchcock?
希胖大人呢

722
01:02:40,727 --> 01:02:43,193
Don't stop work because of me.
不要因为我来了你们就不工作了

723
01:02:43,216 --> 01:02:46,869
I'm only here as one of the two people paying your salaries.
我无非是管财务的

724
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:49,578
- What's the scene number? - 173.
- 拍到第几场了？ - 第173

725
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:52,444
Storyboards?
故事板在哪儿

726
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:59,097
All right. Put Martin in the chair. Turn the camera around to face him.
那好。Martin坐好在椅子上，让摄像机对着他

727
01:02:59,098 --> 01:03:02,096
We'll shoot the fall against a rear screen.
我们来拍这后银幕下的摔倒

728
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,134
And, Jack, that len should be a 35mm.
那个镜头要用35毫米的（我感觉这里英字错了）

729
01:03:07,215 --> 01:03:10,066
Now, David, you know how Paramount loves Jerry Lewis,
你看，David，你也知道我们派拉蒙确实很喜欢Jerry Lewis的风格

730
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,787
but this one is right up your alley, and I would consider...
可问题是这可是你已经驾轻就熟的题材，而且我是这样想的……

731
01:03:11,799 --> 01:03:13,607
Barney?
Barney？

732
01:03:13,618 --> 01:03:15,297
Alma!
Alma！

733
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,953
You know David Kirkpatrick.
你也认识David Kirkpatrick

734
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,156
- Hello. - Hello.
你好

735
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:20,510
He's working on Jerry Lewis developing a new picture.
他正在帮Jerry Lewis做新电影

736
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:22,878
So he's free to help if you need.
如果有用到他的地方他完全没问题

737
01:03:24,158 --> 01:03:25,520
That won't be necessary.
没这个必要了

738
01:03:25,543 --> 01:03:29,378
- But you're nearly three days behind. - Yes. Well, we can manage.
- 但是你已经落后进度三天了 - 没错，不过我们可以补救回来

739
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:32,715
Alma, we both know what kind of film this is.
Alma，我们都知道这是一部什么电影

740
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:36,066
The smart thing to do would be to help Hitch finish it.
最适当的举措就是帮希胖完成它

741
01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:37,711
Thank you for your concern, Barney.
谢谢你的关心，Barney

742
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:41,383
But on a Hitchcock picture, there is only one director.
问题是这是希区柯克电影，导演只能是希区柯克

743
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,870
No need to gawp.
都傻愣着干嘛呢

744
01:04:00,676 --> 01:04:03,276
You forgot to look in the bathroom.
你忘记去检查一下厕所

745
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:11,111
A man like you missing a vital clue like that...
一个像你这样的人，如果丢掉一条重要的线索……

746
01:04:13,455 --> 01:04:15,315
What do you mean?
你想说什么？

747
01:04:18,726 --> 01:04:21,674
My mother always said
我妈说得好

748
01:04:22,642 --> 01:04:24,986
"If you want to do a job,
“精益求精”

749
01:04:26,937 --> 01:04:28,896
do it right."

750
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,336
Check the floor.
来看一下地面

751
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:49,543
Closer.
仔细点看

752
01:05:04,913 --> 01:05:08,264
You still think they're just writing together?
你还觉得他们俩只是“在一起写作”么

753
01:05:11,628 --> 01:05:14,257
What are you gonna do about it?
你下一步应该怎么做？

754
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:32,402
Oh, Mrs. Hitchcock.
希区柯克夫人！

755
01:05:33,441 --> 01:05:37,051
I know Hitch isn't feeling very well, so I got him a little something.
我知道希胖最近身体抱恙，所以我给他准备了点东西

756
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,918
Oh, how kind. Thank you very much.
你人太好了，谢谢你

757
01:05:40,699 --> 01:05:42,732
Candy corn.
糖玉米

758
01:05:42,756 --> 01:05:45,644
Well, he's always been very considerate of me.
他一直很照顾我

759
01:05:45,668 --> 01:05:48,024
I haven't always had that from my directors.
其他导演一般都没这么贴心

760
01:05:50,114 --> 01:05:53,310
Janet, I'd just like to say that
Janet，我想说

761
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,920
you've been very professional.
以表现的非常敬业

762
01:05:58,179 --> 01:06:00,520
It hasn't gone unappreciated.
效果也非常好

763
01:06:01,766 --> 01:06:03,359
Thank you.
谢谢

764
01:06:03,382 --> 01:06:05,662
- Lovely seeing you. - You, too.
- 见到你还是很高兴的 - 我也是

765
01:06:25,753 --> 01:06:27,867
May I turn it down?
请问我能关小声点么？

766
01:06:35,931 --> 01:06:39,691
Well you'll be pleased to know that order has been restored.
你应该会很高兴我们片场的话事权已经捍卫下来了

767
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:43,622
And a "thank you" would be nice.
你总可以说句“谢谢”吧

768
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:47,170
We're still two days behind and $60,000 over budget.
可我们还是落后了两天，超支了六万

769
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:50,442
Yes, well I'll cancel the wrap party. That'll save us $2000 right there.
那咱们就不开庆功宴了，这下就多了两千块

770
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:54,626
And you won't be tempted by any champagne and cake.
正好你也不用馋着要香槟和蛋糕了

771
01:06:54,627 --> 01:06:57,730
Beware, all men are potential murderers.
你小心点，狗急了会跳墙的

772
01:06:59,622 --> 01:07:01,786
And for good reason.
而且还有正当理由

773
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,610
All right, what's this all about?
够了！你到底在生气什么？

774
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,902
Spending a lot of time at the beach?
去海滩这件事你怎么解释？

775
01:07:23,555 --> 01:07:27,701
Yes. Yes, it's where Whit and I are writing. He's rented a place.
没错，海滩上Whit租了座房子，我们俩一起写作

776
01:07:27,702 --> 01:07:31,235
Hardly the ideal situation to avoid distractions.
我想不会是个集中注意力写作的好地方吧

777
01:07:31,236 --> 01:07:34,388
Actually, it's very conducive to creative collaboration.
实际上，这对两个人合作非常有帮助

778
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,890
I've already told you that treatment is a waste of time.
我已经告诉你了，修改它是浪费时间

779
01:07:36,913 --> 01:07:39,795
Well, didn't they say the same thing about Psycho?
你对《惊魂记》不也是这么说的么？

780
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,205
Are you and Whit having an affair?
你和Whit在恋爱么？

781
01:07:55,198 --> 01:07:57,347
Oh, don't be absurd.
别想太多了

782
01:07:57,371 --> 01:08:01,609
He's working on something new. He just needs a little help, that's all.
他在捣鼓些新的作品，他无非是想要点帮忙

783
01:08:01,632 --> 01:08:04,455
Oh, what a coincidence. I'm working on something new
那太巧了，我也在捣鼓新作品

784
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,041
and I could use a little help, too!
我也想要点帮忙

785
01:08:06,064 --> 01:08:07,411
Well, what do you think I've been doing?
你以为我之前在干嘛？

786
01:08:07,422 --> 01:08:09,465
Why are you spending all the hours of day and night with that
告诉我你为什么要和那个毫无才华的小屁孩

787
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:12,125
talentless mummy's boy?
花上一整天时间？

788
01:08:13,118 --> 01:08:14,585
Because it's fun!
因为那会让我比较开心

789
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:17,658
I am under extraordinary pressures on this picture,
这部电影让我倍感压力

790
01:08:17,682 --> 01:08:21,640
and the least you could do is give me your full support.
至少你也应该全力支持我

791
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:24,857
Full support?
“全力支持”？

792
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:27,286
We've mortgaged our house.
我们连房子都抵押了！

793
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,333
Might I remind you
让我提醒你一下

794
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:33,062
I have weighed in on every aspect of this film so far,
我在这电影里参与了每一个部分

795
01:08:33,086 --> 01:08:36,835
as I have done on every film you've made in the last three decades.
如同我在过去三十年你的每一部电影里的付出

796
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:40,595
First time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want.
首映完了之后，我给你你想要的想法

797
01:08:40,618 --> 01:08:42,837
I celebrate with you when the reviews are good.
评论大好是我陪你庆祝

798
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,468
I cry for you when they are bad.
评论差了我为你哭泣

799
01:08:44,491 --> 01:08:48,002
I host your parties and I put up with those fantasy romances
我主持你的派对，还要容忍你和你的那些女主角们的

800
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:50,346
with your leading ladies.
奇妙关系

801
01:08:50,347 --> 01:08:52,623
And when you're out promoting this film around the world,
然后还有当你到世界各地宣传你的电影

802
01:08:52,624 --> 01:08:55,031
I will be there beside you, or rather, slightly behind you,
我要么一直陪伴着你，或者在你身后

803
01:08:55,054 --> 01:08:59,396
smiling endlessly for the press even though I'm ready to drop,
对媒体摆着笑容，哪怕我都快要流泪了

804
01:08:59,419 --> 01:09:03,095
and being gracious to people who look through me as if I were invisible
还要对那些当我不存在的人假装和善

805
01:09:03,096 --> 01:09:05,399
or elbow me aside because all they can see
而且他们还把我推到一边，因为他们眼里只有

806
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,326
is the great and glorious genius Alfred Hitchcock!
伟大和荣耀的阿弗莱德・希区柯克

807
01:09:09,348 --> 01:09:13,366
And now, for the first time in years,
然而现在，这几年我第一次斗胆

808
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:17,517
I dare to work on something that isn't an Alfred Hitchcock production
去做些“希区柯克电影”以外的作品

809
01:09:17,518 --> 01:09:20,835
and I'm met with accusation and criticisms?
却要遭到指控和非议？

810
01:09:22,379 --> 01:09:26,429
The work I am doing with Whit gives me pleasure and purpose,
我和Whit一起创作的作品让我愉快和有目标

811
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:30,000
and it takes absolutely nothing away from you.
而且我不从你这索取任何东西

812
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:35,664
Consider this a reminder: I am your wife, Alma Reville.
你给我记住了：我是你老婆，Alma Reville

813
01:09:35,687 --> 01:09:38,550
Not one of those contract blondes you badger
不是你合约下纠缠不清的妞

814
01:09:38,573 --> 01:09:41,732
and torment with your oh-so-specific directions.
也不是受控你“特别”导演法的玩偶

815
01:10:15,998 --> 01:10:17,681
Well...
嗯

816
01:10:17,694 --> 01:10:19,812
I guess this is goodbye.
我想也该说再见了

817
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:25,632
Why didn't you stay with me?
你为什么不和我合作了

818
01:10:27,308 --> 01:10:31,617
I would have made you as big a star as Grace Kelly.
我可以把你捧得像Grace Kelly那样红的

819
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:38,999
Well, unlike Grace Kelly, I can pick my own dry cleaning.
要是像她，我连自己去洗衣店都不行

820
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:42,286
I've got a family, Hitch. A home.
我有一个家庭，希胖，一个家

821
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:49,187
That blonde woman of mystery you're always after?
那个你一直想塑造的“金发女郎”形象

822
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,159
She's a fantasy.
那只是一个梦

823
01:10:51,183 --> 01:10:52,852
She doesn't exist.
是不存在的

824
01:10:54,523 --> 01:10:57,871
There was a time when I thought I understood you.
我曾经以为我已经理解你了

825
01:10:59,404 --> 01:11:01,687
Understood women.
理解所有的女人了

826
01:11:53,172 --> 01:11:56,318
Alma, I thought you were coming later this afternoon.
Alma，我以为你下午会晚点来

827
01:11:56,342 --> 01:11:58,091
I thought you rented this place so we could write.
我以为你租这房子是为了写作

828
01:11:58,115 --> 01:11:59,841
I did.
还是啊

829
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:05,542
- You're not going to say anything, are you? - Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.
- 你不会对谁说吧 - 不要怕，我不会告诉Elizabeth的

830
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:08,094
I mean to Hitch.
我指的是对Hitch

831
01:12:09,415 --> 01:12:14,699
Alma, we can't all be geniuses.
Alma，我们不可能全是天才

832
01:12:14,723 --> 01:12:16,801
You're incredibly talented.
只有你的才华如此

833
01:12:16,824 --> 01:12:19,917
But, after all, we want him to read the script with an open mind.
不过到最后，我们还是希望他能够有一个更宽容地看这个剧本

834
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,197
Don't we?
我们？

835
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,766
I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.
我不会再操心这件事了

836
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:32,307
Sheriff, please, I'm worried.
警长大人，我担心的是

837
01:12:32,331 --> 01:12:35,419
Arbogast said he'd call as soon as he spoke with Mrs. Bates.
Arbogast说他跟Bates夫人说了后会给我们打电话

838
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:37,485
That was yesterday evening.
那已经是昨天晚上了

839
01:12:37,509 --> 01:12:41,546
- Norman isn't married. - He said it was his mother.
- Norman可没有结婚 - 他说那是他的母亲

840
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:45,366
Your detective saw Norman's mother up at the motel?
你雇的侦探说他在汽车旅店里看到Norman的母亲？

841
01:12:45,389 --> 01:12:47,139
In the upstairs window.
而且她在二楼的窗户旁

842
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,582
He rang me right after she called out to him.
他从母亲那儿回来后就马上打电话给我了

843
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:53,740
Missy, I think your detective must be a few cups in.
小姐，我想你的侦探是喝多了吧

844
01:12:53,764 --> 01:13:00,024
Mrs. Bates died of strychnine poisoning more than ten years ago.
Bates夫人十多年前就已经死于士的宁中毒了

845
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:03,488
- Are you sure? - That body was...
- 你说的是真的么？ - 夫人当时的尸体……

846
01:13:09,984 --> 01:13:13,307
This is my favorite place.
这是我最喜欢的地方

847
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:18,987
I just shut the door and make the world go away.
我只需要把门关上就可以让整个世界和我无关

848
01:13:19,844 --> 01:13:23,419
Don't you ever get lonely out here?
在这儿你从来都不孤独的么？

849
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,989
I can always talk to my mother.
我可以和我妈说话

850
01:13:39,769 --> 01:13:42,528
That's strange.
奇怪

851
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:45,823
Jesus Christ. I think we found his hiding place.
我的天啊，我想我们发现了他藏身之处

852
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:54,747
That's my mother's room.
那是我妈的房间

853
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,565
That's my mother's room.

854
01:14:04,365 --> 01:14:06,719
You can't go in there!
你们不能进去！

855
01:14:06,737 --> 01:14:08,778
Don't go in my mother's room!
不许进！

856
01:14:22,854 --> 01:14:25,203
Hitch?
希胖！

857
01:14:25,226 --> 01:14:27,152
Hitch?
希胖

858
01:14:28,244 --> 01:14:30,645
So what's the verdict?
审核如何？

859
01:14:30,669 --> 01:14:34,755
Let's just say it was a four-letter review and it wasn't "good."
他们只有一个字，这个字跟“好”没关系

860
01:14:37,212 --> 01:14:38,550
Screw him.
管他的

861
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:42,082
It's too late for Paramount to back out, no matter what Balaban says.
管他Balaban说什么，派拉蒙这个时候已经没退路了

862
01:14:44,191 --> 01:14:49,009
The other route is to re-cut it as a two-parter for the TV series.
还有一条路，就是重新剪成两集投放到电视

863
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:51,299
Because of the budget and the Hitchcock name,
顾及到预算还有希区柯克的金字招牌

864
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:53,401
we stand a good chance of breaking even.
这是一个收回成本的好办法

865
01:14:55,667 --> 01:15:00,324
Look, I made Jimmy Stewart a millionaire on Winchester 73,
我用《百战宝枪》让Jimmy Stewart成为百万富翁

866
01:15:00,347 --> 01:15:01,744
and that was a dog.
而且那电影还不怎么地

867
01:15:01,768 --> 01:15:04,676
At least I could sit through your picture.
这部电影我起码看完了

868
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:10,982
More importantly, what does Alma think?
不过更重要的，还是要先听听Alma的意见

869
01:15:35,383 --> 01:15:37,250
I was afraid you'd try to blame yourself.
我害怕你会责怪你自己

870
01:15:37,274 --> 01:15:38,577
I'm not talking of blame.
我不是责怪

871
01:15:38,589 --> 01:15:41,031
Leigh, how can you make plans if you're still not sure?
Leigh，你怎么能在你还没想清楚时就做决定

872
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,751
Whit must've enjoyed writing for Colbert.
Whit能为Colbert写戏应该很开心吧

873
01:16:10,393 --> 01:16:12,960
How was the beach?
海滩那儿如何？

874
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:17,004
Cold and miserable.
冷得慎人

875
01:16:18,609 --> 01:16:22,281
Just like Barney Balaban's face.
就像咱老板的脸

876
01:16:26,592 --> 01:16:28,848
Poor old Whit.
可怜的Whit啊

877
01:16:30,469 --> 01:16:34,336
He isn't worth a damn when he's not working with you.
他不跟你合作，一分钱不值！

878
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,487
Neither am I.
我也是一样

879
01:16:47,724 --> 01:16:51,994
I couldn't pull off the picture this time.
我没法继续完成电影

880
01:16:52,018 --> 01:16:55,570
It just sits there,
它就在那儿

881
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:58,192
refusing to come to life.
不愿意出来见人

882
01:17:02,323 --> 01:17:05,717
I guess there's no other way of saying it, is there?
我想也没有别的词形容了

883
01:17:08,011 --> 01:17:10,344
It's stillborn.
跟Whit的剧本一样

884
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,028
I let you down, my love.
我让你失望了，亲爱的

885
01:17:24,124 --> 01:17:26,923
You deserve better.
你不该遭遇这些

886
01:17:34,271 --> 01:17:36,473
Better go feed Geoffrey and Stanley.
我该去喂喂大头们了

887
01:17:38,131 --> 01:17:40,400
Come on, boys.
大头来吃东西咯！

888
01:18:59,695 --> 01:19:02,705
I don't think I can stand us both being maudlin.
我还是觉得就一个人哭哭啼啼的就好了

889
01:19:03,798 --> 01:19:09,192
That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation I've been helping Whit finish is done.
那个模仿希区柯克风格的烂剧本我再也不帮忙了

890
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,957
You know there's only one solution to all this.
你知道现在只有一条路

891
01:19:14,981 --> 01:19:17,458
That we get back to work together.
我们一起工作

892
01:19:18,472 --> 01:19:21,537
The fact is I rather like living in this house.
实话是，我还是想住在这间房子里

893
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,430
So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we start whipping Psycho into shape.
所以我建议，对你我都好，我们开始搞好《惊魂记》

894
01:19:28,356 --> 01:19:30,706
You may not be the easiest man to live with,
你也许不是生活在一起最轻松的男人

895
01:19:30,717 --> 01:19:33,908
but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone else.
但是你比任何人都知道如何剪辑一部好电影

896
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:40,852
Except for you.
除了你

897
01:19:43,244 --> 01:19:46,015
The second take. The light is much better on the hands.
第二个镜头手上的亮度要更好

898
01:19:50,089 --> 01:19:53,182
Only cut back to Janet once the car's already moving.
汽车发动了画面就停留在Janet上

899
01:19:53,194 --> 01:19:54,967
Cut it tighter.
节奏快点

900
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:01,365
Ooh, you imp, you got nudity in there!
希胖你的坏蛋，你居然拍了裸体

901
01:20:01,388 --> 01:20:06,457
Her breasts were rather large. It was a challenge not to show them.
她胸部太大了，镜头躲不开

902
01:20:06,481 --> 01:20:08,221
You'll have to cut those six or seven frames
你必须得剪掉这六七格

903
01:20:08,232 --> 01:20:10,474
where she blinks after she's supposed to be dead.
她死了怎么可能还眨眼睛

904
01:20:10,492 --> 01:20:13,863
Alma, we've viewed the film a thousand times.

905
01:20:13,874 --> 01:20:15,671
She does not blink.

- 里面进展怎么样？ - 特别顺利

907
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:24,145
Everyone's saying it's like a dog with fleas.
所有人都说这电影就像一只满是跳蚤的狗

908
01:20:25,177 --> 01:20:27,220
No, absolutely not!
不行，绝对不行

909
01:20:27,231 --> 01:20:30,449
I do not want music over the show murder scene.
我不想让谋杀戏有背景音乐

910
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,820
But what Alma and I talked about is really going to play.
但是Alma和我已经商量好了应该要放

911
01:20:32,838 --> 01:20:36,324
Bernie, this is not Vertigo. It's not a romantic movie.
Bernie，这不是《迷魂记》，不是浪漫爱情电影

912
01:20:36,339 --> 01:20:38,121
The images must work on their own.
画面要让画面自己说话

913
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,481
Yes, but you can't scare people just by going, "Boo!"
没错，但是光靠“咚”一声是吓不了观众的

914
01:20:40,492 --> 01:20:42,500
All right, you do it then. You know best.
好啊，有种你放啊，你最懂了

915
01:20:42,524 --> 01:20:44,212
- They have to anticipate it. - You always know best, just do it!
- 音乐必须参与叙事 - 你放啊，你放啊

916
01:20:44,235 --> 01:20:45,752
Take a step back.
你必须退一步

917
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:04,037
- What do you think? - I think I'll never have a shower again.
- 你怎么想？ - 我觉得我再也不敢洗澡了

918
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:09,571
- Hitch? - It's getting there.
- 希胖呢？ - 漂亮

919
01:21:13,496 --> 01:21:16,953
I distinctly saw both the stabbing and the nudity.
我清楚地看到了刀扎和裸露的画面

920
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:21,658
What you think you're seeing is purely informed by the power of suggestion.
你以为你看到了，事实上不过是画面的暗示

921
01:21:21,673 --> 01:21:24,785
I assure you once you view the final version

with Mr. Herrmann's lovely, lyrical score...
配上Herrmann写的动听的旋律

923
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:31,512
A lyrical score is not going to change my opinion.
动听的旋律是不会改变我的观点

924
01:21:32,698 --> 01:21:35,621
We're denying your seal.
我们不会允许你上映

925
01:21:36,526 --> 01:21:39,903
Geoffrey, would you mind if we had a word in private, please?
Geoffrey，让我们俩单独聊聊

926
01:21:46,411 --> 01:21:48,257
Thank you.
谢谢

927
01:21:54,455 --> 01:21:56,508
Now look here.
你听好

928
01:21:56,531 --> 01:21:59,666
I have a modest proposal to make.
我有一个最谨慎的建议

929
01:21:59,678 --> 01:22:03,013
If you're willing to leave the shower sequence as it is,
如果你同意保留洗澡的镜头

930
01:22:03,036 --> 01:22:08,415
I will re-shoot the opening love scene to your exact specifications.
我们会按照你的规格重新拍一遍开场的情爱戏

932
01:22:17,445 --> 01:22:19,558
To my specifications?
按照我的规格？

933
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:22,376
But of course, my dear fellow.
不过当然了，我亲爱的你

934
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,277
If only audiences could fully comprehend

935
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:28,729
how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them

936
01:22:28,753 --> 01:22:32,882
while protecting them from filth and indecency.
同时还要不让他们看到脏东西

937

He's been harassing you since you announced this project,
从电影准备开始他就一直干扰你

938
01:22:42,154 --> 01:22:44,550
you invite him to the set, and he doesn't even show up?
你都邀请他来片场了，他还不来

939
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:46,228
What did you tell him?

940

That I respected him deeply.
我说我十分尊重他的工作

杀青了各位，非常感谢大家

942
01:23:01,655 --> 01:23:05,107
- I thought we were re-shooting the scene. - The charade is over.
- 我以为我们要重新拍这一幕 - 不过是一个伪装

943
01:23:05,131 --> 01:23:06,907
Thank you.
谢谢你

944
01:23:12,926 --> 01:23:16,578
See, I wasn't that much of a monster to work with, was I?
我也不是不能合作的嘛？

945
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:18,280
Not at all.
完全不会

946
01:23:18,304 --> 01:23:21,257
I hope I was sufficiently loyal to the cause.
我希望我没给这添什么麻烦

947
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:24,183
Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear.

948
01:23:46,485 --> 01:23:48,058
I hope you don't mind,

949
01:23:48,082 --> 01:23:51,423
I told Mrs. Bates she could use your dressing room.

951

Yes, thank you.

953
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:10,897
We have the seal from the Shurlock Office.

954
01:24:10,922 --> 01:24:13,987
So now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter.

如同我们所预料的一般，而且没有首映礼

957

We don't get word of mouth, we're dead.
没有口碑，没有前途

958
01:24:25,287 --> 01:24:28,422
Then we'd better get started. Peggy, take a memo.
那我们还是赶快开始工作吧。Peggy，记下来

如此，如果有人还想从侧门、防火通道或是天窗

我等你说这句话等了三十年
