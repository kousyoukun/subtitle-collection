1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,560
In the summer of 1953...

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,560
it was announced that an atomic bomb
of foreign origin...

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,160
had been exploded somewhere
outside of the United States.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,640
Shortly thereafter, it was indicated
that this atomic reaction...

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,560
according
to scientific reports...

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,320
had originated in a remote area
in North Pacific waters...

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,240
somewhere between the northern tip
of theJapanese islands...

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,200
and the arctic circle.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,640
This is the story
of that explosion.

10
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
Oh!

11
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,240
Professor Montel.
I'm McCleary of the Herald Tribune.

12
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,200
Oh, yes.
How do you do?

13
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,640
I understand that you're going to Vienna
to address the, uh...

14
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
Central European Federation
of Advanced Scientists.

15
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
That is correct.

16
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,760
I will read a paper on the emission of neutrons
and collision of nuclei.

17
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,680
Thank you,
Professor.

18
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,560
- Will any of the American Atomic Energy Commission be present?
- I doubt it.

19
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,480
Will you excuse me,
gentlemen?

20
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,040
Oui.

21
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,720
Uh, Professor. Excuse me.
There's one or two points I'd like to get clarified.

22
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
You will have to excuse me, gentlemen.
The plane is waiting.

23
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,200
Who's the girl?

24
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,280
This is the BBC with the latest news bulletin.

25
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,280
Professor Montel, famous nuclear physicist
and atomic scientist...

26
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,400
has vanished while en route to attend
a conference in Vienna.

27
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,880
Professor Montel's disappearance
is a complete mystery to the police.

28
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,280
Authoritative sources reveal today
that the former Nobel Prize winner...

29
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,280
is the fifth noted scientist believed to have
vanished behind the iron curtain.

30
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,760
Professor Montel was last seen
at the International Airport in Vienna.

31
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,000
Speculation as to the whereabouts...

32
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,200
of Professor Montel continues.

33
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,440
Ten days have elapsed
since the distinguished scientist vanished...

34
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,960
and so far police have been unable to offer
any explanation.

35
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,120
Authorities are now convinced...

36
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,720
that Professor Montel
was not kidnapped...

37
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,440
and that his disappearance
was part of a prearranged plan.

38
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,400
Airport officials in Vienna
reveal that the scientist...

39
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,880
carried a diplomatic passport.

40
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,640
The search for Professor Montel
continues into the fourth week.

41
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,720
It is interesting to note that while
the story has been given front-page space...

42
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,880
in newspapers in the United States
and all other parts of the free world...

43
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,720
Pravda, the official mouthpiece
of the Soviet Union...

44
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,920
has, as yet, failed
to take note on it.

45
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
- Corporal Lee Stockwell?
- Right.

46
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,840
- Mr. R.J. MacDougall?
- That's right.

47
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,720
- Mr. Franklin Meredith.
- That's correct.

48
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
Jones!

49
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
My name's MacDougall.

50
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,920
You're a dead ringer for an officer
I used to know in the submarine service.

51
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,840
Sorry.

52
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,680
Mr. MacDougall?

53
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,600
Yeah.

54
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,600
My name is Eddy.

55
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,160
Your instructions.

56
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,760
There is a taxi waiting for you.
The driver knows the address.

57
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,000
Taxi number 63.

58
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,120
Number 63.

59
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,040
Okay.

60
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,880
This is it.

61
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,800
- You better wait for me.
- No, I go now.

62
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,640
Wait a minute. What if I need you again?
Where can I find you?

63
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,640
- What's your name?
- Eddy.

64
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,680
Mr. MacDougall?

65
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,480
- Yeah.
- Come in, please, and follow me.

66
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,760
Watch your step, please.

67
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,040
- Now don't tell me your name is Eddy too.
- "Eddy" is the password.

68
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm Hokada Fujimori,
CommanderJones.

69
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,120
I'm very pleased
to meet you.

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,920
Thanks. For a minute there, I thought this was
something out of Inner Sanctum.

71
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Ah, you've lost
a little weight.

72
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm on a diet.

73
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,640
I'll bet Captain Taylor put a little fat on, huh?

74
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
- Where is he?
- I'm sorry to tell you, your friend is dead.

75
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,600
- Dead?
- His plane crashed returning from an arctic expedition.

76
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,560
No one survived.

77
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,000
He never did like to fly.

78
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,440
Why did he want me to come here?
What was the 5,000 for?

79
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,600
It's an advance payment for a job
Captain Taylor was certain you would do for us.

80
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,560
- Advance?
- Yes.

81
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,520
- When do I start?
- Without questions?

82
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,360
Why talk? IfTaylor
lined me up for the job, it must be kosher.

83
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,040
Some people might not
exactly call it kosher. In here, please.

84
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,240
Gentlemen,
CommanderJones.

85
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,240
- Mr. McAuliff.
- How do you do, sir?

86
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,160
- Colonel Schuman.
- How are you?

87
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,360
- Mr. Aylesworth.
- How do you do?

88
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,760
And Professor Montel.

89
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,960
- Montel, the scientist?
- Yes.

90
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,840
Everybody and his brother
is gunning for you, Professor.

91
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,120
They say you skipped
behind the iron curtain.

92
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,920
As you can see,
only a wooden door.

93
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,160
- Glad you're here.
- Thank you, sir.

94
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,320
Well, it's quite a layout
you got here.

95
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,080
What kind of business
are you gentlemen in?

96
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,400
The business
of investigation.

97
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,840
The scientific
investigation...

98
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,800
of these uninhabited North Pacific islands
that lie in neutral waters...

99
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,720
- between the free world and the iron curtain.
- Uh-huh.

100
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,160
Our deductions make us believe
that one of these islands-

101
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,520
we don't know which one,
Mr. Jones-

102
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,600
has been prepared
as an arsenal for atomic weapons.

103
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
Your friend
Captain Taylor volunteered...

104
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,000
to undertake a photographic mission
to find out.

105
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,920
- Volunteered?
- Yes.

106
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,840
- For free?
- For free.

107
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,800
Is that when he had
the accident?

108
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,040
It was no accident.
His plane was shot down.

109
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,280
This photograph
we have just printed...

110
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,520
came from the camera
of his salvaged plane.

111
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Thirty years in the navy,
and he gets killed for a picture.

112
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,920
For free.

113
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Each man has his own
reason for living, Mr. Jones...

114
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,520
and his own price
for dying.

115
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,960
This was
Captain Taylor's price.

116
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,960
There's nothing there, Professor.
It's a washout.

117
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
I wouldn't be too certain.
Extend these lines.

118
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,480
They could be atomic vault
constructions.

119
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,240
And over here could also be part
of a concrete runway.

120
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,080
Look. Look, before
we go any further...

121
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,640
exactly what country
do you men represent?

122
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,600
We represent
many countries...

123
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,600
as private individuals.

124
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,600
We are scientists,
former statesmen, businessmen-

125
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
all volunteers
acting independently...

126
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,960
for a common cause
against a common enemy.

127
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,920
As private
individuals...

128
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,080
we can conduct this investigation
on a scientific basis...

129
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,200
without violating
any neutral waters.

130
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,840
And if what we suspect
is verified...

131
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,080
we can then make
our findings public.

132
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,880
And what good
will that do?

133
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,200
Don't you think the truth
is worth knowing?

134
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,200
Don't you believe that
factual proof will establish, once and for all...

135
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,200
both the identity and the intention
of the aggressor?

136
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,880
Who knows?
But where do I fit in to the picture?

137
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,800
We want you to command a ship
for an inspection tour of these islands.

138
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,080
- What kind of a ship?
- A submarine.

139
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,800
We know that four times
during World War II...

140
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,520
you commanded a submarine
reconnaissance patrol...

141
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,520
in this very area.

142
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,120
As I recall, you were
extremely successful in these waters...

143
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,040
when you fought
my country.

144
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,960
This time the enemy is different, Mr. Jones,
but the waters are the same.

145
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,400
You received already
$5,000.

146
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,360
20,000 in United States
currency...

147
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,240
will be deposited to your account
in any bank you elect...

148
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,880
to chauffeur Professor Montel
to this island.

149
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,280
And another 25,000 bonus
when you bring him back safely...

150
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,720
with all the information
he seeks.

151
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,560
What about the sub?
Did it volunteer too?

152
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,840
One does not pick up a first-class submarine
in the junkyard, Mr. Jones.

153
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,880
We have salvaged
a Japanese submarine.

154
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,800
- What class?
- I-203.

155
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Sewer pipe. Had one on my tail once
for six hours. Taylor look her over?

156
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,800
- Yes.
- Start getting her refitted?

157
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,720
- Yes.
- Armed?

158
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,840
Mr. Jones, the object
of this mission...

159
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,640
is scientific investigation,
not combat.

160
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,760
Professor...

161
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,720
am I in command?

162
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,760
- That's right.
- Then we arm the sub.

163
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,840
That is, if you want me
to get you back in one piece.

164
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,120
Did you also
salvage a crew?

165
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,040
We have picked volunteers-
experienced men.

166
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,160
There will be
two scientists on board.

167
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,800
Professor Montel
and his assistant, Professor Gerard.

168
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,360
We aren't positive
which island it is...

169
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,480
but a certain freighter,
the Kiang Ching...

170
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,520
has been up to this area
several times before...

171
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,360
with cargos of concrete
and heavy metals.

172
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,760
She's loading again
at Tientsin.

173
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,400
The last time I tailed a freighter,
my price was 650 a month...

174
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,360
and I had to buy
my own uniforms.

175
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,400
All right. I want my own key men-
men who've served with me before.

176
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
You name them,
and we'll get them.

177
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,040
Like you got me, huh?
For cash.

178
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,000
If it's necessary.

179
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,200
As I said before,
Mr. Jones...

180
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,920
each man has
his own reason for living...

181
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,200
and his own price
for dying.

182
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,520
I hope, for all of us...

183
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,360
that it will be
a bon voyage.

184
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,680
Giovane.!
Help him with the line.

185
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,160
Giovane.! You! You, Carpino,
give him a hand with the torpedo.

186
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,320
How many hands
you think I got, Neuman?

187
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,880
Mr. Neuman to you.

188
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,360
- Now, make sure you give me the reading on that battery.
- Right, Skipper.

189
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,400
Come on. Come on.!

190
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,240
Bring it on, boys.
Bring it around! Come on!

191
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,920
Hey! Come on now.
Easy now. Come on.

192
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,240
Come on. Come on.
All right, hold.

193
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,080
All right, boys.
Make it fast to the cleats.

194
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,120
Hey.

195
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,920
- Don't you ever take a bath?
- Ah, shut up.

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,760
"Ah, shut up. "
Is that the extent of your vocabulary?

197
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,200
What'd you ever give up
the wrestling racket for anyway?

198
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,160
I just found out
it was phony.

199
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,120
That's the trouble with these- I say, that's the
trouble with these phony wrestlers, Dugboat.

200
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,560
- They never take a bath.
- We do too.

201
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,800
Hey, Joto. Hey, Joto.
The after valve won't turn.

202
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
- What?
- The after valve won't turn.

203
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
No, no. The other way.

204
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
Everything backwards. No wonder
you blokes lost the war, subs like this.

205
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,120
- Skipper.
- Yeah.

206
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,960
- That guy Welles- any good?
- Best engineer out of Australia.

207
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,120
- Wish we had Wilbur.
- Yeah.

208
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,960
With Charlie Wilbur handling the engines
on the Bowfin...

209
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,880
there was nothing
to worry about.

210
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,520
Hear he's
a three-striper now.

211
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,440
Yeah, so I hear.

212
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,880
Skipper, that number two scopes
don't work.

213
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,360
- What's the matter with it?
- Can't get the rust out of it.

214
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,320
- How 'bout number one?
- Didn't check it.

215
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,320
Lift her up, Holter.

216
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,960
The professor topside
wants to see the captain.

217
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,880
Send him down.

218
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,320
He's part of the brass
behind this setup.

219
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,920
Now, if he looks familiar,
don't say anything. I'll explain later.

220
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,040
- Hello, Professor. Welcome aboard, sir.
- Captain.

221
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,560
Well, we're trying to put
this sewer pipe together...

222
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,040
with a little spit
and a lot of sweat.

223
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,520
- I guess we'll make it all right.
- Captain Jones.

224
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,960
What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?

225
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,160
I'm sorry to say we cannot permit
one of your crew to make this expedition.

226
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,360
What do you mean?
They were all handpicked.

227
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,280
- We cannot trust this one.
- Who?

228
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,160
The torpedo man,
Revnik.

229
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,080
Oh, one of the men
you picked.

230
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,480
I could have told you that
all the time. A knothead.

231
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,520
Did you screen
all my men too?

232
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,880
Very closely,
including you.

233
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,560
- Okay. I'll get rid of Revnik right away.
- Good.

234
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,520
Holter, I want-

235
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,840
She the replacement, Doc?

236
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,280
Gentlemen, this is Professor Gerard,
my assistant and my right arm.

237
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,280
- Hiya.
- Denise, this is Captain Jones.

238
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,080
- Captain Jones.
- Glad to know you, Professor.

239
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,320
Well, if I'd known about this,
I'd have cut my price.

240
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
Boys, these two professors
are going with us as cargo.

241
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,120
- What?
- You heard me.

242
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,120
Have you blown a gasket?
Nobody takes a female along in a pigboat.

243
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,720
Look, junior, you gonna give me that
2,000-year-old navy bilge that they're bad luck?

244
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,320
Take a look at her.
What's so bad about that?

245
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,480
Nothin'.
Absolutely nothin'!

246
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Ah, they're allJonahs.
It's traditional.

247
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,240
Look, Skipper, I made up my mind.
Count me out.

248
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

249
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,920
Anybody else?

250
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll give you jokers five minutes
to sleep on it, and remember...

251
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,080
if I have to,
I can replace every one of you.

252
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,640
Captain, I do not
like it either.

253
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,240
Oh, excuse me.

254
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,240
Perhaps you are right.

255
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,120
In your estimation,
I am a- a female.

256
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,000
But first I am a scientist...
and a good one.

257
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,560
And I am not the only scientist
who is not of your sex.

258
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,600
There are many.

259
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,760
Like Dr. Lise Meitner...

260
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,800
who played an important part
in the development of the atom bomb.

261
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,240
Like Madame Curie,
who discovered radium.

262
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,600
I have grown up
in laboratories.

263
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,320
All my life,
I've worked with men.

264
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,960
Never have I
interfered...

265
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
and never have they
resented me.

266
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,280
Professor Montel and I have-
have much to accomplish.

267
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,800
Much.

268
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,400
And I shall
appreciate it...

269
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,960
if you would not let
my- my presence...

270
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,920
be the cause of-
of a minor mutiny.

271
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,960
I like you.

272
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,800
I like you all.

273
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,240
And I shall try my best
to make you like me...

274
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,200
as a scientist.

275
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,600
Man, that was quite a mouthful
for a female!

276
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,160
That's no female. That's a scientist!

277
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,440
All right. Come on.
We got a lot of work to do. Let's go.

278
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,120
Hi, Mr. Fujimori,
Professor.

279
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,960
- Where's your assistant?
- Are you prepared to sail?

280
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,760
I'll let you know tomorrow
after we make the running dive tests.

281
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,680
There's no tomorrow
left for us.

282
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,120
The freighter Kiang Ching
sailed from Tientsin a half hour ago.

283
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,440
- You must leave right away.
- What are you talking about?

284
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,560
We only been working for two weeks.
We've got a lot of work left to do on this tub.

285
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,640
- You must leave by dark to overtake her.
- What about the running tests?

286
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,040
As an amateur, might I suggest
that we try the running test...

287
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,960
while we are running?

288
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,720
Doc, there are about a hundred ways
of losing a submarine.

289
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,720
You've just come up
with one of the best.

290
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,680
We haven't even checked
the torpedo tubes yet.

291
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,200
You know what that means if we have to
call on fish? It means we're dead.

292
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,160
You've got to
leave tonight.

293
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,520
Okay, buster, you're buying this trip.
You want me to chance it?

294
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,320
It's not what we want, Captain Jones.
It's what must be done.

295
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,840
All right. Just as long as the professor here
knows what he's letting himself in for.

296
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,440
We've arranged airplane contact to give you
position on the Kiang Ching.

297
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,200
- How'll they contact us, blinker or radio?
- Neither is without risk.

298
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,160
We've decided
cork drop is safest.

299
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,760
This contains your code...

300
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,280
and this contains
your schedule for contacts.

301
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,600
Oh, just one more thing.

302
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,880
I want a clear-cut directive detailing
my specific authority.

303
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,240
You'll find it all
in here, Captain.

304
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,560
At sea, you are
in complete command.

305
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,080
On land, Professor Montel
is in command.

306
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,440
May I wish you
the best of luck?

307
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,360
Thanks.

308
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,120
Well, now's as good a time
as any, Mr. Neuman.

309
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,000
- Take her down to periscope depth.
- Yes, sir.

310
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,960
Clear the bridge!

311
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,160
Dive!

312
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,640
Stand right over there,
you'll be all right.

313
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,120
- Thank you.
- Professor Gerard, give me your hand.

314
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Watch that top rung.
It's murder.

315
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,120
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,040
You sit right... here.

317
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,000
Captain, trim satisfactory
at periscope depth.

318
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,960
- Very well. Joto.
- Yes, sir?

319
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,600
Give Welles a hand with those starboard
engine blueprint translations, will you?

320
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,520
I'll take care of it,
Captain.

321
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,680
Everything's tight
in the forward torpedo room.

322
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,720
We're gonna try her down deep.
Have all stations checked. Let me know.

323
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,000
Aye, aye, Captain.

324
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,320
This is that test we were talking about
today, Professor.

325
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,880
- Now?
- Now.

326
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,480
Don't get nervous. If we crack up,
you won't get a chance to feel it.

327
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,400
Take it easy.
It'll be all right.

328
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,360
Put her on the bottom,
Mr. Neuman.

329
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
Two degrees
down bubble.

330
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,040
- Flood negative.
- Flood negative.

331
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,400
Oh, thanks, Chin Lee.

332
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,360
- Coffee, Professor?
- No, thanks.

333
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,840
- How 'bout you?
- No, thank you.

334
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,920
Two hundred feet,
Kapitän.

335
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,240
Better hold on,
Professor.

336
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,280
All right. Now let's see if we
can hit the roof.

337
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,040
- Take her up, Mr. Neuman.
- Close all main ballast vents.

338
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,200
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface.

339
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,200
- Surface.
- Surface.

340
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,480
- Blow all main ballasts!
- Blow all main ballasts.

341
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,680
What's with the air banks,
Holter?

342
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,960
- The air bank's dry.
- Open the emergency banks. Put 'em on the line.

343
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,320
- They won't open.
- They've got to open. We've checked everything.

344
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,160
- These signs are all fouled up. I'll have to try every valve.
- Now, wait a minute.

345
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,800
Joto, come to the control room.
Unsnarl theseJapanese signs.

346
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,160
I can translate it. That one reads,
"Open emergency air bank. "

347
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,440
- What?
- "Open emergency air bank. "

348
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,640
Go ahead. Try it.

349
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,120
- Air bank's on the line.
- Good. Thanks.

350
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,080
Okay. Put her
on the roof.

351
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,480
- Skipper.
- Yeah. Everything all right, Carpino?

352
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,240
Just a few leaks around the stuffing glands.
I marked them.

353
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,160
Okay. Make
a full sweep, Ski.

354
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,120
All clear, Skipper.

355
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,640
Rig for red.
Up scope.

356
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,560
You better move out,
Professor.

357
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,840
This helps get our eyes used to the dark
when we go up.

358
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,440
Open the hatch, Holter.

359
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,840
You did a good job
translating that sign, Doc.

360
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,920
Professor Gerard
is M.O.L.

361
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,200
- M.O.L.?
- Master of Oriental Languages.

362
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,560
Oh?
Très bon. Très bon.

363
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,480
Down scope.

364
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,200
Glad to have you aboard,
Professor.

365
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,560
Glad to be aboard,
Captain.

366
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,640
Captain. The professor wants to know
if it's all right to come up for fresh air.

367
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,080
- Which one?
- The one with the beard.

368
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,200
Oh. Okay.

369
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,160
Come to course 355,
ahead full on both engines.

370
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,560
Aye, aye, Captain.

371
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,480
You won't need your umbrella, Professor.
She's a dry boat.

372
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,680
It's nothing
to worry about.

373
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,480
Almost everybody gets a touch
of claustrophobia first time down.

374
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,920
It's not claustrophobia,
Captain.

375
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,400
It's the realization
that, at last...

376
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,040
our mission has begun.

377
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,720
If anyone had told me
six months ago...

378
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,040
that today I would be on a submarine
headed for arctic waters...

379
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,680
in search of
a secret atomic base-

380
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,160
- I just can't believe it.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

381
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,600
Well, uh...

382
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,280
what about your assistant,
Professor?

383
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,040
What makes a girl who looks like that
get mixed up in science?

384
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,800
She comes from
a family of scientists.

385
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
She was a child prodigy.

386
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,040
At 14,
she entered college.

387
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,200
At 18, she studied
at Göttingen.

388
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,200
She is really
very brilliant.

389
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,360
A child prodigy
with a body by Fisher, huh?

390
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,680
And this is the greatest pigboat
in the whole submarine service.

391
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,000
The U.S.S. Bowfin.

392
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,200
It's one we served on
together-

393
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,520
me, the chief, Gunner,
Dugboat and the skipper.

394
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,920
Beautiful, ain't she?

395
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,320
Oh, yes.
Very beautiful.

396
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,240
You know something else
that's very beautiful?

397
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,960
All my life I've been
wanting to find a girl called Denise.

398
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Oh, Ski, I'm sure you will find her.

399
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Oh, I found her,
all right.

400
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,760
You see, I lost no time at all
in learning your first name.

401
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,080
Yep. Denise.
It's always been my favorite name.

402
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,040
I- I never met
a Denise...

403
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,000
but I always knew I would.

404
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,160
You see, from the moment
I saw you, I said, "Lafayette, I'm here. "

405
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,640
That's right. I always knew
I'd meet a girl called Denise.

406
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,560
D- E-N-I-

407
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,520
Don't let him
kid you, honey.

408
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,440
I just seen him
put your name on his arm.

409
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,880
- Look.
- All right, bub. You asked for it!

410
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,920
No!

411
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,000
Come here,
you big drunkard!

412
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,400
That's what I mean byJonahs.
They were beefing over the dame.

413
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,720
Wasn't her fault.
He's stiff.

414
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,760
- She okay?
- Yeah.

415
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,720
Just roughed up
a little.

416
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,720
Take care of him,
Holter.

417
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,160
Oh, here,
let me help you, Professor.

418
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,240
- Thank you.
- Let's see.

419
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,600
Boy.

420
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,360
I'm really very sorry
about this, Professor.

421
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,840
That drunk was
a last-minute replacement.

422
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,120
- He's all right when he's sober.
- I'm sorry.

423
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,760
This is the last thing
I- I wanted to happen.

424
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,440
It had to break out sooner or later.
Let's have another look here.

425
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,440
Whew! It's lucky you
still got your teeth.

426
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,200
Don't get nervous, Doc.
Nobody's gonna bite you.

427
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,680
Don't you think that the pharmacist
should treat me, if it's necessary?

428
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,240
He's got his hands full
with those two lugs.

429
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,640
Besides, there's nothing
he can do that I can't, you know.

430
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,080
Oh, my. He got you
so greasy.

431
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,920
Okay.

432
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,920
You know what a log is?

433
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,240
- Yes.
- You do, huh?

434
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,400
Well, I'm supposed to keep a detailed report
of everything that happens.

435
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,720
- It's for Mr. Fujimori.
- Mm-hmm.

436
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,480
How'd it start?

437
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,840
I was working
on a new formula...

438
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,320
when Ski asked if he
could show me his chest.

439
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,320
- Show you his chest?
- Yes.

440
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,720
Oh.

441
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,680
And then what?

442
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,920
Then he removed
his shirt.

443
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,880
No kidding.

444
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,040
- He wanted me to see his tattoo.
- Oh, no.

445
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,040
- It was a beautiful tattoo.
- I'll bet it was.

446
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,960
- Beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

447
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,120
- But the intoxicated one rubbed it off.
- Naturally.

448
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,080
Tell me, uh,
he make a pass at you?

449
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,640
- A pass?
- Did he try to kiss you?

450
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,280
Yes, he did.

451
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,200
He did, huh?
Did you coldcock him?

452
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,880
- What?
- Did you hit him?

453
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,160
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

454
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,560
Hold the phone. Hold the phone.
Now, say that in English.

455
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,520
- I slapped him.
- You did, huh?

456
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,680
Uh, tell me, uh...

457
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,880
you hit him after
he kissed you?

458
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,680
- Yes.
- Not before, huh?

459
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,640
I do not understand.

460
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Well, you see, Professor, I-I just want
to make sure my report is factual.

461
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,960
- I-I couldn't put-
- Captain Jones.

462
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,720
Is this report for Mr. Fujimori...
or for you?

463
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,160
- Uh-
- Mmm.

464
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Now, really, a child prodigy oughta
be able to figure that one out.

465
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
Don't you think?

466
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

467
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,440
Au revoir, Professor.

468
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,960
Now listen to me.

469
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,880
I don't want any more beefs,
you understand?

470
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,360
If I hear of anybody
making a play for that girl...

471
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,680
I'll personally shoot him out through
torpedo tube number one.

472
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,800
Captain, is it still a secret
where we're goin'?

473
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,720
We're tailin' a freighter
to an island in the North Pacific.

474
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,640
Gonna sink her?

475
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,400
We're gonna sneak into this island,
take a look and sneak out.

476
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,320
This is a scientific
expedition.

477
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,120
- But, Skipper, what are we lookin' for?
- Four-leaf clovers.

478
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,920
Well, what if the guys on
the island don't like us?

479
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,160
Look, I know you're all
itchin' for a little action...

480
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,520
but you'll only get it if we
have to defend ourselves, so relax.

481
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,680
CapitaineJones?

482
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,120
Le CapitaineJones.

483
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,400
- Mm-hmm.
- Bonne nuit.

484
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,320
Bonne nuit.

485
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,360
Oh, good morning!

486
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,120
- Was the water hot enough, Professor?
- Just wonderful, thank you.

487
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,600
- Voulez-vous "fume"une cigarette?
- What?

488
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,600
- I'm speaking French.
- Oh.

489
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,880
Voulez-vous "fume"
une cigarette?

490
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,400
Oh, you mean
"Voulez-vous fumer une cigarette?"

491
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,800
- That's what I said.
- No. Fumer.

492
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,320
- Foo-may.
- No, no, no.

493
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,760
You have to form
your lips like this.

494
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,400
Fumer.

495
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,920
Fumer.

496
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
I think I better go now.

497
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,480
Thank you.

498
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,160
You know, someday I'm gonna
find out what color her eyes are.

499
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,160
Good morning, Captain Jones.
You wanted to see me?

500
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,040
Why did you let me sleep
through that plane contact?

501
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,680
I thought you needed the rest.
You were on duty for almost 20 hours.

502
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,680
Didn't you stop to think how important
that message might be?

503
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,640
Of course.

504
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,880
So I made sure
that it was not...

505
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,400
by decoding it myself.

506
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,640
As you see,
it reports only...

507
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,160
that the Kiang Ching has made
no change in speed or course.

508
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,280
I knew that was
of no importance.

509
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,760
Professor, did it ever
occur to you...

510
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,200
that I might be steering
a course to be-

511
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,840
You've lost us
approximately two hours!

512
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,400
I'm very sorry,
Captain.

513
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,520
- And I think I have learned something.
- I hope so.

514
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,360
If you want to listen in
on conversations, use the intercom.

515
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,640
- It's easier.
- That conversation I would prefer not to have heard.

516
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,880
- But I was waiting to see you.
- Okay, you see me. I'm busy.

517
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,440
Many years have I been
with Professor Montel...

518
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,920
but never before have I heard anyone
speak like you...

519
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,880
to the greatest
scientist in his field.

520
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,600
Professor Montel's field isn't commanding
a screwball submarine. Mine is.

521
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,600
If such rudeness
is necessary...

522
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,560
I hope this will be
a very short cruise.

523
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,720
What'd you want to see me about?

524
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,400
- Joto.
- Yes, sir?

525
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,320
In the future, when a message comes in
to this boat, I get it...

526
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,960
no matter who says it's unnecessary,
you understand?

527
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,880
Yes, sir.

528
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

529
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,000
No, no, no, no.

530
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,360
This time, he was right.

531
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,280
May we come
on the bridge?

532
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,240
Sure. Help yourself.

533
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,200
Contact plane
approaching on schedule!

534
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,120
Good enough.

535
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,920
Okay, Charlie.

536
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,240
There it is!

537
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,840
Well, this one's
for you, Doc.

538
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,760
"Intelligence reports Kiang Ching
carrying unconventional-type...

539
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,680
61-J capsule. "

540
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,440
Signed, "Fujimori. "
What's a 61-J capsule?

541
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,440
The charge to explode
an A-bomb.

542
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,080
Hey, Skipper.
Radar shows surface object approaching...

543
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,000
bearing 355 degrees.

544
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,960
- Speed?
- Can't tell yet, but he's closing fast.

545
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,560
- Range.
- 3,800 yards.

546
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,320
- Maybe the freighter has seen our signal and comes after us.
- Rig for red.

547
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
A sub's after us.

548
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,200
A sub? I thought this was
a scientific expedition.

549
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,240
It is, and we're
gonna play it safe.

550
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,520
No use getting a bloody nose
unless we have to.

551
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,960
She's submerged
and listening for us.

552
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,280
- That's why she stopped pinging.
- What does this mean?

553
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,680
It means she's saving her torpedoes,
waiting till we surface.

554
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,600
Just one more day, Doc...

555
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,520
and we'd have finished
overhauling those torpedo tubes.

556
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,680
Can you see her scope?

557
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,000
No.

558
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,120
Well, we can
play possum too.

559
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,600
- How's the hydrogen?
- Built up to three percent.

560
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,360
Well, we can't chance surfacing here.
We've got to make a run for it.

561
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,760
Professor, I think
you'd both better stay in your quarters.

562
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,680
Down scope.

563
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,040
They're still
on our stern, Skipper.

564
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,160
- How's that hydrogen gas?
- Four percent, and still building.

565
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,800
Take her up!

566
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,920
Okay, Charlie.

567
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,760
You better keep off
the bridge, Professor.

568
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,680
I'm not going up.

569
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,360
The skipper'd blow his top if he even
found you here in the control room.

570
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,320
- Sit down, Professor. Grab some air.
- Thank you.

571
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,240
Have you identified
the submarine?

572
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,880
No. We haven't even
seen her yet.

573
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,640
They're topside
trying to spot her now.

574
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,360
No sign of her yet,
Skipper.

575
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Sonar tells us she's not far.
Alert the gun crew.

576
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,320
- What?
- I know. We're not lookin' for trouble.

577
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,800
But we'd be fools
not to protect ourselves.

578
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,760
Alert for
battle stations!

579
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,720
Gun crew stand by to man the deck gun.

580
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,280
What about
these torpedoes?

581
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,400
You know those tubes haven't been checked.
Forget the torpedoes!

582
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,520
- Where is she now, Joto?
- Range, 1,500.

583
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,960
Either she's moving out,
or she's gonna surface.

584
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,440
There she is,
Skipper!

585
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,040
They're coming out
on deck.

586
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,040
Ask them where we are,
Charlie.

587
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,280
- Why not man the five-incher now?
- No!

588
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,160
The minute they spot a crew near that gun,
they'll throw torpedoes at us.

589
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,720
- What are they saying?
- They want to know who we are and what we're doing here.

590
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,720
Tell 'em we're a private scientific expedition
headed for the Arctic.

591
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,920
They insist
on boarding us.

592
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,360
Well, keep stallin'.
Tell 'em we don't understand.

593
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,720
Ask them to repeat
the message.

594
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,000
Put one over our bow.
Keep asking them to repeat, Charlie.

595
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,080
Turn our nose into her.
Steer 001.

596
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,000
And get ready
to man that gun.

597
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,200
Keep clear
of the lifeline!

598
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,320
Right full rudder.

599
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,000
Torpedo!

600
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,120
Clear the deck!
Clear the deck!

601
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,880
Dive!

602
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,280
Close the hatch!

603
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,920
My hand! My hand!

604
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,720
My hand!

605
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,720
- Give me a knife!
- No.! No.! No.!

606
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,880
- My hand!
- No!

607
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,280
Here.

608
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,960
- How is he? How is he?
- It's his thumb.

609
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,400
All right.
Get 'em all below.

610
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,640
Hey, you guys! Come on up here!
Give me a hand, quick!

611
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,440
We ship too much water.
Can't hold her up.

612
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,240
- Get the angle off and let her settle to the bottom.
- All back full.

613
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,320
Enemy torpedo fired.

614
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,040
Number two fish out of their basket.

615
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,920
Secure all running machinery.
Remain silent.

616
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,040
Bilge pump motor's flooded, Skipper.

617
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,560
Form a bucket line.
Dump the water in the engine room bilges.

618
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,600
That tub's laying for us, Skipper.
She's coming real close.

619
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,800
I lost her.

620
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,040
Nothing out of her now.
No sound.

621
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,640
What do you think,
Skipper?

622
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,880
I think she's pulling
the same trick we are.

623
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,560
Now watch that salt water.
We don't want any chlorine gas in the boat.

624
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,920
Hold it.

625
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,840
Captain, this hot heat
is killing us.

626
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,760
We got to turn on
the fans.

627
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,440
If they heard our fans, you wouldn't
have to worry about the heat killing you, boy.

628
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,480
All right, I'll fill in
the picture for you quick.

629
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,960
We got torpedoes, but our tubes
aren't in condition to fire 'em.

630
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,680
And the Red sub's parked on the bottom
like we are, waitin' to pick us up on sonar.

631
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,600
Once she does,
she'll throw more fish at us.

632
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,480
So it's a question of who can
hold out longer without air- the Reds or us.

633
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,080
If we break first, chances are it'll be
our last break.

634
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,400
And we're
loaded with hydrogen.

635
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,840
We're liable to explode.

636
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,520
But we got one thing
in our favor.

637
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,240
We can save oxygen
by shutting up.

638
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,640
That's all.

639
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,000
Nothin', huh?

640
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,800
Nothin'.

641
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,840
We gotta save juice.

642
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,600
Shift to red.

643
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,040
Keep your ears open, Ski.

644
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,920
I am sorry, Captain,
for being so stupid.

645
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,400
That's all right.
Save your breath.

646
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,360
You had to use
the knife.

647
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,880
If you didn't close the hatch,
we would all be dead.

648
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,960
You're beat.

649
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,800
You better get back to
your bunk and take it easy. Come on.

650
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,720
- I want to tell you how-
- Shh.

651
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,680
Don't talk.

652
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,560
Skipper.

653
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,840
He's in a bad way.

654
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,240
I thought that hypo was gonna do the trick,
but he's sufferin' from shock and loss of blood.

655
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,360
If he don't get some air right away,
you're gonna have only one professor for cargo.

656
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,760
There's 50 grand
in that bunk.

657
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,760
Fifty grand is worth
a little air.

658
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,040
Joto, turn on
the white lights.

659
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,600
Boys, I'm gonna try
a long shot.

660
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,280
If her first couple of torpedoes
miss us, we got a chance.

661
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,920
I'd rather pass out without air than have
a torpedo come plowing through us.

662
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,920
Now when we start the pump,
we're liable to get a spark.

663
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,800
Maybe it'll burn off
the hydrogen, maybe it won't.

664
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,440
If it doesn't...

665
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,760
we'll blow up so fast
you'll never feel it.

666
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,120
Good luck
to all of us.

667
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,280
- You got everything straight?
- Yes, sir.

668
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,320
Now here's where we find out
if we've lived right.

669
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,880
No more chance of explosion.
Pass the word along.

670
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,800
And build up
the turns slowly.

671
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,760
- Hold down the noise.
- Yes, sir.

672
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,920
- All ahead one-third.
- Yes, sir.

673
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,280
- Take her up and level her to 175 feet, Mr. Neuman.
- Yes, sir.

674
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,840
She's speeded up, Skipper.

675
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,840
Bearing 240 degrees.

676
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,760
Right full rudder!
All ahead flank!

677
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,400
- Stand by to ram!
- Stand by to ram!

678
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,160
Range 200,
bearing 010 degrees.

679
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,800
Left full rudder!
Take her down to 190 feet.

680
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,760
- 190 feet.
- Stand by to ram!

681
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,040
All back, emergency!
Blow all main ballasts!

682
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,400
Captain!

683
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,080
Captain!

684
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,360
There you are.
Are you sure you're all right, Doc?

685
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,000
- Yes, thank you.
- All right.

686
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,720
Now take a good deep
breath of fresh air.

687
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,760
Feel all right, Dugboat?

688
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,200
Yeah. For a quiet scientific expedition,
I couldn't feel better.

689
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,720
You look awful.
Let me see your tongue.

690
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,080
It all real cool, man.

691
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,480
This are the end, Jackson.

692
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,000
I'm learning French. You know,
like Chin Lee learned that American song.

693
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,000
You're wasting
your time, junior.

694
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,280
- Hi.
- Hello.

695
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,320
Say, uh, if that music disturbs you,
I could have it turned off.

696
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,440
Oh, no.
I- I love music.

697
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,840
- Oh. That?
- Mm-hmm.

698
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,920
Well, how's the hand,
Professor?

699
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,880
Wonderful, Captain,
as you see.

700
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,280
- Good. Glad to hear it. And how are you, Professor?
- I'm fine, thank you.

701
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,760
- Swell. You know, uh, when I-
- Captain Jones.!

702
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,760
- Come topside, please. Freighter in sight of land.
- Excuse me.

703
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,680
Bonne chance.

704
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,240
I don't understand.

705
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,560
Our intelligence report
cannot be this wrong.

706
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,040
All we are getting is a normal count.

707
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,200
- You ought to be happy.
- Don't misunderstand.

708
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,280
Nothing would please me more
than to know that our suspicions are unfounded.

709
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,200
Then let's move out.

710
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,560
There's nothin' here but this two-bit garrison
and some beat-up storage tanks.

711
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,440
It's a great pity
I cannot talk to them.

712
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,600
We are worlds apart.
But, after all, they are human.

713
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,240
- Let's go.
- But Neuman.

714
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,240
Forget it.
Shot right through the head.

715
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,520
Let's get out of here.

716
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,240
Ski, try to knock out that light.!

717
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,400
All right, come on!
Let's get outta here!

718
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,600
You yellow dogs!

719
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,760
Come on, Ski. Give me a hand.
Let's get him in the boat.

720
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,640
You wanted to talk to one
of these "humans. " I got one for you.

721
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,000
Wet down your coats.

722
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,360
Well, they must be combing
the whole area for us...

723
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,840
but so far, nothin', huh?

724
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,760
Not even a seagull.

725
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,880
Hey, Dugboat, you sure this jelly I'm rubbin'
on my chest won't eat off my tattoo?

726
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,960
What are you worried about?
You can always get another.

727
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,760
Are you nuts? That's my
"piece de resistance. "

728
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,920
- Your piece de what?
- That's French.

729
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,840
I been practicing,
"nessie-pas?"

730
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,200
You need more practice.

731
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,960
Captain Jones.
Professor Montel wants to see you in sick bay.

732
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,040
- Want more coffee?
- No. No, thank you, Chin Lee. Thank you.

733
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,080
This is wonderful.

734
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,400
- You want to see me, Professor?
- Yes.

735
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,600
Denise has just
translated his orders.

736
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:31,640
His name is Ho Sin. He's a pilot en route
to Kevlock Island for special duty.

737
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,920
- So what?
- Kevlock must be the island Captain Taylor photographed.

738
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,840
Well, how do you
figure that?

739
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,640
An air force pilot would hardly be assigned
to duty on an island without an airstrip.

740
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:46,560
And as you know, Kevlock is the only island
indicated by name in this entire chain.

741
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,880
It appears to be due north
of our present position.

742
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,760
And what do you suggest
we do about it?

743
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,520
It seems to me
our course is obvious.

744
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,800
- Not in my book, Doc.
- What do you mean?

745
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,200
I mean you said once that each man's got
his own reason for living...

746
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,680
and his own price
for dying.

747
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,800
Well, my reason for living
is 50 grand.

748
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,720
I'm not sticking
my neck out again.

749
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,280
- Is one neck that important, Captain?
- It is when it's mine.

750
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,320
What kind of man are you?

751
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,280
Hold it. Hold it.

752
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:20,320
Let's not gang up
with a lot of double-talk.

753
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,280
I'm a businessman.

754
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,120
Maybe to a couple of flag-wavers like you
I'm a mercenary. All right.

755
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,960
But I lived up to my part
of the contract.

756
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,120
The deal was to tail
the freighter to the island...

757
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,120
put you ashore
and get you back to Tokyo.

758
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,120
Nobody said anything
about a second island.

759
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,800
So as far as I'm concerned,
mission completed. We're going home.

760
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,720
Any objections?

761
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,320
Yes.

762
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,120
I hate to use authority...

763
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,640
but if I have to, I will.

764
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,720
I didn't want it
to come to this...

765
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,520
but as long as you have
mentioned the contract...

766
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,480
study it closely, Captain.

767
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,720
You will find a paragraph
stating that I...

768
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,960
and I alone...

769
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,320
shall determine when
the mission is finished.

770
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,440
And in my book, Captain...

771
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,800
the mission will be finished
after I am taken to Kevlock...

772
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,680
given the chance
to examine the island...

773
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,680
and returned to Tokyo.

774
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,720
- Joto.
- Yes, sir.

775
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,720
- Head due north.
- Did you say north?

776
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,240
You heard me.
Set a new course for Kevlock Island.

777
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,160
- It's on your chart.
- Yes, sir.

778
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,760
Okay, Doc, let's go.

779
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,920
What's the matter?

780
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,840
My knee.

781
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,400
- I thought you said it was okay this morning.
- It was.

782
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,400
- I'll manage in a few moments.
- Not a chance. You'd just be in the way.

783
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,840
- It will improve by tomorrow. I'm sure of it.
- Sorry, Doc.

784
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,720
We're not hanging around these waters
that long. This is a powder keg.

785
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,360
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What's going on? What are you talking about?

786
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,800
Captain Jones...

787
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,920
my assistant
will accompany you.

788
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,080
- What?
- She has sufficient training to compute figures...

789
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,840
determine strength
and identify elements...

790
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,800
if there are any
on this island.

791
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,720
You mean you'd-
you'd let her go?

792
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,520
With the exception of me, Professor Gerard
is the only member of this expedition...

793
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,520
capable of performing
this task.

794
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,440
Oh, you're both crazy.

795
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,400
You will take her ashore...

796
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,400
and follow her instructions
as you would have followed mine.

797
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,840
She is not going,
and that's final.

798
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,240
You still cannot take an order,
can you, Captain Jones?

799
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,160
And what's behind that crack?

800
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,080
Exactly what you think
is behind it.

801
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,440
Ski, you stay here.
Keep your eyes open.

802
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,360
What about her?
I could carry her equipment.

803
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,440
She can take care
of her own equipment.

804
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,640
Psst!

805
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,160
Take a look down there.

806
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,200
Looks like
a bunch of doors.

807
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,760
I'm afraid we have found
what we are looking for.

808
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,800
A Geiger counter reaction like
this can mean only one thing.

809
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,600
These figures-

810
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,000
What are they saying?

811
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:22,600
They are looking for Lumfong,
a missing soldier.

812
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,480
We gotta stay put
till they move out. Come on.

813
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,080
What did you mean when you said
I still can't take an order?

814
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,040
Your record, Captain.

815
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,040
In the war you were a very good officer,
except for one thing.

816
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,720
Go on. I'm fascinated.

817
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,240
You could give orders,
but you couldn't take them.

818
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,440
Now look, I-

819
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,400
I know what you're
talking about.

820
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,640
But if you want to know what makes a guy tick,
you've got to look beyond the record.

821
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,880
Those Philippine guerrillas
were cut off and surrounded.

822
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,000
They had to have ammunition
and supplies.

823
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,960
I couldn't just sit there
on my can and let 'em die.

824
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:27,160
I knew the waters were mined, but I figured
I could get in, get out without a scratch.

825
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,120
So I wrote my own orders.

826
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,080
I lost my sub and 26 men.

827
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,160
And if I had to,
I'd do it again.

828
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,760
I'm sorry...

829
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,720
very sorry.

830
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,600
It was wrong of me
even to mention it.

831
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,200
Forget it.
It's all over.

832
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,800
- You all right?
- Fine.

833
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,400
When this is over,
if we get back...

834
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,320
what gives with you?

835
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,760
- Gives?
- I mean, what're you gonna do?

836
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,600
Go back to Paris,
I suppose, huh?

837
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,840
- Paris is my home.
- Yeah.

838
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,960
And you?

839
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,920
When this is over,
what gives with you?

840
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,880
I don't know.

841
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,880
Have you ever
been in Paris?

842
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,880
No, never.

843
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,400
You would love it.

844
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,680
Americans always do.

845
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,080
Well, we can't stay here.

846
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:17,160
If they hold us up till morning,
we might never get back.

847
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,480
I'm gonna see if there's
another way out of here. Come on.

848
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,160
You stay here.
I'll be right back.

849
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,960
Here.

850
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:43,400
You won't need this, but sometimes
the sight of it's a comfort.

851
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,400
I'll be back
in a minute.

852
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,080
Lumfong?

853
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,920
Lumfong!

854
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,800
Denise!

855
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,120
Give me the gun. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

856
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:57,080
Come on.

857
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,800
Hurry up.
Come on.

858
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,840
Come on.

859
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,760
Let's go.

860
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,200
This confirms
our worst fears.

861
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,600
The atomic reaction
is unmistakable.

862
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,520
I don't get it.

863
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,800
I mean, I can't figure out why
that bomber was on the runway.

864
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,560
What would a B-29 be doin'
on a Red air base?

865
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,440
It just doesn't make sense.

866
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,600
Say, didn't you tell me that
that Red officer...

867
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,880
- we picked up on the other island was in the air force?
- Yes. A major.

868
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,840
- Were you ever able to question him?
- Impossible.

869
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,440
- I tried, but he would not say a word.
- Oh.

870
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,360
Oh, thanks.

871
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,520
Hey, did you talk to that
Chinese prisoner, Chin Lee?

872
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,720
He has not
seen the prisoner.

873
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,480
The prisoner
has not seen him.

874
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,880
Holter, dig up that portable microphone
and plant it in the torpedo room.

875
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,160
Then get the prisoner and lock him in there.
Make sure he doesn't see the microphone.

876
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,080
- Right.
- Give him a hand, Ski.

877
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,680
Come on. Let's get into some dry clothes.
We got work to do.

878
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,560
- You have a plan?
- I'm gonna find out what this is all about.

879
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,120
Come on, Chin Lee.
We got a job for you. Let's go.

880
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,400
- You guys got everything set?
- Yep.

881
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,320
Okay.

882
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,560
Now, you're sure Chin Lee understands
exactly what he's supposed to say, huh?

883
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:17,360
- What'd he say?
- He says he would do anything for you.

884
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,960
He wants you to strike him
in the face...

885
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,920
to make it look more real.

886
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,400
Holter.

887
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,520
He wants you to do it.

888
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,920
He says it will not hurt
if you do it.

889
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,680
You all right, boy?
You okay?

890
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:55,920
What's he sayin'?

891
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,240
He says...

892
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,440
the prisoner is very intelligent
and must be fooled.

893
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,000
He wants you
to hit him... harder.

894
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,360
I'm sorry, pal.

895
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,560
All right, get him out.
Let's go.

896
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,680
Here. Come on. Take 'em.

897
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,760
This is incredible.

898
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,240
What's it
all about, Skipper?

899
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:16,160
This is the screwball plot
of all time.

900
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:20,440
They're gonna drop an atomic bomb
on Korea or Manchuria and blame it on us.

901
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,920
They're taking off tomorrow at
dawn in that made-over bomber.

902
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,200
He found him out!

903
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,520
Now listen to me.

904
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,320
I'm shoving off
for the island alone.

905
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:43,080
I'll park myself right here,
around the mouth of this cave.

906
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,280
You'll submerge half a mile
beyond the runway, right around here...

907
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,080
so you'll be able
to spot my signal.

908
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:52,480
Now a heavy load of fuel's
gonna bring that bomber out low.

909
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,920
So when I give you the signal-
two short, two long, two short-

910
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,960
that'll mean
the plane's taking off.

911
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:01,280
That'll give you just time
enough to surface and fire.

912
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,960
I want every gun in action.

913
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,320
That means everybody.

914
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:11,920
That plane has to be
knocked out of the sky.

915
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,040
Now the minute you hit it,
crash dive to the bottom and stay there...

916
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:18,760
because everything's gonna break loose
when that bomber hits.

917
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:22,080
There's a cove at the north end, right here.
That's where I'll hide.

918
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,560
Tomorrow night at 10:00 sharp,
I'll give you three short blinkers.

919
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,480
Pick me up.

920
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,560
If I don't show up,
shove off, head for home.

921
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,840
Any questions?

922
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,120
I forbid this insanity.

923
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:40,160
Forbid all you want to, Professor.
That plane is not gonna make it.

924
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,080
It is dreadful enough
to bring back the terrifying report...

925
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,160
that our suspicions
are confirmed.

926
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:50,560
But we cannot take it upon ourselves
to commit an act of war...

927
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,880
no matter how we feel.

928
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,360
We are civilians!

929
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,400
I am responsible
for this expedition.

930
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:01,440
I order you to take this submarine
back to Tokyo!

931
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,360
I don't care about you
and your expedition.

932
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,120
There's an enemy bomber out there made up
to look like an American bomber.

933
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:09,680
It's gonna drop the biggest egg in history,
and we're gonna take the rap for it.

934
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,920
I don't like that.

935
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,120
So from now on, Professor...

936
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,440
this is my expedition.

937
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,440
Skipper.!

938
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,360
The boat's gone!

939
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,520
- What?
- The boat's gone. Montel took it.

940
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,120
- Well, why didn't you stop him?
- We didn't get the chance.

941
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:40,280
He was on deck with her.
Before we knew, he was in the boat and gone.

942
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,200
- Where's the girl?
- On the bridge.

943
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,880
Please. He doesn't
want you to stop him.

944
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,280
Why didn't you stop him?
All you had to do was yell.

945
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,080
He knows your plan.
He'll carry it out. That's his orders.

946
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,560
That's the trouble with you geniuses-
full of big ideas.

947
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,560
Now you're fouling up
the whole works.

948
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,840
- You know that island's crawling with soldiers.
- He knows that too.

949
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:06,600
Then why'd you let a nice old guy like that
take a shortcut to the cemetery?

950
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,640
He's no ordinary
two-bit professor, you know.

951
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,720
He's Montel,
top man in his field.

952
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,600
But he's old and helpless-
doesn't know his way outside of a test tube.

953
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,640
You oughta know that.
You work close enough with him.

954
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,560
- What kind of a woman are you?
- Stop!

955
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,480
- Haven't you got any feelings?
- Stop!

956
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,440
He's my father.

957
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:25,080
What?

958
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,360
My father.

959
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,360
Oh, I'm sorry, Denise.

960
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,400
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.

961
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:38,840
He said...
it was his place to go...

962
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,720
not yours.

963
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,080
I'm sorry.

964
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,040
She's sure
got a lot of guts.

965
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,440
Only thing I can't figure
out is why the big mystery?

966
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,520
Why didn't she let us know
he's her old man?

967
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,640
Well, that's what you have to pay
for having a famous father.

968
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:08,160
She's been on a spot
all her life.

969
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,640
Wanted to make good
on her own, and she did.

970
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,880
And he was proud
because she did.

971
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,200
Any sign of him at all?

972
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,280
No, not yet.

973
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,520
There he is.

974
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,840
And there's his signal.

975
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,760
Battle surface! Gun action! Down scope!

976
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,720
- You'd better get below.
- Please.

977
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,760
Okay.

978
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,480
All right, Ski.
Let's go.

979
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,680
Come on, Willie.
Joto, get up here.

980
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,520
Hurry it up.
Hurry it up.

981
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,400
Fire!

982
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,680
You all right?

983
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:57,280
- Oh.
- The bomb must have gone off under us.

984
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,240
Bring her
back on course.

985
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,160
Take her up
to periscope depth.

986
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,120
Periscope depth.

987
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,800
All compartments,
report damage and casualties.

988
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,200
The bomber didn't crash
in the ocean.

989
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,760
It hit the island.

990
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,400
Head for home.

991
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,200
Each man has his own reason for living, Mr. Jones...

992
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:42,600
and his own
price for dying.
