公元7.953年夏天，有消息说，一颗外国制造的原子弹在美国境外的某个地方爆炸了。
In the summer of 7.953, it was announced that an atomic bomb of foreign on'g/'n had been exploded somewhere outside of the United States.

2
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:32,658
不久以后，有人指出，根据科学的报告，这种原子反应起源于非太平洋水域的一个偏远地区，
Shortly thereafter, it was indicated that this atomic reaction, according to scientific repon's, had originated in a remote area in non'h pacific waters,

3
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:37,746
位于日本群岛北部和北极圈之间的某个地方。
somewhere between the northern tio of the Japanese islands and the arctic circle.

4
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,332
下面是关于那次爆炸的报道。
This is the story of that explosion.

5
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,510
哦!
Oh!

6
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,474
蒙特尔教授。我是先驱论坛报的麦卡利。
Professor montel. I'm mccleary of the herald tribune.

7
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,476
哦,是的。你好!
Oh, yes. How do you do?

8
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,482
我知道你要去维也纳向中欧高级科学家联盟发表演讲。
I understand that you're going to Vienna to address the, uh, central European federation of advanced scientists.

9
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,192
这是正确的。
That is correct.

10
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,487
我会读一篇关于中子发射和原子核碰撞的论文。
I will read a paper on the emission of neutrons and collision of nuclei.

11
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,989
谢谢您,教授。
Thank you, professor.

12
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,259
美国原子能委员会的成员会出席吗?
Will any of the American atomic energy commission be present?

13
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,534
我对此表示怀疑。
I doubt it.

14
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,792
失陪一下，先生们?
Will you excuse me, gentlemen?

15
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,273
是的。
Oui.

16
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,201
教授。原谅我。
Professor. Excuse me.

17
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,453
有一两点我想澄清一下。
There's one or two points I'd like to get clarified.

18
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,129
恕我失陪，先生们。飞机正在等待。
You will have to excuse me, gentlemen. The plane is waiting.

19
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,591
这个女孩是谁?
Who's the girl?

20
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,890
这里是BBC最新新闻。
This is the BBC with the latest news bulletin.

ll/lontel教授，著名的核物理学家和原子科学家，在去维也纳参加一个会议的途中失踪。
Professor ll/lontel, famous nuclear physicist and atomic scientist, has vanished while en route to attend a conference in Vienna.

22
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,901
对警方来说，朗泰尔教授的失踪完全是个谜。。
Professor ll/lontel's disappearance is a complete mystery to the police.

23
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:25,617
今天有权威人士透露这位前诺贝尔奖得主就是著名科学家认为消失在铁村后面的污秽物。
Authoritative sources re veal today that the former nobel prize winner is the filth noted scientist believed to have vanished behind the iron cun'ain.

24
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,287
ll/lontel教授最后一次出现是在维也纳的国际机场。
Professor ll/lontel was last seen at the international airpon' in Vienna.

25
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:33,917
关于ll/lontel教授下落的猜测还在继续。
Speculation as to the whereabouts of professor ll/lontel continues.

26
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,924

Ten days have elapsed since the distinguished scientist vanished, and so far police have been unable to offer any explanation.

27
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:51,893
当局现在确信ll/lontel教授不是被绑架的他的失踪是有预谋的。
Authorities are now convinced that professor ll/lontel was not kidnapped and that his disappearance was pan' of a prearranged plan.

The search for professor ll/lontel continues into the fourth week.

30
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:07,951
有趣的是，尽管这个故事在美国和其他自由世界的报纸上占据了头版位置，
It is interesting to note that while the story has been given front-page space in newspapers in the United States and all other parts of the free world,

31
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:13,290
苏联官方喉舌《真理报》到目前为止还没有注意到这一点。
pravda, the official mouthpiece of the Soviet union, has, as yet, failed to take note on it.

32
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,778
-李·斯托克威尔下士?——正确的。
- Corporal Lee stockwell? - Right.

33
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,617
- R.J.麦克杜格尔先生?——这是正确的。
- Mr. R.J. Macdougall? - That's right.

34
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,662
-富兰克林·梅瑞狄斯先生——这是正确的。
- Mr. Franklin Meredith. - That's correct.

35
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,706
琼斯!
Jones!

36
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,584
恐怕你弄错了。我的名字叫macdougall。
I'm afraid you're mistaken. My name's macdougall.

37
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,171
你和我以前在潜艇服役时认识的一个军官长得一模一样。
You're a dead ringer for an officer I used to know in the submarine service.

38
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,173
对不起。
Sorry.

39
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,517
Macdougall先生吗?
Mr. Macdougall?

40
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,519
是的。
Yeah.

41
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,605
我的名字叫艾迪。
My name is eddy.

42
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,275
你的指令。
Your instructions.

43
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,285
有辆出租车在等你。司机知道地址。
There is a taxi waiting for you. The driver knows the address.

44
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,621
出租车63号。
Taxi number 63.

45
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,873
63号。
Number 63.

46
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,875
好吧。
Okay.

47
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,649
这是它。
This is it.

48
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,779
-你最好等我。-不，我现在就走。
- You better wait for me. - No, I go now.

49
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,966
等一下。如果我还需要你呢?我在哪里可以找到你?
Wait a minute. What if I need you again? Where can I find you?

50
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,158
-你叫什么名字?——艾迪。
- What's your name? - Eddy.

51
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,063
Macdougall先生吗?
Mr. Macdougall?

52
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,026
-是的。请进，跟我来。
- Yeah. - Come in, please, and follow me.

53
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,829
请小心脚下。
Watch your step, please.

54
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,847
-别告诉我你也叫艾迪。-“艾迪”是密码。
- Now don't tell me your name is eddy too. - “Eddy” is the password.

55
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,016
我是藤森研田，琼斯指挥官。
I'm hokada fujimori, commander Jones.

56
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,101
我很高兴见到你。
I'm very pleased to meet you.

57
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:25,065
谢谢。刚才我还以为这是密室外的东西呢。
Thanks. For a minute there, I thought this was something out of inner sanctum.

58
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,278
啊，你瘦了一点。
Ah, you've lost a little weight.

59
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,448
我在节食。
I'm on a diet.

60
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,327
我打赌泰勒队长长胖了?
I'll bet captain Taylor put a little fat on, huh?

61
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,414
-他在哪里?-我很遗憾地告诉你，你的朋友死了。
- Where is he? - I'm sorry to tell you, your friend is dead.

62
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:44,751
死了吗?
Dead?

63
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,713
他的飞机在北极探险返回途中坠毁。
His plane crashed returning from an arctic expedition.

64
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,799
没有人幸存下来。
No one survived.

65
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,556
他从来就不喜欢飞行。
He never did like to fly.

66
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,187
他为什么要我来这里?那5000美元是做什么用的?
Why did he want me to come here? What was the 5,000 for?

67
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,525
这是预付的酬劳泰勒队长很确定你会帮我们完成任务。
It's an advance payment for a job captain Taylor was certain you would do for us.

68
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,568
——推进?——是的。
- Advance? - Yes.

69
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,654
-我什么时候开始?——没有问题吗?
- When do I start? - Without questions?

70
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:16,616
为什么说话?如果泰勒让我去做那份工作，那肯定很合适。
Why talk? If Taylor lined me up for the job, it must be kosher.

71
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,452
有些人可能不认为这是洁食。
Some people might not exactly call it kosher.

72
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,538
请在这里。
In here, please.

73
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,344
先生们,指挥官琼斯。
Gentlemen, commander Jones.

74
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,388
——Mcauliff先生。-你好，先生。
- Mr. Mcauliff. - How do you do, sir?

75
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,390
-舒曼上校。-你好吗?
- Colonel schuman. - How are you?

76
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,725
——Aylesworth先生。-你好!
- Mr. Aylesworth. - How do you do?

77
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,186
和蒙特尔教授。
And professor montel.

78
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,993
-那个科学家蒙特尔?——是的。
- Montel, the scientist? - Yes.

79
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,996
所有人都在追杀你，教授。
Everybody and his brother is gunning for you, professor.

80
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,415
他们说你跳到了铁幕后面。
They say you skipped behind the iron curtain.

81
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,334
如你所见，只有一扇木门。
As you can see, only a wooden door.

82
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,713
-很高兴你来了。-谢谢你，先生。
- Glad you're here. - Thank you, sir.

83
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,050
你这里的布局真不错。
Well, it's quite a layout you got here.

84
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,972
你们是做什么生意的?
What kind of business are you gentlemen in?

85
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,057
调查的业务。
The business of investigation.

86
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:33,276
这些无人居住的北太平洋岛屿位于自由世界和铁幕之间的中立水域。
The scientific investigation of these uninhabited north pacific islands that lie in neutral waters between the free world and the iron curtain.

87
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,194
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

88
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:43,453
我们的推论使我们相信其中一个岛屿…我们不知道是哪一个，琼斯先生…已经准备好作为原子武器的军火库。
Our deductions make us believe that one of these islands... We don't know which one, Mr. Jones... Has been prepared as an arsenal for atomic weapons.

89
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,999
你的朋友泰勒上尉自愿接受摄影任务来找出答案。
Your friend captain Taylor volunteered to undertake a photographic mission to find out.

90
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,001
——自愿?——是的。
- Volunteered? - Yes.

91
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,003
——免费吗?——免费。
- For free? - For free.

92
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,088
他是那时出的车祸吗?
Is that when he had the accident?

93
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,382
这不是偶然。他的飞机被击落了。
It was no accident. His plane was shot down.

94
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:02,138
我们刚刚打印的这张照片来自他失事飞机上的照相机。
This photograph we have just printed came from the camera of his salvaged plane.

95
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,268
在海军服役三十年，却因为一张照片而被杀。
Thirty years in the Navy, and he gets killed for a picture.

96
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,812
免费的。
For free.

97
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:17,779
每个人都有自己活着的理由，琼斯先生，也都有自己的死的代价。
Each man has his own reason for living, Mr. Jones, and his own price for dying.

98
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,408
这是泰勒船长的代价。
This was captain Taylor's price.

99
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,580
什么都没有，教授。这是一个惨败。
There's nothing there, professor. It's a washout.

100
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,209
我不太确定。扩展这些行。
I wouldn't be too certain. Extend these lines.

101
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,379
它们可能是原子拱顶建筑。
They could be atomic vault constructions.

102
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,257
这里也可能是混凝土跑道的一部分。
And over here could also be part of a concrete runway.

103
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,887
看。听着，在我们进一步讨论之前，我想知道你们到底代表哪个国家?
Look. Look, before we go any further, exactly what country do you men represent?

104
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,016
我们作为个人代表许多国家。
We represent many countries, as private individuals.

105
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,186
我们是科学家、前政治家、商人。
We are scientists, former statesmen, businessmen.

106
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:56,818
所有志愿者都独立行动，为了共同的事业，对抗共同的敌人。
All volunteers acting independently for a common cause against a common enemy.

107
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:05,410
作为个人，我们可以在不侵犯任何中立水域的前提下进行科学调查。
As private individuals, we can conduct this investigation on a scientific basis without violating any neutral waters.

108
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:11,541
如果我们的怀疑得到了证实，我们就可以将我们的发现公之于众。
And if what we suspect is verified, we can then make our findings public.

109
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,418
那又有什么用呢?
And what good will that do?

110
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,795
你不觉得真相值得知道吗?
Don't you think the truth is worth knowing?

111
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:22,051
难道你不相信事实证据能一劳永逸地确定侵略者的身份和意图吗?
Don't you believe that factual proof will establish, once and for all, both the identity and the intention of the aggressor?

112
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,930
谁知道呢?但我在这幅画中处于什么位置呢?
Who knows? But where do I fit into the picture?

113
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,976
我们要你指挥一艘船去这些岛屿视察。
We want you to command a ship for an inspection tour of these islands.

114
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,395
-什么样的船?——一艘潜水艇。
- What kind of a ship? - A submarine.

115
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:40,111
我们知道，在第二次世界大战期间，你曾四次指挥潜艇在这个地区进行侦察巡逻。
We know that four times during world war ii, you commanded a submarine reconnaissance patrol in this very area.

116
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:45,908
我记得，你在这片海域与我的国家作战时取得了巨大的成功。
As I recall, you were extremely successful in these waters when you fought my country.

117
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,954
这次的敌人不同了，琼斯先生，但水是一样的。
This time the enemy is different, Mr. Jones, but the waters are the same.

118
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,540
你已经收到了5000美元。
You received already $5,000.

119
00:13:52,623 --> 00:14:02,425
两万美元会存入你的账户在你选择的任何银行你可以把蒙泰尔教授送到这个岛上。
20,000 in United States currency will be deposited to your account in any bank you elect to chauffeur professor montel to this island.

120
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:09,557
如果你能把他带着所有他想要的信息安全带回来，还能得到两万五。
And another 25,000 bonus when you bring him back safely with all the information he seeks.

121
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,604
那潜艇呢?它也是自愿的吗?
What about the sub? Did it volunteer too?

122
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,982
没人能在垃圾场找到一流的潜艇，琼斯先生。
One does not pick up a first-class submarine in the junkyard, Mr. Jones.

123
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,109
我们打捞了一艘日本潜艇。
We have salvaged a Japanese submarine.

124
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,111
——什么类?-我- 203。
- What class? - I-203.

125
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,323
污水管。有一个跟踪了我六个小时。泰勒，看看她?
Sewer pipe. Had one on my tail once for six hours. Taylor look her over?

126
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,033
——是的。-开始给她重新装修?
- Yes. - Start getting her refitted?

127
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,118
——是的。——武装?
- Yes. - Armed?

128
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:35,500
琼斯先生，这次任务的目的是科学调查，不是战斗。
Mr. Jones, the object of this mission is scientific investigation, not combat.

129
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,754
教授……我是指挥官吗?
Professor... Am I in command?

130
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,965
——这是正确的。-那我们就武装潜艇。
- That's right. - Then we arm the sub.

131
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,177
前提是你想让我把你毫发无损地救回来。
That is, if you want me to get you back in one piece.

132
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,555
你还救了一名船员吗?
Did you also salvage a crew?

133
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,642
我们挑选了有经验的志愿者。
We have picked volunteers, experienced men.

134
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,811
船上将有两名科学家。
There will be two scientists on board.

135
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,605
蒙泰尔教授和他的助手杰拉德教授。
Professor montel and his assistant, professor Gerard.

136
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:09,617
我们不确定是哪个岛，但有一艘货船，江清号，以前载着混凝土和重金属来过这片区域好几次。
We aren't positive which island it is, but a certain freighter, the kiang ching, has been up to this area several times before with cargos of concrete and heavy metals.

137
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,161
她又在天津装货了。
She's loading again at tientsin.

138
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,916
上次我跟踪一艘货船，我的工资是每月650美元，我还得自己买制服。
The last time I tailed a freighter, my price was 650 a month, and I had to buy my own uniforms.

139
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:24,298
好吧。我需要我自己的关键人物，那些曾经为我效力的人。
All right. I want my own key men, men who've served with me before.

140
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,426
你说出他们的名字，我们就能抓到他们。
You name them, and we'll get them.

141
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,137
你懂我吗?为现金。
Like you got me, huh? For cash.

142
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,139
如果它是必要的。
If it's necessary.

143
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:38,688
就像我之前说的，琼斯先生，每个人都有自己活着的理由和死的代价。
As I said before, Mr. Jones, each man has his own reason for living and his own price for dying.

144
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:44,068
我希望，对我们所有人来说，这将是一个一路顺风。
I hope, for all of us, that it will be a bon voyage.

145
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,129
乔凡内尔帮他拉线。
Giovanel help him with the line.

146
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,885
Giovanel你!你，卡皮诺，帮他弄鱼雷。
Giovanel you! You, carpino, give him a hand with the torpedo.

147
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,222
你觉得我有几只手，纽曼?
How many hands you think I got, neuman?

148
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,934
你叫纽曼先生。
Mr. Neuman to you.

149
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,833
记得把电池上的读数告诉我。
Now, make sure you give me the reading on that battery.

150
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:23,691
对了,队长。
Right, skipper.

151
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,819
来吧。来吧!
Come on. Come on!

152
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,780
来吧，伙计们。把它!来吧!
Bring it on, boys. Bring it around! Come on!

153
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,575
嘿，来吧。简单的现在。来吧。
Heyl come on now. Easy now. Come on.

154
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,036
来吧。来吧。好吧,。
Come on. Come on. All right, hold.

155
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,997
好吧,男孩。紧紧抓住防滑钉鞋。
All right, boys. Make it fast to the cleats.

156
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,210
嘿。
Hey.

157
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,428
-你从来不洗澡吗?-闭嘴。
- Don't you ever take a bath? - Ah, shut up.

158
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,348
“啊,闭嘴。你的词汇量就这么多吗?
“Ah, shut up.” is that the extent of your vocabulary?

159
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,934
你为什么要放弃摔跤呢?
What'd you ever give up the wrestling racket for anyway?

160
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,978
我刚发现那是假的。
I just found out it was phony.

161
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:05,167
这就是问题所在……我说，这就是这些假摔跤手的问题所在。
That's the trouble with these... I say, that's the trouble with these phony wrestlers, dugboat.

162
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,693
-他们从不洗澡。-我们也是。
- They never take a bath. - We do too.

163
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,285
嘿,joto。嘿,joto。后阀不转了。
Hey, joto. Hey, joto. The after valve won't turn.

164
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,329
——什么?-后阀不转。
- What? - The after valve won't turn.

165
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,331
不,不。另一种方法。
No, no. The other way.

166
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,793
都反过来了。难怪你们这些家伙会输掉战争，有这样的潜艇。
Everything backwards. No wonder you blokes lost the war, with subs like this.

167
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,004
——队长。-是的。
- Skipper. - Yeah.

168
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,966
-那个叫威尔斯的家伙…任何好吗?-澳大利亚最好的工程师。
- That guy welles... any good? - Best engineer out of Australia.

169
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,302
-要是有威尔伯就好了。-是的。
- Wish we had wilbur. - Yeah.

170
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:38,224
有了查理·威尔伯操纵船首帆上的引擎，就没什么可担心的了。
With Charlie wilbur handling the engines on the bowfin, there was nothing to worry about.

171
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,977
听说他现在是脱衣舞娘了。
Hear he's a three-striper now.

172
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,979
是的，我听说了。
Yeah, so I hear.

173
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,565
船长，二号瞄准器坏了。
Skipper, that number two scopes don't work.

174
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,109
-怎么了?-没办法把锈去掉。
- What's the matter with it? - Can't get the rust out of it.

175
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,152
-第一名怎么样?-我没检查。
- How 'bout number one? - Didn't check it.

176
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,238
把她抬起来，动态心电图。
Lift her up, holter.

177
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,204
上面的教授要见船长。
The professor topside wants to see the captain.

178
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,206
让他下来。
Send him down.

179
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,792
他是幕后黑手。
He's part of the brass behind this setup.

180
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,503
如果他看起来很眼熟，什么都别说。稍后我将解释。
Now, if he looks familiar, don't say anything. I'll explain later.

181
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,842
你好,教授。欢迎登机，长官-船长。
- Hello, professor. Welcome aboard, sir. - Captain.

182
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:18,014
好吧，我们试着用一点口水和大量的汗水把这个下水管道组装起来。
Well, we're trying to put this sewer pipe together with a little spit and a lot of sweat.

183
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,641
-我想我们会解决的。-琼斯上尉。
- I guess we'll make it all right. - Captain Jones.

184
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,144
有什么事吗?有什么问题吗?
What's the matter? Is there something wrong?

185
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:27,565
很抱歉，我们不能允许你的船员参加这次探险。
I'm sorry to say we cannot permit one of your crew to make this expedition.

186
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,859
你是什么意思?他们都是精心挑选的。
What do you mean? They were all handpicked.

187
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,861
-我们不能相信这个。——谁?
- We cannot trust this one. - Who?

188
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,779
鱼雷手，雷夫尼克。
The torpedo man, revnik.

189
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,781
你选的人之一。
Oh, one of the men you picked.

190
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,368
我本可以一直告诉你的。knothead。
I could have told you that all the time. A knothead.

191
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,538
你也检查了我所有的人吗?
Did you screen all my men too?

192
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:46,042
非常亲密，包括你。
Very closely, including you.

193
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,836
——好的。我马上把莱夫尼克处理掉。——好。
- Okay. I'll get rid of revnik right away. - Good.

194
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,838
霍尔特,我希望……
Holter, I want...

195
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,812
她是替补吗，医生?
She the replacement, doc?

196
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:11,442
先生们，这是杰勒德教授，我的助手，我的得力助手。
Gentlemen, this is professor Gerard, my assistant and my right arm.

197
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,612
-你好。-丹尼斯，这是琼斯队长。
- Hiya. - Denise, this is captain Jones.

198
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,490
-琼斯上尉。-很高兴认识你，教授。
- Captain Jones. - Glad to know you, professor.

199
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,910
如果我知道这件事，我就会降价了。
Well, if I'd known about this, I'd have cut my price.

200
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,871
伙计们，这两位教授要跟我们一起去。
Boys, these two professors are going with us as cargo.

201
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,873
——什么?-你听到了。
- What? - You heard me.

202
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,001
你的垫圈爆了吗?没人会把女人带上船。
Have you blown a gasket? Nobody takes a female along in a pigboat.

203
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:33,798
听着，小子，你要跟我说他们是坏运气吗?
Look, junior, you gonna give me that 2,000-year-Old Navy bilge that they're bad luck?

204
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,509
看看她。这有什么不好的?
Take a look at her. What's so bad about that?

205
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:43,015
一文不值。完全没有啊，他们都是约拿。它的传统。
Nothin'. Absolutely nothin'i ah, they're all Jonahs. It's traditional.

206
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,979
船长，我已经决定了。别把我算在内。
Look, skipper, I made up my mind. Count me out.

207
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,858
好吧。
Okay.

208
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,860
还有人吗?
Anybody else?

209
00:19:56,362 --> 00:20:03,411
我给你们五分钟时间好好想想，记住，如果有必要，我可以把你们每个人都换掉。
I'll give you jokers five minutes to sleep on it, and remember, iflhaveto, I can replace every one of you.

210
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,038
队长，我也不喜欢这样。
Captain, I do not like it either.

211
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,302
哦,scusami。
Oh, scusami.

212
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,390
也许你是对的。
Perhaps you are right.

213
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:28,477
在你看来，我是一个…一个女性。
In your estimation, I am a... a female.

214
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,439
但首先我是个科学家，是个好科学家。
But first I am a scientist and a good one.

215
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:35,192
我不是唯一一个非你们性别的科学家。
And I am not the only scientist who is not of your sex.

216
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,319
有很多。
There are many.

217
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:43,743
比如Lise meitner博士，他在原子弹的研制中发挥了重要作用。
Like Dr. Lise meitner, who played an important part in the development of the atom bomb.

218
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,371
比如发现镭的居里夫人。
Like madame curie, who discovered radium.

219
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,875
我是在实验室里长大的。
I have grown up in laboratories.

220
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,669
我这辈子都在和男人打交道。
All my life, I have worked with men.

221
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:58,841
我从来没有干涉过他们，他们也从来没有怨恨过我。
Never have I interfered, and never have they resented me.

222
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:05,097
montel教授和我…有很多事情要完成。
Professor montel and I have... Have much to accomplish.

223
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,725
多。
Much.

224
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:17,276
如果你不让我的…我的出现是…一场小叛乱。
And I shall appreciate it if you would not let my... my presence be the cause of... of a minor mutiny.

225
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,002
我喜欢你。
I like you.

226
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,005
我喜欢你们所有人。
I like you all.

227
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,635
我会尽我最大的努力让你喜欢我……
And I shall try my best to make you like me...

228
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,807
作为一个科学家。
As a scientist.

229
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,736
天啊，这对一个女人来说太拗口了!
Man, that was quite a mouthful for a female!

230
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,406
这是没有女性。这是一个科学家!
That's no female. That's a scientist!

231
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,159
好吧。来吧。我们还有很多工作要做。我们走吧。
All right. Come on. We got a lot of work to do. Let's go.

232
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,920
嗨，藤森先生，教授。
Hi, Mr. Fujimori, professor.

233
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,923
-你的助理呢?-你准备好起航了吗?
- Where's your assistant? - Are you prepared to sail?

234
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,801
明天我们进行潜泳测试后我再通知你。
I'll let you know tomorrow after we make the running dive tests.

235
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,803
我们已经没有明天了。
There's no tomorrow left for us.

236
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,389
江青号货轮半小时前从天津启航了。
The freighter kiang ching sailed from tientsin a half hour ago.

237
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,766
-你必须马上离开。-你在说什么?
- You must leave right away. - What are you talking about?

238
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,104
我们才工作了两个星期。这个浴缸还有很多工作要做。
We only been working for two weeks. We've got a lot of work left to do on this tub.

239
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,274
你必须在天黑前离开，才能赶上她。-正在进行的测试呢?
- You must leave by dark to overtake her. - What about the running tests?

240
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,821
作为一个业余爱好者，我建议我们在跑步的时候试试跑步测试?
As an amateur, might I suggest that we try the running test while we are running?

241
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,740
博士，失去潜艇的方法有上百种。
Doc, there are about a hundred ways of losing a submarine.

242
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,784
你刚刚想出了最好的一个。
You've just come up with one of the best.

243
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,870
我们还没检查鱼雷发射管呢。
We haven't even checked the torpedo tubes yet.

244
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,498
你知道如果我们要叫鱼的话意味着什么吗?这意味着我们死了。
You know what that means if we have to call on fish? It means we're dead.

245
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,584
你今晚必须离开。
You've got to leave tonight.

246
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,130
好吧，老兄，这次旅行你买了。你想让我试试吗?
Okay, buster, you're buying this trip. You want me to chance it?

247
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,008
这不是我们想要的，琼斯上尉。这是必须要做的。
It's not what we want, captain Jones. It's what must be done.

248
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,678
好吧。只要这位教授知道他是为了什么才进来的。
All right. Just as long as the professor here knows what he's letting himself in for.

249
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,490
我们已经安排飞机联系，告诉你江清的位置。
We've arranged airplane contact to give you position on the kiang ching.

250
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,309
-他们怎么联系我们，用信号灯还是无线电?-两者都不是没有风险的。
- How'll they contact us, blinker or radio? - Neither is without risk.

251
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,353
我们认为掉软木塞最安全。
We've decided cork drop is safest.

252
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:21,692
这包含您的代码，这包含您的联系人日程安排。
This contains your code, and this contains your schedule for contacts.

253
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,153
哦，还有一件事。
Oh, just one more thing.

254
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,574
我需要一个明确的指示，详细说明我的具体权力。
I want a clear-cut directive detailing my specific authority.

255
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,035
都在这里，船长。
You'll find it all in here, captain.

256
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,495
在海上，完全由你指挥。
At sea, you are in complete command.

257
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,166
在陆地上，蒙泰尔教授负责指挥。
On land, professor montel is in command.

258
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,628
我能祝你好运吗?
May I wish you the best of luck?

259
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,630
谢谢。
Thanks.

260
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,702
现在正是时候，纽曼先生。
Well, now's as good a time as any, Mr. Neuman.

261
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,664
-把她带到潜望镜深度。——是的,先生。
- Take her down to periscope depth. - Yes, sir.

262
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,749
清晰的桥梁!
Clear the bridge!

263
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,129
潜水!
Dive!

264
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,228
站在那边。你会没事的。
Stand right over there. You'll be all right.

265
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,898
——谢谢。-杰勒德教授，把手给我。
- Thank you. - Professor Gerard, give me your hand.

266
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,068
注意顶端的横档。这是谋杀。
Watch that top rung. It's murder.

267
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,070
——谢谢。——欢迎你。
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

268
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,072
你坐在这里。
You sit right here.

269
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,157
船长，在潜望镜深度修整完毕。
Captain, trim satisfactory at periscope depth.

270
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,159
- - - - - -很好。Joto。——是的,先生?
- Very well. Joto. - Yes, sir?

271
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,972
帮威尔斯把右舷引擎的蓝图翻译一下，好吗?
Give welles a hand with those starboard engine blueprint translations, will you?

272
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,914
我会处理的，队长。
I'll take care of it, captain.

273
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,208
fonnard鱼雷室一切都很紧张。
Everything's tight in the fonnard torpedo room.

274
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,378
我们要把她弄到深处去。检查所有站点。让我知道。
We're gonna try her down deep. Have all stations checked. Let me know.

275
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,755
哦,是的,队长。
Ay, ay, captain.

276
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,175
这就是我们今天谈到的测试，教授。
This is that test we were talking about today, professor.

277
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,845
——现在?——现在。
- Now? - Now.

278
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,598
不要紧张。如果我们崩溃了，你就没机会感受了。
Don't get nervous. If we crack up, you won't get a chance to feel it.

279
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,600
不要着急。没事的。
Take it easy. It'll be all right.

280
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,686
把她放在下面，纽曼先生。
Put her on the bottom, Mr. Neuman.

281
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,771
下降2度。
Two degrees down bubble.

282
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,608
——洪水负面。——洪水负面。
- Flood negative. - Flood negative.

283
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,326
哦，谢谢，李成。
Oh, thanks, chin Lee.

284
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,412
咖啡,教授?——不,谢谢。

285
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,998
-你呢?-不用了，谢谢。
- How 'bout you? - No, thank you.

286
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,466
两百英尺，卡比塔先生。
Two hundred feet, kapita'n.

287
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,312
最好等一下，教授。
Better hold on, professor.

288
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,677
好吧。现在我们来看看能不能冲上屋顶。
All right. Now let's see if we can hit the roof.

289
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,514
-把她抬上去，纽曼先生。-关闭所有主压载通风口。
- Take her up, Mr. Neuman. - Close all main ballast vents.

290
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,850

- Stand by to surface. - Stand by to surface.

291
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,894
——表面。——表面。
- Surface. - Surface.

292
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,484
-炸掉所有主镇流器!-吹灭所有主镇流器。
- Blow all main ballasts! - Blow all main ballasts.

293
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,077
空气库是怎么回事，动态心电图?
What's with the air banks, holter?

294
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:03,997
空气库已经干了。
The air bank's dry.

295
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,625
打开应急银行让他们听电话。
Open the emergency banks. Put 'em on the line.

296
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:08,919
他们打不开。
They won't open.

297
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,171
它们必须打开。我们已经检查了一切。
They've got to open. We've checked everything.

298
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,608
这些标志都搞混了。我要试每一个瓣膜。
These signs are all fouled up. I'll have to try every valve.

299
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,134
不，等一下。
No, wait a minute.

300
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,929
乔托，到控制室来。解开这些日本符号。
Joto, come to the control room. Unsnarl these Japanese signs.

301
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,474
我可以翻译。上面写着"打开应急空气库"
I can translate it. That one reads, “open emergency air bank.”

302
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,894
——什么?"打开应急空气库"
- What? - “Open emergency air bank.”

303
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,147
去做吧。试一试。
Go ahead. Try it.

304
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,903
-空中银行上线了。——好。谢谢。
- Air bank's on the line. - Good. Thanks.

305
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,989
好吧。把她放在屋顶上。
Okay. Put her on the roof.

306
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,962
——队长。-是的。没事吧，卡皮诺?
- Skipper. - Yeah. Everything all right, carpino?

307
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,882
只是填料腺体周围有几处漏水。我标记他们。
Just a few leaks around the stuffing glands. I marked them.

308
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,050
好吧。彻底搜查，斯基。
Okay. Make a full sweep, ski.

309
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,928
都清楚,队长。
All clear, skipper.

310
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,598
钻井平台为红色。范围。
Rig for red. Up scope.

311
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,600
你最好搬出去，教授。
You better move out, professor.

312
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,020
这有助于我们的眼睛适应黑暗时，我们上去。
This helps get our eyes used to the dark when we go up.

313
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,115
打开舱门，holter。
Open the hatch, holter.

314
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,703
你翻译得很好，医生。
You did a good job translating that sign, doc.

315
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,957
杰勒德教授是摩尔。
Professor Gerard is mol.

316
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,378
-摩尔?-精通东方语言。
- Mol? - Master of oriental languages.

317
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,882
哦?启封后。启封后。
Oh? Tres bon. Tres bon.

318
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,884
范围。
Down scope.

319
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,847
很高兴你能加入，教授。
Glad to have you aboard, professor.

320
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,393
很高兴能上船，船长。
Glad to be aboard, captain.

321
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:13,502
队长。教授想知道是否可以上来呼吸一下新鲜空气。
Captain. The professor wants to know if it's all right to come up for fresh air.

322
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,004
——哪一个?-有胡子的那个。
- Which one? - The one with the beard.

323
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,258
哦。好吧。
Oh. Okay.

324
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,344
航向355，双引擎全速前进。
Come to course 355, ahead full on both engines.

325
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,846
哦,是的,队长。
Ay, ay, captain.

326
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,933
你不需要带伞，教授。她是一条干船。
You won't need your umbrella, professor. She's a dry boat.

327
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,228
没什么好担心的。
It's nothing to worry about.

328
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:35,190
几乎每个人第一次下来都会有幽闭恐惧症的感觉。
Almost everybody gets a touch of claustrophobia first time down.

329
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,776
这不是幽闭恐惧症，上尉。
It's not claustrophobia, captain.

330
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,863
而是意识到，我们的使命终于开始了。
It's the realization that, at last, our mission has begun.

331
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:55,711
如果6个月前有人告诉我，今天我会在一艘开往北极水域的潜艇上，寻找一个秘密的原子基地……-我简直不敢相信。-我明白你的意思。
If anyone had told me six months ago that today I would be on a submarine headed for arctic waters in search of a secret atomic base... - I just can't believe it. - Yeah, I know what you mean.

332
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:01,049
嗯,嗯…你的助理呢，教授?
Well, uh... What about your assistant, professor?

333
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,970
是什么让一个长得那样的女孩迷上了科学?
What makes a girl who looks like that get mixed up in science?

334
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,889
她来自一个科学家家庭。
She comes from a family of scientists.

335
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,058
她是个神童。
She was a child prodigy.

336
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,269
14岁时，她进入了大学。
At 14, she entered college.

337
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,564
18岁时，她在哥廷根大学学习。
At 18, she studied at gottingen.

338
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,691
她真的很聪明。
She is really very brilliant.

339
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,987
身材神童的费舍，对吧?
A child prodigy with a body by Fisher, huh?

340
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,533
这是整个潜艇服务中最伟大的小艇。
And this is the greatest pigboat in the whole submarine service.

341
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,910
美国海军弓鳍鱼。
The USS bowfin.

342
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:34,708
这是我们一起服役的一次…我，队长，炮手，挖泥船和船长。
It's one we served on together... Me, the chief, gunner, dugboat and the skipper.

343
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,210
美丽的,不是吗?
Beautiful, ain't she?

344
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,671
哦,是的。非常漂亮。
Oh, yes. Very beautiful.

345
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,716
你知道还有一件很漂亮的事吗?
You know something else that's very beautiful?

346
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,594
我这辈子都想找到一个叫丹尼斯的女孩。
All my life I've been wanting to find a girl called Denise.

347
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,764
斯基，我相信你会找到她的。
Oh, ski, I'm sure you will find her.

348
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,932
我找到她了，没错。
Oh, I found her, all right.

349
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,770
你看，我很快就记住了你的名字。
You see, I lost no time at all in learning your first name.

350
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,190
是的。丹尼斯。它一直是我最喜欢的名字。
Yep. Denise. It's always been my favorite name.

351
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:02,277
我…我从没见过丹尼斯，但我知道我会的。
I... I never met a Denise, but I always knew I would.

352
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:06,656
你看，从我看到你的那一刻起，我就说"拉法耶，我来了"
You see, from the moment I saw you, I said, “Lafayette, I'm here.”

353
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,329
这是正确的。我就知道我会遇到一个叫丹尼斯的女孩。
That's right. I always knew I'd meet a girl called Denise.

354
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:16,416
D-e-n-i……别让他骗你，亲爱的。
D-e-n-i... Don't let him kid you, honey.

355
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,419
我刚看到他把你的名字写在胳膊上。
I just seen him put your name on his arm.

356
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,963
——看。-好吧，小家伙。你自找的!
- Look. - All right, bub. You asked for it!

357
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,132
不!
No!

358
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,558
过来，你这个大酒鬼!
Come here, you big drunkard!

359
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,659
这就是我所说的约拿。他们在对那位夫人发牢骚。
That's what I mean by Jonahs. They were beefing over the dame.

360
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,120
不是她的错。他僵硬的。
Wasn't her fault. He's stiff.

361
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,205
——她好吗?-是的。
- She okay? - Yeah.

362
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,290
只是受了点小伤。
Just roughed up a little.

363
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,376
好好照顾他，holter。
Take care of him, holter.

364
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,878
来，我来帮你，教授。
Oh, here, let me help you, professor.

365
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:05,132
——谢谢。——让我们看看。
- Thank you. - Let's see.

366
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,470
我真的很抱歉，教授。
I'm really very sorry about this, professor.

367
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,014
那个醉汉是临时替补的。
That drunk was a last-minute replacement.

368
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,435
-他清醒的时候很好。——我很抱歉。
- He's all right when he's sober. - I'm sorry.

369
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,187
这是我最后…我想发生。
This is the last thing I... I wanted to happen.

370
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:23,024
它迟早要爆发的。让我们再看一遍。
It had to break out sooner or later. Let's have another look here.

371
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,194
唷!幸运的是你的牙还在。
Whew! It's lucky you still got your teeth.

372
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,328
别紧张，医生。没人会咬你的。
Don't get nervous, doc. Nobody's gonna bite you.

373
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:39,958
你不认为如果必要的话，药剂师应该给我治疗吗?
Don't you think that the pharmacist should treat me, if it's necessary?

374
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,669
他那两个家伙忙得不可开交。
He's got his hands full with those two lugs.

375
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:47,215
再说，他能做的事我都能做。
Besides, there's nothing he can do that I can't, you know.

376
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,801
哦,我的。他把你弄得油腻腻的。
Oh, my. He got you so greasy.

377
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,891
好吧。
Okay.

378
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,934
你知道什么是圆木吗?
You know what a log is?

379
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,395
——是的。-是吗?
- Yes. - You do, huh?

380
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,733
我应该把发生的每件事都详细地记录下来。
Well, I'm supposed to keep a detailed report of everything that happens.

381
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,195
-是给藤森先生的。——嗯。
- It's for Mr. Fujimori. - Mm-hmm.

382
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,072
它是怎么开始的呢?
How'd it start?

383
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,247
我在研究一个新公式时，斯基问我能不能给我看看他的胸部。
I was working on a new formula when ski asked if he could show me his chest.

384
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,333
-给你看他的胸部?——是的。
- Show you his chest? - Yes.

385
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,879
然后呢?
And then what?

386
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,258
然后他脱下了衬衫。
Then he removed his shirt.

387
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,344
没有在开玩笑吧?
No kidding?

388
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,639
-他想让我看看他的纹身。-哦,不。
- He wanted me to see his tattoo. - Oh, no.

389
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,768
-很漂亮的纹身。-我打赌是的。
- It was a beautiful tattoo. - I'll bet it was.

390
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,770
——美丽。——嗯。
- Beautiful. - Mm-hmm.

391
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,106
-但醉酒的那个擦掉了。——自然。
- But the intoxicated one rubbed it off. - Naturally.

392
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,193
告诉我，他在挑逗你吗?
Tell me, uh, he make a pass at you?

393
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,905
——通过?-他想吻你吗?
- A pass? - Did he try to kiss you?

394
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,616
是的,他做到了。
Yes, he did.

395
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,702
他,是吧?你把他打昏了吗?
He did, huh? Did you coldcock him?

396
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,541
——什么?-你打他了吗?
- What? - Did you hit him?

397
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,960
等一下。等一下。
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

398
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,463
电话。电话。现在，用英语说。
Hold the phone. Hold the phone. Now, say that in English.

399
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,549
-我扇了他一巴掌。-是吗?
- I slapped him. - You did, huh?

400
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:15,095
告诉我，他亲了你之后你打了他?
Uh, tell me, uh, you hit him after he kissed you?

401
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,014
——是的。-之前没有吧?
- Yes. - Not before, huh?

402
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,187
我不明白。
I do not understand.

403
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:27,732
你看，教授，我只是想确认我的报告是真实的。
Well, you see, professor, I just want to make sure my report is factual.

404
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,734
-我不能放…-琼斯上尉。
- I couldn't put... - Captain Jones.

405
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:33,655
这份报告是给藤森先生的还是给你的?
Is this report for Mr. Fujimori or for you?

406
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,241
——嗯…——嗯。
- Uh... - Mmm.

407
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:40,495
说真的，一个神童应该能弄明白。
Now, really, a child prodigy oughta be able to figure that one out.

408
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,664
你不觉得吗?
Don't you think?

409
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,666
——是的。——是的。
- Yes. - Yes.

410
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,131
再见,教授。
Au revoir, professor.

411
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,100
现在听我说。
Now listen to me.

412
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,187
我不想再跟你吵架了，明白吗?
I don't want any more beefs, you understand?

413
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:12,193
如果我听说有人对那个女孩动手动脚，我就亲自从一号鱼雷发射管把他射出来。
If I hear of anybody making a play for that girl, I'll personally shoot him out through torpedo tube number one.

414
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,447
队长，我们要去哪还是个秘密吗?
Captain, is it still a secret where we're goin'?

415
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,533
我们在追踪一艘货船去北太平洋的一个小岛。
We're tailin' a freighter to an island in the north pacific.

416
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,535
她会下沉?
Gonna sink her?

417
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,371
我们要溜进这个岛，看一看，然后溜出去。
We're gonna sneak into this island, take a look and sneak out.

418
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,373
这是一次科学考察。
This is a scientific expedition.

419
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:29,377
-但是，船长，我们在找什么?-四叶草。
- But, skipper, what are we lookin' for? - Four-leaf clovers.

420
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,255
如果岛上的人不喜欢我们怎么办?
Well, what if the guys on the island don't like us?

421
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:39,137
听着，我知道你们都渴望有行动，但只有在我们必须自卫的情况下，你们才会有行动，所以放松点。
Look, I know you're all itchin' for a little action, but you'll only get it if we have to defend ourselves, so relax.

422
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,201
琼斯Capitalne ?
Capitalne Jones?

423
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,001
Le capitalne琼斯。
Le capitalne Jones.

424
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,934
——嗯。——晚安。
- Mm-hmm. - Bonne nuit.

425
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,977
晚安。
Bonne nuit.

426
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,284
哦,早上好!
Oh, good morning!

427
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,162
-水够热吗，教授?-太好了，谢谢。
- Was the water hot enough, professor? - Just wonderful, thank you.

428
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,832
-你想"油烟" une c/garette?——Wh ?
- Voulez-vous ”fume” une c/garette? - Wh at?

429
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,876
-我在说法语。——哦。
- I'm speaking French. - Oh.

430
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,295
你想"油烟" une c/garette?
Voulez-vous ”fume” une c/garette?

431
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,965
你是说"我/oulez-vous fumer une c/garette "吗
Oh, you mean ”I/oulez-vous fumer une c/garette?”

432
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,469
-我就是这么说的——没有。是有益的。
- That's what I said. - No. Fumer.

433
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,096
——Foo-may。-不不不。
- Foo-may. - No, no, no.

434
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,682
你的嘴唇要像这样。
You have to form your lips like this.

435
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,518
是有益的。
Fumer.

436
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,520
是有益的。
Fumer.

437
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,399
是有益的。
Fumer.

438
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:59,277
是有益的。
Fumer.

439
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,239
我想我该走了。
I think I better go now.

440
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:06,159
谢谢你！
Thank you.

441
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,996
总有一天我会知道她眼睛是什么颜色的。
You know, someday I'm gonna find out what color her eyes are.

442
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,167
早上好，琼斯上尉。你找我?
Good morning, captain Jones. You wanted to see me?

443
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,128
你为什么让我在飞机上睡着了?
Why did you let me sleep through that plane contact?

444
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:22,008
我以为你需要休息。你当班将近20个小时。
I thought you needed the rest. You were on duty for almost 20 hours.

445
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,136
你就没想过这条信息有多重要吗?
Didn't you stop to think how important that message might be?

446
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,138
当然可以。
Of course.

447
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,975
所以我确定不是自己解码的。
So I made sure that it was not by decoding it myself.

448
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:39,150
如你所见，报告只说江青号的速度和航线没有改变。
As you see, it reports only that the kiang ching has made no change in speed or course.

449
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,402
我知道那不重要。
I knew that was of no importance.

450
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:51,371
教授，你有没有想过我可能会把这门课…你耽误了我们大约两个小时!
Professor, did it ever occur to you that I might be steering a course to be... You've lost us approximately two hours!

451
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,040
我很抱歉，队长。
I'm very sorry, captain.

452
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,293
-我想我学到了一些东西。-我希望如此。
- And I think I have learned something. - I hope so.

453
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,727
如果你想偷听谈话，就用对讲机。这是更容易。
If you want to listen in on conversations, use the intercom. It's easier.

454
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,188
我不希望听到这段对话。
That conversation I would prefer not to have heard.

455
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,608
-但我在等着见你。-好吧，你看我。我很忙。
- But I was waiting to see you. - Okay, you see me. I'm busy.

456
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:27,907
我和蒙泰尔教授共事多年了，但我从来没有听过有人像您这样对他这个领域里最伟大的科学家说话。
Many years have I been with professor montel, but never before have I heard anyone speak like you to the greatest scientist in his field.

457
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:31,786
蒙泰尔教授的领域不是指挥一艘古怪的潜艇。我的是。
Professor montel's field isn't commanding a screwball submarine. Mine is.

458
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,958
如果有必要这么无礼的话，我希望这次旅行时间很短。
If such rudeness is necessary, I hope this will be a very short cruise.

459
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,297
你找我有什么事?
What'd you want to see me about?

460
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,433
——Joto。——是的,先生?
- Joto. - Yes, sir?

461
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:59,272
将来，当一条消息传到这艘船上时，不管谁说这是不必要的，我都会收到，你明白吗?
In the future, when a message comes in to this boat, I get it, no matter who says it's unnecessary, you understand?

462
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,274
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

463
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:05,028
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh !
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

464
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,783
不，不，不。
No, no, no, no.

465
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,244
这一次，他是对的。
This time, he was right.

466
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:37,101
我们可以从桥上走吗?
May we come on the bridge?

467
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,187
确定。帮助你自己。
Sure. Help yourself.

468
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,274
联络飞机正按计划接近!
Contact plane approaching on schedule!

469
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,276
不够好。
Good enough.

470
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,366
好吧,查理。
Okay, Charlie.

471
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,084
在这里!
There it is!

472
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,522
这个是给你的，医生。
Well, this one's for you, doc.

473
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:27,568
"情报报告江庆携带非传统61-j太空舱"
“Intelligence reports kiang ching carrying unconventional-type 61-j capsule.”

474
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:31,531
藤森签署。”“61-j太空舱是什么?”
Signed, “fujimori.” what's a 61-j capsule?

475
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,574
引爆原子弹的炸药
The charge to explode an a-bomb.

476
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:39,414
嗨,队长。雷达显示有物体接近，方位355度。
Hey, skipper. Radar shows surface object approaching, bearing 355 degrees.

477
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,417
——速度?-还不知道，但他在快速接近。
- Speed? - Can't tell yet, but he's closing fast.

478
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,211
——范围。- 3800码。
- Range. - 3,800 yards.

479
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,089
也许那艘货船看到了我们的信号，来追我们了。
Maybe the freighter has seen our signal and comes after us.

480
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,172
钻井平台为红色。
Rig for red.

481
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,039
一艘潜艇在追我们。
A sub's after us.

482
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:24,459
子吗?我以为这是科学考察。
A sub? I thought this was a scientific expedition.

483
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,586
是的，我们要谨慎行事。
It is, and we're gonna play it safe.

484
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,006
除非万不得已，否则流鼻血也没用。
No use getting a bloody nose unless we have to.

485
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,635
她在水下听我们说话。
She's submerged and listening for us.

486
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,097
-所以她才不再联系我-什么意思?
- That's why she stopped pinging. - What does this mean?

487
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:42,643
意思是她在保存鱼雷，等我们浮出水面。
It means she's saving her torpedoes, waiting till we surface.

488
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:47,732
再过一天，博士，我们就能把鱼雷发射管彻底检修完。
Just one more day, doc, and we'd have finished overhauling those torpedo tubes.

489
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,984
你能看到她的瞄准镜吗?
Can you see her scope?

490
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,447
我们也可以装死。
Well, we can play possum too.

491
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,285
-氢怎么样了?-增加到3%。
- How's the hydrogen? - Built up to three percent.

492
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,248
我们不能冒险在这里浮出水面。我们得跑了。
Well, we can't chance surfacing here. We've got to make a run for it.

493
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:07,752
教授，我觉得你们俩最好都待在自己的房间里。
Professor, I think you'd both better stay in your quarters.

494
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,754
范围。
Down scope.

495
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,025
他们还在船尾，船长。
They're still on our stern, skipper.

496
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,834
-氢气怎么样?-按我们的百分比计算，还在增加。
- How's that hydrogen gas? - F our percent and still building.

497
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,805
带她了!
Take her up!

498
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,566
好吧,查理。
Okay, Charlie.

499
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,638
你最好离桥远点，教授。
You better keep off the bridge, professor.

500
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,640
我不上去。
I'm not going up.

501
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:49,562
如果船长发现你在控制室，他会大发雷霆的。
The skipper'd blow his top if he even found you here in the control room.

502
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,648
-请坐，教授。抓住一些空气。——谢谢。
- Sit down, professor. Grab some air. - Thank you.

503
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,778
你认出潜水艇了吗?
Have you identified the submarine?

504
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,489
不。我们还没见过她呢。
No. We haven't even seen her yet.

505
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,367
他们在上面试图发现她。
They're topside trying to spot her now.

506
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,204
还没找到她，船长。
No sign of her yet, skipper.

507
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:09,415
声纳显示她就在附近。通知炮手。
Sonar tells us she's not far. Alert the gun crew.

508
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,460
——什么?——我知道。我们不是在找麻烦。
- What? - I know. We're not lookin' for trouble.

509
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:16,088
但不保护自己才是傻瓜。
But we'd be fools not to protect ourselves.

510
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,090
准备战斗!
Alert for battle stations!

511
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:21,219
炮手准备上甲板炮。
Gun crew stand by to man the deck gun.

512
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,973
那些鱼雷呢?
What about these torpedoes?

513
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:31,312
你知道那些管子还没检查过。忘记了鱼雷!
You know those tubes haven't been checked. Forget the torpedoes!

514
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,523
-她现在在哪里，joto?-范围,1500。
- Where is she now, joto? - Range, 1,500.

515
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,068
她要么搬出去，要么就会浮出水面。
Either she's moving out, or she's gonna surface.

516
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,781
她来了，船长!
There she is, skipper!

517
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,620
他们在甲板上。
They're coming out on deck.

518
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,664
问他们我们在哪，查理。
Ask them where we are, Charlie.

519
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,999
-为什么不现在就上5英寸的?——不!
- Why not man the five-incher now? - No!

520
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:56,087
一旦他们发现枪旁有船员，就会向我们发射鱼雷。
The minute they spot a crew near that gun, they'll throw torpedoes at us.

521
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,260
他们在说什么?
What are they saying?

522
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:05,012
他们想知道我们是谁，我们在这里干什么。
They want to know who we are and what we're doing here.

523
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:09,183
告诉他们我们是去北极的私人科学探险队。
Tell 'em we're a private scientific expedition headed for the arctic.

524
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,692
他们坚持要登船。
They insist on boarding us.

525
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,236
嗯,保持总得”。告诉他们我们不明白。
Well, keep stallin'. Tell 'em we don't understand.

526
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,738
请他们重复留言。
Ask them to repeat the message.

527
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:38,671
在船头放一个。让他们重复一遍，查理。
Put one over our bow. Keep asking them to repeat, Charlie.

528
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:45,011
把我们的鼻子转向她。带领001人。
Turn our nose into her. Steer 001.

529
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:48,055
准备好拿起枪。
And get ready to man that gun.

530
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,075
不要靠近救生索!
Keep clear of the lifeline!

531
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,627
右满舵。
Right full rudder.

532
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,746
鱼雷!
Torpedo!

533
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,043
清除甲板!清除甲板!
Clear the deck! Clear the deck!

534
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,920
潜水!
Dive!

535
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,106
关闭舱口!
Close the hatch!

536
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,157
我的手!我的手!
My hand! My hand!

537
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,120
我的手!
My hand!

538
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:38,290
-给我一把刀!——不!不!不!
- Give me a knife! - No! No! No!

539
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,088
在这里。
Here.

540
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,180
-他怎么样了?他是如何?-是他的拇指。
- How is he? How is he? - It's his thumb.

541
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,726
好吧。把他们都抓下来。
All right. Get 'em all below.

542
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,937
嘿,你们!快上来!帮我一把，快!
Hey, you guys! Come on up here! Give me a hand, quick!

543
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,023
我们装运的水太多了。拖不住她了。
We ship too much water. Can't hold her up.

544
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,107
把角度移开，让它沉到水底。
Get the angle off and let her settle to the bottom.

545
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,986
所有回满。
All back full.

546
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,667
敌人的鱼雷发射。
Enemy torpedo fired.

547
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:30,759
二号鱼从篮子里出来。
Number two fish out of their basket.

548
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,788
固定所有运转的机器。保持沉默。
Secure all running machinery. Remain silent.

549
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,041
舱底泵马达失灵，船长。
Bilge pump motor's fioodeo', skipper.

550
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,668
排成一排。把水倒进机舱的舱底。
Form a bucket line. Dump the water in the engine room bilges.

551
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:08,839
那个浴缸是为我们准备的，船长。她已经很接近了。
That tub's laying for us, skipper. She's coming real close.

552
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,007
我失去了她。
I lost her.

553
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:55,219
她现在什么都没说。没有声音。
Nothing out of her now. No sound.

554
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,016
你觉得呢，船长?
What do you think, skipper?

555
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,436
我觉得她跟我们耍的把戏一样。
I think she's pulling the same trick we are.

556
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:26,000
现在注意那海水。我们不希望船上有氯气。
Now watch that salt water. We don't want any chlorine gas in the boat.

557
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,973
持有它。
Hold it.

558
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:45,019
队长，这高温快把我们累死了。
Captain, this hot heat is killing us.

559
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,021
我们得把电扇打开。
We got to turn on the fans.

560
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:51,900
如果他们听到了我们的粉丝的声音，你就不用担心热死了，孩子。
If they heard our fans, you wouldn't have to worry about the heat killing you, boy.

561
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:55,070
好吧，我马上给你补充情况。
All right, I'll fill in the picture for you quick.

562
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:58,699
我们有鱼雷，但发射管无法发射。
We got torpedoes, but our tubes aren't in condition to fire 'em.

563
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:03,621
红色潜艇和我们一样停在海底，等着声纳发现我们。
And the red sub's parked on the bottom like we are, waitin' to pick us up on sonar.

564
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,707
一旦她这么做了，她会朝我们扔更多的鱼。
Once she does, she'll throw more fish at us.

565
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,754
所以问题是谁在没有空气的情况下能坚持得更久……是红色的还是我们。
So it's a question of who can hold out longer without air... the reds or us.

566
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:16,592
如果我们先突破，很有可能是最后一次突破。
If we break first, chances are it'll be our last break.

567
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:21,055
我们还装载了氢。
And we're loaded with hydrogen.

568
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,641
我们容易爆炸。
We're liable to explode.

569
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,393
但有一件事对我们有利。
But we got one thing in our favor.

570
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,271
我们可以通过闭上嘴来节省氧气。
We can save oxygen by shutting up.

571
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,566
这是所有。
That's all.

572
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,370
的,是吧?
Nothin', huh?

573
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,289
一文不值。
Nothin'.

574
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,630
我们得节省果汁。
We gotta save juice.

575
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,636
转移到红色。
Shift to red.

576
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,351
把耳朵竖起来，斯基。
Keep your ears open, ski.

577
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,899
很抱歉，队长，我太蠢了。
I am sorry, captain, for being so stupid.

578
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,443
没关系。别白费口舌了。
That's all right. Save your breath.

579
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,529
你必须用那把刀。
You had to use the knife.

580
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:29,284
如果你不关上舱门，我们都死了。
If you didn't close the hatch, we would all be dead.

581
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,539
你击败。
You're beat.

582
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:37,543
你最好回你的床上去，放松点。来吧。
You better get back to your bunk and take it easy. Come on.

583
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,535
-我想告诉你怎么…——嘘。
- I want to tell you how... - Shh.

584
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,621
不要说话。
Don't talk.

585
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,033
队长。
Skipper.

586
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,454
他的情况很糟糕。
He's in a bad way.

587
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:42,084
我以为注射麻醉药能起作用，但他休克了，还失血过多。
I thought that hypo was gonna do the trick, but he's sufferin' from shock and loss of blood.

588
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:49,508
如果他不马上呼吸点新鲜空气，你就只有一个教授了。
If he don't get some air right away, you're gonna have only one professor for cargo.

589
00:57:56,431 --> 00:58:00,352
那张床上有5万美金。
There's 50 grand in that bunk.

590
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,480
五万块值一点空气。
Fifty grand is worth a little air.

591
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,987
乔托，把白灯打开。
Joto, turn on the white lights.

592
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:29,381
伙计们，我要试一试。
Boys, I'm gonna try a long shot.

593
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:33,218
如果前几颗鱼雷打偏了，我们还有机会。
If her first couple of torpedoes miss us, we got a chance.

594
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:38,056
我宁愿在没有空气的情况下昏倒，也不愿被鱼雷击中。
I'd rather pass out without air than have a torpedo come plowing through us.

595
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:45,355
当我们启动水泵时，很容易产生火花。
Now when we start the pump, we're liable to get a spark.

596
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,444
可能会燃烧掉氢，也可能不会。
Maybe it'll burn off the hydrogen, maybe it won't.

597
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:56,658
如果不行，我们就会迅速爆炸，你永远感觉不到。
If it doesn't, we'll blow up so fast you'll never feel it.

598
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,204
祝我们大家好运。
Good luck to all of us.

599
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,140
-你都准备好了吗?——是的,先生。
- You got everything straight? - Yes, sir.

600
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,909
现在我们来看看我们的生活是否正确。
Now here's where we find out if we've lived right.

601
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,029
没有爆炸的可能。把消息传下去。
No more chance of explosion. Pass the word along.

602
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:18,031
慢慢地转弯。
And build up the turns slowly.

603
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,093
-别出声。——是的,先生。
- Hold down the noise. - Yes, sir.

604
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,285
-领先三分之一。——是的,先生。
- All ahead one-third. - Yes, sir.

605
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,496
把她抬到175英尺，纽曼先生。
Take her up and level her to 175 feet, Mr. Neuman.

606
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,789
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

607
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,849
她加速了，船长。
She's speeded up, skipper.

608
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,934
轴承240度。
Bearing 240 degrees.

609
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,936
右满舵!所有之前fiank !
Right full rudder! All ahead fiank!

610
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,988
-准备撞击!-准备撞击!
- Stand by to ram! - Stand by to ram!

611
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,661
距离200，方位010度。
Range 200, bearing 010 degrees.

612
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,455
离开满舵!把她降到190英尺。
Left full rudder! Take her down to 190 feet.

613
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,499
- - - - - - 190英尺。-准备撞击!
- 190 feet. - Stand by to ram!

614
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,628
所有,紧急!把所有主镇流器都炸毁!
All back, emergency! Blow all main ballasts!

615
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,338
船长!
Captain!

616
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,676
船长!
Captain!

617
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:46,591
你就在那里。你确定你没事吗，医生?
There you are. Are you sure you're all right, doc?

618
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,302
-好的，谢谢。——好的。
- Yes, thank you. - All right.

619
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,180
现在深吸一口新鲜空气。
Now take a good deep breath of fresh air.

620
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,161
感觉还好吧，挖泥船?
Feel all right, dugboat?

621
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:18,748
是的。对于一次安静的科学考察，我感觉好极了。
Yeah. For a quiet scientific expedition, I couldn't feel better.

622
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,419
你看起来糟透了。让我看看你的舌头。
You look awful. Let me see your tongue.

623
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,363
请进，请进。
J“ in, please j“

624
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:52,574
让我有足够的地面，这样我就可以绕着j跳。
j“ let me have plenty ground so that I can hopping round j“

625
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,368
请不要把我关起来
j“ not fencing me in, please j“

626
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,370
让我有个小房子
j“ let me have little house j“

627
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,664
J“竹席制J”
j“ made of bamboo mat j“

628
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:03,418
j "哦，请不要把我在的地方围起来"
j“ oh, please not putting fence around where I am at j“

629
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:07,589
j“我需要很大的空间，这样我才能摇摆猫j”
j“ I'm needing lots of room so I can swinging cat j“

630
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,591
不要把我困在J里
j“ not fencing me in j“

631
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:13,011
让我有棵树，这样小鸟就会筑巢
J“ let me have a tree so the birdies will make nest j“

632
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:15,013
J "和/可以吃燕窝汤J "
j“ and / can having bird nest soup j“

633
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,015
一切都很酷，伙计。
it all real cool, man.

634
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:20,059
让我在那边自由自在
J“ just set me free way out yonder j“

635
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,729
我会成为一个独立的傻瓜
j“ and ill be an independent nincompoop j“

636
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,731
结束了，杰克逊。
this are the end, Jackson.

637
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:29,736
J " /想在草上露着露珠的早晨醒来。
J“ / want to wake in the morning when the grass is dewy j“

638
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:33,573
看着我的小女人做饭，苏，y, J
j“ watch my little woman while she cook chop sue y j“

639
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:37,327
J "有栅栏围着我是一件很有趣的事。"
j“ having fence around me is a lot of hooe y j“

640
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,537
不要把我困在J里
j“ not fencing me in j“

641
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:00,725
我正在学习法语。就像李成学的那首美国歌。
I'm learning French. You know, like chin Lee learned that American song.

642
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,811
你在浪费时间，小子。
You're wasting your time, junior.

643
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,659
-你好。
-Hello.

644
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:20,870
如果那音乐打扰到你，我可以把它关掉。
Say, uh, if that music disturbs you, I could have it turned off.

645
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:23,081
哦,不。我…我喜欢音乐。
Oh, no. I... I love music.

646
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,708
——哦。了吗?——嗯。
- Oh. That? - Mm-hmm.

647
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,710
你的手怎么样，教授?
Well, how's the hand, professor?

648
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:29,796
很好，船长，你看。
Wonderful, captain, as you see.

649
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,589
好。很高兴听你这么说。
Good. Glad to hear it.

650
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,384
-你好吗，教授?-我很好，谢谢。
- And how are you, professor? - I'm fine, thank you.

651
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:40,098
——膨胀。你知道，当我…-琼斯船长，请到上面来。对不起，是属于土地所有权的。
- Swell. You know, uh, when I... - Captain jonesl come topside, please. Fre/ghter in s/ght of land excuse me.

652
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,279
好的机会。
Bonne chance.

653
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,101
我不明白你的意思。
I don't understand.

654
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,562
我们的情报报告不可能错得这么离谱。
Our intelligence report cannot be this wrong.

655
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,148
我们得到的只是正常的计数。
All we are getting is a normal count.

656
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:15,401
-你应该高兴。——别误会。
- You ought to be happy. - Don't misunderstand.

657
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,613
没有什么比知道我们的怀疑毫无根据更让我高兴的了。
Nothing would please me more than to know that our suspicions are unfounded.

658
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,615
那我们走吧。
Then let's move out.

659
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:25,203
这里除了破旧的加里森和一些破旧的储油罐什么都没有。
There's nothin' here but this two-bit Garrison and some beat-up storage tanks.

660
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:28,164
很遗憾我不能和他们说话。
It's a great pity I cannot talk to them.

661
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:31,459
我们是天壤之别。但毕竟，他们也是人。
We are worlds apart. But, after all, they are human.

662
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,766
——走吧。——但纽曼。
- Let's go. - But neuman.

663
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,810
算了吧。一枪爆头。
Forget it. Shot right through the head.

664
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,229
我们走吧。
Let's get out of here.

665
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,193
斯基，试着把灯弄灭!
Ski, try to knock out that light!

666
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,623
好了，加油!我们快离开这里!
All right, come on! Let's get outta here!

667
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,003
你黄色的狗!
You yellow dogs!

668
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,391
来吧,滑雪。帮我一下。让我们把他弄上船。
Come on, ski. Give me a hand. Let's get him in the boat.

669
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:55,436
你想和其中一个人类说话。我给你带了一个。
You wanted to talk to one of these humans. I got one for you.

670
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,324
把你们的外套弄湿。
Wet down your coats.

671
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:45,653
他们肯定在整个地区找我们，但目前还没找到，对吧?
Well, they must be combing the whole area for us, but so far, nothin', huh?

672
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,655
连一只海鸥都没有。
Not even a seagull.

673
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:51,951
嘿，挖泥船，你确定我擦在胸口的果冻不会吃掉我的纹身吗?
Hey, dugboat, you sure this jelly I'm rubbin' on my chest won't eat off my tattoo?

674
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,179
你在担心什么?你可以再买一个。
What are you worried about? You can always get another.

675
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:58,124
你疯了吗?这就是我的"阻力"
Are you nuts? That's my “piece de resistance.”

676
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,334
-你的什么?——这是法语。
- Your piece de what? - That's French.

677
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:02,336
我一直在练习“尼斯巴人?”
I been practicing, “Nessie-pas?”

678
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,840
你需要多练习。
You need more practice.

679
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:09,802
琼斯上尉。l/lontel教授要你去医务室。
Captain Jones. Professor ll/lontel wants to see you in sick bay.

680
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:18,185
-还要咖啡吗?——没有。不用了，谢谢你，李成。谢谢你！
- Want more coffee? - No. No, thank you, chin Lee. Thank you.

681
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:21,397
这是美妙的。
This is wonderful.

682
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,816
-你想见我，教授?——是的。
- You want to see me, professor? - Yes.

683
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,110
丹尼斯刚刚翻译了他的命令。
Denise has just translated his orders.

684
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:31,324
他的名字叫何新。他是一名飞行员，要去凯夫洛克岛执行特殊任务。
His name is ho sin. He's a pilot en route to kevlock island for special duty.

685
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,033
那又怎样?
So what?

686
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,744
凯夫洛克一定是泰勒拍摄的那个岛船长。
Kevlock must be the island captain Taylor photographed.

687
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,746
你怎么知道的?
Well, how do you figure that?

688
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:41,792
一个空军飞行员很难被分配到一个没有飞机跑道的岛上执行任务。
An air force pilot would hardly be assigned to duty on an island without an airstrip.

689
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:46,881
如你所知，kevlock是这条链中唯一一个有名字的岛。
And as you know, kevlock is the only island indicated by name in this entire chain.

690
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:50,384
它似乎在我们现在位置的正北方。
It appears to be due north of our present position.

691
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,387
那你觉得我们该怎么做?
And what do you suggest we do about it?

692
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:56,223
在我看来，我们的路线是显而易见的。
It seems to me our course is obvious.

693
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:59,685
-在我看来不是，医生。-什么意思?
- Not in my book, doc. - What do you mean?

694
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:06,859
我是说你曾经说过每个人都有自己活着的理由和死的代价。
I mean you said once that each man's got his own reason for living and his own price for dying.

695
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,070
我活着的理由就是五万美元。
Well, my reason for living is 50 grand.

696
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,030
我不会再冒险了。
I'm not sticking my neck out again.

697
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,784
-一条脖子这么重要吗，队长?-当它是我的时候就是。
- Is one neck that important, captain? - It is when it's mine.

698
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,285
你是什么样的人?
What kind of man are you?

699
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,913
持有它。持有它。
Hold it. Hold it.

700
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:22,124
我们不要和那些含糊其辞的人联合起来。
Let's not gang up with a lot of double-talk.

701
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,126
我是一个商人。
I'm a businessman.

702
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:28,130
也许对你们这种摇摆不定的人来说，我是个雇佣兵。好吧。
Maybe to a couple of fiag-wavers like you, I'm a mercenary. All right.

703
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:31,092
但我履行了我的义务。
But I lived up to my part of the contract.

704
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:35,429
我们说好的是跟踪货船到岛上，把你弄上岸，然后送你回东京。
The deal was to tail the freighter to the island, put you ashore and get you back to Tokyo.

705
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:38,557
没人说过还有第二座岛。
Nobody said anything about a second island.

706
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:42,395
所以在我看来，任务完成了。我们要回家了。
So as far as I'm concerned, mission completed. We're going home.

707
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,438
反对吗?
Any objections?

708
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,236
是的。
Yes.

709
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:55,825
我讨厌使用权力，但如果有必要，我会的。
I hate to use authority, but if I have to, I will.

710
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,994
我不希望事情发展到这一步。
I didn't want it to come to this.

711
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:04,000
但既然你提到了合同，仔细研究一下，船长。
But as long as you have mentioned the contract, study it closely, captain.

712
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:13,175
你会发现有一段话是这样说的:我，只有我，将决定任务何时完成。
You will find a paragraph stating that I, and I alone, shall determine when the mission is finished.

713
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:25,062
在我看来，船长，任务会在我被带到凯夫洛克，有机会检查岛屿并返回东京后结束。
And in my book, captain, the mission will be finished after I am taken to kevlock, given the chance to examine the island and returned to Tokyo.

714
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,446
——Joto。——是的,先生。
- Joto. - Yes, sir.

715
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,489
-朝正北走。-你说不?
- Head due north. - Did you say non'h?

716
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,743
你没听错。设定新的航向去凯夫洛克岛。
You heard me. Set a new course for kevlock island.

717
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:41,037
-在你的病历上。——是的,先生。
- It's on your chart. - Yes, sir.

718
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,562
好了，医生，我们走。
Okay, doc, let's go.

719
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,944
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?

720
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:56,946
我的膝盖。
My knee.

721
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,657
-我以为你今天早上说可以的。——这是。
- I thought you said it was okay this morning. - It was.

722
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,785
-我过一会儿就好。-不可能。你只会碍事。
- I'll manage in a few moments. - Not a chance. You'd just be in the way.

723
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,287
-明天会改善的。我很确定。——对不起,医生。
- It will improve by tomorrow. I'm sure of it. - Sorry, doc.

724
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:08,332
我们不会在这片水域待太久的。这是一个火药桶。
We're not hanging around these waters that long. This is a powder keg.

725
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:24,640
等待。等一下。等一下。这是怎么呢你在说什么?
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's going on? What are you talking about?

726
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:32,481
琼斯上尉，我的助手会陪你。
Captain Jones, my assistant will accompany you.

727
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:33,399
什么?
What?

728
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:40,739
她受过足够的训练来计算数字，确定力量和识别岛上的要素。
She has sufficient training to compute figures, determine strength and identify elements if there are any on this island.

729
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,741
你的意思是你会……你会让她走?
You mean you'd... you'd let her go?

730
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:49,790
除了我，杰勒德教授是探险队中唯一有能力完成这项任务的人。
With the exception of me, professor Gerard is the only member of this expedition capable of performing this task.

731
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:57,006
-你们俩都疯了。-你带她上岸，按照我的指示去做。
- Oh, you're both crazy. - You will take her ashore and follow her instructions as you would have followed mine.

732
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,508
她不能去，就这么定了。
She is not going, and that's final.

733
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:04,096
你还是不能下命令，对吧，琼斯上尉?
You still cannot take an order, can you, captain Jones?

734
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,098
裂缝后面是什么?
And what's behind that crack?

735
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,142
跟你想的完全一样。
Exactly what you think is behind it.

736
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,500
斯基，你留在这里。睁大眼睛。
Ski, you stay here. Keep your eyes open.

737
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,502
关于她的什么?我可以帮她拿设备。
What about her? I could carry her equipment.

738
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,713
她能处理好自己的设备。
She can take care of her own equipment.

739
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,115
嘘!
Psst!

740
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,320
看看下面。
Take a look down there.

741
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,323
看起来像一堆门。
Looks like a bunch of doors.

742
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:55,207
恐怕我们已经找到我们要找的东西了。
I'm afraid we have found what we are looking for.

743
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:19,273
这样的盖革反反应只能说明一件事。
A geiger counter reaction like this can mean only one thing.

744
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:22,151
这些数字……
These figures...

745
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:36,081
他们在说什么?
What are they saying?

746
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:39,877
他们在找lumfong，一个失踪的士兵。
They are looking for lumfong, a missing soldier.

747
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:48,093
我们得等他们搬走。来吧。
We gotta stay put till they move out. Come on.

748
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:11,617
你说我还是不能接受订单是什么意思?
What did you mean when you said I still can't take an order?

749
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,660
你的记录,船长。
Your record, captain.

750
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:16,789
在战争中，你是个很好的军官，除了一件事。
In the war you were a very good officer, except for one thing.

751
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,625
继续。我着迷。
Go on. I'm fascinated.

752
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:24,338
你可以下命令，但你不能接受。
You could give orders, but you couldn't take them.

753
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:29,718
现在看来,我…我知道你在说什么。
Now look, I... I know what you're talking about.

754
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:34,139
但如果你想知道一个人的动力是什么，你就不能只看记录。
But if you want to know what makes a guy tick, you've got to look beyond the record.

755
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:36,475
那些菲律宾游击队被隔绝和包围了。
Those philippine guerrillas were cut off and surrounded.

756
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,644
他们必须有弹药和补给。
They had to have ammunition and supplies.

757
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,772
我不能坐在我的罐子上让他们死。
I couldn't just sit there on my can and let 'em die.

758
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:47,152
我知道水已经被挖空了，但我想我可以毫发无损地进出。
I knew the waters were mined, but I figured I could get in, get out without a scratch.

759
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,238
所以我写了自己的命令。
So I wrote my own orders.

760
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:54,410
我失去了潜艇和26个人。
I lost my sub and 26 men.

761
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,664
如果!必须的，我还会再做一次。
And if! Had to, I'd do it again.

762
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:24,273
我很抱歉……非常抱歉。
I'm sorry... Very sorry.

763
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,318
我提这事都是不对的。
It was wrong of me even to mention it.

764
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,072
算了吧。一切都结束了。
Forget it. It's all over.

765
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,210
-你还好吧?——好。
- You all right? - Fine.

766
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:56,180
这一切结束后，如果我们回来了，你怎么了?
When this is over, if we get back, what gives with you?

767
01:22:56,263 --> 01:23:00,767
——给了吗?-我是说，你打算怎么办?
- Gives? - I mean, what are you gonna do?

768
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,729
我想是回巴黎吧?
Go back to Paris, I suppose, huh?

769
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,106
-巴黎是我的家。-是的。
- Paris is my home. - Yeah.

770
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,402
你呢?
And you?

771
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:13,489
这一切结束后，你会怎样?
When this is over, what gives with you?

772
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,491
我不知道。
I don't know.

773
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,746
你去过巴黎吗?
Have you ever been in Paris?

774
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,831
不,从来没有。
No, never.

775
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,460
你会喜欢的。
You would love it.

776
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:28,837
美国人总是这样。
Americans always do.

777
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:38,680
我们不能待在这里。
Well, we can't stay here.

778
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:41,892
如果他们把我们拖到早上，我们可能就回不去了。
If they hold us up till morning, we might never get back.

779
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:46,396
我去看看有没有别的路出去。来吧。
I'm gonna see if there's another way out of here. Come on.

780
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:56,490
你呆在这里。我马上回来。
You stay here. I'll be right back.

781
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,624
在这里。
Here.

782
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:09,253
你不需要这个，但有时看到它是一种安慰。
You won't need this, but sometimes the sight of it's a comfort.

783
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:11,338
我马上就回来。
I'll be back in a minute.

784
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,440
Lumfong !
Lumfong!

785
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,784
Lumfong !
Lumfong!

786
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:16,880
丹尼斯!
Denise!

787
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:22,427
给我。来吧。我们走吧。
Give me that. Come on. Let's get out of here.

788
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,642
来吧。
Come on.

789
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,862
快点。来吧。
Hurry up. Come on.

790
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,166
来吧。
Come on.

791
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:56,503
我们走吧。
Let's go.

792
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:36,501
这证实了我们最担心的事情。
This confirms our worst fears.

793
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:39,004
原子反应是明确无误的。
The atomic reaction is unmistakable.

794
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,006
我不明白。
I don't get it.

795
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:44,426
我是说，我不明白为什么那个炸弹客会出现在跑道上。
I mean, I can't figure out why that bomber was on the runway.

796
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:48,388
一架b-29在红色的空军基地做什么?
What would a b-29 be doin' on a red air base?

797
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,391
这根本说不通。
It just doesn't make sense.

798
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:56,831
对了，你不是告诉我我们在另一个岛上抓到的那个红色军官是空军吗?
Say, didn't you tell me that that red officer we picked up on the other island was in the air force?

799
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,064
是的。一个主要的。
Yes. A major.

800
01:27:58,148 --> 01:28:00,148
-你问过他吗?——不可能的。
- Were you ever able to question him? - Impossible.

801
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:02,861
-我试过了，但他一句话也不说。——哦。
- I tried, but he would not say a word. - Oh.

802
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,863
哦,谢谢。
Oh, thanks.

803
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,115
你和那个中国囚犯chin Lee谈过了吗?
Hey, did you talk to that Chinese prisoner, chin Lee?

804
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,665
他没有看见那个囚犯。
He has not seen the prisoner.

805
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:18,543
犯人没有见过他。
The prisoner has not seen him.

806
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:23,089
霍特，把便携麦克风挖出来放在鱼雷室里。
Holter, dig up that portable microphone and plant it in the torpedo room.

807
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:26,551
那就把犯人关在里面。别让他看到麦克风。
Then get the prisoner and lock him in there. Make sure he doesn't see the microphone.

808
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,553
——正确的。-拉他一把，斯基。
- Right. - Give him a hand, ski.

809
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:31,223
来吧。我们穿些干衣服吧。我们有工作要做。
Come on. Let's get into some dry clothes. We got work to do.

810
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,226
-你有计划?-我要搞清楚这到底是怎么回事。
- You have a plan? - I'm gonna find out what this is all about.

811
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,937
加油，chin Lee。我们有份工作给你。我们走吧。
Come on, chin Lee. We got a job for you. Let's go.

812
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,400
-你们都准备好了吗?——是的。
- You guys got everything set? - Yep.

813
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,402
好吧。
Okay.

814
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:47,781
你确定阿成·李完全明白他该说什么吗?
Now, you're sure chin Lee understands exactly what he's supposed to say, huh?

815
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:54,913
-他说什么?-他说他愿意为你做任何事。
- What'd he say? - He says he would do anything for you.

816
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:03,880
他想让你打他的脸让他看起来更真实。
He wants you to strike him in the face to make it look more real.

817
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:09,511
霍尔特。
Holter.

818
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,806
他想让你去做。
He wants you to do it.

819
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:16,393
他说你这样做不会痛。
He says it will not hurt if you do it.

820
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,656
你没事吧，孩子?你没事吧?
You all right, boy? You okay?

821
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:35,161
他的意思是什么?
What's he sayin'?

822
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:43,003
他说……犯人很聪明，一定是被愚弄了。
He says... The prisoner is very intelligent and must be fooled.

823
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:52,929
他想让你打他…困难。
He wants you to hit him... harder.

824
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,689
对不起,朋友。
I'm sorry, pal.

825
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:12,240
好了，把他弄出来。我们走吧。
All right, get him out. Let's go.

826
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:21,750
在这里。来吧。把他们。
Here. Come on. Take 'em.

827
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,719
这是难以置信的。
This is incredible.

828
01:31:55,802 --> 01:31:58,263
这是怎么回事，船长?
What's it all about, skipper?

829
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:01,349
这是有史以来最离奇的情节。
This is the screwball plot of all time.

830
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:05,812
他们会在朝鲜或者满洲投下原子弹然后怪到我们头上。
They're gonna drop an atomic bomb on Korea or manchuria and blame it on us.

831
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:11,568
他们将在明天黎明乘坐改造过的轰炸机起飞。
They're taking off tomorrow at dawn in that made-over bomber.

832
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:25,373
他发现了他!
He found him out!

833
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:41,241
让我有足够的地面，这样我就可以绕着
J“ let me have plenty ground so that I can hop around j“

834
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:44,285
请不要把我关起来
j“ not fencing me in, please j“

835
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:46,412
让我有个小房子
j“ let me have little house j“

836
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:48,414
J“竹席制J”
j“ made of bamboo mat j“

837
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:52,085
j "哦，请不要把我在的地方围起来"
j“ oh, please not putting fence around where I am at j“

838
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:55,213
j“我需要很大的空间，这样我才能摇摆猫j”
j“ I'm needing lots of room so I can swinging cat j“

839
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:24,576
现在听我说。
Now listen to me.

840
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:30,582
我要一个人去岛上。
I'm shoving off for the island alone.

841
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:34,502
我就停在这里，在洞口附近。
I'll park myself right here, around the mouth of this cave.

842
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:40,758
你会潜到离跑道半英里的地方，就在这里，这样你就能看到我的信号了。
You'll submerge half a mile beyond the runway, right around here, so you'll be able to spot my signal.

843
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:44,345
大量的燃料会让轰炸机飞得很低。
Now a heavy load of fuel's gonna bring that bomber out low.

844
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:50,059
所以当我给你信号…两个短，两个长，两个短……那就意味着飞机要起飞了。
So when I give you the signal... Two short, two long, two short... That'll mean the plane's taking off.

845
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:53,521
这样你就有足够的时间浮出水面开火。
That'll give you just time enough to surface and fire.

846
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:58,359
我要每把枪都投入战斗。
I want every gun in action.

847
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,820
这意味着每一个人。
That means everybody.

848
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:04,616
那架飞机必须被击落。
That plane has to be knocked out of the sky.

849
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:11,748
你一撞到它，就冲到底部，待在那里，因为当炸弹击中它的时候，一切都会失控。
Now the minute you hit it, crash dive to the bottom and stay there, because everything's gonna break loose when that bomber hits.

850
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:15,168
北边尽头有个小海湾，就在这里。我就藏在那里。
There's a cove at the north end, right here. That's where I'll hide.

851
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,851
明晚十点整，我给你三个短眼罩。
Tomorrow night at 10:00 sharp, I'll give you three short blinkers.

852
01:35:17,879 --> 01:35:19,797
接我。
Pick me up.

853
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:24,052
如果我没出现，你就离开，回家。
If I don't show up, shove off, head for home.

854
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:27,472
有什么问题吗?
Any questions?

855
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:30,892
我禁止这种疯狂的行为。
I forbid this insanity.

856
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:34,020
禁止你想做的一切，教授。那架飞机撑不过去了。
Forbid all you want to, professor. That plane is not gonna make it.

857
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:40,318
带回我们的怀疑得到证实的可怕报告已经够可怕的了。
It is dreadful enough to bring back the terrifying report that our suspicions are confirmed.

858
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:47,325
但我们不能承担起挑起战争的责任，不管我们感觉如何。
But we cannot take it upon ourselves to commit an act of war, no matter how we feel.

859
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,869
我们是平民!
We are civilians!

860
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:53,081
这次探险由我负责。
I am responsible for this expedition.

861
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:56,209
我命令你把这艘潜艇带回东京!
I order you to take this submarine back to Tokyo!

862
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,211
我不在乎你和你的探险。
I don't care about you and your expedition.

863
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:01,190
外面有一架敌方轰炸机伪装成美国轰炸机的样子。
There's an enemy bomber out there made up to look like an American bomber.

864
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:04,842
它会掉下史上最大的蛋，而我们要承担罪责。
It's gonna drop the biggest egg in history, and we're gonna take the rap for it.

865
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:07,178
我不喜欢那样。
I don't like that.

866
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:11,891
所以从现在开始，教授，这是我的远征。
So from now on, professor, this is my expedition.

867
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,447
队长!
Skipper!

868
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,449
船走了!
The boat's gone!

869
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:30,702
——什么?-船不见了。蒙特尔了它。
- What? - The boat's gone. Montel took it.

870
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:33,413
-那你为什么不阻止他?-我们没有机会。
- Well, why didn't you stop him? - We didn't get the chance.

871
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:36,308
他和她在甲板上。在我们知道发生了什么之前，他已经在船上走了。
He was on deck with her. Before we knew what happened, he was in the boat and gone.

872
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:38,251
-那个女孩在哪?-在桥上。
- Where's the girl? - On the bridge.

873
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:46,718
请。他不想让你阻止他。
Please. He doesn't want you to stop him.

874
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,220
你为什么不阻止他?你只要喊一声就行了。
Why didn't you stop him? All you had to do was yell.

875
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:52,181
他知道你的计划。他会执行的。这是他的命令。
He knows your plan. He'll carry it out. That's his orders.

876
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:54,726
这就是你们这些天才的问题所在……充满了伟大的想法。
That's the trouble with you geniuses... Full of big ideas.

877
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,853
现在你把一切都搞砸了。
Now you're fouling up the whole works.

878
01:36:56,936 --> 01:37:00,231
-你知道那个岛上到处都是士兵。-他也知道
- You know that island's crawling with soldiers. - He knows that too.

879
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:04,193
那你为什么让这么好的一个老家伙抄近路去墓地?
Then why'd you let a nice old guy like that take a shortcut to the cemetery?

880
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:06,279
他不是普通的二流教授，你知道的。
He's no ordinary two-bit professor, you know.

881
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:08,489
他是蒙特尔，他的领域里的顶尖人物。
He's montel, top man in his field.

882
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:11,453
但他又老又无助……除了试管，他什么都不知道。
But he's old and helpless... doesn't know his way outside of a test tube.

01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:13,614
你应该知道的。你和他合作得够近了。
You oughta know that. You work close enough with him.

885
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:17,665
-你没有感觉吗?——停止!

886
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,667
他是我的父亲。
He's my father.

887
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:23,463
什么?
What?

888
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:26,841
我的父亲。

889

哦，对不起，丹尼斯。

他说那是他要去的地方……不是你的。

我很抱歉。

893
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:56,788
她真的很有胆量。

894
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:59,290
我唯一不明白的是为什么会有这么大的谜团?
Only thing I can't figure out is why the big mystery?

895
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:01,501
她为什么不告诉我们他是她老爸?
Why didn't she let us know he's her old man?

896
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:05,755
这就是有个名人父亲的代价。
Well, that's what you have to pay for having a famous father.

897
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:08,341
她一生都在一个位置上。

想自力更生，她做到了。

看到他了吗?

901
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:31,406
不,还没有。
No, not yet.

902
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:37,954
他就在这里。
There he is.

903
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:41,416
这是他的信号。
And there's his signal.

904
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:46,587
战斗表面!枪行动!范围!

905
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:48,589
-你最好下去。——请。
- You'd better get below. - Please.

906
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:49,674
好吧。
Okay.

907
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:08,192
好吧,滑雪。我们走吧。

来吧,威利。乔托，上来。

快点起来。快点起来。

910
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:38,347
火!
Fire!

911
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:01,013
你对吧?
You all right?

912
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,725
——哦。-炸弹一定是在我们脚下爆炸了。
- Oh. - The bomb must have gone off under us.

913
01:41:04,809 --> 01:41:06,727
让她回到航线上。
Bring her back on course.

914
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:08,729
带她到潜望镜深度。
Take her up to periscope depth.

915
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:10,815
潜望镜深度。
Periscope depth.

916
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:17,780
各舱报告损坏和伤亡情况。

917
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:52,607
轰炸机并没有坠入大海。
The bomber didn't crash in the ocean.

918
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:57,361
它袭击了小岛。
It hit the island.

919
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:40,780
往家走。
Head for home.

920
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:54,502
每个人都有自己活着的理由，琼斯先生，也都有自己的死的代价。
Each man has his own reason for living, Mr. Jones, and his own price for dying.
