1
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:16,284
<i>In the summer of 1953,</i>

2
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:19,412
<i>it was announced
that an atomic bomb of foreign origin</i>

3
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:23,124
<i>had been exploded somewhere
outside of the United States.</i>

4
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:26,794
<i>Shortly thereafter, it was indicated
that this atomic reaction,</i>

5
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,796
<i>according to scientific reports,</i>

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,675
<i>had originated in a remote area
in North Pacific waters,</i>

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,762
<i>somewhere between the northern tip
of the Japanese islands</i>

8
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:37,764
<i>and the arctic circle.</i>

9
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:40,349
<i>This is the story of that explosion.</i>

10
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:38,527
Oh!

11
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:44,492
Professor Montel.
I'm McCleary of the <i>Herald Tribune.</i>

12
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:46,494
Oh, yes. How do you do?

13
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:50,081
I understand that you're going
to Vienna to address the, uh,

14
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,500
Central European Federation
of Advanced Scientists.

15
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,210
That is correct.

16
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:57,505
I will read a paper on the emission
of neutrons and collision of nuclei.

17
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:59,006
Thank you, Professor.

18
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,217
Will any of the American Atomic
Energy Commission be present?

19
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,551
I doubt it.

20
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,810
Will you excuse me, gentlemen?

21
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:33,291
<i>Oui.</i>

22
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,218
Professor. Excuse me.

23
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:46,470
There's one or two points
I'd like to get clarified.

24
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:56,147
You will have to excuse me, gentlemen.
The plane is waiting.

25
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,608
Who's the girl?

26
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:06,907
<i>This is the BBC
with the latest news bulletin.</i>

27
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:11,078
<i>Professor Montel, famous nuclear
physicist and atomic scientist,</i>

28
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:14,290

29

<i>Professor Montel's disappearance
is a complete mystery to the police.</i>

30

<i>Authoritative sources reveal today

31
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:25,634
<i>is the fifth noted scientist believed to
have vanished behind the iron curtain.</i>

32
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:29,305
<i>Professor Montel was last seen
at the International Airport in Vienna.</i>

33

<i>Speculation as to the whereabouts</i>

34
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:33,934

<i>Ten days have elapsed since the
distinguished scientist vanished,</i>

36
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:40,941
<i>and so far police have been unable
to offer any explanation.</i>

37
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:46,364
<i>Authorities are now convinced</i>

38
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,033
<i>that Professor Montel was not kidnapped</i>

39
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,911
<i>and that his disappearance
was part of a prearranged plan.</i>

40
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:54,955
<i>Airport officials in Vienna
reveal that the scientist</i>

41
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,583
<i>carried a diplomatic passport.</i>

42
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,127
<i>The search for Professor Montel</i>

44
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:04,673

45
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:07,968
<i>in newspapers in the United States

Pravda, <i>the official mouthpiece</i>
<i>of the Soviet Union,</i>

47
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:13,307

48
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,796
- Corporal Lee Stockwell?
- Right.

49
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,634
- Mr. R.J . MacDougall?
- That's right.

50
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:52,680
- Mr. Franklin Meredith.
- That's correct.

51
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:54,723
Jones!

52
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:57,601
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
My name's MacDougall.

53
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:01,188
You're a dead ringer for an officer
I used to know in the submarine service.

54
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:03,190
Sorry.

55
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:14,535
Mr. MacDougall?

56
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:16,537
Yeah.

57
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,622
My name is Eddy.

58
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,293
Your instructions.

59
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:32,303
There is a taxi waiting for you.
The driver knows the address.

60
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,638
Taxi number 63.

61
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,891
Number 63.

62
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,893
Okay.

63
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,666
This is it.

64
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:07,796
- You better wait for me.
- No, I go now.

65
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,924
Wait a minute. What if I need you again?
Where can I find you?

66
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,176
- What's your name?
- Eddy.

67
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:42,081
Mr. MacDougall?

68
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:46,043
- Yeah.
- Come in, please, and follow me.

69
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:57,846
Watch your step, please.

70
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,324
Now don't tell me
your name is Eddy too.

71
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:15,888
"Eddy" is the password.

72
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:18,033
I'm Hokada Fujimori, Commander Jones.

73
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:20,119
I'm very pleased to meet you.

74
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:25,082
Thanks. For a minute there, I thought
this was something out of <i>Inner Sanctum.</i>

75
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,296
Ah, you've lost a little weight.

76
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:33,465
I'm on a diet.

77
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:37,344
I'll bet Captain Taylor
put a little fat on, huh?

78
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:38,429
Where is he?

79
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:41,456
I'm sorry to tell you,
your friend is dead.

80
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:44,768
Dead?

81
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:48,731
His plane crashed returning
from an arctic expedition.

82
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:50,816
No one survived.

83
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:58,574
He never did like to fly.

84
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:04,204
Why did he want me to come here?
What was the 5,000 for?

85
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:05,497
It's an advance payment

86
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:08,542
for a job Captain Taylor
was certain you would do for us.

87
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:10,586
- Advance?
- Yes.

88
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,671
- When do I start?
- Without questions?

89
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:16,634
Why talk? If Taylor lined me up
for the job, it must be kosher.

90
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,470
Some people might not
exactly call it kosher.

91
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,555
In here, please.

92
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:36,362
Gentlemen, Commander Jones.

93
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,405
- Mr. McAuliff.
- How do you do, sir?

94
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,407
- Colonel Schuman.
- How are you?

95
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:42,743
- Mr. Aylesworth.
- How do you do?

96
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:45,204
And Professor Montel.

97
00:10:57,132 --> 00:11:00,010
- Montel, the scientist?
- Yes.

98
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:03,013
Everybody and his brother
is gunning for you, Professor.

99
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,432
They say you skipped
behind the iron curtain.

100
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:08,352
As you can see, only a wooden door.

101
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:11,730
- Glad you're here.
- Thank you, sir.

102
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:16,068
Well, it's quite a layout you got here.

103
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,989
What kind of business
are you gentlemen in?

104
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:23,075
The business of investigation.

105
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:27,037
The scientific investigation

106
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:31,125
of these uninhabited North Pacific
islands that lie in neutral waters

107
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,293
between the free world
and the iron curtain.

108
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:34,211
Uh-huh.

109
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,798
Our deductions make us
believe that one of these islands...

110
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:40,217
We don't know which one, Mr. Jones...

111
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,470
Has been prepared as an arsenal
for atomic weapons.

112
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:45,681
Your friend Captain Taylor
volunteered

113
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:48,016
to undertake a photographic mission
to find out.

114
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,018
- Volunteered?
- Yes.

115
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:52,020
- For free?
- For free.

116
00:11:52,104 --> 00:11:54,106
Is that when he had the accident?

117
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,400
It was no accident.
His plane was shot down.

118
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,736
This photograph we have just printed

119
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:02,156
came from the camera
of his salvaged plane.

120
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:07,286
Thirty years in the navy,
and he gets killed for a picture.

121
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,830
For free.

122
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:14,710
Each man has his own reason
for living, Mr. Jones,

123
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:17,796
and his own price for dying.

124
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,426
This was Captain Taylor's price.

125
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:27,598
There's nothing there, Professor.
It's a washout.

126
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:31,226
I wouldn't be too certain.
Extend these lines.

127
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,396
They could be atomic
vault constructions.

128
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,274
And over here could also be part
of a concrete runway.

129
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:40,235
Look. Look, before we go any further,

130
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,905
exactly what country
do you men represent?

131
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:47,034
We represent many countries,
as private individuals.

132
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:50,204
We are scientists,
former statesmen, businessmen.

133
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:53,248
All volunteers acting independently

134
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:56,835
for a common cause
against a common enemy.

135
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,837
As private individuals,

136
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:02,174
we can conduct this investigation
on a scientific basis

137
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:05,427
without violating any neutral waters.

138
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:08,138
And if what we suspect is verified,

139
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:11,558
we can then make our findings public.

140
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:13,435
And what good will that do?

141
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,813
Don't you think the truth
is worth knowing?

142
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,941
Don't you believe that factual proof
will establish, once and for all,

143
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:22,069
both the identity and the intention
of the aggressor?

144
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:25,948
Who knows?
But where do I fit into the picture?

145
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:29,993
We want you to command a ship
for an inspection tour of these islands.

146
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,412
- What kind of a ship?
- A submarine.

147
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:35,249
We know that four times
during World War I I,

148
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:38,085
you commanded a submarine
reconnaissance patrol

149
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,128
in this very area.

150
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:43,924
As I recall, you were extremely
successful in these waters

151
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,926
when you fought my country.

152
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,972
This time the enemy is different, Mr.
Jones, but the waters are the same.

153
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:52,558
You received already $5,000.

154
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:55,602
20,000 in United States currency

155
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:59,648
will be deposited to your account
in any bank you elect

156
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:02,442
to chauffeur Professor Montel
to this island.

157
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:06,989
And another 25,000 bonus
when you bring him back safely

158
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:09,575
with all the information he seeks.

159
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,621
What about the sub?
Did it volunteer too?

160
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:18,000
One does not pick up a first-class
submarine in the junkyard, Mr. Jones.

161
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,127
We have salvaged a Japanese submarine.

162
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,129
- What class?
- I-203.

163
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:25,340
Sewer pipe. Had one on my tail once
for six hours. Taylor look her over?

164
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:27,050
- Yes.
- Start getting her refitted?

165
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,136
- Yes.
- Armed?

166
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:31,555
Mr. Jones,
the object of this mission

167
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:35,517
is scientific investigation,
not combat.

168
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:36,768
Professor...

169
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:39,771
am I in command?

170
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:42,983
- That's right.
- Then we arm the sub.

171
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:46,194
That is, if you want me
to get you back in one piece.

172
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:49,573
Did you also salvage a crew?

173
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,659
We have picked volunteers,
experienced men.

174
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:54,828
There will be two scientists on board.

175
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:57,623
Professor Montel and his assistant,
Professor Gerard.

176
00:14:57,706 --> 00:15:00,292
We aren't positive which island it is,

177
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,503
but a certain freighter,
the <i>Kiang Ching,</i>

178
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,673
has been up to this area
several times before

179
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:09,635
with cargos of concrete
and heavy metals.

180
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:12,179
She's loading again at Tientsin.

181
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,890
The last time I tailed a freighter,
my price was 650 a month,

182
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:16,934
and I had to buy my own uniforms.

183
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:24,316
All right. I want my own key men,
men who've served with me before.

184
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,443
You name them, and we'll get them.

185
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,154
Like you got me, huh? For cash.

186
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:31,156
If it's necessary.

187
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:33,492
As I said before, Mr. Jones,

188
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:36,286
each man has his own reason for living

189
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,705
and his own price for dying.

190
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,083
I hope, for all of us,

191
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,086
that it will be a <i>bon voyage.</i>

192
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,146
<i>Giovane!</i> Help him with the line.

193
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,902
<i>Giovane!</i> You! You, Carpino,
give him a hand with the torpedo.

194
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:13,240
How many hands
you think I got, Neuman?

195
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:16,952
Mr. Neuman to you.

196
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:22,791
Now, make sure you give me
the reading on that battery.

197
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:23,709
Right, Skipper.

198
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,837
Come on. Come on!

199
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,798
Bring it on, boys.
Bring it around! Come on!

200
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:32,592
Hey! Come on now.
Easy now. Come on.

201
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:35,053
Come on. Come on. All right, hold.

202
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:38,015
All right, boys.
Make it fast to the cleats.

203
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:42,227
Hey.

204
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:52,446
- Don't you ever take a bath?
- Ah, shut up.

205
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:55,365
"Ah, shut up."
Is that the extent of your vocabulary?

206
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,951
What'd you ever give up
the wrestling racket for anyway?

207
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:00,996
I just found out it was phony.

208
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,914
That's the trouble with these...

209
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:05,125
I say, that's the trouble
with these phony wrestlers, Dugboat.

210
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,711
- They never take a bath.
- We do too.

211
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:16,303
Hey, Joto. Hey, Joto.
The after valve won't turn.

212
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:18,346
- What?
- The after valve won't turn.

213
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,348
No, no. The other way.

214
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:23,810
Everything backwards. No wonder you
blokes lost the war, with subs like this.

215
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:27,022
- Skipper.
- Yeah.

216
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:29,983
- That guy Welles... any good?
- Best engineer out of Australia.

217
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,320
- Wish we had Wilbur.
- Yeah.

218
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:36,239
With Charlie Wilbur handling
the engines on the <i>Bowfin,</i>

219
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,241
there was nothing to worry about.

220
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,994
Hear he's a three-striper now.

221
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:42,996
Yeah, so I hear.

222
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,582
Skipper,
that number two scopes don't work.

223
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,126
- What's the matter with it?
- Can't get the rust out of it.

224
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,170
- How 'bout number one?
- Didn't check it.

225
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,255
Lift her up, Holter.

226
00:17:57,302 --> 00:18:00,222
The professor topside
wants to see the captain.

227
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:02,224
Send him down.

228
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:04,810
He's part of the brass
behind this setup.

229
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,533
Now, if he looks familiar,
don't say anything . I'll explain later.

230
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:12,859
- Hello, Professor. Welcome aboard, sir.
- Captain.

231
00:18:12,943 --> 00:18:15,487
Well, we're trying to put
this sewer pipe together

232
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,031
with a little spit and a lot of sweat.

233
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:20,659
- I guess we'll make it all right.
- Captain Jones.

234
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:23,161
What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?

235
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:27,582
I'm sorry to say we cannot permit one
of your crew to make this expedition.

236
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,876
What do you mean?
They were all handpicked.

237
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,878
- We cannot trust this one.
- Who?

238
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:33,797
The torpedo man, Revnik.

239
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,799
Oh, one of the men you picked.

240
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:39,386
I could have told you that all the time.
A knothead.

241
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:42,556
Did you screen all <i>my</i> men too?

242
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:46,059
Very closely, including you.

243
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,854
- Okay. I'll get rid of Revnik right away.
- Good.

244
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,856
Holter, I want...

245
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:06,830
She the replacement, Doc?

246
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:11,459
Gentlemen, this is Professor Gerard,
my assistant and my right arm.

247
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:14,629
- Hiya.
- Denise, this is Captain Jones.

248
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,507
- Captain Jones.
- Glad to know you, Professor.

249
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,927
Well, if I'd known about this,
I'd have cut my price.

250
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:23,889
Boys, these two professors
are going with us as cargo.

251
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:25,891
- What?
- You heard me.

252
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:29,019
Have you blown a gasket? Nobody
takes a female along in a pigboat.

253
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,522
Look, junior, you gonna give me
that 2,000-year-old navy bilge

254
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,815
that they're bad luck?

255
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:36,526
Take a look at her.
What's so bad about that?

256
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,821
Nothin'. Absolutely nothin'!

257
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:43,033
Ah, they're all Jonahs.
It's traditional.

258
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,997
Look, Skipper, I made up my mind.
Count me out.

259
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:52,876
Okay.

260
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,878
Anybody else?

261
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:00,175
I'll give you jokers five minutes
to sleep on it, and remember,

262
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:03,428
if I have to,
I can replace every one of you.

263
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,056
Captain, I do not like it either.

264
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,320
Oh, <i>scusami.</i>

265
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:24,407
Perhaps you are right.

266
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:28,495
In your estimation,
I am a... a female.

267
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:31,456
But first I am a scientist
and a good one.

268
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:35,210
And I am not the only scientist
who is not of your sex.

269
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,337
There are many.

270
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,547
Like Dr. Lise Meitner,

271
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:43,760
who played an important part
in the development of the atom bomb.

272
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,389
Like Madame Curie, who
discovered radium.

273
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:50,892
I have grown up in laboratories.

274
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:53,687
All my life, I have worked with men.

275
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,439
Never have I interfered,

276
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,858
and never have they resented me.

277
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:05,115
Professor Montel and I have...
Have much to accomplish.

278
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,742
Much.

279
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:10,495
And I shall appreciate it

280
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:14,207
if you would not let my... my presence

281
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,294
be the cause of... of a minor mutiny.

282
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,020
I like you.

283
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:38,023
I like you all.

284
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,652
And I shall try my best
to make you like me...

285
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,824
as a scientist.

286
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,754
Man, that was quite a mouthful
for a female!

287
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:04,424
That's no female. That's a scientist!

288
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:07,177
All right. Come on.
We got a lot of work to do. Let's go.

289
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,937
Hi, Mr. Fujimori, Professor.

290
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:20,940
- Where's your assistant?
- Are you prepared to sail?

291
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:23,818
I'll let you know tomorrow
after we make the running dive tests.

292
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:25,820
There's no tomorrow left for us.

293
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:28,406
The freighter <i>Kiang Ching</i>
sailed from Tientsin a half hour ago.

294
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,784
- You must leave right away.
- What are you talking about?

295
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:35,121
We only been working for two weeks. We've
got a lot of work left to do on this tub.

296
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:36,873
You must leave by
dark to overtake her.

297
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,315
What about the running tests?

298
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,836
As an amateur, might I suggest
that we try the running test

299
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,838
while we are running?

300
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:46,758
Doc, there are about a hundred ways
of losing a submarine.

301
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,802
You've just come up
with one of the best.

302
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,887
We haven't even checked
the torpedo tubes yet.

303
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,516
You know what that means if we have
to call on fish? It means we're dead.

304
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,601
You've got to leave tonight.

305
00:22:58,103 --> 00:23:01,147
Okay, buster, you're buying this trip.
You want me to chance it?

306
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,025
It's not what <i>we</i> want, Captain Jones.
It's what must be done.

307
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:07,695
All right. Just as long as the professor
here knows what he's letting himself in for.

308
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:10,448
We've arranged airplane contact to
give you position on the <i>Kiang Ching.</i>

309
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:12,185
How'll they contact
us, blinker or radio?

310
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,350
Neither is without risk.

311
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,371
We've decided cork drop is safest.

312
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:19,124
This contains your code,

313
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:21,709
and this contains
your schedule for contacts.

314
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,170
Oh, just one more thing.

315
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:28,591
I want a clear-cut directive
detailing my specific authority.

316
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,052
You'll find it all in here, Captain.

317
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:33,513
At sea, you are in complete command.

318
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:37,183
On land, Professor Montel is in command.

319
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:40,645
May I wish you the best of luck?

320
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:42,647
Thanks.

321
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,720
Well, now's as good a time as any,
Mr. Neuman.

322
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:16,681
- Take her down to periscope depth.
- Yes, sir.

323
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:18,766
Clear the bridge!

324
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:24,147
Dive!

325
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:39,245
Stand right over there.
You'll be all right.

326
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:42,916
- Thank you.
- Professor Gerard, give me your hand.

327
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:46,085
Watch that top rung . It's murder.

328
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:48,087
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

329
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:50,089
You sit right here.

330
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:52,175
Captain, trim satisfactory
at periscope depth.

331
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:54,177
- Very well. Joto.
- Yes, sir?

332
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,930
Give Welles a hand with those starboard
engine blueprint translations, will you?

333
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,932
I'll take care of it, Captain.

334
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:01,226
Everything's tight
in the forward torpedo room.

335
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,395
We're gonna try her down deep.
Have all stations checked . Let me know.

336
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,773
<i>Ay, ay, Captain.</i>

337
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:10,193
This is that test we were
talking about today, Professor.

338
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,862
- Now?
- Now.

339
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:16,616
Don't get nervous. If we crack up,
you won't get a chance to feel it.

340
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:18,618
Take it easy. It'll be all right.

341
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,703
Put her on the bottom, Mr. Neuman.

342
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,789
Two degrees down bubble.

343
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,626
- Flood negative.
- Flood negative.

344
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,344
Oh, thanks, Chin Lee.

345
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:38,429
- Coffee, Professor?
- No, thanks.

346
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:41,015
- How 'bout you?
- No, thank you.

347
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:50,483
Two hundred feet, <i>Kapitän.</i>

348
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,329
Better hold on, Professor.

349
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,695
All right. Now let's see
if we can hit the roof.

350
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:38,531
- Take her up, Mr. Neuman.
- Close all main ballast vents.

351
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:41,868
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface.

352
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:43,911
- Surface.
- Surface.

353
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:50,501
- Blow all main ballasts!
- Blow all main ballasts.

354
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:00,094
What's with the air banks, Holter?

355
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:04,015
The air bank's dry.

356
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:06,643
Open the emergency banks.
Put 'em on the line.

357
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:08,936
They won't open.

358
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,189
They've got to open.
We've checked everything.

359
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:13,566
These signs are all fouled up.
I'll have to try every valve.

360
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,151
No, wait a minute.

361
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,946
Joto, come to the control room.
Unsnarl these Japanese signs.

362
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,492
I can translate it. That one reads,
"Open emergency air bank."

363
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:25,912
- What?
- "Open emergency air bank."

364
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:28,164
Go ahead . Try it.

365
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:34,921
- Air bank's on the line.
- Good . Thanks.

366
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:37,006
Okay. Put her on the roof.

367
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:51,979
- Skipper.
- Yeah. Everything all right, Carpino?

368
00:27:52,063 --> 00:27:54,899
Just a few leaks around the
stuffing glands. I marked them.

369
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,068
Okay. Make a full sweep, Ski.

370
00:27:57,985 --> 00:27:59,946
All clear, Skipper.

371
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:02,615
Rig for red . Up scope.

372
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,617
You better move out, Professor.

373
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:08,037
This helps get our eyes
used to the dark when we go up.

374
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,133
Open the hatch, Holter.

375
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:24,721
You did a good job
translating that sign, Doc.

376
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,975
Professor Gerard is MOL.

377
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,396
- MOL?
- Master of Oriental Languages.

378
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,899
Oh? <i>Très bon. Très bon.</i>

379
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,901
Down scope.

380
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,865
Glad to have you aboard, Professor.

381
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:48,411
Glad to be aboard, Captain.

382
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:13,519
Captain. The professor wants to know if
it's all right to come up for fresh air.

383
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:16,022
- Which one?
- The one with the beard.

384
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:19,275
Oh. Okay.

385
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,361
Come to course 355,
ahead full on both engines.

386
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:24,864
Ay, ay, Captain.

387
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:27,950
You won't need your umbrella, Professor.
She's a dry boat.

388
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:31,245
It's nothing to worry about.

389
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:35,208
Almost everybody gets a touch
of claustrophobia first time down.

390
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:37,794
It's not claustrophobia, Captain.

391
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:41,881
It's the realization that, at last,
our mission has begun.

392
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:45,885
If anyone had told me six months ago

393
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:49,388
that today I would be on a submarine
headed for arctic waters

394
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:53,142
in search of a secret atomic base...

395
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:55,728
- I just can't believe it.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

396
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:57,814
Well, uh...

397
00:29:58,356 --> 00:30:01,067
what about your assistant, Professor?

398
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,987
What makes a girl who looks like that
get mixed up in science?

399
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,907
She comes from a family of scientists.

400
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,076
She was a child prodigy.

401
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,286
At 14, she entered college.

402
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,581
At 18, she studied at Göttingen.

403
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:17,708
She is really very brilliant.

404
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:22,004
A child prodigy
with a body by Fisher, huh?

405
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:26,551
And this is the greatest pigboat
in the whole submarine service.

406
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:28,928
The USS <i>Bowfin.</i>

407
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:31,264
It's one we served on together...

408
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:34,725
Me, the chief, Gunner,
Dugboat and the skipper.

409
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:37,228
Beautiful, ain't she?

410
00:30:37,311 --> 00:30:39,689
Oh, yes. Very beautiful.

411
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:42,733
You know something else
that's very beautiful?

412
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:45,611
All my life I've been wanting
to find a girl called Denise.

413
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:48,781
Oh, Ski,
I'm sure you will find her.

414
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:50,950
Oh, I found her, all right.

415
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:54,787
You see, I lost no time at all
in learning your first name.

416
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:58,207
Yep. Denise. It's always been
my favorite name.

417
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,251
I... I never met a Denise,

418
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:02,295
but I always knew I would.

419
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:06,674
You see, from the moment I saw you,
I said, "Lafayette, I'm here."

420
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:12,346
That's right. I always knew
I'd meet a girl called Denise.

421
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,348
D-E-N-I...

422
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,434
Don't let him kid you, honey.

423
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:19,437
I just seen him put
your name on his arm.

424
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,981
- Look.
- All right, bub. You asked for it!

425
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:24,150
No!

426
00:31:31,032 --> 00:31:33,576
Come here, you big drunkard!

427
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:50,676
That's what I mean by Jonahs.
They were beefing over the dame.

428
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,137
Wasn't her fault. He's stiff.

429
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,222
- She okay?
- Yeah.

430
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:57,308
Just roughed up a little.

431
00:31:57,391 --> 00:31:59,393
Take care of him, Holter.

432
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:01,896
Oh, here, let me help you, Professor.

433
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:05,149
- Thank you.
- Let's see.

434
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:07,568
Boy.

435
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:10,488
I'm really very sorry about this,
Professor.

436
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:13,032
That drunk was a
last-minute replacement.

437
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:16,452
- He's all right when he's sober.
- I'm sorry.

438
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,205
This is the last thing I...
I wanted to happen.

439
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:23,042
It had to break out sooner or later.
Let's have another look here.

440
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:26,212
Whew! It's lucky you
still got your teeth.

441
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,346
Don't get nervous, Doc.
Nobody's gonna bite you.

442
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:39,976
Don't you think that the pharmacist
should treat me, if it's necessary?

443
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,687
He's got his hands full
with those two lugs.

444
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:47,233
Besides, there's nothing
he can do that I can't, you know.

445
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:49,819
Oh, my. He got you so greasy.

446
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:55,908
Okay.

447
00:32:55,992 --> 00:32:57,952
You know what a log is?

448
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:00,413
- Yes.
- You do, huh?

449
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:04,750
Well, I'm supposed to keep a detailed
report of everything that happens.

450
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:08,212
- It's for Mr. Fujimori.
- Mm-hmm.

451
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:11,090
How'd it start?

452
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:15,594
I was working on a new formula

453
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:19,265
when Ski asked if he
could show me his chest.

454
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:21,350
- Show you his chest?
- Yes.

455
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,811
Oh.

456
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:25,896
And then what?

457
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:30,276
Then he removed his shirt.

458
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,361
No kidding?

459
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:35,656
- He wanted me to see his tattoo.
- Oh, no.

460
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,785
- It was a beautiful tattoo.
- I'll bet it was.

461
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:41,787
- Beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

462
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:45,124
- But the intoxicated one rubbed it off.
- Naturally.

463
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:48,210
Tell me, uh, he make a pass at you?

464
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:51,922
- A pass?
- Did he try to kiss you?

465
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:54,633
Yes, he did.

466
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:57,720
He did, huh? Did you coldcock him?

467
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:02,558
- What?
- Did you hit him?

468
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,977
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

469
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:08,481
Hold the phone. Hold the phone.
Now, say that in English.

470
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:10,566
- I slapped him.
- You did, huh?

471
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,818
Uh, tell me, uh,

472
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:15,112
you hit him after he kissed you?

473
00:34:15,196 --> 00:34:18,032
- Yes.
- Not before, huh?

474
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:24,205
I do not understand.

475
00:34:24,288 --> 00:34:27,750
Well, you see, Professor, I just want
to make sure my report is factual.

476
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,752
- I couldn't put...
- Captain Jones.

477
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:33,672
Is this report for Mr. Fujimori
or for you?

478
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:36,258
- Uh...
- Mmm.

479
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:40,513
Now, really, a child prodigy oughta
be able to figure that one out.

480
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:42,681
Don't you think?

481
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:44,683
- Yes.
- Yes.

482
00:34:48,938 --> 00:34:51,148
<i>Au revoir,</i> Professor.

483
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:02,118
Now listen to me.

484
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,205
I don't want any more beefs,
you understand?

485
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:08,749
If I hear of anybody
making a play for that girl,

486
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:12,211
I'll personally shoot him out
through torpedo tube number one.

487
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:15,464
Captain, is it still a secret
where we're goin'?

488
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:18,551
We're tailin' a freighter
to an island in the North Pacific.

489
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,553
Gonna sink her?

490
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:23,389
We're gonna sneak into this island,
take a look and sneak out.

491
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:25,391
This is a scientific expedition.

492
00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:29,395
- But, Skipper, what are we lookin' for?
- Four-leaf clovers.

493
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:32,273
Well, what if the guys on the island
don't like us?

494
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:35,693
Look, I know you're all
itchin' for a little action,

495
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:39,155
but you'll only get it if we
have to defend ourselves, so relax.

496
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,218
<i>Capitaine Jones?</i>

497
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,019
<i>Le Capitaine Jones.</i>

498
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,951
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Bonne nuit.</i>

499
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:27,995
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

500
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:24,301
Oh, good morning!

501
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:27,179
- Was the water hot enough, Professor?
- Just wonderful, thank you.

502
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:30,849
- <i>Voulez-vous "fume" une cigarette?</i>
- What?

503
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,893
- I'm speaking French.
- Oh.

504
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:35,312
<i>Voulez-vous "fume" une cigarette?</i>

505
00:37:35,396 --> 00:37:38,983
Oh, you mean <i>"Voulez-vous</i>
<i>fumer une cigarette</i>?"

506
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,486
- That's what I said.
- No. <i>Fumer.</i>

507
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:45,114
- Foo-may.
- No, no, no.

508
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:47,700
You have to form your lips like this.

509
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:50,536
<i>Fumer.</i>

510
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:52,538
<i>Fumer.</i>

511
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:56,417
<i>Fumer.</i>

512
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,295
<i>Fumer.</i>

513
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:03,257
I think I better go now.

514
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,176
Thank you.

515
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,014
You know, someday I'm gonna
find out what color her eyes are.

516
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:14,184
Good morning, Captain Jones.
You wanted to see me?

517
00:38:14,268 --> 00:38:17,146
Why did you let me sleep
through that plane contact?

518
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:22,026
I thought you needed the rest.
You were on duty for almost 20 hours.

519
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:25,154
Didn't you stop to think
how important that message might be?

520
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,156
Of course.

521
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,993
So I made sure that it was not
by decoding it myself.

522
00:38:32,202 --> 00:38:34,496
As you see,

523
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,168
it reports only that the <i>Kiang Ching</i>
has made no change in speed or course.

524
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,420
I knew that was of no importance.

525
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:43,964
Professor, did it ever occur to you

526
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,550
that I might be steering
a course to be...

527
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:51,388
You've lost us approximately two hours!

528
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:54,058
I'm very sorry, Captain.

529
00:38:54,141 --> 00:38:57,311
- And I think I have learned something.
- I hope so.

530
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:14,745
If you want to listen in on conversations,
use the intercom . It's easier.

531
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:17,206
That conversation I would
prefer not to have heard.

532
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:20,626
- But I was waiting to see you.
- Okay, you see me. I'm busy.

533
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:23,295
Many years have I been
with Professor Montel,

534
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:25,839
but never before have I heard
anyone speak like you

535
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:27,925
to the greatest scientist in his field.

536
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:31,804
Professor Montel's field isn't commanding
a screwball submarine. Mine is.

537
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:33,889
If such rudeness is necessary,

538
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,975
I hope this will be a very short cruise.

539
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:42,314
What'd you want to see me about?

540
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:53,450
- Joto.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

541
00:39:53,534 --> 00:39:56,495
In the future, when a message
comes in to this boat, I get it,

542
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:59,289
no matter who says it's unnecessary,
you understand?

543
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:01,291
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

544
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:05,045
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

545
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,801
No, no, no, no.

546
00:40:10,884 --> 00:40:13,262
This time, he was right.

547
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,119
May we come on the bridge?

548
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:39,204
Sure. Help yourself.

549
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:43,292
Contact plane
approaching on schedule!

550
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,294
Good enough.

551
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:51,383
Okay, Charlie.

552
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:01,101
There it is!

553
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,539
Well, this one's for you, Doc.

554
00:41:22,623 --> 00:41:27,586
"Intelligence reports <i>Kiang Ching</i> carrying
unconventional-type 61 -J capsule."

555
00:41:27,669 --> 00:41:31,548
Signed, "Fujimori."
What's a 61 -J capsule?

556
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:33,592
The charge to explode an A-bomb.

557
00:41:33,675 --> 00:41:37,429
Hey, Skipper. Radar shows
surface object approaching,

558
00:41:37,513 --> 00:41:39,431
bearing 355 degrees.

559
00:41:39,515 --> 00:41:42,434
- Speed?
- Can't tell yet, but he's closing fast.

560
00:41:42,518 --> 00:41:45,229
- Range.
- 3,800 yards.

561
00:41:45,312 --> 00:41:48,106
Maybe the freighter has seen
our signal and comes after us.

562
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,190
Rig for red.

563
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:21,056
A sub's after us.

564
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:24,476
A sub? I thought this was
a scientific expedition.

565
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,603
It is, and we're gonna play it safe.

566
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,023
No use getting a bloody nose
unless we have to.

567
00:42:32,192 --> 00:42:34,653
She's submerged and listening for us.

568
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:38,115
- That's why she stopped pinging.
- What does this mean?

569
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:42,661
It means she's saving her torpedoes,
waiting till we surface.

570
00:42:42,744 --> 00:42:44,663
Just one more day, Doc,

571
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:47,749
and we'd have finished
overhauling those torpedo tubes.

572
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:50,002
Can you see her scope?

573
00:42:50,085 --> 00:42:52,379
No.

574
00:42:52,462 --> 00:42:54,464
Well, we can play possum too.

575
00:42:55,757 --> 00:42:56,794
How's the hydrogen?

576
00:42:56,819 --> 00:42:59,327
<i>Built up to three percent.</i>

577
00:43:01,263 --> 00:43:04,266
Well, we can't chance surfacing here.
We've got to make a run for it.

578
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:07,769
Professor, I think you'd both
better stay in your quarters.

579
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:09,771
Down scope.

580
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,043
They're still on our stern, Skipper.

581
00:43:44,014 --> 00:43:47,851
- How's that hydrogen gas?
<i>- Four percent and still building.</i>

582
00:43:57,486 --> 00:44:00,822
Take her up!

583
00:44:09,665 --> 00:44:11,583
Okay, Charlie.

584
00:44:40,362 --> 00:44:42,656
You better keep off the
bridge, Professor.

585
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:44,658
I'm not going up.

586
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:49,579
The skipper'd blow his top if he even
found you here in the control room.

587
00:44:49,663 --> 00:44:52,666
- Sit down, Professor. Grab some air.
- Thank you.

588
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,796
Have you identified the submarine?

589
00:44:57,879 --> 00:45:00,507
No. We haven't even seen her yet.

590
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,385
They're topside trying to spot her now.

591
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:06,221
No sign of her yet, Skipper.

592
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:09,433
Sonar tells us she's not far.
Alert the gun crew.

593
00:45:09,516 --> 00:45:12,477
- What?
- I know. We're not lookin' for trouble.

594
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:16,106
But we'd be fools
not to protect ourselves.

595
00:45:16,189 --> 00:45:18,108
Alert for battle stations!

596
00:45:18,191 --> 00:45:21,236
<i>Gun crew stand by to man the deck gun.</i>

597
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,991
What about these torpedoes?

598
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:31,329
You know those tubes haven't been
checked. Forget the torpedoes!

599
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:34,541
- Where is she now, Joto?
- Range, 1,500.

600
00:45:34,624 --> 00:45:37,085
Either she's moving out,
or she's gonna surface.

601
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:41,798
There she is, Skipper!

602
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:47,637
They're coming out on deck.

603
00:45:47,721 --> 00:45:49,681
Ask them where we are, Charlie.

604
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:52,017
- Why not man the five-incher now?
- No!

605
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,104
The minute they spot a crew near that
gun, they'll throw torpedoes at us.

606
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:02,277
What are they saying?

607
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,030
They want to know who we are
and what we're doing here.

608
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:09,201
Tell 'em we're a private scientific
expedition headed for the arctic.

609
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,709
They insist on boarding us.

610
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:20,253
Well, keep stallin'.
Tell 'em we don't understand.

611
00:46:20,337 --> 00:46:22,756
Ask them to repeat the message.

612
00:46:35,143 --> 00:46:38,688
Put one over our bow.
Keep asking them to repeat, Charlie.

613
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:45,028
Turn our nose into her. Steer 001.

614
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:48,073
And get ready to man that gun.

615
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,093
Keep clear of the lifeline!

616
00:47:16,643 --> 00:47:18,645
Right full rudder.

617
00:47:51,887 --> 00:47:53,763
Torpedo!

618
00:47:57,142 --> 00:47:59,060
Clear the deck! Clear the deck!

619
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:00,937
Dive!

620
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:20,123
Close the hatch!

621
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:30,175
My hand! My hand!

622
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:34,137
My hand!

623
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:38,308
- Give me a knife!
- No! No! No!

624
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:40,518
- My hand!
- No!

625
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:44,105
Here.

626
00:48:50,946 --> 00:48:53,198
- How is he? How is he?
- It's his thumb.

627
00:48:55,784 --> 00:48:57,744
All right. Get 'em all below.

628
00:48:57,827 --> 00:48:59,987
Hey, you guys! Come on up here!
Give me a hand, quick!

629
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:03,041
We ship too much water.
Can't hold her up.

630
00:49:03,124 --> 00:49:05,124
Get the angle off
and let her settle to the bottom.

631
00:49:05,168 --> 00:49:07,003
All back full.

632
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:21,685
Enemy torpedo fired.

633
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,777
Number two fish
out of their basket.

634
00:49:57,345 --> 00:49:59,806
Secure all running machinery.
Remain silent.

635
00:49:59,889 --> 00:50:02,058
<i>Bilge pump motor's flooded, Skipper.</i>

636
00:50:02,142 --> 00:50:04,686
Form a bucket line. Dump the
water in the engine room bilges.

637
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:08,857
That tub's laying for us, Skipper.
She's coming real close.

638
00:50:50,398 --> 00:50:52,025
I lost her.

639
00:50:52,942 --> 00:50:55,236
Nothing out of her now. No sound.

640
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:01,034
What do you think, Skipper?

641
00:51:01,117 --> 00:51:04,454
I think she's pulling
the same trick we are.

642
00:51:22,013 --> 00:51:26,017
Now watch that salt water. We don't
want any chlorine gas in the boat.

643
00:51:39,072 --> 00:51:40,990
Hold it.

644
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:45,036
Captain, this hot heat is killing us.

645
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,038
We got to turn on the fans.

646
00:51:47,122 --> 00:51:51,918
If they heard our fans, you wouldn't have
to worry about the heat killing you, boy.

647
00:51:52,001 --> 00:51:55,088
All right, I'll fill in the picture
for you quick.

648
00:51:55,171 --> 00:51:58,716
We got torpedoes, but our tubes
aren't in condition to fire 'em.

649
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,718
And the Red sub's parked
on the bottom like we are,

650
00:52:00,802 --> 00:52:03,638
waitin' to pick us up on sonar.

651
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:06,724
Once she does,
she'll throw more fish at us.

652
00:52:06,808 --> 00:52:11,771
So it's a question of who can hold out
longer without air... the Reds or us.

653
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:16,609
If we break first, chances are
it'll be our last break.

654
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:21,072
And we're loaded with hydrogen.

655
00:52:21,156 --> 00:52:23,658
We're liable to explode.

656
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,411
But we got one thing in our favor.

657
00:52:26,494 --> 00:52:29,289
We can save oxygen by shutting up.

658
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:32,584
That's all.

659
00:53:24,427 --> 00:53:26,387
Nothin', huh?

660
00:53:27,388 --> 00:53:29,307
Nothin'.

661
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:36,648
We gotta save juice.

662
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:42,654
Shift to red.

663
00:53:47,242 --> 00:53:49,369
Keep your ears open, Ski.

664
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:18,916
I am sorry, Captain,
for being so stupid.

665
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,461
That's all right. Save your breath.

666
00:55:21,544 --> 00:55:23,546
You had to use the knife.

667
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:29,302
If you didn't close the hatch,
we would all be dead.

668
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:33,556
You're beat.

669
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:37,560
You better get back to your bunk
and take it easy. Come on.

670
00:56:50,758 --> 00:56:53,553
- I want to tell you how...
- Shh.

671
00:56:53,636 --> 00:56:55,638
Don't talk.

672
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:33,050
Skipper.

673
00:57:35,303 --> 00:57:37,472
He's in a bad way.

674
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:42,101
I thought that hypo was gonna do the trick, but
he's sufferin' from shock and loss of blood.

675
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:49,525
If he don't get some air right away, you're
gonna have only one professor for cargo.

676
00:57:56,449 --> 00:58:00,369
There's 50 grand in that bunk.

677
00:58:00,453 --> 00:58:03,498
Fifty grand is worth a little air.

678
00:58:07,793 --> 00:58:10,004
Joto, turn on the white lights.

679
00:58:25,811 --> 00:58:29,398
Boys, I'm gonna try a long shot.

680
00:58:29,482 --> 00:58:33,236
If her first couple of torpedoes
miss us, we got a chance.

681
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:38,074
I'd rather pass out without air than
have a torpedo come plowing through us.

682
00:58:41,035 --> 00:58:45,373
Now when we start the pump,
we're liable to get a spark.

683
00:58:46,916 --> 00:58:50,461
Maybe it'll burn off the hydrogen,
maybe it won't.

684
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:53,172
If it doesn't,

685
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:56,676
we'll blow up so fast
you'll never feel it.

686
00:58:58,928 --> 00:59:01,222
Good luck to all of us.

687
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,157
- You got everything straight?
- Yes, sir.

688
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:38,926
Now here's where we find out
if we've lived right.

689
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:16,047
No more chance of explosion.
Pass the word along.

690
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,049
And build up the turns slowly.

691
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:20,092
- Hold down the noise.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

692
01:00:20,134 --> 01:00:22,303
- All ahead one-third.
- Yes, sir.

693
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:24,513
Take her up and level her
to 175 feet, Mr. Neuman.

694
01:00:24,597 --> 01:00:25,806
Yes, sir.

695
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:25,866
She's speeded up, Skipper.

696
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,952
Bearing 240 degrees.

697
01:01:28,035 --> 01:01:29,954
Right full rudder! All ahead flank!

698
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:40,005
- Stand by to ram!
- Stand by to ram!

699
01:02:23,758 --> 01:02:27,678
Range 200, bearing 010 degrees.

700
01:02:27,762 --> 01:02:30,473
Left full rudder!
Take her down to 190 feet.

701
01:02:30,556 --> 01:02:32,516
- 190 feet.
- Stand by to ram!

702
01:03:16,018 --> 01:03:18,646
All back, emergency!
Blow all main ballasts!

703
01:03:59,812 --> 01:04:01,355
Captain!

704
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:06,694
Captain!

705
01:04:43,022 --> 01:04:46,609
There you are.
Are you sure you're all right, Doc?

706
01:04:46,692 --> 01:04:49,320
- Yes, thank you.
- All right.

707
01:04:49,403 --> 01:04:52,197
Now take a good deep
breath of fresh air.

708
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,179
Feel all right, Dugboat?

709
01:05:15,262 --> 01:05:18,766
Yeah. For a quiet scientific expedition,
I couldn't feel better.

710
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:22,436

730
01:07:00,826 --> 01:07:03,829
You're wasting your time, junior.

731
01:07:15,257 --> 01:07:17,676
- Hi.
- Hello.

732
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,888
Say, uh, if that music disturbs you,
I could have it turned off.

733
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:23,098
Oh, no. I... I love music.

734
01:07:23,182 --> 01:07:25,726
- Oh. That?
- Mm-hmm.

735
01:07:25,809 --> 01:07:27,728
Well, how's the hand, Professor?

736
01:07:27,811 --> 01:07:29,813
Wonderful, Captain, as you see.

737
01:07:29,897 --> 01:07:31,607
Good . Glad to hear it.

738
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,401
- And how are you, Professor?
- I'm fine, thank you.

739
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:36,987
- Swell. You know, uh, when I...
<i>- Captain Jones!</i>

740
01:07:37,071 --> 01:07:38,906
<i>Come topside, please.
Freighter in sight of land.</i>

741
01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:40,115
Excuse me.

742
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:36,296
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

743
01:09:04,825 --> 01:09:07,119
I don't understand.

744
01:09:07,202 --> 01:09:09,580
Our intelligence report
cannot be this wrong.

745
01:09:09,663 --> 01:09:12,166
All we are getting is a normal count.

746
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:15,419
- You ought to be happy.
- Don't misunderstand.

747
01:09:15,502 --> 01:09:18,630
Nothing would please me more than to
know that our suspicions are unfounded.

748
01:09:18,714 --> 01:09:20,632
Then let's move out.

749
01:09:20,716 --> 01:09:25,220
There's nothin' here but this two-bit
garrison and some beat-up storage tanks.

750
01:09:25,304 --> 01:09:28,182
It's a great pity I cannot talk to them.

751
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:31,476
We are worlds apart.
But, after all, they are human.

752
01:09:44,489 --> 01:09:46,783
- Let's go.
- But Neuman.

753
01:09:46,867 --> 01:09:48,827
Forget it. Shot right through the head.

754
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:51,246
Let's get out of here.

755
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,211
Ski, try to
knock out that light!

756
01:10:50,722 --> 01:10:52,641
All right, come on!
Let's get outta here!

757
01:10:55,102 --> 01:10:57,020
You yellow dogs!

758
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,409
Come on, Ski. Give me a hand.
Let's get him in the boat.

759
01:11:52,492 --> 01:11:55,454
You wanted to talk to one of
these <i>humans.</i> I got one for you.

760
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:08,342
Wet down your coats.

761
01:12:40,582 --> 01:12:43,126
Well, they must be combing
the whole area for us,

762
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:45,670
but so far, nothin', huh?

763
01:12:45,754 --> 01:12:47,672
Not even a seagull.

764
01:12:47,756 --> 01:12:51,968
Hey, Dugboat, you sure this jelly I'm rubbin'
on my chest won't eat off my tattoo?

765
01:12:52,052 --> 01:12:54,137
What are you worried about?
You can always get another.

766
01:12:54,221 --> 01:12:58,141
Are you nuts?
That's my "piece de resistance."

767
01:12:58,225 --> 01:13:00,352
- Your piece de what?
- That's French.

768
01:13:00,435 --> 01:13:02,354
I been practicing, "nessie-pas?"

769
01:13:02,437 --> 01:13:05,857
You need more practice.

770
01:13:05,941 --> 01:13:09,820
<i>Captain Jones. Professor
Montel wants to see you in sick bay.</i>

771
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:16,114
Want more coffee?

772
01:13:16,139 --> 01:13:18,227
No. No, thank you, Chin Lee.
Thank you.

773
01:13:18,286 --> 01:13:21,415
This is wonderful.

774
01:13:21,498 --> 01:13:23,834
- You want to see me, Professor?
- Yes.

775
01:13:23,917 --> 01:13:26,128
Denise has just translated his orders.

776
01:13:26,211 --> 01:13:31,341
His name is Ho Sin. He's a pilot en route
to Kevlock Island for special duty.

777
01:13:31,425 --> 01:13:32,050
So what?

778
01:13:32,134 --> 01:13:34,761
Kevlock must be the island
Captain Taylor photographed.

779
01:13:34,845 --> 01:13:36,763
Well, how do you figure that?

780
01:13:36,847 --> 01:13:41,810
An air force pilot would hardly be assigned
to duty on an island without an airstrip.

781
01:13:41,893 --> 01:13:46,898
And as you know, Kevlock is the only island
indicated by name in this entire chain.

782
01:13:46,982 --> 01:13:50,402
It appears to be due north
of our present position.

783
01:13:51,445 --> 01:13:53,405
And what do you suggest we do about it?

784
01:13:53,488 --> 01:13:56,241
It seems to me our course is obvious.

785
01:13:56,324 --> 01:13:59,703
- Not in my book, Doc.
- What do you mean?

786
01:13:59,786 --> 01:14:04,291
I mean you said once that each man's
got his own reason for living

787
01:14:04,374 --> 01:14:06,877
and his own price for dying.

788
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,087
Well, my reason for living is 50 grand.

789
01:14:09,171 --> 01:14:11,047
I'm not sticking my neck out again.

790
01:14:11,131 --> 01:14:14,801
- Is one neck that important, Captain?
- It is when it's mine.

791
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:16,303
What kind of man are you?

792
01:14:16,386 --> 01:14:18,930
Hold it. Hold it.

793
01:14:19,014 --> 01:14:22,142
Let's not gang up
with a lot of double-talk.

794
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:24,144
I'm a businessman.

795
01:14:24,227 --> 01:14:28,148
Maybe to a couple of flag-wavers like
you, I'm a mercenary. All right.

796
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:31,109
But I lived up to my
part of the contract.

797
01:14:31,193 --> 01:14:33,403
The deal was to tail
the freighter to the island,

798
01:14:33,487 --> 01:14:35,447
put you ashore and get
you back to Tokyo.

799
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:38,575
Nobody said anything
about a second island.

800
01:14:38,658 --> 01:14:42,412
So as far as I'm concerned, mission
completed. We're going home.

801
01:14:42,496 --> 01:14:44,456
Any objections?

802
01:14:48,043 --> 01:14:50,253
Yes.

803
01:14:50,337 --> 01:14:53,173
I hate to use authority,

804
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:55,842
but if I have to, I will.

805
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:58,011
I didn't want it to come to this.

806
01:14:59,346 --> 01:15:01,932
But as long as you have
mentioned the contract,

807
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,017
study it closely, Captain.

808
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,354
You will find a paragraph
stating that I,

809
01:15:07,437 --> 01:15:09,689
and I alone,

810
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:13,193
shall determine when
the mission is finished.

811
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:15,445
And in my book, Captain,

812
01:15:15,529 --> 01:15:19,950
the mission will be finished
after I am taken to Kevlock,

813
01:15:20,033 --> 01:15:22,953
given the chance to examine the island

814
01:15:23,036 --> 01:15:25,080
and returned to Tokyo.

815
01:15:31,545 --> 01:15:33,463
- Joto.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

816
01:15:33,547 --> 01:15:35,507
- Head due north.
<i>- Did you say north?</i>

817
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:38,760
You heard me.
Set a new course for Kevlock Island.

818
01:15:38,843 --> 01:15:41,054
- It's on your chart.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

819
01:16:46,578 --> 01:16:48,580
Okay, Doc, let's go.

820
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:54,961
What's the matter?

821
01:16:55,045 --> 01:16:56,963
My knee.

822
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:58,917
I thought you said it
was okay this morning.

823
01:16:58,942 --> 01:16:59,698
It was.

824
01:16:59,758 --> 01:17:00,992
I'll manage in a few moments.

825
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:02,826
Not a chance. You'd
just be in the way.

826
01:17:02,886 --> 01:17:05,305
- It will improve by tomorrow. I'm sure of it.
- Sorry, Doc.

827
01:17:05,388 --> 01:17:08,350
We're not hanging around these waters
that long . This is a powder keg.

828
01:17:21,112 --> 01:17:24,658
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's
going on? What are you talking about?

829
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:29,245
Captain Jones,

830
01:17:29,329 --> 01:17:32,499
my assistant will accompany you.

831
01:17:32,582 --> 01:17:33,416
What?

832
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,794
She has sufficient training
to compute figures,

833
01:17:35,877 --> 01:17:38,713
determine strength and identify elements

834
01:17:38,797 --> 01:17:40,757
if there are any on this island.

835
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,759
You mean you'd... you'd let her go?

836
01:17:42,842 --> 01:17:44,636
With the exception of me,

837
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,764
Professor Gerard
is the only member of this expedition

838
01:17:47,847 --> 01:17:49,808
capable of performing this task.

839
01:17:49,891 --> 01:17:53,228
- Oh, you're both crazy.
- You will take her ashore

840
01:17:53,311 --> 01:17:57,023
and follow her instructions
as you would have followed mine.

841
01:17:57,107 --> 01:17:59,526
She is not going, and that's final.

842
01:17:59,609 --> 01:18:04,114
You still cannot take an order,
can you, Captain Jones?

843
01:18:04,197 --> 01:18:06,116
And what's behind that crack?

844
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:08,159
Exactly what you think is behind it.

845
01:18:31,558 --> 01:18:33,518
Ski, you stay here. Keep your eyes open.

846
01:18:33,601 --> 01:18:35,520
What about her?
I could carry her equipment.

847
01:18:35,603 --> 01:18:37,731
She can take care of her own equipment.

848
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:05,133
Psst!

849
01:19:41,461 --> 01:19:43,338
Take a look down there.

850
01:19:44,214 --> 01:19:46,341
Looks like a bunch of doors.

851
01:19:52,514 --> 01:19:55,225
I'm afraid we have found
what we are looking for.

852
01:20:15,662 --> 01:20:19,290
A Geiger counter reaction like this
can mean only one thing.

853
01:20:19,374 --> 01:20:22,168
These figures...

854
01:20:33,888 --> 01:20:36,099
What are they saying?

855
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:39,894
They are looking for Lumfong,
a missing soldier.

856
01:20:45,358 --> 01:20:48,111
We gotta stay put
till they move out. Come on.

857
01:21:07,797 --> 01:21:11,634
What did you mean when you said
I still can't take an order?

858
01:21:11,718 --> 01:21:13,678
Your record, Captain.

859
01:21:13,761 --> 01:21:16,806
In the war you were a very good officer,
except for one thing.

860
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:19,642
Go on. I'm fascinated.

861
01:21:19,726 --> 01:21:24,355
You could give orders,
but you couldn't take them.

862
01:21:25,565 --> 01:21:27,650
Now look, I...

863
01:21:27,734 --> 01:21:29,736
I know what you're talking about.

864
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:32,196
But if you want to know
what makes a guy tick,

865
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,157
you've got to look beyond the record.

866
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,492
Those Philippine guerrillas
were cut off and surrounded.

867
01:21:36,576 --> 01:21:38,661
They had to have
ammunition and supplies.

868
01:21:38,745 --> 01:21:41,789
I couldn't just sit there
on my can and let 'em die.

869
01:21:41,873 --> 01:21:43,666
I knew the waters were mined,

870
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:47,170
but I figured I could get in,
get out without a scratch.

871
01:21:47,253 --> 01:21:49,255
So I wrote my own orders.

872
01:21:50,798 --> 01:21:54,427
I lost my sub and 26 men.

873
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,681
And if I had to, I'd do it again.

874
01:22:19,661 --> 01:22:21,162
I'm sorry...

875
01:22:22,288 --> 01:22:24,290
very sorry.

876
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:28,336
It was wrong of me even to mention it.

877
01:22:29,796 --> 01:22:32,090
Forget it. It's all over.

878
01:22:42,809 --> 01:22:45,228
- You all right?
- Fine.

879
01:22:49,941 --> 01:22:54,153
When this is over, if we get back,

880
01:22:54,237 --> 01:22:56,197
what gives with you?

881
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:00,785
- Gives?
- I mean, what are you gonna do?

882
01:23:00,868 --> 01:23:03,746
Go back to Paris, I suppose, huh?

883
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:06,124
- Paris is my home.
- Yeah.

884
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:10,420
And you?

885
01:23:10,503 --> 01:23:13,506
When this is over, what gives with you?

886
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:15,508
I don't know.

887
01:23:18,219 --> 01:23:20,763
Have you ever been in Paris?

888
01:23:20,847 --> 01:23:22,849
No, never.

889
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:26,477
You would love it.

890
01:23:26,561 --> 01:23:28,855
Americans always do.

891
01:23:36,195 --> 01:23:38,698
Well, we can't stay here.

892
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:41,909
If they hold us up till morning,
we might never get back.

893
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:46,414
I'm gonna see if there's
another way out of here. Come on.

894
01:23:53,963 --> 01:23:56,507
You stay here. I'll be right back.

895
01:24:03,723 --> 01:24:05,641
Here.

896
01:24:05,725 --> 01:24:09,270
You won't need this, but sometimes
the sight of it's a comfort.

897
01:24:09,353 --> 01:24:11,355
I'll be back in a minute.

898
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:11,457
Lumfong!

899
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,802
Lumfong!

900
01:26:15,062 --> 01:26:16,898
Denise!

901
01:26:19,483 --> 01:26:22,445
Give me that. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

902
01:26:26,657 --> 01:26:28,659
Come on.

903
01:26:38,878 --> 01:26:40,880
Hurry up. Come on.

904
01:26:51,891 --> 01:26:53,184
Come on.

905
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,520
Let's go.

906
01:27:33,432 --> 01:27:36,519
This confirms our worst fears.

907
01:27:36,602 --> 01:27:39,021
The atomic reaction is unmistakable.

908
01:27:39,105 --> 01:27:41,023
I don't get it.

909
01:27:41,107 --> 01:27:44,443
I mean, I can't figure out
why that bomber was on the runway.

910
01:27:44,527 --> 01:27:48,406
What would a B-29
be doin' on a Red air base?

911
01:27:49,407 --> 01:27:51,409
It just doesn't make sense.

912
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,704
Say, didn't you tell me
that that Red officer

913
01:27:54,787 --> 01:27:56,789
we picked up on the other island
was in the air force?

914
01:27:56,872 --> 01:27:58,082
Yes. A major.

915
01:27:58,165 --> 01:28:00,165
- Were you ever able to question him?
- Impossible.

916
01:28:00,209 --> 01:28:02,878
- I tried, but he would not say a word.
- Oh.

917
01:28:02,962 --> 01:28:04,880
Oh, thanks.

918
01:28:04,964 --> 01:28:07,133
Hey, did you talk to that
Chinese prisoner, Chin Lee?

919
01:28:13,681 --> 01:28:15,683
He has not seen the prisoner.

920
01:28:15,766 --> 01:28:18,561
The prisoner has not seen him.

921
01:28:18,644 --> 01:28:23,107
Holter, dig up that portable microphone
and plant it in the torpedo room.

922
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:26,569
Then get the prisoner and lock him in there.
Make sure he doesn't see the microphone.

923
01:28:26,652 --> 01:28:28,571
- Right.
- Give him a hand, Ski.

924
01:28:28,654 --> 01:28:31,040
Come on. Let's get into some dry
clothes. We got work to do.

925
01:28:31,124 --> 01:28:32,054
You have a plan?

926
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:34,267
I'm gonna find out
what this is all about.

927
01:28:34,327 --> 01:28:36,954
Come on, Chin Lee.
We got a job for you. Let's go.

928
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:42,418
- You guys got everything set?
- Yep.

929
01:28:42,501 --> 01:28:44,420
Okay.

930
01:28:44,503 --> 01:28:47,798
Now, you're sure Chin Lee understands
exactly what he's supposed to say, huh?

931
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:54,930
- What'd he say?
- He says he would do anything for you.

932
01:28:59,352 --> 01:29:01,771
He wants you to strike him in the face

933
01:29:01,854 --> 01:29:03,898
to make it look more real.

934
01:29:06,609 --> 01:29:09,528
Holter.

935
01:29:10,696 --> 01:29:12,823
He wants you to do it.

936
01:29:13,866 --> 01:29:16,410
He says it will not hurt if you do it.

937
01:29:26,921 --> 01:29:29,673
You all right, boy? You okay?

938
01:29:30,674 --> 01:29:35,179
What's he sayin'?

939
01:29:36,222 --> 01:29:37,473
He says...

940
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:43,020
the prisoner is very intelligent
and must be fooled.

941
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:52,947
He wants you to hit him... harder.

942
01:30:00,746 --> 01:30:02,706
I'm sorry, pal.

943
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:12,258
All right, get him out. Let's go.

944
01:30:19,306 --> 01:30:21,767
Here. Come on. Take 'em.

945
01:31:53,817 --> 01:31:55,736
This is incredible.

946
01:31:55,819 --> 01:31:58,280
What's it all about, Skipper?

947
01:31:58,364 --> 01:32:01,367
This is the screwball plot of all time.

948
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:05,829
They're gonna drop an atomic bomb on
Korea or Manchuria and blame it on us.

949
01:32:08,374 --> 01:32:11,585
They're taking off tomorrow at dawn
in that made-over bomber.

950
01:32:23,347 --> 01:32:25,391
He found him out!

951
01:33:37,129 --> 01:33:41,258
♪ <i>Let me have plenty ground</i>
<i>So that I can hop around</i> ♪

952
01:33:41,342 --> 01:33:44,303
♪ <i>Not fencing me in, please</i> ♪

953
01:33:44,386 --> 01:33:46,430
♪ <i>Let me have little house</i> ♪

954
01:33:46,513 --> 01:33:48,432
♪ <i>Made of bamboo mat</i> ♪

955
01:33:48,515 --> 01:33:52,102
♪ <i>Oh, please not putting fence</i>
<i>Around where I am at</i> ♪

956
01:33:52,186 --> 01:33:55,230
♪ <i>I'm needing lots of room</i>
<i>So I can swinging cat</i> ♪

957
01:34:22,591 --> 01:34:24,593
Now listen to me.

958
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,599
I'm shoving off for the island alone.

959
01:34:30,683 --> 01:34:34,520
I'll park myself right here,
around the mouth of this cave.

960
01:34:34,603 --> 01:34:37,898
You'll submerge half a mile
beyond the runway, right around here,

961
01:34:37,981 --> 01:34:40,776
so you'll be able to spot my signal.

962
01:34:40,859 --> 01:34:44,363
Now a heavy load of fuel's
gonna bring that bomber out low.

963
01:34:44,446 --> 01:34:47,950
So when I give you the signal...
Two short, two long, two short...

964
01:34:48,033 --> 01:34:50,077
That'll mean the plane's taking off.

965
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:53,539
That'll give you just time
enough to surface and fire.

966
01:34:55,624 --> 01:34:58,377
I want every gun in action.

967
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:00,838
That means everybody.

968
01:35:00,921 --> 01:35:04,633
That plane has to be
knocked out of the sky.

969
01:35:04,717 --> 01:35:07,845
Now the minute you hit it,
crash dive to the bottom and stay there,

970
01:35:07,928 --> 01:35:11,765
because everything's gonna break loose
when that bomber hits.

971
01:35:11,849 --> 01:35:15,185
There's a cove at the north end,
right here. That's where I'll hide.

972
01:35:15,269 --> 01:35:17,869
Tomorrow night at 10:00 sharp,
I'll give you three short blinkers.

973
01:35:17,896 --> 01:35:19,815
Pick me up.

974
01:35:19,898 --> 01:35:24,069
If I don't show up,
shove off, head for home.

975
01:35:25,487 --> 01:35:27,489
Any questions?

976
01:35:28,782 --> 01:35:30,909
I forbid this insanity.

977
01:35:30,993 --> 01:35:34,037
Forbid all you want to, Professor.
That plane is not gonna make it.

978
01:35:34,121 --> 01:35:37,082
It is dreadful enough to bring back
the terrifying report

979
01:35:37,166 --> 01:35:40,335
that our suspicions are confirmed.

980
01:35:40,419 --> 01:35:44,882
But we cannot take it upon ourselves
to commit an act of war,

981
01:35:44,965 --> 01:35:47,342
no matter how we feel.

982
01:35:47,426 --> 01:35:49,887
We are civilians!

983
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:53,098
I am responsible for this expedition.

984
01:35:53,182 --> 01:35:56,226
I order you to take this submarine
back to Tokyo!

985
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:58,228
I don't care about you
and your expedition.

986
01:35:58,312 --> 01:36:01,148
There's an enemy bomber out there
made up to look like an American bomber.

987
01:36:01,231 --> 01:36:04,860
It's gonna drop the biggest egg in history,
and we're gonna take the rap for it.

988
01:36:04,943 --> 01:36:07,196
I don't like that.

989
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:09,490
So from now on, Professor,

990
01:36:09,573 --> 01:36:11,909
this is my expedition.

991
01:36:24,546 --> 01:36:26,465
Skipper!

992
01:36:26,548 --> 01:36:28,467
The boat's gone!

993
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,719
- What?
- The boat's gone. Montel took it.

994
01:36:30,803 --> 01:36:33,430
- Well, why didn't you stop him?
- We didn't get the chance.

995
01:36:33,514 --> 01:36:36,266
He was on deck with her. Before we knew
what happened, he was in the boat and gone.

996
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:38,268
- Where's the girl?
- On the bridge.

997
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:46,735
Please. He doesn't want you to stop him.

998
01:36:46,819 --> 01:36:49,238
Why didn't you stop him?
All you had to do was yell.

999
01:36:49,321 --> 01:36:52,199
He knows your plan.
He'll carry it out. That's his orders.

1000
01:36:52,282 --> 01:36:54,743
That's the trouble with you geniuses...
Full of big ideas.

1001
01:36:54,827 --> 01:36:56,870
Now you're fouling up the whole works.

1002
01:36:56,954 --> 01:36:59,166
You know that island's
crawling with soldiers.

1003
01:36:59,191 --> 01:37:00,273
He knows that too.

1004
01:37:00,332 --> 01:37:04,211
Then why'd you let a nice old guy like
that take a shortcut to the cemetery?

1005
01:37:04,294 --> 01:37:06,296
He's no ordinary two-bit professor,
you know.

1006
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,507
He's Montel, top man in his field.

1007
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:11,470
But he's old and helpless... Doesn't
know his way outside of a test tube.

1008
01:37:11,552 --> 01:37:13,632
You oughta know that.
You work close enough with him.

1009
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,597
- What kind of a woman are you?
- Stop!

1010
01:37:15,681 --> 01:37:17,683
- Haven't you got any feelings?
- Stop!

1011
01:37:17,766 --> 01:37:19,685
He's my father.

1012
01:37:21,478 --> 01:37:23,480
What?

1013
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:26,859
My father.

1014
01:37:28,193 --> 01:37:31,029
Oh, I'm sorry, Denise.

1015
01:37:31,113 --> 01:37:33,198
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1016
01:37:33,282 --> 01:37:37,202
He said it was his place to go...

1017
01:37:38,829 --> 01:37:40,831
not yours.

1018
01:37:43,375 --> 01:37:45,377
I'm sorry.

1019
01:37:54,761 --> 01:37:56,805
She's sure got a lot of guts.

1020
01:37:56,889 --> 01:37:59,308
Only thing I can't figure out
is why the big mystery?

1021
01:37:59,391 --> 01:38:01,518
Why didn't she let us know
he's her old man?

1022
01:38:01,602 --> 01:38:05,772
Well, that's what you have to pay
for having a famous father.

1023
01:38:05,856 --> 01:38:08,358
She's been on a spot all her life.

1024
01:38:08,442 --> 01:38:11,987
Wanted to make good
on her own, and she did.

1025
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:14,406
And he was proud because she did.

1026
01:38:23,165 --> 01:38:25,125
Any sign of him at all?

1027
01:38:28,629 --> 01:38:31,423
No, not yet.

1028
01:38:36,011 --> 01:38:37,971
There he is.

1029
01:38:39,431 --> 01:38:41,433
And there's his signal.

1030
01:38:43,852 --> 01:38:45,657
Battle surface! Gun action!
Down scope!

1031
01:38:46,688 --> 01:38:48,607
- You'd better get below.
- Please.

1032
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:49,691
Okay.

1033
01:39:05,874 --> 01:39:08,210
All right, Ski. Let's go.

1034
01:39:11,797 --> 01:39:14,633
Come on, Willie. Joto, get up here.

1035
01:39:28,146 --> 01:39:30,148
Hurry it up. Hurry it up.

1036
01:39:36,697 --> 01:39:38,365
Fire!

1037
01:40:59,404 --> 01:41:01,031
You all right?

1038
01:41:02,074 --> 01:41:04,743
- Oh.
- The bomb must have gone off under us.

1039
01:41:04,826 --> 01:41:06,745
Bring her back on course.

1040
01:41:06,828 --> 01:41:08,747
Take her up to periscope depth.

1041
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:10,832
Periscope depth.

1042
01:41:14,753 --> 01:41:17,798
All compartments,
report damage and casualties.

1043
01:41:50,122 --> 01:41:52,624
The bomber didn't crash in the ocean.

1044
01:41:55,252 --> 01:41:57,379
It hit the island.

1045
01:42:38,795 --> 01:42:40,797
Head for home.

1046
01:42:48,513 --> 01:42:52,058
<i>Each man has his
own reason for living, Mr. Jones,</i>

1047
01:42:52,142 --> 01:42:54,519
<i>and his own price for dying.</i>
