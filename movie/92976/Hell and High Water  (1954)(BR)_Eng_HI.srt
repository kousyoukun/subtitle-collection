outside of the United States.</i>

<i>according to scientific reports,</i>

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,675

I will read a paper on the emission

Thank you, Professor.

He never did like to fly.

101
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:04,204
Why did he want me to come here?
What was the 5,000 for?

102
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:05,497
It's an advance payment

103
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:08,542
for a job Captain Taylor
was certain you would do for us.

104

- Advance?
- Yes.

- When do I start?
- Without questions?

106
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:16,634
Why talk? If Taylor lined me up
for the job, it must be kosher.

107
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,470
Some people might not
exactly call it kosher.

108

In here, please.

109
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:36,362
Gentlemen, Commander Jones.

110
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,405
- Mr. McAuliff.
- How do you do, sir?

111
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,407
- Colonel Schuman.
- How are you?

- Mr. Aylesworth.
- How do you do?

113
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:45,204
And Professor Montel.

114
00:10:57,132 --> 00:11:00,010
- Montel, the scientist?
- Yes.

115
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:03,013
Everybody and his brother
is gunning for you, Professor.

116
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:05,432
They say you skipped
behind the iron curtain.

117
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:08,352
As you can see, only a wooden door.

118
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:11,730
- Glad you're here.
- Thank you, sir.

119
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:16,068
Well, it's quite a layout you got here.

120
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,989
What kind of business
are you gentlemen in?

121
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:23,075
The business of investigation.

122
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:27,037
The scientific investigation

123
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:31,125
of these uninhabited North Pacific
islands that lie in neutral waters

124
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,293
between the free world
and the iron curtain.

125
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:34,211
Uh-huh.

126
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,798
[Fujimori] Our deductions make us
believe that one of these islands...

127
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:40,217
We don't know which one, Mr. Jones...

128
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,470
Has been prepared as an arsenal
for atomic weapons.

129
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:45,681
Your friend Captain Taylor
volunteered

130
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:48,016
to undertake a photographic mission
to find out.

131
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,018
- Volunteered?
- Yes.

132
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:52,020
- For free?
- For free.

133
00:11:52,104 --> 00:11:54,106
Is that when he had the accident?

134
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,400
It was no accident.
His plane was shot down.

135
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,736
This photograph we have just printed

136
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:02,156
came from the camera
of his salvaged plane.

137
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:07,286
Thirty years in the navy,
and he gets killed for a picture.

138
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,830
For free.

139
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:14,710
Each man has his own reason
for living, Mr. Jones,

140
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:17,796
and his own price for dying.

141
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,426
This was Captain Taylor's price.

142
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:27,598
There's nothing there, Professor.
It's a washout.

143
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:31,226
I wouldn't be too certain.
Extend these lines.

144
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,396
They could be atomic
vault constructions.

145
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,274
And over here could also be part
of a concrete runway.

146
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:40,235
Look. Look, before we go any further,

147
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,905
exactly what country
do you men represent?

148
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:47,034
We represent many countries,
as private individuals.

149
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:50,204
We are scientists,
former statesmen, businessmen.

150
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:53,248
All volunteers acting independently

151
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:56,835
for a common cause
against a common enemy.

152
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,837
As private individuals,

153
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:02,174
we can conduct this investigation
on a scientific basis

154
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:05,427
without violating any neutral waters.

155
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:08,138
And if what we suspect is verified,

156
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:11,558
we can then make our findings public.

157
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:13,435
And what good will that do?

158
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,813
Don't you think the truth
is worth knowing?

159
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,941
Don't you believe that factual proof
will establish, once and for all,

160
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:22,069
both the identity and the intention
of the aggressor?

161
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:25,948
Who knows?
But where do I fit into the picture?

162
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:29,993
We want you to command a ship
for an inspection tour of these islands.

163
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,412
- What kind of a ship?
- A submarine.

164
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:35,249
We know that four times
during World War I I,

165
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:38,085
you commanded a submarine
reconnaissance patrol

166
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,128
in this very area.

167
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:43,924
As I recall, you were extremely
successful in these waters

168
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,926
when you fought my country.

169
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,972
This time the enemy is different, Mr.
Jones, but the waters are the same.

170
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:52,558
You received already $5,000.

171
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:55,602
20,000 in United States currency

172
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:59,648
will be deposited to your account
in any bank you elect

173
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:02,442
to chauffeur Professor Montel
to this island.

174
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:06,989
And another 25,000 bonus
when you bring him back safely

175
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:09,575
with all the information he seeks.

176
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,621
What about the sub?
Did it volunteer too?

177
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:18,000
One does not pick up a first-class
submarine in the junkyard, Mr. Jones.

178
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,127
We have salvaged a Japanese submarine.

179
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,129
- What class?
- I-203.

180
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:25,340
Sewer pipe. Had one on my tail once
for six hours. Taylor look her over?

181
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:27,050
- Yes.
- Start getting her refitted?

182
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,136
- Yes.
- Armed?

183
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:31,555
Mr. Jones,
the object of this mission

184
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:35,517
is scientific investigation,
not combat.

185
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:36,768
Professor...

186
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:39,771
am I in command?

187
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:42,983
- That's right.
- Then we arm the sub.

188
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:46,194
That is, if you want me
to get you back in one piece.

189
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:49,573
Did you also salvage a crew?

190
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,659
We have picked volunteers,
experienced men.

191
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:54,828
There will be two scientists on board.

192
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:57,623
Professor Montel and his assistant,
Professor Gerard.

193
00:14:57,706 --> 00:15:00,292
We aren't positive which island it is,

194
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,503
but a certain freighter,
the <i>Kiang Ching,</i>

195
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,673
has been up to this area
several times before

196
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:09,635
with cargos of concrete
and heavy metals.

197
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:12,179
She's loading again at Tientsin.

198
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,890
The last time I tailed a freighter,
my price was 650 a month,

199
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:16,934
and I had to buy my own uniforms.

200
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:24,316
All right. I want my own key men,
men who've served with me before.

201
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,443
You name them, and we'll get them.

202
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,154
Like you got me, huh? For cash.

203
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:31,156
If it's necessary.

204
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:33,492
As I said before, Mr. Jones,

205
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:36,286
each man has his own reason for living

206
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,705
and his own price for dying.

207
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,083
I hope, for all of us,

208
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,086
that it will be a <i>bon voyage.</i>

209
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,146
<i>Giovane!</i> Help him with the line.

210
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,148
[speaking German]

211
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,902
<i>Giovane!</i> You! You, Carpino,
give him a hand with the torpedo.

212
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:11,113
[both speaking Italian]

213
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:13,240
How many hands
you think I got, Neuman?

214
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:16,952
- Mr. Neuman to you.
- [continues in Italian]

215
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:22,791
Now, make sure you give me
the reading on that battery.

216
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:23,709
[man] Right, Skipper.

217
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,837
Come on. Come on!

218
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,798
Bring it on, boys.
Bring it around! Come on!

219
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:32,592
Hey! Come on now.
Easy now. Come on.

220
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:35,053
Come on. Come on. All right, hold.

221
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:38,015
All right, boys.
Make it fast to the cleats.

222
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:42,227
Hey. [muttering]

223
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:52,446
- Don't you ever take a bath?
- Ah, shut up.

224
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:55,365
"Ah, shut up."
Is that the extent of your vocabulary?

225
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,951
What'd you ever give up
the wrestling racket for anyway?

226
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:00,996
I just found out it was phony.

227
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,914
That's the trouble with these...

228
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:05,125
I say, that's the trouble
with these phony wrestlers, Dugboat.

229
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,711
- They never take a bath.
- We do too.

230
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:16,303
Hey, Joto. Hey, Joto.
The after valve won't turn.

231
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:18,346
- What?
- The after valve won't turn.

232
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,348
No, no. The other way.

233
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:23,810
Everything backwards. No wonder you
blokes lost the war, with subs like this.

234
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:27,022
- Skipper.
- Yeah.

235
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:29,983
- That guy Welles... any good?
- Best engineer out of Australia.

236
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,320
- Wish we had Wilbur.
- Yeah.

237
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:36,239
With Charlie Wilbur handling
the engines on the <i>Bowfin,</i>

238
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,241
there was nothing to worry about.

239
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,994
Hear he's a three-striper now.

240
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:42,996
Yeah, so I hear.

241
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,582
Skipper,
that number two scopes don't work.

242
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,126
- What's the matter with it?
- Can't get the rust out of it.

243
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,170
- How 'bout number one?
- Didn't check it.

244
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,255
Lift her up, Holter.

245
00:17:57,302 --> 00:18:00,222
The professor topside
wants to see the captain.

246
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:02,224
Send him down.

247
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:04,810
He's part of the brass
behind this setup.

248
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,533
Now, if he looks familiar,
don't say anything . I'll explain later.

249
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:12,859
- Hello, Professor. Welcome aboard, sir.
- Captain.

250
00:18:12,943 --> 00:18:15,487
Well, we're trying to put
this sewer pipe together

251
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,031
with a little spit and a lot of sweat.

252
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:20,659
- I guess we'll make it all right.
- Captain Jones.

253
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:23,161
What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?

254
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:27,582
I'm sorry to say we cannot permit one
of your crew to make this expedition.

255
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,876
What do you mean?
They were all handpicked.

256
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,878
- We cannot trust this one.
- Who?

257
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:33,797
The torpedo man, Revnik.

258
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,799
Oh, one of the men you picked.

259
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:39,386
I could have told you that all the time.
A knothead.

260
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:42,556
Did you screen all <i>my</i> men too?

261
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:46,059
Very closely, including you.

262
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,854
- Okay. I'll get rid of Revnik right away.
- Good.

263
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,856
Holter, I want...

264
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:06,830
- She the replacement, Doc?
- [tool clatters]

265
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:11,459
Gentlemen, this is Professor Gerard,
my assistant and my right arm.

266
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:14,629
- [man] Hiya.
- Denise, this is Captain Jones.

267
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,507
- Captain Jones.
- Glad to know you, Professor.

268
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,927
Well, if I'd known about this,
I'd have cut my price.

269
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:23,889
Boys, these two professors
are going with us as cargo.

270
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:25,891
- What?
- You heard me.

271
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:29,019
Have you blown a gasket? Nobody
takes a female along in a pigboat.

272
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,522
Look, junior, you gonna give me
that 2,000-year-old navy bilge

273
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,815
that they're bad luck?

274
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:36,526
Take a look at her.
What's so bad about that?

275
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,821
Nothin'. Absolutely nothin'!

276
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:43,033
Ah, they're all Jonahs.
It's traditional.

277
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,411
[both speaking French]

278
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,997
Look, Skipper, I made up my mind.
Count me out.

279
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:52,876
Okay.

280
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,878
Anybody else?

281
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:00,175
I'll give you jokers five minutes
to sleep on it, and remember,

282
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:03,428
if I have to,
I can replace every one of you.

283
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,056
Captain, I do not like it either.

284
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,142
[speaking German]

285
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,145
[speaking German]

286
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:15,315
[speaking Italian]

287
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:17,400
[speaking Italian]

288
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,320
Oh, <i>scusami.</i>

289
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:24,407
Perhaps you are right.

290
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:28,495
In your estimation,
I am a... a female.

291
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:31,456
But first I am a scientist
and a good one.

292
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:35,210
And I am not the only scientist
who is not of your sex.

293
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,337
There are many.

294
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,547
Like Dr. Lise Meitner,

295
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:43,760
who played an important part
in the development of the atom bomb.

296
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,389
Like Madame Curie, who
discovered radium.

297
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:50,892
I have grown up in laboratories.

298
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:53,687
All my life, I have worked with men.

299
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,439
Never have I interfered,

300
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,858
and never have they resented me.

301
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:05,115
Professor Montel and I have...
Have much to accomplish.

302
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,742
Much.

303
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:10,495
And I shall appreciate it

304
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:14,207
if you would not let my... my presence

305
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,294
be the cause of... of a minor mutiny.

306
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,020
I like you.

307
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:38,023
I like you all.

308
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,652
And I shall try my best
to make you like me...

309
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,824
as a scientist.

310
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,754
Man, that was quite a mouthful
for a female!

311
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:04,424
- [laughing]
- That's no female. That's a scientist!

312
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:07,177
All right. Come on.
We got a lot of work to do. Let's go.

313
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,937
Hi, Mr. Fujimori, Professor.

314
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:20,940
- Where's your assistant?
- Are you prepared to sail?

315
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:23,818
I'll let you know tomorrow
after we make the running dive tests.

316
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:25,820
There's no tomorrow left for us.

317
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:28,406
The freighter <i>Kiang Ching</i>
sailed from Tientsin a half hour ago.

318
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,784
- You must leave right away.
- What are you talking about?

319
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:35,121
We only been working for two weeks. We've
got a lot of work left to do on this tub.

320
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:36,873
You must leave by
dark to overtake her.

321
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,315
What about the running tests?

322
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,836
As an amateur, might I suggest
that we try the running test

323
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,838
while we are running?

324
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:46,758
Doc, there are about a hundred ways
of losing a submarine.

325
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,802
You've just come up
with one of the best.

326
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,887
We haven't even checked
the torpedo tubes yet.

327
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,516
You know what that means if we have
to call on fish? It means we're dead.

328
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,601
You've got to leave tonight.

329
00:22:58,103 --> 00:23:01,147
Okay, buster, you're buying this trip.
You want me to chance it?

330
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,025
It's not what <i>we</i> want, Captain Jones.
It's what must be done.

331
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:07,695
All right. Just as long as the professor
here knows what he's letting himself in for.

332
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:10,448
We've arranged airplane contact to
give you position on the <i>Kiang Ching.</i>

333
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:12,185
How'll they contact
us, blinker or radio?

334
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,350
Neither is without risk.

335
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,371
We've decided cork drop is safest.

336
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:19,124
This contains your code,

337
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:21,709
and this contains
your schedule for contacts.

338
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,170
Oh, just one more thing.

339
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:28,591
I want a clear-cut directive
detailing my specific authority.

340
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,052
You'll find it all in here, Captain.

341
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:33,513
At sea, you are in complete command.

342
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:37,183
On land, Professor Montel is in command.

343
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:40,645
May I wish you the best of luck?

344
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:42,647
Thanks.

345
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,720
Well, now's as good a time as any,
Mr. Neuman.

346
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:16,681
- Take her down to periscope depth.
- Yes, sir.

347
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:18,766
Clear the bridge!

348
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:24,147
- Dive!
- [klaxon blaring]

349
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:39,245
Stand right over there.
You'll be all right.

350
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:42,916
- Thank you.
- Professor Gerard, give me your hand.

351
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:46,085
Watch that top rung . It's murder.

352
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:48,087
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

353
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:50,089
You sit right here. [slaps]

354
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:52,175
Captain, trim satisfactory
at periscope depth.

355
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:54,177
- Very well. Joto.
- Yes, sir?

356
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,930
Give Welles a hand with those starboard
engine blueprint translations, will you?

357
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,932
I'll take care of it, Captain.

358
00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:01,226
[man] Everything's tight
in the forward torpedo room.

359
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,395
We're gonna try her down deep.
Have all stations checked . Let me know.

360
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,773
[man on intercom] <i>Ay, ay, Captain.</i>

361
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:10,193
This is that test we were
talking about today, Professor.

362
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,862
- Now?
- Now.

363
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:16,616
Don't get nervous. If we crack up,
you won't get a chance to feel it.

364
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:18,618
Take it easy. It'll be all right.

365
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,703
Put her on the bottom, Mr. Neuman.

366
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,789
Two degrees down bubble.

367
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,626
- Flood negative.
- Flood negative.

368
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,344
Oh, thanks, Chin Lee.

369
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:38,429
- Coffee, Professor?
- No, thanks.

370
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:41,015
- How 'bout you?
- No, thank you.

371
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:50,483
Two hundred feet, <i>Kapitän.</i>

372
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,329
Better hold on, Professor.

373
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,695
All right. Now let's see
if we can hit the roof.

374
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:38,531
- Take her up, Mr. Neuman.
- Close all main ballast vents.

375
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:41,868
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface.

376
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:43,911
- Surface.
- Surface.

377
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:47,248
[klaxon blaring]

378
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:50,501
- Blow all main ballasts!
- Blow all main ballasts.

379
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:00,094
What's with the air banks, Holter?

380
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:04,015
The air bank's dry.

381
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:06,643
Open the emergency banks.
Put 'em on the line.

382
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:08,936
They won't open.

383
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,189
They've got to open.
We've checked everything.

384
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:13,566
These signs are all fouled up.
I'll have to try every valve.

385
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,151
No, wait a minute.

386
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,946
Joto, come to the control room.
Unsnarl these Japanese signs.

387
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,492
I can translate it. That one reads,
"Open emergency air bank."

388
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:25,912
- What?
- "Open emergency air bank."

389
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:28,164
Go ahead . Try it.

390
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,084
[air hissing]

391
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:34,921
- Air bank's on the line.
- Good . Thanks.

392
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:37,006
Okay. Put her on the roof.

393
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:51,979
- Skipper.
- Yeah. Everything all right, Carpino?

394
00:27:52,063 --> 00:27:54,899
Just a few leaks around the
stuffing glands. I marked them.

395
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,068
Okay. Make a full sweep, Ski.

396
00:27:57,985 --> 00:27:59,946
All clear, Skipper.

397
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:02,615
Rig for red . Up scope.

398
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,617
You better move out, Professor.

399
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:08,037
This helps get our eyes
used to the dark when we go up.

400
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,133
Open the hatch, Holter.

401
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:24,721
You did a good job
translating that sign, Doc.

402
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,975
Professor Gerard is MOL.

403
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,396
- MOL?
- Master of Oriental Languages.

404
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,899
Oh? <i>Très bon. Très bon.</i>

405
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,901
Down scope.

406
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,865
Glad to have you aboard, Professor.

407
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:48,411
Glad to be aboard, Captain.

408
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:13,519
Captain. The professor wants to know if
it's all right to come up for fresh air.

409
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:16,022
- Which one?
- The one with the beard.

410
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:19,275
Oh. Okay.

411
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,361
Come to course 355,
ahead full on both engines.

412
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:24,864
Ay, ay, Captain.

413
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:27,950
You won't need your umbrella, Professor.
She's a dry boat.

414
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:31,245
It's nothing to worry about.

415
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:35,208
Almost everybody gets a touch
of claustrophobia first time down.

416
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:37,794
It's not claustrophobia, Captain.

417
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:41,881
It's the realization that, at last,
our mission has begun.

418
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:45,885
If anyone had told me six months ago

419
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:49,388
that today I would be on a submarine
headed for arctic waters

420
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:53,142
in search of a secret atomic base...

421
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:55,728
- I just can't believe it.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

422
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:57,814
Well, uh...

423
00:29:58,356 --> 00:30:01,067
what about your assistant, Professor?

424
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,987
What makes a girl who looks like that
get mixed up in science?

425
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,907
She comes from a family of scientists.

426
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,076
She was a child prodigy.

427
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,286
At 14, she entered college.

428
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,581
At 18, she studied at Göttingen.

429
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:17,708
She is really very brilliant.

430
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:22,004
[chuckles] A child prodigy
with a body by Fisher, huh?

431
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:26,551
And this is the greatest pigboat
in the whole submarine service.

432
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:28,928
The USS <i>Bowfin.</i>

433
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:31,264
It's one we served on together...

434
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:34,725
Me, the chief, Gunner,
Dugboat and the skipper.

435
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:37,228
[chuckles] Beautiful, ain't she?

436
00:30:37,311 --> 00:30:39,689
Oh, yes. Very beautiful.

437
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:42,733
You know something else
that's very beautiful?

438
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:45,611
All my life I've been wanting
to find a girl called Denise.

439
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:48,781
[chuckles] Oh, Ski,
I'm sure you will find her.

440
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:50,950
Oh, I found her, all right.

441
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:54,787
You see, I lost no time at all
in learning your first name.

442
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:58,207
Yep. Denise. It's always been
my favorite name.

443
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,251
I... I never met a Denise,

444
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:02,295
but I always knew I would.

445
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:06,674
You see, from the moment I saw you,
I said, "Lafayette, I'm here."

446
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:09,260
[both laughing]

447
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:12,346
That's right. I always knew
I'd meet a girl called Denise.

448
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,348
D-E-N-I...

449
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,434
Don't let him kid you, honey.

450
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:19,437
I just seen him put
your name on his arm.

451
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,981
- Look.
- All right, bub. You asked for it!

452
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:24,150
No! [speaking French]

453
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,694
[continues in French]

454
00:31:31,032 --> 00:31:33,576
Come here, you big drunkard!

455
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:45,463
[groaning]

456
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:50,676
That's what I mean by Jonahs.
They were beefing over the dame.

457
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,137
Wasn't her fault. He's stiff.

458
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,222
- She okay?
- Yeah.

459
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:57,308
Just roughed up a little.

460
00:31:57,391 --> 00:31:59,393
Take care of him, Holter.

461
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:01,896
Oh, here, let me help you, Professor.

462
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:05,149
- Thank you.
- Let's see.

463
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:07,568
Boy.

464
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:10,488
I'm really very sorry about this,
Professor.

465
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:13,032
That drunk was a
last-minute replacement.

466
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:16,452
- He's all right when he's sober.
- I'm sorry.

467
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,205
This is the last thing I...
I wanted to happen.

468
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:23,042
It had to break out sooner or later.
Let's have another look here.

469
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:26,212
Whew! It's lucky you
still got your teeth.

470
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,346
Don't get nervous, Doc.
Nobody's gonna bite you.

471
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:39,976
Don't you think that the pharmacist
should treat me, if it's necessary?

472
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,687
He's got his hands full
with those two lugs.

473
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:47,233
Besides, there's nothing
he can do that I can't, you know.

474
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:49,819
Oh, my. He got you so greasy.

475
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:53,572
[chuckling]

476
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:55,908
Okay.

477
00:32:55,992 --> 00:32:57,952
You know what a log is?

478
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:00,413
- Yes.
- You do, huh?

479
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:04,750
Well, I'm supposed to keep a detailed
report of everything that happens.

480
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:08,212
- It's for Mr. Fujimori.
- Mm-hmm.

481
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:11,090
[clears throat] How'd it start?

482
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:15,594
I was working on a new formula

483
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:19,265
when Ski asked if he
could show me his chest.

484
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:21,350
- Show you his chest?
- Yes.

485
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,811
Oh.

486
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:25,896
And then what?

487
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:30,276
Then he removed his shirt.

488
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,361
No kidding?

489
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:35,656
- He wanted me to see his tattoo.
- Oh, no.

490
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,785
- It was a beautiful tattoo.
- I'll bet it was.

491
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:41,787
- Beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

492
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:45,124
- But the intoxicated one rubbed it off.
- Naturally.

493
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:48,210
Tell me, uh, he make a pass at you?

494
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:51,922
- A pass?
- Did he try to kiss you?

495
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:54,633
- [kissing sounds]
- Yes, he did.

496
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:57,720
He did, huh? Did you coldcock him?

497
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:02,558
- What?
- Did you hit him?

498
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,977
- [speaking French]
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

499
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:08,481
Hold the phone. Hold the phone.
Now, say that in English.

500
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:10,566
- I slapped him.
- You did, huh?

501
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,818
Uh, tell me, uh,

502
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:15,112
you hit him after he kissed you?

503
00:34:15,196 --> 00:34:18,032
- Yes.
- Not before, huh?

504
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:24,205
- I do not understand.
- [chuckles]

505
00:34:24,288 --> 00:34:27,750
Well, you see, Professor, I just want
to make sure my report is factual.

506
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,752
- I couldn't put...
- Captain Jones.

507
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:33,672
Is this report for Mr. Fujimori
or for you?

508
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:36,258
- Uh... [chuckling]
- Mmm.

509
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:40,513
Now, really, a child prodigy oughta
be able to figure that one out.

510
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:42,681
- Don't you think?
- [chuckling]

511
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:44,683
- Yes.
- Yes.

512
00:34:48,938 --> 00:34:51,148
<i>Au revoir,</i> Professor.

513
00:34:57,613 --> 00:35:00,032
[laughing, chattering]

514
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:02,118
Now listen to me.

515
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,205
I don't want any more beefs,
you understand?

516
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:08,749
If I hear of anybody
making a play for that girl,

517
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:12,211
I'll personally shoot him out
through torpedo tube number one.

518
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:15,464
Captain, is it still a secret
where we're goin'?

519
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:18,551
We're tailin' a freighter
to an island in the North Pacific.

520
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,553
Gonna sink her?

521
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:23,389
We're gonna sneak into this island,
take a look and sneak out.

522
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:25,391
This is a scientific expedition.

523
00:35:25,474 --> 00:35:29,395
- But, Skipper, what are we lookin' for?
- Four-leaf clovers.

524
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:32,273
Well, what if the guys on the island
don't like us?

525
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:35,693
Look, I know you're all
itchin' for a little action,

526
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:39,155
but you'll only get it if we
have to defend ourselves, so relax.

527
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:43,784
[speaking French]

00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:52,084

Oh, good morning!

539
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:27,179
- Was the water hot enough, Professor?
- Just wonderful, thank you.

540
00:37:27,263 --> 00:37:30,849
- <i>Voulez-vous "fume" une cigarette?</i>
- What?

541
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,893
- I'm speaking French.
- Oh.

542
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:35,312
<i>Voulez-vous "fume" une cigarette?</i>

543
00:37:35,396 --> 00:37:38,983
Oh, you mean <i>"Voulez-vous</i>
<i>fumer une cigarette</i>?"

544
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,486
- That's what I said.
- No. <i>Fumer.</i>

545
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:45,114
- Foo-may.
- No, no, no.

546
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:47,700
You have to form your lips like this.

547
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:50,536
<i>Fumer.</i>

548
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:52,538

00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:56,417

00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,295
<i>Fumer.</i>

551
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:03,257
[laughing] I think I better go now.

552
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,176
Thank you.

553
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,014
You know, someday I'm gonna
find out what color her eyes are.

554
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:14,184
Good morning, Captain Jones.
You wanted to see me?

555
00:38:14,268 --> 00:38:17,146
Why did you let me sleep
through that plane contact?

556
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:22,026
I thought you needed the rest.
You were on duty for almost 20 hours.

557
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:25,154
Didn't you stop to think
how important that message might be?

558
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,156
Of course.

559
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,993
So I made sure that it was not
by decoding it myself.

560
00:38:32,202 --> 00:38:34,496
As you see,

561
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,168
it reports only that the <i>Kiang Ching</i>
has made no change in speed or course.

562
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,420
I knew that was of no importance.

563
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:43,964
Professor, did it ever occur to you

564
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,550
that I might be steering
a course to be...

565
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:51,388
You've lost us approximately two hours!

566
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:54,058
I'm very sorry, Captain.

567
00:38:54,141 --> 00:38:57,311
- And I think I have learned something.
- I hope so.

568
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:14,745
If you want to listen in on conversations,
use the intercom . It's easier.

569
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:17,206
That conversation I would
prefer not to have heard.

570
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:20,626
- But I was waiting to see you.
- Okay, you see me. I'm busy.

571
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:23,295
Many years have I been
with Professor Montel,

572
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:25,839
but never before have I heard
anyone speak like you

573
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:27,925
to the greatest scientist in his field.

574
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:31,804
Professor Montel's field isn't commanding
a screwball submarine. Mine is.

575
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:33,889
If such rudeness is necessary,

576
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,975
I hope this will be a very short cruise.

577
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:42,314
- What'd you want to see me about?
- [speaking French]

578
00:39:42,398 --> 00:39:45,901

comes in to this boat, I get it,

581
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:59,289
no matter who says it's unnecessary,
you understand?

582

This time, he was right.

587
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,119
May we come on the bridge?

588
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:39,204
Sure. Help yourself.

Okay, Charlie.

592
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:01,101
There it is!

[bell clanging]

594
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,539
Well, this one's for you, Doc.

595
00:41:22,623 --> 00:41:27,586
"Intelligence reports <i>Kiang Ching</i> carrying

What's a 61 -J capsule?

597
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:33,592
The charge to explode an A-bomb.

598

Hey, Skipper. Radar shows

bearing 355 degrees.

- Can't tell yet, but he's closing fast.

601
00:41:42,518 --> 00:41:45,229
- Range.
- 3,800 yards.

602
00:41:45,312 --> 00:41:48,106
Maybe the freighter has seen
our signal and comes after us.

Rig for red.

604
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:21,056
A sub's after us.

605
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:24,476
A sub? I thought this was
a scientific expedition.

606
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,603
It is, and we're gonna play it safe.

607
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,023
No use getting a bloody nose
unless we have to.

608
00:42:32,192 --> 00:42:34,653
She's submerged and listening for us.

609
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:38,115
- That's why she stopped pinging.
- What does this mean?

610
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:42,661
It means she's saving her torpedoes,
waiting till we surface.

611
00:42:42,744 --> 00:42:44,663
Just one more day, Doc,

612
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:47,749

No.

better stay in your quarters.

01:36:24,546 --> 01:36:26,465
[Holter] Skipper!

1090
01:36:26,548 --> 01:36:28,467
The boat's gone!

1091
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,719
- What?
- The boat's gone. Montel took it.

1092
01:36:30,803 --> 01:36:33,430
- Well, why didn't you stop him?
- We didn't get the chance.

1093
01:36:33,514 --> 01:36:36,266
He was on deck with her. Before we knew
what happened, he was in the boat and gone.

1094
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:38,268
- Where's the girl?
- On the bridge.

1095
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:46,735
Please. He doesn't want you to stop him.

1096
01:36:46,819 --> 01:36:49,238
Why didn't you stop him?
All you had to do was yell.

1097
01:36:49,321 --> 01:36:52,199
He knows your plan.
He'll carry it out. That's his orders.

1098
01:36:52,282 --> 01:36:54,743
That's the trouble with you geniuses...
Full of big ideas.

1099
01:36:54,827 --> 01:36:56,870
Now you're fouling up the whole works.

1100
01:36:56,954 --> 01:36:59,166
You know that island's
crawling with soldiers.

1101
01:36:59,191 --> 01:37:00,273
He knows that too.

1102
01:37:00,332 --> 01:37:04,211
Then why'd you let a nice old guy like
that take a shortcut to the cemetery?

1103
01:37:04,294 --> 01:37:06,296
He's no ordinary two-bit professor,
you know.

1104
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,507
He's Montel, top man in his field.

1105
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:11,470
But he's old and helpless... Doesn't
know his way outside of a test tube.

1106
01:37:11,552 --> 01:37:13,632
You oughta know that.
You work close enough with him.

1107
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,597
- What kind of a woman are you?
- Stop!

1108
01:37:15,681 --> 01:37:17,683
- Haven't you got any feelings?
- Stop!

1109
01:37:17,766 --> 01:37:19,685
He's my father.

1110
01:37:21,478 --> 01:37:23,480
- [sobbing]
- What?

1111
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:26,859
My father.

1112
01:37:28,193 --> 01:37:31,029
- Oh, I'm sorry, Denise.
- [sobbing]

1113
01:37:31,113 --> 01:37:33,198
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1114
01:37:33,282 --> 01:37:37,202
He said it was his place to go...

1115
01:37:38,829 --> 01:37:40,831
not yours.

1116
01:37:43,375 --> 01:37:45,377
I'm sorry.

1117
01:37:54,761 --> 01:37:56,805
She's sure got a lot of guts.

1118
01:37:56,889 --> 01:37:59,308
Only thing I can't figure out
is why the big mystery?

1119
01:37:59,391 --> 01:38:01,518
Why didn't she let us know
he's her old man?

1120
01:38:01,602 --> 01:38:05,772
Well, that's what you have to pay
for having a famous father.

1121
01:38:05,856 --> 01:38:08,358
She's been on a spot all her life.

1122
01:38:08,442 --> 01:38:11,987
Wanted to make good
on her own, and she did.

1123
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:14,406
And he was proud because she did.

1124
01:38:23,165 --> 01:38:25,125
Any sign of him at all?

1125
01:38:28,629 --> 01:38:31,423
No, not yet.

1126
01:38:36,011 --> 01:38:37,971
There he is.

1127
01:38:39,431 --> 01:38:41,433
And there's his signal.

1128
01:38:43,852 --> 01:38:45,657
Battle surface! Gun action!
Down scope!

1129
01:38:45,682 --> 01:38:46,629
[klaxon blaring]

1130
01:38:46,688 --> 01:38:48,607
- You'd better get below.
- Please.

1131
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:49,691
Okay.

1132
01:39:05,874 --> 01:39:08,210
All right, Ski. Let's go.

1133
01:39:11,797 --> 01:39:14,633
Come on, Willie. Joto, get up here.

1134
01:39:28,146 --> 01:39:30,148
Hurry it up. Hurry it up.

1135
01:39:36,697 --> 01:39:38,365
Fire!

1136
01:40:59,404 --> 01:41:01,031
You all right?

1137
01:41:02,074 --> 01:41:04,743
- Oh.
- The bomb must have gone off under us.

1138
01:41:04,826 --> 01:41:06,745
Bring her back on course.

1139
01:41:06,828 --> 01:41:08,747
Take her up to periscope depth.

1140
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:10,832
Periscope depth.

1141
01:41:14,753 --> 01:41:17,798
All compartments,
report damage and casualties.

1142
01:41:50,122 --> 01:41:52,624
The bomber didn't crash in the ocean.

1143
01:41:55,252 --> 01:41:57,379
It hit the island.

1144
01:42:38,795 --> 01:42:40,797
Head for home.

1145
01:42:48,513 --> 01:42:52,058
[Montel's voice] <i>Each man has his
own reason for living, Mr. Jones,</i>

1146
01:42:52,142 --> 01:42:54,519
<i>and his own price for dying.</i>
