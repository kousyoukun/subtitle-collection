What did you mean, Eomoni?

128
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,720
All this is because Ji Hoon's hardwork.
I didn't do much.

129
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,520
You dont have to be so formal
talking to me.

130
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
Just call me Ju Yeon-ssi.

131
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
=No.=

132
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,590
=I married early.
I'm same age as you, Ji Yeon-ssi.=

=Thank you so much for treating
Ji Hoon as if he is your son.=

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,060
=Please send him home early.
Dont be too late.=

135
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,070
Yes, I did came to fetch him.

136
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,410
<i>Hey, did you saw Go Ju Yeon?</i>

137
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,410
<i>Yeah, how old is she actually?</i>

138
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,140
I think I saw her since
 kindergarden.

139
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,140
Isn't she ancient?

140
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,350
But her body, wow.

141
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,880
Eh, isn't she a girls 'killer'?

142
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,150
<i>She fix everything,
that's how she looks younger.</i>

143
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,550
How many young artist has
she sponsored?

144
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,820
Having so much money,

145
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,430
it obvious she fixed her body.

146
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,630
If I was her, I'll do that too.

147
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,160
What?

148
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,900
This is what we call skills, missy.

149
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,500
Please exercise more.

150
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,320
It feels different, isn't it?

151
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,780
You just shave?

152
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,590
What now?

153
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,660
You promised if you got the award,
you will mention my name on the stage.

154
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,990
Why didn't you?

155
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,930
Being on stage,
I forgot everything.

156
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,400
Sorry.

157
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
Where's the ring? Why didn't you wear it?

158
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,740
Oh, I forgot.

159
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,940
<i>Next time, I definitely will wear the ring.</i>

160
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,350
And I will say I'm most grateful to you, 
my beloved Ju Yeon.

161
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,490
<i>You mention your mother's birthday.</i>

162
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,090
<i>You have to give it to her.</i>

163
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,960
Thank you.

164
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,100
But how old is your mother when she got married?

165
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,040
20.

166
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,900
Ah, fuck.

167
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,310
Why do you care for such a thing?

168
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,850
My dad said we should have dinner
sometime when you're free.

169
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,320
What?

170
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,790
My dad is your fan.

171
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,730
Faster! Faster!

172
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,330
Let me talk to them...

173
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,930
Go faster! Go, go!

174
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,340
Then, I'm going...

175
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,410
Go.

176
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,810
I love you.

177
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,740
Silly..

178
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,210
What to love?

179
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,150
I like it..I like it.

180
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,080
- Tae Ho.
- Yes?

181
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,150
Send him home. Hurry up!

182
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,480
- Drive safely!
- Okay.

183
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm going to get married!

184
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,030

Look here, Director Park.

187
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,310
Didn't we agreed about
the role for "Sinsaimdang"?

188
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,450
That was alcohol talking.

189
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,650
But is it right to give her

190
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,990
the role of alcoholic mother?

191
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,520
It's perfect for her.
The Nation Witch, Go Ju Yeon.

192
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,590
Having scandal with younger guys
that can be her newphew.

193
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,060
Even if she wears hanbok and head crown

194
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,790
you still won't get the feeling.

195
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,800
Furthermore...

196
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,930
You should think more about yourself.

197
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,400
someone who graduated New York fashion school

198
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,540
what are you still doing here?

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
That girl

200
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,340
is a niece of Hoejang-nim
that i know.

201
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,740
Anyhow, she can give
you more benefit

202
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,680
<i>Hyeong, it's time for you
to have a few apperentice.</i>

203
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,220
And that Ju Yeon-ssi, before she gets too old
asked her to get married.

204
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,090
Before her popularity faded,

205
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,690
that would be a pity for actresses like her.

206
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,890
Ju Yeon-ssi?

207
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
Hey, is Ju Yeon your friend?

208
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,030
I talked nicely for a bit,
now you're so full of yourself?

209
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,290
Hey, when you're still a begger in America

210
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,100
going around like a homeless person,

211
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,700
everyday I bought you food and drink,

212
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,630
<i>Did you forget that?</i>

213
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,770
Your English is so useless
you still want to be friends with the Americans

214
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,230
Poking people's bottom
the Korean way

215
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,300
nearly expel from campus.

216
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,700
Till I need to go to the dean
and explain everything.

217
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,770
Aigoo...

218
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,970
I save your life, you jerk.

219
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,440
Now you're popular are you??

220
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,180
Yes, I'm popular.
So what?

221
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,050
Aigoo, what are you guys behaving like this?

222
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,780
You both marine corps(military service).

223
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,710
Yes, I'm from the marine corps.

224
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,780
Which force, jerk?

225
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,320
Force 951. Why?

226
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,570
Which force are you?

227
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,720
That's not important.

228
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,330
Ju Yeon Eonni! Ju Yeon Eonni!

229

00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,200
Seriously, what do you eat?

235
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,730
If you can be more beautiful than this,

236
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,730
where the younger girls would get jobs?

237
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,270
<i>That's their problem.</i>

238
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,610
I made some chobap.
would you like to eat together?

239
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,210
No, no, thanks.

240
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,210
Give it to Pyeong Goo Hyeong as snacks.

241
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,610
Even the world can see how handsome he is but cranky.

242
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,620
Why are you talking like that to my 'sidekick'?

243
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,690
Please excuse me!
I've some other business to attend.

244
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,160
- So fast?
- Yeah, yeah.

245
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,090
- Take care!
- Will do.

246
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,030
Why is he here?

247
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,830
Dont tell me, he's here to
asked me to star in "Sinsaimdang"?

248
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,980
But... I've think very carefully.

249
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,650
I'm not ready.

250
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,790
What?

251
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,390
Ji Hoon will take the role as Yi-I Yulgok.
<font color="#ffff00">[Yi I - One of the 4 Confusion scholars during Joseon Dynasty known as Yulgok.]</font>

252
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,390
Why would I want to take the role as his mother?

253
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,590
Oh, okay.

254
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,930
Who's she?

255
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,000
Sh--she--She's a dongsaeng of someone I know.

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,870
You wont produce new artist
without my knowledge, right?

257
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,470
To train her or whatever.

258
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,810
Have I gone crazy?

259
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,280
What are you saying?

260
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,150
What's that?

261
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,880
You all haven't eat, have you?

262
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,890
Has she eat?

263
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,430
<i>How would it be?</i>

264

<i>Is there a place...</i>

I'm stressed!

271
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,720
What's why? Of course they want that.

272
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,120
- That thing, right?
- Right.

273
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,590
"That" what?

274
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,860
They just want to thank you for helping that kid
and now he won an award.

275
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,660
Of course that's why.

276
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,120
Why are you calling him a kid?

277
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,460
You wont know what would happen in the future.

278
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,530
You shocked me!

279
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,530
Why are choosing guys so young?

280
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,800
Enough. What's important there's someone.

281
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
There's no one like him, right?

282
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,970
<i>Hot!</i>

283
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,070

Still dont know who will get kick out.

319
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:23,850
Get lost, you!

320
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,450
Ajumma, you're the one should get lost.

321
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,260
If you still like this
you'll look pathethic, Ajumma.

322
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,000
Omo!

323
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,470
This is mine.

324
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,730
Seriously, what is it with this ajumma?

325
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,800
Ajumma!

326
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,140
You're old, don't try to act innocent.

327
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,600
This is mine!

328
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,810
This is mine!

329
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,490
That...

330
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:08,160
You're really a trash!

331
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:17,240
Dont you dare to star in that drama.

332
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,370
If you do, beware!

333
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Wait & see what I'd do if you accept it!

334
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,920
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Oppa.

335
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,230
I'm not surprised.

336
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,100
This time, blow is too big.

337
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,630
She said the parents even asked to have dinner together.

338
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,040
Eat together, so what?

339
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,370
Exactly.

340
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,240
Oppa too...
Dont you think it's time to consider
other options?

341
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,380
There's many big company
wanna recruit you.

342
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,580
Sang Mi...

343
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,380
Aigoo, yeah yeah.
Just say that I'm dreaming.

344
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,740
<i>Eomma...</i>

345
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,280
Eomma...

346
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,610
woke up already?

347
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,210
Eomma... Eomma.

348
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,280
she went to the market.

349
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,620
Come her to Gomo.
[Gomo - father's sister]

350
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,620
Why are you crying?

351
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,690
It's okay.

352
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,160
Just a minute, your mum will be back!

353
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,430
Eomma...

354
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,430
Dont cry. Your mum will come back.

355
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,650
Let see, who is this delicious food for?

356
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,720
For me?

357
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,380
Me, me, me.

358
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,520
Or it's for you, San?

359
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,390
Me, me.

360
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,860
Yummy.

361
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,930
Kiss me.

362
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,530
Papa! Papa!

363
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,740
Woke up so early?

364
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,800
Eomma!

365
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,070
Eomma, where did you go?

366
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,670
It's hot, go sit down first.

367
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,540
Dont want.

368
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,740
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

369
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,210
Wait for a minute.

370
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
<i>I missed you mum.</i>

371
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,550
Hang the laundry, hang the laundry.

372
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,820
- Go play with Gomo.
- Let's play!

373
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,480
Okay, okay

374
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,690
Go play there with Gomo.

375
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,290
Here San! Come here play with me!

376
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,220
<i>Dont wanna!</i>

377
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,890
What's up with this kid?
Didnt you eat the food?

378
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,630
Gomo's cooking has no taste.

379
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,890
<i>Then go sit with her.
Sit with her only, alright?</i>

380
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,500
<i>It's so hot.</i>

381
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,840
Aigoo, there's fire!

382
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,310
Omo, what should we do?

383
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,440
Did she want to burn the house down?

384
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,850
Okay, eat up!

385
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,580
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

386
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,930
I've think very carefully.

387
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,730
There seems no man for me in this life.

388
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,400
Why are you making
decision like this.

389
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,540
In all my life,
I've analyze it from the beginning until now.

390
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,810
<i>What's left of it?</i>

391
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,750
Nothing.

392
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,680
Sponsored bags, sponsored clothes, sponsored hair.

393
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,690
Sponsored plastic surgery, car...

394
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,020
Did it make sense?

395
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,360
I've struggle so much
up till now.

396
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,360
But there's nothing that is actually mine.
Did it make any sense?

397
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,490
<i>Aigoo, dont panic, Joo Hyeon.</i>

398
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,360
There's me & Daepyo-nim.

399
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,700
What are you saying?

400
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,100
Beside me, Daepyo-nim has,
someone else to produce.

401
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,310
An you, Pyeong Goo, in the end
you'll go to your wife & kids.

402
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,240
You dont have to talk like this?

403
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,580
He's already 15 years old.

404
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,250
If he died, I'll take care of it.

405
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,460
But... if I get older & died alone...

406
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,060
Then I have no one to take care of me...

407
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,600
That's why I want someone
who will be by my side.

408
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
<i>Who is actually mine.</i>

409
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,740
who will never leave me.

410
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,010
And someone who will love me.

411
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,080
So, the conclusion is?

412
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,820
I wanna be a mother.

413
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,750
What?

414
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:35,420
To be a mother to a child that, doesn't matter where & when,
will never gonna leave me.

415
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,930
I want a daughter, a daughter.
I love a daughter.

416
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,300
The blood type should be...

417
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,370
Type O.

418
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,100
Type O. Good, type O.

419
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,040
Type O.

420
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,910
It's better if both parents
graduated from well known university.

421
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,510
A bit difficult?

422
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,510
Then...

423
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,910
Study for 4 years is enough!

424
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,450
Son is better?

425
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,580
<i>Furthermore...</i>

426
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,520
did it make sense?

427
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,390
I'm not qualified.
Me?

428
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,860
In Korea, there's nobody
who didnt know me.

429
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,460
How they decide qualified or not?

430
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,860
You watched too much TV shows with kids.

431
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,530
That's enough.

432
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,130
What is enough?
You're a father too.

433
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,330
Then, me?
How bad am I?

434
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,400
Do you think a child is some clothes?

435
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,730
Do you think a child is some clothes?

436
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,600

how can you be a mother?
<font color="#ffff00">-= Seonggajeong Adoption Organization =-</font>

437
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:19,730
Honestly, people like you who are too naive
how can you be a mother?

438
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,070
You do this only at temple.

439
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,940
Do you think anyone can be a parent?

440
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,540
Not everyone can do it

441
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,680
Everyone is betting
their life being a parent.

442
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,210
Being a parent is
not for everyone.

443
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,350
Am I too loud?

444
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,750
Ju Yeon...

445
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,490
Then, I should be pregnant for 10 month.
That's it, isnt it?

446
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,490
I should inherit my
good gen to the world.

447
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,760
That would do.

448
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,770
What is it?

449
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,440
What's with your face?

450
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,840
How long has it been since your period, Nuna?

451
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,710
Pardon?

452
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,240
Hey!

453
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,180
Dont tell me...

454
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,180
dont tell me...

455
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,320
Didnt I tell you
to have regular check up at the hospital?

456
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
Aigoo, seriously!

457
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,460
How many times did I tell you
to be careful with guys?

458
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,990
I wanna have the baby.

459
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,660
What baby?
You wanna give birth to your  enemy's child?

460
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,060
Looking from genetic perspective
he's not that bad.

461
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,800
What is not bad?

462
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,600
What's important is the parents
characters, should be good!

463
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,670
you're being noisy, seriously!

464
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,470
It's not that.

465
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,540
What?

466
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,280
Menopause.

Apa?

469
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,410
What?

470
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,900
Be careful! Be careful!

471
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,110
She's on the lift again.

472
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,980
<i>Eomma...</i>

473
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,710
Kids nowadays
too infertile.

474
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,450
<i>Damaging the young body.</i>

475

<i>Aigoo, you're so lucky.</i>

476
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,920
Excuse me.

477
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,400
Everyone can hear you.
You can't talk like that.

478
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,260
<i>Have I said anything wrong?</i>

479
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,800
As an adult, you should not
talk like that to the kids.

480
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,540
<i>Whether she wanna have a baby or not</i>

00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,400
<i>what is it with you?</i>

482
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,470
If your child is so precious,

483
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,940
other people's child is precious too.

484
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,810
Is she your daughter?

485
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,350
She is my daughter, thats why!

486
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,820
Lets go!

487
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,960
You have a mouth but keep saying bullshit!
Bullshit!

488
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,910
Here...

489
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,920
I've bad mood today
so I'm saying nonsense.

490
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,920
Dont be too grateful.

491
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,590
You're Go Ju Yeon, right?

492
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,590
No, I'm not.

493
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,530
I've seen the news.

494
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,870
That bastard is kinda handsome.

495
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,670
Bastard.

496
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,340
Now you look like human.

497
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,080
What?

498
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,290
When I saw you on TV,
you dont seem like a human.

499
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,360
You're too happy.

500
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,230
Do you know how tired it is
to pretend to be happy?

501
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,500
There's a lot of people who wish
to be in your place.

502
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:18,910
How old are you?

503
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,310
How old is old enough?

504
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,180
Want to have lunch?

505
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,780
I have to do this today.

506
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,460
Thanks for the icecream

507
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,410
Oh Hyeong.

508
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,680
What? Nuna is still here.

509
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,140
Hurry up, take her home!

510
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,080
Healthy?

511
00:26:59,210 --> 00:26:59,880
What?

512
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,350
I mean, is the baby healthy?

513
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,220
Nuna, do you know that
we've been looking for you.

514
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,290
I've called hyeong.

515
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,160
Dont walk around.
Stay here!

516
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,620
Dont move!

517
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,760
<i>Nuna, get out!</i>

518
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,960
- I have consultation with patient.
- Hey!

519
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,370
You're so young to have an abortion.
Dont you know how dangerous it is?

520
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,700
Now you...

521
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,840
If you do it now,

522
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,440
you'll have higher risk for breast cancer.

523
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,170
I will explain it to her.
You should get out first.

524
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,240
Why are behaving like this?

525
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,250
If you choose to abort

526
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,320
There's possibility of genetic difference
and you'll have a weak body.

527
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,780
I know that.

528
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,790
You feel desperate now
that's why you choose to abort it.

529
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,190
Later, when you desperately want a baby,
there's a possibility you never get pregnant again.

530
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,190
So you want me to have it?

531
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,130
Excuse me?

532
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,590
Give birth, that's it?

533
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,460
I'm still a kid myself.

534
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,730
If I can't take care of the baby,
what do you want me to do?

535
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,330
Say I have it.

536
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,670
The baby will raise on it's own?

537
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,670
It should be raise properly.

538
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,410
If you give birt to the baby,

539
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,350
I will raise it.

540
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,290
An actress buying
a baby from a junior high schooler.

541
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,560
This... This is a crime, a crime.

542
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,430
If the reporter got hold of this, it would be a disaster.

543
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,300
Excellent career of Go Ju Yeon will destroyed.

544
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,630
Please... I beg you.

545
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,300
Why are you thinking negatively?

546
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
<i>She said she doesn't want the baby,
and I want it.</i>

547
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,170
If she give birth to the baby and
I would raise it up,

548
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,170
Isn't it win-win situation?

549
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:33,840
Okay.

550
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,710
Put it side whether it's
illegal or immoral.

551
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,580
What if there's a complication?

552
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,180
What if you change your mind?

553
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,850
I wont.

554
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,520
Do you know how much
I want a child?

555
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,850
You wont change your mind?
Seriously?

556
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
You? Who never wear same shoes
more than a week?

557
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,730
A baby & shoes is different!

558
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,530
This is how you behave
when you want new shoes.

559
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,730
This is why I'm saying all this.

560
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,930
If you not really sincere,

561
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,400
don't do this.

562
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,130
This time it's different!

563
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,340
If I didn't say I want to raise it,
she'd have abort the baby.

564
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,810
Don't you know how dangerous
an abortion is?

565
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,610
How about the poor baby?

566
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,880
Don't you pity the innocent baby?

567
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,480
Why you wanna take the responsibility?

568
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,220
Do you really know her?

569
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,550
She's a pregnant junior high school student.

570
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,820
Don't you now how the
teenagers these days?

571
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,560
So, you want to be with me all your life?

572
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,760
Òkay.

573
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,760
What a joke.

574
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,840
I dont wanna live like this anymore.

575
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,520
Delicious?

576
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,130
Eonni...

577
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,800
My art teacher said...

578
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,530
If I take part in the art competition,
I could win it,

579
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,000
and I can go to art high school.

580
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,730
So?

581
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,810
Teacher said I can prepare
for the  competition

582
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,740
if I go to preparation
class during school holiday~

583
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,670
You like it?

584
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,680
For the sake of life
I have to serve drinks to those ajussi.

585
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,880
<i>You're thinking to take art class.
Then ask me for the tuition money?</i>

586
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,620
I'll look for some money too.

587
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,290
Eonni, you wanna wear this, right?

588
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,300
You should know the situation, Kim Dan Ji.

589
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,830
<i>Being burdened by you make me annoyed.</i>

590
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,230
Oppa!

591
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,700
Let's eat!

592
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,170
I'm hungry.

593
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,370
That's mine!

594
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,780
Eat up, Oppa.

595
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,320
They said you're going to represent the school
in the art competition.

596
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,460
You tell him about that thing?

597
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,060
Which hospital?

598
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,940
You want me to go with you?

599
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,490

That her? There, right?

601
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,910
How do I know?

602
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,910
But what with her expression?

603
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,580
What if she not going to give it to me?

604
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,180
Thank god if that happen.

605
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,310
<i>Aigoo...</i>

What?

609
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,470
Put it in the GPS!

610
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,630
Giving birth at a young age is dangerous,
you know that, dont you?

613
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,030
100 thousand?

614
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,830
You want me to get off?

615
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,700
No,no.

616
00:32:54,370 --> 00:33:00,240
for now, just transfer 50 thousand Won to this account!

617
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,840
Okay.

618
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,440
And now, it's school holiday.

619
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,050
I'll go live with Ajumma
until I give birth.

620
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:05,850
My house?

621
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,450
Ajussi will rent a house for you.

622
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,120
Exactly! How can I live with
someone I barely know?

623
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,790
This, isn't it your child, Ajumma?

624
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,590
Yes, it's my child.

625
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,990
Don't you know how important a mother's
voice to a fetus?

626
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,930
No pre-natal education?

627
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,260
Of course, there should be.

628
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,600
What? There's more?

629
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,670
There's no way I will
give birth in a hospital.

630
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,540
Two possibilities.

631
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,880
Either give birth at home, then there should be
a witness for birth registration purpose.

632
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,740
Or to give birth overseas,
then come back home.

633
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,810
If overseas, we need an agent,
to bring the baby home.

634
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
Ah, birth certificate.

635
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,020
Ajussi, turn right.

636
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,750
Hah? Oh!

637
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,090
You wanna do it or not?

638
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,760
Of course it's a deal.

639
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,040
Hey, here is...

640
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,370
Seems like we arrived.

641
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,380
Here?

642
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,920
Wow, she's smart.

643

<i>Protein helps development of body immunity.</i>

737
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,550
Sufficient rest,

<i>appopriate exercise.</i>

739

743
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,030
Let the fetus hear his voice.

The fetus is healthy, right?

773
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,320
The fetus is a bit small
compared to normal.

Why?

775
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,260
I've fed her with so much food.

776
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,590
Healthy food and yoga.

777
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,330
That's the basic.

778
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,600
Pregnant mother cannot have stress.

<i>Possibly because of the mother age,
she's too young.</i>

781
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,340
You dont have to need to worry.

If anything is wrong,

783
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,280

790

There's 3 types of actress in this world.

Second, actress who picky with roles.

793

And the third, actress who create the role.

794
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,320
So which one are you?

795
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,920

TV drama viewers
are mostly women.

799
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,270
You heard of "Sinsaimdang", right?

800
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,870
50 thousand Won.
(Sinsaimdang appear on korean 50 thousand bank note)

801
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,870
A special production of "Sinsaimdang"
for the 50th anniversary of Changsa.

802
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:27,950
The director keep coming to our office
and begging for me but I refused.

803
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,350

806
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,760
What the use of this kinda publicity?

807
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,960
When you still have the opportunity,
grab all money you can get, dont waste time.

808
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,030
You wanna fight me, is it?

809
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,910
Follow me!

810
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:55,980
What now?

811
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,450
Long time no see.

812
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,920
Haven't seen you for sometime, you look handsome.

813
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,520

814
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,450
Ah, Deok Ki Oppa!

815
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,990
I heard a lot about you.

816
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,590
Still the same.

817
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,130
- Hi!
- Hi!

818

819
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,660
Let's go drinking sometimes.

820
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,530
Hi!

821
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,340
Hi!

822
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,620
Director, you should work with me
in a new TV drama project.

823
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,680
Of course.

824
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,550
The baby's father!
My baby's father is walking toward us.

825
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,890
He's a bit short.

826
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,030
I want to ask for a signiture.

827
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,300
Excuse me, can I have your sign?

828
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,510
Aigo.... aigoo.

834
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,720
Hi, Seonsaeng-nim!

835
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,050
Hi!

836
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,720
May be I lost my mind for a bit.

837
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,590
The director even come
for me personnaly.

838
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,330
Aigoo, you might think it's an easy decision.

839
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,930
We are the one should thank you.

840
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,730
Now you look like an actress.

841
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,000
Thank you, Seonsaeng-nim.

842
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,340
We'll finish the first part.

843
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,470
Then we all should go for a drink.

844
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,810
Okay.

845
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,410
Alright, repeat scene 5.

846
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,340
Scene 5... scene 5.

847
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,810
Scene 5, on a bleak night.

848
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:43,550
<i>Sinsaimdang gaze upon Lee Won Soo
a husband who is hiding himself.</i>

849
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,420
<i>Eventhough the civil test is important,</i>

850
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,950
until she can become a passionate wife.

851
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,230
How can you not have feeling when
Father come because he miss you?

852
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,760
If my father is so weak...

853
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,830
eventho I'm a woman...

854
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,030
If not this way,

855
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,370
if this is not considered filial,

856
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,710
although I have to end my life,
I will not compromise.

857
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,920
Look here and here.

858
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,090
I'm going to the loo for a bit.

No booking.

874
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,340
Hey, when did you learn this?

875
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,810
For a living.

876
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,750
Correct, everyone need a special skill.

877
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:05,220
I was selected to represent the school
by the art department.

878
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,550
Representative?

879
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,090
So you're going to a competition?

880
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,490
How would I go?
With my condition?

881
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,570
Ju Yeon-nim, you are right.

882
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,440
Actor who create role

883
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,440
Upgraded Gonsi Buin role
to become Sinsaimdang role.

884
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,640
You wanna die?

885
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,850
Dont move!

886
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,510
It's nearly finish,
now it's messed up

887
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,260
But why don't you live
with your mother?

888
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,200
She died when I was 20 year old.

889
00:47:59,140 --> 00:47:59,810
Father?

890
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:02,480
He ran away from the start.

891
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,550
You?

892
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,820
Something similar.

893
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,490
May be I was too young
so I didn't feel sad.

894
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,690
As time goes by,
you'll feel sad.

895
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,030
I missed them.

896
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,840
When my friends dissed
their parents,

897
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,370
I pretend not to hear them.

898
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,370
Honestly, I'm jealous of them.

899
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,040
Me too

900
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,980
Ju Yeon-nim, you're different from me.

901
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,380
You're cheerful person.

902
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,590
Aigoo...

903
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,520
If that bad,
you're a great person too.

904
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,590
Not only smart, you have special skill too.

905
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,190
And you're smart managing money.

906
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,130
That's all great things.

907
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,470
But be careful around boys.

908
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,070
Don't laugh I'm serious.

909
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,070
Woman should only have
relationship with good guys.

910
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,410
Later, when you found a man,
consult me first.

911
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,480
Get it?

912
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,880
I get it.

913
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,680
But that's not something YOU
should said, of all people.

914
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,760
That bastard!

915
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,570
Don't you want him pay for what he did?

916
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,740
She's coming!

917
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,080
- Go  Ju Yeon-ssi!

918

920

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,880
Go Ju Yeon-ssi!

922
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,420
Is it true you are pregnant?

923
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,290
<i>Is it true?</i>

924
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,420
<i>Please comment.</i>

925
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,890
Yes.

926
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,160
It's true,I'm pregnant.

927
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:38,560
This might be my last chance.

928
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:43,970
So I decided.

929
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,770
Who is the father?
Can you give some information?

930

00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,340
Omo! Which hospital?

940
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,080
You're not supposed to asked which hospital
at the time like this

941
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,220
but why he's admitted.

942

958
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,790
You said you know, but why are you being like this?

959
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,730
This woman... why do you did it?
This is not how you do it.

960
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,400
You said not to be so smart, didn't you?

961
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,540
You said if an artist is too smart
it's the end of the career?

962
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,940
Be smart! Be smart!
Please be a bit smart!

963
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,340
I think an artist need
to be smarter.

964
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,140
Don't step out of the house.

965
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,150
For the time being
just stay home.

966
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,750
Hide first. Got it?

967
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,690
You should eat something.

968
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,690
Is there anything you want to eat?

969
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,160
It's useless, is it?

970
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,030
What do you mean?

971
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,360
I feel better now.

972
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,900
You go on the internet later, right?

973
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:52,630
Put up some comment.

974
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,970
Kill them all.

975
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,100
I did that.

976
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,980
You should do it too.

977
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,120
Revenge.

978
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,450
I can't.

979
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:15,990
Why?

980
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,860
You still like him?

981
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,060
What is it?

982
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,600
You didn't tell him
about the baby?

983
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,730
I did.

984
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,530
So?

985
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,870
He gave his mother's ring to me.

986
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,340
Crazy bastard!

987
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,070
He asked to abort the baby?

988
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,280
He asked whether it's his or not.

989
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,010
Wah, a real son-of-a bitch!

990
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,280
I didn't anything good either.

991
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,410
Hey! Is this a fatal crime?

992
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,150
Didn't appreciate a woman body.

993
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,420
Irresponsible guy
like him is a trash.

994
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,890
You didn't do anything wrong.

995
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,890
If I didnt do wrong
why I'm the only one like this?

996
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,500
It just too early.

997
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,630
Right, now you may be suffering.

998
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,770
Look at me!
Now, I'm all better.

999
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,850
This is just temporary phase.
It's nothing.

1000
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,580
Not to live your life and regret it.

1001
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,190
It's better to blame others.

1002
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,930
Relax.
Don't take it to heart.

1003
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,060
That bastard is going to America.

1004
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:34,470
As a Korea represantative.

1005
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,300
<font color="#ffff00">-= That one? =-</font>

1006
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,500
<font color="#ffff00">-= Let's go home. =-</font>

1007
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,180
<font color="#ffff00">-= Hey! You just gonna let him go like that?
That so sweet of you. =-</font>

1008
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,980
<font color="#ffff00">-= So how? =-</font>

1009
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,450
<font color="#ffff00">-= He's coming. =-</font>

1010
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:26,390
<font color="#ffff00">-= He's coming, coming, coming. =-</font>

1011
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,940
You... why do you come here?

1012
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:56,280
Positive..It's yours.

1013
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,350
What?

1014
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,490
It's yours, no doubt.

1015
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,230
We talk about this later.

1016
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,830
Why later?

1017
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,100
You should go & do the best.

1018
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,500
Your child will be watching your competition.

1019
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,100
Every moment...

1020
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,570
<i>Bin! We're gonna take picture!
Why are you there?</i>

1021
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,040
Hi!

1022
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,510
You're Bin's friend?

1023
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,250
I just wanna wish him luck.

1024
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,250
Thanks for coming.

1025
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,120
Can we take a picture together?

1026
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,120
Of course, hurry up!

1027
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,190
And take this.

1028
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,460
Bin gave it to me.

1029
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,670
I'm taking the pictures! Look here!

1030
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:59,410
Wah, you...

1031
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,080
You're not like what I think of you.

1032
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,350
So cool!
You should always like this.

1033
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,090
Without you, Ju Yeon-nim, I wont be able to do it.

1034
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,020
Thank you.

1035
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:18,900
Hey, just call me eonni.

1036
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,170
You're good. Fabulous!

1037
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,100
Try call me eonni.

1038
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,040
Come on, call me eonni!

1039
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,310
Eonni!

1040
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,850
=Hey!=

1041
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:43,320
- =Where are you?=
- Why?

1042
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,330
How's your health condition?

1043
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:50,930
I'm sorry I didnt tell
you about it first.

1044
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:57,470
But after the baby is born,
there's no way to hide it.

1045
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,270
It's true, you'll never
guessed what on a person's mind.

1046
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,540
True.

1047
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,950
I thought I can live
a normal life.

1048
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:08,950
Who would thought that I would want a child.

1049
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,950
Even if you think you want to change
your image, it's useless.

1050
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:14,020
Nobody would care.

1051
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,020
Excuse me?

1052
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:20,030
You have decided.
To do all this...

1053
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,090
I'm really...

1054
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,230
Look at this!

1055
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,100
Hurry, look at it!

1056
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:29,230
Omo! Omo what is this?

1057
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,440
Omo! Omo what is this?
<font color="#ffff00">-= CF model project. =-</font>

1058
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:30,840
Omo! Omo what is this

1059
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,970
Omo, omo! Omo!

1060
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,910
Your child is a treasure.

1061
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,710
But from now on, you're not a "miss" anymore.

1062
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,640
What?

1063
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,710
You're ready, right?

1064
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:41,910
What?

1065
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,520
Baby milk, baby equipment...
Everything.

1066
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,580
Of course!

1067
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:47,790
Of course!

1068
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,720
Of course! Everything!

1069
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,060
What can't a mother do?

1070
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,660
Of course! Let's get some money!

1071
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,460
Get more money!

1072
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,060
- Get more money!
- Get more money!

1073
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,800
Get more money!

1074
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,150
- Good work.
- Good work.

1075
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,240
Hyeong, good work.

1076
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:41,710
Gonsi Bu-in?

1077
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:43,180
Sinsaimdang!

1078
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,380
I'll think about it.

1079
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:49,180
"Sinsaimdang"Film director,

1080
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:52,780
with the main lead
please get on the stage.

1081
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:55,850
Why do you change
the cast for Sinsaimdang role at the last moment?

1082
00:59:55,850 --> 01:00:00,660
Actually in my mind
I only have one person.

1083
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,460
It's Go Ju Yeon-ssi who has versatile acting.

1084
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,210
<i>Cut!</i>

1085
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:20,950
<i>Go Ju Yeon-ssi pegnancy and
the rumour about relationship with Kang Ji Hoon come in the spotlight.</i>

1086
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:25,350
<i>It would take a strong will
for you to take part in this project.</i>

1087
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:31,200
If the rumour is true,
we wont be sitting here now.

1088
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:32,690
Bastard.

1089
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,690
Right, Seonbe-nim?

1090
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,030
Dont take the mic...
Dont take it.

1091
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:44,300
I have think carefully.

1092
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,170
Don't think carefully...

1093
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:51,240
The unknown father,

1094
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,510
there's no reason for me
to not sit with him.

1095
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,180
That is what I think.
Isnt that right?

1096
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:02,320
We'll talk inside!

1097
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,930
Eomma, it look delicious!

1099
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,860

1101
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:11,400
<font color="#ffff00">-= Eomma Ramyeon =-</font>
- <i>Cut! That's all.</i>

1102
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,800
- <i>Cut! That's all.</i>
- Okay.

1103
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,930
Ah, yes.
With Braddell...

1104
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:18,600
I've talked with Braddell.

1105
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,870
Yes, Okay.
Thank you.

1106
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:22,610
A minute.

1107
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,410
What is it?

1108
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:27,680
Earlier, on the monitor, you makeup seems faded.

1109
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,680
Didn't I tell you to use
high quality cosmetic?

1110
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,420
It's okay! It's the same.

1111
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,080
Fine.

1112
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,820
Clean the makeup on the car.
I'm tired!

1113
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:38,360
Chanel asked you to be it's new model.

1114
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,690
Ah, it's so hot!

1115
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:40,760
Hey!

1116
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,830
You so scared?

1117
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,630
Be careful around people.

1118
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,970
Aren't there a cool one?
It's sweaty!

1119
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,900
That's how a pregnant mother suffered.

1120
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,840
But she really bring luck.

1121
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,570
My wife predicted it.

1122
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,710
She said someone from the East
will bring a lot of luck.

1123
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,310
The door has opened.

1124
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:00,650
She live in Wangsinmi, right?

1125
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,510
Wangsinmi is located in the East?

1126
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,380
Looks like it.

1127
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,720
Is it okay for you to get out like this?

1128
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,390
I left quietly.

1129
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:13,990
Your tummy has become bigger.

1130
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,800
Go Ju Yeon treat you nicely?

1131
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,930
She's popular now.

1132
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,070
Before this, she kept following me around.

1133
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,670
It's more comfortable now.

1134
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,340
It is true, the breast become bigger?

1135
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,280
Everything is only until the baby is born.

1136
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,750
Don't get too attached.

1137
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,090
Everything is only until the baby is born, right?

1138
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,560
Of course.

1139
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,960
They said she's a tough to deal with.

1140
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,300
Not really.
She's cheerful.

1141
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,630
<i>Ok Hee!</i>

1142
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,100
Oh, did you know?

1143
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,240
I know this from the school.

1144
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,710
If the result is better than mine,
it's really good then.

1145
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,050
Goodbye!

1146
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,920
Don't get too attached!

1156
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,170
=Yes, this is the first time for me
to be in the news room like this, so I'm nervous.=

1157
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:04,100
=The're nothing different. Don't be so nervous.=

1158
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,440
She has prepared beforehand.

=Chaotic life?=

1170
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:33,600
No.

1171
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,200
In public's perspective, this kind of act
is immoral.

1172
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,070
Yes, yes. Immoral. Yes.

1173
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:44,680
And a lot of negative opinion
given by the public.

1174
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,480
Or there's many who frown upon my action.

1175
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,480
=Eventho this is not one sided fault,=

1176

=There's always situations like this. Yes.=

1178
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:01,760
Idiot.

<font color="#ffff00">-= Possibility to get pregnant using condom. =-</font>

1181
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,170
Okay.

1182
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:17,780
- Goodwork.
- Goodwork.

1183
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,510
It's so stupid, it's embarrassing.
Let's go!

1184
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:22,450
You wanna die?!

1185
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,180
So annoying!

1186
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,920
Ah, there's good news.

1187
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,990
Ji Hoon quitted the Sinsaimdang team.

1188
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,920
Now, he's jobless.

1189
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:35,260
Can we take photo together?

1190
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,590
- Of course.
- Sorry..

1191
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,730
- Can you capture it for us?
- Yes.

1192
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:41,130

1193
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,940

Goodwork , goodwork.
Thank you.

1199
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:13,030
Can I take a picture with you too?

1200
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,910
Hey!

1201
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,580
Hey! Hey!

1202
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,980
Did you watched it? Did you?

1203
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,710
I saw it.

1204
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,250
He sat right here.

1205
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,720
So different.

1206
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,930
Very handsome.

1207
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,530
Hey, do you know what's more awesome?

1208
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,130
He invited me to eat together.

1209
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,470
It just an invitation, so excited?

1210
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,540
An invitation from national achor, to eat together.

1211
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,010
It's an honor!

1212
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,750
The baby also can hear his voice.

1213
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:07,090
I'm the one who's pregnant.

1214
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,090
You've been deceived by a man
but you still so excited?

1215
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,690
I didn't say I wanna go.

1216
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,770
I'm pregnant too!
In front of public.

1217
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,440
I just wannt boast in front of you.

1218
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,170
Can't you just listen?

1219
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,450
Wanna do manicure?

1220
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:41,520
No, thanks.

1221
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:44,060
You must be tired too,
sleep!

1222
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,200
I just got back from the hospital.

1223
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:55,800
The hamburger you mentioned just arrived.

1224
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,540
Okay, understood.

1225
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,270
Let me do it.

1226
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:00,340
Okay.

1227
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:17,420
Why aren't you eating?

1228
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:20,630
Are you close with Eonni?

1229
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:22,630
Do we looked like we're close?

1230
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,500
I've seen what I should & shouldn't, 
that kind of relationship.

1231
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:28,500
Eonni never mentioned you.

1232
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:30,230
What should she tell you?

1233
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:38,640
Eonni mentioned you before.

1234
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:40,910
What she said?

1235
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,180
She said you're so precious.

1236
01:08:55,190 --> 01:09:00,800
That guy, who always with you,
seems like you are both close.

1237
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,070
What kind of relationship?

1238
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,270
The tough big guy?

1239
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:08,940
Oh, that's my buddy.

1240
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:11,740
He's my stylist.

1241
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,550
Been working together for a long time.

1242
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,680
A lot of people misunderstood us.

1243
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:21,750
Don't tell me... you too?

1244
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,420
No, no,no.

1245
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,760
You look like a man.

1246
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,560
Excuse me?

1247
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,100
Watching news on TV, you sit
and read like a robot.

1248
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,700
Didn't look like a human at all.

1249
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,100
Never give a shit, something like that.

1250
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:44,310
Sorry.

1251
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:49,510

1297
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,060
Is it a daughter?

1298
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:12,400
<i>Do I look old?</i>

1299
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,330
<i>Yes, you do look old.</i>

1300
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,400
You're not that young anymore.

1301
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,070
My ass going to fall!

1302
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,740
What are you doing here?

1303
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,470
It seems like a daughter.

1304
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,010
Oh, my belt.

1305
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,150
I said, it seems like a girl.

1306
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,480
How do you that?

1307
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,150
I dreamed..I saw a peach.

1308
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:36,020
I dont care whether it's a son or daughter.

1309
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,020
Shit, we're late again.
I'm going now.

1310
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,700
Use this to buy anything
you wanna eat.

1311
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:52,970
Take it!

1312
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,000
-= Good Morning! =-

1313
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,530
-= Do you have time this weekend? =-

1314
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:26,340
Aigoo!

1315
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,810
What's wrong with you?

1316
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:29,540
Damn it!

1317
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:35,150
Here!

1318
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,210
What?

1319
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:38,350
Give this to Dan Ji.

1320
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,750
I bought this using your credit card.
Tell her you bought it.

1321
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:45,160
Okay.

1322
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,890
Aigoo seriously!
Enough!

1323
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,230
Why?

1324
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,230
Give a little attention to Dan Ji too.

1325
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:53,160
A pregnent young girl, home alone
she must be bored.

1326
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,170
What about me? I'm not bored?

1327
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,030
She's middle school student.

1328
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,240
You're middle age woman.

1329
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,370
You're so busy with pre-natal before.

1330
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,640
Do I have time lately?

1331
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:05,710
In the future, I'll be busy to raised the baby.

1332
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,580
Now I have to look for 
for more money.

1333
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:09,050
Seriously!

1334
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,120
Alright!

1335
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,460
Aigoo, seriously.

1336
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:22,790
How's your preparation 
for the art competition?

1337
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,130
Why you brought it up?

1338
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,270
You should watch out how you dress.

1339
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:33,070
Do I look I can take part in the competition?

1340

1341
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:44,550

Help me explain it the teacher.

1342
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,220
Help me explain it the teacher.

1343
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,280
Hey!

1344
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,510
You scared me.

1345
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:11,910
How are you doing?

1346
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:16,580
But I never heard she has a Joka.
<font color="#ffff00">[Joka - niece/nephew]</font>

1347
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,380
Did she mention when she'll be back?

1348
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,390
=I'm on my way.
Go to your room.=

1349
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,920
=Why did you let him in? Seriously!=

1350
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,460
He followed me in.
What can I do?

1351
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:27,390
Is it your aunt?

1352
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,990
Give it to me!

1353
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:30,860
I'm not a bad guy!

1354
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,330
There's something I wanna tell her.

1355
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:33,130
Let go!

1356
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:33,930
I'm serious!

1357
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:35,130
Let me go!

1358
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,270
What do you want?

1359
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,940
Go to your room!

1360
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,350
It's not my child, is it?

1361
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:56,090
Didn't we used condom?

1362
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:59,820
Can't you tell me 
if it's not my child.

1363
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,760
I dont have anything to lose.

1364
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:03,960
I only cheated on you once.

1365
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,100
Aren't you too much?!

1366
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,630
We did it only once!

1367
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:15,440
For me, that's the last time.

1368
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:17,980
Ju Yeon...

1369
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:24,380
I love you.

1370
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,850
Let's start over.

1371
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,590
Bullshit!!

1372
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,990
Ju Yeon,  I beg you.

1373
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,720
Get out, you bastard!

1374
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,460
Damn it!

1375
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,800
If you come closer,
I'll call the police!

1376
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,070
I have nothing to lose.

1377
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,070
Let's wait & see!

1378
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,410
Eventho you're young & innocent,
you shouldn't be like that.

1379
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,550
Don't you even think?

1380
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:59,880
<i>Never mind. Enough.</i>

1381
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,150
<i>Is it not written in the contract
you can't go out?</i>

1382
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:04,420
If this happened again
be prepared!

1383
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,890
Enough, enough.
Drop it.

1384
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:08,160
She must be so bored at home alone.

1385
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,760
<i>However bored she is, 
she cant do that.</i>

1386
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,100
<i>Enough, stop it.</i>

1387
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,800
Eonni, ice cream...

1388
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,410
This is galbi jjim.
<font color="#ffff00">[Galbi jjim - steamed short ribs]</font>

1389

1390

pregnant mom.

1391
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,950
Eat it when you're hungry.

1392
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:04,350
Do you have constipation?

1393
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,950
It's normal.

1394
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,690
Lately, you fart a lot, didn't ya?

1395
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,970
This is ingeo-jeub.
<font color="#ffff00">[ingeo jeub - goldfish tonic]</font>

1396
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:24,640
It's good for pregnant mom.

1397
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,570
Drink it! Okay?

1398
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:29,440
Drink up.

1399
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:39,320
Have this!

1400
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,590
Oh,

1401
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:54,130
You dont have pregnancy clothing, do you?

1402
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:57,070
I sew this for you.

1403
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,870
I dont know whether it would fit you.

1404
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:03,610
If you have time later

1405
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:05,340
try it on.

1406
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:20,690
Right! Being home alone, you must be bored.

1407
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,560
Ju Yeon, due to works
she's a bit busy lately.

1408
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,700
She's not a bad person.

1409
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,430
I hope you'd understand.

1410
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:33,100
Eonni and Joo Min Ho often dating?

1411
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:38,710
No! She's not abandoning you 
because of him.

1412
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,710
She's a bit less sensitive.

1413
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,050
I've known her for almost 20 years.

1414
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:45,120
She's...

1415
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:49,390
She's a bit...

1416
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:53,120
Please understand her a little.

1417
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,930
There's a lot I need to understand about her.

1418
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:59,130
I think so too.

1419
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,480
Let me borrow this for today.

1420
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,680
<i>Didn't you use your room?</i>

1421
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,950
<i>Why there's a lot of stuff in here?</i>

1422
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,550
That room is not mine.

1423
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:22,890
It's the baby's room.

1424
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,360
Where are you going?

1425
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:34,900
I have a date.

1426
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,900
You promised to go to 
the hospital with me.

1427
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,310
You're so busy, how are you going
to raised the baby later?

1428
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,440
I forgot.

1429
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:47,440
Let's go together next time.

1430
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:58,260
Sorry.

1431
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:02,130
I thought I have another tent.

1432
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:02,930
There's no other.

1433
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,660
This tent is yours, Ju Yeon-nim.

1434
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,270
Why are you calling me 'Ju Yeon-nim'?

1435
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,130
Later, the baby will be born. 

1436
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:11,470
Relationship should be cut off.

What is that?

1439
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:27,350
Oh, that is the baby's head.

1440
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,360
<i>This is the arms, legs.</i>

1441
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,430
This is the baby's heart. 

1442
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,960
This is the sound of the heart beat.

1443
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,840
Can you turn it off?

1444
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,520
How busy are those people?

1445
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,390
That you have to come here alone.

1446
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,990
Now, cis it possible to abort it?

1447
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,800
Hot! Hot!

1448
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,000
hot!

1449
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,540
Please wait a little more, okay?

1450
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,470
Almost ready.

=Nuna=

1454
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:33,680
Did you fight with Dan Ji lately?

1455
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,350
Why?

1456
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:37,820
Dan Ji talked a little bit weird today.

1457
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:39,160
What did she said?

1458
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:42,760
=She asked whether it's still possible to do the abortion.=

1459
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,560
What?

1460
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,830
There's more, I didn't told Dan Ji yet...

1461
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,430
but the position of the fetus is abnormal.

1462
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:48,630
What do you mean?

1463
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:51,030
We need more time to observe.

1464
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,440
Although it's not too late.

1465
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:55,040
You need to give more attention to Dan Ji.

=Don't let her come here alone.=

1468
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:01,980
Talk again later.

=Are you serious not to participate
in the art competition?=

01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,210

=There's still no statement from her agency about this issue.=

When I get the money, 
I'll give it all to you, Eonni.

1494
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:28,870
To pay the debt or whatever.
I told them that.

1495
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,730
Forgive me, Eonni.

1496
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:33,800
You're doing great.
Who said you're guilty?

1497
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,740
Yeah, you should asked for 1 million Won.

1498
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:39,810
Eonni, dont do this.

1499
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,750
If we can get a lot more money,
why not?

1500
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,280
You still can continue to study art, like you said.

1501
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,020
Because I feel guilty.

1502
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,550
Eonni, dont do this to Ju Yeon Eonni.

1503
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:51,420
The amount that I asked is enough.

1504
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,690
Shut up! you're giving me headache!

1505
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:55,830
Ju Yeon Eonni treat me well.

get out of the car!

Will she take care of you all your life?

Will she be responsible until the end?

then go to her!

you also want to take the baby away?

What do you mean make her pregnant?

That can go all wrong.

We met her after she get pregnant.

1527
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:54,550
So you guys want to deceive this innocent girl.

1528
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,290
You persuaded her to sell her baby, isn't it?

 inprisoned in Pyeongchang-dong house.

It's all written here in her diary.

You planned all this from the start?

1549
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:57,280
How can you do this to me?

1550
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:00,480
Why?

1551
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,490
The money is not enough?

1552
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:05,290
"Wait! Why I stopped here?"

1553
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,490
"The other party is Go Ju Yeon."

1554
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,690
"I can demand for more money."

1555

"What can she do?"

1556
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:10,360
"Nobody will believe her."

Cry? Why do you cried for?

1560
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:22,110
I'm the one who should cry right now.

1561

1562

You're the one who're not responsible until the end!
Everything is because of you!

you must be disappointed, right?

1565
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:45,330
How do you feel now?

1566
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:48,000
Due to baseless rumour, 
I was down for quite awhile.

1567

in acting for drama.

That's a lot of guts she had.
She dared to cover it up some more.

1577
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,890
She's having a mental breakdown.

1578
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,160
Have you ever see normal people do what she did?

She trusted you to a bastard like me.

in this past 20 years.

1591
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:10,210
In this chaotic showbiz world

1592
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,150
<i>we have never failed
and always stand strong.</i>

1593
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:23,690
Furthermore, if we want to avoid law suit, they asked you 
personally to make a formal apology statement.

1594
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:40,780
Let's eat!

1595
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:43,450
Thank you for the food!

1596
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:49,450
Whatever happened, we can say
we have successfully gone through this problem.

1597
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,790
<i>Let's make a toast!</i>

1598
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:53,460
Yes, lets!

1599
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,060
Cheers.

1600
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:57,590
<i>We menage to solve the problem like this
you can say we're lucky.</i>

1601
01:28:57,730 --> 01:28:58,800
<i>You all have worked hard..</i>

1602
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,000
I heard a lot of company looking to scout you.

1603
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,940
Later on, just accept their offer.

1604
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,670
Eonni!

1605
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:14,280
Why? Didn't I said anything wrong?

1606
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,680
All the money that I got from previous jobs,
I used it to solve this problem.

1607
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,890
Why you all have that look?

1608
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,890
Then, all these people who're sitting here, 
what are their fault?

1609
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:29,090
What?

1610
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:31,090
What different is this to a punishment?

1611
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,700
<i>Sang Mi, don't talk like that.</i>

1612
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,100
And you Eonni, what kind of great thing did you do?

1613
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,970
What right do you have to snap at them?

1614
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:40,040
Everything happen because of
 your wishy washy personality,

1615
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:43,370
they're the one going around kneeling,
begging for forgiveness, one by one until everything settled.

1616
01:29:43,370 --> 01:29:45,380
Sorry then.

1617
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,380
Everytime you all have to help
crazy person like me to solve problems,

1618
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:49,250
because of that, sorry & thank you.

1619
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:50,310
That's why even in this rainy day

1620
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:53,780
I was so busy from morning till late to prepare
food for you guys.

1621
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:55,390
Who asked for these food?

1622
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:59,790
Eonni, you think you're filling our stomach, aren't you?

1623
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,930
<i>When you're feeling happy,</i>

1624
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:05,660
you go to western food restaurant,
clubs,  dating with younger guys.

1625
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:08,200
<i>When you have problems  
& dont want to be home alone,</i>

1626
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,000
we're all called to have dinner here.

1627
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,200
Everyday you blame others
saying nobody is on your side.

1628
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:19,680
Eonni, have you ever been on anybody's side?

1629
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,210
If you dont want to eat, get out!

1630
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,680
If you dont want to come, 
dont ever come.

1631
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:30,090
Ga Eun, San Ah, lets go!

1632
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:31,420
Sang Mi!

1633
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:40,500
I want to clear things up,

1634
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,700
I did not forced you guys to come.

1635
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,100
If you want to go, just go.

1636
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,170
Hey, Mi Rae!

1637
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:55,180
I'm going too.

1638
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:03,850
Not all the money is yours.

1639
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:08,530
Pyeong Goo, Mi Rae and I
worked hard to get it too.

1640
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,550
Why?

1641
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:32,680
why are you still here?

1642
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,950
Hey, Go Joo Yeon, you're really!

1643
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,030
Don't cry too much.

1644
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,190
=Starting today, it would be the rainy season.=

1645
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:12,860
=This is due to the long draught
meeting the rain.=

1646
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:16,590
=When you leave for work,
don't forget to bring along the umbrella.=

1647
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:19,130

1648
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:20,330

1649
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:53,300
Everything's ready?

1650
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:54,230
Yes.

1651
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,170
So what your plan after this?

1652
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:01,040
With my driving skill being like this, 
there's no company going to hire me.

1653
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,570
It's better to go back home.

1654
01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:07,840
This is not much. Take it.

1655
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:11,450
Use it for your needs.
You have worked hard all this time.

1656
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:25,460
Em, how's Dan Ji?

1657

01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:57,170
If you being like this, you and Ju Yeon
it's the end of your life, dont you know?

1743
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:58,240
=I know.=

1744
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:00,780
I know but Daepyo-nim...

1745
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:06,780
Go Ju Yeon, the nation witch, this time
she's doing what's right.

1746
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:09,850
=Daepyo-nim... Hyeong-nim, who have my extreme respect......=

1747
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:13,720
This time, please help me
delay them for awhile.

1748
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,790
I beg of you.

1749
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:17,860
=I'm sorry.=

1750
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,470
=Announcement.=

1751
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:33,480
=All student who are going to participate
please take your seat.=

1752
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:47,760
What are you doing here?
Instead of going inside.

1753
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:52,030
Eonni...

1754
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:06,040
Lets go!

1755
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:22,460
We want to register.

1756
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,190
Registration proof!

1757
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:33,800
<i>Go Ju Yeon! Go Ju Yeon!</i>

1758
01:43:34,070 --> 01:43:35,670
<i>Is she crazy?</i>

1759
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,610
Do well!

1760
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:47,820
This is going to be hard for us.

1761
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,550
Why?

1762
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,890
Because this is an activity coordinate by the school.

1763
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:55,960
Students from all over the nation
come here to take part.

1764
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:57,430
If that so, after she finished, we'll be going.

1765
01:43:57,830 --> 01:44:01,560
It's not the problem with drawing, 
but her condition is the problem.

1766
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,240
What's up with her?

1767
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:07,970
Go Ju Yeon-ssi.

1768
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:10,240
What are your relationship with this student?

1769
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:12,910
I'm her guardian.

1770
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:16,650
<i>Competition is going to start,</i>

1771
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:17,850
<i>All student please be ready!</i>

1772
01:44:17,850 --> 01:44:19,580
Please go home!

1773
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:21,180
We have no home to go back.

1774
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:23,320
Go Ju Yeon-ssi, dont do this.

1775
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,190
This is my personal problem.

1776
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:26,260
We'll go right after she finish.
Please let her in.

1777
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:29,990
Just because you're a celebrity,
you think you can do whatever, is it?

1778
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:31,330
<i>Exactly!</i>

1779
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:34,260
For the sake of the staff who have been working hard
for this event, please dont do this.

1780
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:35,730
It's the same thing, 
she has been working hard for this.

1781
01:44:35,730 --> 01:44:36,670
Please let her go inside.

1782
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:39,070
- Please let her. 
- What are you doing?!

1783
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:40,400
Delaying the children competition.

1784
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:43,210
If you persist, I'm going to call the reporters.

1785
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,610
Reporter?

1786
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:53,220
That's actually what I'm going to do.

1787
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:54,680
Such a coinsident.

1788
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:56,290
Call them!

1789
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:58,550
After all, my life is ruined.

1790
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:00,420
I was not scared one bit of the reporters.

1791
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:01,220
Lets call all reporters here!

1792
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:02,420
Call them all!

1793
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:04,690
What you think this place is, rising your voice like that. 

1794
01:45:04,690 --> 01:45:07,100
I dont want to rise my voice.

1795
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:08,560
That's why, let this girl in & draw.

1796
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,430
What are you doing in front of the children?

1797
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:11,900
A pregnant young girl is
not for show in public!

1798
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,500
Who said I'm going to show it?

1799
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:16,840
<i>The children who come here are
innocent kids who want to draw.</i>

1800
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,110
<i>So stop rising your voice, 
and get out of here!</i>

1801
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:20,840
What a shame.

1802
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,650
What do you mean shame?

1803
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:25,250
Why are we should be ashame?

1804
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:27,650
what is the different between those children inside & her?

1805
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,320
The only different is the belly.

1806
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:31,790
<i>Showing off!</i>

1807
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:32,990
What a disgrace!

1808
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:34,720
Yes, I'm know I'm crazy.

1809
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,460
So what? Why? Why?

1810
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:40,730
Most probably there's a reason.

1811
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:46,740
But, the boy who made her
being like this

1812
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,740
even went to America to represent the nation.

1813
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:52,210
<i>But why she...</i>

1814
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:58,480
Why she not even permitted to 
take part in this small competition?

1815
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:06,090
Why are you crying? Dont cry!

1816
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:12,760
Serioulsy, all you adults!

1817
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:16,230
Then, all you here think

1818
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:19,700
in the future
she cannot do anything?

1819
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:23,840
<i>What a shame.</i>

1820
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:27,040
She almost give up everything.

1821
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:31,050
but she come here in the end
after summon up all her courage.

1822
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:35,720
Only this time.

1823
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:43,860
Give her this opportunity, no?

1824
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:48,260
I beg all of you.

1825
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:17,230
Dont cry.

1826
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:20,960
Draw nicely.

1827
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:24,570
=Student's gurdian please wait outsite.=

1828
01:47:24,830 --> 01:47:26,030
Yes, sorry.

1829
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:50,460
Sorry.

1830
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:56,060
<i>Sorry.</i>

1831
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:58,200

1834

1835
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:13,740
<i>Go Ju Yeon-ssi!</i>

1836
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:25,750
Go Ju Yeon-ssi!

1837
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,100
<i>What really happen?
Please explain!</i>

1838
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:21,680
<i>Guardian of giving birth mom is here?</i>

1839
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:27,020
The pregnant mom refused to be anaesthetized.

1840
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:28,620
So we cant operate.

1841
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:32,090
<i>Please go inside & see her.</i>

1842
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,640
Dan Ji, now...

1843
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:55,180
the baby's condition is not good,
so we need the operation.

1844
01:50:58,510 --> 01:51:03,320
Dont worry.
After you wake up, everything will be ok.

1845
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:10,390
You can do it, Dan Ji.

1846
01:51:10,930 --> 01:51:12,260
Actually...

1847
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:18,400
Before this, I always thought how nice
it is to get 100 million Won.

1848
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:26,010
Everything is because of me,
I've never think of the baby.

1849
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:27,610
I wanna love the baby.

1850
01:51:29,610 --> 01:51:31,080
You too, because of me...

1851
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:32,550
No, Dan Ji.

1852
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:34,420
It's not your fault.

1853
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,690
Everything is because of me.

1854
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:41,360
Eonni, please forgive me.

1855
01:51:42,290 --> 01:51:44,960
Eonni, are you prepared to be
the mother of my child?

1856
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:48,560
My baby...

1857
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:51,900
How can I give it up to some stranger?

1858
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:02,710
Our baby...

1859
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:06,450
is not going anywhere.

1860
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:11,920
I will raise it up.

1861
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,520
Understand?

1862
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:23,000
Furthermore...

1863
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:26,740
Your dream the other time, do you know the meaning of it?

1864
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:32,610
A baby without both the parents,
also can become successful.

1865
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:52,420
<i>I'm bankrupt.</i>

1866
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,900
<i>I just turned 42 but already being a grandmom.</i>

1867
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:04,830
<i>I dont know how to go on living.</i>

1868
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:12,970
<i>Independent film directors
will not hire me anymore.</i>

1869
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:19,110
Are you okay?

1870
01:54:19,110 --> 01:54:23,120
<i>That's when Dan Ji's ambition changed
about 10 times.</i>

1871
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:25,920
<i>This kid, seriously.</i>

1872
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:31,260
<i>What's weird is...</i>

1873
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:33,800
<i>What really weird is...</i>

1874
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,400
<i>When I see the child, 
it raised my spirit.</i>

1875
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,140
<i>I dont really like myself being like this.</i>

1876
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:44,610
What is this?

1877
01:54:44,610 --> 01:54:45,810
Begger, is it?

1878
01:54:49,810 --> 01:54:51,280
Aigoo, you're shocked?

1879
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,220
Dont cry.

1880
01:55:04,490 --> 01:55:06,760
I love romans.

1881
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:09,700
Ah, okay.

1882
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:11,030
Look at this.

1883
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:16,370
Yeah, yeah,

1884
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:20,380
But Daepyo-nim,  yangju that you like is all gone! What should we do?
<font color="#ffff00">[Yangju - alcoholic drink from the west.]</font>

1885
01:55:21,310 --> 01:55:22,780
This is enough.

1886
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:24,380
Oh, did you here?

1887
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:25,310
What?

1888
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:28,650
Dan Ji has a boyfriend.

1889
01:55:29,050 --> 01:55:30,120
Hey!

1890
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:32,790
Seriously this kid!
Did you go to school to study?

1891
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:34,260
Of course!

1892
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:35,590
<i>She said she did study!</i>

1893
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:36,660
<i>Never mind it!</i>

1894
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:37,990
Let's eat! Eat!

1895
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:38,930
Lets!

1896
01:55:38,930 --> 01:55:41,330
This kid, be prepared if the exam result sucks this time!

1897
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,270
I'll stop giving your tuition money.

1898
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:50,140
You're not blood related but why both of you so obses with boys?

1899
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:51,610
It's so weird!

1900
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:54,140
It's been a long time since I'm in relationship.

1901
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:56,540
Omo Eonni, is Joo Min Ho a woman?

1902
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:59,350
He's just a friend, a friend.

1903
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:02,680
There's you 'friend' just arrive. A friend.

1904
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:06,820
<i>Lets eat! Eat!</i>

1905
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:09,490
<i>Delicious isn't it?</i>

1906
01:56:09,490 --> 01:56:11,890
<i>I wanna eat this.</i>

1907
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:13,500
See how try to pretty up.

1908
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:15,760
Hey!

1909
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,230
Are you crazy?

1910
01:56:19,630 --> 01:56:20,570
Ah this...

1911
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:22,840
Who pours barley here?

1912
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:23,510
Who did this?

1913
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,710
Kim Dan Ji, you...!

1914
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:26,310
Is she?

1915
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:27,110
Not her, I did it.

1916
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:28,310
It's crazy, seriously crazy.

1917
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:30,850
I drink it.

1918
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:33,250
I thought it was alcohol.

1919
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:33,920
Damn it!
