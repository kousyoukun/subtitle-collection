He won a bunch of medals in the army.

and made, you know, a bomb.

If you think back to Switzerland,

1553
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:51,181
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?

01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:54,142
Well, for the first 20 minutes,

And the next hour...

1557
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:04,444

one-step shortcut to the lobby.

If you know what I mean.

1559
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:09,115

what happened to the first mouse.

1560

But as I looked out over that city,

1561
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:14,788
nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,

1562
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,123
no one was even looking.

1563
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:21,211
I had a thought that would
guide me for years to come.

1564

Anonymity, Tony.

1565
01:21:24,673 --> 01:21:26,299
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.

Right?

01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:30,136

You're something else.

You have met him, I assume?

Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

over the top sometimes.

1575
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:48,363
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...

1576

He's a stage actor.

Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.

1738
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:16,662
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

1739
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:18,414
Is that...
Is that important?

1740
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:20,291
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1741
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:24,128
TONY: So?

1742
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:26,047
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?

1743
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,215
I mean, we don't have any transport.

1744
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:28,299
- Right.
-(BEER OPENS)

1745
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:31,302
Hey, Ringo.

1746
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:34,013
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1747
01:30:36,224 --> 01:30:38,726
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1748
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:39,936
But we also have to figure out this

1749
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:41,771
-vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1750
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,064
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1751
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:44,148
Oh! That's the vice president.

1752
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:45,691
Thanks.

1753
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:47,443
Hello?

1754
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:49,195
TONY". Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1755
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:51,155
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1756
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:53,533
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1757
01:30:53,616 --> 01:30:55,118
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1758
01:30:55,535 --> 01:30:57,912
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1759
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,248
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1760
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:03,626
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1761
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:04,752
I think we're good, here.

1762
01:31:04,836 --> 01:31:06,838
RHODEY: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.

1763
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:08,923
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1764
01:31:09,215 --> 01:31:10,550
They're gonna take out
the president somehow.

1765
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:12,260
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1766
01:31:12,552 --> 01:31:14,595
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1767
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:17,598
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1768
01:31:17,765 --> 01:31:19,183
- Thank you, Colonel.
Rhodes and Stark out.

1769
01:31:21,102 --> 01:31:22,812
Everything okay, sir?

1770
01:31:23,813 --> 01:31:24,897
Couldn't be better.

1771
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:33,239
I love you, babe.

1772
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:55,344
Colonel Rhodes.

1773
01:31:55,428 --> 01:31:58,764
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1774
01:32:03,603 --> 01:32:04,729
RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.

1775
01:32:04,812 --> 01:32:07,607
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

1776
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:09,400
JARVIS: Sir,
I have an update from Malibu.

1777
01:32:09,483 --> 01:32:11,611
The cranes have finally arrived,

1778
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,738
and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.

1779
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:15,531
TONY: And what about
the suit I'm wearing?

1780
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:17,950
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.

1781
01:32:18,034 --> 01:32:20,119
That's going to have to do.

1782
01:32:28,419 --> 01:32:30,254
Oh! Here he comes.
Here he comes. Get a quick picture.

You're looking right at him.

2063
01:52:55,186 --> 01:52:58,189
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

2064

I am the Mandarin!

That was really violent.

2079
01:54:10,803 --> 01:54:12,805
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

2080
01:54:12,972 --> 01:54:15,016
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

01:54:18,478 --> 01:54:20,146
Who's the hot mess now?

2082

It's still debatable.

You'll think of something.

- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.

No.

as Christmas morning began,

Then, come the mistakes.

"Why stop there?"

Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous,

had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.

my chest,

you were such a good listener.
