2
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,009
- It's really been a long time.
- Yeah!

3
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,084
How do you find Hawaii?

4
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,050
It's very awesome!

5
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,052
I see.

6
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,282
So Hawaii is really great.

7
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,354
Since my scheduled was completely taken, so I wasn't able to come,

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,484
what was good?

9
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,856
The ocean? Weather?

10
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:03,894
Men.

11
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:04,764
Huh?

12
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:08,668
That tour guide was so very kind.

13
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,203
Ah, I see.

14
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,905
It was the best week of my life.

15
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,907
We went to scuba diving together.

16
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,509
We watched the night view of Tantalus.

17
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,277
Then?

18
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,378
We went shopping.

19
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,381
And we climbed the Diamond Head.

20
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,749
Ah, I see.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,652
Then we got drunk in the bar of the hotel.

22
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,153
What?!

23
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,689
The drinks at Hawaii are very tasty, you know!

24
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,558
They are always tasty to you.

25
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,194
It was a million times more tasty when I'm drinking with him.

26
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,061
We...

27
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,463
...even danced in my room.

28
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,765
And he started being aggressive.

29
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,100
Oh my!

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,568
But I opposed him.

31
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,603
No, I'm very sure you didn't oppose him.

32
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,505
He's really good.

33
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,408
And it was a dazzling night.

34
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,876
But by the time we parted...

35
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,466
And asked his contact details...

36
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,237
He said he's gay.

37
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,947
He said his body is used by God.

38
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,515
He said he hates calling.

39
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,083
He said he's married.

40
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,785
Ah, I see.

41
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,453
Even though it was just a fling...

42
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,488
I can never forget it.

43
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,790
Wait. Did you asked his name?

44
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,924
Daisuke Yuge.

45
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,126
Daisuke Yuge.

46
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,260
Daisuke Yuge.

47
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,361
Daisuke Yuge.

48
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,329
Daisuke Yuge.

49
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,521
Daisuke Yuge.

50
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,629
Come on, Daisuke!

51
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,700
I'm sorry, I should go.

52
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,098
What? Spy?

53
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,303
You're a spy?

54
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,106
I can't tell because I've only seen them on movies.

55
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,307
What do spies do?

56
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,408
Sorry.

57
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,177
It's a secret that's why I didn't tell you.

58
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,079
The details of my work is top secret.

59
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,113
Is it alright if I contact you?

60
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,282
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,584
My next mission is in the Middle East.

62
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,220
I'm not sure if I would be alive next time we'll meet...

63
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,325
Oh no, they must have been listening...

64
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,528
Code 187.

65
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,795
Codename: "Siberian White Wolf".

66
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,596
Password is...

67
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,899
Will you return to Japan? I'll be waiting for you in Japan.

68
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,431
No, Yuriko.

69
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,193
It's Yukie.

70
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,736
Yukie.

71
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,373
I used a pseudonym to protect you.

72
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,775
It's time we part.

73
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,268
I'm sad.

74
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:58,969
I'll be right there.

75
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,520
Who are you?

76
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,336
Keep going. And I'll pay you 20 bucks.

77
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:11,003
Okay.

78
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:12,588
Didn't you just land on your balls?

79
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:14,715
Yeah, it's killing me.

80
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:39,073
[ 50 Kaime no Fasuto Kisu 
50 First Kisses ]

81
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,367
Daisuke, look at this. This is great quality.

82
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,439
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

83
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,107
It was really hard finding a stone artisan who would make such a thing.

84
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,881
But I still found the 12th most skilled stone artisan in Hawaii,

85
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,144
and asked him to make it.

86
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,514
That's nice.

87
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,178
But how many stone artisans are there in Hawaii?

88
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,084
12.

89
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,349
There are a lot.

90
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,617
But it's still well made so it's wonderful.

91
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,759
Anyway, what will you use this for?

92
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,158
A new tourist attraction.

93
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,891
The word "spiritual spot" is really enticing to the Japanese.

94
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,398
Like some little water spring.

95
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,660
Even though there are only trickling of water,

96
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,236
but if you say that it's a spiritual spot, they'll be very thankful.

97
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,861
I'll say that it is a spiritual stone that

98
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,702
aliens placed when they came to this island.

99
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:36,805
This?

100
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,739
Yeah.

101
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,778
There's the "The Mouth of Truth" in Rome, right?

102
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,744
This would be like the Hawaii version.

103
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,338
It has that headpiece like that of Kamehameha.

104
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,849
Hmm, but since it was made thoughtlessly,

105
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,182
it looks like UltraSeven doing this face.

106
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,812
Well, when a couple comes here,

107
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,480
and they put their hands together inside the mouth,

108
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,355
then the sensor inside it will activate and then...

109
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,825
Hame~!

110
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,028
If they hear that voice,

111
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,534
it would mean like the promise of true love?

112
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,331
Isn't it like a bad joke?!

113
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,405
Hame~!

114
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:12,060
Isn't it just a bad joke?!

115
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,874
In the first place, what kind of Japanese bad joke

116
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,539
is that aliens placed this in Hawaii?

117
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,843
No, it's alright. I'm sure they'll believe it.

118
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,214
You know, when Japanese comes to Hawaii, they're usually merry.

119
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,150
They'll believe in anything!

120
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,243
I see.

121
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,119
Okay, then I'll include this to my tour tomorrow.

122
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:25,918
Hey!

123
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,982
Oh, oh, oh! What's that?

124
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,118
Here's something he brought.

125
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,217
Okay, you should wear this too.

126
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,763
Oh! Why? Why? What's this?

127
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,694
Commemorative photo.

128
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,788
It's when aliens put it here.

129
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,231
Something to show the guests as evidence.

130
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,270
There's no way there would be a camera that long ago!

131
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,235
Well,

132
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,001
there's no way that beings who rode a UFO coming here doesn't have a camera.

133
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,501
True.

134
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,104
That's right.

135
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,413
Put it on. 

136
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,651
This is awesome!

137
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,452
Isn't it?!

138
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,986
I wonder what the aliens 

139
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,955
thought when they left this picture? 

140
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,124
They're just showing that the aliens have left it there.

141
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,892
Is there a need for them to show it?

142
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,961
Forget the details.

143
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,097
Guests who are couples or families

144
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,632
will flock this landmark!

145
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,234
It would be bad if other tour agencies will steal it,

146
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,369
so include it in our guide map.

147
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,770
Nobody would be deceived by that.

148
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,938
Speaking of which,

149
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,140
show them the starry sky at North Shore.

150
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,798
You know the best view, right?

151
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:16,897
You're really a jerk.

152
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,374
Bitch! Idiot!

153
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,309
I would never show that to the guests.

154
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,278
While showing the stars to a chatty female tourist,

155
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,906
"Wow! What's this?!"

156
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,507
"Um, is it alright to take a picture for my Instagram?"

157
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,746
is what they'll say and after five minutes, they'll just get bored of it.

158
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,482
Just what the hell is "What's this?".

159
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,287
They're the stars!!

160
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,360
I brought them there to see the stars, didn't I?!

161
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,484
I don't get it.

162
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,994
In the first place, why do they get bored watching stars?

163
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,586
Then they quickly forget about the stars.

164
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,188
They'll get pancakes, Acai Bowl, or shaved ice.

165
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,028
Gobble them and eat like a pig.

166
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,126
"A! Wow! What's this?! Wow!"

167
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,705
I brought you here to eat a pancake, you know!

168
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,000
- We get it, so calm down.
- It's pancake!

169
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:48,971
Calm down.

170
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,908
Yeah, that's because those are the girls who get bored easily at that starry sky.

171
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,478
Huh? It's unexpectedly few today.

172
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,514
Hey, you should stop that already. We'll have a bad reputation.

173
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,241
What should I stop?

174
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,808
Becoming an important tourist guide, and pile up women to go to bed with you at work.

175
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,820
It's not my fault. They're the ones who fall for me.

176
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,152
But you shouldn't since they're our customers.

177
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,418
Huh? I shouldn't?

178
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,254
It's fine.

179
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,725
Boss! Are you stupid?!

180
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,887
How dare you call your boss stupid?!

181
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,725
I'm surry!

182
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,321
You don't actually feel sorry when you say that!

183
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,263
Yes, I'm not.

184
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,699
Besides, I'm also a tour guide.

185
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,327
I'm also pretty much giving tours to girls.

186
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,700
But there is nobody

187
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,536
who tells me their room number even once.

188
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,404
Why?

189
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,771
Maybe they mistook you as a Samoan.

190
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,901
That's it.

191
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,138
Bam bala bam bala bam!

192
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,543
Ah! Chomp!

193
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,478
Fire is delicious!

194
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,947
Idiots! Who is a Samoan?!

195
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,176
That's ridiculous!

196
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,912
Why am I not popular with girls?

197
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,544
Tell me the reason.

198
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:42,954
Maybe because you're fat?

199
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:43,653
Huh?

200
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,560
You'll say that? Hey, you'll say that?

201
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,496
Okay then, I'm off.

202
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,330
There are at least ten there.

203
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,576
How does he manage that every night.

204
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,890
Pegasus' 94th star darkened a little bit.

205
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,996
The reason it darkened would probably be...

206
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,346
What?

207
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,336
No way...

208
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,410
Geez!

209
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,139
You just got fixed!

210
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,420
Aloha honey. What can I get for you?

211
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:31,925
I'll take a cup of coffee.

212
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:33,802
You want it with you spam and eggs?

213
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:35,512
No. I already ate.

214
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:37,514
I'm just waiting for a pull truck.

215
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:39,725
What did you eat?

216
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,894
Peanut butter sandwich with milk.

217
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:45,856
That's a snack! Eat eggs.

218
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:48,317
Nick! Spam and eggs, order up.

219
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:54,026
You luck peanut butter?

220
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:54,031
Yeah.
You luck peanut butter?

221
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:54,726
Yeah.

222
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,533
You want me to put em in your spam and egg?

223
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:58,118
No, no, no. That's okay.

224
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:27,230
Nice apron.

225
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,316
Oh, mahalo.

226
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,682
Okay.

227
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:01,098
Are you staring at me or her?

228
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:01,932
Shut up.

229
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:03,725
And eat your breakfast.

230
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:22,661
Well, Daisuke?

231
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:26,415
Hold on.

232
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:28,542
It should go soon.

233
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:33,059
But it's unusual that a man like you would fall in love at first sight.

234
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,560
I didn't say I fell in love at first sight.

235
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,229
But awhile ago, you said you are interested in her.

236
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,031
It's just that I'm interested in her a little.

237
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,299
But you haven't 

238
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,835
felt interested in anyone since now.

239
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,837
Shut up! I can't concentrate.

240
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,739
He got mad...

241
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,512
She probably lives here in Hawaii.

242
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,814
I wasn't able to talk to her though.

243
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,482
You'll return there, huh?

244
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,777
You'll really return there, huh?

245
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,417
That's right.

246
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,218
You only make your move to Japanese tourists anyway.

247
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,791
Yeah, that's my policy.

248
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,757
I should have restrictions.

249
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,696
I'll only get involved during their trip.

250
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,033
That's where the best women are.

251
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,465
Wow!

252
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:23,889
As I thought, that they are compromising.

253
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,308
There's another object over in the star.

254
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:27,684
This is a new discovery!

255
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,395
You can present your research paper at a conference.

256
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,731
Thanks, Griff.

257
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:36,276
I will investigate the size of this object.

258
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:39,696
This might just be an extra planet.

259
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:41,615
That would be stellar.

260
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:46,360
Sorry about always making you hit me up.

261
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:48,330
If you need any help, come any time.

262
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,915
Thanks.

263
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:53,502
And by the way, with all of your talent,

264
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:55,420
why do you work as a tour guide?

265
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,258
Because my dreams are too big.

266
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:01,051
I needed money.

267
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,845
Okay. I might need your help again.

268
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:05,514
Anytime.

269
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,051
Hey, hey.

270
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,090
Is it almost time for you to pay?

271
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,284
You also have to open up the eatery too.

272
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,055
It's alright. It doesn't what time I should open that eatery.

273
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,063
The eatery that you inherited might close up, you know.

274
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,564
It's alright even if we close up.

275
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,860
What's more important...

276
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,834
Tell me. Tell me, tell me, about the girl.

277
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,734
I told you, I'm not that interested much.

278
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,931
I will never see her again.

279
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,371
Really now?

280
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,067
No, I won't, with that kind of woman.

281
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,043
Women would just get in the way of my research.

282
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:46,179
There are other seats available.

283
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,185
You want me to put peanut butter again in your eggs today?

284
00:13:52,352 --> 00:13:52,936
Can you not?!

285
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:55,397
I didn't think you put it last time.

286
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:57,107
Oh, I said I would, right?

287
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:59,442
I thought it was a boring American joke.

288
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,069
Don't call it boring.

289
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:02,946
I'll take plain spam and eggs.

290
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:04,364
Okay.

291
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,410
Rui, everything okay?

292
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:09,870
Yeah, fine.

293
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,470
How about using this?

294
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,912
See?

295
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,914
It becomes a hinge.

296
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,785
I didn't thought of it.

297
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,621
It's something you'll realize if you look from afar.

298
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,056
So it's something you'll notice by from looking objectively.

299
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,359
Yeah, by looking objectively.

300
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,328
What's your name?

301
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,697
I'm Rui.

302
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,366
I'm Daisuke.

303
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,803
It's rare that a Japanese would go to this cafe.

304
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,972
Because I work as a tour guide,

305
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,408
I go around and search for delicious cafes like this one.

306
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,844
I see, that's why.

307
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,879
It's a wonderful house.

308
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,147
Then good luck continuing it.

309
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,748
Wait.

310
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,250
If you're alone, why don't you seat here?

311
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,292
Huh? Really?

312
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,453
Okay.

313
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,552
Thank you.

314
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,335
I thought you were an architect.

315
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,670
Huh? W-why?

316
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,004
Because of this.

317
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,040
Ah, I see.

318
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,342
My Dad is an architect.

319
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,944
- Oh, here?
- Yeah.

320
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,745
Oh, I see.

321
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,548
Um, being a tour guide is just my part time job.

322
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,051
I'm actually doing research on astronomy that's why I'm in Hawaii.

323
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,820
It's wonderful that you study stars.

324
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,322
The stars here in Hawaii are beautiful after all.

325
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,589
Yes, the best in the world.

326
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,725
The observatories around the world are here in Hawaii.

327
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,661
So you take tourists to beautiful sceneries.

328
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,229
No, actually...

329
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,931
I don't take tourists there.

330
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,367
Because it's my own important place.

331
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,402
I want to go there.

332
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,503
Will you?

333
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,440
But isn't it you own important place?

334
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,109
Yeah, well... That's right...

335
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,079
But I guess I'll get bored after five minutes so forget it.

336
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:21,714
Really...

337
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,783
There are lots of girls like that, huh?

338
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,452
Yeah, all of them are.

339
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,526
In the first place, the sky filled with stars,

340
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,062
there are lots of constellations, right?

341
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,166
These constellations are based on Greek mythology.

342
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,235
But it's actually about this Zeus' erotic stories.

343
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,503
What?

344
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,639
And well, that...

345
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,376
Even though Zeus originally has a wife named Hera,

346
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,777
he tends to have cheat on her.

347
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,381
And so that he won't be found out while cheating,

348
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,583
he changes to different appearance

349
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,985
like a bull or a swan.

350
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,456
You probably don't get it.

351
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,159
And there's the Gemini. The Gemini...

352
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,468
There was that incident where the god, Poseidon, got enrage with King Minos.

353
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:25,065
Poseidon, made King Minos' wife, Pasiphaë 

354
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,111
fall in love with a bull.

355
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,611
That's why, this Pasiphaë

356
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,808
said she wanted to have a child with this beautiful bull.

357
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,546
That's something unheard of so that's why King Minos...

358
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,780
I have to go.

359
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,651
Where?

360
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,053
It's my father's birthday.

361
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,149
Every year, we go harvest pineapple together.

362
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,693
Really? What a happy celebration.

363
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,890
Um, I had fun talking to you.

364
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,158
Me too.

365
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,627
How about we have breakfast again tomorrow?

366
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,703
Same time.

367
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,669
I have art class to teach starting at 10.

368
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,761
Are you a teacher?

369
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:55,965
Yes, of art.

370
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,406
Really?

371
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,005
I should've stopped talking about boring things. You should've said sooner.

372
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,878
Tomorrow then.

373
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:03,709
Yeah.

374
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,249
Ah, but sorry...

375
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,377
I can't make it tomorrow.

376
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,250
What?

377
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,147
I'll come!

378
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,292
Take care.

379
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,589
Next time, show me the stars.

380
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,458
Don't get bored, okay?

381
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,241
She's so cute!

382
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,777
He's the coolest Japanese I've met so far! 

383
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,612
Alright!

384
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,380
Alright! Alright!

385
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,683
What should I do?! What should I do?!

386
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,718
Alright!

387
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:40,519
Alright!

388
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,589
Alright!

389
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,623
Alright!

390
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:45,891
Alright!

391
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,226
Alright!

392
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,583
Alright!

393
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,865
Mosquito.

394
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,572
It's very slippery here.

395
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:04,969
Wow...

396
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,472
- B-bye...
- Yeah.

397
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:14,591
Japanese are so stupid.

398
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:08,645
Wait!

399
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,365
Aloha.

400
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,355
We're closed today.

401
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:12,190
That's a lie.

402
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:13,358
Order up!

403
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:17,320
Wait. I have to talk to you.

404
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,450
If you put peanut butter in my spam,

405
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:23,576
I'll kill you.

406
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:26,120
Now that's funny.

407
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,446
Do you want to talk about the erotic stories of the constellations again early in the morning?

408
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,348
What?

409
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,284
You probably looked up in the net about the erotic stories of Greek Mythology yesterday, huh?

410
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,175
What's with you, pervert?!

411
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,480
Go away!

412
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,317
It's just the continuation of our chat yesterday, right?

413
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,287
Yesterday?

414
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,359
I never met you in my life!

415
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:01,906
Nick!

416
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:02,991
Help me!

417
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:05,159
I got this!

418
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:06,536
Put that away!

419
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:07,870
You! Follow me!

420
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:12,667
What's going on?!

421
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:14,043
Why are you angry?

422
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:19,674
She's crazy?

423
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:24,804
Rui is very special. Very different from other people.

424
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:25,888
What do you mean?

425
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:28,141
About a year ago,

426
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:30,643
Rui was in a terrible car accident

427
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:32,812
on her way home from picking pineapples.

428
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:03,634
Her father broke some bones,

429
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:06,304
Rui suffered a serious head injury.

430
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:08,097
Caused her short-term memory.

431
00:22:08,431 --> 00:22:09,349
Amnesia?

432
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:13,269
She has all her long-term memory. That's a different side of the brain.

433
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,191
Her entire life, up to the night before the accident, she remembers.

434
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:20,651
She just can't retain any new information.

435
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:24,572
It's like her slate is wiped clean, every night she sleeps.

436
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:30,036
Something like a lie I would tell to an annoying chick to break up with.

437
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:31,829
It is right?

438
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:33,206
I wish!

439
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:37,377
She has no memory of yesterday.

440
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:38,836
What about her pineapple story?

441
00:22:41,214 --> 00:22:42,882
She says that everyday because

442
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:45,593
every morning she goes back to October 9th of that year.

443
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:49,013
She comes in for breakfast because that's what she did on Sundays.

444
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:51,432
That day was a Sunday too.

445
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,019
Time has stopped since that day a year ago.

446
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:56,270
No way!

447
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,607
What about the newspaper?

448
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:00,983
TV?

449
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:02,860
The internet?

450
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:05,822
Her father puts the newspaper on the port every night.

451
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:08,658
It's a special order from the day of the accident.

452
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:12,620
I don't know they avoid the TV or the internet.

453
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:19,544
Anyway, repeats the same thing every day.

454
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:23,756
Do they do that to hide the disease?

455
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,013
Dad.

456
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,114
 Welcome back.

457
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,816
You went alone?

458
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,909
No. A client gave it to me as a birthday present.

459
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,146
I can't just turn her down, can I?

460
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,449
I see.

461
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,353
She's probably a complete fan of you.

462
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:48,320
No, no.

463
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,361
Then...

464
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,929
Then we'll cancel for today?

465
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,998
Well, in exchange,

466
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,999
I'm thinking of repainting my office

467
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,398
in plain white.

468
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,435
It's a bit too white that it might give me headaches.

469
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,910
True, it needs more color.

470
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,538
If it's too white, the eyes will get tired.

471
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,543
Want to do it?

472
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,314
Is it okay?

473
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,719
Paint something that you like as my birthday present.

474
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,291
Leave it to me.

475
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,354
If an art teacher would paint this, it would be the best office ever.

476
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:26,791
But

477
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,128
But promise me that we'll definitely pick pineapples on Thanksgiving.

478
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:29,962
Yeah.

479
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:30,727
It's a promise!

480
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:31,860
Okay!

481
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,996
Then, I might as well watch some news.

482
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,803
I wonder what I should put here.

483
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,517
That's it!

484
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,621
I can do this!

485
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,296
Dinner...

486
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:04,831
For tonight's dinner...

487
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,233
Shut up.

488
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,566
Shut up!

489
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,764
Shut up!

490
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,637
What's tonight's dinner?

491
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:12,869
Spaghetti.

492
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:13,637
You know,

493
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,407
your filling it with many of  your sweat that it's disgusting.

494
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,574
It's not filled with many of my sweat.

495
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,672
Then it's filled with some of it?

496
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,116
Probably.

497
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,346
Don't say that. Geez.

498
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,719
Why do you need that kind of muscles? Geez, stop it.

499
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:26,654
Huh? What?

500
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,417
Huh?!

501
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,288
What?

502
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:29,291
Do you think I'm gay?

503
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,656
Wait, wait, wait. Huh?

504
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,252
Even though you're not listening, you'll say that?

505
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,126
Are you really?

506
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,198
Nyari.

507
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,197
What's nyari?

508
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,494
Huh? What's nyari?

509
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,097
Shut up, you're noisy. Shut up.

510
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,036
My head hurts. My head hurts!

511
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,174
My head hurts!

512
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,242
Hey, come on!

513
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,003
You should watch the news!

514
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,248
I'm looking forward to it~

515
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,020
707.

516
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,493
708.

517
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,868
Huh? Huh? Huh? Where is the remote?

518
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,130
- 709.
- Remote! The remote!

519
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,333
Huh? Huh? Do you know where is the remote?

520
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,634
Huh? Why isn't here? Why?!

521
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,572
710.

522
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,439
I would build a great wall.

523
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,309
Why are you in a panic?

524
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,408
Huh? I'm not panicky at all.

525
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,575
I'm not panicky at all.

526
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,689
Shintaro you're all sweaty.

527
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,952
That comes from my muscle training.

528
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,493
Um, so how is the painting?

529
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,426
You should look forward to it.

530
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,122
Ah, okay.

531
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,425
I hate Trump.

532
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,225
I wonder what will happen if he'll be the president?

533
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,132
Well...

534
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,227
It's impossible that Hillary would lose.

535
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,299
If you say that, I'm sure it would be fine.

536
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,673
If Trump will become the president, America and Japan will be in big trouble.

537
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,075
But the announcer

538
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,081
said that Trump might win, you know.

539
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,746
The one who loses washes the dishes.

540
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,483
Wanna bet?

541
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,780
You're on.

542
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:05,686
Yesterday, we did some street polling.

543
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:09,148
And the passion for Trump was more than expected.

544
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:11,108
Trump just might just win.

545
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,857
Shintaro, that's amazing!

546
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,226
How did you know?

547
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,630
It seems like recently

548
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,568
I had some power of a psychic.

549
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,569
Probably...

550
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,536
It's because of my muscles!

551
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,574
Oh, that's amazing, huh?

552
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,666
So if you gain muscles, you'll become a psychic, huh?!

553
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,340
What? Is that even possible?

554
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,772
Yeah, that is possible.

555
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,216
Then I'll go ahead and do my best.

556
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,794
Go and do your best!

557
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,323
Go and do your best!

558
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,116
Shiver, shiver, shiver.

559
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,975
Why am I in a mess?

560
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,068
Shiver, shiver, shiver. Do your best, Rui!

561
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,572
What?! What?!

562
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,733
You know,

563
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:02,541
if you do that again, I'll really going to hit you!

564
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:03,477
I'll do my best!!

565
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,707
Not you.

566
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:11,285
Happy birthday, dear Dad!

567
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:15,415
Happy birthday to you!

568
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,488
Thank you!

569
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,899
Happy 25th birthday, Dad!

570
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,064
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Did you just hear that?

571
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:26,899
Did you?

572
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:27,994
What?!

573
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,596
Well, Rui you.

574
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,766
You said that

575
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,038
I'm 25 years old instead of 52.

576
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,339
Stop it.

577
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,937
Well, you've gotten better.

578
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,776
American girl.

579
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,008
Omitted!

580
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,918
Well, well, you know,

581
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,785
I'm really happy, yeah.

582
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,652
You know,

583
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,953
that you grew up to be fine and modest.

584
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,357
And as for Shintaro.

585
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,589
He got all muscled up with weird medicine.

586
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,824
It's just normal protein!

587
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,364
Look at these...

588
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,525
Butt muscles!

589
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,661
Aren't they stiff?!

590
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:01,870
What can you say?

591
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:02,940
Stop. Stop.

592
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,168
Who would find that joke funny? Huh?

593
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,641
Well, well, but you know.

594
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,905
Even your late mother

595
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,139
I think would be happy in heaven.

596
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,347
Open the present.

597
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,107
Oh!

598
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:14,947
I wonder what it is?

599
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,351
What is it? Huh?

600
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:18,644
Oh.

601
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,146
Oooooh!

602
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,158
Pen pineapple!

603
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,227
Oh!

604
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,228
Because you want to do a party next!

605
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,890
Well, it's really popular these days!

606
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:28,727
Oh!

607
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:29,595
Look.

608
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,010
~ I have a pen. ~

609
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,483
~ I have pineapple ~

610
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,144
It's the real thing!

611
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,523
~ Un! Pineapple pen! ~ 

612
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,786
He pierced it! He pierced it!

613
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,521
~ I have a pen. ~

614
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,359
~ I have coconut. ~

615
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,727
~ Un! ~

616
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,427
It's too hard that it doesn't pierce!

617
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,399
It's too hard that it doesn't pierce!

618
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,766
What a development!

619
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,861
What a development!

620
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,997
But! But!

621
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,133
But there's a hole so...

622
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,107
I can pierce it!

623
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,912
~ Pineapple pen ~

624
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,209
~ Coconut pen ~

625
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,317
~ Un! ~ 

626
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,579
~ Pen pineapple coconut pen ~

627
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,281
The real thing and the real thing...

628
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,388
Wow...

629
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,256
I laughed a whole lot.

630
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,953
You can sleep tight now then.

631
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:32,757
Good night.

632
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:33,558
Good night.

633
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,257
Good night.

634
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,369
You know,

635
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,306
you have watched that around 300 times already.

636
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,437
That piercing the real things Hawaii version.

637
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,312
How can you still laugh like that every time?

638
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,816
But it's really funny.

639
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,409
Like the coconut is hard and can't be pierced.

640
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,546
Well, well, I can't pierce it every time.

641
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,354
The hell is that?

642
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,486
Well, I wonder if those weird medicines are doing that to you.

643
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,155
Ah, I remember now.

644
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,182
Okay.

645
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,852
That'll make tomorrow the same day.

646
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,021
The same news... 

647
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,782
She said they repeat everything from that day.

648
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,451
Then, when will she get better?

649
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,020
The doctor said she might never be cured.

650
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,257
Then that means, you and her are perfect for each other.

651
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,625
Why?

652
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,762
You can do whatever you like and there won't be any future problems.

653
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,364
Because she'll forget?

654
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,433
I see.

655
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,234
But there's one problem.

656
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,269
What?

657
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,771
It's too cruel.

658
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,406
The way she'll forget?

659
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,241
Because that's for each day.

660
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,344
But...

661
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,080
But even if you do whatever you do and please,

662
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,915
 she won't get hurt.

663
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,884
What's with you? She has some kind of illness, you know.

664
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,633
But it's good for you.

665
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,053
I'm wondering if you should throw away your principle.

666
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,585
Forget it. It's none of your business.

667
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,659
But you know,

668
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,753
this is like a blessing in disguise.

669
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:23,265
Because if it's not Hawaii, you'll be found out quickly.

670
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:29,100
If it's Japan where there are four seasons, spring, summer, autumn, winter, and be hot and cold,

671
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,641
it's really impossible to repeat exactly the same day.

672
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,735
Stop blabbling and help me. Geez.

673
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,747
An old man who runs an eatery can never fix something like that.

674
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,340
Even the way you make food is shitty anyway.

675
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,351
You bastard! The reason you can go do observations 

676
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,478
at this observatory is because I have an eatery here

677
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,851
and you can do lots of other things!

678
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:46,855
Don't do that!

679
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,585
Don't "Yeah, yeah, yeah" me.

680
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,092
Don't imitate me! Don't imitate me!

681
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,526
I'm not doing that elongating my chin like that!

682
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,029
Hey! Say "I'm sorry".

683
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,895
Say, "I'm sorry".

684
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,566
I'm sorry.

685
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,938
Yeah. Good.

686
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,971
But every night and night,

687
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,637
what's fun with gazing at the same starry sky.

688
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,805
Well, I might have discovered something really stellar.

689
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,712
There might be a sign that I discovered something this stellar.

690
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,684
If I get this paper published in an American Astronomical Society's journal...

691
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,448
I know, I know, I know, I know!

692
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,453
That's Gotham, Gotham.

693
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,790
Gotham is Batman.

694
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,654
Goddard.

695
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,317
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

696
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,658
Then, would you like to drink to that?

697
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,562
I don't get why I have to. 

698
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,134
Look at what I'm doing.

699
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,429
I can't drink.

700
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:33,998
What?

701
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:38,007
To think I prepared the best Japanese style drinking food.

702
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,806
Well, I'm done anyway.

703
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,280
Would you drink?

704
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,352
Only a sip.

705
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,118
How is it?

706
00:34:59,576 --> 00:35:00,619
What are you doing here?

707
00:35:00,994 --> 00:35:01,829
I came to see Rui.

708
00:35:03,497 --> 00:35:05,124
I'm not gonna do anything wrong.

709
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:06,416
What did Sue say?

710
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:10,379
If I get near Rui, I will shark bait.

711
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:13,966
That's right. I mean, Rui doesn't like you anyway.

712
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:15,008
Why not?

713
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,595
This ain't a bar. No one flirts to girls doing breakfast.

714
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,680
No one but me.

715
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:20,639
What?

716
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,850
Bet you 20 bucks I can do it.

717
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:27,060
You're on.

718
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,771
Right.

719
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:34,778
Rui.

720
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:37,656
Nice apron.

721
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:39,950
Oh, mahalo.

722
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:41,785
I'll see you in a bit.

723
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:44,913
Aloha.

724
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:49,543
I talked to Nick. Trust me.

725
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:53,338
Don't worry.

726
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,587
You'll use this.

727
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,560
Look.

728
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,728
Doesn't it make a door?

729
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,669
Waffleman can go out.

730
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,297
What nationality are you?

731
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,205
To think you'll touch other people's food.

732
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,210
I'm Japanese.

733
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,937
Ah, so you'll eat this? You'll eat this actually?

734
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,072
Pardon me.

735
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,810
I apologize, sorry.

736
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,010
E-enjoy.

737
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:40,010
That was pathetic.

738
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,095
I'll bury you in the beach.

739
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:44,973
I'll get revenge tomorrow.

740
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,116
Can I have a moment?

741
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,386
I can see you're someone who can understand drawings.

742
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,522
I'm wondering if you can give me an opinion.

743
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,625
This is a drawing I made.

744
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,727
Gods of the Greek mythology.

745
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,062
They become constellations...

746
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:11,917
( Chinese ) Why

747
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,293
( Chinese ) did you come to Hawaii?

748
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:16,922
( Chinese )  Please don't just talk to me.

749
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,500
So you're not Japanese?

750
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,214
P-pardon me.

751
00:37:35,023 --> 00:37:36,275
She says she's Chinese.

752
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:38,610
Doesn't look it.

753
00:37:43,156 --> 00:37:44,658
40 dollars!

754
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:51,240
Can I have that? I need something to wipe my ass with.

755
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:53,500
Shut the f-

756
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:58,505
Shut up.

757
00:38:03,468 --> 00:38:05,262
What's wrong with him?

758
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:08,557
Looks like a stupid asshole to me.

759
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:18,758
Hey.

760
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:21,858
I'm sorry.

761
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,955
No, it's alright.

762
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,768
Are you alright?

763
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,602
I have a problem.

764
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,868
What's wrong?

765
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,470
I...

766
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,543
...cannot read them.

767
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:38,920
Seriously?

768
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,947
You can't read English?

769
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,645
That's right.

770
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,681
I can't right after I graduated elementary.

771
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,520
Because I ran away from home.

772
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,093
I'll read them for you.

773
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:50,990
No!

774
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,995
I'll read them myself!

775
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,655
I don't need your sympathy...

776
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,228
My order is...

777
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,494
This...

778
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,400
That's written normally in Japan, right?

779
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,000
Really?

780
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,107
But I can't read the alphabet when I was in Japan.

781
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,310
Because I've always avoided　English...

782
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,847
Don't cry.

783
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,445
Everybody makes mistakes.

784
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,924
I should've studied more!

785
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:24,883
He's on a roll today!

786
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,991
Why don't you seat with me?

787
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,264
I'll teach you how to read while having breakfast.

788
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,332
Really?

789
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,568
Come here.

790
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,332
You're a lifesaver.

791
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,616
Even though I look like this, I'm a teacher.

792
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,119
Well, that was fun.

793
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,320
Me too.

794
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,721
You have my thanks.

795
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,293
Here you go.

796
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,395
Thank you.

797
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,064
Whoopsie.

798
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,140
Goodbye then.

799
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,465
That's it?

800
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,440
Huh? What do you mean?

801
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,513
You won't ask my number even though you made such a meaningful foolish lie?

802
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,512
It's the truth.

803
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,377
Stop.

804
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,347
It's the first time I saw such foolish act.

805
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,817
I thought you really wanted to go out with me.

806
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,683
I really thought you're an idiot.

807
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:26,987
Um, no. Let me explain.

808
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,581
I was happy even for just a second.

809
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:29,659
Sorry, that was not my intention.

810
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,954
Don't worry about it.

811
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,926
Got it. Then I'll tell the truth.

812
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,290
I can read them.

813
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,664
I told you, I knew.

814
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,964
Geez, what is it then?!

815
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:51,052
No more funny games!

816
00:40:58,685 --> 00:41:00,562
Kento? It's Sue.

817
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:16,907
Aloha.

818
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,509
I am Daisuke Yuge.

819
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,510
I know.

820
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,648
I want to apologize to your daughter.

821
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,309
I won't let you.

822
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,818
Our conversation is over.

823
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,854
Dad! Dad!

824
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,482
The mangoose in the garage!

825
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:39,885
So it's him.

826
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,129
You're so cool!

827
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,825
I have one request.

828
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,357
Stay away from my daughter.

829
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,699
Well, I don't like to end things that way.

830
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:48,703
Then how about this?!

831
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,005
I'm gonna... gonna...

832
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,634
I give! I give! I give! I give!

833
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:55,905
I give!

834
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,073
I will protect my sister.

835
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,446
You damn outrageous bastard!

836
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,712
I know, I know.

837
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,481
If you do, go out with me!

838
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,316
Huh? What? What?

839
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:06,514
What? What?

840
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,318
Of course it's a joke!

841
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,588
Um, can you face around here?

842
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,323
Can you put your head here? Your head here?

843
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,227
Your head around here?

844
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,495
My daughter can't have normal dating life.

845
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,506
The next morning, she'll forget everything that happened the last day.

846
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,040
I can't let anybody use it to their advantage.

847
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,973
No, no. I don't intend to have that kind of relationship...

848
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,341
That'll be that kind of relationship to my sister. 

849
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,614
For now, stop coming to the usual cafe.

850
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,244
It should be

851
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,684
exactly the same day every day.

852
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,916
If not, my daughter

853
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,492
will realize it's strange every morning.

854
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,588
Then she'll cry every day.

855
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,595
I can't bear to see my daughter suffer

856
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,365
like that.

857
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,741
Understood.

858
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,917
Even though I beat him up, I slipped.

859
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,576
Just what are you training for?

860
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:10,654
He's a bit...

861
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,187
so cool!

862
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,189
Huh? Are you serious? Hey, are you serious?

863
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,224
I'm kidding.

864
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,765
What's with you?!

865
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,706
You've been having such a long face since morning.

866
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,538
Nothing...

867
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:35,708
Oh!

868
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,213
It's quite rare that you're here already this early.

869
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,077
Hey.

870
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,448
It's about time you meet up the guest at the hotel.

871
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,767
What kind of guest is today?

872
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,021
Female university students.

873
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,055
Three of them.

874
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,589
Okay...

875
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:49,556
What? What? What?

876
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,094
That's strange. You'll usually

877
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,993
go out with a big smile on your face!

878
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,360
- Um, Boss.
- Hm?

879
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,894
Um...

880
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,164
What will you do if the parent of the girl you like opposes you to date her?

881
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:04,968
I'll clobber the parent.

882
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:05,837
No, you can't.

883
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:06,705
I'll kidnap her.

884
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,868
That's also a crime.

885
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,706
I see.

886
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,540
I see...

887
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,636
No!

888
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,340
Hurry and go to work!

889
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,677
Well, anyway,

890
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,184
there's no need to listen to her parent.

891
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,344
I see.

892
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,084
He's in love.

893
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,418
It's probably the girl he said last time.

894
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,254
And now

895
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,225
it's concluded that

896
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,626
it's not me!

897
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:27,924
Huh?

898
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,693
You still wished it was you?

899
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,105
Is this your last day?

900
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,617
I just don't have to go to the cafe, right?

901
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,428
My car stopped working.

902
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,430
What's the cause?

903
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,464
Battery.

904
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,966
Ah, you're a lifesaver.

905
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,235
Few cars pass here.

906
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,996
Yeah, none at all. I've waited for 30 minutes and you're the first...

907
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,074
Why did you believe me?

908
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,198
This is how my grandpa died of electrocution...

909
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,183
I'm sorry.

910
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,191
I was only joking.

911
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,426
Why did you believe me?

912
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,633
You got me!

913
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:42,997
I'm Daisuke.

914
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,335
Rui.

915
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,669
Nice to meet you.

916
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,641
Did you know Jurassic Park did filming here? 

917
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,905
- I know.
- Ah, you knew.

918
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,105
I love Jurassic Park.

919
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,296
Even though she said she loved it.

920
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,006
I'm very sure she would ask

921
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,741
how I ended up this way.

922
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,914
Help!

923
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,350
I'm tied up!

924
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,257
God has kept me alive.

925
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,193
He'll fulfill this love.

926
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,543
It's her. Okay!

927
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,844
Hit me. Hit me.

928
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:55,979
Realistically! Realistically!

929
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,415
 Give me back my wallet, bastard!

930
00:46:58,515 --> 00:46:59,516
My wallet!

931
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:00,384
Just because you're handsome... 

932
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,418
Help!

933
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:02,553
Bastard!

934
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,321
- Help!
- Bastard!

935
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:06,023
Bastard! How dare you lay a hand on your customer's girl?!

936
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,391
Bastard! Bastard!

937
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,426
You shitty hottie! Bastard!

938
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:10,959
Stop hitting him!

939
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:12,858
Ow! Ow! Ow!

940
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,143
If you keep hitting him,

941
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,357
he'll die, you know!

942
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,397
He'll die! He'll die!

943
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,091
He'll die! He'll die!

944
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,099
He'll die!

945
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,033
Stop, stop. I'm alright now.

946
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,538
Are you alright? I'll be right back.

947
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,369
Stop it! It's alright already!

948
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:26,908
Stop!

949
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:28,772
Ow!

950
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,340
Ah! That hurt!

951
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,540
Ow...

952
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,273
Ow!

953
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,416
What's your name?

954
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,016
Daisuke.

955
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,584
You're strong.

956
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,185
I'm a member of the vigilante group.

957
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:47,092
I see.

958
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,289
Pink girl!

959
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,831
Are you crazy, you bitch!

960
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,025
You want some more, you bastard?!

961
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,624
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

962
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:54,135
There, he's off. He's off.

963
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,199
Take care.

964
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,241
I wonder if he's okay.

965
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:08,576
Oh no.

966
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,714
After you help your idiot friend, go to our place.

967
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,147
Okay.

968
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,239
There's something I want to show you.

969
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,573
~ One more chance ~

970
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:44,211
~ tripped by memories ~

971
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,687
~ One more chance ~

972
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:51,250
~ we cannot choose our next place ~

973
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,760
~ I am always ~

974
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,792
~ I am always searching somewhere for you ~

975
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:58,333
She only sings that during the days she meets you.

976
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,099
That song?

977
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:02,364
That's Mom and Dad's song.

978
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,336
Even though I return to Japan often because of work,

979
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:08,036
every time, she always let me bring the disc of that song.

980
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:12,275
It seems like it makes it a reminder for her and my wife that I return soon.

981
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,015
I see.

982
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,778
But I can't imagine you having a lover in Japan.

983
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,015
True.

984
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,979
My face is this big.

985
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,354
Even my foot size is 31 centimeters.

986
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,687
Even though I went to Hawaii to find a big shoe size...

987
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,853
Jerk.

988
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,995
Big stupid idiot.

989
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,030
That's not it.

990
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,168
You're funny!

991
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,635
Can you give me a minute?

992
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,106
Give me a minute.

993
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,706
Just what do you want to gain to get involved with my daughter?

994
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,614
I wonder.

995
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,987
You would probably want to hear the beautiful song every day.

996
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,926
I'm saying it's not good.

997
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,154
Her singing is just so bad!

998
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,287
You are always off the point.

999
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,024
Please think of her future.

1000
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,561
Every morning, when she looks at the mirror, her face is growing older.

1001
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,828
I also

1002
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,542
get worried about that every day.

1003
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,381
Are you alone?

1004
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,449
If you put a jacuzzi in this beautiful waffle house,

1005
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,218
I think it would be more beautiful.

1006
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,387
I'm flattered but I already have a boyfriend.

1007
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:24,321
I'm sorry.

1008
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,189
You just lied for you to reject me.

1009
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,124
No, it's true.

1010
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:27,891
Then what's his name?

1011
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:28,692
Micheal.

1012
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:29,417
His last name is Jackson?

1013
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,049
It's Moore.

1014
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,252
Ah, him?!

1015
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,591
Oh no! Police is here!

1016
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,099
Wait.

1017
00:50:39,015 --> 00:50:40,391
Wait! Wait!

1018
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,560
The tax ain't expired!

1019
00:50:42,935 --> 00:50:44,020
It expired in May.

1020
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:45,980
No! May of next year!

1021
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,858
Ah, I think there's a misunderstanding.

1022
00:50:49,484 --> 00:50:50,777
What's a misunderstanding?

1023
00:50:50,943 --> 00:50:52,612
It's still October!

1024
00:50:55,198 --> 00:50:56,074
Can I borrow this?

1025
00:50:58,034 --> 00:50:58,701
Look!

1026
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:00,995
October!

1027
00:51:03,623 --> 00:51:04,499
Let's go inside.

1028
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,692
No way...

1029
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:12,693
How come...

1030
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,469
So she found out...

1031
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,801
Rui.

1032
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:54,838
These are the records of the accident.

1033
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:17,627
Here are the charts.

1034
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,837
No way...

1035
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,815
There really is a wound.

1036
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,519
You were at the hospital for three months.

1037
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,289
I want to see the doctor.

1038
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,291
I want to hear what he'll say.

1039
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,727
You've heard you countless times.

1040
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,629
I did?

1041
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,965
I also want to go. I want to also hear what he'll say.

1042
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,234
Shintaro, hold them.

1043
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,868
I can't look at them anymore.

1044
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,207
It's alright, Rui.

1045
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,010
Stop it, you're an outsider.

1046
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:16,945
He's your boyfriend.

1047
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,355
Huh?!

1048
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,785
You have that expression that I'm exactly not your type.

1049
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,152
What else happened?

1050
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:28,928
What about my class?

1051
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,727
There was someone who replaced you.

1052
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,364
Did anything happened between us already?

1053
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:39,739
No, we haven't, I mean, we did...

1054
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,437
- What do you mean haven't?!
- No, I don't mean it like that.

1055
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,376
We haven't... haven't done anything yet.

1056
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,577
And ah, I finally made a report to you.

1057
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,244
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1058
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,214
But I really want to.

1059
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,483
Hey, I mean...

1060
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:55,922
Just kidding.

1061
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,288
I'm actually not kidding.

1062
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,861
- What do you mean?!
- Um...

1063
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:00,889
Hottie.

1064
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,364
On the contrary, wanna do it with me?

1065
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,729
What do you mean on the contrary?

1066
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:06,699
Idiot.

1067
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:10,968
So you should've lied everyday.

1068
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:23,817
Hi.

1069
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,945
Hey! Aloha.

1070
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,546
- Hi!
- Yo!

1071
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:31,840
Hey! Rui!

1072
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:34,060
Good to see you again.

1073
00:55:42,193 --> 00:55:43,235
What's her problem?

1074
00:55:43,527 --> 00:55:45,571
She doesn't remember who you are?

1075
00:55:45,988 --> 00:55:48,074
Oh. Yeah.

1076
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,640
This is the image of your brain.

1077
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:56,182
I can't see any improvement.

1078
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,784
There's a terrible damage in your temporal lobe.

1079
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:04,223
From sleeping, you'll go from short-term memory goes to long-term memory.

1080
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,090
And they cannot be converted.

1081
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,791
"Goldfierd Syndrome".

1082
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,594
Who's name is it?

1083
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,896
An excellent psychiatrist.

1084
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:17,335
He also had the same ailment.

1085
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,403
It took 

1086
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,943
4 years to be announced.

1087
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,406
He had to redo it every day.

1088
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,351
You properly understand humor.

1089
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,953
It is here.

1090
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,050
The one that controls emotions.

1091
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,392
Just that...

1092
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,627
Your condition will not change.

1093
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,000
Probably forever.

1094
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,532
I'm sorry.

1095
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,704
But

1096
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,404
it's better.

1097
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,142
Better?

1098
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,017
How about meeting

1099
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:06,511
"10 second Tom"?

1100
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:13,553
This is the leading brain injury clinic. 

1101
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,861
The sponsor is a rich man from Ohia.

1102
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,992
He's the king of automobile parts who's a philanthropist.

1103
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,601
Okay, let me introduce him to you.

1104
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:27,039
The most severe patient,

1105
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:29,705
Tom.

1106
00:57:29,956 --> 00:57:31,010
Hi! I'm Tom.

1107
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:31,806
I'm Kenta.

1108
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,207
Hi! I'm Tom.

1109
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:34,112
I'm Rui.

1110
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,149
Hi! I'm Tom.

1111
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:35,979
Daisuke.

1112
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:37,211
Oh, hi! I'm Tom.

1113
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,116
Shintaro

1114
00:57:38,267 --> 00:57:39,143
Cool shoes!

1115
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:41,440
Oh yeah? You like these? I'm...

1116
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:41,604
Hi! I'm Tom.
Oh yeah? You like these? I'm...

1117
00:57:41,604 --> 00:57:43,150
Hi! I'm Tom.

1118
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:45,456
Oh hi! I'm Tom.

1119
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:47,330
Oh hi! I'm Tom.

1120
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,987
From a hunting accident,

1121
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:53,032
his memory only lasts 10 seconds.

1122
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,572
I was in an accident?

1123
00:57:55,701 --> 00:57:58,787
You'll get over it in 3 seconds.

1124
00:57:59,622 --> 00:58:00,706
Get over it?

1125
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:03,876
Was I shot in the brain?

1126
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,418
Hi! I'm Tom.

1127
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:09,252
Kenta.

1128
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:10,453
Hi! I'm Tom.

1129
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:11,254
Rui...

1130
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,878
I'm going to sleep.

1131
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,212
Good night.

1132
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,181
I'll see you tomorrow.

1133
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,653
I'll probably...

1134
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:45,855
...forget about you...

1135
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,390
Yeah.

1136
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,661
It was a hard day. Sleep well.

1137
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:04,240
Good night.

1138
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:07,477
Hey,

1139
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:10,847
thank you for today.

1140
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,285
Don't mess up tomorrow.

1141
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,820
Talk about lilies when you're going to talk to me.

1142
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,922
Lilies?

1143
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,657
That's my favorite flowers.

1144
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,192
Thank you for the advice.

1145
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,794
Bye.

1146
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:26,796
Good night.

1147
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,173
She's fallen for you.

1148
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,841
Huh?

1149
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,678
Let's go get some drinks.

1150
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,916
It seems you're observing celestial bodies.

1151
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:54,990
I came to Hawaii to do astronomy.

1152
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,491
What? Really?

1153
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,954
You can also do in Japan, right?

1154
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,061
Well,

1155
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,423
whatever research team I joined,

1156
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:05,057
I wasn't able to see the stars I only want to look upon.

1157
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:06,100
Well...

1158
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,931
I always wanted to watch the stars.

1159
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,535
I just didn't want to just seat on a desk and meddle with data.

1160
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,802
Well, Hawaii has the best

1161
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,172
starry skies.

1162
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,540
That's it.

1163
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,039
Until when?

1164
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,680
There's the Goddard Space Flight Center near Washington DC.

1165
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,517
I guess until my published paper will be caught attention by the research team there.

1166
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,457
When you talk about something so difficult...

1167
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,356
makes you look so cool.

1168
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,155
Shut up.

1169
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,888
But if that happens,

1170
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,329
you'll bid farewell to this troublesome life.

1171
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,130
Um...

1172
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:45,271
Is there something we can do to this troublesome life?

1173
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:46,936
What do you mean?

1174
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,235
She's not only shocked in the accident.

1175
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:51,836
It's because of the strange arrangements.

1176
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:52,880
That's why she's upset.

1177
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,174
Are you a professional?

1178
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,182
No, I'm not.

1179
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,515
Showing the pictures of the accident whenever 

1180
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,021
she founds out will surely shock her.

1181
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,456
I'm going to break your head.

1182
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:07,096
You will?

1183
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,262
No.

1184
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:09,262
Dad will.

1185
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,830
Will you let me come up with something?

1186
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:19,365
Hey.

1187
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,067
Hold it, hottie!

1188
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,166
Leave him be.

1189
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:23,842
Give me one of your chest hair!

1190
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,504
Hm? What now? What did you just say?

1191
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:26,309
Hm? What?

1192
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,110
Chest hair.

1193
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:28,240
You want a chest hair?

1194
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,683
- I can't help it.
- His chest hair?

1195
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,118
Ah, it's alright if it's just armpit hair!

1196
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,121
Hm, armpit hair? That's... Huh?

1197
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,494
Excuse me.

1198
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:48,270
Rui?

1199
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,201
Yes.

1200
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:50,738
A delivery.

1201
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:52,305
For me?

1202
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:53,731
Yes.

1203
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,072
How lovely.

1204
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,442
These are my favorite.

1205
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,276
From whom are they?

1206
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,975
I can't say. He's from a secret admirer.

1207
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:03,779
Together with this.

1208
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,486
Is he your friend?

1209
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:12,791
I just met him.

1210
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:14,960
Look. He said it's from a secret admirer.

1211
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,361
I see.

1212
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:17,262
What's that?

1213
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,625
I guess a DVD?

1214
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,760
Yes.

1215
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,063
I wonder what kind of DVD.

1216
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:24,264
I wonder.

1217
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,305
I have to watch it.

1218
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,272
Happy birthday.

1219
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:27,467

What're you planning?

1223
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,420

around a year after your accident.

1236
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:56,632
Let me re-enact what we usually do.

1237
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,637
Why do I have to do this?

1238

If you put a toothpick here,

1252
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:35,705
it can become a door.

1253
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:37,173

01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,800
So it has been an hour since she's crying.

1288
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,058
It's not bad. Let's do this everyday.

1289
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,069
It depends on her.

1290
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,227
Yeah.

1291
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,416
What happened to the calf?

1292
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,649
You'll ask that?!

1293
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,483
It's alright. We didn't hit it.

1294
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:13,657
It's still alive now.

1295
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,292
Thank goodness.

1296
01:07:23,393 --> 01:07:26,772
[ Watch the DVD ]

1297
01:07:38,742 --> 01:07:42,204
[ Watch the DVD ]

1298
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:51,922
[ Good morning, Rui ]

1299
01:07:52,756 --> 01:07:55,717
[ Don't worry and watch ]

1300
01:07:56,468 --> 01:07:59,513
[ Here are events you didn't know ]

1301
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:13,756
It's beautiful.

1302
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,893
Hawaii is really beautiful.

1303
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:25,067
Haven't you thought of wanting to go back to Japan?

1304
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,905
Hmm... No.

1305
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,976
Especially when I met you.

1306
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,815
Starting today, every morning,

1307
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,852
I wonder if I would fall in love with you.

1308
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,155
I wonder.

1309
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:50,493
There are no Japanese tourists who doesn't fall in love me though.

1310
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,698
If only we've met before the accident...

1311
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:01,103
No.

1312
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,872
If you don't forget about me everyday,

1313
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,174
you'll probably find out that I'm such a boring guy.

1314
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,243
Ah, that's alright. I'll find that out quick.

1315
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,645
Are you serious?

1316
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,374
I'm the most popular tour guide in Hawaii, you know.

1317
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,452
You're now monopolizing the most popular guy you know.

1318
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,387
And you're making Hawaii have a huge economic blow.

1319
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:21,157
Everyone wanted to see me that 

1320
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,092
they all come to Hawaii, you know.

1321
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,027
Of course this scenery is a given, but...

1322
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,734
Tell me about yourself.

1323
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,006
I've won in the chicken wings eating contest 7 times.

1324
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,574
Really?

1325
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,077
Yesterday,

1326
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,245
it has been decided that 

1327
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:46,115
my paper will be published in the American Astronomical Society Journal.

1328
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:50,319
There's a star that's like a sun that's far away from this galaxy.

1329
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:53,088
I found a planet surrounding it.

1330
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,657
So depending on future research,

1331
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:58,627
it would be a discovery that would astonish the world

1332
01:09:58,727 --> 01:09:59,662
most probably.

1333
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:01,964
But it's really amazing.

1334
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,234
It just means that I might have discovered a planet like Earth that

1335
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,402
there are living things.

1336
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,038
With this discovery,

1337
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:12,041
if I got admitted to the Goddard Space Flight Center in the mainland,

1338
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,944
People might be able to see the planet where everyone hasn't

1339
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,111
able to see yet so far.

1340
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:19,415
That is my dream.

1341
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:22,751
What I just said is true.

1342
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,588
The chicken wings was a lie?

1343
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,893
Ah, that's what my tour guide boss achievement.

1344
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,696
That's a wonderful dream.

1345
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:41,737
What's your next question?

1346
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:47,042
Do you love me?

1347
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:50,346
Ah...

1348
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:53,782
I'm not forcing you. I'm just asking you for future information.

1349
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:55,884
For the latest video version.

1350
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,489
Alright, let's see.

1351
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,597
I watch you every morning as you go to the cafe, reading.

1352
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:09,898
Then...

1353
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:12,768
every morning,

1354
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:16,772
I realize that I love you from the bottom of my heart.

1355
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,974
Wow.

1356
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:22,811
What do I say?

1357
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:24,046
Hmm, every time,

1358
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:25,948
you always get excited when we talk about the chicken wings contest.

1359
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,186
That and

1360
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:33,255
you look like 

1361
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,359
you always feel you really 

1362
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:38,727
like me. 

1363
01:11:58,414 --> 01:11:59,281
What do you think?

1364
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,921
First kiss is the best.

1365
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:22,871
First kiss is the best.

1366
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,080
First kiss is the best!

1367
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:37,486
I'm tired...

1368
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,792
Injecting to get you better...

1369
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:52,634
First kiss is the best.

1370
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,503
You've said that before.

1371
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,441
I've become better!

1372
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,816
First kiss is the best.

1373
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,689
So first kiss is the best, huh?

1374
01:13:30,468 --> 01:13:31,052
Are you okay?

1375
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:34,531
I'll faint.

1376
01:13:35,807 --> 01:13:36,474
Hang in there!

1377
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:43,716
Wanna have a look?

1378
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:44,410
Yeah.

1379
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,385
Ah! What're you doing?!

1380
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:47,978
Well, I was just taking your hand.

1381
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,284
Were you about to touch my breasts?!

1382
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:50,585
No, I didn't!

1383
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:51,750
Ah...

1384
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,187
But...

1385
01:13:56,365 --> 01:14:00,062
We've already kissed 23 times already.

1386
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:02,604
I guess it's alright

1387
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:07,038
that I get to touch your breasts by now, right?

1388
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:10,072
I understand.

1389
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,082
No...

1390
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,378
There's no way I would understand it.

1391
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:19,749
It's the first time for me every time after all.

1392
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,613
Then, let's get the average.

1393
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,715
It's my 23rd time. For you, it's the first time.

1394
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,385
The average would be 12 times.

1395
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,153
Yes.

1396
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:31,198
According to the regulations in state of Hawaii,

1397
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,928
the qualifications for touching the breasts during the 12th time is...

1398
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:34,832
okay.

1399
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,734
If only we've met before the accident...

1400
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,002
You always say that.

1401
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:42,273
Okay, then.

1402
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:44,777
Lemme guide you my very best place tonight.

1403
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:53,615
Hawaii's starry sky sure is this beautiful.

1404
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,287
Astronomers from 

1405
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:59,622
all over the world comes to Hawaii to observe this.

1406
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,597
There's no way I would get tired for just 

1407
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:06,065
five minutes with this beautiful starry sky.

1408
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,403
I can watch until dawn.

1409
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,734
Really.

1410
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:17,579
Um...

1411
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:19,681
Over there.

1412
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:20,782
That goes like that.

1413
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:24,786
That one that goes like that

1414
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,154
is the constellation, Perseus.

1415
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:26,855
I see.

1416
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:27,923
The Perseus constellation.

1417
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,926
The one over there that's...

1418
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,961
That's straight there.

1419
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:34,196
Even though there's a hand that straightens it.

1420
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:35,030
Hand?

1421
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,999
Yeah, though there's none...

1422
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:38,166
That's the Virgo constellation.

1423
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,368
That's Virgo.

1424
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,836
Then, the Cassiopeia constellation is there...

1425
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,871
That...

1426
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:46,542
That dash, dash, dash there is the Cassiopeia constellation.

1427
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:49,111
Even though you won't see the lines, it'll become one.

1428
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,579
That's Cassiopeia constellation.

1429
01:15:57,152 --> 01:16:01,056
I have a question about the god of Greek mythology.

1430
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,759
I wonder if

1431
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:06,962
he would seduce me

1432
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:11,233
under this sky full of stars?

1433
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,270
I will seduce you~

1434
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,774
I will seduce you right away~

1435
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:20,442
The god spoke.

1436
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,877
In Japanese too.

1437
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:23,912
That's because you can't understand Greek.

1438
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,314
Then you should stop him.

1439
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,916
Hey!

1440
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,320
Ah! Um...

1441
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:33,755
A bear will appear here.

1442
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,023
Huh?

1443
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:36,158
There's a bear in Hawaii?

1444
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,093
There are Hawaiian bears!

1445
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:39,161
But it's alright since

1446
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,363
even if they'll appear, I'll protect you.

1447
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,965
At the time when 

1448
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,500
I will protect your whole body with everything I got...

1449
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:48,370
Right.

1450
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:50,739
Your whole body.

1451
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,240
Is my love... um...

1452
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,443
Is my love, um, you know, my love...

1453
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:56,478
If you will... permit me...

1454
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:57,846
 That definitely won't be happening.

1455
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,215
Well, if a bear really comes, we have to play dead.

1456
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,150
Yeah, that's true but...

1457
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,518
Ah, I know!

1458
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,588
If there's a shooting star that passes through within a minute...

1459
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:07,889
Ah, that sounds good. 

1460
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,392
Um, I can pull one myself.

1461
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:12,050
Okay, ready, set, go!

1462
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:26,636
Okay, 10 more seconds.

1463
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:29,902
Okay.

1464
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:31,536
5 more seconds.

1465
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,112
4.

1466
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:34,572
3.

1467
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:35,817
2.

1468
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,331
Growl!

1469
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:51,800
Regarding that bear awhile ago...

1470
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,769
I was just kidding so don't worry about it.

1471
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,804
How harsh!

1472
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,740
Hey! Don't say such nice things!

1473
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,175
What the hell! Hey!

1474
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:02,577
Hey! Should I leave?

1475
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,246
What the hell?! Hey! I should leave?!

1476
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,714
I won't! What the hell?!

1477
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,082
Hey! I came all this way!

1478
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,216
What should I do?!

1479
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,886
What should I do?! Say something!

1480
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:20,662
The thing I wanted to show you the most

1481
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:25,000
is the starry sky when the night is over.

1482
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:28,570
I want to see it.

1483
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,074
That's why you mustn't sleep.

1484
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,443
I won't.

1485
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,580
That moment is the most beautiful.

1486
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:41,249
I'll surely watch.

1487
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,185
I definitely won't sleep.

1488
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:47,222
Rui.

1489
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:54,963
Will you marry me?

1490
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:01,903
Of course.

1491
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:07,442
Thank goodness.

1492
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:17,119
Definitely don't forget about me and the

1493
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,490
starry sky that will be over.

1494
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,828
I won't forget.

1495
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,146
Oh no, we went asleep.

1496
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:55,681
No! No! No! No!

1497
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,621
No! No! No!

1498
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:57,953
Um, you see, this is...

1499
01:19:58,059 --> 01:19:59,117
You know me! You know me!

1500
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,694
Um, you see, you know...

1501
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:01,820
Help!

1502
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,488
This is hard to understand, I know.

1503
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:05,498
It is difficult. Even though it's hard to understand,

1504
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,295
we are dating. We are dating.

1505
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:08,835
We are boyfriend and girlfriend!

1506
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,030
Um, I know everything about you. As proof,

1507
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,606
um, you are Rui Fujishima, right?

1508
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:14,072
Um, you are an art teacher.

1509
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,074
Um, well...

1510
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,337
Um...

1511
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:17,934
You go to the cafe during Sundays.

1512
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:20,708
Um, you make a waffle house.

1513
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,544
Um...

1514
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:22,742
You love lilies.

1515
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:23,943
You liar! Big pervert!

1516
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,417
I'm no pervert! I'm just a bit lively!

1517
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,851
- Aaah!
- Ah! Why don't you remember me?!

1518
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:33,659
Who would've thought that Sis would take revenge.

1519
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:35,086
Here.

1520
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,357
Thanks.

1521
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,642
She has calmed down.

1522
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,176
She's now watching the DVD.

1523
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:53,276
Well, my temporal lobe is in danger.

1524
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:57,181
You won't get short-term memory loss.

1525
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:59,913
You'll just get headaches from time to time.

1526
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:02,080
I'll be fine. I have 170 IQ anyway.

1527
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,923
You want to enter that research institute in 

1528
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,655
Washington after all.

1529
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:10,463
Since when were you preparing?

1530
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,768
Since 10 years ago.

1531
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,030
Have you told Sis?

1532
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:18,298
I did, but of course, she had forgotten.

1533
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,735
But

1534
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:23,470
if you're asked to join the research tem,

1535
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:25,678
you'll go, right?

1536
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,784
Yeah, I'm lost.

1537
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,787
Even though I can't leave her,

1538
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,422
if I go, I might not be able to come back to Hawaii.

1539
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:46,798
I'm worried.

1540
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:51,795
I don't want to ruin the progress so far if I don't see her for years.

1541
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:54,173
I also think

1542
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:57,609
she remembers me somewhere in her mind.

1543
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:03,013
I think she'll never realize it even if you go to the moon.

1544
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,553
Stay forever in Hawaii.

1545
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,148
Hm? Sorry, what do you mean by that?

1546
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:12,925
Ah, well...

1547
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:14,052
Are you serious?!

1548
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,834
Okay then, bye bye!

1549
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,136
Daisuke.

1550
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,077
Oh.

1551
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:34,739
How's your head?

1552
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,577
Yeah.

1553
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:37,845
It's totally fine.

1554
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,580
Thank goodness.

1555
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:44,148
It's rare that a princess would go downtown.

1556
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:46,056
I wanted to see you.

1557
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:48,652
What's that notebook?

1558
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:50,890
Ah, my dairy.

1559
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:52,398
I'm writing it every night.

1560
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,660
You hate the video?

1561
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,326
I love it.

1562
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,905
But watching it, sometimes...

1563
01:22:58,006 --> 01:22:59,735
I feel like listening.

1564
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:03,901
When I read the diary, I can actually feel about my own daily life...

1565
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:06,571
When did you start?

1566
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:09,077
Right after I got the DVD.

1567
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:10,543
Really?

1568
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,986
I was worried

1569
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:17,558
that I would meet an expert in love.

1570
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,183
Thinking you'll be disappointed when you meet him?

1571
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:20,124
No.

1572
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:23,162
What I was worried was

1573
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,558
when we are to break up.

1574
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:35,809
You had dreams and life before you met me.

1575
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:40,311
You'll just get your hands full just to persuade me.

1576
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:43,277
When was the last time you looked at the telescope?

1577
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,651
I don't want you

1578
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:50,381
to be like my Dad and my brother.

1579
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,360
You mean me being the one your diary's first page?

1580
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:54,485
No.

1581
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,157
I will completely erase it.

1582
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:58,857
Like you didn't even existed.

1583
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,229
Why would you do that?

1584
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:05,402
Because you won't have a future with me.

1585
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,542
You want to realize your dream right?

1586
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,543
You would even want to get married and have kids.

1587
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:12,010
No.

1588
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,211
We decided to get married yesterday.

1589
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:15,213
Let's make kids.

1590
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:17,181
We can never do that.

1591
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,378
Even if I look at my belly being big,

1592
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,614
I won't remember it.

1593
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:24,858
I'll make a diary where you're not in it.

1594
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,688
Before that, I want you to read it.

1595
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:32,795
I'll read it tomorrow.

1596
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,334
'Cause you'll forget that you've broken up with me.

1597
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:35,869
I won't forget.

1598
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,437
I've already written it.

1599
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:38,904
I've already decided.

1600
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:40,406
You can't change my mind.

1601
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:42,636
I'll be waiting at the house.

1602
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,120
This is about me.

1603
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:54,389
"Warning."

1604
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:57,826
"When he kisses you in the neck, you'll cry something strange."

1605
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,961
I wonder why I wrote something like this?

1606
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:04,165
I guess you'll cry something strange.

1607
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:18,480
Let's skip this.

1608
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:20,381
Huh? Why? I want to read it.

1609
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:22,016
Huh? You'll read it?

1610
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:38,933
It's over.

1611
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:43,605
Ah.

1612
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:45,840
Also

1613
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:51,713
I'll delete all the pictures saved in here.

1614
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,248
What?

1615
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:54,782
Okay?

1616
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:16,587
And all the memories about you are now erased.

1617
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:19,397
Good.

1618
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:25,667
Take care.

1619
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,934
Wait!

1620
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:40,619
Give me one last first kiss!

1621
01:30:41,803 --> 01:30:45,273
~ If I lose any more than this, ~

1622
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:48,709
~ will my heart be forgiven ~

1623
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,245
We wish your happiness and success.

1624
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,649
- Good luck, Daisuke.
- Thank you.

1625
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:58,619
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

1626
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:14,101
Wow! Congratulations!

1627
01:31:14,202 --> 01:31:15,636
That's the first time I heard of it this year.

1628
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:19,407
~ To show you there's nothing else I can do ~

1629
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:21,542
If you come to this point of the zoo,

1630
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,678
you'll be able to experience Africa.

1631
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:25,947
There's the elephant.

1632
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:28,049
It sure is big.

1633
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:51,405
Okay then.

1634
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,108
We'll now go back to our route.

1635
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:56,043
Let's go over there.

1636
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,727
You know,

1637
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:16,119
I decided to leave this island.

1638
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:20,163
Since it has been my dream since I was a kid.

1639
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:23,268
That's correct.

1640
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,599
If you go over there,

1641
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:27,902
There are cute girls with big tits as many as there are stars.

1642
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:30,768
Are you saying you know how many stars are there?

1643
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:31,537
Ah...

1644
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:34,672
There are already 2 trillion stars just observing the galaxy over here.

1645
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:36,773
And only in 10 years, it increased ten times.

1646
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,148
There are already 7056 celestial bodies that was discovered last year.

1647
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:41,187
There are 1284 that was confirmed to be planets among them.

1648
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:44,820
And only 984 of those planets

1649
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:47,394
only increased in the past year.

1650
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:48,655
We don't know how much it would increase more.

1651
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:50,287
Compared to that, there are only 7.6 billion on Earth.

1652
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:51,262
Ah! Please stop!

1653
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:53,959
Even half of it is women, there are only 3.6 billion of them.

1654
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:54,762
But! But!

1655
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:57,463
And there are only 30 thousand people who meet each other.

1656
01:32:57,572 --> 01:32:59,631
I can't hold it! I can't hold it! Stop it! Stop it!

1657
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,469
3000 people, 300 people, 30 people.

1658
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,009
Being said, out of the three people,

1659
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:05,237
she's only one of them, you know!

1660
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:08,239
Oh no... I'm sorry.

1661
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:11,149
I want to take her with me after all.

1662
01:33:13,187 --> 01:33:16,156
You can't with that condition of her.

1663
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,953
In the first place, she'll only get in the way of your research.

1664
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:22,262
That kind of character is dry, isn't it?

1665
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:26,531
It's not dry.

1666
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:30,004
 In order to publish that paper,

1667
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:32,540
you worked really hard.

1668
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,809
And I'm the only one who looked after you.

1669
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:40,848
Riding in the research on another guy in Japan,

1670
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:44,218
and throw away the research without care.

1671
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:50,057
Not knowing how you'll fall down, believing on your own research,

1672
01:33:50,524 --> 01:33:51,959
you came to Hawaii,

1673
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,762
and watch the stars.

1674
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:56,664
That is

1675
01:33:56,764 --> 01:33:58,099
how I would

1676
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:04,171
how I would say it.

1677
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:12,346
Everything you worked hard so far

1678
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:16,450
is totally worth it.

1679
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:23,724
Thank you.

1680
01:34:29,463 --> 01:34:32,700
She doesn't even remember you.

1681
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:37,505
She won't remember you even once from now on.

1682
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,909
Even though it's painful, that is...

1683
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:46,180
That is...

1684
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:48,315
I think

1685
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:51,819
that you're

1686
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:53,854
lucky.

1687
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:05,229
Lucky, huh?

1688
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,508
Thank you for seeing me off.

1689
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:16,110
Good luck.

1690
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:18,913
Good luck also for not going under when you lose me.

1691
01:35:19,013 --> 01:35:19,914
Will do.

1692
01:35:20,014 --> 01:35:22,316
I have a feeling we'll go under but we'll do our best.

1693
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:25,052
Daisuke.

1694
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:30,091
Hui! Ke'olu'olu Ki'ila'u e palule?

1695
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:32,026
Thanks. What does that mean?

1696
01:35:32,793 --> 01:35:34,428
 Bring me a t-shirt

1697
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:36,764
as a souvenir.

1698
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:38,999
Got it.

1699
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:43,738
Love you.

1700
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:46,707
By the way, make it L sized. Because I like to wear it loose.

1701
01:35:46,807 --> 01:35:48,242
Yeah, I know.

1702
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,188
Hey, hey.

1703
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:02,890
Goodbye, star prince.

1704
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:05,626
You won't go back to this island anymore, right?

1705
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:09,363
I wonder about that.

1706
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,234
Why did you come here?

1707
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,971
Well, more or less,

1708
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:19,039
to give you encouragement.

1709
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:21,876
These are from Sue and Nick.

1710
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:23,911
 Have a safe trip they said.

1711
01:36:24,078 --> 01:36:25,780
Oh, it's heavy.

1712
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,815
Ah, this makes me happy.

1713
01:36:27,915 --> 01:36:29,183
Spam and peanut butter.

1714
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,185
They're my favorites.

1715
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:32,419
Give it to me.

1716
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,754
Well, I don't mind.

1717
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:36,547
Hey, sorry. Are you stupid?

1718
01:36:36,657 --> 01:36:38,147
These are gifts!

1719
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:39,920
Well, I don't mind.

1720
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:41,255
Thanks.

1721
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:43,455
I'll think of them as you and stare them while eating.

1722
01:36:43,564 --> 01:36:44,656
That's disgusting.

1723
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:46,858
If you're not going to eat them, give them to him.

1724
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:49,530
And then?

1725
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:52,603
How is she?

1726
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:57,375
She's now living in the hospital.

1727
01:36:58,712 --> 01:36:59,804
Since when?

1728
01:37:00,347 --> 01:37:01,541
Three weeks ago.

1729
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:03,847
She said she doesn't want to be a burden.

1730
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:05,509
I wasn't able to persuade her.

1731
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:11,723
Yeah.

1732
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:13,385
But

1733
01:37:13,794 --> 01:37:14,886
she looks like she's doing her best.

1734
01:37:15,563 --> 01:37:18,191
She's teaching patients how to draw and paint.

1735
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:21,564
It seems like she's also singing.

1736
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:29,401
Thank you...

1737
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:35,708
for taking her to the hospital.

1738
01:37:37,618 --> 01:37:38,880
Well, there's that.

1739
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:41,480
Take care of yourself.

1740
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:55,060
Hot. Hot.

1741
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:56,399
Sorry about him.

1742
01:37:56,503 --> 01:37:57,060
Hey! Hey!

1743
01:37:57,171 --> 01:37:58,900
I miss you. I miss you.

1744
01:37:59,006 --> 01:37:59,938
Sorry about him right now.

1745
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,701
Hey, hey, come here for a sec. Sorry, come here for a sec.

1746
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:03,538
Wait, wait, come face me for a sec. Come face me.

1747
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:05,473
Okay, go back.

1748
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:06,273
Okay.

1749
01:38:10,084 --> 01:38:11,176
Aloha.

1750
01:38:12,486 --> 01:38:13,578
Aloha.

1751
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,154
Aloha.

1752
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:26,563
I should send a greeting e-mail.

1753
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:53,158
I didn't delete them.

1754
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,189
Give me one last first kiss!

1755
01:39:58,692 --> 01:40:00,060
Why?

1756
01:40:12,473 --> 01:40:14,575
Why do we have to break up?!

1757
01:40:15,989 --> 01:40:16,448
Sir!

1758
01:40:16,698 --> 01:40:17,699
What's going on, Sir?

1759
01:40:28,334 --> 01:40:29,836
More defined outline.

1760
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:45,393
Stronger contrast.

1761
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:53,943
Change your brush please.

1762
01:40:59,491 --> 01:41:01,367
You can't go in, Sir!

1763
01:41:07,624 --> 01:41:08,583
I have an appointment.

1764
01:41:09,167 --> 01:41:09,709
What's your name?

1765
01:41:11,586 --> 01:41:12,170
My name?

1766
01:41:13,922 --> 01:41:14,631
Well...

1767
01:41:20,428 --> 01:41:22,597
Dude, he forgot his name.

1768
01:41:23,348 --> 01:41:24,390
I feel bad for him.

1769
01:41:25,642 --> 01:41:26,351
Go on up.

1770
01:41:26,684 --> 01:41:28,603
And good luck with your memory recovery.

1771
01:41:28,895 --> 01:41:29,646
Thank you.

1772
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:34,054
Hi!

1773
01:41:34,192 --> 01:41:35,026
I'm Tom.

1774
01:41:35,735 --> 01:41:36,903
I met you before.

1775
01:41:37,445 --> 01:41:38,863
I'm looking for Rui.

1776
01:41:39,614 --> 01:41:41,282
Any idea where she is?

1777
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:43,409
Rui?!

1778
01:41:44,619 --> 01:41:45,995
Hi! I'm Tom.

1779
01:41:47,205 --> 01:41:48,873
Okay, thanks anyway.

1780
01:41:51,751 --> 01:41:53,128
Unique shape.

1781
01:41:53,307 --> 01:41:54,797
Thank you.

1782
01:42:00,981 --> 01:42:01,970
Rui?

1783
01:42:07,488 --> 01:42:08,819
There's something I'd like to ask.

1784
01:42:14,862 --> 01:42:16,329
Do you...

1785
01:42:17,197 --> 01:42:18,994
Do you know who I am?

1786
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:22,765
No.

1787
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:24,364
No?

1788
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:27,604
Oh, I see.

1789
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:30,669
What's your name?

1790
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:33,373
Daisuke.

1791
01:42:38,185 --> 01:42:39,447
Daisuke,

1792
01:42:41,421 --> 01:42:43,321
there's something I want to show you.

1793
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:45,253
Come with me.

1794
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:56,058
This is my studio.

1795
01:43:14,488 --> 01:43:15,789
Wow.

1796
01:43:19,393 --> 01:43:21,828
I don't know who you are.

1797
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:25,098
But...

1798
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,603
I see you in my dreams every night.

1799
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:37,911
Why?

1800
01:43:48,021 --> 01:43:50,524
The diary you read everyday,

1801
01:43:52,459 --> 01:43:53,794
before

1802
01:43:55,929 --> 01:43:57,664
had lots of things written about me.

1803
01:43:58,932 --> 01:44:00,200
I see.

1804
01:44:04,037 --> 01:44:05,939
I understand now.

1805
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:10,244
You

1806
01:44:14,181 --> 01:44:15,949
erased me. 

1807
01:44:17,517 --> 01:44:21,188
Because your existence will get in the way of my life.

1808
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:23,724
But it's not true.

1809
01:44:27,661 --> 01:44:29,830
I don't think I can be happy without you.

1810
01:44:30,397 --> 01:44:32,833
You are my happiness.

1811
01:44:38,005 --> 01:44:40,240
And I am the

1812
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:45,345
 "man of your dreams".

1813
01:44:55,722 --> 01:44:57,090
Daisuke.

1814
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:01,762
I'm glad I met you.

1815
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:06,566
Rui.

1816
01:45:08,702 --> 01:45:10,370
Me too.

1817
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:15,067
Good morning, Rui.

1818
01:46:20,674 --> 01:46:22,005
What's this?

1819
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:24,233
Watch this.

1820
01:46:29,112 --> 01:46:31,781
[ Good morning Rui ]

1821
01:46:32,657 --> 01:46:35,618
[ Don't worry and watch ]

1822
01:46:36,411 --> 01:46:40,289
[ Here are events you didn't know ]

1823
01:46:40,331 --> 01:46:44,460
[ On January 20, 2017, Trump is appointed as president ]

1824
01:46:44,669 --> 01:46:47,380
[ On April 7, 2017, US Military attacks missiles to Syria ]

1825
01:46:48,335 --> 01:46:52,139
Would thou take this woman as your wife,

1826
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:56,009
and swear to be with her all your life?

1827
01:46:57,677 --> 01:46:58,912
I swear.

1828
01:46:59,012 --> 01:47:01,314
Are thou serious?

1829
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:04,184
In ten years, she'll just be just an old woman.

1830
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:06,920
And you have to embrace her no matter what and it would just be a torture, you know.

1831
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,155
I told you that I swear.

1832
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:09,055
That's torture...

1833
01:47:09,156 --> 01:47:11,091
I told you, I swear. Your wife is here too, you know.

1834
01:47:11,958 --> 01:47:14,394
I love you, Honey. I love you!

1835
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:23,637
I now pronounce you

1836
01:47:23,737 --> 01:47:26,106
husband and wife.

1837
01:47:27,574 --> 01:47:29,209
You may kiss the bride.

1838
01:47:41,721 --> 01:47:43,824
That's too long. Hey, hey, hey.

1839
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:47,594
It's clearly long!

1840
01:47:47,694 --> 01:47:49,663
Hey, Daisuke.

1841
01:47:49,763 --> 01:47:51,231
Daisuke, knock her down!

1842
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:52,432
Daisuke, knock her down!

1843
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:54,334
Stop that!

1844
01:47:54,434 --> 01:47:55,335
Knock her down! Knock her down!

1845
01:47:55,435 --> 01:47:56,970
Push her down! Push her down! Push her down!

1846
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:59,005
You shouldn't do that! Hey!

1847
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:00,240
Don't be greedy!

1848
01:48:01,274 --> 01:48:02,909
Daisuke, knock her down!

1849
01:48:04,277 --> 01:48:05,946
Isn't that too long?

1850
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:11,618
- Yay!
- Yay!

1851
01:48:11,718 --> 01:48:13,520
Yay!

1852
01:48:18,758 --> 01:48:20,282
Okay, come on up.

1853
01:48:20,393 --> 01:48:23,260
You'll have the breakfast gazing at the best starry sky.

1854
01:48:23,363 --> 01:48:25,422
It's cold outside so wear something warm.

1855
01:48:25,532 --> 01:48:26,624
I love you.

1856
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,096
Good morning, Madame.

1857
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:05,228
Greet your daughter.

1858
01:49:05,572 --> 01:49:06,937
Come on, it's your Mom.

1859
01:49:07,941 --> 01:49:09,806
Hi! Mommy!

1860
01:49:11,711 --> 01:49:13,008
Good girl.

1861
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,445
Good morning.

1862
01:49:16,449 --> 01:49:18,076
I can't believe it.

1863
01:49:22,255 --> 01:49:25,850
This the scenery I want the woman I love the most to see.

1864
01:49:30,096 --> 01:49:31,188
Beautiful.

1865
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:35,728
I want to watch it forever.

1866
01:49:37,671 --> 01:49:39,298
Don't forget it, okay?

1867
01:49:47,781 --> 01:49:49,305
I won't forget it.

1868
01:49:51,606 --> 01:53:52,721
