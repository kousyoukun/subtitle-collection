1
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:55,400
<i>Acknowledge</i>
<i>when in position, Sergeant Davis.</i>

2
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,767
Dagger Team 1, copy. I keep losing you.

3
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,433
-How long till my backup's here?
<i>-Working on it. Stand by.</i>

4
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:12,667
<i>Say eight to ten minutes.</i>
<i>Advise you stay put.</i>

5
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,433
I can't wait for backup.

6
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,900
Send them in behind me.

7
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,067
<i>Davis, maintain your position.</i>
<i>They're on their way.</i>

8
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,933
Dagger Team 1, you seeing this?
There's some kind of disturbance here.

9
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,033
<i>Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?</i>

10
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,400
What the hell?

11
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:00,833
<i>Davis.</i>

12
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,767
<i>Davis, what's your status?</i>

13
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,067
<i>Davis, come in!</i>

14
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:12,833
Got you.

15
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,133
{\an8}--gonna get a late start.

16
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
{\an8}Right, well, it's a closed session.

17
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,467
Most of the specs stayed the same...

18
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,400
<i>Dr. Osbourne, call 204. Dr. Osbourne, 204.</i>

19
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,767
{\an8}They're issuing temporaries
for that R and D, as far as I know.

20
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,633
Is that part of the same badge or...?

21
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,667
I'm pretty sure.

22
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:02,900
- All right.
- How's it going?

23
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,133
- Hey.
- Hi.

24
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,700
- We'll get everything.
- Marty was already in?

25
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:07,633
Yeah.

26
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,500
And she's working on that project?

27
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,967
They'll be done in about a week.
I was gonna say...

28
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:15,933
<i>Don Taylor, report</i>
<i>to Laser Laboratory Building B, Laser Lab.</i>

29
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,467
Okay, I'll take a look.

30
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,133
- Where have you been?
- Solving problems.

31
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,033
You look... dusty.

32
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,433
Sometimes you gotta get dusty, Efrem.

33
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,900
-Test the pulse?
-Yeah.

34
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,667
Went down to the vault,
asked Johnson for some tetracene,

35
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,600
but apparently, we don't store it.

36
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,067
It's outdated and expensive as shit.

37
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,833
It got expensive.
Back in the '90s, it used to be cheap.

38
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,767
So, if you look hard enough...
you can still find some lying around.

39
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,100
You find a street gang
that slings tetracene?

40
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,633
Industrial printer cartridge,
$14.99 back in the day.

41
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,633
-Get me a mount, would you?
-Here you go.

42
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,833
Thank you.

43
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,733
You gonna tell the suits
you're running this on a 20-year-old part?

44
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,500
I'll show them it works and say:

45
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,633
"That's the difference between a prototype
and a production model."

46
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,467
Okay.

47
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,000
Concavity is spun to zero.

48
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,533
Lens track is hot.

49
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,733
Alignment is keyed in.

50
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,433
You are good to go.

51
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,433
I'll let you call it.

52
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:35,733
If you think about the applications on
other materials, it could be significant.

53
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,833
Metals, for instance, can be shattered
with very little effort or noise.

54
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:44,800
Concrete, rubber... they're all vulnerable
to violent temperature changes.

55
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:49,567
Yeah, this project started
as a request from SEAL Team 6.

56
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,000
After the siege in Rwanda,

57
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:54,133
they came to us
asking for the capability...

58
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,167
to flash freeze or boil
the enemy's water supply.

59
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:01,000
Now, this device could have
driven the enemy out.

60
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,733
And you... tried this on living things?

61
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:10,467
That wasn't our intent here, initially.

62
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:12,767
We'd like you test it.

63
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,167
Any volunteers?

64
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,800
Well... we'll give it a try.

65
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,600
Gentlemen, why don't we go sit down?
We'll talk over the next steps. All right?

66
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:25,633
Yeah. Right this way.

67
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,833
What do you want,
a clean conscience?

68
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:36,467
Test it with a slab of beef
for all I care.

69
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:39,633
What I want is to use it
for what we originally designed it as.

70
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,867
A deterrent.

71
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,067
Nobody said anything
about microwaving people's lungs.

72
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,100
It's war.

73
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,767
It's the business we're in.

74
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,167
Remember what you sold it to me as
when you hired me?

75
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,533
Defense.

76
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,500
And that's still partially true.

77
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,067
But war is good business.

78
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:58,100
So is human trafficking.

79
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:01,800
We work for DARPA, Mark.
We work for the government.

80
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,067
"I don't know what weapons
we'll use in World War III,

81
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:09,033
-but World War IV will be fought with--"
-"Sticks and stones." Albert Einstein.

82
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,433
-He worked for the government.
-Mm-hm. That's right.

83
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:15,533
And if you ask him, I don't think
he thought that was his finest hour.

84
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,100
I'm sure he has feelings about
flash-boiling human flesh.

85
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,400
Ever think about prosthetic limbs
with full sensory feedback?

86
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,167
Ah. Prosthetics... don't win wars.

87
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,600
Did you hear that?

88
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,133
That is the empathetic scientist
in you dying.

89
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,167
Hmm.

90
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,400
Did you brief your guys
on how to operate the ray?

91
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:34,667
-I did.
-Good.

92
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,533
Then you can start packing.

93
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,800
Can you be more specific?

94
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:39,733
Mm-hm.

95
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,467
About these goggles.

96
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:45,867
Your... hyperspectral goggles

97
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:50,833
being deployed by Special Forces
in Eastern Europe in the Moldovan War.

98
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:54,933
-I'm aware. I read the field reports.
-No, you have not read this report.

99
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:58,600
Orland called me personally.
General Orland.

100
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:02,067
He said things are very...
sensitive down there.

101
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,633
And they're... seeing things.

102
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,400
Okay. Like what?

103
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,900
They won't tell me.

104
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,467
They won't share the video feed.
They won't discuss what they're seeing.

105
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,567
They just want the lead engineer
down there to advise and consult.

106
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:23,900
Look, you invented these goggles
to keep our guys safe.

107
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:25,867
Well, now they need your help.

108
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,967
Think of it as defense.

109
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,133
Let me reboot the guidance system.

110
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,167
It's locked tight.
We have to pull it out.

111
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,100
{\an8}All right, let's go. Move it out.

112
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:13,100
-Mark Clyne?
-What?

113
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,633
You the guy that designed
the helmet cam?

114
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,400
-Yes. Mark Clyne.
-James Orland. Come with me.

115
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
A lot of new boots on the ground here.

116
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:25,433
The country's in chaos.

117
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,067
The insurgency is mostly remnants
of the military dictatorship

118
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,467
that ran this place
until about two months ago.

119
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:35,500
And their popular support is primarily
in the north part of the country...

120
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,133
near the Russian border,
and here in the capital.

121
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,967
The problem is
their forces are well-trained.

122
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,467
They're threatening to turn
this whole thing into a civil war.

123
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:52,767
Moldova. Russians had it, lost it.

124
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,467
It became independent,
but it's struggling internally.

125
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,500
On the one hand, you have an insurgency,

126
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,500
made up of the regime's
former elite soldiers.

127
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,400
They're well-trained and dangerous.

128
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,700
On the other,
you have most of the population,

129
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:10,100
who are tearing down the regime's flags
and demanding a new government.

130
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:14,767
Civil unrest, as complicated as it is,
is a business we're familiar with.

131
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,500
We like to think we're good at it.

132
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,533
But this thing your camera found...

133
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,100
it's a whole new piece of business.

134
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:33,033
I can't send this video to EUCOM.
I'm just afraid they'd think it's a joke.

135
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,733
DOD doesn't have a sense of humor.

136
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,833
Typically not. Hook us up.

137
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,767
I'm sure there's a scientific explanation
for what's on these,

138
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,833
but until you tell me,

139
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,867
I'm not sending it
up the chain of command.

140
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:49,933
- You done?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
-Get out. Seal us in. Wait outside.
-Sir.

142
00:11:57,067 --> 00:12:00,067
Nobody here has been able
to make heads or tails of this.

143
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,967
It's thrown a wrench
into our entire operation

144
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,633
for reasons I'm not at liberty
to discuss with you.

145
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,533
I can tell you we need answers fast.

146
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,000
-Do you mind?
-You spotted that quick.

147
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:42,167
Five different helmet cams picked up
something similar in the last three weeks.

148
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,167
At first, our signals intelligence tech
wrote it off as interference.

149
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,133
That's not interference.

150
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:55,467
I don't think you'd fly me
all the way here for interference.

151
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,933
Wanna tell me what you're thinking?

152
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,967
I want you to tell me
what you're thinking.

153
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,100
I don't know what I'm thinking... yet.

154
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,433
But there is an explanation.

155
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:11,533
That was the first sighting.
Three others just like it.

156
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,933
The last was different.
It involved a member of Delta Force,

157
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,767
that makes it particularly sensitive.

158
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:18,900
This is Fran Madison with CIA.

159
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:22,500
What Special Ops does here
is done under CIA covert operations.

160
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,800
You need to sign this
before we go any further.

161
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,133
-What is this?
-It's an SCI oath.

162
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,133
You're acknowledging it's life in prison
if you reveal anything you're told.

163
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:10,500
- Cue up the Davis file, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

164
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:13,767
Three days ago
we conducted a raid in mid-city.

165
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,067
Our communications were intermittent,
and a guy got separated from the group...

166
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,800
where he ended up killed in action.

167
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,100
He got closer than anybody.

168
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,833
Too close.

169
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,433
<i> Dagger Team 1, you seeing this?</i>
<i>There's some kind of disturbance here.</i>

170
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:54,433
<i>Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?</i>

171
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:55,800
<i>What the hell?</i>

172
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,733
Sergeant Chris Davis.

173
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,067
Three-tour combat vet. Best of the best.

174
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,600
In the last few weeks
we've been finding bodies around the city

175
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,100
that were killed in the same way.

176
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,500
The autopsies defied all explanation.

177
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,533
Their internal organs were frozen

178
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,633
and yet, their skin was burned
and corroded.

179
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:37,467
The only response from the allied Moldovan
military contact is shock, confusion.

180
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:38,600
And there's anger.

181
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:43,133
There's teenagers spray-painting
"genocide aratare" at kill sites.

182
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,533
-Genocide--?
-"Aratare."

183
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,133
It's a local myth. The ghosts of war.

184
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,100
"As nightmarish as."
That's the literal translation.

185
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,967
- That's very poetic.
- Well, they're superstitious.

186
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,833
They somehow think...

187
00:15:57,033 --> 00:16:00,567
the horrors of the war have
kicked up something unnatural.

188
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:04,167
-We hope you have an alternate theory.
-What do you think?

189
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,700
-Think you need a new name for them.
-Beyond that.

190
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,500
-Give me a copy of the data, some time--
-That's not possible.

191
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,600
You want me to figure this out right now?

192
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,867
- We want your assessment.
- I don't have one yet.

193
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,400
Then, I think we have to send our
working theory up the chain of command.

194
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:22,033
-I don't wanna do that.
-Okay. What is your working theory?

195
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,467
The agency thinks
this is some kind of cloaking technology.

196
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,033
Insurgent soldiers wearing
active camouflage.

197
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,033
In this country? Something that advanced?

198
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,600
CIA knows a few groups in Europe and Asia
could be working on active camouflage.

199
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:38,800
DARPA's worked on cloaking technology.
We're years away from a prototype.

200
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:42,133
-Maybe somebody beat you to it.
-DARPA is the leader in the field.

201
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,500
Are you certain of that?

202
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:46,600
The regime spent heavily
on weapons research.

203
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:50,067
Corruption, loose legislation.
You're a military lab and want obscurity?

204
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,633
-This is a great place to work and hide.
-Okay.

205
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,067
Let's say it is cloaking technology.

206
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:04,067
-How do you account for cause of death?
-A shock delivered to the victim.

207
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,100
I think you're reaching.

208
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:08,467
Our business requires us
to make suppositions.

209
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,400
My business requires us to prove them.

210
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,567
Your technician's job is to find glitches,
so, he sees glitches.

211
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,100
Your job is to find the enemy,
so, you see the enemy.

212
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,167
Locals believe in spirits,
so they see spirits.

213
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,833
Everyone is biased, in one way or another.

214
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:28,467
So, my answer to you right now is that
we lack data to support any theory.

215
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:29,933
Okay.

216
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,733
What do you need
to make a more definitive statement?

217
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,100
First, you need a better shot.

218
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,433
That's what I'm looking for,
a better shot.

219
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,067
How?

220
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,033
-Right here, sir.
-That's it.

221
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,033
I brought this from DARPA.
A hyperspectral camera.

222
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,067
A more powerful version of the helmet cams
your guys are using.

223
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:03,133
It sees deeper into the spectrum of light.

224
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Visible or invisible,
if something's there, this'll pick it up.

225
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:10,067
Can you mount this thing...
on a Delta vehicle?

226
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,100
- I don't see why not.
- All right, good.

227
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,167
We run missions into the city every day.

228
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,433
I'll put you with our field tech,
tell him how to operate it.

229
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,967
I wouldn't put a tech in between
this camera and myself.

230
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:24,867
So, you wanna operate it?

231
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:29,400
If you want that kill shot... you'll need
a fast reaction time out there.

232
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,500
Next mission, you ride with Delta.

233
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,900
They're gonna get you close to this thing.
You get me the kill shot...

234
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,867
you can go home to Virginia
without unpacking.

235
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,433
Got a bad rotor, you gotta swap that out.

236
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,700
Weld it onto the front panel.

237
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, well, well. Toll, check that out.

238
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:00,000
- What's this guy up to, man?
- I don't know.

239
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:01,400
Believe this guy?

240
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:03,133
- If it works.
- For real.

241
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,933
Heard you're installing a camera
on our truck.

242
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
Which was fine
until you ripped out that 50 cal.

243
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,467
You're taking down a gun
to put up a camera?

244
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,000
It's the only place large enough
to mount it.

245
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,933
You guys get that, right?
I know it sounds like a terrible idea.

246
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:23,733
We prefer to dance with who brung us...
Dr. Clyne. You get that, right?

247
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,033
"Dance with who brung you"?
No, actually, I don't.

248
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,400
This truck has saved our lives,
many times.

249
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:32,567
I understand.

250
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,600
You guys know Dr. Clyne's team
built that truck?

251
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,500
Clyne works over at DARPA.

252
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:44,000
I've worked closely with his group.
Been to their facilities in Virginia.

253
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,467
-Good to see you, Dr. Clyne.
-Good to see you, Captain Cabrera.

254
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:50,767
They retrofitted these trucks
with tougher, lighter weight armor.

255
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,767
They designed the mechanical loaders
that do the heavy lifting,

256
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,000
so you boys don't strain yourselves
too hard.

257
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,133
Matter of fact, Dr. Clyne himself

258
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,467
developed the thin weight Kevlar
body stocking that literally...

259
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:03,600
protects your balls.

260
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,800
So, I would think there'd be nothing
but goodwill in this group for Dr. Clyne.

261
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:14,000
-Major Sessions.
-Captain, have your men fall back.

262
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,167
- Get back to it.
- Get her done.

263
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,133
This is Dr. Clyne.

264
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,100
He's worked with us eight or ten times
over the last five years.

265
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,867
You ever go out with the assault team?

266
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:25,733
No, sir.

267
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,567
He's a good man, major.

268
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:30,900
That's great. I'm just not a fan
of taking tourists on combat missions.

269
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,400
Sir, I'm not a tourist.

270
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,033
If you're not carrying an M4,
you're a tourist.

271
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,600
I'll carry one, if you'd like.

272
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,400
We gotta get Dr. Clyne out in the field

273
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,700
to track the target force
and get a kill shot.

274
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,800
How long before
this equipment's operational?

275
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,033
A few hours.

276
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,500
-Is it gonna work?
-If we get close enough.

277
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,400
Let me tell you something.
Sergeant Davis... he got close enough.

278
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:54,533
That's the best Delta that we had.

279
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:58,900
Make sure your equipment
is top-notch this time.

280
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,867
-They were like brothers.
-I get it.

281
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,800
Okay.

282
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:15,833
Evening, doc.

283
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,667
Hear you two hit it off bigtime.

284
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:40,567
-She can come off a bit intense.
-Yeah. So can you.

285
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,433
I'm just here to find this thing.

286
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,700
You're willing to go on
a combat mission to find it.

287
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:48,633
She is, too.

288
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,967
She's under a lot of pressure from D.C.

289
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:54,633
They want an answer
and it's her job to give them one.

290
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,567
Saw your names on a mission roster.

291
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,667
I knew this was a top priority...

292
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:02,800
but for them to embed you both...

293
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,900
Well, you don't have to worry about me.

294
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:11,733
I'm not worried about you, doc.
I'm worried about it.

295
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,867
She's hoping it's cloaking technology.

296
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:18,667
What do you think it is?

297
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,167
Something no one's thought of yet.

298
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,133
Gentlemen, yesterday at 1800 hours,

299
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,133
Utah Team left here on a recon mission
to Durlesti,

300
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,000
when they were engaged by insurgents.

301
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:37,033
We managed to hear most
of their chatter during the firefight,

302
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,500
but coms were unreliable.

303
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:41,700
Target is a five-story
apartment building here.

304
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:45,833
We think what's left of Utah Team
is being held on the fourth floor,

305
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,667
in the northwest corner apartment.

306
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,067
We're gonna be knee-deep
in an insurgent-held area.

307
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,133
So, we should expect a fight.

308
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:53,867
One last thing.

309
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:58,400
Before our guys were grabbed,
they radioed in that they saw

310
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,467
what we're calling
hyperspectral anomalies.

311
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:04,500
Your mission is a quick extraction.
You get our guys and you get out.

312
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,967
However, if engaged,
neutralize the anomalies in the area.

313
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:09,967
Neutralize them?

314
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:15,000
-How?
-Yeah, what are we dealing with here?

315
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:18,633
We believe these are enemy soldiers
in advanced electronic camouflage.

316
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,967
-So, be surgical when you fire.
-If we don't really know what they are--

317
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,667
Excuse me?
Would you like to add something?

318
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,667
If they are wearing cloaking technology,

319
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:31,533
you need to bring it back
as intact as possible.

320
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,100
Dr. Clyne and Agent Madison
will be on mission with you.

321
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:37,567
Dr. Clyne will be monitoring
your helmet-cam feeds

322
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,600
from the second MRAP vehicle
in the convoy.

323
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Major Sessions will lead Dagger Team 1
to do the extraction.

324
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:46,600
Stay on coms. Get your gear.

325
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,033
- Partner, let's go.
- AJ, front and center.

326
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,667
Weapons check, Billy.

327
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,667
You got it.

328
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,967
<i>Our ride not smooth enough for you?</i>

329
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:34,800
<i>And you call yourself hard-ass.</i>

330
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:37,133
<i>They really need</i>
<i>to repave these roads, man.</i>

331
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,933
All right, guys,
we're coming into the abandoned zone.

332
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,433
Expect a heavy insurgent presence.

333
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,967
Okay.

334
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:30,067
<i>I've got an insurgent body here.</i>

335
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:41,900
I got Agopia from Utah Team.
Confirmed KIA.

336
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,900
<i>None of these guys appear to have taken</i>
<i>any rounds. No entry or exit wounds.</i>

337
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,967
Alessio here. Moving to the fifth floor.

338
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,400
-We got movement.
-Toll, check your 2 o'clock.

339
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:13,900
Where? We don't see anything.

340
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:16,467
-That's it. Right there.
-You're right on top of it.

341
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:19,467
<i>It's a motion signature.</i>
<i>There's something under that tub.</i>

342
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,733
Lewis, the tub.
I want you to flip over the tub.

343
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:39,167
-Toll, I want you on what's underneath.
-I'm on it.

344
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:46,800
One, two, three.

345
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,600
We have Comstock alive and conscious.

346
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,700
<i>Repeat. We have Sergeant Comstock</i>
<i>from Utah Team.</i>

347
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,967
Hey, buddy.

348
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,100
-Where's the rest of your team?
-They're upstairs.

349
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:13,600
But they're all gone.
Got under their skin.

350
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,733
-What got under their skin--?
-I saw it.

351
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,100
-But--?
-Blanket.

352
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:20,667
Like a frozen blanket.

353
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:24,933
-Okay, where is the rest of Utah?
-Oh, they're dead.

354
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,433
Yeah, they're all dead.

355
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,067
We're all dead.

356
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,900
<i>-Where are the bodies?</i>
<i>-I told you, they're on the top floor.</i>

357
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:11,100
Oh, you haven't seen it.

358
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,600
I've seen it.
You know I believe in God, John.

359
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,533
This is the opposite of God.

360
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,667
Wait. Who's this?
Can you tell him to turn back?

361
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:35,067
McFadden, turn back.
Give us a view of that room.

362
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:37,933
Nothing's there.
I'm standing right here.

363
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,567
Mac, we're both staring right at it.
It's in the middle of your view port.

364
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:44,400
What? That? It's a smear.

365
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,667
Probably these piece-of-shit goggles.

366
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,700
-No, no, no. Tell him to put them back on.
-Mac, put the goggles back on.

367
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,767
<i>Mac, do it now.</i>

368
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,600
-What the...?
-Take the shot.

369
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:06,067
They went right through it.

370
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,700
-Did he miss?
-He doesn't miss.

371
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Major Sessions, we have a KIA.
McFadden.

372
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:20,800
<i>A hyperspectral target is</i>
<i>on the fifth floor, northwest corner.</i>

373
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:22,500
<i>Switch to heavy rounds or 203s.</i>

374
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,800
<i>Whatever you have to do</i>
<i>to bring this thing down.</i>

375
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:41,667
Tell them to pull out.

376
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:49,500
There!

377
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,133
<i> Get everyone out now!</i>

378
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
-Tell them to pull out now.
-No, we're not leaving empty-handed.

379
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,167
I guarantee you're leaving empty-handed.

380
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,567
Come on!

381
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:13,500
Grenade!

382
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,833
- <i>We need support!</i>
- Get out.

383
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,833
All units evacuate now.
Let's go. Get back to the truck.

384
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:32,067
This room right here.
We can still grab him. Let's go! Move!

385
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:34,133
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

386
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,567
Go!

387
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:37,767
Here. Here, Jim.
Hold on. Here.

388
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:43,467
Evacuating via south face!
I got Talbot, Comstock, Riedel and Shaire.

389
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:44,700
<i>Five men down!</i>

390
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,433
We gotta travel together
and we gotta stay tight. Can you do that?

391
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,500
Oh, Jesus. Go!

392
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,167
Come on. Come on.

393
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,433
Move. Move, move.

394
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:30,733
You got him? Let's go.

395
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,600
Get out of the way.

396
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,067
Where?

397
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,867
-Right there!
-Where is it?

398
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:00,133
In front.

399
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,400
We gotta get in. Move.

400
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:08,900
-Help him in.
-Come on!

401
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,100
-Get in here!
-In you go.

402
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,167
No.

403
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,000
No.

404
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:47,700
Go, go!

405
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,133
- Move!
- Get in.

406
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,500
- Hey!
- Go, go!

407
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:52,767
We're in! Go!

408
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,733
Hold on, where's Cabrera?
Where's the captain?

409
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,133
Talk to me. Did you see him?

410
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,567
-Come on, talk to me, man.
-I saw him die.

411
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,433
-What?
-I saw him die.

412
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,067
- I'm going home.
- Yeah.

413
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:17,100
-I'm going home.
-Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

414
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,400
Look at me. Look at me.

415
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:21,700
-Did you see it?
-Yeah.

416
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:27,000
-You saw it. How close did you get?
-I was in a room with it for hours.

417
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:30,800
That tub saved my life.

418
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,033
I could feel it.

419
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,467
-Okay.
-I could feel it.

420
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,900
Land mines! Hold on!

421
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,800
Hey, buddy, look at me. No, no, no.

422
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:32,900
Shit.

423
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,433
Open the door.

424
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:40,833
Yeah.

425
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,567
- Come on. Now, move.
- Come on.

426
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,900
Both drivers are dead.

427
00:36:52,733 --> 00:36:55,800
Archer Lima 2. Hit a land mine.

428
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,500
Both vehicles destroyed.

429
00:36:59,033 --> 00:36:59,933
We are...

430
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:04,500
three clicks southeast of target building.

431
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,167
<i>We are losing your transmission.</i>

432
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:09,667
<i>Your transponders are down.</i>

433
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:12,067
No shit.
Our vehicles were just blown to hell.

434
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,400
We need to find cover.

435
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,000
<i>-I can't hear what you're saying.</i>
-Clyne, leave the camera.

436
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:19,833
Come on, Clyne.

437
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:28,733
Go, go, go.

438
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,433
Move, move.

439
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,867
Cover.

440
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,500
- Let's go.
- Get up, get up.

441
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:43,900
Come on.

442
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:45,533
Go, go, go.

443
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,000
Where you been?

444
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,700
Clear.

445
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,167
Who's injured?

446
00:37:52,633 --> 00:37:54,533
- Diaz?
- I think my ankle's broke.

447
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:58,900
We need an airlift.
I can't get a signal to base. Keep trying.

448
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:00,700
Com.
Get over here. Get over here.

449
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:01,633
Yeah.

450
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:06,000
Archer Lima 2. Archer Lima 2.

451
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,900
This is Dagger Team 1, over.

452
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,967
I'm good. I'm good.

453
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,733
Can they get in that way?

454
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:16,733
You all right?

455
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger Team 1.

456
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:20,033
Do you copy? Over.

457
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:26,700
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger Team 1.
Do you copy? Over.

458
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:29,767
Hey.

459
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,067
-How you doing? You're bleeding.
-Hmm?

460
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:39,933
Okay.

461
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,133
You hit your head.

462
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
You hit your head.

463
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,067
Did you black out?

464
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:51,700
Yeah, I guess so.

465
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:54,600
Major.

466
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:00,100
-She hit her head pretty bad.
-Let me see.

467
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:03,433
Pupils are huge.

468
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,467
Sir, I'm sending
but they're not receiving.

469
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:08,467
I'm hearing a click back
as soon as I sign over, but no answer.

470
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:09,400
Keep trying.

471
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:11,400
She's in shock. Keep an eye on her.

472
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,500
Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team 1. Do you copy? Over.

473
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,633
--over there.

474
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:17,033
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

475
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,767
Where's everyone else?
Where's the rest of Utah?

476
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm Sergeant Chen. I was with Utah.

477
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:28,167
We were the second team in last night.
There was eight of us.

478
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:34,633
-Do you have confirmed KIAs for Utah?
-Well, I can tell you this much.

479
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,967
Sergeant Comstock won't be
on your Christmas card this year.

480
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:41,067
- You saw insurgents kill Comstock?
- Insurgents?

481
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:42,533
Is this guy for real?

482
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:46,933
-What rock were you under?
-I was the radio operator.

483
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,833
We lost coms.
I was stuck in the truck the whole night.

484
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,633
-I never saw the active camouflage.
-Active camouflage?

485
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,033
Even if there was a such thing,
and there's not...

486
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,567
how does a human wearing active camouflage
walk through walls?

487
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:02,067
Or through three mags
of armor-piercing ammo?

488
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,533
I saw Pat pump 150 rounds at one of them.

489
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,867
This thing's killed
at least 19 of our men.

490
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,400
And we have no idea what it is.

491
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:18,467
Clyne.

492
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,067
You saw it.

493
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:24,533
What was it?

494
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:26,900
Human.

495
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,733
Had a human form.

496
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,967
It looked at me, it was conscious.

497
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:38,933
Like a person.

498
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:46,567
Is there anything that explains
what you saw?

499
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:48,700
No.

500
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,800
Let's pull together
all the functional goggles that we have.

501
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:57,967
-My goggles were wasted in the crash, sir.
-Yeah. Mine, too. They're trashed.

502
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:00,533
Forget the goggles.
We can't recharge them anyway.

503
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:02,167
So, what do we do?

504
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:04,767
How are we supposed to see them?

505
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,733
Maybe that camera can still help us.

506
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,533
If we get to an elevated position,
we'd have a better vantage point.

507
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,467
Help me with this?

508
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,400
Let's go. Let's move out. Move.

509
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,433
They're everywhere.

510
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,833
Something's stopping them.

511
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,733
Some sort of black sand.

512
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,133
I fell in that sand.

513
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:08,733
-I had to... pick it out of my hand.
-Let me see it.

514
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:15,500
-Little, sharp pieces of metal.
-They're iron filings.

515
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,433
- It's pure iron.
- Yeah.

516
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,467
And there's a trail of it...
all the way around the building.

517
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:31,167
It's a barrier. Someone put it there.

518
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:35,667
I don't think we're alone.

519
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,033
Let's stack up and sweep upstairs.

520
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,467
Point and shoot?

521
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:45,567
Point and shoot.

522
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,133
Breach! Breach!

523
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:08,500
- I've got kids.
- Clear.

524
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:09,833
- Clear.
- All clear.

525
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,900
Tell them to take the long wall.

526
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,567
Ask them where they got this,
and who else is here.

527
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:33,533
Ask them if there's anyone else
in the factory, and do they have guns.

528
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:48,000
She says they're here alone.

529
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:50,867
Only that one gun. No soldiers are here.

530
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,100
- No one at all.
- Major Sessions.

531
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,500
-What's the problem?
-This factory has a transmission tower.

532
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:03,933
It puts out a huge signal.

533
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,833
So, what's the problem?

534
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:09,000
Everyone within 20 miles will hear
our conversation with base.

535
00:45:09,867 --> 00:45:12,100
Any insurgent radio will pick up
our transmission.

536
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:16,500
Insurgents are the least of your worries.

537
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:18,767
Connect me to General Orland
as soon as possible.

538
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,433
Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team. Do you copy?

539
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,733
<i>Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2,</i>
<i>this is Dagger Team. Do you copy?</i>

540
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,433
<i>Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2,</i>
<i>this is Dagger Team. Do you copy?</i>

541
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,867
You guys are our new recruits.

542
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:58,500
And believe me... we could use the help.

543
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Come on, tough guy. Show me what you got.

544
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:15,433
Hey, I need to ask you something.

545
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:20,667
Was it your idea...
to put the barrier... outside?

546
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,833
Their father. Their father knew.

547
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:31,000
Their father rolled open barrels
of the iron shavings around the building.

548
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:33,133
He saved their lives.

549
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:37,167
What happened to your father?

550
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:40,900
You're a little scrapper,
aren't you?

551
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:47,067
Hey, buddy, you all right?
Come on, get up.

552
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,900
What are you doing?

553
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:04,667
Are you a ghost?

554
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:05,800
Mm.

555
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:06,800
Aratare.

556
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:11,633
-He says, "Don't say that word."
-Ask him what they are.

557
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:14,933
Lost souls.

558
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:16,800
Souls of the dead.

559
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,033
They're trapped between life and death,
and they can't find peace.

560
00:47:24,933 --> 00:47:26,100
How's that happen?

561
00:47:29,633 --> 00:47:30,667
He says, "War."

562
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,967
Come on.

563
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:47,733
If their father put down
the iron shavings,

564
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,067
he knows more about these things
than any of us do.

565
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,500
Ask her where her father is.

566
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,133
Her brother, Bogdan, doesn't know.

567
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,400
He thinks he went to get help.

568
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,133
He died outside,
when he was making the barrier.

569
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:38,500
She had to bring him in here.

570
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:40,133
I'm so sorry.

571
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,567
-Okay?
-Yeah.

572
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:53,867
Ceramic tile.

573
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:59,667
Ask her how her father knew about
the iron filings stopping the Aratare.

574
00:49:00,433 --> 00:49:03,567
- What else did he know about them?
- She doesn't know.

575
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,700
"Masarov."

576
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,700
- What is Masarov?
- It's a place.

577
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:14,133
It's a district up the river.

578
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,000
It's where it all began.

579
00:49:21,033 --> 00:49:23,433
It's where the Aratare killings started.

580
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:25,000
Aratare.

581
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,933
I'm saying we land the helos right here.

582
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,733
Extract us from this roof
and get us the hell out of here.

583
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,567
There are power lines everywhere.
The helos would have to fly low and slow.

584
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:38,767
Easy pickings
for a teenager with a rocket.

585
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:41,567
Can you get me up to speed?
You spoke with base?

586
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:44,533
Yeah. The general's sending in helos
to come get us,

587
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,133
and tanks to secure the landing zone
in an open plaza

588
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,100
-about half a mile from here, at dawn.
-That's a long way on foot.

589
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,700
You think we can make it a half a mile?
With kids?

590
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:59,067
We don't have an option. Okay?
All the roads are either blocked or mined.

591
00:49:59,133 --> 00:50:01,133
And since we used the tower
to talk to base,

592
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,667
everyone knows where we are.
We gotta move out.

593
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:06,967
You wanna go running around
with those things roaming the streets?

594
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:08,933
Even though we have no way to fight them?

595
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,400
Better than waiting for them
to find a way in.

596
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,133
The only reason we're
still alive is that barricade out there.

597
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,033
Eventually they're gonna get through.
It's just a matter of time.

598
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,567
- Wait.
- We have to take our chances.

599
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:21,733
-This is the best plan that we have.
-Major.

600
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:25,400
What if I said I can improve our chances
of making that plaza?

601
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:27,467
-I'm listening.
-Take a look around you.

602
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:31,667
Everything in this building...
is filled with this.

603
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:33,433
Iron dust.

604
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:37,400
And the iron stops the hyperspectrals.

605
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,500
Exactly. Weaponize it.

606
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,100
-Dirty bombs.
-Best idea I've heard all night.

607
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:44,167
Let's collect the grenades.

608
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,033
Clyne.

609
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:24,133
I need you to be our eyes out there.

610
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,967
-Can you haul that camera on foot?
-I've got a better idea.

611
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:31,100
This camera already projects
the right wavelength of UV light.

612
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:36,067
If I can turn it inside out, by reversing
the polarity of some of the components,

613
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:39,133
I might be able to turn it from a camera
into a searchlight.

614
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:41,867
We'll be able to see them
with our own eyes.

615
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,633
-That'd be a game-changer.
-Think I can talk to the convoy?

616
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,067
I'll them how to do the same
with their equipment.

617
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:50,667
When they come get us,
they're gonna need eyes, too.

618
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,567
I'll connect you
to the main engineer back at base.

619
00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:10,967
Copy that.

620
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,700
They're ready to equip their vehicles
with whatever you need.

621
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,600
Can you repeat
the whole request back to me, please?

622
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:20,133
<i>Okay, yes. That's correct.</i>

623
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,767
<i>What you need is a device that emits</i>
<i>a very short wavelength of light.</i>

624
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:26,033
<i>I can tell you exactly how to rewire that.</i>

625
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:28,800
<i>Do you have anything</i>
<i>you can mount on a tank?</i>

626
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,567
We got movement across the alleyway.

627
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,500
Guys, we got movement.
Can we get eyes on it?

628
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,000
Hey, guys, stand clear for a second.

629
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:34,000
-What's the word on the convoy?
-Last contact was 50 minutes ago.

630
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,800
They're on their way
to the extraction point.

631
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:06,967
Here they come! Get your gear.
We're leaving this building in 15 seconds.

632
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:08,600
Okay, come on. Let's go.

633
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:11,467
That was the fastest way
to the extraction point.

634
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:12,767
- Yeah.
- Hey.

635
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,067
She says she can show us another way.

636
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:16,933
Talbot, you're with Clyne.
Diaz, you're on point.

637
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:24,600
Let's go.

638
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:30,900
Yup. Moving.

639
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,800
Okay, let's go.

640
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,033
Come on.

641
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,467
Come here.

642
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,633
Everybody's accounted for.

643
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,467
- It looks clear.
- Let's move. Come here.

644
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:00,833
Okay.

645
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,667
She says, "Go right, here."

646
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,667
Hey. Heads up, 6 o'clock.

647
00:55:14,867 --> 00:55:16,400
- Move!
- Move!

648
00:55:16,467 --> 00:55:17,533
Move!

649
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,000
They're coming.

650
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:24,033
Come on.

651
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:26,533
Come on.

652
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:38,433
Watch out!

653
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:48,933
Oh, shit.

654
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,867
- Come on, Lewis! Let's go!
- I think it's working!

655
00:55:57,533 --> 00:55:59,533
- In here!
- This way.

656
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:02,167
Move, move.

657
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,867
Go!

658
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:22,900
Go!

659
00:56:24,867 --> 00:56:26,433
- Move it!
- Come on.

660
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,033
- Pick up!
- Get up.

661
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,933
- I'm good.
- Go! Go!

662
00:56:38,033 --> 00:56:39,400
Steady your gun!

663
00:56:41,467 --> 00:56:43,467
- Get down!
- Take cover, man.

664
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:45,800
Come on, doctor. Come on.

665
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:47,767
Incoming!

666
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,900
I got a man down! Man down!

667
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,933
Run!

668
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:10,133
- Moving it up!
- More on that side!

669
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:17,933
Hurry.

670
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:22,567
She says,
"Straight ahead, under the archway."

671
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:24,533
Watch yourself.

672
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,867
- Hold it.
- She says this is the place.

673
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:30,733
Go, go.

674
00:57:38,033 --> 00:57:38,933
Looks clear.

675
00:57:47,867 --> 00:57:49,733
- Where are they?
- Get on the bus. Go.

676
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,133
Where's the rescue?

677
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:57,500
Where's the light?

678
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,933
Come on. Come on, come on.
Work. Work. Work.

679
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:05,467
Come on. It's okay.

680
00:58:06,467 --> 00:58:09,100
You sure this is the place?

681
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:10,967
-Yeah.
-Ask them if they're sure.

682
00:58:11,633 --> 00:58:12,967
She said, "I'm pretty sure."

683
00:58:17,867 --> 00:58:18,900
Major.

684
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:21,967
This thing is dead. We can't see them.

685
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,133
We're blind.

686
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:56,400
-That's us.
-This is the landing zone.

687
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,067
-Commander, are you seeing this?
-Those are the targets.

688
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:49,133
-Go! Go! Go!
-Go!

689
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,667
- Go, go, go.
- Let's go.

690
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:52,867
Move. Go on.

691
00:59:58,133 --> 00:59:59,567
On the ground.

692
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:02,133
Fire.

693
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:24,033
Get down!

694
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:43,000
- Move on my command.
- Move it out!

695
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,000
Hey! Hey!

696
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:51,733
Overhead!

697
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,467
Let's get to the tanks!
Move it to the tanks!

698
01:00:58,533 --> 01:00:59,733
- Move it!
- Move!

699
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,667
Move!

700
01:01:01,967 --> 01:01:04,700
- Open fire!
- Let it go!

701
01:01:04,767 --> 01:01:05,933
- Get back!
- No.

702
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,167
Get back!

703
01:02:00,733 --> 01:02:01,767
Left flank!

704
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,000
Your six!

705
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:07,567
- Where are they?
- I don't know!

706
01:02:07,633 --> 01:02:09,167
- Where's Bogdan?
- Where'd he go?

707
01:02:10,033 --> 01:02:11,833
- Who's got him?
- Do you see them?

708
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:20,567
We'll find you!

709
01:02:22,867 --> 01:02:24,933
-Bogdan!
-Bogdan!

710
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,167
Get him!

711
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,933
Bogdan! Bogdan!

712
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,900
- Bogdan!
- Get back here!

713
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:33,133
Get back here!

714
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:22,433
- Come on!
- Come on.

715
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,567
-Take her.
-Get up.

716
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,967
Help her! Save her!

717
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:26,133
I got her.

718
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,633
Let's go.

719
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,833
Come on!

720
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,000
- Get up. Come on.
- Dr. Clyne, come on!

721
01:04:20,933 --> 01:04:22,733
- Get in!
- Okay.

722
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,700
Major. General Orland.

723
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,100
General, go for Sessions.

724
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:02,567
<i>Base has been lost!</i>

725
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:06,000
<i>- We're sending you to our refugee bunker!</i>
- Yes, sir.

726
01:05:08,633 --> 01:05:10,967
Hey, where are we going?
Base is that way.

727
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,567
-We're not going to base.
-Why not?

728
01:05:13,633 --> 01:05:15,033
It's been compromised.

729
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:22,100
Hey,
they're spreading through the streets.

730
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:26,500
They're everywhere.

731
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,467
-They just gonna leave us here?
-There's more people to airlift.

732
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:03,767
-What is this place?
-Entrance is over here.

733
01:06:15,533 --> 01:06:17,633
Open the door! Open the door!

734
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,767
Get back!

735
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,400
Put your weapons down.

736
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,667
Put your weapons down! Do it now!

737
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:43,867
He's saying, "Safe inside."

738
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:47,533
Hey.

739
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,867
Okay. It's okay.

740
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:06,567
Stay close.

741
01:07:10,867 --> 01:07:12,767
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.

742
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,800
She's not okay. Come here.

743
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,133
I'm gonna need some room.
It's okay. It's okay.

744
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,800
- What the hell happened to base?
- Base got overrun.

745
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:32,567
-The general is meeting us here.
-So, what is this place?

746
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,100
We're in a civilian refugee shelter.

747
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:38,800
This bunker has 20 feet
of concrete and steel.

748
01:07:38,867 --> 01:07:41,733
Are we safe here? I have no idea.
But there's food and water.

749
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,867
Talbot, gather what you can.
Toll, Chen, head back to the entrance.

750
01:07:44,933 --> 01:07:46,933
There's a com center.
See who you can reach.

751
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,700
Alessio, you're with me. Let's go.

752
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,000
- There.
- Where?

753
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:53,567
- There.
- Right over there.

754
01:07:53,633 --> 01:07:54,600
- Okay.
- On the bed.

755
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:56,733
You're okay. Shh. You're gonna be okay.

756
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,867
- What happened?
- It's her shoulder.

757
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:03,067
- Her shoulder has shrapnel in it.
- We're gonna cut open her sleeve.

758
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:13,833
Get the IV line ready.

759
01:08:17,733 --> 01:08:18,633
This is yours.

760
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,033
Now, I need your help, Sari,
to stop the Aratare.

761
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,400
I need to know what your father knew.

762
01:08:25,867 --> 01:08:27,067
What did your father do?

763
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,933
He worked with ceramics.

764
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,933
What did he make?

765
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:38,100
He made containers.

766
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:44,167
He made containers for Masarov.

767
01:08:45,533 --> 01:08:48,133
The power plant
where the Aratare came from.

768
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:51,033
Let's get the mask on her.

769
01:08:51,867 --> 01:08:53,167
Okay, we have to take her now.

770
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:07,133
- This is the U.S. Armed Forces!
- Open it.

771
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,600
Lower your weapons.

772
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:39,767
-How many are you?
-Not many.

773
01:09:53,933 --> 01:09:55,400
Let's give them a hand.

774
01:09:56,767 --> 01:09:57,667
Let's go.

775
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:00,500
Bring as much as you can.

776
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,967
<i> The base was overrun.</i>

777
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,567
It was like a wave.

778
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:06,733
Invisible.

779
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:09,533
Men just started falling.

780
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,600
Our conventional weapons were useless.

781
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,467
I requested an order
to evacuate the base...

782
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,900
but our long-range coms
are completely scrambled.

783
01:10:19,933 --> 01:10:21,700
So, I took all the gear I could.

784
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:24,833
I started sending units north
out of the area of operation.

785
01:10:26,533 --> 01:10:28,733
Kept five aircraft
with the least amount of fuel,

786
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,167
stayed behind with one platoon.

787
01:10:33,867 --> 01:10:36,133
Out of the 240 of us,
we have 19 remaining.

788
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:41,767
Did you get a message
to higher command?

789
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,067
No.

790
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,433
-Is there a rescue mission planned?
-No. We intercepted radio chatter

791
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,600
from Moldovan friendlies
to find this place.

792
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,967
We sent that bird to pick you up
and bring you here.

793
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,500
If you'd even tried to return to base,
you'd be dead.

794
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:59,000
We're the last U.S. forces in the country?

795
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:00,833
I hope so.

796
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:04,467
So, what's the plan, sir?

797
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:06,400
Came here to regroup, major.

798
01:11:07,133 --> 01:11:08,133
There's no plan.

799
01:11:14,567 --> 01:11:17,600
-I recommend we fortify the entrance.
-Fortify with what?

800
01:11:17,667 --> 01:11:20,500
-We wait till a rescue mission--
-Fortify with what?

801
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:22,467
They'll come through whatever you use.

802
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:26,400
-We need to take our chances on a helo--
-There's 20 minutes of flight time!

803
01:11:26,467 --> 01:11:28,900
Twenty minutes of flight time
in those birds. Not more!

804
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:31,133
There's not enough room
for all of us anyway.

805
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,833
We need to form teams
and take the aircraft.

806
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,800
But where you gonna go, major?

807
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:38,400
You can't run from them.

808
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,867
You can't stop them.
Your weapons are useless.

809
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,700
We have no idea what they are!

810
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,967
If they come through
that door, we're sitting ducks.

811
01:11:48,033 --> 01:11:50,033
We can't stop them!
We can't stop them!

812
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,033
Take what we can and go.

813
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:01,633
I know what they are.

814
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:06,933
I know what they are.

815
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:09,867
I know what they are.

816
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,167
We think we're seeing things.

817
01:12:15,933 --> 01:12:18,600
We think it can't be real, but it kills.
So, it is real.

818
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,033
It's something.

819
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,100
It's not light, it's not shadow,

820
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,700
or some trick of the mind.
Pass through walls, check.

821
01:12:26,033 --> 01:12:27,767
Outside the visible spectrum, check.

822
01:12:29,133 --> 01:12:30,500
Kills to the touch, check.

823
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:35,600
Comstock. He was under a ceramic bathtub,
is that right?

824
01:12:36,933 --> 01:12:39,133
Tank armor.
It couldn't pass through tank armor.

825
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,167
M1 Abrams tank armor,
that's ceramic plating everywhere.

826
01:12:42,433 --> 01:12:45,400
It cannot pass through ceramic.
You know what that means?

827
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,000
It means this stuff isn't natural.

828
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:50,433
Someone made it.

829
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:53,433
It's man-made.

830
01:12:54,767 --> 01:12:55,800
Man-made how?

831
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,733
Okay. You have solid, liquid, gas.
Lava can turn into rock.

832
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,867
Ice can turn into water. Metals can melt.
These are natural states.

833
01:13:04,933 --> 01:13:08,000
But there are unnatural states.
Artificial states, man-made states.

834
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:10,467
Condensate.

835
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:12,900
Bose-Einstein condensate.

836
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:16,733
A state of matter that was predicted
by Nath Bose and Albert Einstein.

837
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,633
It has some very unusual properties.
It can be slowed down by iron filings.

838
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,833
It cannot pass through ceramic,
but it can pass through walls.

839
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,400
It's so cold it will kill you instantly
on contact.

840
01:13:26,467 --> 01:13:28,500
It can do everything
we've been seeing here.

841
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:32,133
To create Bose-Einstein condensate,
you need power, and you need a lot of it.

842
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,033
Masarov. The power plant.

843
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,033
Yes, Masarov. Where they were made.

844
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,100
You said this country was pouring billions
into weapons research.

845
01:13:39,867 --> 01:13:40,733
This is a weapon.

846
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,833
-And it was set loose, or it broke loose.
-All right, but these things climb.

847
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,400
They're like humans.
It looks like a person.

848
01:13:47,867 --> 01:13:50,000
So can marble and clay in the right hands.

849
01:13:50,067 --> 01:13:51,133
And I wanna know why.

850
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,133
Why they look like people.
I can't tell you how they did this.

851
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,433
What I can tell you...
is that someone made them.

852
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,500
If someone made them, they don't escape
the laws of the world. Nothing does.

853
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:04,600
It shines light on new laws,
and that's what we have to learn.

854
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:07,400
-They have order and structure.
-They can be broken down.

855
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,100
Anything can be. It's just energy.
And since I know what they are,

856
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:14,133
-I can build the right weapons.
-What kind of weapons?

857
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,933
Plasmic-discharge.
They can tear apart the condensate.

858
01:14:17,533 --> 01:14:20,933
-Where will we find weapons like that?
-We're gonna build them.

859
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,900
-Build them with what?
-Anything we can find in this bunker.

860
01:14:23,967 --> 01:14:26,500
Anything with electronics.
Optics, ballistic casings.

861
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:28,467
All the gear you brought from base.

862
01:14:28,533 --> 01:14:31,033
We can take it all apart,
and I can build an arsenal.

863
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,700
And then we can go to Masarov
and stop this before it goes any further.

864
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:38,433
Because if we don't, the condensate
will feed on all the energy in its path.

865
01:14:38,867 --> 01:14:39,867
It'll grow exponentially.

866
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,700
There's no limit
to how far they can spread.

867
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,467
Unless we stop them.

868
01:14:49,133 --> 01:14:51,433
Let's get this gear inside, guys. Come on.

869
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,633
Let's move!

870
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,067
Same number each side.

871
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,633
All right, let's go, boys!

872
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,800
Any med patches in there?

873
01:15:28,867 --> 01:15:30,600
We got three of them over here.

874
01:15:30,867 --> 01:15:34,467
It's a ground-to-air tracking scope.
We can use this. They have good optics.

875
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,400
- Good. This is good.
- Two more over there.

876
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,567
See that 305?

877
01:15:39,633 --> 01:15:42,733
Half of these are labeled "defective."
We need a voltage counter.

878
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,400
I want you to start testing these.

879
01:15:47,667 --> 01:15:49,033
All right, open it up.

880
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:55,567
Get that one open. Pop it.

881
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:58,033
Is that what I think it is?

882
01:15:58,933 --> 01:16:00,733
We got the lotus from base.

883
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,767
That's badass.

884
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,933
-Looks like a mechanical Rottweiler.
-Look at that.

885
01:16:05,567 --> 01:16:06,867
Clyne's making a few changes.

886
01:16:06,933 --> 01:16:09,867
They're taking down a chain
hoist and putting up a searchlight.

887
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:11,700
Déjà vu.

888
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:20,800
-What does it fire?
-It's a focused energy pulse.

889
01:17:21,633 --> 01:17:22,833
If my math is right...

890
01:17:24,867 --> 01:17:26,767
it should break down condensate.

891
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,100
Masarov.

892
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,533
The single largest power plant
in the region.

893
01:17:40,533 --> 01:17:44,000
It's where the killings started.
If they're man-made, they were made here.

894
01:17:44,067 --> 01:17:45,867
It's less than ten clicks from here.

895
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:50,167
Our birds can make that,
but... it's probably one way.

896
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:54,633
I've been digging for clues with
the civilians. I found intel on Masarov.

897
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,967
It's been retrofitted several times
over the last decade

898
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,467
by the central regime.

899
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,767
It's got "weapons research"
written all over it.

900
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,533
Okay, you and Clyne need to be
embedded to infiltrate.

901
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,133
It's up to the both of you
to figure out how to stop this.

902
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,400
We have to create a diversion.

903
01:18:09,933 --> 01:18:13,067
We'll draw them out here
so you can infiltrate the structure

904
01:18:13,133 --> 01:18:14,800
and try to find the source.

905
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,933
Clyne's predicting the charge from these
will be extremely hot.

906
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,767
Enough to destroy condensate.

907
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,733
We'll find out soon enough.

908
01:18:30,633 --> 01:18:31,500
All right, boys.

909
01:18:32,533 --> 01:18:33,400
This is it.

910
01:18:35,067 --> 01:18:36,567
If you have any last words...

911
01:18:37,433 --> 01:18:38,133
now's the time.

912
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:07,800
<i>All right, listen up.</i>

913
01:19:08,733 --> 01:19:10,767
<i>You are using untested weapons...</i>

914
01:19:12,067 --> 01:19:15,667
against an enemy that, to this point,
has been unstoppable.

915
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,667
Now, you are heading
into unknown territory.

916
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:22,100
And hear me when I say you're gonna
see things you will not understand.

917
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:25,533
Our enemy has spread through the city
in a matter of days.

918
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:28,433
There's no telling
how far they will spread...

919
01:19:29,067 --> 01:19:30,133
unless we fight back.

920
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:36,733
Most men never even come close...
to changing the future.

921
01:19:39,967 --> 01:19:40,933
This is the place.

922
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:44,667
And now is the time.

923
01:19:46,433 --> 01:19:49,400
Make no mistake,
you're the last line of defense.

924
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:54,633
Let's go do what we came here to do.

925
01:20:09,733 --> 01:20:10,967
Let's go, let's go!

926
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,700
One minute.

927
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:14,967
<i> Thirty seconds.</i>

928
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:17,633
<i> Spearhead 1, proceed with descent.</i>

929
01:21:28,033 --> 01:21:29,167
All right, let's go.

930
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:34,767
Here we go.

931
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,467
Let's move!

932
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,467
<i> We have a visual.</i>

933
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:25,567
<i>Hostile target gathering at 12 o'clock</i>
<i>on east end of platform.</i>

934
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:28,133
Move, move!

935
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,767
<i> We are a go.</i>

936
01:23:32,433 --> 01:23:33,867
I have a confirmed spectral kill.

937
01:23:35,133 --> 01:23:37,567
We're a go. I say again, all units go.

938
01:23:37,633 --> 01:23:40,133
-Let's show them what we've got.
-Come on.

939
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,567
- This is it!
- Let's do it!

940
01:23:41,633 --> 01:23:42,733
Let's go. Drop.

941
01:23:43,933 --> 01:23:46,567
<i> Copy, Spearhead 1.</i>
<i>All units engage.</i>

942
01:23:47,067 --> 01:23:49,167
<i>Spearhead 2 taking north peninsula.</i>

943
01:23:50,667 --> 01:23:53,467
<i>Spearhead 3 beginning</i>
<i>descent over south peninsula.</i>

944
01:23:54,133 --> 01:23:56,467
<i>At least a dozen targets coming out.</i>

945
01:23:56,933 --> 01:23:58,800
- Go! Go!
- Let's move!

946
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,700
- On me!
<i>- All units, you are clear to engage.</i>

947
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:03,933
- Move in!
- Move it!

948
01:24:06,467 --> 01:24:07,600
Lock and load.

949
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:08,933
- Move out.
- Let's move.

950
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,533
Right behind you!

951
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,167
<i>Weapons free! Weapons free!</i>

952
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:14,967
Let's go. Move up!

953
01:24:16,533 --> 01:24:18,033
- Move!
- Come on!

954
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:21,533
- I said go, go, go!
- Move!

955
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:28,867
<i>Spearhead 2, you're go</i>
<i>for infield. Proceed to insertion point.</i>

956
01:24:33,733 --> 01:24:34,933
Go, go, go!

957
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,700
Get down!

958
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,967
Right there.

959
01:25:57,633 --> 01:26:00,100
-Toll!
-Go! Go!

960
01:26:01,467 --> 01:26:02,733
Go, go, go!

961
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,400
Go, go, go!

962
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,800
- Somebody get on top!
- Down right there!

963
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,167
- We got more incoming!
- Keep formation!

964
01:26:17,433 --> 01:26:18,433
Let's move it!

965
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,067
Fight! Fight!

966
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:27,700
Move!

967
01:26:30,667 --> 01:26:32,867
- Let's go, go, go!
- Go, John!

968
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,633
Do we have a sit-rep? Right now.

969
01:26:38,933 --> 01:26:41,400
<i>Clyne, what's the situation down there?</i>

970
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,533
Sessions, we got split up.

971
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,400
-We're still looking for the lab.
-We're holding. Don't know how long.

972
01:26:47,867 --> 01:26:50,633
<i>-Do you copy?</i>
-Can you hear me? Sessions?

973
01:26:54,067 --> 01:26:55,033
We gotta keep going.

974
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,867
We gotta be close now.

975
01:27:34,733 --> 01:27:35,867
God.

976
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:51,700
Look over here.

977
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,467
Bose-Einstein condensate.

978
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:10,000
Look at these x-rays.

979
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:17,133
They were scanning people.
On a molecular level.

980
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:27,600
And printing them out of condensate.

981
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:35,833
It's an assembly line.

982
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,067
Like some kind of...

983
01:28:39,067 --> 01:28:40,800
industrial process.

984
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:42,433
You're right.

985
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,533
It's a weapon.

986
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:21,933
What happened here?

987
01:29:23,133 --> 01:29:24,900
It looks like a catastrophic failure.

988
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,433
Half the cells are broken and empty.

989
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,867
Some structural failure
must have set them free.

990
01:29:29,933 --> 01:29:31,400
Opened up Pandora's Box.

991
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:33,433
Now what?

992
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,600
Incoming!

993
01:29:51,067 --> 01:29:52,433
Hey!

994
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,567
Hey, 12 o'clock!

995
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,733
- Do it!
- They're coming back!

996
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,800
- They're moving!
<i>- All eyes on target.</i>

997
01:30:06,867 --> 01:30:09,567
<i>- One of them is reforming.</i>
<i>- Bring it down!</i>

998
01:30:30,767 --> 01:30:32,933
"Top research advisers
of the central regime."

999
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:37,167
This man was trying to stop it.
They did lose control.

1000
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:40,433
Can you translate this?

1001
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,433
It's an emergency shutdown procedure.
Half these words I've never seen.

1002
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,667
What about the other half?

1003
01:31:03,533 --> 01:31:05,800
"Decouple-- Decouple procedure.

1004
01:31:05,867 --> 01:31:11,000
Disconnect the umbilicals to, uh...
interrupt the... neural activity."

1005
01:31:11,067 --> 01:31:14,467
-Okay.
-So, you gotta unlock all these ports.

1006
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:18,000
And then you gotta pull this bracket here
to release all the cables.

1007
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:19,800
And then?

1008
01:31:20,567 --> 01:31:21,700
That should stop them.

1009
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:29,967
Take this.

1010
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,133
Come on! Get up!

1011
01:32:43,567 --> 01:32:44,900
Right there! There's more!

1012
01:32:45,533 --> 01:32:46,400
Another one!

1013
01:33:08,967 --> 01:33:10,100
Got it right there!

1014
01:33:15,567 --> 01:33:17,533
-Clyne!
-I know!

1015
01:33:43,433 --> 01:33:44,467
What the hell?

1016
01:33:44,933 --> 01:33:47,000
I did them all. Nothing's happening.

1017
01:34:01,533 --> 01:34:05,700
Clyne! Pull the bracket! In the middle!

1018
01:34:10,933 --> 01:34:12,733
No! No!

1019
01:35:46,533 --> 01:35:48,867
-Is it over?
-I don't know.

1020
01:36:27,067 --> 01:36:28,100
Can you walk?

1021
01:36:30,967 --> 01:36:32,433
-I'm all right.
-Come on.

1022
01:36:33,033 --> 01:36:34,500
We have to find a way out.

1023
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,133
-Do you hear that?
-Yeah.

1024
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:57,800
This is it.

1025
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,400
They weren't just scanning people.

1026
01:37:06,633 --> 01:37:07,833
They're not just printouts.

1027
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:10,700
This is what's controlling them.

1028
01:37:12,733 --> 01:37:14,100
These are from real corpses.

1029
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:17,433
Each one is made from a real person.

1030
01:37:19,467 --> 01:37:20,500
They're alive?

1031
01:37:21,633 --> 01:37:22,533
They're not alive.

1032
01:37:25,767 --> 01:37:26,700
They're not dead.

1033
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,500
They're just trapped somewhere in between.

1034
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:37,167
But they are in pain.

1035
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,967
How do you know?

1036
01:37:41,067 --> 01:37:42,433
This is pain.

1037
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,067
But how do you know they can feel?

1038
01:37:48,633 --> 01:37:49,667
I can't prove it.

1039
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,167
I can't.

1040
01:37:58,633 --> 01:38:00,833
So, maybe there are things
science can't answer.

1041
01:38:15,433 --> 01:38:16,133
No.

1042
01:38:16,867 --> 01:38:17,900
Wait, no.

1043
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,967
This is why we came here.

1044
01:38:21,967 --> 01:38:24,900
This is the evidence.
This is why you came, remember?

1045
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:28,633
Remember?
So many people have died. You said it.

1046
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:31,033
-You said, "I wanna know why."
-I know enough.

1047
01:38:32,767 --> 01:38:34,767
You have to think about
the bigger picture.

1048
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:38,567
I am.

1049
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:34,500
Help them off single file.

1050
01:39:35,667 --> 01:39:36,733
Got more coming in!

1051
01:39:37,733 --> 01:39:39,033
Put them in Unit 5.

1052
01:39:39,967 --> 01:39:42,100
- Over here. Over here.
- Watch his neck.

1053
01:39:42,167 --> 01:39:45,000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1054
01:39:53,433 --> 01:39:54,467
Give me your hand.

1055
01:39:58,933 --> 01:39:59,933
Right there, sir.

1056
01:40:00,767 --> 01:40:01,633
Welcome back.

1057
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,033
You okay?

1058
01:40:40,433 --> 01:40:41,433
New survey teams.

1059
01:40:41,867 --> 01:40:44,567
They're gonna take Masarov apart
piece by piece.

1060
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:46,500
Measure everything.

1061
01:40:48,067 --> 01:40:49,733
Try to reverse-engineer it.

1062
01:40:50,633 --> 01:40:51,767
Fight over ownership.

1063
01:40:53,067 --> 01:40:56,567
I've been asked if you wanna
go back out there. I said I'd ask, but...

1064
01:40:57,633 --> 01:40:58,900
I've seen what I came to see.

1065
01:41:16,933 --> 01:41:18,433
They don't stop, do they?

1066
01:41:19,433 --> 01:41:20,700
I don't think they know how.

1067
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:48,100
I told you you'd go home to Virginia
without unpacking.

1068
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,500
Delta Unit, move out.

1069
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:55,533
Thank you.

1070
