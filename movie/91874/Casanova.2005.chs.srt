1
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,169
万页之书
10,000 pages.

2
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,703
写就了我的一生和爱恋
My life and loves.

3
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,307
差不多每页都有一个女人
That's just about one woman for every page.

4
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,438
天啊  我好累
God, I'm tired.

5
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,646
但是有个故事我还没有写下
But there is one story I haven't put down.

6
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,292
弗朗西丝卡
Francesca.

7
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,250
其实这不是我的故事
That's a story which isn't mine to tell, really.

8
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,585
所以  别告诉其他人
So keep it to yourself.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,164
-要多久  -我不知道要多久
-For how long? -I don't know how long.

10
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,214
-那是个男人  而你只是个妓女  -我是演员
-It's a man, and you're a whore. -I'm an actress.

11
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,608
有什么区别  
What's the difference?

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,408
贾柯莫
Giacomo.

13
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,038
听你外婆的话
You be good for your grandmother.

14
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,104
-你知道我非常爱你  -妈妈
-Now, you know I love you very much. -Mama.

15
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,484
听我说  看那里
Listen to me. Look out there.

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,216
有一天你会回到威尼斯的
Know one day you'll come back to Venice

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,052
而我会回来找你
and I'll return for you.

18
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,509
我保证
I promise.

19
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,262
我保证
I promise.

20
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:25,688
她是说等我死了以后
She means when I am dead.

21
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:33,147
这不是她的错  这是家族的遗传
It's not her fault. It's in the blood.

22
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:37,786
爱情的热力  无法抵挡
Aheatforlove. Irresistible.

23
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,330
无法抵挡
Irresistible.

24
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:09,317
索非亚  我的爱人
Sophia, my love!.

25
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,322
是我丈夫
My husband.

26
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,194
你丈夫是威尼斯最幸运的人  他自己却不知道
Your husband is the luckiest man in Venice and doesn't know it.

27
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:58,276
更幸运的是他不在威尼斯  (威尼斯  1753年)
And it's lucky he's not in Venice.

28
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:02,830
亲爱的  我对你的爱不同寻常
Sweet darling, I love you like no other.

29
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:05,240
你让我梦想成真
You are my dreams come true.

30
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:08,288
求你了  再和我做爱吧
Please, please make love to me again.

31
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:13,086
卡萨诺瓦  告诉我我是你的唯一
Casanova, tell me I'm the only one.

32
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:16,129
(对女人)毫无疑问  (对观众)我总是这么说
Of course. I always do.

33
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,467
-亲爱的  我回来了  -是我丈夫
-Darling, I'm home!. -My husband!

34
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,895
我和卡萨诺瓦很熟  这太像他了
I know Casanova well. It's just like him.

35
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:32,482
-那个送冰块的来了吗  -来了
-Has the iceman come yet? -Yes.

36
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,942
他明天还会来
And hecomesagaintomorrow..

37
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,327
别信别人乱讲
Don't believe what people say.

38
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:45,746
我不是征服者  而是被征服者
I don't conquer. I submit.

39
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:50,827
作为情人我从没寻求过荣耀
I've never sought glory as a lover.

40
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:54,919
那  卡萨诺瓦先生  你寻求的是什么呢  
Well, what then, Signor Casanova, do you seek?

41
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:59,293
铭记终生的一刻
Amomentthatlastsa lifetime.

42
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:04,806
告诉我
So, tell me.

43
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:08,761
你所在的这个非同寻常的修女会
This unusual order of nuns you belong to.

44
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:12,805
戒律很严格吗  
Is it a very strict order?

45
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:19,275
非常严
Very. No

46
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:22,817
日落前不能戴首饰  着华服
jewels or nice clothes before sundown

47
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:25,319
回到自己小屋的时间不能超过  
and back in our cells by...

48
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:29,453
-天  这就到时间了  -你不一定要走
-Heavens! Is that the time? -You don't have to go.

49
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:31,535
我必须走  和你相处是很愉快  只是
I must. It's been delightful. Only...

50
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:34,250
只是
Only...

51
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:38,337
我怎么知道你真是卡萨诺瓦・
How do I know you're really Casanova?

52
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,254
(叫床  是的  是的  )
Yes! Yes!

53
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:44,344
卡萨诺瓦
Casanova.

54
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:47,220
-宗教裁判所的人来这抓你了  -不
-The lnquisition is here looking for you. -No.

55
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,888
请原谅我
Forgive me.

56
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,266
快走  如果他们抓住你  会吊死你的
Quick. If they catch you, they'll hang you.

57
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:59,113
贾柯莫  等等  对我说我是你的唯一
Giacomo, wait. Tell me I was the one.

58
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:01,190
你是我的唯一
You are the one.

59
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:11,494
-你不会忘记我的  对吧  -绝不会
-You won't forget me, will you? -No, I could never.

60
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:18,923
-卡萨诺瓦  给你  -谢谢
-Casanova. For you. -Thank you.

61
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:49,242
-卡萨诺瓦在哪  -我发过誓  
-Where is Casanova? -I've taken a vow of si...

62
00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:00,046
堕入永恒的诅咒  就为了和卡萨诺瓦春宵一度
Eternal damnation. For one night with Casanova.

63
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:03,920
挺公平的
Seems fair.

64
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:35,366
追到他了
We've got him.

65
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,745
快来
Come on.

66
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:57,179
当代很多值得尊敬的思想家  包括我  思考过这个问题
..hours of study by respected thinkers of our time, including myself.

67
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:00,188
对于这个话题  我并不守旧
I'm not old-fashioned in this matter.

68
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:05,400
我并不是说女人就只适合  操持家务或者生儿育女
I do not say a woman's place is at the hearth and in the bed.

69
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:09,024
我想说的是  当然那也是她们的职责所在
What I do say... Of course it is their place.

70
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:15,654
但我想说的是  让她们在家接受教育就好
What I do say is let them be educated at home.

71
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:18,157
在科学和哲学的高层研究上
On the higher planes of science and philosophy,

72
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:21,252
女人只会分我们的心
women serve only to distract us,

73
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:24,588
让我们屈从于世俗的享受
to bring us down to our earthly appetites.

74
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:30,464
所以我想说  绝不要让女人涉足这所大学
So I say no woman shall ever set foot inside this university.

75
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:35,346
现在请我的对手发言
Let my opponent take the floor.

76
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:40,681
有请来自帕多瓦的乔达诺博士
And nowDrGiordanoofpadua

77
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:46,987
-太迟了  先生们  -肃静  
-Too late, gentlemen. -Silence!

78
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:49,859
我会让你们看到  谁把谁变世俗了
Let me show you who is bringing whom down to earth.

79
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:56,279
女人像空气  像火焰  轻巧而又有力
A woman is air and fire and lightness and strength.

80
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:59,124
好像这个小气囊一样
Like this little vessel

81
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:05,212
会直升天堂  如果不是被东西压住的话
that would rise up to heaven were it not held down by ballast -

82
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,297
这袋沙子
bags of sand.

83
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:10,135
正是死沉的男人  和他们装满沙子头脑的写照
The dead weight of men with their heads full of sand.

84
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,470
只有女人才会用玩具演示来辩驳
Only a woman would argue by this demonstration of a toy.

85
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:19,429
这没法贬低男人的崇高智慧  不然我就自食其言
It would never strike the superior intellect of a man, or I'll eat my words.

86
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:24,230
那就把这些稿子吃下去吧  先生  这些可是哲学家贝纳多・瓜尔迪的话
Eat these briefs, signor, for these are the words of the philosopher Bernardo Guardi,

87
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:26,476
据称他就住在本城
who was said to live in this very city.

88
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,570
贝纳多・瓜尔迪  那个疯子
Bernardo Guardi. That madman.

89
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,360
坐等宗教裁判所来抓他
Wait until the lnquisition catches up with him.

90
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,194
你可以管他叫疯子
Call him a madman,

91
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:38,497
但他对女人的理解  比在坐的任何一位先生都深
but he has more understanding of women than any man in this room.

92
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:41,416
而且我打赌  他在床上肯定也比较受女人欢迎
And I'll wager he has better luck with them in bed as well.

93
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,043
妓女  
Strumpet.

94
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:45,334
他在那  在那边  
There he is! Over there!

95
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:52,796
拦住他  
Stop him!

96
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:07,483
抓住他  
Hold him!

97
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:17,156
先生们  抱歉了
Gentlemen, my apologies.

98
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:19,995
看到没  
You see?

99
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:22,750
死沉的男人
The dead weight of men.

100
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,585
但我不知道发生了什么  他  
But I didn't know what was happening. He...

101
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,662
他对我施了巫术
He bewitched me.

102
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:30,376
他说他是圣灵化身
He said he was the Holy Ghost.

103
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:34,462
而且这以前就发生过
And it's happened before.

104
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:45,679
你被控以淫荡  私闯民宅  异端
You are charged with debauchery, trespass, heresy.

105
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:49,224
因为你与新信徒通奸  (第一年加入修女会的修女)
To wit: fornication with a novice.

106
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:51,026
这  她可算不上什么新手  (与新信徒是novice的两种意思)
Well, she was hardly a novice.

107
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:55,061
据此  处以缳首死刑  明晨执行
For which the punishment is death by hanging, tomorrow at dawn.

108
00:10:57,034 --> 00:11:01,411
这回崇拜你的那位大人物  可没法帮你了
And this time your admirers in high places won't be able to help you.

109
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:03,786
对不起  审判官大人  总督大人来了
Excuse me, lnquisitor. The doge.

110
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:06,246
德方索
Dalfonso.

111
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:10,752
王子殿下  我们刚刚还提到你
Prince, we were just talking about you.

112
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,120
什么风把您吹来了  
What brings you here?

113
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:15,834
-我对此非常关注  -您又非常关注  
-I have a special interest... -I have a special interest.

114
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:21,224
这次这个囚犯可是  因一位修女的作证而被定刑的
This time the prisoner has been condemned on the evidence of a nun.

115
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:25,057
我正是对你的证人非常关注
A special interest in your witness.

116
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:29,391
-比阿特丽丝修女  -我有话要和你说
-Sister Beatrice? -I need a word.

117
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:37,398
看在上帝份上  你知道她是谁吗  
For God's sake, don't you know who she is?

118
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:41,785
-谁  -劳勃斯塔红衣主教的侍从修女
-Who? -Cardinal Lopresta's mistress in waiting.

119
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,954
他要我替他护卫她的贞操
He entrusted me with safeguarding her virginity for him alone.

120
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,124
她今天就要去罗马了
She's leaving for Rome today.

121
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,910
你的证人是劳勃斯塔红衣主教的修女  比阿特丽丝
Your witness is Cardinal Lopresta's sister, Beatrice.

122
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:56,133
他的修女  哦  天啊  这些罗马人
His sister? Oh, God! Those Romans.

123
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:58,673
想想吧  德方索神父
Think about it, Father Dalfonso.

124
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:04,266
谁会因为将她扯到卡萨诺瓦的绯闻  而背上罪名呢  
Who's going to get the blame for dragging her into the Casanova affair?

125
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:07,102
仔细想想  别急
Take your time.

126
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:08,978
我  
Me?

127
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:18,442
卡萨诺瓦先生  这次似乎又认错人了
Signor Casanova, this seems to be another case of mistaken identity.

128
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:23,860
你自由了
You are free to go.

129
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:28,916
你知道我是你的朋友  但罗马教廷正在威胁我
You know I'm your friend, but I'm being threatened by Rome.

130
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,286
威尼斯已经被认为是个温床  
Venice, I'm afraid, is perceived as a hotbed of...

131
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:36,708
呃  一个大温床  
Well, as one enormous hot bed

132
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,545
在丝床单和床垫下面藏着的  是异端书籍  
with silk sheets and heretical books under the mattress.

133
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:47,261
这里的人已经被  物质享乐和无神论所征服  
The people here are given over to physical pleasure and scepticism.

134
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,235
别滥用我对你的同情  卡萨诺瓦
Do not abuse my sympathy for you, Casanova.

135
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,360
我要把你驱逐出威尼斯
I'm expelling you from Venice.

136
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:08,035
殿下  我只是喜欢美人  这没什么坏处吧
Your Excellency, I worship beauty. There's no harm in that, is there?

137
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,957
-到巴黎  伦敦去追求吧  -我不能离开威尼斯
-Worship it in Paris, London. -I can't leave Venice.

138
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:14,126
-为什么  -我在等人
-Why? -I'm waiting for someone.

139
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:19,087
-她可能会失约的  -不  她发誓说她有天会来的
-She may let you down. -No. She promised she'll come one day.

140
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:21,381
你不懂吗
You don't understand.

141
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:24,505
我把你驱逐出威尼斯是为了你好
I'm expelling you from Venice for your own good.

142
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,755
-除非  -除非什么  
-Unless... -Unless what?

143
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,305
除非你找到一位淑女为妻
Unless you find yourself a respectable wife.

144
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:32,180
良家淑女会给你提供保护
A good woman from a good family will give you protection.

145
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,267
妻子  
Awife?

146
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:38,598
很快就是狂欢节了  教廷会对这些风流韵事视而不见
It will soon be the time of Camevale when authority winks at our indiscretions.

147
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,861
-而到四旬斋时你就显得格外恶劣了  -但狂欢节没几天就到了
-You're bad enough during Lent. -But Carnival's in a few days.

148
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:45,731
那你最好就别浪费时间
You better not waste any more time then.

149
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,902
-同时  你得规规矩矩的  -找个妻子  
-Meanwhile, you're on good behaviour. -A wife?

150
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,988
-不能有丑闻  -结婚  
-No scandals,... -Getting married?

151
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,951
不能有决斗或是酒醉胡为
..duels, drunken escapades.

152
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,041
早安  鲁勃
Morning, Lupo.

153
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:07,719
-我们正在担心呢  -是该担心了
-We were worried about us. -You were right to be.

154
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:11,258
-我要结婚了  -恭喜啊  和谁  
-We're getting married. -Congratulations. To whom?

155
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:14,388
还不知道  有谁来找我吗  
Don't know yet. Any callers?

156
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,481
房东  裁缝  酒商  老债主
Landlord, tailor, wine merchant, usual creditors.

157
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,057
看看我们的样子  你整晚都去哪了  
Look at the state of us. Where have you been all night?

158
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,860
这简直像已经结婚了
It's like being married already.

159
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,445
能给我找件干净衣服吗  我们得去找个女人
Can you get me some fresh clothes? We have some shopping to do.

160
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:32,153
-莫蕾丽・德奥丝塔女伯爵  -不错  不错  哦  不行  她打鼾
-The Contessa Morelli-D'Aosta. -Yes, yes, yes. Oh, but, no, she snores.

161
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:36,197
对  我记得  那薇萝妮卡・卡斯特罗夫人  
Yes, I remember. Lady Veronique Costello.

162
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,456
-她太虔诚了  -对
-Heavenly. -Yeah.

163
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,878
-乌菲公爵夫人  -恩  不错
-Duchess of Urfe. -Yes.

164
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,796
-不过她是不是把她丈夫毒死了  -是吗  我不记得了
-But didn't she poison her husband? -Did she? I don't remember that.

165
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,337
啊  朱丽叶・笆拉曼特瑞
Ah, Giulietta Badalamente.

166
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,013
很遗憾  她还没有毒死她丈夫
Sadly, she hasn't poisoned her husband yet.

167
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,057
可能你该说说我们到底在找谁
Perhaps if we told us what we're looking for.

168
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,513
我不知道  要美丽的  端庄的
I don't know. Beauty, modesty.

169
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,227
-纯洁的  -又是这一套
-Purity. -All that.

170
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:14,111
鲁勃  我有个预感
Lupo. We have had a vision.

171
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,418
还在盯着你爱的处女  
Still spying on your virgin?

172
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,344
你不想法让她认识你的话  她不会往这边看的
She'll never look this way if you don't make yourself known.

173
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,133
这事已经弄得满城风雨了
The whole town's talking about it.

174
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,930
简直让人胆战心惊
It's just appalling.

175
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,716
你认为那些男人会喜欢听到  自己床上功夫不好吗  
You think those men liked hearing they're no good in bed?

176
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,267
如果他们想听那个  回家找他们老婆就行
If they wanted that, they'd go home to their wives.

177
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,273
弗朗西丝卡  傲慢的女人没有吸引力
Francesca, arrogance in a woman is not attractive.

178
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,849
她并不傲慢  她只是生气了
She's not arrogant. She's just angry.

179
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,233
-来点水果  先生  -别替你姐姐辩解
-Fruit, sir? -Don't defend your sister.

180
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,821
是真的  她知道她比多数男人都聪明
It's true. She knows she's smarter than most men,

181
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:54,028
因此男人要假装高她一等
which makes men pretend to be superior,

182
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,619
因此她就生气  因此她看起来就很傲慢
which makes her angry, which is seen as arrogance.

183
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,408
乔万尼  离窗户远点  我们的邻居认为你像只石像鬼
Giovanni, come away from the window. Our neighbours'll think you're a gargoyle.

184
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,373
不  维托利亚  放那边
No, Vittorio. Over there.

185
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,299
弗朗西丝卡  如你所知  这周十分重要  你有你的责任
Francesca, this is a very important week as you well know. You have responsibilities.

186
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,170
几天之后  拜你所赐  我就再也不会受穷了
In a few days, thanks to you, I won't be poor any more.

187
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,139
拜你父亲所赐
Much thanks to your father

188
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:21,136
他真有远见  把她许配给热那亚  最有钱的表亲的大儿子
who had the foresight to betroth her to his rich cousin's eldest son in Genoa.

189
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,358
看看这段  神秘异装癖现身大学  
Listen to this. "Mystery transvestite at university

190
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,566
推翻重力原理  
overturns laws of gravity,

191
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,646
凭空变出恶魔  
conjures devil from the air,

192
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,731
险些酿成火灾  
nearly starts fire."

193
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,610
天  他们哪怕能写一句实话也好啊
God. Can't they get anything right?

194
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:40,910
你该感恩不尽了  告诉你  我不会  让你在大学里再来这么一出闹剧
Be thankful. I told you I'd not permit another scandalous display at the university.

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,950
-这牵扯的事情太大了  -妈妈  我不想嫁给他
-There's too much at stake. -Mother, I don't want to marry him.

196
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:49,672
-求你了  嫁给他会毁了我的  -是吗  要是你不嫁  我就毁了
-Please. I'll be damned if I do. -Well, if you won't, I will.

197
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,008
很好笑啊  是不是  
That's funny, is it?

198
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,968
行啊  我反正已经毁了  守寡  无人问津
Well, I'm damned to be widowed and gathering dust.

199
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,885
妈妈
Mother.

200
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,846
算你厉害
Well done.

201
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,227
我知道你为什么对你未婚夫这样
I know why you're like this about your fiance.

202
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,474
-为什么怎样  -少来
-Why I'm like what? -Come on.

203
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,237
你总是偷偷溜出去
You're always slipping away in secret.

204
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,108
又这么瘦
And you're thin.

205
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,243
很明显你已经有秘密情人了
It's obvious you've already got a secret lover.

206
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,618
别乱说
Well, don't tell.

207
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,642
你好  送令爱一件小礼物
Hello. A gift for your daughter.

208
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,980
我不知道该说什么  谢谢你  很漂亮
I don't know what to say. Thank you. It's magnificent.

209
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,984
但是你不认识小女  她也不认识你啊
But you don't know my daughter and she doesn't know you.

210
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,560
是的  但是我知道她名声不错  德那多先生
Yes. But I know her reputation, Signor Donato.

211
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,193
你可是声名远播啊  卡萨诺瓦先生
And everybody knows yours, Signor Casanova.

212
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,070
我一直在猜你长什么样
I've always wondered what you look like.

213
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,197
很普通嘛  我看
Quite ordinary, I can see that.

214
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,124
呃  我该怎么说呢  
Well, how can I put this?

215
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:09,123
维多利亚算是稀世珍品了  一位威尼斯处女
Victoria is that rare thing -a Venetian virgin.

216
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:12,581
是的  曾经耳闻  但最终注定要  
Yes, one hears of them, but invariably it turns out that...

217
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,589
对不起  请继续
I am sorry. Do go on.

218
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,134
谢谢  她过的是精心守护的生活
Thank you. She's led a very protected life.

219
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,678
从没有过邪念
Never has an impure thought crossed her mind.

220
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:22,798
当然  绝没有过
Of course not.

221
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:27,222
从不曾和男人独处一室  甚至没有见过不穿外衣的男人
She's never been alone in a room with a man, or even seen a man without his coat.

222
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,891
我担保
I've made sure of that.

223
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,932
为了保护她快乐单纯  我什么都可以做
There isn't anything I wouldn't do to ensure her happy innocence.

224
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,860
-她应该做修女  可惜  -上天不许
-She should be in a nunnery, but... -Heaven forbid.

225
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,984
-没错  人人都听过啊  -是的
-Exactly. One hears things. -Yes.

226
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:44,074
另一方面呢  你  卡萨诺瓦先生
On the other hand, there is you, Signor Casanova,

227
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,034
威尼斯最有名的浪子
the most notorious lover of women in Venice,

228
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:51,336
以阅女无数而知名
reputed to have the longest list of conquests ever known.

229
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,121
亲密爱抚的高手
Avirtuosoofthe intimatecatess.

230
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:57,292
脚踏几条船的大师
The maestro of multiple...

231
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:02,972
-这是怎么回事  -我会爱她的  德那多先生
-What was that? -I will come to love her, Signor Donato.

232
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:06,426
不可能  你对爱的感觉只是色情
It's out of the question. Your idea of love is sensuality,

233
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,731
只是将女人诱入陷阱  
to reduce women to quivering puddles of...

234
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,649
维多利亚  
Victoria!

235
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:15,688
你没事吧  
Are you all right?

236
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:19,278
我想要他  我想要他  求你了  爸爸
I want him. I want him. Please, please, Papa.

237
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:21,488
没有他我不会快乐的
I'll never be happy without him.

238
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:52,185
-恭喜  订婚成功  -真是奇迹
-Congratulations. We're engaged. -We are a marvel.

239
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:56,021
-我是说  真要结婚  -是的
-I mean, actually getting married? -Yes.

240
00:19:56,986 --> 00:20:00,070
你玷污了我的手套
You have sullied my glove.

241
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:03,073
我是说  我的至爱  (与手套发音类似)
I mean, love. My love.

242
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,242
-我没听清  他刚才说我们什么  -我们没有玷污它  它自己突然飞出来的
-I'm sorry. What did he just call us? -We didn't sully it. It came out of nowhere.

243
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,865
谢谢  你玷污了我的至爱
Thank you. You've sullied my love.

244
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,584
维多利亚・德那多是我的未婚妻
Victoria Donato is my fiancee.

245
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:15,128
-是吗  -是的
-Is she? -Yes.

246
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:19,542
-因为我会娶她的  -啊  可是她从没提起过
-In the sense that I'm going to marry her. -Well, she never mentioned that.

247
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,756
当然她不会提起  我还没问过她
Of course she didn't. I haven't asked her yet.

248
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:25,837
怎么  
Wha...?

249
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,055
给你  先生
Here, sir.

250
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:33,228
怎么回事  你们两个串通一气啊  鲁勃
What, are you two working together now? Lupo.

251
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:34,973
凌晨在圣克雷蒙尼
San Cremori at dawn.

252
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:37,603
听着  我们拒绝和你战斗  尊敬的先生
Listen. We decline to fight you, dear sir.

253
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:40,528
-你这个懦夫  -我们碰巧要奉公守法
-You coward. -We happen to be on good behaviour.

254
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:43,613
你要保护自己的荣誉  你无权拒绝
You have no right to decline to defend your honour.

255
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:45,407
既然是我们的荣誉  我们就有权
It's our honour, so we have the right.

256
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:48,197
被丢手套的有权  这是规矩  (丢手套表示要求决斗  另一方可以拒绝)
He who gets slapped has his rights. Those are the rules.

257
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:49,864
听到没  
See?

258
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:55,330
-你干这个干什么  -我不知道
-Now, what did we do that for? -I don't know.

259
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:57,878
凌晨在圣克雷蒙尼
San Cremori at dawn.

260
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:00,335
我可以知道我有幸干掉是谁吗  
May I know of whom I have the honour to be killing?

261
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,915
鲁勃・萨尔瓦多
Lupo Salvato.

262
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,883
谢谢
Thank you.

263
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,090
-别忘了你的手套  -谢谢
-Don't forget your glove. -Thank you.

264
00:21:08,181 --> 00:21:10,090
我们肯定不会想要  
Surely we don't mean...

265
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:14,311
什么  我们  你丢手套给他  你去和他打
What's this "we"? You slapped him. You fight him.

266
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:29,693
你怎么不笑
I see you're not laughing now.

267
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:45,298
来啊  
Come on!

268
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:53,845
这苹果太让人分心
The apple is very distracting.

269
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:57,019
没问题  我和他打
It's all right. I'll fight him.

270
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:59,512
我来当鲁勃・萨尔瓦多
I can be Lupo Salvato.

271
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:03,358
混蛋  
Bastard!

272
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:13,150
萨尔瓦多先生
Signor Salvato.

273
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:16,239
哦  天啊
Oh, dear.

274
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:23,332
这位先生是来解释决斗规则  和监督决斗公平的
This gentleman is here to explain the terms of the duel and to see fair play.

275
00:22:23,423 --> 00:22:26,258
-很好  -请注意  先生们
-Very good. -Your attention, please, gentlemen.

276
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:29,628
待在线后  直到我发令
Stay behind the line until I give the word.

277
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,928
如果有人跌倒  另一方要举起自己的剑  直到我说继续
If one trips or falls, the other puts up his sword until I say "continue".

278
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:36,013
好
Yes.

279
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:39,934
如果剑断了  你的助手递给你备用剑
If a sword breaks, your second hands you the spare sword.

280
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:42,311
-我们有备用剑吗  -有
-Do we have a spare sword? -Yeah, we do.

281
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,317
点到为止
First blood ends the duel.

282
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:15,258
主人  
Master!

283
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:41,617
走开
Move. Go on.

284
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:47,581
主人  
Master!

285
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,458
偷梁换柱的老把戏
It's the old switch game.

286
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:08,356
你会杀了他的
You'd have killed him.

287
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:10,851
而你是  
And you are?

288
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:14,528
弗朗西丝卡・布鲁尼  他是我弟弟
Francesca Bruni. He's my brother.

289
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,948
-我来拿这个  先生  -对不起  萨尔瓦多先生
-I'll take that, sir. -Sorry, Signor Salvato.

290
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:21,706
我认为你确实该道歉
I should think you would be sorry.

291
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:26,116
-全是误会  -误会
-It was all a case of mistaken identity. -Mistaken identity?

292
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:30,078
乔万尼以为你在追求德那多小姐
Giovanni got it into his head you were courting Signorina Donato.

293
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:32,166
-是吗  -这已经传遍全城了
-Did he? -It's all over Venice.

294
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:36,208
有名的处女维多利亚・德那多  要嫁给臭名卓著的浪子卡萨诺瓦
The famously virginal Victoria Donato is gonna marry the infamous rake, Casanova.

295
00:24:36,304 --> 00:24:39,258
-你认识他吗  -卡萨诺瓦  那个哲学家
-Do you know him? -Casanova. The philosopher,

296
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:42,848
一生都在寻求完美经历的那个  是的我认识他
who devotes his life to the perfection of experience? Yes, I know him.

297
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:46,269
不  浪子卡萨诺瓦  一生都在引诱女人的家伙
No. Casanova the libertine who devotes his life to seducing women.

298
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:50,484
很明显我们说的是一个人嘛
Well, we're obviously talking about the same person.

299
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:54,103
男人那么做是大错特错  你不认为吗  
There must be something deeply wrong with a man like that, don't you think?

300
00:24:54,197 --> 00:24:58,195
他的人生缺少点什么  真爱吧  可能是
Something missing in his life. True love, perhaps.

301
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:01,120
爱都是真的  只是方式不同
All love is true in different ways.

302
00:25:01,204 --> 00:25:06,364
说  我假爱  如同说  我假信  根本没法自圆其说
To say "l love falsely" is as self-contradictory as saying "l believe falsely".

303
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:10,996
你也是哲学家
You are a philosopher, too.

304
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,794
我花了无数时间和卡萨诺瓦待在一起
I've spent countless hours alone with Casanova,

305
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:18,130
思考爱的方式  思考和天使相爱会让我们怎样
pondering the ways of love and how it makes us at one with the angels.

306
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:19,549
恐怕还有和野兽相爱吧
Andwiththe beasts.

307
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:22,308
要是你站在那个家伙一边  我不会和你争论的
I will not debate with you if you take the side of a man

308
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:26,092
那家伙的爱就是要每天牺牲一个女人
whose idea of love demands a female sacrifice every day.

309
00:25:26,187 --> 00:25:32,023
对于把自己当玩物一样看待的女人  我也毫不同情
I've no sympathy for women who think no better of themselves than to be a plaything.

310
00:25:34,195 --> 00:25:38,987
你告诉你的朋友说我说的  他幻想的爱只是自恋
You tell your friend from me that what he imagines to be love is, in fact, self-love.

311
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:41,945
自恋就是自疑
And self-love isself-doubt.

312
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:43,578
-说的不错  -当然
-Well said. -Yes.

313
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:47,197
这是哲学家贝纳多・瓜尔迪的话  你该读读他的书  萨尔瓦多先生
By the philosopher Bernardo Guardi. You should read him, Signor Salvato.

314
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,913
-当然  -给我一个真正的男人吧
-Clearly. -Give me a man who is man enough

315
00:25:50,002 --> 00:25:53,751
除了配的上自己的那个女人  不会沾花惹草的男人
to give himself just to the woman who is worth him.

316
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,382
如果那个女人是我的话  我也会只爱他一个  一生一世
If that woman were me, I would love him alone and forever.

317
00:26:18,322 --> 00:26:20,694
再见  萨尔瓦多先生
Goodbye, Signor Salvato.

318
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:25,244
如果这场战斗继续下去  我们之中的一个一定会歉疚不已的
If fighting continued, one of us would have had good cause to be sorry.

319
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:28,576
还站着的那个  我想
The one still standing, I think.

320
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:38,414
弗朗西丝卡・布鲁尼
Francesca Bruni.

321
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,797
-把我的钱给我  -下星期  绝不赖账
-I want my money! -Next week, without fail.

322
00:26:40,886 --> 00:26:43,211
-你上周就这么说的  -我说早了一个星期
-You said that last week! -I was a week early.

323
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:46,223
-下地狱去吧  -我会在那见到你的  多谢
-Go to hell. -I'll see you there. Thank you so much.

324
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:50,222
这个神经病
Honestly. Why, the nerve!

325
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:53,432
你能相信这个人吗  我是说  
Can you believe this man? I mean

326
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:56,938
他知道我们是什么人吗  
does he know who we are?

327
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,190
像我们这样的人欠他的钱  他该感到荣幸才对
He should be honoured to be owed money by the likes of us.

328
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:04,282
-鲁勃  -干什么  
-Lupo. -What?

329
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:08,200
我犯了个大错
I've made a terrible mistake.

330
00:27:09,915 --> 00:27:12,322
-真的  -是的
-You have? -Yes.

331
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:14,410
我得找到她
I have to find her.

332
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:28,222
主人  我有点不懂
Master, I'm a little confused.

333
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:31,095
-我还以为我们已经做出了决定  -是的  我知道
-I thought we'd made our decision. -Yes, I know.

334
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:39,149
弗朗西丝卡  他明天就来了
Francesca! He's arriving tomorrow.

335
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,358
你的未婚夫
Your fiance.

336
00:27:42,322 --> 00:27:44,279
她有未婚夫了
She has a fiance.

337
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:47,735
你还不是一样
Well, so do you.

338
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:51,161
-乔万尼  -日安  玛里欧  你好吗  
-Giovanni. -Good day, Mario. How are you?

339
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:56,999
-对不起  -乔万尼  真丢脸
-I'm sorry. -Giovanni, more disgrace.

340
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,420
-让我来吧  -谢谢你  对不起
-Allow me. -Thank you. I'm sorry.

341
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,419
妈妈  这位是萨尔瓦多先生
Mama, this is Signor Salvato.

342
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:11,173
我知道今早小儿和您之间有些不愉快
I understand you've had an unpleasant encounter with my son this morning.

343
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:15,894
哦  那和晨练差不了太多
It was nothing more strenuous than a morning's constitutional.

344
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:19,182
过来
Come along.

345
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:22,360
抱歉
Sorry.

346
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:25,481
-你姐姐有未婚夫了  -他爱上卡萨诺瓦了
-Your sister has a fiance? -She's in love with Casanova.

347
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:27,780
-谁  -维多利亚
-Who is? -Victoria.

348
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:29,527
-我的至爱  记得吗  -啊  是的
-My love. Remember? -Oh, yes.

349
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,620
-和卡萨诺瓦订了婚  -是的
-Engaged to Casanova. -Yes.

350
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:35,196
这个嘛  你得用他的方式击败他
Well, you'll have to beat him at his own game.

351
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:39,075
可是怎么击败  我面对的可是世界级的色情骗子啊
But how? I'm up against a world-class seducer.

352
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,503
-嗨  -那  卡萨诺瓦会怎么做呢  
-Hello. -So? What would Casanova do?

353
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:49,045
-我不知道  卡萨诺瓦会怎么做  -首先  他不会闷闷不乐
-I don't know. What would Casanova do? -Well, to start, he wouldn't mope around.

354
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:51,629
-我猜他也不会  -整天苦恼很没有吸引力
-No, I suppose not. -Misery is not attractive.

355
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:54,345
如果你希望被人爱  那你要先值得人家爱你
If you want to be loved, you have to be worth loving.

356
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:58,184
这是最重要的  其次
That's the first rule. And second

357
00:28:58,272 --> 00:29:01,273
要当火  不要当扑火的飞蛾
be the flame, not the moth.

358
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,110
-当火  不当扑火的飞蛾  -是的
-The flame, not the moth. -Yes.

359
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:07,687
那是我的声调  挺吵的
It's my tongue. Got very loud.

360
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:12,117
对了  你姐姐  她和她的新未婚夫相处的还好吗  
So, your sister, is she happy with this new fiance of hers?

361
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:14,361
她从来没见过他
No. She's never met him.

362
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:17,622
-真的  -此外  她还有个秘密情人
-Really? -Besides, she has a secret lover.

363
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:23,660
-一个秘密情人  -是的
-A secret lover? -Yeah.

364
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:28,419
-是谁  -我不知道  那是个秘密
-Who? -Well, I don't know. It's a secret.

365
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:32,844
总之  她经常偷遛出去  看  
Anyway, she's always sneaking off in the... See?

366
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:34,924
对不起
I'm sorry.

367
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,782
鲁勃  她在那
Lupo, there she is.

368
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:04,289
卡萨诺瓦
Casanova.

369
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,793
我们正在置办维多利亚的嫁妆
We are buying Victoria's trousseau.

370
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:12,627
离婚礼只有三天了
Only three days to go before the wedding.

371
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:18,385
卡萨诺瓦
Casanova.

372
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:23,139
婚礼前不能有什么交往  我可是很传统的
No intercourse before the wedding. I'm a traditionalist.

373
00:30:24,316 --> 00:30:27,317
当然  我说的是社会交往  (intercourse也有性交的意思)
I mean social intercourse, of course.

374
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:30,186
波罗  波罗  让我们下去
Paolo. Paolo, let us off.

375
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:53,546
一个秘密情人
Asecretlover.

376
00:30:56,932 --> 00:30:59,387
他肯定要把她折腾死
He's going to bang her to pieces.

377
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,230
这是从罗马来的
From Rome.

378
00:31:06,316 --> 00:31:08,985
审判官办公室  
The lnquisitor's office.

379
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:12,402
就是一个充满了异端和通奸的泥坑  
"A cesspit of heresy and fornication."

380
00:31:12,488 --> 00:31:15,240
当然不是  哦  他们是说我们
Surely not... Oh, they mean us.

381
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:21,696
127个控诉  都是针对卡萨诺瓦先生的  我们了解他吗  
1 27 complaints against Signor Casanova. Do we know him?

382
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:27,246
你会发现这位可疑的卡萨诺瓦  正在享受这个办公室的保护
You'll see there are suspicions Casanova enjoys the protection of this very office.

383
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:29,163
这简直是  
That's absolutely rid...

384
00:31:36,137 --> 00:31:38,972
不是他死就是我亡
It's either his neck or it's ours.

385
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:43,925
那最好是他死  把我的笔记本拿来
It better be his. Get me my notebook.

386
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,293
哦  天啊
Oh, dear.

387
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:28,647
她把他彻底榨干了
She's completely worn him out.

388
00:32:36,196 --> 00:32:38,189
我找到他的名字了
I found his name.

389
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,568
他是个作家
He's a writer.

390
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:44,704
女人的征服  贝纳多・瓜尔迪着
"The Subjugation of Women by Bernardo Guardi."

391
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:49,201
怪不得  他已经进入了她的脑中和心中
No wonder. He's entered her head and her heart as well.

392
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:53,622
我们处在男权至上的迷雾中  结果怎样呢  
"Here we live in the midst of masculine domination and what be the result?"

393
00:32:53,714 --> 00:32:56,086
半数的人类将不会快乐  
"Half the population is missing from the feast?"

394
00:32:56,175 --> 00:33:01,216
资产和权利与你无缘  对那些你甚至无法置评  
"You have no right to property and government, nay, not an opinion...

395
00:33:01,305 --> 00:33:05,137
如果有个男人想要让女人爱他  
"lf ever a man wants to have a woman fall in love with him,

396
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:08,725
他只需要说  
all he need to say...

397
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,858
他只需要说  
"All he need to say is,

398
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:17,270
一直都是我在说  你的  
'l have too long dominated the conversation. What are..."'

399
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,482
你对此有什么想法  
..your thoughts on the matter? What are your thoughts?

400
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:23,409
-肉  我可是裁缝  -没错  请原谅
-Meat? I'm the tailor! -So you are. Forgive me.

401
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:24,904
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

402
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:28,198
你对此有什么想法  
What are... What are your thoughts on the matter?

403
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,697
我有什么想法  这个嘛  我想说  
My thoughts? Well, I'd say...

404
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:34,078
不  鲁勃  给我弄杯茶来好吗  
No, Lupo. I'm... Could I have some tea?

405
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:35,369
当然
Of course.

406
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:39,046
妈妈  我的未婚夫明早就要来了  我该怎么做  
Mother, my fiance is turning up tomorrow. What shall I do?

407
00:33:38,134 --> 00:33:41,340
简单  尽你的责任
It's simple. Do your duty.

408
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:46,054
难道嫁给一个我不认识的男人  仅仅因为他有钱  就是我的责任  
Is it my duty to marry a man that I don't know just because he's rich?

409
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:50,388
是的  你对你父亲的责任  他可是为了你好
Yes, it is. Your duty to your father who had your best interest at heart.

410
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:54,179
婚姻只是个避风港  亲爱的
Marriage is a safe haven, my darling.

411
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:56,599
那爱情呢  
And love?

412
00:33:56,693 --> 00:33:58,686
爱情  
Love?

413
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:02,610
爱情就是另外的东西了
Love is something else.

414
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:07,405
就好像每天的天气都不错
It's the weather being good every day,

415
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:12,323
因为风风雨雨  也不过是另外一种好天气
because wind and rain are just another kind of good weather.

416
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,038
这就是爱
That's love.

417
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:18,082
可能当你见到他时  你就会爱上你的丈夫的
Perhaps when you see him, you'll fall in love with your husband.

418
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:21,126
他还不是我丈夫呢
He's not my husband yet.

419
00:34:21,217 --> 00:34:25,345
如果你不遵从你父亲的愿望  我们就要继续在债务中度日
If you go against your father's wishes, we'll continue living in debt,

420
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,051
靠债主的怜悯过活
at the mercy of everyone we owe.

421
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:30,762
-但是如果你履行这个婚约  -是合同
-But if you honour the betrothal... -The contract.

422
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:33,521
是婚约
The betrothal

423
00:34:34,063 --> 00:34:36,685
那我们的苦日子就结束了
then our troubles will be over.

424
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:43,435
自己凭良心想想吧
It's between you and your conscience.

425
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,256
阿门
Amen.

426
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:17,183
-萨尔瓦多先生  -我来此是来忏悔的
-Signor Salvato. -I do come here to make confession.

427
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:20,724
-你做了什么  -你是说我忏悔什么  
-What are you doing? -What am I here to confess?

428
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,653
恩  想想看
Well, let's see.

429
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:26,359
嫉妒
Jealousy.

430
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,406
骄傲
Pride.

431
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:32,324
贪婪
Covetousness.

432
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:34,405
绝望
Despair.

433
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,951
你呢  
And you?

434
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:43,837
我是来做结婚的心理准备的
I came to prepare my soul for marriage.

435
00:35:52,766 --> 00:35:55,222
你看起来很苦恼  布鲁尼小姐
You're troubled, Signorina Bruni.

436
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,474
你可能认为我的苦恼只是小事一桩  先生  但我是受不了了
My troubles are nothing to you, signor, and little enough to me.

437
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:01,522
在婚约中被卖掉可不算小事
To be bartered in marriage is no small thing,

438
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:04,230
尤其是对一个有独立主见的女人
especially for a woman of independent mind.

439
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:08,862
看来我弟弟又在乱说话了  将来他就得自己去对付他的决斗了
I see my brother's tongue wags again. In future he can fight his own duels.

440
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:11,784
-你不能进来  -没关系的  我是医生
-You can't come in. -It's all right. I'm a doctor.

441
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,363
你不是卡萨诺瓦  
You're not Casanova?

442
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:15,944
我是的  我能证明  只要你让我看看你的胸部
No. I can prove it if you'll show me your chest.

443
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:19,325
-你经常去教堂吗  -我是在跟踪你
-Are you often in church? -I followed you.

444
00:36:20,419 --> 00:36:24,167
对你的朋友卡萨诺瓦来说  未婚妻会让追求更有味道
Surely it is your friend Casanova for whom fiancees add spice to the pursuit.

445
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:26,747
如果你认识他  你不会这么急着谴责他的
If you knew him, you wouldn't be so quick to condemn him.

446
00:36:26,842 --> 00:36:30,045
如果你了解女人  你不会这么急着要替他辩护的
If you understood women, you would not be so quick to defend him.

447
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:34,549
爱情不是一天两天  或者一周两周的事情
Love is not an affair of a night or a fortnight.

448
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:39,350
真爱也不会因为情人的数目而变得更真  而只会逐渐消失
And true love doesn't grow with the number of lovers. It wastes away.

449
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:42,142
-你的工具在哪  -我马上就拿出来
-Where's your instrument? -I'll get it out in a minute.

450
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:45,399
但你不能批评那些  随时随地寻找爱情的人啊
But you can't blame those who seek love wherever they can.

451
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:50,859
可能那只是肉体的欢愉  而非心灵的悸动
Perhaps it's merely the murmur of the flesh that hasn't known the flutter of the heart,

452
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:53,736
只在一个晚上有意义  而不是一生
meant for an evening but not a lifetime.

453
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:57,160
但这就不能是一样的爱吗  
But can't that still be love all the same?

454
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:59,952
看起来你好像想诱惑我啊  萨尔瓦多先生
It seems you're trying to woo me, Signor Salvato,

455
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,532
让我在你的床上占一席之地
by offering to make me a notch on your bedpost.

456
00:37:02,627 --> 00:37:06,839
别这样  我们只是在讨论卡萨诺瓦  我和他不同
Come now, we are speaking of Casanova, and I am a different man.

457
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:10,506
你看  卡萨诺瓦无法理解
You see, Casanova couldn't understand

458
00:37:10,593 --> 00:37:14,176
尽管各种爱的方式都是真的
that of all the ways love can be true, there...

459
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:16,671
但有种方式与众不同
there is one way.

460
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:23,142
有种方式胜过其他的一切方式
And that way is the sum of all the others.

461
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,116
一直都是我在说
Now, I've too long dominated the conversation.

462
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:41,158
你对此有什么想法  
What are your thoughts on the matter?

463
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:46,712
-你刚才说什么  -什么
-What did you just say? -What?

464
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:08,317
-我很痛苦  -我很忙
-I'm in hell. -I'm busy.

465
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:11,900
又在给你的情人写信  要是我是你  就告诉他都结束了
Another note to your lover? I'd tell him it's all over if I was you.

466
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:14,526
滚  我要嫁给派普齐奥了
Go away. I'm marrying Papprizzio.

467
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:19,785
-我做什么了  -有人来过了
-What did I do? -Somebody came here

468
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,492
有人要在出版前看看你最新的作品
who wanted to read your latest pamphlet before publication.

469
00:38:22,581 --> 00:38:24,455
-什么  -你有没有给人看我的作品  
-What? -Did you show someone my work?

470
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:29,168
我什么都没给人看  看在你父亲的份上  我可是对他忠心耿耿
I didn't show anyone anything, on the memory of your father, whom I served well.

471
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:31,128
直到他因为你偷窃而开除你吧
Until he fired you for stealing.

472
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,208
-手稿在哪  -我把他们交给印刷商了  和过去一样
-Where's the manuscript? -I took it to the printer's like I always do.

473
00:38:35,302 --> 00:38:38,387
你写作  我以我的名义印刷出版  我拿佣金
You write, I get it printed under my name, I take the commission.

474
00:38:38,472 --> 00:38:42,055
人人都很满意  除了牧师以外
Everyone's happy except the priests.

475
00:38:42,142 --> 00:38:45,761
-这些是新鞋  瓜尔迪  -教堂给我的  不过不合脚
-These new shoes, Guardi? -Church gave them to me. They don't fit.

476
00:38:45,854 --> 00:38:47,183
别撒谎
Don't lie.

477
00:38:47,273 --> 00:38:50,190
我给第五页又写了一段  拿到印刷商那去
This is an addition to page five. Take it to the printer's.

478
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:54,569
没人来过  没人贿赂过我  要是有过的话  我还会这么不清醒吗  
Nobody came. Nobody bribed me. Would I be sober if they had?

479
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:03,162
就是他
That's him.

480
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:22,845
-这个  把这个加到第一章  -谢谢
-Here. Add this to chapter one. -Thank you.

481
00:39:35,946 --> 00:39:38,486
瓜尔迪  


482
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,446
瓜尔迪说  为什么女人要束缚自己  不敢展现自然的体态  
Guardi says, "Why should women lace themselves out of their natural shape?"

483
00:39:43,537 --> 00:39:46,158
-卡萨诺瓦  -小姐
-Casanova. -Signorina.

484
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:48,869
我的窗户是开的
I left my window open.

485
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:52,659
亲爱的  我有太多窗户  太少时间了
My darling, I have so many windows and so little time.

486
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,630
烧毁束身胸衣
Burn our corsets.

487
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,361
-你在干什么  -对不起  请原谅  我不是故意的
-What are you doing? -Sorry. Forgive me. It was an involuntary...

488
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:19,153
请让我帮你
Please let me help you.

489
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:22,857
加在第五页上  每个女人的心中都有宠物的空间  
"ln the heart of every woman, there is room for a pet."

490
00:40:22,951 --> 00:40:25,620
猫和狗能提供慰藉和关爱  
"Dogs and cats provide solace and affection."

491
00:40:25,704 --> 00:40:29,915
但有几个男人知道  留给当今妇女的宠物选择  
"How rare is the man who knows that the pet of choice for today's woman

492
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:34,910
只有聪明和高贵的猪了呢  
is the intelligent and noble pig!"

493
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,421
-猪  -我会赔偿损失  很多人给我捐钱
-A pig? -I'll pay for the damage. I'm well-endowed.

494
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,630
如果你  对不起  那是个误会
If you get my... I'm sorry. That came out wrong.

495
00:40:57,151 --> 00:41:01,019
你可以告诉你的夫人  萨尔瓦多先生有礼物送来吗  
Will you tell your lady that Signor Salvato is here with a gift?

496
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:04,613
夫人说猪不能进来
My mistress says the pig cannot come in.

497
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,283
但小动物可以
But the animal we'll take.

498
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:39,043
你被解雇了


499
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:46,111
我有那未婚夫的消息了  他叫派普齐奥
I have news about the fiance. His name is Papprizzio.

500
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,201
是热那亚人  中午抵达
He's from Genoa. He's arriving at noon.

501
00:41:49,286 --> 00:41:51,078
很有钱
He's rich.

502
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:54,284
当然
Of course he is.

503
00:41:55,668 --> 00:41:59,748
最近什么事情都和我们作对  鲁勃
Everything's turning against us these days, Lupo.

504
00:42:03,717 --> 00:42:08,213
-我们欠了多少  -大概1500里拉
-How much do we owe? -About 1 500 lira.

505
00:42:12,184 --> 00:42:15,185
穿我们次好的衣服  鲁勃
Lay out our second-best suit, Lupo.

506
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:48,257
这是谁的船  
Who owns this tub?

507
00:42:49,763 --> 00:42:50,961
我
I do, sir.

508
00:42:51,056 --> 00:42:54,092
我是佩托・派普齐奥  热那亚商人
And I'm Pietro Papprizzio, merchant of Genoa.

509
00:42:54,184 --> 00:42:56,936
-你运的是什么  -猪油
-And what's your cargo? -Lard.

510
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,096
-猪油  -世上最好的
-Lard? -Finest in the world.

511
00:42:59,189 --> 00:43:02,190
-告诉他  佛里奥  告诉他  -遵命
-Tell him, Fulvio. Tell him. -Yes, sir.

512
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:04,149
一船猪油
Tub of lard.

513
00:43:04,236 --> 00:43:08,068
你是说你从未听说过我的猪油吗  我们得想法弥补这事
Do you mean to tell me you've never heard of my lard? We'll have to fix that.

514
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:14,444
明早我要看到这些海报张贴  在每条运河  街道
I want to see one of these posters on every canal, street, water corner by morning.

515
00:43:14,537 --> 00:43:16,329
-懂了吗  -在这签字
-Understand? -Sign here.

516
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,502
派普齐奥先生
Signor Papprizzio?

517
00:43:22,587 --> 00:43:26,419
-愿为您效劳  先生  -刚好相反  我要为您效劳
-At your service, sir. -On the contrary, I'm at yours.

518
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:30,920
我未婚妻一家派我来此欢迎您  带您去您的豪宅
The family of your fiancee sent me here to greet you and to send you to your palazzo.

519
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:34,595
豪宅  但我已经预约了  格拉法西旅馆的房间啊
But palazzo? I have a reservation at the Hotel Grifasi.

520
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:37,173
他们没告诉你吗  格拉法西旅馆已经关门了
They didn't tell you? The Grifasi is closed.

521
00:43:37,268 --> 00:43:39,095
-真的  为什么  -鲁勃  
-Really? Why? -Lupo.

522
00:43:39,187 --> 00:43:41,310
-湿度升高了  先生  -湿度升高  没错
-Rising damp, sir. -Rising damp, indeed.

523
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:45,098
豪宅  嗯  带路吧
Palazzo, eh? Well, lead on.

524
00:43:46,194 --> 00:43:52,279
-我的仆人会处理你的行李的  -我看你可以把一切都安排好
-My servant shall see to your baggage. -I think you have everything under control.

525
00:43:58,956 --> 00:44:01,282
我首先要做的
The first thing I'm going to do

526
00:44:01,376 --> 00:44:04,376
就是去拜访我的未婚妻
is call upon my betrothed

527
00:44:04,462 --> 00:44:07,831
当然要先让我看起来像模象样
after I make myself presentable, of course.

528
00:44:07,924 --> 00:44:10,675
好的  一般这要花多长时间  
Yes. And how long does that usually take?

529
00:44:11,636 --> 00:44:14,423
卡萨诺瓦买了一只猪  
"Casanova bought a pig."

530
00:44:14,514 --> 00:44:18,132
卡萨诺瓦把这只猪送到了布鲁尼家  
"Casanova took the pig to the Bruni house."

531
00:44:20,853 --> 00:44:23,309
清理干净  一样不留
Clear it. Everything.

532
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:35,322
我来拿那个
I'll take that.

533
00:44:38,913 --> 00:44:40,905
大人
Your Grace.

534
00:44:59,141 --> 00:45:03,803
德方索法官  我是普齐主教
Inquisitore Dalfonso, I am Bishop Pucci.

535
00:45:03,896 --> 00:45:06,184
哦  主教  
Oh, Bishop...

536
00:45:06,273 --> 00:45:09,891
我受命来此解除你在威尼斯的职务
I have been instructed to relieve you of your duties here in Venice.

537
00:45:09,985 --> 00:45:13,188
要是说教皇陛下对你进度不满
To say that the pope is less than happy with your rate of progress

538
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,151
那是太过于客气了
is an understatement of monumental proportions.

539
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:19,879
你和你的全部人马已经被调职了
You and your entire staff

540
00:45:19,974 --> 00:45:23,406
你们要去开辟一个新教区  为哪的土人服务来着  
have been reassigned to open a mission among the natives of

541
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:29,666
赤道地区
the equatorial region.

542
00:45:29,755 --> 00:45:32,246
什么样的土人  
What kind of natives?

543
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:38,177
我们这么说吧  他们怀着饥饿的心等待着宗教信仰
Let us just say, shall we, they have a great hunger for religion.

544
00:45:46,772 --> 00:45:50,390
就是说这个地方  属于浪子卡萨诺瓦啦  
So this place belonged to the libertine Casanova, eh?

545
00:45:50,484 --> 00:45:54,813
是的  但是他欠债太多  被赶出去了
Yes, but he ran out on his debts, so

546
00:45:54,905 --> 00:45:57,941
所以我们用很合理的价格  买下了这座别墅
we got the villa at a very reasonable price.

547
00:45:58,033 --> 00:46:00,191
真的  有多合理  
Really? How reasonable?

548
00:46:00,285 --> 00:46:01,530
鲁勃  
Lupo?

549
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,862
-1600里拉  -是的
-1,600 lira. -Yes.

550
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:08,830
-要拿到收据  -当然
-Get a receipt. -Of course.

551
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:14,877
我这1600里拉买回的地方有浴室吗  
Do I get a bath for my 1,600 lira?

552
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:19,213
卡萨诺瓦买了一只猪  
"Casanova bought a pig?"

553
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:23,384
卡萨诺瓦把这只猪送到了布鲁尼家  
"Casanova took pig to Bruni house."

554
00:46:23,475 --> 00:46:27,175
卡萨诺瓦在码头见了派普齐奥  
"Casanova met with Papprizzio at dockside."

555
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,019
把派普齐奥带回了他家  
"Took Papprizzio to his house."

556
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:36,231
这有谁能解释一下这是怎么回事吗  
Is there anybody here who can explain this?

557
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:39,939
你把他们都送去给土人吃了
You sent them all away to be eaten.

558
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:44,030
好吧  那我们只好自己干点跑腿的活了
Well, then we shall have to do some footwork ourselves.

559
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,200
派普齐奥  热那亚那个猪油大亨  
Papprizzio? The pork fat mogul from Genoa?

560
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:54,911
我们是来调查异端和淫乱的
We're here to discover heresy and criminal licentiousness.

561
00:46:55,006 --> 00:46:57,859
如果这里面竟然牵涉到了猪油大亨  我简直不敢想象
If there's bacon involved, I dread to imagine the depths of depravity

562
00:46:57,946 --> 00:47:01,250
我们在威尼斯能发现的  堕落程度有多深
we're going to find here in Venice.

563
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:05,178
我很惊奇  但是我对这个城市很有好感
I'm surprised, but I have a good feeling about this city.

564
00:47:05,266 --> 00:47:08,350
-是吗  -这里猪油的市场空间很大啊
-Do you? -There's a massive market for lard here,

565
00:47:08,436 --> 00:47:13,145
我打算用热那亚的老招数  打开这里的市场
and I plan to use a good old bit of Genoan know-how to penetrate it.

566
00:47:13,232 --> 00:47:16,399
-想法不错  -传单  报纸
-Good thinking. -Handbills, newspapers.

567
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:21,064
-这正是威尼斯缺少的  -英雄所见略同
-That's just what Venice is missing. -That's exactly what I was thinking.

568
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:25,451
-你得盯着那个仆人  -怎么了  他出去了
-You have to keep an eye for that servant. -What? He's gone out.

569
00:47:25,536 --> 00:47:29,320
-去哪了  -我怎么会知道  
-He's gone out where? -How am I supposed to know?

570
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:36,958
我为我的未婚妻准备了一点小装饰品  算是个小礼物吧
I've arranged a trinket for my beloved -a little wedding present for my bride-to-be.

571
00:47:37,048 --> 00:47:39,170
你们想不想先看看  
Would you like an advanced demonstration?

572
00:47:39,258 --> 00:47:40,836
当然
Yes, please.

573
00:47:47,224 --> 00:47:49,798
-真是  -太棒了  非常精美
-It's very... -That's wonderful. Exquisite.

574
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:52,729
-真的  -是啊
Really. Yeah.

575
00:47:52,813 --> 00:47:54,806
画的是谁  
Who is it?

576
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:18,995
是他吗  
Was that him?

577
00:48:19,548 --> 00:48:22,798
我怎么会知道  
How am I supposed to know that?

578
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:29,921
我们在找什么  
What are we looking for?

579
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,846
我不知道  某个东西  任何东西都可能
I don't know. Something. Anything.

580
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:34,889
《男权世界下女人的希望》  贝纳多・瓜尔迪著  第一版


581
00:48:34,938 --> 00:48:38,434
赠与佩托・派普齐奥  带着我的希望  弗朗西丝卡・布鲁尼  


582
00:48:45,073 --> 00:48:48,193
我找到他们家了  布鲁尼太太和她的女儿
I found the house, sir. Signora Bruni and her daughter

583
00:48:48,285 --> 00:48:52,365
邀请您去品茶
request the pleasure of your company for tea.

584
00:48:52,456 --> 00:48:54,413
很好
Good. Good.

585
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:58,164
就那件黄绿色的吧  佛里奥
The chartreuse then, I think, Fulvio.

586
00:48:58,253 --> 00:49:00,162
马上就来  主人
Right away, Master.

587
00:49:02,257 --> 00:49:07,382
我非常想见她
I'm certainly looking forward to seeing her.

588
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,629
希望她不会
Hope that she's

589
00:49:09,723 --> 00:49:11,715
对我感到失望
not disappointed by me.

590
00:49:12,476 --> 00:49:15,560
希望她不会认为我  我也不知道怎么说
Hope that she doesn't think I'm... I don't know.

591
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:19,773
那话怎么说来着  我想说什么来着  
What's the... What's the word? The expression I'm looking for?

592
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:23,523
-有点圆  -对不起  你刚才说什么  
-Rotund? -Excuse me. What did you say?

593
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:27,194
先生想要在喝茶前来点点心吗  
Would sir require a small snack before tea?

594
00:49:28,658 --> 00:49:33,450
你认为那圆鼓隆冬的像腊肠吗  
Well, do you see that trunk shaped vaguely like a salami?

595
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:36,741
-是的  -里面都是腊肠
-Yes. -It's filled with salami.

596
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:48,085
-哦  你们在这  -不错啊
-There you are. -Yes.

597
00:49:48,178 --> 00:49:51,463
-恩  非常好  -谢谢
-Now, very impressive. -Thank you.

598
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:55,055
-选这个莱檬色让你显得瘦了很多  -你太客气了
-The choice of lime is very slimming. -You're too kind.

599
00:49:55,143 --> 00:49:57,515
我得走了  我是不是还和别人有约啊  鲁勃  
I must be off. Didn't I have an appointment?

600
00:49:57,604 --> 00:49:59,228
什么  哦  出版商
What? Oh. The publisher.

601
00:49:59,314 --> 00:50:01,223
没错  我得看看我的新书卖的如何了
That was it. To see how my new book is doing.

602
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:02,514
你是个作家  
You're a writer.

603
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:04,934
-我的确有点写作的小名气  -很好
-I've been known to scribble a bit. -Bravo.

604
00:50:05,028 --> 00:50:08,610
我的主人是著名作家  善于描写爱情和如何取悦女人
My master's a famous writer of love and how to please ladies.

605
00:50:08,698 --> 00:50:10,489
你听说过贝纳多・瓜尔迪  
You've heard of Bernardo Guardi...

606
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:12,864
-鲁勃  小声点  -但他是朋友啊
-Lupo, hush. -But he's a friend.

607
00:50:12,952 --> 00:50:14,612
-对不起  -贝纳多・瓜尔迪  
-I'm so sorry. -Bernardo Guardi?

608
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:18,155
-我不敢相信  -对不起  我不是故意的
-I can't believe it. -I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

609
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:21,166
先生  您是贝纳多・瓜尔迪  
You, sir, are Bernardo Guardi?

610
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,541
那是我的笔名  但你一定要发誓保密
That's my nom de plume. But you must swear to tell no one.

611
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,169
我发誓  以我的荣誉起誓  先生
I swear. On my honour, sir.

612
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,471
我郑重起誓  贝纳多・瓜尔迪
My solemn vow. Bernardo Guardi.

613
00:50:34,974 --> 00:50:38,758
佛里奥  这得仔细考虑一下了
Fulvio, this will need some thinking about.

614
00:50:38,853 --> 00:50:41,688
是的  我非常荣幸  先生
Yes, it does. It's my great honour, sir.

615
00:50:44,233 --> 00:50:46,522
看着我
Look at me.

616
00:50:47,987 --> 00:50:49,185
我正在看呢
I am.

617
00:50:50,906 --> 00:50:52,484
再看看那个
Now look at that.

618
00:50:57,371 --> 00:51:00,123
是的  说实话  不是完全一样
Yes, in truth, it is not an exact likeness, no.

619
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:03,991
是的  在热那亚  我们管这叫广告
Yeah. In Genoa, we call it advertising.

620
00:51:04,086 --> 00:51:08,000
好吧  但这有什么用呢  如果她就是爱你这个人
Yes. Fine. But so what of it? If she loves you as you are...

621
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:10,916
她从未见过我
She's never seen me.

622
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,714
-一次都没有过  -真的  
-Not even a glimpse. -Really?

623
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:19,597
是的  天啊  瓜尔迪大师  求您指导一下我吧
Yes. Oh, dear, Master Guardi. Take me under your tutelage, I beg you.

624
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:23,303
我会付您一大笔钱的  不管您要多少  我都付
I'll pay you handsomely. Whatever you like, I'll pay it.

625
00:51:23,397 --> 00:51:24,891
你想让我教你  
You want me to tutor you?

626
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:28,730
我希望您让我脱胎换骨  脱胎换骨
I want you to transform me. Transform me.

627
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,069
亲爱的先生  可是你只有  不到一个小时就要见她了
My dear man, but you have but an hour until you must you meet her.

628
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:34,729
我不去  我不想去  你不能逼我去
I don't want to go. You can't make me go.

629
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,159
恰好  我还没出版的新书
As it happens, my new book, which isn't out yet,

630
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:42,121
是讲男人外表的
deals with the outer man.

631
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:49,249
你看  外表和内在的关系  还没什么人懂
You see, the relation between the physical and the spiritual is little understood.

632
00:51:51,216 --> 00:51:53,256
当然  除了我以外
Except by me, of course.

633
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:58,638
-瓜尔迪大师  -什么事  
-Master Guardi. -Yes?

634
00:51:58,724 --> 00:52:01,179
你能让我看起来和那个一样吗  
Can you make me look like that?

635
00:52:03,312 --> 00:52:04,936
-我可以  -哦  天啊
-Yes, I can. -Oh, God.

636
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:07,429
但那需要勇气和时间
But it will take courage. It will take time.

637
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,525
-要长时间待在这座别墅里  -勇气  是的
-Long confinement to this villa. -Courage. Yes.

638
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:13,148
-你懂吗  -我懂
-Do you understand? -I understand.

639
00:52:13,238 --> 00:52:17,105
佛里奥  我会让我的仆人佛里奥  去布鲁尼家送个信
Fulvio. I will send my servant Fulvio to the house of Bruni with a note.

640
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,534
-不需要  我会顺路去的  -哦  太好了
-No need. I will pass that way myself. -Oh, excellent.

641
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,111
我们能开始吗  我希望现在就开始
Can we start? I want to start right now.

642
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:24,202
鲁勃
Lupo.

643
00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:29,375
太可爱了
Lovely.

644
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:37,552
乔万尼  派普齐奥先生随时会来
Giovanni! Signor Papprizzio is expected at any moment.

645
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:45,685
萨尔瓦多先生到
Signor Salvato.

646
00:52:51,317 --> 00:52:55,315
维托利亚  告诉萨尔瓦多先生我不在家
Vittorio, tell Signor Salvato I am not at home.

647
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:59,610
啊  真奇怪  我肯定我接到邀请  来品茶啊
Now, how strange. I'm sure that I was invited to tea.

648
00:52:59,701 --> 00:53:03,034
-你  是吗  -我们不在品茶
-You were? -We're not having tea.

649
00:53:03,788 --> 00:53:06,077
请原谅  我不记得我邀请过你
Forgive me. I must have forgotten an invitation.

650
00:53:06,165 --> 00:53:11,242
-你告诉我的仆人了  -我们正在等弗朗西丝卡的未婚夫
-You told my servant, I believe. -We were expecting Francesca's fiance.

651
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:13,211
没错  我这不是来了吗
Indeed. And here he is.

652
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:19,720
女士们  请原谅  是时候表明我的真实身份了
Ladies, forgive me. It is time I presented myself under my true colours.

653
00:53:20,179 --> 00:53:22,552
布鲁尼小姐  我的名字不是萨尔瓦多
Signorina Bruni, my name is not Salvato.

654
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,551
你面前的人就是  你最忠实和幸运的未婚夫
You see before you your most devoted and fortunate fiance,

655
00:53:27,645 --> 00:53:31,643
佩托・派普齐奥  从热那亚一路来此
Pietro Papprizzio, all the way from Genoa.

656
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,268
派普齐奥先生
Signor Papprizzio.

657
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:42,612
我在热那亚那边碰到的年轻女人  在我面前都遮遮掩掩
All the young women I met back in Genoa concealed their true natures from me,

658
00:53:42,702 --> 00:53:46,236
害怕梦见一个猪肉帝国
dazzled by dreams of an empire of pork.

659
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:50,156
他们看到我就好像看到一座猪油山
They looked at me and they saw a mountain of lard.

660
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:52,078
不不不  一点也不像
No, no, no. Not at all.

661
00:53:52,169 --> 00:53:55,040
如果有什么的话  也是你需要胖点
If anything, you need fattening up.

662
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:58,215
我不喜欢瘦男人  弗朗西丝卡的父亲就很胖
I don't like thin men. Francesca's father was enormous.

663
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,761
不管怎样  我对我  未曾谋面的未婚妻保持了真诚
Nevertheless, I remained true to the fiancee that I'd never seen.

664
00:54:03,514 --> 00:54:08,555
但是我想要确定在我表明身份以前  她也一样为我守候
But I wanted to make sure before I declared myself she likewise had kept herself for me

665
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:12,095
而没有被哪个人诱惑  哪怕那人带了一只
and hadn't been seduced by the first charmer that came along with a...

666
00:54:12,189 --> 00:54:13,600
猪
Pig.

667
00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:21,110
可能你正是你警告我的那个人呢  先生
Perhaps you are the charmer you warned me against, signor.

668
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:24,992
我已经订了婚  到现在为止  我所知的你全是  
I'm engaged to be married, and so far all I know about you is...

669
00:54:25,077 --> 00:54:28,197
可能你会记得送给过我这个
Perhaps you remember sending me this.

670
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:34,039
赠与佩托・派普齐奥  弗朗西丝卡・布鲁尼  
"To Pietro Papprizzio from Francesca Bruni,

671
00:54:34,128 --> 00:54:36,879
带着我的希望  
with my hopes."

672
00:54:40,384 --> 00:54:45,129
或许我应该带来  其他你写给我的信
Perhaps I should've brought the other letters you wrote me.

673
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:04,399
我唯一的愿望就是你会爱上我
The only desire I have is that you'll come to love me.

674
00:55:04,491 --> 00:55:10,944
如果你不能  或者你心中另有他人
And if you cannot or if there is someone else for whom your heart beats in secret,

675
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,082
那我将放弃和你的婚约
I shall release you from your engagement.

676
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,453
没有  没有其他人
There isn't! There isn't.

677
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,172
普齐主教大人到
His Eminence, Bishop Pucci.

678
00:55:25,305 --> 00:55:31,425
-可能我来的不是时候  -不  不  大人  我们非常高兴
-Perhaps I've come at a bad time. -No. No, Your Excellency. We're delighted.

679
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:34,769
我应该提前通知一下  但既然我已经到了威尼斯
I should have sent word, but since I've just arrived in Venice

680
00:55:34,856 --> 00:55:39,814
而且你的丈夫  已故的大使  是如此被教廷所敬重
and as your husband, the late ambassador, was so regarded by the Holy See,

681
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,109
教皇大人非常想要纪念他
the pope was anxious to be remembered.

682
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:47,574
请允许我介绍我的准女婿  派普齐奥先生
Allow me to introduce my son-in-law-to-be Signor Papprizzio.

683
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:52,580
-派普齐奥先生  -主教大人
-Signor Papprizzio. -Bishop.

684
00:55:52,668 --> 00:55:55,289
-我的女儿弗朗西丝卡  -亲爱的
-My daughter Francesca. -My dear.

685
00:55:55,378 --> 00:55:58,913
教皇大人最令人敬畏的法官  来威尼斯干什么呢  普齐主教大人  
What is the pope's most feared inquisitor doing in Venice, Bishop Pucci?

686
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:00,003
弗朗西丝卡
Francesca...

687
00:56:00,092 --> 00:56:03,840
没事  没事  我很高兴我的声名远播
No, no. I'm delighted that my reputation precedes me.

688
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:06,598
梵蒂冈派我来处理一些道德问题
The Vatican sent me to deal with moral problems.

689
00:56:06,681 --> 00:56:11,842
-什么样的道德问题呢  主教  -就是常见的通奸  异端之类的
-What kind of moral problems, Bishop? -The usual. Fornication, heresy.

690
00:56:11,937 --> 00:56:14,973
教会到底是怎么定义异端的呢  
How exactly does the Church define heresy?

691
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:17,306
弗朗西丝卡  
Francesca!

692
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,734
我不认为异端是  适合年轻女士讨论的话题
I hardly think heresy is a fit conversation for a young lady.

693
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,774
为什么  我们不会是异端吗  
Why? Can't we be heretics?

694
00:56:23,865 --> 00:56:29,072
普齐主教  我认为我的未婚妻  可能想要从你这学到更多的东西
I think my fiancee, Bishop Pucci, wishes to learn more from you perhaps.

695
00:56:29,704 --> 00:56:31,496
如果您允许的话
If you please.

696
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:33,907
很好
Very well.

697
00:56:35,418 --> 00:56:38,787
异端是对教会教义的公开污蔑
Heresy is an affront to the teachings of the Church.

698
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,747
是对我们风俗道德的背叛
It is a rebellion against our mores and our morals.

699
00:56:42,842 --> 00:56:46,626
更重要的是  你会明白这一点
More to the point, and you will understand this,

700
00:56:46,721 --> 00:56:50,055
因为你是个女人  总是以女人的方式来理解
since you are a woman and understand women's ways,

701
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:53,308
总是有所谓的奇思妙想
hence the concept of "whim",

702
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:57,892
所以我说什么是异端  那就是
heresy is whatever I say it is.

703
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:04,983
比如  那个作家贝纳多・瓜尔迪  他就是个异端
For example, that writer fellow, Bernardo Guardi, he is a heretic.

704
00:57:05,073 --> 00:57:06,733
为什么  
And why is that?

705
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:10,275
维托利亚  茶在哪  
Vittorio, where is the tea?

706
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:14,201
瓜尔迪的文字让女人欲求不满
Guardi's words cause women to feel dissatisfied

707
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,161
-让男人担心自己的阳刚之气  -真的  
-and men to doubt their manhood. -Really?

708
00:57:17,251 --> 00:57:22,127
如果你是这位瓜尔迪的崇拜者  我有些不好的消息要告诉你
If you are an admirer of this Guardi fellow, I have some very sad news for you.

709
00:57:22,215 --> 00:57:23,792
他完蛋了
He's written out.

710
00:57:25,593 --> 00:57:28,926
我的手下现在正在街上找他呢
My colleagues are scouring the streets for him as we speak.

711
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:34,882
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

712
00:57:34,977 --> 00:57:39,722
-主教大人  您喝茶吗  -谢谢  不用了  我还要见其他人
-Bishop, will you take tea? -Thank you, no. I have people to see.

713
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,816
布鲁尼小姐
Signorina Bruni.

714
00:57:45,905 --> 00:57:50,567
我有这个荣幸  可以陪同你参加狂欢节舞会吗  
May I have the honour of accompanying you to the carnival ball?

715
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:59,830
但是我什么坏事也没干
But I've done nothing wrong.

716
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:05,625
我是冤枉的  你们抓错人了  放开我
I'm innocent! You've got the wrong man! Let me go!

717
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:08,079
快走  快走
Come on. Come on.

718
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,555
贝纳多・瓜尔迪有急讯要我通知你
I have an urgent message for you from Bernardo Guardi.

719
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:19,217
你是谁  
Who are you?

720
00:58:19,308 --> 00:58:23,720
这无关紧要  罗马来的主审官来了  正在四处抓人
Never mind. The Chief lnquisitor from Rome is here and he is out for blood.

721
00:58:23,812 --> 00:58:27,311
-请推迟新书的出版  -你来晚了点
-Delay publishing the new pamphlet. -You're a little late.

722
00:58:27,399 --> 00:58:29,641
哦  天啊  那别卖了
Oh, my God. Stop selling it.

723
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:32,652
-对不起  -那书里就是那么写的  是猪
-Sorry. -That's what it says. The pig.

724
00:58:32,738 --> 00:58:36,356
-我一直在养猪  -天啊  女人
-Well, I've always owned pigs. -Oh, tit.

725
00:58:40,036 --> 00:58:44,697
海报  派普齐奥


726
00:58:50,922 --> 00:58:52,085
没错
Right.

727
00:58:53,466 --> 00:58:56,551
要保证到舞会时要按期完成
Now, make sure it's ready in time for the ball.

728
00:58:56,636 --> 00:58:58,214
啊  主人
Ah. Master.

729
00:58:58,305 --> 00:59:01,804
-治疗如何了  -这个嘛
-How's the treatment going? -Well...

730
00:59:01,892 --> 00:59:04,217
-他有没有什么改善  -有  不过
-Is he any better? -Yeah, well...

731
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:07,347
反正他也不可能变得更难看
It's impossible he could look any worse.

732
00:59:07,439 --> 00:59:11,223
是你吗  大师  瓜尔迪大师  是你吗  
Is that you, Maestro? Maestro Guardi, is that you?

733
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:15,315
-喂  是谁在那  -天啊  你完成了不可能完成的任务
-Hello. Who's there? -Good God. You achieved the impossible.

734
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:17,943
-谢谢你  -你在他身上涂的是什么  
-Thank you. -What have you smeared all over him?

735
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:21,199
-基本是猪油  还有薄荷嗜喱  -喂  
-Lard, mostly. Mint jelly. -Hello?

736
00:59:21,286 --> 00:59:24,240
-还有些咖啡渣  -恩  咖啡渣  干的好
-A few coffee grounds. -Yes. Coffee grounds. Well done.

737
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,074
-先生  -是你吗  大师  
-Signore. -Is it you, Maestro?

738
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:28,787
-是的  派普齐奥  -我看起来如何  
-Yes, Papprizzio. -How do I look?

739
00:59:28,877 --> 00:59:30,953
这个嘛  我来看看
Well, let's see.

740
00:59:31,629 --> 00:59:35,757
恩  很不错  看起来相当不错
Yes. That's very good. It's coming along quite nicely.

741
00:59:35,842 --> 00:59:39,507
我一直向你的人要镜子  他似乎找不到
I've been asking your man for a mirror. He can't seem to find one for me.

742
00:59:39,596 --> 00:59:43,807
-哦  是吗  鲁勃  镜子呢  -我哪都找不到
-Oh, well... Lupo, mirror? -I can't find one anywhere.

743
00:59:43,891 --> 00:59:48,637
使用了你所有的方法以后  我迫不及待的想要看看效果
After application of all your techniques, I'm terribly anxious to check my progress.

744
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,055
-非常合理  -是的
-Yes, of course. -Yes.

745
00:59:51,149 --> 00:59:54,019
哦  你在这  佛里奥  来的正好
Oh, there you are, Fulvio. Good man.

746
00:59:56,154 --> 00:59:58,360
天啊
God.

747
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:01,901
生效了
It's working.

748
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:05,485
-生效了  对吧  -是的
-It's working, isn't it? -Yes.

749
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,114
-生效了  -确实如此
-It's working. -Yes, indeed.

750
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:11,699
你向布鲁尼一家表达了我的遗憾对吧
You took my regrets, of course, to the house of Bruni?

751
01:00:11,794 --> 01:00:13,169
是的
Yes.

752
01:00:13,254 --> 01:00:16,457
-好  说是因为坏天气之类的所以不能来  -当然
-Good. Bad weather or some such? -Yes. Of course I did.

753
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:19,716
那弗朗西丝卡怎么办  我告诉她我要带她去狂欢节舞会
What of Francesca? I told her I'd take her to the carnival ball,

754
01:00:19,802 --> 01:00:22,756
但我觉得我还需要一些时间
but I do think I need just a bit more time.

755
01:00:22,847 --> 01:00:26,013
是的  我想你是对的  你确实需要更多的时间
Yes, I think you're right. You do need some more time.

756
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,591
-别急  我会处理的  -你真是好人
-Listen. Don't worry. I'll handle that. -Good man.

757
01:00:28,686 --> 01:00:31,307
你放松点吧  鲁勃  肚子这里再多涂点
You relax. Lupo, a little more around the belly.

758
01:00:31,397 --> 01:00:33,970
没错  鲁勃  肚子多涂点
Yes, Lupo. More on the belly.

759
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,405
先生  普齐主教大人要见你
Signore, Bishop Pucci wishes to see you.

760
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:42,949
当然
Of course.

761
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:46,948
我的名字是贝纳多・瓜尔迪  但我不是那个贝纳多・瓜尔迪
My name is Bernardo Guardi, but I'm not the Bernardo Guardi.

762
01:00:47,037 --> 01:00:51,995
说实话吧  贝纳多  当作家也没什么可耻的
Come along now, Bernardo. There's no shame in being a writer.

763
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:54,492
要不我们玩个游戏  
Let's play a little game, shall we?

764
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:56,793
我给你读一句话  你来补全
I'll read you a sentence and you finish it.

765
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,454
女人是空气  
"A woman is air and..."

766
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,792
还是什么  贝纳多  
Andwhat, Bernardo?

767
01:01:01,885 --> 01:01:06,631
我  不知道  麻烦  不  不
I don't know. Trouble? No. No.

768
01:01:06,724 --> 01:01:08,633
风  空气和风  
Wind? Air and wind?

769
01:01:08,726 --> 01:01:12,723
不对  我来给你点线索吧  好不好  
No. I'll give you a little clue, shall l?

770
01:01:16,608 --> 01:01:19,775
我反对的不是茶  而是水
It's not the tea I object to. It's the water.

771
01:01:20,696 --> 01:01:25,488
那  派普齐奥先生  你和卡萨诺瓦有多熟  
So, Signor Papprizzio, how well do you know Casanova?

772
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,574
注意你的答案
Be careful how you answer.

773
01:01:30,664 --> 01:01:33,581
我说不定会对你有兴趣的
I could become interested in you.

774
01:01:37,337 --> 01:01:39,164
我没有完全  
I was less than...

775
01:01:39,256 --> 01:01:43,123
我在布鲁尼夫人家没完全说实话
I was less than frank at Signora Bruni's.

776
01:01:43,218 --> 01:01:45,791
我来这要吊死的是卡萨诺瓦
It is Casanova I have come here to hang.

777
01:01:45,887 --> 01:01:48,841
那个唾弃教会教义的通奸犯
That fornicator who spits upon the teachings of the Church.

778
01:01:48,932 --> 01:01:55,053
你听到我的话了吗  很好  那为什么你要和卡萨诺瓦去他家呢  
Are you following me? Good. So why did you go with Casanova to his house?

779
01:01:55,146 --> 01:01:57,638
-我租他的房子住  -租他房子住  
-I'm renting it from him. -You're renting it?

780
01:01:57,732 --> 01:02:00,520
-当然纯粹是生意  -生意
-It's strictly business, of course. -Business.

781
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:03,781
我相信他这两天出城了
I believe he went out of town for a day or two.

782
01:02:03,872 --> 01:02:06,030
-出城了  -是的
-Out of town? -Yes.

783
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:13,206
恩  据我所知  他决不会错过狂欢节的
Well, if I know anything, he's hardly likely to absent himself from Camevale.

784
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:20,842
派普齐奥先生  如果你帮我  把这个家伙一劳永逸的解决掉
Signor Papprizzio, if you'd help put an end to this fornicator's career for good and all,

785
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:25,010
相信我  教会一定会非常感激的
believe me, the Church will be very grateful.

786
01:02:25,101 --> 01:02:27,058
怎么个非常感激法  
How grateful?

787
01:02:27,145 --> 01:02:29,470
梵蒂冈的猪油特许权
The lard concession at the Vatican.

788
01:02:29,564 --> 01:02:32,933
那可是很多的猪油啊
Which is a lot of lard.

789
01:02:34,068 --> 01:02:36,310
这个提议可真吸引人啊
That's quite an attractive offer.

790
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:38,527
那我们成交  
So we have a deal?

791
01:02:38,614 --> 01:02:42,030
你会帮我把卡萨诺瓦抓来吗  
You will help deliver Casanova unto me?

792
01:02:42,118 --> 01:02:44,110
绝对没问题  就像我名叫派普齐奥一样肯定
As sure as my name is Papprizzio.

793
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:47,078
-请原谅  阁下  -等等
-Excuse me, Your Reverence. -No.

794
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:51,328
我们正在拷问的这个贝纳多・瓜尔迪  我认为他不是那个异端
This Bernardo Guardi we're racking, I don't think he is the heretic.

795
01:02:51,419 --> 01:02:54,289
我认为有人用了他的名字
I think someone is just using his name

796
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,836
-当作笔名  -笔  
-as a nom de plume. -A nom...

797
01:02:56,924 --> 01:02:59,795
别和我耍小聪明  安德里尼  什么叫你认为
Don't be clever, Andolini. What do you mean you think?

798
01:02:59,885 --> 01:03:02,341
宗教裁判所不是雇你来认为的  要肯定  
The lnquisition is not paid to think. Be sure!

799
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:06,842
呃  我非常肯定  他大字不识一个
Well, I am pretty sure. He can't read or write.

800
01:03:09,645 --> 01:03:12,646
鲁勃  鲁勃  
Lupo! Lupo!

801
01:03:13,899 --> 01:03:16,936
-没什么情人  -什么  
-There is no lover! -What?

802
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:18,854
-没什么秘密情人  -什么  
-There is no secret lover. -What?

803
01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:21,152
她从来没什么秘密情人
She never had one.

804
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:30,198
狂欢节
Camevale.

805
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,019
整个星期都在谈论猪
Talked of pigs all week.

806
01:04:01,113 --> 01:04:04,316
-亲爱的  见到我丈夫了吗  -我就是你丈夫
-Darling, have you seen my husband? -I am your husband.

807
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:09,568
-有卡萨诺瓦现身的迹像吗  -我根本不知道他长什么样
-Any sign of Casanova, sir? -I don't know what he looks like.

808
01:04:09,663 --> 01:04:13,910
但他一定在这  他决不会错过狂欢节
But he's bound to be here. He wouldn't miss the carnival.

809
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,993
派普齐奥先生
Signor Papprizzio.

810
01:04:17,004 --> 01:04:20,088

I'm a traditionalist. No intercourse before the wedding.

So, Signor Casanova, not out of town after all, I see.

886
01:11:05,992 --> 01:11:08,779
真难以相信这就是女人要的
I find it difficult to believe this is what women want.

887
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:13,117
没错  来着  小猪猪  来啊  小猪猪
Yeah. Here, little piggy. Come, little piggy.

888
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,787
-安德里尼  -先生  我认为  
-Andolini... -Sir, I think...

889
01:11:16,878 --> 01:11:19,832
不用认为  该干什么就干什么
Don't think. Just do what you do.

890
01:11:21,132 --> 01:11:25,296
把疗程停下来  我不喜欢这个部分
Stop the treatment! I don't like this part of the treatment!

891
01:11:28,181 --> 01:11:33,056
-有何进展  -他看起来很困惑
-So, what progress? -He seems confused.

892
01:11:33,144 --> 01:11:37,094
大规模的通奸就会导致困惑
Fornication on a massive scale leads to confusion.

893
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:44,272
-卡萨诺瓦先生  -我是热那亚的派普齐奥
-Signor Casanova. -I'm Papprizzio of Genoa.

894
01:11:44,364 --> 01:11:47,982
很不幸  我和派普齐奥先生非常熟
Unfortunately for you, I am intimately acquainted with Signor Papprizzio.

895
01:11:48,076 --> 01:11:51,409
-我和他喝过茶  -去问佛里奥
-I've had tea with him. -Ask Fulvio.

896
01:11:52,872 --> 01:11:55,659
佛里奥  告诉他  告诉他  佛里奥
Fulvio, tell him. Tell him, Fulvio.

897
01:12:05,051 --> 01:12:07,458
先生
Sir.

898
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:22,397
那谁是  
So who is...?

899
01:12:25,696 --> 01:12:30,405
-就是说你是派普齐奥  -我一直都在这么说  蠢货
-So you are Papprizzio. -It's what I've been saying, stupid.

900
01:12:30,492 --> 01:12:34,953
好啦  派普齐奥先生  或许你能告诉我哪能找到
Well, Signor Papprizzio, maybe you'll tell me the whereabouts

901
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:37,446
你住的别墅的主人呢
of the owner of the palazzo where you're staying.

902
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:38,952
-先生  -瓜尔迪
-Signor... -Guardi.

903
01:12:39,043 --> 01:12:41,747
贝纳多・瓜尔迪是那的主人
Signor Bernardo Guardi is my host here.

904
01:12:41,837 --> 01:12:45,171
我住在他的房里  接受他的课程  他为我设计了疗程
I'm staying at his place, taking his course. He designed my treatment.

905
01:12:45,257 --> 01:12:47,582
你知道瓜尔迪是异端分子吗  
Do you realise Guardi is a heretic?

906
01:12:47,676 --> 01:12:50,843
大人  贝纳多・瓜尔迪是笔名
Your Reverence, Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume.

907
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:55,347
那如果
Then if

908
01:12:55,434 --> 01:12:59,266
贝纳多・瓜尔迪是笔名
Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume

909
01:12:59,354 --> 01:13:03,352
说不定真名就是
perhaps the plume's nom is

910
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:05,814
卡萨诺瓦
Casanova.

911
01:13:06,445 --> 01:13:10,359
-卡萨诺瓦  -他一直在我们面前晃来晃去
-Casanova? -It was staring us in the face all along.

912
01:13:10,449 --> 01:13:15,027
说那些讨好女人的话  无聊之极
The glorification of women, et cetera. Boring, boring, boring.

913
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,034
-卡萨诺瓦就是贝纳多・瓜尔迪  -真棒  大人
-Casanova is Bernardo Guardi. -Bravo, Your Reverence.

914
01:13:19,124 --> 01:13:22,458
天啊  他带我的未婚妻去了舞会
Good Lord. He's taken my fiancee to the ball.

915
01:13:22,544 --> 01:13:25,664
他玩不了多久了  把你的人都带上  跟我来
Not for long, he's not. Get your men together and come with me.

916
01:13:25,756 --> 01:13:29,089
-你们去哪  -去舞会
-Where are you going? -I'm going to the ball.

917
01:13:29,176 --> 01:13:31,002
我们也要去
Well, so are we!

918
01:13:45,066 --> 01:13:47,937
-你说的对  她在这  -哪  
-You're right. She's here. -Where?

919
01:13:48,028 --> 01:13:51,728
就在那  看见了吗  你该带她回家
Right over there. See? You should take her home.

920
01:13:51,823 --> 01:13:57,446
-你看  我也是个传统的人  -瓦玛拉拉先生和夫人
-You see, I'm a traditionalist myself. -Signor Valmarana and Signora.

921
01:13:57,537 --> 01:13:59,031
至少有人用心装扮了
Atleastsomeone's madean effort.

922
01:13:59,122 --> 01:14:03,831
对不起  我说  至少有人用心装扮了
Excuse me. I say, at least somebody's made an effort.

923
01:14:03,918 --> 01:14:07,003
这是红衣主教的装扮嘛
Now that is purple.

924
01:14:07,088 --> 01:14:10,753
这不是威尼斯式的吧  对吧  难道我错了  这是  
That's not Venetian, is it? Am I wrong? That is a...

925
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:15,006
伦敦  巴黎还是罗马的  难道是  
London? Paris? Rome? Is it...

926
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:18,097
和教皇的紫衣差不多了
It's almost a papal purple.

927
01:14:19,434 --> 01:14:21,557
让我想起了一些东西  别告诉我
It reminds me of something. Don't tell me.

928
01:14:21,644 --> 01:14:26,022
-普齐法官  -普齐法官
-lnquisitor Pucci. -lnquisitor Pucci.

929
01:14:26,107 --> 01:14:29,523
是的  我知道  我听说你来威尼斯了
Yes, I know. I heard you were in Venice.

930
01:14:30,945 --> 01:14:34,943
-来跳舞  -我来这是来逮捕贾柯莫・卡萨诺瓦
-Come for a dance? -I'm here to arrest Giacomo Casanova.

931
01:14:35,033 --> 01:14:39,280
卡萨诺瓦就要娶一位  以端庄而闻名的年轻淑女了
Casanova is about to marry a young woman famous for her modesty.

932
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:43,202
他现在没有劣迹  而且他处于我的保护之下
His slate is wiped clean, and he's under my protection.

933
01:14:43,291 --> 01:14:46,541
你已经保护到异端分子身上了  
Does your protection extend to heretics?

934
01:14:46,627 --> 01:14:50,079
小心点  总督大人  你城市的自由
Beware, Doge. Your city's freedom

935
01:14:50,173 --> 01:14:53,957
就在梵蒂冈的一念之间
dangles from the belt of the Vatican.

936
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,173
欢迎你
You're welcome.

937
01:15:22,246 --> 01:15:26,955
-玛西莫・卡那尔海军上将和夫人  -欢迎你们
-Admiral Massimo Canal and Signora. -You're welcome.

938
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:28,585
弗朗西丝卡在哪  
Where's Francesca?

939
01:15:28,669 --> 01:15:32,501
我叫佩托・派普齐奥  我来自热那亚
My name is Pietro Papprizzio and I'm from Genoa.

940
01:15:33,132 --> 01:15:35,124
什么  
What?

941
01:15:38,178 --> 01:15:41,179
热那亚的派普齐奥先生  
Signor Papprizzio of Genoa.

942
01:16:21,346 --> 01:16:23,672
你是派普齐奥  
So you're Papprizzio?

943
01:16:26,226 --> 01:16:29,061
热那亚的  
From Genoa?

944
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:33,524
你是叫  
Is your name...

945
01:16:33,608 --> 01:16:35,352
布鲁尼
Bruni.

946
01:16:37,654 --> 01:16:39,812
我是你的  
I'm your...

947
01:16:39,906 --> 01:16:41,069
我是你未来的  
I'm your future...

948
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:44,075
我从没想到你是这么美  
I never dreamt you'd be so beautiful.

949
01:16:44,161 --> 01:16:45,987
我  
Me?

950
01:16:50,584 --> 01:16:52,991
哦  天啊  天啊
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

951
01:16:53,086 --> 01:16:54,165
为什么
Why...

952
01:16:54,254 --> 01:16:58,298
不  我是你未来岳母
No. No, I'm your future mother-in-law.

953
01:16:58,383 --> 01:17:01,004
-岳母  -是的
-My mother-in-law? -Yes.

954
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:05,092
-我不是和你有婚约  -不  是和我女儿
-I'm not betrothed to you? -No, to my daughter.

955
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,970
有人认为我女儿很漂亮
Some people find her beautiful.

956
01:17:10,061 --> 01:17:14,522
-有个男人正在追求她  -真的  她喜欢他吗  
-There's a man who's after her. -Really? Does she like him?

957
01:17:14,607 --> 01:17:18,226
布鲁尼夫人  骗你女儿的  不是别人  正是卡萨诺瓦
Signora Bruni, your daughter has been duped by none other than Casanova.

958
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:20,312
但别担心  他也就  
But worry not. He's as good as...

959
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:29,822
为什么你就不能不打扰我们呢  
Why don't you stop interfering, all right?

960
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:33,283
谢谢
Thank you.

961
01:17:50,977 --> 01:17:53,515
小姐
Signorina.

962
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:56,142
我还在担心我失去你了
I was afraid I'd lost you.

963
01:17:56,232 --> 01:17:58,901
就好像丢了怀表一样吗  派普齐奥先生  
As one might lose a pocket watch, Signor Papprizzio,

964
01:17:58,985 --> 01:18:02,104
还是像是丢了其他什么值钱的东西  
or some other valuable possession?

965
01:18:02,196 --> 01:18:04,983
我知道没有男人会拥有你
I know that no man will ever own you.

966
01:18:05,074 --> 01:18:08,408
但如果能作旅途上保护你的人
But to be your defender on the road you travel,

967
01:18:08,494 --> 01:18:14,497
或者为你展现你未曾见过的世界  这就是我的希望
to show you the world as you've never seen it, for that I hold my hopes.

968
01:18:14,584 --> 01:18:18,415
让我们向天堂多走一步吧
Let's start by taking one step closer to heaven.

969
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,325
你抓住这个
You get this one here.

970
01:18:58,419 --> 01:19:00,376
准备好了吗  听我数三下
Ready. On the count of three.

971
01:19:00,462 --> 01:19:02,585
一  二  三
One, two, three.

972
01:19:25,404 --> 01:19:26,779
巫术
Witchcraft.

973
01:19:30,576 --> 01:19:35,818
其实  我相信那是因为热空气上升  抵消了重力的  
Actually, I believe it's because hot air rises, overcoming the gravitational force of...

974
01:19:35,914 --> 01:19:38,203
巫术
Witchcraft.

975
01:19:48,093 --> 01:19:50,086
看我们飞的多高
Here we are.

976
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:56,306
看  那是卡萨诺瓦和他的新未婚妻
Look! It's Casanova with his new fiancee.

977
01:20:04,776 --> 01:20:07,860
卡萨诺瓦
Casanova.

978
01:20:07,946 --> 01:20:09,773
快来
Come on.

979
01:20:09,864 --> 01:20:12,901
那是弗朗西丝卡吗  
Is that Francesca?

980
01:20:12,992 --> 01:20:15,993
-就是她  -那是弗朗西丝卡  
-It is her. -That's Francesca.

981
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:19,780
-我从没见过她这么快乐  -真的  
-I've never seen her look so happy. -Really?

982
01:20:21,251 --> 01:20:25,379
对你可是坏消息啊  派普齐奥先生
Such bad news for you, Signor Papprizzio.

983
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:32,964
真是灾难啊  她抛弃了我
O calamity. She's thrown me over.

984
01:20:33,054 --> 01:20:37,266
-太丢人了  -哦  真是耻辱
-Disgraceful. -Oh, well. A scandal.

985
01:20:40,228 --> 01:20:44,012
-你现在是自由的男人了  -哦  天啊
-You're a free man. -Oh, dear.

986
01:20:45,984 --> 01:20:48,142
我该怎么做  
What will I do?

987
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:10,498
谢谢你  派普齐奥先生
Thank you, Signor Papprizzio.

988
01:21:12,051 --> 01:21:15,883
我开始相信你是真心的了
I'm beginning to believe that your heart is true.

989
01:21:16,681 --> 01:21:20,761
爱情在你心中要比生意更重
There is more of the lover than the merchant in you.

990
01:21:20,851 --> 01:21:24,018
为什么你不告诉我  你就是我未婚夫呢  
Why didn't you tell me you were my betrothed?

991
01:21:24,105 --> 01:21:26,512
你不信任我  
You didn't trust me?

992
01:21:27,608 --> 01:21:31,985
那  为什么你不告诉我  你是贝纳多・瓜尔迪呢  
Well, why didn't you tell me you were Bernardo Guardi?

993
01:21:36,742 --> 01:21:39,826
没关系  我不会告诉任何人的
It's all right. I won't tell anyone.

994
01:21:41,831 --> 01:21:48,332
我早就该猜到的  在那男权至上的  大本营第一次见到你的时候就该猜到
I should've guessed the first time I saw you in that citadel of male complacency

995
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:53,129
你在辩论中那么勇敢  就好像你后来在决斗中一样
when you were as brave in debate as you were later in duel.

996
01:21:57,388 --> 01:22:00,721
你就是贝纳多・瓜尔迪  只是戴着美丽的面具
You were Bernardo Guardi in beauty's mask.

997
01:22:03,936 --> 01:22:06,474
我爱上你了  弗朗西丝卡
I'm in love with you, Francesca.

998
01:22:12,945 --> 01:22:14,569
你在辩论会现场  
You were at the debate?

999
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:18,948
是的  是的  我在
Yes. Yes, I was.

1000
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:21,276
在大学里  
At the university.

1001
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:26,410
弗朗西丝卡  
Francesca...

1002
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:33,418
就像你有合理的原因  不能告诉我你的真实身份一样
Just as you had honest reason for not telling me who you were,

1003
01:22:34,967 --> 01:22:39,878
我也有合理的原因  
I, too, have honest reason...

1004
01:22:41,098 --> 01:22:42,473
怎么了  
What?

1005
01:22:53,944 --> 01:22:55,189
我能解释这个
I can explain this.

1006
01:22:56,363 --> 01:22:58,521
你是派普齐奥  
Are you Papprizzio?

1007
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:04,447
告诉我你是派普齐奥  我的未婚夫
Tell me you're Papprizzio, my betrothed.

1008
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:09,241
你是谁  
Who are you?

1009
01:23:15,006 --> 01:23:16,999
我是卡萨诺瓦
I'm Casanova.

1010
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:19,793
什么  
What?

1011
01:23:19,886 --> 01:23:23,836
我是贾柯莫・卡萨诺瓦
I'm... I'm Giacomo Casanova.

1012
01:23:27,143 --> 01:23:30,144
你代表着一切我反对的东西
You stand for everything I write against.

1013
01:23:32,398 --> 01:23:36,230
-难道那不是你认识我之前的事吗  -我不认识你
-Wasn't that before you knew me? -I don't know you.

1014
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:39,026
哪一个才是真的你  
Which one of you?

1015
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:55,077
我觉得我更喜欢面具下的你  至少萨尔瓦多还是位绅士
I think I liked you better in your masks. At least Salvato was a gentleman.

1016
01:23:55,171 --> 01:23:59,251
派普齐奥也有希望  但卡萨诺瓦  我非常讨厌
Papprizzio was promising. But Casanova, I despise.

1017
01:23:59,342 --> 01:24:01,169
你怎么敢说你爱我
You dare to say you love me.

1018
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:06,847
我要等的是那种  男人愿意用生命交换的爱情
I would save myself for the kind of love which a man would give his life for.

1019
01:24:18,027 --> 01:24:19,605
-你受伤了吗  -我还好
-Are you hurt? -I'm fine.

1020
01:24:19,695 --> 01:24:22,151
卡萨诺瓦
Casanova.

1021
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,108
卡萨诺瓦先生
Signor Casanova.

1022
01:24:25,201 --> 01:24:29,068
我来此逮捕你  罪名是通奸  招摇撞骗
I'm here to arrest you as a fornicator, a charlatan,

1023
01:24:29,163 --> 01:24:34,204
还有更可耻的  躲在另一个名头下的懦夫行为
and, above all, a coward who hides behind the name of another -

1024
01:24:34,293 --> 01:24:37,080
贝纳多・瓜尔迪先生也是你吧
Signor Bernardo Guardi.

1025
01:24:40,758 --> 01:24:44,542
作为贝纳多・瓜尔迪  你的罪名是异端
And as Bernardo Guardi, I arrest you as a heretic.

1026
01:24:44,637 --> 01:24:48,586
-什么  他不是  -是的  小姐  他正是
-What? He's not... -Yes, signorina, he is.

1027
01:24:48,682 --> 01:24:52,051
-他不是  -弗朗西丝卡  别这样
-He's not... -Francesca, don't.

1028
01:24:53,562 --> 01:24:56,232
不要
No.

1029
01:24:59,401 --> 01:25:01,643
我是贝纳多・瓜尔迪
I'm Bernardo Guardi.

1030
01:25:32,559 --> 01:25:34,931
普齐主教大人
Bishop Pucci.

1031
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:37,890
我有什么能为您效劳的吗  亲爱的  
How can I help you, my dear?

1032
01:26:05,342 --> 01:26:07,002
我曾经是一个处女
I was a virgin.

1033
01:26:07,093 --> 01:26:11,672
我的贞洁是我最珍视的财富
My virginity was my most cherished possession -

1034
01:26:11,765 --> 01:26:13,971
是上帝赐予我的礼物
my gift from God.

1035
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:17,556
但有人夺去了我的贞洁
My gift was taken from me.

1036
01:26:17,646 --> 01:26:21,892
真是悲哀啊  太卑鄙无耻了  这个可恶的骗子是谁  
Tragic and most damnable. What was the name of this vile seducer?

1037
01:26:22,734 --> 01:26:24,228
贾柯莫・卡萨诺瓦
Giacomo Casanova.

1038
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:31,447
是卡萨诺瓦进到我的房间  从我这里夺去的
When Casanova came to my room and robbed me

1039
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:35,693
我为我的荣誉反抗过
I fought for my honour.

1040
01:26:35,789 --> 01:26:40,249
你是说当我需要绞死他时  你愿意出庭作证吗  
Are you saying you'd be willing to give me the testimony that I need to hang him?

1041
01:26:40,335 --> 01:26:41,995
是的
Yes.

1042
01:26:42,086 --> 01:26:45,253
但我担心我的名誉
But I would worry about my reputation.

1043
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:50,215
合情合理  但我认为如果一切照计划办
Of course. But I think we could say if everything went according to plan,

1044
01:26:50,303 --> 01:26:54,846
我们可以挽回你的名誉  甚至挽回你的贞洁
we could return your reputation and your virginity to you.

1045
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:58,175
-你能做到这个  -哦  是的
-You could do that? -Oh, yes.

1046
01:26:58,269 --> 01:27:01,306
我们是天主教会  我们可以做任何事情
We are the Catholic Church. We can do anything.

1047
01:27:13,242 --> 01:27:17,240
对不起  什么时候轮到我  
Excuse me. When is my turn?

1048
01:27:21,209 --> 01:27:23,248
给我一个真正的男人吧
Give me a man who is man enough

1049
01:27:23,336 --> 01:27:27,120
除了配的上自己的那个女人  不会沾花惹草的男人
to give himself just to the woman who is worth him.

1050
01:27:27,965 --> 01:27:30,752
如果那个女人是我的话
And ifthatwomanwere me,

1051
01:27:30,843 --> 01:27:35,137
我也会只爱他一个  一生一世
I would love him alone and forever.

1052
01:28:25,814 --> 01:28:27,937
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

1053
01:28:28,025 --> 01:28:31,358
-你肯定我不欠你什么吗  -正相反呢
-Are you sure I don't owe you anything? -On the contrary.

1054
01:28:31,445 --> 01:28:33,022
-谢谢  -再见
-Thank you. -Bye.

1055
01:28:33,113 --> 01:28:36,862
-再见  -再来啊
-Bye. -Come back.

1056
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:39,951
你是  你是那个总站在窗口的男孩
You're... You're the boy in the window.

1057
01:28:40,829 --> 01:28:42,240
德那多小姐
Signorina Donato.

1058
01:28:42,331 --> 01:28:44,572
我们不会忘记你的
We won't forget you.

1059
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:48,118
你将会成为女孩子口中的传奇
You'll be a legend among the girls.

1060
01:28:49,963 --> 01:28:53,379
-这太糟糕了  -为什么  
-This is terrible. -Why?

1061
01:28:55,969 --> 01:28:58,258
我无可就药的爱了你很多年
I've loved you hopelessly for years.

1062
01:29:00,432 --> 01:29:03,386
那你为什么不说呢  
Why didn't you say?

1063
01:29:18,492 --> 01:29:23,830
大人  替囚犯辩护的  是帕多瓦的乔达诺博士
My Lord, the prisoner is being represented by a Dr Giordano of Padua.

1064
01:29:25,624 --> 01:29:28,992
那我要请问您的辩护理由了  乔达诺博士
Then I call the defence, Dr Giordano.

1065
01:29:30,003 --> 01:29:32,755
这个案子认错了人  大人
It is a case of mistaken identity, Your Grace.

1066
01:29:32,839 --> 01:29:34,666
-什么  认错  -是的
-What? Mistaken... -Yes.

1067
01:29:34,758 --> 01:29:39,170
此人不是贝纳多・瓜尔迪
This man is not Bernardo Guardi.

1068
01:29:39,262 --> 01:29:41,005
-他正是  -没错  我正是
-Yes, he is. -Yes, I am.

1069
01:29:41,097 --> 01:29:43,884
-你看到没  -他只是在保护某人
-You see? -He is protecting someone.

1070
01:29:43,975 --> 01:29:45,517
-不是的  -是的
-No. -Yes, you are.

1071
01:29:45,602 --> 01:29:48,852
-不  我没有  -是的  你  没有
-No, I'm not. -Yes, you are... not.

1072
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:51,147
保护谁  
Protecting who?

1073
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:55,401
一个爱他的女人
The woman who loves him.

1074
01:30:01,034 --> 01:30:04,616
如果你是你供述的那个人  或许你可以为本庭提供点证据
If you are who you say, perhaps you could indulge the court with a few samples

1075
01:30:04,704 --> 01:30:07,491
讲讲你那非常有名的  关于女人的哲学
of your more renowned philosophies on women.

1076
01:30:10,877 --> 01:30:14,162
如果我说我是贝纳多・瓜尔迪  这还不够吗  
If I've said I am Bernardo Guardi, does that not suffice?

1077
01:30:14,255 --> 01:30:18,917
大人  我们一定要听这个异端胡扯吗  他自己都已经承认了
My Lord, must we listen to this stuttering heretic? He has self-confessed.

1078
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:22,461
你就仅仅需要这个吗  一份供述  
Is that all that you require? A confession?

1079
01:30:22,555 --> 01:30:25,307
这个  是的  我看就是如此
Well, yes. I suppose so.

1080
01:30:26,184 --> 01:30:29,019
很好
Good.

1081
01:30:31,063 --> 01:30:36,568
因为这手稿是我写的  是我亲手写的
Because I am the one with the manuscripts, written in my own hand.

1082
01:30:36,652 --> 01:30:39,060
只有我才有证据说明我  
I am the only one with proof that l...

1083
01:30:39,906 --> 01:30:42,990
我才是贝纳多・瓜尔迪
I am Bernardo Guardi.

1084
01:30:43,659 --> 01:30:45,451
你  
You?

1085
01:30:45,536 --> 01:30:48,537
-弗朗西丝卡  -你真以为我会让你为我而死吗  
-Francesca. -Do you really think I'd let you die for me?

1086
01:30:48,622 --> 01:30:51,540
很好  那  释放囚犯卡萨诺瓦
Well, then, release the prisoner Casanova.

1087
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:57,165
大人  大人  我们不用忘了这是法庭
My Lord, my Lord, let us not forget this is a court of law.

1088
01:30:57,256 --> 01:31:00,257
我们还是抓到了一个  自认有罪的异端
We still have a self-confessed heretic.

1089
01:31:00,342 --> 01:31:04,672
而且我们还抓到  一个臭名卓著的骗子
And we also have a notorious seducer,

1090
01:31:04,763 --> 01:31:08,263
一个通奸犯  破坏贞洁的罪人
an adulterer, a violator of virgins

1091
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:11,517
对他的罪行我将提供  
whose guilt I will prove by the testimony of...

1092
01:31:11,604 --> 01:31:13,264
不  
No!

1093
01:31:13,355 --> 01:31:15,348
那不是真的
It wasn't true.

1094
01:31:17,985 --> 01:31:19,265
还有  
Of...

1095
01:31:19,361 --> 01:31:24,818
我还有不低于127份宣誓的证词
By the testimony of no less than 1 27 sworn statements,

1096
01:31:24,908 --> 01:31:29,202
证明贾柯莫・卡萨诺瓦的淫荡
attesting to the libidinous lust of Giacomo Casanova.

1097
01:31:30,247 --> 01:31:34,114
本庭只会得出一个结果  有罪
There is only one verdict open to this court: guilty.

1098
01:31:34,626 --> 01:31:38,410
只有一项刑罚  死刑
And onesentence: death.

1099
01:31:38,922 --> 01:31:42,790
-判处异端贝纳多・瓜尔迪死刑  -不  
-Death to the heretic Bernardo Guardi. -No!

1100
01:31:42,885 --> 01:31:46,752
判处著名的通奸犯
And deathtothe masterfornicator

1101
01:31:46,847 --> 01:31:49,468
贾柯莫・卡萨诺瓦死刑
Giacomo Casanova.

1102
01:32:44,988 --> 01:32:48,986
-你说过红衣主教会来  -我说过  先生
-You did say the cardinal's coming. -I did, sir.

1103
01:33:13,057 --> 01:33:16,841
大人  我认为我们不能再等了
Your Reverence, I don't think we can wait any longer.

1104
01:33:16,936 --> 01:33:18,929
很好
Very well.

1105
01:33:19,981 --> 01:33:21,854
没他我也会执行
I shall have to do itwithout him.

1106
01:33:43,421 --> 01:33:46,587
红衣主教劳勃斯塔大人到  
Cardinal Lopresta has arrived!

1107
01:34:06,110 --> 01:34:08,862
对不起  我们来晚了  都是运河耽搁的
Sorry we're late. Canals, et cetera.

1108
01:34:08,946 --> 01:34:11,947
阁下  我是普齐主教
Your Eminence. Bishop Pucci.

1109
01:34:12,032 --> 01:34:14,025
很荣幸终于见到您了
An honour to meet you at last.

1110
01:34:14,118 --> 01:34:17,451
-您的大名如雷贯耳  -谢谢
-I've heard so much about you. -Thank you.

1111
01:34:17,538 --> 01:34:19,863
我们在这干什么  
What's happening here?

1112
01:34:19,957 --> 01:34:25,497
吊死卡萨诺瓦和一个异端
Just hanging a heretic and Casanova.

1113
01:34:25,588 --> 01:34:26,786
真是好运啊
What luck.

1114
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:31,164
我的护士
My nurse.

1115
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:35,718
您的护士喜欢看处决  
And does your nurse enjoy executions?

1116
01:34:35,806 --> 01:34:38,427
教皇陛下不是也有个阳台吗  
Does the pope have a balcony?

1117
01:34:38,517 --> 01:34:41,090
我来此真正想说的是
What I actually came to say is this.

1118
01:34:44,982 --> 01:34:45,978
威尼斯市民们
Venetians!

1119
01:34:47,568 --> 01:34:50,568
教皇陛下向你们致以问候
Greetings from His Holiness.

1120
01:34:50,654 --> 01:34:54,901
如你们所知  今天是教皇陛下的生日
As you know, today is the pope's birthday.

1121
01:34:55,701 --> 01:34:57,243
-并且  -你知道这事吗  
-And... -Did you know that?

1122
01:34:57,327 --> 01:35:03,033
为了纪念他的生日  教皇陛下特别宣布
And in honour of his birthday, His Holiness has decreed

1123
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:12,088
对于今天被处死刑的囚犯  给予教皇特赦
a papal pardon for all those who would be executed

1124
01:35:12,175 --> 01:35:14,464
-红衣主教阁下  -释放囚犯
-Your Eminence. -Free the prisoners.

1125
01:35:16,388 --> 01:35:18,630
释放囚犯
Free the prisoners!

1126
01:35:23,728 --> 01:35:26,516
红衣主教阁下  不  不  不
Your Eminence. No. No. No.

1127
01:35:26,982 --> 01:35:30,351
教皇陛下的生日  你看起来不怎么高兴嘛
You don't seem to share the pope's happiness on his birthday.

1128
01:35:30,443 --> 01:35:32,103
不  我很高兴  很高兴
No, I do. I do.

1129
01:35:34,531 --> 01:35:36,737
他今年圣寿多少啊  
How old is he?

1130
01:35:36,825 --> 01:35:39,031
我也不大清楚
I'm not quite sure.

1131
01:35:43,665 --> 01:35:47,793
-不  不  -最好待在这  下面的人不太友好啊
-No, no... -Best stay here. Crowd's turning ugly.

1132
01:35:52,132 --> 01:35:57,090
请上我的马车  我们要去我的乡间别墅
Please join me in my coach. We're leaving for my country house.

1133
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:20,156
很抱歉我来的太晚了
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1134
01:36:22,745 --> 01:36:25,746
都是我的错  我有罪
My fault. I'm to blame.

1135
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,952
提托
Tito.

1136
01:36:28,042 --> 01:36:30,082
我一生的至爱
The love of my life.

1137
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:35,418
这是我儿子
This is my son.

1138
01:36:36,342 --> 01:36:39,676
我以前就演过红衣主教  你可能见过我
I've played cardinals before, of course. You may have seen me.

1139
01:36:39,762 --> 01:36:44,922
总之  当我们在的里雅斯特听到这个消息  就离开了剧团  我们必须得赶快来
Anyway, we left our troupe in Trieste when we heard the news. Had to move fast.

1140
01:36:47,478 --> 01:36:49,518
妈妈  这漆还没干
Mom, the paint is wet.

1141
01:36:53,234 --> 01:36:55,108
这里写着  巡回剧团
It says "Theatre Troupe" here.

1142

1183

这可不仅仅是个名字

我的职责是留在卡萨诺瓦身边
My place is with Casanova.

1191
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:04,959
那好好照顾  我  我的朋友

当然  主人

1193
01:42:36,699 --> 01:42:38,074

1197
01:43:03,059 --> 01:43:05,051
追啊

1198
01:43:20,201 --> 01:43:22,656
我告诉过你我会回来的
I told you I'd come back.

1199
01:43:36,592 --> 01:43:40,292
这生活不错  作演员
It's a wonderful life, an actor's life.

1200
01:43:40,387 --> 01:43:42,759
你会喜欢的
You'll love it.

1201
01:43:43,766 --> 01:43:47,016
谁为你写剧本

1202
01:43:54,276 --> 01:43:56,482
到里面来
Come inside.

1203
01:44:02,659 --> 01:44:04,202
真好
Lovely.

1204
01:44:04,286 --> 01:44:07,322
正是我的  好天气  
Just my kind of good weather.

1205
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:46,609
这就是为什么卡萨诺瓦  和弗朗西丝卡的故事
Which is why the story of Casanova and Francesca

1206
01:44:49,164 --> 01:44:51,406
并不是我的故事
isn't mine to tell.

1207
01:44:55,170 --> 01:45:01,006
维多利亚和我从此以后幸福地生活  
Victoria and I lived happily ever after.

1208
01:45:04,596 --> 01:45:07,169
但不在一起
Just not together.

1209
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:12,052
威尼斯
Venice.

1210
01:45:13,188 --> 01:45:17,185
所以很快  在人们心中
So soon enough, in people's minds,

1211
01:45:17,275 --> 01:45:20,110
卡萨诺瓦又回来了
Casanova was back.

1212
01:45:21,696 --> 01:45:23,356
我这么说吧
If I may say so,

1213
01:45:23,448 --> 01:45:26,982
我相信我干的很称职
I believe I rose worthily to the occasion

1214
01:45:28,369 --> 01:45:33,364
为这个传奇又增添了  不少光辉篇章
and added many glorious chapters to the legend,

1215
01:45:34,584 --> 01:45:38,831
但我又保守了
while I kept the secret

1216
01:45:38,921 --> 01:45:41,247
真爱的秘密
of the true love

1217
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:44,840
从未告诉过别人
of the man who was

1218
01:45:44,927 --> 01:45:47,003
卡萨诺瓦
Casanova.
