1
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,630
10,000 pages.

2
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,310
My life and loves.

3
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,900
That's just about
one woman for every page.

4
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,990
God, I'm tired.

5
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,200
But there is one story
I haven't put down.

6
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,830
Francesca.

7
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,790
That's a story
which isn't mine to tell, really.

8
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,130
So keep it to yourself.

9
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,690
- For how long?
- I don't know how long.

10
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,690
- It's a man, and you're a whore.
- I'm an actress.

11
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,190
What's the difference?

12
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,900
Giacomo.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,540
You be good for your grandmother.

14
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,660
- Now, you know I love you very much.
- Mama.

15
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,960
Listen to me.
Look out there.

16
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,760
Know one day you'll come back to Venice

17
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,600
and I'll return for you.

18
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,050
I promise.

19
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,810
I promise.

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,230
She means when I am dead.

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,690
It's not her fault.
It's in the blood.

22
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,330
A heat for love. Irresistible.

23
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,880
Irresistible.

24
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,860
Sophia, my love!

25
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,870
My husband.

26
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,740
Your husband is the luckiest man in Venice
and doesn't know it.

27
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,820
And it's lucky he's not in Venice.

28
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,380
Sweet darling,
I love you like no other.

29
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,790
You are my dreams come true.

30
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,830
Please, please make love to me again.

31
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,630
Casanova, tell me I'm the only one.

32
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,680
Of course. I always do.

33
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,010
- Darling, I'm home!
- My husband!

34
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,440
I know Casanova well.
It's just like him.

35
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,030
- Has the iceman come yet?
- Yes.

36
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,490
And he comes again tomorrow.

37
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,870
Don't believe what people say.

38
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,290
I don't conquer. I submit.

39
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,370
I've never sought glory as a lover.

40
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,470
Well, what then,
Signor Casanova, do you seek?

41
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,840
A moment that lasts a lifetime.

42
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,350
So, tell me.

43
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,310
This unusual order of nuns you belong to.

44
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,350
Is it a very strict order?

45
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,820
Very. No

46
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,360
jewels or nice clothes before sundown

47
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,870
and back in our cells by...

48
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,000
- Heavens! Is that the time?
- You don't have to go.

49
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,080
I must.
It's been delightful. Only...

50
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,800
Only...

51
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,880
How do I know you're really Casanova?

52
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,800
Yes! Yes!

53
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,890
Casanova.

54
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,770
- The Inquisition is here looking for you.
- No.

55
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,430
Forgive me.

56
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,810
Quick. If they catch you,
they'll hang you.

57
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,660
Giacomo, wait.
Tell me I was the one.

58
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
You are the one.

59
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,040
- You won't forget me, will you?
- No, I could never.

60
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,470
- Casanova. For you.
- Thank you.

61
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,790
- Where is Casanova?
- I've taken a vow of si...

62
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,590
Eternal damnation.
For one night with Casanova.

63
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,470
Seems fair.

64
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,910
We've got him.

65
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,290
Come on.

66
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,730
...hours of study by respected thinkers
of our time, including myself.

67
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,740
I'm not old-fashioned in this matter.

68
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,950
I do not say a woman's place
is at the hearth and in the bed.

69
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,570
What I do say...
Of course it is their place.

70
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,200
What I do say
is let them be educated at home.

71
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,700
On the higher planes
of science and philosophy,

72
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
women serve only to distract us,

73
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,140
to bring us down
to our earthly appetites.

74
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:30,010
So I say no woman shall ever
set foot inside this university.

75
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,890
Let my opponent take the floor.

76
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,230
And now Dr Giordano of Padua.

77
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,540
- Too late, gentlemen.
- Silence!

78
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,410
Let me show you
who is bringing whom down to earth.

79
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,830
A woman is air and fire
and lightness and strength.

80
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,670
Like this little vessel

81
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,800
that would rise up to heaven
were it not held down by ballast -

82
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,840
bags of sand.

83
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,680
The dead weight of men
with their heads full of sand.

84
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,020
Only a woman would argue
by this demonstration of a toy.

85
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,980
It would never strike the superior intellect
of a man, or I'll eat my words.

86
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:23,780
Eat these briefs, signor, for these are the
words of the philosopher Bernardo Guardi,

87
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,020
who was said to live in this very city.

88
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Bernardo Guardi. That madman.

89
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,910
Wait until the Inquisition
catches up with him.

90
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,740
Call him a madman,

91
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,040
but he has more understanding of women
than any man in this room.

92
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,960
And I'll wager he has better luck
with them in bed as well.

93
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,590
Strumpet.

94
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,880
There he is! Over there!

95
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,340
Stop him!

96
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,030
Hold him!

97
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,700
Gentlemen, my apologies.

98
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,540
You see?

99
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,300
The dead weight of men.

100
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,130
But I didn't know
what was happening. He...

101
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,210
He bewitched me.

102
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,920
He said he was the Holy Ghost.

103
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,010
And it's happened before.

104
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,230
You are charged with
debauchery, trespass, heresy.

105
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,770
To wit: Fornication with a novice.

106
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,570
Well, she was hardly a novice.

107
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,610
For which the punishment is death
by hanging, tomorrow at dawn.

108
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,960
And this time your admirers in high places
won't be able to help you.

109
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,330
Excuse me, Inquisitor.
The doge.

110
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,790
Dalfonso.

111
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,300
Prince, we were just talking about you.

112
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,670
What brings you here?

113
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,380
- I have a special interest...
- I have a special interest.

114
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,770
This time the prisoner has been
condemned on the evidence of a nun.

115
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,600
A special interest in your witness.

116
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,940
- Sister Beatrice?
- I need a word.

117
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,950
For God's sake,
don't you know who she is?

118
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,330
- Who?
- Cardinal Lopresta's mistress in waiting.

119
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,500
He entrusted me with safeguarding
her virginity for him alone.

120
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,670
She's leaving for Rome today.

121
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,460
Your witness
is Cardinal Lopresta's sister, Beatrice.

122
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,680
His sister? Oh, God!
Those Romans.

123
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,220
Think about it, Father Dalfonso.

124
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,810
Who's going to get the blame
for dragging her into the Casanova affair?

125
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,650
Take your time.

126
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,530
Me?

127
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,990
Signor Casanova, this seems to be
another case of mistaken identity.

128
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,410
You are free to go.

129
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,460
You know I'm your friend,
but I'm being threatened by Rome.

130
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,830
Venice, I'm afraid,
is perceived as a hotbed of...

131
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,260
Well, as one enormous hot bed

132
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,090
with silk sheets and heretical books
under the mattress.

133
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,810
The people here are given over to
physical pleasure and scepticism.

134
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,780
Do not abuse my sympathy
for you, Casanova.

135
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,910
I'm expelling you from Venice.

136
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,580
Your Excellency, I worship beauty.
There's no harm in that, is there?

137
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,510
- Worship it in Paris, London.
- I can't leave Venice.

138
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,670
- Why?
- I'm waiting for someone.

139
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,640
- She may let you down.
- No. She promised she'll come one day.

140
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,930
You don't understand.

141
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,050
I'm expelling you from Venice
for your own good.

142
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,300
- Unless...
- Unless what?

143
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,850
Unless you find yourself a respectable wife.

144
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,730
A good woman from a good family
will give you protection.

145
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
A wife?

146
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,150
It will soon be the time of Carnevale
when authority winks at our indiscretions.

147
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,410
- You're bad enough during Lent.
- But Carnival's in a few days.

148
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,280
You better not waste any more time then.

149
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,450
- Meanwhile, you're on good behaviour.
- A wife?

150
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,540
- No scandals...
- Getting married?

151
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,500
...duels, drunken escapades.

152
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,590
Morning, Lupo.

153
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,270
- We were worried about us.
- You were right to be.

154
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,810
- We're getting married.
- Congratulations. To whom?

155
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,940
Don't know yet.
Any callers?

156
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,030
Landlord, tailor, wine merchant,
usual creditors.

157
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,610
Look at the state of us.
Where have you been all night?

158
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,410
It's like being married already.

159
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,990
Can you get me some fresh clothes?
We have some shopping to do.

160
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,700
- The Contessa Morelli-D'Aosta.
- Yes, yes, yes. Oh, but, no, she snores.

161
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,750
Yes, I remember.
Lady Veronique Costello.

162
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,000
- Heavenly.
- Yeah.

163
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,430
- Duchess of Urfe.
- Yes.

164
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,350
- But didn't she poison her husband?
- Did she? I don't remember that.

165
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,890
Ah, Giulietta Badalamente.

166
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,560
Sadly, she hasn't
poisoned her husband yet.

167
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,610
Perhaps if we told us
what we're looking for.

168
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,060
I don't know. Beauty, modesty.

169
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,780
- Purity.
- All that.

170
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,660
Lupo. We have had a vision.

171
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,970
Still spying on your virgin?

172
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,890
She'll never look this way
if you don't make yourself known.

173
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,680
The whole town's talking about it.

174
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,480
It's just appalling.

175
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,270
You think those men liked hearing
they're no good in bed?

176
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,820
If they wanted that,
they'd go home to their wives.

177
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,820
Francesca, arrogance
in a woman is not attractive.

178
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,400
She's not arrogant.
She's just angry.

179
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,780
- Fruit, sir?
- Don't defend your sister.

180
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,370
It's true. She knows
she's smarter than most men,

181
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,580
which makes men pretend to be superior,

182
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,170
which makes her angry,
which is seen as arrogance.

183
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,960
Giovanni, come away from the window.
Our neighbours'll think you're a gargoyle.

184
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,920
No, Vittorio. Over there.

185
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,850
Francesca, this is a very important week as
you well know. You have responsibilities.

186
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,720
In a few days, thanks to you,
I won't be poor any more.

187
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,690
Much thanks to your father

188
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,690
who had the foresight to betroth her
to his rich cousin's eldest son in Genoa.

189
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,910
Listen to this.
"Mystery transvestite at university

190
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,120
overturns laws of gravity,

191
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
conjures devil from the air,

192
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,280
nearly starts fire."

193
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,160
God. Can't they get anything right?

194
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,460
Be thankful. I told you I'd not permit
another scandalous display at the university.

195
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,500
- There's too much at stake.
- Mother, I don't want to marry him.

196
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,220
- Please. I'll be damned if I do.
- Well, if you won't, I will.

197
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,560
That's funny, is it?

198
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,520
Well, I'm damned to be widowed
and gathering dust.

199
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,440
Mother.

200
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,400
Well done.

201
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,780
I know why you're like this
about your fiance.

202
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,020
- Why I'm like what?
- Come on.

203
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,790
You're always slipping away in secret.

204
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,660
And you're thin.

205
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,790
It's obvious
you've already got a secret lover.

206
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,170
Well, don't tell.

207
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,190
Hello. A gift for your daughter.

208
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,530
I don't know what to say.
Thank you. It's magnificent.

209
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,530
But you don't know my daughter
and she doesn't know you.

210
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,110
Yes. But I know her reputation,
Signor Donato.

211
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,740
And everybody knows yours,
Signor Casanova.

212
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,620
I've always wondered
what you look like.

213
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,750
Quite ordinary, I can see that.

214
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,670
Well, how can I put this?

215
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,670
Victoria is that rare thing -
a Venetian virgin.

216
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,130
Yes, one hears of them,
but invariably it turns out that...

217
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,140
I am sorry. Do go on.

218
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,680
Thank you.
She's led a very protected life.

219
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,230
Never has an impure thought
crossed her mind.

220
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,350
Of course not.

221
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,770
She's never been alone in a room with a
man, or even seen a man without his coat.

222
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,440
I've made sure of that.

223
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,480
There isn't anything I wouldn't do
to ensure her happy innocence.

224
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,410
- She should be in a nunnery, but...
- Heaven forbid.

225
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,530
- Exactly. One hears things.
- Yes.

226
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,620
On the other hand,
there is you, Signor Casanova,

227
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,580
the most notorious lover
of women in Venice,

228
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,890
reputed to have the longest list
of conquests ever known.

229
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,670
A virtuoso of the intimate caress.

230
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,840
The maestro of multiple...

231
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,520
- What was that?
- I will come to love her, Signor Donato.

232
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,980
It's out of the question.
Your idea of love is sensuality,

233
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,280
to reduce women to quivering puddles of...

234
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,200
Victoria!

235
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,240
Are you all right?

236
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,830
I want him. I want him.
Please, please, Papa.

237
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,040
I'll never be happy without him.

238
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,740
- Congratulations. We're engaged.
- We are a marvel.

239
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,570
- I mean, actually getting married?
- Yes.

240
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,620
You have sullied my glove.

241
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,620
I mean, love. My love.

242
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,790
- I'm sorry. What did he just call us?
- We didn't sully it. It came out of nowhere.

243
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,420
Thank you.
You've sullied my love.

244
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,130
Victoria Donato is my fiancee.

245
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,680
- Is she?
- Yes.

246
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,090
- In the sense that I'm going to marry her.
- Well, she never mentioned that.

247
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,310
Of course she didn't.
I haven't asked her yet.

248
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,390
Wha...?

249
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,610
Here, sir.

250
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,780
What, are you two
working together now? Lupo.

251
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,520
San Cremori at dawn.

252
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,150
Listen. We decline to fight you, dear sir.

253
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,080
- You coward.
- We happen to be on good behaviour.

254
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,160
You have no right to decline
to defend your honour.

255
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,960
It's our honour, so we have the right.

256
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,750
He who gets slapped has his rights.
Those are the rules.

257
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,410
See?

258
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,880
- Now, what did we do that for?
- I don't know.

259
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,430
San Cremori at dawn.

260
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,890
May I know of whom
I have the honour to be killing?

261
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,470
Lupo Salvato.

262
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,430
Thank you.

263
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,640
- Don't forget your glove.
- Thank you.

264
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,640
Surely we don't mean...

265
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,860
What's this "we"?
You slapped him. You fight him.

266
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,240
I see you're not laughing now.

267
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,850
Come on!

268
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,400
The apple is very distracting.

269
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,570
It's all right. I'll fight him.

270
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,060
I can be Lupo Salvato.

271
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,910
Bastard!

272
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,700
Signor Salvato.

273
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,790
Oh, dear.

274
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,880
This gentleman is here to explain
the terms of the duel and to see fair play.

275
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,810
- Very good.
- Your attention, please, gentlemen.

276
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,180
Stay behind the line until I give the word.

277
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:34,480
If one trips or falls, the other puts up
his sword until I say "continue".

278
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,560
Yes.

279
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,480
If a sword breaks,
your second hands you the spare sword.

280
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,860
- Do we have a spare sword?
- Yeah, we do.

281
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,870
First blood ends the duel.

282
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,810
Master!

283
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,170
Move. Go on.

284
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,130
Master!

285
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,010
It's the old switch game.

286
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,910
You'd have killed him.

287
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,400
And you are?

288
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,080
Francesca Bruni.
He's my brother.

289
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,500
- I'll take that, sir.
- Sorry, Signor Salvato.

290
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,260
I should think you would be sorry.

291
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,670
- It was all a case of mistaken identity.
- Mistaken identity?

292
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,630
Giovanni got it into his head
you were courting Signorina Donato.

293
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
- Did he?
- It's all over Venice.

294
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,760
The famously virginal Victoria Donato is
gonna marry the infamous rake, Casanova.

295
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,810
- Do you know him?
- Casanova. The philosopher,

296
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,400
who devotes his life to the perfection
of experience? Yes, I know him.

297
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,820
No. Casanova the libertine
who devotes his life to seducing women.

298
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,040
Well, we're obviously
talking about the same person.

299
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,650
There must be something deeply wrong
with a man like that, don't you think?

300
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,750
Something missing in his life.
True love, perhaps.

301
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,670
All love is true in different ways.

302
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,920
To say "I love falsely" is as self-
contradictory as saying "I believe falsely".

303
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,550
You are a philosopher, too.

304
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,350
I've spent countless hours
alone with Casanova,

305
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,680
pondering the ways of love and
how it makes us at one with the angels.

306
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,100
And with the beasts.

307
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,860
I will not debate with you
if you take the side of a man

308
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,640
whose idea of love
demands a female sacrifice every day.

309
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,570
I've no sympathy for women who think no
better of themselves than to be a plaything.

310
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:38,540
You tell your friend from me that what
he imagines to be love is, in fact, self-love.

311
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,500
And self-love is self-doubt.

312
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,130
- Well said.
- Yes.

313
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,750
By the philosopher Bernardo Guardi.
You should read him, Signor Salvato.

314
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,460
- Clearly.
- Give me a man who is man enough

315
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,300
to give himself just to the woman
who is worth him.

316
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,930
If that woman were me,
I would love him alone and forever.

317
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,250
Goodbye, Signor Salvato.

318
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,800
If fighting continued, one of us
would have had good cause to be sorry.

319
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,130
The one still standing, I think.

320
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,970
Francesca Bruni.

321
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,350
- I want my money!
- Next week, without fail.

322
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,760
- You said that last week!
- I was a week early.

323
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,770
- Go to hell.
- I'll see you there. Thank you so much.

324
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,770
Honestly. Why, the nerve!

325
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,980
Can you believe this man?
I mean

326
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,490
does he know who we are?

327
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,740
He should be honoured
to be owed money by the likes of us.

328
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,830
- Lupo.
- What?

329
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,750
I've made a terrible mistake.

330
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,870
- You have?
- Yes.

331
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,960
I have to find her.

332
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,770
Master, I'm a little confused.

333
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,650
- I thought we'd made our decision.
- Yes, I know.

334
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,700
Francesca!
He's arriving tomorrow.

335
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,910
Your fiance.

336
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,830
She has a fiance.

337
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,290
Well, so do you.

338
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,710
- Giovanni.
- Good day, Mario. How are you?

339
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,550
- I'm sorry.
- Giovanni, more disgrace.

340
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,970
- Allow me.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

341
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,970
Mama, this is Signor Salvato.

342
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,730
I understand you've had an unpleasant
encounter with my son this morning.

343
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,450
It was nothing more strenuous
than a morning's constitutional.

344
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,740
Come along.

345
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,910
Sorry.

346
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,030
- Your sister has a fiance?
- She's in love with Casanova.

347
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,330
- Who is?
- Victoria.

348
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,080
- My love. Remember?
- Oh, yes.

349
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,170
- Engaged to Casanova.
- Yes.

350
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,750
Well, you'll have to beat him
at his own game.

351
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,630
But how? I'm up against a world-class seducer.

352
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,060
- Hello.
- So? What would Casanova do?

353
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,600
- I don't know. What would Casanova do?
- Well, to start, he wouldn't mope around.

354
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,180
- No, I suppose not.
- Misery is not attractive.

355
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,900
If you want to be loved,
you have to be worth loving.

356
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,740
That's the first rule.
And second

357
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,830
be the flame, not the moth.

358
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,660
- The flame, ot the moth.
- Yes.

359
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,240
It's my to gue. Got very loud.

360
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,670
So, your sister, is she happy
with this ew fia cé of hers?

361
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,910
No. She's never met him.

362
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,170
- Really?
- Besides, she has a secret lover.

363
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,210
- A secret lover?
- Yeah.

364
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,970
- Who?
- Well, I do 't k ow. It's a secret.

365
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,400
A yway, she's always s
eaki g off i the... See?

366
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
I'm sorry.

367
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Lupo, there she is.

368
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,840
Casanova.

369
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,350
We are buying Victoria's trousseau.

370
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,180
Only three days to go before the wedding.

371
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,940
Casanova.

372
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,690
No intercourse before the wedding.
I'm a traditionalist.

373
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,870
I mean social intercourse, of course.

374
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,740
Paolo. Paolo, let us off.

375
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,100
A secret lover.

376
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,940
He's going to bang her to pieces.

377
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,780
From Rome.

378
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,540
The Inquisitor's office.

379
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,960
"A cesspit of heresy and fornication."

380
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,790
Surely not...
Oh, they mean us.

381
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,250
127 complaints against Signor Casanova.
Do we know him?

382
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:26,800
You'll see there are suspicions Casanova
enjoys the protection of this very office.

383
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,720
That's absolutely rid...

384
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,530
It's either his neck or it's ours.

385
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,480
It better be his.
Get me my notebook.

386
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,850
Oh, dear.

387
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,200
She's completely worn him out.

388
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,740
I found his name.

389
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,120
He's a writer.

390
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,260
"The Subjugation of Women
by Bernardo Guardi."

391
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,750
No wonder. He's entered her head
and her heart as well.

392
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:53,180
"Here we live in the midst of masculine
domination and what be the result?"

393
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,640
"Half the population
is missing from the feast?"

394
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,770
"You have no right to property
and government, nay, not an opinion...

395
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,690
"If ever a man wants to have
a woman fall in love with him,

396
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,280
all he need to say...

397
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,410
"All he need to say is,

398
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,820
'I have too long dominated
the conversation. What are..."'

399
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,040
...your thoughts on the matter?
What are your thoughts?

400
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,960
- Meat? I'm the tailor!
- So you are. Forgive me.

401
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,460
Thank you, sir.

402
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,750
What are...
What are your thoughts on the matter?

403
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,250
My thoughts?
Well, I'd say...

404
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,630
No, Lupo. I'm...
Could I have some tea?

405
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,920
Of course.

406
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,600
Mother, my fiance is turning up tomorrow.
What shall I do?

407
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,890
It's simple. Do your duty.

408
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,610
Is it my duty to marry a man
that I don't know just because he's rich?

409
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,940
Yes, it is. Your duty to your father
who had your best interest at heart.

410
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,730
Marriage is a safe haven, my darling.

411
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,150
And love?

412
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,240
Love?

413
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,160
Love is something else.

414
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,960
It's the weather being good every day,

415
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:11,880
because wind and rain
are just another kind of good weather.

416
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,590
That's love.

417
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,640
Perhaps when you see him,
you'll fall in love with your husband.

418
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,680
He's not my husband yet.

419
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,900
If you go against your father's wishes,
we'll continue living in debt,

420
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,610
at the mercy of everyone we owe.

421
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,320
- But if you honour the betrothal...
- The contract.

422
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,080
The betrothal

423
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,240
then our troubles will be over.

424
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,990
It's between you and your conscience.

425
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,810
Amen.

426
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,740
- Signor Salvato.
- I do come here to make confession.

427
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,280
- What are you doing?
- What am I here to confess?

428
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,210
Well, let's see.

429
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,910
Jealousy.

430
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,960
Pride.

431
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,880
Covetousness.

432
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,960
Despair.

433
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,510
And you?

434
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,390
I came to prepare my soul for marriage.

435
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,780
You're troubled, Signorina Bruni.

436
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,030
My troubles are nothing to you, signor,
and little enough to me.

437
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,080
To be bartered in marriage
is no small thing,

438
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,780
especially for a woman
of independent mind.

439
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,420
I see my brother's tongue wags again.
In future he can fight his own duels.

440
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,340
- You can't come in.
- It's all right. I'm a doctor.

441
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,920
You're not Casanova?

442
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,500
o. I can prove it
if you'll show me your chest.

443
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,880
- Are you often in church?
- I followed you.

444
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,720
Surely it is your friend Casanova
for whom fiancees add spice to the pursuit.

445
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,300
If you knew him,
you wouldn't be so quick to condemn him.

446
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,600
If you understood women,
you would not be so quick to defend him.

447
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,100
Love is not an affair of a night or a fortnight.

448
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,900
And true love doesn't grow
with the number of lovers. It wastes away.

449
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,700
- Where's your instrument?
- I'll get it out in a minute.

450
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,950
But you can't blame those
who seek love wherever they can.

451
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,410
Perhaps it's merely the murmur of the flesh
that hasn't known the flutter of the heart,

452
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,290
meant for an evening but not a lifetime.

453
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,720
But can't that still be love all the same?

454
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,510
It seems you're trying
to woo me, Signor Salvato,

455
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,090
by offering to make me
a notch on your bedpost.

456
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,390
Come now, we are speaking of Casanova,
and I am a different man.

457
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,060
You see, Casanova couldn't understand

458
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,730
that of all the ways love can be true, there...

459
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,230
there is one way.

460
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,700
And that way is the sum of all the others.

461
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,670
Now, I've too long
dominated the conversation.

462
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,710
What are your thoughts on the matter?

463
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,270
- What did you just say?
- What?

464
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,870
- I'm in hell.
- I'm busy.

465
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,460
Another note to your lover?
I'd tell him it's all over if I was you.

466
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,080
Go away.
I'm marrying Papprizzio.

467
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,340
- What did I do?
- Somebody came here

468
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,050
who wanted to read your latest pamphlet
before publication.

469
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,010
- What?
- Did you show someone my work?

470
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,720
I didn't show anyone anything, on the
memory of your father, whom I served well.

471
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,680
Until he fired you for stealing.

472
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,760
- Where's the manuscript?
- I took it to the printer's like I always do.

473
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,940
You write, I get it printed under my name,
I take the commission.

474
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,610
Everyone's happy except the priests.

475
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,320
- These new shoes, Guardi?
- Church gave them to me. They don't fit.

476
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,740
Don't lie.

477
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,750
This is an addition to page five.
Take it to the printer's.

478
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,120
Nobody came. Nobody bribed me.
Would I be sober if they had?

479
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,720
That's him.

480
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,400
- Here. Add this to chapter one.
- Thank you.

481
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:43,000
Guardi says, "Why should women lace
themselves out of their natural shape?"

482
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,710
- Casanova.
- Signorina.

483
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,420
I left my window open.

484
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,210
My darling, I have so many windows
and so little time.

485
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,190
Burn our corsets.

486
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,920
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. Forgive me. It was an involuntary...

487
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,710
Please let me help you.

488
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:22,410
"In the heart of every woman,
there is room for a pet."

489
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,180
"Dogs and cats provide
solace and affection."

490
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,470
"How rare is the man who knows
that the pet of choice for today's woman

491
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,470
is the intelligent and noble pig!"

492
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,980
- A pig?
- I'll pay for the damage. I'm well-endowed.

493
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,190
If you get my... I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

494
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,570
Will you tell your lady
that Signor Salvato is here with a gift?

495
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,170
My mistress says the pig cannot come in.

496
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,840
But the animal we'll take.

497
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,670
I have news about the fiance.
His name is Papprizzio.

498
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,760
He's from Genoa.
He's arriving at noon.

499
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,630
He's rich.

500
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,840
Of course he is.

501
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,300
Everything's turning
against us these days, Lupo.

502
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,770
- How much do we owe?
- About 1500 lira.

503
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,740
Lay out our second-best suit, Lupo.

504
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,810
Who owns this tub?

505
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,520
I do, sir.

506
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,650
And I'm Pietro Papprizzio,
merchant of Genoa.

507
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,490
- And what's your cargo?
- Lard.

508
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,650
- Lard?
- Finest in the world.

509
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,750
- Tell him, Fulvio. Tell him.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,710
Tub of lard.

511
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,620
Do you mean to tell me you've never
heard of my lard? We'll have to fix that.

512
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:14,000
I want to see one of these posters on every
canal, street, water corner by morning.

513
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,890
- Understand?
- Sign here.

514
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,060
Signor Papprizzio?

515
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,980
- At your service, sir.
- On the contrary, I'm at yours.

516
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,480
The family of your fiancee sent me here to
greet you and to send you to your palazzo.

517
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,150
But palazzo?
I have a reservation at the Hotel Grifasi.

518
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,730
They didn't tell you?
The Grifasi is closed.

519
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,650
- Really? Why?
- Lupo.

520
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,870
- Rising damp, sir.
- Rising damp, indeed.

521
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,650
Palazzo, eh?
Well, lead on.

522
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:51,840
- My servant shall see to your baggage.
- I think you have everything under control.

523
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,840
The first thing I'm going to do

524
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,930
is call upon my betrothed

525
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,390
after I make myself presentable, of course.

526
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,230
Yes. And how long does that usually take?

527
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,980
"Casanova bought a pig."

528
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,690
"Casanova took the pig
to the Bruni house."

529
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,870
Clear it. Everything.

530
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,880
I'll take that.

531
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,460
Your Grace.

532
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:03,360
Inquisitore Dalfonso,
I am Bishop Pucci.

533
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,740
Oh, Bishop...

534
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,450
I have been instructed to relieve you
of your duties here in Venice.

535
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,750
To say that the pope is less than happy
with your rate of progress

536
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,710
is an understatement
of monumental proportions.

537
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,290
You and your entire staff

538
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,960
have been reassigned
to open a mission among the natives of

539
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,220
the equatorial region.

540
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,800
What kind of natives?

541
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:37,730
Let us just say, shall we,
they have a great hunger for religion.

542
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,950
So this place belonged
to the libertine Casanova, eh?

543
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,370
Yes, but he ran out on his debts, so

544
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,500
we got the villa at a very reasonable price.

545
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,750
Really? How reasonable?

546
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,090
Lupo?

547
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,420
- 1,600 lira.
- Yes.

548
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,390
- Get a receipt.
- Of course.

549
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,430
Do I get a bath for my 1,600 lira?

550
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,770
"Casanova bought a pig?"

551
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,940
"Casanova took pig to Bruni house."

552
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,730
"Casanova met with Papprizzio
at dockside."

553
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:30,580
"Took Papprizzio to his house."

554
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:35,790
Is there anybody here
who can explain this?

555
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,500
You sent them all away to be eaten.

556
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:43,590
Well, then we shall have to do
some footwork ourselves.

557
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,760
Papprizzio?
The pork fat mogul from Genoa?

558
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,470
We're here to discover
heresy and criminal licentiousness.

559
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,150
If there's bacon involved,
I dread to imagine the depths of depravity

560
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,810
we're going to find here in Venice.

561
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:04,730
I'm surprised,
but I have a good feeling about this city.

562
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,910
- Do you?
- There's a massive market for lard here,

563
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:12,700
and I plan to use a good old bit
of Genoan know-how to penetrate it.

564
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,960
- Good thinking.
- Handbills, newspapers.

565
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,620
- That's just what Venice is missing.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

566
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:25,010
- You have to keep an eye for that servant.
- What? He's gone out.

567
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,880
- He's gone out where?
- How am I supposed to know?

568
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:36,520
I've arranged a trinket for my beloved 
- Na little wedding present for my bride-to-be.

569
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,730
Would you like
an advanced demonstration?

570
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,390
Yes, please.

571
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,360
- It's very...
- That's wonderful. Exquisite.

572
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,290
Really. Yeah.

573
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,360
Who is it?

574
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,550
Was that him?

575
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:22,360
How am I supposed to know that?

576
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:29,480
What are we looking for?

577
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,780
I don't know.
Something. Anything.

578
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,750
I found the house, sir.
Signora Bruni and her daughter

579
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,920
request the pleasure
of your company for tea.

580
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:53,970
Good. Good.

581
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,720
The chartreuse then, I think, Fulvio.

582
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,720
Right away, Master.

583
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:06,940
I'm certainly looking forward to seeing her.

584
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,190
Hope that she's

585
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,270
not disappointed by me.

586
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,120
Hope that she doesn't think I'm...
I don't know.

587
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,330
What's the... What's the word?
The expression I'm looking for?

588
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,080
- Rotund?
- Excuse me. What did you say?

589
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,750
Would sir require
a small snack before tea?

590
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:33,010
Well, do you see that trunk
shaped vaguely like a salami?

591
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,300
- Yes.
- It's filled with salami.

592
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,640
- There you are.
- Yes.

593
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,020
- Now, very impressive.
- Thank you.

594
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:54,610
- The choice of lime is very slimming.
- You're too kind.

595
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,070
I must be off.
Didn't I have an appointment?

596
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,790
What? Oh. The publisher.

597
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,780
That was it.
To see how my new book is doing.

598
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,070
You're a writer.

599
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,490
- I've been known to scribble a bit.
- Bravo.

600
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:08,170
My master's a famous writer
of love and how to please ladies.

601
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,050
You've heard of Bernardo Guardi...

602
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,420
- Lupo, hush.
- But he's a friend.

603
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,170
- I'm so sorry.
- Bernardo Guardi?

604
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,710
- I can't believe it.
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

605
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,720
You, sir, are Bernardo Guardi?

606
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:25,100
That's my nom de plume.
But you must swear to tell no one.

607
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,730
I swear.
On my honour, sir.

608
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,030
My solemn vow.
Bernardo Guardi.

609
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,320
Fulvio, this will need some thinking about.

610
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,250
Yes, it does.
It's my great honour, sir.

611
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,080
Look at me.

612
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:48,740
I am.

613
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,040
Now look at that.

614
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,680
Yes, in truth, it is not an exact likeness, no.

615
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:03,550
Yeah. In Genoa, we call it advertising.

616
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,560
Yes. Fine. But so what of it?
If she loves you as you are...

617
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,470
She's never seen me.

618
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,270
- Not even a glimpse.
- Really?

619
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:19,160
Yes. Oh, dear, Master Guardi.
Take me under your tutelage, I beg you.

620
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,860
I'll pay you handsomely.
Whatever you like, I'll pay it.

621
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,450
You want me to tutor you?

622
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,290
I want you to transform me.
Transform me.

623
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,630
My dear man, but you have but an hour
until you must you meet her.

624
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:34,290
I don't want to go.
You can't make me go.

625
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,720
As it happens,
my new book, which isn't out yet,

626
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,680
deals with the outer man.

627
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:48,810
You see, the relation between the physical
and the spiritual is little understood.

628
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,810
Except by me, of course.

629
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,200
- Master Guardi.
- Yes?

630
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,740
Can you make me look like that?

631
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,490
- Yes, I can.
- Oh, God.

632
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,990
But it will take courage.
It will take time.

633
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,080
- Long confinement to this villa.
- Courage. Yes.

634
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,710
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

635
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,660
Fulvio. I will send my servant Fulvio
to the house of Bruni with a note.

636
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,090
- No need. I will pass that way myself.
- Oh, excellent.

637
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,670
Can we start? I want to start right now.

638
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,760
Lupo.

639
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,930
Lovely.

640
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:37,110
Giovanni! Signor Papprizzio
is expected at any moment.

641
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:45,240
Signor Salvato.

642
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,870
Vittorio, tell Signor Salvato
I am not at home.

643
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:59,170
Now, how strange.
I'm sure that I was invited to tea.

644
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,590
- You were?
- We're not having tea.

645
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,640
Forgive me.
I must have forgotten an invitation.

646
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,800
- You told my servant, I believe.
- We were expecting Francesca's fiance.

647
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,770
Indeed. And here he is.

648
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,280
Ladies, forgive me. It is time I presented
myself under my true colours.

649
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,110
Signorina Bruni,
my name is not Salvato.

650
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:27,110
You see before you
your most devoted and fortunate fiance,

651
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,200
Pietro Papprizzio,
all the way from Genoa.

652
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,830
Signor Papprizzio.

653
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,170
All the young women I met back in Genoa
concealed their true natures from me,

654
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,800
dazzled by dreams of an empire of pork.

655
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,720
They looked at me
and they saw a mountain of lard.

656
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,640
No, no, no. Not at all.

657
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,600
If anything, you need fattening up.

658
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,770
I don't like thin men.
Francesca's father was enormous.

659
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,320
Never the less, I remained true
to the fiancee that I'd never seen.

660
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:08,110
But I wanted to make sure before I declared
myself she likewise had kept herself for me

661
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,650
and hadn't been seduced by the first
charmer that came along with a...

662
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,160
Pig.

663
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:20,670
Perhaps you are the charmer
you warned me against, signor.

664
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,550
I'm engaged to be married,
and so far all I know about you is...

665
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,760
Perhaps you remember sending me this.

666
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:33,600
"To Pietro Papprizzio
from Francesca Bruni,

667
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,440
with my hopes."

668
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:44,690
Perhaps I should've brought
the other letters you wrote me.

669
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,960
The only desire I have
is that you'll come to love me.

670
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:10,500
And if you cannot or if there is someone
else for whom your heart beats in secret,

671
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,640
I shall release you from your engagement.

672
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,050
There isn't! There isn't.

673
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,810
His Eminence, Bishop Pucci.

674
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:31,030
- Perhaps I've come at a bad time.
- No. No, Your Excellency. We're delighted.

675
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,370
I should have sent word,
but since I've just arrived in Venice

676
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:39,410
and as your husband, the late ambassador,
was so regarded by the Holy See,

677
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,710
the pope was anxious to be remembered.

678
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,420
Allow me to introduce
my son-in-law-to-be Signor Papprizzio.

679
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:52,430
- Signor Papprizzio.
- Bishop.

680
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,140
- My daughter Francesca.
- My dear.

681
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,760
What is the pope's most feared inquisitor
doing in Venice, Bishop Pucci?

682
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:59,850
Francesca...

683
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,690
No, no. I'm delighted that 
my reputation precedes me.

684
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,450
The Vatican sent me
to deal with moral problems.

685
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:11,690
- What kind of moral problems, Bishop?
- The usual. Fornication, heresy.

686
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,820
How exactly does
the Church define heresy?

687
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,150
Francesca!

688
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,580
I hardly think heresy
is a fit conversation for a young lady.

689
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:23,620
Why? Can't we be heretics?

690
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:28,920
I think my fiancee, Bishop Pucci,
wishes to learn more from you perhaps.

691
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,340
If you please.

692
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,760
Very well.

693
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:38,640
Heresy is an affront
to the teachings of the Church.

694
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:42,600
It is a rebellion against
our mores and our morals.

695
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,470
More to the point,
and you will understand this,

696
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,900
since you are a woman
and understand women's ways,

697
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,160
hence the concept of "whim",

698
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,740
heresy is whatever I say it is.

699
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,830
For example, that writer fellow,
Bernardo Guardi, he is a heretic.

700
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,580
And why is that?

701
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,120
Vittorio, where is the tea?

702
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:14,050
Guardi's words
cause women to feel dissatisfied

703
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,010
- and men to doubt their manhood.
- Really?

704
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,980
If you are an admirer of this Guardi fellow,
I have some very sad news for you.

705
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,640
He's written out.

706
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,770
My colleagues are scouring
the streets for him as we speak.

707
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,730
I'm so sorry.

708
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:39,570
- Bishop, will you take tea?
- Thank you, no. I have people to see.

709
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,690
Signorina Bruni.

710
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:50,450
May I have the honour
of accompanying you to the carnival ball?

711
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,710
But I've done nothing wrong.

712
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,510
I'm innocent!
You've got the wrong man! Let me go!

713
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,960
Come on. Come on.

714
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,440
I have an urgent message for you
from Bernardo Guardi.

715
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,100
Who are you?

716
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:23,600
Never mind. The Chief Inquisitor from
Rome is here and he is out for blood.

717
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,200
- Delay publishing the new pamphlet.
- You're a little late.

718
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,520
Oh, my God. Stop selling it.

719
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,540
- Sorry.
- That's what it says. The pig.

720
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:36,240
- Well, I've always owned pigs.
- Oh, tit.

721
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:51,970
Right.

722
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:56,430
Now, make sure it's ready
in time for the ball.

723
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,100
Ah. Master.

724
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:01,690
- How's the treatment going?
- Well...

725
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,100
- Is he any better?
- Yeah, well...

726
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:07,230
It's impossible he could look any worse.

727
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,110
Is that you, Maestro?
Maestro Guardi, is that you?

728
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,200
- Hello. Who's there?
- Good God. You achieved the impossible.

729
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,830
- Thank you.
- What have you smeared all over him?

730
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,080
- Lard, mostly. Mint jelly.
- Hello?

731
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,120
- A few coffee grounds.
- Yes. Coffee grounds. Well done.

732
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:25,960
- Signore.
- Is it you, Maestro?

733
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,670
- Yes, Papprizzio.
- How do I look?

734
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,840
Well, let's see.

735
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:35,640
Yes. That's very good.
It's coming along quite nicely.

736
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,390
I've been asking your man for a mirror.
He can't seem to find one for me.

737
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,690
- Oh, well... Lupo, mirror?
- I can't find one anywhere.

738
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,520
After application of all your techniques,
I'm terribly anxious to check my progress.

739
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,940
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

740
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,900
Oh, there you are, Fulvio. Good man.

741
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,240
God.

742
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,790
It's working.

743
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,370
- It's working, isn't it?
- Yes.

744
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:09,000
- It's working.
- Yes, indeed.

745
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:11,580
You took my regrets, of course,
to the house of Bruni?

746
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,050
Yes.

747
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,340
- Good. Bad weather or some such?
- Yes. Of course I did.

748
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:19,600
What of Francesca? I told her
I'd take her to the carnival ball,

749
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:22,640
but I do think I need just a bit more time.

750
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,900
Yes, I think you're right.
You do need some more time.

751
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,480
- Listen. Don't worry. I'll handle that.
- Good man.

752
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:31,190
You relax.
Lupo, a little more around the belly.

753
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,850
Yes, Lupo. More on the belly.

754
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,290
Signore, Bishop Pucci wishes to see you.

755
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:42,830
Of course.

756
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,830
My name is Bernardo Guardi,
but I'm not the Bernardo Guardi.

757
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,880
Come along now, Bernardo.
There's no shame in being a writer.

758
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:54,380
Let's play a little game, shall we?

759
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,680
I'll read you a sentence and you finish it.

760
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:59,340
"A woman is air and..."

761
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,680
And what, Bernardo?

762
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:06,520
I don't know. Trouble?
No. No.

763
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:08,520
Wind? Air and wind?

764
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:12,610
No. I'll give you a little clue, shall I?

765
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:19,660
It's not the tea I object to.
It's the water.

766
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:25,370
So, Signor Papprizzio,
how well do you know Casanova?

767
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,460
Be careful how you answer.

768
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:33,470
I could become interested in you.

769
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,050
I was less than...

770
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:43,010
I was less than frank at Signora Bruni's.

771
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,680
It is Casanova I have come here to hang.

772
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,730
That fornicator who spits upon
the teachings of the Church.

773
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:54,940
Are you following me? Good. So why
did you go with Casanova to his house?

774
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:57,520
- I'm renting it from him.
- You're renting it?

775
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,400
- It's strictly business, of course.
- Business.

776
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,370
I believe he went
out of town for a day or two.

777
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,610
- Out of town?
- Yes.

778
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,790
Well, if I know anything, he's hardly
likely to absent himself from Carnevale.

779
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:20,430
Signor Papprizzio, if you'd help put an end
to this fornicator's career for good and all,

780
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,600
believe me, the Church
will be very grateful.

781
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,640
How grateful?

782
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,050
The lard concession at the Vatican.

783
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:32,520
Which is a lot of lard.

784
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,890
That's quite an attractive offer.

785
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,110
So we have a deal?

786
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,620
You will help deliver Casanova unto me?

787
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,700
As sure as my name is Papprizzio.

788
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,660
- Excuse me, Your Reverence.
- No.

789
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:50,910
This Bernardo Guardi we're racking,
I don't think he is the heretic.

790
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,870
I think someone is just using his name

791
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,420
- as a nom de plume.
- A nom...

792
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,380
Don't be clever, Andolini.
What do you mean you think?

793
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:01,930
The Inquisition is not paid to think. Be sure!

794
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:06,430
Well, I am pretty sure.
He can't read or write.

795
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:12,230
Lupo! Lupo!

796
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,520
- There is no lover!
- What?

797
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,440
- There is no secret lover.
- What?

798
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:20,740
She never had one.

799
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:29,780
Carnevale.

800
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,600
Talked of pigs all week.

801
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,900
- Darling, have you seen my husband?
- I am your husband.

802
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:09,150
- Any sign of Casanova, sir?
- I don't know what he looks like.

803
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:13,500
But he's bound to be here.
He wouldn't miss the carnival.

804
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,580
Signor Papprizzio.

805
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,670
See? Everybody's here.
We just have to find them.

806
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,670
Victoria?

807
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,710
Victoria!

808
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,510
Good evening, sir.

809
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,770
Signor Pizzani and Signora.

810
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:21,850
You're welcome.

811
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,700
Signor Papprizzio of Genoa
escorting Signorina Bruni.

812
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,780
You're welcome.

813
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:37,870
Signor Dandolo and Signora.

814
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,160
You're welcome.

815
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:49,510
- Signor Papprizzio.
- Mother Bruni.

816
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,920
We must introduce you
to everyone we know.

817
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,560
Yes, this should be interesting.

818
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,930
- Will you do me the honour, signora?
- May I?

819
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,260
- Well, I'm free.
- I...

820
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,310
- Be my guest.
- Watch this.

821
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,570
Signor Casanova,
I have a message from your fiancee.

822
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:12,580
- Ah, which one?
- Signorina Donato.

823
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,250
She's in the piazza.
She's waiting for you to escort her in.

824
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,370
Good Lord!

825
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,010
Come.

826
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:53,450
Don't worry.
You're not my first virgin.

827
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:57,870
- Victoria.
- Casanova.

828
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:07,540
Something is not right.

829
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:11,880
Do we have the address
of Casanova's house?

830
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:15,470
Then I think now is the time
for positive action.

831
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,050
Lord and Lady Devonshire.

832
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:20,690
You're welcome.

833
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,260
Signor Casanova
and Signorina Donato.

834
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,310
Signor Casanova.

835
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:32,560
Enchanting.
I'm so very pleased for you and me.

836
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:36,190
- When's the wedding?
- Soon, Your Grace.

837
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:38,740
You're welcome.

838
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:42,410
Ambassador Gritti and Signora.

839
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,930
- My darling.
- Giacomo, where can we go?

840
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:58,890
- Find somewhere.
- Find somewhere? 
No, no.

841
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,600
- I can't wait any longer.
- Sit down. Very good.

842
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:06,810
Wait here and I'll come back
with a glass of wine.

843
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,400
- Casanova.
- How wonderful to see you.

844
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,580
What are you doing down there? 
No.

845
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,940
There he is.

846
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:51,990
- We danced off our feet.
- You danced off your feet. How lovely.

847
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,950
That's better.

848
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,110
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

849
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,660
- Signore.
- Yea-ah!

850
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:09,960
It's Signor Donato from across the canal.

851
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,090
I just said that.

852
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,300
- May I?
- Please.

853
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:16,420
Thank you.

854
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,850
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just hot.

855
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:25,560
- I didn't see you in church.
- Well, I was there.

856
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:28,050
I know, but I wasn't.

857
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:34,770
- Do you know Signor...
- Yes. I'm the future son-in-law.

858
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:37,190
- That's right.
- Yes!

859
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,650
- Congratulations are in order.
- Yes.

860
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,700
Thank you.

861
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:45,580
No. No, I mean...

862
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:48,620
No. Yes. Congratulations are in order.

863
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,250
I just said that.

864
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,960
Congratulations.
You must be pleased for Victoria.

865
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:00,810
That reminds me.
Have you seen Victoria?

866
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,350
No, no. That's true.

867
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,440
I thought she'd be here
with her... her fiance.

868
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,730
That's true. I haven't seen her anywhere.
I think she's...

869
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:14,690
I had forbidden her to come,
but she has defied me.

870
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,400
- She must have changed.
- She has.

871
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:20,660
I suppose getting engaged
to the famous Casanova

872
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,740
has gone to her head.

873
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:26,580
- What is the matter with this table?
- It's a good table. It's fine.

874
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:30,620
I'm a traditionalist.
No intercourse before the wedding.

875
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:33,630
- Social intercourse.
- There's somebody under the table.

876
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:36,960
- Which table?
- This table!

877
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,800
Is this the palazzo of Signor Casanova?

878
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:50,390
Yes, sir. He's right in here,
Your Excellency.

879
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:04,030
So, Signor Casanova,
not out of town after all, I see.

880
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,370
I find it difficult to believe
this is what women want.

881
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:12,700
Yeah. Here, little piggy.
Come, little piggy.

882
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,370
- Andolini...
- Sir, I think...

883
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:19,420
Don't think. Just do what you do.

884
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,880
Stop the treatment!
I don't like this part of the treatment!

885
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:32,640
- So, what progress?
- He seems confused.

886
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:36,680
Fornication on a massive scale
leads to confusion.

887
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:43,860
- Signor Casanova.
- I'm Papprizzio of Genoa.

888
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:47,570
Unfortunately for you, I am intimately
acquainted with Signor Papprizzio.

889
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:51,000
- I've had tea with him.
- Ask Fulvio.

890
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:55,250
Fulvio, tell him. Tell him, Fulvio.

891
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,050
Sir.

892
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,980
So who is...?

893
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,990
- So you are Papprizzio.
- It's what I've been saying, stupid.

894
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,540
Well, Signor Papprizzio,
maybe you'll tell me the whereabouts

895
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:37,030
of the owner of the palazzo
where you're staying.

896
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:38,540
- Signor...
- Guardi.

897
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:41,340
Signor Bernardo Guardi is my host here.

898
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,760
I'm staying at his place, taking his course.
He designed my treatment.

899
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,170
Do you realise Guardi is a heretic?

900
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,430
Your Reverence,
Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume.

901
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,940
Then if

902
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:58,850
Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume

903
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:02,940
perhaps the plume's nom is

904
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:05,400
Casanova.

905
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:09,950
- Casanova?
- It was staring us in the face all along.

906
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:14,620
The glorification of women, et cetera.
Boring, boring, boring.

907
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:18,620
- Casanova is Bernardo Guardi.
- Bravo, Your Reverence.

908
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:22,050
Good Lord.
He's taken my fiancee to the ball.

909
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:25,250
Not for long, he's not.
Get your men together and come with me.

910
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:28,680
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the ball.

911
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,590
Well, so are we!

912
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:47,520
- You're right. She's here.
- Where?

913
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:51,320
Right over there. See?
You should take her home.

914
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:57,030
- You see, I'm a traditionalist myself.
- Signor Valmarana and Signora.

915
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:58,620
At least someone's made an effort.

916
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:03,420
Excuse me.
I say, at least somebody's made an effort.

917
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:06,590
Now that is purple.

918
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,340
That's not Venetian, is it?
Am I wrong? That is a...

919
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:14,590
London? Paris? Rome?
Is it...

920
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,690
It's almost a papal purple.

921
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,140
It reminds me of something.
Don't tell me.

922
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:25,610
- Inquisitor Pucci.
- Inquisitor Pucci.

923
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:29,110
Yes, I know.
I heard you were in Venice.

924
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:34,530
- Come for a dance?
- I'm here to arrest Giacomo Casanova.

925
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:38,870
Casanova is about to marry
a young woman famous for her modesty.

926
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,790
His slate is wiped clean,
and he's under my protection.

927
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,130
Does your protection extend to heretics?

928
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:49,670
Beware, Doge.
Your city's freedom

929
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,540
dangles from the belt of the Vatican.

930
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:59,760
You're welcome.

931
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:26,540
- Admiral Massimo Canal and Signora.
- You're welcome.

932
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:28,170
Where's Francesca?

933
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:32,090
My name is Pietro Papprizzio
and I'm from Genoa.

934
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,710
What?

935
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:40,770
Signor Papprizzio of Genoa.

936
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:23,260
So you're Papprizzio?

937
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:28,650
From Genoa?

938
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,110
Is your name...

939
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,940
Bruni.

940
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,400
I'm your...

941
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:40,660
I'm your future...

942
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:43,660
I never dreamt you'd be so beautiful.

943
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,580
Me?

944
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,580
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

945
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:53,750
Why...

946
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,890
No. 
No, I'm your future mother-in-law.

947
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:00,590
- My mother-in-law?
- Yes.

948
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:04,680
- I'm not betrothed to you?
- No, to my daughter.

949
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:09,560
Some people find her beautiful.

950
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:14,110
- There's a man who's after her.
- Really? Does she like him?

951
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,810
Signora Bruni, your daughter has been
duped by none other than Casanova.

952
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:19,900
But worry not. He's as good as...

953
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:29,410
Why don't you stop interfering, all right?

954
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,870
Thank you.

955
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,130
Well.

956
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:53,100
Signorina.

957
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:55,730
I was afraid I'd lost you.

958
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,490
As one might lose a pocket watch,
Signor Papprizzio,

959
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:01,690
or some other valuable possession?

960
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:04,570
I know that no man will ever own you.

961
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:08,000
But to be your defender
on the road you travel,

962
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:14,090
to show you the world as you've
never seen it, for that I hold my hopes.

963
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:18,000
Let's start by taking
one step closer to heaven.

964
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:57,910
You get this one here.

965
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,970
Ready. On the count of three.

966
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:02,170
One, two, three.

967
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,370
Witchcraft.

968
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:35,410
Actually, I believe it's because hot air rises,
overcoming the gravitational force of...

969
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,790
Witchcraft.

970
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,670
Here we are.

971
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:55,900
Look! It's Casanova with his new fiancee.

972
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:07,450
Casanova.

973
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:09,360
Come on.

974
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:12,490
Is that Francesca?

975
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:15,580
- It is her.
- That's Francesca.

976
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:19,370
- I've never seen her look so happy.
- Really?

977
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:24,970
Such bad news for you, Signor Papprizzio.

978
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:32,550
O calamity.
She's thrown me over.

979
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:36,860
- Disgraceful.
- Oh, well. A scandal.

980
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:43,600
- You're a free man.
- Oh, dear.

981
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:47,730
What will I do?

982
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:10,090
Thank you, Signor Papprizzio.

983
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:15,470
I'm beginning to believe
that your heart is true.

984
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:20,350
There is more of the lover
than the merchant in you.

985
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,610
Why didn't you tell me
you were my betrothed?

986
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:26,100
You didn't trust me?

987
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,580
Well, why didn't you tell me
you were Bernardo Guardi?

988
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,420
It's all right.
I won't tell anyone.

989
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:47,920
I should've guessed the first time I saw you
in that citadel of male complacency

990
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:52,720
when you were as brave in debate
as you were later in duel.

991
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:00,310
You were Bernardo Guardi
in beauty's mask.

992
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:06,060
I'm in love with you, Francesca.

993
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:14,160
You were at the debate?

994
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,540
Yes. Yes, I was.

995
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:20,870
At the university.

996
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,000
Francesca...

997
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:33,010
Just as you had honest reason
for not telling me who you were,

998
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,470
I, too, have honest reason...

999
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:42,060
What?

1000
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:54,780
I can explain this.

1001
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:58,110
Are you Papprizzio?

1002
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:04,040
Tell me you're Papprizzio, my betrothed.

1003
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,830
Who are you?

1004
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,590
I'm Casanova.

1005
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:19,380
What?

1006
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:23,430
I'm... I'm Giacomo Casanova.

1007
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:29,730
You stand for everything I write against.

1008
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:35,820
- Wasn't that before you knew me?
- I don't know you.

1009
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:38,620
Which one of you?

1010
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:54,670
I think I liked you better in your masks.
At least Salvato was a gentleman.

1011
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:58,840
Papprizzio was promising.
But Casanova, I despise.

1012
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:00,760
You dare to say you love me.

1013
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:06,440
I would save myself for the kind of love
which a man would give his life for.

1014
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,200
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

1015
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:21,740
Casanova.

1016
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:24,700
Signor Casanova.

1017
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:28,660
I'm here to arrest you
as a fornicator, a charlatan,

1018
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:33,800
and, above all, a coward
who hides behind the name of another -

1019
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,670
Signor Bernardo Guardi.

1020
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:44,130
And as Bernardo Guardi,
I arrest you as a heretic.

1021
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:48,180
- What? He's not...
- Yes, signorina, he is.

1022
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:51,640
- He's not...
- Francesca, don't.

1023
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:55,820
No.

1024
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:01,230
I'm Bernardo Guardi.

1025
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:34,520
Bishop Pucci.

1026
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:37,480
How can I help you, my dear?

1027
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:06,590
I was a virgin.

1028
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:11,260
My virginity was
my most cherished possession -

1029
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,560
my gift from God.

1030
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:17,150
My gift was taken from me.

1031
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:21,480
Tragic and most damnable.
What was the name of this vile seducer?

1032
01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:23,820
Giacomo Casanova.

1033
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:31,040
When Casanova came to my room
and robbed me

1034
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:35,280
I fought for my honour.

1035
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:39,840
Are you saying you'd be willing to give me
the testimony that I need to hang him?

1036
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:41,590
Yes.

1037
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,840
But I would worry about my reputation.

1038
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:49,810
Of course. But I think we could say
if everything went according to plan,

1039
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:54,440
we could return your reputation
and your virginity to you.

1040
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,770
- You could do that?
- Oh, yes.

1041
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,900
We are the Catholic Church.
We can do anything.

1042
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:16,830
Excuse me.
When is my turn?

1043
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,840
Give me a man who is man enough

1044
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:26,710
to give himself
just to the woman who is worth him.

1045
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:30,340
And if that woman were me,

1046
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:34,730
I would love him alone and forever.

1047
01:28:25,410 --> 01:28:27,530
Thank you very much.

1048
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,950
- Are you sure I don't owe you anything?
- On the contrary.

1049
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,610
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1050
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:36,450
- Bye.
- Come back.

1051
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:39,540
You're... You're the boy in the window.

1052
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:41,830
Signorina Donato.

1053
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,160
We won't forget you.

1054
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:47,710
You'll be a legend among the girls.

1055
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:52,970
- This is terrible.
- Why?

1056
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,850
I've loved you hopelessly for years.

1057
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:02,980
Why didn't you say?

1058
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:23,420
My Lord, the prisoner is being represented
by a Dr Giordano of Padua.

1059
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:28,580
Then I call the defence, Dr Giordano.

1060
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:32,350
It is a case of mistaken identity,
Your Grace.

1061
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:34,260
- What? Mistaken...
- Yes.

1062
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:38,760
This man is not Bernardo Guardi.

1063
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:40,600
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, I am.

1064
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:43,480
- You see?
- He is protecting someone.

1065
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:45,110
- No.
- Yes, you are.

1066
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:48,440
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are... not.

1067
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:50,740
Protecting who?

1068
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,990
The woman who loves him.

1069
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:04,210
If you are who you say, perhaps you could
indulge the court with a few samples

1070
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:07,080
of your more renowned
philosophies on women.

1071
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:13,750
If I've said I am Bernardo Guardi,
does that not suffice?

1072
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:18,510
My Lord, must we listen to this
stuttering heretic? He has self-confessed.

1073
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,050
Is that all that you require?
A confession?

1074
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,900
Well, yes. I suppose so.

1075
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:28,610
Good.

1076
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:36,160
Because I am the one with
the manuscripts, written in my own hand.

1077
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,650
I am the only one with proof that I...

1078
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,580
I am Bernardo Guardi.

1079
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:45,040
You?

1080
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:48,130
- Francesca.
- Do you really think I'd let you die for me?

1081
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:51,130
Well, then, release the prisoner Casanova.

1082
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:56,760
My Lord, my Lord,
let us not forget this is a court of law.

1083
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:59,850
We still have a self-confessed heretic.

1084
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:04,260
And we also have
a notorious seducer,

1085
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:07,860
an adulterer, a violator of virgins

1086
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:11,110
whose guilt I will prove
by the testimony of...

1087
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,860
No!

1088
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:14,940
It wasn't true.

1089
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:18,860
Of...

1090
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:24,410
By the testimony of no less
than 127 sworn statements,

1091
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:28,790
attesting to the libidinous lust
of Giacomo Casanova.

1092
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,710
There is only one verdict
open to this court: Guilty.

1093
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:38,000
And one sentence: Death.

1094
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:42,380
- Death to the heretic Bernardo Guardi.
- No!

1095
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:46,340
And death to the master fornicator

1096
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,060
Giacomo Casanova.

1097
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:48,580
- You did say the cardinal's coming.
- I did, sir.

1098
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:16,430
Your Reverence,
I don't think we can wait any longer.

1099
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:18,520
Very well.

1100
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:21,450
I shall have to do it without him.

1101
01:33:43,010 --> 01:33:46,180
Cardinal Lopresta has arrived!

1102
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:08,450
Sorry we're late.
Canals, et cetera.

1103
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:11,540
Your Eminence.
Bishop Pucci.

1104
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:13,620
An honour to meet you at last.

1105
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:17,040
- I've heard so much about you.
- Thank you.

1106
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:19,460
What's happening here?

1107
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:25,090
Just hanging a heretic and Casanova.

1108
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:26,380
What luck.

1109
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:30,760
My nurse.

1110
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:35,310
And does your nurse enjoy executions?

1111
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,020
Does the pope have a balcony?

1112
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:40,680
What I actually came to say is this.

1113
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:45,570
Venetians!

1114
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,160
Greetings from His Holiness.

1115
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:54,490
As you know,
today is the pope's birthday.

1116
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:56,840
- And...
- Did you know that?

1117
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:02,630
And in honour of his birthday,
His Holiness has decreed

1118
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:08,010
a papal pardon for all those
who would be executed

1119
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:11,680
on this happy day.

1120
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:14,060
- Your Eminence.
- Free the prisoners.

1121
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:18,220
Free the prisoners!

1122
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:26,110
Your Eminence.
No. No. No.

1123
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:29,940
You don't seem to share
the pope's happiness on his birthday.

1124
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,700
No, I do. I do.

1125
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:36,330
How old is he?

1126
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,620
I'm not quite sure.

1127
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:47,390
- No, no...
- Best stay here. Crowd's turning ugly.

1128
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:56,680
Please join me in my coach.
We're leaving for my country house.

1129
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:19,750
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1130
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:25,340
My fault. I'm to blame.

1131
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:27,550
Tito.

1132
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:29,680
The love of my life.

1133
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:35,010
This is my son.

1134
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:39,270
I've played cardinals before, of course.
You may have seen me.

1135
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:44,520
Anyway, we left our troupe in Trieste when
we heard the news. Had to move fast.

1136
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:49,110
Mom, the paint is wet.

1137
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:54,700
It says "Theatre Troupe" here.

1138
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:00,420
Cardinal Lopresta has arrived!

1139
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,130
Arrest those impostors!

1140
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:10,000
Move! Get out of the way!

1141
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:12,510
Giacomo!

1142
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:18,520
- Come on!
- Come on! Out of the way, people!

1143
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,430
Casanova!

1144
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:40,620
On you get, darling.
Quick as a bunny.

1145
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:46,420
I didn't know it was the pope's birthday.

1146
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:30,960
So how goes things?

1147
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:35,420
It's very exciting, isn't it?

1148
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:40,430
This is the last time I'm travelling coach.

1149
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,510
Hold on, everyone!

1150
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,520
Hang on!

1151
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:59,120
- Easy, boy!
- Tito!

1152
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:09,300
Everybody off.

1153
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,250
Hello, darling.
I'm your future stepfather.

1154
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:18,590
- I was always faithful to you.
- I never had any doubt. None at all.

1155
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:23,220
Come on, darling.
Let's escape on my barge. It's by the water.

1156
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:27,060
That way.

1157
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:29,310
Charge!

1158
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,910
Oh, dear.

1159
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:44,200
Giovanni!

1160
01:40:18,490 --> 01:40:21,570
Step lightly, darling.
Excuse us. Excuse us.

1161
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:23,900
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Excuse us.

1162
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,530
This way, darling.
This way.

1163
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:32,670
I can't wait for you to see the boat. Here's
the boat. Right this way. On your new boat.

1164
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:35,130
- Vittorio. Vittorio.
- Careful. Careful.

1165
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,010
- I'm behind you.
- This way.

1166
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:41,510
No, my baby. Listen.
You're staying behind with me.

1167
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:46,050
Prepare to sail, men.

1168
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:51,110
Oh, dear.

1169
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:55,440
Vittorio, do something useful.

1170
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:58,860
- Signora, what can I do?
- Something useful.

1171
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:01,570
Giovanni!

1172
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:03,570
Come on! Come on!

1173
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,950
Quickly! Quickly!

1174
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:12,960
I can't come with you.
If I do, they'll follow us both.

1175
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:14,580
What?

1176
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:17,420
- You mean they'll follow Casanova?
- That's right.

1177
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,120
What if he never left?

1178
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:25,800
I could do it.

1179
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:30,680
There's more to this than just the name.

1180
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:34,810
I wouldn't mind being Casanova.

1181
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:41,230
- I wouldn't mind being on that boat.
- And I wouldn't mind my wedding.

1182
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:47,530
Well, come on.

1183
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:50,740
- Come on.
- Lupo, where you going?

1184
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:52,490
I'm staying.

1185
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,540
- Why?
- I'm a Venetian, sir.

1186
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:58,550
My place is with Casanova.

1187
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:04,550
Take care of me, my good friend.

1188
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:06,840
Of course, Master.

1189
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:37,670
After them!

1190
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:41,920
Better luck next time!

1191
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:56,260
- Andolini, get the boats after them!
- Farewell, simpletons!

1192
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:02,560
Get after them!

1193
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:04,650
Go on!

1194
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,250
I told you I'd come back.

1195
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:39,890
It's a wonderful life, an actor's life.

1196
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:42,350
You'll love it.

1197
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,610
Who writes your plays?

1198
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:56,080
Come inside.

1199
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:03,800
Lovely.

1200
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:06,920
Just my kind of good weather.

1201
01:44:41,290 --> 01:44:46,200
Which is why the story
of Casanova and Francesca

1202
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:51,000
isn't mine to tell.

1203
01:44:54,770 --> 01:45:00,600
Victoria and I lived happily ever after.

1204
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:06,760
Just not together.

1205
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:11,650
Venice.

1206
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:16,780
So soon enough, in people's minds,

1207
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:19,710
Casanova was back.

1208
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:22,950
If I may say so,

1209
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,580
I believe I rose worthily to the occasion

1210
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:32,960
and added many glorious chapters
to the legend,

1211
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:38,430
while I kept the secret

1212
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,840
of the true love

1213
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:44,440
of the man who was

1214
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,600
Casanova.
