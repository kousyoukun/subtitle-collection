1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
10,000 pages.

2
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,800
My life and loves.

3
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,300
That's just about
one woman for every page.

4
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,600
God, I'm tired.

5
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,700
But there is one story
I haven't put down.

6
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,400
Francesca.

7
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,200
That's a story
which isn't mine to tell, really.

8
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,600
So keep it to yourself.

9
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,200
- For how long?
- I don't know how long.

10
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,200
- It's a man, and you're a whore.
- I'm an actress.

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,700
What's the difference?

12
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,500
Giacomo.

13
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,100
You be good for your grandmother.

14
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,200
- Now, you know I love you very much.
- Mama.

15
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,500
Listen to me.
Look out there.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,300
Know one day you'll come back to Venice

17
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,200
and I'll return for you.

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,600
I promise.

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,300
I promise.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,700
She means when I am dead.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,200
It's not her fault.
It's in the blood.

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,800
Aheat for love. Irresistible.

23
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,400
Irresistible.

24
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,500
Sophia, my love!

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
My husband.

26
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,200
Your husband is the luckiest man in Venice
and doesn't know it.

27
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,400
And it's lucky he's not in Venice.

28
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,800
Sweet darling,
I love you like no other.

29
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,300
You are my dreams come true.

30
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,300
Please, please make love to me again.

31
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,100
Casanova, tell me I'm the only one.

32
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,200
Of course. I always do.

33
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,500
- Darling, I'm home!
- My husband!

34
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,900
I know Casanova well.
It's just like him.

35
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,500
- Has the iceman come yet?
- Yes.

36
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,000
And he comes again tomorrow...

37
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
Don't believe what people say.

38
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,800
I don't conquer. I submit.

39
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,800
I've never sought glory as a lover.

40
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, what then,
Signor Casanova, do you seek?

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,400
A moment that lasts a lifetime.

42
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,800
So, tell me.

43
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,800
This unusual order of nuns you belong to.

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Is it a very strict order?

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,300
Very. No

46
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,900
jewels or nice clothes before sundown

47
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,400
and back in our cells by...

48
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,600
- Heavens! Is that the time?
- You don't have to go.

49
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,700
I must.
It's been delightful. Only...

50
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,400
Only...

51
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,400
How do I know you're really Casanova?

52
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,400
Yes! Yes!

53
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Casanova.

54
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,300
- The Inquisition is here looking for you.
- No.

55
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,000
Forgive me.

56
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,300
Quick. If they catch you,
they'll hang you.

57
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Giacomo, wait.
Tell me I was the one.

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,300
You are the one.

59
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,500
- You won't forget me, will you?
- No, I could never.

60
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,000
- Casanova. For you.
- Thank you.

61
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,300
- Where is Casanova?
- I've taken a vow of si...

62
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,000
Eternal damnation.
For one night with Casanova.

63
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,100
Seems fair.

64
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,500
We've got him.

65
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,900
Come on.

66
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,200
.. hours of study by respected thinkers
of our time, including myself.

67
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,300
I'm not old-fashioned in this matter.

68
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,400
I do not say a woman's place
is at the hearth and in the bed.

69
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,100
What I do say...
Of course it is their place.

70
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,700
What I do say
is let them be educated at home.

71
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,300
On the higher planes
of science and philosophy,

72
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,300
women serve only to distract us,

73
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,600
to bring us down
to our earthly appetites.

74
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,500
So I say no woman shall ever
set foot inside this university.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,500
Let my opponent take the floor.

76
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,800
And now Dr. Giordano of Padua.

77
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,100
- Too late, gentlemen.
- Silence!

78
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,000
Let me show you
who is bringing whom down to earth.

79
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,200
A woman is air and fire
and lightness and strength.

80
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,300
Like this little vessel

81
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,200
that would rise up to heaven
were it not held down by ballast -

82
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,400
bags of sand.

83
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,200
The dead weight of men
with their heads full of sand.

84
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,500
Only a woman would argue
by this demonstration of a toy.

85
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,400
It would never strike the superior intellect of
a man, or I'll eat my words.

86
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,200
Eat these briefs, signor, for these are the
words of the philosopher Bernardo Guardi,

87
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,600
who was said to live in this very city.

88
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,700
Bernardo Guardi. That madman.

89
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,400
Wait until the Inquisition
catches up with him.

90
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,300
Call him a madman,

91
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,500
but he has more understanding of women
than any man in this room.

92
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,500
And I'll wager he has better luck
with them in bed as well.

93
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,200
Strumpet.

94
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,500
There he is! Over there!

95
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,900
Stop him!

96
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,600
Hold him!

97
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,200
Gentlemen, my apologies.

98
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,100
You see?

99
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,900
The dead weight of men.

100
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,700
But I didn't know
what was happening. He...

101
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,800
He bewitched me.

102
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,500
He said he was the Holy Ghost.

103
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,600
And it's happened before.

104
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,700
You are charged with
debauchery, trespass, heresy.

105
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,300
To wit: fornication with a novice.

106
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
Well, she was hardly a novice.

107
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,200
For which the punishment is death
by hanging, tomorrow at dawn.

108
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,400
And this time your admirers in high places
won't be able to help you.

109
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,900
Excuse me, Inquisitor.
The doge.

110
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,400
Dalfonso.

111
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,800
Prince, we were just talking about you.

112
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,300
What brings you here?

113
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,900
- I have a special interest...
- I have a special interest.

114
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
This time the prisoner has been
condemned on the evidence of a nun.

115
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,100
A special interest in your witness.

116
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,500
- Sister Beatrice?
- I need a word.

117
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
For God's sake,
don't you know who she is?

118
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,900
- Who?
- Cardinal Lopresta's mistress in waiting.

119
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,000
He entrusted me with safeguarding
her virginity for him alone.

120
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,200
She's leaving for Rome today.

121
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,000
Your witness
is Cardinal Lopresta's sister, Beatrice.

122
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,200
His sister? Oh, God!
Those Romans.

123
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,800
Think about it, Father Dalfonso.

124
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,200
Who's going to get the blame
for dragging her into the Casanova affair?

125
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,200
Take your time.

126
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,100
Me?

127
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,400
Signor Casanova, this seems to be
another case of mistaken identity.

128
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,900
You are free to go.

129
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,000
You know I'm your friend,
but I'm being threatened by Rome.

130
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,400
Venice, I'm afraid,
is perceived as a hotbed of...

131
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,700
Well, as one enormous hot bed

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,600
with silk sheets and heretical books
under the mattress.

133
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,300
The people here are given over to
physical pleasure and skepticism.

134
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,400
Do not abuse my sympathy
for you, Casanova.

135
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,500
I'm expelling you from Venice.

136
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,100
Your Excellency, I worship beauty.
There's no harm in that, is there?

137
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,100
- Worship it in Paris, London.
- I can't leave Venice.

138
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,200
- Why?
- I'm waiting for someone.

139
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,100
- She may let you down.
- No. She promised she'll come one day.

140
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,500
You don't understand.

141
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,600
I'm expelling you from Venice
for your own good.

142
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
- Unless...
- Unless what?

143
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,400
Unless you find yourself a respectable wife.

144
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,200
A good woman from a good family
will give you protection.

145
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
A wife?

146
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
It will soon be the time of Carnevale
when authority winks at our indiscretions.

147
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
- You're bad enough during Lent.
- But Carnival's in a few days.

148
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,800
You better not waste any more time then.

149
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
- Meanwhile, you're on good behavior.
- A wife?

150
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,100
- No scandals,...
- Getting married?

151
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,100
.. duels, drunken escapades.

152
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Morning, Lupo.

153
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,800
- We were worried about us.
- You were right to be.

154
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,300
- We're getting married.
- Congratulations. To whom?

155
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,500
Don't know yet.
Any callers?

156
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,600
Landlord, tailor, wine merchant,
usual creditors.

157
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,200
Look at the state of us.
Where have you been all night?

158
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,000
It's like being married already.

159
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,500
Can you get me some fresh clothes?
We have some shopping to do.

160
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,200
- The Contessa Morelli-D'Aosta.
- Yes, yes, yes. Oh, but, no, she snores.

161
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,200
Yes, I remember.
Lady Veronique Costello.

162
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,600
- Heavenly.
- Yeah.

163
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,900
- Duchess of Urfe.
- Yes.

164
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,900
- But didn't she poison her husband?
- Did she? I don't remember that.

165
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Ah, Giulietta Badalamente.

166
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,100
Sadly, she hasn't
poisoned her husband yet.

167
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,200
Perhaps if we told us
what we're looking for.

168
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,600
I don't know. Beauty, modesty.

169
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,400
- Purity.
- All that.

170
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Lupo. We have had a vision.

171
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
Still spying on your virgin?

172
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,400
She'll never look this way
if you don't make yourself known.

173
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,200
The whole town's talking about it.

174
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
It's just appalling.

175
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,800
You think those men liked hearing
they're no good in bed?

176
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,400
If they wanted that,
they'd go home to their wives.

177
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,400
Francesca, arrogance
in a woman is not attractive.

178
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
She's not arrogant.
She's just angry.

179
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
- Fruit, sir?
- Don't defend your sister.

180
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,900
It's true. She knows
she's smarter than most men,

181
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,100
which makes men pretend to be superior,

182
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,700
which makes her angry,
which is seen as arrogance.

183
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,500
Giovanni, come away from the window.
Our neighbours'll think you're a gargoyle.

184
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,500
No, Vittorio. Over there.

185
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,300
Francesca, this is a very important week as
you well know. You have responsibilities.

186
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,200
In a few days, thanks to you,
I won't be poor any more.

187
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,300
Much thanks to your father

188
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,200
who had the foresight to betroth her
to his rich cousin's eldest son in Genoa.

189
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,400
Listen to this.
"Mystery transvestite at university

190
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
overturns laws of gravity,

191
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,700
conjures devil from the air,

192
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,800
nearly starts fire. "

193
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,800
God. Can't they get anything right?

194
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,900
Be thankful. I told you I'd not permit another
scandalous display at the university.

195
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,000
- There's too much at stake.
- Mother, I don't want to marry him.

196
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,700
- Please. I'll be damned if I do.
- Well, if you won't, I will.

197
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,200
That's funny, is it?

198
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,100
Well, I'm damned to be widowed
and gathering dust.

199
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,000
Mother.

200
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well done.

201
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,400
I know why you're like this
about your fiance.

202
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
- Why I'm like what?
- Come on.

203
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,400
You're always slipping away in secret.

204
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
And you're thin.

205
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,300
It's obvious
you've already got a secret lover.

206
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Well, don't tell.

207
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,800
Hello. A gift for your daughter.

208
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,100
I don't know what to say.
Thank you. It's magnificent.

209
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,000
But you don't know my daughter
and she doesn't know you.

210
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,700
Yes. But I know her reputation,
Signor Donato.

211
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,300
And everybody knows yours,
Signor Casanova.

212
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,200
I've always wondered
what you look like.

213
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,300
Quite ordinary, I can see that.

214
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,200
Well, how can I put this?

215
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,100
Victoria is that rare thing -
a Venetian virgin.

216
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,700
Yes, one hears of them,
but invariably it turns out that...

217
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,700
I am sorry. Do go on.

218
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,200
Thank you.
She's led a very protected life.

219
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,800
Never has an impure thought
crossed her mind.

220
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Of course not.

221
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,300
She's never been alone in a room with a
man, or even seen a man without his coat.

222
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,000
I've made sure of that.

223
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,000
There isn't anything I wouldn't do
to ensure her happy innocence.

224
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,900
- She should be in a nunnery, but...
- Heaven forbid.

225
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,000
- Exactly. One hears things.
- Yes.

226
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,200
On the other hand,
there is you, Signor Casanova,

227
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,100
the most notorious lover
of women in Venice,

228
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,400
reputed to have the longest list
of conquests ever known.

229
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,200
A virtuoso of the intimate caress

230
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,400
The maestro of multiple...

231
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,100
- What was that?
- I will come to love her, Signor Donato.

232
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,500
It's out of the question.
Your idea of love is sensuality,

233
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,800
to reduce women to quivering puddles of...

234
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,800
Victoria!

235
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,900
Are you all right?

236
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,300
I want him. I want him.
Please, please, Papa.

237
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I'll never be happy without him.

238
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,300
- Congratulations. We're engaged.
- We are a marvel.

239
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,100
- I mean, actually getting married?
- Yes.

240
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,100
You have sullied my glove.

241
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
I mean, love. My love.

242
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,300
- I'm sorry. What did he just call us?
- We didn't sully it. It came out of nowhere.

243
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,000
Thank you.
You've sullied my love.

244
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,700
Victoria Donato is my fiancée.

245
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,300
- Is she?
- Yes.

246
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,600
- In the sense that I'm going to marry her.
- Well, she never mentioned that.

247
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Of course she didn't.
I haven't asked her yet.

248
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,100
Wha...?

249
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,200
Here, sir.

250
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,300
What, are you two
working together now? Lupo.

251
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,100
San Cremori at dawn.

252
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,700
Listen. We decline to fight you, dear sir.

253
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,600
- You coward.
- We happen to be on good behavior.

254
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,700
You have no right to decline
to defend your honor.

255
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,500
It's our honor, so we have the right.

256
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,300
He who gets slapped has his rights.
Those are the rules.

257
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,000
See?

258
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,400
- Now, what did we do that for?
- I don't know.

259
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,100
San Cremori at dawn.

260
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,400
May I know of whom
I have the honor to be killing?

261
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,000
Lupo Salvato.

262
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,000
Thank you.

263
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,200
- Don't forget your glove.
- Thank you.

264
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,200
Surely we don't mean...

265
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,300
What's this "we"?
You slapped him. You fight him.

266
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
I see you're not laughing now.

267
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,500
Come on!

268
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,000
The apple is very distracting.

269
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,100
It's all right. I'll fight him.

270
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,600
I can be Lupo Salvato.

271
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,500
Bastard!

272
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,300
Signor Salvato.

273
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,300
Oh, dear.

274
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,400
This gentleman is here to explain
the terms of the duel and to see fair play.

275
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,300
- Very good.
- Your attention, please, gentlemen.

276
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,700
Stay behind the line until I give the word.

277
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
If one trips or falls, the other puts up
his sword until I say "continue".

278
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,200
Yes.

279
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,000
If a sword breaks,
your second hands you the spare sword.

280
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,400
- Do we have a spare sword?
- Yeah, we do.

281
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,400
First blood ends the duel.

282
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Master!

283
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
Move. Go on.

284
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,700
Master!

285
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,600
It's the old switch game.

286
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,500
You'd have killed him.

287
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,000
And you are?

288
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,600
Francesca Bruni.
He's my brother.

289
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,100
- I'll take that, sir.
- Sorry, Signor Salvato.

290
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,900
I should think you would be sorry.

291
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,200
- It was all a case of mistaken identity.
- Mistaken identity?

292
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,200
Giovanni got it into his head
you were courting Signorina Donato.

293
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,300
- Did he?
- It's all over Venice.

294
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,300
The famously virginal Victoria Donato is
gonna marry the infamous rake, Casanova.

295
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,400
- Do you know him?
- Casanova. The philosopher,

296
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,900
who devotes his life to the perfection
of experience? Yes, I know him.

297
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,300
No. Casanova the libertine
who devotes his life to seducing women.

298
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Well, we're obviously
talking about the same person.

299
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,200
There must be something deeply wrong
with a man like that, don't you think?

300
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,300
Something missing in his life.
True love, perhaps.

301
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,300
All love is true in different ways.

302
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,400
To say "I love falsely" is as self-
contradictory as saying "I believe falsely".

303
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,100
You are a philosopher, too.

304
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,900
I've spent countless hours
alone with Casanova,

305
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,200
pondering the ways of love and
how it makes us at one with the angels.

306
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,700
And with the beasts.

307
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,400
I will not debate with you
if you take the side of a man

308
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,200
whose idea of love
demands a female sacrifice every day.

309
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,000
I've no sympathy for women who think no
better of themselves than to be a plaything.

310
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,000
You tell your friend from me that what
he imagines being love is, in fact, self-love.

311
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,000
And self-love is self-doubt.

312
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,800
- Well said.
- Yes.

313
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,300
By the philosopher Bernardo Guardi.
You should read him, Signor Salvato.

314
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,100
- Clearly.
- Give me a man who is man enough

315
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,800
to give himself just to the woman
who is worth him.

316
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,400
If that woman were me,
I would love him alone and forever.

317
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,800
Goodbye, Signor Salvato.

318
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,300
If fighting continued, one of us
would have had good cause to be sorry.

319
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,700
The one still standing, I think.

320
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,600
Francesca Bruni.

321
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,000
- I want my money!
- Next week, without fail.

322
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,400
- You said that last week!
- I was a week early.

323
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,400
- Go to hell.
- I'll see you there. Thank you so much.

324
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,300
Honestly. Why, the nerve!

325
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Can you believe this man?
I mean

326
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,000
does he know who we are?

327
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,300
He should be honored
to be owed money by the likes of us.

328
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,400
- Lupo.
- What?

329
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,200
I've made a terrible mistake.

330
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,500
- You have?
- Yes.

331
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,600
I have to find her.

332
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,300
Master, I'm a little confused.

333
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,200
- I thought we'd made our decision.
- Yes, I know.

334
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,200
Francesca!
He's arriving tomorrow.

335
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Your fiance.

336
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,400
She has a fiance.

337
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,900
Well, so do you.

338
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,300
- Giovanni.
- Good day, Mario. How are you?

339
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,000
- I'm sorry.
- Giovanni, more disgrace.

340
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,500
- Allow me.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

341
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,600
Mama, this is Signor Salvato.

342
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,200
I understand you've had an unpleasant
encounter with my son this morning.

343
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,000
It was nothing more strenuous
than a morning's constitutional.

344
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,300
Come along.

345
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Sorry.

346
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,600
- Your sister has a fiance?
- She's in love with Casanova.

347
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,000
- Who is?
- Victoria.

348
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,700
- My love. Remember?
- Oh, yes.

349
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,700
- Engaged to Casanova.
- Yes.

350
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,400
Well, you'll have to beat him
at his own game.

351
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,200
But how? I'm up against
a world-class seducer.

352
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,600
- Hello.
- So? What would Casanova do?

353
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,100
- I don't know. What would Casanova do?
- Well, to start, he wouldn't mope around.

354
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,700
- No, I suppose not.
- Misery is not attractive.

355
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,400
If you want to be loved,
you have to be worth loving.

356
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,200
That's the first rule.
And second

357
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,400
be the flame, not the moth.

358
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,300
- The flame, not the moth.
- Yes.

359
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,800
It's my tongue.
Got very loud.

360
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,200
So, your sister, is she happy
with this new fiance of hers?

361
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
No. She's never met him.

362
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,800
- Really?
- Besides, she has a secret lover.

363
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,800
- A secret lover?
- Yeah.

364
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,500
- Who?
- Well, I don't know. It's a secret.

365
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,000
Anyway, she's always
sneaking off in the... See?

366
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,100
I'm sorry.

367
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,900
Lupo, there she is.

368
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,500
Casanova.

369
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,900
We are buying Victoria's trousseau.

370
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,700
Only three days to go before the wedding.

371
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,500
Casanova.

372
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,200
No intercourse before the wedding.
I'm a traditionalist.

373
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,400
I mean social intercourse, of course.

374
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,400
Paolo. Paolo, let us off.

375
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,800
A secret lover.

376
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,600
He's going to bang her to pieces.

377
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,400
From Rome.

378
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,100
The Inquisitor's office.

379
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,500
"A cesspit of heresy and fornication. "

380
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,400
Surely not...
Oh, they mean us.

381
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,800
127 complaints against Signor Casanova.
Do we know him?

382
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:27,300
You'll see there are suspicions Casanova
enjoys the protection of this very office.

383
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,300
That's absolutely rid...

384
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,100
It's either his neck or it's ours.

385
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,000
It better be his.
Get me my notebook.

386
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,400
Oh, dear.

387
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,800
She's completely worn him out.

388
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,300
I found his name.

389
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,700
He's a writer.

390
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,800
"The Subjugation of Women
by Bernardo Guardi. "

391
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,300
No wonder. He's entered her head
and her heart as well.

392
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,700
"Here we live in the midst of masculine
domination and what be the result?"

393
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,200
"Half the population
is missing from the feast?"

394
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,300
"You have no right to property
and government, nay, not an opinion...

395
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,300
"If ever a man wants to have
a woman fall in love with him,

396
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,800
all he need to say...

397
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,000
"All he need to say is,

398
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,300
'I have too long dominated
the conversation. What are... "'

399
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,600
.. your thoughts on the matter?
What are your thoughts?

400
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,600
- Meat? I'm the tailor!
- So you are. Forgive me.

401
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,100
Thank you, sir.

402
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,300
What are...
What are your thoughts on the matter?

403
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,900
My thoughts?
Well, I'd say...

404
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,200
No, Lupo. I'm...
Could I have some tea?

405
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,600
Of course.

406
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,200
Mother, my fiance is turning up tomorrow.
What shall I do?

407
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,500
It's simple. Do your duty.

408
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,100
Is it my duty to marry a man
that I don't know just because he's rich?

409
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,500
Yes, it is. Your duty to your father
who had your best interest at heart.

410
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,300
Marriage is a safe haven, my darling.

411
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,700
And love?

412
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,800
Love?

413
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,800
Love is something else.

414
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,600
It's the weather being good every day,

415
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,400
because wind and rain
are just another kind of good weather.

416
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,200
That's love.

417
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,200
Perhaps when you see him,
you'll fall in love with your husband.

418
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,200
He's not my husband yet.

419
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,400
If you go against your father's wishes,
we'll continue living in debt,

420
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,200
at the mercy of everyone we owe.

421
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,900
- But if you honor the betrothal...
- The contract.

422
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,600
The betrothal

423
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,900
then our troubles will be over.

424
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,500
It's between you and your conscience.

425
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,400
Amen.

426
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,300
- Signor Salvato.
- I do come here to make confession.

427
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,800
- What are you doing?
- What am I here to confess?

428
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,800
Well, let's see.

429
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,500
Jealousy.

430
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,600
Pride.

431
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,400
Covetousness.

432
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,600
Despair.

433
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,100
And you?

434
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,000
I came to prepare my soul for marriage.

435
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,400
You're troubled, Signorina Bruni.

436
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,600
My troubles are nothing to you, signor,
and little enough to me.

437
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,700
To be bartered in marriage
is no small thing,

438
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,300
especially for a woman
of independent mind.

439
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,000
I see my brother's tongue wags again.
In future he can fight his own duels.

440
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,000
- You can't come in.
- It's all right. I'm a doctor.

441
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,600
You're not Casanova?

442
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,100
No. I can prove it
if you'll show me your chest.

443
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,400
- Are you often in church?
- I followed you.

444
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,200
Surely it is your friend Casanova
for whom fiancées add spice to the pursuit.

445
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,900
If you knew him,
you wouldn't be so quick to condemn him.

446
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,200
If you understood women,
you would not be so quick to defend him.

447
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,600
Love is not an affair of a night or a fortnight.

448
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,400
And true love doesn't grow
with the number of lovers. It wastes away.

449
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,300
- Where's your instrument?
- I'll get it out in a minute.

450
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,500
But you can't blame those
who seek love wherever they can.

451
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,800
Perhaps it's merely the murmur of the flesh
that hasn't known the flutter of the heart,

452
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,900
meant for an evening but not a lifetime.

453
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,300
But can't that still be love all the same?

454
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,100
It seems you're trying
to woo me, Signor Salvato,

455
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,600
by offering to make me
a notch on your bedpost.

456
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,900
Come now, we are speaking of Casanova,
and I am a different man.

457
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,600
You see, Casanova couldn't understand

458
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,300
that of all the ways love can be true, there...

459
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,800
there is one way.

460
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,200
And that way is the sum of all the others.

461
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,300
Now, I've too long
dominated the conversation.

462
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,300
What are your thoughts on the matter?

463
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,800
- What did you just say?
- What?

464
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,400
- I'm in hell.
- I'm busy.

465
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,000
Another note to your lover?
I'd tell him it's all over if I was you.

466
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,700
Go away.
I'm marrying Papprizzio.

467
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,900
- What did I do?
- Somebody came here

468
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,600
who wanted to read your latest pamphlet
before publication.

469
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,600
- What?
- Did you show someone my work?

470
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,200
I didn't show anyone anything, on the
memory of your father, whom I served well.

471
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,300
Until he fired you for stealing.

472
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,300
- Where's the manuscript?
- I took it to the printer's like I always do.

473
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,500
You write, I get it printed under my name,
I take the commission.

474
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,200
Everyone's happy except the priests.

475
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,800
- These new shoes, Guardi?
- Church gave them to me. They don't fit.

476
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,400
Don't lie.

477
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,300
This is an addition to page five.
Take it to the printer's.

478
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,700
Nobody came. Nobody bribed me.
Would I be sober if they had?

479
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,300
That's him.

480
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,900
- Here. Add this to chapter one.
- Thank you.

481
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,600
Guardi says, "Why should women lace
themselves out of their natural shape?"

482
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,300
- Casanova.
- Signorina.

483
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,100
I left my window open.

484
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,800
My darling, I have so many windows
and so little time.

485
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,700
Burn our corsets.

486
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,400
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. Forgive me. It was an involuntary...

487
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,300
Please let me help you.

488
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,000
"In the heart of every woman,
there is room for a pet. "

489
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,800
"Dogs and cats provide
solace and affection. "

490
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
"How rare is the man who knows
that the pet of choice for today's woman

491
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,900
is the intelligent and noble pig!"

492
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,500
- A pig?
- I'll pay for the damage. I'm well-endowed.

493
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,800
If you get my... I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

494
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,200
Will you tell your lady
that Signor Salvato is here with a gift?

495
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,700
My mistress says the pig cannot come in.

496
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,400
But the animal we'll take.

497
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,200
I have news about the fiance.
His name is Papprizzio.

498
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,400
He's from Genoa.
He's arriving at noon.

499
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,300
He's rich.

500
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,400
Of course he is.

501
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,900
Everything's turning
against us these days, Lupo.

502
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,300
- How much do we owe?
- About 1500 lira.

503
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,300
Lay out our second-best suit, Lupo.

504
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,400
Who owns this tub?

505
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,200
I do, sir.

506
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,200
And I'm Pietro Papprizzio,
merchant of Genoa.

507
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,100
- And what's your cargo?
- Lard.

508
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,300
- Lard?
- Finest in the world.

509
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,400
- Tell him, Fulvio. Tell him.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,300
Tub of lard.

511
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,200
Do you mean to tell me you've never
heard of my lard? We'll have to fix that.

512
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,400
I want to see one of these posters on every
canal, street, water corner by morning.

513
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,500
- Understand?
- Sign here.

514
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,600
Signor Papprizzio?

515
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,500
- At your service, sir.
- On the contrary, I'm at yours.

516
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,000
The family of your fiancée sent me here to
greet you and to send you to your palazzo.

517
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,700
But palazzo?
I have a reservation at the Hotel Grifasi.

518
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,300
They didn't tell you?
The Grifasi is closed.

519
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,300
- Really? Why?
- Lupo.

520
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,500
- Rising damp, sir.
- Rising damp, indeed.

521
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,200
Palazzo, eh?
Well, lead on.

522
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,300
- My servant shall see to your baggage.
- I think you have everything under control.

523
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,400
The first thing I'm going to do

524
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,500
is call upon my betrothed

525
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,900
after I make myself presentable, of course.

526
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,800
Yes. And how long does that usually take?

527
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,500
"Casanova bought a pig. "

528
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,200
"Casanova took the pig
to the Bruni house. "

529
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,500
Clear it. Everything.

530
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,500
I'll take that.

531
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,000
Your Grace.

532
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,900
Inquisitore Dalfonso,
I am Bishop Pucci.

533
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,400
Oh, Bishop...

534
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,000
I have been instructed to relieve you
of your duties here in Venice.

535
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,300
To say that the pope is less than happy
with your rate of progress

536
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,300
is an understatement
of monumental proportions.

537
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,900
You and your entire staff

538
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:23,500
have been reassigned
to open a mission among the natives of

539
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,800
the equatorial region.

540
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,400
What kind of natives?

541
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:38,200
Let us just say, shall we,
they have a great hunger for religion.

542
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,500
So this place belonged
to the libertine Casanova, eh?

543
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,900
Yes, but he ran out on his debts, so

544
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,100
we got the villa at a very reasonable price.

545
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,400
Really? How reasonable?

546
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,800
Lupo?

547
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,000
- 1,600 lira.
- Yes.

548
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,000
- Get a receipt.
- Of course.

549
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,000
Do I get a bath for my 1,600 lira?

550
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,300
"Casanova bought a pig?"

551
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,500
"Casanova took pig to Bruni house. "

552
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,300
"Casanova met with Papprizzio
at dockside. "

553
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,100
"Took Papprizzio to his house. "

554
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,300
Is there anybody here
who can explain this?

555
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,100
You sent them all away to be eaten.

556
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,100
Well, then we shall have to do
some footwork ourselves.

557
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,300
Papprizzio?
The pork fat mogul from Genoa?

558
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,100
We're here to discover
heresy and criminal licentiousness.

559
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,700
If there's bacon involved,
I dread to imagine the depths of depravity

560
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,400
we're going to find here in Venice.

561
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,300
I'm surprised,
but I have a good feeling about this city.

562
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,400
- Do you?
- There's a massive market for lard here,

563
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,200
and I plan to use a good old bit
of Genoan know-how to penetrate it.

564
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,600
- Good thinking.
- Handbills, newspapers.

565
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,100
- That's just what Venice is missing.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

566
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,500
- You have to keep an eye for that servant.
- What? He's gone out.

567
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,500
- He's gone out where?
- How am I supposed to know?

568
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:37,000
I've arranged a trinket for my beloved -
a little wedding present for my bride-to-be.

569
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,300
Would you like
an advanced demonstration?

570
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,000
Yes, please.

571
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,000
- It's very...
- That's wonderful. Exquisite.

572
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,900
Really. Yeah.

573
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,000
Who is it?

574
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,200
Was that him?

575
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,900
How am I supposed to know that?

576
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,100
What are we looking for?

577
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,300
I don't know.
Something. Anything.

578
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,300
I found the house, sir.
Signora Bruni and her daughter

579
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,500
request the pleasure
of your company for tea.

580
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,600
Good. Good.

581
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,300
The chartreuse then, I think, Fulvio.

582
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,400
Right away, Master.

583
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,400
I'm certainly looking forward to seeing her.

584
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,900
Hope that she's

585
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,900
not disappointed by me.

586
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,700
Hope that she doesn't think I'm...
I don't know.

587
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,900
What's the... What's the word?
The expression I'm looking for?

588
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,700
- Rotund?
- Excuse me. What did you say?

589
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,300
Would sir require
a small snack before tea?

590
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,500
Well, do you see that trunk
shaped vaguely like a salami?

591
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,900
- Yes.
- It's filled with salami.

592
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,200
- There you are.
- Yes.

593
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,600
- Now, very impressive.
- Thank you.

594
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,200
- The choice of lime is very slimming.
- You're too kind.

595
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,700
I must be off.
Didn't I have an appointment?

596
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,400
What? Oh. The publisher.

597
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,400
That was it.
To see how my new book is doing.

598
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,800
You're a writer.

599
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,100
- I've been known to scribble a bit.
- Bravo.

600
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,700
My master's a famous writer
of love and how to please ladies.

601
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,700
You've heard of Bernardo Guardi...

602
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,000
- Lupo, hush.
- But he's a friend.

603
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,800
- I'm so sorry.
- Bernardo Guardi?

604
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,300
- I can't believe it.
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

605
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,400
You, sir, are Bernardo Guardi?

606
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,700
That's my nom de plume.
But you must swear to tell no one.

607
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,400
I swear.
On my honor, sir.

608
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,600
My solemn vow.
Bernardo Guardi.

609
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,800
Fulvio, this will need some thinking about.

610
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,800
Yes, it does.
It's my great honor, sir.

611
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,700
Look at me.

612
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,400
I am.

613
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,700
Now look at that.

614
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,300
Yes, in truth, it is not an exact likeness, no.

615
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,100
Yeah. In Genoa, we call it advertising.

616
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,100
Yes. Fine. But so what of it?
If she loves you as you are...

617
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,100
She's never seen me.

618
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,900
- Not even a glimpse.
- Really?

619
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:19,700
Yes. Oh, dear, Master Guardi.
Take me under your tutelage, I beg you.

620
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,500
I'll pay you handsomely.
Whatever you like, I'll pay it.

621
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,100
You want me to tutor you?

622
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,900
I want you to transform me.
Transform me.

623
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,200
My dear man, but you have but an hour
until you must you meet her.

624
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,900
I don't want to go.
You can't make me go.

625
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,300
As it happens,
my new book, which isn't out yet,

626
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,300
deals with the outer man.

627
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,300
You see, the relation between the physical
and the spiritual is little understood.

628
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Except by me, of course.

629
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,800
- Master Guardi.
- Yes?

630
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,400
Can you make me look like that?

631
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,200
- Yes, I can.
- Oh, God.

632
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,600
But it will take courage.
It will take time.

633
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,600
- Long confinement to this villa.
- Courage. Yes.

634
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,400
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

635
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,300
Fulvio. I will send my servant Fulvio
to the house of Bruni with a note.

636
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,600
- No need. I will pass that way myself.
- Oh, excellent.

637
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,300
Can we start? I want to start right now.

638
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,500
Lupo.

639
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Lovely.

640
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,700
Giovanni! Signor Papprizzio
is expected at any moment.

641
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,900
Signor Salvato.

642
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,400
Vittorio, tell Signor Salvato
I am not at home.

643
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,700
Now, how strange.
I'm sure that I was invited to tea.

644
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,200
- You were?
- We're not having tea.

645
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,200
Forgive me.
I must have forgotten an invitation.

646
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,300
- You told my servant, I believe.
- We were expecting Francesca's fiance.

647
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,400
Indeed. And here he is.

648
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,800
Ladies, forgive me. It is time I presented
myself under my true colours.

649
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,700
Signorina Bruni,
my name is not Salvato.

650
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:27,600
You see before you
your most devoted and fortunate fiance,

651
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,700
Pietro Papprizzio,
all the way from Genoa.

652
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,500
Signor Papprizzio.

653
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,700
All the young women I met back in Genoa
concealed their true natures from me,

654
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,300
dazzled by dreams of an empire of pork.

655
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,300
They looked at me
and they saw a mountain of lard.

656
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,200
No, no, no. Not at all.

657
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,200
If anything, you need fattening up.

658
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,300
I don't like thin men.
Francesca's father was enormous.

659
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,900
Nevertheless, I remained true
to the fiancée that I'd never seen.

660
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,600
But I wanted to make sure before I declared
myself she likewise had kept herself for me

661
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,200
and hadn't been seduced by the first
charmer that came along with a...

662
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,800
Pig.

663
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,200
Perhaps you are the charmer
you warned me against, signor.

664
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,100
I'm engaged to be married,
and so far all I know about you is...

665
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,400
Perhaps you remember sending me this.

666
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,200
"To Pietro Papprizzio
from Francesca Bruni,

667
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,000
with my hopes. "

668
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,200
Perhaps I should've brought
the other letters you wrote me.

669
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,500
The only desire I have
is that you'll come to love me.

670
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:11,000
And if you cannot or if there is someone
else for whom your heart beats in secret,

671
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,200
I shall release you from your engagement.

672
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,700
There isn't! There isn't.

673
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,400
His Eminence, Bishop Pucci.

674
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,500
- Perhaps I've come at a bad time.
- No. No, Your Excellency. We're delighted.

675
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,000
I should have sent word,
but since I've just arrived in Venice

676
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,900
and as your husband, the late ambassador,
was so regarded by the Holy See,

677
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,300
the pope was anxious to be remembered.

678
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,000
Allow me to introduce
my son-in-law-to-be Signor Papprizzio.

679
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,000
- Signor Papprizzio.
- Bishop.

680
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,800
- My daughter Francesca.
- My dear.

681
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,400
What is the pope's most feared inquisitor
doing in Venice, Bishop Pucci?

682
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,500
Francesca...

683
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,300
No, no. I'm delighted
that my reputation precedes me.

684
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,000
The Vatican sent me
to deal with moral problems.

685
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,200
- What kind of moral problems, Bishop?
- The usual. Fornication, heresy.

686
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,500
How exactly does
the Church define heresy?

687
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,800
Francesca!

688
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,200
I hardly think heresy
is a fit conversation for a young lady.

689
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,200
Why? Can't we be heretics?

690
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,400
I think my fiancée, Bishop Pucci,
wishes to learn more from you perhaps.

691
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,000
If you please.

692
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,400
Very well.

693
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,200
Heresy is an affront
to the teachings of the Church.

694
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,200
It is a rebellion against
our mores and our morals.

695
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,000
More to the point,
and you will understand this,

696
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,500
since you are a woman
and understand women's ways,

697
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,700
hence the concept of "whim",

698
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,300
heresy is whatever I say it is.

699
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:05,400
For example, that writer fellow,
Bernardo Guardi, he is a heretic.

700
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,200
And why is that?

701
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,700
Vittorio, where is the tea?

702
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,600
Guardi's words
cause women to feel dissatisfied

703
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,600
- and men to doubt their manhood.
- Really?

704
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,500
If you are an admirer of this Guardi fellow,
I have some very sad news for you.

705
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,300
He's written out.

706
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,400
My colleagues are scouring
the streets for him as we speak.

707
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,400
I'm so sorry.

708
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,100
- Bishop, will you take tea?
- Thank you, no. I have people to see.

709
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,300
Signorina Bruni.

710
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,900
May I have the honor
of accompanying you to the carnival ball?

711
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,300
But I've done nothing wrong.

712
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,800
I'm innocent!
You've got the wrong man! Let me go!

713
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,200
Come on. Come on.

714
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,700
I have an urgent message for you
from Bernardo Guardi.

715
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,400
Who are you?

716
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,800
Never mind. The Chief Inquisitor from
Rome is here and he is out for blood.

717
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,400
- Delay publishing the new pamphlet.
- You're a little late.

718
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,800
Oh, my God. Stop selling it.

719
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,800
- Sorry.
- That's what it says. The pig.

720
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,500
- Well, I've always owned pigs.
- Oh, tit.

721
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,300
Right.

722
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,700
Now, make sure it's ready
in time for the ball.

723
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,400
Ah. Master.

724
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,000
- How's the treatment going?
- Well...

725
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,400
- Is he any better?
- Yeah, well...

726
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,500
It's impossible he could look any worse.

727
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,300
Is that you, Maestro?
Maestro Guardi, is that you?

728
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,400
- Hello. Who's there?
- Good God. You achieved the impossible.

729
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,100
- Thank you.
- What have you smeared all over him?

730
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,400
- Lard, mostly. Mint jelly.
- Hello?

731
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,400
- A few coffee grounds.
- Yes. Coffee grounds. Well done.

732
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,200
- Signore.
- Is it you, Maestro?

733
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,900
- Yes, Papprizzio.
- How do I look?

734
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,100
Well, let's see.

735
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,800
Yes. That's very good.
It's coming along quite nicely.

736
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,600
I've been asking your man for a mirror.
He can't seem to find one for me.

737
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,900
- Oh, well... Lupo, mirror?
- I can't find one anywhere.

738
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:48,700
After application of all your techniques,
I'm terribly anxious to check my progress.

739
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,200
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

740
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,100
Oh, there you are, Fulvio. Good man.

741
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,500
God.

742
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,100
It's working.

743
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,600
- It's working, isn't it?
- Yes.

744
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,200
- It's working.
- Yes, indeed.

745
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,900
You took my regrets, of course,
to the house of Bruni?

746
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,400
Yes.

747
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,600
- Good. Bad weather or some such?
- Yes. Of course I did.

748
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,900
What of Francesca? I told her
I'd take her to the carnival ball,

749
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,900
but I do think I need just a bit more time.

750
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,100
Yes, I think you're right.
You do need some more time.

751
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,800
- Listen. Don't worry. I'll handle that.
- Good man.

752
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,500
You relax.
Lupo, a little more around the belly.

753
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,200
Yes, Lupo. More on the belly.

754
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,600
Signore, Bishop Pucci wishes to see you.

755
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,200
Of course.

756
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,000
My name is Bernardo Guardi,
but I'm not the Bernardo Guardi.

757
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:52,000
Come along now, Bernardo.
There's no shame in being a writer.

758
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,600
Let's play a little game, shall we?

759
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,900
I'll read you a sentence and you finish it.

760
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,600
"A woman is air and... "

761
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,900
And what, Bernardo?

762
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:06,700
I don't know. Trouble?
No. No.

763
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,800
Wind? Air and wind?

764
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,800
No. I'll give you a little clue, shall I?

765
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,900
It's not the tea I object to.
It's the water.

766
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,600
So, Signor Papprizzio,
how well do you know Casanova?

767
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,700
Be careful how you answer.

768
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,700
I could become interested in you.

769
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,400
I was less than...

770
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,300
I was less than frank at Signora Bruni's.

771
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,900
It is Casanova I have come here to hang.

772
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,000
That fornicator who spits upon
the teachings of the Church.

773
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:55,000
Are you following me? Good. So why
did you go with Casanova to his house?

774
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,800
- I'm renting it from him.
- You're renting it?

775
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,700
- It's strictly business, of course.
- Business.

776
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,600
I believe he went
out of town for a day or two.

777
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,000
- Out of town?
- Yes.

778
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,900
Well, if I know anything, he's hardly
likely to absent himself from Carnevale.

779
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:20,600
Signor Papprizzio, if you'd help put an end
to this fornicator's career for good and all,

780
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,800
believe me, the Church
will be very grateful.

781
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,900
How grateful?

782
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,300
The lard concession at the Vatican.

783
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,800
Which is a lot of lard.

784
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,200
That's quite an attractive offer.

785
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,400
So we have a deal?

786
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,900
You will help deliver Casanova unto me?

787
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,000
As sure as my name is Papprizzio.

788
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,900
- Excuse me, Your Reverence.
- No.

789
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,100
This Bernardo Guardi we're racking,
I don't think he is the heretic.

790
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,100
I think someone is just using his name

791
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,700
- as a nom de plume.
- A nom...

792
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,600
Don't be clever, Andolini.
What do you mean you think?

793
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,200
The Inquisition is not paid to think. Be sure!

794
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:06,600
Well, I am pretty sure.
He can't read or write.

795
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,400
Lupo! Lupo!

796
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,800
- There is no lover!
- What?

797
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,700
- There is no secret lover.
- What?

798
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,000
She never had one.

799
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,100
Carnevale.

800
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,900
Talked of pigs all week.

801
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,200
- Darling, have you seen my husband?
- I am your husband.

802
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,300
- Any sign of Casanova, sir?
- I don't know what he looks like.

803
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,700
But he's bound to be here.
He wouldn't miss the carnival.

804
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,900
Signor Papprizzio.

805
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,900
See? Everybody's here.
We just have to find them.

806
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,900
Victoria?

807
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,000
Victoria!

808
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,900
Good evening, sir.

809
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,100
Signor Pizzani and Signora.

810
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,200
You're welcome.

811
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,000
Signor Papprizzio of Genoa
escorting Signorina Bruni.

812
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,100
You're welcome.

813
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,100
Signor Dandolo and Signora.

814
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,500
You're welcome.

815
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,800
- Signor Papprizzio.
- Mother Bruni.

816
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,200
We must introduce you
to everyone we know.

817
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,900
Yes, this should be interesting.

818
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,200
- Will you do me the honor, signora?
- May I?

819
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,600
- Well, I'm free.
- I...

820
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,600
- Be my guest.
- Watch this.

821
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,800
Signor Casanova,
I have a message from your fiancée.

822
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,800
- Ah, which one?
- Signorina Donato.

823
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,500
She's in the piazza.
She's waiting for you to escort her in.

824
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,700
Good Lord!

825
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,300
Come.

826
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,600
Don't worry.
You're not my first virgin.

827
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,100
- Victoria.
- Casanova.

828
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,800
Something is not right.

829
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,100
Do we have the address
of Casanova's house?

830
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,700
Then I think now is the time
for positive action.

831
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,300
Lord and Lady Devonshire.

832
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,000
You're welcome.

833
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,600
Signor Casanova
and Signorina Donato.

834
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,600
Signor Casanova.

835
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:32,700
Enchanting.
I'm so very pleased for you and me.

836
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,400
- When's the wedding?
- Soon, Your Grace.

837
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,000
You're welcome.

838
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,700
Ambassador Gritti and Signora.

839
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,200
- My darling.
- Giacomo, where can we go?

840
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,200
- Find somewhere.
- Find somewhere? No, no.

841
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:03,800
- I can't wait any longer.
- Sit down. Very good.

842
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:07,100
Wait here and I'll come back
with a glass of wine.

843
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,600
- Casanova.
- How wonderful to see you.

844
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,900
What are you doing down there? No.

845
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,300
There he is.

846
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,200
- We danced off our feet.
- You danced off your feet. How lovely.

847
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,200
That's better.

848
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,400
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

849
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,900
- Signore.
- Yea-ah!

850
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:10,100
It's Signor Donato from across the canal.

851
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,500
I just said that.

852
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,600
- May I?
- Please.

853
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,700
Thank you.

854
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,100
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just hot.

855
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,900
- I didn't see you in church.
- Well, I was there.

856
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,400
I know, but I wasn't.

857
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,000
- Do you know Signor...
- Yes. I'm the future son-in-law.

858
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,400
- That's right.
- Yes!

859
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,000
- Congratulations are in order.
- Yes.

860
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:44,000
Thank you.

861
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,900
No. No, I mean...

862
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,900
No. Yes. Congratulations are in order.

863
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,600
I just said that.

864
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,300
Congratulations.
You must be pleased for Victoria.

865
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,100
That reminds me.
Have you seen Victoria?

866
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,600
No, no. That's true.

867
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,700
I thought she'd be here
with her... her fiance.

868
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,000
That's true. I haven't seen her anywhere.
I think she's...

869
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,000
I had forbidden her to come,
but she has defied me.

870
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,700
- She must have changed.
- She has.

871
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:20,900
I suppose getting engaged
to the famous Casanova

872
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,000
has gone to her head.

873
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,800
- What is the matter with this table?
- It's a good table. It's fine.

874
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:30,900
I'm a traditionalist.
No intercourse before the wedding.

875
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,900
- Social intercourse.
- There's somebody under the table.

876
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:37,300
- Which table?
- This table!

877
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,100
Is this the palazzo of Signor Casanova?

878
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,600
Yes, sir. He's right in here,
Your Excellency.

879
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:04,200
So, Signor Casanova,
not out of town after all, I see.

880
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,700
I find it difficult to believe
this is what women want.

881
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:12,900
Yeah. Here, little piggy.
Come, little piggy.

882
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,700
- Andolini...
- Sir, I think...

883
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,700
Don't think. Just do what you do.

884
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:25,100
Stop the treatment!
I don't like this part of the treatment!

885
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,900
- So, what progress?
- He seems confused.

886
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,900
Fornication on a massive scale
leads to confusion.

887
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,000
- Signor Casanova.
- I'm Papprizzio of Genoa.

888
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,800
Unfortunately for you, I am intimately
acquainted with Signor Papprizzio.

889
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:51,300
- I've had tea with him.
- Ask Fulvio.

890
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,500
Fulvio, tell him. Tell him, Fulvio.

891
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,400
Sir.

892
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,300
So who is...?

893
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,200
- So you are Papprizzio.
- It's what I've been saying, stupid.

894
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,700
Well, Signor Papprizzio,
maybe you'll tell me the whereabouts

895
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,300
of the owner of the palazzo
where you're staying.

896
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,900
- Signor...
- Guardi.

897
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,600
Signor Bernardo Guardi is my host here.

898
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,000
I'm staying at his place, taking his course.
He designed my treatment.

899
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,400
Do you realise Guardi is a heretic?

900
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,700
Your Reverence,
Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume.

901
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,300
Then if

902
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,100
Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume

903
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:03,200
perhaps the plume's nom is

904
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,700
Casanova.

905
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:10,200
- Casanova?
- It was staring us in the face all along.

906
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,900
The glorification of women, et cetera.
Boring, boring, boring.

907
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:18,900
- Casanova is Bernardo Guardi.
- Bravo, Your Reverence.

908
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,300
Good Lord.
He's taken my fiancée to the ball.

909
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,600
Not for long, he's not.
Get your men together and come with me.

910
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,900
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the ball.

911
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,900
Well, so are we!

912
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,800
- You're right. She's here.
- Where?

913
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,600
Right over there. See?
You should take her home.

914
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:57,200
- You see, I'm a traditionalist myself.
- Signor Valmarana and Signora.

915
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,000
At least someone's madean effort.

916
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:03,700
Excuse me.
I say, at least somebody's made an effort.

917
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,900
Now that is purple.

918
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:10,600
That's not Venetian, is it?
Am I wrong? That is a...

919
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,800
London? Paris? Rome?
Is it...

920
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,900
It's almost a papal purple.

921
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,500
It reminds me of something.
Don't tell me.

922
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,800
- Inquisitor Pucci.
- Inquisitor Pucci.

923
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,400
Yes, I know.
I heard you were in Venice.

924
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,800
- Come for a dance?
- I'm here to arrest Giacomo Casanova.

925
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,100
Casanova is about to marry
a young woman famous for her modesty.

926
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:43,000
His slate is wiped clean,
and he's under my protection.

927
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,400
Does your protection extend to heretics?

928
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,900
Beware, Doge.
Your city's freedom

929
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,800
dangles from the belt of the Vatican.

930
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,100
You're welcome.

931
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,800
- Admiral Massimo Canal and Signora.
- You're welcome.

932
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,500
Where's Francesca?

933
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,300
My name is Pietro Papprizzio
and I'm from Genoa.

934
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,000
What?

935
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,000
Signor Papprizzio of Genoa.

936
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,600
So you're Papprizzio?

937
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,900
From Genoa?

938
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,400
Is your name...

939
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,300
Bruni.

940
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,800
I'm your...

941
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,000
I'm your future...

942
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,900
I never dreamt you'd be so beautiful.

943
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,900
Me?

944
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,900
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

945
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,100
Why...

946
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,100
No. No, I'm your future mother-in-law.

947
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,900
- My mother-in-law?
- Yes.

948
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,900
- I'm not betrothed to you?
- No, to my daughter.

949
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,900
Some people find her beautiful.

950
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,300
- There's a man who's after her.
- Really? Does she like him?

951
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,100
Signora Bruni, your daughter has been
duped by none other than Casanova.

952
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,200
But worry not. He's as good as...

953
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:29,600
Why don't you stop interfering, all right?

954
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,200
Thank you.

955
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,500
Well.

956
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,400
Signorina.

957
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,100
I was afraid I'd lost you.

958
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,800
As one might lose a pocket watch,
Signor Papprizzio,

959
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
or some other valuable possession?

960
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,800
I know that no man will ever own you.

961
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,200
But to be your defender
on the road you travel,

962
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:14,300
to show you the world as you've
never seen it, for that I hold my hopes.

963
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,200
Let's start by taking
one step closer to heaven.

964
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,200
You get this one here.

965
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,300
Ready. On the count of three.

966
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,500
One, two, three.

967
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,700
Witchcraft.

968
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:35,600
Actually, I believe it's because hot air rises,
overcoming the gravitational force of...

969
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,100
Witchcraft.

970
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,000
Here we are.

971
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,200
Look! It's Casanova with his new fiancée.

972
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:07,700
Casanova.

973
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,700
Come on.

974
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,700
Is that Francesca?

975
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,900
- It is her.
- That's Francesca.

976
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:19,600
- I've never seen her look so happy.
- Really?

977
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,200
Such bad news for you, Signor Papprizzio.

978
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,800
O calamity.
She's thrown me over.

979
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,100
- Disgraceful.
- Oh, well. A scandal.

980
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,900
- You're a free man.
- Oh, dear.

981
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:48,000
What will I do?

982
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:10,400
Thank you, Signor Papprizzio.

983
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,700
I'm beginning to believe
that your heart is true.

984
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,600
There is more of the lover
than the merchant in you.

985
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:23,900
Why didn't you tell me
you were my betrothed?

986
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,400
You didn't trust me?

987
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,800
Well, why didn't you tell me
you were Bernardo Guardi?

988
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,700
It's all right.
I won't tell anyone.

989
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:48,000
I should've guessed the first time I saw you
in that citadel of male complacency

990
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,900
when you were as brave in debate
as you were later in duel.

991
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,600
You were Bernardo Guardi
in beauty's mask.

992
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,300
I'm in love with you, Francesca.

993
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,500
You were at the debate?

994
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,900
Yes. Yes, I was.

995
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,100
At the university.

996
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,300
Francesca...

997
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:33,200
Just as you had honest reason
for not telling me who you were,

998
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,700
I, too, have honest reason...

999
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,400
What?

1000
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,200
I can explain this.

1001
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,500
Are you Papprizzio?

1002
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:04,200
Tell me you're Papprizzio, my betrothed.

1003
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,100
Who are you?

1004
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,900
I'm Casanova.

1005
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,700
What?

1006
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,600
I'm... I'm Giacomo Casanova.

1007
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,000
You stand for everything I write against.

1008
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:36,000
- Wasn't that before you knew me?
- I don't know you.

1009
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,900
Which one of you?

1010
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:54,900
I think I liked you better in your masks.
At least Salvato was a gentleman.

1011
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:59,100
Papprizzio was promising.
But Casanova, I despise.

1012
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,100
You dare to say you love me.

1013
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:06,600
I would save myself for the kind of love
which a man would give his life for.

1014
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,500
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

1015
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,100
Casanova.

1016
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,000
Signor Casanova.

1017
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,900
I'm here to arrest you
as a fornicator, a charlatan,

1018
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:34,000
and, above all, a coward
who hides behind the name of another -

1019
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,000
Signor Bernardo Guardi.

1020
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:44,300
And as Bernardo Guardi,
I arrest you as a heretic.

1021
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:48,400
- What? He's not...
- Yes, signorina, he is.

1022
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,900
- He's not...
- Francesca, don't.

1023
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,100
No.

1024
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,500
I'm Bernardo Guardi.

1025
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,900
Bishop Pucci.

1026
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,800
How can I help you, my dear?

1027
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,900
I was a virgin.

1028
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:11,500
My virginity was
my most cherished possession -

1029
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,900
my gift from God.

1030
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,400
My gift was taken from me.

1031
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,700
Tragic and most damnable.
What was the name of this vile seducer?

1032
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,100
Giacomo Casanova.

1033
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:31,300
When Casanova came to my room
and robbed me

1034
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,600
I fought for my honor.

1035
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:40,100
Are you saying you'd be willing to give me
the testimony that I need to hang him?

1036
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,000
Yes.

1037
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:45,100
But I would worry about my reputation.

1038
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:50,100
Of course. But I think we could say
if everything went according to plan,

1039
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,700
we could return your reputation
and your virginity to you.

1040
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,100
- You could do that?
- Oh, yes.

1041
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,200
We are the Catholic Church.
We can do anything.

1042
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,100
Excuse me.
When is my turn?

1043
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,100
Give me a man who is man enough

1044
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:27,000
to give himself
just to the woman who is worth him.

1045
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,600
And if that woman were me,

1046
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,900
I would love him alone and forever.

1047
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,900
Thank you very much.

1048
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,300
- Are you sure I don't owe you anything?
- On the contrary.

1049
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,000
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1050
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:36,700
- Bye.
- Come back.

1051
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,800
You're... You're the boy in the window.

1052
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,200
Signorina Donato.

1053
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,400
We won't forget you.

1054
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,900
You'll be a legend among the girls.

1055
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,300
- This is terrible.
- Why?

1056
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,200
I've loved you hopelessly for years.

1057
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,300
Why didn't you say?

1058
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:23,600
My Lord, the prisoner is being represented
by a Dr Giordano of Padua.

1059
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,800
Then I call the defense, Dr Giordano.

1060
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,600
It is a case of mistaken identity,
Your Grace.

1061
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,600
- What? Mistaken...
- Yes.

1062
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,000
This man is not Bernardo Guardi.

1063
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,000
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, I am.

1064
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,800
- You see?
- He is protecting someone.

1065
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,500
- No.
- Yes, you are.

1066
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,700
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are... not.

1067
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,100
Protecting who?

1068
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,400
The woman who loves him.

1069
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:04,500
If you are who you say, perhaps you could
indulge the court with a few samples

1070
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,400
of your more renowned
philosophies on women.

1071
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:14,100
If I've said I am Bernardo Guardi,
does that not suffice?

1072
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,700
My Lord, must we listen to this
stuttering heretic? He has self-confessed.

1073
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,300
Is that all that you require?
A confession?

1074
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,200
Well, yes. I suppose so.

1075
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,900
Good.

1076
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:36,300
Because I am the one with
the manuscripts, written in my own hand.

1077
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,900
I am the only one with proof that I...

1078
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,900
I am Bernardo Guardi.

1079
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,400
You?

1080
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,400
- Francesca.
- Do you really think I'd let you die for me?

1081
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,400
Well, then, release the prisoner Casanova.

1082
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:56,900
My Lord, my Lord,
let us not forget this is a court of law.

1083
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,200
We still have a self-confessed heretic.

1084
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:04,500
And we also have
a notorious seducer,

1085
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,100
an adulterer, a violator of virgins

1086
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,400
whose guilt I will prove
by the testimony of...

1087
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,200
No!

1088
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,200
It wasn't true.

1089
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,200
Of...

1090
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:24,600
By the testimony of no less
than 127 sworn statements,

1091
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:29,000
attesting to the libidinous lust
of Giacomo Casanova.

1092
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,900
There is only one verdict
open to this court: guilty.

1093
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:38,300
And one sentence: death.

1094
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:42,700
- Death to the heretic Bernardo Guardi.
- No!

1095
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,600
And death to the master fornicator

1096
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,400
Giacomo Casanova.

1097
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,800
- You did say the cardinal's coming.
- I did, sir.

1098
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,700
Your Reverence,
I don't think we can wait any longer.

1099
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,900
Very well.

1100
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,800
I shall have to do it without him.

1101
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,500
Cardinal Lopresta has arrived!

1102
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,700
Sorry we're late.
Canals, et cetera.

1103
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,800
Your Eminence.
Bishop Pucci.

1104
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,000
An honor to meet you at last.

1105
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:17,300
- I've heard so much about you.
- Thank you.

1106
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,800
What's happening here?

1107
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,300
Just hanging a heretic and Casanova.

1108
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,700
What luck.

1109
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,000
My nurse.

1110
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,600
And does your nurse enjoy executions?

1111
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,300
Does the pope have a balcony?

1112
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:41,000
What I actually came to say is this.

1113
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,900
Venetians!

1114
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,400
Greetings from His Holiness.

1115
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:54,700
As you know,
today is the pope's birthday.

1116
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,100
- And...
- Did you know that?

1117
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:02,800
And in honor of his birthday,
His Holiness has decreed

1118
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:08,300
a papal pardon for all those
who would be executed

1119
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:12,000
on this happy day.

1120
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,400
- Your Eminence.
- Free the prisoners.

1121
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,600
Free the prisoners!

1122
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:26,400
Your Eminence.
No. No. No.

1123
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,200
You don't seem to share
the pope's happiness on his birthday.

1124
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,100
No, I do. I do.

1125
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,600
How old is he?

1126
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,900
I'm not quite sure.

1127
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:47,600
- No, no...
- Best stay here. Crowd's turning ugly.

1128
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:56,900
Please join me in my coach.
We're leaving for my country house.

1129
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,100
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1130
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:25,600
My fault. I'm to blame.

1131
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:27,900
Tito.

1132
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
The love of my life.

1133
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:35,300
This is my son.

1134
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,600
I've played cardinals before, of course.
You may have seen me.

1135
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:44,700
Anyway, we left our troupe in Trieste when
we heard the news. Had to move fast.

1136
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,400
Mom, the paint is wet.

1137
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,100
It says "Theatre Troupe" here.

1138
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,800
Cardinal Lopresta has arrived!

1139
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,500
Arrest those impostors!

1140
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,400
Move! Get out of the way!

1141
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,900
Giacomo!

1142
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:18,800
- Come on!
- Come on! Out of the way, people!

1143
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,800
Casanova!

1144
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,900
On you get, darling.
Quick as a bunny.

1145
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:46,800
I didn't know it was the pope's birthday.

1146
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:31,300
So how goes things?

1147
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,800
It's very exciting, isn't it?

1148
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,800
This is the last time I'm traveling coach.

1149
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,900
Hold on, everyone!

1150
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,900
Hang on!

1151
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,400
- Easy, boy!
- Tito!

1152
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,600
Everybody off.

1153
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:14,500
Hello, darling.
I'm your future stepfather.

1154
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,900
- I was always faithful to you.
- I never had any doubt. None at all.

1155
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:23,400
Come on, darling.
Let's escape on my barge. It's by the water.

1156
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,400
That way.

1157
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,700
Charge!

1158
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:41,300
Oh, dear.

1159
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,500
Giovanni!

1160
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:21,900
Step lightly, darling.
Excuse us. Excuse us.

1161
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:24,200
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Excuse us.

1162
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,800
This way, darling.
This way.

1163
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:32,900
I can't wait for you to see the boat. Here's
the boat. Right this way. On your new boat.

1164
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,500
- Vittorio. Vittorio.
- Careful. Careful.

1165
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,400
- I'm behind you.
- This way.

1166
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:41,800
No, my baby. Listen.
You're staying behind with me.

1167
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:46,400
Prepare to sail, men.

1168
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:51,500
Oh, dear.

1169
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,800
Vittorio, do something useful.

1170
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:59,100
- Signora, what can I do?
- Something useful.

1171
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,900
Giovanni!

1172
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:04,000
Come on! Come on!

1173
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,200
Quickly! Quickly!

1174
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,200
I can't come with you.
If I do, they'll follow us both.

1175
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:14,900
What?

1176
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:17,700
- You mean they'll follow Casanova?
- That's right.

1177
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:21,500
What if he never left?

1178
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,200
I could do it.

1179
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:31,100
There's more to this than just the name.

1180
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:35,100
I wouldn't mind being Casanova.

1181
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:41,500
- I wouldn't mind being on that boat.
- And I wouldn't mind my wedding.

1182
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,800
Well, come on.

1183
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:51,100
- Come on.
- Lupo, where you going?

1184
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:52,900
I'm staying.

1185
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,900
- Why?
- I'm a Venetian, sir.

1186
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:58,900
My place is with Casanova.

1187
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:04,800
Take care of me, my good friend.

1188
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,200
Of course, Master.

1189
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:38,000
After them!

1190
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,300
Better luck next time!

1191
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:56,500
- Andolini, get the boats after them!
- Farewell, simpletons!

1192
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,900
Get after them!

1193
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,000
Go on!

1194
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,600
I told you I'd come back.

1195
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:40,200
It's a wonderful life, an actor's life.

1196
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,600
You'll love it.

1197
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,900
Who writes your plays?

1198
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:56,400
Come inside.

1199
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:04,200
Lovely.

1200
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:07,200
Just my kind of good weather.

1201
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:46,500
Which is why the story
of Casanova and Francesca

1202
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,400
isn't mine to tell.

1203
01:44:55,200 --> 01:45:00,800
Victoria and I lived happily ever after.

1204
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:07,100
Just not together.

1205
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:12,000
Venice.

1206
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:17,100
So soon enough, in people's minds,

1207
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:20,000
Casanova was back.

1208
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:23,300
If I may say so,

1209
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:26,900
I believe I rose worthily to the occasion

1210
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:33,200
and added many glorious chapters
to the legend,

1211
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:38,700
while I kept the secret

1212
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,200
of the true love

1213
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:44,700
of the man who was

1214
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Casanova.
