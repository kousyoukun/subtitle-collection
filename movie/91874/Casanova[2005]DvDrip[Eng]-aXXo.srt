1
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,251
10,000 pages.

2
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,732
My life and loves.

3
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,054
That's just about
one woman for every page.

4
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,014
God, I'm tired.

5
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,931
But there is one story
I haven't put down.

6
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,411
Francesca.

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,088
That's a story
which isn't mine to tell, really.

8
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,171
So keep it to yourself.

9
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,133
- For how long?
- I don't know how long.

10
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,975
- It's a man, and you're a whore.
- I'm an actress.

11
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,369
What's the difference?

12
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,929
Giacomo.

13
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,454
You be good for your grandmother.

14
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,412
- Now, you know I love you very much.
- Mama.

15
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,449
Listen to me.
Look out there.

16
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,056
Know one day you'll come back to Venice

17
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,735
and I'll return for you.

18
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,050
I promise.

19
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,691
I promise.

20
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,894
She means when I am dead.

21
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,048
It's not her fault.
It's in the blood.

22
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,497
Aheat for love. Irresistible.

23
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,896
Irresistible.

24
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,737
Sophia, my love!

25
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,619
My husband.

26
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,694
Your husband is the luckiest man in Venice
and doesn't know it.

27
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,691
And it's lucky he's not in Venice.

28
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,058
Sweet darling,
I love you like no other.

29
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,370
You are my dreams come true.

30
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,293
Please, please make love to me again.

31
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,894
Casanova, tell me I'm the only one.

32
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,813
Of course. I always do.

33
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,973
- Darling, I'm home!
- My husband!

34
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,056
I know Casanova well.
It's just like him.

35
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,496
- Has the iceman come yet?
- Yes.

36
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,855
And he comes again tomorrow...

37
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,938
Don't believe what people say.

38
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,217
I don't conquer. I submit.

39
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,090
I've never sought glory as a lover.

40
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,014
Well, what then,
Signor Casanova, do you seek?

41
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,209
A moment that lasts a lifetime.

42
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,496
So, tell me.

43
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,289
This unusual order of nuns you belong to.

44
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,168
Is it a very strict order?

45
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,373
Very. No

46
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,770
jewels or nice clothes before sundown

47
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,169
and back in our cells by...

48
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,134
- Heavens! Is that the time?
- You don't have to go.

49
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,131
I must.
It's been delightful. Only...

50
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,734
Only...

51
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,654
How do I know you're really Casanova?

52
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,411
Yes! Yes!

53
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,415
Casanova.

54
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,173
- The Inquisition is here looking for you.
- No.

55
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,773
Forgive me.

56
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,972
Quick. If they catch you,
they'll hang you.

57
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,579
Giacomo, wait.
Tell me I was the one.

58
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,571
You are the one.

59
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,453
- You won't forget me, will you?
- No, I could never.

60
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,578
- Casanova. For you.
- Thank you.

61
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,655
- Where is Casanova?
- I've taken a vow of si...

62
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,017
Eternal damnation.
For one night with Casanova.

63
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,732
Seems fair.

64
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,891
We've got him.

65
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,131
Come on.

66
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,810
..hours of study by respected thinkers
of our time, including myself.

67
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,696
I'm not old-fashioned in this matter.

68
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,695
I do not say a woman's place
is at the hearth and in the bed.

69
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,170
What I do say...
Of course it is their place.

70
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,529
What I do say
is let them be educated at home.

71
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,929
On the higher planes
of science and philosophy,

72
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,898
women serve only to distract us,

73
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,097
to bring us down
to our earthly appetites.

74
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,732
So I say no woman shall ever
set foot inside this university.

75
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,414
Let my opponent take the floor.

76
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,531
And now Dr. Giordano of Padua.

77
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,579
- Too late, gentlemen.
- Silence!

78
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,333
Let me show you
who is bringing whom down to earth.

79
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,490
A woman is air and fire
and lightness and strength.

80
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,219
Like this little vessel

81
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,098
that would rise up to heaven
were it not held down by ballast -

82
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,057
bags of sand.

83
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,779
The dead weight of men
with their heads full of sand.

84
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,977
Only a woman would argue
by this demonstration of a toy.

85
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,692
It would never strike the superior intellect of
a man, or I'll eat my words.

86
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,296
Eat these briefs, signor, for these are the
words of the philosopher Bernardo Guardi,

87
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,450
who was said to live in this very city.

88
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,418
Bernardo Guardi. That madman.

89
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,094
Wait until the Inquisition
catches up with him.

90
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,852
Call him a madman,

91
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,979
but he has more understanding of women
than any man in this room.

92
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,779
And I'll wager he has better luck
with them in bed as well.

93
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,339
Strumpet.

94
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,536
There he is! Over there!

95
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,693
Stop him!

96
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,778
Hold him!

97
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,055
Gentlemen, my apologies.

98
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,778
You see?

99
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,420
The dead weight of men.

100
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,139
But I didn't know
what was happening. He...

101
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,131
He bewitched me.

102
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,734
He said he was the Holy Ghost.

103
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,652
And it's happened before.

104
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,410
You are charged with
debauchery, trespass, heresy.

105
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,810
To wit: fornication with a novice.

106
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,538
Well, she was hardly a novice.

107
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,408
For which the punishment is death
by hanging, tomorrow at dawn.

108
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,498
And this time your admirers in high places
won't be able to help you.

109
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,775
Excuse me, Inquisitor.
The doge.

110
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,135
Dalfonso.

111
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,456
Prince, we were just talking about you.

112
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,768
What brings you here?

113
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,330
- I have a special interest...
- I have a special interest.

114
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,499
This time the prisoner has been
condemned on the evidence of a nun.

115
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,175
A special interest in your witness.

116
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,332
- Sister Beatrice?
- I need a word.

117
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,011
For God's sake,
don't you know who she is?

118
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,218
- Who?
- Cardinal Lopresta's mistress in waiting.

119
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,258
He entrusted me with safeguarding
her virginity for him alone.

120
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,298
She's leaving for Rome today.

121
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,929
Your witness
is Cardinal Lopresta's sister, Beatrice.

122
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,979
His sister? Oh, God!
Those Romans.

123
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,415
Think about it, Father Dalfonso.

124
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,779
Who's going to get the blame
for dragging her into the Casanova affair?

125
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,499
Take your time.

126
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,298
Me?

127
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,374
Signor Casanova, this seems to be
another case of mistaken identity.

128
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,570
You are free to go.

129
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,419
You know I'm your friend,
but I'm being threatened by Rome.

130
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,651
Venice, I'm afraid,
is perceived as a hotbed of...

131
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,892
Well, as one enormous hot bed

132
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,531
with silk sheets and heretical books
under the mattress.

133
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:15,013
The people here are given over to
physical pleasure and skepticism.

134
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,456
Do not abuse my sympathy
for you, Casanova.

135
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,412
I'm expelling you from Venice.

136
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,936
Your Excellency, I worship beauty.
There's no harm in that, is there?

137
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,739
- Worship it in Paris, London.
- I can't leave Venice.

138
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,778
- Why?
- I'm waiting for someone.

139
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,536
- She may let you down.
- No. She promised she'll come one day.

140
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,736
You don't understand.

141
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,732
I'm expelling you from Venice
for your own good.

142
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,890
- Unless...
- Unless what?

143
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,335
Unless you find yourself a respectable wife.

144
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,093
A good woman from a good family
will give you protection.

145
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,135
A wife?

146
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,248
It will soon be the time of Carnevale
when authority winks at our indiscretions.

147
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,377
- You're bad enough during Lent.
- But Carnival's in a few days.

148
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,089
You better not waste any more time then.

149
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,171
- Meanwhile, you're on good behavior.
- A wife?

150
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,171
- No scandals,...
- Getting married?

151
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,013
..duels, drunken escapades.

152
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,649
Morning, Lupo.

153
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,176
- We were worried about us.
- You were right to be.

154
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,570
- We're getting married.
- Congratulations. To whom?

155
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,572
Don't know yet.
Any callers?

156
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,538
Landlord, tailor, wine merchant,
usual creditors.

157
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,009
Look at the state of us.
Where have you been all night?

158
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,738
It's like being married already.

159
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,176
Can you get me some fresh clothes?
We have some shopping to do.

160
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,610
- The Contessa Morelli-D'Aosta.
- Yes, yes, yes. Oh, but, no, she snores.

161
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,488
Yes, I remember.
Lady Veronique Costello.

162
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,695
- Heavenly.
- Yeah.

163
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,977
- Duchess of Urfe.
- Yes.

164
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,735
- But didn't she poison her husband?
- Did she? I don't remember that.

165
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,131
Ah, Giulietta Badalamente.

166
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,656
Sadly, she hasn't
poisoned her husband yet.

167
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,617
Perhaps if we told us
what we're looking for.

168
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,931
I don't know. Beauty, modesty.

169
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,534
- Purity.
- All that.

170
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,849
Lupo. We have had a vision.

171
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,693
Still spying on your virgin?

172
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,499
She'll never look this way
if you don't make yourself known.

173
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,174
The whole town's talking about it.

174
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,898
It's just appalling.

175
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,529
You think those men liked hearing
they're no good in bed?

176
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,975
If they wanted that,
they'd go home to their wives.

177
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,858
Francesca, arrogance
in a woman is not attractive.

178
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,329
She's not arrogant.
She's just angry.

179
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,615
- Fruit, sir?
- Don't defend your sister.

180
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,056
It's true. She knows
she's smarter than most men,

181
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,132
which makes men pretend to be superior,

182
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,576
which makes her angry,
which is seen as arrogance.

183
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,209
Giovanni, come away from the window.
Our neighbours'll think you're a gargoyle.

184
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,053
No, Vittorio. Over there.

185
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,736
Francesca, this is a very important week as
you well know. You have responsibilities.

186
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,449
In a few days, thanks to you,
I won't be poor any more.

187
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,337
Much thanks to your father

188
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,130
who had the foresight to betroth her
to his rich cousin's eldest son in Genoa.

189
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,179
Listen to this.
"Mystery transvestite at university

190
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,296
overturns laws of gravity,

191
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,291
conjures devil from the air,

192
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,291
nearly starts fire."

193
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,011
God. Can't they get anything right?

194
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,094
Be thankful. I told you I'd not permit another
scandalous display at the university.

195
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,968
- There's too much at stake.
- Mother, I don't want to marry him.

196
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,497
- Please. I'll be damned if I do.
- Well, if you won't, I will.

197
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,614
That's funny, is it?

198
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,453
Well, I'm damned to be widowed
and gathering dust.

199
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,292
Mother.

200
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,131
Well done.

201
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,415
I know why you're like this
about your fiance.

202
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,570
- Why I'm like what?
- Come on.

203
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,220
You're always slipping away in secret.

204
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,973
And you're thin.

205
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,939
It's obvious
you've already got a secret lover.

206
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,176
Well, don't tell.

207
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,216
Hello. A gift for your daughter.

208
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,417
I don't know what to say.
Thank you. It's magnificent.

209
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,298
But you don't know my daughter
and she doesn't know you.

210
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,769
Yes. But I know her reputation,
Signor Donato.

211
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,294
And everybody knows yours,
Signor Casanova.

212
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,053
I've always wondered
what you look like.

213
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,052
Quite ordinary, I can see that.

214
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,859
Well, how can I put this?

215
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,694
Victoria is that rare thing -
a Venetian virgin.

216
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,011
Yes, one hears of them,
but invariably it turns out that...

217
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,855
I am sorry. Do go on.

218
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,295
Thank you.
She's led a very protected life.

219
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,735
Never has an impure thought
crossed her mind.

220
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,809
Of course not.

221
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,052
She's never been alone in a room with a
man, or even seen a man without his coat.

222
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,653
I've made sure of that.

223
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,528
There isn't anything I wouldn't do
to ensure her happy innocence.

224
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,295
- She should be in a nunnery, but...
- Heaven forbid.

225
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,292
- Exactly. One hears things.
- Yes.

226
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,214
On the other hand,
there is you, Signor Casanova,

227
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,053
the most notorious lover
of women in Venice,

228
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,179
reputed to have the longest list
of conquests ever known.

229
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,809
A virtuoso of the intimate caress

230
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,891
The maestro of multiple...

231
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,338
- What was that?
- I will come to love her, Signor Donato.

232
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,651
It's out of the question.
Your idea of love is sensuality,

233
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,779
to reduce women to quivering puddles of...

234
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,578
Victoria!

235
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,533
Are you all right?

236
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,976
I want him. I want him.
Please, please, Papa.

237
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,096
I'll never be happy without him.

238
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,536
- Congratulations. We're engaged.
- We are a marvel.

239
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,215
- I mean, actually getting married?
- Yes.

240
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,098
You have sullied my glove.

241
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,978
I mean, love. My love.

242
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,935
- I'm sorry. What did he just call us?
- We didn't sully it. It came out of nowhere.

243
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,410
Thank you.
You've sullied my love.

244
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,058
Victoria Donato is my fiancée.

245
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,539
- Is she?
- Yes.

246
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,772
- In the sense that I'm going to marry her.
- Well, she never mentioned that.

247
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,896
Of course she didn't.
I haven't asked her yet.

248
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,810
Wha...?

249
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,855
Here, sir.

250
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,898
What, are you two
working together now? Lupo.

251
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,572
San Cremori at dawn.

252
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,094
Listen. We decline to fight you, dear sir.

253
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,899
- You coward.
- We happen to be on good behavior.

254
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,858
You have no right to decline
to defend your honor.

255
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,578
It's our honor, so we have the right.

256
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,254
He who gets slapped has his rights.
Those are the rules.

257
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,853
See?

258
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,095
- Now, what did we do that for?
- I don't know.

259
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,539
San Cremori at dawn.

260
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,895
May I know of whom
I have the honor to be killing?

261
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,369
Lupo Salvato.

262
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,257
Thank you.

263
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,332
- Don't forget your glove.
- Thank you.

264
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,251
Surely we don't mean...

265
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,299
What's this "we"?
You slapped him. You fight him.

266
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,051
I see you're not laughing now.

267
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,017
Come on!

268
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,214
The apple is very distracting.

269
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,258
It's all right. I'll fight him.

270
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,649
I can be Lupo Salvato.

271
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,337
Bastard!

272
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,728
Signor Salvato.

273
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,691
Oh, dear.

274
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,493
This gentleman is here to explain
the terms of the duel and to see fair play.

275
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,299
- Very good.
- Your attention, please, gentlemen.

276
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,531
Stay behind the line until I give the word.

277
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,614
If one trips or falls, the other puts up
his sword until I say "continue".

278
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,655
Yes.

279
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,415
If a sword breaks,
your second hands you the spare sword.

280
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,695
- Do we have a spare sword?
- Yeah, we do.

281
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,578
First blood ends the duel.

282
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,293
Master!

283
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,572
Move. Go on.

284
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,292
Master!

285
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,010
It's the old switch game.

286
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,216
You'd have killed him.

287
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,609
And you are?

288
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,136
Francesca Bruni.
He's my brother.

289
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,375
- I'll take that, sir.
- Sorry, Signor Salvato.

290
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,020
I should think you would be sorry.

291
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,249
- It was all a case of mistaken identity.
- Mistaken identity?

292
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,049
Giovanni got it into his head
you were courting Signorina Donato.

293
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,051
- Did he?
- It's all over Venice.

294
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,928
The famously virginal Victoria Donato is
gonna marry the infamous rake, Casanova.

295
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,853
- Do you know him?
- Casanova. The philosopher,

296
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,296
who devotes his life to the perfection
of experience? Yes, I know him.

297
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,577
No. Casanova the libertine
who devotes his life to seducing women.

298
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,619
Well, we're obviously
talking about the same person.

299
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,090
There must be something deeply wrong
with a man like that, don't you think?

300
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,014
Something missing in his life.
True love, perhaps.

301
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,819
All love is true in different ways.

302
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,849
To say "l love falsely" is as self-
contradictory as saying "l believe falsely".

303
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,291
You are a philosopher, too.

304
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,974
I've spent countless hours
alone with Casanova,

305
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,133
pondering the ways of love and
how it makes us at one with the angels.

306
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,494
And with the beasts.

307
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,140
I will not debate with you
if you take the side of a man

308
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,769
whose idea of love
demands a female sacrifice every day.

309
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,457
I've no sympathy for women who think no
better of themselves than to be a plaything.

310
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,136
You tell your friend from me that what
he imagines being love is, in fact, self-love.

311
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,973
And self-love is self-doubt.

312
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,539
- Well said.
- Yes.

313
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,010
By the philosopher Bernardo Guardi.
You should read him, Signor Salvato.

314
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,614
- Clearly.
- Give me a man who is man enough

315
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,295
to give himself just to the woman
who is worth him.

316
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,737
If that woman were me,
I would love him alone and forever.

317
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,135
Goodbye, Signor Salvato.

318
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,498
If fighting continued, one of us
would have had good cause to be sorry.

319
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,694
The one still standing, I think.

320
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,129
Francesca Bruni.

321
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,415
- I want my money!
- Next week, without fail.

322
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,730
- You said that last week!
- I was a week early.

323
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,618
- Go to hell.
- I'll see you there. Thank you so much.

324
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,454
Honestly. Why, the nerve!

325
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,532
Can you believe this man?
I mean

326
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,895
does he know who we are?

327
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,972
He should be honored
to be owed money by the likes of us.

328
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,938
- Lupo.
- What?

329
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,695
I've made a terrible mistake.

330
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,649
- You have?
- Yes.

331
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,651
I have to find her.

332
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,898
Master, I'm a little confused.

333
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,653
- I thought we'd made our decision.
- Yes, I know.

334
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,377
Francesca!
He's arriving tomorrow.

335
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,496
Your fiance.

336
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,297
She has a fiance.

337
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,611
Well, so do you.

338
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,897
- Giovanni.
- Good day, Mario. How are you?

339
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,496
- I'm sorry.
- Giovanni, more disgrace.

340
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,654
- Allow me.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

341
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,571
Mama, this is Signor Salvato.

342
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,090
I understand you've had an unpleasant
encounter with my son this morning.

343
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,617
It was nothing more strenuous
than a morning's constitutional.

344
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,771
Come along.

345
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,818
Sorry.

346
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,812
- Your sister has a fiance?
- She's in love with Casanova.

347
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,016
- Who is?
- Victoria.

348
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,692
- My love. Remember?
- Oh, yes.

349
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,658
- Engaged to Casanova.
- Yes.

350
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,129
Well, you'll have to beat him
at his own game.

351
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,849
But how? I'm up against
a world-class seducer.

352
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,137
- Hello.
- So? What would Casanova do?

353
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,411
- I don't know. What would Casanova do?
- Well, to start, he wouldn't mope around.

354
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,889
- No, I suppose not.
- Misery is not attractive.

355
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,494
If you want to be loved,
you have to be worth loving.

356
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,175
That's the first rule.
And second

357
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,138
be the flame, not the moth.

358
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,818
- The flame, not the moth.
- Yes.

359
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,289
It's my tongue.
Got very loud.

360
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,538
So, your sister, is she happy
with this new fiance of hers?

361
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,690
No. She's never met him.

362
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,817
- Really?
- Besides, she has a secret lover.

363
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,608
- A secret lover?
- Yeah.

364
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,172
- Who?
- Well, I don't know. It's a secret.

365
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,416
Anyway, she's always
sneaking off in the... See?

366
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,411
I'm sorry.

367
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,251
Lupo, there she is.

368
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,573
Casanova.

369
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,934
We are buying Victoria's trousseau.

370
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,570
Only three days to go before the wedding.

371
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,092
Casanova.

372
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,651
No intercourse before the wedding.
I'm a traditionalist.

373
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,658
I mean social intercourse, of course.

374
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,410
Paolo. Paolo, let us off.

375
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,813
A secret lover.

376
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,415
He's going to bang her to pieces.

377
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,978
From Rome.

378
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,620
The Inquisitor's office.

379
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,897
"A cesspit of heresy and fornication."

380
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,619
Surely not...
Oh, they mean us.

381
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,810
1 27 complaints against Signor Casanova.
Do we know him?

382
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,133
You'll see there are suspicions Casanova
enjoys the protection of this very office.

383
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,972
That's absolutely rid...

384
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,379
It's either his neck or it's ours.

385
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,129
It better be his.
Get me my notebook.

386
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,172
Oh, dear.

387
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,020
She's completely worn him out.

388
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,171
I found his name.

389
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,453
He's a writer.

390
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,419
"The Subjugation of Women
by Bernardo Guardi."

391
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,732
No wonder. He's entered her head
and her heart as well.

392
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,972
"Here we live in the midst of masculine
domination and what be the result?"

393
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,335
"Half the population
is missing from the feast?"

394
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,255
"You have no right to property
and government, nay, not an opinion...

395
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,015
"lf ever a man wants to have
a woman fall in love with him,

396
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,456
all he need to say...

397
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,420
"All he need to say is,

398
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,652
'l have too long dominated
the conversation. What are..."'

399
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,732
..your thoughts on the matter?
What are your thoughts?

400
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,539
- Meat? I'm the tailor!
- So you are. Forgive me.

401
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,973
Thank you, sir.

402
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,132
What are...
What are your thoughts on the matter?

403
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,529
My thoughts?
Well, I'd say...

404
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,771
No, Lupo. I'm...
Could I have some tea?

405
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,009
Of course.

406
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,536
Mother, my fiance is turning up tomorrow.
What shall I do?

407
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,736
It's simple. Do your duty.

408
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,257
Is it my duty to marry a man
that I don't know just because he's rich?

409
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,413
Yes, it is. Your duty to your father
who had your best interest at heart.

410
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,049
Marriage is a safe haven, my darling.

411
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,370
And love?

412
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,371
Love?

413
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,135
Love is something else.

414
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,733
It's the weather being good every day,

415
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,450
because wind and rain
are just another kind of good weather.

416
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,054
That's love.

417
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,973
Perhaps when you see him,
you'll fall in love with your husband.

418
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,893
He's not my husband yet.

419
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,939
If you go against your father's wishes,
we'll continue living in debt,

420
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,534
at the mercy of everyone we owe.

421
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,134
- But if you honor the betrothal...
- The contract.

422
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,780
The betrothal

423
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,814
then our troubles will be over.

424
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,288
It's between you and your conscience.

425
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,297
Amen.

426
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,654
- Signor Salvato.
- I do come here to make confession.

427
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,050
- What are you doing?
- What am I here to confess?

428
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,859
Well, let's see.

429
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,454
Jealousy.

430
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,417
Pride.

431
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,175
Covetousness.

432
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,171
Despair.

433
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,571
And you?

434
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,216
I came to prepare my soul for marriage.

435
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,135
You're troubled, Signorina Bruni.

436
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,213
My troubles are nothing to you, signor,
and little enough to me.

437
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,177
To be bartered in marriage
is no small thing,

438
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,774
especially for a woman
of independent mind.

439
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,217
I see my brother's tongue wags again.
In future he can fight his own duels.

440
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,019
- You can't come in.
- It's all right. I'm a doctor.

441
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,533
You're not Casanova?

442
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,009
No. I can prove it
if you'll show me your chest.

443
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,251
- Are you often in church?
- I followed you.

444
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,895
Surely it is your friend Casanova
for whom fiancées add spice to the pursuit.

445
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,369
If you knew him,
you wouldn't be so quick to condemn him.

446
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,532
If you understood women,
you would not be so quick to defend him.

447
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,852
Love is not an affair of a night or a fortnight.

448
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,456
And true love doesn't grow
with the number of lovers. It wastes away.

449
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,134
- Where's your instrument?
- I'll get it out in a minute.

450
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,257
But you can't blame those
who seek love wherever they can.

451
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:19,494
Perhaps it's merely the murmur of the flesh
that hasn't known the flutter of the heart,

452
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,253
meant for an evening but not a lifetime.

453
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,537
But can't that still be love all the same?

454
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,214
It seems you're trying
to woo me, Signor Salvato,

455
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,689
by offering to make me
a notch on your bedpost.

456
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,819
Come now, we are speaking of Casanova,
and I am a different man.

457
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,336
You see, Casanova couldn't understand

458
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,856
that of all the ways love can be true, there...

459
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,249
there is one way.

460
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,455
And that way is the sum of all the others.

461
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,815
Now, I've too long
dominated the conversation.

462
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,733
What are your thoughts on the matter?

463
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,059
- What did you just say?
- What?

464
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,780
- I'm in hell.
- I'm busy.

465
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,216
Another note to your lover?
I'd tell him it's all over if I was you.

466
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,734
Go away.
I'm marrying Papprizzio.

467
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,778
- What did I do?
- Somebody came here

468
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,374
who wanted to read your latest pamphlet
before publication.

469
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,257
- What?
- Did you show someone my work?

470
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,777
I didn't show anyone anything, on the
memory of your father, whom I served well.

471
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,657
Until he fired you for stealing.

472
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,570
- Where's the manuscript?
- I took it to the printer's like I always do.

473
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,618
You write, I get it printed under my name,
I take the commission.

474
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,136
Everyone's happy except the priests.

475
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,690
- These new shoes, Guardi?
- Church gave them to me. They don't fit.

476
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,054
Don't lie.

477
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,938
This is an addition to page five.
Take it to the printer's.

478
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,138
Nobody came. Nobody bribed me.
Would I be sober if they had?

479
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,379
That's him.

480
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,256
- Here. Add this to chapter one.
- Thank you.

481
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,013
Guardi says, "Why should women lace
themselves out of their natural shape?"

482
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,614
- Casanova.
- Signorina.

483
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,214
I left my window open.

484
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,849
My darling, I have so many windows
and so little time.

485
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,657
Burn our corsets.

486
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,539
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. Forgive me. It was an involuntary...

487
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,258
Please let me help you.

488
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,810
"In the heart of every woman,
there is room for a pet."

489
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,460
"Dogs and cats provide
solace and affection."

490
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,579
"How rare is the man who knows
that the pet of choice for today's woman

491
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:54,370
is the intelligent and noble pig!"

492
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,655
- A pig?
- I'll pay for the damage. I'm well-endowed.

493
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,732
If you get my... I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

494
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,409
Will you tell your lady
that Signor Salvato is here with a gift?

495
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,856
My mistress says the pig cannot come in.

496
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,376
But the animal we'll take.

497
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,655
I have news about the fiance.
His name is Papprizzio.

498
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,618
He's from Genoa.
He's arriving at noon.

499
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,418
He's rich.

500
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,493
Of course he is.

501
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,733
Everything's turning
against us these days, Lupo.

502
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,852
- How much do we owe?
- About 1 500 lira.

503
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,538
Lay out our second-best suit, Lupo.

504
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,256
Who owns this tub?

505
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,849
I do, sir.

506
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,852
And I'm Pietro Papprizzio,
merchant of Genoa.

507
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,579
- And what's your cargo?
- Lard.

508
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,651
- Lard?
- Finest in the world.

509
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,618
- Tell him, Fulvio. Tell him.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,497
Tub of lard.

511
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,255
Do you mean to tell me you've never
heard of my lard? We'll have to fix that.

512
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:27,370
I want to see one of these posters on every
canal, street, water corner by morning.

513
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,178
- Understand?
- Sign here.

514
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,098
Signor Papprizzio?

515
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,855
- At your service, sir.
- On the contrary, I'm at yours.

516
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,172
The family of your fiancée sent me here to
greet you and to send you to your palazzo.

517
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,696
But palazzo?
I have a reservation at the Hotel Grifasi.

518
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,169
They didn't tell you?
The Grifasi is closed.

519
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,012
- Really? Why?
- Lupo.

520
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,136
- Rising damp, sir.
- Rising damp, indeed.

521
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,769
Palazzo, eh?
Well, lead on.

522
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:03,656
- My servant shall see to your baggage.
- I think you have everything under control.

523
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,290
The first thing I'm going to do

524
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,258
is call upon my betrothed

525
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,571
after I make myself presentable, of course.

526
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,299
Yes. And how long does that usually take?

527
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,893
"Casanova bought a pig."

528
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,450
"Casanova took the pig
to the Bruni house."

529
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,415
Clear it. Everything.

530
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,936
I'll take that.

531
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,291
Your Grace.

532
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:12,251
Inquisitore Dalfonso,
I am Bishop Pucci.

533
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,535
Oh, Bishop...

534
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,090
I have been instructed to relieve you
of your duties here in Venice.

535
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,252
To say that the pope is less than happy
with your rate of progress

536
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,093
is an understatement
of monumental proportions.

537
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,569
You and your entire staff

538
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,051
have been reassigned
to open a mission among the natives of

539
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,055
the equatorial region.

540
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,529
What kind of natives?

541
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:45,217
Let us just say, shall we,
they have a great hunger for religion.

542
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,930
So this place belonged
to the libertine Casanova, eh?

543
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,172
Yes, but he ran out on his debts, so

544
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,172
we got the villa at a very reasonable price.

545
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,330
Really? How reasonable?

546
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,614
Lupo?

547
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,850
- 1,600 lira.
- Yes.

548
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,615
- Get a receipt.
- Of course.

549
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,414
Do I get a bath for my 1,600 lira?

550
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,573
"Casanova bought a pig?"

551
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,573
"Casanova took pig to Bruni house."

552
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,209
"Casanova met with Papprizzio
at dockside."

553
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,895
"Took Papprizzio to his house."

554
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,894
Is there anybody here
who can explain this?

555
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,450
You sent them all away to be eaten.

556
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,374
Well, then we shall have to do
some footwork ourselves.

557
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,373
Papprizzio?
The pork fat mogul from Genoa?

558
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,809
We're here to discover
heresy and criminal licentiousness.

559
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,336
If there's bacon involved,
I dread to imagine the depths of depravity

560
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,888
we're going to find here in Venice.

561
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,655
I'm surprised,
but I have a good feeling about this city.

562
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,698
- Do you?
- There's a massive market for lard here,

563
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,296
and I plan to use a good old bit
of Genoan know-how to penetrate it.

564
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,417
- Good thinking.
- Handbills, newspapers.

565
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,891
- That's just what Venice is missing.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

566
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:28,098
- You have to keep an eye for that servant.
- What? He's gone out.

567
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,809
- He's gone out where?
- How am I supposed to know?

568
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:39,134
I've arranged a trinket for my beloved -
a little wedding present for my bride-to-be.

569
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,256
Would you like
an advanced demonstration?

570
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,853
Yes, please.

571
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,448
- It's very...
- That's wonderful. Exquisite.

572
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,259
Really. Yeah.

573
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,251
Who is it?

574
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,450
Was that him?

575
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,097
How am I supposed to know that?

576
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,928
What are we looking for?

577
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,093
I don't know.
Something. Anything.

578
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,452
I found the house, sir.
Signora Bruni and her daughter

579
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,453
request the pleasure
of your company for tea.

580
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,417
Good. Good.

581
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,015
The chartreuse then, I think, Fulvio.

582
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,931
Right away, Master.

583
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,855
I'm certainly looking forward to seeing her.

584
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,010
Hope that she's

585
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,011
not disappointed by me.

586
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,698
Hope that she doesn't think I'm...
I don't know.

587
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:17,739
What's the... What's the word?
The expression I'm looking for?

588
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,335
- Rotund?
- Excuse me. What did you say?

589
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,856
Would sir require
a small snack before tea?

590
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,856
Well, do you see that trunk
shaped vaguely like a salami?

591
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,012
- Yes.
- It's filled with salami.

592
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,891
- There you are.
- Yes.

593
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,131
- Now, very impressive.
- Thank you.

594
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,576
- The choice of lime is very slimming.
- You're too kind.

595
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,935
I must be off.
Didn't I have an appointment?

596
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,578
What? Oh. The publisher.

597
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,491
That was it.
To see how my new book is doing.

598
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,729
You're a writer.

599
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,050
- I've been known to scribble a bit.
- Bravo.

600
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,576
My master's a famous writer
of love and how to please ladies.

601
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,378
You've heard of Bernardo Guardi...

602
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,655
- Lupo, hush.
- But he's a friend.

603
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,332
- I'm so sorry.
- Bernardo Guardi?

604
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,730
- I can't believe it.
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

605
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,618
You, sir, are Bernardo Guardi?

606
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,813
That's my nom de plume.
But you must swear to tell no one.

607
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,334
I swear.
On my honor, sir.

608
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,419
My solemn vow.
Bernardo Guardi.

609
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,489
Fulvio, this will need some thinking about.

610
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,299
Yes, it does.
It's my great honor, sir.

611
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,935
Look at me.

612
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,489
I am.

613
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,653
Now look at that.

614
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,979
Yes, in truth, it is not an exact likeness, no.

615
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,689
Yeah. In Genoa, we call it advertising.

616
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,534
Yes. Fine. But so what of it?
If she loves you as you are...

617
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,330
She's never seen me.

618
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,973
- Not even a glimpse.
- Really?

619
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:12,656
Yes. Oh, dear, Master Guardi.
Take me under your tutelage, I beg you.

620
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,210
I'll pay you handsomely.
Whatever you like, I'll pay it.

621
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,733
You want me to tutor you?

622
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,415
I want you to transform me.
Transform me.

623
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,617
My dear man, but you have but an hour
until you must you meet her.

624
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,168
I don't want to go.
You can't make me go.

625
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,376
As it happens,
my new book, which isn't out yet,

626
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,257
deals with the outer man.

627
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:41,093
You see, the relation between the physical
and the spiritual is little understood.

628
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,936
Except by me, of course.

629
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,098
- Master Guardi.
- Yes?

630
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,535
Can you make me look like that?

631
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,138
- Yes, I can.
- Oh, God.

632
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,529
But it will take courage.
It will take time.

633
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,498
- Long confinement to this villa.
- Courage. Yes.

634
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,014
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

635
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,809
Fulvio. I will send my servant Fulvio
to the house of Bruni with a note.

636
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,097
- No need. I will pass that way myself.
- Oh, excellent.

637
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,569
Can we start? I want to start right now.

638
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,615
Lupo.

639
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,576
Lovely.

640
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,418
Giovanni! Signor Papprizzio
is expected at any moment.

641
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,218
Signor Salvato.

642
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,454
Vittorio, tell Signor Salvato
I am not at home.

643
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,573
Now, how strange.
I'm sure that I was invited to tea.

644
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,857
- You were?
- We're not having tea.

645
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,775
Forgive me.
I must have forgotten an invitation.

646
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:59,729
- You told my servant, I believe.
- We were expecting Francesca's fiance.

647
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,617
Indeed. And here he is.

648
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,859
Ladies, forgive me. It is time I presented
myself under my true colours.

649
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,575
Signorina Bruni,
my name is not Salvato.

650
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:15,370
You see before you
your most devoted and fortunate fiance,

651
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,294
Pietro Papprizzio,
all the way from Genoa.

652
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,812
Signor Papprizzio.

653
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:29,814
All the young women I met back in Genoa
concealed their true natures from me,

654
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,290
dazzled by dreams of an empire of pork.

655
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,049
They looked at me
and they saw a mountain of lard.

656
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,892
No, no, no. Not at all.

657
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,733
If anything, you need fattening up.

658
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,778
I don't like thin men.
Francesca's father was enormous.

659
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:49,138
Nevertheless, I remained true
to the fiancée that I'd never seen.

660
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:54,695
But I wanted to make sure before I declared
myself she likewise had kept herself for me

661
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,090
and hadn't been seduced by the first
charmer that came along with a...

662
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,533
Pig.

663
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,735
Perhaps you are the charmer
you warned me against, signor.

664
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,458
I'm engaged to be married,
and so far all I know about you is...

665
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,532
Perhaps you remember sending me this.

666
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:19,135
"To Pietro Papprizzio
from Francesca Bruni,

667
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,859
with my hopes."

668
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,771
Perhaps I should've brought
the other letters you wrote me.

669
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,252
The only desire I have
is that you'll come to love me.

670
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:54,529
And if you cannot or if there is someone
else for whom your heart beats in secret,

671
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,497
I shall release you from your engagement.

672
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,810
There isn't! There isn't.

673
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,458
His Eminence, Bishop Pucci.

674
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:14,210
- Perhaps I've come at a bad time.
- No. No, Your Excellency. We're delighted.

675
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,417
I should have sent word,
but since I've just arrived in Venice

676
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,255
and as your husband, the late ambassador,
was so regarded by the Holy See,

677
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,456
the pope was anxious to be remembered.

678
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,935
Allow me to introduce
my son-in-law-to-be Signor Papprizzio.

679
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,736
- Signor Papprizzio.
- Bishop.

680
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,334
- My daughter Francesca.
- My dear.

681
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,810
What is the pope's most feared inquisitor
doing in Venice, Bishop Pucci?

682
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,855
Francesca...

683
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,535
No, no. I'm delighted
that my reputation precedes me.

684
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,180
The Vatican sent me
to deal with moral problems.

685
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:53,209
- What kind of moral problems, Bishop?
- The usual. Fornication, heresy.

686
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,212
How exactly does
the Church define heresy?

687
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,450
Francesca!

688
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,737
I hardly think heresy
is a fit conversation for a young lady.

689
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,653
Why? Can't we be heretics?

690
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:09,734
I think my fiancée, Bishop Pucci,
wishes to learn more from you perhaps.

691
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,058
If you please.

692
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,371
Very well.

693
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,051
Heresy is an affront
to the teachings of the Church.

694
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,849
It is a rebellion against
our mores and our morals.

695
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,569
More to the point,
and you will understand this,

696
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,857
since you are a woman
and understand women's ways,

697
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,977
hence the concept of "whim",

698
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,374
heresy is whatever I say it is.

699
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,174
For example, that writer fellow,
Bernardo Guardi, he is a heretic.

700
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,852
And why is that?

701
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,249
Vittorio, where is the tea?

702
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,015
Guardi's words
cause women to feel dissatisfied

703
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,853
- and men to doubt their manhood.
- Really?

704
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:00,616
If you are an admirer of this Guardi fellow,
I have some very sad news for you.

705
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,213
He's written out.

706
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:07,137
My colleagues are scouring
the streets for him as we speak.

707
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,849
I'm so sorry.

708
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:17,491
- Bishop, will you take tea?
- Thank you, no. I have people to see.

709
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,335
Signorina Bruni.

710
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,891
May I have the honor
of accompanying you to the carnival ball?

711
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,775
But I've done nothing wrong.

712
00:55:39,076 --> 00:55:42,034
I'm innocent!
You've got the wrong man! Let me go!

713
00:55:42,476 --> 00:55:44,387
Come on. Come on.

714
00:55:50,756 --> 00:55:53,475
I have an urgent message for you
from Bernardo Guardi.

715
00:55:53,556 --> 00:55:55,069
Who are you?

716
00:55:55,156 --> 00:55:59,388
Never mind. The Chief Inquisitor from
Rome is here and he is out for blood.

717
00:55:59,476 --> 00:56:02,832
- Delay publishing the new pamphlet.
- You're a little late.

718
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:05,066
Oh, my God. Stop selling it.

719
00:56:05,156 --> 00:56:07,954
- Sorry.
- That's what it says. The pig.

720
00:56:08,036 --> 00:56:11,506
- Well, I've always owned pigs.
- Oh, tit.

721
00:56:25,476 --> 00:56:26,591
Right.

722
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:30,874
Now, make sure it's ready
in time for the ball.

723
00:56:30,956 --> 00:56:32,469
Ah. Master.

724
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,912
- How's the treatment going?
- Well...

725
00:56:35,996 --> 00:56:38,226
- Is he any better?
- Yeah, well...

726
00:56:38,316 --> 00:56:41,228
It's impossible he could look any worse.

727
00:56:41,316 --> 00:56:44,945
Is that you, Maestro?
Maestro Guardi, is that you?

728
00:56:45,036 --> 00:56:48,870
- Hello. Who's there?
- Good God. You achieved the impossible.

729
00:56:48,956 --> 00:56:51,390
- Thank you.
- What have you smeared all over him?

730
00:56:51,476 --> 00:56:54,513
- Lard, mostly. Mint jelly.
- Hello?

731
00:56:54,596 --> 00:56:57,429
- A few coffee grounds.
- Yes. Coffee grounds. Well done.

732
00:56:57,516 --> 00:56:59,188
- Signore.
- Is it you, Maestro?

733
00:56:59,276 --> 00:57:01,790
- Yes, Papprizzio.
- How do I look?

734
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,867
Well, let's see.

735
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:08,475
Yes. That's very good.
It's coming along quite nicely.

736
00:57:08,556 --> 00:57:12,071
I've been asking your man for a mirror.
He can't seem to find one for me.

737
00:57:12,156 --> 00:57:16,195
- Oh, well... Lupo, mirror?
- I can't find one anywhere.

738
00:57:16,276 --> 00:57:20,827
After application of all your techniques,
I'm terribly anxious to check my progress.

739
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:23,146
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

740
00:57:23,236 --> 00:57:25,989
Oh, there you are, Fulvio. Good man.

741
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:30,152
God.

742
00:57:31,956 --> 00:57:33,548
It's working.

743
00:57:34,676 --> 00:57:36,985
- It's working, isn't it?
- Yes.

744
00:57:37,076 --> 00:57:40,466
- It's working.
- Yes, indeed.

745
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:42,945
You took my regrets, of course,
to the house of Bruni?

746
00:57:43,036 --> 00:57:44,355
Yes.

747
00:57:44,436 --> 00:57:47,508
- Good. Bad weather or some such?
- Yes. Of course I did.

748
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:50,633
What of Francesca? I told her
I'd take her to the carnival ball,

749
00:57:50,716 --> 00:57:53,549
but I do think I need just a bit more time.

750
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,673
Yes, I think you're right.
You do need some more time.

751
00:57:56,756 --> 00:57:59,145
- Listen. Don't worry. I'll handle that.
- Good man.

752
00:57:59,236 --> 00:58:01,750
You relax.
Lupo, a little more around the belly.

753
00:58:01,836 --> 00:58:04,304
Yes, Lupo. More on the belly.

754
00:58:08,476 --> 00:58:11,434
Signore, Bishop Pucci wishes to see you.

755
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:12,915
Of course.

756
00:58:12,996 --> 00:58:16,750
My name is Bernardo Guardi,
but I'm not the Bernardo Guardi.

757
00:58:16,836 --> 00:58:21,591
Come along now, Bernardo.
There's no shame in being a writer.

758
00:58:21,676 --> 00:58:23,985
Let's play a little game, shall we?

759
00:58:24,076 --> 00:58:26,192
I'll read you a sentence and you finish it.

760
00:58:26,276 --> 00:58:28,744
"A woman is air and..."

761
00:58:28,836 --> 00:58:30,986
And what, Bernardo?

762
00:58:31,076 --> 00:58:35,627
I don't know. Trouble?
No. No.

763
00:58:35,716 --> 00:58:37,547
Wind? Air and wind?

764
00:58:37,636 --> 00:58:41,470
No. I'll give you a little clue, shall l?

765
00:58:45,196 --> 00:58:48,233
It's not the tea I object to.
It's the water.

766
00:58:49,116 --> 00:58:53,712
So, Signor Papprizzio,
how well do you know Casanova?

767
00:58:55,996 --> 00:58:58,590
Be careful how you answer.

768
00:58:58,676 --> 00:59:01,474
I could become interested in you.

769
00:59:05,076 --> 00:59:06,828
I was less than...

770
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:10,625
I was less than frank at Signora Bruni's.

771
00:59:10,716 --> 00:59:13,184
It is Casanova I have come here to hang.

772
00:59:13,276 --> 00:59:16,109
That fornicator who spits upon
the teachings of the Church.

773
00:59:16,196 --> 00:59:22,066
Are you following me? Good. So why
did you go with Casanova to his house?

774
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:24,545
- I'm renting it from him.
- You're renting it?

775
00:59:24,636 --> 00:59:27,309
- It's strictly business, of course.
- Business.

776
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:30,149
I believe he went
out of town for a day or two.

777
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:32,306
- Out of town?
- Yes.

778
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:39,188
Well, if I know anything, he's hardly
likely to absent himself from Carnevale.

779
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:46,511
Signor Papprizzio, if you'd help put an end
to this fornicator's career for good and all,

780
00:59:46,596 --> 00:59:50,509
believe me, the Church
will be very grateful.

781
00:59:50,596 --> 00:59:52,473
How grateful?

782
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:54,786
The lard concession at the Vatican.

783
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:58,107
Which is a lot of lard.

784
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,346
That's quite an attractive offer.

785
01:00:01,436 --> 01:00:03,472
So we have a deal?

786
01:00:03,556 --> 01:00:06,832
You will help deliver Casanova unto me?

787
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:08,827
As sure as my name is Papprizzio.

788
01:00:09,796 --> 01:00:11,673
- Excuse me, Your Reverence.
- No.

789
01:00:11,756 --> 01:00:15,749
This Bernardo Guardi we're racking,
I don't think he is the heretic.

790
01:00:15,836 --> 01:00:18,589
I think someone is just using his name

791
01:00:18,676 --> 01:00:21,031
- as a nom de plume.
- A nom...

792
01:00:21,116 --> 01:00:23,869
Don't be clever, Andolini.
What do you mean you think?

793
01:00:23,956 --> 01:00:26,311
The Inquisition is not paid to think. Be sure!

794
01:00:26,396 --> 01:00:30,628
Well, I am pretty sure.
He can't read or write.

795
01:00:33,316 --> 01:00:36,194
Lupo! Lupo!

796
01:00:37,396 --> 01:00:40,308
- There is no lover!
- What?

797
01:00:40,396 --> 01:00:42,148
- There is no secret lover.
- What?

798
01:00:42,236 --> 01:00:44,352
She never had one.

799
01:00:51,116 --> 01:00:53,027
Carnevale.

800
01:01:20,516 --> 01:01:22,586
Talked of pigs all week.

801
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:25,748
- Darling, have you seen my husband?
- I am your husband.

802
01:01:25,836 --> 01:01:30,785
- Any sign of Casanova, sir?
- I don't know what he looks like.

803
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:34,949
But he's bound to be here.
He wouldn't miss the carnival.

804
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:36,947
Signor Papprizzio.

805
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:40,874
See? Everybody's here.
We just have to find them.

806
01:02:13,436 --> 01:02:15,392
Victoria?

807
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:21,193
Victoria!

808
01:02:26,116 --> 01:02:27,708
Good evening, sir.

809
01:02:36,436 --> 01:02:38,506
Signor Pizzani and Signora.

810
01:02:38,596 --> 01:02:40,507
You're welcome.

811
01:02:42,756 --> 01:02:46,112
Signor Papprizzio of Genoa
escorting Signorina Bruni.

812
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:48,107
You're welcome.

813
01:02:52,556 --> 01:02:55,866
Signor Dandolo and Signora.

814
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:57,105
You're welcome.

815
01:03:04,996 --> 01:03:07,032
- Signor Papprizzio.
- Mother Bruni.

816
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,346
We must introduce you
to everyone we know.

817
01:03:09,436 --> 01:03:10,915
Yes, this should be interesting.

818
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:13,191
- Will you do me the honor, signora?
- May l?

819
01:03:13,276 --> 01:03:15,426
- Well, I'm free.
- l...

820
01:03:15,516 --> 01:03:18,349
- Be my guest.
- Watch this.

821
01:03:23,516 --> 01:03:26,269
Signor Casanova,
I have a message from your fiancée.

822
01:03:26,356 --> 01:03:29,154
- Ah, which one?
- Signorina Donato.

823
01:03:29,236 --> 01:03:32,672
She's in the piazza.
She's waiting for you to escort her in.

824
01:03:32,756 --> 01:03:34,712
Good Lord!

825
01:03:51,636 --> 01:03:53,547
Come.

826
01:04:03,596 --> 01:04:08,351
Don't worry.
You're not my first virgin.

827
01:04:10,236 --> 01:04:12,591
- Victoria.
- Casanova.

828
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:21,868
Something is not right.

829
01:04:21,956 --> 01:04:26,029
Do we have the address
of Casanova's house?

830
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:29,472
Then I think now is the time
for positive action.

831
01:04:29,556 --> 01:04:31,945
Lord and Lady Devonshire.

832
01:04:33,156 --> 01:04:34,475
You're welcome.

833
01:04:34,556 --> 01:04:36,945
Signor Casanova
and Signorina Donato.

834
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,827
Signor Casanova.

835
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:45,865
Enchanting.
I'm so very pleased for you and me.

836
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:49,346
- When's the wedding?
- Soon, Your Grace.

837
01:04:49,436 --> 01:04:51,791
You're welcome.

838
01:04:52,796 --> 01:04:55,310
Ambassador Gritti and Signora.

839
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:08,271
- My darling.
- Giacomo, where can we go?

840
01:05:08,356 --> 01:05:11,109
- Find somewhere.
- Find somewhere? No, no.

841
01:05:11,196 --> 01:05:15,633
- I can't wait any longer.
- Sit down. Very good.

842
01:05:15,716 --> 01:05:18,708
Wait here and I'll come back
with a glass of wine.

843
01:05:18,796 --> 01:05:22,152
- Casanova.
- How wonderful to see you.

844
01:05:43,036 --> 01:05:45,345
What are you doing down there? No.

845
01:05:54,516 --> 01:05:56,234
There he is.

846
01:05:57,836 --> 01:06:02,034
- We danced off our feet.
- You danced off your feet. How lovely.

847
01:06:07,716 --> 01:06:09,672
That's better.

848
01:06:09,756 --> 01:06:11,747
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

849
01:06:11,836 --> 01:06:14,191
- Signore.
- Yea-ah!

850
01:06:14,276 --> 01:06:16,471
It's Signor Donato from across the canal.

851
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:19,275
It's Signor Donato from across the canal.

852
01:06:19,996 --> 01:06:21,315
I just said that.

853
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:24,389
- May l?
- Please.

854
01:06:24,476 --> 01:06:25,465
Thank you.

855
01:06:27,676 --> 01:06:31,635
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just hot.

856
01:06:31,716 --> 01:06:34,230
- I didn't see you in church.
- Well, I was there.

857
01:06:34,316 --> 01:06:36,625
I know, but I wasn't.

858
01:06:40,156 --> 01:06:43,068
- Do you know Signor...
- Yes. I'm the future son-in-law.

859
01:06:43,156 --> 01:06:45,386
- That's right.
- Yes!

860
01:06:46,316 --> 01:06:48,705
- Congratulations are in order.
- Yes.

861
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,629
Thank you.

862
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:53,434
No. No, I mean...

863
01:06:53,516 --> 01:06:56,349
No. Yes. Congratulations are in order.

864
01:06:56,436 --> 01:06:57,915
I just said that.

865
01:07:02,156 --> 01:07:05,307
Congratulations.
You must be pleased for Victoria.

866
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:08,035
That reminds me.
Have you seen Victoria?

867
01:07:10,876 --> 01:07:12,389
No, no. That's true.

868
01:07:12,476 --> 01:07:15,354
I thought she'd be here
with her... her fiance.

869
01:07:15,436 --> 01:07:18,508
That's true. I haven't seen her anywhere.
I think she's...

870
01:07:18,596 --> 01:07:21,349
I had forbidden her to come,
but she has defied me.

871
01:07:21,436 --> 01:07:23,950
- She must have changed.
- She has.

872
01:07:24,036 --> 01:07:27,073
I suppose getting engaged
to the famous Casanova

873
01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:29,067
has gone to her head.

874
01:07:29,156 --> 01:07:32,751
- What is the matter with this table?
- It's a good table. It's fine.

875
01:07:32,836 --> 01:07:36,624
I'm a traditionalist.
No intercourse before the wedding.

876
01:07:36,716 --> 01:07:39,514
- Social intercourse.
- There's somebody under the table.

877
01:07:39,596 --> 01:07:42,713
- Which table?
- This table!

878
01:07:50,076 --> 01:07:52,146
Is this the palazzo of Signor Casanova?

879
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:55,592
Yes, sir. He's right in here,
Your Excellency.

880
01:08:03,156 --> 01:08:08,674
So, Signor Casanova,
not out of town after all, I see.

881
01:08:10,156 --> 01:08:12,829
I find it difficult to believe
this is what women want.

882
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:16,989
Yeah. Here, little piggy.
Come, little piggy.

883
01:08:18,996 --> 01:08:20,509
- Andolini...
- Sir, I think...

884
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,429
Don't think. Just do what you do.

885
01:08:24,676 --> 01:08:28,669
Stop the treatment!
I don't like this part of the treatment!

886
01:08:31,436 --> 01:08:36,112
- So, what progress?
- He seems confused.

887
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:39,984
Fornication on a massive scale
leads to confusion.

888
01:08:42,556 --> 01:08:46,868
- Signor Casanova.
- I'm Papprizzio of Genoa.

889
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,426
Unfortunately for you, I am intimately
acquainted with Signor Papprizzio.

890
01:08:50,516 --> 01:08:53,713
- I've had tea with him.
- Ask Fulvio.

891
01:08:55,116 --> 01:08:57,789
Fulvio, tell him. Tell him, Fulvio.

892
01:09:06,796 --> 01:09:09,105
Sir.

893
01:09:21,316 --> 01:09:23,432
So who is...?

894
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:31,112
- So you are Papprizzio.
- It's what I've been saying, stupid.

895
01:09:31,196 --> 01:09:35,474
Well, Signor Papprizzio,
maybe you'll tell me the whereabouts

896
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:37,865
of the owner of the palazzo
where you're staying.

897
01:09:37,956 --> 01:09:39,309
- Signor...
- Guardi.

898
01:09:39,396 --> 01:09:41,990
Signor Bernardo Guardi is my host here.

899
01:09:42,076 --> 01:09:45,273
I'm staying at his place, taking his course.
He designed my treatment.

900
01:09:45,356 --> 01:09:47,586
Do you realise Guardi is a heretic?

901
01:09:47,676 --> 01:09:50,713
Your Reverence,
Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume.

902
01:09:53,236 --> 01:09:55,033
Then if

903
01:09:55,116 --> 01:09:58,791
Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume

904
01:09:58,876 --> 01:10:02,710
perhaps the plume's nom is

905
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:05,071
Casanova.

906
01:10:05,676 --> 01:10:09,430
- Casanova?
- It was staring us in the face all along.

907
01:10:09,516 --> 01:10:13,907
The glorification of women, et cetera.
Boring, boring, boring.

908
01:10:13,996 --> 01:10:17,750
- Casanova is Bernardo Guardi.
- Bravo, Your Reverence.

909
01:10:17,836 --> 01:10:21,033
Good Lord.
He's taken my fiancée to the ball.

910
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:24,108
Not for long, he's not.
Get your men together and come with me.

911
01:10:24,196 --> 01:10:27,393
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the ball.

912
01:10:27,476 --> 01:10:29,228
Well, so are we!

913
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:45,469
- You're right. She's here.
- Where?

914
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:49,105
Right over there. See?
You should take her home.

915
01:10:49,196 --> 01:10:54,589
- You see, I'm a traditionalist myself.
- Signor Valmarana and Signora.

916
01:10:54,676 --> 01:10:56,109
At least someone's madean effort.

917
01:10:56,196 --> 01:11:00,712
Excuse me.
I say, at least somebody's made an effort.

918
01:11:00,796 --> 01:11:03,754
Now that is purple.

919
01:11:03,836 --> 01:11:07,351
That's not Venetian, is it?
Am I wrong? That is a...

920
01:11:07,436 --> 01:11:11,429
London? Paris? Rome?
Is it...

921
01:11:11,516 --> 01:11:14,394
It's almost a papal purple.

922
01:11:15,676 --> 01:11:17,712
It reminds me of something.
Don't tell me.

923
01:11:17,796 --> 01:11:21,994
- Inquisitor Pucci.
- Inquisitor Pucci.

924
01:11:22,076 --> 01:11:25,352
Yes, I know.
I heard you were in Venice.

925
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:30,550
- Come for a dance?
- I'm here to arrest Giacomo Casanova.

926
01:11:30,636 --> 01:11:34,709
Casanova is about to marry
a young woman famous for her modesty.

927
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:38,471
His slate is wiped clean,
and he's under my protection.

928
01:11:38,556 --> 01:11:41,673
Does your protection extend to heretics?

929
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:45,066
Beware, Doge.
Your city's freedom

930
01:11:45,156 --> 01:11:48,785
dangles from the belt of the Vatican.

931
01:11:52,836 --> 01:11:54,747
You're welcome.

932
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:20,432
- Admiral Massimo Canal and Signora.
- You're welcome.

933
01:12:20,516 --> 01:12:21,995
Where's Francesca?

934
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:25,751
My name is Pietro Papprizzio
and I'm from Genoa.

935
01:12:26,356 --> 01:12:28,267
What?

936
01:12:31,196 --> 01:12:34,074
Signor Papprizzio of Genoa.

937
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:14,826
So you're Papprizzio?

938
01:13:17,276 --> 01:13:19,995
From Genoa?

939
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:24,275
Is your name...

940
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:26,028
Bruni.

941
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:30,306
I'm your...

942
01:13:30,396 --> 01:13:31,511
I'm your future...

943
01:13:31,596 --> 01:13:34,394
I never dreamt you'd be so beautiful.

944
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,228
Me?

945
01:13:40,636 --> 01:13:42,945
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

946
01:13:43,036 --> 01:13:44,071
Why...

947
01:13:44,156 --> 01:13:48,035
No. No, I'm your future mother-in-law.

948
01:13:48,116 --> 01:13:50,630
- My mother-in-law?
- Yes.

949
01:13:50,716 --> 01:13:54,550
- I'm not betrothed to you?
- No, to my daughter.

950
01:13:56,476 --> 01:13:59,229
Some people find her beautiful.

951
01:13:59,316 --> 01:14:03,594
- There's a man who's after her.
- Really? Does she like him?

952
01:14:03,676 --> 01:14:07,146
Signora Bruni, your daughter has been
duped by none other than Casanova.

953
01:14:07,236 --> 01:14:09,147
But worry not. He's as good as...

954
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:18,268
Why don't you stop interfering, all right?

955
01:14:19,676 --> 01:14:21,587
Thank you.

956
01:14:23,356 --> 01:14:24,709
Well.

957
01:14:38,556 --> 01:14:40,990
Signorina.

958
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,510
I was afraid I'd lost you.

959
01:14:43,596 --> 01:14:46,156
As one might lose a pocket watch,
Signor Papprizzio,

960
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:49,228
or some other valuable possession?

961
01:14:49,316 --> 01:14:51,989
I know that no man will ever own you.

962
01:14:52,076 --> 01:14:55,273
But to be your defender
on the road you travel,

963
01:14:55,356 --> 01:15:01,113
to show you the world as you've
never seen it, for that I hold my hopes.

964
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:04,871
Let's start by taking
one step closer to heaven.

965
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:43,146
You get this one here.

966
01:15:43,236 --> 01:15:45,113
Ready. On the count of three.

967
01:15:45,196 --> 01:15:47,232
One, two, three.

968
01:16:09,116 --> 01:16:10,435
Witchcraft.

969
01:16:14,076 --> 01:16:19,104
Actually, I believe it's because hot air rises,
overcoming the gravitational force of...

970
01:16:19,196 --> 01:16:21,391
Witchcraft.

971
01:16:30,876 --> 01:16:32,787
Here we are.

972
01:16:35,636 --> 01:16:38,753
Look! It's Casanova with his new fiancée.

973
01:16:46,876 --> 01:16:49,834
Casanova.

974
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:51,668
Come on.

975
01:16:51,756 --> 01:16:54,668
Is that Francesca?

976
01:16:54,756 --> 01:16:57,634
- It is her.
- That's Francesca.

977
01:16:57,716 --> 01:17:01,265
- I've never seen her look so happy.
- Really?

978
01:17:02,676 --> 01:17:06,635
Such bad news for you, Signor Papprizzio.

979
01:17:10,156 --> 01:17:13,910
O calamity.
She's thrown me over.

980
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:18,035
- Disgraceful.
- Oh, well. A scandal.

981
01:17:20,876 --> 01:17:24,505
- You're a free man.
- Oh, dear.

982
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:28,466
What will I do?

983
01:17:46,676 --> 01:17:49,907
Thank you, Signor Papprizzio.

984
01:17:51,396 --> 01:17:55,071
I'm beginning to believe
that your heart is true.

985
01:17:55,836 --> 01:17:59,749
There is more of the lover
than the merchant in you.

986
01:17:59,836 --> 01:18:02,873
Why didn't you tell me
you were my betrothed?

987
01:18:02,956 --> 01:18:05,265
You didn't trust me?

988
01:18:06,316 --> 01:18:10,514
Well, why didn't you tell me
you were Bernardo Guardi?

989
01:18:15,076 --> 01:18:18,034
It's all right.
I won't tell anyone.

990
01:18:19,956 --> 01:18:26,191
I should've guessed the first time I saw you
in that citadel of male complacency

991
01:18:26,276 --> 01:18:30,792
when you were as brave in debate
as you were later in duel.

992
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:38,073
You were Bernardo Guardi
in beauty's mask.

993
01:18:41,156 --> 01:18:43,590
I'm in love with you, Francesca.

994
01:18:49,796 --> 01:18:51,354
You were at the debate?

995
01:18:53,676 --> 01:18:55,553
Yes. Yes, I was.

996
01:18:55,636 --> 01:18:57,786
At the university.

997
01:19:00,116 --> 01:19:02,710
Francesca...

998
01:19:04,596 --> 01:19:09,431
Just as you had honest reason
for not telling me who you were,

999
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:15,626
I, too, have honest reason...

1000
01:19:16,796 --> 01:19:18,115
What?

1001
01:19:29,116 --> 01:19:30,310
I can explain this.

1002
01:19:31,436 --> 01:19:33,506
Are you Papprizzio?

1003
01:19:35,116 --> 01:19:39,189
Tell me you're Papprizzio, my betrothed.

1004
01:19:41,876 --> 01:19:43,787
Who are you?

1005
01:19:49,316 --> 01:19:51,227
I'm Casanova.

1006
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,907
What?

1007
01:19:53,996 --> 01:19:57,784
I'm... I'm Giacomo Casanova.

1008
01:20:00,956 --> 01:20:03,834
You stand for everything I write against.

1009
01:20:05,996 --> 01:20:09,671
- Wasn't that before you knew me?
- I don't know you.

1010
01:20:10,236 --> 01:20:12,352
Which one of you?

1011
01:20:22,956 --> 01:20:27,746
I think I liked you better in your masks.
At least Salvato was a gentleman.

1012
01:20:27,836 --> 01:20:31,749
Papprizzio was promising.
But Casanova, I despise.

1013
01:20:31,836 --> 01:20:33,588
You dare to say you love me.

1014
01:20:33,676 --> 01:20:39,034
I would save myself for the kind of love
which a man would give his life for.

1015
01:20:49,756 --> 01:20:51,269
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

1016
01:20:51,356 --> 01:20:53,711
Casanova.

1017
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:56,547
Signor Casanova.

1018
01:20:56,636 --> 01:21:00,345
I'm here to arrest you
as a fornicator, a charlatan,

1019
01:21:00,436 --> 01:21:05,271
and, above all, a coward
who hides behind the name of another -

1020
01:21:05,356 --> 01:21:08,029
Signor Bernardo Guardi.

1021
01:21:11,556 --> 01:21:15,185
And as Bernardo Guardi,
I arrest you as a heretic.

1022
01:21:15,276 --> 01:21:19,064
- What? He's not...
- Yes, signorina, he is.

1023
01:21:19,156 --> 01:21:22,387
- He's not...
- Francesca, don't.

1024
01:21:23,836 --> 01:21:26,396
No.

1025
01:21:29,436 --> 01:21:31,586
I'm Bernardo Guardi.

1026
01:22:01,236 --> 01:22:03,511
Bishop Pucci.

1027
01:22:03,596 --> 01:22:06,349
How can I help you, my dear?

1028
01:22:32,676 --> 01:22:34,268
I was a virgin.

1029
01:22:34,356 --> 01:22:38,747
My virginity was
my most cherished possession -

1030
01:22:38,836 --> 01:22:40,952
my gift from God.

1031
01:22:41,876 --> 01:22:44,390
My gift was taken from me.

1032
01:22:44,476 --> 01:22:48,549
Tragic and most damnable.
What was the name of this vile seducer?

1033
01:22:49,356 --> 01:22:50,789
Giacomo Casanova.

1034
01:22:53,116 --> 01:22:57,712
When Casanova came to my room
and robbed me

1035
01:22:59,316 --> 01:23:01,784
I fought for my honor.

1036
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:06,154
Are you saying you'd be willing to give me
the testimony that I need to hang him?

1037
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:07,828
Yes.

1038
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:10,953
But I would worry about my reputation.

1039
01:23:11,036 --> 01:23:15,712
Of course. But I think we could say
if everything went according to plan,

1040
01:23:15,796 --> 01:23:20,153
we could return your reputation
and your virginity to you.

1041
01:23:21,116 --> 01:23:23,346
- You could do that?
- Oh, yes.

1042
01:23:23,436 --> 01:23:26,348
We are the Catholic Church.
We can do anything.

1043
01:23:37,796 --> 01:23:41,630
Excuse me.
When is my turn?

1044
01:23:45,436 --> 01:23:47,392
Give me a man who is man enough

1045
01:23:47,476 --> 01:23:51,105
to give himself
just to the woman who is worth him.

1046
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:54,589
And if that woman were me,

1047
01:23:54,676 --> 01:23:58,794
I would love him alone and forever.

1048
01:24:47,396 --> 01:24:49,432
Thank you very much.

1049
01:24:49,516 --> 01:24:52,713
- Are you sure I don't owe you anything?
- On the contrary.

1050
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:54,309
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1051
01:24:54,396 --> 01:24:57,991
- Bye.
- Come back.

1052
01:24:58,076 --> 01:25:00,954
You're... You're the boy in the window.

1053
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,149
Signorina Donato.

1054
01:25:03,236 --> 01:25:05,386
We won't forget you.

1055
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:08,786
You'll be a legend among the girls.

1056
01:25:10,556 --> 01:25:13,832
- This is terrible.
- Why?

1057
01:25:16,316 --> 01:25:18,511
I've loved you hopelessly for years.

1058
01:25:20,596 --> 01:25:23,429
Why didn't you say?

1059
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:43,036
My Lord, the prisoner is being represented
by a Dr Giordano of Padua.

1060
01:25:44,756 --> 01:25:47,987
Then I call the defense, Dr Giordano.

1061
01:25:48,956 --> 01:25:51,595
It is a case of mistaken identity,
Your Grace.

1062
01:25:51,676 --> 01:25:53,428
- What? Mistaken...
- Yes.

1063
01:25:53,516 --> 01:25:57,748
This man is not Bernardo Guardi.

1064
01:25:57,836 --> 01:25:59,508
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, I am.

1065
01:25:59,596 --> 01:26:02,269
- You see?
- He is protecting someone.

1066
01:26:02,356 --> 01:26:03,835
- No.
- Yes, you are.

1067
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:07,033
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are... not.

1068
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:09,234
Protecting who?

1069
01:26:11,596 --> 01:26:13,314
The woman who loves him.

1070
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:22,152
If you are who you say, perhaps you could
indulge the court with a few samples

1071
01:26:22,236 --> 01:26:24,909
of your more renowned
philosophies on women.

1072
01:26:28,156 --> 01:26:31,307
If I've said I am Bernardo Guardi,
does that not suffice?

1073
01:26:31,396 --> 01:26:35,867
My Lord, must we listen to this
stuttering heretic? He has self-confessed.

1074
01:26:35,956 --> 01:26:39,266
Is that all that you require?
A confession?

1075
01:26:39,356 --> 01:26:41,995
Well, yes. I suppose so.

1076
01:26:42,836 --> 01:26:45,555
Good.

1077
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:52,795
Because I am the one with
the manuscripts, written in my own hand.

1078
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:55,185
I am the only one with proof that l...

1079
01:26:55,996 --> 01:26:58,954
I am Bernardo Guardi.

1080
01:26:59,596 --> 01:27:01,314
You?

1081
01:27:01,396 --> 01:27:04,274
- Francesca.
- Do you really think I'd let you die for me?

1082
01:27:04,356 --> 01:27:07,154
Well, then, release the prisoner Casanova.

1083
01:27:07,236 --> 01:27:12,549
My Lord, my Lord,
let us not forget this is a court of law.

1084
01:27:12,636 --> 01:27:15,514
We still have a self-confessed heretic.

1085
01:27:15,596 --> 01:27:19,748
And we also have
a notorious seducer,

1086
01:27:19,836 --> 01:27:23,192
an adulterer, a violator of virgins

1087
01:27:23,276 --> 01:27:26,313
whose guilt I will prove
by the testimony of...

1088
01:27:26,396 --> 01:27:27,988
No!

1089
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,987
It wasn't true.

1090
01:27:32,516 --> 01:27:33,744
Of...

1091
01:27:33,836 --> 01:27:39,069
By the testimony of no less
than 1 27 sworn statements,

1092
01:27:39,156 --> 01:27:43,274
attesting to the libidinous lust
of Giacomo Casanova.

1093
01:27:44,276 --> 01:27:47,985
There is only one verdict
open to this court: guilty.

1094
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:52,105
And one sentence: death.

1095
01:27:52,596 --> 01:27:56,305
- Death to the heretic Bernardo Guardi.
- No!

1096
01:27:56,396 --> 01:28:00,105
And death to the master fornicator

1097
01:28:00,196 --> 01:28:02,710
Giacomo Casanova.

1098
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:59,790
- You did say the cardinal's coming.
- I did, sir.

1099
01:29:22,876 --> 01:29:26,505
Your Reverence,
I don't think we can wait any longer.

1100
01:29:26,596 --> 01:29:28,507
Very well.

1101
01:29:29,516 --> 01:29:31,313
I shall have to do it without him.

1102
01:29:51,996 --> 01:29:55,033
Cardinal Lopresta has arrived!

1103
01:30:13,756 --> 01:30:16,395
Sorry we're late.
Canals, et cetera.

1104
01:30:16,476 --> 01:30:19,354
Your Eminence.
Bishop Pucci.

1105
01:30:19,436 --> 01:30:21,347
An honor to meet you at last.

1106
01:30:21,436 --> 01:30:24,633
- I've heard so much about you.
- Thank you.

1107
01:30:24,716 --> 01:30:26,946
What's happening here?

1108
01:30:27,036 --> 01:30:32,349
Just hanging a heretic and Casanova.

1109
01:30:32,436 --> 01:30:33,585
What luck.

1110
01:30:35,316 --> 01:30:37,784
My nurse.

1111
01:30:38,796 --> 01:30:42,152
And does your nurse enjoy executions?

1112
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:44,750
Does the pope have a balcony?

1113
01:30:44,836 --> 01:30:47,304
What I actually came to say is this.

1114
01:30:51,036 --> 01:30:51,991
Venetians!

1115
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:56,394
Greetings from His Holiness.

1116
01:30:56,476 --> 01:31:00,549
As you know,
today is the pope's birthday.

1117
01:31:01,316 --> 01:31:02,795
- And...
- Did you know that?

1118
01:31:02,876 --> 01:31:08,348
And in honor of his birthday,
His Holiness has decreed

1119
01:31:08,436 --> 01:31:13,510
a papal pardon for all those
who would be executed

1120
01:31:13,596 --> 01:31:17,032
on this happy day.

1121
01:31:17,116 --> 01:31:19,311
- Your Eminence.
- Free the prisoners.

1122
01:31:21,156 --> 01:31:23,306
Free the prisoners!

1123
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:30,869
Your Eminence.
No. No. No.

1124
01:31:31,316 --> 01:31:34,547
You don't seem to share
the pope's happiness on his birthday.

1125
01:31:34,636 --> 01:31:36,228
No, I do. I do.

1126
01:31:38,556 --> 01:31:40,672
How old is he?

1127
01:31:40,756 --> 01:31:42,872
I'm not quite sure.

1128
01:31:47,316 --> 01:31:51,275
- No, no...
- Best stay here. Crowd's turning ugly.

1129
01:31:55,436 --> 01:32:00,191
Please join me in my coach.
We're leaving for my country house.

1130
01:32:19,276 --> 01:32:22,313
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1131
01:32:24,796 --> 01:32:27,674
My fault. I'm to blame.

1132
01:32:28,516 --> 01:32:29,790
Tito.

1133
01:32:29,876 --> 01:32:31,832
The love of my life.

1134
01:32:33,116 --> 01:32:36,950
This is my son.

1135
01:32:37,836 --> 01:32:41,033
I've played cardinals before, of course.
You may have seen me.

1136
01:32:41,116 --> 01:32:46,065
Anyway, we left our troupe in Trieste when
we heard the news. Had to move fast.

1137
01:32:48,516 --> 01:32:50,472
Mom, the paint is wet.

1138
01:32:54,036 --> 01:32:55,833
It says "Theatre Troupe" here.

1139
01:32:58,516 --> 01:33:01,314
Cardinal Lopresta has arrived!

1140
01:33:01,396 --> 01:33:02,954
Arrest those impostors!

1141
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:10,505
Move! Get out of the way!

1142
01:33:11,636 --> 01:33:12,910
Giacomo!

1143
01:33:15,316 --> 01:33:18,672
- Come on!
- Come on! Out of the way, people!

1144
01:33:18,756 --> 01:33:20,508
Casanova!

1145
01:33:37,236 --> 01:33:39,875
On you get, darling.
Quick as a bunny.

1146
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:45,430
I didn't know it was the pope's birthday.

1147
01:34:25,716 --> 01:34:28,150
So how goes things?

1148
01:34:29,836 --> 01:34:32,430
It's very exciting, isn't it?

1149
01:34:34,796 --> 01:34:37,230
This is the last time I'm traveling coach.

1150
01:34:37,316 --> 01:34:39,227
Hold on, everyone!

1151
01:34:45,876 --> 01:34:46,911
Hang on!

1152
01:34:51,876 --> 01:34:55,152
- Easy, boy!
- Tito!

1153
01:35:02,276 --> 01:35:04,915
Everybody off.

1154
01:35:06,356 --> 01:35:09,666
Hello, darling.
I'm your future stepfather.

1155
01:35:09,756 --> 01:35:13,829
- I was always faithful to you.
- I never had any doubt. None at all.

1156
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:18,273
Come on, darling.
Let's escape on my barge. It's by the water.

1157
01:35:20,316 --> 01:35:21,954
That way.

1158
01:35:22,036 --> 01:35:24,106
Charge!

1159
01:35:33,036 --> 01:35:35,231
Oh, dear.

1160
01:35:36,876 --> 01:35:38,389
Giovanni!

1161
01:36:11,276 --> 01:36:14,234
Step lightly, darling.
Excuse us. Excuse us.

1162
01:36:14,316 --> 01:36:16,466
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Excuse us.

1163
01:36:16,556 --> 01:36:19,946
This way, darling.
This way.

1164
01:36:20,036 --> 01:36:24,871
I can't wait for you to see the boat. Here's
the boat. Right this way. On your new boat.

1165
01:36:24,956 --> 01:36:27,231
- Vittorio. Vittorio.
- Careful. Careful.

1166
01:36:27,316 --> 01:36:29,034
- I'm behind you.
- This way.

1167
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:33,348
No, my baby. Listen.
You're staying behind with me.

1168
01:36:35,236 --> 01:36:37,704
Prepare to sail, men.

1169
01:36:41,156 --> 01:36:42,555
Oh, dear.

1170
01:36:44,956 --> 01:36:46,708
Vittorio, do something useful.

1171
01:36:46,796 --> 01:36:49,993
- Signora, what can I do?
- Something useful.

1172
01:36:50,636 --> 01:36:52,592
Giovanni!

1173
01:36:52,676 --> 01:36:54,507
Come on! Come on!

1174
01:36:54,596 --> 01:36:56,791
Quickly! Quickly!

1175
01:36:59,396 --> 01:37:03,514
I can't come with you.
If I do, they'll follow us both.

1176
01:37:04,156 --> 01:37:05,066
What?

1177
01:37:05,156 --> 01:37:07,795
- You mean they'll follow Casanova?
- That's right.

1178
01:37:09,036 --> 01:37:11,345
What if he never left?

1179
01:37:13,996 --> 01:37:15,827
I could do it.

1180
01:37:18,316 --> 01:37:20,511
There's more to this than just the name.

1181
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:24,472
I wouldn't mind being Casanova.

1182
01:37:25,236 --> 01:37:30,629
- I wouldn't mind being on that boat.
- And I wouldn't mind my wedding.

1183
01:37:34,316 --> 01:37:36,671
Well, come on.

1184
01:37:37,556 --> 01:37:39,751
- Come on.
- Lupo, where you going?

1185
01:37:39,836 --> 01:37:41,428
I'm staying.

1186
01:37:41,996 --> 01:37:44,351
- Why?
- I'm a Venetian, sir.

1187
01:37:44,436 --> 01:37:47,234
My place is with Casanova.

1188
01:37:50,436 --> 01:37:52,996
Take care of me, my good friend.

1189
01:37:53,756 --> 01:37:55,189
Of course, Master.

1190
01:38:23,436 --> 01:38:24,755
After them!

1191
01:38:27,196 --> 01:38:28,834
Better luck next time!

1192
01:38:38,196 --> 01:38:42,587
- Andolini, get the boats after them!
- Farewell, simpletons!

1193
01:38:46,636 --> 01:38:48,627
Get after them!

1194
01:38:48,716 --> 01:38:50,627
Go on!

1195
01:39:05,156 --> 01:39:07,511
I told you I'd come back.

1196
01:39:20,876 --> 01:39:24,425
It's a wonderful life, an actor's life.

1197
01:39:24,516 --> 01:39:26,791
You'll love it.

1198
01:39:27,756 --> 01:39:30,873
Who writes your plays?

1199
01:39:37,836 --> 01:39:39,952
Come inside.

1200
01:39:45,876 --> 01:39:47,355
Lovely.

1201
01:39:47,436 --> 01:39:50,348
Just my kind of good weather.

1202
01:40:23,316 --> 01:40:28,026
Which is why the story
of Casanova and Francesca

1203
01:40:30,476 --> 01:40:32,626
isn't mine to tell.

1204
01:40:36,236 --> 01:40:41,833
Victoria and I lived happily ever after.

1205
01:40:45,276 --> 01:40:47,744
Just not together.

1206
01:40:50,516 --> 01:40:52,427
Venice.

1207
01:40:53,516 --> 01:40:57,350
So soon enough, in people's minds,

1208
01:40:57,436 --> 01:41:00,155
Casanova was back.

1209
01:41:01,676 --> 01:41:03,268
If I may say so,

1210
01:41:03,356 --> 01:41:06,746
I believe I rose worthily to the occasion

1211
01:41:08,076 --> 01:41:12,866
and added many glorious chapters
to the legend,

1212
01:41:14,036 --> 01:41:18,109
while I kept the secret

1213
01:41:18,196 --> 01:41:20,426
of the true love

1214
01:41:20,516 --> 01:41:23,872
of the man who was

1215
01:41:23,956 --> 01:41:25,947
Casanova.
