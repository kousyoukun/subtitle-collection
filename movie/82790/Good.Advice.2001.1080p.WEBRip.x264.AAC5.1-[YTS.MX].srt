00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,714
( woman moans )

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:17,418
Woman:
OH MY GOD, DON'T DO THAT.

5
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:20,654
Man:
DON'T DO-- THIS?

6
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:25,493
YES!
DON'T DO THAT SOME MORE.

7
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,262
TELL ME.

8
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:30,198
OR I WON'T DO THIS.

9
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:32,133
OKAY.

10
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,635
ALL I KNOW IS HE'S IN D.C.
BUYING SOME COMPANY.

11
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,371
DON'T STOP!

12
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,540
NO. I'M STOPPING.

13
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:40,874
WHICH COMPANY?

14
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:44,712
RYAN, IF I WANTED
TO TALK BUSINESS,
I'D HAVE SEX WITH MY HUSBAND.

15
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,649
WHICH COMPANY?

16
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,851
( phone rings,
machine picks up )

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,154
Hi, Donald and Veronica
can't come--

18
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,389
- ( machine beeps )
- Man: Veronica? It's me.

19
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,325
- MY GOD, IT'S DONALD!
- PICK IT UP.

20
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,360
Call me when
you get back.

21
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,761
- HI, SWEETIE.
- Hey, baby.

22
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,464
I was about to hang up.
Whatcha doing?

23
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,100
UH...
HAVING MY NAILS DONE.

24
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:09,103
I wanted to tell you
my plane's landing in an hour.

25
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:12,773
- I'm gonna play a quick 18,
then we'll go to dinner.
- OKAY.

26
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,743
LISTEN, SWEETIE,
I GOTTA RUN.

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,611
MY MANICURIST IS
GIVING ME DIRTY LOOKS.

28
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,214
- I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.
- All right, talk to you then.

29
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,217
I GOTTA RUN, TOO.

30
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,719
WHY?! WE HAVE ALL AFTERNOON.
DONALD'S PLAYING GOLF.

31
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,122
I KNOW.
I'M PLAYING WITH HIM.

32
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:29,123
WHAT?!

33
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,864
LET'S HEAD
FOR LONG ISLAND.

34
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,210
BEAUTIFUL SHOT!

35
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,380
200 YARDS.
RIGHT AT THE FLAG.

36
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:53,614
IF YOU WANT ME AS A CLIENT,

37
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,684
KEEP YOUR COMPLIMENTS COMING,
AND YOUR BALLS IN THE ROUGH.

38
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,120
I'LL DO MY WORST, SIR.

39
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,495
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO SWING LIKE THAT?

40
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,263
BUSINESS SCHOOL.

41
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,836
HOW'D THINGS GO
IN D.C.?

42
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,405
AFTER OUR LITTLE MEETING,

43
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,873
AND THE HALF A MILLION
ADDITIONAL SHARES I PURCHASED,

44
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,609
WE HAVE FULL COOPERATION

45
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,277
FROM THE JASCO
PHARMACEUTICALS BOARD.

46
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,913
SIR, THAT MUCH STOCK'LL
PUT YOU OVER THE LIMIT.

47
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,382
NOT IF YOU DON'T BUY IT
IN YOUR OWN NAME.

48
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,685
SOUNDS LIKE
SIMPSON PUBLISHING'S
INVOLVED IN A MERGER.

49
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,359
WATCH CNBC
TOMORROW MORNING.

50
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:47,235
CINDY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GET DRINKS TONIGHT?

51
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,937
NEVER.

52
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,905
GREAT,
RAINCHECK IT IS, THEN.

53
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,975
Intercom:
Ryan Turner's on line one.

54
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,311
Hey, gorgeous.

55
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,647
HEY, HONEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,216
YOU-- IN ABOUT EIGHT HOURS.

57
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,219
OH, RYAN,

58
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,988
YOU ARE SO ROMANTIC.

59
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,990
- I know.
- ARE WE STILL ON FOR DINNER?

60
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,293
Yes, we are.
I'll meet you there at 8:00.

61
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,628
AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT
I HAVE PLANNED FOR DESSERT.

62
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,598
OOOH, I'LL BRING
THE CHERRY.

63
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,233
- I wish.
- BYE.

64
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,471
I UNDERSTAND
THE POSSIBILITY

65
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,006
OF BREAKING A NAIL
IS LOOMING OVER
EVERY WORD,

66
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,641
BUT YOUR DEADLINE
IS--

67
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:28,909
NOW.

68
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,678
OKAY! JEEZ!

69
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,946
WHY DOES EVERYBODY
WANT SOMETHING FROM ME?

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,948
YOU WRITE AN ADVICE COLUMN?

71
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,618
I HAVE PROBLEMS TOO,
YOU KNOW.

72
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:38,919
YES, I KNOW.

73
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,954
I MEAN, LISTEN
TO THIS LETTER,

74
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,892
"DEAR CINDY, I WANT
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

75
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,961
BUT MY HUSBAND IS AGAINST IT.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?"

76
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,298
I MEAN, THIS WOMAN
IS SUCH A MESS.

77
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,932
SO WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

78
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:52,900
SIMPLE.

79
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:58,772
"WHY DO YOU NEED SCHOOL?
YOU HAVE A HUSBAND.

80
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,842
IF YOU WANT TO FEEL
BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF,
DO CHARITY WORK.

81
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,877
GO BUILD HAIRDO'S
FOR THE HOMELESS,

82
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,013
BETTER YET,
GO GET YOUR OWN HAIR DONE."

83
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,881
THIS WOMAN POURS
HER HEART OUT TO YOU,

84
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,683
AND YOU GIVE HER BEAUTY TIPS?

85
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:10,984
WHAT'S WRONG HERE?

86
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,554
I HAVEN'T GIVEN YOU ANY.

87
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,557
CINDY, THIS IS
A QUALITY NEWSPAPER.

88
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,961
PAGE, WE'RE NOT FRIENDS,
SO I CAN BE HONEST WITH YOU.

89
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,531
MY GRANDMOTHER'S LEGS
HAD BETTER CIRCULATION

90
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,900
THAN THIS
"QUALITY" NEWSPAPER.
NO ONE EVEN BUYS IT.

91
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,603
THEN I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO BUY OUT YOUR CONTRACT.

92
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,705
I WISH!

93
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,941
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
YOU'RE FLAT--

94
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,609
BROKE.

95
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,978
SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO LET ME DO WHAT I DO.

96
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,748
WITH THE STYLE, GRACE,
AND FEMININITY

97
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,516
I DO IT WITH.

98
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,523
( humming )

99
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:52,493
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU SING, HONEY,
IT REALLY TURNS ME ON.

100
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,628
REALLY? HA HA.
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO GO SHOPPING?

101
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:55,896
WHOA!

102
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,598
WE'RE WALKING HERE!

103
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,899
HUH?

104
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,834
SHE'S JUST LIKE
MY THERAPIST.

105
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,903
TURNING EVERYTHING AROUND
MAKING IT SEEM LIKE

106
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,339
- I'M THE ONE
WITH THE PROBLEM.
- THEN QUIT.

107
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,008
- YOU SAID NOBODY READS
YOUR COLUMN ANYWAYS.
- I CAN'T JUST QUIT.

108
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:12,580
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE A HUSBAND
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

109
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:13,847
( sighs )

110
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,949
SO WHAT'S
WITH THE CHAMPAGNE?

111
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,820
I GOT INFORMATION

112
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,856
FROM DONALD SIMPSON
ABOUT A MERGER.

113
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,626
IT'LL MAKE MY CLIENTS--
AND ME-- A FORTUNE.

114
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,894
( pops )

115
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,129
Barry:
IF SIMPSON TOLD YOU,
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?

116
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,700
NO. DONALD WOULD NEVER
RISK AN S.E.C. VIOLATION.

117
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,835
I OVERHEARD HIM
AND HIS LAWYERS.

118
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,505
THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY
OF A LIFETIME.

119
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,440
I'M EVEN MARGINING
MY OWN PORTFOLIO.

120
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,808
WHAT'S MARGINING?

121
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,612
Mrs. Sherman:
IT'S BUYING ON CREDIT.
THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE YOU A CARD.

122
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,614
- YOU CHECKED THIS OUT?
- OF COURSE.

123
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,649
SIMPSON HIMSELF
BOUGHT STOCK--

124
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,518
IN HIS WIFE'S
MAIDEN NAME.

125
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,421
- WHICH STOCK?
- JASCO PHARMACEUTICALS.

126
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,556
THEY'RE DEVELOPING
SOME ANTI-AGING DRUG.

127
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,692
WHEN IT HITS THE SHELVES,
THE STOCK COULD JUMP 1000%.

128
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,694
YOU COULD STILL GET IN.

129
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,830
NNNN...

130
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,699
Mrs. Sherman:
NNN-NO! FORGET IT.

131
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,768
WE'LL HANDLE ANTI-AGING
THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.

132
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,070
SURGERY! RIGHT, HONEY?

133
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,773
YEAH. WHATEVER.

134
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,141
A TOAST!

135
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,711
COME ON.

136
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:21,415
TO KATHY'S NEW ASS;

137
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,016
BARRY'S
SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE;

138
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,487
AND RYAN,
BECOMING A RICH PARTNER,

139
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,622
SO WE CAN ENJOY THE LIFE
WE DESERVE AND MORE.

140
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,625
AND MORE.

141
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:34,161
AND MORE! AND MORE!
( laughing )

142
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,764
( both laughing )

143
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,005
I GOTTA GO.

144
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,675
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
COME BACK HERE.

145
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,777
RYAN, I LOVE YOU.

146
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,480
I KNOW. BUT I'VE
GOT TO GO TO WORK.

147
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,548
IT'S 3:00 A.M.

148
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,684
I'VE GOT TO CALL TOKYO
BEFORE THEY CLOSE.

149
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:57,685
FEEL FREE TO SLEEP IN.

150
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:58,752
SLEEP IN?

151
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,821
HOW ABOUT I MOVE IN?

152
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,590
( chuckles )

153
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,760
I'M SERIOUS.
WE'D GET TO SEE SO MUCH
MORE OF EACH OTHER.

154
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,029
I'M READY TO HAVE
A DOORMAN IN MY LIFE.

155
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,865
I LIKE THE WAY
THINGS ARE.

156
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,235
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF
I TOLD YOU I'D LEAVE YOU
IF YOU DIDN'T LET ME?

157
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,705
I'D SAY YOU WERE LYING.

158
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,772
OH REALLY?

159
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,875
SEE?

160
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,713
RYAN, YOU KNOW ME SO WELL.
WE BELONG TOGETHER.

161
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,548
WE ARE TOGETHER.

162
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,550
( sigh )

163
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:37,157
WALT?

164
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,126
GOOD MORNING,
MR. TURNER.

165
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,194
YOU'RE
A DOORMAN, WALT.

166
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,230
HOW GOOD COULD IT
POSSIBLY BE?

167
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,033
THANK YOU, SIR.

168
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,811
YO' BUD.

169
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,750
YOU GOT A DOLLAR?

170
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,652
YEAH, MILLIONS OF THEM.

171
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,655
ME, TOO.

172
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,141
( cash drawer chings )

173
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,844
( gong )

174
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,852
HI, RYAN TURNER-SAN.

175
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,654
GOOD TO HEAR
FROM YOU AGAIN.

176
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,824
ASAHI, HAKASHIRO-SAN.
I HAVE GOT A VERY LUCRATIVE
INVESTMENT

177
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,693
YOU NEED TO JUMP ON
IMMEDIATELY.

178
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,762
( bells tolling )

179
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:51,999
YOU GONNA GIVE BOWIE
THAT TIDBIT AS WELL?

180
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,068
MICHAEL, YOU KNOW YOU'RE
MY FAVORITE CLIENT.

181
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:58,639
BOWIE'S ONLY MY FAVORITE CLIENT
WHEN I'M ON THE PHONE WITH HIM.

182
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,675
HE DOES SELL
MORE RECORDS THAN ME.
DOESN'T HE, RYAN?

183
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,712
THEREFORE, I WANT TO HAVE
ONE MORE SHARE THAN HIM.
OKAY, MAN?

184
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,947
- EXCELLENT.
- THANK YOU, RYAN.

185
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:15,188
- ( stock exchange bell )
- ( office chatter )

186
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,825
JASCO WILL BE UP
AT LEAST 30 POINTS
BEFORE NOON.

187
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,893
Man:
How in the hell
could you know that?

188
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,729
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW I KNOW--

189
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,797
Secretary:
Mrs. Ellis is on line two.

190
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,666
HELLO, MARLENE.

191
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,167
Marlene:
I want Jasco--

192
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,769
GOOD CHOICE.
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

193
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,671
- DON'T THANK ME NOW.
- But I want to.

194
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,973
IF YOU'RE ON THIS
SIDE OF THE WORLD,
LET'S GET TOGETHER.

195
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,708
- It's a date.
- ALL RIGHTY.

196
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:37,077
ARE YOU IN OR OUT?

197
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,681
All right, put me down
for 10,000 shares,
market price.

198
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,617
You folks at Beacon Trade
never let me down before.

199
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,753
DONE.

200
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,922
Rumors of a merger
fueled an early morning
explosion

201
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,858
of Jasco
Pharmaceutical stock,

202
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,160
but now trading
has been halted

203
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,028
because a news conference
has been called.

204
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,698
YES... YES!

205
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,833
NO, I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT.

206
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:03,036
I'M GOING TO LOOK INTO IT.
I'M ON TOP OF THAT, OKAY?

207
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,305
THANK YOU FOR CALLING.

208
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,311
MORNING, SIR.

209
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,346
COFFEE?

210
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,015
ABOUT FIVE HOURS AGO.

211
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,685
FILE THESE BUY ORDERS,
AND GET MY PHONE SHEET,
PLEASE.

212
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,821
TED WANTS
TO SEE YOU.

213
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,856
( office clamoring )

214
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,834
YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY
TO CALL AMIR,

215
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,669
MY CLIENT,
AT 5:00 A.M.?

216
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:39,239
CARL, WHILE YOU WERE
SLEEPING AT 5:00 A.M.

217
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,742
IN YOUR MODERATELY
ATTRACTIVE SUBURBAN HOME,

218
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,344
WITH YOUR MODERATELY
ATTRACTIVE SUBURBAN WIFE,

219
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,445
I WAS HERE,

220
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,849
ASSURING THAT MY FUTURE
WOULD LOOK NOTHING LIKE YOURS.

221
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,318
AND BY THE WAY,
IT WAS AFTERNOON IN KUWAIT.

222
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,689
VERY IMPRESSIVE NUMBERS
THIS MONTH, RYAN.

223
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:58,792
THANK YOU, SIR.
WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE DEAL
I'M WORKING ON NOW.

224
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,094
YOU KEEP THIS UP AND I CAN
SEE A PARTNERSHIP.

225
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,731
I GUESS WE HAVE
THE SAME VISION.

226
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,366
Secretary:
EXCUSE ME.

227
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,202
RYAN, DONALD SIMPSON'S
HOLDING A PRESS CONFERENCE.

228
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,337
YES.

229
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,741
WATCH THIS, SIR.

230
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,278
THIS DAY IS GOING
TO CHANGE MY LIFE.

231
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,281
Jasco was riding
a tide of speculation,

232
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,116
but the press conference
that just wrapped up

233
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,385
turned out to be less
than positive.

234
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,921
So in the final analysis
we concluded that the merger

235
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,323
was not to our fiscal
advantage.

236
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,492
Simpson Publishing
has voted to focus

237
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,295
on our core interest, which is
the newspaper business.

238
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,964
WHAT? WHAT?

239
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,132
Reporter:
With trading halted,
Jasco Pharmaceuticals

240
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,168
announced stunning news
that it has defaulted

241
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,103
on interest payments
on its debt,

242
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,805
and will file
for bankruptcy.

243
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,808
It's stock is expected to
plummet when trading resumes.

244
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,309
YOU WERE RIGHT, TURNER.

245
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,813
JASCO STOCKS
WERE GONNA EXPLODE.

246
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,148
KABOOM!

247
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,154
( screeches )

248
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,067
Woman:
SIR... SIR, YOU'RE NOT
ALLOWED IN THERE.

249
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,903
YOU'RE NOT
ALLOWED IN THERE.

250
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,771
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

251
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,407
TURNER,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

252
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,943
YESTERDAY,
YOU SAID YOU WERE
ACQUIRING JASCO.

253
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:23,576
I HEARD YOU!

254
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,914
OH, RYAN, RYAN.
OH MY GOD.

255
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,483
YOU DIDN'T USE THAT
INSIDE INFORMATION, DID YOU?

256
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,786
YES, I DID.

257
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,489
- DID YOU LOSE A LOT?
- A FUCKING FORTUNE.

258
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,226
CLIENT'S MONEY.
MY OWN.

259
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,094
OHHH!

260
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,831
TSK, TSK, TSK.
RYAN...

261
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,299
RYAN.

262
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,805
YOU SCREWED MY WIFE.

263
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,442
I SCREWED YOU BACK.

264
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,348
YOU WOULD UNDERMINE
YOUR OWN MERGER,

265
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,416
JUST FOR RETRIBUTION?

266
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,585
ARE YOU INSANE?

267
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,858
THERE'S NO STRONGER
MOTIVATION THAN MONEY,
OR REVENGE.

268
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,793
I ALREADY HAVE MONEY.

269
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,100
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

270
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,870
( marching music )

271
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,450
WE JUST LOST HALF
OF OUR TOP CLIENTS, RYAN.

272
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,519
WHY THE HELL
DID YOU DO THIS?

273
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:43,156
I WAS SET UP.
IT WAS FALSE INFORMATION.

274
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,892
THE S.E.C. CALLED.

275
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:48,195
YOU THINK THEY GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU
WERE SET UP?

276
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,098
- THIS WAS ALL LEGAL.
- WHAT ABOUT DUE DILIGENCE?

277
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:55,002
WE JUST LOST $52 MILLION
OF OUR CLIENTS' MONEY.

278
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,071
- FOR WHAT? A TIP?
- MY SOURCE WAS DONALD
SIMPSON HIMSELF.

279
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:01,474
OH, GREAT. WELL, I GUESS
YOU CAN ASK HIM FOR A JOB.

280
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,243
NO, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT--

281
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,312
IT'S THE FUCKING S.E.C.!

282
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,651
IF WE KEEP YOU ON
IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE
WE CONDONE INSIDER TRADING.

283
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,153
I'M SORRY.

284
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:19,159
DON'T--
DON'T DO THIS, PLEASE.

285
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,062
I MARGINED
MY OWN ACCOUNT.

286
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,663
AWW.

287
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,665
WELL.

288
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,635
I GUESS YOU MADE
TWO STUPID MISTAKES THEN.

289
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,372
Cindy:
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

290
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:36,476
OKAY, OKAY. THIS CHANGES
MY PLANS COMPLETELY.

291
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:40,280
BUT I'M AN ADAPTER.
I CAN MAKE MYSELF BELIEVE

292
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,515
THAT THIS IS WORSE FOR YOU
THAN IT IS FOR ME.

293
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,584
I JUST HAVE TO KEEP
REMINDING MYSELF

294
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,120
THAT YOU ARE RYAN TURNER.

295
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,155
OH!

296
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,389
AND HONEY,

297
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,159
IF ANYONE CAN BOUNCE BACK
FROM THIS YOU CAN.

298
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,194
RIGHT?

299
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,230
- RYAN.
- JIM.

300
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,666
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

301
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,568
- WALK WITH ME.
- SURE.

302
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,636
I GUESS YOU HEARD,
I LEFT BEACON TRADING.

303
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,672
EVERYBODY'S HEARD.

304
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,674
I HAVE ADMIRED YOUR FIRM
FOR QUITE AWHILE.

305
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,677
I FIGURED NOW WOULD BE
A GREAT TIME TO JOIN FORCES.

306
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,612
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE DOWNSIZING.

307
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,216
JIM, SIX MONTHS AGO
YOU WERE BEGGING ME,

308
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,118
- NOW I'M--
- POISON.

309
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,254
I'M SORRY, RYAN.
IT'S-- I JUST--

310
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,156
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

311
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,524
( sighs )

312
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,670
NANCY, HI.

313
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,139
RYAN.

314
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,141
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU
FOR DAYS.

315
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,675
YEAH, UH,
I'VE BEEN VERY BUSY

316
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,577
IT'S BEEN TOTALLY--

317
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,279
I GOT YOUR MESSAGES.

318
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,715
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

319
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,018
LOOK, RYAN,

320
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,986
I MADE SOME CALLS.

321
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,688
LOOKS LIKE THEY MIGHT BE
INVESTIGATING YOU.

322
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,992
Judge:
RYAN EDWARD TURNER,

323
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,594
WHILE THIS COMMISSION FINDS
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

324
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,231
FOR INDICTMENT,
YOUR CONDUCT LEAVES US

325
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:07,467
NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO REVOKE
YOUR BROKER'S LICENSE.

326
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,502
( gavel bangs )

327
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,275
THIS ONE WAS
DECLINED, TOO.

328
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,646
TRY THIS ONE.

329
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,681
( beeping )

330
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,686
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
KEEP THIS ONE.

331
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,457
BUT WE ACCEPT
FOOD STAMPS.

332
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,167
Man on phone:
You're jeopardizing
your economic future.

333
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,303
PATRICK, I DON'T
REALLY GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT MY FUTURE.

334
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,305
I'M GONNA CASH IN
MY RETIREMENT FUND.

335
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,340
You're gonna pay
a hell of a penalty.

336
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,109
JUST DO IT!

337
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,091
Woman:
THIS IS FOR THE 13,500
WE AGREED ON.

338
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,159
IF YOU COULD JUST SIGN.

339
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,366
HERE.

340
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,169
GREAT.

341
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,506
GOOD. WE'LL HAVE
EVERYTHING OUT BY 5:00.

342
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,742
MR. TURNER,
I AM SO SORRY

343
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,512
THAT YOU'VE BEEN
EVICTED FROM 989.

344
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,580
THANKS, PAUL.

345
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,646
WHEN I SAID I WANTED
US TO LIVE TOGETHER,

346
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,649
I MEANT AT YOUR PLACE.

347
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,756
( television playing )

348
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:25,338
RYAN, YOU HAVEN'T MOVED
IN A WEEK.

349
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:26,739
LET'S GO OUT.

350
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,843
WE'RE LIVING TOGETHER.

351
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:35,415
WE'RE WELL PAST
THE GOING OUT STAGE.

352
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,650
FINE! I'M GOING OUT
WITH CATHY THEN.

353
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,935
( huffs )

354
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,471
WHAT'S GOING ON?

355
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,473
I'LL PUT
THIS DELICATELY.

356
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,810
YOU'RE A LOSER
AND I'M LEAVING YOU.

357
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,546
THINGS WILL GET BETTER.

358
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,648
I'M TIRED OF WATCHING
OTHER PEOPLE

359
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,850
ENJOY THE LIFE I WAS
SUPPOSED TO HAVE.

360
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,719
MY LIFE IS FLYING BY.

361
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,687
DO YOU SEE A ROCK
ON MY FINGER?

362
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,456
I GET IT.

363
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,258
WHO IS HE?

364
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,659
HE?

365
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,695
OH, YOU THINK THIS
IS ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE?

366
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:27,267
HONEY, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE.

367
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,935
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

368
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,972
HIS NAME
IS FRANCISCO,

369
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,677
AND HE OWNS
A DIAMOND MINE
IN BRAZIL.

370
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,481
WHEN DID YOU MEET
THIS GUY?

371
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,582
MM--
( mumbling )

372
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,751
TUESDAY,
BUT HE LOVES ME.

373
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:48,688
SO YOU'RE JUST
GIVING UP ON US?

374
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,657
IF GOD WANTED
ME TO MARRY POOR

375
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,892
HE WOULD HAVE
MADE ME HOMELY.

376
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,362
WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB?
WHAT ABOUT YOUR COLUMN?

377
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,330
OH, I'M DONE
WITH EVERYTHING HERE.

378
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,866
I'M JETTING OFF
WITH FRAN-CHESCO.

379
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,302
- FRANCISCO.
- YEAH, HIM.

380
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,204
( sighs )

381
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,510
BY THE WAY,
THE RENT'S DUE.

382
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:17,284
* SO LONG TONIGHT

383
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20,387
* EXCUSES FOR LOSERS

384
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,290
* SO LONG TONIGHT

385
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:26,459
* EXCUSES FOR LOSERS...

386
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,631
THAT'S A ZIPKIN,
ISN'T IT?

387
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,600
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

388
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,302
YEAH?

389
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,870
DR. LOU ZIPKIN,

390
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,573
MADISON AVENUE.

391
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,241
WHO TOLD YOU?

392
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:46,946
CALL ME.

393
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,282
I CAN FIX IT.

394
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,683
ASS!

395
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,554
I CAN FIX THAT, TOO!

396
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,457
RYAN, SORRY I'M LATE.

397
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,393
I HAD TO DO A LIPO-INJECTION
ON AN ANOREXIC WOMAN.

398
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,862
NOW SHE WANTS TO BE
THE FAT LADY AT THE CIRCUS.

399
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,064
CINDY LEFT ME.

400
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,733
NO?!

401
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,668
I DIDN'T SEE
THAT COMING.

402
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,438
- ARE YOU INSULTING MY EX?
- OF COURSE NOT.

403
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,307
- SHE'S A BITCH.
- IS ALL I WAS SAYING.

404
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:18,311
SHE LEFT ME
FOR SOME BRAZILIAN GUY.

405
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,380
AND AFTER ALL THAT WORK
I DID ON HER.

406
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,915
( snaps fingers )
WE CAN BUILD YOU A NEW ONE.

407
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,817
IT'S NOT JUST HER.

408
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,686
MY WHOLE LIFE IS A MESS.

409
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,689
I COULD KILL MYSELF,
BUT I'D PROBABLY GO TO HELL,

410
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,691
AND THAT WOULD BE
REDUNDANT.

411
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,394
YOU'D BE AMONG FRIENDS.

412
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:36,496
YEAH, FRIENDS.
NOBODY LIKES ME, BARRY.

413
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,765
COME ON.
"NOBODY" IS OVERSTATING IT.

414
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,669
WAS I THAT BIG AN ASSHOLE?

415
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:45,372
I WOULDN'T SAY BIG.

416
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,640
HUGE?

417
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,676
GIGANTIC.

418
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,778
PAUL BUNYAN
COMES TO MIND.

419
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,346
ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.

420
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,416
LET ME HAVE A BEER.

421
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,050
- GET HIM A BEER.
- ( phone ringing )

422
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,689
( ringing )

423
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,462
YEAH?

424
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,931
IS CINDY THERE?

425
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,601
- Who's this?
- WHO'S THIS?!

426
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:17,670
You're calling me.

427
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,639
THIS IS PAGE HENSEN,
HER PUBLISHER

428
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,674
FROM THE "JOURNAL."
WHO'S THIS?

429
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,477
THIS IS RYAN TURNER,
HER BOYFRIEND,

430
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,413
- FROM SYRACUSE.
- Well...

431
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,914
SHE LEFT
A CONFUSING MESSAGE,

432
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,682
SOMETHING ABOUT MOVING
TO BRAZIL.

433
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:32,585
CAN YOU TELL ME WHETHER
SHE'S COMING TO WORK,

434
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:35,488
or whether I can take
her off payroll?

435
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,723
PAYROLL?

436
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,791
I DON'T HAVE TO PAY HER
IF SHE DOESN'T WORK.

437
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,893
THAT'S THE WAY WE DO
THINGS IN THIS COUNTRY.

438
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,962
It's progressive,
don't you think?

439
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,998
APPARENTLY YOU MISUNDERSTOOD
CINDY'S MESSAGE.

440
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,000
WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO SAY

441
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,803
WAS SHE'S NOT
MOVING TO BRAZIL.

442
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,005
IN FACT, SHE'S HARDLY
MOVING AT ALL.

443
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,941
SHE'S SICK--

444
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,743
BRAZILIAN FLU.

445
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,645
BRAZILIAN FLU?

446
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,112
PUT HER ON THE PHONE.

447
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,148
I CAN'T.
SHE HAS LARYNGITIS.

448
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,617
HER DOCTOR ORDERED
TOTAL VOICE REST.

449
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,520
HER DOCTOR?

450
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,988
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

451
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:12,625
AH...
DR. BARRY SHERMAN.

452
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,696
PERHAPS SHE SHOULD
TAKE AN EXTENDED LEAVE.

453
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,499
No, Cindy wants to do
the column from bed.

454
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,501
SHE SHOULDN'T BE
WITHOUT AN INCOME

455
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,503
WHEN SHE'S THIS SICK,
SHOULD SHE?

456
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:25,071
( sighing )

457
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:28,575
FINE. I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.
I'LL SEND HER LETTERS OVER.

458
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:29,909
No!

459
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,712
SHE'S CONTAGIOUS.
I'LL COME PICK THEM UP.

460
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,747
( dial tone )

461
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,087
SHE'S CONTAGIOUS,
AND HE'S COMING HERE?

462
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,591
OH BOY!

463
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,711
Receptionist:
CHELSEA JOURNAL.

464
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,746
SURE, HANG ON
ONE SECOND.

465
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,850
( woman moans )

466
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:14,153
I'M LOOKING
FOR PAGE HENSEN.

467
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,589
AND I'M LOOKING
FOR A MAN

468
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,659
WHO APPRECIATES THE SIGHT
OF A 70-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

469
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,694
IN A BUBBLE BATH.

470
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,131
I SEE.

471
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,799
IS SHE AVAILABLE?

472
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,835
BUSINESS OR PLEASURE?

473
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:29,836
BUSINESS.

474
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:33,640
SERIOUS OR MONKEY?

475
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,141
NONE OF YOUR.

476
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,644
JUST TELL HER
RYAN TURNER IS HERE,

477
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,178
CINDY'S FRIEND.

478
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,014
- ( beeping )
- THE BOYFRIEND'S HERE.

479
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,524
HI, I'M PAGE HENSEN.

480
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,760
HI, RYAN TURNER.

481
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,194
COFFEE?

482
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,865
- SURE.
- IT'S OVER THERE.

483
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:00,733
LET ME--
SAY UP FRONT

484
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,301
THAT I AM NOT
AT ALL COMFORTABLE

485
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,303
WITH CINDY WORKING
FROM HOME.

486
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,839
I LIKE TO DO THINGS
A CERTAIN WAY AROUND HERE.

487
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,741
WHAT WAY IS THAT?

488
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:11,611
AROUND HERE.
WHERE I CAN CONTROL THEM.

489
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,147
ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU'VE EVER CONTROLLED CINDY?

490
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,249
WELL--

491
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,985
YOU'RE NOT WRONG.

492
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,620
WHICH MAKES ME RIGHT.

493
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:23,222
OTHER THAN BRILLIANT,
IT'S MY FAVORITE
THING TO BE.

494
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:27,226
THAT WAS A JOKE.

495
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,995
IF YOU WANT LEVITY,
MR. TURNER.

496
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,298
I CAN SQUEEZE YOU
IN AROUND 4:00 P.M.
A WEEK FROM THURSDAY--

497
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,767
CINDY KNOWS HER DEADLINE.
HAVE A NICE DAY.

498
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:48,214
CINDY'S DEADLINE
IS 3:00 P.M.

499
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,716
THANK YOU.

500
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,018
BUT I'M OPEN-ENDED.

501
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,924
( hard rock music playing )

502
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,293
THIS THE MAIL ROOM?

503
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,730
UH, DUH!

504
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:07,634
I'M HERE TO PICK UP
ALL THE LETTERS FROM
THE "DEAR, CINDY" COLUMN.

505
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,737
ALL THE LETTERS?

506
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,371
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

507
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,773
OKAY.

508
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,808
I'LL GET YOU
ALL THE LETTERS.

509
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,048
( groaning )

510
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,889
ALL THE LETTERS.

511
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,962
Ryan's voice:
"DEAR CINDY,

512
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,330
I HAVE A SMALL MOUSTACHE,
BUT WAXING IS PAINFUL

513
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:40,833
AND I CAN'T AFFORD
LASER REMOVAL.

514
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:43,903
DO MEN REALLY MIND THIS?
SIGNED, HAIR LIP."

515
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,338
( computer chimes )

516
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,875
"DEAR ADOLF,
THE ONLY HANDLEBAR

517
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,710
A MAN WANTS TO HOLD

518
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,079
IS ON A HARLEY.

519
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,347
IF A GUY WANTS
TO MUNCH HAIR

520
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,850
HE KNOWS WHERE
TO FIND IT."

521
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,820
DAMN!

522
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,855
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

523
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,264
"DEAR CINDY,
I'M PLANNING MY WEDDING,

524
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,167
BUT WHEN I TRY TO GET
OPINIONS ABOUT COLOR SCHEMES,

525
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:17,003
MY FIANCE DOESN'T
SEEM TO CARE.

526
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:20,039
DOES THAT MEAN THAT HE REALLY
DOESN'T WANT TO GET MARRIED?

527
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,775
SIGNED,
THE WEDDING ZINGER."

528
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,381
"DEAR ZINGER,

529
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:32,451
WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING
AT WEDDING COLOR SCHEMES..."

530
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,988
"...HE'S OUT LOOKING
AT ALL THE ASS HE'S NEVER
GONNA TOUCH AGAIN.

531
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,157
JUST MAKE
THE COLOR SCHEME BLACK,

532
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,727
'CAUSE IT'S THE DARKEST
DAY OF HIS LIFE."

533
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,766
THESE SOUND LIKE
THESE WERE WRITTEN

534
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,069
BY SOME SHALLOW,
CALLOUS ANTI-FEMINIST.

535
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:53,005
MAY BE YOU SHOULD
READ THEM AGAIN?

536
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,041
APPARENTLY,
CINDY'S AILMENT

537
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:57,676
HASN'T HEIGHTENED
HER SENSITIVITY.

538
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:02,181
PERHAPS YOU'RE INCAPABLE
OF SEEING THE INSIGHT

539
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,183
AND PROFUNDITY
OF HER WRITING?

540
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:07,353
ARE YOU IMPLYING I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO DO MY JOB?

541
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:08,354
MAYBE SOMEBODY SHOULD.

542
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,790
HOW SUCCESSFUL IS
YOUR LITTLE PAPER, ANYWAY?

543
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,726
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- USUALLY.

544
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,362
PERHAPS WE WOULD BE MORE
SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT THIS COLUMN.

545
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,364
CANCELLED.

546
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,933
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

547
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,002
SEE THE NAME PLATE?
CAN! HAVE!

548
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:27,006
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING--
- WHATEVER IT IS,

549
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,776
I SUGGEST YOU SAVE IT FOR
A LARGER, MORE ATTENTIVE CROWD.

550
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,978
FINE. FINE!

551
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,280
YOU DON'T DESERVE MY--

552
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,050
GIRLFRIEND'S
BRILLIANT MIND.

553
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,120
DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?!

554
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,389
HE IS--

555
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,191
HE HAS SOME...

556
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,458
ASS!

557
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,194
NERVE!

558
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,201
WAIT A SEC.

559
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,804
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT
WHILE I'M SOBER.

560
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,773
- YOU TOOK OVER CINDY'S--
- SHH!

561
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,875
YOU TOOK OVER--
COLUMN?

562
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,077
YOU CAN'T TELL A SOUL.

563
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,412
OR CATHY!

564
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,447
AND THE NEWSPAPER
BOUGHT IT?

565
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,882
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

566
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:13,252
THIS SO CALLED PUBLISHER
CALLED ME-- CINDY--

567
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:17,489
SHALLOW, CALLOUS,
INSENSITIVE,

568
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:20,259
THEN SHE FIRED
CINDY-- ME-- US.

569
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:23,362
OH, SO YOU'RE STILL
OUT OF WORK?

570
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,332
OH NO. I'M NOT FINISHED.
I FOUND CINDY'S CONTRACT,

571
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,534
AND SHE'S NOT
TAKING THIS LYING DOWN--

572
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,436
SICK AS SHE IS.

573
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,971
WELL--

574
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,140
THAT CINDY'S GOT BALLS.

575
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,775
SHE DOES NOW.

576
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,187
COULDN'T KEEP AWAY,
COULD YOU?

577
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,057
MUST BE THAT BAD GIRL VIBE
I GIVE OFF--

578
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,425
PHEROMONES AND POLIGRIP.

579
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,994
ENTICING,

580
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,996
BUT I'M HERE
TO SEE MS. HENSEN.

581
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:00,900
SHE TOLD ME TO SEND YOU AWAY
IF YOU EVER SHOWED UP AGAIN.

582
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:03,402
SO, IF YOU WANT
TO GET TO HER,

583
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,904
YOU HAVE
TO GO THROUGH ME,

584
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:08,607
AND I CAN MAP OUT
A VERY DIRECT ROUTE.

585
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,344
HOW ABOUT A COMPROMISE?
I'LL PINCH YOUR BUTT
AS WE WALK.

586
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:14,280
THAT'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT!

587
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,049
- THAT'S FOREPLAY.
- ( giggling ) AH.

588
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,151
ALL RIGHT.

589
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,991
NO, WAIT.

590
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,059
STOP.

591
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,895
NO, YOU CAN'T.

592
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,897
I TRIED TO STOP HIM.

593
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,331
IRIS, OUT.

594
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,533
TURNER, FOLLOW.

595
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,342
I CAME TO GIVE YOU
ONE MORE CHANCE.

596
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,011
OH! THIS SOUNDS GOOD.

597
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,579
CINDY IS DEVASTATED
THAT YOU WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE

598
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:51,117
OF HER DISABILITY
AS A PRETENSE TO BREACH
HER CONTRACT.

599
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,220
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS?
PLEASE LEAVE.

600
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,588
I'M SORRY.
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

601
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,590
LEAVE!

602
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,259
I RECOMMEND
YOU RECONSIDER

603
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,161
BEFORE HER DAMAGES
INCREASE.

604
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,462
"DAMAGES"?

605
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,898
CINDY'S PAIN
AND SUFFERING.

606
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,533
MR. TURNER,
YOU'RE ON MY TURF,

607
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,301
AND I KNOW PUBLISHING.

608
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:11,603
CINDY WROTE
ABOUT MUNCHING HAIR,

609
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,172
AND GETTING ASS.

610
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,942
SHE'S THE ONE
IN BREACH, NOT ME.

611
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,277
IF YOU WANT TO
TAKE ME ON LEGALLY,

612
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,312
I'M READY FOR A FIGHT.
IS CINDY?

613
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:29,388
NO.

614
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,592
IRIS, HELP.

615
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,327
OH, WHAT'S THIS
PIECE OF PAPER

616
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,528
FALLING TO THE FLOOR

617
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,931
WITH A HOME
ADDRESS ON IT?

618
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:41,567
THANK YOU.

619
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,303
SHE LIKES ROSES.

620
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,605
I LIKE TULIPS.

621
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,579
( doorbell rings )

622
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,123
( rings )

623
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,593
( whispering )
SHIT.

624
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,667
( rings )

625
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,606
( clattering )

626
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,545
GO AWAY, MR. TURNER.

627
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,714
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
- ( doorbell rings )

628
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,250
IT'S EASY. JUST PRETEND
YOU'RE WALKING IN,

629
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,019
EXCEPT GO THE OTHER WAY.

630
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,289
- ( rings )
- JUST GIVE ME TWO MINUTES.

631
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:38,690
I'M ENTERTAINING.

632
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,626
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

633
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,061
( rings )

634
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,629
I'LL--
CALL THE POLICE.

635
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,664
- NO, YOU WON'T.
- ( ringing )

636
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,699
THIS IS MY HOME,
MR. TURNER.

637
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:50,036
I DON'T MIX BUSINESS
AND PLEASURE.

638
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:52,771
I DON'T THINK YOU MIX
PLEASURE AND PLEASURE.

639
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,274
YOU ARE WAY OUT OF LINE.

640
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:59,711
JUST GIVE ME
TWO MINUTES, AND I PROMISE
I'LL NEVER BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

641
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,513
I CAME TO...

642
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,382
APOLOGIZE.

643
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,089
TWO MINUTES.

644
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,760
AND THE TOCK
IS CLICKING.

645
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,433
ENTERTAINING, HUH?

646
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,675
NICE PLACE...

647
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,710
I'M SURE YOU CAME
WITH A POINT.

648
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,581
I CAN'T GO BACK
TO CINDY AND TELL HER
SHE LOST HER COLUMN.

649
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,317
I SEE. WHERE WILL
YOU BE GOING THEN?

650
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,652
CINDY IS VERY SICK.

651
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,222
PLEASE, HAVE
A LITTLE EMPATHY.

652
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,257
EMPATHY?

653
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,727
EVERY CENT I COULD BEG
AND BORROW WENT INTO MY PAPER.

654
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,131
CINDY'S COLUMN HAS NEVER
REALLY FIT IN WITH MY VISION.

655
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:55,234
SHE LACKS WARMTH,
INSIGHT,

656
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:58,304
AND MOST IMPORTANT,
SENSITIVITY.

657
00:33:58,337 --> 00:33:59,705
PEOPLE CHANGE.

658
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:03,509
PEOPLE'S LIVES CHANGE.
PEOPLE, I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT.

659
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,178
THINGS HAPPEN THAT
CHANGE PEOPLE.

660
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,781
GIVE HER
ONE MORE CHANCE.

661
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,651
AS A FAVOR TO ME?

662
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,520
AND WHAT
DO I OWE YOU?

663
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:20,426
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU PUT ON LIPSTICK
AT THIS HOUR?

664
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,161
I'M NOT WEARING LIPSTICK.

665
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,164
YES, YOU ARE.

666
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,599
I MIGHT BE
GOING OUT LATER.

667
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,268
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

668
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,603
IF I PUT MY MAKEUP
ON AT NIGHT,

669
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,406
IT SAVES ME 20 MINUTES
IN THE MORNING.

670
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,211
TIME'S UP.

671
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,580
OKAY.

672
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,754
HEY.

673
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:52,691
ONE MORE CHANCE.

674
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,361
SEE, YOU DO HAVE
A SOFT SPOT.

675
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,596
AND RIGHT NOW,
I'M STARTING TO THINK

676
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,831
SOMEONE DROPPED ME
ON IT.

677
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,806
( groans )

678
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,809
- Ryan: "DEAR CINDY--"
- NOW REMEMBER, YOU'VE GOT

679
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,745
TO REACH DOWN,
WAY PAST THAT CYNICISM.

680
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,614
"DEAR CINDY--"

681
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:19,818
PAST THOSE HARDENED LAYERS
OF EGOMANIACAL SELF-ABSORPTION.

682
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,720
"DEAR CINDY--"

683
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,555
YOU'RE A GIRL--

684
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:26,658
- I GET IT. THANKS.
- I'M SAYING BE SENSITIVE.

685
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,560
"DEAR CINDY,
MY EX AND I BROKE UP,

686
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,729
BUT I STILL CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HIM.

687
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,599
IS FOUR MONTHS
TOO MUCH TIME TO GRIEVE
MY LOST LOVE?

688
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,402
SIGNED, NOT
A MOURNING PERSON."

689
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:39,338
OH GOOD,
A NEUROTIC ONE.

690
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:42,608
NOW YOU,
BEING A SENSITIVE
WOMAN, SAY...

691
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,677
"FOUR DAYS IS
TOO MUCH TIME.

692
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:50,749
THE BEST WAY TO GET OVER A MAN,
IS TO GET UNDER A NEW ONE."

693
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:53,285
NO, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.

694
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,686
I JUST DID.

695
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,623
- IT'S NOT SENSITIVE.
- MAYBE IT IS TO A WOMAN.

696
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,757
NO. SAY...

697
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,627
"HE PROBABLY LEFT YOU
'CAUSE YOUR ASS GOT TOO BIG."

698
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,961
SAY THAT!

699
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,365
THEN TELL HER I CAN FIX IT.
PUT IN MY NAME AND
OFFICE NUMBER.

700
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,700
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
- IT COULD BE.

701
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,636
I'LL GIVE YOU
A FINDER'S FEE.

702
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,471
BARRY, NO.

703
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,506
FINE. READ THE NEXT ONE.

704
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,878
"DEAR CINDY, I CAUGHT
MY HUSBAND CHEATING--"

705
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,581
PROBABLY DUE
TO A FALLING BACKSIDE...

706
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,351
GRAVITY HITS,
HE LOSES INTEREST.

707
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,885
IT'S SAD, REALLY.

708
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,654
TELL HER I CAN FIX IT.

709
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,656
PUT IN MY NAME
AND OFFICE NUMBER.

710
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,990
BARRY, NO.

711
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,626
YOU'RE LOSING
A LOT OF MONEY
YOU COULD USE.

712
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:39,298
THIS GOES ON.
"I CAUGHT MY HUSBAND CHEATING,

713
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:40,732
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE WORST OF IT.

714
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,601
THE WOMAN IS NOT HALF
AS ATTRACTIVE AS ME.

715
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,203
AM I WRONG FOR FEELING
TWICE AS HURT?"

716
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:50,376
WHAT WOULD
A WOMAN SAY?

717
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,481
OH.

718
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,252
OH GOD,
NOT CATHY?

719
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,221
All: OHM-MMM.

720
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:09,661
- All: OHM.
- ( cell phone ringing )

721
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:15,301
OHM GONNA GET THAT.

722
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:16,568
HELLO.

723
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:20,439
HI, HONEY.
I JUST NEED TO ASK YOU
A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.

724
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,741
- I'M PRACTICING YOGA.
- Barry: It'll just
take a second.

725
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:26,445
SAY A MAN IS CHEATING
WITH A WOMAN

726
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,847
that's not half
as attractive
as his wife,

727
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,483
SHOULD THE WIFE
BE UPSET

728
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:34,420
THAT THE OTHER WOMAN
IS UGLY?

729
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,955
ALL RIGHT,
YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH,
WHO THE HELL IS SHE?

730
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,826
- WHAT? NO, NO--
- YOU COULDN'T BE MAN ENOUGH
TO TELL ME IN PERSON?

731
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,429
- Honey, honey--
- I'M SORRY, PROCEED.

732
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:45,731
IT'S THAT
BITCH RECEPTIONIST
WITH THE HAIRY CLEAVAGE!

733
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,933
- RHONDA?
- I KNEW IT!
YOU CHEATIN' BASTARD.

734
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,668
I'LL BE OFF IN A SEC.

735
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,403
I'M CALLING A LAWYER!

736
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,004
CATHY, HONEY, RELAX,

737
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:54,940
- I'M NOT CHEATING.
- What?

738
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,742
I SWEAR,
I WOULD NEVER.

739
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,678
OH. WELL...

740
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:02,681
THEN I SAY HE DESERVES
TO GET STUCK WITH THE UGLY ONE.

741
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,783
I GOTTA GO, HONEY.
LOVE YA, BYE.

742
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,487
WHAT?

743
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,022
SOMEBODY WANT
TO USE THE PHONE?

744
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,728
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

745
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,632
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

746
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,800
HMM?

747
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,870
OH, THAT...
IF THE HUSBAND'S CHEATING,

748
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,872
HE DESERVES TO END UP
WITH THE UGLY ONE.

749
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,679
SHE MAY BE
ONTO SOMETHING.

750
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:36,682
Ryan:
"THEY SAY DOGS
ARE A MAN'S BEST FRIEND.

751
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,551
YOUR MAN FOUND
A REAL BARKER.

752
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:41,720
BUT REMEMBER,
WHEN YOU LIE DOWN
WITH DOGS..."

753
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,555
Page:
"...YOU WAKE UP WITH FLEAS.

754
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:45,724
BUT WHEN YOU LIE DOWN
WITH UGLY DOGS,

755
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:49,395
YOU WAKE UP ALONE, BECAUSE
EVEN THE FLEAS DON'T WANT YOU."

756
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:54,533
I HAVE TO ADMIT
THEY'RE... BETTER.

757
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:57,035
BETTER?
THEN THAT'S GOOD,
RIGHT?

758
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,706
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU SAID TO HER,

759
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:01,840
BUT IT HELPED.

760
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:05,043
I TOLD HER
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S SUFFERING.

761
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:10,015
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I STILL THINK SHE HAS
A LONG WAY TO GO.

762
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,883
BUT YOU'LL...
PRINT THESE?

763
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,084
AND PAY FOR 'EM?

764
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:16,988
I GUESS SO.

765
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,024
CINDY IS GONNA DIE
WHEN I TELL HER.

766
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:25,831
DO I DETECT...
HUMOR?

767
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,535
SLIPS OUT,
NOW AND THEN.

768
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,973
SHE LIKES THE COLUMN.

769
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:37,008
I TOLD YOU.

770
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,645
BUT RYAN, DEAR,
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR,

771
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,780
MISSPELL A WORD
NOW AND THEN.

772
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,682
CINDY ALWAYS DID.

773
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,418
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

774
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:49,688
SURE.
GORGEOUS,
THEREFORE STUPID.

775
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,957
WHY AM I ALWAYS
A STEREOTYPE?

776
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,693
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL PAGE?

777
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,728
I HAVE A FEELING
ABOUT YOU.

778
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:01,567
ONE MORE WORD
OF ADVICE, THOUGH.

779
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,134
THIS ISN'T A GAME.

780
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:05,904
PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY
READ THIS DRIVEL.

781
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:08,106
SOME FOLKS HAVE
NOWHERE ELSE TO TURN.

782
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,676
SO IF YOU'RE GONNA DO IT,
DO IT FOR REAL.

783
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,744
DON'T BE A MAN,

784
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,547
BE HUMAN.

785
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,732
HOW MUCH CAN THIS
REALLY HURT?

786
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:38,970
OW. OW!

787
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:41,172
Ryan:
"DEAR HAIR LIP,

788
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:44,009
IF A MAN HAS A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR FACIAL HAIR,

789
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:48,213
STRAP HIM DOWN, RIP OFF
HIS 5:00 SHADOW WITH HOT WAX,

790
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:51,683
AND ASK HIM IF ANY WOMAN
IS WORTH THAT TWICE A WEEK."

791
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,995
EXCUSE ME.

792
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,631
YOU FORGOT YOUR BAG.

793
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:08,266
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

794
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,935
YOU'RE WELCOME.

795
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,703
YOU FLIRTED WITH HIM.

796
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:13,672
CAN I HELP IT IF THEY
STILL LOOK AT ME?

797
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:17,643
- WOMEN LOOK AT ME, YOU KNOW.
- WHY DO YOU THINK I'M
STILL WITH YOU?

798
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,578
- ACK!
- ( woman laughs )

799
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:28,820
LISTEN TO THIS ONE.
"DEAR CINDY,

800
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:31,757
I'M IN A MONOGAMOUS
RELATIONSHIP WITH
A GREAT GUY.

801
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,093
IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES
I GET THE URGE TO STRAY..."

802
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,596
"...MAYBE THE STABILITY
BORES ME,

803
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:40,932
OR I JUST CRAVE THE EXCITEMENT
OF SEX WITH SOMEONE NEW.

804
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,703
HELP, I'M CONFUSED."

805
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,805
AND THEN THIS CINDY WOMAN
WRITES BACK,

806
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,840
Ryan's voice:
"DEAR CONFUSED,

807
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,577
ALTHOUGH
MULTIPLE PARTNERS

808
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,211
CAN BE EXCITING,

809
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:58,016
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF THEM
AS YOU WOULD A SNOWSTORM..."

810
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,652
"...YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW
WHEN THEY WILL COME,

811
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,254
HOW LONG THEY WILL LAST,

812
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:05,724
OR HOW MANY INCHES
YOU WILL GET..."

813
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,326
Iris:
"...STICK TO WHAT
YOU ALREADY HAVE.

814
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,664
IT'S SO MUCH NICER
TO WATCH THE STORM PASS

815
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:15,200
CUDDLING WITH SOMEONE
WHO LOVES YOU."

816
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,669
I FEEL SO LONELY.

817
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:19,805
CIRCULATION'S
UP 3%.

818
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:21,272
THANK YOU.

819
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:25,343
APPARENTLY PEOPLE ARE--

820
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,178
HOW DO I SAY THIS?

821
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,147
THEY'RE READING IT.

822
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,317
THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD
WITH A NEWSPAPER,
HONEY.

823
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,985
EXCUSE ME.

824
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:36,955
- OH!
- MR. TURNER. COME IN.

825
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,990
SOMEONE'S EXCITED
TO SEE ME.

826
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:41,059
HELL-- THAT ALWAYS
HAPPENS WHEN I WEAR

827
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,895
A RAYON BLOUSE
WITH NO BRA.

828
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:46,197
COLOR ME
EMBARRASSED.

829
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,836
I AM VERY PLEASED
WITH CINDY'S PERFORMANCE.

830
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:54,606
I GUESS THIS ILLNESS
HAS HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT
ON HER AFTER ALL.

831
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,776
- OR... YOU HAVE.
- THANK YOU.

832
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:00,646
ANYWAY...

833
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,848
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

834
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,952
IT'S THE FIRST PAYCHECK THAT
CINDY ACTUALLY DESERVES.

835
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:09,387
FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT.

836
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,657
THAT'S GREAT.

837
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:16,061
YOU LOOK NICE TODAY.

838
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,796
THANK YOU.

839
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:20,799
BUT MAY I REMIND YOU,
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND
A SICK WOMAN?

840
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:23,835
NO, YOU HAVE
A DEFINITE GLOW.

841
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:32,644
IF YOU'RE NOT TAKING HIM,
I WILL.

842
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:34,846
IRIS, WHAT ARE YOU
BABBLING ABOUT?

843
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,815
HE OBVIOUSLY WANTS
ONE OF US.

844
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:38,784
HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND.

845
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:41,720
WHAT THE HELL.
SHE'LL BE DEAD SOON, ANYWAY.

846
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:44,690
( rap music playing )

847
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,273
DUDE, I AM SO
NOT HAPPY

848
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,843
WITH THE DIRECTION
THIS SEEMS TO BE GOING.

849
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:07,212
DUDE, GET OVER IT.

850
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,723
( knocking )

851
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,327
( pounding )

852
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,430
ALL RIGHT,
WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?

853
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:27,332
CINDY?
SHE'S NOT HERE.

854
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:30,068
EVERY TIME I CALL HERE,
YOU TELL ME SHE CAN'T TALK.

855
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,871
WHEN I CALL AT THE OFFICE,
THEY TELL ME SHE'S WORKING
AT HOME.

856
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,740
SHE'S TALKING TO SOMEONE,
SOMEWHERE,

857
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:36,708
AND IT'S NOT ME
AND IT'S NOT HERE.

858
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:38,476
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

859
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,446
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT
THE TRUTH, CATHY? FINE.

860
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,915
CINDY WENT AWAY FOR AWHILE,
ON PERSONAL BUSINESS.

861
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:46,985
- CINDY TELLS ME EVERYTHING.
- NOT THIS.

862
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,087
HER COLUMN IS STILL
BEING PRINTED.

863
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,122
SHE'S EMAILING IT.

864
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,795
YOU'RE LYING.
AND I'M NOT LEAVING--

865
00:44:56,828 --> 00:44:59,330
UNTIL I GET
SOME ANSWERS.

866
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,801
OKAY. YOU WANT
THE REAL TRUTH?

867
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:08,173
CINDY'S... PREGNANT.

868
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,941
WHAT?!

869
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:11,476
OH MY GOD!

870
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:13,812
HER ASS IS
GONNA GET SO FAT.

871
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:16,314
WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL ME?

872
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,950
WAIT-- THAT IS SOMETHING
SHE WOULD TELL ME!

873
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:20,451
BUT--

874
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:22,253
IT'S NOT MY BABY.

875
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:25,423
OH MY GOD.

876
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:28,860
IT WAS GUNTHER, HER TRAINER.
I TOLD HER TO PUT AN END TO IT.

877
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:30,862
OOPS.

878
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:33,865
OH, RYAN,
YOU MUST BE DEVASTATED--

879
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:35,967
EVEN MORE SO NOW.
WHEN YOU TALK TO CINDY,

880
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,469
TELL HER BARRY CAN HELP
WITH THE STRETCH MARKS.

881
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:41,106
AND IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
DON'T HESITATE TO CALL.

882
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:43,141
LIKE YOU HAVE IN THE PAST.

883
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,858
Woman's voice:
"DEAR CINDY,

884
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:02,360
I'VE RECENTLY BEEN
INTRODUCED TO YOUR COLUMN,

885
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:03,761
AND I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.

886
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:07,532
I DON'T HAVE
MANY PEOPLE TO TALK TO,
SO I THOUGHT, WELL...

887
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:09,467
HERE GOES.

888
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,870
MY SON HAS THE AIDS.

889
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:14,105
I NEVER APPROVED
OF HIS LIFESTYLE,

890
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:16,341
AND WAS ALWAYS
HONEST ABOUT IT.

891
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,844
NOW, I LIVE IN SHAME,

892
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:21,980
AND HAVE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE
HE HAS CANCER.

893
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:25,951
I KNOW MOST OF YOUR STUFF
IS ABOUT BROKEN HEARTS
AND ROMANCE,

894
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:29,120
BUT WHY CAN'T
I MOVE PAST THIS?

895
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:32,824
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME
TO FIND AN ANSWER HERE.

896
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:34,826
PLEASE...

897
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,862
HELP ME."

898
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,869
Ryan:
"I DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF TIME TO FIND AN ANSWER,

899
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:46,204
PLEASE HELP ME."

900
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:52,944
YOU CAN'T GIVE ONE
OF YOUR CLEVER ANSWERS
ON THIS ONE.

901
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:54,846
THIS IS SERIOUS.

902
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,249
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I'M IN WAY OVER MY HEAD.

903
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,853
I'M GETTING OUT
WHILE I STILL CAN.

904
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,154
ALL RIGHT, RYAN.

905
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,190
HEY, LISTEN,
IF YOU WANT TO QUIT,

906
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:08,093
I DON'T BLAME YOU.
WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT,

907
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:10,628
THIS DOCTOR ASKED ME TO CONSULT
ON THIS BURN VICTIM.

908
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,532
I GO IN THE ROOM.
THIS GUY'S GOT THIRD DEGREE
BURNS ON 90% OF HIS BODY.

909
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:18,069
HE WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN
I-IT-- IT WAS HORRIFYING.

910
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:20,138
AND I LOOK AT THE GUY,
AND I WAS--

911
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,940
I WAS SCARED SHITLESS,
ALL RIGHT?

912
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:23,875
SO I RAN OUT OF THERE.

913
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:26,511
AND THEN I WAS EMBARRASSED.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

914
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:28,947
SO I CALLED A FRIEND OF MINE,
TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED.

915
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,582
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?
HE GOES, "HEY, YOU'RE SCARED.

916
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:34,352
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT
BURN VICTIM FEELS?"

917
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,655
SMART FRIEND.

918
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,258
YES, YOU WERE.

919
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:45,563
THANKS, BARRY.

920
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:53,038
Ryan's voice:
"IT IS NOT HOW YOUR SON DIES,

921
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:55,140
BUT RATHER, HOW HE LIVED.

922
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:58,009
HE MAY NOT AGREE WITH ALL
YOUR LIFE CHOICES EITHER,

923
00:47:58,043 --> 00:47:59,577
BUT I'LL BET HE LOVES YOU.

924
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,513
DON'T BE ANGRY AT YOURSELF
FOR FEELING SHAME,

925
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,416
BE ANGRY AT THE PEOPLE
WHO INSTILL SHAME IN YOU.

926
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,519
LET GO OF YOUR PREJUDICE,
AND GRAB HOLD OF YOUR SON.

927
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:12,123
YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
AFTER HE'S GONE FOR ANGER."

928
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,533
Man's voice:
"DEAR CINDY,
I'M LOSING MY HAIR,

929
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:25,070
AND I'M LOSING MY CONFIDENCE
WITH WOMEN.

930
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:27,572
AM I JUST BEING PARANOID?"

931
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:29,207
"TRUST ME.

932
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,642
A LOT OF WOMEN KNOW
YOUR HAIR LOSS IS CAUSED

933
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:35,380
BY AN OVERSUPPLY
OF MALE HORMONES.

934
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:38,349
REMEMBER THIS THOUGHT--

935
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,251
THE MORE HAIR YOU LOSE,

936
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,420
THE MORE HEAD YOU GET."

937
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,660
( phone ringing )

938
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:53,631
HELLO? CATHY?

939
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,533
OKAY, RELAX.
TAKE A BREATH.

940
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:58,403
- CHANNEL 5--
TURN IT ON! TURN IT ON!
- I WILL. THANKS.

941
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,043
...Causing quite a buzz
in the Tri-state area,

942
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:07,378
is advice columnist,
Cindy Styne,

943
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:09,680
who has a rather
unorthodox approach,

944
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,716
and unique perspective,
to say the least.

945
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,985
For example,
a woman writes in

946
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:17,555
she's having no luck finding
the perfect caring guy.

947
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:19,690
So Cindy advises,

948
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:21,559
"The problem isn't
finding a boyfriend

949
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:23,628
who is perfect,
gentle and caring.

950
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,463
The problem is,

951
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:28,299
guys like that already
have boyfriends."

952
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,969
"New York 1" is hoping
to get an exclusive with her.

953
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:35,573
I MAY HAVE TO GET HER
EXCLUSIVELY, TOO.

954
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,444
GET ME AN ADDRESS
ON CINDY STYNE.

955
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:54,192
PAGE, WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE PAYROLL.

956
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:56,061
- YOU'RE KIDDING?
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

957
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:58,496
- SO DON'T TAKE OUT
THAT SECOND MORTGAGE.
- OKAY.

958
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:00,065
HEY, IF YOU'RE LUCKY...

959
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,133
YOU MAY EVEN BE ABLE
TO CASH YOUR OWN PAYCHECK.

960
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,702
- THAT'S FANTASTIC!
- PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

961
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,338
OTHERWISE THERE'S A FREE-FOR-ALL
ON THE OFFICE SUPPLIES.

962
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,574
- HI.
- HELLO.

963
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:11,342
DID YOU SEE IT ON TV?

964
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:14,045
YES, ALONG WITH HALF
A MILLION OTHER WOMEN
IN THE CITY.

965
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,347
AND TO THINK,
YOU WERE GOING
TO CANCEL THE COLUMN.

966
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:18,549
I'M THE FIRST TO ADMIT
WHEN I'M WRONG.

967
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:19,650
GREAT. GO AHEAD.

968
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,619
- WHAT?
- ADMIT IT.

969
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,721
THE ADMISSION WAS INHERENT
IN WHAT I SAID.

970
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:26,224
STILL, WON'T IT
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER
TO ACTUALLY SAY IT?

971
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:29,160
NO. BUT IF IT WOULD
MAKE YOU FELL BETTER,

972
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,729
I WAS WRONG.
HAPPY?

973
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,065
LET'S NOT
POINT FINGERS.

974
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:37,468
MR. TURNER,
I WAS ALREADY GOING
TO RENEW CINDY'S CONTRACT.

975
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:39,404
I DON'T KNOW.

976
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:41,139
WHAT DON'T YOU KNOW?

977
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:44,175
CIRCULATION
IS UP 20%.

978
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:47,312
CINDY MAY HAVE SOME STIPULATIONS
BEFORE SHE RE-SIGNS.

979
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,347
WHAT KIND OF STIPULATIONS?

980
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,648
YOU KNOW CINDY.

981
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,783
I COULD TALK TO HER.
I DO HAVE SOME INFLUENCE.

982
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:55,686
PERHAPS WE COULD DISCUSS
HER DEMANDS OVER DINNER?

983
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,555
- TONIGHT?
- NO, I CAN'T TONIGHT.

984
00:50:57,588 --> 00:51:00,525
I HAVE TO REVIEW
A PERFORMANCE ARTIST.

985
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,360
WHAT ABOUT DRINKS
BEFOREHAND?

986
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:05,863
FINE.
6:30 AT THE PARK GRANT.

987
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,798
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

988
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:12,670
IRIS!

989
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:16,307
THE SEXY TURQUOISE ONE
WITH THE SPAGHETTI STRAPS,
HONEY.

990
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:19,710
NO, I WAS LOOKING
FOR TODAY'S GALLEYS.

991
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,612
RIGHT THERE
ON YOUR DESK.

992
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,514
I SEE. THANK YOU.

993
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,651
NOT THE NAVY SUIT?

994
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,862
HELLO.

995
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,398
Bartender:
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

996
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,367
COSMOPOLITAN,
PLEASE.

997
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:44,902
BEFORE YOU MAKE
ANY DEMANDS,

998
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,404
JUST REMEMBER
CINDY'S COLUMN

999
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,207
WAS CLOSE TO EXTINCTION
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

1000
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,176
YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.

1001
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:54,712
I'M READY TO LISTEN,
AND I'M OPEN TO COMPROMISE,

1002
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:57,648
BUT PLEASE KEEP IN MIND
HER RECENT SUCCESS

1003
00:51:57,682 --> 00:52:01,452
WAS PARTLY FUELED
BY MY PATIENCE
AND LENIENCY.

1004
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:03,388
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE ON A DATE?

1005
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:05,856
OF COURSE, I DO INTEND
TO PLAY HARDBALL.

1006
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,426
WITH A MAN THAT THOUGHT
YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL?

1007
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,428
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.

1008
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,697
A DATE THAT KEPT YOU UP
ALL NIGHT THINKING
ABOUT IT?

1009
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,765
THIS IS A BUSINESS
MEETING.

1010
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,635
AND I'VE
GIVEN UP DATING.

1011
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:18,903
OH, GIVEN UP?

1012
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:21,639
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE
BEEN HURT PRETTY BADLY.

1013
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:25,510
THAT BAD, HUH?

1014
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:28,313
( sighs )

1015
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,248
I WAS INVOLVED
WITH SOMEONE.

1016
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:32,817
AS IT TURNS OUT,
I WANTED ONE MAN

1017
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,585
TO FULFILL
MY EVERY NEED,

1018
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:37,255
HE WANTED EVERY WOMAN
TO FULFILL HIS ONE.

1019
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:39,457
HIS WIFE
KICKED HIM OUT, TOO.

1020
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,292
NOW, ABOUT
THIS CONTRACT.

1021
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:43,694
SO CLEARLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
DON'T WANT IN A MAN.

1022
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:45,463
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1023
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,432
SOMEONE WHO CAN
CONCENTRATE.

1024
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:49,667
- SERIOUSLY.
- THANK YOU.

1025
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,304
WHAT EVERY WOMAN WANTS.

1026
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,773
SOMEONE WARM.
SOMEONE SENSITIVE.

1027
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:58,376
SOMEONE WHO'LL CRY
WHEN I SMACK HIM.

1028
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,478
REALLY?
WHAT DO YOU
WANT IN A MAN?

1029
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,782
SOMEONE WHO'S
NOT DECEITFUL.

1030
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:09,720
THIS CONTRACT...

1031
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:13,491
SORRY. RIGHT.

1032
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,693
OKAY...

1033
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:18,296
I THINK A 5% INCREASE
IN SALARY IS FAIR.

1034
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,564
FOR A TRANSIT WORKER.

1035
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:21,399
50% OF THE PROFIT
INCREASE,

1036
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:23,634
MOVE THE COLUMN
TO PAGE FOUR.

1037
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:25,670
I SEE YOU CAME
PREPARED.

1038
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:29,674
- OKAY.
- SO TELL ME...

1039
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,643
WHAT IS IT, EXACTLY,
THAT YOU WANT IN A WOMAN?

1040
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:36,314
CINDY, FOR EXAMPLE?

1041
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:40,751
MAYBE 50%
IS A LITTLE HIGH.

1042
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:42,787
CLEARLY EVEN YOU
HAVE EXPECTATIONS.

1043
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,422
FRONT PAGE BILLING,

1044
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,324
AND 10%
OF THE PROFIT INCREASE.

1045
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:49,660
WHAT DOES SHE DO TO DESERVE
THIS KIND OF LOYALTY?

1046
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:55,533
CINDY CHANGED MY LIFE
WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT.

1047
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:58,503
DID SHE?

1048
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,410
HER TERMS SEEM FAIR.

1049
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:08,346
I'LL HAVE MY ATTORNEY
DRAW UP PAPERS.

1050
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:09,714
THAT'S IT?

1051
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,616
DO YOUR BUSINESS
AND LEAVE?

1052
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:13,384
I FEEL SO CHEAP.

1053
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:15,986
I TOLD YOU I WAS REVIEWING
A PERFORMANCE ARTIST TONIGHT.

1054
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,723
I COULD WALK YOU TO A CAB.
OR, YOU KNOW, TAG ALONG.

1055
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,626
I'M NOT SO SURE
YOU WOULD ENJOY THIS.

1056
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:22,993
IT'S VERY PROGRESSIVE.

1057
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:25,363
YOU DON'T THINK
I'D FIT IN WITH THE ELITIST,

1058
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:28,466
HIGH-BROW, ARTSY FARTSY
DOWNTOWN SCENE?

1059
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:30,901
I CAN BE AS PROGRESSIVE
AS THE NEXT GUY.

1060
00:54:32,537 --> 00:54:35,540
OKAY, COME ON.

1061
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:47,552
- WHAT IS "PROJECTED PASTELS?"
- ( music plays )

1062
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,720
YOU'LL SEE.

1063
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:17,515
OKAY, MAYBE NOT
AS PROGRESSIVE
AS THE NEXT GUY.

1064
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,655
THE ARTIST
INSERTS THE HOSE

1065
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:27,425
AND FILLS HIMSELF
WITH PAINT.

1066
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,794
YOU'RE KIDDING.

1067
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:34,732
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

1068
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:38,135
NOW HE'LL PROJECTILE
RELEASE THE PAINT

1069
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,405
ONTO THE CANVAS.

1070
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,740
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO BRUSHES?

1071
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:46,076
HE CALLS IT "ENEMART."

1072
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,846
IT REPRESENTS THE WASTE
OF HIS LIFE

1073
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:52,082
BEING RELEASED
FROM THE BOWELS
OF HIS BEING.

1074
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:55,420
( applause; laughter )

1075
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:11,168
DO YOU FIND
THIS OFFENSIVE?

1076
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:16,541
NO. WHAT ABOUT THIS
COULD POSSIBLY
BE OFFENSIVE?

1077
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,446
( applause )

1078
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,652
I'M SO SORRY.

1079
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:30,054
JUST BECAUSE I GOT
A LITTLE PAINT IN THE FACE

1080
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:31,856
FROM A MAN'S ASS?

1081
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,123
( laughing )

1082
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:36,393
BUT IT WAS A WELL
RESPECTED ASS.

1083
00:56:38,663 --> 00:56:41,532
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN YOUR EXPRESSION.

1084
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:43,100
IT WAS ACTUALLY
KIND OF CUTE.

1085
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,002
YOU THINK SO?

1086
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:59,517
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

1087
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:21,205
HEY, DUDE.

1088
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:22,973
BLOW ME!

1089
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:25,175
( whistle )

1090
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:27,645
HELLO? COULD YOU CASH
YOUR PAYCHECK, PLEASE,

1091
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,547
SO I CAN BALANCE
MY BOOKS FOR ONCE?

1092
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,783
THEN WHAT AM I GOING TO PUT
UNDER MY COFFEE CUP, STEVEN?

1093
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,919
IRIS,
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

1094
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,954
I JUST WANT TO LET
YOU KNOW THAT.

1095
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:38,889
THEN SUFFER
IN SILENCE, STEVEN!

1096
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:40,124
UH-OH.

1097
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:43,227
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO SEE YOU RIGHT NOW.

1098
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,162
- DID SHE SAY THAT?
- SHE IMPLIED IT,

1099
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:48,165
WHEN SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO SEE YOU RIGHT NOW.

1100
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,267
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE AMOUNT OF MAIL FOR CINDY?

1101
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,069
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
IT'S BECAUSE OF ME.

1102
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,271
NOW, I WANT TO SEE PAGE,
AND I WON'T BE TOLD NO.

1103
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,840
NO!

1104
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,084
PAGE?

1105
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,687
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1106
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,122
I NO LONGER
HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH CINDY'S COLUMN,

1107
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,691
SO YOU CAN
DELIVER IT TO IRIS--

1108
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:15,860
THIS IS ABOUT YOU
KISSING ME LAST NIGHT.

1109
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:17,562
ME?! YOU?

1110
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:19,229
I DID NOT.

1111
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,732
IT SURE TASTED LIKE YOU.

1112
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:23,901
YOU LEANED IN...

1113
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,903
AND I LOST
MY BALANCE.

1114
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:27,738
AND FELL ONTO MY FACE?

1115
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:32,009
IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE
ACCIDENT.

1116
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:33,644
I KNOW.
DON'T YOU JUST HATE IT

1117
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,312
WHEN TWO PEOPLE
ACCIDENTALLY CONNECT?

1118
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,848
PAGE, WHAT IS GOING ON?

1119
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,586
WELL, LET'S SEE.

1120
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:44,121
YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP,
THAT'S INFIDELITY.

1121
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:46,323
- ACTUALLY,
I CAME TO TELL YOU--
- I'M NOT FINISHED.

1122
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,259
YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER
WORKS FOR ME,

1123
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:50,795
THAT'S UNETHICAL.

1124
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:52,863
SHE'S BECOME
MY BIGGEST ASSET,

1125
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:54,264
THAT'S PLAIN FACT.

1126
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:56,266
IF YOU'D CHEAT ON HER,
YOU'D CHEAT ON ME,

1127
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,102
THAT'S COMMON SENSE.

1128
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,104
AND I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE THIS OFFICE,

1129
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:01,872
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

1130
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:05,075
NO, IT'S NOT.
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I HAVE TO TELL--

1131
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:07,277
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!
- STOP INTERRUPTING ME!

1132
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:13,984
CINDY IS NOT
WHO YOU THINK SHE IS.

1133
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:15,653
I KNOW.

1134
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:18,989
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

1135
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,991
THE LETTERS.

1136
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:23,594
YOU COULD TELL
FROM THE LETTERS?

1137
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:25,362
YES.

1138
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,265
NOW THEY'VE STARTED
WRITING ME.

1139
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,900
LISTEN TO THIS,

1140
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:32,236
"DEAR EDITOR, I WROTE
CINDY FOR ADVICE

1141
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,605
ON WHAT TO DO ABOUT
MY HUSBAND HITTING ME.

1142
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:38,075
SHE PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE
THE WAY NONE OF MY FAMILY
OR FRIENDS COULD.

1143
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,077
THEY ALL TOLD ME
TO SAVE MY MARRIAGE.

1144
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,146
CINDY TOLD ME
TO SAVE MYSELF.

1145
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,682
I GOT OUT,
THANKS TO HER.

1146
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:46,383
IF SHE HAS GIVEN
THIS GIFT TO ME,

1147
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,286
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW
SHE'S AFFECTED OTHERS.

1148
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,889
GOD BLESS
YOU AND CINDY."

1149
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:57,294
SHE IS NOT THE PERSON
WHO I THOUGHT SHE WAS-- AT ALL.

1150
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:00,631
CINDY HAS BECOME THE DIFFERENCE
IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.

1151
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,801
AND SHE SHOULD KNOW THAT.

1152
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:06,971
SHE DOES.

1153
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:11,108
I WON'T BE BOTHERING YOU,
ANYMORE, PAGE.

1154
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:16,313
I'LL HAVE CINDY EMAIL
HER COLUMN FROM NOW ON.

1155
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:45,342
CAN I HELP YOU?

1156
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,979
LUCY STONE, FOX NEWS,
"NEW YORK REPORT."

1157
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:52,182
- AND YOU ARE?
- WONDERING WHAT
YOU'RE DOING HERE.

1158
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:54,218
I JUST WANTED TO ASK
A FEW QUESTIONS

1159
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,954
TO THE WOMAN
THAT SEEMS TO HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS.

1160
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,388
CINDY DOESN'T DO
INTERVIEWS.

1161
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:00,224
SHE PREFERS TO KEEP
HER ANONYMITY.

1162
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,092
CAN I USE YOUR PHONE

1163
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:03,861
TO CHECK IN
WITH THE NEWSROOM?

1164
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:05,429
SURE.

1165
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:08,198
( lock clicks )

1166
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,740
IT'LL WAIT.
WE ONLY TRUST
SECURE LAND LINES.

1167
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:17,241
DO YOU MIND IF I
USE YOUR RESTROOM?

1168
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:20,377
IT'S BROKEN.
I CAN GIVE YOU A CUP.

1169
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,313
OKAY,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

1170
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:25,916
HERE IS MY CARD,
IN CASE SHE CHANGES
HER MIND

1171
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,985
WHEN SHE SEES
IT'S LUCY STONE.

1172
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,888
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST ONE
SHE CALLS, LUCY STONE.

1173
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:33,357
- AND AGAIN, YOU ARE?
- GONNA CLOSE THE DOOR NOW.

1174
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:37,327
Donald:
NO, NO, NO,
TELL HIM I'M BUSY.

1175
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,396
I HAVE NO TIME
TO TALK TO HIM NOW.

1176
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:42,767
IF WORSE COMES TO WORST,
I'LL CALL HIM TOMORROW
AT HIS OFFICE.

1177
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,268
CAN I HELP YOU?

1178
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:45,970
BYE-BYE.

1179
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:49,306
MS. HENSEN,

1180
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:51,909
I WAS HOPING WE
COULD HELP EACH OTHER.

1181
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:55,145
I BELIEVE THIS IS
MY DESK, MR. SIMPSON.

1182
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:58,248
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE
I'M ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF IT.

1183
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:00,150
WELL, FORGIVE ME.

1184
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:03,821
SO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

1185
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:07,825
YOU OWN MY COMPETITION,
AND I WOULDN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

1186
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:11,261
WHAT I DON'T KNOW
IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

1187
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:13,230
WELL, I--

1188
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:15,165
I HAVE A LITTLE
PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

1189
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:18,368
JUDGING BY
YOUR UNINVITED INTRUSION,

1190
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,337
I'M SURE
IT'S VERY LITTLE.

1191
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:24,875
YOU SEEM LIKE
A NO NONSENSE WOMAN,
AND I ADMIRE THAT.

1192
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:27,978
AT LEAST I KNOW I'M
DEALING WITH AN EQUAL.

1193
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:29,814
ANY WOMAN WHO ASPIRES

1194
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:31,782
TO BE EQUAL
TO MEN IN BUSINESS,

1195
01:02:31,816 --> 01:02:33,317
SIMPLY LACKS AMBITION.

1196
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:36,053
OKAY.

1197
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,188
HOW'S THIS
FOR AMBITION?

1198
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:40,224
I WANT TO BUY OUT
CINDY'S CONTRACT.

1199
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,026
CINDY'S NOT FOR SALE.

1200
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:44,461
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
THIS NEWSPAPER IS
LOSING MONEY.

1201
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,463
YOU CAN'T AFFORD
NOT TO SELL HER.

1202
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,401
WHEN I WANT SOMETHING,
MS. HENSEN,

1203
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,470
I USUALLY GET IT.

1204
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,373
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET IT,

1205
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:58,008
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1206
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:01,145
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

1207
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:10,888
NEVER WRESTLE
WITH A PIG, MS. HENSEN,

1208
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:12,522
YOU'LL BOTH GET DIRTY,

1209
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:14,458
ONLY THE PIG LIKES IT!

1210
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:17,928
AT LEAST I KNOW
WHAT SPECIES OF ANIMAL
I'M DEALING WITH.

1211
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:20,430
GOOD DAY, MR. SIMPSON.

1212
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:28,405
TV announcer:
This is "Fox 5, Live."

1213
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:31,909
- Live from lower Manhattan...
- DID I TELL YOU
I WAS AN EARLY RISER?

1214
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:33,310
COULD YOU HOLD ON?

1215
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:36,280
Lucy Stone:
Who is this advice columnist
who has the answers,

1216
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:39,884
but for some reason
chooses anonymity?

1217
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:43,587
New York is asking,
"Who is Cindy?"

1218
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:50,127
I ORDERED A SPECIAL MEAL,

1219
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,362
AND THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL
ABOUT THIS.

1220
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:55,332
I SHOULD BE ON YOUR LIST,
CINDY STYNE.

1221
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:58,268
THE CINDY STYNE?

1222
01:03:58,302 --> 01:03:59,904
YEAH. WHY?

1223
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:01,638
I LOVE YOUR COLUMN.

1224
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,540
YOU'VE READ MY COLUMN?

1225
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:06,276
I EVEN WROTE TO YOU.
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
ANSWERED IT YET.

1226
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:09,413
REALLY?
WAS YOUR LETTER STUPID?

1227
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:12,516
- PARDON?
- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE

1228
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:15,319
SOME OF THE RIDICULOUS LETTERS
I USED TO GET.

1229
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,054
IDIOTS OUT THERE.

1230
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:20,490
YOU KNOW,
SOMEHOW I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE DIFFERENT.

1231
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,326
NO. I'M THE SAME.

1232
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,129
Pilot:
This is your captain.
We're starting our descent

1233
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:27,597
into New York shortly.
And we up here in
the flight deck

1234
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,399
want to thank you
for flying with us.

1235
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:32,002
And we hope you have
a pleasant stay in New York,

1236
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:34,104
or whatever
your final destination.

1237
01:04:34,138 --> 01:04:35,672
( ringing )

1238
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,542
Witnesses reported to us that
they spotted Cindy Styne dining.

1239
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:41,278
OH, YOU HAVE TO GO?
WHAT A PITY.

1240
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:44,381
SO LONG, I'LL TALK
TO YOU AGAIN.

1241
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:45,349
OH!

1242
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,284
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1243
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:50,087
THE PHONES ARE
RINGING OFF THE HOOK.

1244
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,290
I'VE BEEN
ON THE PHONE SO MUCH,
I'M DEVELOPING A BICEP.

1245
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:55,292
BICEPS GO
THE OTHER WAY.

1246
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,461
OH. MATT LAUER
PERSONALLY CALLED.

1247
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:00,397
- I TALKED TO HIM.
- THIS IS INSANE.

1248
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,067
AND THE WIRE SERVICES CALLED

1249
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,170
TO TALK ABOUT
NATIONAL SYNDICATION!

1250
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:10,107
- THAT'S GREAT.
- I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

1251
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,076
FOR ME, BACK TO THE GRIND.

1252
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:14,478
- IRIS?
- OR NOT.

1253
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:18,949
LAST YEAR, WHEN YOU
GOT THAT HORRIFIC FLU,

1254
01:05:18,983 --> 01:05:20,584
HOW LONG WERE YOU OUT?

1255
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:23,287
INCLUDING
THE DAYS I LIED...

1256
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,990
AND WENT TO CLUB MED,

1257
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:27,992
ABOUT TWO AND A HALF WEEKS.

1258
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:29,526
BUT I GOT SICK THERE.

1259
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:34,098
I'VE BEEN IGNORING
MY INTUITION.

1260
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:36,400
I'M GOING
TO GO SEE CINDY.

1261
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,668
PAGE,
IS THAT WISE?

1262
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:41,038
LET ME
REPHRASE THAT,

1263
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:43,140
THAT'S NOT WISE.

1264
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:45,309
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

1265
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:47,277
ALMOST DAILY.

1266
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:54,218
( knocking )

1267
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:56,220
WHO IS IT?

1268
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:58,422
IT'S PAGE.

1269
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,357
SHIT!

1270
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,492
I HEARD THAT, RYAN.
OPEN THE DOOR!

1271
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:08,098
( knocking )

1272
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:10,234
I'M IN THE SHOWER.

1273
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,670
I NEED TO TALK TO CINDY.

1274
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,273
( knocking )

1275
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,275
NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

1276
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:20,710
OPEN THE DOOR!

1277
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:26,616
SHE'S NOT HERE.

1278
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,418
WHERE IS SHE?

1279
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:31,755
THE MEDIA'S
BEEN HOUNDING US.

1280
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:35,392
SHE COULDN'T GET
ANY REST SO I SENT HER
TO A PRIVATE HOSPITAL.

1281
01:06:35,425 --> 01:06:38,562
I LOOKED UP THE DOCTOR
YOU SAID WAS CINDY'S PHYSICIAN.

1282
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:40,430
HE'S A PLASTIC SURGEON.

1283
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,133
RIGHT.

1284
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:44,601
I WANT THE TRUTH.

1285
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,238
THE TRUTH IS...

1286
01:06:48,272 --> 01:06:50,507
DR. SHERMAN
IS A PLASTIC SURGEON.

1287
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:54,178
AND HE WASN'T
TREATING CINDY FOR THE FLU.

1288
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:56,680
KEEP TALKING.

1289
01:06:56,713 --> 01:06:59,383
WHAT HAPPENED IS...

1290
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,719
CINDY'S BREAST IMPLANTS--
SHE HAS THEM, YOU KNOW?

1291
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:05,489
THEY SHIFTED SO RADICALLY,
THAT SHE BECAME...

1292
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:08,292
FRONTALLY DISFIGURED,

1293
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:10,494
A ONE BREASTED HUNCHBACK.

1294
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:15,332
IT WAS LIKE TALKING
TO A PICASSO IN CHANEL.

1295
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,767
- OH MY GOD--
- YEAH, IT WAS TERRIBLE.

1296
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,536
YOU MUST THINK
I'M A COMPLETE IDIOT.

1297
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:21,538
I DON'T,
BUT IF YOU FEEL I MUST--

1298
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:23,340
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING, RYAN,

1299
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,609
I CAN SPOT BULLSHIT
FROM A BLIMP IN A FOGSTORM.

1300
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:27,377
NOW WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?

1301
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,114
OH GOD.

1302
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:38,088
THE REAL TRUTH IS...

1303
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:40,590
CINDY WENT TO BRAZIL.

1304
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,359
- RYAN!
- NO, LISTEN!

1305
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:45,295
THREE MONTHS AGO,
I WAS A GREAT LIAR,

1306
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:47,397
WITH A GREAT JOB,
WHICH I LOST.

1307
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:49,199
SO CINDY LEFT ME.

1308
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:51,735
I COULDN'T FIND ANOTHER JOB
SO I TOOK HERS.

1309
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,472
YOU TOOK C--

1310
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,541
WAIT A MINUTE--

1311
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:01,245
YOU'VE BEEN ILLEGALLY
IMPERSONATING CINDY?

1312
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:04,414
PERPETUATING A HOAX

1313
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,850
AND LYING TO MY FACE?

1314
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:09,586
IT SOUNDS A LOT WORSE
WHEN YOU SAY IT.

1315
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:15,125
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS
OF THIS?

1316
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:16,893
YES, I AM A FRAUD.

1317
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,729
THERE WILL BE
A HUGE SCANDAL, RYAN!

1318
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:22,132
THE PAPERS
WILL CRUCIFY ME--

1319
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,733
NO-- WAIT--
I AM A PAPER.

1320
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,569
I'LL HAVE TO
CRUCIFY MYSELF.

1321
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,338
- I WANTED
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
- THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU?

1322
01:08:28,372 --> 01:08:30,740
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW I WAS A FRAUD.

1323
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:33,477
AND I NEEDED A REASON
TO KEEP SEEING YOU.

1324
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:36,346
YOU'RE THE FIRST WOMAN
THAT'S MADE ME

1325
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,482
CARE ABOUT SOMETHING
OTHER THAN MYSELF.

1326
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,450
OH, PLEASE!

1327
01:08:40,484 --> 01:08:43,387
ADD THAT TO YOUR LIST
OF LIES AND DECEPTION.

1328
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:47,257
EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID
TO ME HAS BEEN A LIE.

1329
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:50,126
IS THERE ANYTHING, AT ALL,
ABOUT YOU THAT'S TRUE?

1330
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:54,531
JUST... THE STUFF
YOU PRINTED.

1331
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:01,738
I AM SO OUT OF HERE.

1332
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:03,407
I LOVE YOU.

1333
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:08,545
THE HARDEST PART ABOUT THIS
WAS NOT BEING ABLE
TO TELL YOU.

1334
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:10,347
OR KISS YOU.

1335
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,351
YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULD LET YOU KISS ME?

1336
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:16,386
AFTER THIS?!

1337
01:09:17,554 --> 01:09:19,356
HOW CLICHE IS THAT?

1338
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,191
WHAT? "PASSION
OVERTAKES THEM"?

1339
01:09:21,225 --> 01:09:23,327
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DEALING WITH HERE?

1340
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:27,231
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST LOVE YOU.

1341
01:09:28,365 --> 01:09:34,904
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING...

1342
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:37,941
CINDY,
WHERE DO YOU SEE
THE COLUMN GOING?

1343
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:40,577
- CINDY, WHY THE SECRECY?
- Where have you been hiding?

1344
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,479
What the hell
is going on?

1345
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,481
( reporters clamoring )

1346
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,483
GET MY CAR.

1347
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,354
HURRY!

1348
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:52,522
HURRY?
YOU NEVER WANTED
ME TO HURRY BEFORE.

1349
01:09:52,556 --> 01:09:54,658
BEFORE MY TEMPERATURE
GOES DOWN.

1350
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,427
STOP COMPLAINING,
YOU ALWAYS WANTED A NOONER.

1351
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:59,696
YEAH,
BUT WHAT'S THE RUSH
TO HAVE CHILDREN?

1352
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:02,466
CINDY'S HAVING ONE, SO--
( kissing )

1353
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:04,901
- IT GOT ME THINKING.
- CINDY'S IN BRAZIL.

1354
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:09,306
- CINDY'S IN BRAZIL?!
- WHAT? NO, I MEAN--

1355
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,242
CINDY'S BRA IS CHILLED.
LET'S MAKE BABIES.

1356
01:10:12,276 --> 01:10:13,810
OKAY.

1357
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:18,982
OOOH!

1358
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:21,418
- ( grunts )
- OWWW!

1359
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:24,354
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- IT'S THE YOGA.

1360
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:27,591
IT FAMILIARIZES ME WITH MUSCLES
I NEVER EVEN KNEW I HAD.

1361
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:30,994
I-I CAN'T MOVE THE--
OH MY GOD! MY--

1362
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:32,396
EXACTLY.

1363
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:34,398
NOW TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1364
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:36,366
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!
I SWEAR!

1365
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,368
OK-AAAY.

1366
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:40,270
TALK!

1367
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:42,372
( screaming )

1368
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:44,040
FEEL THE LOVE!

1369
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,410
OKAY, OKAY!
I'LL TALK! I'LL TALK!

1370
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:51,348
Ryan:
SO?

1371
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:54,451
HAVE I REDEEMED MYSELF?

1372
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,521
Page:
ALMOST.

1373
01:10:58,522 --> 01:11:00,324
KEEP TRYING.

1374
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:13,503
YOU ARE
AN AMAZING WOMAN.

1375
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:17,541
APPARENTLY,
SO ARE YOU.

1376
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,910
WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT THIS,
BESIDES YOU AND--

1377
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:23,680
CLEARLY-- IRIS?

1378
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:25,449
MY FRIEND, BARRY.

1379
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:27,451
BUT I TRUST HIM.

1380
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:30,754
EVENTUALLY,
SOMEONE'S GOING
TO FIND OUT.

1381
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:33,423
HOW IS ANYONE
GOING TO FIND OUT?

1382
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,024
( keys jangling )

1383
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:48,338
CINDY?

1384
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:50,674
WELCOME HOME.

1385
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:53,042
RYAN!

1386
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:55,745
I HAVE BEEN TO HELL
WITHOUT A SUNBLOCK.

1387
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,414
IT WAS AWFUL!

1388
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,883
BRAZIL HAS NO
AIR CONDITIONING,

1389
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,051
MOSQUITOES THE SIZE
OF PREMATURE BABIES,

1390
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:04,854
AND NOBO SPEAKS
A REAL LANGUAGE.

1391
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:07,524
AND THEN, RYAN,
WHEN I GOT OFF
THE PLANE,

1392
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:10,126
I WAS TOTALLY
ATTACKED BY PAPARAZZI,

1393
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,462
LIKE A CELEBRITY.
WHAT IS GOING ON?

1394
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:18,101
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

1395
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,838
IN A NUTSHELL,

1396
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:23,673
YOU LEFT,
MY LIFE COLLAPSED.

1397
01:12:23,707 --> 01:12:25,742
I SAID YOU WERE SICK,
TOOK OVER YOUR COLUMN.

1398
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:27,677
IT TOOK OFF,
YOU BECAME FAMOUS.

1399
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:30,380
THE COLUMN TOOK OFF,
AND YOU'VE BEEN
WRITING IT?

1400
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:31,381
YOU'VE BEEN ME?

1401
01:12:31,415 --> 01:12:34,418
- ACTUALLY, I'VE--
- DID YOU KNOW HE WAS ME?

1402
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:36,386
I DIDN'T THEN.
BUT I DO NOW.

1403
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,392
SO... YOU'VE BEEN ME,

1404
01:12:42,426 --> 01:12:44,093
WHILE DOING HER,

1405
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:45,695
YOU USED TO DO ME,

1406
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:47,363
BUT NOW YOU ARE ME?

1407
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:49,999
MAYBE?

1408
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:52,035
WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

1409
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:54,103
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT LEFT ME.

1410
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:56,773
RYAN, I HAVE AN INNOCENT,

1411
01:12:56,806 --> 01:13:00,510
LITTLE AFFAIR IN BRAZIL,

1412
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:02,779
AND YOU NOT ONLY
STEAL MY JOB,

1413
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:04,748
YOU SLEEP
WITH MY BOSS?

1414
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:06,483
( footsteps )

1415
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:07,917
OH MY GOD!

1416
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:10,019
YOU'RE ALIVE!

1417
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,589
- RYAN'S BEEN WRITING
YOUR COLUMN!
- I KNOW.

1418
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:14,958
HE'S TELLING EVERYONE
THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR DEATHBED.

1419
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:16,493
I KNOW.

1420
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:18,862
- HE'S ALSO HAVING
AN AFFAIR.
- I KNOW.

1421
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:22,065
NO OFFENSE, CIN, BUT YOU'RE
BURSTING MY BUBBLEBUTT, HERE.

1422
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:24,834
ISN'T IT HIGHER?

1423
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:26,703
MUCH.

1424
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,438
( Barry panting )
RYAN...

1425
01:13:28,472 --> 01:13:30,707
RYAN, I'M SO SORRY.

1426
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:34,143
CATHY USED
HER SEXUAL WEB TO MAKE
ME SPILL EVERYTHING.

1427
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:37,514
- HEY!
- OH! OH.

1428
01:13:37,547 --> 01:13:38,948
OH, NOT GOOD.

1429
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:41,985
THIS MUST BE THE FRIEND
YOU CAN TRUST.

1430
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:44,621
PAGE, BARRY.
BARRY, PAGE.

1431
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:46,189
PAGE, CATHY.
CATHY, PAGE.

1432
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:48,458
AND YOU ALL KNOW CINDY.

1433
01:13:48,492 --> 01:13:49,993
MMM, THE VICTIM.

1434
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:51,461
I THINK EVERYBODY
SHOULD LEAVE.

1435
01:13:51,495 --> 01:13:54,230
CINDY AND I HAVE
SOME TALKING TO DO.

1436
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,565
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

1437
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:58,468
I'M MAD AT YOU!
AND CINDY NEEDS ME.

1438
01:13:58,502 --> 01:14:00,804
I THOUGHT WE'D
GO TO BERGDORF'S
ON THE WAY HOME.

1439
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:03,139
CALL ME.

1440
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:13,182
RIGHT. UH, WELL...
I SHOULD BE GOING TOO.

1441
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,719
YEAH, AND LEAVE
THE SHEET.

1442
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:17,621
I'LL GET MY STUFF OUT
TOMORROW.

1443
01:14:17,654 --> 01:14:19,923
NO! HER, LEAVE.
YOU...

1444
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,926
I FORGIVE. EVENTUALLY.

1445
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:26,596
CINDY, I'M IN LOVE
WITH PAGE.

1446
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,865
( laughing )
PLEASE!

1447
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:31,000
YOU DON'T EVEN
LIKE SMART WOMEN.

1448
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:34,003
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON.
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN LIKE ME.

1449
01:14:34,037 --> 01:14:37,507
YOU'LL MEET SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU'RE YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE...

1450
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:39,909
VULNERABLE,
EMOTIONALLY UNAVAILABLE...

1451
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:42,111
EVERYTHING A MAN LOOKS FOR
IN A WOMAN, JUST--

1452
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:43,913
NOT THIS MAN.

1453
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:48,084
MMM, FINE THEN.

1454
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:49,753
WELL, NOW THERE, SEE?

1455
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:51,821
I KNEW THAT WE COULD
ALL BE UNDERSTANDING,

1456
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:54,724
- AND AMICABLE, AND--
- I WANT MY JOB BACK,

1457
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:57,627
AT QUADRUPLE MY OLD SALARY,
AND WHAT USED TO BE
YOUR OFFICE.

1458
01:14:57,661 --> 01:14:59,863
--AND COMPLETELY
IRRATIONAL.

1459
01:14:59,896 --> 01:15:02,231
CINDY, NO.
THIS COLUMN IS

1460
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:04,200
TOO IMPORTANT
TO TOO MANY LIVES.

1461
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:06,235
TOO BAD. I'M TIRED.

1462
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:08,237
SO YOU TWO HAVE ABOUT
A SECOND TO DECIDE,

1463
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:11,240
OR I GO RIGHT NOW
TO NBC NEWS, "LIVE AT 6:00."

1464
01:15:12,676 --> 01:15:14,210
TICK-TOCK OVER HERE.

1465
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,614
YOU CAN'T HAVE
THE COLUMN BACK.

1466
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:20,216
FINE.

1467
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:23,687
WATCH ME ON TV.

1468
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,922
I'LL BE LIVE AT 6:00.
YOU'LL BE DEAD BY 6:30.

1469
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:31,160
THAT WENT WELL.

1470
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:39,268
EXCUSE ME, MS. STYNE.

1471
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:40,837
( sighs )
WHAT?

1472
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,072
A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME,
IF I MAY?

1473
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:46,109
I DON'T TALK TO
UNATTRACTIVE STRANGERS.

1474
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,213
IS THAT YOUR ROLLS?

1475
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:52,982
YES, I'M DONALD SIMPSON.

1476
01:15:53,016 --> 01:15:57,120
AND I OWN "THE NEW YORK
CHRONICLE" AS WELL AS
32 OTHER PAPERS.

1477
01:15:57,153 --> 01:16:00,256
AND I'D LIKE YOUR COLUMN
"CINDY-CATED" ACROSS
THE COUNTRY.

1478
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,091
YOU SHOULD KNOW,
I'M NOT THE ONE--

1479
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,693
I'M OFFERING
SIX FIGURES A YEAR.

1480
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:05,995
- BUT YOU KNOW--
- PLUS AN EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

1481
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:09,933
- KEEP TALKING.
- HOW ABOUT A COMPANY CAR?

1482
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:13,302
LIKE A MERCEDES SL-ANYTHING?

1483
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,740
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SIGN SOME PAPERS.

1484
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:21,310
- SHE'S BLUFFING.
- SHE'S NOT BLUFFING.

1485
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:25,314
YOU'RE RIGHT,
SHE'S NOT BLUFFING.

1486
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:27,350
GO AFTER HER.
SHE'S NOT BLUFFING.

1487
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:30,319
- IS THIS FOR REAL?
- ABSOLUTELY.

1488
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:38,828
Ryan:
CINDY!

1489
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:51,007
WHAT'S WRONG WITH US?

1490
01:16:54,077 --> 01:16:55,679
I DON'T KNOW.

1491
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,382
WE SHOULD BE UPSET.

1492
01:17:00,684 --> 01:17:02,886
THINGS COULDN'T
BE WORSE.

1493
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,322
THEN WHY AM I
SO HAPPY?

1494
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:10,093
WELL, BECAUSE YOU
FINALLY GOT ME INTO BED?

1495
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,395
WELL, THERE'S THAT.

1496
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:16,199
IF ALL THIS HAPPENED
SO THE TWO OF US

1497
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,668
COULD BE TOGETHER,
THEN IT WAS WORTH IT.

1498
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:25,374
WE MAY BE SCREWED,
BUT WE'RE SCREWED TOGETHER.

1499
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:27,310
LOOK ON
THE BRIGHT SIDE,

1500
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:30,313
TOMORROW MORNING
WHEN WE WAKE UP,

1501
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:32,716
WE GET THE UNFORTUNATE
PLEASURE

1502
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:35,318
OF WATCHING SIMPSON
ANNOUNCE HIS VICTORY
ON TV.

1503
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:38,221
AND IF I KNOW CINDY,

1504
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:40,223
SHE'LL BE RIGHT THERE
WITH HIM,

1505
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:42,325
GLOATING.

1506
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:48,031
I DON'T EVEN CARE.

1507
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:51,000
HOW ABOUT YOU?

1508
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:56,706
( cash register rings )

1509
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:01,044
CINDY...

1510
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,203
I NEED YOUR HELP.

1511
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,173
OF COURSE YOU DO.

1512
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,209
I CAN INJECT
SOME OF THE FAT

1513
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:35,044
I TOOK FROM CATHY'S ASS

1514
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:38,081
INTO IT-- IT'LL GIVE YOU
AT LEAST AN EXTRA TWO INCHES.

1515
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:40,216
- BARRY, WAKE UP!
- WHAT? WHAT?

1516
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:42,251
I NEED 200 GRAND,
AND I NEED IT NOW.

1517
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:45,889
MMM-MMM-MMM.

1518
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,224
- NO.
- NO?

1519
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:50,426
NO.

1520
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,395
RYAN...

1521
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:54,764
YOU'RE A BAD STOCKBROKER.

1522
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:57,166
SEE, YOU LOSE
PEOPLE'S MONEY.

1523
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,002
I'M NOT A STOCKBROKER
ANYMORE.

1524
01:18:59,035 --> 01:19:01,204
EXACTLY, I'M NOT GIVING
MY MONEY TO A...

1525
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:02,939
FEMALE COLUMNIST.

1526
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:06,109
- I'M NOT A FEMALE.
- YOU COULD BE.

1527
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:09,345
BARRY,
YOU GOTTA HELP ME.

1528
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:11,881
- NO, I CAN'T-- NO.
- BARRY, I GOT NOWHERE
ELSE TO GO!

1529
01:19:11,915 --> 01:19:13,917
- IT'S TOO MUCH!
- I GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

1530
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,819
BESIDES, RYAN,
ALL MY MONEY'S TIED UP.

1531
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:20,456
WHAT ABOUT
CATHY'S MONEY?

1532
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:23,326
OKAY.

1533
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,963
- REALLY?
- WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

1534
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:32,368
LOOKS GOOD
FOR THE LAST ISSUE.

1535
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,171
WELL, WELL.

1536
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:38,007
YOU USUALLY
SNEAK OUT OF BED

1537
01:19:38,041 --> 01:19:40,009
AND LEAVE A WOMAN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

1538
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:41,878
YOU CALLED?

1539
01:19:41,911 --> 01:19:44,080
I'M SORRY.
BUT LAST NIGHT
I CAME UP WITH

1540
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:46,415
AN IDEA THAT COULD
SAVE YOUR PAPER.

1541
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:49,218
- HOW?
- BEATING SIMPSON
AT HIS OWN GAME.

1542
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:52,288
IF I CAN GET 200 GRAND,
I CAN TURN IT INTO
MILLIONS.

1543
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:55,224
I BORROWED 50.
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE?

1544
01:19:55,258 --> 01:19:58,227
SHE HAS NOTHING.

1545
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:00,864
LESS THAN NOTHING.
IF YOU COUNT INTEREST.

1546
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:04,100
DAMN IT. WHERE AM I GOING
TO GET MY HANDS ON 150 GRAND?

1547
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,601
HERE'S MY CHECKBOOK.

1548
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,837
IRIS, NO.
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.

1549
01:20:09,072 --> 01:20:10,974
YOU HAVE 150 GRAND?

1550
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,509
- IN ONE OF MY ACCOUNTS.
- SHE'S LOADED.

1551
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,879
I'M A GREAT HOUSEKEEPER.
THREE DIVORCES--

1552
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:17,947
I KEPT EVERY HOUSE.

1553
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:21,084
- SHE JUST WORKS HERE FOR FUN.
- OR UNTIL I FIND MY--

1554
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:23,086
- ( check rips )
- NEXT HUSBAND.

1555
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,989
IRIS, I'LL PAY YOU BACK.

1556
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:27,590
OH, I DON'T WANT IT BACK.

1557
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:29,425
I JUST WANT A PIECE.

1558
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,028
IRIS!

1559
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:34,530
I WANT PART OWNERSHIP
OF WHATEVER HE HAS PLANNED,

1560
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:37,266
OR I'LL CASH
ALL MY PAYCHECKS,

1561
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,235
AND BREAK YOU.

1562
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:42,071
I COULDN'T THINK
OF A BETTER PARTNER.

1563
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:45,274
OH, NO!

1564
01:20:45,308 --> 01:20:47,643
IT'S PAINFULLY CLEAR
THAT YOU'VE BEEN USING ME

1565
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:51,480
- TO GET TO HER.
- AND YOU MAPPED OUT
A VERY DIRECT ROUTE.

1566
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:54,450
BUT-- I HAVE, IT SEEMS,

1567
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:57,486
FOUND CONSOLATION
IN THE ARMS OF ANOTHER MAN.

1568
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:00,323
A YOUNGER MAN!

1569
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:03,126
WHOEVER HE IS,
HE'S A LUCKY MAN, TOO.

1570
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:05,261
YOU BET YOUR ASS!

1571
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:07,296
( chattering )

1572
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:12,268
ANDY,
HOW ARE YOU?

1573
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:13,369
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1574
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,972
WILLY,
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1575
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:18,141
- HEY, DORIS.
- HEY, RYAN.

1576
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:19,408
HELLO.

1577
01:21:19,442 --> 01:21:21,377
EXCUSE ME.
CAN I HELP YOU?

1578
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,246
I DON'T THINK SO,
BUT THANK YOU.

1579
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,015
WELL, WELL.

1580
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:28,017
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
TURNER?

1581
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:30,920
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
LIVING OFF YOUR FAMOUS
GIRLFRIEND.

1582
01:21:30,954 --> 01:21:34,057
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID YOUR WIFE
WAS MODERATELY ATTRACTIVE?

1583
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:36,292
YEAH.

1584
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:37,393
I LIED.

1585
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:40,263
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

1586
01:21:42,165 --> 01:21:44,200
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR A JOB?

1587
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:47,236
TABLES ARE
ABOUT TO TURN, CARL.

1588
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,011
RYAN! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

1589
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:57,413
- YOU'RE LOOKING
AT YOUR NEW CLIENT.
- WHAT?

1590
01:21:57,446 --> 01:22:00,416
I WANT TO BUY 50,000 SHARES
OF SIMPSON PUBLISHING.

1591
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,518
NOW.

1592
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:05,054
Cathy: I TOLD YOU,
NO INVESTMENTS.

1593
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:07,256
WE'RE RUINED.
RUINED.

1594
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:09,325
BYE-BYE,
DESIGNER CLOTHES.

1595
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:11,360
NOW, I'LL HAVE TO SHOP
ON CANAL STREET.

1596
01:22:11,394 --> 01:22:13,362
BYE-BYE TO OUR VACATION.
YOU PROMISED ME

1597
01:22:13,396 --> 01:22:16,299
YOU WOULD TAKE ME TO EGYPT
TO SEE THAT GIANT SPHINCTER.

1598
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:17,700
WHAT ABOUT
OUR MORTGAGE, HUH?

1599
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:19,702
BYE-BYE,
DOORMAN, CO-OP.

1600
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:22,405
WE'LL END UP LIVING
IN A REFRIGERATOR CARTON,

1601
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,974
WEARING KLEENEX BOXES
FOR BEDROOM SLIPPERS,

1602
01:22:25,008 --> 01:22:27,276
AND SNATCHING PIGEONS
FOR A LITTLE PROTEIN,

1603
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:29,445
PRAYING FOR RAIN
SO WE CAN SHOWER.

1604
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:32,248
AND IF YOU THINK
I'M SELLING MY JEWELRY,

1605
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,983
YOU'VE GOT
ANOTHER THING COMING.

1606
01:22:34,017 --> 01:22:35,618
AND LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING ELSE,

1607
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:38,021
MR. BEST FRIEND!

1608
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:40,689
I HOPE YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS
OF SOME VERY GOOD HOOKERS,

1609
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:43,426
BECAUSE MY LEGS
ARE SHUT.

1610
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,394
DO YOU HEAR ME?!

1611
01:22:45,428 --> 01:22:47,296
WELDED.

1612
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:52,201
( door slams )

1613
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:56,505
YEAH--

1614
01:22:56,539 --> 01:22:59,342
AND AN EGG ROLL.

1615
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:01,410
YEAH, "WELDED."

1616
01:23:01,444 --> 01:23:03,712
I'LL BRING YOU TO THE MIKE,
AND YOU'LL SAY HOW HAPPY

1617
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:06,449
YOU ARE TO BE PART OF
THE SIMPSON PUBLISHING EMPIRE,

1618
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:08,451
- I'LL TAKE OVER FROM THERE.
- YEAH, WHATEVER!

1619
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,286
- HOW DO I LOOK?
- LIKE GOLD.

1620
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,787
( gasps )

1621
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,422
OH.

1622
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:17,193
DONNY-- OH!

1623
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,363
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1624
01:23:21,564 --> 01:23:23,266
Ryan:
A POPULAR COLUMNIST

1625
01:23:23,299 --> 01:23:25,268
MAY BE DEFECTING
TO ANOTHER PAPER.

1626
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:26,435
WHO? WHEN?

1627
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:28,704
ABOUT AN HOUR IS ALL
I CAN LEGALLY SAY,

1628
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:30,706
BUT YOU CAN DO THE REST
SINCE YOU ARE--

1629
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,441
LUCY STONE.

1630
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:35,478
THANK YOU, JIM.

1631
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:37,546
Lucy:
And here in New York,

1632
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,582
reliable sources
tell me that

1633
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:43,186
everyone's favorite advice
columnist may be a free agent.

1634
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:46,222
Could that be what today's
press conference is about?

1635
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:48,691
Woman:
OVER HERE.
THAT'S THE CAR, BOYS.

1636
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:51,294
STAND BACK.
STAND BACK.

1637
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:52,528
Man:
MR. SIMPSON.

1638
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:54,530
MR. SIMPSON, CAN YOU
CONFIRM THE RUMORS?

1639
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:55,664
PLEASE, SIR?

1640
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:58,167
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
CINDY STYNE.

1641
01:23:58,201 --> 01:24:00,369
Woman:
WILL YOU BE LEAVING
"THE JOURNAL"?

1642
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:02,138
- NO COMMENT NOW.
- NO COMMENT.

1643
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:04,107
Man:
CINDY,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

1644
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,408
NO COMMENT ON THAT,
EITHER.

1645
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:07,210
Woman #2:
TELL US ABOUT THE DRESS.

1646
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:09,345
The dress?
I had it made.

1647
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:12,415
Woman:
Rumors that popular
columnist Cindy Styne

1648
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:15,218
might be defecting
to the "New York Chronicle"

1649
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:17,453
has sent Simpson's stocks
up eight points.

1650
01:24:17,486 --> 01:24:19,155
NOW WHAT?

1651
01:24:19,188 --> 01:24:21,357
LET'S GO WATCH
A VICTORY.

1652
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:24,360
Donald:
SO, WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY
CONCLUDED

1653
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,329
AN EXCLUSIVE
FIVE YEAR CONTRACT.

1654
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:28,231
AND AFTER LENGTHY
NEGOTIATIONS,

1655
01:24:28,264 --> 01:24:31,234
I'M VERY PLEASED
TO ANNOUNCE

1656
01:24:31,267 --> 01:24:33,736

1658
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:39,108
AMY, GET READY.

1659
01:24:39,142 --> 01:24:41,444
RYAN, IT'S GOING UP SO FAST,
THE TICKER CAN'T KEEP UP!

1660
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:43,446
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

1661
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:45,448
LET ME INTRODUCE
OUR NEW CHRONICLE GIRL,

1662
01:24:45,481 --> 01:24:47,583
Ms. Cindy Styne.

1663
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:49,385
CINDY.

1664
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:50,753
AMY?

1665
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:53,289
- How much is it up?
- 30 POINTS!

1666
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:54,557
HAH!

1667
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:55,858
WE JUST MADE
A MILLION FIVE.

1668
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,295
- THANK-- OOH.
- ( feed back )

1669
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,130
- THANK YOU, DONNY.
- SELL.

1670
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:02,765
Sell.

1671
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:05,234
- YOU'RE OUT.
- Good.

1672
01:25:05,268 --> 01:25:07,470
- NICE MOVE.
- ( cheering )

1673
01:25:07,503 --> 01:25:09,172
Cindy:
I'M EXCITED TO BE PART

1674
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:11,407
OF THE SIMPSON
PUBLISHING FAMILY.

1675
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,342
- THANK YOU, CIN--
- AND--

1676
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:17,613
EXCUSE ME.
AND--

1677
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:20,483
THINGS ARE GONNA BE
DIFFERENT FROM NOW ON.

1678
01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:22,785
TAKE IT ALL,
AND SELL IT SHORT.

1679
01:25:22,818 --> 01:25:23,919
ARE YOU SURE?

1680
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:26,489
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- TRUST ME.

1681
01:25:26,522 --> 01:25:28,391
I USED TO BE
PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.

1682
01:25:29,392 --> 01:25:32,361
I'M BETTING THAT SIMPSON
IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN.

1683
01:25:32,395 --> 01:25:35,164
...'CAUSE MY LIFE HAS
BEEN A LIVING HELL.

1684
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:37,666
SEE, IT WASN'T ME
WRITING MY COLUMN.

1685
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,403
I WAS IN BRAZIL.

1686
01:25:40,436 --> 01:25:41,270
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN?

1687
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:43,406
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
- DON'T BOTHER.

1688
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:44,807
Cindy:
It was an impostor,

1689
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:48,244
my ex-boyfriend
forging my advice.

1690
01:25:48,277 --> 01:25:49,378
( guffaws )

1691
01:25:49,412 --> 01:25:51,447
BUT I AM BACK NOW,

1692
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,550
SO NO MORE OF THAT
PSEUDO-SENSITIVE CRAP.

1693
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:56,419
- FROM NOW ON--
- THANK YOU, CINDY!

1694
01:25:56,452 --> 01:25:58,187
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1695
01:25:58,221 --> 01:25:59,922
MS. STYNE'S HUMOR
IS ONE OF THE REASONS

1696
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:02,658
THE SIMPSON PUBLISHING
COMPANY IS FORTUNATE
TO HAVE HER.

1697
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:05,394
- LET'S GLOAT.
- LET'S.

1698
01:26:05,428 --> 01:26:07,630
THIS CONFERENCE
IS OVER.

1699
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:10,199
HEY! WE GOT
A NEW BREAKING STORY.

1700
01:26:10,233 --> 01:26:11,867
MR. SIMPSON?

1701
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,503
CONGRATULATIONS.
SHE'S ALL YOURS.

1702
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:17,540
DONALD.

1703
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:20,776
WHEN YOU'RE SCREWED,
YOU'RE SCREWED.

1704
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,883
COME ON!

1705
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:29,885
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

1706
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,920
I COULD EAT.

1707
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:35,491
WE MADE HOW MUCH?

1708
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,926
WELL, YOU MADE...

1709
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,362
IT WAS YOUR MONEY.

1710
01:26:39,395 --> 01:26:41,897
OH! WHA--

1711
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:43,899
( sighing )

1712
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,934
( unzipping )

1713
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:48,771
( groans )

1714
01:26:48,804 --> 01:26:50,406
I HAVE NO IDEA.

1715
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:52,375
Secretary:
I'M SORRY,
HE'S IN A MEETING

1716
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:54,277
Cindy:
DON'T START WITH ME.

1717
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,512
DONNY!

1718
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:58,814
I NEED SOME HELP!

1719
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:01,484
( sighs )

1720
01:27:01,517 --> 01:27:04,553
* LOOKS SO GOOD...

1721
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:07,423
( giggling )

1722
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:08,491
WHOA!

1723
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:10,993
* FEEL YOUR LOVE...

1724
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:13,929
- HONEY?
- YEAH?

1725
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:16,999
IS MY TUMMY GONNA LOOK
ALL RIGHT AFTER THIS?

1726
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:19,635
LIKE YOUR NEW ASS...
BUT FLAT...

1727
01:27:19,668 --> 01:27:21,637
AND NO CRACK.

1728
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,872
( whimpering )

1729
01:27:25,508 --> 01:27:26,975
"DEAR RYAN,

1730
01:27:27,009 --> 01:27:30,513
I WANT TO PROPOSE TO

1731
01:27:30,546 --> 01:27:32,781
BUT I'D LIKE TO DO IT
IN A SURPRISING WAY.

1732
01:27:32,815 --> 01:27:34,383
ANY ADVICE?

1733
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:36,852
SIGNED...

1734
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:39,522

1735
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,696
HI.

1736
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,698
- ARE YOU READY TO GO YET?
- YEAH.

1737
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:51,500
AS SOON AS YOU
APPROVE THIS.

1738
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:53,836
OKAY.

1739
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,940
( silent )

1740
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,282
( gasps )

1741
01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:09,785
REALLY?!

1742
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:11,820
( screams )

1743
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:19,027
