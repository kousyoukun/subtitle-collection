<i>( woman moans )</i>

Woman:
<i>OH MY GOD, DON'T DO THAT.</i>

3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,486
Man:
<i>DON'T DO-- THIS?</i>

4
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:24,024
<i>YES!</i>
<i>DON'T DO THAT SOME MORE.</i>

<i>TELL ME.</i>

00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,762
<i>OR I WON'T DO THIS.</i>

00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,697
<i>OKAY.</i>

8
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,934
ALL I KNOW IS HE'S IN D.C.
BUYING SOME COMPANY.

9
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,703
DON'T STOP!

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,872
<i>NO.  I'M STOPPING.</i>

11
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,574
<i>WHICH COMPANY?</i>

12
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,877
RYAN, IF I WANTED
TO TALK BUSINESS,
I'D HAVE SEX WITH MY HUSBAND.

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,115
WHICH COMPANY?

14
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,250
  <i>( phone rings,</i>
<i>machine picks up )</i>

15
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,386
Hi, Donald and Veronica
     can't come--

16
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,788
- <i>( machine beeps </i>

 <i>Call me when</i>

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,796
<i>I was about to hang up.</i>
     <i>Whatcha doing?</i>

21
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,232
        UH...
HAVING MY NAILS DONE.

22
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:08,435
   <i>I wanted to tell you</i>
<i>my plane's landing in an hour.</i>

  <i>then we'll go to dinner.</i>
- OKAY.

24
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,075
LISTEN, SWEETIE,
I GOTTA RUN.

25
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,944
   MY MANICURIST IS
GIVING ME DIRTY LOOKS.

26
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,346
- I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.
- <i>All right, talk to you then.</i>

27
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,382
I GOTTA RUN, TOO.

28
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,085
WHY?!  WE HAVE ALL AFTERNOON.
   DONALD'S PLAYING GOLF.

29
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,187
       I KNOW.
I'M PLAYING WITH HIM.

30
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,255
WHAT?!

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,996
   LET'S HEAD
FOR LONG ISLAND.

32
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,508
BEAUTIFUL SHOT!

33
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,645
200 YARDS.
RIGHT AT THE FLAG.

34
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,213
IF YOU WANT ME AS A CLIENT,

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,816
KEEP YOUR COMPLIMENTS COMING,
AND YOUR BALLS IN THE ROUGH.

36
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,286
I'LL DO MY WORST, SIR.

37
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,693
 WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO SWING LIKE THAT?

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,362
BUSINESS SCHOOL.

39
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,035
HOW'D THINGS GO
IN D.C.?

40
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,737
AFTER OUR LITTLE MEETING,

41
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,306
    AND THE HALF A MILLION
ADDITIONAL SHARES I PURCHASED,

42
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,008
<i>WE HAVE FULL COOPERATION</i>

43
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,609
    <i>FROM THE JASCO</i>
<i>PHARMACEUTICALS BOARD.</i>

44
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,178
SIR, THAT MUCH STOCK'LL
PUT YOU OVER THE LIMIT.

45
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,814
NOT IF YOU DON'T BUY IT
IN YOUR OWN NAME.

46
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,784
SOUNDS LIKE
SIMPSON PUBLISHING'S
INVOLVED IN A MERGER.

47
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,457
   WATCH CNBC
TOMORROW MORNING.

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,366
CINDY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GET DRINKS TONIGHT?

49
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,436
NEVER.

50
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,471
GREAT,
RAINCHECK IT IS, THEN.

51
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,441
        Intercom:
<i>Ryan Turner's on line one.</i>

52
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,677
<i>Hey, gorgeous.</i>

53
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,912
HEY, HONEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

54
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,181
YOU-- IN ABOUT EIGHT HOURS.

55
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,217
OH, RYAN,

56
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,320
YOU ARE SO ROMANTIC.

57
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,356
- <i>I know.</i>
- ARE WE STILL ON FOR DINNER?

58
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,591
        <i>Yes, we are.</i>
<i>I'll meet you there at 8:00.</i>

59
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,894
AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT
I HAVE PLANNED FOR DESSERT.

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,930
OOOH, I'LL BRING
   THE CHERRY.

61
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,098
- <i>I wish.</i>
- BYE.

62
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,903
I UNDERSTAND
THE POSSIBILITY

63
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,338
OF BREAKING A NAIL
IS LOOMING OVER
EVERY WORD,

64
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,873
BUT YOUR DEADLINE
IS--

65
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,141
NOW.

66
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,943
OKAY!  JEEZ!

67
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,179
WHY DOES EVERYBODY
WANT SOMETHING FROM ME?

68
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,247
YOU WRITE AN ADVICE COLUMN?

69
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,850
I HAVE PROBLEMS TOO,
      YOU KNOW.

70
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,452
YES, I KNOW.

71
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,053
I MEAN, LISTEN
TO THIS LETTER,

72
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,424
 "DEAR CINDY, I WANT
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

73
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,294
BUT MY HUSBAND IS AGAINST IT.
     WHAT SHOULD I DO?"

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,496
I MEAN, THIS WOMAN
  IS SUCH A MESS.

75
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,399
SO WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

76
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,271
"WHY DO YOU NEED SCHOOL?
   YOU HAVE A HUSBAND.

77
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,208
 <i>IF YOU WANT TO FEEL</i>
<i>BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF,</i>
   <i>DO CHARITY WORK.</i>

78
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,176
<i>GO BUILD HAIRDO'S</i>
<i>FOR THE HOMELESS,</i>

79
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,278
        BETTER YET,
GO GET YOUR OWN HAIR DONE."

80
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,080
  THIS WOMAN POURS
HER HEART OUT TO YOU,

81
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,882
AND YOU GIVE HER BEAUTY TIPS?

82
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,350
WHAT'S WRONG HERE?

83
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,853
I HAVEN'T GIVEN YOU ANY.

84
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,789
   CINDY, THIS IS
A QUALITY NEWSPAPER.

85
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:20,193
PAGE, WE'RE NOT FRIENDS,
SO I CAN BE HONEST WITH YOU.

86
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,829
MY GRANDMOTHER'S LEGS
HAD BETTER CIRCULATION

87
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:26,199
THAN THIS
"QUALITY" NEWSPAPER.
NO ONE EVEN BUYS IT.

88
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,802
THEN I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO BUY OUT YOUR CONTRACT.

89
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,971
I WISH!

90
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,140
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
  YOU'RE FLAT--

91
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,908
BROKE.

92
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,477
SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO LET ME DO WHAT I DO.

93
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,946
WITH THE STYLE, GRACE,
AND FEMININITY

94
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,581
I DO IT WITH.

95
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,789
( humming )

96
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,925
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU SING, HONEY,
IT REALLY TURNS ME ON.

97
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,860
REALLY?  HA HA.
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO GO SHOPPING?

98
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,128
WHOA!

99
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,830
WE'RE WALKING HERE!

100
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,431
HUH?

101
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,133
SHE'S JUST LIKE
 MY THERAPIST.

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,435
TURNING EVERYTHING AROUND
   MAKING IT SEEM LIKE

103
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,771
- I'M THE ONE
  WITH THE PROBLEM.
- <i>THEN QUIT.</i>

104
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,407
- YOU SAID NOBODY READS
  YOUR COLUMN ANYWAYS.
- <i>I CAN'T JUST QUIT.</i>

105
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,711
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE A HUSBAND
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

106
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,213
( sighs )

107
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,183
- Woman: <i>WE'RE HERE--</i>
- THE SHERMANS.

108
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,250
HEY...

109
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,885
I LOVE YOUR BELT.

110
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,754
IT'S AN AUTHENTIC
GUCCI KNOCKOFF.

111
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,123
WHO'S GONNA' SUSPECT
FROM A DOCTOR'S WIFE, HUH?

112
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,192
I MIX THE KNOCKOFFS
WITH THE REAL GUCCI.

113
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,893
GUCCI-- GUCCI--
KNOCKOFF-- KNOCKOFF--

114
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,562
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

115
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,598
FOR FORMAL AFFAIRS,
ALL GUCCI, ONE KNOCKOFF.
I'LL WRITE IT DOWN.

116
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,034
WHAT ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT?

117
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,904
- I JUST DID TWO RHI--
- Mrs. Sherman: <i>I HAVE</i>
  <i>AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.</i>

118
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,608
GUESS WHAT BARRY'S GIVING ME
    FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY?

119
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,976
A NEW ASS!

120
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,813
THAT IS SUCH
A ROMANTIC GIFT.

121
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,916
AFTER THREE YEARS
OF MARRIAGE, YOU TWO
ARE STILL SO IN LOVE.

122
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,518
ISN'T THAT ROMANTIC,
RYAN?

123
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,919
THAT'S
VERY ROMANTIC.

124
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,088
BARRY WAS
READY FOR MARRIAGE
'CAUSE HE GOT TIRED

125
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,591
- OF FINISHING
  HIS OWN SENTENCES.
- WAS THAT A DIG?

126
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,526
SO WHAT'S
WITH THE CHAMPAGNE?

127
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,563
I GOT INFORMATION

128
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,600
FROM DONALD SIMPSON
ABOUT A MERGER.

129
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,069
IT'LL MAKE MY CLIENTS--
  AND ME-- A FORTUNE.

130
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,770
( pops )

131
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,873
Barry:
<i>IF SIMPSON TOLD YOU,</i>
<i>ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?</i>

132
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,443
 NO.  DONALD WOULD NEVER
RISK AN S.E.C. VIOLATION.

133
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,612
 I OVERHEARD HIM
AND HIS LAWYERS.

134
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,047
THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY
    OF A LIFETIME.

135
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,883
I'M EVEN MARGINING
 MY OWN PORTFOLIO.

136
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,784
WHAT'S MARGINING?

137
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,388
Mrs. Sherman:
IT'S BUYING ON CREDIT.
THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE YOU A CARD.

138
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,390
- YOU CHECKED THIS OUT?
- OF COURSE.

139
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,225
SIMPSON HIMSELF
BOUGHT STOCK--

140
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,127
IN HIS WIFE'S
MAIDEN NAME.

141
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,063
- WHICH STOCK?
- <i>JASCO PHARMACEUTICALS.</i>

142
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,099
<i>THEY'RE DEVELOPING</i>
<i>SOME ANTI-AGING DRUG.</i>

143
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,369
 WHEN IT HITS THE SHELVES,
THE STOCK COULD JUMP 1000%.

144
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,371
YOU COULD STILL GET IN.

145
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,606
NNNN...

146
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,276
   Mrs. Sherman:
NNN-NO!  FORGET IT.

147
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,478
WE'LL HANDLE ANTI-AGING
THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.

148
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,747
SURGERY!  RIGHT, HONEY?

149
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,483
YEAH.  WHATEVER.

150
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,717
A TOAST!

151
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,154

   Jasco <i>was</i> riding
a tide of speculation,

<i>but the press conference</i>
  <i>that just wrapped up</i>

249

   than positive.

250
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,631
  So in the final analysis
we concluded that the merger

251
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,100
was not to our fiscal
     advantage.

252

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,015
         Cindy:
    <i>I CAN'T BELIEVE</i>
<i>THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.</i>

306
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:20,119
OKAY, OKAY.  THIS CHANGES
  MY PLANS COMPLETELY.

307
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,956
   BUT I'M AN ADAPTER.
I CAN MAKE MYSELF BELIEVE

308
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,359
THAT THIS IS WORSE FOR YOU
    THAN IT IS FOR ME.

309
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,327
I JUST HAVE TO KEEP
 REMINDING MYSELF

310
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,696
THAT YOU ARE RYAN TURNER.

311
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,731
OH!

312
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,032
AND HONEY,

313
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,735
IF ANYONE CAN BOUNCE BACK
   FROM THIS YOU CAN.

314
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,637
RIGHT?

315
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,174
- RYAN.
- JIM.

316
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,342
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

317
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,378
- WALK WITH ME.
- SURE.

318
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,413
I GUESS YOU HEARD,
I LEFT BEACON TRADING.

319
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,282
EVERYBODY'S HEARD.

320
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,484
I HAVE ADMIRED YOUR FIRM
FOR QUITE AWHILE.

321
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,587
I FIGURED NOW WOULD BE
A GREAT TIME TO JOIN FORCES.

322
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,289
UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE DOWNSIZING.

323
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,926
JIM, SIX MONTHS AGO
YOU WERE BEGGING ME,

324
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,527
- NOW I'M--
- POISON.

325
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,797
I'M SORRY, RYAN.
IT'S-- I JUST--

326
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,699
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

327

332

  THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

335
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,560

I MADE SOME CALLS.

337
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,131
LOOKS LIKE THEY MIGHT BE
   INVESTIGATING YOU.

BRAZILIAN FLU?

462
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,889
PUT HER ON THE PHONE.

463
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,925
     I CAN'T.
SHE HAS LARYNGITIS.

464
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,327
HER DOCTOR ORDERED
 TOTAL VOICE REST.

465
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,030
HER DOCTOR?

466
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,798
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

467
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:56,001
       AH...
DR. BARRY SHERMAN.

468
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,372
  PERHAPS SHE SHOULD

471
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,946
WHEN SHE'S THIS SICK,
     SHOULD SHE?

472
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,781
( sighing )

473
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,051
FINE.  I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.
   I'LL SEND HER LETTERS OVER.

WITH CINDY WORKING
    FROM HOME.

502

    I LIKE TO DO THINGS
A CERTAIN WAY AROUND HERE.

OH!  THIS SOUNDS GOOD.

613
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:31,556
     CINDY IS DEVASTATED
THAT YOU WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE

614
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,760

AS A PRETENSE TO BREACH
     HER CONTRACT.

615

YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS?
PLEASE LEAVE.

<i>I'M SORRY.</i>

618
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,969
I RECOMMEND
YOU RECONSIDER

619
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,771
BEFORE HER DAMAGES
INCREASE.

620
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,172
"DAMAGES"?

621
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,608
CINDY'S PAIN
AND SUFFERING.

622
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,343
<i>MR. TURNER,</i>

<i>AND I KNOW PUBLISHING.</i>

624
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,213
CINDY WROTE
ABOUT MUNCHING HAIR,

625
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,915
AND GETTING ASS.

626
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,618
<i>SHE'S THE ONE</i>
<i>IN BREACH, NOT ME.</i>

627
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,887
IF YOU WANT TO
TAKE ME ON LEGALLY,

628
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,755
I'M READY FOR A FIGHT.
IS CINDY?

629
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,831
NO.

630
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,202
IRIS, HELP.

631
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,870
OH, WHAT'S THIS
PIECE OF PAPER

632
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,338
FALLING TO THE FLOOR

633

634

THANK YOU.

635
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:27,879
SHE LIKES ROSES.

636
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,248
I LIKE TULIPS.

GO AWAY, MR. TURNER.

643
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,557
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
- <i>( doorbell rings )</i>

645
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,428

653
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,712
I DON'T MIX BUSINESS
    AND PLEASURE.

654
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,515
 I DON'T THINK YOU MIX
PLEASURE AND PLEASURE.

655
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,050
YOU ARE WAY OUT OF LINE.

656
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:43,288
        JUST GIVE ME
 TWO MINUTES, AND I PROMISE
I'LL NEVER BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

657
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,090
I CAME TO...

658
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,825
APOLOGIZE.

659
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,532
TWO MINUTES.

660
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,203
AND THE TOCK
IS CLICKING.

661
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,843
ENTERTAINING, HUH?

662
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,518
NICE PLACE...

663
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,253
I'M SURE YOU CAME
WITH A POINT.

664
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,224
I CAN'T GO BACK
TO CINDY AND TELL HER
SHE LOST HER COLUMN.

665
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,860
I SEE.  WHERE WILL
YOU BE GOING THEN?

666
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:24,563
CINDY IS VERY SICK.

667
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,765
<i>PLEASE, HAVE</i>
<i>A LITTLE EMPATHY.</i>

668
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,833
EMPATHY?

669
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,504
EVERY CENT I COULD BEG
AND BORROW WENT INTO MY PAPER.

670
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,707
CINDY'S COLUMN HAS NEVER
REALLY FIT IN WITH MY VISION.

671
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,810
SHE LACKS WARMTH,
INSIGHT,

672
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,880
AND MOST IMPORTANT,
SENSITIVITY.

673
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,515
PEOPLE CHANGE.

674
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,185
PEOPLE'S LIVES CHANGE.
PEOPLE, I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT.

675
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,621
THINGS HAPPEN THAT
CHANGE PEOPLE.

676
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,558
GIVE HER
ONE MORE CHANCE.

677
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,261
AS A FAVOR TO ME?

678
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,963
AND WHAT
DO I OWE YOU?

679
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,902
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU PUT ON LIPSTICK
AT THIS HOUR?

680
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,537
I'M NOT WEARING LIPSTICK.

681
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,773
YES, YOU ARE.

682
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,109
I MIGHT BE
GOING OUT LATER.

683
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:12,811
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

684
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,347
IF I PUT MY MAKEUP
ON AT NIGHT,

685
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,782
IT SAVES ME 20 MINUTES
IN THE MORNING.

686

687
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,990
OKAY.

688
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,364
HEY.

689
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,334
ONE MORE CHANCE.

690
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:39,004
SEE, YOU DO HAVE
A SOFT SPOT.

691
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,239
AND RIGHT NOW,
I'M STARTING TO THINK

692
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,441
SOMEONE DROPPED ME
ON IT.

693
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,683

694

WAY PAST THAT CYNICISM.

"DEAR CINDY--"

697
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:03,495

698
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,230
"DEAR CINDY--"

"DEAR CINDY,
MY EX AND I BROKE UP,

THINKING ABOUT HIM.

703
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,208
IS FOUR MONTHS
TOO MUCH TIME TO GRIEVE
MY LOST LOVE?

704
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,011
SIGNED, NOT
A MOURNING PERSON."

705
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:23,048
OH GOOD,
A NEUROTIC ONE.

706
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,984
NOW YOU,
BEING A SENSITIVE
WOMAN, SAY...

707
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,287
 OUR DAYS IS
TOO MUCH TIME.

708
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:34,459
THE BEST WAY TO GET OVER A MAN,
  IS TO GET UNDER A NEW ONE."

709
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,795
NO, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.

710
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,496
I JUST DID.

711
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,132
- IT'S NOT SENSITIVE.
- MAYBE IT IS TO A WOMAN.

712
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,734
NO.  SAY...

713
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,136
"HE PROBABLY LEFT YOU
'CAUSE YOUR ASS GOT TOO BIG."

714
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,938
SAY THAT!

715
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:50,008
THEN TELL HER I CAN FIX IT.
PUT IN MY NAME AND
OFFICE NUMBER.

716
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:52,277
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
- IT COULD BE.

717
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,379
I'LL GIVE YOU
A FINDER'S FEE.

718
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:55,980
BARRY, NO.

719
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,916
FINE.  READ THE NEXT ONE.

IT'S SAD, REALLY.

724
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,363
TELL HER I CAN FIX IT.

725
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,332

THAT THE OTHER WOMAN
IS UGLY?

- YOU COULDN'T BE MAN ENOUGH
  TO TELL ME IN PERSON?

747

- <i>Honey, honey--</i>
- I'M SORRY, PROCEED.

- <i>What?</i>

754
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,418
I SWEAR,
I WOULD NEVER.

OH.  WELL...

756

SOMEBODY WANT

760

THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

761
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,275
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

762
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,543
HMM?

763
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,613
OH, THAT...

771
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,704

THEY'RE... BETTER.

00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,578
BETTER?
THEN THAT'S GOOD,
RIGHT?

774
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,182
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU SAID TO HER,

775
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:45,783
BUT IT HELPED.

776
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,586
I TOLD HER
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S SUFFERING.

777
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:53,791
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I STILL THINK SHE HAS
A LONG WAY TO GO.

778
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,560
BUT YOU'LL...
PRINT THESE?

779

HUMOR?

783
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,877
SLIPS OUT,
NOW AND THEN.

784
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,683
SHE LIKES THE COLUMN.

785
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,752
I TOLD YOU.

786
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,388

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR,

788
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,258
CINDY ALWAYS DID.

789

HOW DID YOU KNOW?

790
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,231
SURE.
GORGEOUS,
THEREFORE STUPID.

791
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,700
WHY AM I ALWAYS
A STEREOTYPE?

792
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,503
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL PAGE?

793
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,305

921
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:48,799
HEY, LISTEN,
IF YOU WANT TO QUIT,

922
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,702
I DON'T BLAME YOU.
WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT,

923
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:54,505
THIS DOCTOR ASKED ME TO CONSULT
ON THIS BURN VICTIM.

924
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:58,175
I GO IN THE ROOM.
THIS GUY'S GOT THIRD DEGREE
BURNS ON 90% OF HIS BODY.

925
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:01,645
HE WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN
I-IT-- IT WAS HORRIFYING.

926
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,714
AND I LOOK AT THE GUY,
AND I WAS--

927
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,449
I WAS SCARED SHITLESS,
ALL RIGHT?

928
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:07,251
SO I RAN OUT OF THERE.

929
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:10,087
AND THEN I WAS EMBARRASSED.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

930
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:12,523
SO I CALLED A FRIEND OF MINE,
TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED.

931
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,359
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?
HE GOES, "HEY, YOU'RE SCARED.

932
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:17,762
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT
BURN VICTIM FEELS?"

933
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,399
SMART FRIEND.

934
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,667
YES, YOU WERE.

935
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,973

...Causing quite a buzz
in the Tri-state area,

958
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:51,021
is advice columnist,
Cindy Styne,

959
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:53,324
<i>who has a rather</i>
<i>unorthodox approach,</i>

960
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,526
<i>and unique perspective,</i>
<i>to say the least.</i>

961
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:57,628
  For example,
a woman writes in

962
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:01,298
she's having no luck finding
   the perfect caring guy.

963
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,367
So Cindy advises,

964
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,436
"The problem isn't
finding a boyfriend

965
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,204
  who is perfect,
gentle and caring.

966
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,240
The problem is,

967
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,842
guys like that already
  <i>have</i> boyfriends."

BEFORE YOU MAKE
ANY DEMANDS,

1014
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,080
JUST REMEMBER
CINDY'S COLUMN

1015
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,616

A FEW WEEKS AGO.

HER RECENT SUCCESS

YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL?

1023
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,304

A DATE THAT KEPT YOU UP
ALL NIGHT THINKING
ABOUT IT?

SOMEONE WARM.
SOMEONE SENSITIVE.

1043

SOMEONE WHO'LL CRY

1044
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,787

WHAT DO YOU
WANT IN A MAN?

1045
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:48,292
SOMEONE WHO'S
NOT DECEITFUL.

1046
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:53,230
THIS CONTRACT...

1047
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:56,934
SORRY.  RIGHT.

1048
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,369
OKAY...

1049
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,739
I THINK A 5% INCREASE
IN SALARY IS FAIR.

1050
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,307
FOR A TRANSIT WORKER.

1051
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,142
50% OF THE PROFIT
INCREASE,

1052
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:07,311
MOVE THE COLUMN
TO PAGE FOUR.

1053
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,179
I SEE YOU CAME
PREPARED.

1054
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:13,350
- OKAY.
- SO TELL ME...

1055
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,120
  WHAT IS IT, EXACTLY,
THAT YOU WANT IN A WOMAN?

1056
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:20,023
CINDY, FOR EXAMPLE?

1057
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,428
MAYBE 50%
IS A LITTLE HIGH.

1058
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,396
 CLEARLY EVEN YOU
HAVE EXPECTATIONS.

1059
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,931
FRONT PAGE BILLING,

1060
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:30,033
AND 10%
OF THE PROFIT INCREASE.

1061
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,137
WHAT DOES SHE DO TO DESERVE
   THIS KIND OF LOYALTY?

1062
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:39,009
CINDY CHANGED MY LIFE
WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT.

1063
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:41,979
DID SHE?

1064
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:49,119
HER TERMS SEEM FAIR.

1065
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:51,955
I'LL HAVE MY ATTORNEY
DRAW UP PAPERS.

1066
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,457
THAT'S IT?

1067
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:55,225
DO YOUR BUSINESS
AND LEAVE?

1068
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,927
I FEEL SO CHEAP.

1069
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:59,730
 I TOLD YOU I WAS REVIEWING
A PERFORMANCE ARTIST TONIGHT.

1070
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,399
I COULD WALK YOU TO A CAB.
OR, YOU KNOW, TAG ALONG.

I'M NOT SO SURE
YOU WOULD ENJOY THIS.

1072
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,737
IT'S VERY PROGRESSIVE.

1073
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,106
YOU DON'T THINK
I'D FIT IN WITH THE ELITIST,

HIGH-BROW, ARTSY FARTSY
DOWNTOWN SCENE?

1075
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:14,344
I CAN BE AS PROGRESSIVE

1076
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,982
OKAY, COME ON.

1077
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,094

YOU'LL SEE.

1079
00:55:57,788 --> 00:56:00,991
OKAY, MAYBE NOT
AS PROGRESSIVE
AS THE NEXT GUY.

1080
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,298
THE ARTIST
INSERTS THE HOSE

1081
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,934
AND FILLS HIMSELF
WITH PAINT.

1082
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:13,203
YOU'RE KIDDI.

1083
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,342
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

1084
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:21,879
NOW HE'LL PROJECTILE

WHATEVER HAPPENED

1087
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:29,686
HE CALLS IT "ENEMART."

1088
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,756
IT REPRESENTS THE WASTE
OF HIS LIFE

1089
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,525
<i>BEING RELEASED</i>
<i>FROM THE BOWELS</i>

JUST BECAUSE I GOT
A LITTLE PAINT IN THE FACE

1096

1098
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,603
BUT IT WAS A WELL
RESPECTED ASS.

1099
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:24,975
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN YOUR EXPRESSION.

1100

IT WAS ACTUALLY
KIND OF CUTE.

IRIS,

00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,742
WHEN SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO SEE YOU RIGHT NOW.

HAVE YOU SEEN
THE AMOUNT OF MAIL FOR CINDY?

1117
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,645
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
IT'S BECAUSE OF ME.

1118
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,981

I NO LONGER

SO YOU CAN
DELIVER IT TO IRIS--

1124

ME?!  YOU?

1126
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:02,873
I DID NOT.

1127

IT SURE TASTED LIKE YOU.

1128
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,477
YOU LEANED IN...

MY BALANCE.

1131

I KNOW.
DON'T YOU JUST HATE IT

WELL, LET'S SEE.

1136
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,764
YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP,

YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER

THAT'S UNETHICAL.

1140
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:36,273
SHE'S BECOME
MY BIGGEST ASSET,

1141
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,774
THAT'S PLAIN FACT.

1142
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,876
IF YOU'D CHEAT ON HER,
YOU'D CHEAT ON ME,

YES.

SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1222

IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

1223
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,264
NEVER WRESTLE
WITH A PIG, MS. HENSEN,

1224
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,132
YOU'LL BOTH GET DIRTY,

1225
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,301
ONLY THE PIG LIKES IT!

1226
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:01,237
AT LEAST I KNOW
WHAT SPECIES OF ANIMAL
I'M DEALING WITH.

1227
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:03,940
GOOD DAY, MR. SIMPSON.

1228
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,048

01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:27,030
New York is asking,
  "Who is Cindy?"

1234
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,536
I ORDERED A SPECIAL MEAL,

1235

AND THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL
ABOUT THIS.

1236

OPEN THE DOOR!

1293
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:10,193
SHE'S NOT HERE.

1294

ANY REST SO I SENT HER
TO A PRIVATE HOSPITAL.

I LOOKED UP THE DOCTOR

HE'S A PLASTIC SURGEON.

     DR. SHERMAN

01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:53,903
A ONE BREASTED HUNCHBACK.

1310

  IT WAS LIKE TALKING

01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,411
- OH MY GOD--
- YEAH, IT WAS TERRIBLE.

1312
