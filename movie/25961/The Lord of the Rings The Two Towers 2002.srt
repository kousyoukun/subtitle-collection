It is special. �u���ܴ�

It's a little bit of home. �o�~���a�m�����D

We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down. �����÷�l�d�b�o��A���O�H��ۧڭ̤U��

Real Elvish rope. �u�������F÷�l

It's just where we can't get. �u�O�ڭ̤S�@��������

Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost. ����{��a�A�ڭ̰g���F

He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam... �L���Ʊ�o�ͫܦh�ơA�s�i

Mr. Frodo? ��ù�h?

It's the Ring, isn't it? �O�����]�١A��a?

47
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,389
It's getting heavier. ���ܱo�V�ӶV��

-What food have we got left? -Let me see. -�ڭ��ٳѤU����Y��?-�ڬݬ�

Oh, yes. Lovely. ���F�A�Χb�F

Lembas bread. And look! ���ڴ���³�A�A��

More lembas bread. ��h���ڴ���³

I don't usually hold with foreign food... �ڳq�`���ӷR�Y�ǪF��

Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam? ���򳣤���v�T�A���߱��C��a�A�s�i?

This looks strangely familiar. �o�a��n����

It's because we've been here before. ���O�]���ڭ̨ӹL�F

We're going in circles. �ڭ̦b�°�l

What is that horrid stink? ������D�����?

We're not alone. �o�঳�O�H

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,834
Can't take his draught! �o�O�}�ĭW�f�r

-Leave him alone! -Why? -�֦��� -���H

You want some? �A�]�Q�ܶܡH

Then keep your mouth shut. ���N�Ĩĳ��L

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,876
Merry. ����

Hello, Pip. �ָu

See? I fooled you too. �@�A�s�A�]�Q���F�F

Don't worry about me, Pippin. �O���ھ��

What is it? What do you smell? ���F?�A�D�줰��?

146
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,754
Man-flesh. �H��

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,075
They've picked up our trail. �L�̰l�W�ӤF

148
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,189
Aragorn. �ȩԩ�

Let's move! �֨�

Their pace has quickened. �L�̥[�֤F�}�B

151
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,511
They must have caught our scent. �L�̤@�w���ڭ̪����

Come on, Gimli! �֧r�A���E

154
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,395
Three days and nights pursuit. �ڭ̰l�F�T�ѤT�]

155
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,393
No food. No rest. �S�Y���B�S��

156
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,394
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell. �S���ĤH���ܸ�A�u�����r�r���å�

157
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,632
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall. ù��w�O�w���|�L�G���U��

158

They may yet be alive. �L�̥i���٬���

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,311
Very dangerous over short distances. �u�Z�����z�o�O�Q��

163
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,232
Rohan. ������

Home of the Horse-lords. �Y�M���m

There's something strange at work here. �Ʊ�������

Some evil gives speed to these creatures. �L�̳o����R�����@�w����]

Sets its will against us. �L�̷Q��I���

169
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,108
The Uruks turn northeast. �j�~�H�੹�F�_��

170
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,990
They are taking the Hobbits to lsengard. �L�̭n�⫢��H�a��㨯��

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,034
Saruman. �ľ|��

The world is changing. �@�����ܤF

The Old World will burn in the fires of industry. �j�۵M�N�Q�u�~�����]�k

180
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,471
The forests will fall. �˪L�N�Q�i�����a

A new order will rise. �@�ѷs�դO�N�|�U�_

187

188
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,675
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires. �ڭ̨S�����������Ψӥͤ�

189

The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep. �k�^�˪L�N�b�ڭ̤j���f

The Horse-Men took your lands. �Y�M��H���j�e�A�̪��g�a

We have only to remove those who oppose us. �ڭ̥����갣�Ҧ����ĤH

It will begin in Rohan. ������O�Ĥ@�ӥؼ�

Too long have these peasants stood against you. �o�ǹA�Ҥ@���M�A�@��

Your son is badly wounded, my lord. ���W�A�z����l���F����

He was ambushed by Orcs. �L�D��b�~�H�I��

If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force. �p�G�ڭ̤��½ð�a�A�N�|�Q�ľ|�ҹܨ�

That is a lie. �@���J��

Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. �b�~�H�b�ڰ����Q�D

Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. �v�L�Ҽ��a���H���

What was the promised price, Grima? �L�������A����A���O��?

When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure? ���H���������A�A�N��ʤ��]�_?

Too long have you watched my sister. �A���N�s�̧کf�f������

Too long have you haunted her steps. �A�]�@���������ܦo

Too much. �A�ޤӦh�F

You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... �A�N�Q��v�b�����ꤧ�~

Your orders mean nothing. �ڤ~��ť�A���R�O

Alive? ���L�ӡH

267
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,318
Trees that could whisper... ���i�H�C�y

00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,635
...talk to each other... ���ۥ��

270
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,270
I'm starving. �ھj���F

271
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,353
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days. �ڭ̳o�T�ѥu��Y�����I���ѥ]

00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,908
Yeah! �O��

273
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,237
Why can't we have some meat?! �ڭ̬����򤣯�Y��?

274
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,636
What about them? ��L�̦Y���p��H

275
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,597
They're fresh. �L�̪��׫ܷs�A

276
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,869
They are not for eating. �L�̤���Y

277
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,477
What about their legs? �u�Y�L�O�H

278
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,870
They don't need those. �ϥ��L�̤S�Τ���

-They look tasty. -Get back, scum! -�ݰ_�ӫܦn�Y -���ںu�^�h

280
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,750

Why alive? Do they give good sport? ������?�L�n��L�̷����y����?

283
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,431
They have something. An Elvish weapon. �L�̦��@�˪F��A�@�غ��F���Z��

284
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,512
The master wants it for the war. �D�H�n�Ψӥ��M

285
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,077
They think we have the Ring. �L�̥H���]�٦b�ڭ̨��W

As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead. �L�̵o�{���b�ڭ̨��W�A�ڭ̴N���w�F

...a bit of the flank. ...�S�󧫩O?

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,516
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys. �o�U���̴N���ץi�Y�F

Squeal. �y�s�r

No one's going to save you now. �S�H�|�ӱϧA

Pippin! �ָu

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,429
A red sun rises. ������Ӷ��ɰ_��

00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,753
Blood has been spilled this night. �Q�ߤ@�w���g�o�ͱ���

299
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,477
Riders of Rohan... �������M�h

...what news from the Mark? �Y�M�꦳�������?

301
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,032
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? �@�Ӻ��F�B�Z�H�M�G�H�������i�Y�M��?

302
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,994
Speak quickly! �ֻ�

303
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,791
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine. �M�h�A�A�����W�W�ӡA�ڴN���X�ڪ��W�t

304
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,028
I would cut off your head, Dwarf... �n���O�A��������G

305
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,710
...if it stood but a little higher from the ground. �ڴN�@�C���A���H�Y���a

306
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,711
You would die before your stroke fell. �ڷ|�����A�@�b�ũR

307
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,877
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. �ڬO�ȩԩ��A�ȩԪQ���l

308
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,239
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm. �o�O���E�A��ù�����l�C���F�ǭe�Դ��Ӧ۫շt�K�L

309
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,517
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king. �ڭ̬O������H���Y�M�����u�y����

310
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,749
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. ���u�y�w�g�����X�Ĥ�

311
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,076
Not even his own kin. �L�s�ۮa�H���{���o

312
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,277
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... �ľ|�Ҧb������W�U�r

313
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,317
...and claimed lordship over these lands. �N�o���g�a�e���w��

314
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,078
My company are those loyal to Rohan. �ڭ̻}���ĩ�������

315
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,912
And for that, we are banished. �ҥH�~�|�D���v

316
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,071
The White Wizard is cunning. �ճT�Ův�ޭp�h��

317
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,029
He walks here and there, they say... ť���L���ܥզ���O

318
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,156
...as an old man hooded and cloaked. ��B���X���S

319
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,589
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets. �L�������]�k�L�ڭ̪��ʵ�

320
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,876
We are no spies. �ڭ̤��O�L������

321
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,873
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. �ڭ̤@���V��A��V����l���@�s�j�~�H

322
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,390
They have taken two of our friends captive. �L�̧쨫�ڭ̨�ӪB��

323
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,515
The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night. ���s�j�~�H���F�A�ڭ̬Q������F�L��

324
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,717
But there were two Hobbits. Did you see two Hobbits with them? �L�̧쨫��W����H�A�A�S�ݨ���ӫ���H��?

325
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,713
They would be small. Only children to your eyes. �L�̨����G�p�A��H���p�Ĥ@�˰�

326
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,831
We left none alive. �ڭ̨S���d�U���f

327
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,278
We piled the carcasses and burned them. �ڭ̧�����_�ӿN��

328
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,714
Dead? ���F�H

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,238
I am sorry. ����

330

Hasufel! Arod! ��Ĭ���B��ù�w

331
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,991
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. �Ʊ�o��ǰ���a���A�̦n�B

332
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,713
Farewell. ��|����

333
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,875
Look for your friends. �h��A�̪��B��

334
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,430
But do not trust to hope. ���O�ߦs�Ʊ�

335
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,514
It has forsaken these lands. �ڭ̦��w���h�Ʊ�

336
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,631
We ride north! �ڭ̩��_��

337
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,952
It's one of their wee belts. �o�O�L�̪��p�y�a

338
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,116
We failed them. �ڭ̹藍�_�L��

339
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,670
A Hobbit lay here. �@�ӫ���H���b�o��

340
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,038
And the other. �t�@�Ӧb�o��

341
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,913
They crawled. �L�̦b�a�W����

342
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,956
Their hands were bound. ����Q�j��

343
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,352
Their bonds were cut. �L�̳��_÷��

344
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,196
They ran over here. �M��]��o��

345
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,835
They were followed. ���H�l�W�h

00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,592
The belt! �汼�y�a

Run! �ֶ]

348
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,234
Tracks lead away from the battle... �L�̪��������Գ�

00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,956
...into Fangorn Forest. �k�i�k�^�˪L

Fangorn? �k�^�˪L�H

What madness drove them in there? ���D�L�̺ƤF�ܡH

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,758
Did we lose him? I think we lost him. �ϱ��L�̤F��?�n���ϱ��F

Little Orcs. �p�b�~�H

It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking. �L�b���ܡA�o�ʾ�b����

A tree-herder. �����

A shepherd of the forest. �˪L���u�@��

Don't talk to it, Merry. �O��L����

Don't encourage it! �O���y�L����

Never heard of a Hobbit before. �ڨSť�L����H�o���N

They come with axes. �٦����Y���i��

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,436
Yes, and it will not be easily cured. �Ʊ��S����n�ѨM

Then we have run all this way for nothing? ���ڭ̤j�ѻ����ӳo��O�նO�u���o?

Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... �ڭ̭n�⨺��ӥi��������H

...quite charming forest. �K�����g�H���˪L��

It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. ���̩M�ָu�Ө�k�^�˪L�ä��u�O���X�Ӥw

550

The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... ���̩M�ָu����ӴN���O�@���p�ۤl�K

In one thing you have not changed, dear friend. �A�٬O�S���ܡA�Ѥ�

You still speak in riddles. �A�����٬O���b������

554
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:23,235
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days. ���@��ۻ��j�H�ӴN�S�o�ͪ��ƧY�N�o��

555
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,870
The Ents are going to wake up... ��H�N�q�ιڤ�����

Merry and Pippin are quite safe. ���̸�ָu�ܦw��

In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be. ����L�̤]�|��A�̦w��

561
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,955
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one. �{�b���̹D�Ҥ�H�e�ٷ|�G�o

562
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,679

Shadowfax. �o�O�v�e

He is the lord of all horses... �L�O��������

Upon your head How golden-red �����⪺�ӫa

You might call it far, perhaps. �A�i�H���ܻ��a

575
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,549
My home lies deep in the forest... �ڪ��a�b�˪L�`�B

...near the roots of the mountain. �a��s�}���a��

I told Gandalf I would keep you safe. �ڵ����̹D�ҭn�O�@�A�̦w��

00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,309
Right. �O��

582
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:59,350
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves �b�I�Ϊ����U��쪺����

583
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,196
And the dreams of trees unfold �w�w���u��

584
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:10,549
When woodland halls are green and cool ���L�a�A��M�D

585
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,633
And the wind is in the West �護�j�خ�

Sleep, little Shirelings. �Χa�A�p�L���H

Heed no nightly noise. �O�ީ]�ߪ��n��

Sleep till morning light. �@ı�Ψ�ѫG

I have business in the forest. �ڦb�˪L�̦��ƭn��

There are many to call. Many that must come. �ڭn�l���n�h��H�A�ܦh��H���|��

The Shadow lies on Fangorn. �·t���{�k�^�˪L

The withering of all woods is drawing near. �Ҧ�������ִN�|�\��

596
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,513
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape. �F�誺���v�v������

597
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,794
Sauron will suffer no rival. ���۹�ĤH�����d��

598
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,318
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly. �L�������b�کԦh������������a�ݵۤ@��

599
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,756

Doubt ever gnaws at him. �L���ߤ��R���ü{

The rumor has reached him. �����w�Ǩ�L�դ�

Sauron fears you, Aragorn. ���۩ȧA�A�ȩԩ�

He fears what you may become. �L�ȧA�|�����߸��j�w

And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men. �ҥH�L�~��ۦV�H���@�ɶi��

War is coming. �j�ԧY�N���{

Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose. ���۩M�ľ|�ҥ��b�`�`�G��

The Ring remains hidden. �L���٨S����]��

And that we should seek to destroy it... �L�����ڨS�Q��

Where has he gone? �L�]����h�F�H

I had the loveliest dream last night. �ڬQ�߰��F�@�Ӭ���

01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,714
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed. �ڹڨ�@�Ӥj����̭��˺��ϯ�

There it is again. �S�ӤF

It isn't safe. �o�̤��w��

The trees have grown wild and dangerous. ����ܱo�g���M�I

Anger festers in their hearts. �L�̤ߤ��U�_�������

Black are their thoughts. ���ߥR���ķN

They will harm you if they can. �L�̫ܥi��|�ˮ`�A��

There are too few of us now. ��H���ƶq�V�ӶV��

Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. ��h�Դ��H�α��������

There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan... �����������u�y���Ӯc

... whose mind is overthrown. �L�����ߨ����۴b

Do not look for welcome here. �ڭ̤����w��

A hutch to trammel some wild thing in. �p�PŢ�����@�����ۥ�

Theodred's death was not of your making. ���u�w�������O�A����

We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep. �M�h��t�����M��

Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands. �ڭ̤H�����g�a�N���A���J�ĤH�⤤

1330
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:26,318
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor! �����N�O�ȴ����S���^���M�H���h��

1331
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:28,557

1333
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:42,439
Good speech. Nice and short. �ܴΪ��t���A²���n

1334
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:45,398
Leaves more time for drinking! �o�ˤ~����h�ɶ��ܰs

1335
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:49,753
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty! ���X��s�A�̥S�̤f���F

1336
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:55,150
Remember today, little brother. �p�̡A�O������

1337
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:58,198
Today, life is good. ���ѫܬ��n

1338
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,713
What? ���F?

1339
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:05,479
He's here. �L�ӤF

1340
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:11,472
One moment of peace, can he not give us that? �L�������ڭ̲M�R�@�U��?

1341
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:14,950
Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born? ���M�̭^�i���Ԥh�b����?�ڪ����l�b����?

1342
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:17,118
Father! ����

1343
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:24,035
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly. �L�̻��A�X�G�O�@�ҷ����A�ˤ��Ҧ��ĤH���

1344
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:27,476
They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also. ���O�ؤj����A�ӧQ�]�ݩ�k�Ծ�

1345
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:31,678
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing. �n���O�L�A�o�y�����N���|�Q����

1346
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:34,635
Were you not entrusted to protect it? �ڤ��O�R�O�A�O�@�o�y����?

1347
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,756
I would have done, but our numbers were too few. �ڻ}���O�@���A���O�ڭ̹褣�Ĳ�

1348
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:38,558
Oh, too few. �o���O�Ǥf

1349
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,315
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. �A���ĤH���X�ӤJ�A�N�o�˧⫰��U��

1350
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:46,398
Always you cast a poor reflection on me. �A�ѬO��ڪ�¥

1351
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:48,710
That is not my intent. �ڤ��O�G�N��

1352
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:52,475
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will. �L���F�R���A�ľԡA�A�o�����L�@�I�֩w

1353

1355
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:04,950
We have more urgent things to speak of. �ڭ̦���n�򪺨ƭn��

1356
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:08,389
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting. ����������R�����l���|ĳ

1357
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:11,313
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose. �L�S����]�A���O�ڤ]�q�o�X��

1358
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:15,109
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found. �Ǩ��ĤH���Q���Q���F

1359
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:19,435
The One Ring. �ܴL�]��

1360
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:26,551

1362
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:34,319
We cannot let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor. �ڭ̥�������L�̡A���M�@�w�n�o��ܴL�]��

1364
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:42,309
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. �N�Ӥ����w���H�|�����]���۴b

1365
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:46,268
But you, you are strong. And our need is great. ���O�A�ܰ��j�A�ڭ̫止�ݭn��

1366
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:51,514
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying. �ڭ̬��F�½ä��g�@�ɡA���Y�`�x����A�묹�L�ƤH�R

1367
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:56,549
Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies. ���۪��ɶ��R�ΡA�L���b�������c�H�x

1368
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,153
He will return. �L�@�w�|�A�^��

1369
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:01,915
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. ��ɭԧڭ̴N�L�O���

You must go. �A�@�w�n�h

Oh, I see. �ڪ��D�F

1376
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:27,639
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality. ���M�N�x�k�Ծ��Q�n�ҩ��L����O

Down there. �U��

1385
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:59,913
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death. �ִ����i�T�Ҥ������Ž�

1386
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:11,513
They wait for my command. �L�̦b���ڪ��R�O

Shall I shoot? �ڸӤU�O��?

Of course he did. �L���M�F�F�ڭ�

Don't be hasty. �O�߫�

02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:01,477
They say that it is hopeless. �L�̳����S���Ʊ�F

This is a good sword. �o�O��n�C

There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.�S����n��̪�

Don't you know your Sam? �A���{�o�ڤF��?

It's all wrong. �o������

But we are. ���O�ڭ̨ӤF

The ones that really mattered. �q�|���j���Ƹ�

1880
03:13:57,120 --> 03:13:59,998
Full of darkness and danger they were. �R���F�·t�M�M�I

1881

And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... ���ɭԧA���Q���D����

...because how could the end be happy? �]�����i�঳�ֵּ���?

1883

How could the world go back to the way it was... �o�ͳo��h�i�Ȫ���

We have victory! �ڭ���ӤF

Even darkness must pass. �N�s�·t�]�|����

A new day will come. ��s���@�ѱN�|���{

They kept going... �L�̨M�w�i�����e

What are we holding on to, Sam? �ڭ̩�ۤ���H��?

I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins. �ڲש�F�ѧA�����j�ϩR�A��ù�h�P�ڪ���

Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious. �O���ڤF�A��ù�h�C�ڬO�{�u��

1994
03:23:26,200 --> 03:23:27,519
So was l. �ڤ]�O

1995
03:23:36,040 --> 03:23:38,634
"Samwise the Brave." �i�̤s�i�ô�

1996
03:23:42,720 --> 03:23:43,994
Smeagol? �v����?

1997
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:46,958
We're not going to wait for you. Come on. �ڭ̤����A�@�A�֨ӧa

1998
03:23:47,120 --> 03:23:48,951
Master. �D�H

1999
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:51,953
Master looks after us. �D�H�|���U�ڭ�

2000
03:23:52,720 --> 03:23:55,393
Master wouldn't hurt us. �D�H���|�ˮ`�ڭ�

2001
03:23:55,560 --> 03:23:57,915
Master broke his promise. �D�H���u�H��

2002
03:23:58,080 --> 03:24:00,150
Don't ask Smeagol. �O�G�v����

2003
03:24:00,320 --> 03:24:03,392
Poor, poor Smeagol. �i�����v����

2004
03:24:03,560 --> 03:24:06,279
Master betrayed us. �D�H�X��F�ڭ�

2005
03:24:06,440 --> 03:24:09,398
Wicked. Tricksy. False. �l�B����B�갰���@

2006
03:24:09,560 --> 03:24:13,314
We ought to wring his filthy little neck. �ڭ����ӧ�L����l���_

2007
03:24:13,480 --> 03:24:16,119
Kill him! Kill him! ���F�L

2008
03:24:16,280 --> 03:24:17,713
Kill them both! ���F�L�̨��

2009
03:24:17,880 --> 03:24:21,350
And then we take the precious... �M��ڭ̷m���_��

2010
03:24:21,520 --> 03:24:24,910
...and we be the master! �ۤv���D�H

2011
03:24:25,560 --> 03:24:28,120
But the fat Hobbit, he knows. �i�O�D����H���D

2012
03:24:28,280 --> 03:24:30,840
Eyes always watching. �L�ѬO�n�ۧ��

2013
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:34,390
Then we stabs them out. ���N��L�������W�M

2014
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:38,872
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl. ��L�����]�������L���ۨ�

2015
03:24:39,040 --> 03:24:42,350
Yes. Yes. Yes. �n�A�n

2016
03:24:42,520 --> 03:24:45,114
Kill them both. ���F�L�̨��

2017
03:24:45,280 --> 03:24:47,669
Kill them both. ���F�L�̨��

2018
03:24:47,840 --> 03:24:51,389
It's too risky. It's too risky. �ӫ_�I�F

2019
03:24:52,080 --> 03:24:54,548
Where is he? Where has he gone? �L�b����?�L�]����h�F?

2020
03:24:54,720 --> 03:24:57,234
-Hey, Gollum! Where are you? -Smeagol? -�B�|�A�A�b����? -�v����

2021
03:24:57,400 --> 03:25:02,554
We could let her do it. �ڭ̥i�H���o�U��

2022
03:25:03,480 --> 03:25:07,473
Yes. She could do it. �O�ڡA�o�i�H�U�r��

2023
03:25:07,640 --> 03:25:11,997
Yes, precious, she could. �S���A�_���A�o�i�H�U��

2024
03:25:12,160 --> 03:25:17,951
And then we takes it once they're dead. ���L�̦��F�ڭ̴N�⥦����

2025
03:25:18,840 --> 03:25:21,559
Once they're dead. �n���L�̦��F

2026
03:25:25,800 --> 03:25:29,349
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. ���I�A����H�A�٦��n�������n��

2027
03:25:29,520 --> 03:25:31,476
Smeagol will show you the way. �v����|�a�A�̥h

2028
