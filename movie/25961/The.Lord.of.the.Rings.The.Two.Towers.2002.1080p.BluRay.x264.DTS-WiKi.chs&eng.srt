1
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:42,212
魔戒2：双塔奇兵

2
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,454
-你不能过来！-甘道夫！
You cannot pass! Gandalf!

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,667
我是圣火的仆人高举着亚尔诺炽焰
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

4
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,376
滚回黑暗中吧
Go back to the Shadow.

5
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,081
黑暗之火不会帮你的乌顿之火
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

6
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:54,451
你不能过来！
You shall not pass!

7
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:23,316
不！别去！
No! No!

8
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,492
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

9
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,762
你们快走吧
Fly, you fools.

10
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,266
不！
No!

11
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,308
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

12
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:51,841
甘道夫！
Gandalf!

13
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:55,075
佛罗多，怎么了？
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

14
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:58,746
没什么
Nothing.

15
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:08,152
我只是做了梦
Just a dream.

16
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:15,834
双城奇谋

17
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:28,515
魔多，那是在中土世界我们最不想去的地方
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.

18
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,877
但是我们却非去不可
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.

19
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:33,381
只是我们又一直走不到
It's just where we can't get.

20
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:37,789
面对现实吧，我们迷路了
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

21
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:42,890
甘道夫不会希望我们走这儿
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.

22
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:47,830
他不希望发生很多事，山姆
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...

23
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:50,135
但是却发生了
...but they did.

24
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:04,249
佛罗多？
Mr. Frodo?

25
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:09,587
是那只魔戒，对吧？
It's the Ring, isn't it?

26
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:13,158
它变得越来越重
It's getting heavier.

27
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,502
-我们还剩什么吃的？-我看看
- What food have we got left? - Let me see.

28
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,278
有了，棒呆了
Oh, yes. Lovely.

29
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:34,242
兰巴斯干粮，你看
Lembas bread. And look!

30
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:38,946
更多兰巴斯干粮
More lembas bread.

31
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:51,664
我通常不太爱吃怪东西
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

32
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,800
不过这种精灵干粮真的不错吃
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

33
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,171
什么都不能影响你的心情对吧，山姆？
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?

34
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,343
那些乌云就能
Those rain clouds might.

35
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:23,457
这地方好眼熟
This looks strangely familiar.

36
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:26,566
那是因为我们来过了
It's because we've been here before.

37
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,258
我们在兜圈子
We're going in circles.

38
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:31,867
什么味道那么臭？
What is that horrid stink?

39
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,233
我打赌附近一定有沼泽
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

40
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,374
-你闻得到吗？-闻得到
- Can you smell it? Yes.

41
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,640
我闻到了
I can smell it.

42
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:46,351
这儿有别人
We're not alone.

43
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:04,061
小偷，那些小偷
The thieves. The thieves.

44
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:08,206
那些臭小偷
The filthy little thieves.

45
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:11,069
它在哪里？
Where is it?

46
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:13,940
在哪里？

47
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:17,845
他们从我们身上把它偷走
They stole it from us.

48
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:22,215
我的宝贝
My precious.

49
00:07:23,157 --> 00:07:26,354
我们诅咒他们，我们恨他们
Curse them, we hates them!

50
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:30,621
它是我们的，我们想要它
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

51
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,449
这是针刺宝剑
This is Sting.

52
00:08:27,688 --> 00:08:29,178
你以前也看过它
You've seen it before...

53
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:31,891
对吧，咕鲁？
...haven't you, Gollum?

54
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:39,399
放开他否则我就割断你的喉咙
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

55
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:57,245
好烫
It burns!

56
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:59,715
烫死了
It burns us!

57
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:02,654
冰死了
It freezes!

58
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,720
臭精灵打造的绳子
Nasty Elves twisted it.

59
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,555
-快帮我们解开-给我闭嘴
- Take it off us! - Quiet, you!

60
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,198
这样不行魔多的半兽人会听到他鬼叫
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.

61
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:19,962
-把他绑起来留在这儿吧-不要
- Let's just tie him up and leave him. - No!

62
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:23,742
这样我们一定会死的
That would kill us! Kill us!

63
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,639
你死了是活该
It's no more than you deserve!

64
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:30,373
也许他的确是该死
Maybe he does deserve to die.

65
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,221
不过我看到他倒是很可怜他
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

66
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:44,562
你们只要对我们好我们就一定会报答
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.

67
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:47,561
快把绳子解开
Take it off us.

68
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:54,606
我们发誓一定会乖乖听话
We swears to do what you wants.

69
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:56,707
我们对天发誓
We swears.

70
00:09:57,078 --> 00:09:59,444
我才不相信你发的誓
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.

71
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,878
我们发誓
We swears...

72
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:08,849
我们会服侍宝贝的主人
...to serve the master of the precious.

73
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,822
我们愿意对…
We will swear on...

74
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,960
…   宝贝发誓
...on the precious.

75
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:17,323
咕鲁，咕鲁
Gollum. Gollum.

76
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:21,626
魔戒力量强大不可靠我们会逼你信守承诺
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.

77
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:23,764
是的
Yes...

78
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:26,838
对宝贝发誓
...on the precious.

79
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,676
对宝贝发誓
On the precious.

80
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:34,380
我不相信你
I don't believe you!

81
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:39,853
-下来，快下来-山姆
- Get down! I said, down! - Sam!

82
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:41,748
他想要骗我们
He's trying to trick us.

83
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:44,981
我们放了他他一定会趁我们熟睡偷袭我们
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.

84
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,907
-你知道去魔多的路吗？-知道
- You know the way to Mordor? - Yes.

85
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:05,605
你去过那儿？
You've been there before?

86
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,204
去过
Yes.

87
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,720
你要带领我们到黑门
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

88
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,081
梅里！
Merry!

89
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,586
梅里！

90
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:51,483
怎么了？你闻到什么？
What is it? What do you smell?

91
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:54,153
人类
Man-flesh.

92
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,162
亚拉冈
Aragorn.

93
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:59,229
他们追上来了
They've picked up our trail.

94
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,196
快走
Let's move!

95
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,658
他们加快了脚步
Their pace has quickened.

96
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:28,627
他们一定闻到我们的气味
They must have caught our scent.

97
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:30,558
快走吧
Hurry!

98
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:35,930
快呀，金雳
Come on, Gimli!

99
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,070
我们追了三天三夜
Three days and nights pursuit.

100
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:45,210
没吃饭、没休息
No food. No rest.

101
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:49,382
没有敌人的踪迹只有光秃秃的乱石
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.

102
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:24,009
罗瑞安别针不会无故掉下来
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

103
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,717
他们可能还活着
They may yet be alive.

104
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:31,182
他们离我们不到一天脚程来吧
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

105
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:36,329
快点，就快追上他们了
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

106
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,762
长途跋涉我最不在行咱们矮人是天生短跑健将
I'm wasted on cross-country. We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

107
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:44,499
短距离内爆发力十足
Very dangerous over short distances.

108
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,011
洛汗国
Rohan.

109
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:00,982
骠骑之乡
Home of the Horse-lords.

110
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:04,747
事情有蹊跷
There's something strange at work here.

111
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:07,893
他们这么拼命赶路一定有原因
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.

112
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:11,029
他们想对付我们
Sets its will against us.

113
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:19,135
勒苟拉斯你的精灵眼睛看到什么？
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

114
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:21,841
强兽人转往东北方
The Uruks turn northeast.

115
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:24,869
他们要把哈比人带到艾辛格
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

116
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:27,007
萨鲁曼
Saruman.

117
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:38,617
世局改变了
The world is changing.

118
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:44,388
现在谁有力量抵挡艾辛格
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...

119
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:47,828
和魔多大军的攻势？
...and Mordor?

120
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:55,099
有谁能对抗索伦和萨鲁曼
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...

121
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,937
以及双城结盟的力量？
...and the union of the two towers?

122
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,420
索伦魔君，只要我们携手合作
Together, my Lord Sauron...

123
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:12,114
就能统治中土世界
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.

124
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:32,440
大自然将被工业之火吞蚀
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.

125
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,277
森林将被夷为平地
The forests will fall.

126
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:41,050
一股新势力将会崛起
A new order will rise.

127
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:47,024
我们将以半兽人的坚甲利兵
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...

128
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:51,163
发动千军万马的战争机器
...and the iron fists of the Orc.

129
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:05,743
我们必须铲除所有的敌人
We have only to remove those who oppose us.

130
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,814
骠骑国人民强占你们的土地
The Horse-Men took your lands.

131
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:13,509
你们被他们赶到深山过着苦哈哈的日子
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.

132
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:15,119
杀人者死
Murderers!

133
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,149
抢回你们被夺走的每一块土地
Take back the lands they stole from you.

134
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:20,121
烧毁每一个村庄
Burn every village!

135
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,492
洛汗国是第一个目标
It will begin in Rohan.

136
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:33,773
这些农夫一直和你作对
Too long have these peasants stood against you.

137
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,770
他们死定了
But no more.

138
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:38,204
伊欧参！伊欧参！
Eothain! Eothain!

139
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,041
带着你妹妹只有你们两个骑得会比较快
You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.

140
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:46,078
爸爸说伊欧参不能骑加鲁夫
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

141
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,912
他太高大了
He is too big for him.

142
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:51,090
听我说你要骑到伊多拉斯警告他们
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.

143
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,793
-你明白吗？-明白，妈妈
- Do you understand me? - Yes, Mama.

144
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:56,961
我不想走，我不要走
I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama.

145
00:16:57,197 --> 00:17:00,860
斐黛，我会去找你的
Freda, I will find you there.

146
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,431
快去吧
Quickly!

147
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:15,437
去吧，孩子们
Go, child.

148
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,327
魔君，洛汗国…
Rohan, my lord...

149
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:30,296
…即将毁灭
...is ready to fall.

150
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,581
希优德？
Theodred.

151
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:14,406
王上，您的儿子受了重伤
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

152
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,275
他遭到半兽人埋伏
He was ambushed by Orcs.

153
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:22,473
如果我们不捍卫国家就会被萨鲁曼夺走
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.

154
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,384
一派胡言
That is a lie.

155
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:32,422
白袍巫师萨鲁曼一向是我们的盟友
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.

156
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:36,095
葛力马
Grima.

157
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:39,429
葛力马
Grima.

158
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:43,469
葛力马

159
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:47,307
半兽人在我国横行霸道
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

160
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:51,300
肆无忌惮地杀人放火
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will.

161
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,912
他们身上有萨鲁曼的白掌徽记
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

162
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:08,523
你为什么要让心事重重的国王烦上加烦？
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?

163
00:19:08,762 --> 00:19:11,162
你没看到吗？
Can you not see?

164
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:16,392
你叔叔受够了你的恶行恶状
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...

165
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,105
还有你的好勇善斗
...your warmongering.

166
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,275
好勇善斗？
Warmongering?

167
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,603
萨鲁曼买通了你有多久？
How long is it since Saruman bought you?

168
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:28,811
他答应给你什么，葛力马？
What was the promised price, Grima?

169
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:32,711
等人类全死光你就能瓜分财宝？
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?

170
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:47,826
你早就觊觎我妹妹的美色
Too long have you watched my sister.

171
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:49,969
你也一直偷偷跟踪她
Too long have you haunted her steps.

172
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:02,377
你管太多了，伊欧墨伊欧蒙德之子
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

173
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:03,708
你管太多了
Too much.

174
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,887
你将被放逐在洛汗国之外
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...

175
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,355
直到痛苦死去为止
...under pain of death.

176
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,987
呼吸均匀，这就是绝窍
Keep breathing. That's the key.

177
00:20:48,295 --> 00:20:49,922
呼吸均匀
Breathe.

178
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:57,833
他们好像被主人鞭打一样狂奔
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.

179
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:16,089
我们一定要休息一下
We're not going no further...

180
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:18,257
才能继续走下去
...until we've had a breather.

181
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,759
升起营火
Get a fire going!

182
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:26,388
梅里！
Merry!

183
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,062
梅里！

184
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:34,967
我们不该离开夏尔的，皮聘
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.

185
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:46,645
那是什么声音？
What's making that noise?

186
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:49,687
那是树的声音
It's the trees.

187
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,479
什么？
What?

188
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:55,658
你记得雄鹿地边境的老林吗？
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?

189
00:21:55,896 --> 00:22:00,333
他们说水中有什么东西能让树木长高
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...

190
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,001
然后活过来
...and come alive.

191
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:03,929
活过来？
Alive?

192
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:06,497
树木可以低语
Trees that could whisper...

193
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:10,007
互相交谈
...talk to each other...

194
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:12,040
甚至走动
...even move.

195
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:15,874
我饿死了
I'm starving.

196
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:20,109
我们这三天只能吃长满蛆的面包
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.

197
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:21,748
是啊
Yeah!

198
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:25,219
我们为什么不能吃肉？
Why can't we have some meat?!

199
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:29,788
把他们吃掉如何？
What about them?

200
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,861
他们的肉很新鲜
They're fresh.

201
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:36,263
他们不能吃
They are not for eating.

202
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:44,242
只吃腿呢？
What about their legs?

203
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:46,742
反正他们又用不着
They don't need those.

204
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:51,376
-看起来很好吃-给我滚回去
- They look tasty. Get back, scum!

205
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:55,544
-切成丁-分我一口
Carve them up! Just a mouthful.

206
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:57,256
不行
No!

207
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,851
这下咱们就有肉可吃了
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

208
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:10,696
皮聘
Pippin.

209
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:12,563
快逃
Let's go.

210
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:22,548
尽管逃
Go on.

211
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:24,249
去求救呀
Call for help.

212
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:26,676
尖叫呀
Squeal.

213
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:30,047
没人会来救你
No one's going to save you now.

214
00:23:39,332 --> 00:23:40,663
皮聘
Pippin!

215
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:07,493
血红的太阳升起来
A red sun rises.

216
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:10,895
昨晚一定曾经发生杀戮
Blood has been spilled this night.

217
00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:43,959
洛汗国骑士
Riders of Rohan...

218
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:46,830
骠骑国有什么消息？
...what news from the Mark?

219
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:18,962
一个精灵、凡人和矮人为何闯进骠骑国？
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

220
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,993
快说
Speak quickly!

221
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:25,997
骑士，你先报上名来我就说出我的名字
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.

222
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:37,740
要不是你长的那么矮
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

223
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:40,549
我就一剑让你的人头落地
...if it stood but a little higher from the ground.

224
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:43,646
我会先让你一箭毙命
You would die before your stroke fell.

225
00:25:52,432 --> 00:25:54,263
我是亚拉冈，亚拉松之子
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

226
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:58,764
这是金雳，葛罗音之子精灵勒苟拉斯来自幽暗密林
This is Gimli, son of GIoin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

227
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,167
我们是洛汗国以及骠骑王希优顿之友
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

228
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:07,674
希优顿已经分不出敌友
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.

229
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:10,108
他连自家人都认不得
Not even his own kin.

230
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:16,588
萨鲁曼在国王身上下毒
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...

231
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:18,688
将这片土地占为己有
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

232
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:23,662
我们誓死效忠洛汗国
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

233
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,592
所以才会遭到放逐
And for that, we are banished.

234
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:30,932
白袍巫师诡计多端
The White Wizard is cunning.

235
00:26:31,705 --> 00:26:34,037
听说他身披白色斗蓬
He walks here and there, they say...

236
00:26:34,274 --> 00:26:36,208
到处神出鬼没
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

237
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:41,908
他的爪牙也逃过我们的监视
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.

238
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:44,309
我们不是他的爪牙
We are no spies.

239
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:47,418
我们一路向西横越平原追赶一群强兽人
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.

240
00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:50,051
他们抓走我们两个朋友
They have taken two of our friends captive.

241
00:26:50,924 --> 00:26:53,324
那群强兽人死了我们昨晚歼灭了他们
The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night.

242
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,654
他们抓走两名哈比人你没看见两个哈比人吗？
But there were two Hobbits. Did you see two Hobbits with them?

243
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,797
他们身材矮小跟人类小孩一样高
They would be small. Only children to your eyes.

244
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:05,103
我们没有留下活口
We left none alive.

245
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,706
我们把尸体堆起来烧掉
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

246
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,407
死了？
Dead?

247
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:20,112
很遗憾
I am sorry.

248
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,989
哈苏风、阿罗德
Hasufel! Arod!

249
00:27:29,863 --> 00:27:34,459
希望这两匹马能带给你们好运
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.

250
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:37,293
后会有期
Farewell.

251
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:44,770
去找你们的朋友
Look for your friends.

252
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:47,439
但别心存希望
But do not trust to hope.

253
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:51,706
我们早已失去希望
It has forsaken these lands.

254
00:27:51,985 --> 00:27:53,919
我们往北走
We ride north!

255
00:28:44,604 --> 00:28:46,333
这是他们的小腰带
It's one of their wee belts.

256
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,188
我们对不起他们
We failed them.

257
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:18,362
一个哈比人躺在这儿
A Hobbit lay here.

258
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:21,897
另一个在这儿
And the other.

259
00:29:32,785 --> 00:29:34,309
他们在地上爬行
They crawled.

260
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:40,583
双手被绑住
Their hands were bound.

261
00:29:52,805 --> 00:29:54,568
他们割断绳索
Their bonds were cut.

262
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:12,148
然后跑到这里
They ran over here.

263
00:30:15,862 --> 00:30:16,988
有人追上去
They were followed.

264
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:21,894
脱掉腰带
The belt!

265
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:26,929
快跑
Run!

266
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:32,005
他们的足迹远离战场
Tracks lead away from the battle...

267
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,975
逃进法贡森林
...into Fangorn Forest.

268
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:41,318
法贡森林？
Fangorn?

269
00:30:41,554 --> 00:30:44,114
难道他们疯了吗？
What madness drove them in there?

270
00:31:01,908 --> 00:31:04,843
甩掉他们了吗？好像甩掉了
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

271
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:14,985
我要把你们的小心脏给挖出来
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!

272
00:31:21,294 --> 00:31:22,226
给我过来
Come here!

273
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:30,258
快，爬到树上
Trees. Climb a tree.

274
00:31:39,712 --> 00:31:41,373
他不见了
He's gone.

275
00:31:53,526 --> 00:31:55,790
梅里！
Merry!

276
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:11,640
我要在你的胜子上戳一个洞
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

277
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:20,308
快跑呀，梅里
Run, Merry!

278
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:34,429
小半兽人
Little Orcs.

279
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:36,898
他在说话，这棵树在说话
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

280
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:38,967
树？
Tree?

281
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:42,139
我不是树
I am no tree!

282
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:44,569
我是树人
I am an Ent.

283
00:32:45,178 --> 00:32:47,271
牧树者
A tree-herder.

284
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:49,413
森林的守护者
A shepherd of the forest.

285
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:50,946
别跟他说话
Don't talk to it, Merry.

286
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:52,916
别鼓励他说话
Don't encourage it!

287
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:57,350
有些人叫我树须
Treebeard, some call me.

288
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,490
你站在哪一边？
And whose side are you on?

289
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,717
哪一边？
Side?

290
00:33:01,994 --> 00:33:04,792
我不站在哪一边
I am on nobody's side...

291
00:33:05,231 --> 00:33:10,498
因为没有人站在我这一边小半兽人
...because nobody's on my side, little Orc.

292
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,898
没有人关心这片森林
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

293
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,707
我们是哈比人，不是半兽人
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

294
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:21,175
哈比人？
Hobbits? Hmm.

295
00:33:22,482 --> 00:33:27,283
我没听过哈比人这玩意
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

296
00:33:28,554 --> 00:33:32,991
听起来像是半兽人的幌子
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

297
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:35,353
他们拿着火把
They come with fire.

298
00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:38,119
还有斧头闯进来
They come with axes.

299
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:43,130
又咬又啃、又砍又烧
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!

300
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:47,100
-毁灭者、掠夺者，诅咒他们-不
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them! - No!

301
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:50,170
你不明白，我们是哈比人
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

302
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:52,172
半身人
Halflings!

303
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:53,469
夏尔人
Shire-folk!

304
00:33:53,713 --> 00:33:55,977
你们也许是
Maybe you are...

305
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:59,910
也许不是
...and maybe you aren't.

306
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:04,921
白袍巫师一定知道
The White Wizard will know.

307
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:07,657
白袍巫师？
The White Wizard?

308
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:10,729
萨鲁曼
Saruman.

309
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:24,936
瞧，瞧
See? See?

310
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:27,543
我们把你们带出来了
We've led you out.

311
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,248
快走呀，哈比人
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

312
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:35,854
我们找到你们真幸运
Very lucky we find you.

313
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,256
好哈比人
Nice Hobbit.

314
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:47,150
Oh!

315
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,397
沼泽他把我们带到一片臭沼泽
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

316
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:53,196
沼泽，没错
A swamp, yes, yes.

317
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,704
来吧，主人我们带你穿过迷雾走到安全处
Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist.

318
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,481
来吧，哈比人，快点走
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

319
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:10,347
这是我发现的
I found it. I did.

320
00:35:10,623 --> 00:35:13,217
我发现穿过沼泽的路
The way through the marshes.

321
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:16,928
半兽人不知道，也不会走
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

322
00:35:17,196 --> 00:35:21,189
他们都绕一大圈走远路
They go around for miles and miles.

323
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:22,799
快来吧
Come quickly.

324
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:27,062
我们要跟影子一样一闪而过
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

325
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:46,020
里面有死东西
There are dead things!

326
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:47,954
水里有死人的脸
Dead faces in the water.

327
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:56,734
都死了，都烂掉了
All dead. All rotten.

328
00:35:57,336 --> 00:36:00,999
精灵、人类和半兽人都一样
Elves and Men and Orcses.

329
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:04,868
很久以前这儿有一场大战
A great battle long ago.

330
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:07,406
死亡沼泽
Dead Marshes.

331
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,342
没错，这就是它的名字
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

332
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:13,779
走这儿
This way.

333
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,716
别跟着鬼火
Don't follow the lights.

334
00:36:17,016 --> 00:36:18,391
Oh.

335
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:22,324
小心，不然哈比人会跌进去
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...

336
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:26,622
自己也点亮小小的鬼火
...and light little candles of their own.

337
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:54,392
佛罗多！
Frodo!

338
00:37:38,904 --> 00:37:43,466
-咕鲁？-别跟着鬼火
- Gollum? - Don't follow the lights.

339
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:45,540
-咕鲁？-佛罗多！
Gollum! - Mr. Frodo!

340
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:47,575
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

341
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:19,410
好亮哦
So bright.

342
00:38:19,678 --> 00:38:23,409
好美哦
So beautiful.

343
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:27,415
我们的宝贝
Our precious.

344
00:38:28,954 --> 00:38:30,421
你说什么？
What did you say?

345
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,817
主人应该休息了
Master should be resting.

346
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:37,052
主人一定要保留体力
Master needs to keep up his strength.

347
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:42,262
-你是谁？-别问我们，这不关你事
- Who are you? - Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

348
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:43,968
咕鲁，咕鲁
Gollum. Gollum.

349
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:45,898
甘道夫说你以前是住河边的哈比人
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.

350
00:38:46,172 --> 00:38:50,165
冰透心、寒彻骨离乡背井真辛苦
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home

351
00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:51,910
他说你的一生很悲惨
He said your life was a sad story.

352
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:56,671
向前走、无退路日月星辰暗无光
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead

353
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:59,851
你以前也是一个哈比人
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.

354
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,781
对不对？
Were you?

355
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:06,217
史麦戈
Smeagol.

356
00:39:10,996 --> 00:39:13,464
你叫我什么？
What did you call me?

357
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:17,530
那曾是你的名字，对吧？
That was your name once, wasn't it?

358
00:39:18,204 --> 00:39:20,468
很久以前
A long time ago.

359
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:23,466
我的名字
My name.

360
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:26,042
我的名字

361
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:35,520
史麦戈
Smeagol.

362
00:39:39,658 --> 00:39:41,216
黑骑士
Black Riders!

363
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,722
快躲！快躲！
Hide! Hide!

364
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:55,602
快点，佛罗多
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

365
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:59,402
快，他们会看到我们
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

366
00:40:00,246 --> 00:40:02,840
-我以为他们死了-死了？
- I thought they were dead. - Dead?

367
00:40:03,082 --> 00:40:05,949
他们是不会死的
No, you cannot kill them. No.

368
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:34,203
戒灵！
Wraiths!

369
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,607
骑着飞兽的戒灵！
Wraiths on wings!

370
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:46,648
他们在召唤它
They are calling for it.

371
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:50,384
他们在召唤宝贝
They are calling for the precious.

372
00:40:52,598 --> 00:40:54,657
佛罗多，没事了
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

373
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:56,061
我在这儿
I'm here.

374
00:41:12,151 --> 00:41:13,641
快走吧，哈比人
Hurry, Hobbits.

375
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:18,121
黑门就快到了
The Black Gate is very close.

376
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:26,861
半兽人的血
Orc blood.

377
00:41:36,942 --> 00:41:38,637
这些足迹很奇怪
These are strange tracks.

378
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:41,947
这儿的空气好浓密
The air is so close in here.

379
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:45,514
这座森林很古老
This forest is old.

380
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:48,320
非常古老
Very old.

381
00:41:50,122 --> 00:41:52,352
充满了记忆
Full of memory...

382
00:41:55,027 --> 00:41:57,291
和愤怒
...and anger.

383
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:06,369
树木在互相交谈
The trees are speaking to each other.

384
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:08,004
金雳！
Gimli!

385
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:10,139
放下斧头
Lower your ax.

386
00:42:10,536 --> 00:42:12,537
Oh.

387
00:42:16,715 --> 00:42:18,114
有什么东西

388
00:42:24,757 --> 00:42:26,452
你看见什么？

389
00:42:27,126 --> 00:42:29,492
你看见什么？
The White Wizard approaches.

390
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:39,933
别让他说话，他会对我们下咒
Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.

391
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:51,810
动作要快
We must be quick.

392
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:10,994
你们在找两个小哈比人
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

393
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:13,001
他们在哪里？
Where are they?

394
00:43:13,272 --> 00:43:16,730
他们前天经过这里
They passed this way the day before yesterday.

395
00:43:17,009 --> 00:43:21,207
他们遇到料想不到的人物
They met someone they did not expect.

396
00:43:21,447 --> 00:43:23,506
这下你们放心了吗？
Does that comfort you?

397
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:25,649
你是谁？
Who are you?

398
00:43:27,186 --> 00:43:29,086
快现身！
Show yourself!

399
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,998
不可能
It cannot be.

400
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:50,740
你跌下去
You fell.

401
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:54,779
我跌入火海…
Through fire...

402
00:43:55,013 --> 00:43:56,241
…和深水
...and water.

403
00:43:57,783 --> 00:44:00,251
我从最深的地心到最高的山峰
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...

404
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:04,183
和魔苟斯的炎魔展开殊死战
...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

405
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:22,700
直到我击败强敌
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

406
00:44:22,975 --> 00:44:27,344
把他的尸身丢到山下
...and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

407
00:44:33,495 --> 00:44:35,986
我被黑暗吞蚀
Darkness took me...

408
00:44:36,798 --> 00:44:40,825
不知道失去意识多久
...and I strayed out of thought and time.

409
00:44:41,636 --> 00:44:44,662
日换星移
Stars wheeled overhead...

410
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:49,410
每一天都像一辈子一样漫长
...and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.

411
00:44:51,613 --> 00:44:53,638
但是这并不是结束
But it was not the end.

412
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,746
我终于重获新生
I felt life in me again.

413
00:44:58,753 --> 00:45:01,221
我被送回来…
I've been sent back...

414
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:02,946
…   完成使命
...until my task is done.

415
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,289
甘道夫
Gandalf.

416
00:45:06,027 --> 00:45:07,961
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

417
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,159
是的
Yes.

418
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,730
我以前叫做甘道夫
That was what they used to call me.

419
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:19,867
灰袍巫师甘道夫
Gandalf the Grey.

420
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:22,938
那是我以前的名字
That was my name.

421
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,543
甘道夫
Gandalf.

422
00:45:26,615 --> 00:45:28,583
我现在是白袍巫师甘道夫
I am Gandalf the White.

423
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,712
我在危急时刻…
And I come back to you now...

424
00:45:34,956 --> 00:45:37,424
…回来帮助你们
...at the turn of the tide.

425
00:45:37,626 --> 00:45:40,527
你们的旅程开启了全新的一页
One stage of your journey is over. Another begins.

426
00:45:40,762 --> 00:45:45,062
洛汗国即将面临大战我们必须尽快赶到伊多拉斯
War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.

427
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:08,654
那是米亚拉斯神驹
That is one of the Mearas...

428
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,620
除非我被下了咒看错了
...unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.

429
00:46:29,277 --> 00:46:31,472
这是影疾
Shadowfax.

430
00:46:34,115 --> 00:46:36,675
他是马中之王
He is the lord of all horses...

431
00:46:38,386 --> 00:46:42,254
他陪伴我度过重重难关
...and has been my friend through many dangers.

432
00:46:56,972 --> 00:47:01,068
我的家在森林深处
My home lies deep in the forest...

433
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:05,143
靠近山脚的地方
...near the roots of the mountain.

434
00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:11,085
我答应甘道夫要保护你们安全
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

435
00:47:11,353 --> 00:47:15,153
我一定会好好保护你们
And safe is where I'll keep you.

436
00:47:16,024 --> 00:47:19,721
树木变得狂野危险
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.

437
00:47:20,362 --> 00:47:23,456
他们心中燃起熊熊怒火
Anger festers in their hearts.

438
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:26,189
很可能会伤害你们
They will harm you if they can.

439
00:47:27,202 --> 00:47:30,296
树人的数量越来越少
There are too few of us now.

440
00:47:30,538 --> 00:47:35,271
想要约束树木也越来越难
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

441
00:47:43,284 --> 00:47:48,085
魔多的黑门
The Black Gate of Mordor.

442
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:53,427
我的天
Oh, save us.

443
00:47:59,234 --> 00:48:02,397
要是我老爸看到我们现在这样一定会碎碎念
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.

444
00:48:04,706 --> 00:48:09,109
主人说他要到魔多
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.

445
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,711
史麦戈就乖乖带主人去
So good Smeagol does, master says so.

446
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:14,073
没错
I did.

447
00:48:22,924 --> 00:48:24,892
没办法了
That's it, then.

448
00:48:26,494 --> 00:48:27,722
我们闯不进去
We can't get past that.

449
00:49:12,974 --> 00:49:14,236
你看
Look!

450
00:49:14,476 --> 00:49:15,875
城门
The gate.

451
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:17,237
它打开了
It's opening!

452
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,653
下面有路
I can see a way down.

453
00:49:27,455 --> 00:49:29,514
山姆，不！
Sam, no!

454
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,057
主人！
Master!

455
00:50:56,945 --> 00:51:00,403
-我并没有要你跟我一起来-我知道
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam. - I know, Mr. Frodo.

456
00:51:01,282 --> 00:51:04,342
我看到了里面就算披精灵斗蓬也没有用
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

457
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,650
-去吧-不
- Now! - No!

458
00:51:07,288 --> 00:51:09,222
不行，主人
No! No, master!

459
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:12,392
他们会抓到你
They catch you! They catch you!

460
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:16,219
别把它交给他
Don't take it to him.

461
00:51:19,234 --> 00:51:21,896
他想要宝贝
He wants the precious.

462
00:51:22,136 --> 00:51:25,105
他一直在找它
Always he is looking for it.

463
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:29,174
宝贝也想回到他手上
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.

464
00:51:29,444 --> 00:51:33,312
但是我们不能让他拿去
But we mustn't let him have it.

465
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:41,814
不行，有另一条路
No! There's another way.

466
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:44,650
更隐密、更黑暗的路
More secret. A dark way.

467
00:51:45,026 --> 00:51:48,621
-你为什么不早说？-因为主人没有问
- Why haven't you spoken of this before? - Because master did not ask.

468
00:51:49,163 --> 00:51:50,187
他在动歪脑筋
He's up to something.

469
00:51:50,865 --> 00:51:53,390
你是说有另一条路到魔多？
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?

470
00:51:53,635 --> 00:51:56,297
对，有一条小路
Yes. There's a path...

471
00:51:56,537 --> 00:51:59,005
和一些阶梯
...and some stairs.

472
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:00,799
然后…
And then...

473
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:04,307
…有一条隧道
...a tunnel.

474
00:52:18,393 --> 00:52:20,122
他都带我们到这儿了
He's led us this far, Sam.

475
00:52:20,361 --> 00:52:21,692
佛罗多，不行
Mr. Frodo, no.

476
00:52:22,897 --> 00:52:24,296
他信守他的承诺
He's been true to his word.

477
00:52:29,237 --> 00:52:30,363
不要
No.

478
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,098
带路吧，史麦戈
Lead the way, Smeagol.

479
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:38,644
史麦戈总是很乐意帮忙
Good Smeagol always helps.

480
00:53:05,273 --> 00:53:09,107
伊多拉斯以及梅杜西金殿
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

481
00:53:09,877 --> 00:53:12,471
洛汗国国王希优顿的皇宫
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

482
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:16,114
他的身心受到蛊惑
...whose mind is overthrown.

483
00:53:16,351 --> 00:53:20,549
萨鲁曼控制了希优顿
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

484
00:53:21,255 --> 00:53:24,349
王上，您的儿子…
My lord, your son...

485
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:26,719
…他死了
...he is dead.

486
00:53:28,296 --> 00:53:30,025
王上？
My lord?

487
00:53:31,366 --> 00:53:32,458
叔叔？
Uncle?

488
00:53:39,307 --> 00:53:41,502
您不去看他？
Will you not go to him?

489
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,011
您什么也不做吗？
Will you do nothing?

490
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:49,181
谨言慎行
Be careful what you say.

491
00:53:49,484 --> 00:53:51,509
我们不受欢迎
Do not look for welcome here.

492
00:54:15,676 --> 00:54:19,772
他一定是昨晚去世的
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.

493
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,107
国王在一夜间失去独子
What a tragedy for the king...

494
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:25,318
和王储真是不幸
...to lose his only son and heir.

495
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:30,947
我知道他的死一定让你很难过
I understand. His passing is hard to accept.

496
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:36,027
尤其是你的兄长也弃你不顾
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.

497
00:54:36,264 --> 00:54:37,663
让我一个人静一静
Leave me alone, snake!

498
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,758
你的确是孤零零的一个人
Oh, but you are alone.

499
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:47,169
天晓得你在黑暗中
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...

500
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:50,742
受了多少煎熬
...in the bitter watches of the night...

501
00:54:50,978 --> 00:54:54,607
你的生命一点一滴地凋谢枯萎
...when all your life seems to shrink.

502
00:54:54,882 --> 00:54:59,012
你受到四面高墙禁锢
The walls of your bower closing in about you.

503
00:54:59,253 --> 00:55:03,747
如同笼中鸟一般渴望自由
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

504
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,891
这么美丽
So fair.

505
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:10,527
却如此冷漠
So cold.

506
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:14,527
就像寒冬过后的春泉
Like a morning of pale spring...

507
00:55:14,802 --> 00:55:18,169
依然那么地冰冷
...still clinging to winter's chill.

508
00:55:31,986 --> 00:55:34,386
你的话是毒药
Your words are poison.

509
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:09,414
就连墓园都比这儿有生气
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

510
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:23,697
Ah.

511
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:27,629
你们不能带武器见希优顿王灰袍巫师甘道夫
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

512
00:57:29,203 --> 00:57:31,694
这是葛力马巧言之令
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

513
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,785
你的手杖
Your staff.

514
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,698
你就让一个老人带着手杖吧
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.

515
00:58:16,584 --> 00:58:19,382
王上，灰袍巫师甘道夫来了
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

516
00:58:27,762 --> 00:58:29,252
他是恶兆的信差
He's a herald of woe.

517
00:58:29,497 --> 00:58:33,866
你近来似乎不太欢迎来访者
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...

518
00:58:35,036 --> 00:58:36,401
希优顿王
...Theoden King.

519
00:58:37,171 --> 00:58:39,639
你不欢迎他
He's not welcome.

520
00:58:40,608 --> 00:58:45,841
我为什么要欢迎你？
Why should I welcome you...

521
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:50,008
乌鸦嘴甘道夫
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

522
00:58:50,284 --> 00:58:53,515
说得好，王上
A just question, my liege.

523
00:58:53,754 --> 00:58:56,552
时候这么晚
Late is the hour...

524
00:58:56,791 --> 00:59:00,693
这名江湖术士却突然跑来
...in which this conjurer chooses to appear.

525
00:59:01,562 --> 00:59:03,553
我替他取名为噩耗
Lathspell I name him.

526
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:06,631
噩耗就是不受欢迎的恶客
Ill news is an ill guest.

527
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:11,361
给我闭嘴别在这儿挑拨是非
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

528
00:59:11,605 --> 00:59:13,470
我通过烈焰和死亡的试炼
I have not passed through fire and death...

529
00:59:13,674 --> 00:59:16,837
不是为了跟蠢材做口舌之争
...to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.

530
00:59:17,878 --> 00:59:19,937
他的手杖
His staff.

531
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:24,241
我叫你们没收巫师的手杖
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

532
00:59:27,688 --> 00:59:29,553
希优顿
Theoden...

533
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,682
塞哲尔之子
...son of Thengel...

534
00:59:34,528 --> 00:59:36,826
你活在阴影底下太久了
...too long have you sat in the Shadows.

535
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:43,064
你最好乖乖别动
I would stay still if I were you.

536
00:59:43,304 --> 00:59:45,329
听我说
Hearken to me!

537
00:59:50,845 --> 00:59:52,938
我把你从咒语中…
I release you...

538
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,114
…释放出来
...from the spell.

539
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:09,696
你在这里没有力量
You have no power here...

540
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:13,491
灰袍巫师甘道夫
...Gandalf the Grey.

541
01:00:18,939 --> 01:00:23,933
萨鲁曼，我要把你逼出来就像把剧毒逼出伤口
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.

542
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:34,921
慢着
Wait.

543
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:40,190
我一走希优顿就会死
If I go, Theoden dies.

544
01:00:40,961 --> 01:00:43,088
你杀不了我
You did not kill me...

545
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:45,457
更杀不了他
...you will not kill him.

546
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,064
洛汗国是我的
Rohan is mine.

547
01:00:52,573 --> 01:00:53,835
快走吧
Be gone.

548
01:01:38,452 --> 01:01:40,511
我认得你的脸
I know your face.

549
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,353
伊欧文
Eowyn.

550
01:01:48,729 --> 01:01:49,923
伊欧文

551
01:01:58,272 --> 01:01:59,398
甘道夫？
Gandalf?

552
01:01:59,974 --> 01:02:02,772
呼吸自由空气吧，老友
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

553
01:02:16,257 --> 01:02:18,782
我仿佛做了一场噩梦
Dark have been my dreams of late.

554
01:02:22,997 --> 01:02:26,694
只要你握住宝剑
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...

555
01:02:26,934 --> 01:02:29,835
从前的力量就会回来
...if they grasped your sword.

556
01:03:15,015 --> 01:03:16,915
王上
I've only...

557
01:03:17,184 --> 01:03:20,153
我自始至终只想服侍您
...ever served you, my lord.

558
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:25,358
你只想用邪术让我像小狗一样趴在你脚下
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!

559
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,292
请别放逐我
Send me not from your sight.

560
01:03:30,664 --> 01:03:33,326
不，王上
No, my lord! No, my lord.

561
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,727
饶了他吧
Let him go.

562
01:03:35,502 --> 01:03:38,665
已经流了太多血了
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.

563
01:03:40,174 --> 01:03:42,438
给我滚开
Get out of my way!

564
01:03:44,745 --> 01:03:47,839
吾王希优顿
Hail, Theoden King!

565
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:15,041
希优德呢？
Where is Theodred?

566
01:04:18,078 --> 01:04:20,569
我儿子呢？
Where is my son?

567
01:04:24,518 --> 01:04:26,179
永志花
Simbelmyne.

568
01:04:31,392 --> 01:04:34,919
它一直生长在先王的坟上
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.

569
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:41,733
现在也将永远覆盖吾儿之墓
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

570
01:04:43,937 --> 01:04:47,737
厄运竟然降临在我身上
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

571
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:52,876
少年英年早逝、老人苟延残喘
The young perish and the old linger.

572
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,571
而我竟然要眼睁睁看着
That I should live...

573
01:04:55,849 --> 01:04:59,148
洛汗国断送在我手上
...to see the last days of my house.

574
01:05:00,454 --> 01:05:04,254
希优德的死不是你的错
Theodred's death was not of your making.

575
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:10,694
白发人不该送黑发人
No parent should have to bury their child.

576
01:05:27,481 --> 01:05:29,278
他生前很坚强
He was strong in life.

577
01:05:30,451 --> 01:05:33,909
他在死后也将与你的先王同在
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.

578
01:06:18,632 --> 01:06:20,463
他们毫无预警
They had no warning.

579
01:06:20,701 --> 01:06:23,033
手无寸铁
They were unarmed.

580
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:27,529
现在野人正穿越西谷烧毁一路上的一切
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.

581
01:06:28,509 --> 01:06:30,409
干草、茅屋和树木
Rick, cot and tree.

582
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,939
妈妈呢？
- Where is Mama? - Shh.

583
01:06:33,814 --> 01:06:37,978
这只是萨鲁曼大军的一小部份
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.

584
01:06:38,218 --> 01:06:42,552
他和索伦结盟后势力会更强大
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.

585
01:06:44,224 --> 01:06:47,159
你必须正面迎敌
Ride out and meet him head-on.

586
01:06:47,961 --> 01:06:51,397
引开他的大军，保护老弱妇孺
Draw him away from your women and children.

587
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:53,357
你一定要开战
You must fight.

588
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,366
目前有两千名士兵向北而来
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.

589
01:06:57,604 --> 01:06:59,162
伊欧墨对你忠心耿耿
Eomer is loyal to you.

590
01:06:59,373 --> 01:07:02,001
他会率领部下回来为骠骑王奋战
His men will return and fight for their king.

591
01:07:02,242 --> 01:07:06,076
他们离这儿有三百里格
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.

592
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:12,011
伊欧墨也救不了我们
Eomer cannot help us.

593
01:07:12,686 --> 01:07:14,415
我知道你要我怎么做
I know what it is you want of me...

594
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:17,852
但是我不能让人民白白送死
...but I will not bring further death to my people.

595
01:07:19,593 --> 01:07:21,220
我不想冒险全面开战
I will not risk open war.

596
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:26,796
敌人已向你宣战不管你想不想冒险
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.

597
01:07:31,138 --> 01:07:32,696
就我所知
When last I looked...

598
01:07:33,173 --> 01:07:36,734
我希优顿才是洛汗国国王不是亚拉冈
...Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.

599
01:07:43,717 --> 01:07:45,912
国王的命令是什么？
Then what is the king's decision?

600
01:07:51,558 --> 01:07:52,820
国王下令
By order of the king...

601
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,459
全城军民撤退
...the city must empty.

602
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:58,494
撤退到圣盔谷碉堡
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

603
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:02,700
不要携带笨重的财宝只要带必需品
Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.

604
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:04,437
圣盔谷
Helm's Deep.

605
01:08:04,638 --> 01:08:08,096
他应该跟敌人一决死战而不是逃之夭夭
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.

606
01:08:08,308 --> 01:08:10,208
一国之君就应该捍卫人民
Who will defend them if not their king?

607
01:08:10,444 --> 01:08:12,844
他这么做也是为了人民着想
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.

608
01:08:13,113 --> 01:08:14,808
圣盔谷以前救过他们一命
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.

609
01:08:15,082 --> 01:08:18,916
那道峡谷无路可退希优顿这是自寻死路
There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap.

610
01:08:19,152 --> 01:08:21,279
他认为他们在那儿很安全
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

611
01:08:21,521 --> 01:08:23,614
但是他们会惨遭屠杀
What they will get is a massacre.

612
01:08:25,225 --> 01:08:27,693
希优顿很固执，我替他担忧
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.

613
01:08:28,595 --> 01:08:31,860
我也担心洛汗国会灭亡
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

614
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,197
亚拉冈，他需要你的帮助
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.

615
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,466
洛汗国人民也需要你
The people of Rohan will need you.

616
01:08:38,872 --> 01:08:41,272
你们要挡住敌人的攻势
The defenses have to hold.

617
01:08:42,776 --> 01:08:44,437
一定挡得住
They will hold.

618
01:08:48,548 --> 01:08:50,778
灰袍圣徒
The Grey Pilgrim.

619
01:08:51,018 --> 01:08:53,543
他们以前都这么叫我
That's what they used to call me.

620
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:58,848
我在世上活了三百辈子现在的时间却不够用
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.

621
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:02,654
希望我能找到救兵
With luck, my search will not be in vain.

622
01:09:03,263 --> 01:09:06,494
五天后等待我的出现
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

623
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:10,062
破晓时向东方看
At dawn, look to the east.

624
01:09:10,304 --> 01:09:11,794
去吧
Go.

625
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:50,073
你的剑法不错
You have some skill with a blade.

626
01:09:58,685 --> 01:10:00,676
这儿的女人很早就知道
Women of this country learned long ago:

627
01:10:00,954 --> 01:10:03,514
没拿剑的人一样会死于剑下
Those without swords can still die upon them.

628
01:10:03,757 --> 01:10:05,520
我不怕死也不怕痛
I fear neither death nor pain.

629
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:08,886
那么你怕什么？
What do you fear, my lady?

630
01:10:12,332 --> 01:10:14,095
被困在牢笼
A cage.

631
01:10:15,469 --> 01:10:19,235
直到老死才接受这个命运
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.

632
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:23,273
到时候就没有机会证明我的英勇
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.

633
01:10:26,813 --> 01:10:28,747
你是王女
You're a daughter of kings...

634
01:10:30,117 --> 01:10:33,348
也是骠骑女战士
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

635
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:41,160
那不会是你的命运
I do not think that would be your fate.

636
01:11:14,628 --> 01:11:17,597
希优顿不会留在伊多拉斯
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

637
01:11:17,831 --> 01:11:19,856
他很清楚那儿不安全
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

638
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,933
他知道王都将受到攻击
He will expect an attack on the city.

639
01:11:24,304 --> 01:11:27,501
他们会逃到圣盔谷
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

640
01:11:27,707 --> 01:11:29,971
洛汗国的堡垒
...the great fortress of Rohan.

641
01:11:31,244 --> 01:11:35,613
前往圣盔谷的山路崎岖危险
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.

642
01:11:37,117 --> 01:11:38,778
前进速度会很缓慢
They will be slow.

643
01:11:39,219 --> 01:11:43,588
他们当中也会有老弱妇孺
They will have women and children with them.

644
01:11:47,527 --> 01:11:49,722
派出狼骑士
Send out your Warg-riders.

645
01:12:04,644 --> 01:12:07,477
臭东西，别走得太远
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.

646
01:12:07,747 --> 01:12:10,307
-你为什么那样？-怎样？
- Why do you do that? - What?

647
01:12:10,584 --> 01:12:13,052
一直骂他，不断找他碴
Call him names. Run him down all the time.

648
01:12:13,553 --> 01:12:15,487
因为
Because.

649
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,183
因为他很坏
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

650
01:12:19,426 --> 01:12:21,553
他只会说谎和欺骗
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.

651
01:12:22,062 --> 01:12:24,758
他想要魔戒，他只在乎魔戒
It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.

652
01:12:24,998 --> 01:12:27,193
你不知道魔戒对他的折磨
You have no idea what it did to him...

653
01:12:27,434 --> 01:12:29,902
到现在还在折磨他
...what it's still doing to him.

654
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,164
我想要帮助他
I want to help him, Sam.

655
01:12:34,374 --> 01:12:35,568
为什么？
Why?

656
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:44,007
因为我必须相信他会变好
Because I have to believe he can come back.

657
01:12:48,355 --> 01:12:50,220
你救不了他的
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

658
01:12:50,457 --> 01:12:53,119
你懂个屁？你啥也不懂
What do you know about it? Nothing!

659
01:13:00,133 --> 01:13:04,263
对不起我不知道我是怎么搞的
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.

660
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,230
我知道
I do.

661
01:13:08,308 --> 01:13:10,105
都是因为魔戒
It's the Ring.

662
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:12,234
你的视线离不开它
You can't take your eyes off it.

663
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:14,979
我看到你
I've seen you.

664
01:13:15,515 --> 01:13:19,281
你不吃不喝不睡觉
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

665
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:23,282
它控制了你的心智
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

666
01:13:23,523 --> 01:13:26,151
-你一定要反抗-我知道我该怎么做
- You have to fight it. - I know what I have to do, Sam.

667
01:13:26,393 --> 01:13:29,260
魔戒被交到我手上
The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task.

668
01:13:29,496 --> 01:13:31,157
这是我一个人的
Mine! My own!

669
01:13:32,065 --> 01:13:34,124
你听听你自己
Can't you hear yourself?

670
01:13:34,367 --> 01:13:35,959
你知道你听起来像谁吗？
Don't you know who you sound like?

671
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:48,338
我们要它
We wants it.

672
01:13:48,615 --> 01:13:51,209
我们需要它
We needs it.

673
01:13:51,484 --> 01:13:56,217
我们一定要得到宝贝
Must have the precious.

674
01:13:56,456 --> 01:13:59,823
他们从我们身上把它偷走
They stole it from us.

675
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,359
鬼鬼祟祟的小哈比人
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

676
01:14:03,597 --> 01:14:07,431
奸诈狡猾、虚伪做作
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

677
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:10,864
不，主人不会这样
No. Not master.

678
01:14:11,104 --> 01:14:14,870
才怪，他最虚伪了
Yes, precious. False.

679
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:19,512
他们会说谎欺骗你、伤害你
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

680
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:23,147
主人是我的朋友
Master's my friend.

681
01:14:23,383 --> 01:14:28,377
你没有朋友，没有人喜欢你
You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you.

682
01:14:29,723 --> 01:14:32,191
不听，我不听
Not listening. I'm not listening.

683
01:14:32,392 --> 01:14:36,328
你是个骗子和小偷
You're a liar and a thief.

684
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:38,520
不是
No.

685
01:14:39,499 --> 01:14:42,332
杀人凶手
Murderer.

686
01:14:44,871 --> 01:14:45,838
走开
Go away.

687
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:48,337
你要我走开？
Go away?

688
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:53,140
我恨你
I hate you.

689
01:14:53,413 --> 01:14:55,745
我恨你

690
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:59,347
没有我哪会有你？咕鲁，咕鲁
Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum.

691
01:14:59,586 --> 01:15:01,349
我救了我们
I saved us.

692
01:15:01,588 --> 01:15:06,048
都是我的功劳都是我让我们活下来
It was me. We survived because of me.

693
01:15:07,327 --> 01:15:10,854
我现在不必靠你了
Not anymore.

694
01:15:12,265 --> 01:15:13,755
你说什么？
What did you say?

695
01:15:15,902 --> 01:15:19,668
主人会照顾我们
Master looks after us now.

696
01:15:19,873 --> 01:15:23,309
我们不需要你
We don't need you.

697
01:15:24,077 --> 01:15:25,567
什么？
What?

698
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:27,507
你走吧
Leave now...

699
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:31,512
再也别回来
...and never come back.

700
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:32,683
不
No.

701
01:15:33,286 --> 01:15:37,416
快走，别再回来
Leave now and never come back.

702
01:15:40,093 --> 01:15:45,929
你走吧，别再回来了
Leave now and never come back!

703
01:15:57,944 --> 01:16:00,572
我们叫他走
We told him to go away.

704
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:03,748
他就走了，宝贝
And away he goes, precious.

705
01:16:03,983 --> 01:16:05,883
他走了！他走了！
Gone! Gone! Gone!

706
01:16:06,152 --> 01:16:07,915
史麦戈自由了！
Smeagol is free!

707
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:14,326
你瞧
Look.

708
01:16:14,527 --> 01:16:18,964
你看史麦戈找到什么
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

709
01:16:28,508 --> 01:16:29,873
他们很新鲜
They are young.

710
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:32,578
肉也很嫩，很好吃哦
They are tender. They are nice.

711
01:16:32,812 --> 01:16:36,270
没错，快吃了他们吧
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

712
01:16:39,085 --> 01:16:40,575
如果你让他吃下去
You'll make him sick, you will...

713
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:44,015
只会害他生病
...behaving like that.

714
01:16:46,493 --> 01:16:49,189
兔肉只有一种煮法
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.

715
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:54,623
你在干嘛？
What's it doing?

716
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,996
又蠢又肥的哈比人
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

717
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,365
你糟蹋了兔肉
It ruins it.

718
01:17:00,573 --> 01:17:04,134
哪里会？根本就没有肉
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.

719
01:17:08,381 --> 01:17:10,849
如果有洋芋就更棒
What we need is a few good taters.

720
01:17:11,818 --> 01:17:14,787
洋芋是什么东西？
What's taters, precious?

721
01:17:15,054 --> 01:17:16,715
洋芋是什么？
What's taters? Eh?

722
01:17:16,956 --> 01:17:18,617
就是马铃薯
Po-ta-toes.

723
01:17:19,025 --> 01:17:22,188
煮成洋芋泥、跟肉一起炖
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.

724
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:29,201
或是炸成金黄色的洋芋片配一块酥脆的炸鱼
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.

725
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:32,401
就连你都无法抗拒
Even you couldn't say no to that.

726
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:34,899
我们当然可以抗拒
Oh, yes, we could.

727
01:17:35,141 --> 01:17:38,577
白白地糟蹋一条鲜鱼
Spoil a nice fish.

728
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:42,471
生鱼才够赞
Give it to us raw...

729
01:17:42,749 --> 01:17:45,684
活蹦乱跳的生鱼
...and wriggling.

730
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:49,012
你自己吃臭洋芋片吧
You keep nasty chips.

731
01:17:50,023 --> 01:17:52,014
你真是没救
You're hopeless.

732
01:18:04,604 --> 01:18:06,071
佛罗多？
Mr. Frodo?

733
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:26,584
-他们是什么人？-坏蛋
Who are they? Wicked Men.

734
01:18:26,826 --> 01:18:29,226
索伦的爪牙
Servants of Sauron.

735
01:18:30,096 --> 01:18:32,223
他们被叫到魔多
They are called to Mordor.

736
01:18:32,465 --> 01:18:35,434
黑暗魔君在集结邪恶大军
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.

737
01:18:35,668 --> 01:18:38,762
他很快就会准备好
It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.

738
01:18:40,373 --> 01:18:43,968
-准备做什么？-展开大战
- Ready to do what? - To make his war.

739
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:49,307
最后一场大战将让黑暗笼罩大地
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.

740
01:18:49,682 --> 01:18:52,651
我们得赶路，来吧，山姆
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

741
01:18:52,919 --> 01:18:54,079
佛罗多
Mr. Frodo.

742
01:18:54,654 --> 01:18:56,212
你看
Look.

743
01:18:59,893 --> 01:19:02,157
那是猛犸
It's an oliphaunt.

744
01:19:10,403 --> 01:19:13,372
老家的人绝对不会相信
No one at home will believe this.

745
01:19:24,584 --> 01:19:26,381
史麦戈？
Smeagol?

746
01:20:06,826 --> 01:20:09,226
我们逗留太久了
We've lingered here too long.

747
01:20:12,298 --> 01:20:13,560
走吧，山姆
Come on, Sam.

748
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:17,111
Aye!

749
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:32,084
绑住他们的双手
Bind their hands.

750
01:20:41,227 --> 01:20:43,889
没错，女矮人是很少见
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.

751
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,725
老实说，她们的长相和声音
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance...

752
01:20:47,967 --> 01:20:51,061
常常被误认为男矮人
...that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

753
01:20:51,537 --> 01:20:53,368
因为她们也有胡子
It's the beards.

754
01:20:53,606 --> 01:20:55,665
甚至有人相信
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...

755
01:20:55,908 --> 01:20:58,706
女矮人根本不存在
...that there are no Dwarf women...

756
01:20:58,945 --> 01:21:03,143
矮人都是从地洞蹦出来的
...and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground...

757
01:21:04,917 --> 01:21:06,714
这当然是无稽之谈
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

758
01:21:12,892 --> 01:21:15,087
我没事，别紧张
GIMLl: It's all right. Nobody panic.

759
01:21:15,595 --> 01:21:18,462
我是故意凸槌的
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

760
01:21:36,849 --> 01:21:40,910
暮星的光芒不会减弱
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.

761
01:21:41,754 --> 01:21:45,121
我想要给谁就给谁
It is mine to give to whom I will.

762
01:21:47,026 --> 01:21:49,358
就像我的心一样
Like my heart.

763
01:21:50,863 --> 01:21:53,491
快睡吧
Go to sleep.

764
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:56,201
我已经睡着了
I am asleep.

765
01:22:02,675 --> 01:22:04,540
这只是一场梦
This is a dream.

766
01:22:06,879 --> 01:22:09,973
那么这一定是美梦
Then it is a good dream.

767
01:22:22,095 --> 01:22:24,120
睡吧
Sleep.

768
01:22:49,188 --> 01:22:50,655
你曾告诉我

769
01:22:53,192 --> 01:22:55,285
这一天会来到

770
01:22:56,295 --> 01:22:58,957
这不是结束，而是开始

771
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:01,223
你一定要跟佛罗多去

772
01:23:02,068 --> 01:23:04,127
这是你要走的路

773
01:23:14,514 --> 01:23:17,176
我看不见我要走的路

774
01:23:17,984 --> 01:23:21,420
你要走的路已经在你眼前

775
01:23:21,687 --> 01:23:24,952
你不能犹豫不定

776
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,991
亚文
Arwen...

777
01:23:31,564 --> 01:23:33,691
如果你什么都不相信

778
01:23:34,233 --> 01:23:36,224
那就相信真心

779
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:39,463
相信我们俩

780
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,274
她在哪里？
Where is she?

781
01:24:21,547 --> 01:24:23,913
给你那枚宝石的女人？
The woman who gave you that jewel.

782
01:24:27,286 --> 01:24:29,982
我们的时代结束了
Our time here is ending.

783
01:24:30,723 --> 01:24:33,214
亚文也要离开
Arwen's time is ending.

784
01:24:34,026 --> 01:24:35,220
让她走吧
Let her go.

785
01:24:35,461 --> 01:24:37,429
让她坐船前往西方
Let her take the ship into the west.

786
01:24:37,663 --> 01:24:40,655
让她带着对你的爱到海外仙境
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.

787
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,629
她对你的爱将永远常青
There it will be ever green.

788
01:24:44,203 --> 01:24:46,501
但是她只有回忆
But never more than memory.

789
01:24:47,807 --> 01:24:50,776
我不会让我女儿留下来等死
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

790
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:54,571
-她是心存希望才会留下来-她是为了你才留下来
- She stays because she still has hope. - She stays for you.

791
01:24:54,847 --> 01:24:57,042
她应该跟她的族人在一起
She belongs with her people.

792
01:25:02,655 --> 01:25:05,852
你有机会过另一种生活

793
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:12,297
远离战争、伤痛和绝望

794
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,662
你为什么要我走？
Why are you saying this?

795
01:25:16,302 --> 01:25:19,430
我是凡人，你是精灵
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

796
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:24,938
这只是一场梦
It was a dream, Arwen.

797
01:25:25,177 --> 01:25:26,735
一场美梦
Nothing more.

798
01:25:35,688 --> 01:25:37,451
这属于你
This belongs to you.

799
01:25:40,293 --> 01:25:41,817
这是送你的礼物
It was a gift.

800
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:45,997
留着它
Keep it.

801
01:25:48,567 --> 01:25:49,693
大人？
My lord?

802
01:25:52,538 --> 01:25:57,032
她要跟其他的精灵坐船到海外仙境
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.

803
01:26:20,599 --> 01:26:21,998
怎么了？
What is it?

804
01:26:23,569 --> 01:26:25,560
-哈犸？-我不确定
- Hama? - I'm not sure.

805
01:26:42,188 --> 01:26:44,179
座狼
Wargs!

806
01:26:56,769 --> 01:26:58,396
他是斥候
A scout!

807
01:27:04,744 --> 01:27:07,212
-怎么了？那是什么？-狼骑士，我们受到攻击
- What is it? What do you see? - Warg! We're under attack!

808
01:27:08,647 --> 01:27:10,740
座狼来袭
Get them out of here!

809
01:27:15,588 --> 01:27:17,522
骑士全都到前锋
All riders to the head of the column.

810
01:27:18,324 --> 01:27:20,258
快让我上去，我也是骑士
GIMLl: Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

811
01:27:20,493 --> 01:27:22,154
快点
Come on!

812
01:27:34,006 --> 01:27:36,372
你快带人民到圣盔谷，快去
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

813
01:27:36,642 --> 01:27:38,041
-我可以作战-不行
- I can fight. - No!

814
01:27:40,846 --> 01:27:42,814
你要为了我带他们走
You must do this, for me.

815
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:46,407
跟我来
Follow me! Hyah!

816
01:27:50,022 --> 01:27:54,254
-前进，我是说向前冲-快到低地
GIMLl: Forward. I mean, charge forward. Make for the lower ground!

817
01:27:54,527 --> 01:27:57,121
-很好，快呀-聚在一起
- That's it! Go on! - Stay together!

818
01:29:09,101 --> 01:29:11,331
快来领死吧
GIMLl: Bring your pretty face to my ax.

819
01:29:14,173 --> 01:29:15,663
那一只算我的
That one counts as mine!

820
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:34,016
臭东西
Stinking creature.

821
01:31:01,318 --> 01:31:03,149
亚拉冈
Aragorn!

822
01:31:07,924 --> 01:31:09,323
亚拉冈？
Aragorn?

823
01:31:23,373 --> 01:31:26,240
快说他怎么了我就让你死得痛快
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.

824
01:31:26,443 --> 01:31:27,808
他…
He's...

825
01:31:28,445 --> 01:31:29,969
…死了
...dead.

826
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,513
他跌下悬崖
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

827
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:38,448
你说谎
You lie.

828
01:32:12,455 --> 01:32:13,945
把伤者放到马背上
Get the wounded on horses.

829
01:32:15,358 --> 01:32:18,452
艾辛格的座狼会再回来
The wolves of Isengard will return.

830
01:32:18,928 --> 01:32:20,987
把死者留下来
Leave the dead.

831
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:29,938
来吧
Come.

832
01:32:40,116 --> 01:32:41,640
-终于到了-圣盔谷
At last! Helm's Deep.

833
01:32:41,918 --> 01:32:44,751
到了，圣盔谷
There it is, Helm's Deep.

834
01:32:47,357 --> 01:32:49,120
我们安全了
We're safe!

835
01:32:50,694 --> 01:32:53,492
我们安全了，王女
We're safe, my lady.

836
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:54,856
谢谢你
Thank you.

837
01:33:39,242 --> 01:33:40,573
-妈妈-伊欧参！
Mama! Eothain!

838
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:42,300
斐黛！
Freda!

839
01:33:46,683 --> 01:33:50,414
迎接希优顿，迎接骠骑王
Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king.

840
01:33:58,428 --> 01:34:02,091
好少人，回来的人好少
So few. So few of you have returned.

841
01:34:04,934 --> 01:34:07,129
我们的人民安全了
Our people are safe.

842
01:34:08,538 --> 01:34:11,029
但是却牺牲很多条人命
We have paid for it with many lives.

843
01:34:11,941 --> 01:34:13,408
王女
GIMLl: My lady.

844
01:34:17,147 --> 01:34:19,342
亚拉冈大人
Lord Aragorn...

845
01:34:19,582 --> 01:34:20,742
他人呢？
...where is he?

846
01:34:22,852 --> 01:34:24,319
他不在了
He fell.

847
01:34:47,043 --> 01:34:49,944
在城墙后方派重兵驻守
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

848
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:53,047
挡住城门，派哨兵守住城池
Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.

849
01:34:53,349 --> 01:34:56,375
不能打仗的人怎么办？女人和小孩？
What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children?

850
01:34:56,653 --> 01:34:59,144
带他们进入洞穴
Get them into the caves.

851
01:35:00,123 --> 01:35:04,924
萨鲁曼别想攻下这座铜墙铁壁
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

852
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:10,363
圣盔谷只有一个弱点
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

853
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,864
它的外墙是巨石砌成
Its outer wall is solid rock...

854
01:35:13,102 --> 01:35:16,128
但是它的基座有一条渠道
...but for a small culvert at its base...

855
01:35:16,372 --> 01:35:19,068
只比排水管大一点
...which is little more than a drain.

856
01:35:21,945 --> 01:35:26,041
这行不通火怎么烧得了石头？
How? How can fire undo stone?

857
01:35:26,282 --> 01:35:30,776
你要用什么方法摧毁城墙？
What kind of device could bring down the wall?

858
01:35:34,491 --> 01:35:38,393
只要能攻下城墙圣盔谷就会瓦解
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

859
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:42,119
就算能攻下城墙还要有几千名士兵
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning...

860
01:35:42,365 --> 01:35:44,856
才攻得进去
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

861
01:35:45,101 --> 01:35:46,466
成千上万名士兵
Tens of thousands.

862
01:35:46,703 --> 01:35:50,696
大人，我们没有这种大军
But, my lord, there is no such force.

863
01:36:02,685 --> 01:36:05,677
一股新势力崛起
A new power is rising.

864
01:36:05,955 --> 01:36:08,856
它即将获得胜利
Its victory is at hand.

865
01:36:14,631 --> 01:36:16,622
今晚
This night...

866
01:36:17,133 --> 01:36:21,399
洛汗人的鲜血将染红大地
...the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!

867
01:36:21,638 --> 01:36:24,903
向圣盔谷进攻
March to Helm's Deep!

868
01:36:25,141 --> 01:36:28,577
不能留下活口
Leave none alive!

869
01:36:31,114 --> 01:36:33,582
开战了！
To war!

870
01:36:37,554 --> 01:36:41,923
人类将看不到明天的曙光
There will be no dawn for Men.

871
01:36:59,175 --> 01:37:01,166
南方有烟硝升起
Look. There's smoke to the south.

872
01:37:01,411 --> 01:37:04,505
最近艾辛格那个方向
There is always smoke rising...

873
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:08,547
一直有烟硝升起
...from Isengard these days.

874
01:37:08,885 --> 01:37:10,375
艾辛格？
Isengard?

875
01:37:10,687 --> 01:37:12,484
很久以前
There was a time...

876
01:37:12,889 --> 01:37:16,325
萨鲁曼会来我的森林漫步
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

877
01:37:16,593 --> 01:37:19,892
但是现在他却满脑子都是钢铁
But now he has a mind of metal...

878
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:22,996
还有铁轮
...and wheels.

879
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:28,270
他对大自然不再感兴趣
He no longer cares for growing things.

880
01:37:28,504 --> 01:37:30,233
那是什么？
What is it?

881
01:37:35,244 --> 01:37:37,405
萨鲁曼的大军
It's Saruman's army.

882
01:37:37,647 --> 01:37:39,137
开战了
The war has started.

883
01:38:17,553 --> 01:38:21,853
愿主神保佑你
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

884
01:38:54,478 --> 01:38:56,062
Brego.

885
01:39:22,185 --> 01:39:23,277
亚文
Arwen.

886
01:39:24,687 --> 01:39:26,484
你该走了

887
01:39:28,658 --> 01:39:32,424
船要开往瓦林诺去吧，现在还来得及

888
01:39:33,229 --> 01:39:34,958
我做了决定
I have made my choice.

889
01:39:41,471 --> 01:39:44,269
他不会回来了
He is not coming back.

890
01:39:45,742 --> 01:39:49,007
已经没有希望你为何还要留恋？
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

891
01:39:49,979 --> 01:39:52,914
还有一线希望
There is still hope.

892
01:39:57,153 --> 01:40:00,850
就算亚拉冈活下来你们还是会分开
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.

893
01:40:04,327 --> 01:40:07,228
就算亚拉冈打败索伦成为人皇
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...

894
01:40:07,463 --> 01:40:09,931
而你的愿望也都实现
...and all that you hope for comes true...

895
01:40:10,133 --> 01:40:14,763
他还是逃不了死亡的命运
...you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.

896
01:40:15,104 --> 01:40:18,039
不管是战死或是老死
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...

897
01:40:18,274 --> 01:40:21,141
亚拉冈都难逃一死
...Aragorn will die.

898
01:40:24,013 --> 01:40:26,504
你将得不到安慰
And there will be no comfort for you...

899
01:40:26,749 --> 01:40:30,913
永远为他的死伤心难过
...no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

900
01:40:33,823 --> 01:40:36,485
他死了以后
He will come to death...

901
01:40:36,726 --> 01:40:39,251
身为人皇的英勇形象
...an image of the splendor of the kings of Men...

902
01:40:39,495 --> 01:40:44,091
将留在世人心中永不磨灭
...in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

903
01:40:53,209 --> 01:40:57,111
但是你，我的爱女
But you, my daughter...

904
01:40:57,980 --> 01:41:02,940
你将活在恒久不变的黑暗中
...you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...

905
01:41:03,219 --> 01:41:07,178
就像没有星光的冬夜
...as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.

906
01:41:09,692 --> 01:41:12,024
你将满怀伤悲
Here you will dwell...

907
01:41:12,261 --> 01:41:17,096
住在一天一天干枯的老树下
...bound to your grief under the fading trees...

908
01:41:18,901 --> 01:41:20,835
直到世界改变
...until all the world is changed...

909
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:25,507
你也虚度了你漫长的一生
...and the long years of your life are utterly spent.

910
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:35,175
亚文
Arwen.

911
01:41:41,924 --> 01:41:44,119
你在这儿什么也没有
There is nothing for you here...

912
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:46,886
只有死亡
...only death.

913
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:10,742
难道你不爱我吗？

914
01:42:12,488 --> 01:42:14,183
我爱你，父亲

915
01:43:20,389 --> 01:43:23,950
敌人的力量越来越强大
The power of the enemy is growing.

916
01:43:24,193 --> 01:43:26,753
索伦将利用他的傀儡萨鲁曼
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...

917
01:43:26,996 --> 01:43:30,363
消灭洛汗人民
...to destroy the people of Rohan.

918
01:43:32,501 --> 01:43:36,062
艾辛格的邪恶大军出动了
Isengard has been unleashed.

919
01:43:40,409 --> 01:43:43,708
索伦的邪眼把目标转向刚铎
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...

920
01:43:44,914 --> 01:43:47,849
人类最后的自由国土
...the last free kingdom of Men.

921
01:43:48,117 --> 01:43:52,451
他将迅雷不及掩耳地进攻刚铎
His war on this country will come swiftly.

922
01:43:56,225 --> 01:43:59,251
他感到魔戒离他很近
He senses the Ring is close.

923
01:43:59,495 --> 01:44:02,896
魔戒持有者的意志越来越薄弱
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.

924
01:44:03,132 --> 01:44:07,125
佛罗多的内心深处知道
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...

925
01:44:08,738 --> 01:44:12,538
这场旅程将夺去他的生命
...the quest will claim his life.

926
01:44:12,742 --> 01:44:14,835
你很清楚
You know this.

927
01:44:15,511 --> 01:44:18,275
你也预见到了
You have foreseen it.

928
01:44:20,449 --> 01:44:23,850
这是我们必须冒的险
It is the risk we all took.

929
01:44:28,324 --> 01:44:32,454
当邪恶力量聚集魔戒的意志力就会加强
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.

930
01:44:33,696 --> 01:44:38,065
它一心一意想回到人类手上
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.

931
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:43,704
因为人类很容易受到它的诱惑
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.

932
01:44:43,973 --> 01:44:47,465
年轻的刚铎将军只要伸出手
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand...

933
01:44:47,676 --> 01:44:51,703
将魔戒占为己有中土世界就会沦陷
...take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.

934
01:44:54,183 --> 01:44:55,946
就快了
It is close now.

935
01:44:56,218 --> 01:45:00,416
它就快成功了
So close to achieving its goal.

936
01:45:03,592 --> 01:45:07,153
索伦即将奴役世上所有生物
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth...

937
01:45:07,396 --> 01:45:11,457
甚至带来中土世界的灭亡
...even unto to the ending of the world.

938
01:45:13,369 --> 01:45:15,132
精灵的时代…
The time of the Elves...

939
01:45:15,404 --> 01:45:17,269
…已经结束了
...is over.

940
01:45:18,174 --> 01:45:21,701
我们该让中土世界自生自灭？
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

941
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:26,876
或是让他们孤军奋战吗？
Do we let them stand alone?

942
01:45:31,587 --> 01:45:32,884
有什么消息？
What news?

943
01:45:33,122 --> 01:45:35,852
我们的探子报告萨鲁曼向洛汗国进攻
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.

944
01:45:36,092 --> 01:45:38,890
希优顿率领人民逃到圣盔谷
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

945
01:45:39,128 --> 01:45:43,087
我们必须守住边境，法拉墨半兽人在蠢蠢欲动
But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

946
01:45:43,332 --> 01:45:45,664
索伦在召募大军
Sauron is marshaling an army.

947
01:45:46,068 --> 01:45:48,127
野人部落和南蛮族聚集在黑门
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.

948
01:45:48,370 --> 01:45:51,703
-有多少？-几千人，每天都增加
- How many? - Some thousands. More come every day.

949
01:45:52,842 --> 01:45:56,334
-谁驻守在北边河流？-奥斯吉力亚斯的五百名精兵
- Who's covering the river to the north? - We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

950
01:45:56,579 --> 01:45:59,571
要是受到攻击绝对抵挡不了
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

951
01:46:01,784 --> 01:46:03,877
萨鲁曼从艾辛格发动攻势
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

952
01:46:04,153 --> 01:46:06,747
索伦则从魔多进攻
Sauron from Mordor.

953
01:46:08,157 --> 01:46:11,320
人类将受到两面夹攻
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

954
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:13,187
刚铎势单力薄
Gondor is weak.

955
01:46:13,429 --> 01:46:16,489
索伦很快就会打过来
Sauron will strike us soon.

956
01:46:17,299 --> 01:46:19,096
他会全力进攻
And he will strike hard.

957
01:46:19,602 --> 01:46:23,629
他知道我们现在无力抵挡
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.

958
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:39,747
我的手下说你们是半兽人间谍
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

959
01:46:40,022 --> 01:46:42,684
间谍？有没有搞错？
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

960
01:46:42,925 --> 01:46:45,120
你们不是间谍是什么？
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?

961
01:46:52,067 --> 01:46:53,728
快说
Speak.

962
01:46:54,904 --> 01:46:57,429
我们是夏尔来的哈比人
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

963
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,809
我的名字是佛罗多巴金斯这是山姆卫斯詹吉
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.

964
01:47:01,243 --> 01:47:02,710
你的保镖吗？
Your bodyguard?

965
01:47:02,945 --> 01:47:04,674
他的园丁
His gardener.

966
01:47:05,347 --> 01:47:07,281
你们那个鬼鬼祟祟的朋友呢？
And where is your skulking friend?

967
01:47:08,884 --> 01:47:11,079
滑不溜丢的小子
That gangrel creature.

968
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,420
那个丑八怪
He had an ill-favored look.

969
01:47:15,224 --> 01:47:17,055
没有别人
There was no other.

970
01:47:21,230 --> 01:47:23,494
我们跟七个同伴从瑞文戴尔出发
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.

971
01:47:26,902 --> 01:47:29,894
在摩瑞亚失去一名同伴
One we lost in Moria...

972
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,507
其中有两个也是哈比人
...two were my kin...

973
01:47:32,741 --> 01:47:36,404
还有一个矮人、一个精灵和两个人类
...a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men.

974
01:47:36,612 --> 01:47:40,446
亚拉松之子亚拉冈和刚铎人波罗莫
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

975
01:47:45,554 --> 01:47:47,249
你是波罗莫的朋友？
You're a friend of Boromir?

976
01:47:49,758 --> 01:47:51,157
对
Yes.

977
01:47:52,328 --> 01:47:53,352
至少我是这么想
For my part.

978
01:47:59,935 --> 01:48:02,802
那么你知道他死了一定会很难过
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.

979
01:48:04,907 --> 01:48:06,306
死了？
Dead?

980
01:48:06,508 --> 01:48:08,499
怎么会？几时？
How? When?

981
01:48:08,811 --> 01:48:11,405
你是他的同伴我倒希望你能告诉我
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.

982
01:48:17,319 --> 01:48:19,014
他是我的兄长
He was my brother.

983
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,274
法拉墨将军
Captain Faramir!

984
01:48:41,577 --> 01:48:43,636
我们找到另一个家伙
We found the third one.

985
01:48:55,391 --> 01:48:57,291
你跟我走，来吧
You must come with me. Now.

986
01:49:08,637 --> 01:49:09,661
下面
Down there.

987
01:49:24,653 --> 01:49:27,451
谁敢闯进禁忌之池格杀勿论
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.

988
01:49:38,133 --> 01:49:39,600
他们在等我的命令
They wait for my command.

989
01:49:45,107 --> 01:49:46,131
我该下令吗？
Shall I shoot?

990
01:49:47,409 --> 01:49:50,378
池塘的水好清凉
The rock and pool Is nice and cool

991
01:49:50,612 --> 01:49:52,375
池塘的鱼好甘甜
So juicy sweet

992
01:49:53,082 --> 01:49:56,017
我唯一的愿望就是抓到
Our only wish To catch a fish

993
01:49:56,251 --> 01:49:58,845
甘甜的鱼儿
So juicy sweet

994
01:50:05,961 --> 01:50:07,292
慢着
Wait.

995
01:50:08,864 --> 01:50:11,628
这个生物对我有义务
This creature is bound to me.

996
01:50:12,301 --> 01:50:14,166
我对他也有责任
And I to him.

997
01:50:17,506 --> 01:50:18,734
他是我们的向导
He is our guide.

998
01:50:23,512 --> 01:50:24,843
求求你
Please...

999
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,877
让我下去找他
...let me go down to him.

1000
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:39,852
史麦戈
Smeagol.

1001
01:50:40,929 --> 01:50:43,090
主人在这儿
Master is here.

1002
01:50:44,366 --> 01:50:45,424
来，史麦戈
Come, Smeagol.

1003
01:50:48,370 --> 01:50:50,930
相信主人，来吧
Trust master. Come.

1004
01:50:54,143 --> 01:50:57,909
我们一定要走吗？
We must go now?

1005
01:50:58,347 --> 01:51:01,714
史麦戈，你要相信主人
Smeagol, you must trust master.

1006
01:51:01,950 --> 01:51:03,281
跟我来
Follow me. Come on.

1007
01:51:04,586 --> 01:51:06,076
来呀
Come.

1008
01:51:08,690 --> 01:51:09,816
来，史麦戈
Come, Smeagol.

1009
01:51:10,392 --> 01:51:12,383
史麦戈乖，很好
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

1010
01:51:12,961 --> 01:51:14,428
来呀
Come on.

1011
01:51:18,901 --> 01:51:20,493
别伤害他
Don't hurt him!

1012
01:51:20,736 --> 01:51:23,398
别挣扎，听我说
Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen to me.

1013
01:51:23,639 --> 01:51:24,867
主人
Master!

1014
01:51:36,251 --> 01:51:37,809
不，不
No! No!

1015
01:51:44,126 --> 01:51:46,219
你要带他们去哪里？
Where are you leading them?

1016
01:51:48,096 --> 01:51:49,688
快回答
Answer me.

1017
01:51:50,566 --> 01:51:53,729
史麦戈
Smeagol.

1018
01:51:57,239 --> 01:52:01,938
你为什么要哭，史麦戈？
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

1019
01:52:03,212 --> 01:52:05,772
坏人伤害我们
Cruel Men hurts us.

1020
01:52:06,014 --> 01:52:08,949
主人骗了我们
Master tricksed us.

1021
01:52:09,218 --> 01:52:12,676
他当然骗了我们
Of course he did.

1022
01:52:13,155 --> 01:52:16,784
我就跟你说他很奸诈
I told you he was tricksy.

1023
01:52:17,025 --> 01:52:19,994
我跟你说他很虚伪
I told you he was false.

1024
01:52:20,229 --> 01:52:22,857
主人是朋友
Master is our friend.

1025
01:52:23,098 --> 01:52:25,396
我们的朋友
Our friend.

1026
01:52:25,634 --> 01:52:27,727
主人出卖了我们
Master betrayed us.

1027
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:30,905
不，这不关你事
No. Not its business.

1028
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:34,406
别管我们
Leave us alone!

1029
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:36,942
臭哈比人
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1030
01:52:37,179 --> 01:52:39,409
他们偷走我们的东西
They stole it from us!

1031
01:52:39,648 --> 01:52:41,013
不，不
No. No.

1032
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:43,208
他们偷走什么？
What did they steal?

1033
01:52:45,454 --> 01:52:50,721
我的宝贝
My precious!

1034
01:52:54,496 --> 01:52:56,054
我们一定要逃走
We have to get out of here.

1035
01:52:56,732 --> 01:52:58,632
你快走吧
You go. Go, now.

1036
01:53:01,303 --> 01:53:03,100
你可以逃走
You can do it.

1037
01:53:04,606 --> 01:53:06,005
快用魔戒，佛罗多
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1038
01:53:06,208 --> 01:53:07,937
就这么一次
Just this once.

1039
01:53:08,176 --> 01:53:09,871
戴上它
Put it on.

1040
01:53:10,379 --> 01:53:12,347
消失不见
Disappear.

1041
01:53:13,448 --> 01:53:14,472
不行
I can't.

1042
01:53:17,653 --> 01:53:19,780
你说的对
You were right, Sam.

1043
01:53:21,323 --> 01:53:23,723
你试着告诉我，但是….
You tried to tell me but...

1044
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:30,623
对不起
I'm sorry.

1045
01:53:35,237 --> 01:53:38,035
魔戒控制了我
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1046
01:53:39,474 --> 01:53:41,066
我一戴上魔戒…
If I put it on...

1047
01:53:41,310 --> 01:53:43,574
…他就会找到我
...he'll find me.

1048
01:53:45,314 --> 01:53:47,214
他就会看到我
He'll see.

1049
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:50,450
佛罗多
Mr. Frodo...

1050
01:53:55,457 --> 01:53:59,655
原来这就是所有谜团的解答
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

1051
01:54:01,930 --> 01:54:04,865
我在荒郊野外找到你们
Here in the Wild I have you...

1052
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:06,931
两个半身人
...two Halflings...

1053
01:54:07,169 --> 01:54:10,263
我有一群忠心的部下
...and a host of men at my call.

1054
01:54:13,609 --> 01:54:17,045
至尊魔戒也垂手可得
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1055
01:54:26,822 --> 01:54:30,485
我这刚铎大将法拉墨
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

1056
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:35,129
将证明自己的能力
...to show his quality.

1057
01:54:56,318 --> 01:54:57,808
不！
No!

1058
01:55:01,089 --> 01:55:02,351
住手
Stop it!

1059
01:55:02,591 --> 01:55:03,558
放了他吧
Leave him alone.

1060
01:55:04,993 --> 01:55:07,461
你不明白吗？
Don't you understand?

1061
01:55:08,797 --> 01:55:10,628
他一定要摧毁它
He's got to destroy it!

1062
01:55:10,866 --> 01:55:14,029
所以我们才要去魔多
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1063
01:55:14,269 --> 01:55:15,861
把它丢进末日火山烈焰
To the Mountain of Fire!

1064
01:55:17,005 --> 01:55:20,031
奥斯吉力亚斯受到攻击他们请你调派援兵
Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.

1065
01:55:20,242 --> 01:55:23,177
求求你，他身负重担
Please. It's such a burden.

1066
01:55:25,414 --> 01:55:27,439
你不肯帮他吗？
Will you not help him?

1067
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:30,681
将军
Captain?

1068
01:55:31,453 --> 01:55:33,580
准备出发
Prepare to leave.

1069
01:55:38,627 --> 01:55:40,993
魔戒将被带到刚铎
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1070
01:56:54,069 --> 01:56:56,629
-他还活着-他人呢？
He's alive! Where is he? Where is he?

1071
01:56:56,872 --> 01:56:59,864
让开，我要宰了他
Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him!

1072
01:57:00,075 --> 01:57:03,772
你是我见过最幸运、最机智
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1073
01:57:04,012 --> 01:57:07,971
也是最不怕死的家伙
...and the most reckless man I ever knew.

1074
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:10,149
谢天谢地
Bless you, laddie.

1075
01:57:10,819 --> 01:57:12,446
金雳，国王呢？
Gimli, where is the king?

1076
01:57:21,563 --> 01:57:22,495
你迟到了

1077
01:57:26,334 --> 01:57:27,596
你看起来好惨
You look terrible.

1078
01:58:09,377 --> 01:58:11,368
一支大军？
A great host, you say?

1079
01:58:11,613 --> 01:58:14,207
-艾辛格大军倾巢而出-多少人？
- All Isengard is emptied. - How many?

1080
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:17,885
至少有一万人
Ten thousand strong at least.

1081
01:58:19,521 --> 01:58:20,886
一万人？
Ten thousand?

1082
01:58:21,389 --> 01:58:23,789
这支大军只有一个目的
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1083
01:58:26,561 --> 01:58:28,620
摧毁人类世界
To destroy the world of Men.

1084
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:33,133
他们入夜就会攻到
They will be here by nightfall.

1085
01:58:39,007 --> 01:58:40,235
让他们来吧
Let them come!

1086
01:58:41,810 --> 01:58:44,506
让每个士兵和壮丁佩带武器
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...

1087
01:58:44,746 --> 01:58:47,806
今晚准备迎敌
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1088
01:58:56,157 --> 01:58:59,024
我们在上面守住通道和城门
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.

1089
01:58:59,261 --> 01:59:01,627
没有人攻得下深溪墙
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...

1090
01:59:01,863 --> 01:59:04,525
或是攻进号角堡
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1091
01:59:04,766 --> 01:59:07,098
这些可不是低能的半兽人
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1092
01:59:07,769 --> 01:59:09,896
他们是强兽人
These are Uruk-hai.

1093
01:59:10,138 --> 01:59:13,505
骁勇善战、武器精良
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.

1094
01:59:15,176 --> 01:59:18,771
我身经百战，矮人先生
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

1095
01:59:19,014 --> 01:59:22,541
我知道该怎么防卫我的堡垒
I know how to defend my own keep.

1096
01:59:29,257 --> 01:59:32,590
这座碉堡可以说是滴水不漏
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

1097
01:59:32,827 --> 01:59:37,992
萨鲁曼大军会烧杀掳掠这种事我常见
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn. We've seen it before.

1098
01:59:38,266 --> 01:59:40,860
但是农作物可以再耕种
Crops can be resown...

1099
01:59:41,102 --> 01:59:44,037
家园可以再重建
...homes rebuilt.

1100
01:59:44,706 --> 01:59:47,197
我们在这座铜墙铁壁
Within these walls...

1101
01:59:47,609 --> 01:59:49,076
撑得绝对比他们久
...we will outlast them.

1102
01:59:49,277 --> 01:59:51,609
他们不是来烧杀掳掠的
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.

1103
01:59:51,846 --> 01:59:53,336
他们是来把洛汗人赶尽杀绝
They come to destroy its people...

1104
01:59:53,581 --> 01:59:56,049
连一个小孩也不放过
...down to the last child.

1105
01:59:56,985 --> 01:59:59,146
你要我怎么办？
What would you have me do?

1106
01:59:59,421 --> 02:00:01,048
看看这些人
Look at my men.

1107
02:00:01,323 --> 02:00:02,984
他们就快失去勇气
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1108
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:09,594
如果我们非死不可我也要他们奋战到底
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end...

1109
02:00:09,831 --> 02:00:12,800
好让世人永远记得
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1110
02:00:16,504 --> 02:00:18,335
派出骑士，王上
Send out riders, my lord.

1111
02:00:18,707 --> 02:00:21,505
你一定要去搬救兵
You must call for aid.

1112
02:00:24,813 --> 02:00:27,008
谁会来救我们？
And who will come?

1113
02:00:27,482 --> 02:00:29,006
精灵？
Elves?

1114
02:00:29,284 --> 02:00:31,252
矮人？
Dwarves?

1115
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:34,918
我们不像你有那么多朋友
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

1116
02:00:35,824 --> 02:00:38,019
古老的同盟早已瓦解
The old alliances are dead.

1117
02:00:38,526 --> 02:00:41,256
-刚铎会派出救兵-刚铎？
- Gondor will answer. - Gondor?!

1118
02:00:41,496 --> 02:00:43,623
西谷沦陷时他们在哪里？
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

1119
02:00:44,666 --> 02:00:47,829
我们被敌人围攻时他们在哪里？
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!

1120
02:00:48,069 --> 02:00:49,934
刚铎
Where was Gon...?

1121
02:00:52,674 --> 02:00:54,539
不，亚拉冈
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1122
02:00:56,177 --> 02:00:58,577
我们只能孤军奋战
...we are alone.

1123
02:01:05,553 --> 02:01:07,180
把女人小孩带进洞穴
Get the women and children into the caves.

1124
02:01:07,455 --> 02:01:08,649
我们需要时间准备
We need more time to lay provisions...

1125
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:12,291
没时间了，开战了
There is no time. War is upon us.

1126
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:14,287
封锁大门
Secure the gate.

1127
02:01:19,567 --> 02:01:21,592
我们树人不插手
We Ents have not troubled...

1128
02:01:21,870 --> 02:01:25,169
人类和巫师的战争
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1129
02:01:25,974 --> 02:01:28,875
已经有好久了
...for a very long time.

1130
02:01:30,211 --> 02:01:34,910
但是现在要发生的事
But now, something is about to happen...

1131
02:01:35,150 --> 02:01:37,414
也有好长一段时间
...that has not happened...

1132
02:01:37,719 --> 02:01:40,119
没有发生过
...for an age.

1133
02:01:41,389 --> 02:01:43,584
树人会议
Entmoot.

1134
02:01:44,092 --> 02:01:44,990
那是什么？
What's that?

1135
02:01:45,493 --> 02:01:48,257
那是一个集会
'Tis a gathering.

1136
02:01:49,531 --> 02:01:52,022
什么的集会？
A gathering of what?

1137
02:02:10,018 --> 02:02:12,282
山毛榉、橡树
Beech. Oak.

1138
02:02:12,554 --> 02:02:14,385
栗树、白杨树
Chestnut. Ash.

1139
02:02:14,722 --> 02:02:16,622
很好，很好
Good. Good. Good.

1140
02:02:16,858 --> 02:02:19,156
很多树人都来了
Many have come.

1141
02:02:26,768 --> 02:02:29,464
我们必须决定树人
Now we must decide if the Ents...

1142
02:02:29,704 --> 02:02:32,195
该不该参战
...will go to war.

1143
02:02:41,182 --> 02:02:44,174
撤退，快进洞穴
Move back! Move to the caves!

1144
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:47,344
-继续走-快点
Keep moving. Quickly now.

1145
02:03:41,976 --> 02:03:45,207
农夫、蹄铁匠、马童
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1146
02:03:46,347 --> 02:03:48,076
这些人都不是士兵
These are no soldiers.

1147
02:03:50,185 --> 02:03:53,552
-大多数都太老了-或是太年轻
- Most have seen too many winters. - Or too few.

1148
02:03:57,592 --> 02:04:00,425
看看他们，他们被吓坏了
Look at them. They're frightened.

1149
02:04:00,662 --> 02:04:02,061
从他们的眼神就看得出来
You can see it in their eyes.

1150
02:04:07,335 --> 02:04:09,030
当然了

1151
02:04:09,504 --> 02:04:11,028
他们只有三百人

1152
02:04:11,272 --> 02:04:12,466
却要对抗一万名大军

1153
02:04:14,309 --> 02:04:16,532
在这里总比留在伊多拉斯来得安全

1154
02:04:16,582 --> 02:04:17,957
亚拉冈

1155
02:04:17,979 --> 02:04:20,539
他们毫无胜算

1156
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:22,777
他们全都会丧命

1157
02:04:23,051 --> 02:04:25,144
那么我也要跟着一起死
Then I shall die as one of them!

1158
02:04:31,693 --> 02:04:33,456
让他去吧
GIMLl: Let him go, lad.

1159
02:04:34,095 --> 02:04:35,995
让他去
Let him be.

1160
02:04:37,532 --> 02:04:42,936
会使剑的人都去领武器了
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.

1161
02:04:47,242 --> 02:04:49,073
王上？
My lord?

1162
02:04:51,212 --> 02:04:53,703
加姆林，我是谁？
Who am I, Gamling?

1163
02:04:57,185 --> 02:05:01,019
您是我们的国王
You are our king, sire.

1164
02:05:04,092 --> 02:05:07,289
你相信你的国王吗？
And do you trust your king?

1165
02:05:08,896 --> 02:05:11,990
王上，无论死活
Your men, my lord...

1166
02:05:12,233 --> 02:05:14,963
您的士兵都将追随您奋战到底
...will follow you to whatever end.

1167
02:05:21,876 --> 02:05:23,707
无论死活
To whatever end.

1168
02:05:33,655 --> 02:05:37,113
剽悍的战马和骑士在哪里？
Where is the horse and the rider?

1169
02:05:37,392 --> 02:05:40,384
胜利的号角在哪里？
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1170
02:05:41,963 --> 02:05:46,332
它们就像落在高山的雨滴
They have passed like rain on the mountains.

1171
02:05:47,402 --> 02:05:50,565
或是拂过草原的微风早就消失
Like wind in the meadow.

1172
02:05:54,275 --> 02:05:57,972
昔日的荣耀就像太阳西下
The days have gone down in the West...

1173
02:05:58,746 --> 02:06:01,306
黯然消失在山后
...behind the hills...

1174
02:06:03,318 --> 02:06:04,842
被黑暗笼罩
...into Shadow.

1175
02:06:13,394 --> 02:06:16,761
怎么会变成这样？
How did it come to this?

1176
02:06:20,935 --> 02:06:23,836
快走，快到外墙
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1177
02:06:41,456 --> 02:06:42,718
把剑给我
Give me your sword.

1178
02:06:52,266 --> 02:06:53,392
你叫什么？
What is your name?

1179
02:06:54,001 --> 02:06:56,299
哈拉斯，哈犸之子
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

1180
02:06:58,506 --> 02:07:01,066
大家都说我们活不过今晚
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.

1181
02:07:03,077 --> 02:07:04,977
他们都说没有希望了
They say that it is hopeless.

1182
02:07:22,897 --> 02:07:24,455
这是把好剑
This is a good sword.

1183
02:07:26,567 --> 02:07:28,831
哈犸之子哈拉斯
Haleth, son of Hama...

1184
02:07:33,207 --> 02:07:35,300
永远都有希望
...there is always hope.

1185
02:07:58,366 --> 02:08:01,665
我们一直都相信你你也没让我们失望
We have trusted you this far. You have not led us astray.

1186
02:08:01,903 --> 02:08:03,393
原谅我
Forgive me.

1187
02:08:03,638 --> 02:08:05,003
我不该绝望
I was wrong to despair.

1188
02:08:08,276 --> 02:08:10,676
没什么好原谅的

1189
02:08:14,248 --> 02:08:16,978
还有时间我得改改这身锁子甲
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1190
02:08:20,521 --> 02:08:22,489
胸口这边有点紧
It's a little tight across the chest.

1191
02:08:28,763 --> 02:08:30,663
那不是半兽人的号角
That is no Orc horn.

1192
02:08:36,404 --> 02:08:38,167
快去叫国王
Send for the king.

1193
02:08:38,406 --> 02:08:41,933
-打开城门-开城门
- Open the gate! Open up the gate!

1194
02:09:13,641 --> 02:09:15,233
这怎么可能？
How is this possible?

1195
02:09:16,310 --> 02:09:19,871
我带来瑞文戴尔爱隆王的信息
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1196
02:09:20,114 --> 02:09:23,277
精灵和人类曾经结为同盟
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.

1197
02:09:24,085 --> 02:09:28,215
我们在很久以前曾经并肩作战
Long ago we fought and died together.

1198
02:09:30,591 --> 02:09:33,424
我们要来帮助你们
We come to honor that allegiance.

1199
02:09:41,969 --> 02:09:43,834
欢迎你们
You are most welcome.

1200
02:09:49,243 --> 02:09:53,111
我们很荣幸再跟人类并肩作战
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.

1201
02:10:26,814 --> 02:10:30,011
你挑的什么烂位置嘛
GIMLl: You could have picked a better spot.

1202
02:10:34,989 --> 02:10:39,119
不管你的运气有多好都希望你能撑过今晚
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.

1203
02:10:45,333 --> 02:10:47,062
你的朋友都在这里
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1204
02:10:47,768 --> 02:10:50,236
希望他们熬得过今晚
Let's hope they last the night.

1205
02:11:50,264 --> 02:11:53,927
别对敌人心存怜悯
ARAGORN

1206
02:11:54,969 --> 02:11:57,233
因为他们不会手下留情

1207
02:12:31,706 --> 02:12:34,436
-外面发生什么事？-你要我形容给你听
- What's happening out there? - Shall I describe it to you?

1208
02:12:35,743 --> 02:12:37,472
还是替你找垫脚箱？
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1209
02:13:17,084 --> 02:13:18,278
稳住

1210
02:13:40,741 --> 02:13:42,470
开战了
So it begins.

1211
02:13:48,482 --> 02:13:49,506
准备发射

1212
02:13:58,692 --> 02:14:00,819
他们的盔甲有罩门

1213
02:14:01,061 --> 02:14:02,551
脖子和手腕

1214
02:14:02,797 --> 02:14:04,321
放箭

1215
02:14:09,436 --> 02:14:10,733
有没有射中？
Did they hit anything?

1216
02:14:11,472 --> 02:14:13,406
连珠箭
Give them a volley.

1217
02:14:13,607 --> 02:14:15,632
-射箭！-射箭！
- Fire! - Fire!

1218
02:14:31,458 --> 02:14:33,085
把他们送来领死吧
Send them to me! Come on!

1219
02:14:52,746 --> 02:14:53,678
梯子！

1220
02:14:53,914 --> 02:14:54,903
很好
Good!

1221
02:15:01,789 --> 02:15:04,690
迎敌！迎敌！
Swords! Swords!

1222
02:15:34,822 --> 02:15:36,847
勒苟拉斯，我痛宰了两个
Legolas! Two already!

1223
02:15:37,124 --> 02:15:39,183
我杀了十七个了
I'm on 17!

1224
02:15:39,426 --> 02:15:41,917
我不能让尖耳朵赢过我
Huh? I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1225
02:15:48,802 --> 02:15:50,463
十九个
Nineteen!

1226
02:16:27,741 --> 02:16:29,106
梅里
Merry.

1227
02:16:31,779 --> 02:16:35,510
我们同意了
We have just agreed.

1228
02:16:43,657 --> 02:16:45,056
同意什么？
Yes?

1229
02:16:45,626 --> 02:16:49,722
我在树人会议上提到你们
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1230
02:16:50,931 --> 02:16:54,094
我们都同意
...and we have agreed...

1231
02:16:54,666 --> 02:16:58,625
你们不是半兽人
...you are not Orcs.

1232
02:16:59,571 --> 02:17:01,630
那真是好消息
Well, that's good news.

1233
02:17:01,873 --> 02:17:05,934
萨鲁曼呢？你们对他有什么决定？
And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him?

1234
02:17:06,644 --> 02:17:10,375
别急，梅里雅达克
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1235
02:17:10,648 --> 02:17:12,115
别急？
Hasty?

1236
02:17:12,751 --> 02:17:14,582
我们的朋友在打仗
Our friends are out there.

1237
02:17:14,819 --> 02:17:18,915
他们需要帮忙他们不能孤军奋战
They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own.

1238
02:17:19,324 --> 02:17:21,519
打仗？没错
War? Yes.

1239
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:23,591
战争是影响了大家
It affects us all.

1240
02:17:24,462 --> 02:17:28,421
不过你要了解，小哈比人
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1241
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:30,565
用古树人语说话
...it takes a long time...

1242
02:17:30,802 --> 02:17:35,637
要花很长的时间
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1243
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:40,004
我们从来都不说话
...and we never say anything...

1244
02:17:40,245 --> 02:17:44,079
除非是要花很长的时间
...unless it is worth taking...

1245
02:17:44,349 --> 02:17:48,308
才能说完的话
...a long time to say.

1246
02:17:49,187 --> 02:17:52,452
十七、十八
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1247
02:17:52,690 --> 02:17:53,679
十九
Nineteen!

1248
02:17:54,325 --> 02:17:56,122
二十
Twenty!

1249
02:17:56,361 --> 02:17:57,953
二十一
Twenty-one!

1250
02:17:58,196 --> 02:18:02,496
22和23
Twenty-two and 23!

1251
02:18:08,073 --> 02:18:10,007
快射箭
Causeway!

1252
02:18:17,882 --> 02:18:20,180
就这样吗？
Is this it?

1253
02:18:20,418 --> 02:18:23,285
你就只有这点能耐吗萨鲁曼？
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?

1254
02:18:49,714 --> 02:18:50,942
快把他射倒

1255
02:18:54,486 --> 02:18:56,386
杀了他，杀了他

1256
02:19:49,307 --> 02:19:50,604
挡住城门
Brace the gate!

1257
02:20:09,027 --> 02:20:11,222
挡住他们，死守住
Hold them! Stand firm!

1258
02:20:19,137 --> 02:20:20,399
亚拉冈
Aragorn!

1259
02:20:25,109 --> 02:20:26,235
金雳
Gimli!

1260
02:20:37,088 --> 02:20:38,680
冲啊

1261
02:21:14,792 --> 02:21:18,660
树人无法力挽狂澜
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1262
02:21:19,497 --> 02:21:23,456
我们只能像以前一样逆来顺受
We must weather such things as we have always done.

1263
02:21:24,335 --> 02:21:26,360
你们怎么能这么决定？
How can that be your decision?!

1264
02:21:27,071 --> 02:21:30,632
这不是我们的战争
This is not our war.

1265
02:21:31,009 --> 02:21:33,136
可是你们也属于这世界
But you're part of this world!

1266
02:21:37,382 --> 02:21:39,111
不是吗？
Aren't you?!

1267
02:21:43,288 --> 02:21:45,586
你一定要帮忙
You must help. Please.

1268
02:21:46,958 --> 02:21:49,654
你一定要想想办法
You must do something.

1269
02:21:49,994 --> 02:21:54,226
梅里，你很年轻也很勇敢
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1270
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:59,163
但是你的旅程已经结束了
But your part in this tale is over.

1271
02:21:59,370 --> 02:22:01,531
回去你的家园
Go back to your home.

1272
02:22:11,649 --> 02:22:13,810
也许树须说的对
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1273
02:22:14,085 --> 02:22:15,882
我们也无能为力
We don't belong here, Merry.

1274
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:18,315
我们太渺小了
It's too big for us.

1275
02:22:18,556 --> 02:22:21,150
我们能做什么呢？
What can we do in the end?

1276
02:22:23,528 --> 02:22:26,088
我们还有夏尔
We've got the Shire.

1277
02:22:26,698 --> 02:22:29,166
也许我们应该回家
Maybe we should go home.

1278
02:22:31,069 --> 02:22:34,232
艾辛格的战火会蔓延
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1279
02:22:34,439 --> 02:22:39,274
塔克镇和雄鹿地树林也会燃烧
...and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

1280
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:41,034
最后
And...

1281
02:22:42,914 --> 02:22:45,906
大自然和善良老百姓都会消失
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.

1282
02:22:49,554 --> 02:22:52,421
夏尔也会毁于一旦
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1283
02:23:11,976 --> 02:23:13,136
亚拉冈
Aragorn!

1284
02:23:13,378 --> 02:23:15,676
撤退到圣盔谷
Fall back to the Keep!

1285
02:23:15,913 --> 02:23:18,939
叫他们撤退
Get your men out of there!

1286
02:23:20,184 --> 02:23:21,651
退到圣盔谷

1287
02:23:26,524 --> 02:23:28,048
撤退到圣盔谷

1288
02:23:28,693 --> 02:23:30,285
哈尔达！
Haldir!

1289
02:23:31,129 --> 02:23:32,528
退到圣盔谷

1290
02:23:34,465 --> 02:23:37,662
你们干嘛停下来？
GIMLl: What are you doing? What are you stopping for?

1291
02:23:56,954 --> 02:23:58,114
哈尔达！
Haldir!

1292
02:24:38,930 --> 02:24:40,397
挡住城门
Brace the gate!

1293
02:24:43,334 --> 02:24:44,562
快挡住
Hold them!

1294
02:24:46,437 --> 02:24:49,736
赶到大门，快拔剑
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1295
02:25:13,698 --> 02:25:15,563
让开
Make way!

1296
02:25:18,536 --> 02:25:20,197
我们抵挡不了多久
We cannot hold much longer!

1297
02:25:26,210 --> 02:25:29,702
-挡住他们-你要多久？
Hold them! - How long do you need?

1298
02:25:29,947 --> 02:25:32,438
你们能撑多久就多久
As long as you can give me.

1299
02:25:32,717 --> 02:25:34,275
金雳
Gimli!

1300
02:25:35,853 --> 02:25:37,150
用木头挡住
Timbers!

1301
02:25:37,388 --> 02:25:39,288
挡住城门
Brace the gate!

1302
02:25:54,105 --> 02:25:55,732
来吧，我们能干掉他们
Oh, come on. We can take them.

1303
02:25:56,641 --> 02:25:58,199
太远了
It's a long way.

1304
02:26:03,514 --> 02:26:05,209
把我丢过去
Toss me.

1305
02:26:06,484 --> 02:26:08,213
-什么？-我跳不过去
- What? - I cannot jump the distance!

1306
02:26:08,486 --> 02:26:09,953
把我丢过去
You'll have to toss me!

1307
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:16,854
别跟精灵小子说
Don't tell the Elf.

1308
02:26:17,461 --> 02:26:19,156
我会守口如瓶
Not a word.

1309
02:26:34,445 --> 02:26:35,810
撑住城门
Shore up the door!

1310
02:26:36,047 --> 02:26:38,072
-让开-跟我来
Make way! Follow me to the barricade.

1311
02:26:38,349 --> 02:26:39,316
小心
Watch our backs!

1312
02:26:43,554 --> 02:26:45,715
-这儿再来一根-高一点
Throw another one over here! - Higher!

1313
02:27:35,706 --> 02:27:37,037
快撑住
Hold fast the gate!

1314
02:27:41,345 --> 02:27:44,212
金雳、亚拉冈，快走！
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

1315
02:27:49,053 --> 02:27:50,543
亚拉冈！
Aragorn!

1316
02:28:24,088 --> 02:28:26,454
叫大家撤退
Pull everybody back.

1317
02:28:26,891 --> 02:28:28,620
叫他们回来
Pull them back.

1318
02:28:29,226 --> 02:28:30,625
撤退！
Fall back!

1319
02:28:30,861 --> 02:28:33,329
撤退！

1320
02:28:34,532 --> 02:28:36,159
他们攻进来了
They have broken through!

1321
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:38,595
城门被攻陷，快撤退
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1322
02:28:38,803 --> 02:28:40,964
-撤退-撤退
Fall back! Retreat!

1323
02:28:41,205 --> 02:28:43,730
快把他们带进去
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1324
02:28:43,974 --> 02:28:46,169
进去碉堡
Into the Keep!

1325
02:28:57,722 --> 02:29:02,625
我把你们带到森林西边
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.

1326
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:07,490
你们往北走就可以回到家
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.

1327
02:29:13,270 --> 02:29:14,464
等等，停下来
Wait! Stop!

1328
02:29:15,439 --> 02:29:16,906
停下来
Stop!

1329
02:29:20,044 --> 02:29:21,705
转回去
Turn around.

1330
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:25,308
-掉头回去，带我们到南边-南边？
- Turn around. Take us south. - South?

1331
02:29:25,583 --> 02:29:30,486
那是去艾辛格的路
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1332
02:29:30,921 --> 02:29:33,549
没错
Yes. Exactly.

1333
02:29:33,791 --> 02:29:36,954
我们可以悄悄越过萨鲁曼
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.

1334
02:29:37,194 --> 02:29:39,788
越危险的地方越安全
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.

1335
02:29:40,030 --> 02:29:41,964
他一定料想不到
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1336
02:29:44,635 --> 02:29:47,604
这没有道理
That doesn't make sense to me.

1337
02:29:47,805 --> 02:29:48,897
不过…
But then...

1338
02:29:49,140 --> 02:29:51,768
…你们的个子是很小
...you are very small.

1339
02:29:52,009 --> 02:29:53,704
也许你说的对
Perhaps you're right.

1340
02:29:56,413 --> 02:29:57,880
那就往南吧
South it is, then.

1341
02:29:59,483 --> 02:30:02,748
抓紧了，小哈比人
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1342
02:30:04,855 --> 02:30:07,551
我一向都喜欢往南走
I always like going south.

1343
02:30:07,792 --> 02:30:12,024
就好像下坡一样
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1344
02:30:12,696 --> 02:30:15,096
你疯啦？我们会被逮到
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1345
02:30:15,332 --> 02:30:17,197
才不会
No, we won't.

1346
02:30:18,002 --> 02:30:20,095
这次不会
Not this time.

1347
02:30:26,877 --> 02:30:27,844
你看
Look!

1348
02:30:29,547 --> 02:30:31,913
奥斯吉力亚斯在燃烧
Osgiliath burns!

1349
02:30:32,183 --> 02:30:33,548
魔多大军攻来了
Mordor has come.

1350
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:37,084
魔戒也救不了刚铎
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1351
02:30:38,489 --> 02:30:40,616
它只有毁灭的力量
It has only the power to destroy.

1352
02:30:41,592 --> 02:30:42,957
求求你
Please...

1353
02:30:43,194 --> 02:30:44,752
让我走
...let me go.

1354
02:30:45,863 --> 02:30:47,387
快点
Hurry.

1355
02:30:50,935 --> 02:30:52,266
法拉墨
Faramir!

1356
02:30:52,503 --> 02:30:54,971
你一定要让我走
You must let me go!

1357
02:30:55,406 --> 02:30:58,773
那一家子的小田鼠
And those little family of field mice...

1358
02:30:59,009 --> 02:31:01,773
爬到我身上把我弄得好痒
...that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.

1359
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:05,811
他们老是爬到….
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...

1360
02:31:17,094 --> 02:31:19,961
这些树有很多是我的朋友
Many of these trees were my friends.

1361
02:31:20,731 --> 02:31:25,293
他们还是种子我就认识他们
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

1362
02:31:26,503 --> 02:31:27,629
很遗憾，树须
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1363
02:31:27,872 --> 02:31:30,568
他们有自己的声音
They had voices of their own.

1364
02:31:32,877 --> 02:31:35,368
萨鲁曼
Saruman.

1365
02:31:35,779 --> 02:31:38,771
一个巫师不该这么做
A wizard should know better!

1366
02:31:53,163 --> 02:31:56,724
不管是精灵语
There is no curse in Elvish...

1367
02:31:57,001 --> 02:31:59,595
树人语或是人类的语言
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1368
02:31:59,803 --> 02:32:02,067
都没有更强烈的字眼来诅咒他
...for this treachery.

1369
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:07,438
我今晚要用巨石和岩石
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1370
02:32:07,678 --> 02:32:10,238
摧毁艾辛格
...with rock and stone.

1371
02:32:34,238 --> 02:32:35,296
好耶
Yes.

1372
02:32:36,473 --> 02:32:37,838
来吧，朋友们
Come, my friends.

1373
02:32:39,243 --> 02:32:43,373
树人要开战了
The Ents are going to war.

1374
02:32:43,614 --> 02:32:45,309
我们很可能…
It is likely...

1375
02:32:45,582 --> 02:32:49,018
…会走向灭亡之路
...that we go to our doom.

1376
02:32:50,521 --> 02:32:52,921
这是树人…
Last march...

1377
02:32:53,524 --> 02:32:55,492
…最后的一战
...of the Ents.

1378
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:47,303
半兽人占领了东岸他们的数量太多
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great.

1379
02:33:47,544 --> 02:33:49,535
到晚上我们就会溃不成军
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1380
02:33:52,416 --> 02:33:53,815
佛罗多？
Mr. Frodo?

1381
02:33:54,184 --> 02:33:58,177
它在召唤他邪眼就快看到我了
It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.

1382
02:33:58,455 --> 02:34:00,855
撑着点，你不会有事的
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

1383
02:34:15,239 --> 02:34:16,570
把他带去见我父王
Take them to my father.

1384
02:34:18,208 --> 02:34:21,143
就说法拉墨送上大礼
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1385
02:34:23,614 --> 02:34:26,583
一个足以扭转局势的武器
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.

1386
02:34:27,851 --> 02:34:30,445
你想知道波罗莫的下场吗？
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?

1387
02:34:31,188 --> 02:34:33,884
你想知道你的兄长为什么会死吗？
You want to know why your brother died?

1388
02:34:34,425 --> 02:34:38,088
他誓言要保护佛罗多但是却想夺走魔戒
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!

1389
02:34:38,328 --> 02:34:40,159
他想杀死他
He tried to kill him!

1390
02:34:40,397 --> 02:34:42,661
魔戒把你的兄长逼疯
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1391
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:45,297
小心
Watch out!

1392
02:34:56,246 --> 02:34:57,304
佛罗多？
Mr. Frodo?

1393
02:35:00,050 --> 02:35:01,813
他们在这儿
They're here.

1394
02:35:04,988 --> 02:35:07,388
他们来了
They've come.

1395
02:35:10,027 --> 02:35:11,858
戒灵
Nazgul!

1396
02:35:34,051 --> 02:35:36,110
待在这儿，躲起来
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1397
02:35:38,021 --> 02:35:40,182
快找掩护
Take cover!

1398
02:35:57,541 --> 02:35:59,031
堡垒被攻陷
The fortress is taken.

1399
02:35:59,877 --> 02:36:01,003
我们输了
It is over.

1400
02:36:01,245 --> 02:36:05,113
你说这座堡垒绝不会沦陷
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.

1401
02:36:05,382 --> 02:36:08,249
他们会奋战到底，直到死为止
They still defend it. They have died defending it.

1402
02:36:11,054 --> 02:36:12,385
他们攻进来了
They're breaking in!

1403
02:36:15,092 --> 02:36:17,560
他们攻进城门了
They're past the door!

1404
02:36:20,931 --> 02:36:24,992
洞穴里的女人小孩没办法逃出去吗？
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?

1405
02:36:27,704 --> 02:36:29,569
没别的路了吗？
Is there no other way?

1406
02:36:31,208 --> 02:36:34,200
有一条通道直接通到山上
There is one passage. It leads into the mountains.

1407
02:36:34,945 --> 02:36:37,072
但是他们逃不远到处都有强兽人
But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

1408
02:36:42,052 --> 02:36:44,384
叫女人小孩进入通道
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.

1409
02:36:44,621 --> 02:36:47,419
-堵住入口-死了这么多人
- And barricade the entrance! - So much death.

1410
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:52,993
人类该如何对抗这种仇恨？
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

1411
02:36:57,734 --> 02:36:59,099
跟我一起冲出去
Ride out with me.

1412
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:04,798
冲出去迎敌
Ride out and meet them.

1413
02:37:05,642 --> 02:37:07,735
为了光荣的牺牲
For death and glory.

1414
02:37:07,978 --> 02:37:09,309
为了洛汗国
For Rohan.

1415
02:37:10,881 --> 02:37:12,348
为了你的人民
For your people.

1416
02:37:13,116 --> 02:37:14,981
太阳出来了
The sun is rising.

1417
02:37:19,556 --> 02:37:22,491
五天后等待我的出现
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

1418
02:37:22,726 --> 02:37:24,057
破晓时…
At dawn...

1419
02:37:24,294 --> 02:37:25,921
…向东方看
...look to the east.

1420
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:31,758
是了
Yes.

1421
02:37:34,271 --> 02:37:35,863
好

1422
02:37:37,274 --> 02:37:39,606
圣盔捶手的号角
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1423
02:37:39,843 --> 02:37:42,573
将在圣盔谷
...shall sound in the Deep...

1424
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:45,014
最后一次响起
...one last time.

1425
02:37:45,282 --> 02:37:46,681
好耶
Yes!

1426
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:53,551
这是我们一起拔剑抗敌的时刻
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.

1427
02:38:01,398 --> 02:38:02,660
邪恶兵团，领死吧
Fell deeds, awake.

1428
02:38:03,934 --> 02:38:04,958
邪恶兵团，领死吧
Now for wrath...

1429
02:38:05,202 --> 02:38:08,535
我要以满腔热血和无比勇气迎接浴血黎明
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1430
02:38:15,612 --> 02:38:17,807
骠骑勇士，冲啊
Forth Eorlingas!

1431
02:39:05,696 --> 02:39:06,856
甘道夫
Gandalf.

1432
02:39:14,171 --> 02:39:17,766
希优顿王孤军奋战
Theoden King stands alone.

1433
02:39:18,442 --> 02:39:20,535
他并不孤单
Not alone.

1434
02:39:21,011 --> 02:39:22,069
洛汗弟兄们
Rohirrim!

1435
02:39:28,085 --> 02:39:29,143
伊欧墨
Eomer.

1436
02:39:29,419 --> 02:39:31,887
拯救国王！
To the king!

1437
02:40:49,566 --> 02:40:51,261
好耶
Yes!

1438
02:41:00,444 --> 02:41:03,811
丢得好，好准
A hit. A fine hit.

1439
02:41:28,438 --> 02:41:30,838
撞破水
Break the dam!

1440
02:41:31,074 --> 02:41:34,441
让河水泄洪
Release the river!

1441
02:42:01,838 --> 02:42:04,500
皮聘，抓紧了
Pippin! Hold on!

1442
02:42:09,846 --> 02:42:12,713
抓紧了，小哈比人
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1443
02:42:54,157 --> 02:42:56,125
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

1444
02:43:04,768 --> 02:43:06,258
你要去哪儿？
Where are you going?

1445
02:44:04,494 --> 02:44:05,756
是我呀
It's me.

1446
02:44:08,331 --> 02:44:10,458
我是你的山姆
It's your Sam.

1447
02:44:14,838 --> 02:44:17,398
你不认得我了吗？
Don't you know your Sam?

1448
02:44:35,225 --> 02:44:38,524
我办不到
I can't do this, Sam.

1449
02:44:39,496 --> 02:44:41,430
我知道
I know.

1450
02:44:42,499 --> 02:44:44,797
这不公平
It's all wrong.

1451
02:44:45,602 --> 02:44:47,570
我们根本就不该来
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1452
02:44:55,011 --> 02:44:57,036
但是我们来了
But we are.

1453
02:45:03,553 --> 02:45:06,488
这就像我们听过的精采故事
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1454
02:45:06,756 --> 02:45:09,088
歌颂伟大的事迹
The ones that really mattered.

1455
02:45:10,193 --> 02:45:13,128
充满了黑暗和危险
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1456
02:45:13,363 --> 02:45:16,264
有时候你不想知道结局
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...

1457
02:45:16,499 --> 02:45:19,366
因为怎么可能有快乐结局？
...because how could the end be happy?

1458
02:45:21,971 --> 02:45:24,098
发生这么多可怕的事
How could the world go back to the way it was...

1459
02:45:24,340 --> 02:45:26,240
这世界怎么可能回到从前？
...when so much bad had happened?

1460
02:45:26,910 --> 02:45:29,071
胜利
Victory!

1461
02:45:29,312 --> 02:45:31,576
我们获胜了
We have victory!

1462
02:45:33,416 --> 02:45:37,375
但是最后可怕的阴影…
But in the end, it's only a passing thing...

1463
02:45:37,654 --> 02:45:39,019
…终究会消失
...this shadow.

1464
02:45:39,255 --> 02:45:42,247
就连黑暗也会消失
Even darkness must pass.

1465
02:45:42,492 --> 02:45:44,858
崭新的一天将会来临
A new day will come.

1466
02:45:45,795 --> 02:45:50,027
太阳也会散发更明亮的光芒
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.

1467
02:45:51,768 --> 02:45:54,066
这才是让人永生难忘
Those were the stories that stayed with you...

1468
02:45:54,270 --> 02:45:55,794
意义非凡的感人故事
...that meant something.

1469
02:45:56,039 --> 02:45:58,940
纵使你太年轻不明白为什么
Even if you were too small to understand why.

1470
02:45:59,943 --> 02:46:03,709
但是我想我明白了
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1471
02:46:03,947 --> 02:46:05,574
我现在明白了
I know now.

1472
02:46:06,616 --> 02:46:08,709
这些故事里的主角
Folk in those stories...

1473
02:46:08,985 --> 02:46:13,046
有很多机会半途而废但是他们并没有
...had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.

1474
02:46:13,289 --> 02:46:15,450
他们决定勇往直前
They kept going...

1475
02:46:16,192 --> 02:46:19,389
因为他们抱着一种信念
...because they were holding on to something.

1476
02:46:21,064 --> 02:46:23,294
我们抱着什么信念？
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1477
02:46:35,278 --> 02:46:39,146
这世上一定存在着善良
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1478
02:46:39,415 --> 02:46:41,940
值得我们奋战到底
And it's worth fighting for.

1479
02:47:08,912 --> 02:47:13,144
我终于了解你的伟大使命佛罗多巴金斯
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.

1480
02:47:13,983 --> 02:47:17,851
你很清楚我国的法律你父王的命令
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.

1481
02:47:18,121 --> 02:47:20,248
如果你把他们放走就会被处死
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

1482
02:47:24,694 --> 02:47:26,025
那么我宁愿死
Then it is forfeit.

1483
02:47:28,832 --> 02:47:30,561
放了他们
Release them.

1484
02:47:41,144 --> 02:47:46,275
索伦在盛怒之下一定会报复
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.

1485
02:47:53,523 --> 02:47:56,458
圣盔谷之役结束了
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1486
02:47:57,193 --> 02:48:00,651
但是捍卫中土世界的圣战才刚开始
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.

1487
02:48:05,835 --> 02:48:09,202
所有人的希望都放在两个小哈比人身上
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...

1488
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:13,403
他们在荒野游荡
...somewhere in the wilderness.

1489
02:48:16,779 --> 02:48:20,112
也许我们会被编成故事或诗歌
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

1490
02:48:20,383 --> 02:48:21,680
什么？
What?

1491
02:48:21,918 --> 02:48:25,786
也许以后会有人说咱们听听佛罗多和魔戒的故事
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "

1492
02:48:26,055 --> 02:48:29,252
另一个人就说是啊，那是我最爱听的故事
And they'll say, "Yes! That's one of my favorite stories. "

1493
02:48:29,492 --> 02:48:32,359
佛罗多真的好勇敢哦对不对，爸爸？
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"

1494
02:48:32,595 --> 02:48:34,187
是啊，孩子
"Yes, my boy.

1495
02:48:34,430 --> 02:48:38,161
他是最有名的哈比人真是了不起
The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot. "

1496
02:48:38,401 --> 02:48:40,869
你忘了一个重要人物
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:

1497
02:48:41,070 --> 02:48:42,901
勇者山姆卫斯
"Samwise the Brave. "

1498
02:48:43,139 --> 02:48:45,801
我想多听听山姆的故事
I want to hear more about Sam.

1499
02:48:50,179 --> 02:48:53,114
佛罗多没有山姆就走不远
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

1500
02:48:54,550 --> 02:48:58,486
别笑我了，佛罗多我是认真的
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious.

1501
02:48:59,689 --> 02:49:00,986
我也是
So was I.

1502
02:49:09,933 --> 02:49:12,561
勇者山姆卫斯
"Samwise the Brave. "

1503
02:49:16,873 --> 02:49:18,135
史麦戈？
Smeagol?

1504
02:49:18,374 --> 02:49:21,207
我们不等你哦，快来吧
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

1505
02:49:21,444 --> 02:49:23,309
主人
Master.

1506
02:49:23,546 --> 02:49:26,481
主人会照顾我们
Master looks after us.

1507
02:49:27,317 --> 02:49:30,013
主人不会伤害我们
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1508
02:49:30,286 --> 02:49:32,686
主人不守信用
Master broke his promise.

1509
02:49:32,922 --> 02:49:35,015
别逼史麦戈
Don't ask Smeagol.

1510
02:49:35,258 --> 02:49:38,386
可怜的史麦戈
Poor, poor Smeagol.

1511
02:49:38,628 --> 02:49:41,392
主人出卖了我们
Master betrayed us.

1512
02:49:41,631 --> 02:49:44,657
奸诈狡猾、虚伪做作
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1513
02:49:44,901 --> 02:49:48,735
我们应该把他的脖子扭断
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

1514
02:49:48,938 --> 02:49:51,600
杀了他
Kill him! Kill him!

1515
02:49:51,841 --> 02:49:53,308
杀了他们两个
Kill them both!

1516
02:49:53,509 --> 02:49:57,070
然后我们抢走宝贝
And then we take the precious...

1517
02:49:57,313 --> 02:50:00,771
自己当主人
...and we be the master!

1518
02:50:01,551 --> 02:50:04,111
可是胖哈比人知道
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1519
02:50:04,387 --> 02:50:06,981
他老是盯着我们
Eyes always watching.

1520
02:50:07,223 --> 02:50:10,715
那就把他的眼睛戳瞎
Then we stabs them out.

1521
02:50:10,960 --> 02:50:15,397
把他的眼珠挖掉让他爬着走
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

1522
02:50:15,631 --> 02:50:19,032
好，好
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1523
02:50:19,235 --> 02:50:21,863
杀了他们两个
Kill them both.

1524
02:50:22,105 --> 02:50:24,573
好，不好！
Yes. No! No!

1525
02:50:24,774 --> 02:50:28,403
太冒险了
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1526
02:50:29,178 --> 02:50:31,703
他在哪儿？他跑哪儿去了？
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1527
02:50:31,981 --> 02:50:34,472
-咕鲁，你在哪儿？-史麦戈
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you? Smeagol?

1528
02:50:34,751 --> 02:50:40,087
我们可以让她下手
We could let her do it.

1529
02:50:41,124 --> 02:50:45,185
是啊，她可以下毒手
Yes. She could do it.

1530
02:50:45,428 --> 02:50:49,922
没错，宝贝，她可以下手
Yes, precious, she could.

1531
02:50:50,166 --> 02:50:56,127
等他们死了我们就把它拿走
And then we takes it once they're dead.

1532
02:50:57,106 --> 02:50:59,082
要等他们死了
Once they're dead.

1533
02:50:59,132 --> 02:51:02,092
Shh.

1534
02:51:04,347 --> 02:51:07,976
来吧，还有好长的路要走
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1535
02:51:08,251 --> 02:51:10,219
史麦戈会带你们去
Smeagol will show you the way.

1536
