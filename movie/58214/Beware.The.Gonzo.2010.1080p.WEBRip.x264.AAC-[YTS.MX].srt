3
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,589
- In the past week,

4
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,291
I ruined my chance
to go to college,

5
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,227
I lost all my friends,

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,563
and I almost ruined
my parents' marriage.

7
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,698
The one girl I ever cared about

8
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,135
will probably never
talk to me again.

9
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,637
And I also got my
face kicked in,

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,273
But,

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,643
after everything I've done

12
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,080
I probably got off easy.

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,384
You believed in me

14
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,354
and I betrayed you all.

15
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,091
(rock music)

16
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,400
- Amy,

17
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,704
I want you on band try-outs
and theater auditions.

18
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,340
It's Pippin this year, right?

19
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,240
Great show.

20
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,208
Jules.

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,142
Jules, Jules.

22
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,143
I need you on the
student parking permits.

23
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,714
Please, they confuse the
hell out of everybody.

24
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,249
Can you do that for me?

25
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,551
All right.

26
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,485
Oh.

27
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,621
There's a new cafeteria policy.

28
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,391
Due to last year's
brawl at McDonald's,

29
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,360
nobody's allowed off
school grounds for lunch.

30
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,761
Not even the seniors.

31
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,463
We're stuck inside all year.

32
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,464
- That sucks.

33
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,164
- It's okay.

34
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm gonna do an op ed on that.

35
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,434
Interview the principal,

36
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,304
it's obviously a
hot-button issue.

37
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,506
Kev, what do you got, bud?

38
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,508
- Football and
wrestling previews, Gav.

39
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,644
And I'd love to do a feature
on the state wrestling champ

40
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,681
at 168 pounds, who
happens to be you.

41
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,183
- All right, well
you're probably

42
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,218
gonna want photos with that,

43
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,252
so meet me in the
gym after school

44
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,489
I'll let you shoot
me in my togs.

45
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,526
- I got a sports story,

46
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,263
but it ain't no
goddamn puff piece.

47
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,332
It's gonna be in two-inch type

48
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,701
right underneath the masthead.

49
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,540
Steroids.

50
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,275
- [Gavin] Good to
see you, Gilman.

51
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,643
- Oh yeah.
- Steroids, huh?

52
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:24,644
- [Gilman] I'm gonna
go undercover on the

53
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,647
football team as assistant
equipment manager.

54
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,549
Blow the lid right
off this bitch.

55
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,284
I mean, find out who's juicing,

56
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,519
where they got the stuff.

57
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,788
- What evidence do you have
that anyone's using steroids?

58
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,789
- Statistics.

59
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,625
It's an epidemic now on
the high school level.

60
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,328
- The high school football
team went two and 12 last year.

61
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,797
Nobody cares enough to cheat.

62
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,201
- Maybe they don't wanna
go two and 12 this year.

63
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,470
Ever think about that?

64
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,738
- It's a ridiculous reach.

65
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,839
Forget it.

66
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:53,540
- [Gilman] At least
read the data.

67
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,475
- I don't need to read the data.

68
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,409
Thanks.

69
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,314
- Who are you trying to protect?

70
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,283
Cough it up, Riley.

71
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,551
How far up does this thing go?

72
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,819
- Take it easy, Oliver Stone.

73
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,388
I just don't want you bugging
my friends with your bullshit.

74
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:08,955
(school bell rings)

75
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:09,656
Okay guys, listen.

76
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,024
These stories are due Friday.

77
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,427
You can just e-mail
them to me, alright?

78
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,699
- Okay, we table
the steroids thing.

79
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,868
What am I gonna do?

80
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,836
You beat me out
for editor, Riley,

81
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,837
but I still have to
make my mark this year.

82
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,608
- First of all, Gilman,
take a giant step back.

83
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,376
You're in my area.

84
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,777
We discussed this

85
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,380
- Okay.

86
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,717
- All right, listen bud.

87
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,354
Why don't you just do a
simple back to school piece?

88
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,490
You know, "Another year
dawns on Parker Prep."

89
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,325
Whatever, just make
sure you include the

90
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,595
changes on the academic
calendar, okay.

91
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,563
- Back to school piece.

92
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,633
It's simple,

93
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,668
it's elegant.

94
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,437
Really gonna have
to put my finger on

95
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,539
the pulse of the student body.

96
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,407
- Yes, fine.

97
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,341
Look, if it's good enough,

98
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,644
I'll even put it on the cover.

99
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,380
Just don't get carried away.

100
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,048
* Winners never quit

101
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,516
* Quitters never win

102
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,650
* I'm lanky

103
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,584
- Gonzo Gilman with the Courier.

104
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,355
Another year dawns,
let's talk about it.

105
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:15,922
Gonzo Gilman with the Courier.

106
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,823
Do you have one minute?

107
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,592
- No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,327
- Gonzo Gilman with the Courier.

109
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,697
What are your hopes

110
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,798
and fears?

111
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,367
* I'm sorry, can
I keep this pen *

112
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,570
- Gonzo Gilman with the Courier.

113
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,674
What are your hopes and
fears for the new year?

114
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,444
- I hope that you
get out of my face

115
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,713
and I fear that you will not.

116
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,384
- Gonzo Gilman with the Courier.

117
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:44,918
I was hoping--

118
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,386
- No.

119
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,520
- Can I quote you on that?

120
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,655
- [Blonde] No.

121
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,768
- Got her digits, man.

122
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,570
Damn, she's hot.

123
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,704
- My friend, Rob, you
would have to undress

124
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,407
that girl with a small crane.

125
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,142
- You've no vision, Gonzo.

126
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,778
Okay that girl loses
this much baby fat,

127
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,614
she'll have the sweetest
ass in the entire school.

128
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,351
And I am gonna be
leading the ground floor.

129
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:20,720
- Interesting.

130
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,423
- You working on a story?

131
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:23,957
- Undercover.

132
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,025
I told you.

133
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:25,725
Two-inch type.

134
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,862
- Right underneath the masthead.

135
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,430
- Hi, Rob.

136
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,865
- Hey, gorgeous.

137
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:32,899
Welcome back.

138
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,503
Mm, this is gonna
be such a good year.

139
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,839
- Dude, she's like
the elephant man.

140
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:43,043
You're the Don Juan of
the physically-deformed.

141
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,644
- Don't hate, okay?

142
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,445
Please, you're better than that.

143
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,514
- Guys, come quick.

144
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,715
It's Schneeman.

145
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,483
(upbeat music)

146
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,885
- Bastards!

147
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,621
How can you all
just stand there?

148
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,556
Schneeman, I'm coming!

149
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,164
- Third year in a row.

150
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,066
My underwear is about to rip.

151
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,100
- I know, I know.

152
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,803
Shh, don't try to
talk right now.

153
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,905
I'm gonna have to
lift you, but gently.

154
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:12,839
Gently.

155
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,911
Got it.

156
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,079
Okay.

157
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,680
Come on down.

158
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,048
Here we go.

159
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:23,817
Here

160
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,751
we

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,021
go.

162
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,791
- [Girl] You okay, Schneeman?

163
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,930
- Did they do this to you?

164
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,932
- [Schneeman] Gavin
Riley wasn't there.

165
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,800
- Listen Schneeman.

166
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,836
This isn't gonna happen again.

167
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,837
- I know.

168
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,706
That is the last time I
wear underwear to school

169
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,941
- No, that's not what I mean.

170
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,809
(school bell rings)

171
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,812
- Okay you geniuses,
here's your reminder.

172
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,047
The submission deadline for the

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,816
Van Buren prize is October 20th.

174
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,853
This is the most
prestigious history

175
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,722
award in the country.

176
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,759
Parker Prep has had
two previous winners.

177
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,562
Gavin's two older
brothers, Marcus and Shawn.

178
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,698
Are you gonna continue
the family dynasty?

179
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,399
(Gavin chuckles)

180
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,633
- They'll disown me if I don't.

181
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,770
- Well you're gonna have some
tough competition this year.

182
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,606
Isn't that right, Mr. Schneeman?

183
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,844
Okay, back to Napoleon.

184
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,846
Another man who had
his eyes on the prize.

185
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,984
Namely, the military
domination of Europe.

186
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,119
- Another year dawns
on Parker Prep,

187
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,056
the 150th in the school history.

188
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,024
For most students, it's
a time to set goals

189
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,959
both academic and personal.

190
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,628
A time to dream,

191
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,631
when everything seems possible.

192
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,900
For others, however,
school is already

193
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,769
a waking nightmare,
a hellish abyss

194
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,605
where bullies prey
sadistically on the weak.

195
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,942
Unpunished, their victims,
too afraid to identify.

196
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,611
* You're used to the idea

197
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,114
* It's not 'cause
you been seen *

198
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,883
* I don't know what to do

199
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,686
* But what you did to me

200
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,022
* I took a piece of you

201
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,925
* And threw it in the sea

202
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,594
* You can't do that to me

203
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,097
* You can't do that to me

204
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,833
* You can't do that to me

205
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,937
* You can't do that to me

206
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,706
(male humming)

207
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,844
- Hey

208
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,745
- Hey, how was the meeting?

209
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,712
Did you settle?

210
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,181
- And a hearty good
evening to you, Diane.

211
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,083
No, we did not settle.

212
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,855
In fact, they threw
the whole thing out.

213
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,789
- What?

214
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,091
Okay, so what happens now?

215
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,159
What, you don't get paid?

216
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,427
You've been working on
this case for six months.

217
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,765
- Well, that's the high stake
world of personal injury law.

218
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:52,799
- Arthur, c'mon.

219
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,933
This has got to stop.

220
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,969
You need to start getting
compensated for your time.

221
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,937
And I'm talking
about actual money.

222
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,239
I'm not talking about
Fernando working

223
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,041
off your fee by doing the hedges

224
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,076
or king Popi giving you that car

225
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,111
truck thingy with
the boat attachment.

226
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,147
- Hey, that's an
87 El Camino, babe.

227
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,148
That's a chariot.

228
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,685
- Look, I know how hard
it is for you to say no,

229
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,953
but you're not working
pro-bono at Legal Aid anymore.

230
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,855
This job is supposed to pay.

231
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,124
- Di, I'm taking every
case I possibly can take.

232
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,194
I'm taking criminal,
divorce, liability.

233
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,996
I'm practically chasing
ambulances down the street.

234
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,664
What else do you want me to do?

235
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,699
- No money, no work.

236
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,000
It's very simple.

237
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,670
- Where's the boy?

238
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,138
- He's in his room.

239
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,073
Eddie!

240
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,208
Dinner!

241
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,276
- I call for a boycott
(rock music)

242
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,678
on all boys varsity
sports events

243
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:39,612
until the culprits step forward

244
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,215
and take responsibility
for their actions.

245
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,018
We can no longer let
this aggression stand.

246
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,119
(door knocking)

247
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:46,986
What?

248
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,754
I'm working!

249
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,855
- Dinner's ready!

250
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,825
- No, I'll eat
later, I'm on a roll!

251
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,164
Hey mom?

252
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,936
Can you just grab me a Red Bull?

253
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,760
Rob, just do me a favor
and read it out loud.

254
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,732
- "Another year
dawns on Parker Prep,

255
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,301
"the 150th in our
schools history."

256
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,270
"For most students,
it's a time to set

257
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,273
"goals both academic
and personal."

258
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,944
"A time to dream when
everything seems possible."

259
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,846
- Keep going, keep going.

260
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,916
- That is the end
of the article.

261
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,151
- No, it's not.

262
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,118
It's continued on another
page or something.

263
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,854
- I don't think so,
there's a period there.

264
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,455
- No, let me see it.

265
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,122
- Usually like it says--

266
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,059
- What's the matter, Gilman?

267
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,695
It's on the cover, isn't it?

268
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,802
- You cut the whole thing?

269
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,936
You had no right to do that!

270
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,973
- I told you what I wanted
and that's what I printed.

271
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,276
- You're just protecting
your neanderthal friends.

272
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,079
It's the same reason you
tabled my steroids story.

273
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,815
That's not what a
newspaper is for!

274
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,950
- You're in my area,
Gilman, I'm warning you.

275
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,119
- A newspaper is for everybody.

276
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,954
It's a public trust!

277
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,092
I told the truth
in that article.

278
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,793
- Back off, freak!

279
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:34,828
I'm serious.

280
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,232
- You think this is
just gonna go away?

281
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,367
That this is just gonna be over?

282
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,837
We're still gonna get
justice for Schneeman, Riley.

283
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,205
You can't stop us!

284
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,242
No justice, no peace!

285
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,111
No justice, no peace!

286
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,347
No justice, no peace!

287
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,216
No justice, no peace!

288
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,219
No justice, no peace!

289
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,388
It's gonna be a
nightmare, Riley.

290
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,056
- You think you can
challenge me, huh?

291
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,424
Huh!

292
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,325
You're out of your league.

293
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,128
Nobody cares what you think.

294
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,929
You understand that?

295
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,067
You better watch your back.

296
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,440
- Are you out of your mind?

297
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,410
I thought you wanted to go
to Columbia for Journalism?

298
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,544
How is getting kicked off the

299
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,380
paper one week into
school gonna help?

300
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,316
You know there are
students with 4.0 averages,

301
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,119
who spend their summers
working with lepers in India

302
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,188
who have a hard time
getting into college!

303
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,057
What the hell are you gonna do?

304
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,193
This was your one
extra-curricular selling point.

305
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,195
- Mom, one notch, okay?

306
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,331
Do me a favor?

307
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,966
- Oh, am I being shrill?

308
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,867
- Yes.

309
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,002
- I'm sorry.

310
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:49,969
It's just that we're
killing ourselves

311
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,104
to put you into this
fancy private school!

312
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,440
You have to hold up your end!

313
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:57,310
- I'm a victim of
injustie, mother.

314
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,379
What do you want me to do?

315
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,180
- Why don't you apologize?

316
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,182
Get back on the paper.

317
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,083
- Apologize?

318
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,017
- Yeah.

319
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,187
- I will never apologize
to Gavin Riley.

320
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,022
I'll say that right now.

321
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:13,093
I'd rather die on my feet
than live on my knees.

322
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,894
"Die on my feet,
live on my knees."

323
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:15,462
Hey, that's pretty good.

324
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,429
Did I just make that up?

325
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,330
- Zapata.

326
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,131
Emiliano Zapata.

327
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,001
Mexican revolutionary.

328
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,469
- Is that all you have to say?

329
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,371
- Have you even
read this, Diane?

330
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,373
He's standing up
for the underdog.

331
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,009
Can't believe they'd
cut a word of this.

332
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,144
I hope you're sending this
to the dean at Columbia.

333
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,480
- Oh yeah, I send everything
I write to Dean Herbert.

334
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:37,350
No response yet, but I know
he'll respect my stand.

335
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:38,184
- Thanks, Arthur,

336
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,987
that's very helpful.
(phone ringing)

337
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:41,521
- I love you very much.

338
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,156
- Hello.

339
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,124
This is she.

340
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:48,261
Yeah, I'm showing it
on a week from Tuesday.

341
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,231
- Your mother's right.

342
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,199
We have sacrificed a lot.

343
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:58,138
Small things like dignity
and a sense of shame but,

344
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,173
for me this isn't about
getting into college.

345
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,410
It's about how far
you're willing to go.

346
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,381
There's always gonna be some
asshole standing in your way.

347
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,450
If there's something
you need to do,

348
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,486
you have to find a way to do it.

349
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,454
Alright?

350
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,523
(fast upbeat music)

351
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:17,457
- Yeah.

352
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,034
Don't you have any pride,

353
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,103
as a professional?

354
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,539
- I don't cook this
crap, I just serve it.

355
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,174
- Great.

356
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,275
What do you recommend?

357
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,176
The stew?

358
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,913
Mac and cheese?

359
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,382
Not the mac and cheese either.

360
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,118
What about this Vienna sausage?

361
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,086
That looks pretty tasty.

362
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,454
Is there anything?

363
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:53,226
Well man, I can't really
eat saltines all year.

364
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,596
Just give me one of
those sandwiches.

365
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,164
- Russian roulette, bro.

366
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,367
- Oh man, sloppy Joe, excellent.

367
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,168
Let me get some of that.

368
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,303
Mm.

369
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,406
So what are you
gonna do about Riley?

370
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,042
- Sit down.

371
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:09,976
- Yeah.

372
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,179
- It's not just that
they cut my article,

373
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:16,316
or the heinous way
they defiled Schneeman.

374
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:20,186
We've been going to this
school for three years

375
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,356
and it's like we've
never even existed.

376
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:29,129
This year was supposed to
be different, remember?

377
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,331
Two weeks in they've
got their feet

378
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,532
on our necks already?

379
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,466
No way!

380
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,971
We're gonna start

381
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:42,175
a fucking revolution
in this place.

382
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,144
- How are we going to do that?

383
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,346
- With a newspaper.

384
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,616
With our own
underground newspaper.

385
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,317
Screw Gavin Riley!

386
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,655
- Gavin Riley owns this place.

387
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:58,391
He'll crush us like bugs.

388
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:01,361
- He's just a man, Schneeman.

389
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:06,299
He's got strengths and
weaknesses like anyone else.

390
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,302
(determined music)

391
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,506
Too many narcs in here.

392
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,508
Let's meet at the
usual place, okay?

393
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,543
After school.

394
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,391
There are only 10
people in this school

395
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,327
that anybody knows
or cares about.

396
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,398
I'm gonna write
about everyone else.

397
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,235
"The Unsung Heroes
of Parker Prep"

398
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,206
That's my idea.

399
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,675
All right, anybody else?

400
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,609
Any ideas?

401
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,478
Anybody?

402
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,581
Rob, why don't you do

403
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:00,253
something on that
mutant harem of yours?

404
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,288
That'll be a real killer.

405
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,256
- Yeah, yeah.

406
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,257
Okay, cool.

407
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,593
- Great.
- Yeah.

408
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:08,495
- [Gonzo] That's what
I'm talking about.

409
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,230
Rob, mutant harem.

410
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,265
Ming.

411
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,567
C'mon.

412
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,169
What do you got?

413
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,107
- Well...

414
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,445
Nobody even thinks
I can speak English

415
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,180
so they blab their
whole lives in front

416
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,549
of me like I'm not even there.

417
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,220
Some of these girls
you wouldn't believe.

418
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:37,157
They act like
they're so perfect,

419
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,726
but I see every single flaw.

420
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,396
Ridiculous clothes
and hideous hair.

421
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,233
And they're just
awful terrible people.

422
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,170
Spoiled two-faced back-stabbers.

423
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,272
Those godless whores.

424
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:56,276
It's all I can do not to vomit
or scream in their faces.

425
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,346
I just wanna like
rip out their hair.

426
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,355
Sometimes, I take pictures
of them with my camera phone.

427
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:12,559
It's my dream of showing
the world the truth.

428
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,595
It'd be funny to
see them cry tears.

429
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,530
Boo hoo hoo.

430
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,134
Boo hoo hoo hoo.

431
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:28,875
- So like a gossip column?

432
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:33,146
Are you talking about
doing a gossip column?

433
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,448
Okay cool.

434
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,417
Ming Na, gossip column.

435
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,289
Mr. Schneeman?

436
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,659
Mr. Scott Marshall Schneeman.

437
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,764
I'm gonna need your
full story, man.

438
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,665
On the record.

439
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,534
Names and everything.

440
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,536
- What is this, the
McCarthy hearings?

441
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,239
- Schneeman, you've
gotta fight back now!

442
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,473
I mean for real!

443
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,512
They've already hung
you by your underwear.

444
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,347
What else can they possibly do?

445
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,815
- That's what I'm worried about.

446
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,551
- Is anybody gonna order food?

447
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,686
- Absolutely, Errol.

448
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,722
One slice of your
famous cherry pie

449
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,525
and four forks.

450
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,198
(horns honking)

451
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,302
(upbeat rock music)

452
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,704
Evie Wallace.

453
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,706
What the hell does she want?

454
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,473
- Easy E.

455
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,607
Hey, you know what?

456
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:35,408
I bet she's working
out of this joint.

457
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,345
- Oh, as a waitress?

458
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,313
- No, she's a hooker, man.

459
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,815
She has sex with guys
in exchange for money.

460
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:42,515
- I know what a hooker is, Rob,

461
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,584
but no, I do not believe that.

462
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,519
- No, that's like
a 100% confirmed.

463
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,388
She sold her cherries to
some Japanese businessman

464
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,390
over the internet for $50,000,

465
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,293
which is like 520,000 Yen.

466
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,628
- She doesn't dress
like a hooker.

467
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,464
Her clothes are flawless.

468
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,498
- Also for her first time

469
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,833
she blew the entire
wrestling team last year.

470
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,602
100% confirmed from
multiple sources.

471
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,405
- Gavin Riley is an
evil son of a bitch

472
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:06,606
and anything that will
knock him down a peg

473
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:10,877
or even annoy him a little
bit, I'd like to be a part of.

474
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,379
- Have a seat.

475
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,656
I'm Gonzo Gilman,
I'm in charge here.

476
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,559
- I assume you
all know who I am?

477
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:31,931
- Well I don't really know
how you found out about us,

478
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:35,402
but now that you're here,
let me get you up to speed.

479
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,603
We're starting a newspaper here

480
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,673
and we plan on pissing
a lot of people off.

481
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,542
- No you're not gonna
make a newspaper.

482
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,877
- Why not?

483
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,346
- Newspapers are dead, okay?

484
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,449
You've gotta do a website
or it's a total joke.

485
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,452
- No, we're not hiding behind
usernames in cyberspace,

486
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,521
this is gonna be a
communal experience.

487
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,456
Something tangible,
an actual thing

488
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,557
that you can hold in your hands

489
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,660
and get the ink on your fingers.

490
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:01,594
Newspapers are dead.

491
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:02,595
You know no one really
asked you anyway.

492
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,663
You just walked in here.

493
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:06,766
You can go home
and blog yourself.

494
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,402
- Dude, what are you doing?

495
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,771
You know she could give
us a lot of street cred.

496
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,673
- Okay, let me
ask you something.

497
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,809
How do you plan
on paying for it?

498
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:19,379
Newspapers cost a lot of
money to print, ya know.

499
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:20,947
- Advertising.

500
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,816
We hit every mom and
pop shop in this town

501
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,618
getting crushed by
these soulless chains,

502
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,420
introduce them to a
whole new consumer.

503
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,589
- I'll take out an ad.

504
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,724
Couldn't hurt.

505
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,693
It's 50 for a full page.

506
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:34,728
- How about 40.

507
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:35,662
- Done.

508
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,832
See?

509
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,033
Don't worry about
the money, covered.

510
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:43,770
- Look, even the New York
Times has a website component.

511
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,738
Talk-backs,

512
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:46,673
videos,

513
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:48,575
blogs.

514
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,711
I mean you wanna interact
with your readers, right?

515
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:52,612
You,

516
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,616
you want a reaction don't you?

517
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:58,985
- I don't know anything
about web design.

518
00:21:59,019 --> 00:21:59,886
- I do.

519
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,088
I can format your
whole newspaper.

520
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:05,425
- See, I have very specific
ideas about the formatting.

521
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,762
We'd have to work very
closely, together.

522
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,466
- Are you gonna go
all the way with this?

523
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,669
Or are you gonna, punk out?

524
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,674
- What do you think?

525
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,913
- I think we're all
gonna go home together

526
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,548
in this direction.

527
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,550
You guys can stay here.

528
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,385
We'll see you later.

529
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,492
- I have this pretty
classic picture of Schneeman

530
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,960
we should probably
use for the cover.

531
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,395
- Yeah, cool.

532
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,764
Let me give you my email.

533
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,766
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

534
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,805
(loud rap music)

535
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,039
- The bubonic plague!

536
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:57,510
Yo, better double bag Gilman
or your dick's gonna fall off.

537
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:58,178
Off!

538
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,579
- You have no dick, asshole!

539
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:00,513
Piss off!

540
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:11,658
I hope you don't believe
everything you hear.

541
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:12,559
- No.

542
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,496
You know if they're lying,

543
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,098
you should write something too.

544
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,500
Set the record straight.

545
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,968
- Yeah, maybe I will.

546
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,708
- What happened between
you and Gavin Riley?

547
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,577
- That's nobody's business.

548
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,680
(instrumental music)

549
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,535
- You're a motherfucker
on that triangle, man.

550
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,569
- Thanks.

551
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,604
- What's your name?

552
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:00,073
- Oh, I'm Dave Melnick.

553
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,910
- Dave, tell me, how'd
you like to be a star?

554
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,847
- I'd like to be a star.

555
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,752
* I'm checking every
paper that I see *

556
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:16,589
* Hardly hear a mention on TV

557
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:20,093
* Who'd of thought
disease could be passe *

558
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:23,897
* It's looking like it
turned out that way *

559
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,098
* They make it like it said

560
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:29,803
* You go outside
(brace squeaking)

561
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:34,107
- [Rob] Most people only
see a block of stone.

562
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,811
The artist sees the
statue trapped inside.

563
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,715
* And someone needs sorrow

564
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:44,050
- Kev, Julie's my best friend.

565
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:47,620
- But you're so freaking hot.

566
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,521
- I know.

567
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:55,528
* This statement needs
a fire right in here *

568
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,768
- You skanky little ho.

569
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,677
* You're acting
like the doctor *

570
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,612
* Perfect cure

571
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,048
- [Schneeman] "You can chain
me, you can torture me,

572
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,017
"you can destroy my body,

573
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,652
"but you will never
imprison my mind."

574
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,021
Mohandas Gandhi.

575
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:22,789
- So check it out.

576
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,625
I finally got
those last two ads.

577
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:29,796
RJ's Records on Main
St and that kid Django

578
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,665
who sells weed on
the playground.

579
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,169
- I'll scan them in.

580
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,570
- Yeah, good.

581
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,877
- What are you up to, Gilman?

582
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,646
- If this school's an ass,

583
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,847
that's my foot.

584
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:55,989
Triple 10s.

585
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,201
- [Gavin] Pathetic.

586
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:18,311
- [Gonzo] Evie.

587
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:19,245
- [Evie] Did you get it?

588
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,880
- The double-thumb Gonzo Fist.

589
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:21,948
Hunter S. Thompson.

590
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:25,085
It really grabs the eye by
the balls of the throat.

591
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:26,753
- That doesn't make any sense,

592
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,855
but think I know what you mean.

593
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:29,989
I'm gonna stay up tonight,

594
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:30,757
see if I can finish
the whole lay-out.

595
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,094
(school bell rings)

596
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:47,173
Gonzo files number one.

597
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,048
- Oh my God,

598
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:56,850
Evie.

599
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,954
This looks so professional.

600
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,124
I love it.

601
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,926
- Wait till you see the website.

602
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:12,298
- I kinda hope Schneeman
doesn't get murdered for this.

603
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:14,000
- I know, berserk.

604
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,705
- Oh, this one's mine.

605
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:22,942
You might think it's
stupid so just--

606
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:23,877
- Evie.

607
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:28,782
I have like 40 plus
moronic ideas every second

608
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,217
and I tend to express them all.

609
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:38,158
A sex advise column?

610
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:42,696
This is cruel.

611
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,267
- If they want a whore,
I'll give them a whore.

612
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,103
(boys laughing)

613
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,242
Bastards.

614
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:01,014
Let them see how it feels.

615
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,116
- Ever feel lost, lonely,

616
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,119
weird, really ugly?

617
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,989
Last to get the joke?

618
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,359
You ever wonder
where the party is?

619
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:15,328
You ever get a dodge
ball on your face?

620
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:18,965
Pop a boner in your sweat pants?

621
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:22,969
Ever feel embarrassed
about being smart?

622
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:25,305
Ever feel just like
staying in bed all day,

623
00:28:25,338 --> 00:28:27,207
all week, all year?

624
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,810
You ever feel misunderstood,
cheated, alone?

625
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:34,981
Ever wonder why nothing
ever feels easy, ever?

626
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:37,183
Well, this paper's for you.

627
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:42,055
Welcome to the Gonzo Files.

628
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:44,357
(rock music)

629
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:50,864
- Hey, that's me.

630
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:57,237
Look she's making herself puke.

631
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:01,041
Thanks for the unrealistic
body image, bitch.

632
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:01,975
- What?

633
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,280
I'm not bulimic, you asshole.

634
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,949
I was puking my guts out
from the cafeteria food.

635
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,184
- [Woman] Right.

636
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:23,029
- [Male] The Hendrix
of the triangle?

637
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:23,930
Yeah.

638
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:38,978
- [Male] Oh my God.

639
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:39,913
That's brutal.

640
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,281
- [Male] Hardcore.

641
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,919
- [Male] Damn, they put
him in a whole locker!

642
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,288
- [Male] Who are these creeps?

643
00:29:55,028 --> 00:29:56,296
- You whore!

644
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:59,165
(girls grunting)

645
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,209
- [Woman] Knock it off!

646
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:10,310
- "I have had the
misfortune of being bullied

647
00:30:10,343 --> 00:30:14,914
"by Johnny Rock since he
came to Parker in 9th grade.

648
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:15,982
"Over the years
he has worked long

649
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:19,486
"and hard to perfect his
patented wedgie technique

650
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,955
"that combines elements
of public humiliation

00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,923
"and excruciating physical pain

"Take it from me, in the
world of raging assholes--"

654
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:35,301
- "Johnny Rock stands alone."

655
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:39,139
Congratulations, Johnny.

656
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:40,273
You earned it.

657
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,077
Now if you'll excuse us,

658
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,879
we're late for gym.

659
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:52,519
- Physical education,
that's important.

660
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:55,255
Why aren't you dead right now?

661
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:02,696
- [Male] Everyone knows
Marlene Katsmeyer's

662
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:05,131
curvy just not like this.

663
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,368
Haters, eat your hearts out.

664
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:11,971
- Damn, Elephant girl
really is smokin'.

665
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,108
Horny Rob!

666
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,210
You go, boy!

667
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:28,588
- Oh my god.

668
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:29,422
Oh my god.

669
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:30,357
Wait, listen to this.

670
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,327
"Dear Easy E, I have
a very small penis.

671
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:36,963
"In fact, I'm one

"Sincerely, Ryan McCloud."

678
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,618
That preppy guy who
always wears rugby shirts.

679
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:02,022
(everyone laughing)

680
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:10,430
- This letter is bullshit!

681
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:15,001
(everyone laughing)

682
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,003
I am long

683
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:20,974
and strong!

684
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,143
- No.

685
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:27,347
I've seen your sad,
sad excuse for a penis.

686
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,384
Last year when I gave you a
hummer in the boys' bathroom?

687
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:33,586
Don't you remember?

688
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,425
I mean, at least that's
what you told everybody.

689
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,995
What are you, you
saying it's not true?

690
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:51,504
You're a nasty little
liar, aren't you, Ryan?

691
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:53,306
Say it.

692
00:32:56,476 --> 00:33:01,481
Say "I'm a nasty little liar
and I deserve to be spanked."

693
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:03,016
Say it.

694
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:05,118
- Say it.
- Say it!

695
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,686
- [Crowd] Say it, say it!

696
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,089
Say it, say it!

697
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:10,256
Say it, say it!

698
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:13,293
- Say it.

699
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,563
- You can go to hell!

700
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,537
- I want these
written in English.

701
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:26,306
- [Intercom] Attention.

702
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,541
Attention students,
will Edward Gilman

703
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:31,211
please report to the
principal Roy's Office.

704
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:34,247
(everyone cheering)

705
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:52,098
Ah, Mr. Gilman.

706
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:56,202
You caused quite
a commotion today.

707
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:58,338
But that's now always
such a bad thing, yes?

708
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,439
- No.

709
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:02,175
We think it's
cute, what you did.

710
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:04,511
- Cute?

711
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:06,746
- Well, you certainly
hit a nerve.

712
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,148
Have a seat.

713
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,688
Now, there's a lot about your

714
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,557
paper that is inappropriate.

715
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,492
and in very poor taste

716
00:34:19,526 --> 00:34:23,463
and I seriously considered
disciplining you.

717
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,632
But your essential message

718
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,172
saluting the unsung heroes of
Parker Prep has real value.

719
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:37,444
Gonzo,

720
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:43,616
as long as you agree
to tone it down, a lot,

721
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,487
and to work under
Gavin's supervision,

722
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,356
we're prepared to give
you a small budget

723
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,457
and to make your little paper

724
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,660
an official supplement
of The Courier.

725
00:34:58,798 --> 00:35:01,334
Well, what do you think?

726
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:02,769
(Gavin clears throat)

727
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:04,471
- Well, gentlemen,

728
00:35:05,572 --> 00:35:07,774
I'm flattered by your offer.

729
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,376
Really.

730
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:10,410
But you see,

731
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:15,215
if I accept your money

732
00:35:15,248 --> 00:35:17,484
then I have to
accept your rules.

733
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:22,288
And sorry, but my readers
will not allow the Gonzo

734
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:24,424
to be censored by anybody.

735
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:28,261
- Let me put it another way.

736
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,630
If you put out another issue,

737
00:35:30,663 --> 00:35:33,400
I'm going to suspend you.

738
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:34,601
- Huh.

739
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:37,771
Well I guess you'll
do what you have to do

740
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:40,473
and I'll do what I have to do.

741
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:43,576
Meeting adjourned?

742
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,511
Great.

743
00:35:46,513 --> 00:35:48,415
- Big mistake, Gilman.

744
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:50,717
Big mistake.

745
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:56,523
- May I say it was fun?

746
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:02,362
It's been a really long
time since I've had fun.

747
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,531
- Cute.

748
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:07,534
He called my paper "cute."

749
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:08,301
- [Evie] Who?

750
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:09,502
- Who do you think?

751
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:10,470
- Look, Riley?

752
00:36:11,738 --> 00:36:15,508
Who cares what that
asshole thinks.

753
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:17,677
Don't let him get
in your head, Gonzo.

754
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:18,812
That's what he wants.

755
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:20,680
- What if he's right?

756
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:23,750
What if people really
do see this paper

757
00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:25,585
as just another prank?

758
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:29,289
Like streaking across
stage during graduation.

759
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:31,891
- But that's not what this is.

760
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:34,594
Look, on the website,

761
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,830
people are already
sending me letters.

762
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,733
Real letters looking for advice.

763
00:36:39,766 --> 00:36:43,603
And not just about
perverted sex shit either.

764
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:45,672
You have no idea how many girls

765
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:48,842
were screwed over
in this school.

766
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,445
I'm gonna try and help.

767
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,681
- See that's cool.

768
00:36:56,516 --> 00:37:00,487
I mean yeah, your
thing is really cool.

769
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,921
What did I write?

770
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:04,691
About some stupid shit
about a triangle player.

771
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:09,529
Great reporters find great
subjects, change things.

772
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:12,332
- Give yourself a break.

773
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:14,567
It was only the first issue.

774
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:18,538
(rock music)

775
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:27,814
- Okay, this is the premise.

776
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:29,549
Parker Prep was actually built

777
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,685
over a graveyard for
the criminally insane.

778
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:34,387
And now, these psychotic
ghosts all rise

779
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,524
up from the dead and
killing everyone in school.

780
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:38,525
It's up to a band
of brave students

781
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:42,629
well-versed in the dark
arts to save the day.

782
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:46,733
- And these brave students
are led by Hyperion?

783
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,868
- That is correct.

784
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,904
- I have the first
16 issues ready.

785
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:52,405
- Deadline's November 23rd.

786
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:52,972
Next!

787
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:54,341
- I devised Wordoku.

788
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:58,578
Which is like Sudoku
but for word lovers.

789
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,714
They're fiendishly clever.

790
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:14,327
- I don't think so.

791
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:17,697
- This is a manifesto
on the coming

792
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:20,567
environmental apocalypse.

793
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,503
I wanna print it
on the front page.

794
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:24,471
Every word.

795
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:28,508
- That's cool, man.

796
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:29,442
Okay.

797
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:33,413
Glad someone's looking ahead.

798
00:38:33,446 --> 00:38:35,448
Planning for the future.

799
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,452
- "It's called out and
about in Parker Prep"

800
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:40,520
If you're in the closet,

801
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:44,457
we will hunt you down and
drag you out by force.

802
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,960
We're bullshit detectors too.

803
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:47,927
- Right on.

804
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:52,532
- His problem is he's
not horny enough.

805
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,101
I want nudity.

806
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:59,506
I want spy cams in the girls'
locker room kinda shit.

807
00:39:00,073 --> 00:39:02,575
I mean quit teasing me, man.

808
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:03,777
- More T and A.

809
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:06,813
Duly noted, thank you very much.

810
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:09,949
- You don't have to
be dicks about it.

811
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:17,023
- I'm Stone, this is Malloy.

812
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:19,759
- What are you guys, characters
from a mid-70s cop show?

813
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:23,496
(friends chuckling)

814
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,798
- No, we're sophomores.

815
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:26,933
And we love The Gonzo.

816
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:28,702
- We want be your
interns, ya know.

817
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:29,936
Fetch you coffee.

818
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,638
- Run your errands, whatever.

819
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:33,573
- We just wanna learn.

820
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,577
- Yeah.

821
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,912
You guys wanna help?

822
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:39,879
Get everybody in a line.

823
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:40,580
Tell them they'll all
get a chance as long

824
00:39:40,613 --> 00:39:44,417
as they order something to eat.

825
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:46,786
- You mean we're hired?

826
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,687
- Correct.

827
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:51,691
(upbeat music)

828
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:52,992
- [Stone] Okay, people!

829
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:55,595
You wanna talk, you gotta eat!

830
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:59,032
- [Malloy] Take a menu
and line your asses up!

831
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:01,968
- Stone and Malloy,
good addition.

832
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,107
(school bell rings)

833
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,241
- Hey!

834
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,743
Are you gonna tell
me what's going on?

835
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:10,810
- With what?

836
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:12,078
- With Easy.

837
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:14,581
You're hanging out, right?

838
00:40:14,614 --> 00:40:15,115
- No.

839
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:16,683
- C'mon.

840
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:18,818
She 420-friendly,
bareback-rider,

841
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:19,953
- Dude, c'mon.

842
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:21,955
Stop.

843
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:23,623
She's not like that.

844
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:24,824
- No, no.

845
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:25,792
You are spending all
of your time with her.

846
00:40:25,825 --> 00:40:28,695
You cannot tell me that
you're just friends.

847
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:29,596
- We're

848
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:31,798
colleagues.

849
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,568
Yeah, colleagues.

850
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:40,006
- Oh Jesus, you are an idiot!

851
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:43,843
You.

852
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:46,479
Sloppy Joe-time, of course.

853
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,983
Oh, fantastic!

854
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:51,051
Thank you very much.

855
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:51,985
I'm telling you, sir,
you need to try this out.

856
00:40:52,018 --> 00:40:53,853
It's unbelievable.

857
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:59,159
- Look, I bring my
lunch from home.

858
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:00,927
I'll give you half.

859
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:04,130
It's brain food.

860
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:05,665
- Oh no!

861
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:06,966
No, that shit is nasty.

862
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,834
Please okay.

863
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:10,070
Just give my man the Joe.

864
00:41:12,038 --> 00:41:13,673
- I think I want the Joe.

865
00:41:13,707 --> 00:41:14,774
- Give him the Joe.

866
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:15,775
- Okay!

867
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:16,876
Alright.

868
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,912
You want the Sloppy Joe?

869
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:21,648
You got it.

870
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:24,150
Here, take a little more.

871
00:41:24,184 --> 00:41:25,085
Nice and

872
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,054
sloppy.

873
00:41:29,189 --> 00:41:32,058
(Gonzo vomiting)

874
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:34,594
- How long's he been in there?

875
00:41:34,627 --> 00:41:35,161
- A while.

876
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:35,962
He's been there a while.

877
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:38,064
He's got a weak stomach.

878
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,167
- I hope he's okay.

879
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:44,037
- Yeah, yeah, I'm
sure he's fine.

880
00:41:46,072 --> 00:41:46,840
You okay.

881
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:47,774
Doing well these days?

882
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:48,675
- Yeah.

883
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,110
Yeah?

884
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:51,611
- I've got it!

885
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:54,147
We do an investigative piece

886
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,050
into the health conditions
in our cafeteria.

887
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:00,820
They shut us in that lunchroom
and then they poison us!

888
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,922
I bet a lot of kids have
gotten sick this year.

889
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:03,923
We have to find out why.

890
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:05,325
- I'm gonna give you a
couple of breath mints.

891
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:07,761
'Cause your breath
really smell bad right

892
00:42:07,794 --> 00:42:10,797
now due to the vomit
in your throat.

893
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:13,833
It's gonna help.

894
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:16,903
- This is the story.

895
00:42:16,936 --> 00:42:19,039
- Where do we start?

896
00:42:19,072 --> 00:42:21,741
- We have to get the
school nurse's records.

897
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:22,676
- Gonzo!

898
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:24,644
Those are confidential.

899
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:25,512
It'll never happen.

900
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:28,948
- Right, and all
part of the cover-up.

901
00:42:28,982 --> 00:42:29,749
- Yeah.

902
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:30,250
Let me get my laptop.

903
00:42:30,283 --> 00:42:32,085
I got an idea.

904
00:42:32,118 --> 00:42:33,019
- [Gonzo] What's your idea?

905
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,822
- Let's put a poll
question on the website.

906
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:38,591
(upbeat music)

907
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:48,868
Let's see if we
got any responses.

908
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,670
- Yeah.

909
00:42:50,704 --> 00:42:53,073
* This is what I like to say

910
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:56,976
* Talking on the phone

911
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,045
* Just walk away

912
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,714
* And cry

913
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:03,083
* For so long

914
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,085
- Oh, sorry.

915
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:08,121
Not a lot of people
come up here.

916
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:10,957
No one, actually, comes up here.

917
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:13,059
- I'll be good.

918
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:15,161
You won't have to hit me.

919
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:22,836
* Listen to the
voice that says *

920
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:24,304
* Oh alright

921
00:43:24,337 --> 00:43:26,806
- [Evie] Oh my God, we
have 11 hits already.

922
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,641
- You're kidding me.

923
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:33,913
- Look who's liking
the site now, huh?

924
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,815
- I can see that
it's a useful tool.

925
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:39,219
I don't see why you have
to rub it in my face.

926
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:41,755
- Hey look, that cheerleader
really wasn't bulimic.

927
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:44,257
She was out of school
with salmonella.

928
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,261
- Salmonella is a
really serious illness.

929
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:50,163
She probably got
a doctor's note.

930
00:43:50,196 --> 00:43:52,032
- That's hard evidence,
we can print it.

931
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:53,266
- Could scan it.

932
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,803
- This is really big.

933
00:43:56,836 --> 00:43:59,906
- We have to
interview everybody.

934
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:02,909
- Okay, let's go
over what we know.

935
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:06,780
The majority of these complaints

936
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:10,917
are about the Sloppy Joe,
the taco, or the burger.

937
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:13,219
So, class,

938
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:18,058
what do all these
things have in common?

939
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:18,958
- The meat.

940
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:19,859
- The meat.

941
00:44:19,893 --> 00:44:20,994
- The meat.

942
00:44:21,027 --> 00:44:22,062
- The meat!

943
00:44:22,095 --> 00:44:23,163
- Good job, Rob.

944
00:44:23,196 --> 00:44:23,930
- Thank you.

945
00:44:23,963 --> 00:44:25,932
- Yeah, the meat.

946
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:26,833
The beef.

947
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,804
I wonder what company
Parker Prep uses?

948
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:33,306
- You could ask
Principal Roy about that.

949
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,374
- No, I couldn't.

950
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:39,045
'Cause then he'd know
we're doing another issue.

951
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:41,114
Only one way to find out.

952
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,958
(rock music)

953
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:18,318
- Let's do it.

954
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:41,875
- [Gonzo] My God, look!

955
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:46,913
(cans clanking)
(rats squeaking)

956
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:56,389
- Anybody in here?

957
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:10,303
Goddamn, Ratatouille!

958
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:12,806
Every night with you guys!

959
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,484
- Let's keep shooting.

960
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:26,920
This stuff is gold.

961
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:28,455
Not only were
conditions shocking,

962
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:32,092
but further investigation
revealed this meat

963
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:35,161
Which is only used in pet
food and school lunches.

964
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:38,932
The expiration dates
were all slightly off.

965
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:45,438
Gonzo people demand answers.

966
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:48,208
Gonzo people demand justice.

967
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:51,244
We will not stop
until both are ours.

968
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:53,113
- Unacceptable!

969
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:54,481
- I told you I wasn't lying.

970
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:57,117
This is why I puked, bitches.

971
00:46:58,385 --> 00:46:59,953
- [Woman] Oh my god!

972
00:46:59,986 --> 00:47:01,921
Have you seen this?

973
00:47:01,955 --> 00:47:03,123
This is disgusting.

974
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:05,025
I'm never going in there again.

975
00:47:05,058 --> 00:47:07,527
- The ink work is insane.

976
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,263
This is like early Steve Ditko.

977
00:47:11,264 --> 00:47:12,966
- Thanks, bro.

978
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:14,467
I can put you in the next issue.

979
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,870
Any superpower you want.

980
00:47:17,537 --> 00:47:20,140
- I wanna see through walls.

981
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:23,143
- Yes!

982
00:47:23,176 --> 00:47:26,346
(people chattering)

983
00:47:40,994 --> 00:47:42,429
- You're kidding me.

984
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,399
Okay, everybody!

985
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:47,600
Listen up!

986
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:52,572
There are inspectors from
the Board of Health in there.

987
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:55,175
They're shutting
the cafeteria down!

988
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,076
We won!

989
00:47:56,109 --> 00:47:59,079
(crowd cheering)

990
00:47:59,112 --> 00:48:01,381
So I don't think Roy can
keep us inside anymore.

991
00:48:01,414 --> 00:48:05,018
I mean, we've gotta
eat somewhere, right?

992
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:06,553
Let's get the hell outta here!

993
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:09,289
(crowd cheering)

994
00:48:09,322 --> 00:48:11,057
- [Crowd] Gonzo! Gonzo!

995
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:12,125
Gonzo! Gonzo!

996
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,227
Gonzo! Gonzo!

997
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:18,932
- I'm hungry!

998
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,402
Get some mushu pork!

999
00:48:23,536 --> 00:48:26,106
Get a salad for Christ sake!

1000
00:48:40,153 --> 00:48:44,124
- You really think you
can beat me, Gilman?

1001
00:48:44,157 --> 00:48:45,058
Please.

1002
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:49,562
You're playing checkers
and I'm playing chess.

1003
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:52,065
I'm always 10 steps ahead.

1004
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,101
- Whatever, man.

1005
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:57,470
- Roy would like to see you.

1006
00:48:57,504 --> 00:48:58,405
Now.

1007
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:02,509
- We had no idea he
was even doing this.

1008
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:03,710
Doesn't that bother you?

1009
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,546
- Honey, you act like he's
building bombs in the garage.

1010
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:08,515
- He's been suspended, Arthur.

1011
00:49:08,548 --> 00:49:10,383
That means he can't
make the honor roll.

1012
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,085
His grades are slipping too.

1013
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:13,486
Columbia's gonna laugh at him.

1014
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,355
- You are like a robot now.

1015
00:49:15,388 --> 00:49:16,256
Who's programming you?

1016
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:17,457
This is magic.

1017
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,491
Okay?

1018
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:19,359
Some people never
do anything this

1019
00:49:19,392 --> 00:49:19,926
special their whole lives

1020
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:22,495
and you are missing it.

1021
00:49:22,529 --> 00:49:25,065
I'm not even sure they have
a right to suspend you.

1022
00:49:25,098 --> 00:49:27,167
We should, I mean,
you should fight it.

1023
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,201
There are some first
amendment issues here.

1024
00:49:28,234 --> 00:49:29,436
- Oh god, not the
First Amendment.

1025
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:32,272
- He should be able to write
what he wants to write Diane.

1026
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:34,507
No one's disputing the
facts of the story are they?

1027
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:35,575
- Oh my god, stop it!

1028
00:49:35,608 --> 00:49:37,277
Do you want to
make a bigger mess?

1029
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,178
Let him get through high school

1030
00:49:38,211 --> 00:49:40,380
then he can save the world.

1031
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:41,614
Listen, Eddie.

1032
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,516
I know how special you are.

1033
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,220
But you just can't
act on every impulse.

1034
00:49:47,253 --> 00:49:50,123
If you don't plan for life
and put things in place,

1035
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:51,591
you're gonna regret it.

1036
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:52,525
Trust me.

1037
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:57,564
(rock music)

1038
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:01,601
(door knocking)

1039
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,415
- Are you Gonzo Gilman?

1040
00:50:15,448 --> 00:50:17,584
The Parker Prep whistle-blower?

1041
00:50:17,617 --> 00:50:19,119
- Yeah that's me.

1042
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:20,220
- I'm Charlie Ronald.

1043
00:50:20,253 --> 00:50:23,323
I do a segment called
Local Heroes on New York 3.

1044
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:24,724
- Oh yeah.

1045
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:27,227
Charlie Ronald, On the streets.

1046
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,561
- And in your face.

1047
00:50:28,595 --> 00:50:30,230
That's me, yeah.

1048
00:50:30,263 --> 00:50:32,465
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

1049
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:34,067
- Oh yeah, sure.

1050
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:38,538
- You might wanna put
some pants on first.

1051
00:50:43,276 --> 00:50:44,310
- How'd you find me?

1052
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:46,346
- You're not the only
one chasing stories, kid.

1053
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:48,148
* Get behind the struggle

1054
00:50:48,181 --> 00:50:49,749
* Get behind the struggle

1055
00:50:49,783 --> 00:50:50,450
- Stencil.

1056
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:53,253
Here you go, man, that's yours.

1057
00:50:53,286 --> 00:50:56,356
Look, Gonzo's like
Nelson Mandela

1058
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:57,624
or John Gotti.

1059
00:50:57,657 --> 00:50:59,325
Someone who fought
for his people,

1060
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,760
ended up in jail because of it.

1061
00:51:00,794 --> 00:51:03,196
And now, it's all of
our responsibility

1062
00:51:03,229 --> 00:51:05,665
to spread the word, okay!

1063
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:08,535
I mean, are you
with us, brother?

1064
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,238
That's what I'm talking about.

1065
00:51:12,272 --> 00:51:13,707
- We've gotten 97 signatures.

1066
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,209
Roy's gotta know
how we feel, man.

1067
00:51:16,242 --> 00:51:17,777
No justice, no peace!

1068
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:19,679
- [Everyone] No
justice, no peace!

1069
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:20,747
No justice!

1070
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,617
- Who said the revolution
wouldn't be televised?

1071
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,323
- Now that's what I call lunch.

1072
00:51:30,357 --> 00:51:32,292
- You watching it?

1073
00:51:32,325 --> 00:51:33,426
- It's insane.

1074
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,595
- [Charlie] 27 code violations
in the school cafeteria,

1075
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:38,465
but Principal Roy still
refuses to comment.

1076
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:39,466
- We'll be making
a full statement.

1077
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:41,201
Okay, we're not gonna do
it in the parking lot.

1078
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:42,302
All right, not now!

1079
00:51:42,335 --> 00:51:43,236
- [Charlie] Meanwhile Gonzo
Gilman is sweating out

1080
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:44,304
the 4th day of a week-long
- Shh, shh, shh.

1081
00:51:44,337 --> 00:51:48,241
- [Charlie] suspension
that many feel is unjust.

1082
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:49,743
The question must be asked.

1083
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:51,711
Is the wrong person
being punished here?

1084
00:51:51,745 --> 00:51:54,514
Does Parker Prep even have
the right to censor him?

1085
00:51:54,547 --> 00:51:56,783
This is Charlie Ronald
for New York Free News.

1086
00:51:56,816 --> 00:52:00,387
On the streets and in your face.

1087
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,521
- [Reporter] And now with
a look at your weather,

1088
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:02,689
here's Robert.

1089
00:52:04,424 --> 00:52:06,359
- Charlie Ronald is
your old college buddy.

1090
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:08,828
You made him do
this, didn't you?

1091
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:10,797
You know how Eddie
gets carried away.

1092
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,665
You're just setting
him up for a fall.

1093
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:15,735
- I know your early
decision at Brown, Evie.

1094
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:17,671
But check this out.

1095
00:52:17,704 --> 00:52:21,775
The dean from Columbia
finally wrote me back.

1096
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:24,444
He's impressed with my stuff

1097
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:26,813
and apparently, I'm
on the shortlist.

1098
00:52:26,846 --> 00:52:28,782
I know, it's huge.

1099
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:33,353
Dean fucking Herbert on
the Gonzo's jock, you know?

1100
00:52:34,587 --> 00:52:36,723
- Who says he's gonna fall?

1101
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:41,327
- Hey, come back
and see us again.

1102
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:42,829
I sing on Thursdays.

1103
00:52:42,862 --> 00:52:45,331
- [Customer] See ya later.

1104
00:52:49,502 --> 00:52:52,472
- That's a good cup of coffee.

1105
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:53,840
Busy day, huh?

1106
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:56,776
- Just like the old
days before McDonald's

1107
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,745
and Pizza Hut moved in.

1108
00:52:59,646 --> 00:53:02,582
You couldn't get a
table in this place.

1109
00:53:02,615 --> 00:53:05,485
- This whole Gonzo thing
must be good for you, huh?

1110
00:53:05,518 --> 00:53:08,855
- Saved my business,
I'll tell you that.

1111
00:53:08,888 --> 00:53:11,291
For now anyway.

1112
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:14,427
- Well, it cuts both
ways, doesn't it?

1113
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:16,863
- What do you mean?

1114
00:53:16,896 --> 00:53:19,766
- Well, you are his
biggest advertiser, right?

1115
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:22,402
- First advertiser too.

1116
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:26,573
I'm the one that got
the whole ball rolling.

1117
00:53:26,606 --> 00:53:27,507
- You see?

1118
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:29,909
He couldn't do it without you.

1119
00:53:29,943 --> 00:53:33,313
- I guess we helped each other.

1120
00:53:33,346 --> 00:53:34,781
- I'll say you have.

1121
00:53:36,516 --> 00:53:38,351
- Listen, we're
open in the backroom

1122
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:40,487
for the first time since '98.

1123
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,589
We're gonna have a big party.

1124
00:53:42,622 --> 00:53:43,623
Why don't you come.

1125
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:44,357
- Saturday night?

1126
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:44,958
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1127
00:53:44,991 --> 00:53:47,460
- [Errol] It'll be fun.

1128
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:48,528
- Maybe I'll check it out.

1129
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:51,464
(loud rock music)

1130
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:00,507
* Well I light the fire

1131
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,910
* 'Cause it's getting dark

1132
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:07,447
* Take take a light

1133
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,916
* Tear it apart

1134
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:11,851
- Thank you very much.

1135
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:13,920
- Hey, what's up?

1136
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:14,921
- Hey, is Gonzo here yet?

1137
00:54:14,954 --> 00:54:15,989
He's coming, right?

1138
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:16,890
- He said he was
coming but you know,

1139
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:19,526
he's grounded so who knows.

1140
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:20,794
- Okay.

1141
00:54:20,827 --> 00:54:21,695
Hey, dude!

1142
00:54:33,873 --> 00:54:36,576
(dog barking)

1143
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,719
(rock music)

1144
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:52,726
* Oh let us be

1145
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:55,929
* Oh let us be

1146
00:54:55,962 --> 00:54:59,632
* Oh let us be

1147
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:02,902
* Oh let us be

1148
00:55:02,936 --> 00:55:04,704
* Oh let us be

1149
00:55:04,738 --> 00:55:06,573
* Oh oh oh

1150
00:55:06,606 --> 00:55:09,943
* Oh let us die

1151
00:55:09,976 --> 00:55:11,711
* There's a party now

1152
00:55:11,745 --> 00:55:13,513
* In the part of town

1153
00:55:13,546 --> 00:55:15,415
* Where the kids don't leave

1154
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:16,783
* Oh oh oh

1155
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:18,551
* Oh let us be

1156
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:19,953
* Oh oh oh

1157
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:22,455
* Oh let us die

1158
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:23,056
- We got Gonzo.

1159
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:23,957
30 seconds to stage.

1160
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,858
* Give us all a nod

1161
00:55:24,891 --> 00:55:27,027
* That it's overrun

1162
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,596
* That's who we wanna be

1163
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:31,464
* Oh be

1164
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,533
* Oh be

1165
00:55:33,566 --> 00:55:35,402
* Oh

1166
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:53,520
(crowd cheering)

1167
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:56,756
- Alright Melnick!

1168
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,391
Alright Melnick!

1169
00:55:58,925 --> 00:56:01,394
Get his ass off the stage!

1170
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:04,631
Ladies and gentlemen,

1171
00:56:04,664 --> 00:56:06,833
the moment you've
all been waiting for.

1172
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:09,703
My man, the freedom
fighter from Parker Prep.

1173
00:56:09,736 --> 00:56:11,938
Give it up for Gonzo Gilman!

1174
00:56:13,006 --> 00:56:16,509
Gonzo!
(crowd cheering)

1175
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:24,951
- My people!

1176
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:27,554
My people!

1177
00:56:28,788 --> 00:56:30,724
- [Crowd] Gonzo! Gonzo!

1178
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:35,729
- What schools,

1179
00:56:36,963 --> 00:56:37,731
and police,

1180
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:41,668
and governments fail to realize

1181
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:46,539
is that we've got the power!

1182
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:49,442
(crowd cheering)

1183
00:56:54,047 --> 00:56:56,950
But you know what's
a damn shame,

1184
00:56:56,983 --> 00:56:59,519
is when we forget that too.

1185
00:57:01,988 --> 00:57:04,557
But you know what
I'm seeing right now?

1186
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:08,561
I'm seeing that we're
starting to realize.

1187
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:10,563
Do you see that?
(crowd cheering)

1188
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:11,865
Do you see that!

1189
00:57:12,966 --> 00:57:15,068
Do you see what we can do!

1190
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:24,711
- [Male] You gonna
print another issue?

1191
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:26,513
- What do you think?

1192
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:32,585
(rock music)

1193
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:38,858
- I'm from North.

1194
00:57:38,892 --> 00:57:39,859
He's from Central.

1195
00:57:39,893 --> 00:57:41,695
She's from GW.

1196
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:43,163
Look, we wanna go Gonzo
on our schools too.

1197
00:57:43,196 --> 00:57:46,866
We wanna really blow
some shit up there.

1198
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,001
- Right on.

1199
00:57:48,034 --> 00:57:49,035
But we can just send
you the lay-outs.

1200
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:51,938
All you have to do
is fill 'em out.

1201
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:53,873
- That would be awesome.

1202
00:57:53,907 --> 00:57:56,876
- Just tell the truth,
brothers and sisters.

1203
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,678
That's all I ask.

1204
00:57:58,712 --> 00:58:00,780
- Even if the truth hurts.

1205
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:07,787
What's up, Gilman?

1206
00:58:08,722 --> 00:58:09,622
- Riley?

1207
00:58:15,795 --> 00:58:18,665
- I came to
congratulate you, man.

1208
00:58:18,698 --> 00:58:19,265
You had an idea,

1209
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:21,801
you followed it through,

1210
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:22,936
and it worked.

1211
00:58:24,204 --> 00:58:26,573
That's pretty cool, man.

1212
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:28,441
- Thanks, man.

1213
00:58:28,475 --> 00:58:31,177
- You know, our humble little
paper is coming out on Monday.

1214
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:33,847
It's not the Gonzo but

1215
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,648
there's a really
interesting article in there

1216
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:37,951
I think you should check out.

1217
00:58:38,952 --> 00:58:39,819
- Okay.

1218
00:58:43,857 --> 00:58:44,758
- Evie.

1219
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:49,629
Evie Wallace!

1220
00:58:50,964 --> 00:58:53,833
(Gavin chuckling)

1221
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:55,101
You are glowing.

1222
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,105
I'm really happy for you.

1223
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:01,975
For both of you.

1224
00:59:03,977 --> 00:59:04,844
Monday.

1225
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:17,724
- We should get
outta here, right?

1226
00:59:17,757 --> 00:59:19,926
This party's totally dying down.

1227
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:20,627
- Yeah.

1228
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,961
- We can go back to my place.

1229
00:59:21,995 --> 00:59:23,763
My parents are gone.

1230
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:25,131
After after party.

1231
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:27,167
Just the staff.

1232
00:59:28,168 --> 00:59:29,769
- All right, yeah.

1233
00:59:29,803 --> 00:59:30,804
- [Rob] Okay.

1234
00:59:30,837 --> 00:59:32,072
- Rally the troops.

1235
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:34,941
(girls giggling)

1236
00:59:39,813 --> 00:59:43,016
- You know, I've been working
it and I've been working it.

1237
00:59:43,049 --> 00:59:44,818
I think tonight it's
finally going down.

1238
00:59:44,851 --> 00:59:46,686
- [Gonzo] What?

1239
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,621
- Every man's fantasy.

1240
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:55,228
You know what the French
call "eating for three?"

1241
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:56,229
- [Woman] Robbie.

1242
00:59:56,262 --> 00:59:57,163
- Robbie.

1243
00:59:58,732 --> 00:59:59,299
- Hello ladies.

1244
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:00,767
- Oh sweet Jesus, no.

1245
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,701
- Oh yes.

1246
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:02,969
Pretty nervous you know,

1247
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:06,039
'cause it's my first time but

1248
01:00:06,072 --> 01:00:07,741
I put my camera in
there, I set it up,

1249
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:08,742
so I'm just gonna
film myself doing it

1250
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:11,077
and then I can watch it
later and see how I did.

1251
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:12,312
Hey, I'll show it
to you if you want.

1252
01:00:12,345 --> 01:00:14,814
- Oh no, that's really okay.

1253
01:00:14,848 --> 01:00:15,749
- Okay.

1254
01:00:18,918 --> 01:00:19,452
Wish me luck, man.

1255
01:00:19,486 --> 01:00:20,787
- Praying for you.

1256
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:25,859
- [Rob] Let's hope
there's enough of me

1257
01:00:38,938 --> 01:00:41,775
* Woo

1258
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:44,778
* Yeah, yeah, yeah

1259
01:00:46,212 --> 01:00:47,747
- Oh hell yeah.

1260
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:55,321
* Well, whoa, whoa, whoa

1261
01:00:55,355 --> 01:00:59,292
* Yeah

1262
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:00,927
* Mm

1263
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,763
(man screaming)

1264
01:01:08,234 --> 01:01:10,170
- So, are you a virgin?

1265
01:01:11,137 --> 01:01:14,074
(fridge rattling)

1266
01:01:14,107 --> 01:01:15,809
- What?

1267
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:18,078
- Have you ever had sex?

1268
01:01:18,111 --> 01:01:22,782
- Whoa, we're just really
diving in there, aren't we?

1269
01:01:24,984 --> 01:01:26,986
Remember Elizabeth Frankel?

1270
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,188
She moved away last year.

1271
01:01:28,221 --> 01:01:30,390
She was in our grade.

1272
01:01:30,423 --> 01:01:34,194
We've been best friends
since elementary school.

1273
01:01:34,227 --> 01:01:37,330
We made this pact
to get it over with.

1274
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:40,066
- How was it?

1275
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,269
- Embarrassing,
if truth be told.

1276
01:01:43,303 --> 01:01:44,204
Yeah.

1277
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:48,041
Well there I was humping away,

1278
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,044
thought I was doing great.

1279
01:01:51,077 --> 01:01:55,081
Really thought I was
championing that sex.

1280
01:01:56,049 --> 01:02:00,253
I looked up at one point to
see how she was liking it.

1281
01:02:00,286 --> 01:02:02,355
She had this confused,

1282
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:05,158
sorrowful look on her face.

1283
01:02:05,191 --> 01:02:09,162
Turns out my dick was actually
caught in her comforter.

1284
01:02:09,195 --> 01:02:10,864
- Get out!

1285
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:11,831
- I won't.

1286
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:14,234
It was a really soft
and satiny comforter.

1287
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:16,269
You've gotta believe me.

1288
01:02:19,272 --> 01:02:22,976
Anyway, then we finally
got it in for real.

1289
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:27,414
You know that whole
awkward dance.

1290
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:31,151
Just really trying to
keep my flag flying.

1291
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:33,420
And finally she gets into it

1292
01:02:33,453 --> 01:02:36,823
and she starts
moving around and,

1293
01:02:38,024 --> 01:02:41,161
it was over in like 10 seconds?

1294
01:02:41,194 --> 01:02:42,328
Seven seconds?

1295
01:02:44,197 --> 01:02:45,098
Yup.

1296
01:02:46,299 --> 01:02:49,936
I was a real pleasure
machine that night.

1297
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,211
So what about you?

1298
01:03:00,246 --> 01:03:01,815
You ever do it?

1299
01:03:05,919 --> 01:03:08,054
Evie, c'mon, I told you mine.

1300
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:10,890
You gotta tell me yours.

1301
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:12,158
Laws of reciprocation.

1302
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:15,929
- Oh really, I didn't realize
there are laws involved here.

1303
01:03:15,962 --> 01:03:17,364
- Well now you know.

1304
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:23,169
- It's not a good story.

1305
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:27,007
I'm sorry I brought it up.

1306
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:27,874
I think you brought
it up because

1307
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:30,010
you really wanna tell me.

1308
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:36,016
Evie, my first time
was with a blanket.

1309
01:03:36,049 --> 01:03:37,217
- [Rob] Gonzo!

1310
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,919
Gonzo are you up there!

1311
01:03:39,953 --> 01:03:40,987
I need water!

1312
01:03:42,522 --> 01:03:44,257
We need water stat!

1313
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,162
- Let's get some air.

1314
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:58,238
Last year, I had to take this
science class with Riley.

1315
01:03:58,271 --> 01:04:02,475
And I had this mad crush
on him like all the girls.

1316
01:04:04,444 --> 01:04:07,981
And I was trying to flirt
with him and everything,

1317
01:04:08,014 --> 01:04:11,985
finally he invited me to
this really cool party

1318
01:04:15,021 --> 01:04:17,290
and I wore this little dress.

1319
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:20,393
And I got really drunk.

1320
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:23,096
It was stupid but,

1321
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:27,300
I was just really
nervous, ya know.

1322
01:04:29,436 --> 01:04:34,240
Anyway, I wind up losing
my virginity to the guy.

1323
01:04:34,274 --> 01:04:36,242
Which was okay.

1324
01:04:36,276 --> 01:04:38,912
It was sort of what I wanted.

1325
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:45,418
But it turned into
this total nightmare.

1326
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:50,323
I was so messed up that

1327
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:53,426
I didn't notice his jock buddies

1328
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,929
were there cheering us on.

1329
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:01,301
And after he was finished

1330
01:05:02,202 --> 01:05:05,238
this other guy tried
to get in on me.

1331
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:14,014
And I had to fight him off.

1332
01:05:15,281 --> 01:05:16,950
And I was crying.

1333
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:19,319
I was trying to
get my clothes on.

1334
01:05:19,352 --> 01:05:22,355
I was trying to get
out of the house.

1335
01:05:26,092 --> 01:05:27,293
It was horrible.

1336
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:36,970
And Gavin Riley acted like
the whole thing was a joke.

1337
01:05:40,073 --> 01:05:41,074
He didn't defend me or anything.

1338
01:05:41,107 --> 01:05:41,975
He,

1339
01:05:44,244 --> 01:05:45,178
he laughed.

1340
01:05:51,284 --> 01:05:53,319
He totally disputes it
at school the next day

1341
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:55,622
and all these
rumors started that

1342
01:05:55,655 --> 01:05:59,392
I did the whole wrestling
team or whatever.

1343
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:06,132
He ruined my life.

1344
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,270
- Son of a bitch.

1345
01:06:12,572 --> 01:06:15,508
- Ever since then not only

1346
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:18,111
have I not had a boyfriend,

1347
01:06:19,346 --> 01:06:21,548
I really don't have anybody.

1348
01:06:24,117 --> 01:06:25,118
Just sort of

1349
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,288
shut down,

1350
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:31,024
I guess.

1351
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:35,562
- Evie,

1352
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,131
Evie listen.

1353
01:06:41,134 --> 01:06:42,635
Not everybody in this world

1354
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:45,438
is an asshole like Gavin Riley.

1355
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:52,312
I'm not.

1356
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:57,317
- I know.

1357
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:27,313
Let's go slow, okay.

1358
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:28,548
- This is great.

1359
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:51,705
- [Diane] Eddie!

1360
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:52,639
Breakfast!

1361
01:07:57,243 --> 01:08:01,247
Hey Mr. Sandman, get up,
get up, get up, get up!

1362
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:08,621
* Ooh

1363
01:08:08,655 --> 01:08:10,523
* Ooh

1364
01:08:18,264 --> 01:08:19,766
- [Male] Hey, Gilman!

1365
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:21,501
(imitates chicken)

1366
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:23,703
- You need a life.

1367
01:08:23,737 --> 01:08:26,239
- Yo Gonzo, is it true?

1368
01:08:26,272 --> 01:08:27,307
- Did you really do it, Gonzo?

1369
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:28,241
- Do what?

1370
01:08:32,812 --> 01:08:36,249
(ominous rock music)

1371
01:08:41,821 --> 01:08:43,323
What the hell?

1372
01:08:43,356 --> 01:08:44,391
- Listen up, Gonzo

1373
01:08:44,424 --> 01:08:47,527
Riley has proposed the
following chain of events

1374
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,329
that Errol bankrolled
your paper,

1375
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:50,764
and you broke into
the school at night

1376
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:53,533
and planted the rats and
roaches in the kitchen.

1377
01:08:53,566 --> 01:08:56,670
The health inspectors came
and closed down the cafeteria

1378
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,673
necessitating the need
for at off-campus dining,

1379
01:08:59,706 --> 01:09:01,775
thus saving Errol's business.

1380
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:04,244
Riley claims that was your plan.

1381
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:05,545
- That is ridiculous!

1382
01:09:05,578 --> 01:09:06,780
- Yeah, well, the thing is,

1383
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:07,981
Riley has a pretty
good slam on us.

1384
01:09:08,014 --> 01:09:11,551
He's even got surveillance
photos in here and everything.

1385
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:13,787
- Yeah, but these are from
when we got the footage.

1386
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,555
We didn't plant anything.

1387
01:09:15,588 --> 01:09:16,489
- No.

1388
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:22,562
- He actually expects
people to believe this?

1389
01:09:22,595 --> 01:09:24,631
You better be suspending Riley!

1390
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:26,299
- Calm down, Mr. Gilman.

1391
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:27,434
- Calm down.

1392
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,369
I got in trouble for
telling the truth.

1393
01:09:29,402 --> 01:09:30,837
This is nothing but lies.

1394
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:34,407
Don't tell me he's gonna skate.

1395
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:36,443
- There's gonna be a
thorough investigation,

1396
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:39,546
believe me and I
don't answer to you.

1397
01:09:39,579 --> 01:09:41,348
- Well, I'm gonna do a
little thorough investigation

1398
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:42,782
of my own, if you don't mind.

1399
01:09:42,816 --> 01:09:43,817
- I do mind.

1400
01:09:45,785 --> 01:09:47,821
In fact, if you respond with
another issue of your paper,

1401
01:09:47,854 --> 01:09:50,690
I'll kick you out of school.

1402
01:09:50,724 --> 01:09:53,226
You and all your sidekicks.

1403
01:09:54,427 --> 01:09:56,629
Consider yourselves warned.

1404
01:10:02,736 --> 01:10:06,439
- This article is
bullshit and you know it.

1405
01:10:07,874 --> 01:10:09,409
- Prove it.

1406
01:10:09,442 --> 01:10:10,377
- Prove it?

1407
01:10:11,778 --> 01:10:13,680
I'm gonna destroy you.

1408
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:18,385
- You better watch
it, little guy.

1409
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:22,355
I've got the goods on everybody.

1410
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:25,558
Take it easy.

1411
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:35,935
- What was that about?

1412
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:37,470
- I don't know.

1413
01:10:38,905 --> 01:10:40,840
I don't wanna find out.

1414
01:10:41,808 --> 01:10:42,876
- I have a plan, guys.

1415
01:10:42,909 --> 01:10:43,743
I've been thinking
about it all day.

1416
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:45,812
We do what we have to do.

1417
01:10:45,845 --> 01:10:49,349
We have to interview
those health inspectors.

1418
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:51,351
Get the nurse's full records.

1419
01:10:51,384 --> 01:10:54,754
Do a background check
on Continental Meats.

1420
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:57,791
We gotta fight back.

1421
01:10:57,824 --> 01:11:00,527
Okay, so who wants to do what?

1422
01:11:02,796 --> 01:11:03,697
Anyone?

1423
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,802
- We've all been
talking a little bit.

1424
01:11:08,835 --> 01:11:09,936
- Behind my back?

1425
01:11:09,969 --> 01:11:11,571
- No man, c'mon.

1426
01:11:13,973 --> 01:11:17,544
We just don't think that
we should do another issue.

1427
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:18,511
- What?

1428
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:20,613
- We've already taken
this so much further

1429
01:11:20,647 --> 01:11:21,681
than we ever thought we could

1430
01:11:21,715 --> 01:11:23,717
and it's been awesome but--

1431
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,685
- We cannot get expelled.

1432
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:26,820
- Oh god.

1433
01:11:26,853 --> 01:11:29,622
Schneeman, nobody's
getting expelled.

1434
01:11:29,656 --> 01:11:30,557
First amendment, man.

1435
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,425
Roy's bluffing.

1436
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,394
- I'm sorry, I can't risk it.

1437
01:11:34,427 --> 01:11:37,430
I've worked my whole life
to get into Princeton.

1438
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:39,966
- My parents will
have a shit fit.

1439
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,402
- This might blow
your minds guys

1440
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:44,838
but some things are more
important than college.

1441
01:11:44,871 --> 01:11:46,740
- [Evie] Riley's
story is bullshit!

1442
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:47,841
- Yeah.

1443
01:11:47,874 --> 01:11:49,642
- You're over-reacting.

1444
01:11:49,676 --> 01:11:53,580
Okay, just put something
on the website, like,

1445
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:57,484
"Anyone can make allegations
without a shred of proof.

1446
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:59,486
"We stand by our story 100%."

1447
01:11:59,519 --> 01:12:00,420
You know?

1448
01:12:00,453 --> 01:12:01,488
Stand strong.

1449
01:12:05,759 --> 01:12:10,430
- You guys just aren't seeing
the bigger picture here.

1450
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:14,000
Gonzo Gilman isn't just
your friend anymore.

1451
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:14,834
Okay?

1452
01:12:14,868 --> 01:12:15,802
He's a public figure.

1453
01:12:15,835 --> 01:12:19,506
He's a public figure
that stands for truth,

1454
01:12:19,539 --> 01:12:21,841
and justice, and freedom.

1455
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,943
And that is why
if we don't prove

1456
01:12:23,977 --> 01:12:28,581
that everything in that
article is an outright lie,

1457
01:12:28,615 --> 01:12:31,651
and the man who
wrote them is a liar,

1458
01:12:32,552 --> 01:12:33,787
my name is dirt!

1459
01:12:34,954 --> 01:12:38,491
And everything we've
done together is dirt!

1460
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,763
We need one more issue, come on!

1461
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:52,505
One little hit and you all fold.

1462
01:12:54,074 --> 01:12:56,076
I mean, what's wrong
with all of you?

1463
01:12:56,109 --> 01:12:58,578
- Well, this talking
in the third person

1464
01:12:58,611 --> 01:13:01,448
business is kinda
creepy for one.

1465
01:13:03,817 --> 01:13:04,718
- Gonzo,

1466
01:13:07,787 --> 01:13:10,523
all you have to do is graduate

1467
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:13,693
and you get to go to
your dream school.

1468
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:17,097
Are you really gonna
let Riley ruin that?

1469
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,932
Then he really wins.

1470
01:13:19,966 --> 01:13:21,968
You need to let this go.

1471
01:13:23,636 --> 01:13:25,105
- Remember history.

1472
01:13:25,138 --> 01:13:27,774
If Napoleon had
stopped at Austerlitz,

1473
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,810
he never would've
had his Waterloo.

1474
01:13:30,844 --> 01:13:31,711
- Jesus!

1475
01:13:34,948 --> 01:13:37,517
You're just scared of Riley.

1476
01:13:38,551 --> 01:13:39,586
That's what this is.

1477
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:40,620
You know it.

1478
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:47,827
- So I got about
eight pounds of it.

1479
01:13:47,861 --> 01:13:48,695
- So we're gonna eat it

1480
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:50,864
for the next seven months.

1481
01:13:51,898 --> 01:13:52,932
What's wrong?

1482
01:13:52,966 --> 01:13:56,569
- Nobody cares about
the truth, dad!

1483
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:57,704
- What?

1484
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:59,539
- [Gonzo] Why didn't
you tell me that?

1485
01:13:59,572 --> 01:14:00,807
- [Arthur] Eddie!

1486
01:14:02,876 --> 01:14:03,977
(door knocking)

1487
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:05,845
Eddie, open the door.

1488
01:14:07,681 --> 01:14:09,983
(slow rock music)

1489
01:14:10,016 --> 01:14:12,919
(father mumbling)

1490
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:27,701
* Mirror mirror

1491
01:14:27,734 --> 01:14:29,869
* On the wall

1492
01:14:29,903 --> 01:14:34,174
* Who's the greatest
of them all *

1493
01:14:34,207 --> 01:14:36,609
* My name Mohammed

1494
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:38,778
* Bore Jesus too

1495
01:14:38,812 --> 01:14:42,115
* Who's Mathia be good for you

1496
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:44,617
* 'Cause I came

1497
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:45,685
* And I saw

1498
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:47,020
- [Worker] Would you like
to try the capon, sir?

1499
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:48,755
- Looks delicious.

1500
01:14:50,924 --> 01:14:53,893
- Now that's what
I call spread, Gav.

1501
01:14:53,927 --> 01:14:54,761
- [Worker] Fresh capon?

1502
01:14:54,794 --> 01:14:55,695
- Yeah.

1503
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:03,737
- Belgian endive?

1504
01:15:11,911 --> 01:15:14,681
- Okay folks, let's settle down.

1505
01:15:16,049 --> 01:15:18,018
We're gonna get started.

1506
01:15:18,051 --> 01:15:19,052
Let's quiet down, folks.

1507
01:15:19,085 --> 01:15:20,920
Let's sit down.

1508
01:15:20,954 --> 01:15:23,156
- What fresh hell is this?

1509
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:26,960
- Today is a very proud
day at Parker Prep.

1510
01:15:28,094 --> 01:15:31,664
Our own Gavin Riley has
won the Van Buren Prize.

1511
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:34,067
The most prestigious history
award in the country.

1512
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,037
(crowd applauding)

1513
01:15:37,971 --> 01:15:41,641
And it's for his paper
The History of Torture

1514
01:15:41,675 --> 01:15:45,011
Tactics and
Psychological Warfare.

1515
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:48,848
- Torture tactics and
psychological warfare?

1516
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:51,918
- Incredibly, Gavin is the third

1517
01:15:51,951 --> 01:15:54,788
member of the Riley
family to win this award.

1518
01:15:54,821 --> 01:15:57,190
And his brothers, Shawn and
Marcus, are with us today.

1519
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:58,725
Come on up, guys.

1520
01:15:58,758 --> 01:15:59,926
They're passing the torch.

1521
01:15:59,959 --> 01:16:01,194
Let me see if I got this right.

1522
01:16:01,227 --> 01:16:02,962
Shaun is at Dartmouth?

1523
01:16:02,996 --> 01:16:03,897
- Yup.

1524
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:05,131
- Yes, and Marcus is at Yale.

1525
01:16:05,165 --> 01:16:07,934
And Gavin, you wanna tell us
where you're going next year?

1526
01:16:07,967 --> 01:16:08,835
- Stanford.

1527
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:09,502
Early decision.

1528
01:16:09,536 --> 01:16:11,071
- Stanford, how 'bout that?

1529
01:16:11,104 --> 01:16:14,207
(audience applauding)

1530
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:18,211
Mr. and Mrs. Riley
should write a book.

1531
01:16:18,244 --> 01:16:22,015
Gavin Riley, why don't you
say a few words, please.

1532
01:16:22,048 --> 01:16:22,916
Congratulations.

1533
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:23,817
- Thank you.

1534
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,751
Thanks.

1535
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:31,891
I just want to say that

1536
01:16:34,027 --> 01:16:37,797
standing on this stage
with my two brothers,

1537
01:16:40,133 --> 01:16:43,136
it's the proudest
moment of my life.

1538
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:45,772
- Schneeman!

1539
01:16:47,007 --> 01:16:48,775
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on, man?

1540
01:16:48,808 --> 01:16:50,076
- What do you mean?

1541
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,178
- Psychological Warfare?

1542
01:16:52,212 --> 01:16:53,713
The history of torture tactics.

1543
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:54,781
Those are your twin passions.

1544
01:16:54,814 --> 01:16:58,151
You were gonna write your
Van Buren paper on that.

1545
01:16:58,184 --> 01:17:00,887
- Riley just had the same idea.

1546
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,859
- Schneeman, we have been
through too much together.

1547
01:17:05,892 --> 01:17:06,760
Okay, man.

1548
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:07,894
Level with me.

1549
01:17:09,062 --> 01:17:11,865
Did you make some
kind of deal with him?

1550
01:17:11,898 --> 01:17:14,334
- This is totally
off the record.

1551
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,903
You can't tell anyone, okay?

1552
01:17:16,936 --> 01:17:17,904
Promise.

1553
01:17:17,937 --> 01:17:19,139
- [Gonzo] Yeah.

1554
01:17:19,172 --> 01:17:20,373
- I gave him my
paper in exchange

1555
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:23,910
for protection from the bullies
for the entire school year.

1556
01:17:23,943 --> 01:17:24,811
- What?

1557
01:17:25,512 --> 01:17:27,180
You've gotta be kidding me!

1558
01:17:27,213 --> 01:17:28,181
- It's true.

1559
01:17:28,214 --> 01:17:30,917
And honestly, I'd do it
again in a heartbeat.

1560
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,153
And I'm living fear-free
for the first time,

1561
01:17:33,186 --> 01:17:34,954
floating on air!

1562
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:38,158
It's like a terrible
weight has been lifted.

1563
01:17:38,191 --> 01:17:40,060
- The onions on this guy!

1564
01:17:40,093 --> 01:17:41,127
I swear, sometimes
- Gonzo!

1565
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:42,962
- he thinks he's the master.
- Gonzo.

1566
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:44,798
- [Schneeman] Gonzo.

1567
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:48,134
You can't tell anyone.

1568
01:17:48,168 --> 01:17:49,869
Please.

1569
01:17:49,903 --> 01:17:50,804
Please.

1570
01:18:13,126 --> 01:18:13,927
- Remember when you found out

1571
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,396
that Santa Claus
didn't really exist?

1572
01:18:16,429 --> 01:18:18,832
That your father was
really the tooth fairy

1573
01:18:18,865 --> 01:18:20,967
or that Barry Bonds didn't get

1574
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:24,070
his muscles from eating spinach?

1575
01:18:24,104 --> 01:18:26,840
Well, my friends, today, sadly,

1576
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:30,977
another idol must fall.

1577
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:33,913
(school bell rings)

1578
01:18:33,947 --> 01:18:34,981
- [Rob] Holy shit.

1579
01:18:35,015 --> 01:18:37,917
Gonzo has completely
lost his mind.

1580
01:18:37,951 --> 01:18:40,387
- King, Gandhi or Parks
I sort of understand

1581
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:44,424
but Patrick Henry has no
historical relevance whatsoever.

1582
01:18:44,457 --> 01:18:48,194
- Schneeman, you
better look at this.

1583
01:18:48,228 --> 01:18:51,131
- [Gonzo] Scott Marshall
Schneeman had enough.

1584
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:53,933
Enough of the teasing,
of the beatings,

1585
01:18:53,967 --> 01:18:57,237
of the humiliations he had
to suffer his entire life.

1586
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:59,372
So, when Gavin Riley came

1587
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:01,941
to him with a
nefarious proposal,

1588
01:19:01,975 --> 01:19:05,245
that would make his troubles
magically disappear,

1589
01:19:05,278 --> 01:19:08,848
Schneeman was more
than ready to listen.

1590
01:19:11,184 --> 01:19:13,119
- This is bad.

1591
01:19:13,153 --> 01:19:14,054
So bad.

1592
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,425
- [Gonzo] A pretty
Parker Prep student,

1593
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:19,492
who shall remain nameless,

1594
01:19:19,526 --> 01:19:23,396
made the mistake of
falling for Riley's charms.

1595
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:25,398
Last year, he invited
her to a party

1596
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:29,369
and she accepted
expecting a night of fun,

1597
01:19:29,402 --> 01:19:31,871
possibly even romance.

1598
01:19:31,905 --> 01:19:35,342
But what she experienced
that night was a horror

1599
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:37,177
that changed her life forever.

1600
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:39,846
(rock music)

1601
01:19:46,486 --> 01:19:48,455
* Lovely fingertips on my lips

1602
01:19:48,488 --> 01:19:49,489
* I don't

1603
01:19:49,522 --> 01:19:50,590
- [Gonzo] All his
academic records

1604
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:53,893
should be called into
question including his SATs.

1605
01:19:53,927 --> 01:19:55,462
He should probably be
tested for steroids too

1606
01:19:55,495 --> 01:19:58,898
because he probably
cheats at wrestling.

1607
01:19:58,932 --> 01:20:02,035
Gavin Riley is a total fraud,

1608
01:20:02,068 --> 01:20:04,971
academically,
personally, morally.

1609
01:20:05,005 --> 01:20:09,075
He needs to be unmasked
in every conceivable way.

1610
01:20:14,047 --> 01:20:16,049
* Little hooks
stuck on my back *

1611
01:20:16,082 --> 01:20:21,087
* 10 little tears that
make their attack *

1612
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:26,159
* Your fat cherry lips

1613
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:31,531
- How could you do this to us?

1614
01:20:31,564 --> 01:20:34,401
- You turned out to
be worse than Riley.

1615
01:20:34,434 --> 01:20:36,536
- You did this alone?

1616
01:20:36,569 --> 01:20:38,938
* Your fat cherry lips

1617
01:20:38,972 --> 01:20:40,306
- In my office now.

1618
01:20:41,474 --> 01:20:43,943
You are suspended indefinitely

1619
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:45,979
pending an expulsion hearing.

1620
01:20:46,012 --> 01:20:48,114
* It's so fun to love someone

1621
01:20:48,148 --> 01:20:51,184
* Just try try to
get, get over it *

1622
01:20:51,217 --> 01:20:52,085
- [Gonzo] Schneeman,
I'm coming, man!

1623
01:20:52,118 --> 01:20:52,686
- No! No!

1624
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:53,353
No, get away from me!

1625
01:20:53,386 --> 01:20:54,120
Get away!

1626
01:20:54,154 --> 01:20:54,688
Get away from me!

1627
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:57,257
You broke your promise.

1628
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:59,125
I'd rather stay up here a
week than be helped by you.

1629
01:20:59,159 --> 01:20:59,926
Leave!

1630
01:20:59,959 --> 01:21:00,527
You're not my friend!

1631
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,327
Leave!

1632
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:02,328
Why are you still here?

1633
01:21:02,362 --> 01:21:03,229
Leave!

1634
01:21:03,263 --> 01:21:04,130
Leave!

1635
01:21:04,164 --> 01:21:05,031
Go!

1636
01:21:05,065 --> 01:21:08,401
Go!
* Cherry lips

1637
01:21:08,435 --> 01:21:09,369
- Good for you, Schneeman.

1638
01:21:09,402 --> 01:21:11,204
Good for you man.

1639
01:21:11,237 --> 01:21:13,173
- Evie, thank God.

1640
01:21:13,206 --> 01:21:15,508
I've been calling you all day.

1641
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:18,044
You're not gonna believe
the day I'm having.

1642
01:21:18,078 --> 01:21:19,245
- [Evie] Fuck off!

1643
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:20,180
- What?

1644
01:21:20,213 --> 01:21:21,314
What's wrong?

1645
01:21:21,348 --> 01:21:24,918
- [Evie] Look at the
website, asshole!

1646
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:35,295
- Did Riley post this?

1647
01:21:35,328 --> 01:21:36,529
- [Evie] I told you
to leave him alone

1648
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:38,398
but you wouldn't listen.

1649
01:21:38,431 --> 01:21:40,300
- Okay but, we can take this,

1650
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:41,001
we can take this out.

1651
01:21:41,034 --> 01:21:41,634
We can delete it from the site.

1652
01:21:41,668 --> 01:21:44,204
We're the administrators.

1653
01:21:44,237 --> 01:21:47,173
- [Evie] It's all over YouTube!

1654
01:21:47,207 --> 01:21:50,310
(people laughing)
(Evie crying)

1655
01:21:50,343 --> 01:21:51,478
- [Gonzo] Evie.

1656
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:53,313
Fuck!

1657
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:10,497
- One time!

1658
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:11,731
One time!

1659
01:22:11,765 --> 01:22:15,535
I cheated and you had
to bust me like that?

1660
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:18,071
They're gonna take
away my prize.

1661
01:22:18,104 --> 01:22:20,440
Stanford is gonna
review my transcript.

1662
01:22:20,473 --> 01:22:22,475
You fucked up everything!

1663
01:22:22,509 --> 01:22:23,643
- You shouldn't
have done it man.

1664
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:25,612
- You are nothing.

1665
01:22:25,645 --> 01:22:26,513
Nothing!

1666
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:30,116
Nobody cares what you do.

1667
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:32,018
My family...

1668
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,321
I have to win.

1669
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:43,496
You have no idea how much
fucking pressure I'm under!

1670
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:45,331
- How could you do that to Evie?

1671
01:22:45,365 --> 01:22:46,633
- You did it to her, Gilman!

1672
01:22:46,666 --> 01:22:49,469
(Gavin punches)

1673
01:22:51,171 --> 01:22:53,573
(door creaking)

1674
01:22:53,606 --> 01:22:56,109
- Hey, I just missed
you at the hospital.

1675
01:22:56,142 --> 01:22:57,243
My phone was off.

1676
01:22:57,277 --> 01:22:58,044
Is he alright?

1677
01:22:58,078 --> 01:22:59,245
- He's gonna be fine.

1678
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:03,083
He had to get a few stitches,
but he's gonna be alright.

1679
01:23:03,116 --> 01:23:04,084
- You okay?

1680
01:23:09,322 --> 01:23:11,157
You were right.

1681
01:23:11,191 --> 01:23:13,259
This is a total disaster.

1682
01:23:14,294 --> 01:23:17,397
I can't believe he
might not graduate.

1683
01:23:18,465 --> 01:23:21,167
I just get so caught up, babe.

1684
01:23:23,336 --> 01:23:26,639
I just want Eddie to
have an interesting life.

1685
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:29,042
And try for great things.

1686
01:23:31,578 --> 01:23:34,314
Everything shouldn't
be about pressure

1687
01:23:34,347 --> 01:23:36,383
and stress and tests.

1688
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:37,517
- I know.

1689
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:41,154
I know, I know, I
tend to forget that.

1690
01:23:41,187 --> 01:23:44,424
You're not the only one
who gets carried away.

1691
01:23:44,457 --> 01:23:45,358
- Jesus.

1692
01:23:46,593 --> 01:23:49,362
(door knocking)

1693
01:23:51,765 --> 01:23:52,665
Eddie?

1694
01:23:57,704 --> 01:23:58,605
Eddie.

1695
01:24:02,475 --> 01:24:03,343
Jesus.

1696
01:24:06,579 --> 01:24:07,514
Let me see.

1697
01:24:14,254 --> 01:24:16,489
Wanna tell me what happened?

1698
01:24:19,392 --> 01:24:21,227
- I messed up so bad.

1699
01:24:25,265 --> 01:24:27,500
I hurt everyone I care about.

1700
01:24:30,403 --> 01:24:33,106
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1701
01:24:35,642 --> 01:24:36,576
- Sometimes you
just have to look

1702
01:24:36,609 --> 01:24:40,513
the world in the eye
and say you're sorry.

1703
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:49,322
- You mean like throw myself

1704
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:53,626
at the mercy of the
courts type of deal?

1705
01:24:54,561 --> 01:24:57,130
- And pray they forgive you.

1706
01:24:58,231 --> 01:25:01,534
I've had a little
practice of that myself.

1707
01:25:02,535 --> 01:25:03,436
- Yeah.

1708
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,641
- You need anything?

1709
01:25:08,675 --> 01:25:09,676
- I'm fine.

1710
01:25:15,415 --> 01:25:16,316
- I'm deeply sorry that I did

1711
01:25:16,349 --> 01:25:18,818
not live up to what
was expected of me.

1712
01:25:18,852 --> 01:25:21,287
To every New Yorker
and to all those who

1713
01:25:21,321 --> 01:25:24,290
believed in what I
tried to stand for,

1714
01:25:24,324 --> 01:25:26,226
I sincerely apologize.

1715
01:25:26,826 --> 01:25:28,495
- Indeed, I did have
a relationship with

1716
01:25:28,528 --> 01:25:31,731
Ms. Lewinsky that
was not appropriate.

1717
01:25:31,765 --> 01:25:34,634
Now this matter is
between me, my wife,

1718
01:25:34,668 --> 01:25:37,337
and our daughter, and our God.

1719
01:25:38,738 --> 01:25:41,241
I must put it right.

1720
01:25:41,274 --> 01:25:45,512
And I am prepared to do
whatever it takes to do so.

1721
01:25:45,545 --> 01:25:48,581
- I have sinned
against you, my Lord.

1722
01:25:50,517 --> 01:25:53,720
And I would ask that
Your precious blood

1723
01:25:57,557 --> 01:25:59,459
would wash and cleanse

1724
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,729
every stain.

1725
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:07,467
* It's a shame

1726
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,675
- In the past week,

1727
01:26:15,709 --> 01:26:18,345
I ruined my chance
to go to college,

1728
01:26:18,378 --> 01:26:20,280
I lost all my friends.

1729
01:26:20,847 --> 01:26:21,948
The one girl I ever cared about

1730
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:25,318
will probably never
talk to me again.

1731
01:26:25,352 --> 01:26:27,620
I also got my face kicked in.

1732
01:26:29,456 --> 01:26:31,825
But after everything I've done,

1733
01:26:35,328 --> 01:26:37,330
I probably got off easy.

1734
01:26:39,799 --> 01:26:41,534
You believed in me,

1735
01:26:42,635 --> 01:26:44,537
and I betrayed you all.

1736
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:47,807
To the Gonzo staff,

1737
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:50,243
Rob, Ming Na.

1738
01:26:52,879 --> 01:26:56,616
I'm sorry I let my
stupid egotistical war

1739
01:26:56,649 --> 01:27:01,654
get in the way of the beautiful
thing we built together.

1740
01:27:02,355 --> 01:27:04,524
Scott Marshall Schneeman,

1741
01:27:04,557 --> 01:27:07,894
you told me something
in confidence, man,

1742
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:09,662
and I sold you out.

1743
01:27:11,831 --> 01:27:15,368
I hope you can forgive
me but if you can't,

1744
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:20,540
hey, I get it.

1745
01:27:25,578 --> 01:27:27,847
To the unnamed girl,

1746
01:27:27,881 --> 01:27:31,618
the last thing I wanted
to do was hurt you.

1747
01:27:33,687 --> 01:27:34,921
I've never felt this bad about

1748
01:27:34,954 --> 01:27:37,490
anything before in my life.

1749
01:27:39,559 --> 01:27:42,662
But that probably
doesn't help you much.

1750
01:27:42,696 --> 01:27:44,364
I'll do anything.

1751
01:27:44,964 --> 01:27:47,701
I'll accept any
form of punishment,

1752
01:27:47,734 --> 01:27:49,703
the crueler the better.

1753
01:27:50,804 --> 01:27:53,373
Just give me another chance.

1754
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:15,595
* Elevate us straight
into my skull *

1755
01:28:17,897 --> 01:28:19,933
* The escalator

1756
01:28:19,966 --> 01:28:25,338
* Rises as it falls

1757
01:28:26,006 --> 01:28:29,576
* I swear a jet is crashing

1758
01:28:29,609 --> 01:28:33,713
* In my mind

1759
01:28:33,747 --> 01:28:35,448
* You can hold on

1760
01:28:35,482 --> 01:28:40,487
* But I wouldn't
waste your time *

1761
01:28:41,921 --> 01:28:45,625
* Farewell my

1762
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:49,929
* Black balloon

1763
01:28:49,963 --> 01:28:53,600
* Farewell my

1764
01:28:53,633 --> 01:28:58,638
* Black balloon

1765
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:06,946
* I stood in the
thousand streets *

1766
01:29:08,048 --> 01:29:09,582
- Hey.

1767
01:29:09,616 --> 01:29:12,018
I heard they let you back in.

1768
01:29:12,052 --> 01:29:13,820
- Yeah, my mom sweet-talked

1769
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:17,524
Principal Roy at that
hearing pretty hard.

1770
01:29:18,925 --> 01:29:20,593
There's no more Gonzo.

1771
01:29:20,627 --> 01:29:22,495
That's for sure.

1772
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:24,030
- We wanna start
up again next year.

1773
01:29:24,064 --> 01:29:25,765
- If that's okay with you.

1774
01:29:25,799 --> 01:29:27,500
- Yeah, and we'll
do it all online.

1775
01:29:27,534 --> 01:29:29,636
There are no principals
in cyberspace.

1776
01:29:29,669 --> 01:29:31,037
- We feel it's our duty, Gonzo.

1777
01:29:31,071 --> 01:29:32,972
The voice of the
underdog must be heard.

1778
01:29:33,006 --> 01:29:35,041
Power to the people.

1779
01:29:35,075 --> 01:29:37,777
- Power to the people.

1780
01:29:37,811 --> 01:29:38,712
Yeah.

1781
01:29:41,014 --> 01:29:42,782
Riley been around?

1782
01:29:42,816 --> 01:29:44,050
- Hasn't shown his face.

1783
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:45,685
- What a pussy.

1784
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:46,753
(phone ringing)

1785
01:29:46,786 --> 01:29:50,590
- [Malloy] He should take
his lumps like a man.

1786
01:30:02,068 --> 01:30:05,005
(light rock music)

1787
01:30:15,648 --> 01:30:18,651
* Nobody knows where you go

1788
01:30:18,685 --> 01:30:19,219
- Evie!

1789
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:21,788
* After school

1790
01:30:21,821 --> 01:30:25,058
* All the cruel cruel things

1791
01:30:25,091 --> 01:30:30,463
* You do with friends

1792
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:33,633
* How will you keep

1793
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:49,616
- Thanks for seeing me.

1794
01:30:51,985 --> 01:30:52,652
I just--

1795
01:30:52,686 --> 01:30:55,822
- Don't tell me you're sorry.

1796
01:30:55,855 --> 01:30:57,624
I know you're sorry.

1797
01:30:58,825 --> 01:31:01,961
And don't think your little
video meant anything.

1798
01:31:01,995 --> 01:31:04,964
It was just another
Gonzo Gilman Production.

1799
01:31:04,998 --> 01:31:06,099
All about you.

1800
01:31:09,636 --> 01:31:11,871
- Then what am I doing here?

1801
01:31:14,674 --> 01:31:16,676
- Let's talk in the car.

1802
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:39,599
After I saw that clip of
me naked at the party,

1803
01:31:39,632 --> 01:31:42,702
I swore I'll never
talk to you again.

1804
01:31:44,938 --> 01:31:46,039
I turned off all my lights.

1805
01:31:46,072 --> 01:31:49,042
Put on some really
depressing music.

1806
01:31:49,075 --> 01:31:49,843
Got under my covers.

1807
01:31:49,876 --> 01:31:53,546
I was ready to say
screw the world.

1808
01:31:54,214 --> 01:31:55,949
Shut everybody out.

1809
01:31:58,718 --> 01:32:02,088
Somehow it didn't
feel right this time.

1810
01:32:02,122 --> 01:32:03,023
- What?

1811
01:32:04,724 --> 01:32:06,559
- Playing the victim.

1812
01:32:07,927 --> 01:32:10,130
It wasn't me anymore.

1813
01:32:10,163 --> 01:32:12,799
I know how to fight back now.

1814
01:32:14,834 --> 01:32:15,935
No matter what

1815
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:17,771
asshole,

1816
01:32:19,005 --> 01:32:19,906
asshole

1817
01:32:21,975 --> 01:32:23,109
thing you did,

1818
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:26,680
you gave me that.

1819
01:32:28,848 --> 01:32:30,583
You and your paper.

1820
01:32:32,852 --> 01:32:33,887
That was big.

1821
01:32:35,055 --> 01:32:38,258
- So what are you saying, Evie?

1822
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:40,960
I mean, are we friends again?

1823
01:32:40,994 --> 01:32:42,996
Can we be friends again?

1824
01:32:44,264 --> 01:32:45,965
- Can I trust you?

1825
01:32:49,002 --> 01:32:50,136
I mean really,

1826
01:32:53,006 --> 01:32:54,607
really trust you?

1827
01:32:58,812 --> 01:33:01,214
- My heart broke for you, Evie.

1828
01:33:03,817 --> 01:33:05,018
- I know it did.

1829
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,621
- I learned my lesson.

1830
01:33:22,302 --> 01:33:25,171
(Gonzo chuckling)

1831
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,641
- What's so funny?

1832
01:33:30,143 --> 01:33:32,645
- I'm just really relieved.

1833
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,749
This has been killing me.

1834
01:33:35,782 --> 01:33:38,852
- Don't get so
ahead of yourself.

1835
01:33:38,885 --> 01:33:41,187
You still need to be punished.

1836
01:33:43,189 --> 01:33:46,860
Let's just say you
better watch your back.

1837
01:33:47,961 --> 01:33:51,064
- Okay, I think I
can live with that.

1838
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:56,202
(light rock music)

1839
01:33:58,071 --> 01:34:00,040
- Do you want to get some food?

1840
01:34:00,073 --> 01:34:01,107
- Yeah.

1841
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:05,912
Yeah, we should probably
throw Errol some business.

1842
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:14,187
- So, what's the
deal with this car?

1843
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:18,058
- [Gonzo] That is a
whole other story.

1844
01:34:18,091 --> 01:34:21,861
* Just walk away and cry

1845
01:34:21,895 --> 01:34:25,965
* 'Cause so long

1846
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:28,335
* The holidays we spent

1847
01:34:28,368 --> 01:34:32,005
- [Gonzo] Did
Riley post or Evie?

1848
01:34:32,038 --> 01:34:33,940
- [Rob] No, but I did.

1849
01:34:35,909 --> 01:34:38,945
You have to scroll
down a little bit more.

1850
01:34:38,978 --> 01:34:40,013
- [Rob] Bingo, there we go.

1851
01:34:40,046 --> 01:34:41,348
- Oh no, Rob!

1852
01:34:41,381 --> 01:34:42,515
Not the sex tape

1853
01:34:42,549 --> 01:34:46,786
- Yup, I posted the tape of
me having sex with women.

1854
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:47,821
Press play.

1855
01:34:47,854 --> 01:34:49,055
- [Gonzo] I really
don't want to.

1856
01:34:49,089 --> 01:34:50,023
- Push play

1857
01:34:51,424 --> 01:34:54,361
and you will see
me communicating

1858
01:34:54,394 --> 01:34:55,261
with God,

1859
01:34:56,896 --> 01:34:57,931
with my body.

1860
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:02,268
- Okay.

1861
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:06,106
* Woo

1862
01:35:06,139 --> 01:35:09,275
* Well yeah yeah
- See this?

1863
01:35:09,309 --> 01:35:10,944
This is my truth.

1864
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:18,084
Isn't that what Gonzo was
supposed to be all about?

1865
01:35:18,118 --> 01:35:19,019
- Okay, don't touch me, dude.

1866
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:20,120
- That's fine.

1867
01:35:20,153 --> 01:35:24,024
Watch the rest of it 'cause
the end is really good.

1868
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:26,326
(rock music)

1869
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:43,009
* Well I light the fire

1870
01:35:43,043 --> 01:35:45,378
* And tear it apart

1871
01:35:45,412 --> 01:35:48,982
* 'Cause we hate
hate the world *

1872
01:35:49,015 --> 01:35:52,385
* And we don't wanna stop

1873
01:35:52,419 --> 01:35:55,955
* We've got time to refuse

1874
01:35:55,989 --> 01:36:00,894
* And there's more more to us

1875
01:36:00,927 --> 01:36:01,928
* Oh

1876
01:36:01,961 --> 01:36:05,165
* Oh let us be

1877
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:08,902
* Oh let us die

1878
01:36:08,935 --> 01:36:10,904
* There's a party now

1879
01:36:10,937 --> 01:36:12,172
* In the part of town

1880
01:36:12,205 --> 01:36:15,909
* Where the kids all meet

1881
01:36:29,389 --> 01:36:32,392
* Change change it all

1882
01:36:32,425 --> 01:36:35,395
* 'Cause I'm getting bored

1883
01:36:35,428 --> 01:36:36,296
* And let's

1884
01:36:36,329 --> 01:36:39,366
* Burn down the wall

1885
01:36:39,399 --> 01:36:42,202
* We need me some more

1886
01:36:42,235 --> 01:36:45,338
* And we'll lose
lose our heads *

1887
01:36:45,372 --> 01:36:49,009
* And we'll lose track of time

1888
01:36:49,042 --> 01:36:52,312
* 'Cause we, we
need some thrills *

1889
01:36:52,345 --> 01:36:55,949
* And they're so hard to find

1890
01:36:55,982 --> 01:36:57,450
* Go find

1891
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:58,218
* Go

1892
01:36:58,251 --> 01:37:00,353
* Oh let us be

1893
01:37:00,387 --> 01:37:01,955
* Oh oh oh

1894
01:37:01,988 --> 01:37:03,356
* Oh let us die

1895
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:05,225
* Oh oh oh

1896
01:37:05,258 --> 01:37:07,127
* There's a party now

1897
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,495
* In the part of town

1898
01:37:08,528 --> 01:37:10,363
* Where the kids all meet

1899
01:37:10,397 --> 01:37:12,098
* Oh oh oh

1900
01:37:12,132 --> 01:37:13,500
* Oh let us be

1901
01:37:13,533 --> 01:37:15,368
* Oh oh oh

1902
01:37:15,402 --> 01:37:17,237
* Oh let us die

1903
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:19,039
* Oh oh oh

1904
01:37:19,072 --> 01:37:20,507
* Give us all a nod

1905
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,375
* That it's on the run

1906
01:37:22,409 --> 01:37:24,177
* That's who we wanna be

1907
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:25,445
* Oh oh oh

1908
01:37:25,478 --> 01:37:28,415

1909
01:37:48,435 --> 01:37:51,404
* Oh let us be
