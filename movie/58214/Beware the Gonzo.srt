1
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,029
In the past week

2
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,893
I ruined my chance to go to college

3
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:27,880
I lost all my friends

4
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,577
I almost ruined my parents' marriage

5
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:35,356
The one girl l ever cared about will
probably never talk to me again

6
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:38,713
I also got my face kicked in

7
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,428
But...

8
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,062
after everything I've done

9
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:47,920
I probably got off easy

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,780
You believed in me

11
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:55,238
and I betrayed you all

12
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:07,790
Amy

13
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:11,655
I want you on band try-outs and theater auditions

14
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,362
It's Pippin this year, right?

15
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,161
Great show... Jules

16
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,649
I need you on the student parking permits
Please, they confuse the hell out of everybody

17
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,936
Can you do that for me?

18
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:29,543
There's a new cafeteria policy.

19
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:31,872
Due to last year's brawl at McDonald's

20
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:35,852
Nobody's allowed off school grounds for lunch
Not even the seniors.

21
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:37,239
We're stuck inside all year

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,289
That sucks

23
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,791
It's okay. I'm gonna do an op ed on that

24
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:44,589
Gonna interview the principal
it's obviously a hot-button issue

25
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:47,479
Kev, what do you got, bud?

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,875
Football and wrestling previews, Gav. And

27
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:54,236
I'd love to do a feature on the state wrestling champ
at a hundred sixty eight pounds

28
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,704
who happens to be you

29
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:59,386
Alright. Well you'll probably
gonna want photos with that

30
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:02,447
so meet me in the gym after school
I'll let you shoot me in my tux

31
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,614
I got a sports story

32
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:09,938
but it ain't no goddamn puff piece

33
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,624
It's gonna be in 2-inch type

34
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,326
right underneath the masthead

35
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:21,415
steroids

36
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,395
good to see you, Gilman

37
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:24,253
Steroids, huh?

38
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:28,455
I'm gonna go undercover on the
football team as assistant equipment manager

39
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:30,452
blow the lid right off this bitch

40
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:33,567
I'm gonna find out who's juicing,
where they got the stuff

41
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:35,753
What evidence do you have that anyone's using steroids?

42
00:02:35,838 --> 00:02:37,104
Statistics

43
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:39,536
It's an epidemic now on the high school level

44
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:42,765
the high school football team went 2 and 12 last year

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,950
nobody cares enough to cheat

46
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:49,594
maybe they don't wanna go 2 and 12 this year

47
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:51,299
ever think about that?

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,334
It's a ridiculous reach. Forget it.

49
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:54,533
At least read the data

50
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,873
I don't need to read the data. Thanks.

51
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:00,683
Who are you trying to protect?

52
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:03,533
Cough if up, Riley.

53
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:05,580
How far up does this thing go?

54
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:09,488
Take it easy, Oliver Stone. I just don't want you
bugging my friends with your bullshit

55
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,240
Okay, guys. These stories are due Friday.
You can just e-mail them to me, alright?

56
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:19,796
Okay, we table the steroids thing.

57
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,201
What am I gonna do?

58
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,120
You beat me out for editor, Riley,
but I still need to make my mark this year

59
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,183
First of all, Gilman, take a giant step back

60
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,714
You're in my area. We discussed this

61
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:34,107
Okay

62
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,523
Why don't you just do a
simple 'back to school' piece?

63
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:45,268
'Another year dawns on Parker Prep'
whatever just

64
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,832
make sure you include the
changes on the academic calendar

65
00:03:49,406 --> 00:03:50,804
Back to school piece

66
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,411
it's simple, it's elegant

67
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,680
I'll really to put my finger on
the pulse of the student body

68
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:03,900
Yes. Fine. Look, if it's good enough,
I'll even put it on the cover

69
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:07,260
Just don't get carried away

70
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,400
Gonzo Gilman with the Courier.
Another year dawns, let's talk about it

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,760
Gonzo Gilman with the Courier.
Do you have one minute?

72
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:27,480
Gonzo Gilman with the Courier.
What are your hopes and fears...

73
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:30,060
Gonzo Gilman with the Courier.

74
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,641
What are your hopes and fears for the new year?

75
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:42,118
I hope that you get out of my face
and I fear that you will not.

76
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:45,960
- Gonzo Gilman with the Courier. I was hoping
- No

77
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,353
- Can I quote you on that?
-No

78
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:04,186
Got her digits, man. Damn, she's hot.

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,800
My friend, Rob. You will have to
undress that girl with a small crane

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,720
You've no vision, Gonzo. Okay that girl loses
this much baby fat, she'll have the sweetest ass in the entire school

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,880
- And I will be leading the ground floor
- Hmm..interesting.

82
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,280
- You working on a story?
- Undercover. I told you.

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,920
- 2-inch type
- right underneath the mast head.

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,720
- Hi, Rob.
- Hey, gorgeous. Welcome back.

85
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:40,122
- This is gonna be such a good year.
- Dude, she's like the elephant man

86
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:45,191
- You're the Don Juan of the physically-deformed
- Don't hate, okay?

87
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:49,450
-Please, you're better than that.
-Guys, come quick. It's Schneeman.

88
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:54,755
Bastards! How can you all just stand there?

89
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:56,580
Schneeman, I'm coming!

90
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:09,611
-Third year in a row. My underwear is about to rip...
-I know, I know. Don't try to talk right now

91
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,860
I'm gonna have to lift you... gently

92
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:22,720
Got it. Come on down. Here we go.

93
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:28,651
here...we... go.

94
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,581
You okay, Schneeman?

95
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,929
Did they do this to you?

96
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,876
Gavin Riley wasn't there

97
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,440
- Listen Schneeman. This isn't gonna happen again
-I know.

98
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,880
- That is the last time I wear underwear to school
- No, that's not what I mean

99
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,280
Okay you geniuses, here's your reminder

100
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,960
The submission deadline for the
Van Buren price is October 20th

101
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,680
This is the most prestigious history
award in the country

102
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,640
Parker Prep has had two previous winners

103
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,279
Gavin's two older brothers -Marcus and Shawn.

104
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,240
- Are you gonna continue the family dynasty?
- They'll disown me if I don't.

105
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:19,760
Well you're gonna have some tough competition
this year. Isn't that right, Mr. Shneeman?

106
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,336
Okay, back to Napoleon...

107
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:30,721
another man who had his eyes on the price
namely, the military domination of Europe...

108
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,377
Another year dawns on Parker Prep,
the 150th in the school history

109
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,565
For most students, it's a time to set goals
both academic and personal

110
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:44,000
a time to dream when everything seems possible

111
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:50,670
For others, however, school is already a
waking nightmare, a hellish abyss

112
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,023
where bullies prey sadistically on the weak.

113
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,915
unpunished, their victims, too afraid to identify.

114
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,060
- Hey
- Hey, how was the meeting? Did you settle?

115
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,820
And a hearty good evening to you, Diane.
No, we did not settle

116
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,500
- In fact, they threw the whole thing out.
- What?

117
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,460
Okay, so what happens now?
You don't get paid?

118
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,420
- You've been working on this case for 6 months.
- That's the high stake world of personal injury law.

119
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,044
Arthur, c'mon. This has got to stop.
You need to start getting compensated for your time.

120
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:58,899
and I'm talking about actual money

121
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,071
I'm not talking about Fernando working
off your fee by doing the hedges

122
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:06,213
or king Popi giving you that car
truck thingie with the boat attachment

123
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:09,148
That's an 87 El Camino, babe. It's a chariot

124
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,050
Look, I know how hard it is for you to say no
but you're not working pro-bono at LegalAid anymore

125
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:19,172
-This job is supposed to pay
- Di, I'm taking every case I can possibly take

126
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:22,308
I'm taking criminal, divorce, liability

127
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:24,919
I'm practically chasing ambulances down the street.
What else do you want me to do?

128
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,313
No money, no work. It's very simple

129
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,439
- Where's the boy?
- He's in his room. Eddie, dinner!

130
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:39,143
I call for a boycott on all boys'
varsity sports events

131
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:42,599
until the culprits step forward
and take responsibility for their actions

132
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:45,643
we can no longer let this aggression stand

133
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,300
-What? I'm working.

134
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:51,095
-Dinner's ready.
-I'll eat later. I'm on a roll

135
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,166
Hey mom?

136
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,707
Can you just grab me a Red Bull?

137
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:25,260
Rob, do me a favor and read it aloud

138
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,460
"Another year dawns on Parker Prep
The 150th in the school history"

139
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,700
"For most students, it's a time to set
goals both academic and personal"

140
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,420
"a time to dream when everything seems possible."

141
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:50,536
- Keep going.
- That is the end of the article.

142
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:54,952
-No, it's not. It's continued on another page or something.
-I don't think so. There's a period there.

143
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,700
What's the matter, Gilman?
It's on the cover, isn't it?

144
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:08,799
- You cut the whole thing?

145
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:13,609
You had no right to do that!
- I told you what I wanted and that's what I printed.

146
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:19,853
You're just protecting your neanderthal friends.
It's the same reason you tabled my steroids story.

147
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,941
- That's not what a newspaper is for!
- You're in my area, Gilman. I'm warning you.

148
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:29,412
A newspaper is for everybody.
It's a public trust!

149
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,300
- I told the truth in that article.
- Back off, freak! I'm serious.

150
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,500
You think this is just gonna go away?
That this is just gonna be over?

151
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,940
We're still gonna get justice for
Schneeman, Riley. You can't stop us!

152
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,820
No justice, no peace!

153
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,097
No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!

154
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:01,933
It's gonna be a nightmare, Riley.

155
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,820
You think you can challenge me, huh?

156
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,324
You're out of your league. Nobody
cares what you think. You understand that?

157
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,105
You better watch your back.

158
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,520
Are you out of your mind?
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia for Journalism.

159
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,280
How is getting kicked off the
paper one week into school gonna help?

160
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,720
You know there are students with 4.0 averages,
who spend their summers workign with lepers in India

161
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,440
who have a hard time getting into college
What the hell are you gonna do?

162
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:45,542
-This was your one extra-curricular selling point.
-Mom, one notch, okay? Do me a favor?

163
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:48,334
- Oh, am I being shrill
-Yes

164
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:54,265
I'm sorry. It's just that we're killing ourselves
to put you into this fancy private school
you have to hold up your end

165
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,467
I'm a victim of injustice, mother.
What do you want me to do?

166
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,540
Why don't you apologize?
Get back on the paper.

167
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,040
- Apologize?
- Yeah

168
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,315
I will never apologize to Gavin Riley.
I'll say that right now.

169
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:12,880
I'd rather die on my feet
than live on my knees.

170
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:17,629
"Die on my feet, live on my knees."
That's pretty good. Did I just make that up?

171
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,021
- Zapata. Emiliano Zapata. Mexican revolutionary.

172
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:23,189
Is that all you have to say?

173
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,191
Have you even read this, Diane?
He's standing up for the underdog.

174
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:29,092
Can't believe they'd cut a word of this

175
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:34,157
-I hope you're sending this to the dean at Columbia.
-Oh yeah, I send everything I write to Dean Herbert

176
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:38,286
No response yet but I know he'll respect my stand

177
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,449
Thanks, Arthur. That's very helpful

178
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,958
- I love you very much.
-[phone rings] Hello. This is she.

179
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,070
Yeah, I'm showing it a week from Tuesday.

180
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,240
Your mother's right.
We have sacrificed a lot.

181
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,560
Small things like dignity and
a sense of shame but

182
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,720
for me this isn't about getting into college.
It's about how far you're willing to go.

183
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,920
There's always gonna be some
asshole standing in your way

184
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,142
If there's something you need to do,
you have to find a way to do it.

185
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:17,989
-Alright?
-Yeah.

186
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,624
Don't you have any pride...
as a professional?

187
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,327
I don't cook this crap. I just serve it.

188
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,600
Great. What do you recommend? The stew?

189
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:43,381
Mac n' cheese?
Not the mac 'n cheese either

190
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,823
what about this vienna sausage that
looks pretty tasty. Is there anything...?

191
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:52,831
Well, man. I can't really eat saltines all year.

192
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,276
Just give me one of those sandwiches.

193
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,480
Russian roulette, bro.

194
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,507
Oh man, sloppy joe. Excellent.
Let me get some of that. Mmm

195
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:09,160
So what are you gonna do about Riley?

196
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,008
Sit down

197
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,440
It's not just that they cut my article,
or the heinous way they defiled Schneeman

198
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,520
We've been going to this school for three years
and it's like we've never even existed

199
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,160
This year was supposed to be different, remember?

200
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,080
Two weeks in they've got their feet
on our necks already? No way!

201
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,760
We're gonna start a fucking revolution in this place.

202
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:46,553
- How are we going to do that?
- With a newspaper.

203
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,323
With our own underground newspaper

204
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,714
Screw Gavin Riley!

205
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:56,243
Gavin Riley owns this place.

206
00:15:56,244 --> 00:15:58,578
He'll crush us like bugs.

207
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:01,029
He's just a man, Schneeman.

208
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:08,280
He's got strengths and weaknesses
like anyone else.

209
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:18,021
Too many narcs in here. Let's meet
at the usual place, okay? After school.

210
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,030
There are only 10 people in this school
that anybody knows or cares about.

211
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,296
I'm gonna write about everyone else

212
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:43,024
"The unsung heroes of Parker Prep"

213
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:49,655
That's my idea.
Alright. Anybody else?

214
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:52,607
Any ideas? Anybody?

215
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,560
Rob, why don't you do
something on that mutant harem of yours?

216
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,640
-That'll be a real killer.
-Yeah, yeah. Okay. Cool.

217
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,360
Great. Rob. Mutant harem...

218
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:15,960
Ming. C'mon. What do you got?

219
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:21,996
Well...

220
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:26,146
Nobody even thinks I can speak English

221
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:30,975
so they blab their whole lives in front
of me like I'm not even there

222
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:34,523
Some of these girls you wouldn't believe

223
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,676
They act like they're so perfect

224
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:40,121
But I see every single flaw

225
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:44,296
Ridiculous clothes and hideous hair

226
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,421
And they're just awful terrible people

227
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,695
Spoiled two-faced back-stabbers.
Those godless whores

228
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:56,930
It's all I can do not to vomit
or scream at their faces

229
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,876
I just wanna like rip out their hair

230
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:08,924
Sometimes I take pictures of them
with my camera phone

231
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:11,666
It's my dream of showing the world the truth

232
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,163
Wouldn't it be funny to see them cry tears

233
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:22,882
boohoohoo...
boohoohoohoo

234
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,880
So like a gossip column?
Are you talking about doing a gossip column?

235
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:38,752
Okay cool. Ming Na, gossip column.

236
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,880
Mr. Schneeman?
Mr. Scott Marshall Schneeman.

237
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,320
I'm gonna need your full story, man.
On the record. Names and everything.

238
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,280
Is this the McCarthy hearings?
- Schneeman, you gotta fight back now.

239
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:01,281
I mean for real!

240
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,099
They've already hung you by your underwear.
What else can they possibly do?

241
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,822
That's what I'm worried about.

242
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,920
Is anybody gonna order food?

243
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:16,785
Absolutely, Errol.
One slice of your famous cherry pie

244
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,609
and uh...four forks.

245
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,192
Evie Wallace.

246
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,579
What the hell does she want?

247
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,095
- Easy E. I heard she's been working at this joint
- Oh, she's a waitress?

248
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,562
No. She's a hooker, man.

249
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:43,441
-She has sex with guys in exchange for money.
-I know what a hooker is, Rob, but

250
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:47,139
No, I do not believe that.
-No, that's like a 100% confirmed.

251
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,162
She sold her cherries to some Japanese businessman
over the internet for $50,000

252
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:54,760
which is like 520,000 Yen

253
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:58,344
She doesn't dress like a hooker.
Her clothes are flawless.

254
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:02,286
also for her first time she blew the entire wrestling
team last year. 100% confirmed, multiple sources

255
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:11,170
Gavin Riley is an evil son of a bitch and anything
that will knock him down a peg or annoy
him a little bit, I'd like to be a part of.

256
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:12,943
Have a seat.

257
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,924
- I'm Gonzo Gilman, I'm in charge here.

258
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:27,385
I assume you all know who I am?

259
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,000
Well I don't really know how you found out about us
but now that you're here, let me get you up to speed

260
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,320
We're starting a newspaper here and
we plan on pissing a lot of people off

261
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,120
-No you're not gonna make a newspaper.
-Why not?

262
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,160
Newspapers are dead, okay?
You've gotta do a website or it's a total joke

263
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:52,440
No, we're not hiding behind usernames in cyberspace

264
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,400
this is gonna be a communal experience,
something tangible

265
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,280
an actual thing that you can hold in your hands
and get the ink on your fingers.

266
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,720
Newspapers are dead.
You know no one really asked you anyway

267
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,440
You just walked in here
you can go home and blog yourself

268
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:12,699
Dude, what are you doing?
you know she could give us a lot of street cred

269
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,351
Okay, let me ask you something.
How do you plan on paying for it?

270
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:19,659
Newspapers cost a lot of money to print, y'know.

271
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,243
Advertising.

272
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,979
We hit every mom and pop shop in this town
getting crushed by these soulless chains

273
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,167
introduce them to a whole new consumer.

274
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,625
I'll take out an ad. Couldn't hurt.

275
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,000
It's 50 for a full page.

276
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,282
-How about 40.
-Done.

277
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,880
See? Don't worry about the money. Covered.

278
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:44,215
Even the New York Times
has a website component.

279
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:49,240
Talk-backs, videos, blogs...

280
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,884
I mean you wanna interact
with your readers, right?

281
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:56,838
You want a reaction, don't you?

282
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:03,805
- I don't know anything about web design.
- I do. I can format your whole newspaper

283
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:10,023
See, I have very specific ideas about the formatting.
We'd have to work...very closely...together.

284
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,120
Are you gonna go all the way with this?

285
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:17,345
Or are you gonna punk out?

286
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:21,617
What do you think?

287
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,728
Uhm

288
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:29,044
I think we're all gonna go home...
together...in this direction

289
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:33,117
You guys can stay here. We'll see you later

290
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:41,995
I have this pretty classic picture of Schneeman
we should probably use for the cover

291
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:49,080
- Yeah, cool. Let me give you my email.
- Yeah, absolutely.

292
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:58,109
The bubonic plague!
You better double bag Gilman or your dick's gonna fall off.

293
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,920
You have no dick, asshole. Piss off!

294
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,000
- I hope you don't believe everything you hear
- No.

295
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,320
You know if they're lying,
you should write something too

296
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,160
-Set the record straight.
-Yeah, maybe I will.

297
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,461
- What happened between you and Gavin Riley?

298
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,075
- That's nobody's business

299
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,880
- You're a motherfucker on that triangle, man.
- Thanks

300
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,640
- What's your name?
- Dave Melnick.

301
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,973
Dave, tell me. How'd you like to be a star?

302
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:07,969
I'd like to be a star.

303
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,556
Most people only see a block of stone

304
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:39,486
the artist sees the statue trapped inside

305
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,822
Kev, Julie's my best friend.

306
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:47,520
but you're so freakin hot.

307
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:48,957
I know.

308
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:03,225
You skanky little ho

309
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,120
"You can chain me, you can torture me,
you can destroy my body"

310
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,000
"but you will never imprison my mind."
Mohandas Gandhi.

311
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,200
Check it out. I finally landed us two ads.

312
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,456
RJ's records on Main St and
that kid Django

313
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:32,207
who sells weed on the playground.

314
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:37,777
-I'll scan them in.
-Yeah, good.

315
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:44,292
What are you up to, Gilman?

316
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,851
If this school's an ass,

317
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:48,939
That's my foot.

318
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:57,729
Triple tens

319
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:09,001
Pathetic.

320
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,969
-Evie.
-Did you get it?

321
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:25,081
The double-thumb Gonzo Fist. Hunter S. Thompson.
It really grabs the eye by the balls of the throat.

322
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,461
That doesn't make any sense
but think I know what you mean.

323
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,132
I'm gonna stay up tonight and see
if I can finish the whole lay-out.

324
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:50,000
Gonzo files no. 1

325
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,440
Oh my God, Evie

326
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,006
This looks so professional.

327
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:04,515
I love it.

328
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,320
Wait till you see the website.

329
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,960
I kinda hope Schneeman doesn't
get murdered for this.

330
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,600
I know. Berserk.

331
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,465
This one's mine.

332
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:23,626
You might think it's stupid so

333
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:24,614
Evie

334
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:29,401
I have like 40+ moronic ideas every second

335
00:27:29,402 --> 00:27:31,640
and I tend to express them all

336
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:39,400
A sex advise column?

337
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:44,466
This is cruel.

338
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:48,072
If they want a whore, I'll give them a whore.

339
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:58,199
Bastards.

340
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:01,055
Let them see how it feels.

341
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:08,107
Ever feel lost, lonely, weird, really ugly?

342
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,869
last to get the joke?

343
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:16,107
Ever wonder where the party is?
Ever get a dodge ball on your face?

344
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,461
Pop a boner in your sweat pants?

345
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,974
Ever feel embarrassed about being smart?

346
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,800
Ever feel just like staying in bed all day,
all week, all year?

347
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,345
You ever feel misunderstood, cheated, alone?

348
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:34,399
Ever wonder why nothing ever feels easy ever?

349
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,884
Well, this paper's for you

350
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,860
Welcome to the Gonzo Files

351
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,320
Hey that's me.

352
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,560
Look she's making herself puke.

353
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,624
-Thanks for the unrealistic body image, bitch.
-What?

354
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:12,179
-I'm not bulimic, you asshole. I was puking
my guts out from the cafeteria food.
-Right, right.

355
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,856
-The Hendrix of the triangle?
-Yeah.

356
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,660
Oh my God. That's brutal.

357
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:48,040
-Damn, they put him in a whole locker.
-Who are these creeps?

358
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:57,660
You whore!

359
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:15,650
"I've had the misfortune of being bullied
by Johnny Rock since he came to Parker in 9th grade."

360
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:20,130
"Over the years he has worked long and
hard to perfect his patented wedgie technique."

361
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,570
"that combines elements of public humiliation
and excruciating physical pain"

362
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,490
"into a veritable bouillabaisse of terror."

363
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,930
"Take it from me, in the world of raging assholes ..."

364
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,730
Johnny Rock stands alone.

365
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:41,450
Congratulations, Johnny. You earned it.

366
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,500
Now if you'll excuse us, we're late for gym.

367
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:50,450
Physical education. It's important

368
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:55,570
Why aren't you dead right now?

369
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:06,690
Everyone knows Marlene Katsmeyer's
curvy just not like this.

370
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,957
-Haters, eat your hearts out.
-Damn, Elephant girl really is smokin'.

371
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,124
Horny Rob!

372
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:18,515
You go, boy!

373
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,596
Wait, listen to this.

374
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:35,911
"Dear Easy E, I have a very small penis."

375
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:41,903
"In fact, I'm one of the few guys
who can actually pee on his own balls."

376
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:47,076
"Do you know of any procedures or
exercise that can improve my length and girth?"

377
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:51,756
"Please help. I'm scared I'll never
be able to please a woman."

378
00:31:53,498 --> 00:31:59,312
"Sincerely, Ryan McCloud.
That preppy guy who always wears rugby shirts."

379
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,370
This letter is bullshit!

380
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:22,850
I am long and strong!

381
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:27,410
No. I've seen your sad, SAD excuse for a penis.

382
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,450
Last year when I gave you a
hummer in the boys' bathroom?

383
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:37,290
Don't you remember?
I mean, that's what you told everybody.

384
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:42,410
What are you...you saying it's not true?

385
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,450
You're a nasty little liar, aren't you, Ryan?

386
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,610
Say it.

387
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,770
Say "I'm a nasty little liar
and I deserve to be spanked."

388
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,570
Say it.

389
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,450
Say it. Say it.

390
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,926
Say it.

391
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,138
You can go to hell!

392
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,650
I want this written in English.

393
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:31,530
Attention. Attention students, will Edward Gilman
please report to the principal's office.

394
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,281
Mr. Gilman.

395
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,406
You caused quite a commotion today.

396
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:59,324
But that's now always such a bad thing, yes?

397
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,961
We think it's cute what you did.

398
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:05,163
Cute?

399
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,210
You certainly hit a nerve.
Have a seat.

400
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:17,610
Now there's a lot about your
paper that is inappropriate.

401
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,800
and in very poor taste and
I seriously considered disciplining you

402
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:33,048
but your essential message-saluting the unsung
heroes of parker prep has real value

403
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:38,763
Gonzo

404
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:43,748
as long as you agree to tone it down...a lot

405
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:46,751
and to work under Gavin's supervision

406
00:34:47,623 --> 00:34:52,971
We're prepared to give you a small budget and
to make your little paper an official supplement to The Courier.

407
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,010
Well, what do you think?

408
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:05,812
Well, gentlemen

409
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:09,697
I'm flattered by your offer...really

410
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:11,998
But you see...

411
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:18,753
If I accept your money
then I have to accept your rules and

412
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:25,466
Sorry but my readers will not allow the Gonzo
to be censored by anybody.

413
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,475
Let me put it another way.

414
00:35:29,022 --> 00:35:33,522
If you put out another issue,
I'm going to suspend you.

415
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:41,190
I guess you'll do what you have to do
and I'll do what I have to do.

416
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,380
Meeting adjourned? Great.

417
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:51,953
Big mistake, Gilman. Big mistake.

418
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:57,589
May I say it was fun.

419
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,638
It's been a really long time since I had fun.

420
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,346
Cute.

421
00:36:07,204 --> 00:36:08,478
They called my paper "cute."

422
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,635
-Who?
-Who do you think?

423
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:14,648
Riley? Who cares what that asshole thinks.

424
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,170
Don't let him get in your head, Gonzo.
That's what he wants.

425
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,850
What if he's right?

426
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,690
What if people really do see this paper
as just another prank

427
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,170
like streaking across stage during graduation

428
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,650
But that's not what this is.

429
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:36,900
Look, on the website people are
already sending me letters

430
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:39,600
Real letters looking for advice.

431
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:44,450
And not just about perverted sex shit either

432
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:49,490
You have no idea how many girls
were screwed over in this school.

433
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:52,818
I'm gonna try and help.

434
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,641
See that's cool.

435
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:59,997
yeah your thing is really cool

436
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:02,285
What did I write?

437
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,646
About some stupid shit
about a triangle player.

438
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:09,596
Great reporters find great
subjects, change things...

439
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,887
Give yourself a break.
It's only the first issue.

440
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:33,093
This is the premise. Parker Prep was built
over a graveyard for the criminally insane.

441
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:38,213
And now, these psychotic ghosts all rise
up from the dead and killing everyone in school.

442
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:43,493
It's up to a band of brave students
well-versed in the dark arts to save the day.

443
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:49,373
- These brave students are led by Hyperion?
- That is correct.

444
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:53,173
- I have the first 16 issues ready.
- Deadline's November 23rd. Next!

445
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:58,533
I device Rudoku, which is like
Sudoku but for word lovers.

446
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:01,653
They're fiendishly clever.

447
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,293
I don't think so.

448
00:38:17,158 --> 00:38:19,653
This is a manifesto on the coming
environmental apocalypse

449
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:24,213
I wanna print it on the front page.

450
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,145
Every word.

451
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:30,948
That's cool, man...okay...

452
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:36,019
Glad someone's looking ahead.
Planning for the future.

453
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:40,267
"It's called out and about in Parker Prep"

454
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:44,921
If you're in the closet, we will hunt
you down and drag you out by force.

455
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,159
We're bullshit detectors too.

456
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:49,537
Right on.

457
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,963
His problem is he's not horny enough.

458
00:38:55,173 --> 00:38:59,939
I want nudity. I want spycams
in the girls' locker room kinda shit.

459
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:07,625
- I mean quit teasing me, man.
- "More T and A". Duly noted, thank you very much.

460
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:09,724
You don't have to be dicks about it.

461
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,167
- I'm Stone. This is Malloy.

462
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:21,677
What are you guys, characters
from a mid-70s cop show?

463
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,164
No, we're sophomores. And we love The Gonzo.

464
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:30,997
We want be your interns, y'know.
Fetch you coffee.

465
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:33,386
-Run you errands, whatever.
-We just wanna learn.

466
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:44,083
You guys wanna help? Get everybody in a line.
Tell them they'll all get a chance as long
as they order something to eat.

467
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:47,171
- You mean we're hired?

468
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,057
Correct.

469
00:39:52,574 --> 00:39:55,848
Okay, people. You wanna talk, you gotta eat!

470
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:58,088
Take a menu and line your asses up.

471
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:03,173
Stone and Malloy. Good addition.

472
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:11,460
-Hey! Are you gonna tell me what's going on?
-With what?

473
00:40:11,461 --> 00:40:12,461
-With Easy.

474
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:15,853
- You're hanging out, right?
-No.

475
00:40:15,973 --> 00:40:19,133
C'mon. She 420-friendly, bareback-rider,
fluent in French?

476
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:23,613
Dude, c'mon. Stop.
She's not like that.

477
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:28,533
No. You're spending all of your time with her.
You cannot tell me you're just friends.

478
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:31,242
We're...

479
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:32,772
Colleagues.

480
00:40:33,813 --> 00:40:36,853
Yeah, colleagues.

481
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,511
Geez, you are an idiot!

482
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:47,371
You. Sloppy Joe-time, of course.

483
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:55,023
Fantastic! Thank you very much.
I'm telling you, sir, you need to try this out. It's unbelievable.

484
00:40:56,976 --> 00:40:59,937
Look, I bring my lunch from home.

485
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:01,409
I'll give you half.

486
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:06,318
-It's brain food.
-Oh no!

487
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,101
No. That shit is nasty. Please.
Just give my man the Joe.

488
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,772
- I think I want the Joe.
- Give him the Joe.

489
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,311
Okay! Alright.

490
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:22,299
You want the Sloppy Joe?
You got it.

491
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:29,179
Here, take a little more.
Nice and sloppy

492
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:39,089
- How long's he been in there?
- A while. He's been there a while. He's got a weak stomach.

493
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:44,649
- I hope he's okay.
- Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.

494
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:48,649
- You okay. Doing well these days?
- Yeah.

495
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:52,387
I've got it!

496
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:58,170
We do an investigative piece into the
health conditions in our cafeteria.

497
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:01,115
They shut us in that lunchroom
and then they poison us!

498
00:42:01,116 --> 00:42:03,729
I bet a lot of kids have gotten sick this year.

499
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:04,953
We have to find out why.

500
00:42:04,954 --> 00:42:06,745
I'm gonna give you a couple of breath mints.

501
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:11,311
Coz your breath really smell bad right
now due to the vomit in your throat.

502
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,760
-This is the story.
-Where do we start?

503
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:21,814
We have to get the school nurse's records.

504
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:26,534
- Gonzo! Those are confidential.
It'll never happen.

505
00:42:26,535 --> 00:42:29,003
Right. All part of the cover-up.

506
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,391
Yeah. Let me get my laptop. I got an idea.

507
00:42:32,392 --> 00:42:35,857
-What's your idea?
-Let's put a poll question on the website.

508
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:49,895
Let's see if we got any responses.

509
00:43:05,404 --> 00:43:08,925
Sorry. Not a lot of people come up here.

510
00:43:08,926 --> 00:43:09,926
No one, actually.

511
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:16,092
I'll be good.
You won't have to hit me.

512
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,522
Oh my God, we have 11 hits already.

513
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:28,771
You're kidding me.

514
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,969
Look who's liking the site now.

515
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:38,610
I can see that it's a useful tool.
I don't see why you have to rub it in my face.

516
00:43:40,457 --> 00:43:44,854
Hey look, that cheerleader really wasn't bulimic.
She was out of school for salmonella.

517
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,650
Salmonella is a really serious illness.

518
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:51,116
She probably got a doctor's note.

519
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:53,995
-That's hard evidence, we can print it.
-and scan it.

520
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:56,542
This is really big.

521
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,359
We have to interview everybody.

522
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:04,005
Let's go over what we know.

523
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:07,302
The majority of these complaints

524
00:44:07,303 --> 00:44:12,984
are about the sloppy joes, the taco or the burger.

525
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:16,673
So, class...

526
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:18,905
What do all these things have in common?

527
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,895
The meat. -The meat. -Meat.

528
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:23,749
- The meat!
- Good job, Rob.

529
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:26,672
-Thank you.
-Yeah, the meat.

530
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:31,346
The beef. I wonder what
company Parker Prep uses.

531
00:44:31,347 --> 00:44:34,199
You can ask Principal Roy about that.

532
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,618
No, I couldn't. He doesn't
know we're doing another issue.

533
00:44:39,729 --> 00:44:43,009
Only one way to find out.

534
00:45:40,729 --> 00:45:43,209
My God, look!

535
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:58,409
Anybody in here?

536
00:46:09,146 --> 00:46:14,049
Goddamn, Ratatouille!
Every night with you guys!

537
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:27,594
Let's keep shooting.
This stuff is gold.

538
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:32,154
Not only were conditions shocking
but further investigation revealed this meat to be Grade D.

539
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:35,594
which is only used in pet food and school lunches.

540
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:38,954
The expirations dates were all slightly off.

541
00:46:43,354 --> 00:46:47,794
Gonzo people demand answers.
Gonzo people demand justice.

542
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:52,034
We will not stop until both are ours.

543
00:46:52,194 --> 00:46:55,192
- Unacceptable!
- I told you I wasn't lying.

544
00:46:55,193 --> 00:46:57,942
This is why I puked, bitches.

545
00:47:00,348 --> 00:47:02,130
Have you seen this?

546
00:47:02,131 --> 00:47:05,408
This is disgusting.
I'm never going in there again.

547
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:07,912
The ink work is insane.

548
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:11,325
- This is like early Steve Ditko.

549
00:47:12,436 --> 00:47:15,466
Thanks, bro.
I can put you in the next issue.

550
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:17,676
Any superpower you want.

551
00:47:17,914 --> 00:47:21,229
I wanna see through walls.

552
00:47:22,994 --> 00:47:24,370
Yes!

553
00:47:41,828 --> 00:47:43,988
You're kidding me.

554
00:47:45,348 --> 00:47:48,308
Okay, everybody! Listen up.

555
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:53,108
There are inspectors from the Board of Health in there.

556
00:47:53,228 --> 00:47:56,828
They're shutting the cafeteria down! We won!

557
00:47:59,428 --> 00:48:04,868
I don't think Roy can keep us inside anymore.
We gotta eat somewhere, right?

558
00:48:04,988 --> 00:48:08,228
Let's get the hell outta here.

559
00:48:08,348 --> 00:48:11,988
Gonzo! Gonzo!

560
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:19,908
I'm hungry!

561
00:48:20,948 --> 00:48:27,490
Get some mushu pork.
Get a salad for christsake

562
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,610
You really think you can beat me, Gilman?

563
00:48:45,336 --> 00:48:49,444
Please. You're playing checkers
and I'm playing chess.

564
00:48:50,754 --> 00:48:55,559
- I'm always 10 steps ahead.
- Whatever, man.

565
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,157
Roy would like to see you. Now.

566
00:49:01,214 --> 00:49:04,768
We had no idea he was even
doing this. Doesn't that bother you?

567
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:07,524
Honey, you act like he's building
bombs in the garage.

568
00:49:07,525 --> 00:49:11,393
He's been suspended, Arthur.
That means he can't make the honor roll.

569
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:14,589
His grades are slipping too.
Columbia's gonna laugh at him.

570
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,814
You are like a robot now.
Who's programming you? This is magic.

571
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:22,864
Okay? Some people never do anything this
special their whole lives and you are missing it.

572
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,294
I'm not even sure they
have a right to suspend you.

573
00:49:26,494 --> 00:49:29,054
You should fight it.
There are some first amendment issues there.

574
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:33,374
-Not the First Amendment.
-He should be able to write what he wants to write.

575
00:49:33,494 --> 00:49:35,489
No one's disputing the facts of the story.

576
00:49:35,775 --> 00:49:38,094
Stop it!
Do you want to make a bigger mess?

577
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:40,713
Let him get through high school
then he can save the world.

578
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:44,392
Listen, Eddie. I know how special you are.

579
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:48,144
But you just can't act on every impulse.

580
00:49:48,145 --> 00:49:54,169
If you don't plan for life and put things in place,
you're gonna regret it. Trust me.

581
00:50:14,657 --> 00:50:19,521
-Gonzo Gilman? The Parker Prep whistle-blower?
-Yeah that's me.

582
00:50:20,114 --> 00:50:24,514
I'm Charlie Ronald. I do a segment on
"Local Heroes" on New York 3.

583
00:50:24,674 --> 00:50:30,754
- Oh yeah. Charlie Ronald, "on the streets."
- "And in your face." That's me, yeah.

584
00:50:30,954 --> 00:50:35,474
- Mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Yeah, sure.

585
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:39,434
Might wanna put some pants on first.

586
00:50:44,013 --> 00:50:47,119
- How'd you find me?
- You're not the only one chasing stories, kid.

587
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:54,293
Stencil. Here you go, man. That's yours.

588
00:50:54,413 --> 00:50:58,853
Gonzo's like Nelson Mandela
or John Gotti

589
00:50:59,053 --> 00:51:01,813
Someone who fought for his people,
ended up in jail because of it

590
00:51:01,973 --> 00:51:06,453
And now  it's all of our responsibility
to spread the word, okay!

591
00:51:06,573 --> 00:51:09,023
Are you with us, brother?

592
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,765
That's what I'm talking about.

593
00:51:12,853 --> 00:51:16,333
We got 97 signatures.
Roy's gotta know how we feel, man.

594
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:20,173
No justice, no peace!

595
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:24,366
Who said the revolution wouldn't be televised?

596
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,714
Now that's what I call lunch.

597
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:32,229
- Are you watching it?

598
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:34,095
It's insane.

599
00:51:33,571 --> 00:51:38,411
27 code violations in this school's cafeteria
but Principal Roy still refuses to comment.

600
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:43,143
We'll be making a full statement.
We're not gonna do it in the parking lot.

601
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:48,783
Meanwhile Gonzo Gilman is sweating out the 4th day
of a week-long suspension that many feel is unjust.

602
00:51:48,784 --> 00:51:53,731
The question must be asked.
Is the wrong person being punished here?

603
00:51:53,732 --> 00:51:55,309
Does Parker Prep even have the right to censor him?

604
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,571
This is Charlie Ronald for New York Free News.

605
00:51:57,731 --> 00:52:00,811
On the streets and in your face.

606
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:09,884
Charlie Ronald is your old college buddy.
You made him do this, didn't you?

607
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:12,804
You know how Eddie gets carried away.
You're just setting him up for a fall.

608
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:18,204
-I know your early decision at Brown, Evie.
But check this out.

609
00:52:18,324 --> 00:52:22,432
The dean from Columbia finally wrote me back.

610
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:27,664
He's impressed with my stuff and
apparently, I'm on the shortlist.

611
00:52:27,665 --> 00:52:28,665
I know, it's huge.

612
00:52:29,124 --> 00:52:33,404
Dean fuckin Herbert on the Gonzo

613
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:36,867
Who says he's gonna fall?

614
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:45,299
Come back and see us again.
I sing on Thursdays.

615
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:52,138
That's a good cup of coffee.

616
00:52:53,595 --> 00:52:54,534
Busy day, huh?

617
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:59,939
Just like the old days before McDonald's
and Pizza Hut moved in.

618
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:02,882
You couldn't get a table in this place.

619
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:05,895
This whole Gonzo thing must be good for you, huh?

620
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:09,369
Saved my business. I'll tell you that.

621
00:53:09,661 --> 00:53:11,272
For now anyway.

622
00:53:11,273 --> 00:53:15,139
Cuts both ways, doesn't it?

623
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:20,692
- What do you mean?
- You are his biggest advertiser,right?

624
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:26,235
First advertiser too.
I'm the one that got the whole ball rolling.

625
00:53:27,136 --> 00:53:30,570
You see?
He couldn't do it without you.

626
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:34,093
I guess we helped each other.

627
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:35,094
I'll say you have.

628
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:41,327
We're open in the backroom
for the first time since '98.

629
00:53:41,573 --> 00:53:44,415
We're gonna have a big party.
Why don't you come.

630
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:45,416
Saturday night?

631
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:49,283
- Yeah. It'll be fun.
- Maybe I'll check it out.

632
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:16,983
Is Gonzo here? He's coming, right?

633
00:54:16,984 --> 00:54:19,698
He said he was coming but
he's grounded so who knows.

634
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:24,351
Hey, dude!

635
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:26,716
We got Gonzo
30 seconds to stage.

636
00:55:55,596 --> 00:56:01,558
Alright Melnick.
Get his ass off the stage!

637
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,453
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

638
00:56:07,902 --> 00:56:13,374
My man, the freedom fighter from Parker Prep.
Give it up for Gonzo Gilman!

639
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:26,492
My people!

640
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:44,606
What schools, and police and governments
fail to realize

641
00:56:44,607 --> 00:56:47,614
is that we've got the power!

642
00:56:54,476 --> 00:57:00,316
You know what's a damn shame
is when we forget that too.

643
00:57:03,226 --> 00:57:05,138
You know what I'm seeing right now?

644
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:08,051
I'm seeing that we're starting to realize.

645
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:12,563
Do you see that?

646
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:16,816
Do you see what we can do?

647
00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:24,396
You gonna print another issue?

648
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:26,556
What do you think?

649
00:57:38,493 --> 00:57:42,213
I'm from North. He's from Central.
She's from GW.

650
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:46,813
We wanna go Gonzo on our schools too.
We wanna really blow some shit up that way.

651
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:53,573
Right on. We can just send you the lay-outs.
All you have to do is pull 'em out.

652
00:57:53,773 --> 00:57:59,119
Just tell the truth, brothers and sisters.
That's all I ask.

653
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,336
Even if the truth hurts.

654
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:08,525
What's up, Gilman?

655
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:10,396
Riley?

656
00:58:16,862 --> 00:58:18,625
I came to congratulate you, man.

657
00:58:19,346 --> 00:58:21,853
You had an idea. You followed it through.

658
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:24,170
And it worked.

659
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,364
That's pretty cool, man.

660
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:29,034
Uh...Thanks, man.

661
00:58:29,035 --> 00:58:34,005
Our humble little paper is coming out on Monday.
It's not the Gonzo but

662
00:58:34,006 --> 00:58:37,949
There's a really interesting article in there
I think you should check out.

663
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,822
Okay.

664
00:58:44,502 --> 00:58:46,502
Evie.

665
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:51,782
Evie Wallace!

666
00:58:54,262 --> 00:58:57,342
You are glowing.

667
00:58:57,502 --> 00:59:00,622
I'm really happy for you.

668
00:59:00,822 --> 00:59:03,289
For both of you.

669
00:59:04,892 --> 00:59:05,913
Monday.

670
00:59:17,071 --> 00:59:21,511
We should get outta here, right?
This party's totally dying down.

671
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:28,511
We can go back to my place. My parents are gone.
After after party. Just the staff.

672
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:32,111
Yeah. Rally the troops.

673
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:43,881
You know, I've been working it

674
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,110
-I think tonight it's finally going down.
-What?

675
00:59:47,544 --> 00:59:49,000
Every man's fantasy

676
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:53,791
You know what the French call "eating for three?"

677
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:58,776
Robbie ...

678
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,381
I'll be right there.

679
01:00:00,382 --> 01:00:03,321
Oh sweet Jesus, no.
- Oh yes.

680
01:00:03,481 --> 01:00:07,801
Pretty nervous.
It's my first time but

681
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:11,728
I put my camera in there, I set it up
so I'm just gonna film myself and
watch it later and see how I did.

682
01:00:11,729 --> 01:00:15,313
-Hey, I'll s how it to you if you want.
-Oh no. That's really okay.

683
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:21,623
Wish me luck, man.
Prayin for you.

684
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:24,514
-Let's hope there's enough of me to go around, right?
-Yeah.

685
01:01:10,593 --> 01:01:13,793
Are you a virgin?

686
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:15,988
What?

687
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:20,033
Have you ever had sex?

688
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:23,353
We're just really divin in there, aren't we?

689
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:31,993
Remember Elizabeth Frankel?
She moved away last year. She's in our grade.

690
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:38,913
We've been best friends since elementary school.
We made this pact to get it over with.

691
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,357
How was it?

692
01:01:40,913 --> 01:01:43,807
Embarrassing...if truth be told.

693
01:01:46,393 --> 01:01:50,100
There I was humping away

694
01:01:50,926 --> 01:01:55,193
Thought I was doing great.
Really thought I was championing that sex

695
01:01:55,353 --> 01:02:00,593
I looked up at one point to
see how she was liking it...

696
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:04,753
She had this confused,
sorrowful look on her face

697
01:02:04,913 --> 01:02:08,993
Turns out my dick was actually
caught in her comforter.

698
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:12,192
- Get out!
- I won't.

699
01:02:12,193 --> 01:02:16,712
It was a really soft and satiny comforter.
You've gotta believe me.

700
01:02:18,633 --> 01:02:25,353
Anyway, then we finally got it in for real

701
01:02:25,513 --> 01:02:27,259
You know that whole awkward dance

702
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:32,817
Just really trying to keep my flag flying

703
01:02:32,818 --> 01:02:37,566
Finally she gets into it
and she starts moving around and

704
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:39,861
It was over in like

705
01:02:40,628 --> 01:02:43,601
Ten seconds...Seven seconds.

706
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:50,484
Yup. I was a real pleasure machine that night.

707
01:02:57,004 --> 01:02:59,026
What about you?

708
01:03:01,058 --> 01:03:02,508
You ever do it?

709
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:11,819
Evie, c'mon. I told you mine.
You gotta tell me yours.

710
01:03:11,979 --> 01:03:16,499
- Law of reciprocation.
- Oh really, I didn't realize there are laws involved here.

711
01:03:16,704 --> 01:03:18,083
Well now you know.

712
01:03:21,274 --> 01:03:26,967
It's not a good story.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

713
01:03:27,299 --> 01:03:32,419
I think you brought it up because
you really wanna tell me.

714
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:36,259
Evie, my first time was with a blanket.

715
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:39,459
Gonzo! Are you up there?

716
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:44,419
I need water!

717
01:03:47,019 --> 01:03:49,979
Let's get some air.

718
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:58,284
Last year, I had to take this science
class with Riley.

719
01:03:58,444 --> 01:04:04,284
And I had this mad crush on him
like all the girls.

720
01:04:05,366 --> 01:04:07,524
And I was trying to flirt with him and everything

721
01:04:09,123 --> 01:04:12,305
Finally he invited me to this really cool party

722
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:17,644
And I wore this little dress

723
01:04:19,101 --> 01:04:21,413
And I got really drunk

724
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:27,593
It was stupid but
I was just really nervous, y'know.

725
01:04:30,396 --> 01:04:34,684
Anyway, I wind up losing my virginity to the guy...

726
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:38,124
Which was okay.

727
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,918
It was sort of what I wanted.

728
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:45,966
But it turned into this total nightmare.

729
01:04:48,846 --> 01:04:52,097
I was so messed up that

730
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:55,843
I didn't notice his jock buddies
were there cheering us on.

731
01:04:58,116 --> 01:05:02,916
And after he was finished

732
01:05:03,036 --> 01:05:08,316
This other guy tried to get in on me

733
01:05:09,356 --> 01:05:14,316
I had to fight him off

734
01:05:15,716 --> 01:05:22,636
I was crying. I was trying to get my clothes on.
I was trying to get out of the house.

735
01:05:25,836 --> 01:05:28,796
It was horrible.

736
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:37,076
And Gavin Riley acted like
the whole thing was a joke.

737
01:05:39,116 --> 01:05:43,156
He didn't defend me or anything

738
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:46,196
He laughed

739
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:55,419
He totally disputes it at school the next day

740
01:05:55,579 --> 01:06:01,379
and all these rumors started that
I did the whole wrestling team.

741
01:06:04,659 --> 01:06:07,699
He ruined my life.

742
01:06:08,979 --> 01:06:11,499
Son of a bitch.

743
01:06:12,739 --> 01:06:18,899
Ever since then not only
have I not had a boyfriend

744
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:22,059
I really don't have anybody.

745
01:06:23,499 --> 01:06:31,812
Just sort of shut down, I guess.

746
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,083
Evie, listen...

747
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:47,560
Not everybody in this world
is an asshole like Gavin Riley.

748
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,880
I'm not.

749
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,840
I know.

750
01:07:25,092 --> 01:07:27,800
-Let's go slow, okay.
- Yeah

751
01:07:50,854 --> 01:07:54,088
Eddie! Breakfast!

752
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,792
Hey Mr. Sandman, get up! Get up!

753
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,460
Gilman!

754
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,820
You need a life.

755
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:28,140
- Gonzo, is it true?
- Did you really do it, Gonzo?

756
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:31,260
Do what?

757
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:45,235
- What the hell?
- Listen up, Gonzo

758
01:08:45,236 --> 01:08:47,500
Riley has proposed the following chain of events

759
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:54,252
That Errol bankrolled your paper, and you broke
into the school at night and planted
the rats and roaches in the kitchen

760
01:08:54,253 --> 01:08:57,617
The health inspectors came
and closed down the cafeteria

761
01:08:57,618 --> 01:09:02,750
necessitating that we eat at off-campus
diner thus saving Errol's business.

762
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:06,678
- Riley claims that was your plan.
- That is ridiculous!

763
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:10,460
Thing is Riley has a pretty good slam on us.

764
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,448
He's even got surveillance
photos and everything.

765
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:16,723
But these are from when we got the footage.
We didn't plant anything.

766
01:09:19,214 --> 01:09:21,410
He actually expects people to believe this?

767
01:09:23,732 --> 01:09:27,124
- You better be suspending Riley!
- Calm down, Mr. Gilman.

768
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:34,052
Calm down. I got in trouble for telling the truth.
This is nothing but lies. Don't tell me he's gonna skate.

769
01:09:35,452 --> 01:09:40,132
There's gonna be a thorough investigation,
believe me and I don't answer to you.

770
01:09:40,332 --> 01:09:43,492
I'm gonna do a little thorough investigation
of my own, if you don't mind.

771
01:09:43,572 --> 01:09:46,212
I do mind.

772
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:50,972
In fact, if you respond with another issue of your paper,
I'll kick you out of school.

773
01:09:51,092 --> 01:09:53,854
You and all your sidekicks.

774
01:09:55,337 --> 01:09:56,522
Consider yourselves warned.

775
01:10:04,252 --> 01:10:08,692
This article is bullshit
and you know it.

776
01:10:08,812 --> 01:10:14,812
- Prove it.
- Prove it? I'm gonna destroy you.

777
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:22,132
You better watch it, little guy.
I've got the goods on everybody.

778
01:10:24,692 --> 01:10:27,532
Take it easy.

779
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:38,321
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

780
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:41,597
I don't wanna find out.

781
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,092
I have a plan, guys.
I've been thinking about it all day.

782
01:10:47,032 --> 01:10:50,712
We have to interview those health inspectors.

783
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:56,392
Get the nurse's full records.
Do a background check on continental meats.

784
01:10:56,592 --> 01:11:02,112
We gotta fight back.
Okay who wants to do what?

785
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,712
Anyone?

786
01:11:07,072 --> 01:11:10,752
- We've all been talking a little bit.
-Behind my back?

787
01:11:10,832 --> 01:11:14,232
No man, c'mon.

788
01:11:14,392 --> 01:11:17,840
We just don't think that we should do another issue.

789
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:18,671
What?

790
01:11:18,672 --> 01:11:22,752
We've already taken this so much further
than we ever thought we could

791
01:11:22,952 --> 01:11:26,653
- It's been awesome but
- We cannot get expelled.

792
01:11:26,653 --> 01:11:33,392
Shneeman, nobody's getting expelled.
First amendment, man. Roy's bluffing.

793
01:11:33,512 --> 01:11:37,806
Sorry, I can't risk it. I worked my
whole life to get into Princeton.

794
01:11:38,184 --> 01:11:40,410
- My parents will have a shitfit.

795
01:11:40,411 --> 01:11:46,027
This might blow your minds guys but
some things are more important than college.

796
01:11:46,028 --> 01:11:48,465
-Riley's story is bullshit!
-Yeah.

797
01:11:48,466 --> 01:11:50,129
You're over-reacting.

798
01:11:50,668 --> 01:11:53,868
Just put something on the website like:

799
01:11:54,028 --> 01:12:00,148
"Anyone can make allegations without a shred of proof.
We stand by our story 100%"

800
01:12:00,268 --> 01:12:03,348
Stand strong.

801
01:12:06,108 --> 01:12:10,308
You guys just aren't seeing the bigger picture here.

802
01:12:10,468 --> 01:12:17,536
Gonzo Gilman isn't just your friend anymore.
Okay? He's a public figure.

803
01:12:17,537 --> 01:12:22,822
He's a public figure that stands for truth
and justice and freedom.

804
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:28,108
And that is why if we don't prove that
everything in that article is an outright lie

805
01:12:28,308 --> 01:12:34,839
And the man who wrote them is a liar,
my name is dirt!

806
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,982
And everything we've done together is dirt!

807
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:45,209
We need one more issue. Come on!

808
01:12:50,009 --> 01:12:52,898
One little hit and you all fold.

809
01:12:54,747 --> 01:12:56,528
What's wrong with all of you?

810
01:12:56,529 --> 01:13:01,609
Well, this talking in the third person
business is kinda creepy for one.

811
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:08,345
Gonzo ...

812
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:14,465
All you have to do is graduate
and you get to go to your dream school

813
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:17,305
Are you really gonna let Riley ruin that?

814
01:13:17,515 --> 01:13:19,706
Then he really wins.

815
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,826
You need to let this go.

816
01:13:23,985 --> 01:13:25,956
Remember history.

817
01:13:25,957 --> 01:13:31,033
If Napoleon had stopped at Austerlitz,
he never would've had his Waterloo.

818
01:13:35,065 --> 01:13:41,065
You're just scared of Riley.
That's all this is. You know it.

819
01:13:46,383 --> 01:13:47,345
So I got about 8 lbs. of it.

820
01:13:53,027 --> 01:13:57,301
- What's wrong?
- Nobody cares about the truth, dad!

821
01:13:57,302 --> 01:14:00,345
- What?
- Why didn't you tell me that?

822
01:14:00,346 --> 01:14:01,346
Eddie!

823
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,720
- Would you like to try the capon, sir?
- Looks delicious.

824
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:57,600
- Now that's what I call spread, Gav.
- Fresh capon?

825
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,360
Belgian endive?

826
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,880
Okay folks, let's settle down.

827
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:20,440
We're gonna get started.
Quiet down, folks. Let's sit down.

828
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,689
What fresh hole is this?

829
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:28,209
Today is a very proud day at Parker Prep.

830
01:15:28,369 --> 01:15:31,449
Our own Gavin Riley has
won the Van Buren Prize.

831
01:15:31,609 --> 01:15:34,409
The most prestigious history
award in the country.

832
01:15:37,729 --> 01:15:44,369
It's for his paper "The History of Torture
Tactics and Psychological Warfare."

833
01:15:44,609 --> 01:15:49,238
Torture tactics and psychological warfare?

834
01:15:49,329 --> 01:15:55,593
Incredibly, Gavin is the third
member of his family to win this award.

835
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:59,514
And brothers, Shawn and Marcus,
are with us today. Come on up, guys.

836
01:15:59,674 --> 01:16:02,354
They're passing the torch.
Let me see if I got this right.

837
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:05,874
Shaun is at Dartmouth?
and Marcus is at Yale.

838
01:16:06,074 --> 01:16:11,514
- And Gavin, you wanna tell us where you're going next year?
- Stanford. Only decision.

839
01:16:13,994 --> 01:16:17,034
Mr. and Mrs. Riley should write a book.

840
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:21,434
Gavin Riley, why don't you say a few words, please.

841
01:16:21,554 --> 01:16:24,354
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

842
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:33,131
I just want to say that

843
01:16:34,211 --> 01:16:39,011
Standing on this stage with my two brothers

844
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:43,051
... it's the proudest moment of my life.

845
01:16:45,042 --> 01:16:49,406
Schneeman!
You gonna tell me what's going on, man?

846
01:16:49,407 --> 01:16:53,442
- What do you mean?
- Psychological Warfare?

847
01:16:53,602 --> 01:16:56,017
The history of torture tactics.
Those are your twin passions.

848
01:16:56,018 --> 01:16:58,604
You were gonna write
your Van Buren paper on that.

849
01:16:58,605 --> 01:17:00,402
Riley just had the same idea.

850
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,242
Schneeman, we have been
through too much together.

851
01:17:06,147 --> 01:17:08,924
Okay, man. Level with me.

852
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:11,299
Did you make some kind of deal with him?

853
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:19,551
This is totaly off the record.
You can't tell anyone, okay? Promise.

854
01:17:19,751 --> 01:17:24,231
I gave him my paper in exchange
for protection from the bullies for the entire school year.

855
01:17:24,391 --> 01:17:29,195
- What? You've gotta be kidding me!
- It's true.

856
01:17:29,196 --> 01:17:31,524
And honestly, I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

857
01:17:31,525 --> 01:17:35,357
I'm living fear-free for the first time, floating on air!

858
01:17:35,358 --> 01:17:38,031
It's like a terrible weight has been lifted.

859
01:17:38,151 --> 01:17:44,351
- The onions on this guy! I swear...
- Gonzo!

860
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:51,461
You can't tell anyone.
Please. PLEASE!

861
01:18:13,816 --> 01:18:17,216
Remember when you found out
when Santa Claus didn't really exist?

862
01:18:17,376 --> 01:18:19,496
That your father was really the toothfairy

863
01:18:19,696 --> 01:18:24,296
or that Barry Bonds didn't get
his muscles from eating spinach?

864
01:18:24,456 --> 01:18:31,136
Well, my friends, today, sadly,
another idol must fall.

865
01:18:34,856 --> 01:18:38,496
Holy shit.
Gonzo has completely lost his mind.

866
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:45,136
King, Gandhi or Parks I sort of understand
but Patrick Henry has no historical relevance whatsoever.

867
01:18:45,296 --> 01:18:48,096
Schneeman, you better look at this.

868
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:51,296
Scott Marshall Schneeman
had enough.

869
01:18:51,456 --> 01:18:58,089
Enough of the teasing, of the beatings,
of the humiliations he had to suffer his entire life.

870
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:02,749
so when Gavin Riley came
to him with a nefarious proposal

871
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:05,832
that would make his troubles magically disappear

872
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:08,656
Schneeman was more than ready to listen.

873
01:19:12,316 --> 01:19:16,076
This is bad. So bad...

874
01:19:18,076 --> 01:19:24,196
A pretty Parker Prep student, who shall remain
nameless, made the mistake of falling for Riley's charms.

875
01:19:24,316 --> 01:19:27,836
Last year, he invited her to a party
and she accepted

876
01:19:27,956 --> 01:19:32,396
expecting a night of fun,
possibly even romance.

877
01:19:32,556 --> 01:19:38,236
But what she experienced that night
was a horror that changed her life forever.

878
01:19:50,396 --> 01:19:54,156
All his academic records should be called into question

879
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:58,836
including his SATs. He should probably be tested for
steroids too because he probably cheats at wrestling.

880
01:19:59,036 --> 01:20:04,836
Gavin Riley is a total fraud
academically, personally, morally.

881
01:20:05,036 --> 01:20:10,156
He needs to be unmasked
in every conceivable way.

882
01:20:29,596 --> 01:20:32,636
How could you do this...to us?

883
01:20:32,756 --> 01:20:35,356
You turned out to be worse than Riley.

884
01:20:35,556 --> 01:20:37,367
You did this alone?

885
01:20:39,725 --> 01:20:41,073
In my office now.

886
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:47,116
You are suspended indefinitely
pending an expulsion hearing.

887
01:20:51,516 --> 01:20:55,196
- Schneeman, I'm coming, man!
- No! NO! Get away from me!

888
01:20:55,356 --> 01:20:59,648
You broke your promise.
I'd rather stay here a week than be helped by you.

889
01:21:00,093 --> 01:21:01,836
Leave! You're not my friend!

890
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:05,796
Leave! Why are you still here?
Leave! Leave! Go! GO!

891
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:10,196
Good for you, Schneeman.

892
01:21:12,106 --> 01:21:15,557
Evie, thank God.
I've been calling you all day.

893
01:21:15,558 --> 01:21:18,934
You're not gonna believe the day I'm having.

894
01:21:18,935 --> 01:21:20,057
Fuck off!

895
01:21:20,058 --> 01:21:24,478
- What? What's wrong?
- Look at the website, asshole!

896
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:38,872
- Did Riley post this?
- I told you to leave it alone but you wouldn't listen.

897
01:21:39,032 --> 01:21:44,632
We can take this out.
We can delete it from the site. We're the administrators.

898
01:21:44,832 --> 01:21:47,592
It's all over Youtube!

899
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:54,152
Evie ... Fuck!

900
01:22:09,969 --> 01:22:14,912
One time! ONE TIME
I cheated and you had to bust me like that?

901
01:22:16,269 --> 01:22:18,652
They're gonna take away my prize.

902
01:22:18,653 --> 01:22:23,520
Stanford is gonna review my transcript.
You fucked up everything!

903
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:26,078
-You shouldn't have done it.
-You are nothing.

904
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:27,511
Nothing!

905
01:22:28,585 --> 01:22:31,785
Nobody cares what you do.

906
01:22:32,025 --> 01:22:37,785
My family ...
I have to win.

907
01:22:39,305 --> 01:22:44,025
You have no idea how much
fucking pressure I'm under.

908
01:22:44,185 --> 01:22:48,145
- How could you do that to Evie?
- YOU did it to her, Gilman!

909
01:22:54,585 --> 01:22:58,545
Hey. I just missed you at the hospital.
My phone was off. Is he alright?

910
01:22:58,665 --> 01:23:03,225
He's gonna be fine. He had to get
a few stitches but he's gonna be alright.

911
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:06,385
You okay?

912
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:14,225
You were right. This is a total disaster.

913
01:23:14,345 --> 01:23:18,425
I can't believe he might not graduate.

914
01:23:18,545 --> 01:23:22,105
I just get so caught up, babe.

915
01:23:23,185 --> 01:23:26,225
I just want Eddie to have an interesting life.

916
01:23:26,425 --> 01:23:31,065
And try for great things.

917
01:23:32,425 --> 01:23:37,025
Everything shouldn't be about
pressure and stress and tests...

918
01:23:37,185 --> 01:23:41,265
I know. I know.
I tend to forget that.

919
01:23:41,465 --> 01:23:45,305
You're not the only one who gets carried away.

920
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,840
Eddie?

921
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,080
Eddie.

922
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,640
Jesus.

923
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,520
Let me see.

924
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:18,040
Wanna tell me what happened?

925
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,320
I messed up so bad.

926
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,640
I hurt everyone I care about.

927
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,760
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

928
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:41,240
Sometimes you just have to look
the world in the eye and say you're sorry.

929
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:54,104
You mean like throw myself
at the mercy of the courts type of deal?

930
01:24:55,648 --> 01:24:56,876
And pray they forgive you.

931
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:01,015
I've had a little practice of that myself.

932
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:11,850
- You need anything?
- I'm fine.

933
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:15,730
'famous apologies'

934
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:19,650
I'm deeply sorry that I did
not live up to what was expected of me

935
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:26,770
To every New Yorker and to all those who
believed in what I tried to stand for I sincerely apologize.

936
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:32,090
Indeed, I did have a relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate

937
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:38,770
now this matter is between me, my wife
and our daughter, and our God.

938
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:44,170
I must put it right. And I am prepared
to do whatever it takes to do so.

939
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:49,530
I have sinned against you, My Lord.

940
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:54,490
And I would ask that Your precious blood

941
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:02,610
... wash and cleanse

942
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:05,610
every stain

943
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:10,098
'GONZO GILMAN
ASSHOLE OF THE MONTH'

944
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:18,530
In the past week,
I ruined my chance to go to college

945
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:21,090
I lost all my friends

946
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:25,370
The one girl I ever cared about
will probably never talk to me again.

947
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:28,490
I also got my face kicked in.

948
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:38,002
But after everything I've done,
I probably got off easy.

949
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,564
You believed in me

950
01:26:43,113 --> 01:26:45,909
And I betrayed you all.

951
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:52,070
To the Gonzo staff -
Rob, Ming Na ...

952
01:26:54,070 --> 01:27:00,670
I'm sorry I let my stupid egotistical war
get in the way of the beautiful thing we built together

953
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:08,110
Scott Marshall Schneeman,
you told me something in confidence, man

954
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:12,630
and I sold you out.

955
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:18,390
I hope you can forgive me but if you can't

956
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:22,750
hey, I get it.

957
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:32,390
To the unnamed girl,
The last thing I wanted to do was hurt you.

958
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:39,190
I've never felt this bad about
anything before in my life.

959
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,662
But that probably doesn't help you much.

960
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:44,888
I'll do anything.

961
01:27:45,972 --> 01:27:50,109
I'll accept any form of punishment,
the crueler the better.

962
01:27:51,169 --> 01:27:53,470
just give me another chance.

963
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,100
Hey. I heard they let you back in.

964
01:29:12,101 --> 01:29:17,876
Yeah, my mom sweet-talked
Principal Roy at that hearing pretty hard.

965
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:22,910
There's no more Gonzo.
That's for sure.

966
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:26,430
- We wanna start up again next year.
- If that's okay with you.

967
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:29,750
We'll do it all online.
There are no principals in cyberspace.

968
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:33,469
We feel it's our duty, Gonzo.
The voice of the underdog must be heard.

969
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:38,300
- Power to the people.

970
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:45,390
- Riley been around?
- Hasn't shown his face.

971
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:48,550
- What a pussy.
- He should take his lumps like a man.

972
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:51,950
'MY HOUSE, 4PM'

973
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:21,930
Evie!

974
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:50,250
Thanks for seeing me.

975
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:56,810
- I just ...
- Don't tell me you're sorry.

976
01:30:56,811 --> 01:30:58,204
I know you're sorry.

977
01:30:59,747 --> 01:31:02,087
And don't think your little video meant anything.

978
01:31:02,696 --> 01:31:05,707
It was just another Gonzo Gilman Production.

979
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:07,545
All about you.

980
01:31:10,186 --> 01:31:12,213
- The what am I doing here?

981
01:31:15,502 --> 01:31:16,786
Let's talk in the car.

982
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:43,466
After I saw that clip of me naked at the party,
I swore I'll never talk to you again.

983
01:31:45,306 --> 01:31:49,146
I turned off all my lights.
Put on some really depressing music.

984
01:31:49,306 --> 01:31:54,066
Got under my covers.
I was ready to say screw the world.

985
01:31:54,266 --> 01:31:57,186
Shut everybody out.

986
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:02,710
Somehow it didn't feel right this time.

987
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:04,033
What?

988
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,864
Playing the victim.

989
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:13,790
It wasn't me anymore.
I know how to fight back now.

990
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:17,134
No matter what...

991
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:18,907
... asshole ...

992
01:32:19,883 --> 01:32:21,004
...ASSHOLE...

993
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:24,469
... thing you did,

994
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,694
you gave me that.

995
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:31,666
you and your paper.

996
01:32:33,358 --> 01:32:34,684
That was big.

997
01:32:35,999 --> 01:32:37,470
So what are you saying, Evie?

998
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:44,370
Are we friends again?
Can we be friends again?

999
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:48,090
Can I trust you?

1000
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:55,410
I mean really, really trust you?

1001
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:02,810
My heart broke for you, Evie.

1002
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:06,158
I know it did.

1003
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:09,055
I learned my lesson.

1004
01:33:27,858 --> 01:33:29,518
What's so funny?

1005
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:36,840
I'm just really relieved.
This has been killing me.

1006
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,640
Don't get so ahead of yourself.
You still need to be punished.

1007
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,000
Let's just say you better watch your back.

1008
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:53,480
Okay. I think I can live with that.

1009
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:01,612
- Do you want to get some food?
- Yeah.

1010
01:34:02,566 --> 01:34:05,054
We should probably throw Errol some business.

1011
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:17,000
- What's the deal with this car?
- That is a whole other story.

1012
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:36,290
- Did Riley post or Evie?
- No, but I did.

1013
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:39,210
You have to scroll down a little bit more.

1014
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:41,770
- Bingo! There we go.
- Oh no, Rob!

1015
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:46,690
- Not the sex tape
- Yup. I posted the tape of me having sex with women.

1016
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:49,914
- Press play.
- I really don't want to.

1017
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:50,944
Push play

1018
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:58,966
and you will see me communicating...
with my body.

1019
01:35:02,133 --> 01:35:03,616
Okay ...

1020
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:10,530
See this? This is my truth.

1021
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:16,690
Isn't that what Gonzo was supposed to be all about?

1022
01:35:18,426 --> 01:35:20,904
- Okay, don't touch me, dude.
- Okay. That's fine.

1023
01:35:21,011 --> 01:35:22,937
Watch the rest of it coz the end is really good.

1024
