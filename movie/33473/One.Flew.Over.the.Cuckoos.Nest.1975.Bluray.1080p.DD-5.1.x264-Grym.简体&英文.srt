Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure it is to meet you.

74
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,020
很好  拿张椅子坐下  我们谈谈
Sure. Pull up a chair, sit down and let's talk.

75
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,080
好的
Sure.

76
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,370
麦克墨菲
R.P. McMurphy.

77
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,970
那条鱼真大
That's a hell of a fish there, Doc.

78
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,070
-是不是很棒  -对
-Isn't that a dandy?  -Yeah.

79
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,030
大概有40磅吧?
It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?

80
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,820
-没有  32磅  -32磅...
-No, 32.  -Thirty-two...

81
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,040
告诉你吧
But I'll tell you,

82
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,950
照相时我用尽力气...
it took every bit of strength I had to hold it out there...

83
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,790
才能抓住它
while the guy took the picture.

84
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,010
是需要好大的力气
Every damn bit.

85
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,780
我想那铁链一点用也没有
Probably that chain didn't help it any, either.

86
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,080
你没有连铁链一起秤吧
You didn't weigh the chain, did you, Doc?

87
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,880
没有
No, I didn't weigh the chain.

88
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,890
我对这照片引以为傲
But I'll tell you, I'm awfully proud of that picture.

89
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,860
那是我第一次钓到那种鱼
That's the first Chinooker I ever caught.

90
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,830
好大的一条鱼
It's a nice one.

94
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,250
你为什么会被送到这里来?

95
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,480
我不知道啊
I don't know.

96
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,390
上面没有写吗?
What's it say there?

97
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,860
-你介意我抽烟吗?  -不会  不介意

98
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,400
上面写了几件事

99
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,870
有妄想症

100
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,570
没有许可就说话

101
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,510
工作态度很差  懒惰
You've been resentful in attitude toward work, in general. That you're lazy.

102
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,020
在课堂上吃嚼香糖
Chewing gum in class.

103
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,180
真正原因是...
Well, the real reason that you've been sent over here...

104
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,920
他们希望你被测试
is because they wanted you to be evaluated.

105
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,160
确定你是否有精神病
To determine whether or not you're mentally ill.

106
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,160
这才是真正的原因
This is the real reason.

107
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,170
你觉得他们为什么要这样想呢?
Why do you think they might think that?

108
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,530
我想可能是我...
Well, as near as I can figure out, it's cause I...

109
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,730
常常打架闹事
fight and fuck too much.

110
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,610
在监狱里吗?
In the penitentiary?

111
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,240
不...你是说...
No, no, no, you mean why...

112
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,840
为什么要把你从劳动农场...
Why did you get sent over here...

113
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,880
送到这里来呢?
from the work farm?

114
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,380
我真的不知道  医生
Well, I really don't know, Doc.

115
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,790
这上面写着...
It says here that you went around...

116
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,620
-让我看看...  -是他们找我麻烦
-Let me just take a look...  -It ain't up to me, you know.

117
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,660
1...
One...

118
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,930
2  3...
two, three...

119
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,690
4...
four...

120
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,320
你至少有...
You've got at least...

121
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,030
5次因闹事被逮捕
five arrests for assault.

122
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,560
这又怎么说?
What can you tell me about that?

123
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,270
5次打架?
Five fights, huh?

124
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,310
洛基打了40次  结果变成百万富翁
Rocky Marciano's got 40, and he's a millionaire.

125
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,740
-确实  -确实
-That's true.  -That is true.

126
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
你还与...
Of course, it's true that you went in for...

127
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,480
未成年人发生性关系
statutory rape.

128
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,540
这次是真的吧?
That's true, is it not, this time?

129
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,650
完全正确  可是医生...
Absolutely true. But, Doc...

130
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,520
她虽然只有15岁  但看起来像35岁...
she was 15 years old going on 35, Doc...

131
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,050
她告诉我她已经成年了  而且她...
and she told me she was 18, and she was...

132
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,300
说她是自愿的
very willing, you know what I mean?

133
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,270
我无法抵挡那个诱惑
I practically had to take to sewing my pants shut.

134
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,970
但是只有你跟我知道...
But between you and me...

135
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,600
她或许只有15岁  但是看到那个性感的臀部...
she might have been 15. When you get that little red beaver...

136
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,650
就在你眼前  我想那不算疯狂
right up there in front of you, I don't think it's crazy at all.

137
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,010
你也会那样做
And I don't think you do, either.

138
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,610
我听到了
I hear what you're saying.

139
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,880
没有男人可以抵挡那种诱惑
No man alive could resist that. That's why I got into jail to begin with.

140
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,080
这就是我进监狱的原因...
And now they're telling me I'm crazy over here...

141
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,850
只因为我不安静坐在那边
Cause I don't sit there like a goddamn vegetable.

142
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,050
这根本就不是疯了
It don't make a bit of sense to me.

143
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,120
如果这就是疯狂的话...
If that's what being crazy is...

144
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,860
那我跟街上那些疯子...
Then I'm senseless, out of it, gone down the road, whacko...

145
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,330
的确没有什么两样
but, no more, no less. That's it.

146
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:40,470
老实说  麦克墨菲  文件上面写的...
To be honest with you, McMurphy what it says here...

147
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,670
是这样...
is that...

148
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,950
他们觉得...
they think...

149
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,880
他们觉得...
they think...

150
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,010
这只是你逃避工作的藉口
you've been faking it in order to get out of your work detail.

151
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,990
你认为如何呢
What do you think about that?

152
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,360
你认为我是这样的人吗?
Do I look like that kind of guy to you?

153
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:05,430
让我们先不要下定论  好吧
Let's just be frank for a minute. All right, Randall, if you would.

154
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,890
告诉我...
Tell me...

155
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,430
你觉得你的精神有问题吗?
Do you think there's anything wrong with your mind, really?

156
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,370
不可能的  医生
Not a thing, Doc.

157
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,940
我可是现代科技产物
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.

158
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,840
你会在这边待一段时间  好让我们可以测试你
You're gonna be here for a period for us to evaluate you.

159
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,720
我们需要来诊断你
We're gonna study you.

160
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,050
然后我们会下结论  看看该怎么做...
We'll make our determinations as to what we're going to do...

161
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,490
该给你哪些必须的治疗
and give you the necessary treatment as indicated.

162
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,000
让我告诉你  医生
Doc, let me just tell you this.

163
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,930
我会百分之百的合作
I'm here to cooperate with you 100 percent.

164
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,600
百分之百
A hundred percent.

165
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,290
我会非常的合作  请你拭目以待
I'll be just right down the line with you. You watch.

166
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,270
因为我想我们会发现...
Cause I think we ought to get to the bottom of...

167
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,800
真正的麦克墨菲
R.P.McMurphy.

168
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,180
伸展手臂
The scythe.

169
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,830
我好累
I'm awfully tired.

170
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,920
坐下
Sit down.

171
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,160
我很累
I'm tired.

172
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,770
好点了吗?
Is that better?

173
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,640
艾斯渥斯先生...
Mr. Ellsworth...

174
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,850
你在整自己
you'll wear yourself out.

175
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,020
好了  各位  让我们开始
All right, gentlemen, let's begin.

176
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,720
在星期五的会议中...
At the close of Friday's meeting...

177
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,360
我们论论到哈定先生和他太太的问题
we were discussing Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife.

178
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,430
哈定先生说他的太太让他觉得不舒服...
Mr. Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy...

179
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,370
因为常常她注视着街上的男人
because she drew stares from men on the street.

180
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,170
对吧  哈定先生?
Is that correct, Mr. Harding?

181
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,270
是的
Yes.

182
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,640
没错
That's correct.

183
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,310
他同时也想给她藉口...
He also thinks he may have given her reason...

184
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,180
去外面寻找性生活  但是他说不出口
to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he wasn't able to say how.

185
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,920
哈定先生对他太太说过
Mr. Harding has been heard to say to his wife:

186
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,480
我恨你
"I hate you."

187
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,820
我不想再见到你
"I don't ever want to see you again."

188
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,920
你背叛我
"You've betrayed me."

189
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,670
有人要发表意见吗?
So, does anyone care to touch on this further?

190
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,150
史肯隆先生  你要起个头吗?
Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?

191
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,620
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

192
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,290
比利  你呢?
Billy, how about you?

193
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,000
不了  女士
No, no, ma'am.

194
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,500
我希望有一次会议是由你开始发言的
I'd like to write in my book that you began the meeting.

195
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,910
只要一次
Just once.

196
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,120
马堤尼先生?
Mr. Martini?

197
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,560
你有在听吗?
Are you with us?

198
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,390
是的
Yes.

199
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,000
你要开始讲吗?
Would you like to begin?

200
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,040
契士威克先生呢?
Mr. Cheswick?

201
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,350
-我吗?  -是的
-Me?  -Yes.

202
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,330
这里没有一个人对此有意见吗?
You mean there's not a man here who has an opinion on this matter?

203
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,300
好吧
All right.

204
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,840
哈定先生...
Mr. Harding...

205
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,140
你曾说过你不只一次怀疑...
you've stated on more than one occasion...

206
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,110
你太太在外面偷人
that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.

207
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,170
是的!
Oh, yes!

208
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,680
我非常怀疑她
Yes, very much, I suspect her.

209
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,310
我真的怀疑她
I suspect her.

210
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,970
或许你可以告诉我们  你为何...
Maybe you can tell us why...

211
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,620
怀疑她
you suspect her.

212
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,260
我只能说...
Well, I can only...

213
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,190
那只是推论
speculate as to the reasons why.

214
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,660
你有没有这样推论过  哈定先生...
Have you ever speculated, Mr. Harding...

215
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,400
或许你...
that perhaps you are...

216
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,630
对她失去了耐心...
impatient with your wife...

217
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,770
是因为她没办法达到你的心理要求?
because she doesn't meet your mental requirements?

218
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,470
或许是  但我唯一能够...
Perhaps. But you see, the only thing I can really...

219
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,610
推论的是  瑞秋护士...
speculate on, Nurse Ratched...

220
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,680
不管我老婆...
is the very existence of my life...

221
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,410
是否与我一起生活...
with or without my wife...

222
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,390
在人类的关系中...
in terms of the human relationships, the juxtaposition of...

223
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,020
人与人之间外表与内涵的并容
one person to another, the form, the content.

224
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,760
哈定  不要多说废话  直接讲重点
Harding, why don't you knock off the bullshit and get to the point?

225
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,200
这就是重点
This is the point.

226
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,260
塔波  这不是废话
This is the point, Taber. It's not bullshit.

227
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,770
我不只是在谈我的太太  我是在谈我的生活!
I'm not just talking about my wife, I'm talking about my life!

228
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,770
我不觉得你了解
I can't seem to get that through to you.

229
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,610
我不是在谈一个人
I'm not just talking about one person,

230
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,040
我在谈的跟每个人都有关!
I'm talking about everybody!

231
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,910
我是在谈外表!  我是在谈内涵!
I'm talking about form! I'm talking about content!

232
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,780
我是在谈人际关系!
I'm talking about interrelationships!

233
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,680
我是在谈神  恶魔  地狱  天堂!
I'm talking about God, the Devil, Hell, Heaven!

234
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,950
你懂了吗?
Do you understand? Finally?

235
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,980
哈定  我不敢相信  你真是他妈笨得可以
Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb I can't believe it.

236
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,920
我觉得很奇怪  非常奇怪
It makes me feel very peculiar, very peculiar...

237
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,330
-你说话就像是那个  -什么?
-when you throw in something like that.  -Why?

238
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,260
有什么"奇怪"的  哈定?
What does that mean, "peculiar," Harding?

239
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,270
-奇怪?  -奇怪?
-Peculiar?  -Peculiar?

240
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,130
我告诉过你们
I'm gonna tell you guys something.

241
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,140
你们就是不想学
You just don't want to learn anything.

242
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,140
你们就是不想听别人说话
You just don't want to listen to anybody.

243
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,770
他是有智慧的!
He's got intelligence!

244
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,900
你从来没有听过"奇怪"这个字眼吗?
You've never heard the word "peculiar"?

245
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,450
你到底要说什么?
Say, what are you trying to say?

246
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,450
你说我疯了吗?  是不是?
You trying to say I'm queer? Is that it?

247
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,380
小马利・安?  小玛茱莉・珍?
Little Mary Ann? Little Marjorie Jane?

248
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,480
是这样吗?  你是不是想告诉我这些?
Is that it? Is that what you're trying to tell me?

249
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,920
这就是你所谓的沟通吗?
Is that your idea of communicating something to me? Is it?

250
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,460
是这样吗?
Well, is it?

251
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,690
他们的话题都围绕着你  哈定
They're all crowding in on you, Mr. Harding.

252
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,130
他们的都围着你
They're all ganging up on you.

253
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,530
这是新闻吗?
Is that news?

254
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,870
不...有的时候他们也围攻我  但是我...
They sometimes want to gang up on me, too, but I...

255
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,600
契士威克  帮个忙
Cheswick, do me a favor.

256
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,930
放轻松点
Take it easy.

257
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,730
-不要帮倒忙  -但是我只是...
-And stay off my side.  -But I only wanna...

258
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,540
我只是要帮你
I only wanna help you.

259
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,700
-我懂  -但是你不要我...?
-I understand.  -But don't you want me to...?

260
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,010
-拜托!  -但是我只是要...
-Please!  -But I only want to...

261
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,370
-拜托!  -但是我只是想帮你
-Please!  -But I only want to help you.

262
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,680
拜托!
Please!

263
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,180
你看...
You see...

264
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,150
有一天  你间接暗示  你们两个...
the other day you made some allusions, both of you....

265
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,820
-性幻想?  -是的  是间接
-Illusions?  -Yes, allusions.

266
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,230
不是幻想  间接暗示...
Not illusions. Allusions...

267
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,290
我和我太太之间的性问题
to sexual problems I might be having with my wife.

268
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,880
就算是真的!  就算我知道是真的
All right, let's say it's true! Let's say I know it to be true.

269
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,670
但是你不知道!
But you don't!

270
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,450
如果你是用这种方法告诉我的话
If that's your idea of trying to tell me something,

271
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:16,960
你或许应该...
you have another...

272
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,120
你知道吗哈定
You know, Harding,

273
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,330
我想你是个下贱的混蛋!
I think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something!

274
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,840
-奇怪!  -混蛋
-Peculiar!  -Asshole again.

275
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,310
让你觉得很奇怪的事
It makes you feel peculiar.

276
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,100
我记得你一直在谈你的太太!
You've been talking about your wife ever since I can remember!

277
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,540
她一直存在你的心里...
You know, she's on your mind, and blah, blah, blah...

278
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,870
我不是在谈我的太太!
I'm not talking about my wife!

279
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,240
什么时候你的猪脑才会想通?
When are you gonna get that through your thick fucking head?

280
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,940
你什么时候可以把她放掉?
When are you gonna wise up and turn her loose?

281
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,280
-拜托!  -我不要听!
-Please!  -I don't want to hear it!

282
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,680
-我很累  -我不要听!
-I'm tired.  -I don't want to hear it!

283
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,220

286
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,960
全都是胡说...我很累...
It's a lot of baloney and I'm tired.

287
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,220
我不想听!
I don't want to hear it!

288
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,930
我知道你累了  我们都累了
We know you're tired. We're all tired.

289
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,250
我累是因为这全都是胡说八道
I'm tired and it's a lot of baloney.

290
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,730
巴西尼  你不累
You're not tired, Bancini.

291
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,070
不要碰我  滚开!
Take your hands off me!

292
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,000
自由时间  先生们
Recreation time, gentlemen.

293
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,730
巴士到了
The bus is waiting.

294
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,600
非隔离病患请上巴士
All nonrestricted patients please report to the bus.

295
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,160
玩过这个吗  酋长?
Ever play this game, Chief?

296
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,500
来吧  我来示范
Come on, I'll show you.

297
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,860
这是个老印地安游戏
Old Indian game.

298
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,500
这叫做..."把球放进洞"
It's called "put the ball in the hole."

299
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,870
现在  停在这边
Now, that ought to be just...Hold it right there.

300
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,510
好的
All right.

301
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,780
站在这里不动
Now, that's your spot. Don't move.

302
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,380
绝对不要动  你要站在这里  懂吗?
Never move. That's your spot, you understand?

303
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,750
不要移动  好了...
Right there. You don't move. Now...

304
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,190
拿着球
take the ball.

305
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,090
给  拿着
Here, take the ball.

306
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,060
就是这样抓紧它
That's it. Hold on to it.

307
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,030
不要太紧  酋长  不然你会把气都挤出来
Not too hard, Chief. You'll crush all the air out of it.

308
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,690
现在把它放进篮子里  懂吗?
We're gonna put her in the basket. You understand?

309
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,430
好的  现在举起你的手
All right. Now, raise up your arms.

310
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,140
把球举到空中  举起来
Raise the ball up in the air, Chief. Raise it up.

311
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,180
麦克墨菲?
McMurphy?

312
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,040
你跟他讲什么呢?  他什么都听不到
What the hell are you talking to him for? He can't hear a fucking thing.

313
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,700
我不是在跟他讲话  我只是在自言自语
I ain't talking to him. I'm talking to myself.

314
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,760
这样可以帮助我思考
It helps me think.

315
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,010
那也不能帮助他
Yeah, well, it don't help him none.

316
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,290
这也没差吧  不是吗?
Well, it don't hurt him, either, does it?

317
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,520
酋长  没差吧?
Don't hurt you, does it, Chief?

318
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,720
看吧  没差吧
See? Don't hurt him.

319
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,630
现在  酋长...
All right, now, Chief...

320
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,760
把手举到空中
Let's raise our hands up in the air.

321
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,300
举起来
Just raise them up.

322
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,860
懂吗?
Up, you understand?

323
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,600
举起来
Raise the hands up, here.

324
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,540
把手举起来

All the way up. That's a baby, all right.

327
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,840
好了  现在...
Okay, now...

328
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,950
跳起来放进篮框里  酋长
Now, jump up in the air, and put it in the basket, Chief.

329
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,150
跳起来然后灌篮!
Jump up and dunk it in!

330
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,050
跳起来把球灌下去  酋长
Jump up in the air and stuff that son of a bitch in there, Chief.

331
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,360
休息一下  酋长
Take a rest, Chief.

332
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,550
待在这休息一下  我马上回来

站起来
Stand up. Go ahead.

338
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,710
很乖!  太好了

You didn't make a bet, Martini. I can't hit you. Jesus Christ.

你拿到一张Q  懂吗?
This is a fucking queen here, you understand?

404
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,100
你不能这样算

Do you nuts wanna play cards or you wanna fucking jerk off?

415
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,350
要玩!
Play the game!

416
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,090
我甚至不能听到自己说话
I can't even hear myself think already, here.

417
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,160
到后面排队!
Stay back!

418
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,000
-对不起  我只是要找...  -到后面排队!
-Excuse me, ma'am. I just wanted to...  -Stay back!

419
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,300
病人不可以到护士站来
Patients aren't allowed in the nurses' station.

420
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,070
我只是想要...
Well, I just wanted to turn...

421
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,010
我们可以在外面讨论你的问题
When you're outside, we'll discuss whatever problem you have, okay?

422
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,180
病人不可以来护士站  好吗?
The patients are not allowed in the nurses' station. All right?

423
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,590
比利这是你的  让我插一下好吗?  谢谢
Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on? Thank you.

424
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,820
对不起女士
Excuse me, miss.

425
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,860
可不可以把声音关小一点...
Do you think it might be possible to turn that music down...

426
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,420
我们才可以听到彼此交谈
so maybe a couple of the boys could talk?

427
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,660
音乐是放给大家听的  麦克墨菲先生
That music is for everyone, Mr. McMurphy.

428
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,170
我知道  但是你能不能把它关小一点...
Yeah, I know, but do you think we might ease it down a little bit...

429
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,040
这样我们就不需要吼叫了
so maybe the boys didn't have to shout?

430
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,010
你大概不清楚...
What you probably don't realize...

431
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,910
这里有很多老人...
is that we have a lot of old men on this ward...

432
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,920
如果声音太小他们就听不到
who couldn't hear the music if we turned it lower.

433
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,340
音乐是他们仅有的
That music is all they have.

434
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,180
你的手把窗户弄脏了
Your hand is staining my window.

435
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,850
-对不起  女士  -没关系
-I'm sorry, ma'am.  -All right.

436
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,720
麦克墨菲先生  这是你的药
Mr. McMurphy, your medication.

437
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,000
这到底是什么?
What's in the horse pill?

438
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,800
只是药  对你好的药
It's just medicine. It's good for you.

439
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,410
但是我不喜欢吃
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking something

440
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,240
我不知道的东西
if I don't know what it is.

441
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,470
不要生气  麦克墨菲先生
Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.

442
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,870
我没有生气  毕波小姐
I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.

443
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,440
我只是不喜欢有人喂我吃安眠药
It's just that I don't want anyone to try and slip me saltpeter.

444
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,910
你懂吗?
You know what I mean?

445
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,520
没关系  毕波护士
It's all right, Nurse Pilbow.

446
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,150
如果麦克墨菲先生不想用口服的话...
If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want to take his medication orally...

447
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,210
我想我们可以用别的方法
I'm sure we can arrange that he can have it some other way.

448
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,760
但是我想你不会喜欢的  麦克墨菲先生
But I don't think you'd like it, Mr. McMurphy.

449
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,060
你喜欢  对吧  哈定?
You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?

450
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,500
给我
Give it to me.

451
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,290
非常好
Good.

452
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,910
非常好!
Very good!

453
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,770
真好吃!
Yummy!

454
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,980
哈定先生?
Mr. Harding?

455
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,080
祝福我
Merci.

456
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,990
告诉我  情圣...
Tell me, Lover-boy...

457
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,700
为什么你不骂她呢?
why didn't you tell her to go fuck herself?

458
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,770
我的天啊
Jesus Christ.

459
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,880
很有趣是吧?
Funny, huh? That's funny, huh?

460
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,390
那可不太明智  她可能会看到
you know that wasn't very smart. She could have seen that.

461
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,290
上帝啊  她应付你们就够了
God Almighty, she's got you guys coming and going.

462
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,690
你以为她是万能的吗?
What do you think she is? Some kind of a champ or something?

463
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,930
不  我以为你是万能的
No, I thought you were the champ.

464
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,200
要打赌吗?
You want to bet?

465
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,370
赌什么?
Bet on what?

466
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,360
一个礼拜
One week.

467
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,340
我赌一个礼拜之内  我可以让她发疯...
I bet in one week I can put a bug so far up her ass...

468
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,340
甚至不知道什么时候上厕所  还是手表坏了
she won't know whether to shit or wind her wrist watch.

469
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,240
要打赌吗?  你要赌吗?
What do you say to that? Wanna bet? Do you wanna bet?

470
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,410
我只需要一个礼拜  谁要赌?
One week. That's all I need. Who wants to bet?

471
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,080
你要吗?  一块钱
You wanna bet? Bet a buck. One buck.

472
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,180
我要赌
I'll bet.

473
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,610
好  塔波  一块钱
Tabes in, one buck. Solid.

474
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,590
上一次我们曾讨论过...
Last time we were discussing...

475
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,160
哈定先生和他太太的问题...
Mr. Harding and the problem with his wife...

476
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,990
我想大家都有进步
and I think we were making a lot of progress.

477
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,160
今天谁要开始?
So who would like to begin today?

478
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,940
麦克墨菲先生?
Mr. McMurphy?

479
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,280
我在想你所说的...
I've been thinking about what you said about...

480
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,340
关于一吐心中的郁闷
you know, getting things off your chest.

481
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:56,090
有一些事我不吐不快
Well, there's a couple of things that I'd like to get off my chest.

482
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,990
非常好  麦克墨菲先生  请说
Well, that's very good, Mr. McMurphy. Go ahead.

483
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,890
或许你不知道...
Today, as you may or may not know, it doesn't matter...

484
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,760
今天是世界大赛的开幕赛
is the opening of the World Series.

485
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:12,070
我希望我们能够把工作时间调整到晚上...
What I'd like to suggest is that we change the work detail tonight...

486
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,800
这样我们可以看比赛
so that we can watch the ball game.

487
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,310
麦克墨菲先生  你所要求的...
Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking...

488
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,510
是要我们改变一个非常好的时间表
is that we change a very carefully worked out schedule.

489
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,280
改变一点不会死吧?
A little change never hurt, huh?

490
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,120
一点?
A little variety?

491
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,620
这不是很正确  麦克墨菲先生
Well, it's not necessarily true, Mr. McMurphy.

492
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,900
你知道这里有些人
Some men on the ward

493
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,720
花了很长时间去适应这个时间表
take a long, long time to get used to the schedule.

494
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,560
如果现在改变  会对他们有所干扰
Change it now, and they might find it very disturbing.

495
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,110
去他妈的时间表!
Fuck the schedule!

496
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,390
在大赛之后可以改回来
They can go back to the schedule after the Series.

497
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,340
讨论的是现在的世界大赛  瑞秋护士
I'm talking about the World Series, Nurse Ratched.

498
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,680
现在没有办法
Well, anyway, this is no way to proceed about this.

499
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,140
我们来投票如何...
How would it be if we had a vote...

500
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,880
让多数决定吧?
and let majority rule?

501
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,250
太好了  现在来投吧
Great. Let's vote on her.

502
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,950
希望改的请举手
So, all those in favor raise your hands.

503
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,220
大家拜托
Okay, guys, come on.

504
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,800
举手一下
Put your hands up.

505
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,800
你们到底怎么了?  不想看世界大赛了吗?
What's the matter with you? Don't you want to watch the World Series?

506
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,740
拜托  举手一下...
Come on, get your hands up. It can do you some good...

507
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,070
多做点运动举起手来吧
to get some exercise, putting your arms up in the air.

508
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,810
非常好  拜托  让我们...
That's it. Come on, let's...

509
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,180
这是什么世界?
What is this crap?

510
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,760
我从来没有...我从来没有错过世界大赛
I watch the Series. I haven't missed the Series in years.

511
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,190
甚至是冷天
Even in the cooler.

512
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,660
有一次他们在冷天比赛还发生暴动
When I'm in the cooler they run it there or they'll have a riot.

513
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,130
你们到底怎么回事?  拜托  像个美国人吧!
What's the matter with you guys? Come on, be good Americans!

514
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,540
麦克墨菲先生  我只点到三票  而...
Well, Mr. McMurphy, I only count three votes, and...

515
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,270
那并不足以改变医院规则
that's not enough to change the ward policy.

516
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,240
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

517
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,440
-换我  -来吧
-My turn.  -Okay, hot dice.

518
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,540
我要10...
I want a ten to go...

519
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,650
因为我需要钱
Cause I need cash.

520
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,980
我要去中央大道
I wanna get to Mediterranean Avenue.

521
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,550

Big ten! Perfect.

522
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,850

00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,630
-你在干嘛?  -旅馆

529
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,080

-玩游戏  -为什么你要找我麻烦?
-Play the game.  -What the fuck are you picking on me for?

再碰我一次!

549
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,050
天杀的!
Holy Jesus!

550
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,930
这就是你所谓的时间表?
Is that what your schedule does for you, Hard-on?

551
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,300
你这个该死的疯子!
Damn lunatic!

552
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,530
我不懂你在说些什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

553
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,240
那就这样一直湿吧  哈定
No? Well, then stay all wet, Harding, huh?

554
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,740
因为我要去市中心看世界大赛
Cause I'm going downtown and watch the World Series, anyway.

555
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,340
有人要跟我来吗?
Anybody want to come with me?

556
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,080
我要  我要跟你去!

558
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,020
-去哪里?  -任何一家市中心的酒吧
-Where?  -Any bar downtown.

559
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,420
麦克  你没法...
Mac, you can't...

560
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,720
离开这里
can't get out of here.

561
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,050
要打赌吗?
Anybody want to bet?

562
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,100
胆小鬼!
Chicken shits!

563
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,130
或许只要他脱裤子给瑞秋护士看...
Maybe he'll just show Nurse Ratched his big thing...

564
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,430
她就会帮他开门
and she'll open the door for him.

565
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,040
或许我会...
Yeah, maybe I will...

566
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,610
或许我就用你的头
and then maybe I'll just use your thick skull

567
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,910
在墙上开一个大洞
and knock a hole in the wall.

568
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,680
菲尔  听到没?
Sefelt, see?

569
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,280
我的头就会像茄子一样爆开
Why? My head would squash like an eggplant.

570
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,020
不要管菲尔的头  我才不需要菲尔的头!
Fuck Sefelt's head, I don't need Sefelt's head!

571
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,840
我只要拿这个该死的东西
I'm gonna take this fucking thing,

572
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,770
把它丢出窗外...
I'll put it through the window...

573
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,160
然后我和契士威克会穿过走廊...
and me and my buddy Cheswick are gonna go out through the hall...

574
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,260
到市中心的一个酒吧  坐下后  边吹口哨...
downtown, sit down in a bar, wet our whistles...

575
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,130
边看比赛
and watch the ball game.

576
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,260
这就是赌注  有没有人要参加呢?
And that's the bet. Now, does anybody want any of it?

577
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,540
你要举起那个东西吗?
You're gonna lift that thing?

578
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,310
是的!  没错
Yeah! That's right.

579
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,740
我赌一块钱
I'll bet a buck.

580
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,650
塔波  一块钱
Taber, $1.

581
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,850
我赌十分钱

582
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,250
麦克  你不能...
Mac, you can't...

583
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,820
举起那个东西
can't lift that thing.

584
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,860
还有人要赌吗  哈定?
Anybody else want any of it? Hard-on?

585
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,130
我赌二十五块!
I'll bet $25!

586
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,200
二十五块钱  哈定!
$25, Hard-on!

587
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,000
麦克  没有人能举得起那个东西
Mac, nobody could ever lift that thing.

588
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,370
走开  你在吸我的氧气
Get out of my way, son. You're using my oxygen.

589
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,930
懂吗?
You know what I mean?

590
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,320
放弃了吗?
Giving up?

591
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,630
没有!  只是在热身

热身

这次是真的
This will be the one.

594
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,600
来吧  宝贝
All right, baby.

595
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,520
我试过了  对吧?  该死!
But I tried, didn't I? Goddammit!

596
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,180
至少我试过了

在投手丘上是左投手艾尔邓宁

在我们下面有两个投手在热身

你有没有告诉那女孩你的感觉?

602
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,960
我去她的家...

603
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,270
在礼拜天下午...

我买了一些花...

605

我爱上了她

611

你妈妈说你从来没有提过

为什么你没有跟她说?

那就是你第一次自杀吗?
Wasn't that the first time you tried to commit suicide?

616

比利不想提起...
Billy doesn't feel like talking...

623
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,840
我是说...你为什么要逼他?
I mean, why are you pressing him?

624
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,450
为什么我们不能谈点新的话题?
Why can't we go on to some new business?

00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,540
我从来没有去看过棒球比赛...

我很想去看

That would be good therapy, too, wouldn't it, Miss Ratched?

我想昨天我们已经提过了
I thought we'd decided that issue.

636

我不是这样想的  我的意思是...
I don't think so, because, I mean...

昨天是讨论过...

00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,790
但是今天又有新的比赛  对不对  麦克?
and we have a new game today, I think, don't we, Mac?

639
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,640
对  契士  我们要重新投票  对吧?
That's right, Ches, and we want a new vote on it, don't we?

640
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,470
麦克墨菲先生  再投一次票  你就满足了吗?
Would one more vote satisfy you, Mr. McMurphy?

641
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,170

646
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,500
你们这些疯子到底有没有种?
Which one of you nuts has got any guts?

647
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,760
太好了  就是这样!
All right. That's it!

648

你们可以把手放下来了
So you gentlemen can put your hands down.

653
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,890
你是说连这些狗娘养的都要算进去?
Are you trying to tell me that you're gonna count these?

654
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:04,370
他们甚至不知道我们在讲什么
These poor sons of bitches, they don't know what we're talking about.

655
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,440
我不同意  麦克墨菲先生
Well, I have to disagree with you, Mr. McMurphy.

656
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,500
这些人跟你一样都是医院一员
These men are members of the ward, just as you are.

657
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,920

Come on, there's got to be one guy here that's not a total fucking nut!

711

麦克墨菲先生...

When the meeting was adjourned, the vote was nine to nine.

717
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,790
拜托  你不能这样讲!
Come on, you're not gonna say that now!

718
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,490
你现在不能这样讲!
You're not gonna say that now!

719
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,590
你不可以这样混蛋...
You're gonna pull that henhouse shit, now, when the vote...

722
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,190
寇菲斯...

723
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,960
寇菲斯打了出去  球往外野方向飞去
Koufax kicks. He delivers.

724
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,730
肯定是安打
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.

725
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,900
理查德森跑到一垒!  向二垒跑去!

726
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,410

He's in there, Martini! Look at Richardson, he's on second base.

731
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,380
寇菲斯有了大麻烦!
Koufax is in big fucking trouble! Big trouble, baby!

All right, here's Tresh. He's the next batter!

733
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,450
崔斯进场  寇菲斯...
Tresh looks in. Koufax...

734
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,450
寇菲斯接到罗斯波洛的暗号!
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro!

735
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,930

736
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,690
好球!
It's a strike!

737
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,800
寇菲斯的曲球真是厉害
Koufax's curve ball is snapping off like a fucking firecracker.

738
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,530

Tresh swings! It's a long fly ball to deep left center!

740
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,070
还在飞!  中了!
It's going! It's gone!

741
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:30,180
快给我一个热狗
Somebody give me a fucking wiener before I die.

742
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,980
现在是伟大的麦奇・曼顿上场!  投手投了出去!
It's the great Mickey Mantle, now! Here comes the pitch!

743
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,290

745
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,390
请停止这种行为
Gentlemen, stop this.

746
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,130
请马上停止
Stop this immediately.

747
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,970
你喜欢这里吗?
Do you like it here?

748
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,320
那个混蛋的护士!
That fucking nurse, man!

749
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,580
这是什么意思?
What do you mean, sir?

750
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,860
她不守信用
She ain't honest.

751
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:24,370
瑞秋小姐是这个机构最好的护士之一
Miss Ratched's one of the finest nurses we've got in this institution.

752
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,670
我不想这样说...
Well, I don't wanna break up the meeting or nothing...

753
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,650
但她真的很讨厌  是吧医生?
but she's something of a cunt, ain't she, Doc?

754
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,810
什么意思?
How do you mean that?

755
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:40,080
她常常欺骗  你懂吗?
She likes a rigged game, you know what I mean?

756
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:50,120
你知道吗?  我观察你...
Well, you know, I've been observing you here now...

757
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,200
已经四个礼拜了...
for the last four weeks...

758
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,240
但是我看不出有任何精神病的征兆
and I don't see any evidence of mental illness, at all.

759
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,770
我想你一直在耍我们
I think that you've been trying to put us on, all this time.

760
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:04,070
那你要我怎么做?
You know, what do you want me to do? You know.

761
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,650
是不是像这样?
You know what I mean? Is that it?

762
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,740
这够不够疯?
Is that crazy enough for you?

763
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,720
要我大便在地上吗?  拜托!
Want me to take a shit on the floor? Christ!

764
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:18,320
你有没有听过一句俗话"滚石不生苔"?
Have you ever heard the old saying, "A rolling stone gathers no moss"?

765
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:20,960
有啊
Yeah.

766
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,560
对你有任何意义吗?
Does that mean something to you?

767
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:33,170
这跟"不要在公共场合洗内衣裤"是一样道理
It's the same as "Don't wash your dirty underwear in public."

768
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,710
我听不懂你在说什么
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

769
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,020
我比他还聪明  对吧?
I'm smarter than him, ain't I?

770
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,820
这大概都是这样解释的...
Well, that sort of has always meant...

771
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,560
移动的东西很难长东西
it's hard for something to grow on something that's moving.

772
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,990
你对昨天发生的事有什么感想?
How did you feel about what happened yesterday?

773
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,770
我想要杀掉...
I want to kill...I mean...

774
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,080
你们还有问题要问吗?
Do you gentlemen have any more questions?

775
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,190
我没有问题了  但是你大概有
I don't have any more, but perhaps you do.

776
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,380
你想问问题吗  麦克墨菲?
Do you have a question, McMurphy?

777
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,250
你猜她住在哪里?
Where do you suppose she lives?

778
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,190
酋长  跟我来
Chief, come on with me.

779
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,660
我们要告诉他们  谁才是真正的疯子
We'll show these guys who's nuts.

780
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,900
好了 等等
All right, wait.

781
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,000
站在这边
Stand right here.

782
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,170
好  抓住栏杆
All right. Grab the fence.

783
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:14,130
抓住栏杆这
Grab the fence here.

784
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,610
酋长  用力!
Right here, Chief. Strong!

785
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,410
用力  像这样
Strong, like this, here.

786
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,920
就是这样  太好了
That's it. All right.

787
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,450
好了  站直
Okay. Up.

788
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,650
你做到了
That's it.

789
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,460
这只手
Fine, you got it.

790
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,260
对  现在...推!
All right, push!

791
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,440

Come on, Bob!

792
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,080
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

793
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,180
小声点  继续走
Don't breathe on me, Club. Keep moving. Keep moving.

794
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,460

Come on, you guys. Get the lead out, huh?

795

Hey, wait a minute! What the heck is going on here?

812
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,200
你们在船上干嘛?
What are you doing on this boat?

813
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,000
我们要去钓鱼
We're going fishing.

814
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,470
你们不可以去钓鱼
No, you're not going fishing.

815
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,840
这艘不行  你们不能用这艘去钓鱼
Not on this boat. You're not going fishing on this boat.

816
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,410
就是这艘船  去问布拉克船长

865
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:37,390
现在我们要拿这些小鱼做什么?
Now what are we gonna do with these little fishes?

866
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:43,320
-捉大鱼  -没错  马堤尼先生
-Catch big fishes.  -That's right. That's right, Mr. Martini.

868
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,290
鱼钩
Hooks.

869
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,170
拿好自己的鱼钩...

870
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,440
现在要放鱼饵

好了  现在我们每人都有一条鱼
All right, now we each one of us has got a fish.

875
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,750
你在笑什么  马堤尼?
What are you laughing at, Martini?

876
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,550
你不是笨蛋了吗?
You're not an idiot, huh?

877
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,890
你不是该死的疯子了  现在你是一个渔夫
You're not a goddamn looney now, boy, you're a fisherman.

878
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,130
现在  拿着鱼钩的底部
Now, take your bottom hook.

879
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,530
懂了吗?
You got it?

880
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:24,300
你拿着鱼钩...
You take it...

881
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,330
然后...
and you...

882
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:29,300
把它完全穿过鱼
push it all the way through.

883
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,840
像这样
Like that.

884
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:33,940
等一下  是穿过眼睛
Wait a second. Get it through the eyes, here.

885
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,550
-完全穿过这条鱼  -眼睛吗?
-Right through here.  -In the eye?

886
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:38,050
不要担心这个!  这是条死鱼  马堤尼
Don't worry about it! He's dead, Martini.

887
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,350
从眼球这边穿过去  这里
Jesus Christ, just put it through his eyeball, here.

888
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:42,980
就是这样
That's it.

889
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:46,490
穿过它  没错  你做到了
Crunch it right through. All right. Now you got it, see?

890
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,760
完全穿过这条鱼  懂吗?
Now, you just pull that baby through. You see what I mean?

891
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,270
然后你就像绕线圈一样缠绕
And you wrap it around. You pull this so it's a little loop.

892
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,530
非常好
That's very good.

893
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,830

做得不错
Good eye work.

896
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:03,740
它根本不会有任何感觉的  懂吗?
That little devil's gonna not even feel the sting, is he, boy?

897
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:07,050
那个狗娘养的一定会上钩  对吧?
That son of a gun is gonna bite on you, isn't he?

898
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:12,150

904
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,280

Don't call me unless you get something really big...

913
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:22,790
你无法处理
you can't handle yourselves.

914
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,460
继续钓你们的鱼!
Keep on fishing!

915

闭嘴!
Shut up!

930
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:02,020
他说要走直线向箭一样直
He said to go straight out as an arrow.

931
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,860
可是你没有  你好像...
You're not going straight, you're kind of...

932
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:08,260
我是在走直线  现在契士  不要这样!
I'm going straight enough. Now, Chessy, stop it!

933
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,930

01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:12,730
安全回家了  没走失任何一个!
Home safe and sound. Didn't lose a nut!

943
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,990
比保龄球还好玩  你知道我的意思吧?
Beach bowling, you know what I mean?

944
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,560
我们钓到了!
We caught it, look!

945
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,630
他们要花六个月的时间来找尸体!
They're gonna be trolling this place for six months looking for dead bodies!

946
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,610
我认为他是危险人物
I think he's dangerous.

947
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,440
他没有疯...
He's not crazy...

948
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:36,540
但是他很危险
but he's dangerous.

949
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,290
你不认为他疯了吗?
You don't think he's crazy?

桑吉医生呢?
Dr. Songee?

952
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:47,130
我想他不是个完全的精神病患
I don't think he's overly psychotic.

953
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,630
但他还是有病
But I still think he's quite sick.

954
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,860
-你认为他危险吗?  -绝对危险
-Do you think he's dangerous?  -Absolutely so.

955
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:59,400
约翰  你要怎么处理他?
Well, John, what do you want to do with him?

956
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,750
我想我们已经尽力了
I think we've had our turn.

957
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:09,650
我认为应该把他送回劳动农场
I'd like to send him back to the work farm, frankly.

958
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,360
有没有人...
Is there anybody that you have...

959
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,680
你的工作人员  可以...
on your staff, that could...

960
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,550
跟他沟通?  或许了解他
relate to him? Maybe understand him.

961
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:22,230
帮助他解决这些问题?
Help him out with some of these problems?

962
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,760
有趣的是他认识的人...
Well, the funny thing is that the person that he's the closest to...

963
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,970
却是他最讨厌的
is the one he dislikes the most.

964
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:30,500
梅儿德  就是你
That's you, Mildred.

965
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,790
先生们  我的意见是
Well, gentlemen, in my opinion,

966
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:35,040
如果我们把他送回潘德特...
if we send him back to Pendleton or...

967
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,140
或是把他送回监狱...
we send him up to Disturbed...

968
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,410
只是另一种逃避责任的做法而已
it's just one more way of passing on our problem to somebody else.

969
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,920
我们不会这样做
You know, we don't like to do that.

970
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,120
所以我希望能让他留在医院里
So I'd like to keep him on the ward.

971
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:53,530
我想我们可以帮助他
I think we can help him.

972
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:01,200
酋长...来
Chief, Chief, come on.

973
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,010
跟我来
Come with me, huh?

974
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,100
酋长  就是这个点
Chief, this is the spot.

975
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,810
就是这个点  记得吗?
Right there is the spot. Remember?

976
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,480
举起手来  把球放进去
Raise the hands, in the basket.

977
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,710
就是这样举起手来
That's it. Raise the hands up.

978
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:19,290
来吧!  疯子们  来打球吧!
All right! Let's have a little ball from you nuts in here! Here we go!

979
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,850
开始吧!  疯子们  让我们来玩球!
All right! Let's play some ball, nuts.

980
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,290
让我们动起来!
Let's make some moves!

981
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,920
麦克...暂停...
Hey, Mac, Mac. Time, time, time.

982
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,900
你有六个人在场上
You got six men on the court.

983
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:30,630
好吧  哈定离场
Harding, out of the ball game.

984
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:33,370
为什么是我呢?
Hey, why me?

985
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,970
因为我是教练  等一下再让你上场
Because I'm the coach. I'll put you in later.

986
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,480
我不相信你
I don't trust you.

987
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,010
麦克...我走
Mac... I'll go.

988
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,750
好孩子  比利  等一下让你进场
Okay, good boy, Billy. I'll put you in in a minute, all right?

989
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,490
好了  开始吧  哈定快攻
All right, let's play ball. Harding, break over.

990
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,150
马堤尼  传回来  传回来!
All right, Martini, get it back. Back!

991
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,920
没有人看我!  你在干嘛?
I'm in the open! What are you doing?

992
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,020
你把球丢往栏杆干嘛!
You threw the goddamn ball into the fence!

993
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,660
我的天啊  你把球丢向栏杆!
Christ Almighty, you threw the ball into the fence!

994
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:01,000
那边没有人!  我们在比赛!
There's nobody there! We're playing ball!

995
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:02,530
快点继续进行
All right, come on, get in the game.

996
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,060
防守  大家都要尽力!
Defense, nobody's doing nothing here!

997
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:08,000
-看在上帝的份上!  -麦克  没人防我!
-For Christ's sake!  -Hey, Mac, I'm open! I'm open!

998
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,770
哈定传回来  传回来给我  哈定!  这里
All right, Harding, give it back. Back to me, Harding! Here.

999
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,870
哈定  没人防我  传给我
I'm open. Harding, will you give me the ball?

1000
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:15,240
-不要再运球了  真该死!  -我拿到了!
-Stop dribbling the goddamn ball!  -I got it!

1001
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,840
哈定  这边
Harding, over here.

1002
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:19,850
该死  我站在...
Oh, for Christ's sake. I'm standing...

1003
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,390
-你们都被防着!  -没人守我!
-You were covered!  -I was open!

1004
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:24,080
-给我球啊  -他们全都在...
-Just give me the ball. -They're making all over the...

1005
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:26,260
没人守我  球给我
I was open. Give me the ball.

1006
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:28,120
有人守你  麦克
You were covered, Mac.

1007
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,430
没有人守我  来人接球啊!
I wasn't covered. Somebody get back!

1008
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,590
把球给我!  给我!
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1009
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,860
酋长!  太棒了  放进去!
Chief! Thatta baby, put it in!

1010
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,930
过去那边!
Get down there!

1011
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:51,080
过去那里  酋长!  太好了.
Get down there, Chief! All right, all right.

1012
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,580
绕过去  酋长!
Get around, Chief!

1013
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,750
不对  是那边  酋长!
No, no, no. Get down there, Chief!

1014
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,330
比赛继续进行!
The ball's in play! Ball's in play!

1015
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,470
去你妈的  你一定疯了
Oh, fuck that shit! You got to be crazy.

1016
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:13,070
-没人防守!  -比赛继续进行!
-Man, that doesn't go!  -Get that ball in play!

1017
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:17,510
酋长  投篮!
Come on, Chief. Put it in!

1018
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:28,880
打得真好!
What a ball club!

1019
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,720
麦克墨菲  不要靠着墙
McMurphy, get off the side.

1020
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:03,250
-走开!  -该死!
-Come on, move it, man!  -Hey, dammit!

1021
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,480
来啊
Quick! Come on, go ahead.

1022
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:08,830
来啊
Go ahead.

1023
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:11,960
打下去啊
Go ahead.

1024
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:15,900
总有一天我会在外面见到你  你懂我意思吧?
I'll be seeing you on the outside. You know what I mean?

1025
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:19,030
到那一天...
By the time you get out of here...

1026
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,340
你会老到不能动
you'll be too old to even get it up.

1027
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:23,470
68天  小子
Sixty-eight days, buddy.

1028
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,400
68天
Sixty-eight days.

1029
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,340
你都不知道你在说什么吧  68天?
What the fuck you talking about, 68 days?

1030
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,320
那是服刑
That's in jail, sucker.

1031
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,480
你还是不知道你在那里  是吧?
You still don't know where you're at?

1032
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:36,520
我会是在哪里  华盛顿?
Yeah, where am I at, Washington?

1033
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:38,690
跟我们在一起
With us, baby, you're with us.

1034
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:42,060
你会待到我们释放你
And you're gonna stay with us until we let you go.

1035
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:53,830
你对这组有话要说吗  麦克墨菲?
Do you want to say something to the group, Mr. McMurphy?

1036
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:03,510
我想知道为什么没有人告诉我...
I'd like to know why none of the guys never told me that you...

1037
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,920
必须经过你瑞秋护士...
Miss Ratched...

1038
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,150
还有医生的准许
and the doctors could keep me here

1039
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:10,660
才能释放呢
till you're good and ready to turn me loose.

1040
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,030
我想知道这件事
That's what I'd like to know.

1041
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:16,630
很好  蓝道  这是个好的开始
Fine, Randall, that's a good start.

1042
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,960
有没有人可以回答麦克墨菲先生的问题?
Would anyone care to answer Mr. McMurphy?

1043
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:23,730
回答什么?
Answer what?

1044
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:25,830
你听到了  哈定
You heard me, Harding.

1045
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,740
你让我去骚扰瑞秋护士...
You let me go on hassling Nurse Ratched here...

1046
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:32,340
而却不告诉我该如何被释放!
knowing how much I had to lose and you never told me nothing!

1047
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,640
麦克  等一下
Now, Mac, wait a minute.

1048
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:37,370
我也不清楚...
Wait a minute, I didn't know anything about how much...

1049
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:39,480
-屁话!  -等一下
-Shit!  -Wait a minute. Listen.

1050
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:41,320
听着...
Now, look...

1051
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:43,880
我是自愿进来  我并没有犯罪
I'm voluntary here, see? I'm not committed.

1052
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:49,750
我不需要待在这里  我是说我可以随时回家
I don't have to stay here. I mean, I can go home anytime I want.

1053
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:53,160
你可以随时回家?
You can go home anytime you want?

1054
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,630
-没错  -你在耍我!
-That's it.  -You're bullshitting me!

1055
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,010
他在耍我  对吧?
He's bullshitting me, right?

1056
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:00,800
不  蓝道  他说的是实话
No, Randall, he's telling you the truth.

1057
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:06,040
事实上有很多人是罪犯
As a matter of fact, there are very few men here who are committed.

1058
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:08,040
譬如  布鲁登先生
There's Mr. Bromden.

1059
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,950
塔波先生
Mr. Taber.

1060
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,880
再加上你
Some of the chronics, and you.

1061
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,060
契士威克?
Cheswick?

1062
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,590
你是自愿进来的吗?
You're voluntary?

1063
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:30,130
史肯隆?
Scanlon?

1064
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,400
比利  看在老天的份上  你一定是罪犯  对吧?
Billy, for Christ's sake, you must be committed, right?

1065
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:39,270
不...
No, no, no...

1066
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:45,250
你还很年轻!
You're just a young kid!

1067
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,410
在这里干嘛?  你应该到外面去...
What are you doing here? You ought to be out in a convertible...

1068
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:50,480
溜鸟  约会  找乐子
bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.

1069
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,050
你在这里干嘛?
What are you doing here, for Christ's sake?

1070
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:54,960
这有什么好笑?
What's so funny about that?

1071
01:12:56,570 --> 01:13:00,060
我是说你们一直抱怨这个地方...
Jesus, I mean, you guys do nothing but complain about how you can't...

1072
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,830
但是你们没有勇气走出这里
stand it in this place here, and then you haven't got the guts to walk out?

1073
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:07,430
你们以为你们是疯子吗?
What do you think you are, for Christ's sake? Crazy or something?

1074
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,610
你们不是!
Well, you're not. You're not!

1075
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,350
你们跟街上的混蛋
You're no crazier than the average asshole

1076
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,050
没有什么两样
out walking around on the streets.

1077
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,420
就是这样
And that's it.

1078
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,780
我的天啊  我真不敢相信!
Jesus Christ, I can't believe it!

1079
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,460
这是个很好的挑战  蓝道
Those are very challenging observations you made, Randall.

1080
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:33,190
我相信有人会想对此提出意见
I'm sure some of the men would like to comment.

1081
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,370
史肯隆?
Mr. Scanlon?

1082
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:42,460
我想要知道为什么宿舍在白天和周末
I want to know why the dorm is locked

1083
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,670
要锁起来
in the daytime and on weekends.

1084
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,810
我想要知道关于香烟
I would like to know about our cigarettes.

1085
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,790
瑞秋小姐  可不可以给我烟  拜托
May I have my cigarettes, please, Miss Ratched?

1086
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:01,890
坐下  契士威克先生  等轮到你再说话
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick, and wait your turn.

1087
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,000
快点坐下!
Go ahead, sit down!

1088
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:18,070
关于宿舍的问题  史肯隆先生...
To answer your question about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon...

1089
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,010
你知道...
You know very well...

1090
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:21,410
如果不锁门的话
that if we left the door open,

1091
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:24,580
你们会在早餐之后又回去睡觉
you'd just go right back to bed after breakfast.

1092
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,050
对吧?
Am I right?

1093
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,750
那又怎么样?
So what?

1094
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,390
瑞秋小姐  可不可以给我香烟?
May I have my cigarettes, please, Miss Ratched?

1095
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,190
不要管香烟了  契士威克
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.

1096
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,990
这不是很重要的  坐下  好吗?
Cigarettes are not important. Sit down, will you?

1097
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,460
天啊!
For Christ's sake!

1098
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,060
香烟!
Cigarettes!

1099
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:48,330
记得吗  史肯隆先生  我们讨论过很多次...
Remember, Mr. Scanlon, we've discussed many times...

1100
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:52,440
跟别人生活在一起  有助于治疗的效果
that time spent in the company of others is very therapeutic.

1101
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:57,280
一个人生活会有疏离感
While time spent brooding alone only increases a feeling of separation.

1102
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,520
你记得  对吧?
You remember that, don't you?

1103
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:01,150
你是说...
Do you mean to say...

1104
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,520
单独待着就是病?
it's sick to want to be off by yourself?

1105
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:05,890
瑞秋小姐?
Miss Ratched?

1106
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:10,790
契士威克先生  你坐下!
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down!

1107
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:13,340
-但是我想知道...  -坐下  契士威克
-Yes, but I want to know about...  -Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.

1108
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:14,670
我想要..
I want to...

1109
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,600
给他一根香烟吧哈定
Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?

1110
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,230
这是我最后一枝
It's my last one.

1111
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:23,310
你在说谎  为什么你不给他一枝香烟呢?
That's a fucking lie. Why don't you give him a cigarette?

1112
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:25,870
我不是做慈善的
Look, I'm not running a charity ward, see?

1113
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:27,180
拜托!
Come on!

1114
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,520
听着  我不想要他的烟
Look, I don't want his cigarettes.

1115
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,350
我也不想要他的  他的  或是他的...
And I don't want his, or his, or his...

1116
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:35,620
或是他的  他的  还有他的...
or his, or his, or his...

1117
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,520
甚至是你的
Or even yours.

1118
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,290
你懂吗?
Do you understand that?

1119
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:42,190
我要我的烟  瑞秋小姐!
I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched!

1120
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:44,460
我要我的烟!
I want my cigarettes!

1121
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:47,100
我要我的烟  瑞秋小姐!
I want mine, Miss Ratched!

1122
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:49,500
你有什么权利...
What gives you the damn right...

1123
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,300
去把我们的烟扣留下来摆在你的桌上...
to keep our cigarettes piled up on your desk...

1124
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:57,180
当你高兴的时候才会发一包?
and to squeeze out a pack only when you feel like it, huh?

1125
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,580
-瑞秋小姐!  -哈定先生!
-Miss Ratched!  -Mr. Harding!

1126
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,750
抱歉...
Oh, I'm sorry...

1127
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:06,720
你让我感到惊讶
You surprise me.

1128
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,520
我只是一时失去理智  很抱歉
I lost my head. I'm sorry.

1129
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,350
我不是故意的...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

1130
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:12,760
真的很抱歉  我忘了
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1131
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:15,860
我不是故意的  真的很抱歉  只是忘了
I didn't mean to. I'm really very sorry. Just forgot.

1132
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:17,430
没关系
It's all right.

1133
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,330
瑞秋小姐!
Miss Ratched!

1134
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:21,700
契士威克先生干嘛?
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

1135
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:24,200
我在问你问题!
I asked you a question!

1136
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,070
我听到你的问题了  契士威克先生...
I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick...

1137
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:31,370
只要安静下来  我就会回答你的问题
and I will answer your question as soon as you've calmed down.

1138
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,940
安静下来了吗  契士威克先生?
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?

1139
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,180
-是的  -很好
-I'm calm.  -Good.

1140
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:45,390
你们都知道麦克墨菲先生...
Now, as you all know, Mr. McMurphy...

1141
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:48,900
在这里开了一家小型赌场
has been running a small gambling casino in our tub room.

1142
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,430
你们大部份的烟都输给了麦克墨菲先生...
Now, most of you lost all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...

1143
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,370
再加上小额的金钱
not to mention a tidy sum of money to Mr. McMurphy.

1144
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:00,210
所以这就是为什么...
And that's why...

1145
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:03,310
你们的福利被暂停了...
your tub room privileges have been suspended...

1146
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,440
而你们的烟则受到管制
and your cigarettes have been rationed.

1147
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:11,250
马堤尼先生?
Mr. Martini?

1148
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,560
我们如何把我们的钱赢回来?
How are we gonna win our money back?

1149
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,460
你不可能把钱赢回来  马堤尼先生
You're not going to win your money back, Mr. Martini.

1150
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:25,030
已经不可能了
That's all over.

1151
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:27,760
若你们一开始就遵守规则的话...
If you had obeyed the rules in the first place...

1152
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,100
就不会输掉你们的钱
you wouldn't have lost your money.

1153
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:42,720
坐下  大家坐下!  先生们!  坐下!
Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down!

1154
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,490
规则?
Rules?

1155
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:53,360
去你妈的规则  瑞秋小姐!
Piss on your fucking rules, Miss Ratched!

1156
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:54,860
你坐下  契士威克?
Sit down, will you, Cheswick?

1157
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,900
我要慎重的告诉你一件事  瑞秋小姐!
I want you to know something right here and now, Miss Ratched!

1158
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:01,300
-不要把我当小孩子!  -你坐下!
-I ain't no little kid! I ain't no little kid!  -You sit down!

1159
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,600
你一直控制我的烟  像是控制小孩的饼干...
When you're gonna have cigarettes kept from me like cookies...

1160
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,270
我要现在解决这件事!  对不对麦克?
And I want something done! Ain't that right, Mac?

1161
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,940
没错!  你能不能先坐下?
That's right! Will you sit down?

1162
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,450
不  我不坐!
No, I won't! I won't!

1163
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,580
我要现在解决!
I want something done!

1164
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:15,880
-坐下!  -我要现在解决!
-Sit down!  -I want something done!

1165
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,940
我要现在解决!
I want something done!

1166
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,450
我要现在解决!
I want something done!

1167
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,690
我要现在解决!
I want something done!

1168
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,960
我要现在解决!
I want something done!

1169
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:28,020
-拿去!  -我要现在解决!
-Here!  -I want something done!

1170
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,960
该死  契士威克  给你!
Goddamn it, Cheswick, here!

1171
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,800
安静下来!
Hey, calm down!

1172
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:35,740
你能不能不要烦他?  华盛顿  他会安静的!
Why don't you leave him alone, Washington? He's gonna be all right!

1173
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:46,310
紧急情况...
Emergency...

1174
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,450
34B
34-B.

1175
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,680
我要打断你的脖子!
I'll break your fucking back!

1176
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,690
不要挣扎了  麦克!  已经结束了  麦克墨菲!
Forget it, Mac! It's all over, McMurphy!

1177
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:06,400
渥伦!
Warren!

1178
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,810
能不能让一下?  我们需要这张椅子
Would you move, please? We need this chair.

1179
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,970
坐到那边去就好了
Just move right over there, okay.

1180
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:58,390
伯尔登先生又回来了
I see we have Mr. Bromden back. Yeah, okay.

1181
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,960
-麦克墨菲先生  你还好吗?  -我很好
-How do you do, Mr. McMurphy?  -I do real fine.

1182
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:07,930
我知道你没有做错事
I know you didn't do anything wrong. Just sit down.

1183
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,160
我们不会伤害你的  先坐下
We're not going to hurt you. Sit down, right here.

1184
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,290
就是这样
That's it.

1185
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:13,900
护士  这是契士威克先生  他余怒未息
Nurse, this is Mr. Cheswick. He's a little upset.

1186
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,170
非常感谢你
Okay, fine. Thank you very much.

-You'll be okay, Mr. Cheswick.  -Yes.

1188
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,150
你能不能看住这三个?
Would you keep an eye on these two?

1189
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:14,530
先生们  吃药吧
Would you please take these, gentlemen?

1190
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,700
他听不见
He can't hear nothing.

1191
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,800
安静下来  契士  好吗?
Calm down, Ches, will you?

1192
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,310
契士威克先生  请跟我来
Mr. Cheswick, would you please follow me?

1193
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,620
契士威克先生?

1196
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:46,320

You're all right. No one's gonna hurt you.

1197

不  让我一个人待着!
No, leave me alone!

1198

1203
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,670
我没有做错事!
I didn't do nothing!

1204
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,180
麦克!
Mac!

1205

-Come on.  -I won't go! I don't want to go!

1206
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,770
要口香糖吗?
Want some gum?

1207
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,250
谢谢
Thank you.

1208
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,300
果汁口味
Juicy Fruit.

1209
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,410
你这个超级大混蛋  酋长
You sly son of a bitch, Chief.

1210
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:12,150
你可以听到  对吧?
Can you hear me, too?

1211
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,080
当然!
Yeah, you bet!

1212
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:17,450
我真该死  酋长!
Well, I'll be goddamned, Chief!

1213
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,160
他们一直以为你是又笨又聋的
And they all, they all think you're deaf and dumb.

1214
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:27,190
我的老天啊!
Jesus Christ!

1215
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,500
你愚弄他们的  酋长
You fooled them, Chief.

1216
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:33,700
你把他们全部骗得团团转!
You fooled them. You fooled them all!

1217
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,110
该死的!
Goddamn you!

1218
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,540
我们在这里干嘛  酋长?
What are we doing in here, Chief?

1219
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:46,590
我们在这个该死的地方干嘛?
What's us, two guys, doing in this fucking place?

1220
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,990
我们离开这里吧...
Let's get out of here...

1221
01:23:57,730 --> 01:23:58,760
出去
Out.

1222
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:05,000
去加拿大?
Canada?

1223
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,270
加拿大
Canada.

1224
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:11,300
在那些人渣发现以前  我们早就跑了
We'll be there before these sons of bitches know what hit them.

1225
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,650
听我这一次
Listen to Randall on this one.

1226
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,400
麦克墨菲先生?
Mr. McMurphy?

1227
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,340
请跟我来
Please follow me.

1228
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,680
就你跟我  酋长
You and me, Chief.

1229
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,530
现在是休息时间  放轻松点
Take a cigarette break, boys. Easy.

1230
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,660
这样就好了
I'll be fine.

1231
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,000
请坐起来
Would you sit up, please?

1232
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,840
-乐意之至  -非常好
-I'd love to.  -Thatta boy.

1233
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:22,850
鞋子上可能会湿湿的  懂我意思吗?
There might be a little fluid in them boots, you know what I mean, boys?

1234
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,410
只是尿了一点
Just a little leak.

1235
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,780
会满亮的...
A light shine, boys, and...

1236
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:29,250
把样品送给瑞秋小姐
send the specimen to Nurse Ratched.

1237
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:40,100
把口香糖吐出来...
All right, out with your gum...

1238
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,760
把口香糖吐出来
Out with your gum.

1239
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:49,340
这不会痛  一下就过去了
Okay, this won't hurt, and it'll be over in just a moment.

1240
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,410
-那是什么?  -导电膏
-What's that?  -Conductant.

1241
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,710
一点就够了
A little dab will do you.

1242
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,810
对吧  杰克森先生?
Right, Mr. Jackson?

1243
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,150
张开嘴...
Open your mouth...

1244
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:01,880
-这是什么?  -是防止你咬到舌头...
-What's that?  -This'll keep you from biting your tongue...

1245
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,650
咬紧它
Now just bite down on it.

1246
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:06,450
就是这样  咬紧它
That's right. Just bite down.

1247
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,050
咬紧
Now, bite down on it.

1248
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:16,030
准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

1249
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,670
开始了
Here we go.

1250
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:53,700
深呼吸
Now, one big breath.

1251
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:00,080
非常好
Very good.

1252
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:06,950
大家现在开始吧  不会很久的
Gentlemen, I'd like to begin today. It shouldn't take too long.

1253
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,420
吉姆?
Jim?

1254
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,560
据我所知...
It's been brought to my attention...

1255
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:15,930
你把你的药给了佛兰迪克森先生
that you've been giving Mr. Fredrickson your medication.

1256
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:17,630
是真的吗?
Is that true?

1257
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,670
没有
No, ma'am.

1258
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,230
吉姆?
Jim?

1259
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:30,840
你到底有没有把你的药给佛兰迪克森先生...
Are you giving your medication to Mr. Fredrickson...

1260
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,750
有没有?
or are you not?

1261
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,850
你们这些人渣  疯子  神经病
How about it, you creeps, you lunatics, mental defectives.

1262
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,440
吹牛大王兰道尔重新登场
Let's hear it for Bullgoose Randall, back in action.

1263
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,050
很漂亮的衬衫
Nice shirt, Cheseroo.

1264
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,230
看看你们的脸!
Look at the faces on you!

1265
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:22,290
看看!
Look at you!

1266
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,890
真是丑恶
The feeb's brigade, you ding-a-lings?

1267
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:29,470
神经病联盟又在一起了
The mental defective league in formation.

1268
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:34,070
你好吗  瑞秋护士?  很高兴回来
How are you, Nurse Ratched? I'm happy to be back.

1269
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,980
我们很高兴你回来  兰道尔
We're happy to have you back, Randall.

1270
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,370
谢谢
Thank you.

1271
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:42,980
你今天要休息还是要加入我们?
Would you like to rest today, or would you like to join the group?

1272
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:46,210
我很乐意加入大家...
I'd love to join the group...

1273
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:47,780
很乐意...
I'd like...

1274
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,560
我很乐意  麦德尔
I'm proud to join the group, Mildred.

1275
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:53,890
你感觉如何  麦克?
How's it going, Mac?

1276
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:56,190
非常好  小比利  相当不错
Perfect, Billy Boy, absolutely perfect.

1277
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:59,530
他们每天给我一万瓦  我...
They was giving me 10,000 watts a day, you know, and I'm...

1278
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:01,100
现在很烧
hot to trot.

1279
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,320
下一个我干的女人
The next woman takes me on

1280
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,270
会像游戏机一样亮起来...
is gonna light up like a pinball machine...

1281
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:06,400
真是太值得了!
and pay off in silver dollars!

1282
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,410
非常有趣  兰道尔...
That's an amusing thought, Randall...

1283
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,250
当你进来的时候吉姆正在发言
but when you came in we were talking to Jim.

1284
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,120
他吃药的习惯有问题...
He has a problem with his medication...

1285
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:20,150
现在回到主题
and we'd like to get back to that.

1286
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:23,720
我一点也不介意  瑞秋护士  我现在...
Oh, I don't. I don't mind at all, Nurse Ratched, I'm...

1287
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:26,720
就像小狗一样乖...
gentle as a puppy dog and...

1288
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:29,230
请继续  谢谢
Please proceed. Thank you.

1289
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:43,770
大家晚安  明天见
Good night, gentlemen. See you in the morning.

1290
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:11,350
亲爱的  我是麦克
Yeah, baby, it's Mac.

1291
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:13,370
就今晚了
It's on tonight.

1292
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,990
别担心
Don't worry about it.

1293
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:17,190
别担心  找一辆车
Don't worry about it. Get a car.

1294
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:20,970
我不管  宝贝  如果要的话偷一辆来
I don't give a shit, baby. Steal it if you have to.

1295
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:23,640
我必须要走了!  我必须要走了!
I gotta go! I gotta go!

1296
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:25,700
不要忘了带酒来
Don't forget to bring some booze.

1297
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:26,680
对
Right.

1298
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:27,740
再见
Bye.

1299
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:23,730
酋长  我受不了
Chief, I can't take it no more.

1300
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,200
我要逃走
I gotta get out of here.

1301
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,040
我不能  就是不能
I can't. I just can't.

1302
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,080
比你想的要简单  酋长
It's easier than you think, Chief.

1303
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:42,320
对你更是这样  你比我还壮
For you, maybe. You're a lot bigger than me.

1304
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,390
酋长  你像树一样的巨大
Why, Chief, you're about as big as a goddamn tree trunk.

1305
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,270
我的父亲真的很壮
My poppa's real big.

1306
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,710
他随心所欲
He did like he pleased.

1307
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:03,080
所以每个人都利用他
That's why everybody worked on him.

1308
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,100
上一次我看到他的时候
The last time I've seen my father

1309
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:10,280
他因为喝太多酒而瞎了
he was blind in the cedars from drinking.

1310
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,350
每一次他把酒瓶放进嘴里...
And every time he put the bottle to his mouth...

1311
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:16,290
不是他喝酒
he don't suck out of it.

1312
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:19,320
而是酒喝他  直到他有了很多皱纹...
It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk so...

1313
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:23,500
皮肤也变黄  连狗都不认识他
wrinkled and yellow, even the dogs don't know him.

1314
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:26,670
他就是这样死的  对吧?
Killed him, huh?

1315
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:31,000
我没有说他们杀掉他
I'm not saying they killed him.

1316
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:35,200
他们只是利用他  就像他们利用你一样
They just worked on him, the way they're working on you.

1317
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:46,220
他们来了  酋长
There they are, Chief.

1318
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,860
他们来了  他们来这儿了
There they are. They're here.

1319
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:05,400
在这里!
Over here. That's it!

1320
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,870
麦克墨菲停止那个疯狂的行为...
McMurphy, stop all this Holy Roller shit...

1321
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:10,850
赶快滚回床上  你懂吗?
and get your ass back in bed. Do you understand?

1322
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:15,690
神聆听了我的祷告  特寇
My prayers have been answered, Turkle.

1323
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:17,850
所以来看看
Come on and see.

1324
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,700
20块钱...
You'd take $20...

1325
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:32,210
别说出去  可以吗  特寇?
to get down on your knees and pray, wouldn't you, Turkle?

1326
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,130
没有办法  没有办法
No, it don't send me, don't send me.

1327
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:36,910
-不行吗?  -对我来说没差
-It don't?  -Don't do nothing to me, no.

1328
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:39,040
你知道还有更多的...
Well, you know there'll be more...

1329
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:44,980
我是说  他们会带两瓶酒来...
I mean, they'll be bringing a couple of bottles with them, and...

1330
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:48,560
继续说下去  老兄  继续说下去  但是...
You're getting closer, brother. You're getting closer, but...

1331
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:52,920
应该还有比酒更好的  对吧?
they're gonna be sharing more than just bottles, ain't they?

1332
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:55,660
-你懂我的意思吗?  -当然
-You know what I mean?  -Yeah, sure.

1333
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:57,760
-我懂你的意思  -你懂我的意思吗?
-I know what you mean.  -You understand what I mean?

1334
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,890
我懂你的意思
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

1335
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:03,210
-尽管开口  -老兄  我什么都没看见
-Anything you say, Turkle.  -I'm on my knees, brother.

1336
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:05,900
-我什么都没看见  -太好了
-I'm on my knees.  -Yeah, all right, all right.

1337
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:13,380
-我来帮她们一下  -感激不尽
-Let me just give them a hand here.  -I appreciate that.

1338
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:14,940
女士们!
Ladies!

1339
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:18,390
谢谢  这都归你了  特寇先生
Oh, thank you. I believe this is your department, Mr. Turkle.

1340
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,790
-没错  帮我一下  -萝丝  你好吗?
-Hi, there! Give me a hand.  -Hi, Rose, how you doing?

1341
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:22,590
乐意之至
Love to give you a hand.

1342
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:25,590
小声一点
Keep it down. Keep it down.

1343
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:27,720
-我的裤子破了  -小声点!
-I split my pants.  -Keep it down!

1344
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:31,800
-给我  全部都给我  -能不能安静点!
-Give it to me. Give it all to me.  -You got to keep it down!

1345
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:36,500
看起来像是我的高中
This looks like my high school.

1346
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:40,600
我要这个
Oh, hey, I take that.

1347
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:42,510
-我要那个理发厅的椅子  -你可以拿走
-The barber chair.  -You may have it.

1348
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:44,070
那是我的了
It is mine, mine.

1349
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:46,620
你可以拿走  亲爱的
You can have it. You can have it, honey.

1350
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:51,920
-看看这些水管  -你的地方真不错
-Take a load of these tubs.  -It's a real nice place you got here.

1351
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,130
我可不可以洗个澡?
Hey, can I take a bath?
