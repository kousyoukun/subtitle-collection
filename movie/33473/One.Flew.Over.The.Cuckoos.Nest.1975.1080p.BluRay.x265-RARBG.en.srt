1
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:18,927
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

2
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:21,930
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Mr. Washington.

3
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:31,940
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

4
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:35,401
- Good morning, Bancini.
- Good morning.

5
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:45,245
How are you feeling?

6
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:47,247
Rested.

7
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:05,139
Medication time.

8
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,642
Medication time.

9
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,544
Okay, move it up!

10
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:37,839
Mr. Fredrickson, here.

11
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:54,772
Juice.

12
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,070
Chief.

13
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:10,538
Chief.

14
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,665
Okay, my friend, let's go.

15
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:37,524
Here are his papers,
and I'm gonna need a signature.

16
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:36,249
Hi.

17
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:43,047
- Mr. McMurphy's here.
- All right.

18
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:00,648
All right, I'm ready.

19
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:02,650
Okay. One pair of socks.

20
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,071
T-shirt.

21
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:13,745
Hi.

22
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,668
Goddamn, boy,
you're as big as a mountain!

23
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:23,171
Looks like you might have played
some football.

24
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:24,964
What's your name?

25
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:27,258
He can't hear you. He's deaf.

26
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,469
Deaf and dumb Indian.

27
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:33,431
Is that so?

28
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,642
Come on, Bibbit.

29
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:37,977
Can't even make a sound, huh?

30
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,272
How.

31
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:54,077
Club lead. Jack of clubs.

32
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:00,083
What's your name, son?

33
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,793
Billy Bibbit.

34
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,671
Glad to know you, Bill. McMurphy's mine.

35
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:08,258
That's old Charlie Cheswick's cards.

36
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:11,594
That's his ace of spades.

37
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:13,680
Your turn, Bill.

38
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:15,890
Big ten.

39
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:20,770
- Put one of them on it, will you?
- Wait a minute.

40
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,359
Oh, I can win that one.

41
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:28,194
- I win.
- Oh, you overtrumped?

42
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,280
- Sure.
- Pinochle, Bill?

43
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:35,577
What's the bid?

44
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,662
Five... Five-fifty.

45
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:46,254
You like to look at other people's cards,
do you?

46
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,672
Yes.

47
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:49,507
Ever seen this one?

48
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,893
- Come on, Martini.
- Martini!

49
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:03,479
Martini, will you? Will you play a club?

50
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:10,111
Whose turn is it now?

51
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:11,362
Let's see, he trumped...

52
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:12,655
Where you going?

53
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,490
- Aren't you going to play?
- What's the matter?

54
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,910
Aren't you gonna play, Martini?

55
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:19,662
Martini? I want to play.

56
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,876
Billy, I want to win some...

57
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:28,296
Get a grip on yourself, will you?

58
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,508
Get a grip on yourself, will you?

59
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,759
Yes?

60
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:36,596
- Mr. McMurphy's here, Doc.
- Good, have him come in.

61
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:42,393
Thank you.

62
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:44,687
McMurphy, I'm Dr. Spivey.

63
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,106
Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure it is
to meet you.

64
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,025
Sure. Pull up a chair,
sit down and let's talk.

65
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:50,276
Sure.

66
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,580
R.P. McMurphy.

67
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:05,208
That's a hell of a fish there, Doc.

68
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,126
- Isn't that a dandy?
- Yeah.

69
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:09,504
It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?

70
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:11,506
- No, 32.
- Thirty-two.

71
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:14,008
But I'll tell you,
it took every bit of strength I had...

72
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:15,927
...to hold it while the guy took the picture.

73
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:17,178
Every damn bit.

74
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:20,181
Probably that chain
didn't help it any, either.

75
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:22,225
You didn't weigh the chain, did you?

76
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,018
No, I didn't weigh the chain.

77
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:25,895
But I'm awfully proud of that picture.

78
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:28,690
That's the first Chinooker I ever caught.

79
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:31,401
It's a nice one.

80
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:39,993
Randall Patrick McMurphy.

81
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:42,370
Thirty-eight years old.

82
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,173
What can you tell me about...

83
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:55,884
...why you've been sent over here?

84
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:58,720
Well...

85
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,722
I don't know.

86
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:02,891
What's it say there?

87
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,186
- Mind if I smoke?
- No, go right ahead.

88
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:08,771
Well, it...

89
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:11,983
...says several things here.

90
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,613
It said you've been belligerent.

91
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:19,407
Talked when unauthorized.

92
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:24,704
You've been resentful in attitude
towards work, in general. That you're lazy.

93
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:27,916
Chewing gum in class.

94
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:34,130
The real reason
that you've been sent here...

95
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:37,175
...is because they wanted you
to be evaluated.

96
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:40,303
To determine whether or not
you're mentally ill.

97
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:42,388
This is the real reason.

98
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:45,600
Why do you think they might think that?

99
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,814
Well, as near as I can figure out,
it's 'cause l...

100
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,109
...fight and fuck too much.

101
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:56,611
In the penitentiary?

102
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:58,530
No, no, no, you mean why...

103
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,032
Why did you get sent over here...

104
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,992
...from the work farm?

105
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:07,747
Well, I really don't know, Doc.

106
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:11,042
It says here that you went around...

107
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,503
- Let me just take a look...
- It ain't up to me, you know.

108
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:14,921
One...

109
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:17,215
...two, three...

110
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:19,509
...four...

111
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:21,636
You've got at least...

112
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,888
...five arrests for assault.

113
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,934
What can you tell me about that?

114
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:29,727
Five fights, huh?

115
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,939
Rocky Marciano's got 40,
and he's a millionaire.

116
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:35,817
- That's true.
- That is true.

117
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:40,405
Of course, it's true that you went in for...

118
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:41,698
...statutory rape.

119
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,533
That's true, is it not, this time?

120
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,827
Absolutely true. But, Doc...

121
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:50,331
...she was 15 years old going on 35, Doc...

122
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:53,501
...and she told me she was 18,
and she was...

123
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:56,629
...very willing, you know what I mean?

124
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,924
I practically had to take
to sewing my pants shut.

125
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:02,635
But between you and me...

126
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,516
...she might have been 15.
When you get that little red beaver...

127
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:11,603
...right there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at all.

128
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:13,021
And I don't think you do, either.

129
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:14,856
I hear what you're saying.

130
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:19,027
No man alive could resist that.
That's why I got into jail to begin with.

131
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:21,154
Now they're telling me
I'm crazy over here...

132
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:24,115
...'cause I don't sit there
like a goddamn vegetable.

133
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,159
It don't make a bit of sense to me.

134
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,536
If that's what being crazy is...

135
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:32,248
...then I'm senseless, out of it,
gone down the road, whacko.

136
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,834
But, no more, no less. That's it.

137
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:38,630
To be honest with you, McMurphy...

138
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,715
...what it says here...

139
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:44,636
...is that...

140
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:47,222
...they think...

141
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:49,057
They think...

142
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:53,144
...you've been faking it
in order to get out of your work detail.

143
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:58,900
- What do you think about that?
- Do I look like that kind of guy to you?

144
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:05,740
Let's just be frank for a minute.
All right, Randall, if you would.

145
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:08,034
Tell me...

146
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:11,621
Do you think there's anything
wrong with your mind, really?

147
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,833
Not a thing, Doc.

148
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,627
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.

149
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:26,761
You're going to be here for a period,
for us to evaluate you.

150
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,930
We're going to study you.

151
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:32,934
We'll make our determinations
as to what we're going to do...

152
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:36,729
...and give you the necessary treatment
as indicated.

153
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,148
Doc, let me just tell you this.

154
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:42,443
I'm here to cooperate with you
a hundred percent.

155
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:44,320
A hundred percent.

156
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:47,323
I'll be just right down the line with you.
You watch.

157
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:50,743
'Cause I think we ought to get
to the bottom of...

158
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,912
...R.P. McMurphy.

159
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:56,249
...R.P. McMurphy.

160
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:09,137
The scythe.

161
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:16,352
I'm awfully tired.

162
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:16,936
Sit down.

163
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:18,438
I'm tired.

164
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,319
Is that better?

165
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:36,247
Mr. Ellsworth...

166
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:39,250
...you'll wear yourself out.

167
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:45,757
All right, gentlemen, let's begin.

168
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,178
At the close of Friday's meeting...

169
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:53,848
...we were discussing
Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife.

170
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:58,353
Mr. Harding stated that his wife
made him uneasy...

171
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:02,148
...because she drew stares
from men on the street.

172
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:04,484
Is that correct, Mr. Harding?

173
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:05,735
Yes.

174
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:08,154
That's correct.

175
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,659
He also thinks he may have
given her reason...

176
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:16,663
...to seek sexual attention elsewhere,
but he wasn't able to say how.

177
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:22,544
Mr. Harding has been heard
to say to his wife:

178
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:23,962
"I hate you".

179
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:26,339
"I don't ever want to see you again".

180
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,424
"You've betrayed me".

181
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:33,221
So, does anyone care
to touch on this further?

182
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:52,740
Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?

183
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:58,079
Are you sure?

184
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:05,879
Billy, how about you?

185
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:09,966
No, no, ma'am.

186
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:13,678
I'd like to write in my book
that you began the meeting.

187
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:17,265
Just once.

188
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:32,363
Mr. Martini?

189
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:36,367
Are you with us?

190
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,953
Yes.

191
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:42,248
Would you like to begin?

192
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:54,385
Mr. Cheswick?

193
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:05,563
- Me?
- Yes.

194
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:15,406
You mean there's not a man here
who has an opinion on this matter?

195
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,788
All right.

196
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,499
Mr. Harding...

197
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:26,501
...you've stated on more than
one occasion...

198
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,546
...that you've suspected your wife
of seeing other men.

199
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:30,880
Oh, yes!

200
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,299
Yes, very much, I suspect her.

201
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:35,093
I suspect her.

202
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,178
Maybe you can tell us why...

203
00:17:37,178 --> 00:17:39,097
...you suspect her.

204
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:45,895
Well, I can only...

205
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:48,481
...speculate as to the reasons why.

206
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:53,069
Have you ever speculated, Mr. Harding...

207
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:55,572
...that perhaps you are...

208
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:57,782
...impatient with your wife...

209
00:17:57,782 --> 00:18:01,202
...because she doesn't meet
your mental requirements?

210
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:06,666
Perhaps. But you see,
the only thing I can really...

211
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,085
...speculate on, Nurse Ratched...

212
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,796
...is the very existence of my life...

213
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:14,465
...with or without my wife...

214
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,095
...in terms of the human relationships,
the juxtaposition of...

215
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:23,349
...one person to another,
the form, the content.

216
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:27,187
Harding, why don't you knock off
the bullshit and get to the point?

217
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:28,479
This is the point.

218
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:31,399
This is the point, Taber. It's not bullshit.

219
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:34,652
I'm not just talking about my wife,
I'm talking about my life!

220
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:37,197
I can't seem to get that through to you.

221
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:40,283
I'm not just talking about one person,
I'm talking about everybody!

222
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:43,369
I'm talking about form !
I'm talking about content!

223
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:44,787
I'm talking about interrelationships!

224
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:47,790
I'm talking about God, the Devil,
Hell, Heaven!

225
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,084
Do you understand? Finally?

226
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:54,506
Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb
I can't believe it.

227
00:18:55,298 --> 00:18:57,800
It makes me feel very peculiar,
very peculiar...

228
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,303
- ...when you throw in something like that.
- Why?

229
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,222
What does that mean, "peculiar," Harding?

230
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,182
- Peculiar?
- Peculiar?

231
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,520
I'm gonna tell you guys something.

232
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:10,396
You just don't want to learn anything.

233
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,315
You just don't want to listen to anybody.

234
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,108
He's got intelligence!

235
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:18,404
You've never heard the word "peculiar"?
Say, what are you trying to say?

236
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:20,406
You trying to say I'm queer? Is that it?

237
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:23,117
Little Mary Ann? Little Marjorie Jane?

238
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:25,411
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

239
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:27,914
Is that your idea of communicating
something to me?

240
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:29,499
Well, is it?

241
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,877
They're all crowding in on you,
Mr. Harding.

242
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,170
They're all ganging up on you.

243
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:35,797
Is that news?

244
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:39,801
They sometimes want to gang up
on me, too, but I..

245
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,719
Cheswick, do me a favor.

246
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,304
Take it easy.

247
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:46,015
- And stay off my side.
- But I only want to...

248
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:47,934
I only want to help you.

249
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:49,811
- I understand.
- But don't you want me to..?

250
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:52,313
- Please!
- But I only want to...

251
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:54,816
- Please!
- But I only want to help you.

252
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:56,234
Please!

253
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,779
You see...

254
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:03,199
...the other day you made some allusions,
both of you.

255
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:05,785
- Illusions?
- Yes, allusions.

256
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:08,621
Not illusions. Allusions...

257
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:11,583
...to sexual problems
I might be having with my wife.

258
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,794
Let's say it's true! Let's say
I know it's true, but you don't!

259
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:17,297
If that's your idea of trying
to tell me something..

260
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:20,383
You know, Harding, I think you're
some kind of morbid asshole!

261
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:22,302
- "Peculiar!"
- "Asshole" again.

262
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:23,595
It makes you feel "peculiar."

263
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:25,430
You've talked about your wife
ever since I can remember!

264
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,891
You know, she's on your mind,
and blah, blah...

265
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:29,184
I'm not talking about my wife!

266
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:31,728
When will you get that through your thick,
fucking head?

267
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:34,189
When are you gonna wise up
and turn her loose?

268
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:36,691
- Please!
- I don't want to hear it!

269
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:39,402
- I'm tired.
- I don't want to hear it!

270
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:42,405
I'm tired.

271
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:44,407
I don't want to hear it.

272
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:46,117
I don't want to hear it.

273
00:20:46,117 --> 00:20:48,620
It's a lot of baloney and I'm tired.

274
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,538
I don't want to hear it!

275
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,332
We know you're tired. We're all tired.

276
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,211
- I'm tired and it's a lot of baloney.
- You're not tired, Bancini.

277
00:20:57,921 --> 00:21:00,006
Take your hands off me!

278
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:09,807
Take your hands off me!

279
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:29,410
Recreation time, gentlemen.

280
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,912
The bus is waiting.

281
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:34,207
All nonrestricted patients
please report to the bus.

282
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:00,525
Ever play this game, Chief?

283
00:22:05,113 --> 00:22:07,198
Come on, I'll show you.

284
00:22:07,615 --> 00:22:09,409
Old Indian game.

285
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:12,912
It's called "put the ball in the hole".

286
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:18,418
Now, that ought to be just...
Hold it right there.

287
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:19,419
All right.

288
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:22,005
Now, that's your spot. Don't move.

289
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:24,507
Never move. That's your spot,
you understand?

290
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:27,010
Right there. You don't move. Now...

291
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,803
...take the ball.

292
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:31,514
Here, take the ball.

293
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:34,225
That's it. Hold on to it.

294
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:37,020
Not too hard, Chief.
You'll crush all the air out of it.

295
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,106
We're gonna put her in the basket.
You understand?

296
00:22:40,106 --> 00:22:42,692
All right. Now, raise up your arms.

297
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:46,321
Raise the ball up in the air, Chief.
Raise it up.

298
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:47,739
McMurphy?

299
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:51,409
What the hell are you talking to him for?
He can't hear a fucking thing.

300
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:55,205
I ain't talking to him.
I'm talking to myself. It helps me think.

301
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:57,707
Yeah, well, it don't help him none.

302
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,835
Well, it don't hurt him, either, does it?

303
00:23:00,835 --> 00:23:03,254
Don't hurt you, does it, Chief?

304
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:05,340
See? Don't hurt him.

305
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:09,636
All right, now, Chief.

306
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:13,348
Let's raise our hands up in the air.

307
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:14,641
Just raise them up.

308
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:16,434
Up, you understand?

309
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:17,727
Raise the hands up, here.

310
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:19,562
Up. Raise your hands up.

311
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:22,524
Up! That's it! That's it!
Up, all the way up.

312
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:26,110
All the way up. That's a baby, all right.

313
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:28,738
Okay, now...

314
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:33,034
Now, jump up in the air,
and put it in the basket, Chief.

315
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:35,411
Jump up and dunk it in!

316
00:23:36,454 --> 00:23:40,375
Jump up in the air and stuff
that son of a bitch in there, Chief.

317
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,962
Take a rest, Chief.

318
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,423
Just stay right there.
Take a rest. I'll be right back.

319
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:54,556
Bancini, come here for a minute.

320
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:57,058
You're looking all right.
Get right over here for a second.

321
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:59,435
Now, just stand right there.

322
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:02,146
Just get down a little bit.
All right. Stand up.

323
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:04,065
Stand up. Go ahead.

324
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,859
That's a baby! All right, you got it.

325
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:08,152
All right. Now, over there.

326
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:12,740
Hit me, Chief! I got the moves!
I got them, Chief!

327
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,659
Hold it right there. Give me the ball.

328
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:17,162
Give me the ball. That's it.
Thank you, Chief.

329
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:18,454
Now...

330
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,622
...hold it right there.

331
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:22,709
You take the ball, you jump up,
and put it in the basket.

332
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,837
See what I mean? Put it...
Bancini, hold still.

333
00:24:25,837 --> 00:24:28,339
All right, Chief, here. Take the ball.

334
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,342
Now, jump up and put it
in the basket, Chief!

335
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:34,053
Jump up and put it in the basket!

336
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:35,346
Not you, Bancini.

337
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:37,182
Raise up! Bancini, where you going?

338
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,641
I'm tired!

339
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:41,477
Fast break! Defense! Get back!

340
00:24:43,354 --> 00:24:46,441
Come on, Bancini,
where the fuck you going at?

341
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:48,484
General, get this man around here.

342
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,153
That's it, back!

343
00:24:50,236 --> 00:24:51,946
Over to Chief.

344
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:54,866
Fast break! Fast break! Hit me, Chief!

345
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:56,951
Hit me, baby!

346
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,454
Put it in the basket, Chief!

347
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:01,664
Put it in the basket!

348
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:04,751
Put it in the basket!

349
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:21,142
All right.

350
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:24,479
Make the bets.

351
00:25:24,646 --> 00:25:25,939
What's this?

352
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:27,649
Make the bets.

353
00:25:27,857 --> 00:25:29,859
It's a dime, Martini.

354
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,153
I bet a nickel.

355
00:25:32,862 --> 00:25:35,156
A dime's the limit, Martini.

356
00:25:37,158 --> 00:25:38,868
I bet a dime.

357
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,334
This is not a dime, Martini.

358
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,255
This is a dime.

359
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:52,882
If you break it in haIf...

360
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:55,760
...you don't get two nickels, you get shit.

361
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:58,471
Try and smoke it. You understand?

362
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:02,851
You don't understand!
All right, here they come.

363
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:05,937
Queen to the Chesser,
Big Bull to Tabulations...

364
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:09,774
...ten to Billy to match his whang,
and the dealer gets a three.

365
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:12,151
Hit me. Hit me.

366
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:16,072
I can't hit you because it ain't
your turn yet. You understand?

367
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:18,449
You see these other people?
These are the real ones.

368
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:20,743
These are real people here.

369
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:24,747
What'll you do, Ches? Hit or sit?

370
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:33,089
Hit me.

371
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:35,550
That's 23 up, Cheswick.

372
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,886
Taber, you're busted. Give me this.

373
00:26:37,886 --> 00:26:39,596
Twenty-three.

374
00:26:39,762 --> 00:26:41,681
- Hit me.
- Shut up!

375
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:42,849
Taber.

376
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:44,767
- Give me a dime!
- I'm next.

377
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,561
You're not next!

378
00:26:47,854 --> 00:26:49,147
Hit me.

379
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:50,982
- Ace.
- Hit me.

380
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:52,775
That's 4 or 14.

381
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:55,778
Don't want any more. Billy?

382
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,156
- Hit me. Hit me.
- Five.

383
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:04,162
You didn't make a bet, Martini.
I can't hit you. Jesus Christ.

384
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:05,371
I bet a dime.

385
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:07,165
All right, here.

386
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,209
- That's 20 showing.
- No.

387
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,085
- Take your money.
- No.

388
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,378
It's not.

389
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:14,339
It's 10, 11, 12, 13.

390
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:19,761
This is a fucking queen here,
you understand?

391
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:22,472
You don't count the this and the this.

392
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:24,307
Hit me.

393
00:27:24,682 --> 00:27:26,184
Hit me.

394
00:27:24,682 --> 00:27:25,975
You got 20 showing!

395
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:28,478
Hit me again. I want another card.

396
00:27:28,478 --> 00:27:31,064
Scanlon, who's pitching the opener?

397
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,983
Medication time.

398
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:35,985
This isn't a queen!

399
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:40,073
Mac, hit me.

400
00:27:41,574 --> 00:27:43,493
- Who's pitching the opener?
- Hit me.

401
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:44,786
Jesus Christ Almighty!

402
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:47,163
Do you nuts want to play cards
or do you want to fucking jerk off?

403
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:48,456
Play the game!

404
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:51,501
I can't even hear myself think already, here.

405
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:01,678
Stay back!

406
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:04,097
- Excuse me, ma'am. I just wanted to..
- Stay back!

407
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:06,599
Patients aren't allowed
in the nurses' station.

408
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:09,018
Well, I just wanted to turn...

409
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:13,481
When you're outside, we'll discuss
whatever problem you have, okay?

410
00:28:13,481 --> 00:28:17,277
The patients are not allowed
in the nurses' station. All right?

411
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:24,075
Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on?
Thank you.

412
00:28:24,075 --> 00:28:25,869
Excuse me, miss.

413
00:28:25,994 --> 00:28:29,080
Do you think it might be possible
to turn the music down...

414
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,083
...so maybe a couple of the boys
could talk?

415
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:35,670
That music is for everyone, Mr. McMurphy.

416
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:39,090
I know, but do you think
we might ease it down a little...

417
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,010
...so maybe the boys didn't have to shout?

418
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:45,388
What you probably don't realize...

419
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:47,891
...is that we have a lot of old men
in this ward...

420
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:51,311
...who couldn't hear the music
if we turned it lower.

421
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:53,897
That music is all they have.

422
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:57,901
Your hand is staining my window.

423
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:02,197
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- All right.

424
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,909
Mr. McMurphy, your medication.

425
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:09,204
What's in the horse pill?

426
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:11,122
It's just medicine. It's good for you.

427
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:15,418
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking
something if I don't know what it is.

428
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:17,795
Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.

429
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:20,381
I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.

430
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:24,177
It's just that I don't want anyone
to try and slip me saltpeter.

431
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:27,388
You know what I mean?

432
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,807
It's all right, Nurse Pilbow.

433
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:33,520
If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want
to take his medication orally...

434
00:29:34,187 --> 00:29:37,982
...I'm sure we can arrange
that he can have it some other way.

435
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:42,278
But I don't think you'd like it,
Mr. McMurphy.

436
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,074
You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?

437
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:47,826
Give it to me.

438
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:49,911
Good.

439
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:58,211
Very good!

440
00:29:59,796 --> 00:30:01,214
Yummy!

441
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,095
Mr. Harding?

442
00:30:09,222 --> 00:30:10,640
Merci.

443
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:25,530
Tell me, lover-boy...

444
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:28,491
...why didn't you tell her to go fuck herself?

445
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:35,915
Jesus Christ.

446
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:40,420
Funny, huh? That's funny, huh?

447
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:44,090
You know that wasn't very smart.
She could have seen that.

448
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:50,722
God Almighty,
she's got you guys coming and going.

449
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:54,184
What do you think she is?
Some kind of a champ or something?

450
00:30:54,225 --> 00:30:56,728
No, I thought you were the champ.

451
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:58,605
You want to bet?

452
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:00,899
Bet on what?

453
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:03,109
One week.

454
00:31:03,026 --> 00:31:05,528
I bet in one week I can put a bug
so far up her ass...

455
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:07,447
...she won't know whether to shit
or wind her wrist watch.

456
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:10,492
What do you say to that? Want to bet?
Do you want to bet?

457
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:12,410
One week. That's all I need.
Who wants to bet?

458
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,121
You want to bet? Bet a buck. One buck.

459
00:31:16,122 --> 00:31:17,624
I'll bet.

460
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,835
Tabes in, one buck. Solid.

461
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:28,927
Tabes in, one buck. Solid.

462
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:25,840
Last time we were discussing...

463
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:28,301
...Mr. Harding and the problem
with his wife...

464
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:31,513
...and I think we were making
a lot of progress.

465
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,599
So who would like to begin today?

466
00:31:39,604 --> 00:31:41,314
Mr. McMurphy?

467
00:31:42,732 --> 00:31:45,818
I've been thinking about
what you said about...

468
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:50,031
...you know, getting things off your chest.

469
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:56,120
Well, there's a couple of things
that I'd like to get off my chest.

470
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:59,624
Well, that's very good, Mr. McMurphy.
Go ahead.

471
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:04,337
Today, as you may or may not know,
it doesn't matter...

472
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:07,340
...is the opening of the World Series.

473
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:11,719
What I'd like to suggest is that
we change the work detail tonight...

474
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,431
...so that we can watch the ball game.

475
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:20,520
Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking...

476
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:25,108
...is that we change
a very carefully worked out schedule.

477
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,612
A little change never hurt, huh?

478
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:31,406
A little variety?

479
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:35,201
Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.

480
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:39,455
Some men on the ward take a long,
long time to get used to the schedule.

481
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:44,002
Change it now,
and they might find it very disturbing.

482
00:32:44,043 --> 00:32:47,839
Fuck the schedule! They can go back
to the schedule after the Series.

483
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,134
I'm talking about the World Series,
Nurse Ratched.

484
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:55,430
Well, anyway, this is no way
to proceed about this.

485
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,516
How would it be if we had a vote...

486
00:32:59,017 --> 00:33:01,311
...and let the majority rule?

487
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,605
Great. Let's vote on it.

488
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:08,109
So, all those in favor raise your hands.

489
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:14,824
Okay, guys, come on.

490
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:17,243
Put your hands up.

491
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,334
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want to watch the World Series?

492
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:27,253
Get your hands up.
It can do you some good...

493
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:30,757
...to get some exercise,
putting your arms up in the air.

494
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:33,218
That's it. Come on, let's...

495
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:44,771
What is this crap?

496
00:33:44,729 --> 00:33:47,815
I watch the Series.
I haven't missed the Series in years.

497
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:52,278
Even in the cooler. When I'm in the cooler
they run it there or they'll have a riot.

498
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:55,949
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, be good Americans!

499
00:33:59,744 --> 00:34:02,831
Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes, and...

500
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:05,917
...that's not enough
to change the ward policy.

501
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,544
I'm sorry.

502
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:14,050
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:14,634
My turn. Okay, hot dice.

504
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:17,053
I want a ten to go...

505
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:19,472
... 'cause I need cash.

506
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:21,266
I want to get to Mediterranean Avenue.

507
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:23,017
Big ten! Perfect.

508
00:34:23,142 --> 00:34:24,644
Two fives.

509
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:30,066
- What are you doing?
-Hotel.

510
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:32,527
- You do not have a hotel there.
- Hotel.

511
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:34,445
For the third time...

512
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:36,865
- ...you do not have a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

513
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:40,243
- It costs $1,000 and four green houses...
- Hotel.

514
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,579
- ...to put a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

515
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:45,331
Play the game and knock off the bullshit.

516
00:34:45,665 --> 00:34:46,958
Play the game, Harding.

517
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,251
What are you talking about?
I am playing the game.

518
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:50,670
-Play the game!
- I ain't doing anything to you!

519
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:51,921
-What bullshit?
- Your bullshit!

520
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:53,882
-What about your bullshit?
- Play the game!

521
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:55,675
-You keep your hands off me!
- Play the game!

522
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:56,926
I've had enough bullshit out of you!

523
00:34:56,968 --> 00:34:59,470
- Play the game.
- What the fuck are you picking on me for?

524
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:00,722
Play the game, Harding.

525
00:35:00,638 --> 00:35:03,725
- I'm trying to ignore you, see?
- Just play the game.

526
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:05,059
Keep your hands off me, you son of a bitch!

527
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:07,645
Keep your hands off me! You hear me?

528
00:35:08,855 --> 00:35:11,941
- Come on, come on.
- I can be pushed just so far, see!

529
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:13,234
Play the game.

530
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:15,653
You touch me once more.
Just touch me once more!

531
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:18,156
Just once more, huh? Just once more!

532
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:20,658
- Just touch me once more!
- Play the game, Harding!

533
00:35:20,658 --> 00:35:22,577
Just touch me once more!

534
00:35:22,535 --> 00:35:24,120
Holy Jesus!

535
00:35:42,555 --> 00:35:45,767
Is that what your schedule
does for you, Hard-on?

536
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:48,686
Damn lunatic!

537
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:50,772
I don't know what you're talking about.

538
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:53,691
No? Well, then stay all wet, Harding, huh?

539
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:56,945
'Cause I'm going downtown
to watch the World Series, anyway.

540
00:35:56,945 --> 00:35:58,863
Anybody want to come with me?

541
00:35:58,863 --> 00:36:01,366
I do, Mac. I want to go with you!

542
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,785
Ches, all right. Anybody else?

543
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:06,162
- Where?
- Any bar downtown.

544
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:08,748
Mac, you can't...

545
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:11,084
...can't get out of here.

546
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:14,671
Anybody want to bet?

547
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,465
Chicken shits!

548
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:21,386
Maybe he'll just show Nurse Ratched
his big thing...

549
00:36:21,344 --> 00:36:23,930
...and she'll open the door for him.

550
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:28,268
Yeah, maybe I will...

551
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:32,063
...and then maybe I'll use your
thick skull and knock a hole in the wall.

552
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,565
Sefelt, see?

553
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:40,071
Why? My head would squash
like an eggplant.

554
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:44,450
Fuck Sefelt's head,
I don't need Sefelt's head!

555
00:36:44,576 --> 00:36:46,494
I'll take this fucking thing,
and put it through the window...

556
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:49,455
...and me and Cheswick will go out
through the hall...

557
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:52,667
...downtown, sit down in a bar,
wet our whistles...

558
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,586
...and watch the ball game.

559
00:36:54,586 --> 00:36:58,006
And that's the bet.
Now, does anybody want any of it?

560
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:02,051
You're going to lift that thing?

561
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:04,596
Yeah! That's right.

562
00:37:06,472 --> 00:37:08,266
I'll bet a buck.

563
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:10,560
Taber, $1.

564
00:37:11,477 --> 00:37:13,188
I bet a dime.

565
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:14,564
Mac, you can't...

566
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:16,774
...can't Iift that thing.

567
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:22,280
Anybody else want any of it? Hard-on?

568
00:37:25,158 --> 00:37:26,868
I'll bet $25!

569
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:29,996
$25, Hard-on!

570
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:35,460
Mac, nobody could ever lift that thing.

571
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:39,589
Get out of my way, son.
You're using my oxygen.

572
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:41,591
You know what I mean?

573
00:37:42,675 --> 00:37:44,177
All right.

574
00:37:45,178 --> 00:37:46,679
All right.

575
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:01,069
Giving up?

576
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:05,990
No! Just warming up.

577
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:08,076
Warming up.

578
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:10,995
This will be the one.

579
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:15,792
All right, baby.

580
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:06,509
But I tried, didn't I? Goddamn it!

581
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:09,179
At least I did that.

582
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,813
At least I did that.

583
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,897
And on the mound, the left-hander,
Al Downing.

584
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:22,692
The two pitchers still warming up,
right down below us.

585
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:25,695
The second game of
the 1963 World Series...

586
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:28,990
...is being brought to you
from Yankee Stadium.

587
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:36,414
Did you tell the girl
how you feIt about her?

588
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:49,385
I went over to her house...

589
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:52,722
...one Sunday afternoon and...

590
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,185
...and I brought her some flowers...

591
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:05,193
...and I said...

592
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:11,074
..."Celia, will you...

593
00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:17,080
"...marry me?"

594
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:41,437
Why did you want to marry her?

595
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:46,317
Well, I was in love with her.

596
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:53,116
Your mother told me
that you never told her about it.

597
00:41:03,418 --> 00:41:05,920
Why didn't you tell her about it?

598
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:23,229
Wasn't that the first time
you tried to commit suicide?

599
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:33,198
Oh, my God!

600
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:36,618
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

601
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:38,411
Miss Ratched...

602
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:41,456
...I'd like to ask you a question, please.

603
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:43,124
Go ahead.

604
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,211
Okay...

605
00:41:46,628 --> 00:41:48,421
You know, if...

606
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,841
...Billy doesn't feel like talking...

607
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:54,802
...I mean, why are you pressing him?

608
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:58,806
Why can't we go on to some new business?

609
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:03,436
The business of this meeting,
Mr. Cheswick...

610
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,230
...is therapy.

611
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:12,195
You know, I don't understand this,
Miss Ratched...

612
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:14,239
...because I don't...

613
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:16,032
Mr. McMurphy...

614
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:19,244
He said something yesterday
about a World Series.

615
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:22,831
A baseball game?

616
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,043
You know, and I've never been
to a baseball game and...

617
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:29,754
...I think I'd like to see one.

618
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:35,218
That would be good therapy, too,
wouldn't it, Miss Ratched?

619
00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:37,929
I thought we'd decided that issue.

620
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:43,017
I don't think so, because, I mean...

621
00:42:43,518 --> 00:42:46,020
...we discussed that yesterday...

622
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:50,233
...and we have a new game today,
I think, don't we, Mac?

623
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:54,028
That's right, Ches, and we want
a new vote on it, don't we?

624
00:42:57,949 --> 00:43:01,035
Would one more vote satisfy you,
Mr. McMurphy?

625
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:03,037
Yeah.

626
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:04,706
It'd satisfy me.

627
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,543
There's a vote before the group.

628
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:12,547
Everyone in favor of changing
the schedule, please raise your hand.

629
00:43:16,718 --> 00:43:19,512
Okay, I want to see the hands. Come on!

630
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,224
Which one of you nuts has got any guts?

631
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,442
All right. That's it!

632
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:35,653
I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy.

633
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:39,449
She only counts nine. Only nine!
It's a landslide.

634
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,745
There are 18 patients
on this ward, Mr. McMurphy...

635
00:43:44,245 --> 00:43:47,749
...and you have to have a majority
to change ward policy.

636
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,170
So you gentlemen
can put your hands down.

637
00:43:56,758 --> 00:44:00,261
Are you trying to tell me
that you're gonna count these?

638
00:44:00,553 --> 00:44:04,557
These poor sons of bitches,
they don't know what we're talking about.

639
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:07,936
Well, I have to disagree with you,
Mr. McMurphy.

640
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:11,356
These men are members of the ward,
just as you are.

641
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,028
All right. All I need is one vote, right?

642
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:18,738
Right?

643
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:20,156
All right.

644
00:44:21,157 --> 00:44:22,450
Okay.

645
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,079
Want to watch the World Series?

646
00:44:26,162 --> 00:44:28,081
This could be a big moment for you.

647
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,958
You want to watch a baseball game?

648
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,251
You want to watch baseball?

649
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,044
Just raise that hand up.
Just raise the hand up.

650
00:44:33,044 --> 00:44:35,547
- What do you say?
- I gave it all to her.

651
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,965
Sorry.

652
00:44:37,465 --> 00:44:39,384
Bancini, old horse.

653
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,345
What do you say?
You want to watch the ball game on TV?

654
00:44:42,428 --> 00:44:44,931
Want to watch the ball game?
Baseball? World Series?

655
00:44:44,931 --> 00:44:47,433
What do you say, pal? You're tired?

656
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:50,520
Just raise your hand up, Bancini.
Watch the ball game, huh?

657
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,772
I'm tired. Awfully tired.

658
00:44:53,064 --> 00:44:54,858
Okay. All right.

659
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:56,234
What about you, pal?

660
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,069
All we need's one vote. Just one vote.

661
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:59,988
Just your one vote. That's all we need.

662
00:44:59,946 --> 00:45:03,950
Just raise your hand up and your buddies
can watch the baseball game.

663
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,458
General, you remember, don't you?

664
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:14,961
October, the banner, the stars...

665
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:17,046
"Oh, say can you..."

666
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:20,383
The World Series.
Raise your hand up, Gen.

667
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:23,928
Just raise your hand up.

668
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:28,641
What about you pal, huh?
Want to watch the ball game?

669
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:32,770
Want to watch the ball game, huh?
Just one vote. Just raise your...

670
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:34,981
Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned.

671
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:37,442
For Christ's sake, isn't there
one of you fucking maniacs...

672
00:45:37,442 --> 00:45:38,735
...that knows what I'm talking about?

673
00:45:38,776 --> 00:45:40,487
Mr. McMurphy?

674
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:43,156
The meeting is adjourned.

675
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:45,575
Just wait a minute, will you?
Just one minute?

676
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:48,077
You can bring the subject up
again tomorrow.

677
00:45:48,161 --> 00:45:50,079
All right, Chief...

678
00:45:50,663 --> 00:45:53,166
...you're our last chance. What do you say?

679
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,459
Just raise your hand up.

680
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,294
That's all we need from you today, Chief.

681
00:45:56,252 --> 00:45:58,171
Just raise your hand up one time.

682
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:00,465
Show her that you can do it.

683
00:46:00,673 --> 00:46:02,592
Show her that you can still do it.

684
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:04,969
Just raise your hand up.
All the guys have got them up.

685
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:08,056
Just raise your hand up, Chief.
Will you? Huh?

686
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:15,647
Come on, there's got to be one guy here
that's not a total fucking nut!

687
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,940
Mac?

688
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,568
Chief! The Chief!

689
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:24,364
Nurse Ratched? Nurse Ratched, look!

690
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,866
Look. The Chief put his hand up.

691
00:46:26,866 --> 00:46:29,369
The Chief put his hand up. Look, he voted.

692
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,372
Would you please turn
the television set on?

693
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,500
The Chief has got his hand up, right there.

694
00:46:36,876 --> 00:46:38,795
The Chief voted. Now...

695
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:41,256
...will you please turn the television set on?

696
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,549
Mr. McMurphy...

697
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,051
...the meeting was adjourned,
and the vote was closed.

698
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:48,847
But the vote was ten to eight.
The Chief, he's got his hand up! Look!

699
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:50,056
No, Mr. McMurphy.

700
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:53,643
When the meeting was adjourned,
the vote was nine to nine.

701
00:46:55,061 --> 00:46:56,980
Come on, you're not going to say that now!

702
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,898
You're not going to say that now!

703
00:46:58,773 --> 00:47:00,692
You're going to pull that henhouse shit,
now, when the vote...

704
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,569
The Chief just voted! It was ten to nine!

705
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,780
I want that television set turned on!
Right now!

706
00:47:11,953 --> 00:47:13,538
Cheswick...

707
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,544
- I want to watch television.
- No, you have a work assignment.

708
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:23,298
- I want to watch television.
- No, you have a work assignment.

709
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,608
Koufax.

710
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:44,277
Koufax kicks. He delivers.

711
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,113
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.

712
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:48,990
Richardson's rounding first!
He's going for second!

713
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,909
The ball's in to deep right center!

714
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,702
Davidson, over in the corner,
cuts the ball off!

715
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,579
Here comes the throw.
Richardson's around the dirt!

716
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:56,498
He slides, he's in there.
He's safe! It's a double!

717
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,416
He's in there, Martini!
Look at Richardson, he's on second base.

718
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:01,377
Koufax is in big fucking trouble!
Big trouble, baby!

719
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,963
All right, here's Tresh.
He's the next batter!

720
00:48:03,963 --> 00:48:05,882
Tresh looks in. Koufax...

721
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:08,885
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro!
He kicks once, he pumps...

722
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:12,764
It's a strike! Koufax's curve ball is
snapping off like a fucking firecracker.

723
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,599
Here he comes with the next pitch.

724
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,102
Tresh swings!
It's a long fly ball to deep left center!

725
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:21,564
It's going! It's gone!

726
00:48:27,695 --> 00:48:30,782
Somebody give me a fucking wiener
before I die.

727
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,787
It's the great Mickey Mantle, now!
Here comes the pitch!

728
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,580
Mantle swings!

729
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,707
It's a fucking home run!

730
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:41,584
Gentlemen, stop this.

731
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,796
Stop this immediately.

732
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,970
Stop this immediately.

733
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,391
Do you like it here?

734
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:02,689
That fucking nurse, man!

735
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:05,775
What do you mean, sir?

736
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,786
She ain't honest.

737
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:24,794
Miss Ratched's one of the finest nurses
we've got in this institution.

738
00:49:27,505 --> 00:49:30,592
Well, I don't want to break up
the meeting or nothing...

739
00:49:30,675 --> 00:49:33,887
...but she's something of a cunt,
ain't she, Doc?

740
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:36,389
How do you mean that?

741
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,685
She likes a rigged game,
you know what I mean?

742
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,611
Well, you know,
I've been observing you here now...

743
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:52,405
...for the last four weeks...

744
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:56,201
...and I don't see any evidence
of mental illness, at all.

745
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,996
I think that you've been trying
to put us on, all this time.

746
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:04,375
You know, what do you want me to do?
You know.

747
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,587
You know what I mean? Is that it?

748
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,881
Is that crazy enough for you?

749
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:13,092
Want me to take a shit on the floor?
Christ!

750
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,723
Have you ever heard the old saying,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss?".

751
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:21,392
Yeah.

752
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,104
Does that mean something to you?

753
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:33,321
It's the same as "Don't wash
your dirty underwear in public".

754
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,283
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

755
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,329
I'm smarter than him, ain't I?

756
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,709
Well that, sort of, has always meant...

757
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:50,797
...it's hard for something to grow
on something that's moving.

758
00:50:51,422 --> 00:50:54,509
How did you feel about
what happened yesterday?

759
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,517
I wanted to kill... I mean...

760
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,320
Do you gentlemen have
any more questions?

761
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,325
I don't have any more, but perhaps you do.

762
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,036
Do you have a question, McMurphy?

763
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,414
Where do you suppose she lives?

764
00:51:26,332 --> 00:51:28,751
Where do you suppose she lives?

765
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,822
Chief, come on with me.

766
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,203
We'll show these guys who's nuts.

767
00:52:04,537 --> 00:52:06,331
All right, wait.

768
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,124
Stand right here.

769
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:11,044
All right. Grab the fence.

770
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,547
Grab the fence here.

771
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,716
Right here, Chief. Strong!

772
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:19,093
Strong, like this, here.

773
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,015
That's it. All right.

774
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,017
Okay. Up.

775
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,937
That's it.

776
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,939
All right, you got it?

777
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,822
All right, push!

778
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:23,158
Come on, Bob!

779
00:53:23,324 --> 00:53:25,326
Where are you going?

780
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:29,747
Don't breathe on me, Club.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

781
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:36,129
Come on, you guys. Get the lead out, huh?

782
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,472
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

783
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,141
Wait a minute!

784
00:53:48,933 --> 00:53:50,435
Hold it!

785
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,770
See how easy it is?

786
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,518
Boys.

787
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,271
This here is Candy.

788
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,315
Candy, this is the boys.

789
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,873
You all crazy?

790
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,964
You all crazy?

791
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,860
Let's go. Down here.

792
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,445
- Isn't this wonderful?
- Down here.

793
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,157
No problem.

794
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,243
Right here.

795
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,373
Come on, we don't want to be late
for our first day out.

796
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,795
Hello!

797
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,929
Come on, will you?
What are you standing around for?

798
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,390
Get on board. Give them these.

799
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,855
Hey, wait a minute!
What the heck is going on here?

800
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,274
What are you doing on this boat?

801
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,193
We're going fishing.

802
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:05,361
No, you're not going fishing.

803
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:09,073
Not on this boat.
You're not going fishing on this boat.

804
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:12,285
Oh, yeah, on this boat. Ask Captain Block.

805
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,538
- Captain Block?
- Captain Block. Yes, that's right.

806
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,165
Who are you?

807
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,543
We're from the...

808
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,671
...State Mental Institution...

809
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,299
This is Dr. Cheswick...

810
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,760
...Dr. Taber, Dr. Fredrickson...

811
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,179
...Dr. Scanlon.

812
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,181
The famous Dr. Scanlon.

813
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,391
Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit...

814
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,685
...Dr. Martini, and...

815
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,896
...Dr. Sefelt.

816
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,150
How about you? Who are you?

817
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,861
I'm Dr. McMurphy. R.P. McMurphy.

818
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,785
Wait, wait... Wait one second.

819
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,703
You don't understand.
We chartered the boat.

820
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,580
We're going to go fishing.

821
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,999
And that's all there is to it.

822
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,590
You better quit on this.

823
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,093
They'll throw you in the can again,
you know?

824
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,345
No, they won't. We're nuts!

825
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:16,391
They'll just take us back
to the feeb farm, see?

826
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,978
Von Sefelt, get the stern line.

827
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,189
Tabes, you're at the bow.

828
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,691
This one?

829
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,404
That one! The one at your feet.

830
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,204
Get back on! Jesus!

831
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,376
Tabes!

832
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,673
Come here, quick!

833
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,516
Aye, aye, sir. I mean, yes, Mac!

834
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:43,269
Take it easy, Charlie.
Have you ever driven one of these things?

835
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,480
- Driven one of...
- Yeah.

836
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,273
No, Mac.

837
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,776
Well, it's a lot of fun.

838
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,111
Come on over here.
Put your hands on the wheel.

839
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,905
- Put your hands on.
- I've never done this.

840
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,991
Put your hands on the wheel
so you don't fall down. All right.

841
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,494
Just hold it steady right there, like that.

842
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,787
- Steady?
- Steady, yeah.

843
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,705
Now just go straight.

844
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:05,208
- Straight as an arrow, Charlie.
- Straight, Mac?

845
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,126
- Just straight. That's right.
- But, Mac...

846
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,504
Mac, this thing ain't too steady.

847
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,925
- Where are we going, Mac?
- Straight.

848
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,468
Just go on!

849
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,605
This is the bait.

850
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,317
Little fishes.

851
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,986
Dead fishes.

852
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,571
That's right.

853
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:38,032
Now what are we going to do
with these little fishes?

854
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,913
- Catch big fishes.
- That's right. That's right, Mr. Martini.

855
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,917
Hooks.

856
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,711
Hooks.

857
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,423
Now, hold on to your hooks...

858
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,717
...'cause here are the fishes.

859
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,218
Tabes.

860
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,973
Get a fish here.

861
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,184
There, for you, Martini.

862
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,812
All right, now we, each one of us
has got a fish.

863
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,606
What are you laughing at, Martini?

864
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,524
You're not an idiot, huh?

865
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:14,986
You're not a goddamn looney now, boy,
you're a fisherman.

866
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,781
Now, take your bottom hook.

867
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,784
You got it?

868
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,121
You take it...

869
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,915
...and you...

870
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,542
...push it all the way through.

871
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,127
Like that.

872
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:34,005
Wait a second.
Get it through the eyes, here.

873
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,924
- Right through here.
- In the eye?

874
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:38,426
Don't worry about it! He's dead, Martini.

875
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:41,721
Jesus Christ, just put it
through his eyeball, here.

876
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,389
That's it.

877
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:46,476
Crunch it right through.
All right. Now you got it, see?

878
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:49,604
Now, you just pull that baby through.
You see what I mean?

879
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:53,316
And you wrap it around.
You pull this so it's a little loop.

880
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,692
That's very good.

881
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,111
That's very good, Mr. Fredrickson!

882
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,404
Very good eye work.

883
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,114
Good eye work.

884
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:04,118
That little devil's gonna
not even feel the sting, is he, boy?

885
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,288
That son of a gun
is going to bite on you, isn't he?

886
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,500
You got beautiful hair.

887
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,505
Thank you.

888
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,427
And you got...

889
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,932
...beautiful eyes.

890
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,310
Thank you.

891
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,732
Billy, what's the matter?
Fishing don't grab you?

892
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,823
They do.

893
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,742
Now, come on with me, over here.

894
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,787
I'm gonna give each
and every one of you a rod.

895
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,420
All right.

896
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,255
Here's your poles.

897
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,141
Here's your poles.

898
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:13,396
Now, just keep watching the tip here.
If you get a strike, let me know.

899
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,023
Understand?

900
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,734
Come on, Candy. Just keep fishing, guys!

901
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,612
Don't call me unless you get
something really big...

902
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:23,031
...you can't handle yourselves.

903
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,620
Keep on fishing!

904
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:32,332
That's right.

905
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,366
Where is everybody?

906
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,839
Cheswick! Goddamn it, I told you to...

907
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,633
...steer that boat straight!

908
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,640
Fish! Help, help!

909
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:35,937
Goddamn it, he's got a fish. Hold it!
Wait a minute, Tabes. I got it!

910
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,440
Cheswick, get the fuck back up there!
Get up there in front!

911
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,526
Tabes, I got it, Tabes!

912
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,445
Get up, Tabes, I'll get it for you!

913
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,740
Son of a bitch, he's going over here!
Get up there!

914
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,742
I got it!

915
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,748
I got it! Give it to me!

916
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,251
Hey, Harding, I'm the skipper of this boat.

917
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,544
Shut up!

918
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,255
He said to go straight out as an arrow.

919
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,049
You're not going straight, you're kind of...

920
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:08,261
I'm going straight enough.
Now, Chessy, stop it!

921
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,347
- It's my duty!
- Chessy, stop it!

922
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,812
No, you son of a bitch!

923
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,066
All right, Martini.

924
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,861
All right, take him over!

925
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,863
Take him over!

926
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,365
That's it! Now play them, boys!

927
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:32,160
You sons of bitches!

928
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,038
Keep it straight!

929
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,665
Come back this way!

930
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,659
Home safe and sound. Didn't lose a nut!

931
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,245
Beats bowling, you know what I mean?

932
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:18,957
We caught it, look!

933
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:23,253
They're gonna be trolling this place
for six months looking for dead bodies!

934
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,261
They're gonna be trolling this place
for six months looking for dead bodies!

935
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,179
I think he's dangerous.

936
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:34,931
He's not crazy...

937
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:36,891
...but he's dangerous.

938
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,143
You don't think he's crazy?

939
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,061
No, he's not crazy.

940
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,149
Dr. Songee?

941
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,652
I don't think he's overly psychotic.

942
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:51,281
But I still think he's quite sick.

943
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:54,242
- Do you think he's dangerous?
- Absolutely so.

944
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,873
Well, John, what do you want
to do with him?

945
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,461
I think we've had our turn.

946
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:09,549
I'd like to send him back
to the work farm, frankly.

947
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,470
Is there anybody that you have...

948
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,890
...on your staff, that could...

949
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,476
...relate to him? Maybe understand him.

950
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,270
Help him out with some of these problems?

951
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:25,648
The funny thing is that
the person that he's the closest to...

952
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,234
...is the one he dislikes the most.

953
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,778
That's you, Mildred.

954
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:35,366
Well, gentlemen, in my opinion,
if we send him back to Pendleton or...

955
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,161
...we send him up to Disturbed...

956
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:42,165
...it's just one more way of passing on
our problem to somebody else.

957
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,752
You know, we don't like to do that.

958
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:50,173
So I'd like to keep him on the ward.

959
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,468
I think we can help him.

960
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,264
I think we can help him.

961
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,266
Chief, Chief, come on.

962
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,269
Come with me, huh?

963
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,564
Chief, this is the spot.

964
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,777
Right there is the spot. Remember?

965
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,196
Raise the hands, in the basket.

966
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,698
That's it. Raise the hands up.

967
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:19,577
All right! Let's have a little ball
from you nuts in here! Here we go!

968
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,664
All right! Let's play some ball, nuts.
Let's make some moves!

969
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,582
Hey, Mac, Mac. Time, time, time.

970
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,085
You've got six men on the court.

971
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,713
Harding, out of the ball game.

972
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,383
Hey, why me?

973
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,760
Because I'm the coach. I'll put you in later.

974
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,679
I don't trust you.

975
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,058
I'll go.

976
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,854
Okay, good boy, Billy.
I'll put you in in a minute, all right?

977
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:50,191
Let's play ball. Harding, break over there.

978
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,110
All right, Martini, get it back. Back!

979
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,987
I'm in the open! What are you doing?

980
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,905
You threw the goddamn ball into the fence!

981
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,283
Christ Almighty, you threw
the ball into the fence!

982
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,785
There's nobody there! We're playing ball!

983
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:05,081
All right, come on, get in the game.
Defense, nobody's doing nothing here!

984
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:07,667
- For Christ's sake!
- Hey, Mac, I'm open! I'm open!

985
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,753
Harding, give it back.
Back to me, Harding! Here.

986
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,714
I'm open.
Harding, will you give me the ball?

987
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:15,175
-Stop dribbling the goddamn ball!
-I got it!

988
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:17,093
Harding, over here.

989
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,596
Oh, for Christ's sake. I'm standing..

990
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,514
- You were covered!
- I was open!

991
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:23,975
Just give me the ball.
They're making all over the..

992
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:26,269
I was open. Give me the ball.

993
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:30,190
- You were covered, Mac.
- I wasn't covered. Somebody get back!

994
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:33,776
Give it to me! Give it to me!

995
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:37,614
Chief! Thatta baby, put it in!

996
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,496
Get down there!

997
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,793
Get down there, Chief! All right, all right.

998
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:55,924
Get around, Chief!

999
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,513
No, no, no. Get down there, Chief!

1000
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:04,057
The ball's in play! Ball's in play!

1001
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,185
- That's bullshit!
- Ball's in play.

1002
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:10,313
Oh, fuck that shit! You've got to be crazy.

1003
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,483
Man, that doesn't go!
Get that ball in and play!

1004
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,820
Come on, Chief! Put it in!

1005
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,998
What a ball club!

1006
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,209
What a ball club!

1007
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,195
McMurphy, get off the side.

1008
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,907
- Come on, move it, man!
- Hey, damn it!

1009
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,410
Quick! Come on, go ahead.

1010
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,413
Go ahead.

1011
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,583
Go ahead.

1012
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:16,087
I'll be seeing you on the outside.
You know what I mean?

1013
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:18,798
By the time you get out of here...

1014
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,301
...you'll be too old to even get it up.

1015
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,386
Sixty-eight days, buddy.

1016
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,096
Sixty-eight days.

1017
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,891
What the fuck you talking about, 68 days!

1018
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,310
That's in jail, sucker.

1019
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,396
You still don't know where you're at?

1020
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,316
Yeah, where am I at, Washington?

1021
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,735
With us, baby, you're with us.

1022
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:42,113
And you're gonna stay with us
until we let you go.

1023
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:50,288
And you're gonna stay with us
until we let you go.

1024
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:54,209
Do you want to say something
to the group, Mr. McMurphy?

1025
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:02,717
I'd like to know why none of the guys
never told me that you...

1026
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:05,803
...Miss Ratched...

1027
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:10,308
...and the doctors could keep me here till
you're good and ready to turn me loose.

1028
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,937
That's what I'd like to know.

1029
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,481
Fine, Randall, that's a good start.

1030
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,943
Would anyone care
to answer Mr. McMurphy?

1031
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,613
Answer what?

1032
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,824
You heard me, Harding.

1033
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:28,326
You let me go on hassling
Nurse Ratched here...

1034
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:32,121
...knowing how much I had to lose
and you never told me nothing!

1035
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,541
Now, Mac, wait a minute.

1036
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:37,001
Wait a minute, I didn't know anything
about how much..

1037
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,420
- Shit!
- Wait a minute. Listen.

1038
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:40,713
Now, look...

1039
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,800
I'm voluntary here, see?
I'm not committed.

1040
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:49,597
I don't have to stay here.
I mean, I can go home anytime I want.

1041
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,309
You can go home anytime you want?

1042
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,812
- That's it.
- You're bullshitting me!

1043
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:58,106
He's bullshitting me, right?

1044
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:01,109
No, Randall, he's telling you the truth.

1045
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:06,030
As a matter of fact, there are
very few men here who are committed.

1046
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,324
There's Mr. Bromden.

1047
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,826
Mr. Taber.

1048
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,246
Some of the chronics, and you.

1049
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,129
Cheswick?

1050
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,923
You're voluntary?

1051
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,846
Scanlon?

1052
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:37,020
Billy, for Christ's sake,
you must be committed, right?

1053
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,730
No, no, no.

1054
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:45,236
You're just a young kid!

1055
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:48,323
What are you doing here?
You ought to be out in a convertible...

1056
01:12:48,323 --> 01:12:50,241
...bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver.

1057
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,744
What are you doing here, for Christ's sake?

1058
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:55,038
What's so funny about that?

1059
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,626
Jesus, I mean, you guys do nothing
but complain about how you can't...

1060
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:03,421
...stand it in this place, and then
you haven't got the guts to walk out?

1061
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:07,258
What do you think you are,
for Christ's sake? Crazy or something?

1062
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:11,346
Well, you're not. You're not!

1063
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:14,599
You're no crazier than the average asshole
walking around on the streets.

1064
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:16,351
And that's it.

1065
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,646
Jesus Christ, I can't believe it!

1066
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:28,238
Those are very challenging observations
you made, Randall.

1067
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,326
I'm sure some of the men
would like to comment.

1068
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,706
Mr. Scanlon?

1069
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:43,628
I want to know why the dorm is locked
in the daytime and on weekends.

1070
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,847
I would like to know about our cigarettes.

1071
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:59,018
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

1072
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,147
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick,
and wait your turn.

1073
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:07,277
Go ahead, sit down!

1074
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:18,163
To answer your question
about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon...

1075
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:19,747
You know very well...

1076
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:24,335
...that if we left the door open, you'd just
go right back to bed after breakfast.

1077
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:26,337
Am I right?

1078
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:28,047
So what?

1079
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,967
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

1080
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,844
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.

1081
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:35,930
Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?

1082
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,849
For Christ's sake!

1083
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:41,936
Cigarettes!

1084
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:48,443
Remember, Mr. Scanlon,
we've discussed many times...

1085
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:52,238
...that time spent in the company
of others is very therapeutic.

1086
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:56,951
While time spent brooding alone
only increases a feeling of separation.

1087
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,162
You remember that, don't you?

1088
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:01,164
Do you mean to say...

1089
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,167
...it's sick to want to be off by yourself?

1090
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,877
Miss Ratched?

1091
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,547
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down!

1092
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,842
- I want to know about...
- Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.

1093
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,552
I want to...

1094
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:17,263
Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?

1095
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,057
It's my last one.

1096
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:22,852
That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?

1097
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,355
Look, I'm not running a charity ward, see?

1098
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:26,648
Come on!

1099
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:29,150
Look, I don't want his cigarettes.

1100
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,945
And I don't want his, or his, or his...

1101
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:34,531
...or his, or his, or his...

1102
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:37,075
Or even yours.

1103
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:39,160
Do you understand that?

1104
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,746
I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched!

1105
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:44,165
I want my cigarettes!

1106
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,376
I want mine, Miss Ratched!

1107
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:49,170
What gives you the damn right...

1108
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:52,465
...to keep our cigarettes
piled up on your desk...

1109
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:56,678
...and to squeeze out a pack
only when you feel like it, huh?

1110
01:15:58,555 --> 01:16:00,849
- Miss Ratched!
- Mr. Harding!

1111
01:16:04,144 --> 01:16:05,436
Oh, I'm sorry.

1112
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:08,481
- You surprise me.
- I lost my head. I'm sorry.

1113
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:10,483
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

1114
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,360
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1115
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:15,780
I didn't mean to.
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1116
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,866
It's all right.

1117
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:19,659
Miss Ratched!

1118
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:21,786
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

1119
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:23,746
I asked you a question!

1120
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:26,875
I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick...

1121
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:31,296
...and I will answer your question
as soon as you've calmed down.

1122
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,760
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?

1123
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:40,472
- I'm calm.
- Good.

1124
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:45,059
Now, as you all know, Mr. McMurphy...

1125
01:16:45,477 --> 01:16:49,189
...has been running
a small gambling casino in our tub room.

1126
01:16:49,856 --> 01:16:53,568
Now, most of you lost
all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...

1127
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:56,988
...not to mention a tidy sum of money
to Mr. McMurphy.

1128
01:16:58,573 --> 01:16:59,866
And that's why...

1129
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:03,161
...your tub room privileges
have been suspended...

1130
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:06,498
...and your cigarettes have been rationed.

1131
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:11,461
Mr. Martini?

1132
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,757
How are we going to win our money back?

1133
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:23,306
You're not going to win
your money back, Mr. Martini.

1134
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,475
That's all over.

1135
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:27,393
If you had obeyed the rules
in the first place...

1136
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:30,104
...you wouldn't have lost your money.

1137
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,575
Sit down, gentlemen!
Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down!

1138
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,583
Rules?

1139
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,086
Piss on your fucking rules, Miss Ratched!

1140
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:55,004
Sit down, will you, Cheswick!

1141
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,382
I want you to know something
right here and now, Miss Ratched!

1142
01:17:57,382 --> 01:18:01,094
- I ain't no little kid! I ain't no little kid!
- You sit down!

1143
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:04,264
Where you're going to have cigarettes
kept from me like cookies...

1144
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:06,766
And I want something done!
Ain't that right, Mac?

1145
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,685
That's right! Will you sit down!

1146
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:10,687
No, I won't! I won't!

1147
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,106
I want something done!

1148
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:15,567
- Sit down!
- I want something done!

1149
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:17,569
I want something done!

1150
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,362
I want something done!

1151
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:21,281
I want something done!

1152
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:23,783
I want something done!

1153
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:27,996
- Here!
- I want something done!

1154
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:29,998
Goddamn it, Cheswick, here!

1155
01:18:29,998 --> 01:18:31,791
Hey, calm down!

1156
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:35,879
Why don't you leave him alone,
Washington? He's going to be all right!

1157
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,556
Emergency...

1158
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:48,391
...34-B.

1159
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:52,896
I'll break your fucking back!

1160
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:02,197
Forget it, Mac! It's all over, McMurphy!

1161
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:06,409
Warren!

1162
01:19:20,882 --> 01:19:22,300
Warren!

1163
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:48,409
Would you move, please?
We need this chair.

1164
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,912
Just move right over there, okay.

1165
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,710
I see we have Mr. Bromden back.
Yeah, okay.

1166
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:05,301
- How do you do, Mr. McMurphy?
- I do real fine.

1167
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:07,804
I know you didn't do anything wrong.
Just sit down.

1168
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:09,722
We're not going to hurt you.
Sit down, right here.

1169
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,015
That's it.

1170
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,393
Nurse, this is Mr. Cheswick.
He's a little upset.

1171
01:20:13,393 --> 01:20:15,895
Okay, fine. Thank you very much.

1172
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:18,398
- You'll be okay, Mr. Cheswick.
- Yes.

1173
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:21,109
Would you keep an eye on these three?

1174
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:14,412
Would you please take these, gentlemen?

1175
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:16,706
He can't hear nothing.

1176
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:26,341
Calm down, Ches, will you?

1177
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:29,427
Mr. Cheswick, would you please follow me?

1178
01:21:32,222 --> 01:21:33,932
Mr. Cheswick?

1179
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:41,606
- No!
- Nobody's going to hurt you, come on.

1180
01:21:41,606 --> 01:21:43,817
- No!
- It'll be all right.

1181
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,027
No one's going to hurt you.

1182
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:47,320
No, leave me alone!

1183
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,823
- Take it easy on yourself. Come on!
- No! Mac!

1184
01:21:49,823 --> 01:21:51,324
Mac! Mac!

1185
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:53,618
No!

1186
01:21:53,535 --> 01:21:55,954
Come on. Come on, now. Come on.

1187
01:21:56,621 --> 01:21:58,414
- Come on.
- No!

1188
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,542
I didn't do nothing!

1189
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,293
Mac!

1190
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:06,422
- Come on.
- I won't go! I don't want to go!

1191
01:22:29,237 --> 01:22:30,947
Want some gum?

1192
01:22:34,826 --> 01:22:36,327
Thank you.

1193
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:00,226
Juicy Fruit.

1194
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:05,356
You sly son of a bitch, Chief.

1195
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:11,821
Can you hear me, too?

1196
01:23:12,322 --> 01:23:14,032
Yeah, you bet!

1197
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,659
Well, I'll be goddamned, Chief!

1198
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:23,124
And they all, they all think
you're deaf and dumb.

1199
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:26,544
Jesus Christ!

1200
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,715
You fooled them, Chief.

1201
01:23:31,132 --> 01:23:33,635
You fooled them. You fooled them all!

1202
01:23:33,635 --> 01:23:35,220
Goddamn you!

1203
01:23:39,224 --> 01:23:41,726
What are we doing in here, Chief?

1204
01:23:43,645 --> 01:23:46,856
What's us, two guys,
doing in this fucking place?

1205
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,241
Let's get out of here.

1206
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:58,743
Out.

1207
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:05,041
Canada?

1208
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:07,418
Canada.

1209
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:11,256
We'll be there before these
sons of bitches know what hit 'em.

1210
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:16,052
Listen to Randall on this one.

1211
01:24:36,865 --> 01:24:38,575
Mr. McMurphy?

1212
01:24:39,367 --> 01:24:41,161
Please follow me.

1213
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,458
You and me, Chief.

1214
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:02,515
Take a cigarette break, boys. Easy.

1215
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,270
I'll be fine.

1216
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:16,863
Would you sit up, please?

1217
01:25:16,863 --> 01:25:18,781
- I'd love to.
- Thatta boy.

1218
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:22,535
There might be a little fluid in them boots,
you know what I mean, boys?

1219
01:25:22,452 --> 01:25:24,370
Just a little leak.

1220
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:26,873
A light shine, boys, and...

1221
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:29,584
...send the specimen to Nurse Ratched.

1222
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,094
All right, out with your gum.

1223
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,888
Out with your gum.

1224
01:25:45,642 --> 01:25:49,229
Okay, this won't hurt,
and it'll be over in just a moment.

1225
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:51,648
- What's that?
- Conductant.

1226
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:53,775
A little dab will do you.

1227
01:25:53,775 --> 01:25:55,693
Right, Mr. Jackson?

1228
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:58,071
Open your mouth.

1229
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:01,866
- What's that?
- This'll keep you from biting your tongue.

1230
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:04,077
Now just bite down on it.

1231
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:06,287
That's right. Just bite down.

1232
01:26:06,246 --> 01:26:08,248
Now, bite down on it.

1233
01:26:14,379 --> 01:26:16,089
Are you ready?

1234
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:20,343
Here we go.

1235
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:51,332
Here we go.

1236
01:26:51,374 --> 01:26:53,376
Now, one big breath.

1237
01:26:58,256 --> 01:26:59,757
Very good.

1238
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:07,056
Gentlemen, I'd like to begin today.
It shouldn't take too long.

1239
01:27:08,975 --> 01:27:10,268
Jim?

1240
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:12,061
It's been brought to my attention...

1241
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:15,648
...that you've been giving Mr. Fredrickson
your medication.

1242
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:17,484
Is that true?

1243
01:27:23,281 --> 01:27:24,782
No, ma'am.

1244
01:27:25,783 --> 01:27:27,076
Jim?

1245
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:30,747
Are you giving your medication
to Mr. Fredrickson...

1246
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:32,707
...or are you not?

1247
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:10,662
How about it, you creeps,
you lunatics, mental defectives.

1248
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:15,166
Let's hear it for Bullgoose Randall,
back in action. Nice shirt, Cheseroo.

1249
01:28:18,378 --> 01:28:20,296
Look at the faces on you!

1250
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:21,881
Look at you!

1251
01:28:22,799 --> 01:28:25,510
The feeb's brigade, you ding-a-lings!

1252
01:28:26,469 --> 01:28:29,264
The mental defective league in formation.

1253
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:34,102
How are you, Nurse Ratched?
I'm happy to be back.

1254
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:37,105
We're happy to have you back, Randall.

1255
01:28:37,188 --> 01:28:38,690
Thank you.

1256
01:28:38,982 --> 01:28:42,902
Would you like to rest today,
or would you like to join the group?

1257
01:28:43,987 --> 01:28:46,406
I'd love to join the group...

1258
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:47,782
I'd like...

1259
01:28:47,782 --> 01:28:50,493
I'm proud to join the group, Mildred.

1260
01:28:51,494 --> 01:28:53,496
How's it going, Mac?

1261
01:28:53,997 --> 01:28:55,915
Perfect, Billy Boy, absolutely perfect.

1262
01:28:55,874 --> 01:28:59,586
They were giving me 10,000 watts a day,
you know, and I'm...

1263
01:28:59,711 --> 01:29:01,004
...hot to trot.

1264
01:29:00,879 --> 01:29:03,965
The next woman who takes me on
will light up like a pinball machine...

1265
01:29:04,007 --> 01:29:06,509
...and pay off in silver dollars!

1266
01:29:10,305 --> 01:29:12,223
That's an amusing thought, Randall...

1267
01:29:12,182 --> 01:29:15,268
...but when you came in
we were talking to Jim.

1268
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:18,104
He has a problem with his medication...

1269
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:19,689
...and we'd like to get back to that.

1270
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:23,193
Oh, I don't... I don't mind at all,
Nurse Ratched, I'm...

1271
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:26,696
...as gentle as a puppy dog and...

1272
01:29:27,197 --> 01:29:29,407
Please proceed. Thank you.

1273
01:29:30,909 --> 01:29:33,411
The administration was hopeful,
but cautious Friday...

1274
01:29:33,411 --> 01:29:34,829
...in its reaction...

1275
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:37,790
...in its reaction...

1276
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:37,290
...to a possible opening of the Berlin Wall...

1277
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:40,084
...during the upcoming Christmas holiday.

1278
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:44,172
Good night, gentlemen.
See you in the morning.

1279
01:31:09,924 --> 01:31:11,843
Yeah, baby, it's Mac.

1280
01:31:11,801 --> 01:31:13,595
It's on tonight.

1281
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,013
Don't worry about it.

1282
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:17,432
Don't worry about it. Get a car.

1283
01:31:18,016 --> 01:31:21,311
I don't give a shit, baby.
Steal it if you have to!

1284
01:31:21,811 --> 01:31:23,897
I gotta go! I gotta go!

1285
01:31:24,314 --> 01:31:25,607
Don't forget to bring some booze.

1286
01:31:25,523 --> 01:31:26,816
Right.

1287
01:31:26,816 --> 01:31:28,109
Bye.

1288
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:24,249
Chief, I can't take it no more.

1289
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:27,710
I gotta get out of here.

1290
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,842
I can't. I just can't.

1291
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:38,138
It's easier than you think, Chief.

1292
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:42,433
For you, maybe.
You're a lot bigger than me.

1293
01:32:45,019 --> 01:32:48,523
Why, Chief, you're about as big
as a goddamn tree trunk.

1294
01:32:54,445 --> 01:32:56,447
My poppa's real big.

1295
01:32:58,116 --> 01:33:00,201
He did like he pleased.

1296
01:33:00,618 --> 01:33:03,204
That's why everybody worked on him.

1297
01:33:06,249 --> 01:33:10,545
The last time I've seen my father
he was blind in the cedars from drinking.

1298
01:33:11,337 --> 01:33:14,424
And every time he put
the bottle to his mouth...

1299
01:33:14,424 --> 01:33:16,718
...he don't suck out of it.

1300
01:33:16,926 --> 01:33:19,846
It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk so...

1301
01:33:20,638 --> 01:33:24,058
...wrinkled and yellow,
even the dogs don't know him.

1302
01:33:25,018 --> 01:33:26,811
Killed him, huh?

1303
01:33:28,855 --> 01:33:31,274
I'm not saying they killed him.

1304
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:35,445
They just worked on him,
the way they're working on you.

1305
01:33:44,454 --> 01:33:46,456
There they are, Chief.

1306
01:33:46,956 --> 01:33:49,250
There they are. They're here.

1307
01:34:03,848 --> 01:34:05,767
Over here. That's it!

1308
01:34:05,725 --> 01:34:07,644
McMurphy, stop all this Holy Roller shit...

1309
01:34:07,644 --> 01:34:10,939
...and get your ass back in bed.
Do you understand?

1310
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:15,944
My prayers have been answered, Turkle.

1311
01:34:16,361 --> 01:34:18,154
Come on and see.

1312
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:28,122
You'd take $20...

1313
01:34:28,832 --> 01:34:32,544
...to get down on your knees and pray,
wouldn't you, Turkle?

1314
01:34:33,253 --> 01:34:35,171
No, it don't send me, don't send me.

1315
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:37,048
- It don't?
- Don't do nothing to me, no.

1316
01:34:37,048 --> 01:34:39,551
Well, you know there'll be more.

1317
01:34:41,344 --> 01:34:45,140
I mean, they'll be bringing
a couple of bottles with them, and...

1318
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,852
You're getting closer, brother.
You're getting closer, but...

1319
01:34:49,561 --> 01:34:53,481
...they're going to be sharing
more than just bottles, ain't they?

1320
01:34:53,857 --> 01:34:55,775
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, sure.

1321
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:57,652
- I know what you mean.
- Understand what I mean?

1322
01:34:57,652 --> 01:35:00,155
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

1323
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:03,241
- Anything you say, Turkle.
- I'm on my knees, brother.

1324
01:35:03,241 --> 01:35:06,327
- I'm on my knees.
- Yeah, all right, all right.

1325
01:35:10,165 --> 01:35:13,251
- Let me just give them a hand here.
- I appreciate that.

1326
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:14,961
- Hi.
- Ladies!

1327
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:18,256
Oh, thank you. I believe this is
your department, Mr. Turkle.

1328
01:35:18,256 --> 01:35:20,758
- Hi, there! Give me a hand.
- How're you doing?

1329
01:35:20,758 --> 01:35:22,844
Love to give you a hand.

1330
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,889
Keep it down. Keep it down.

1331
01:35:25,763 --> 01:35:28,266
- I split my pants.
- Keep it down!

1332
01:35:28,266 --> 01:35:31,978
- Give it to me. Give it all to me.
- You got to keep it down!

1333
01:35:34,564 --> 01:35:36,983
This looks like my high school.

1334
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:40,361
Oh, hey, I take that.

1335
01:35:40,862 --> 01:35:42,780
- The barber chair.
- You may have it.

1336
01:35:42,655 --> 01:35:43,948
It is mine, mine.

1337
01:35:43,948 --> 01:35:46,743
You can have it. You can have it, honey.

1338
01:35:48,369 --> 01:35:52,290
- Take a load of these tubs.
- It's a real nice place you got here.

1339
01:35:53,374 --> 01:35:55,293
Hey, can I take a bath?

1340
01:35:55,168 --> 01:35:57,670
Sure, you can take a bath. Sure.

1341
01:35:58,379 --> 01:36:00,298
Just don't drown your pretty little self.

1342
01:36:00,173 --> 01:36:01,758
You know...

1343
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:05,470
...Rose was married to a maniac once,
up in Beaverton.

1344
01:36:07,055 --> 01:36:08,848
Oh, really, miss?

1345
01:36:08,973 --> 01:36:10,266
What seemed to be the problem?

1346
01:36:10,266 --> 01:36:13,770
Oh, nothing, he used to put frogs
in my bra all the time.

1347
01:36:17,065 --> 01:36:18,858
Very interesting.

1348
01:36:18,983 --> 01:36:20,777
Very interesting.

1349
01:36:23,363 --> 01:36:27,158
Rose is very interested in hospitaIs,
and hospital facilities.

1350
01:36:27,075 --> 01:36:29,494
- I am?
-Yes. Oh, yes, you are.

1351
01:36:30,245 --> 01:36:32,163
- I'm going to take Miss Candy..
- Where you going?

1352
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,582
I'm gonna take Candy for a stroll.

1353
01:36:34,582 --> 01:36:36,501
I got you, I got you.

1354
01:36:36,459 --> 01:36:40,463
- But just don't make too much noise.
- Oh, no, not a peep, not a peep.

1355
01:36:43,383 --> 01:36:46,469
Now, you come over here, baby,
right over here.

1356
01:36:49,681 --> 01:36:52,976
Don't worry about Candy, honey.
Sit down and relax.

1357
01:36:53,852 --> 01:36:57,147
Don't worry about Candy, honey.
Sit down and relax.

1358
01:37:05,155 --> 01:37:06,865
Wake up, boys.

1359
01:37:07,073 --> 01:37:08,575
Wake up.

1360
01:37:08,867 --> 01:37:10,869
It's medication time.

1361
01:37:12,078 --> 01:37:13,872
Medication time.

1362
01:37:14,581 --> 01:37:16,499
The nighttime spirits are here.

1363
01:37:16,374 --> 01:37:18,793
It's Randall to say goodbye...

1364
01:37:18,877 --> 01:37:22,088
...and get you high,
and nighttime angel, Candy.

1365
01:37:24,591 --> 01:37:27,886
That's right, Mr. Martini,
there is an Easter bunny.

1366
01:37:37,687 --> 01:37:39,606
Round the side, boys, join Mr. McMurphy...

1367
01:37:39,564 --> 01:37:42,150
...in the executive lounge, please.

1368
01:37:42,692 --> 01:37:44,486
Round the side.

1369
01:37:47,697 --> 01:37:49,908
It's going to be so great.

1370
01:37:50,992 --> 01:37:55,997
It's going to be so great.

1371
01:37:50,992 --> 01:37:51,576
You'd like a nip, Charles?

1372
01:37:51,576 --> 01:37:53,495
No trouble at all!

1373
01:37:54,078 --> 01:37:57,582
It's Billy the Club of the fabulous
and fantastic 14...

1374
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,419
- What the hell's going on?
- Mr. Turkle...

1375
01:38:04,088 --> 01:38:05,381
Ain't this a bitch!

1376
01:38:05,381 --> 01:38:09,093
McMurphy, what're you trying to do?
Get my ass really fired?

1377
01:38:09,093 --> 01:38:12,096
Come on, get your ass out of here.
Come on.

1378
01:38:12,263 --> 01:38:13,556
We're just having a party.

1379
01:38:13,473 --> 01:38:17,060
Party, my ass! This ain't no nightclub,
this is a hospital!

1380
01:38:17,268 --> 01:38:21,481
Man, this is my fucking job!
I don't give a damn, this is my fucking job!

1381
01:38:22,899 --> 01:38:25,109
Oh, shit! The supervisor!

1382
01:38:25,401 --> 01:38:26,694
Get your asses back in there.

1383
01:38:26,694 --> 01:38:28,780
Come on. Come on there!

1384
01:38:29,197 --> 01:38:31,699
Where's that no-talking son of a bitch?
Is he in there?

1385
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,409
Good. Come on.

1386
01:38:58,601 --> 01:39:00,186
Mr. Turkle?

1387
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:05,775
Mr. Turkle?

1388
01:39:07,277 --> 01:39:10,280
Where the hell is he?
Why doesn't he answer?

1389
01:39:11,698 --> 01:39:13,616
He's jerking off somewhere.

1390
01:39:13,575 --> 01:39:16,077
Ain't nobody jerking off nowhere,
motherfucker!

1391
01:39:16,077 --> 01:39:19,164
Turkle, what the fuck are you doing here?
Go out and talk to her!

1392
01:39:19,205 --> 01:39:22,792
Doing the same fucking thing
you're doing in here, hiding!

1393
01:39:26,087 --> 01:39:27,672
Yes, ma'am?

1394
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:30,508
Is everything all right, Mr. Turkle?

1395
01:39:30,508 --> 01:39:33,011
Oh, everything is just fine, ma'am.

1396
01:39:33,011 --> 01:39:35,013
Just fine. Just fine.

1397
01:39:44,189 --> 01:39:45,773
Who's there?

1398
01:39:46,107 --> 01:39:48,026
Ain't nobody in there.

1399
01:39:47,984 --> 01:39:49,986
Please open that door.

1400
01:39:56,701 --> 01:39:58,203
I'm sorry.

1401
01:40:02,415 --> 01:40:04,501
I'm sorry, ma'am, but...

1402
01:40:04,918 --> 01:40:08,213
...you know, a man gets
awfully lonesome at night.

1403
01:40:08,588 --> 01:40:11,090
You understand what I mean, don't you?

1404
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:13,593
You understand? I'm sure you understand.

1405
01:40:13,593 --> 01:40:16,596
I want that woman off this ward,
immediately.

1406
01:40:18,598 --> 01:40:19,891
Yes, ma'am.

1407
01:40:19,891 --> 01:40:21,476
Yes, ma'am.

1408
01:40:41,788 --> 01:40:43,706
- Jesus!
- Mr. Turkle, is she gone?

1409
01:40:43,623 --> 01:40:45,542
Shit! Yes, she's gone, and so am l...

1410
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:48,002
...so get your behinds out of here
and go to bed.

1411
01:40:48,002 --> 01:40:50,505
Go ahead, move it, move it! Move it!

1412
01:40:50,505 --> 01:40:52,423
- I knew we were in trouble!
- Let's go!

1413
01:40:52,423 --> 01:40:55,510
You and your teddy bear ass!
Move them on out of here!

1414
01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:56,803
Come on, come on!

1415
01:40:56,803 --> 01:40:58,721
- Candy?
- Come on, Candy!

1416
01:40:58,721 --> 01:41:00,431
Jesus Christ!

1417
01:41:01,224 --> 01:41:03,143
Mr. Turkle, I'm really sorry.

1418
01:41:03,017 --> 01:41:05,520
Tell those fucking friends of mine
to get out!

1419
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,438
- Get out!
- I'm really sorry.

1420
01:41:07,397 --> 01:41:08,690
What are you..?

1421
01:41:08,731 --> 01:41:10,650
What the fuck..? Get out of here!

1422
01:41:10,525 --> 01:41:14,320
Please get out, this is my job!
You're fucking it up! You understand?

1423
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:15,822
Get out!

1424
01:41:16,197 --> 01:41:18,992
Get out of here, you slim motherfucker!

1425
01:41:20,618 --> 01:41:22,120
Fuck it!

1426
01:41:23,705 --> 01:41:24,789
Fuck it!

1427
01:41:24,831 --> 01:41:26,332
Fuck it!

1428
01:41:35,425 --> 01:41:38,720
Good night, good night,
don't Iet the cooties bite.

1429
01:42:06,706 --> 01:42:09,209
Right out of the shock department.
I got it from...

1430
01:42:09,209 --> 01:42:11,127
I got it from Ratched's charts.

1431
01:42:11,127 --> 01:42:13,630
Right. There you go, there you go.
Easy now.

1432
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:15,548
Don't take it all at once!

1433
01:42:15,507 --> 01:42:18,426
Let's try a little over here. There you go.

1434
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:05,241
Let's go.

1435
01:44:10,622 --> 01:44:13,041
I'll have to be the one, Chief.

1436
01:44:30,058 --> 01:44:32,268
Hey, Mac, what's going on?

1437
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:33,853
Well, Dale...

1438
01:44:33,728 --> 01:44:36,439
...Lord Randall is stepping down one.

1439
01:44:36,856 --> 01:44:38,441
Fredrickson.

1440
01:44:40,652 --> 01:44:42,070
Jimmy.

1441
01:44:42,529 --> 01:44:44,447
Aren't you gonna say goodbye to me, Mac?

1442
01:44:44,364 --> 01:44:47,367
Sure, I'm gonna say
goodbye to you, Charles.

1443
01:44:50,036 --> 01:44:51,830
Thank you, Mac.

1444
01:44:51,955 --> 01:44:53,456
Thank you.

1445
01:44:53,748 --> 01:44:55,750
I'll never forget you.

1446
01:44:55,834 --> 01:44:58,837
I'll never forget you.

1447
01:44:55,834 --> 01:44:58,336
Settle down, Charles, all right.

1448
01:45:00,255 --> 01:45:02,465
Hey, Billy, what's wrong?

1449
01:45:03,967 --> 01:45:06,177
Billy, for Christ's sake?

1450
01:45:09,639 --> 01:45:11,558
What's the matter?

1451
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:17,480
I'm gonna miss you very...

1452
01:45:18,356 --> 01:45:20,441
...very, very much, Mac.

1453
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:26,573
Why don't you come with us, then?

1454
01:45:28,366 --> 01:45:30,285
Think I don't want to?

1455
01:45:30,243 --> 01:45:32,537
Well, come on then, let's go.

1456
01:45:32,745 --> 01:45:34,956
Well, it's not that easy.

1457
01:45:39,043 --> 01:45:40,962
I'm not ready yet.

1458
01:45:45,258 --> 01:45:46,551
Tell you what we'll do...

1459
01:45:46,551 --> 01:45:49,053
When I get to Canada,
I'll write you a postcard...

1460
01:45:49,053 --> 01:45:51,556
...and I'll put my address on it.

1461
01:45:51,556 --> 01:45:54,058
That way when you're ready, you'll...

1462
01:45:54,058 --> 01:45:55,351
...you'll know where to go.

1463
01:45:55,268 --> 01:45:57,061
What do you say?

1464
01:46:04,652 --> 01:46:06,654
Is she going with you?

1465
01:46:12,869 --> 01:46:14,287
Candy?

1466
01:46:16,581 --> 01:46:20,376
Yeah, she'll be there when you get there.
She's going with us.

1467
01:46:21,544 --> 01:46:23,838
Are you going to marry her?

1468
01:46:25,965 --> 01:46:28,259
No, we're just good friends.

1469
01:46:29,677 --> 01:46:30,970
Why?

1470
01:46:37,852 --> 01:46:39,354
Nothing.

1471
01:46:40,355 --> 01:46:43,358
Don't "nothing" me, all right? What is it?

1472
01:46:54,077 --> 01:46:55,787
It's too late.

1473
01:46:59,082 --> 01:47:01,376
Do you want a date with her?

1474
01:47:02,877 --> 01:47:06,381
Jesus, I must be crazy
to be in a looney bin like this!

1475
01:47:08,466 --> 01:47:09,968
Date, huh?

1476
01:47:10,385 --> 01:47:13,888
Well, it'll have to be a fast date,
I'll tell you that.

1477
01:47:16,683 --> 01:47:18,184
Not now!

1478
01:47:18,476 --> 01:47:19,978
Not now?

1479
01:47:20,353 --> 01:47:21,938
When, then?

1480
01:47:29,779 --> 01:47:32,073
When I have a free weekend.

1481
01:47:32,282 --> 01:47:34,200
You're busy right now, are you?

1482
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:36,661
You've got something to do right now?

1483
01:47:36,661 --> 01:47:37,954
- You've got something to do?
- No.

1484
01:47:37,871 --> 01:47:41,458
Good, then don't talk to me about
when you're ready. Yeah.

1485
01:47:41,666 --> 01:47:43,585
- Ready and everything like that.
- No.

1486
01:47:43,585 --> 01:47:45,795
Candy, come here a minute.

1487
01:47:46,671 --> 01:47:49,174
Candy, I want you to meet
the famous Billy.

1488
01:47:49,174 --> 01:47:51,092
Go get him, will you?

1489
01:47:51,092 --> 01:47:53,595
Go get him. Get him out of there.

1490
01:47:54,179 --> 01:47:56,890
I want you to get a hold of Billy...

1491
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:01,102
All you gotta do is this one little thing.

1492
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:03,563
- The kid's cute, isn't he?
- Yeah.

1493
01:48:08,568 --> 01:48:10,862
Think of me the whole time.

1494
01:48:11,696 --> 01:48:13,281
There he is.

1495
01:48:13,573 --> 01:48:15,366
Billy the Club!

1496
01:48:21,664 --> 01:48:23,249
I got $25...

1497
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:27,462
...that says you are going to burn
this woman down!

1498
01:48:34,177 --> 01:48:35,887
Candy, baby...

1499
01:48:40,475 --> 01:48:42,185
...I love ya.

1500
01:48:42,393 --> 01:48:44,187
Hurl the ringer.

1501
01:48:48,608 --> 01:48:50,527
Take it easy! Back!

1502
01:48:53,571 --> 01:48:56,074
No, no, I'll show you some card tricks.

1503
01:48:56,074 --> 01:48:57,992
You ain't seen the Spanish deck yet.

1504
01:48:57,992 --> 01:49:00,411
That's 40 percent more torture.

1505
01:49:03,581 --> 01:49:07,502
I'm going to present you
with this fine deck of cards for playing.

1506
01:49:11,798 --> 01:49:15,301
This ain't gonna take long, Rose,
you know what I mean?

1507
01:49:24,894 --> 01:49:27,105
When we get to Canada...

1508
01:50:40,011 --> 01:50:42,222
When we get to Canada...

1509
01:51:13,795 --> 01:51:15,713
Out of sight, man!

1510
01:51:16,297 --> 01:51:18,007
Out of sight!

1511
01:51:35,024 --> 01:51:37,443
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1512
01:51:41,322 --> 01:51:42,615
Mr. Warren...

1513
01:51:42,532 --> 01:51:45,034
...close the window, and lock the screen.

1514
01:51:45,034 --> 01:51:46,452
Right.

1515
01:52:11,311 --> 01:52:14,397
Mr. Miller, show this woman
the way out of the hospital.

1516
01:52:14,439 --> 01:52:15,857
Gladly.

1517
01:52:17,609 --> 01:52:19,527
Come on, lady, let's go.

1518
01:52:19,527 --> 01:52:20,820
-You're going home.
- Where?

1519
01:52:20,737 --> 01:52:22,655
Let her go, Scanlon.

1520
01:52:22,614 --> 01:52:23,198
You're going home.

1521
01:52:23,239 --> 01:52:25,158
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes, Miss Ratched.

1522
01:52:25,116 --> 01:52:27,035
Make sure no one is missing.

1523
01:52:27,035 --> 01:52:28,536
Will do.

1524
01:52:29,537 --> 01:52:31,456
- Mac?
-Come on, Scanlon, let's move.

1525
01:52:31,331 --> 01:52:33,249
Everybody out of here!
Come on, move it out!

1526
01:52:33,208 --> 01:52:34,501
Come on, move it!

1527
01:52:34,542 --> 01:52:37,045
Martini, get your butt up! Come on, up!

1528
01:52:37,045 --> 01:52:38,963
All right, Colonel,
get your dead ass up there!

1529
01:52:38,838 --> 01:52:42,050
What the hell's going on here?
Come on, move out!

1530
01:52:50,141 --> 01:52:51,851
Miss Ratched?

1531
01:52:55,146 --> 01:52:56,439
Fredrickson, what are you doing?

1532
01:52:56,439 --> 01:52:58,358
Where you going? Back out here!

1533
01:52:58,233 --> 01:53:00,527
Let's go! Come on, move it!

1534
01:53:02,612 --> 01:53:03,905
Taber, get up. Come on.

1535
01:53:03,947 --> 01:53:05,740
I said, get up!

1536
01:53:08,952 --> 01:53:10,870
All right, move it back there! McMurphy...

1537
01:53:10,745 --> 01:53:14,165
...get your ass over here,
and bring Dracula with you.

1538
01:53:16,543 --> 01:53:17,836
...get your ass over here,
and bring Dracula with you.

1539
01:53:17,752 --> 01:53:19,963
Stay right there, Bancini!

1540
01:53:20,839 --> 01:53:22,757
- Miss Ratched?
- Yes.

1541
01:53:22,715 --> 01:53:25,218
It looks like Billy Bibbit's
the only one missing.

1542
01:53:25,218 --> 01:53:26,636
Billy?

1543
01:53:27,137 --> 01:53:29,722
- Thank you, Mr. Washington.
- Okay.

1544
01:53:30,849 --> 01:53:34,644
Did Billy Bibbit leave the grounds
of the hospital, gentlemen?

1545
01:53:39,023 --> 01:53:41,526
I want an answer to my question!

1546
01:53:42,152 --> 01:53:44,946
Did he leave the grounds of the hospital?

1547
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:59,669
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes.

1548
01:53:59,627 --> 01:54:02,130
Miss Pilbow, check all the rooms.

1549
01:54:02,755 --> 01:54:04,048
- Mr. Warren?
- Yes.

1550
01:54:04,048 --> 01:54:06,342
You start with the tub room.

1551
01:54:13,433 --> 01:54:15,018
Mr. Martini?

1552
01:54:15,935 --> 01:54:18,146
May I have my cap, please?

1553
01:54:18,438 --> 01:54:19,856
My cap!

1554
01:54:20,356 --> 01:54:21,649
My cap!

1555
01:54:21,524 --> 01:54:22,942
There.

1556
01:54:27,155 --> 01:54:28,656
Thank you.

1557
01:54:54,057 --> 01:54:55,767
Miss Ratched.

1558
01:55:46,067 --> 01:55:48,278
I can explain everything.

1559
01:55:49,154 --> 01:55:50,947
Please do, Billy.

1560
01:55:51,072 --> 01:55:52,991
Explain everything.

1561
01:55:56,661 --> 01:55:58,246
Everything?

1562
01:56:00,373 --> 01:56:02,292
Aren't you ashamed?

1563
01:56:04,752 --> 01:56:06,337
No, I'm not.

1564
01:56:16,681 --> 01:56:19,184
You know, Billy, what worries me is...

1565
01:56:19,184 --> 01:56:21,978
...how your mother's going to take this.

1566
01:56:31,654 --> 01:56:33,239
Well, you...

1567
01:56:34,157 --> 01:56:36,075
...don't have to...

1568
01:56:36,659 --> 01:56:38,870
...tell her, Miss Ratched.

1569
01:56:39,871 --> 01:56:42,081
I don't have to tell her?

1570
01:56:42,957 --> 01:56:46,169
Your mother and I are old friends,
you know that.

1571
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:56,971
Please...

1572
01:56:57,972 --> 01:56:59,557
...don't...

1573
01:56:59,891 --> 01:57:01,184
...tell my mother.

1574
01:57:01,059 --> 01:57:04,854
Don't you think you should've thought
of that before you took that woman...

1575
01:57:04,854 --> 01:57:06,648
...in that room?

1576
01:57:14,864 --> 01:57:16,282
No, no.

1577
01:57:22,372 --> 01:57:23,665
I didn't.

1578
01:57:23,581 --> 01:57:26,584
You mean, she dragged you
in there by force?

1579
01:57:40,473 --> 01:57:41,975
She did.

1580
01:57:46,187 --> 01:57:47,897
Everybody did.

1581
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:50,608
Everybody? Who did?

1582
01:57:51,776 --> 01:57:53,778
You tell me who did!

1583
01:58:13,673 --> 01:58:15,175
McMurphy.

1584
01:58:19,304 --> 01:58:21,097
Miss Ratched...

1585
01:58:23,099 --> 01:58:23,683
...please don't...

1586
01:58:23,683 --> 01:58:26,478
- Mr. Warren?
- ...tell my mother, please.

1587
01:58:26,769 --> 01:58:29,272
Would you see that the men
are washed and ready for the day.

1588
01:58:29,272 --> 01:58:31,774
Miss Ratched, please...please...

1589
01:58:34,277 --> 01:58:35,570
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes?

1590
01:58:35,570 --> 01:58:38,364
- Put Billy in Dr. Spivey's office.
- No.

1591
01:58:38,698 --> 01:58:41,409
Stay with him till the doctor arrives.

1592
01:58:46,206 --> 01:58:48,708
Move it! Come on, Martini, get on!

1593
01:59:02,806 --> 01:59:05,308
Move it! Come on, Martini, get on!

1594
01:59:12,106 --> 01:59:14,901
Hey, that way, please. Please, gentlemen.

1595
01:59:15,902 --> 01:59:18,404
Let's go, come on.
Come on, you guys. What is this?

1596
01:59:18,404 --> 01:59:19,906
Let's go.

1597
01:59:43,388 --> 01:59:45,682
Hey, what the hell is that?

1598
01:59:45,890 --> 01:59:48,601
McMurphy, what the hell are you doing?

1599
01:59:53,398 --> 01:59:56,401
Washington, to the day room!!
Immediately!!

1600
02:00:07,203 --> 02:00:09,998
Put down those keys and nobody gets hurt.

1601
02:00:19,716 --> 02:00:23,428
Move away from the window
and take that damn Chief with you.

1602
02:00:34,689 --> 02:00:36,608
Come on, let's go!

1603
02:00:45,325 --> 02:00:47,118
Let me through!

1604
02:00:47,202 --> 02:00:48,995
Let me through!

1605
02:00:59,714 --> 02:01:01,925
Out of the way, McMurphy!

1606
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:06,012
Come on, clear it!

1607
02:01:06,012 --> 02:01:08,306
Get these people out of here!

1608
02:01:08,515 --> 02:01:09,808
Oh, Billy!

1609
02:01:09,724 --> 02:01:11,017
Will you guys clear the door?

1610
02:01:11,017 --> 02:01:13,520
Everybody out! Out! Everybody out!

1611
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:15,522
Come on, goddamn it!

1612
02:01:18,525 --> 02:01:20,235
Now calm down!

1613
02:01:21,027 --> 02:01:24,113
The best thing we can do is
go on with our daily routine.

1614
02:01:24,113 --> 02:01:25,615
All right?

1615
02:01:32,914 --> 02:01:34,499
Don't! Mac!

1616
02:01:38,503 --> 02:01:40,004
Mac! No!

1617
02:02:11,619 --> 02:02:13,121
Mac! No!

1618
02:02:19,836 --> 02:02:21,754
And the bets are placed.

1619
02:02:21,629 --> 02:02:24,716
There's one for Tabes, and Chessy,
and Martini, and the dealer.

1620
02:02:24,841 --> 02:02:27,343
And a four to Tabes, and a six, and a nine...

1621
02:02:27,343 --> 02:02:29,637
...and a ten to the dealer.

1622
02:02:29,846 --> 02:02:31,139
A nine?

1623
02:02:31,014 --> 02:02:33,099
What do you say, Tabes?

1624
02:02:33,516 --> 02:02:35,310
A dime a piece.

1625
02:02:35,435 --> 02:02:37,145
No? You stick.

1626
02:02:37,312 --> 02:02:39,898
- He sticks.
- He sticks with a four.

1627
02:02:41,733 --> 02:02:43,651
Chessy's going for the ride.

1628
02:02:43,526 --> 02:02:45,445
What does that mean?

1629
02:02:45,445 --> 02:02:47,363
He wants a hit. Yeah, and a big queen.

1630
02:02:47,322 --> 02:02:48,615
I think you're busted.

1631
02:02:48,531 --> 02:02:50,450
Buggered, not busted.

1632
02:02:50,408 --> 02:02:51,701
- Turn them over.
- Buggered.

1633
02:02:51,743 --> 02:02:53,244
And weep.

1634
02:02:53,536 --> 02:02:54,954
Hit me.

1635
02:02:55,413 --> 02:02:57,332
I think you're over.

1636
02:02:57,332 --> 02:02:59,250
- I know you're over.
- Hovno.

1637
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:01,252
That's a three. Hovno.

1638
02:03:12,931 --> 02:03:14,516
Mr. Sefelt?

1639
02:03:16,142 --> 02:03:18,228
Did everything go well?

1640
02:03:20,438 --> 02:03:22,232
That's very nice.

1641
02:03:22,315 --> 02:03:24,734
Now you feeI better, don't you?

1642
02:03:24,818 --> 02:03:26,402
Yes, ma'am.

1643
02:03:27,946 --> 02:03:29,864
Deuce to the dealer.

1644
02:03:29,823 --> 02:03:31,741
Split them. Higher.

1645
02:03:32,951 --> 02:03:34,744
McMurphy is out.

1646
02:03:39,249 --> 02:03:41,251
McMurphy has escaped.

1647
02:03:42,335 --> 02:03:44,254
They were taking him through the tunnel.

1648
02:03:44,254 --> 02:03:47,257
He beat up two of the attendants
and escaped.

1649
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:49,259
McMurphy's upstairs.

1650
02:03:49,259 --> 02:03:51,052
Oh, no, no, no!

1651
02:03:51,136 --> 02:03:53,638
Jim, I'm telling you,
McMurphy is upstairs...

1652
02:03:53,638 --> 02:03:55,557
...and he's as meek as a lamb.

1653
02:03:55,557 --> 02:03:56,850
Really?

1654
02:03:56,724 --> 02:03:58,810
I mean, how do you know?

1655
02:03:59,227 --> 02:04:01,229
Jack Dunphy told me.

1656
02:04:01,729 --> 02:04:03,648
Jack Dunphy's full of shit!

1657
02:04:03,648 --> 02:04:05,358
Right! Right!

1658
02:04:13,324 --> 02:04:15,034
Right! Right!

1659
02:05:58,471 --> 02:06:00,473
They said you escaped.

1660
02:06:02,142 --> 02:06:04,060
I knew you wouldn't Ieave without me.

1661
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:06,062
I was waiting for you.

1662
02:06:07,147 --> 02:06:09,065
Now we can make it, Mac.

1663
02:06:09,065 --> 02:06:11,484
I feel big as a damn mountain.

1664
02:06:30,378 --> 02:06:31,796
Oh, no!

1665
02:07:02,869 --> 02:07:05,288
I'm not going without you, Mac.

1666
02:07:07,874 --> 02:07:10,460
I wouldn't Ieave you here this way.

1667
02:07:20,386 --> 02:07:22,388
You're coming with me.

1668
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:45,662
Let's go!

1669
02:09:04,908 --> 02:09:06,409
Let's go!
