Suc ?? out.

140
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,960
We are here at the Atlanta Institute,
that long ...

141
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,880
rivaled Harvard and Yale.

142
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,240
Students found
a new type of flu very m ?.

143
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,820
The Kong mania invaded

144
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,700
holy halls of academia.

145
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,880
The place est? all taken for
bananas! ... Literally.

146
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,720
The fourth of Kong lady ...

147
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,600
est? still to be completed.

148
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,040
The research team Benson Huges ...

149
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,520
transformed this storage box? m ...

150
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,680
... The most feminine closet j?
built? in the world!

151
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,560
We estimate that the island
Skull and Borneo ...

152
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,480
They were both part of the
same landmass ...

153
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,200
Listen, Doc, give me only one
second. Excuse me, ladies.

154
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,680
Where is? Dr.? Good,

155
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Tr? S day, by chance you do not sleep?

156
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,080
Well, I think his words were:

157
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,640
"You've do not need me,
