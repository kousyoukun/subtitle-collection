00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,480
Rest, you need a break

Hey, sorry about your shade p? RAST,

00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,520
All right, shake his corner.

00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,920
Wait until the sedative
m? Juma starts.

193
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,840
You should have
tuimestusp? ssi to use.

194
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,200
I did not shoot him,
drugged food is enough k? ll.

KLC calls SS-1'te!

199
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,760
Shit ...

00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,080
You could have killed them ?!

212
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,320
Operational Group, Colonel Nevitti leadership,
has closed the 50-m area ruutmiilise? ers.

213
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,680
So far it seems that the monkeys v? Ldivad
human-populated areas.

214
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
We're back to the situation,
there will be changes.

215
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,520

222
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,440
Come apart.

223
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,720
N? E, make yourself useful.

226
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,400
He? Said that shoots down k? Ik civilians,
who invade his territory.

227
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Cool.

228
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,320
Here is the area where the army? Ra close.

229
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,080
Our monkeys are out there somewhere.

230
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,040
There are reports of these fucking civilians?

231
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,680
I looked into the car data, is it? SJA
Doctor Franklin's registered in someone else's name.

232
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
He is the doctor who operated Kong.

233
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,080
We believe that a man with whom he is,
This is Mitchell's character.

234
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,280
Neil l? HEB DOCTOR needed
when we begin to inject the gas.

235
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,680
Morning, s ?? r.

236
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,840
enemy detection
should not be difficult.

237
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,840
They are 50 ft k? Rged and bear
? Likonda, which s? Ndisid.

238
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,280
See, that every man would be a mask,
and that it would be willing to put up,? the right side? Leval.

239
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,480
Gas will drape the helicopter,

240
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,120
you will see that after the age of monkeys,
not to us.

241
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,720
Just so, s ?? r.

242
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,960
All right, l? HME.

243

Mesfin? DALATE N? LVAK

246
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,080
Ah, Jesus ...

247
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,400
Borneo, you would have been necessary!

248
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,920
If I were premature
death wish.

249
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,280
What is this?
Make Up Box?

250
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
This is Kong's? Damemonitor.

251
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,280
There are 22 remote controllable inputs
? Implant connected microprocessor.

252
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,520
The great thing, l? HME.

253
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,560
When Kong s? Da ?? t is not right,
then this makeup kit makes it time.

254
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,400
Let the bag here.

255
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,680
You know, l Kong? Hex here
? He step in? Le.

256
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,600
I wish that I could Kong.

257
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,640
Wait a moment.

258
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,440
No way.

259
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,400
What the box it!
P ?? sta it!

260
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,120
Are you crazy ?!

261

Are you okay?

262
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,840
Yes.

263
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,960
S? Damemonitor.
Where is it?

264
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,240
There.

265
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,080
Come on.

Hold on.

269
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,040
It is not v? Ga s? GAV.

270
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,080
I would not want to p? Letik in l? Hex.

271
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
I need you.

272
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,640
You're the only 10-mile radius,
John Wayne who can not m? NGI.

273
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay, ready.

They are there? Leval.

277
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,600
Not very far away.

278
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,000
Well, how do we boys l? HEB?

279
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,680
Unbelievable ...

Furthermore, k? Ike this, he s? Da

281
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
It seems that your d ?? j t? Druk-S? Brast without.

282
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,160
You know ...

283
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
They will be able to take
even disastrous appearance.

284
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,080
V? I Borneo v? I Kong island ...

285
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,520
It would only need money for our reserves.

286
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,960
We should find a place,
where to camp.

287
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,120
Hey, here's a good place.

288

Are you sure?

290
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,520
We are, after all, as well as primates.
