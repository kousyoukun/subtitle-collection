1
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,561
Happy birthday to me!

2
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:53,709
Happy birthday!

3
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:04,273
- Oh, my God!
- Anybody want this?

4
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:13,549
That's what happens
when you do a mercy invite.

5
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:16,252
I believed you wanted to invite everyone.

6
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:19,321
Dad, I can't invite everyone in
my art class except for one person

7
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,257
without social networking evidence

8
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,425
inflicting more pain on that
person than was intended.

9
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:24,560
And I'm not a monster.

10
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,496
I'm proud of you. I think.

11
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:31,933
She gets detention a lot and she yells
at teachers sometimes.

12
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:35,837
There was that rumor that went around
that she just kept running away from home.

13
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:36,838
Um, maybe she can Uber.

14
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:38,807
I seriously believe that we can go home now.

15
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:41,477
Um, did I mistakenly convey
this was a democracy?

16
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:44,326
We are not going till she gets picked up.

17
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:51,187
Uh, the car broke down.
I'm just gonna take the bus.

18
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,422
You're not taking a bus.
I'll drive you home.

19
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:55,791
Claire has almost saved her half
of the money she needs for a car.

20
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,293
Isn't that right?

21
00:01:57,373 --> 00:02:01,343
This'll be one of the few times left
I can drive you guys around. Huh?

22
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:03,965
Uh, I...

23
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:07,736
You won't be able to hear my dad tell
jokes that only he thinks are funny

24
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:10,572
for an entire car ride unless you come.

25
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,588
You don't really wanna miss that.

26
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:21,550
Wow! I got more gifts than I thought I did.

27
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,653
Can I put this in here?

28
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,456
Yeah, I'll get it. Thank you, Marcia.

29
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:28,557
Maybe he just is into...

30
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:32,541
Maybe he's just content where he is.

31
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:43,018
Hey. Can I help you?

32
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:46,508
What?

33
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:48,644
This is the one. He's really funny.

34
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:51,347
He does these weekly videos.

35
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:56,552
See? It's so random. That is so weird.

36
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,722
Yeah, you have a crush on him.

37
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:01,590
- I don't get it.
- Pause it.

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,624
- Yeah, go back.
- Why don't you get it?

39
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:05,461
- I just don't get it.
- He's blond and he's cute.

40
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,563
No, his eyebrows are just like...

41
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:08,764
Shut up. His eyebrows?

42
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:09,998
That's the one thing you couldn't get?

43
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,500
Yeah.

44
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,987
Oh, my God.

45
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:24,380
Oh. You see what he does, though?

46
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,047
How does he even do that?

47
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:27,483
That's the whole point why I'm showing you.

48
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:28,897
Genius!

49
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:31,453
So bad.

50
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:44,866
Hey!

51
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,948
Pardon me, sir.
I think you have the wrong car.

52
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:31,112
We woke up in here.

53
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:41,256
What the hell is going on?

54
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:43,812
What are we doing here?

55
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,847
What happened to my dad?

56
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,095
He's out there.

57
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,133
Do you know what happened to my dad?

58
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:48,156
I choose you first.

59
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:56,732
It's only gonna be a minute.

60
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,592
Pee on yourself.

61
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:05,026
Pee on yourself.

62
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:08,109
No!

63
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:18,620
No.

64
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,088
No!

65
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,191
No!

66
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:24,626
No!

67
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:27,362
Open the door!

68
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,846
Hey, are you okay?

69
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:48,850
He wanted me to dance for him.

70
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,293
The outside door is locked.

71
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,932
Everything's okay.

72
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:07,335
We're okay.

73
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:10,706
We're okay.

74
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:22,704
I hear the tiniest little splash
and here it comes.

75
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:25,373
A freak of nature, like this.

76
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:27,676
So, he comes across the stream

77
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:32,280
and he's so tall that the water
doesn't even get to his belly.

78
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,382
Then he stops.

79
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:37,165
And my heart's coming out of my chest.

80
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:40,188
You got buck fever.

81
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:43,391
Uncle John's got buck fever.

82
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,126
That's not true, Casey.
Your daddy's a liar.

83
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,361
How big was the rack?

84
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,063
It was huge.

85
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:49,765
Where are you supposed to
look when you shoot, Casey?

86
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:50,932
At the body.

87
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,233
Then why was he looking at the rack?

88
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:54,249
'Cause he had buck fever.

89
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:57,138
She'll say anything you say.

90
00:09:57,218 --> 00:10:00,221
You gonna do that when you get your
mentored hunting license in three years?

91
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:02,410
No, sir.

92
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,080
Make sure you put your
gloves on after you finish.

93
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,262
Your feet and your hands
get cold first out there.

94
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:37,278
Three students abducted.

95
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:41,282
The father of one of the students woke up
dazed in King of Prussia, reportedly drugged.

96
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,985
He found the kids and the car missing.

97
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,987
Neighbors are in disbelief.

98
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:49,370
A normally quiet community
is reeling after this abduction.

99
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,295
If you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of these girls,

100
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,477
you are urged to contact the police.

101
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:16,117
It doesn't matter
if you open that door, Claire.

102
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:19,287
There's a second locked door.

103
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,489
He's gonna come in here again, any second,

104
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:24,005
and we're not letting him
take one of us out again.

105
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:29,264
We just cried and screamed
and we didn't hurt him

106
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:32,133
because we were afraid to get him upset.

107
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:35,070
God, that's victim shit. Jesus!

108
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,238
We should fight him.

109
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:39,454
We should drop a crazy-ass bomb on him.

110
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:43,825
I saw him carry one of you and lay you
on the bed like you weighed nothing.

111
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:47,395
One punch from him would knock one of us out.

112
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:52,020
I took six months of Kenpo karate class.

113
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,956
And you distract the assailant with pain.

114
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:58,159
Everything is so easy for you guys.

115
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,341
You do one thing, you can
predict the next thing.

116
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:05,500
It's not the way it's gonna be
in this situation.

117
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,502
We're not getting out of here.

118
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:10,318
You're saying that you're not gonna
fight with everything in you?

119
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:14,209
You know the only chance...

120
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:18,393
The only chance we have is if
all three of us go crazy on this guy.

121
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:22,363
We have to hurry.

122
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,890
We need you, Casey.

123
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,506
Claire's smart. Let's listen to her.

124
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:35,410
I'll do it if you're gonna do it, too.

125
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:39,267
We can win.

126
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:40,515
He'll hurt us.

127
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:44,252
No. Shut up.

128
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,375
Both of you.

129
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:51,092
You're gonna pick your miserable
self up and help us get out of here.

130
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:55,416
Blow me.

131
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:59,054
And your six months of karate at the
King of Prussia Mall can blow me, too.

132
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,156
No! No, no, you can't do this today!

133
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:03,058
You can't do this right now.

134
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:04,993
Why do you do this?
Why do you act like this?

135
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:06,441
Why do you act like you're not one of us?

136
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,382
When you're aiming, Casey,

137
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,039
always keep both eyes open.

138
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:23,611
Cover your target with the barrel
then move with it to get its pace.

139
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:26,381
I'm warning you,
it's gonna be frustrating the first times.

140
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:29,117
You're gonna shoot under it or behind it.

141
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:30,598
You'll learn to stay with it.

142
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,222
Females are smarter than the males.

143
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:35,957
But you know that, it's like humans.

144
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:40,061
Females use their nose to stay alive.

145
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,430
They make sure they have cover.

146
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,566
They always remember they're
trying to stay alive.

147
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:48,436
Bucks go off by themselves.

148
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:51,339
Bucks get dumb during mating season.

149
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,042
Boys make too much noise.

150
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:56,277
Yes, they do.

151
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:58,026
I'm better than a boy, right?

152
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:01,082
Yes, you are.

153
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,130
Hey.

154
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:11,139
I'll let you know when I hear
something that makes sense.

155
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:16,978
We don't even know what this is yet.

156
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:25,453
Hey! I was inspired.

157
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:32,113
No, no, no, that one.

158
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:34,549
That one, before the pink
frock coat with the thorns.

159
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:37,085
That's supposed to be like a tailored jacket,

160
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,500
but I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

161
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:45,973
I'm a simple blouse and
skirt person, but these...

162
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:51,332
These are very artistic, Barry.

163
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:55,736
Just the kind of thing Hamptons
ladies would spend $15,000 on

164
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:58,006
to wear once at a charity ball.

165
00:14:58,086 --> 00:14:59,707
Shut up!

166
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:02,243
You know, I can't stay too long.

167
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:04,079
This is just a visit.

168
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,993
Well, tell me what's going on.

169
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:09,550
What, you mean the email?

170
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,052
No, just the usual things.

171
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,520
Just feelings of being overwhelmed.

172
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,092
The terseness of your email made it
sound specific and time-related.

173
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:18,759
Are you looking for something?

174
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,461
- No.
- No?

175
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,330
I'm just admiring. I'm better now.

176
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,564
How's work?

177
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:24,732
It's great.

178
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:26,601
When I last spoke to them,

179
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:29,637
they believed you were a model employee.

180
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:33,474
They found you meticulous and conscientious.

181
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:35,310
- You know this, right?
- I do.

182
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,145
You've managed there for 10 years.

183
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:38,693
You're functioning very well, Barry.

184
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:43,384
And it's a rare and wonderful
place for you to work.

185
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,120
Yes, it is.

186
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,223
You know, of all my other
clients with your disorder,

187
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,705
you've been the most consistent at your job.

188
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,475
Did something happen, Barry?

189
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,611
How old are you?

190
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:01,269
Just... The Internet is
inconsistent on this point.

191
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,471
Why is that on your mind?

192
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:07,108
Who's gonna look after us
when you retire or pass on?

193
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,610
You know, we're gonna have
to take care of ourselves

194
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,646
and nobody even believes that we exist.

195
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,515
If ever something were to happen to me,

196
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:17,665
I've made arrangements with a colleague
from Baltimore to take over.

197
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,088
Hmm.

198
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:21,302
Hey, do you, uh...

199
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,291
You live alone?

200
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:24,725
You know this.

201
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:26,494
I'm sorry, I just meant how long?

202
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:27,675
Always.

203
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,380
That must be so lonely.

204
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,310
Uh, you know what?

205
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,446
I'm doing much better. I shouldn't
have emailed you. I'm just...

206
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,328
Look at me. I'm too impulsive.

207
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:54,222
By the way, is anybody listening?

208
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:55,790
Does anybody care about us?

209
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,058
Yes.

210
00:16:57,138 --> 00:17:00,295
The University of Paris has asked
me to do a lecture, in fact.

211
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,498
I'm going to be doing it
via Skype from right here.

212
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:06,247
People are believing more.

213
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:09,804
Let's meet at our usual time next week.

214
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,187
I would rather you didn't leave, Barry.

215
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,144
Did something happen?

216
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,545
Don't worry.

217
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,713
This was just a visit.

218
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:20,381
I'm doing much better, I actually...

219
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,883
Don't you want your sketches, Barry?

220
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:25,266
You're usually very protective of them.

221
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:27,768
Yeah.

222
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:29,404
Thanks.

223
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,610
I'll see you next week at our usual time.

224
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:38,746
Thanks for fighting for us, Dr. Fletcher.

225
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:52,813
Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.

226
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,582
Welcome.

227
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:55,583
I just think I'm gonna blow it.

228
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:57,685
No, you'll be great.
I'll see you next week.

229
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:58,733
Okay, thank you.

230
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:07,662
...DJ's exclusive million dollar

231
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:10,598
Holiday Bucks Bonanza.

232
00:18:10,678 --> 00:18:12,947
I don't know how you work with those people.

233
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:15,370
What people?

234
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,305
Your patients.

235
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:22,243
You can't use your thumbs
to spin the wheel, dumbasses.

236
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:24,492
They always use their thumbs. Oh.

237
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:31,632
Well, we look at people who've been
shattered and different as less than.

238
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,901
What if...

239
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:36,904
they're more than us?

240
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:38,806
What?

241
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,512
Do you believe them? Your patients.

242
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,402
Just between you and me.

243
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:48,783
- Yes, I do.
- Hmm.

244
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,640
Flick it! Flick it!

245
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,310
...coming up next, right after this.

246
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,911
I don't believe it.

247
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:59,247
- No offense.
- No.

248
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:02,317
...but when you call, we'll send you
a second easy-feet absolutely free!

249
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:03,884
Just pay separate processing.

250
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:05,320
So that's two easy feet...

251
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,302
Now, that, I need to buy that.

252
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:12,460
He's back.

253
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,475
There's a lady outside.

254
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,574
Dennis, admit what you've done.

255
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:27,722
Don't get upset.

256
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,458
Don't tell me.

257
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:32,927
I'm getting frightened.

258
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,685
I thought that you had this under control.

259
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,720
Please tell me it's not too late.

260
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,968
The food is waiting.

261
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:47,542
Is she in that room?

262
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:50,898
- We're here!
- Help us!

263
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:52,367
We're in here!

264
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,768
What is this? How many are there?

265
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,370
No, don't go in there!

266
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,537
Don't go in there!

267
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,395
Don't worry.

268
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:11,532
I'll talk to him.

269
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,769
He listens to me.

270
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,679
He's not well.

271
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:27,968
He knows what you're here for.

272
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:30,605
He's not allowed to touch you.

273
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:31,886
He knows that.

274
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:35,623
Mmm-mmm.

275
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:38,826
Hmm?

276
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,306
Karen. Joe.

277
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:08,456
They said you can't have your own
panel at the national conference.

278
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:14,749
They conceded, however, that you can
be part of the mood disorder panel.

279
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:16,884
It's not a mood disorder.

280
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:19,520
Oh, I'm aware of your beliefs, Karen.

281
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,690
Well, were they open this time
with the new evidence?

282
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,726
One of your arguments is a dog?

283
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:28,095
You submitted video of
a dog acting differently

284
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:29,997
to one of your patients at different times?

285
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:32,066
It is more dramatic than that.

286
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,935
They are what they believe they are.

287
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:37,938
The brain has learned to defend itself.

288
00:21:38,018 --> 00:21:39,987
You speak of them like
they're supernaturally gifted.

289
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:42,610
Like they have powers or something.

290
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,545
Karen, these are patients.

291
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,494
They have been through trauma.

292
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:53,534
And perhaps now they are
capable of something we're not.

293
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:58,426
We have brain scans now.

294
00:21:58,506 --> 00:22:03,043
DID patients have changed their
body chemistry with their thoughts.

295
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:08,803
He's just trying to scare us.

296
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:11,185
He was having a full
conversation with himself.

297
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:16,877
What was that line about?
"The food is waiting."

298
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:20,981
Does everyone get how wacked this is
and that we need to get out of here now?

299
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,792
No.

300
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:34,429
Please, keep your area neat.

301
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:36,130
The bathroom, it's unacceptable.

302
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,666
To make it easy, I've color-coded these.

303
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:43,984
Use the blue bottle for the floor and
the pink bottle for the ceramic surfaces.

304
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:49,924
Uh...

305
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:13,701
Patricia has reminded me that
I was sent to get you for a reason.

306
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:16,584
That you are sacred food.

307
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:20,721
And I promise not to bother you again.

308
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:36,691
Maybe he has a dog or something.

309
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:38,939
You think he's gonna feed us to his dogs?

310
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:14,074
Casey.

311
00:24:16,043 --> 00:24:17,044
Casey!

312
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:37,217
My name's Hedwig.

313
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:39,066
I have red socks.

314
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:47,808
He's on the move.

315
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:51,779
What?

316
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:58,105
He's... on...

317
00:24:58,185 --> 00:24:59,607
the...

318
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:01,121
move.

319
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:04,691
Who?

320
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,648
Someone's coming for you

321
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:10,618
and you're not gonna like it.

322
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:12,687
You guys make noises in your sleep.

323
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:13,768
Tell us.

324
00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:16,771
I'm not supposed to say.

325
00:25:18,072 --> 00:25:22,763
But he's done awful things to people
and he'll do awful things to you.

326
00:25:22,843 --> 00:25:24,264
I have blue socks, too.

327
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:25,880
We're his food?

328
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,052
How old are you?

329
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:33,954
Nine.

330
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,127
So you're not the guy that took us?

331
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:42,162
No.

332
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:45,953
You're not the lady?

333
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:48,288
What are you, blind?

334
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:51,225
You don't know how they think?

335
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:53,794
No, they don't tell me much.

336
00:25:53,874 --> 00:25:55,309
I just ate a hot dog.

337
00:25:56,911 --> 00:26:00,047
Could you help us, Hedwig?

338
00:26:01,782 --> 00:26:04,839
No, I'm not even supposed to be here.

339
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,908
I stole the light from Mr. Dennis,
but he'll be back real soon.

340
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:12,079
I can't steal the light for too
long or he'll know and get angry.

341
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,327
Etcetera.

342
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:17,084
See you!

343
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:18,265
Wait.

344
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:23,771
We heard something.

345
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:28,342
We didn't understand it,

346
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,345
but now we do.

347
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:36,704
Do you know what we heard?

348
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:38,385
What did you hear?

349
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,121
Come here.

350
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,125
I'll whisper it to you.

351
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:48,395
Okay.

352
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:02,242
This guy...

353
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:07,915
is coming for you.

354
00:27:12,987 --> 00:27:14,408
You're a big fibber.

355
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,090
I never lie, Hedwig.

356
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:19,814
But Mr. Dennis,

357
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:22,883
he said that he followed
those two girls for four days

358
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:25,085
and that he knew

359
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:27,768
that they were the ones that he would want.

360
00:27:30,537 --> 00:27:32,793
When you're not around,

361
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:35,095
Dennis and the lady talk about it.

362
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:38,065
They talk about how he wants a boy this time.

363
00:27:38,145 --> 00:27:39,499
They're going to give him you.

364
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:42,402
No, Miss Patricia, she said...

365
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:44,504
She said she's not mad at me anymore.

366
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:46,774
She sings to me sometimes.

367
00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:49,756
I think Miss Patricia is
still a little mad at you.

368
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:53,180
Miss Patricia thinks I'm...

369
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,829
She thinks I'm stupid.

370
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:58,265
She thinks I make silly mistakes.

371
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:00,234
Look at me.

372
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:03,337
We're like your babysitters.

373
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:08,175
We'll let you watch TV
and make you a fun dinner.

374
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:13,133
We all need to get out of here.

375
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:15,535
You could show us the way out.

376
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:18,138
We could be gone before anybody gets back,

377
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:20,274
but we have to hurry, Hedwig.

378
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:22,823
We have to hurry and get out of here.

379
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,461
Wait a minute.

380
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:31,118
It took forever to get this place safe

381
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:33,087
without the nosey bodies
that work here finding out.

382
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,022
You can't get out of here!

383
00:28:35,102 --> 00:28:36,190
I have to blow my nose.

384
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,437
No, wait! Please don't go!

385
00:28:40,174 --> 00:28:41,141
Who's coming?

386
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:44,298
This is seriously scary.

387
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:45,512
No one's coming.

388
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:51,818
He said something.

389
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:57,524
He said something about making the room safe.

390
00:28:58,592 --> 00:29:00,194
This is all new drywall.

391
00:29:02,062 --> 00:29:03,330
What was unsafe?

392
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:39,333
Wait.

393
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:42,069
Wait, are we sure about this?

394
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,393
Casey, you were right.

395
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:08,983
There's something here.

396
00:30:09,063 --> 00:30:11,051
He was covering up a way out.

397
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:12,532
Tell me if you see him.

398
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,238
Casey, tell us what you see.

399
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:27,434
He's here.

400
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,203
You can't let him in! You can't let him in!

401
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:30,417
This is our one chance.

402
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,208
We're not gonna make it.

403
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:35,455
Yes, we are!

404
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:45,132
What?

405
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,434
Hey, what are you guys doing?

406
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:52,572
Hey.

407
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:55,575
Okay, quit it.

408
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,444
Okay, guys?

409
00:30:58,112 --> 00:30:59,233
Let me in.

410
00:30:59,313 --> 00:31:02,336
Give us a second. We're changing.

411
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,617
What are you guys doing?

412
00:31:05,652 --> 00:31:06,620
Let me in.

413
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:10,991
Guys, you're not being funny.

414
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:24,291
You're being bitches!
Now, I'm gonna slap you!

415
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:25,425
I'm gonna slap you in your face.

416
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:27,274
Just give me as much time as you can.

417
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:31,031
You're gonna get me into trouble.

418
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:35,970
Guys...

419
00:31:37,784 --> 00:31:39,253
All right, push up.

420
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:46,486
Hey!

421
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,626
Hey!

422
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,467
Hey!

423
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:28,528
I thought I lost you.

424
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:32,866
Would you, uh...

425
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:36,102
Would you step outside, please?

426
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:45,532
You like to make fun of us.

427
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:48,202
But we're more powerful than you think.

428
00:33:48,282 --> 00:33:49,783
Step outside.

429
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:53,553
Please.

430
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:04,531
You shouldn't trick children.

431
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:07,534
That shows who you are.

432
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,662
Look at your sweater. It's ruined.

433
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:17,244
It's dirty.

434
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:20,714
Remove it.

435
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:53,713
I'm trying to be good.

436
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,419
You will not see your friend again.

437
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,603
She will be kept separate.

438
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:22,296
You take off your skirt.
You take off your shirt.

439
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,344
Clothes you got all dirty from the dust.

440
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:53,760
One identity in an individual with
Dissociative Identity Disorder

441
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,994
can have high cholesterol.

442
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:56,430
One.

443
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,434
There have been cases where one
identity is allergic to bee stings.

444
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:02,202
The others are not.

445
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:06,940
Are there moments where two identities
can coexist at the same time?

446
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,743
There are times when two identities

447
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:13,313
can take the "light" or "the spot"

448
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,915
or consciousness at the same time.

449
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:18,885
This happened with a student
that I was working with.

450
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:22,989
And her left and right hand were taking notes

451
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:27,994
in different hand-writings about
separate things at the same time.

452
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:31,798
The differences in the
identities can be dramatic.

453
00:36:31,878 --> 00:36:35,635
As much as the difference between you and me

454
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:38,618
and every person in that auditorium.

455
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:41,741
The identities have different IQ's.

456
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:43,777
They have different physical strengths.

457
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:47,013
One personality is a Russian weightlifter

458
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:50,917
and can lift three times his body weight.

459
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,820
Their ability to hyper-focus

460
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,003
and have different experiences is astounding.

461
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:04,364
Have these individuals,
through their suffering,

462
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:07,381
unlocked the potential of the brain?

463
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:12,419
Is this the ultimate doorway

464
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,990
to all things we call unknown?

465
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,863
Is this where our sense of
the supernatural comes from?

466
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:39,579
It's about depth

467
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:43,470
and curves...

468
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,971
Hey, you see that one?

469
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:46,886
It's kind of like a chenille sweater-dress.

470
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:52,526
Who are you?

471
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:58,732
Barry.

472
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:01,901
I don't think you are.

473
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:06,526
I've developed a nose for sensing

474
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:08,608
whom I'm talking to and whom I'm not.

475
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:11,765
Have I done something?

476
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:14,601
You've emailed for an unscheduled appointment

477
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:16,736
two days in a row.

478
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,652
We're just feeling overwhelmed.

479
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:20,887
Garden-variety issues.

480
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:27,080
I think Orwell or Jade or Samuel or Heinrich

481
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,916
had the light for a moment and emailed me.

482
00:38:29,996 --> 00:38:32,486
And you're here to tell me everything's okay.

483
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:34,100
I emailed you.

484
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:38,772
May I talk to one of them, please?

485
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:45,131
That can't happen.

486
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:46,700
I...

487
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,484
I told them that I wanted to spend
the session with you today.

488
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:54,808
I'm gonna ask again.

489
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:58,645
To whom am I speaking with now?

490
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:01,461
Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry.

491
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:04,884
It doesn't seem like Barry.

492
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:07,153
Barry is an extroverted leader.

493
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:08,602
Yes, I am.

494
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,427
I'm gonna take a professional guess

495
00:39:13,507 --> 00:39:17,163
based on the description of all 23 identities

496
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,699
that live in Kevin's body,

497
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:21,848
that I've gotten from Barry.

498
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:27,787
I think I'm talking to Dennis.

499
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:32,912
But he's been banned from the light

500
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:35,582
because, among other reasons,

501
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:39,986
he has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

502
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,921
which he himself knows is wrong

503
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:44,758
and has fought against with little success.

504
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:47,594
I'm encouraged we can finally meet.

505
00:39:47,674 --> 00:39:49,095
And I've guessed this

506
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:52,866
because you've adjusted the chocolate
dish twice since you came in here

507
00:39:52,946 --> 00:39:54,534
and I understand you have OCD.

508
00:39:55,982 --> 00:39:58,472
I see. Now, I see. That's clever.

509
00:39:58,552 --> 00:40:00,607
That's clever, but I'm not Dennis.

510
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:03,710
And you and Patricia have
been banned from the light

511
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,645
for quite a while now.

512
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:07,981
Primarily, shall we say,
because of your beliefs.

513
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:10,517
Patricia and Dennis are very unstable.

514
00:40:10,597 --> 00:40:11,851
I'm not Dennis.

515
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:14,087
Have you both taken charge now?

516
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,736
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

517
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,198
You must forgive me.

518
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:28,535
My job is to challenge you.

519
00:40:28,615 --> 00:40:30,837
And, as you must know by now,

520
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:34,588
I have plenty of opinions about
how everyone should live their lives.

521
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:38,778
Ask me something about fashion.

522
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:40,126
I'll prove it.

523
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,716
Look, look, look. Lindt.

524
00:40:45,264 --> 00:40:46,232
Yeah, look.

525
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:50,203
You see? I'm not Dennis.

526
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:53,660
You want me to do something else?

527
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,061
You got ice cream?

528
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:59,566
Oh, this shirt's a cotton blend anyway
and the collar is from three seasons ago.

529
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:01,581
Snood? I mean, come on.

530
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,056
Jai, what health-conscious
fast food purveyor

531
00:41:23,136 --> 00:41:25,291
did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

532
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:28,728
you've so lovingly reheated
in a minor suicidal gesture?

533
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:30,764
Hooters. And you can't just
throw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

534
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:32,899
Oh, this is wrong on so many levels.

535
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:37,236
We finished about 3:15,
so look around 3:18.

536
00:41:37,316 --> 00:41:39,714
You're getting a little soft
around the middle, Jai.

537
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,077
The authors of Hooters play
on our incessant need for fat

538
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:48,047
and man's incessant need to be in
the proximity of augmented breasts.

539
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:51,718
It's like Henry V ran a fast food franchise.

540
00:41:51,798 --> 00:41:52,886
It's a good place, Dr. Fletcher.

541
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:54,200
Right.

542
00:41:55,802 --> 00:41:57,757
How'd you know the trash would be spilled?

543
00:41:57,837 --> 00:41:59,192
How can I say this, Jai?

544
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:01,841
You're not the most meticulous of people.

545
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:19,979
This guy isn't very neat, is he?

546
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:20,980
He walked right through the trash.

547
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,315
No, Jai.

548
00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:24,718
Any normal person
would have walked around it.

549
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:26,866
That was an act.

550
00:42:28,134 --> 00:42:30,236
What are you up to, Dennis?

551
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:35,141
Or is it Patricia who's deciding things?

552
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:39,145
We're not gonna die.

553
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:42,181
Bad things happen.

554
00:42:43,382 --> 00:42:45,218
But not like this.

555
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,320
Casey...

556
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:50,223
Talk to me.

557
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:56,082
We need to get to a window
or a door, or something.

558
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:57,330
Don't you think?

559
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:15,769
The thrill, Casey, is about whether you can

560
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:18,918
or can't outsmart this animal.

561
00:43:22,355 --> 00:43:24,978
See, you didn't used to
like to come out here.

562
00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:27,193
This is like our family tradition, right?

563
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:29,929
Good shot, big brother.

564
00:43:30,797 --> 00:43:32,131
Thank you, John.

565
00:43:39,906 --> 00:43:42,075
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

566
00:43:47,146 --> 00:43:48,314
Eat.

567
00:43:55,288 --> 00:43:56,355
It's good?

568
00:43:57,957 --> 00:44:00,159
It's got paprika in it.

569
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:05,331
I'm sorry.

570
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,937
I think I'll put a pretty
flower in your hair.

571
00:44:13,406 --> 00:44:14,407
There we are.

572
00:44:22,215 --> 00:44:24,283
That's to show how important you are.

573
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:26,439
Come along.

574
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,354
We'll have a proper meal.

575
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:33,412
I understand.

576
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:36,115
This must all seem so unsatisfactory for you.

577
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:39,118
But we are doing the best we can.

578
00:44:58,551 --> 00:44:59,518
Good?

579
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:03,957
Hmm?

580
00:45:06,525 --> 00:45:08,214
Can Claire come eat with us?

581
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:10,216
No.

582
00:45:10,296 --> 00:45:12,886
No, I'm afraid that can't happen.

583
00:45:12,966 --> 00:45:16,369
She almost ruined our big reception.

584
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:19,072
Mmm...

585
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:26,145
I've heard that Asian people's
music aids digestion.

586
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:30,383
I'll make you a second sandwich.

587
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:36,943
Do you know,

588
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:41,560
a family of lions can eat 35 pounds a day?

589
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,521
A buck can lose 30% of its
weight during mating season,

590
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:50,223
chasing does around.

591
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:51,938
They're crepuscular, right?

592
00:45:53,439 --> 00:45:56,362
It means they travel around
during dusk and dawn.

593
00:45:56,442 --> 00:45:57,443
Good for you.

594
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:15,361
It's crooked.

595
00:46:16,662 --> 00:46:18,031
Forgive me.

596
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:32,478
I don't know if you know,
but tigers have only 30 teeth.

597
00:46:34,613 --> 00:46:38,104
That's 12 less than a dog.

598
00:46:38,184 --> 00:46:39,986
I thought that was a fun fact.

599
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:41,520
No.

600
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:47,560
Marcia.

601
00:46:48,161 --> 00:46:49,562
Marcia, listen to me.

602
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,942
Go to your room. Shut the door.

603
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:16,922
Do it now.

604
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:56,395
"In the sun, we will find our passion.

605
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,268
"In the sun, we will find our purpose."

606
00:48:08,474 --> 00:48:10,496
You've always been protected.

607
00:48:10,576 --> 00:48:12,999
You've never truly suffered.

608
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,102
And that's why we chose you.

609
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:17,983
You've always been asleep.

610
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:23,656
You never had a chance.

611
00:48:28,461 --> 00:48:30,429
You never had a chance.

612
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:35,521
The dark-haired girl, she's gonna
be kept in another closet.

613
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:36,935
You might as well know at this point.

614
00:48:37,636 --> 00:48:39,392
The Beast,

615
00:48:39,472 --> 00:48:42,228
he's coming for you.

616
00:48:42,308 --> 00:48:44,710
All three of you, you're
gonna be kept separate.

617
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:48,434
You've got...

618
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:50,449
You've got a crumb on your shirt.

619
00:48:52,818 --> 00:48:54,287
Please take it off.

620
00:48:54,787 --> 00:48:55,588
Just...

621
00:48:57,823 --> 00:48:59,225
Just take it off.

622
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:16,575
Hey.

623
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:25,318
Ah.

624
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:52,845
It wasn't nice, what you
said about Miss Patricia.

625
00:49:54,147 --> 00:49:55,448
You lied.

626
00:50:00,186 --> 00:50:03,076
I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

627
00:50:03,156 --> 00:50:07,326
You guys lied to me,
made me scared, etcetera.

628
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:14,120
Mr. Dennis, he says
you wear a lot of shirts.

629
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,368
I like this shirt.

630
00:50:16,302 --> 00:50:17,823
Thank you.

631
00:50:17,903 --> 00:50:20,459
Do you know who Dennis and Miss Patricia are?

632
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:21,840
No.

633
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:28,434
Every one of us has to wait in a chair,

634
00:50:28,514 --> 00:50:32,771
and Barry, he decides
who stands in the light.

635
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:35,521
But Barry lost that power because of me.

636
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:40,726
I can wish myself into
the light anytime I want.

637
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:45,151
It's a special power.

638
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:48,434
Barry just has to keep sitting
in his chair if I want him to.

639
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:53,239
That's why Dennis and Miss Patricia
said I could be with them.

640
00:50:54,607 --> 00:50:58,131
Dennis and Miss Patricia,
they believe in The Beast

641
00:50:58,211 --> 00:50:59,745
and what he can do.

642
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,582
Have you seen him?

643
00:51:07,286 --> 00:51:08,587
The Beast?

644
00:51:10,223 --> 00:51:11,757
No. Can I kiss you?

645
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,762
I wanted to kiss the other girl with
the dark hair, but she's in trouble.

646
00:51:20,899 --> 00:51:22,255
So, do you want to?

647
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:23,789
I mean, I don't know
much about kissing, though.

648
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:24,670
Yeah.

649
00:51:28,374 --> 00:51:29,708
Okay.

650
00:51:30,476 --> 00:51:32,265
Uh...

651
00:51:32,345 --> 00:51:33,679
Okay, here we go.

652
00:51:36,315 --> 00:51:37,370
One...

653
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:38,451
Two...

654
00:51:39,485 --> 00:51:40,486
Three.

655
00:51:55,968 --> 00:51:57,603
You might be pregnant now.

656
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:01,640
Am I a good kisser?

657
00:52:02,741 --> 00:52:03,742
Yeah.

658
00:52:04,343 --> 00:52:05,431
I like dancing.

659
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:07,566
Do you like dancing?

660
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:11,437
I like dancing to my CD player in my room.

661
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:13,319
Kanye West is my main man.

662
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,376
We got my CD player set up in my room,

663
00:52:17,456 --> 00:52:18,791
right next to my window.

664
00:52:19,592 --> 00:52:20,593
I'm like...

665
00:52:27,733 --> 00:52:28,734
We gots the moves.

666
00:52:29,034 --> 00:52:29,835
Wow.

667
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:35,694
Maybe I could watch you dance

668
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:38,444
and listen to music with you.

669
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:41,780
No, my music's in my room.

670
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:43,816
Oh. Right.

671
00:52:46,552 --> 00:52:47,553
Maybe

672
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:49,988
you could sneak me there.

673
00:52:51,657 --> 00:52:53,592
Are you trying to trick me?

674
00:52:54,327 --> 00:52:55,694
Etcetera?

675
00:52:56,829 --> 00:52:58,651
I'll tell on you.

676
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:00,253
I'm telling on you.

677
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,421
I'll tell you something.

678
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:04,657
And you can tell me
if I'm lying or not, okay?

679
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:06,639
- Mmm-hmm.
- Like a test. Okay?

680
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:16,882
I get into trouble at school, on purpose.

681
00:53:21,354 --> 00:53:23,656
So I can get sent to detention.

682
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:31,864
To get away from everyone.

683
00:53:38,571 --> 00:53:40,406
So that I can be alone.

684
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,853
Okay, I'll show you
something cool in my room.

685
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:57,175
Okay.

686
00:53:57,255 --> 00:54:00,659
But after Mr. Dennis has finished
his getting-ready ritual.

687
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,715
I have to go.

688
00:54:02,795 --> 00:54:04,517
He's got an appointment.

689
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:07,420
When I fall asleep, one of the others
keeps trying to reach the doctor lady

690
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,322
to tell on us.

691
00:54:09,402 --> 00:54:11,724
That pant, it's got a red lining.

692
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:15,093
You can see it in
the long slit down the side.

693
00:54:15,173 --> 00:54:19,765
We have been talking about
silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.

694
00:54:19,845 --> 00:54:22,768
Can I guess that you emailed
me in the middle of the night

695
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:28,040
for an emergency session
due to garden-variety issues?

696
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:35,113
I was down and I emailed you and
I woke up and I feel better.

697
00:54:35,193 --> 00:54:36,929
I feel better.

698
00:54:39,131 --> 00:54:40,719
I had a thought.

699
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,020
Mmm-mmm.

700
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,823
I want to talk about the incident at work.

701
00:54:44,903 --> 00:54:46,525
It's okay, Barry.

702
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:48,394
You're safe.

703
00:54:48,474 --> 00:54:50,829
I just want to bring the details back.

704
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:52,945
We'll just talk about the details.

705
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,736
A high school from Camden, New Jersey

706
00:54:57,816 --> 00:55:00,906
was on a field trip at your place of work

707
00:55:00,986 --> 00:55:03,542
and two young ladies came up to you.

708
00:55:03,622 --> 00:55:06,479
And one took your hand

709
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,782
and put it under her shirt on her breast
and the second one did the same

710
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:12,885
and then they just ran off
laughing to their friends.

711
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:15,621
You surmised that it might be on a dare.

712
00:55:15,701 --> 00:55:18,056
You said they were 17 or 18.

713
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:20,092
You said it upset you for days.

714
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:23,175
It was just a teenage prank.
I get that now.

715
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:27,533
And see, that's my mistake.

716
00:55:27,613 --> 00:55:31,937
I believe that I went over this
incident with you too fast.

717
00:55:32,017 --> 00:55:34,807
Although you said you were fine,

718
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:38,944
and the other identities
I met with said it was fine,

719
00:55:39,024 --> 00:55:43,181
I believe that this brought up issues

720
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:46,118
from when you were a child and abused.

721
00:55:46,198 --> 00:55:49,121
Sometimes another incident of abuse

722
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:51,904
can cause suppressed
personalities to take the light.

723
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:55,661
Dennis, if this is you,

724
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:58,063
I completely understand

725
00:55:58,143 --> 00:56:02,100
why you felt the need to take
over and protect the others.

726
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,469
Please!

727
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:05,003
Doctor, not this again.

728
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:06,238
The others told me

729
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,776
that you and Patricia told
the group about this Beast.

730
00:56:10,856 --> 00:56:14,179
And I told them that these
are just scary stories

731
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:18,717
that Dennis and Patricia tell
the others to scare them.

732
00:56:18,797 --> 00:56:21,520
How this Beast can crawl on walls,

733
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,891
like the best rock climbers using
the slightest friction and imperfections

734
00:56:25,971 --> 00:56:30,696
to hold his body close
to seemingly sheer surfaces.

735
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:34,980
How his skin is thick and tough
like the hide of a rhinoceros.

736
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:41,887
Do you really believe
the stories about The Beast?

737
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:44,610
Hmm.

738
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,859
If this is you, Dennis,

739
00:56:48,093 --> 00:56:50,696
I understand why Kevin needs you.

740
00:56:52,565 --> 00:56:54,987
You are strong and disciplined.

741
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:59,171
You are precise and you
will not be taken advantage of.

742
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:02,941
You can trust me.

743
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:06,164
For example,

744
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:10,703
I do have the ability to use Kevin's
full name and bring him forward

745
00:57:10,783 --> 00:57:12,050
as he has in the past.

746
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:15,674
But I wouldn't do that.

747
00:57:15,754 --> 00:57:19,912
I know that that would
be chaos for all of you.

748
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:21,914
Everyone would grab the light.

749
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:24,096
I don't want to hurt any of you that way.

750
00:57:25,998 --> 00:57:27,800
You don't have to hide.

751
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:32,070
I know you are someone who cares for Kevin.

752
00:57:34,807 --> 00:57:38,110
You are not evil to me.

753
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:42,848
You were necessary.

754
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,218
Dennis.

755
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,221
Is that you?

756
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:06,238
They keep calling us The Horde.

757
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:10,308
The others, you know?

758
00:58:12,244 --> 00:58:15,347
Miss Patricia and I, we are ridiculed.

759
00:58:17,149 --> 00:58:21,286
Now, we're not perfect, but we
don't deserve to be ridiculed.

760
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:26,158
We're all struggling.
They have to admit that.

761
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:34,099
I am pleased to meet you, Dennis.

762
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:37,802
You, too.

763
00:58:40,806 --> 00:58:45,130
I assume you don't know who emailed
me for the emergency sessions?

764
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,712
One of the others.

765
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:49,602
Are you in charge?

766
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:51,804
Yeah, we've taken charge.

767
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:54,072
We're the only ones that can protect Kevin.

768
00:58:54,152 --> 00:58:56,154
We're all here to protect Kevin.

769
00:58:56,922 --> 00:58:58,223
He's very weak.

770
00:59:01,193 --> 00:59:04,282
He doesn't know how powerful we can be.

771
00:59:04,362 --> 00:59:07,032
Would you mind telling me when
you first came into existence?

772
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:16,174
And how you and Patricia, the other
undesirable identity, became aligned?

773
00:59:19,778 --> 00:59:20,878
That's okay.

774
00:59:21,446 --> 00:59:23,248
Do you still have strong beliefs?

775
00:59:24,249 --> 00:59:26,104
That depends on what.

776
00:59:26,184 --> 00:59:29,421
This story of The Beast.

777
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:39,151
One thing, Dennis, that may
comfort you if you are confused

778
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:43,088
is that you've met the other alters.

779
00:59:43,168 --> 00:59:45,804
You're all in a room in chairs, right?

780
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:48,160
Yeah.

781
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,262
But you never met The Beast.

782
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:52,865
Because he doesn't reside
with the rest of you.

783
00:59:52,945 --> 00:59:56,101
Because he resides in the
train yard, as the story goes,

784
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:58,303
because Kevin's dad left on a train.

785
00:59:58,383 --> 01:00:03,288
But the fact is, you and Patricia
have never met The Beast.

786
01:00:03,922 --> 01:00:04,923
Have you?

787
01:00:06,324 --> 01:00:07,225
No.

788
01:00:08,393 --> 01:00:10,362
That's because he's not an alter.

789
01:00:11,797 --> 01:00:13,999
He's not the 24th identity.

790
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:17,235
He's a fantasy.

791
01:00:36,955 --> 01:00:39,211
Hurry up! Let's go!

792
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:41,026
Come on, it's time.

793
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:08,380
Wow.

794
01:02:09,214 --> 01:02:10,382
I know.

795
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,872
This is your CD player?

796
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:15,120
Yeah.

797
01:02:18,456 --> 01:02:19,824
You don't like it?

798
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:22,527
- It's not new...
- No!

799
01:02:23,461 --> 01:02:25,097
No, I'm just, uh...

800
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:29,421
I'm confused.

801
01:02:29,501 --> 01:02:31,089
You said it was near a window.

802
01:02:31,169 --> 01:02:32,470
Oh, that's here!

803
01:02:34,472 --> 01:02:35,961
Watch.

804
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,175
Now, it's closed.

805
01:02:38,443 --> 01:02:39,544
Now, it's open.

806
01:02:41,113 --> 01:02:42,114
Now, it's closed.

807
01:02:43,982 --> 01:02:45,117
Now, it's open.

808
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,594
Did you think it was a real window?

809
01:03:00,065 --> 01:03:03,035
So you could leave, etcetera?

810
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:08,606
Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

811
01:03:10,508 --> 01:03:13,645
Just get me the keys and let me out the door.

812
01:03:14,546 --> 01:03:15,733
Please.

813
01:03:15,813 --> 01:03:20,238
Miss Patricia says that nobody will make fun
of me anymore when The Beast comes!

814
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:22,941
She says that everyone
will see how amazing I am

815
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:26,144
and then all of the silly mistakes,
they won't matter anymore.

816
01:03:26,224 --> 01:03:28,146
I think you should go
back to your room. No!

817
01:03:28,226 --> 01:03:30,949
Wait, please, I wanna hear
your Kanye West albums.

818
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:32,417
Show me your room.

819
01:03:32,497 --> 01:03:34,586
Let's stay here.
I'm sorry I asked to leave.

820
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,254
I can't.

821
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:37,655
You said you wanted to show
me something cool, right?

822
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:38,590
No.

823
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,073
- Show me something. Please!
- I don't want to.

824
01:03:44,242 --> 01:03:45,243
This!

825
01:03:53,018 --> 01:03:54,486
Wow.

826
01:03:55,553 --> 01:03:56,921
It's nice.

827
01:03:57,489 --> 01:03:59,491
It's not a toy.

828
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:06,184
This is real?

829
01:04:06,264 --> 01:04:07,265
Yes!

830
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:11,103
It's Mr. Dennis'.

831
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:14,439
He doesn't even know I stole it.

832
01:04:16,308 --> 01:04:18,443
Pretty cool, right?

833
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:23,715
You can listen to people talking
and they don't even know you're listening.

834
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:28,106
Who does this talk to?

835
01:04:28,186 --> 01:04:29,321
Don't touch that.

836
01:04:30,555 --> 01:04:32,357
I just wanna see if it works.

837
01:04:34,192 --> 01:04:35,948
Hey, what are you doing?

838
01:04:36,028 --> 01:04:37,449
Don't touch those buttons.
You're gonna get us found out.

839
01:04:37,529 --> 01:04:39,397
- Yeah, East gate here.
- What up?

840
01:04:44,336 --> 01:04:45,570
Don't talk.

841
01:04:46,604 --> 01:04:48,240
- What up?
- Don't talk.

842
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:52,364
Hello?

843
01:04:52,444 --> 01:04:53,465
I'm gonna slap you!

844
01:04:53,545 --> 01:04:54,579
Who's this?

845
01:04:57,315 --> 01:04:59,737
Hello. Hello, my name is Casey Cooke.

846
01:04:59,817 --> 01:05:02,154
I'm being held in a basement.
I've been abducted with two other girls.

847
01:05:03,555 --> 01:05:06,291
Who the hell is this?

848
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,134
Hello?

849
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:18,323
Casey Cooke.

850
01:05:18,403 --> 01:05:19,491
I've been abducted.

851
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:22,060
You need to find me.

852
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,528
Betty, is that you?

853
01:05:23,608 --> 01:05:24,997
This isn't funny.

854
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:27,499
Call the police. I must be near you.

855
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:30,268
I'm being held in a basement or something.

856
01:05:30,348 --> 01:05:31,669
Okay, Betty, listen.

857
01:05:31,749 --> 01:05:33,638
Tell Larry and Fish I said hi.

858
01:05:33,718 --> 01:05:36,174
Tell him I still got his orange headphones.

859
01:05:36,254 --> 01:05:38,056
I don't know where I am.

860
01:05:38,656 --> 01:05:40,212
There's a man here.

861
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:42,560
He abducted us and he's going to kill me.

862
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:54,606
I only have a few hours left.

863
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:00,078
Please.

864
01:06:01,646 --> 01:06:03,281
I'm begging you.

865
01:06:04,582 --> 01:06:07,139
Somebody save us.

866
01:06:07,219 --> 01:06:09,074
Wait, who is this?

867
01:06:09,154 --> 01:06:11,656
And how did you get one of our walkies?

868
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:21,833
Put your hands together in contrition.

869
01:06:24,169 --> 01:06:28,106
"In the sun, we will find our passion.

870
01:06:29,607 --> 01:06:31,596
"In the sun,

871
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:36,614
"we will find our purpose."

872
01:06:46,891 --> 01:06:51,116
I read that on a sympathy
card in a supermarket.

873
01:06:51,196 --> 01:06:54,632
It was for funerals, but
I thought it was beautiful.

874
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:03,775
Dennis will explain the
meaning of this evening.

875
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:41,799
The Beast is a sentient creature

876
01:07:41,879 --> 01:07:45,670
who represents the highest
form of humans' evolution.

877
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:49,587
He believes the time of
ordinary humanity is over.

878
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:53,691
I hope this makes you feel calm.

879
01:07:55,593 --> 01:08:00,918
You will be in the presence
of something greater.

880
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:03,488
I was gonna ask for your last shirt,

881
01:08:03,568 --> 01:08:05,657
but I won't.

882
01:08:05,737 --> 01:08:07,705
Because tonight is a sacred night.

883
01:08:09,341 --> 01:08:10,908
It's almost over.

884
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:20,718
Casey. Come on.

885
01:08:22,254 --> 01:08:24,188
Let's pretend we're animals again.

886
01:08:24,556 --> 01:08:25,723
Come on.

887
01:08:28,793 --> 01:08:30,695
Casey, come on. This is our game.

888
01:08:33,331 --> 01:08:35,467
I'll tell your dad you're not being nice.

889
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,842
Come on, take off your stuff.

890
01:08:57,922 --> 01:08:59,911
Animals don't wear clothes.

891
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:01,279
Come on.

892
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,760
Yeah, yeah.

893
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,262
Come on.

894
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:30,988
Hey, Casey bear.

895
01:09:34,526 --> 01:09:35,893
This isn't funny.

896
01:09:40,332 --> 01:09:41,799
Is it loaded?

897
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:45,870
Casey.

898
01:09:47,739 --> 01:09:48,773
I'm your uncle.

899
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:53,845
Stop it, Casey.

900
01:09:55,413 --> 01:09:57,269
Put that gun down.

901
01:09:57,349 --> 01:09:58,903
I'm getting upset.

902
01:09:58,983 --> 01:10:00,772
I'm about to get very angry.

903
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:01,886
Give me the gun!

904
01:10:09,627 --> 01:10:10,962
Could have killed me.

905
01:11:19,063 --> 01:11:20,718
This place is closed. You can't get in.

906
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:22,734
No, it's okay.

907
01:11:29,173 --> 01:11:31,529
Hello, Dennis.

908
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:34,732
One of the others emailed me just now.

909
01:11:34,812 --> 01:11:36,868
Is everything okay?

910
01:11:36,948 --> 01:11:38,049
We're fine.

911
01:11:38,683 --> 01:11:40,037
Dennis,

912
01:11:40,117 --> 01:11:42,640
Kevin is really lucky to have you.

913
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,410
You are quite extraordinary.

914
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:47,692
I just don't want you guys to get hurt.

915
01:11:53,798 --> 01:11:56,434
You think we're extraordinary?

916
01:11:57,034 --> 01:11:58,903
I like you, Dennis.

917
01:11:59,737 --> 01:12:01,459
May I come in?

918
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:03,040
And can we talk?

919
01:12:05,142 --> 01:12:07,812
I know you wanna tell me something.

920
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,115
Why don't you just tell me?

921
01:12:26,664 --> 01:12:28,886
We're very similar, you and I.

922
01:12:28,966 --> 01:12:30,922
Both on the outside, looking in.

923
01:12:31,002 --> 01:12:32,670
Please, sit.

924
01:12:33,538 --> 01:12:36,093
I don't get many visitors.

925
01:12:36,173 --> 01:12:38,095
Uh, I'll get you some water.

926
01:12:38,175 --> 01:12:40,498
They got a proper quarters for me

927
01:12:40,578 --> 01:12:44,702
in a building on the south side,
but we prefer it here.

928
01:12:44,782 --> 01:12:47,451
When they promoted me to head of
maintenance, they said I could have it.

929
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,788
Who are you going to meet?

930
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,029
I wanna talk about

931
01:12:59,531 --> 01:13:00,698
Kevin

932
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:05,102
and what his mother did to him.

933
01:13:06,704 --> 01:13:08,893
I remember it all.

934
01:13:08,973 --> 01:13:12,063
I'm happy you're suddenly so open.

935
01:13:12,143 --> 01:13:14,732
Kevin's mother had rather malevolent ways

936
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:17,569
of punishing a three-year-old.

937
01:13:17,649 --> 01:13:19,236
Is that when you arrived in the light?

938
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:20,184
Yeah.

939
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,610
The one way to avoid her attention
was to keep everything spotless,

940
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,992
everything perfect.

941
01:13:30,595 --> 01:13:33,150
I know you're coming from
good intentions, Dennis,

942
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:36,020
but there are other ways to help Kevin now.

943
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:41,092
I've lost so many patients into the system.

944
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:44,962
I want you to know, Dennis,
I will never stop fighting for you.

945
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:48,800
My patients have become my family.

946
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,169
They are what I've chosen instead
of a more traditional path.

947
01:13:52,249 --> 01:13:55,840
I hope you feel you can
be truly honest with me.

948
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,289
I actually wanna be honest with you.

949
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:02,614
I lied before.

950
01:14:02,694 --> 01:14:05,296
When you asked if I'd ever met The Beast,

951
01:14:06,197 --> 01:14:08,085
I said no.

952
01:14:08,165 --> 01:14:09,533
That really isn't true.

953
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:18,796
You wrote about a woman in Germany
who'd been blind for 10 years.

954
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:22,299
And then, it was discovered that she had DID.

955
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:26,671
Then three of her identities developed sight.

956
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:31,108
And you speculated that her
optical nerves regenerated

957
01:14:31,188 --> 01:14:33,978
because of her beliefs.

958
01:14:34,058 --> 01:14:36,080
What are you trying to say?

959
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,818
There are things, Dr. Fletcher,
that all of us would find hard to believe.

960
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:43,888
Are you trying to tell me
there's a 24th identity?

961
01:14:43,968 --> 01:14:46,323
You protect the broken.

962
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:50,061
When you said that you thought
this situation was extraordinary,

963
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:52,597
I knew you can maybe understand.

964
01:14:52,677 --> 01:14:53,998
Understand what?

965
01:14:54,078 --> 01:14:55,079
The Beast

966
01:14:56,881 --> 01:14:58,349
is real.

967
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:01,238
He's just emerged.

968
01:15:01,318 --> 01:15:03,755
You were right about everything.

969
01:15:04,956 --> 01:15:06,190
What does he look like?

970
01:15:08,259 --> 01:15:10,882
He's much bigger than I am

971
01:15:10,962 --> 01:15:12,964
and I'm the biggest of all of us.

972
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:15,620
He's tall.

973
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,022
He's very muscular.

974
01:15:18,102 --> 01:15:20,658
And he's got a long mane of hair

975
01:15:20,738 --> 01:15:24,942
and his fingers are twice the length of ours.

976
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,601
He believes we are extraordinary.

977
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:33,951
That we don't represent
a mistake, but our potential.

978
01:15:36,888 --> 01:15:38,790
You say the same things.

979
01:15:41,358 --> 01:15:43,260
He's on the move.

980
01:15:43,861 --> 01:15:45,296
What does that mean?

981
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:48,199
I don't understand.

982
01:15:49,366 --> 01:15:51,168
He can't be real.

983
01:15:52,904 --> 01:15:56,674
There must be limits to what
a human being can become.

984
01:15:58,375 --> 01:15:59,797
And there's another whole part

985
01:15:59,877 --> 01:16:02,199
of the story, isn't there?

986
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:05,837
About the eating of the impure young?

987
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:08,640
What does impure even mean?

988
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,941
Well...

989
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:11,108
We should discuss that

990
01:16:11,188 --> 01:16:13,277
so that you can understand fully.

991
01:16:13,357 --> 01:16:14,946
Understand what?

992
01:16:15,026 --> 01:16:16,761
Sometimes,

993
01:16:18,062 --> 01:16:20,031
there's just no other way.

994
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,269
Who are you going to meet?

995
01:16:27,438 --> 01:16:29,006
Him.

996
01:16:34,278 --> 01:16:35,166
You know what?

997
01:16:35,246 --> 01:16:37,882
I would love to take notes on all of this.

998
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:42,439
We should probably discuss this
in a proper session tomorrow.

999
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:44,108
Really?

1000
01:16:44,188 --> 01:16:46,010
You're okay with this?

1001
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:49,747
This has been so wonderful,
you being so open.

1002
01:16:49,827 --> 01:16:53,785
I can see that you feel very empowered
by the philosophies of The Beast.

1003
01:16:53,865 --> 01:16:55,853
I'm going to go now.

1004
01:16:55,933 --> 01:16:58,369
I knew you would understand. I'll see you.

1005
01:17:11,983 --> 01:17:13,851
Would you mind

1006
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,189
if I used your bathroom?

1007
01:17:19,991 --> 01:17:20,992
No.

1008
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:26,397
It's down the hall, near
the stairs, on your left.

1009
01:17:30,868 --> 01:17:32,236
How we doing?

1010
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:34,405
I'm okay.

1011
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:15,546
Are you real?

1012
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,818
Who is it?

1013
01:18:21,252 --> 01:18:22,419
Help me.

1014
01:18:24,088 --> 01:18:25,142
Help me.

1015
01:18:25,222 --> 01:18:26,891
Is someone there?

1016
01:18:29,393 --> 01:18:31,295
Please help me.

1017
01:18:33,931 --> 01:18:36,020
They will never reach their potential.

1018
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,421
They don't really matter.

1019
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:39,403
Listen to me, Dennis.

1020
01:18:40,104 --> 01:18:42,860
I should've listened better.

1021
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:47,799
I should've understood what you're
capable of, how powerful you are.

1022
01:18:47,879 --> 01:18:50,101
Patricia says your way isn't working.

1023
01:18:50,181 --> 01:18:52,269
The world will understand now.

1024
01:18:52,349 --> 01:18:56,187
Dennis, this is an egregious wrong.

1025
01:18:58,222 --> 01:18:59,944
These young women are suffering.

1026
01:19:00,024 --> 01:19:01,813
This is a crime.

1027
01:19:01,893 --> 01:19:04,115
I can't let you keep them here.

1028
01:19:04,195 --> 01:19:05,983
We've gotta stop this.

1029
01:19:06,063 --> 01:19:08,285
This identity is monstrous.

1030
01:19:08,365 --> 01:19:10,054
I'm really sad you feel this way.

1031
01:19:10,134 --> 01:19:11,823
Can't you see?

1032
01:19:11,903 --> 01:19:14,892
He is formed because of
your time in this place.

1033
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:43,500
There's a lady.

1034
01:19:44,401 --> 01:19:46,103
Someone's here.

1035
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:49,606
We need to get out of these rooms.

1036
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:53,564
Is there anything in your room?

1037
01:19:53,644 --> 01:19:55,445
Anything that we could use?

1038
01:20:03,354 --> 01:20:04,989
There's nothing in here.

1039
01:20:07,524 --> 01:20:09,293
There's a hanger.

1040
01:20:33,117 --> 01:20:34,451
Thank you, Dennis.

1041
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,488
Here you go, sir.

1042
01:20:56,207 --> 01:21:00,331
It sounded like there were slide
bolts on the outside of our doors.

1043
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:02,713
See if you can move the lock
through the crack in the door.

1044
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:14,305
Stay calm.

1045
01:22:14,385 --> 01:22:16,753
We're getting out of here.
We're gonna get Casey.

1046
01:22:18,389 --> 01:22:20,224
You can do this, Marcia.

1047
01:22:56,193 --> 01:22:59,516
With regard to Chahamana's defeat
and Muhammad of Ghor's conquests

1048
01:22:59,596 --> 01:23:03,087
between 1192 and 1200,

1049
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:06,723
I would liken it to
Muhammad's brazen ultimatum

1050
01:23:06,803 --> 01:23:09,640
that Prithviraj either apostatize or fight.

1051
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:15,232
Like Prithviraj's defiance,

1052
01:23:15,312 --> 01:23:18,735
we should stand up to The Horde's advances.

1053
01:23:18,815 --> 01:23:22,153
In the face of their scare
tactics, we should show...

1054
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:25,489
I hate my insulin shots.

1055
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,712
No one else around here has to take them.

1056
01:23:28,792 --> 01:23:30,627
Why do I have to have diabetes?

1057
01:23:32,196 --> 01:23:34,418
All the doctors, besides Dr. Fletcher,

1058
01:23:34,498 --> 01:23:37,421
say that we're the same person.

1059
01:23:37,501 --> 01:23:39,536
Just personalities, huh?

1060
01:23:40,704 --> 01:23:43,207
How do you explain I'm the only one
that needs these, you motherfuck...

1061
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:51,182
I'm wearing cargo pants from the '90s.

1062
01:23:51,948 --> 01:23:54,238
And a scarf.

1063
01:23:54,318 --> 01:23:56,407
If it wasn't for the
Varvatos T-shirt underneath,

1064
01:23:56,487 --> 01:23:58,121
I'd be a mess.

1065
01:23:59,356 --> 01:24:01,124
I got no taste for things right now.

1066
01:24:02,259 --> 01:24:05,462
I'm worried sick.

1067
01:24:06,863 --> 01:24:10,354
I have a very bad feeling
that I'm losing time.

1068
01:24:10,434 --> 01:24:11,888
I decide who gets the light, right?

1069
01:24:11,968 --> 01:24:13,490
I think

1070
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:17,494
someone is stealing the light
from me when I'm not aware.

1071
01:24:17,574 --> 01:24:21,832
The Horde keeps obsessing about
the ones who haven't suffered.

1072
01:24:21,912 --> 01:24:26,149
I don't know where they're going
with this, but it scares me.

1073
01:25:27,311 --> 01:25:29,546
Picture yourself in a couple hours at home.

1074
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:31,748
On the couch,

1075
01:25:32,849 --> 01:25:35,286
in that ugly-ass sweatshirt that you love.

1076
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:48,885
It's an animal!

1077
01:25:48,965 --> 01:25:51,568
He goes like this if there's
a coyote or something.

1078
01:27:31,735 --> 01:27:33,637
Kevin, Kevin.

1079
01:28:02,098 --> 01:28:03,934
Thank you

1080
01:28:05,436 --> 01:28:07,604
for helping us till now.

1081
01:29:14,004 --> 01:29:17,694
I guess I should tell
Dr. Fletcher about this...

1082
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:19,430
but she'll worry.

1083
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:20,811
She's such a sweet woman.

1084
01:29:22,879 --> 01:29:26,803
I believe I will go for a nice walk

1085
01:29:26,883 --> 01:29:30,120
and think this through organizationally.

1086
01:29:33,123 --> 01:29:37,514
Thus ends my journal for Monday.

1087
01:29:37,594 --> 01:29:38,595
Ciao.

1088
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:01,111
Claire.

1089
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,215
Marcia.

1090
01:31:27,904 --> 01:31:29,005
Claire.

1091
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,241
Claire, let's go.

1092
01:32:43,213 --> 01:32:45,048
"Kevin Wendell Crumb."

1093
01:33:11,007 --> 01:33:12,909
Kevin Wendell Crumb?

1094
01:33:17,848 --> 01:33:18,935
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1095
01:33:21,885 --> 01:33:24,220
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1096
01:33:35,265 --> 01:33:37,200
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1097
01:33:38,902 --> 01:33:41,204
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1098
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:43,740
You made a mess.

1099
01:33:44,808 --> 01:33:46,242
Come out here.

1100
01:33:48,979 --> 01:33:50,767
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1101
01:33:50,847 --> 01:33:52,368
You made a mess!

1102
01:33:52,448 --> 01:33:53,716
Get out here!

1103
01:34:20,443 --> 01:34:22,766
Who are you?

1104
01:34:22,846 --> 01:34:24,414
What's happening?

1105
01:34:26,482 --> 01:34:28,118
Something horrible.

1106
01:34:30,086 --> 01:34:31,321
What'd I do?

1107
01:34:33,289 --> 01:34:35,025
Did I hurt you?

1108
01:34:43,099 --> 01:34:44,400
Dr. Fletcher.

1109
01:34:45,035 --> 01:34:46,502
Dr. Fletcher.

1110
01:34:48,872 --> 01:34:50,306
Who did that?

1111
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:54,197
You did.

1112
01:34:54,277 --> 01:34:57,333
I swear, I was on a bus.

1113
01:34:57,413 --> 01:34:59,315
I don't remember anything after that. I...

1114
01:35:01,384 --> 01:35:04,354
This is still September 18, 2014, right?

1115
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:17,133
There's a shotgun I bought.

1116
01:35:18,568 --> 01:35:21,457
It's in the bottom cabinet,
hidden behind things.

1117
01:35:21,537 --> 01:35:24,374
The shells are in my uniform
closet out in the service hall.

1118
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:28,511
Kill me.

1119
01:35:32,382 --> 01:35:33,516
Then kill me.

1120
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:41,177
Wait, no!

1121
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:42,846
Don't do that!

1122
01:35:42,926 --> 01:35:44,394
He can't handle reality.

1123
01:35:45,095 --> 01:35:45,982
My name is Jade.

1124
01:35:46,062 --> 01:35:48,218
Has Dr. Fletcher been getting our emails?

1125
01:35:48,298 --> 01:35:49,585
This is what we have to do.

1126
01:35:50,967 --> 01:35:52,889
As in 1008,

1127
01:35:52,969 --> 01:35:56,893
when Anandapala suffered
the Shahis' most crushing defeat

1128
01:35:56,973 --> 01:36:00,163
and Mahmud overran the entirety
of the Punjab region,

1129
01:36:00,243 --> 01:36:02,866
taking the famed temple of Kangra,

1130
01:36:02,946 --> 01:36:06,002
we have been wronged by this alliance,

1131
01:36:06,082 --> 01:36:09,072
this horde of Patricia, Dennis and the boy.

1132
01:36:09,152 --> 01:36:11,988
Their actions do not represent us.

1133
01:36:12,555 --> 01:36:14,410
They are every...

1134
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:16,626
Everybody, just take a minute!

1135
01:36:17,393 --> 01:36:20,050
Oh, baby girl.

1136
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:22,118
They've been stealing control
of the light from me.

1137
01:36:22,198 --> 01:36:24,855
But the group are gonna work through this.

1138
01:36:24,935 --> 01:36:26,957
Honey, my name is Barry.

1139
01:36:36,947 --> 01:36:38,581
You shouldn't have used the walkie-talkie.

1140
01:36:43,086 --> 01:36:44,554
They almost caught us.

1141
01:36:46,589 --> 01:36:48,578
Stop it, Hedwig!

1142
01:36:48,658 --> 01:36:51,948
They were right. Look at you.

1143
01:36:52,028 --> 01:36:53,463
You're so frightened of us.

1144
01:36:55,031 --> 01:36:59,089
Dennis and Miss Patricia
are in charge because of me.

1145
01:36:59,169 --> 01:37:02,058
I'm gonna give the light to them now.

1146
01:37:02,138 --> 01:37:05,641
No one's allowed to make fun of me anymore.

1147
01:37:18,321 --> 01:37:20,456
Thank you, Hedwig.

1148
01:37:24,694 --> 01:37:26,482
Everything's fine now.

1149
01:37:26,562 --> 01:37:28,331
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1150
01:37:30,566 --> 01:37:32,422
Kevin is asleep.

1151
01:37:32,502 --> 01:37:34,657
We've made him sleep far away.

1152
01:37:34,737 --> 01:37:39,142
You can call his name all you like,
dear, but he's not going to hear you.

1153
01:37:40,376 --> 01:37:43,366
The Beast has shared with us his dream

1154
01:37:43,446 --> 01:37:46,636
of a larger group to sustain him.

1155
01:37:46,716 --> 01:37:48,304
No.

1156
01:37:48,384 --> 01:37:52,042
Ten to 12 unworthy young next time.

1157
01:37:53,756 --> 01:37:56,192
This is just

1158
01:37:56,759 --> 01:37:58,161
the start.

1159
01:39:18,141 --> 01:39:19,209
Let go!

1160
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:55,778
Help!

1161
01:39:57,847 --> 01:40:00,550
No! No!

1162
01:40:06,322 --> 01:40:07,490
No.

1163
01:40:19,169 --> 01:40:20,170
No.

1164
01:40:22,372 --> 01:40:24,340
It runs in our family.

1165
01:40:25,341 --> 01:40:27,630
My daddy died, too.

1166
01:40:27,710 --> 01:40:29,399
Same way.

1167
01:40:29,479 --> 01:40:30,813
Heart attack.

1168
01:40:33,549 --> 01:40:35,438
But you don't need to worry.

1169
01:40:35,518 --> 01:40:36,786
I'm going to take care of you.

1170
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:41,624
Now,

1171
01:40:42,892 --> 01:40:45,728
you won't be giving me any trouble, will you?

1172
01:40:46,562 --> 01:40:48,664
I know you won't, sweetie.

1173
01:41:09,752 --> 01:41:12,888
We are glorious!

1174
01:41:14,224 --> 01:41:17,293
We will no longer be afraid.

1175
01:41:27,002 --> 01:41:30,340
Only through pain

1176
01:41:31,607 --> 01:41:33,743
can you achieve your greatness!

1177
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:54,717
The impure are the untouched,

1178
01:41:54,797 --> 01:41:58,534
the unburned, the unslain.

1179
01:42:01,504 --> 01:42:07,897
Those who have not been torn
have no value in themselves

1180
01:42:07,977 --> 01:42:12,335
and no place in this world!

1181
01:42:12,415 --> 01:42:15,718
They are asleep!

1182
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:35,871
Fuck!

1183
01:42:36,939 --> 01:42:40,643
Your gun cannot hurt me.

1184
01:42:41,877 --> 01:42:45,247
Can't you see I am not human?

1185
01:42:47,617 --> 01:42:50,753
Kevin is a man. I am much more.

1186
01:44:22,578 --> 01:44:26,048
You are different from the rest.

1187
01:44:36,626 --> 01:44:39,995
Your heart is pure!

1188
01:44:41,864 --> 01:44:43,966
Rejoice!

1189
01:44:49,872 --> 01:44:53,676
The broken are the more evolved.

1190
01:44:59,849 --> 01:45:02,518
Rejoice.

1191
01:46:03,078 --> 01:46:05,615
What in the name of Mary and Joseph?

1192
01:46:07,016 --> 01:46:09,552
What are you doing in this area?

1193
01:46:50,325 --> 01:46:52,582
Just keep walking, honey.

1194
01:46:52,662 --> 01:46:53,996
They won't do nothing.

1195
01:47:30,032 --> 01:47:33,022
Vince, call the police.

1196
01:47:33,102 --> 01:47:36,071
She said some people got hurt
in the area below maintenance.

1197
01:47:57,226 --> 01:47:58,227
Okay.

1198
01:48:01,196 --> 01:48:03,065
Now, I'm just gonna check you.

1199
01:48:44,774 --> 01:48:47,062
Third deceased name of Dr. Karen Fletcher.

1200
01:48:47,142 --> 01:48:49,344
Still trying to locate the family.

1201
01:49:06,862 --> 01:49:08,798
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

1202
01:49:19,274 --> 01:49:21,076
Your uncle's here.

1203
01:49:22,745 --> 01:49:24,313
You ready to go?

1204
01:50:13,963 --> 01:50:15,464
It didn't go through.

1205
01:50:20,903 --> 01:50:24,439
We are what we believe we are.

1206
01:50:30,212 --> 01:50:32,735
Holy shit!

1207
01:50:32,815 --> 01:50:35,204
This is so cool!

1208
01:50:38,487 --> 01:50:41,123
They're gonna believe we exist now, right?

1209
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:45,427
They're gonna have to.

1210
01:50:48,197 --> 01:50:50,232
So what do we do now?

1211
01:50:54,036 --> 01:50:55,370
We trust in him.

1212
01:50:57,973 --> 01:50:59,308
He'll protect us.

1213
01:51:01,043 --> 01:51:04,346
Look at what he can do.

1214
01:51:06,415 --> 01:51:10,152
Let him show the world
how powerful we can be.

1215
01:51:19,895 --> 01:51:22,351
The suspected murderer Kevin Crumb

1216
01:51:22,431 --> 01:51:26,488
suffers from the controversial
psychological disorder DID.

1217
01:51:26,568 --> 01:51:30,092
The rumors coming out of the scene
are almost unbelievable.

1218
01:51:30,172 --> 01:51:33,896
There are conflicting stories
if the suspect is alive or dead

1219
01:51:33,976 --> 01:51:36,766
after sustaining two point-blank gunshots.

1220
01:51:36,846 --> 01:51:39,334
Reports even indicate
one of his personalities

1221
01:51:39,414 --> 01:51:44,039
is an amalgam of the various animals
in the Philadelphia Zoo where he worked.

1222
01:51:44,119 --> 01:51:47,042
The press is already referring
to the alleged attacker

1223
01:51:47,122 --> 01:51:51,013
by a dark name leaked by
a source close to the case.

1224
01:51:51,093 --> 01:51:53,883
Because of his many personalities,
he is being called...

1225
01:51:53,963 --> 01:51:55,030
The Horde.

1226
01:51:56,531 --> 01:52:01,390
This is like that crazy guy in the
wheelchair that they put away 15 years ago.

1227
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:03,973
And they gave him a funny name, too.

1228
01:52:04,874 --> 01:52:06,408
What was it?

1229
01:52:07,076 --> 01:52:08,463
Mr. Glass.

1230
01:52:08,543 --> 01:52:09,511
Oh, yeah.
