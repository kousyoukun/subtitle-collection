Why do you act like you're not one of us?

163
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,382
When you're aiming, Casey,

164
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,039
always keep both eyes open.

165
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:23,611
Cover your target with the barrel
then move with it to get its pace.

166
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:26,381
I'm warning you,
it's gonna be frustrating the first times.

167
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:29,117
You're gonna shoot under it or behind it.

168
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:30,598
You'll learn to stay with it.

169
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,222
Females are smarter than the males.

170
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:35,957
But you know that, it's like humans.

171
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:37,592
(LAUGHS)

172
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:40,061
Females use their nose to stay alive.

173
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,430
They make sure they have cover.

174
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,566
They always remember they're
trying to stay alive.

175
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:48,436
Bucks go off by themselves.

176
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:51,339
Bucks get dumb during mating season.

177
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,042
Boys make too much noise.

178
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:56,277
(CHUCKLES) Yes, they do.

179
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:58,026
I'm better than a boy, right?

180
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:01,082
Yes, you are.

181
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,130
UNCLE JOHN: Hey.

182
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:06,234
(CAN OPENS)

183
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:11,139
I'll let you know when I hear
something that makes sense.

184
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:16,978
We don't even know what this is yet.

185
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:25,453
Hey! I was inspired.

186
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:32,113
No, no, no, that one.

187
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:34,549
That one, before the pink
frock coat with the thorns.

188
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:37,085
That's supposed to be like a tailored jacket,

189
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,500
but I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

190
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:43,058
(LAUGHS)

191
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:45,973
KAREN: I'm a simple blouse and
skirt person, but these...

192
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:51,332
These are very artistic, Barry.

193
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:55,736
Just the kind of thing Hamptons
ladies would spend $15,000 on

194
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:58,006
to wear once at a charity ball.

195
00:14:58,086 --> 00:14:59,707
- Shut up!
- (BOTH LAUGH)

196
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:02,243
You know, I can't stay too long.

197
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:04,079
This is just a visit.

198
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,993
Well, tell me what's going on.

199
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:09,550
What, you mean the email?

200
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,052
No, just the usual things.

201
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,520
Just feelings of being overwhelmed.

202
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,092
The terseness of your email made it
sound specific and time-related.

203
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:18,759
Are you looking for something?

204
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,461
- No.
- No?

205
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,330
I'm just admiring. I'm better now.

206
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,564
How's work?

207
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:24,732
It's great.

208
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:26,601
When I last spoke to them,

209
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:29,637
they believed you were a model employee.

210
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:33,474
They found you meticulous and conscientious.

211
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:35,310
- You know this, right?
- I do.

212
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,145
You've managed there for 10 years.

213
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:38,693
You're functioning very well, Barry.

214
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:43,384
And it's a rare and wonderful
place for you to work.

215
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:45,120
Yes, it is.

216
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,223
You know, of all my other
clients with your disorder,

217
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,705
you've been the most consistent at your job.

218
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,475
Did something happen, Barry?

219
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,611
How old are you?

220
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:01,269
Just... The Internet is
inconsistent on this point.

221
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,471
Why is that on your mind?

222
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:07,108
Who's gonna look after us
when you retire or pass on?

223
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,610
You know, we're gonna have
to take care of ourselves

224
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,646
and nobody even believes that we exist.

225
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,515
If ever something were to happen to me,

226
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:17,665
I've made arrangements with a colleague
from Baltimore to take over.

227
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,088
Hmm.

228
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:21,302
Hey, do you, uh...

229
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,291
You live alone?

230
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:24,725
You know this.

231
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:26,494
I'm sorry, I just meant how long?

232
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:27,675
(CHUCKLES) Always.

233
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,380
That must be so lonely.

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,310
Uh, you know what?

236
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,446
I'm doing much better. I shouldn't
have emailed you. I'm just...

237
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,328
Look at me. I'm too impulsive.

238
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:54,222
By the way, is anybody listening?

239
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:55,790
Does anybody care about us?

240
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,058
Yes.

241
00:16:57,138 --> 00:17:00,295
The University of Paris has asked
me to do a lecture, in fact.

242
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,498
I'm going to be doing it
via Skype from right here.

243
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:06,247
People are believing more.

244
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:09,804
Let's meet at our usual time next week.

245
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,187
I would rather you didn't leave, Barry.

246
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,144
Did something happen?

247
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,545
Don't worry.

248
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,713
This was just a visit.

249
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:20,381
I'm doing much better, I actually...

250
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,883
Don't you want your sketches, Barry?

251
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:25,266
You're usually very protective of them.

252
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:27,768
Yeah.

253
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:29,404
Thanks.

254
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,610
I'll see you next week at our usual time.

255
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:38,746
Thanks for fighting for us, Dr. Fletcher.

256
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:52,813
Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.

Welcome.

She will be kept separate.

493
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:22,296
You take off your skirt.
You take off your shirt.

494
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,344
Clothes you got all dirty from the dust.

495
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:53,760
One identity in an individual with
Dissociative Identity Disorder

496
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,994
can have high cholesterol.

497
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:56,430
One.

498
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,434
There have been cases where one
identity is allergic to bee stings.

499
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:02,202
The others are not.

500
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:06,940
Are there moments where two identities
can coexist at the same time?

501
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,743
There are times when two identities

502
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:13,313
can take the "light" or "the spot"

503
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,915
or consciousness at the same time.

504
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:18,885
This happened with a student
that I was working with.

505
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:22,989
And her left and right hand were taking notes

506
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:27,994
in different hand-writings about
separate things at the same time.

507
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:31,798
The differences in the
identities can be dramatic.

508
00:36:31,878 --> 00:36:35,635
As much as the difference between you and me

509
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:38,618
and every person in that auditorium.

510
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:41,741
The identities have different IQ's.

511
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:43,777
They have different physical strengths.

512
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:47,013
One personality is a Russian weightlifter

513
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:50,917
and can lift three times his body weight.

514
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,820
Their ability to hyper-focus

515
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,003
and have different experiences is astounding.

516
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:04,364
Have these individuals,
through their suffering,

517
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:07,381
unlocked the potential of the brain?

518
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:12,419
Is this the ultimate doorway

519
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,990
to all things we call unknown?

520
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,863
Is this where our sense of
the supernatural comes from?

521

(DOOR BUZZES)

522
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:39,579
It's about depth

523
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:43,470
and curves...

524
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,971
Hey, you see that one?

525
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:46,886
It's kind of like a chenille sweater-dress.

526
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:52,526
Who are you?

527
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:57,451
(MOUTHING)

528
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:58,732
Barry.

529
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:01,901
I don't think you are.

530
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:06,526
I've developed a nose for sensing

531
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:08,608
whom I'm talking to and whom I'm not.

532
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:11,765
Have I done something?

533
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:14,601
You've emailed for an unscheduled appointment

534
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:16,736
two days in a row.

535
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,652
We're just feeling overwhelmed.

536
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:20,887
Garden-variety issues.

537
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:27,080
I think Orwell or Jade or Samuel or Heinrich

538
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,916
had the light for a moment and emailed me.

539
00:38:29,996 --> 00:38:32,486
And you're here to tell me everything's okay.

540
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:34,100
I emailed you.

541
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:38,772
May I talk to one of them, please?

542
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:45,131
That can't happen.

543
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:46,700
I...

544
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,484
I told them that I wanted to spend
the session with you today.

545
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:54,808
I'm gonna ask again.

546
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:58,645
To whom am I speaking with now?

547
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:01,461
Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry.

548
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:04,884
It doesn't seem like Barry.

549
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:07,153
Barry is an extroverted leader.

550
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:08,602
Yes, I am.

551
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,427
I'm gonna take a professional guess

552
00:39:13,507 --> 00:39:17,163
based on the description of all 23 identities

553
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,699
that live in Kevin's body,

554
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:21,848
that I've gotten from Barry.

555
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:27,787
I think I'm talking to Dennis.

556
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:32,912
But he's been banned from the light

557
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:35,582
because, among other reasons,

558
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:39,986
he has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

559
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,921
which he himself knows is wrong

560
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:44,758
and has fought against with little success.

561
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:47,594
I'm encouraged we can finally meet.

562
00:39:47,674 --> 00:39:49,095
And I've guessed this

563
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:52,866
because you've adjusted the chocolate
dish twice since you came in here

564
00:39:52,946 --> 00:39:54,534
and I understand you have OCD.

That's clever, but I'm not Dennis.

for quite a while now.

570
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:07,981
Primarily, shall we say,
because of your beliefs.

did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

They're crepuscular, right?

657
00:45:53,439 --> 00:45:56,362
It means they travel around
during dusk and dawn.

You guys lied to me,
made me scared, etcetera.

Mr. Dennis, he says
you wear a lot of shirts.

Every one of us has to wait in a chair,

and Barry, he decides
who stands in the light.

But Barry lost that power because of me.

00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:40,726
I can wish myself into
the light anytime I want.

It's a special power.

712
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:48,434
Barry just has to keep sitting
in his chair if I want him to.

713
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:53,239
That's why Dennis and Miss Patricia
said I could be with them.

Dennis and Miss Patricia,
they believe in The Beast

00:50:58,211 --> 00:50:59,745
and what he can do.

716
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,582

00:51:10,223 --> 00:51:11,757
No. Can I kiss you?

I wanted to kiss the other girl with
the dark hair, but she's in trouble.

00:51:20,899 --> 00:51:22,255
So, do you want to?

much about kissing, though.

Wow.

743
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:35,694
Maybe I could watch you dance

744
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:38,444
and listen to music with you.

745
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:41,780
No, my music's in my room.

746
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:43,816
Oh. Right.

747
00:52:46,552 --> 00:52:47,553
Maybe

748
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:49,988
you could sneak me there.

749
00:52:51,657 --> 00:52:53,592
Are you trying to trick me?

750
00:52:54,327 --> 00:52:55,694
Etcetera?

751
00:52:56,829 --> 00:52:58,651
I'll tell on you.

752
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:00,253
I'm telling on you.

753
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,421
I'll tell you something.

754
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:04,657
And you can tell me
if I'm lying or not, okay?

755
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:06,639
- Mmm-hmm.
- Like a test. Okay?

756
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:16,882
I get into trouble at school, on purpose.

757
00:53:21,354 --> 00:53:23,656
So I can get sent to detention.

758
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:31,864
To get away from everyone.

759
00:53:38,571 --> 00:53:40,406
So that I can be alone.

760
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,853
Okay, I'll show you
something cool in my room.

761
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:57,175
Okay.

762
00:53:57,255 --> 00:54:00,659
But after Mr. Dennis has finished
his getting-ready ritual.

763
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,715
I have to go.

764
00:54:02,795 --> 00:54:04,517
He's got an appointment.

765
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:07,420
When I fall asleep, one of the others
keeps trying to reach the doctor lady

766
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,322
to tell on us.

767
00:54:09,402 --> 00:54:11,724
BARRY: That pant, it's got a red lining.

768
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:15,093
You can see it in
the long slit down the side.

769
00:54:15,173 --> 00:54:19,765
KAREN: We have been talking about
silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.

770
00:54:19,845 --> 00:54:22,768
Can I guess that you emailed
me in the middle of the night

771
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:28,040
for an emergency session
due to garden-variety issues?

772
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,576
(LAUGHS)

773
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:35,113
I was down and I emailed you and
I woke up and I feel better.

774
00:54:35,193 --> 00:54:36,929
I feel better.

775
00:54:39,131 --> 00:54:40,719
I had a thought.

776
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,020
Mmm-mmm.

777
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,823
I want to talk about the incident at work.

778
00:54:44,903 --> 00:54:46,525
It's okay, Barry.

779
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:48,394
You're safe.

780
00:54:48,474 --> 00:54:50,829
I just want to bring the details back.

781
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:52,945
We'll just talk about the details.

782
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,736
A high school from Camden, New Jersey

783
00:54:57,816 --> 00:55:00,906
was on a field trip at your place of work

784
00:55:00,986 --> 00:55:03,542
and two young ladies came up to you.

785
00:55:03,622 --> 00:55:06,479
And one took your hand

786
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,782
and put it under her shirt on her breast
and the second one did the same

787
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:12,885
and then they just ran off
laughing to their friends.

788
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:15,621
You surmised that it might be on a dare.

789
00:55:15,701 --> 00:55:18,056
You said they were 17 or 18.

790
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:20,092
You said it upset you for days.

791
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:23,175
It was just a teenage prank.
I get that now.

792
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:27,533
And see, that's my mistake.

793
00:55:27,613 --> 00:55:31,937
I believe that I went over this
incident with you too fast.

794
00:55:32,017 --> 00:55:34,807
Although you said you were fine,

795
00:55:34,887 --> 00:55:38,944
and the other identities
I met with said it was fine,

796
00:55:39,024 --> 00:55:43,181
I believe that this brought up issues

797
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:46,118
from when you were a child and abused.

798
00:55:46,198 --> 00:55:49,121
Sometimes another incident of abuse

799
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:51,904
can cause suppressed
personalities to take the light.

800
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:55,661
Dennis, if this is you,

801
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:58,063
I completely understand

802
00:55:58,143 --> 00:56:02,100
why you felt the need to take
over and protect the others.

803
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,469
(CHUCKLING) Please!

804
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:05,003
Doctor, not this again.

805
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:06,238
The others told me

806
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,776
that you and Patricia told
the group about this Beast.

807
00:56:10,856 --> 00:56:14,179
And I told them that these
are just scary stories

808
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:18,717
that Dennis and Patricia tell
the others to scare them.

809
00:56:18,797 --> 00:56:21,520
How this Beast can crawl on walls,

810
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,891
like the best rock climbers using
the slightest friction and imperfections

811
00:56:25,971 --> 00:56:30,696
to hold his body close
to seemingly sheer surfaces.

812
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:34,980
How his skin is thick and tough
like the hide of a rhinoceros.

813
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:41,887
Do you really believe
the stories about The Beast?

814
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:44,610
Hmm.

815
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,859
If this is you, Dennis,

816
00:56:48,093 --> 00:56:50,696
I understand why Kevin needs you.

817
00:56:52,565 --> 00:56:54,987
You are strong and disciplined.

818
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:59,171
You are precise and you
will not be taken advantage of.

819
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:02,941
You can trust me.

820
00:57:04,777 --> 00:57:06,164
For example,

821
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:10,703
I do have the ability to use Kevin's
full name and bring him forward

822
00:57:10,783 --> 00:57:12,050
as he has in the past.

823
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:15,674
But I wouldn't do that.

824
00:57:15,754 --> 00:57:19,912
I know that that would
be chaos for all of you.

825
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:21,914
Everyone would grab the light.

826
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:24,096
I don't want to hurt any of you that way.

827
00:57:25,998 --> 00:57:27,800
You don't have to hide.

828
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:32,070
I know you are someone who cares for Kevin.

829
00:57:34,807 --> 00:57:38,110
You are not evil to me.

830
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:42,848
You were necessary.

831
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,218

835
00:58:12,244 --> 00:58:15,347
Miss Patricia and I, we are ridiculed.

836
00:58:17,149 --> 00:58:21,286
Now, we're not perfect, but we
don't deserve to be ridiculed.

837
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:26,158
We're all struggling.
They have to admit that.

838
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:34,099
I am pleased to meet you, Dennis.

839
00:58:36,301 --> 00:58:37,802
You, too.

840
00:58:40,806 --> 00:58:45,130
I assume you don't know who emailed
me for the emergency sessions?

One of the others.

842
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:49,602
Are you in charge?

843
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:51,804
Yeah, we've taken charge.

844
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:54,072
We're the only ones that can protect Kevin.

845
00:58:54,152 --> 00:58:56,154
We're all here to protect Kevin.

846
00:58:56,922 --> 00:58:58,223
He's very weak.

847
00:59:01,193 --> 00:59:04,282
He doesn't know how powerful we can be.

848
00:59:04,362 --> 00:59:07,032
Would you mind telling me when
you first came into existence?

849
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:16,174
And how you and Patricia, the other
undesirable identity, became aligned?

850
00:59:19,778 --> 00:59:20,878
That's okay.

851
00:59:21,446 --> 00:59:23,248
Do you still have strong beliefs?

852
00:59:24,249 --> 00:59:26,104
That depends on what.

853
00:59:26,184 --> 00:59:29,421
This story of The Beast.

854
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:39,151
One thing, Dennis, that may
comfort you if you are confused

855
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:43,088
is that you've met the other alters.

856
00:59:43,168 --> 00:59:45,804
You're all in a room in chairs, right?

857
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:48,160
Yeah.

858
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,262
But you never met The Beast.

859
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:52,865
Because he doesn't reside
with the rest of you.

860
00:59:52,945 --> 00:59:56,101
Because he resides in the
train yard, as the story goes,

861
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:58,303
because Kevin's dad left on a train.

862
00:59:58,383 --> 01:00:03,288
But the fact is, you and Patricia
have never met The Beast.

863
01:00:03,922 --> 01:00:04,923
Have you?

864
01:00:06,324 --> 01:00:07,225
No.

865
01:00:08,393 --> 01:00:10,362
That's because he's not an alter.

866
01:00:11,797 --> 01:00:13,999
He's not the 24th identity.

867
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:17,235
He's a fantasy.

987

Casey.

988
01:09:47,739 --> 01:09:48,773
I'm your uncle.

989
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:53,845
Stop it, Casey.

990
01:09:55,413 --> 01:09:57,269
Put that gun down.

991
01:09:57,349 --> 01:09:58,903
I'm getting upset.

992
01:09:58,983 --> 01:10:00,772
I'm about to get very angry.

993
01:10:00,852 --> 01:10:01,886

Dennis,

1006

Kevin is really lucky to have you.

1007
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,410
You are quite extraordinary.

1008
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:47,692
I just don't want you guys to get hurt.

1009

01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:03,040
And can we talk?

1013
01:12:05,142 --> 01:12:07,812
I know you wanna tell me something.

1014
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,115
Why don't you just tell me?

1015
01:12:26,664 --> 01:12:28,886
DENNIS: We're very similar, you and I.

1016
01:12:28,966 --> 01:12:30,922
Both on the outside, looking in.

1021

in a building on the south side,
but we prefer it here.

1022

1025
01:12:59,531 --> 01:13:00,698
Kevin

1026
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:05,102
and what his mother did to him.

1027
01:13:06,704 --> 01:13:08,893
I remember it all.

1028
01:13:08,973 --> 01:13:12,063
I'm happy you're suddenly so open.

1029
01:13:12,143 --> 01:13:14,732
Kevin's mother had rather malevolent ways

1030
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:17,569
of punishing a three-year-old.

1031
01:13:17,649 --> 01:13:19,236
Is that when you arrived in the light?

1032
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:20,184
Yeah.

1033
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,610
The one way to avoid her attention
was to keep everything spotless,

1034
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,992
everything perfect.

1035
01:13:30,595 --> 01:13:33,150
I know you're coming from
good intentions, Dennis,

1036
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:36,020
but there are other ways to help Kevin now.

1037
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:41,092
I've lost so many patients into the system.

1038
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:44,962
I want you to know, Dennis,
I will never stop fighting for you.

1039
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:48,800
My patients have become my family.

1040
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,169
They are what I've chosen instead
of a more traditional path.

1041
01:13:52,249 --> 01:13:55,840
I hope you feel you can
be truly honest with me.

1042
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,289
I actually wanna be honest with you.

1043
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:02,614
I lied before.

1044
01:14:02,694 --> 01:14:05,296
When you asked if I'd ever met The Beast,

1045
01:14:06,197 --> 01:14:08,085
I said no.

1046
01:14:08,165 --> 01:14:09,533
That really isn't true.

1047
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:18,796
You wrote about a woman in Germany
who'd been blind for 10 years.

1048
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:22,299
And then, it was discovered that she had DID.

1049
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:26,671
Then three of her identities developed sight.

1050
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:31,108
And you speculated that her
optical nerves regenerated

1051
01:14:31,188 --> 01:14:33,978
because of her beliefs.

1052
01:14:34,058 --> 01:14:36,080
What are you trying to say?

1053
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,818
There are things, Dr. Fletcher,
that all of us would find hard to believe.

1054
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:43,888
Are you trying to tell me
there's a 24th identity?

1055
01:14:43,968 --> 01:14:46,323
You protect the broken.

1056
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:50,061
When you said that you thought
this situation was extraordinary,

1057
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:52,597
I knew you can maybe understand.

1058
01:14:52,677 --> 01:14:53,998
Understand what?

1059
01:14:54,078 --> 01:14:55,079
The Beast

1060
01:14:56,881 --> 01:14:58,349
is real.

1061
01:14:59,651 --> 01:15:01,238
He's just emerged.

1062
01:15:01,318 --> 01:15:03,755
You were right about everything.

1063
01:15:04,956 --> 01:15:06,190
What does he look like?

1064
01:15:08,259 --> 01:15:10,882
He's much bigger than I am

1065
01:15:10,962 --> 01:15:12,964
and I'm the biggest of all of us.

1066
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:15,620
He's tall.

1067
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,022
He's very muscular.

1068
01:15:18,102 --> 01:15:20,658
And he's got a long mane of hair

1069
01:15:20,738 --> 01:15:24,942
and his fingers are twice the length of ours.

1070
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,601
He believes we are extraordinary.

1071
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:33,951
That we don't represent
a mistake, but our potential.

1072
01:15:36,888 --> 01:15:38,790
You say the same things.

1073
01:15:41,358 --> 01:15:43,260
He's on the move.

1074
01:15:43,861 --> 01:15:45,296
What does that mean?

1075
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:48,199
I don't understand.

1076
01:15:49,366 --> 01:15:51,168
He can't be real.

1077
01:15:52,904 --> 01:15:56,674
There must be limits to what
a human being can become.

1078
01:15:58,375 --> 01:15:59,797
And there's another whole part

1079
01:15:59,877 --> 01:16:02,199
of the story, isn't there?

1080
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:05,837
About the eating of the impure young?

1081
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:08,640
What does impure even mean?

1082
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,941
Well...

1083
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:11,108
We should discuss that

1084
01:16:11,188 --> 01:16:13,277
so that you can understand fully.

in a proper session tomorrow.
