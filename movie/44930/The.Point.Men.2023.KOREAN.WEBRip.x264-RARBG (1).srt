5
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:47,591
This film is inspired by actual events,

6
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:50,508
but all characters and situations
have been fictionalized.

7
00:00:56,592 --> 00:01:01,508
On Sept. 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda led by
Osama bin Laden attacked the US.

8
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:10,050
The US declared war on Afghanistan
for giving refuge to bin Laden.

9
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,549
38 countries joined the war,

10
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,383
with South Korea sending hundreds
of non-combat troops.

11
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,507
After losing power to a pro-US government,

12
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:28,675
the Taliban turned to suicide bombing
and kidnapping foreigners.

AFGHANISTAN, ZABUL PROVINCE

SEPTEMBER 19, 2006

15
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,299
Let us pray.

16
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,882
Lord, please bestow Your grace
on this barren land.

17
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:25,551
Amen!

18
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:29,299
And please let the seeds
we plant today take root.

19
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,216
Help the people of this
land to understand that

20
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:35,174
- Jehovah is their...
- Lord.

21
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:36,882
- One god.
- Amen!

22
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:41,882
We believe the Lord Jesus
will be the King of all peace!

23
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:42,883
Amen!

24
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:47,050
Everyone okay?

25
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:50,717
What's going on?

26
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:54,632
Open the door!

27
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,424
I'm just a bus driver.

28
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,684
Please don't hurt me!

29
00:02:58,675 --> 00:02:59,842
Open up, now!

30
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:19,175
Quiet!

31
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:34,175
THE POINT MEN

32
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,258
SOUTH KOREA, FOREIGN MINISTRY

33
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:47,957
Deputy Kim!

34
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,299
Yes?

35
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,541
What happened?

36
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:53,457
They were supposed to arrive at
Kandahar yesterday, but they didn't.

37
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:57,757
That's not what I mean!
There's a travel ban on that country!

38
00:04:57,758 --> 00:05:02,466
They entered Dubai through Beijing,
so we never expected...

39
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,633
Just kill me already.

40
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,957
What is this?

41
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,042
They're all from the same church.

42
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:15,466
What's their purpose for going there?

43
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:18,967
We believe it's short-term missionary work.

44
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,884
- What?
- Look!

45
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:35,925
We demand the Korean government to pull
its troops out of Afghanistan immediately

46
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,632
and promptly release 23 Taliban warriors
locked in Kabul Prison.

47
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:47,966
Tell the Press Office that all media
should describe them as volunteers.

48
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:48,750
What?

49
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,507
Run, or they're all dead!

50
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:51,384
Yes, sir!

51
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,466
- Bae!
- Yes?

52
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:53,966
- Call a meeting quickly.
- Yes, sir.

53
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,174
- Check with foreign press.
- Yes.

54
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:59,132
If our request is not met by then,
we'll kill the hostages.

55
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,675
We give you 24 hours.

56
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,800
KARACHI PRISON, PAKISTAN

57
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,383
Come out!

58
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,592
What is going on?

59
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,425
Sign here.

60
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:42,175
Park Dae-sik

61
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:45,092
A hard stay, right?

62
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,799
Three months. No, was it four?

63
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,091
Can't even remember.

64
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,967
Counterfeiting dollars was a bit extreme.

65
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:15,342
Was it my decision?

66
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:17,800
You said you'd pull me out quickly.

67
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:21,966
Is this how the nation
treats one who risks his life?

68
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:25,257
You know counterfeiting
is a sensitive issue here.

69
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,258
Okay!

70
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:29,675
Go to Kabul.

71
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:40,508
Let's not see each other again.

72
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,466
What's with your attitude?

73
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,633
- People were kidnapped!
- You take care of it.

74
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,258
It's 23 people!

75
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:10,174
Hurry!

76
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,175
Hurry up!

77
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:30,507
We will soon be landing at
Kabul International Airport.

78
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:34,882
The time in Kabul is 8:24 a.m.,
with a temperature of 31 degrees.

79
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:37,216
Please fasten your seatbelts and return
your tray tables to the upright position.

80
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,217
Vice Minister.

81
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:40,966
- Vice Minister!
- Huh?

82
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,883
We're landing. Please put on your seatbelt.

83
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:43,884
Okay.

84
00:08:56,633 --> 00:09:00,800
KABUL, CAPITAL OF AFGHANISTAN

85
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,175
5 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

86
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,050
Welcome.

87
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,174
How is it with the Afghan government?

88
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:44,800
The ambassador is doing all he can,
but they won't budge.

89
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,800
Please come with me.

90
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:22,007
What is it?

91
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:23,425
He's an intelligence agent.

92
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:33,424
Are you the negotiator?

93
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,217
What's your strategy?

94
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:47,007
They like to show they mean business,

95
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,717
so send some positive signal
before they kill someone.

96
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:52,967
Understand?

97
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,174
Isn't that the freak
who was screwing around in Pakistan?

98
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,466
Yes, sir.

99
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,674
Didn't he get kicked out? Why is he here?

100
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:11,674
I heard he helped deal with
the Korean hostage incident in Iraq.

101
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,424
But that hostage died.

102
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:17,924
Intelligence officers are
so scarce in this region...

103
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:21,342
They must really be desperate for agents.

104
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:41,967
AFGHAN FOREIGN MINISTRY

105
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:48,541
Two days ago, two German deporters
were kidnapped in the exact same area.

106
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:54,207
I don't understand why the Koreans
did not ask our government for protection.

107
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,417
Especially when they are moving
in such a large group.

108
00:11:57,418 --> 00:12:01,793
Tell him to stop lecturing
and release those prisoners.

109
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:08,555
The most important thing right now
is to bring them back, right?

110
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:13,043
Please release some Taliban prisoners
in exchange for the Koreans,

111
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:16,063
like you did last time
for the Italian deporter.

112
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:19,749
The Italian deporter again.

113
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,918
That was a very exceptional case.

114
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,566
And it was one person at that time.

115
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:28,586
This time, there are many. Way too many.

116
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:37,707
You are aware that the kidnappers
asked us to withdraw the troops.

117
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,547
Yes, I know.

118
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:44,418
But the Korean troops were scheduled
to go back at the end of the year anyway.

119
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,933
They gave you a very easy task.

120
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,891
We could postpone it.

121
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:58,136
We could even consider sending more troops

122
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:02,852
to expand the medical facilities
and roads in Afghanistan.

123
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:12,341
The Afghan Foreign Minister has
decided to hold a press conference.

124
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,592
Here's Director Jeong.

125
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:19,049
How long do you think it'll take
to exchange prisoners?

126
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,174
It doesn't seem it will take too long.

127
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:26,049
But America's stance is most important,

128
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,716
so I think you should contact Washington.

129
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:29,924
Got it.

130
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:31,257
Good work.

131
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:32,592
Yes, thank you!

132
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:41,217
ROK EMBASSY ABDUCTION RESPONSE HQ

133
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,508
Tell me the terms of the agreement.

134
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:01,883
Did you not hear me?

135
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,707
Look, don't you have
any sense of procedure?

136
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,799
Instead of just bursting in,
go through official channels.

137
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,841
I've got no use for that.

138
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:18,467
Will they really release Taliban prisoners?

139
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:26,092
The Afghans will never do a deal
over the troop withdrawal.

140
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:31,174
How do you know about that?

141
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:34,507
That's a diplomatic
secret sent over the hotline!

142
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:37,389
Are you wiretapping us?

143
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,704
I won't let this slide!

144
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:44,092
What do you know about this country?

145
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:48,883
People here grind their teeth
at the mention of the Taliban.

146
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:55,966
The president almost got sacked
when he tried to release a few prisoners.

147
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:59,508
You think he'll let 23 go free?

148
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:02,467
Sir, it's starting.

149
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,425
Hussein! Hussein!

150
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,207
"We are working closely
with the South Korean government

151
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,874
"to solve this hostage crisis."

152
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,167
Will you accept the Taliban's demand
to release the prisoners?

153
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,570
"Under no circumstances
will we release the Taliban prisoners."

154
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,899
"The Afghan government is
considering all other options

155
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,674
"to ensure that none
of the Korean hostages are hurt."

156
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:55,169
What are those bastards saying?

157
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,259
Jeong, what's going on?

158
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,467
It's from Seoul.

159
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:05,458
Yes, Chief.

160
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,207
Didn't you say you reached an agreement?

161
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:12,675
It seems there was a misunderstanding.

162
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,966
Yes, we'll get it cleared up soon.

163
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,273
We've got one hour left!

164
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,133
I know, but...

165
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,674
The Afghan officials aren't picking up?

166
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:34,800
What? Not yet...

167
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,633
What's with this traffic?

168
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:41,799
I'm losing my mind...

169
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,257
Is there any shortcut?

170
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:44,966
Should we try going through the alleys?

171
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,008
Sure.

172
00:16:58,383 --> 00:16:59,717
Shit...

173
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:22,008
Even more packed here.

174
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,757
Hey, how much time is left?

175
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,341
40 minutes.

176
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:29,425
Jeez.

177
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,675
Let's take the opposite lane.

178
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,715
Are you blind?

179
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:48,499
Sorry, sorry!

180
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,292
Slowly. Okay, let's go.

181
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,717
- Are you crazy?
- Are you blind?

182
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,966
What is it now?

183
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:01,216
How far is it?

184
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:03,091
It's at the second intersection,
on the corner.

185
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:04,424
Vice Minister!

186
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:06,799
There's no time, I think we should walk.

187
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,300
But arriving on foot...

188
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,883
Hurry, it's fine!

189
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:14,800
Seriously?

190
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,875
Allah is the Greatest!

191
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,592
Is he still not picking up?

192
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:48,175
Sir! Are you okay?

193
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:52,050
Vice Minister, are you hurt?

194
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:58,216
Hello?

195
00:19:58,217 --> 00:19:59,842
Director Jeong?

196
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:02,007
We have 30 minutes left.

197
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:03,633
What do you think will happen?

198
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,591
I think they'll be killed.

199
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:07,800
How do we stop them?

200
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,645
Announce that we'll withdraw troops,

201
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:13,707
and contact the OIC quickly.
Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)

202
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,749
Changing our stance means
admitting we made a mistake.

203
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:24,675
If you look at the situation here,

204
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:28,550
there is no other way.

205
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,924
Minister! You announced a withdrawal?

206
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:38,258
Are we giving in to terrorists
after negotiations failed?

207
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:46,049
What's the backdrop to this hasty decision?

208
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,050
Minister!

209
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:54,924
Director! The Taliban
extended the deadline!

210
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:56,382
What?

211
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:58,075
- By how much?
- 24 hours.

212
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,174
Take good care of the Vice Minister.

213
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:04,424
What?

214
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:06,175
- Director!
- Where are you going?

215
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:40,570
Don't you think you
should see a doctor first?

216
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:44,732
I thought we had an agreement.
Why did you back down?

217
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:47,279
Don't be upset.

218
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,291
We think it is very regretful

219
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:53,945
that the Korean government had
to give in to the Taliban's demand.

220
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:58,638
We feel the same that
the Afghan government broke our agreement!

221
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,757
All you care about is
getting the hostages released.

222
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:06,875
But we have to keep fighting the Taliban,

223
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:08,747
even after you leave.

224
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:11,957
Please understand that for us,

225
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,667
this is a very complicated decision.

226
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,374
Listen to me.

227
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,906
What does it take to release the prisoners?

228
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:22,934
Aid?

229
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:25,558
Or American consent?

230
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,701
Answer me. Next time,
there may be no extensions.

231
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:32,957
Don't get desperate.

232
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,716
This is exactly what the Taliban want.

233
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,805
You sound like you don't care if they die.

234
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:43,177
They are innocent people. Just civilians!

235
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,263
You really believe they are innocent?

236
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,005
Excuse me?

237
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:57,201
Hello.

238
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,469
Okay.

239
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:04,820
I have a very urgent
matter I have to attend to.

240
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:07,332
- If you don't mind.
- No, no!

241
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,672
We are not done.

242
00:23:08,673 --> 00:23:10,974
A German hostage has been murdered.

243
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:15,898
Next will be a Korean.

244
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:17,349
Mr. Jeong.

245
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:22,505
Do you believe what the Taliban really want
is the prisoners' release?

246
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,528
Are you saying there's something else?

247
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:29,091
I think we already told you.

248
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:36,114
Salaam.

249
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,544
Do you know this guy?

250
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:41,846
You seen him?

251
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:48,103
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

252
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:49,572
Do you know this guy?

253
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:53,709
Ask at the second floor restaurant
across the street.

254
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:22,175
Hurry up!

255
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:34,979
Are you Qasim?

256
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:38,697
What is he saying?

257
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:41,957
Qasim is busy now.

258
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,208
Qasim doesn't know Korean.

259
00:24:49,258 --> 00:24:50,258
Hey!

260
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,008
Lee Bong-han!

261
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,341
You know me?

262
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:58,502
Come outside.

263
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,007
If you're tired, move to a hotel.

264
00:25:03,008 --> 00:25:06,425
No, I have to hold down the fort.

265
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,592
Are you okay?

266
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:15,591
The Afghans said we could
pay a ransom for the prisoners?

267
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:17,092
Why didn't you tell me?

268
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:19,541
Bargain with terrorists?

269
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:21,549
Are you out of your mind?

270
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,124
What did the Germans get
for sticking to their principles?

271
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,632
Their hostage was murdered!

272
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,072
I'll report to the Minister.

273
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,424
The world will see us as pushovers
if word gets out!

274
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:40,925
Our aim is to prevent killings,
not protect our reputation!

275
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:42,926
Everyone here knows that!

276
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,591
Sit still for now.

277
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:48,799
The intelligence service said
they'll solve it in two days.

278
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,116
Two days?

279
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:52,257
We only have a day.

280
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:53,633
What can the NIS do?

281
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:55,134
The Jirga!

282
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:57,508
The Jirga.

283
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:03,216
The Jirga is a council
of Afghan tribal leaders.

284
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:08,799
In a practical sense, all issues in
Afghanistan are decided by them.

285
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,299
If they issue a decision,

286
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,716
the hostages can be released
without an exchange of prisoners.

287
00:26:14,717 --> 00:26:21,217
Currently, our elite agent and
a local coordinator are making contact.

288
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,716
What's wrong?

289
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:29,342
What? Let's go.

290
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,666
He says the mule must rest.

291
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:41,716
Or you can pay another
10 thousand afghanis.

292
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,425
What a crook.

293
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,217
We're not even halfway there.

294
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:52,507
This is the only road?

295
00:26:52,508 --> 00:26:53,675
Sure.

296
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,800
I'm serious.

297
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:08,717
Okay, 20 thousand.

298
00:27:09,764 --> 00:27:12,124
And another 20 if we get there before dark.

299
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,932
Okay? Go.

300
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,092
Dae-sik, you should pay him through me.

301
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:22,925
Wait up!

302
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:30,966
PASHTUN TRIBAL VILLAGE

303
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:34,217
19 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

304
00:27:35,258 --> 00:27:37,466
Greetings.

305
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:39,632
This man says he knows Ismael.

306
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:41,383
They are Koreans.

307
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:53,842
Smile.

308
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:00,424
You know Ismael?

309
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:02,424
Do I know him?

310
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:05,716
I saved him by taking him
to the Korean medical unit

311
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:11,374
to get surgery after a bomb exploded.

312
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,063
You did?

313
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:23,175
Any friend of my nephew is my friend.

314
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,591
But what brings you all the way here?

315
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:30,291
He's asking why we're here.

316
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,500
It's because of the Korean hostages.

317
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:36,508
It's because of the Korean hostages.

318
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:45,592
These people came all this way
for volunteer work.

319
00:28:54,875 --> 00:29:02,875
And he brought this
gift as a peace offering.

320
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:04,797
It's the latest phone.

321
00:29:08,258 --> 00:29:10,049
Rotate to open.

322
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,890
Rotate to close.

323
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:21,258
See, they love anything made in Korea.

324
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:35,174
How do you know about this?

325
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:36,967
You think I'm here to play?

326
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:42,382
You said there's no road.

327
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:45,757
There isn't... it's all minefields.

328
00:29:45,758 --> 00:29:46,898
Damn you!

329
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:53,788
I'm Jeong Jae-ho, representing
Korean government.

330
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:55,632
Nice to meet you.

331
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:58,716
This is Jeong Jae-ho.

332
00:29:58,717 --> 00:30:01,300
He's a representative of
the Korean government.

333
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:05,842
Welcome.

334
00:30:07,342 --> 00:30:08,967
Come in.

335
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:13,466
Hello, I'm Afghanistan's only
Pashtun-Korean interpreter,

336
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:15,632
Abdul Kareem Qasim...

337
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:19,133
Qasim for short, just call me Qasim!

338
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,841
You're a Korean? That's amazing.

339
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:25,758
- I'll need your help, then.
- Yes.

340
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,382
What are you doing here?

341
00:30:28,383 --> 00:30:31,175
What? I am cooperating.

342
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:32,884
Don't you dare butt in here.

343
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,258
Step aside. I'll handle this my way.

344
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,342
This place has its own rules.

345
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:48,633
We don't have time for this.
23 lives depend on us.

346
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,175
Sir, please calculate my fee separately.

347
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:13,467
A professional negotiator like you
is really in another class!

348
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:19,632
A hospital in the chief's name,
building a school...

349
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:22,008
That's not class, it's cash.

350
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:26,717
So a new mobile phone is more classy?

351
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,841
You both work for the country,
no need to bicker.

352
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:35,174
Doesn't matter what path you take
to get to the same place.

353
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:37,883
And the phone did the trick. Nice job.

354
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:50,967
Is he really a key figure within the Jirga?

355
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:55,758
For sure.

356
00:31:57,342 --> 00:31:59,249
He's royal family.

357
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,841
Royal family?

358
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:03,092
Family lines are important in Islam.

359
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,549
There are some families
even the Taliban can't touch.

360
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,800
So we need to win over that tribal chief.

361
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,424
Korean! Join us.

362
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:28,966
I think they're testing us.

363
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:29,967
Wait.

364
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:33,299
Don't underestimate their pride.

365
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,467
If you refuse,
they'll think you don't respect them.

366
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,758
Have a smoke!

367
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:05,466
That isn't tobacco,
it's a strong strain of hashish.

368
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,716
One more time!

369
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:09,382
He says to smoke more, but don't do it.

370
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:10,520
I'm fine!

371
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,508
Great!

372
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,425
Someone's coming...

373
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:02,007
He said he'll help us.

374
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:05,675
He said the hostages will be safe
as we discuss the matter.

375
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,549
They're helping us
because they want to show

376
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,633
that Islam respects honor
and is welcoming to guests.

377
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,967
JIRGA ASSEMBLY

378
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:58,883
They decided to let them go.

379
00:35:00,592 --> 00:35:02,258
Really? For real?

380
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,549
Wow!

381
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,591
Great work, really!

382
00:35:07,592 --> 00:35:08,967
Thank you!

383
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:14,133
I'll buy you a drink back in Korea!

384
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:18,029
I'm not going back to Korea.

385
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:22,217
I like this area.

386
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:27,792
I like feeling I'm the only one
between sky and earth.

387
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,883
Hey! Listen up!

388
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:43,967
They agreed to release the hostages!

389
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:52,341
What kind of reaction is that?

390
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:55,674
Anyway, my great translating

391
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:58,632
and pretending to know
Ismael played a big part.

392
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:00,225
You're not friends with Ismael?

393
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:03,425
One in three guys here is named Ismael.

394
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,791
That tickles.

395
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,334
Have you no fear,
pulling a prank like that?

396
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,842
Jeez...

397
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,633
Now, let's settle the payment.

398
00:36:25,842 --> 00:36:27,216
FOREIGN MINISTRY

399
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:28,425
Director.

400
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:29,882
What?

401
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:33,716
There's no plane that
can take all 23 of them.

402
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:35,258
Should I book a private plane?

403
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:40,341
Who are they, Olympic gold medalists?

404
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:42,133
Find some connecting flights!

405
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:43,134
Yes, sir.

406
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:48,092
What is it?

407
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:54,757
So why do missionaries
keep taking these reckless trips?

408
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:57,049
If one dies on a mission...

409
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,499
Don't just stand there.
Call the TV station!

410
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,581
Yes, sir!

411
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:06,174
In fact, they all wrote their wills
before flying to Afghanistan.

412
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:07,549
Yes?

413
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,791
This is the Foreign Ministry.

414
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,049
Sorry?

415
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,633
What you're broadcasting
now is very dangerous.

416
00:37:12,634 --> 00:37:14,343
It could provoke the Taliban!

417
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:20,424
How can I control their opinions?
They aren't reading off a script.

418
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:23,674
If something happens to the hostages,
will you take responsibility?

419
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,382
Stop the broadcast now!

420
00:37:25,383 --> 00:37:29,299
How can I cut off a live broadcast?

421
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,466
The Taliban don't understand Korean,
what's the problem?

422
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,874
Sorry, I've got to go.

423
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,709
We're broadcasting.

424
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,091
No, go away.

425
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:45,591
I'm sorry, but everything is settled.

426
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:47,591
Swindler!

427
00:37:47,592 --> 00:37:48,883
Dae-sik, let's go!

428
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:01,757
What is he saying?

429
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:04,091
He's asking why we lied to them?

430
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:05,229
What?

431
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,749
He asked why we told them
they were volunteers...

432
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,375
Why are they on TV?

433
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,460
Shit...

434
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,666
Listen to me. They're not missionaries.

435
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:23,612
You've got to insist
they're volunteers, okay?

436
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:26,300
This is unforgivable!

437
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:28,591
Volunteers! Volunteers!

438
00:38:28,592 --> 00:38:30,216
They're not volunteers.

439
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:31,217
Chief!

440
00:38:31,883 --> 00:38:33,104
We're not lying!

441
00:38:41,217 --> 00:38:44,966
The hostages are currently
held in three groups,

442
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:50,133
with the first eight scheduled
for release tomorrow morning.

443
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,675
The press conference will resume
after a 10-minute break.

444
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,799
What do you mean we have to pay the ransom?

445
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,466
The negotiation failed!

446
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:14,882
Every broadcast here
is quoting Korean news,

447
00:39:14,883 --> 00:39:17,550
reporting that the
hostages are missionaries.

448
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:19,591
Is this true?

449
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:23,758
Al Jazeera is broadcasting
the Korean feed with subtitles.

450
00:39:26,342 --> 00:39:29,632
The Afghans will mediate
the ransom payment.

451
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,749
Is there no other way?

452
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,216
It's the most realistic,
preferable option now.

453
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:38,957
Director Jeong, don't be so inflexible.

454
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:42,882
Why don't you try negotiating
through the Jirga one more time?

455
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,268
It's over with the Jirga, Chief!

456
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,466
Minister, you need to decide quickly.

457
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:51,592
We'll discuss it, so just wait.

458
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:53,800
Is that so?

459
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:56,622
Okay, thanks.

460
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:02,091
What is it?

461
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:04,425
An Asian body has been found in Musheky.

462
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:07,299
No, that can't be!

463
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,049
Wait, what is it now?

464
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,966
I have to go home!

465
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:13,253
Let's go check.

466
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:15,815
Shit...

467
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:40,300
These people are from
the Korean government.

468
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,800
5 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING

469
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:35,175
For crying out loud...

470
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:42,776
What's this?

471
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:44,467
Wait!

472
00:41:45,342 --> 00:41:47,675
Vice Minister!

473
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:50,883
I found this on a Taliban website.

474
00:41:51,883 --> 00:41:56,499
My name is Hong Mi-sook.

475
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,424
I am Korean and I work as a nurse.

476
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:04,842
This is my first time visiting Afghanistan.

477
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:11,508
Everyone here is kind and treating us well.

478
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:19,592
We are provided with
a great meal and bed every day.

479
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:27,092
I miss my family.

480
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,924
I strongly urge

481
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:42,966
the Korean government
take more active steps

482
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:44,925
to save its people.

483
00:42:48,824 --> 00:42:50,499
What did he say?

484
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,505
He said they never asked for money.

485
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:02,875
The only way for the Korean hostages to go
home is the release of Taliban prisoners.

486
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,749
We warn the Korean government.

487
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:21,124
Persuade the Afghan government to
release Taliban prisoners within 24 hours

488
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,542
or we will kill more hostages.

489
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:32,174
Mr. Negotiator, now what?

490
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:35,008
All right, don't panic.

491
00:43:36,174 --> 00:43:38,707
The Taliban want us to panic.

492
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:41,841
How can I not panic right now?

493
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:45,591
Just give me a chance to think!

494
00:43:45,592 --> 00:43:47,342
Think?

495
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:51,091
People are dying while you think!

496
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:52,966
Watch your mouth!

497
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,299
Have you gone mad?

498
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,132
Hey, stop it!

499
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,050
What are you doing?

500
00:44:18,462 --> 00:44:19,931
- One more.
- Sure.

501
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:26,800
Neither America, nor President Karzai

502
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:30,883
will ever hand over the prisoners.

503
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,508
There's only one way.

504
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,174
Direct negotiation.

505
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:42,279
Never.

506
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,438
That's absolutely ridiculous.

507
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,717
Why?

508
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,883
Are you afraid to meet the Taliban?

509
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,550
It figures...

510
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,800
The dweeb who spends his life
in an air-conditioned office

511
00:45:00,883 --> 00:45:04,300
would pee his pants
when meeting the Taliban.

512
00:45:08,425 --> 00:45:12,174
Do you know what it means to sit
at the same table as the Taliban?

513
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:15,591
There is a Maginot line that
can't be crossed in diplomacy.

514
00:45:15,592 --> 00:45:19,966
The moment a diplomat sits
face to face with the Taliban,

515
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:25,008
South Korea becomes a country
that surrendered to terrorists.

516
00:45:25,009 --> 00:45:27,593
It would be a crushing diplomatic loss!

517
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:31,342
Diplomacy...

518
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,217
Mr. Diplomat,

519
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,675
you can eat this.

520
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:48,342
Then send me. I'll go.

521
00:45:50,258 --> 00:45:54,175
Why? You want to make up
for what happened in Iraq?

522
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:03,500
You think I do this for myself?

523
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,959
Here's some personal advice.

524
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,424
Just go back to Korea.

525
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:19,799
Staying stuck in the past,
roaming around this place

526
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,425
that would drive anyone crazy.

527
00:46:53,383 --> 00:46:55,425
Save me!

528
00:46:58,383 --> 00:47:01,217
Please save me...

529
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,466
It's all my fault...

530
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:09,591
Watch, and then tell your government!

531
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:11,842
I want to go home!

532
00:47:13,008 --> 00:47:14,008
No...

533
00:47:54,923 --> 00:47:57,993
Are you Mr. Park from
South Korea Intelligence Service?

534
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,716
Let me get this straight.

535
00:48:11,717 --> 00:48:16,666
So that broker persuaded the Taliban
to change their list of prisoners,

536
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:20,799
and we'll be able to get
those inmates released?

537
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,540
Yes, how many times do I have to tell you?

538
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:27,957
Abdullah is no simple broker.

539
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:32,049
He's a British businessman who dealt
with the Taliban before the war,

540
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,799
and has intervened in such
kidnappings countless times.

541
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,799
How do we get those inmates out of prison?

542
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,071
An inside job.

543
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:42,674
How is that possible, especially
with the U.S. military against it?

544
00:48:42,675 --> 00:48:45,007
Since it's in Ghazni, it's possible.

545
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:48,582
The central government has
less control over that region.

546
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,591
Jailbreaks happen often.

547
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:52,341
How much does he want?

548
00:48:52,342 --> 00:48:53,674
Two million dollars.

549
00:48:53,675 --> 00:48:54,675
What?

550
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:08,399
Mr. Abdullah, until now, the Taliban
demanded we release 23 prisoners.

551
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,864
Now suddenly, they changed the list?

552
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:13,374
I don't understand.

553
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:16,707
The Taliban also feel uncomfortable
about these killings.

554
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:20,671
As the clock is ticking,
they are having internal disagreements.

555
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:23,716
If given the chance,
they prefer to negotiate.

556
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,434
You are not Afghan. Why get involved?

557
00:49:29,348 --> 00:49:32,499
As someone who understands the Afghans,

558
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,137
I truly want these Koreans
to go back to their families.

559
00:49:49,935 --> 00:49:51,754
No trust.

560
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,461
No deal.

561
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:55,169
I'm wasting my time here.

562
00:49:58,091 --> 00:49:59,911
Just a moment, please.

563
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:05,716
What's the problem?

564
00:50:05,717 --> 00:50:07,132
He's settled kidnapping cases?

565
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,341
Then let's check with
the British government.

566
00:50:09,342 --> 00:50:12,924
Everyone working here has
fake names and nationalities.

567
00:50:12,925 --> 00:50:15,175
A background check will take too long.

568
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:17,718
We have to go with our gut feeling.

569
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:21,549
Please decide quickly.

570
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,882
There's no time to sit and think.

571
00:50:23,883 --> 00:50:25,882
We need to properly check first!

572
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:28,966
What if there's another victim?
Will you take the blame?

573
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:32,549
If she's ready, put her on the phone.

574
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,709
Hello?

575
00:50:34,522 --> 00:50:35,834
Will this buy your trust?

576
00:50:37,936 --> 00:50:39,100
Two minutes.

577
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:42,425
Hello?

578
00:50:44,092 --> 00:50:47,424
This is the Vice Foreign Minister.
What's your name?

579
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:50,924
I am Hong Mi-sook. Please help me!

580
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:54,257
Yes, please stay calm.
I'll ask you a few questions.

581
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:56,299
How many are with you now?

582
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,091
There are seven of us here.

583
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:01,882
How many Taliban guards?

584
00:51:01,883 --> 00:51:03,424
Three?

585
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:05,466
How's everyone's health?

586
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:09,716
Not good, especially Hye-young,
she's not eating at all.

587
00:51:09,717 --> 00:51:13,049
Where do you think you are now?
Any recognizable terrain?

588
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:17,633
I don't know. They keep moving us at night.

589
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,132
Wait!

590
00:51:22,133 --> 00:51:25,758
Please just tell my family this.

591
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,257
I'm sorry, and I love them.
Just tell them that...

592
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:35,342
Ms. Hong! Don't worry,
you'll be able to tell them yourself.

593
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,920
So?

594
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,147
Now what?

595
00:52:02,004 --> 00:52:05,499
One hundred dollar bills. No consecutive
serial numbers. Put them in two bags.

596
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,958
Mix them up.

597
00:52:28,217 --> 00:52:30,258
Dae-sik, there's 100 here.

598
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,860
As soon as we get the money,
you get the prisoners.

599
00:52:39,008 --> 00:52:41,633
4 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

600
00:52:49,717 --> 00:52:51,467
Team A has arrived.

601
00:52:54,717 --> 00:52:57,216
GHAZNI CENTRAL PRISON

602
00:52:57,217 --> 00:52:59,091
Team B ready.

603
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:02,008
Everyone stay alert,
and let's finish this quickly.

604
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:12,573
Where is Abdullah?

605
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:53,854
Where's the money?

606
00:54:03,758 --> 00:54:04,800
Salaam!

607
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,647
Now, release the prisoners.

608
00:54:10,772 --> 00:54:12,467
Should we count the money first?

609
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:17,389
The prisoners first.

610
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:20,866
Very well.

611
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:28,725
It's me.

612
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:31,758
Release the prisoners.

613
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:45,883
Yes, Vice Minister. We counted 23 of them.

614
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:48,256
It's done.

615
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:04,675
This heat is killing me!

616
00:55:12,717 --> 00:55:13,882
What the...?

617
00:55:13,883 --> 00:55:16,008
What is it? What's wrong?

618
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:18,009
Vice Minister, look at this.

619
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:22,716
Director Jeong asked me to dig up
more info on Abdullah.

620
00:55:22,717 --> 00:55:25,091
This is from the British Foreign Ministry,

621
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:26,966
and it seems he's a fake.

622
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:29,258
Abdullah, real name Peter Merchant.

623
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,051
It says he died in Kuwait last year.

624
00:55:31,858 --> 00:55:33,907
Take the prisoners to this place.

625
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:35,631
The Korean hostages will be there.

626
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:38,482
May God be with you.

627
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:46,342
Just a moment.

628
00:55:50,049 --> 00:55:52,049
Director Jeong! Don't give him the money!

629
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:52,875
What?

630
00:55:52,876 --> 00:55:54,875
He's a fraud!

631
00:55:57,561 --> 00:55:58,741
Hands up.

632
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,599
Put it down.

633
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,216
Are you okay?

634
00:56:36,217 --> 00:56:37,560
I'm okay.

635
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,100
Put it down!

636
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,166
No, don't go!

637
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,298
Don't follow them!

638
00:56:59,299 --> 00:57:00,299
No!

639
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,967
Shit...

640
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,750
Sorry.

641
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,175
Take him out, quick!

642
00:59:53,175 --> 00:59:54,549
Hey!

643
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:58,674
Investigate whether
that NIS nut was in on this fraud!

644
00:59:58,675 --> 01:00:00,842
Find out how much he got paid!

645
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:07,174
You should've checked if the Taliban
got paid for allowing that call!

646
01:00:07,175 --> 01:00:09,967
You think you're here on vacation?

647
01:00:17,508 --> 01:00:20,174
You bastard. You won't get away with this!

648
01:00:20,175 --> 01:00:22,091
You're out to ruin us, aren't you?

649
01:00:22,092 --> 01:00:25,300
Please stop, sir. He's doing all he can.

650
01:00:43,758 --> 01:00:45,133
It's a Taliban general.

651
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:47,758
Hussein.

652
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:56,115
He wants to suggest something very
important to the Korean government now.

653
01:01:03,468 --> 01:01:07,635
"Transfer $100,000 to the foreign account
by this afternoon.

654
01:01:07,636 --> 01:01:09,882
"Then we'll release 30 Koreans."

655
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:12,341
He's saying he'll release 30 Koreans.

656
01:01:12,342 --> 01:01:13,925
30?

657
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:16,842
Not 23, but 30?

658
01:01:20,092 --> 01:01:24,591
Fake Taliban, petty crime inmates,
a fraud broker...

659
01:01:24,592 --> 01:01:26,467
Damn!

660
01:01:36,271 --> 01:01:37,693
Hello?

661
01:01:42,857 --> 01:01:45,986
This time, he says he's
the Taliban commander.

662
01:01:45,987 --> 01:01:48,166
He said the deadline has already passed.

663
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:51,299
First he's a general, now he's a commander?

664
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,174
Translate this word for word!

665
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:55,758
If he calls one more time,
he won't get away with it!

666
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,550
My name is Park Sung-jin.

667
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:07,216
Born August 1973.

668
01:02:07,217 --> 01:02:10,383
I live in Ojeong-dong, Bucheon.

669
01:02:12,925 --> 01:02:15,231
Mr. Park Sung-jin!

670
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:21,502
Tell him it's a misunderstanding.
We need more time!

671
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:22,708
Translate now!

672
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,132
Please meet these people's demands!

673
01:02:28,133 --> 01:02:29,800
Then we can live.

674
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:33,999
Please save me!

675
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,989
Whatever it takes, we will find a way
to release the prisoners!

676
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,247
Hurry!

677
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:49,499
We gave enough time,
but you kept wasting time.

678
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,124
Hurry and tell them!

679
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:55,166
I want to live! Please save me!

680
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:58,927
Mr. Park, say "Nanawatai".

681
01:03:00,758 --> 01:03:03,258
Protection! Fairness!
Mercy of the Pashtun people!

682
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:08,217
- Allah is the Greatest!
- No!

683
01:03:16,062 --> 01:03:19,291
Next time, bring me the right answer.

684
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:21,458
The next deadline is tomorrow at 4 o'clock.

685
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,459
Welcome, Minister. I'm
Secretary Cha Min-yong.

686
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:46,092
I'm ashamed to make
you come so far, Minister.

687
01:03:47,644 --> 01:03:51,374
The Taliban have warned the Korean government
that there will be further killings.

688
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:54,301
In response, the Foreign Affairs minister

689
01:03:54,302 --> 01:03:57,749
has made a visit to the
Afghan President Karzai.

690
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:02,332
Will the Korean government's new negotiation
strategy be able to satisfy the Taliban

691
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:05,792
without causing any friction to
the South Korean-Afghan relations,

692
01:04:05,793 --> 01:04:09,698
and effectively prevent the Taliban
from further killings?

693
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:49,912
Yes?

694
01:04:49,913 --> 01:04:51,392
Yes?

695
01:04:54,217 --> 01:04:55,920
What happened?

696
01:04:55,921 --> 01:04:57,925
They launched a military operation!

697
01:05:00,008 --> 01:05:02,806
What are you talking about?

698
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,592
The military have mobilised in Ghazni,

699
01:05:06,593 --> 01:05:11,507
and there are concerns that the joint
military exercise will provoke the Taliban...

700
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:15,258
So this is the plan the Minister brought?

701
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:24,716
Vice Minister.

702
01:05:24,717 --> 01:05:27,213
Is it true that we're launching
a military operation?

703
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,759
Just a normal operation.

704
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:33,174
This is a sensitive time,
it can provoke the Taliban!

705
01:05:33,175 --> 01:05:35,091
We need to stop this right now!

706
01:05:35,092 --> 01:05:38,799
How can we stop soldiers
from training on the battlefield?

707
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,007
It's not...

708
01:05:40,008 --> 01:05:42,092
We're preparing for the worst.

709
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:46,209
If they kill any more hostages,

710
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:48,207
there will be a rescue operation.

711
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:53,257
Minister, the U.S. military's attacks
in that area have failed for years!

712
01:05:53,258 --> 01:05:57,883
So should we just sit back
and watch the hostages die?

713
01:05:58,717 --> 01:06:00,716
We're not done negotiating yet.

714
01:06:00,717 --> 01:06:05,382
President Karzai gave a final refusal
to release the prisoners.

715
01:06:05,383 --> 01:06:06,632
What?

716
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:11,341
Director Jeong, start packing.

717
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:14,466
You've done enough. Your work is done here.

718
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:17,050
- Minster!
- I'll take care of it, so go home.

719
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,049
Then what will happen to the captives?

720
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:26,883
Minister! The U.S. Army
commander is on the line.

721
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:47,967
What did he say?

722
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:55,175
How did it go?

723
01:06:57,467 --> 01:06:59,591
I've been ordered home.

724
01:06:59,592 --> 01:07:00,592
What?

725
01:07:03,592 --> 01:07:07,050
So you're just going to walk away?

726
01:07:08,508 --> 01:07:09,967
And the captives?

727
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:13,757
You're going to let them die?

728
01:07:13,758 --> 01:07:16,779
Hey!

729
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:29,624
I feel bad seeing you leave
after all the trouble you went through.

730
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:32,799
I'll come visit you when I'm back in Seoul.

731
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,508
Thank you for your efforts.

732
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:39,050
Great work.

733
01:07:40,983 --> 01:07:42,811
Let's hear what they have to say.

734
01:07:44,065 --> 01:07:47,482
Hong Mi-sook is my wife
and a mother of two children.

735
01:07:48,758 --> 01:07:52,258
Please bring her back safely.

736
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:57,245
Please help my wife Hong Mi-sook

737
01:07:58,694 --> 01:08:01,405
to return home safely. Please!

738
01:08:03,383 --> 01:08:07,175
Honey, you must be so tired.

739
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:10,675
Hold on.

740
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:20,841
Hello? This is Jeong
Jae-ho from Afghanistan.

741
01:08:20,842 --> 01:08:22,716
I'd like to speak to
the Chief Presidential Secretary.

742
01:08:22,717 --> 01:08:26,799
He's in a meeting now, so if you tell me...

743
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,091
This is a very urgent matter,
so please connect me.

744
01:08:29,092 --> 01:08:31,466
He can't answer the phone right now.

745
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:34,466
If I don't talk to him
now, you'll regret it!

746
01:08:34,467 --> 01:08:38,586
Director of Foreign ministry? So what?

747
01:08:39,383 --> 01:08:41,341
Director Jeong, what is it?

748
01:08:41,342 --> 01:08:42,800
Mr. Secretary.

749
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:48,841
Let me negotiate
face-to-face with the Taliban.

750
01:08:48,842 --> 01:08:50,549
I'll try to persuade them myself.

751
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:52,925
Did they change their conditions?

752
01:08:54,175 --> 01:09:00,550
No, but face-to-face negotiations
are our last chance now.

753
01:09:04,258 --> 01:09:06,882
I know how you feel,

754
01:09:06,883 --> 01:09:10,467
but Minister Choi is there now,
so follow his orders.

755
01:09:21,092 --> 01:09:24,008
Director, you'll be late for your flight.

756
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:12,207
Hello! This is Jeong Jae-ho!

757
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,916
This is the President.

758
01:10:14,842 --> 01:10:18,092
You really think there's a chance?

759
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:24,675
Everyone says it's
impossible. Is it possible?

760
01:10:26,792 --> 01:10:29,424
It's a long shot.

761
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:33,549
But Mr. President, I can't give up.

762
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:36,957
I'm told we can't guarantee your safety.

763
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:39,966
Will you still go?

764
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:40,967
Yes.

765
01:10:41,925 --> 01:10:43,883
You can come back alive?

766
01:10:45,175 --> 01:10:47,133
I'll try my best.

767
01:10:55,967 --> 01:10:58,091
My fellow Koreans.

768
01:10:58,092 --> 01:11:02,549
1 HOUR BEFORE DEADLINE You must
be anxious at the news of a second victim

769
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:09,382
among our people kidnapped
by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

770
01:11:09,383 --> 01:11:15,216
I emphasize, we are willing
to use any means possible

771
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:19,924
to ensure the prompt
and safe return of our citizens.

772
01:11:19,925 --> 01:11:23,050
Director Jeong, do you
know what you've done?

773
01:11:24,258 --> 01:11:29,757
Our president just sent an open invitation
to negotiate with the terrorists!

774
01:11:29,758 --> 01:11:33,883
You know better than anyone
what a stain this is on our diplomacy!

775
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:40,632
As far as I know,
our first duty is to protect our citizens.

776
01:11:40,633 --> 01:11:44,467
If I am mistaken, please tell me.

777
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:48,799
We have a message from the Taliban.

778
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,757
The hostages are safe,

779
01:11:50,758 --> 01:11:53,175
and if we send a team,
they'll negotiate with us.

780
01:11:56,258 --> 01:12:00,966
The expected point of contact is near
Mijan, northeast of Kandahar Province.

781
01:12:00,967 --> 01:12:04,924
The U.S. military will provide protection
up to the meeting spot.

782
01:12:04,925 --> 01:12:06,757
It's said they want

783
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:10,841
$1M for a US prisoner,
and $1.5M for an Italian photographer.

784
01:12:10,842 --> 01:12:12,885
We've got a lot of people.

785
01:12:12,886 --> 01:12:14,964
This is highly confidential.

786
01:12:19,675 --> 01:12:20,925
KIDNAPPING LOCATION

787
01:12:21,842 --> 01:12:23,591
How many vehicles for that day?

788
01:12:23,592 --> 01:12:25,842
- Two cars, eight in total.
- Okay.

789
01:12:34,842 --> 01:12:36,632
Javeed Nurul Haq.

790
01:12:36,633 --> 01:12:39,675
Considered a top-level terrorist
even among the Taliban.

791
01:12:46,467 --> 01:12:50,092
It's a group that the
CIA are keen to capture.

792
01:12:52,008 --> 01:12:55,382
This is quite terrible.

793
01:12:55,383 --> 01:12:58,758
He's a notorious figure
even among the Taliban.

794
01:13:00,258 --> 01:13:02,008
Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim?

795
01:13:03,342 --> 01:13:05,592
- Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim?
- I'm here!

796
01:13:11,925 --> 01:13:14,466
Dae-sik!

797
01:13:14,467 --> 01:13:15,467
Move!

798
01:13:17,008 --> 01:13:19,174
Dae-sik, buddy!

799
01:13:19,175 --> 01:13:21,217
Can you please get me out of here?

800
01:13:23,592 --> 01:13:26,632
No wonder I couldn't reach you.

801
01:13:26,633 --> 01:13:28,716
You couldn't stay out of trouble?

802
01:13:28,717 --> 01:13:31,133
It was a misunderstanding.

803
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:33,591
Should I give you a chance to get out?

804
01:13:33,592 --> 01:13:37,674
Please. As a fellow Korean, please?

805
01:13:37,675 --> 01:13:40,800
- Then translate for me.
- Of course, whatever you...

806
01:13:42,175 --> 01:13:43,467
Where are we going?

807
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:46,342
- To the Taliban.
- The Taliban?

808
01:13:50,967 --> 01:13:53,424
Have a safe trip. I'll just stay here.

809
01:13:53,425 --> 01:13:54,999
It's to save people.

810
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,716
I should risk my life to save theirs?

811
01:13:58,717 --> 01:14:01,132
What nonsense. Bye!

812
01:14:01,133 --> 01:14:03,674
It's probably better than getting flogged.

813
01:14:03,675 --> 01:14:05,049
Flogged?

814
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:08,478
Gambling, drinking, swindling.

815
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:10,317
You did the full set.

816
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:15,632
Under Sharia law,
you'll get whipped dozens of times.

817
01:14:15,633 --> 01:14:17,092
Can you take that?

818
01:14:19,467 --> 01:14:21,967
It hurts. It already hurts.

819
01:14:23,467 --> 01:14:25,300
Let's talk outside.

820
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,050
10 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING

821
01:14:43,675 --> 01:14:45,508
Are you ready?

822
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:52,924
What?

823
01:14:52,925 --> 01:14:54,592
You being nice is awkward.

824
01:14:55,633 --> 01:14:57,717
Since I may never see you again.

825
01:15:00,758 --> 01:15:02,092
It's a joke.

826
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:06,382
You know how to joke?

827
01:15:06,383 --> 01:15:08,842
Why aren't you wearing this?

828
01:15:10,175 --> 01:15:13,932
They'll think I'm scared.
I won't give them the upper hand.

829
01:15:20,467 --> 01:15:24,612
Pride won't protect you from bullets.

830
01:15:30,217 --> 01:15:31,217
Thanks.

831
01:15:40,092 --> 01:15:42,300
No bathroom breaks during the negotiation.

832
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:48,487
I can't even drink water?

833
01:16:57,258 --> 01:16:58,675
They're coming.

834
01:17:09,592 --> 01:17:11,632
I heard you were a church deacon.

835
01:17:11,633 --> 01:17:13,924
Why does that matter when I'm facing death?

836
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:16,592
I'll pray to the local god.

837
01:17:32,467 --> 01:17:33,696
What is he saying?

838
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:36,550
Go on.

839
01:17:37,217 --> 01:17:38,757
Huh?

840
01:17:38,758 --> 01:17:39,758
Go.

841
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,550
Me?

842
01:17:43,133 --> 01:17:47,842
Why'd they have to come here
and cause so much trouble?

843
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:56,592
Will you be okay?

844
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,175
With what?

845
01:18:01,382 --> 01:18:03,999
Not calling your family.

846
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,208
Wow, you really must have wiretapped us.

847
01:18:13,883 --> 01:18:16,383
You know who I envy the most?

848
01:18:19,675 --> 01:18:22,133
Someone with a place to go back to.

849
01:18:29,508 --> 01:18:34,467
They said only the negotiator
and interpreter can come.

850
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:40,592
I don't think I need this.

851
01:18:43,092 --> 01:18:44,550
Let's go.

852
01:18:45,508 --> 01:18:46,508
Wait.

853
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,050
Pop this with your molars in one bite.

854
01:19:10,217 --> 01:19:11,217
Hey.

855
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:14,508
I'm good.

856
01:20:20,925 --> 01:20:22,799
Hey! Where are we going?

857
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,549
Shut up.

858
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:26,300
Where are we going?

859
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,050
Director, how far are we going?

860
01:21:09,967 --> 01:21:15,466
I am Jeong Jae-ho, the negotiator
representing the Korea government.

861
01:21:15,467 --> 01:21:18,842
I'm here to negotiate the hostage issue.

862
01:21:33,258 --> 01:21:34,883
He says it's nice to meet you.

863
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:46,425
He asks if you brought the answer.

864
01:21:50,967 --> 01:21:53,800
What are you doing?
These people are quick-tempered.

865
01:21:54,842 --> 01:21:59,050
First, ask them to show us
the condition of the Koreans.

866
01:22:05,592 --> 01:22:07,800
- Bring the monitor.
- Yes.

867
01:22:23,924 --> 01:22:27,257
He says now that you've checked,
let's start talking.

868
01:22:27,258 --> 01:22:30,675
- There's one more thing.
- What is it now?

869
01:22:36,883 --> 01:22:39,299
As I'm here on behalf
of the Korean government,

870
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,008
you should prove you are
the leader of this negotiation.

871
01:22:55,925 --> 01:22:57,967
This guy is a bit particular.

872
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,675
What can he do to make you believe him?

873
01:23:09,842 --> 01:23:12,299
Tell him to release
three of the hostages first.

874
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,300
- What?
- Translate, now!

875
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:16,758
Dammit, this...

876
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:27,883
He says you're tricking them!

877
01:23:30,092 --> 01:23:34,425
If you let them go now, Muslims all
over the world will be proud of you.

878
01:23:54,099 --> 01:23:56,459
He said he'll let two go.

879
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,058
That it's a gift from Allah.

880
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,401
Hold on. We have to check for explosives.

881
01:24:23,402 --> 01:24:24,707
What the hell are you saying?

882
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:25,749
Over here!

883
01:24:31,342 --> 01:24:33,883
Oh, god!

884
01:24:34,717 --> 01:24:37,508
Ms. Kim Hye-young? Ms. Kim?

885
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,037
Come here.

886
01:24:41,038 --> 01:24:42,345
Come here!

887
01:24:44,967 --> 01:24:45,967
Hello?

888
01:24:45,968 --> 01:24:47,383
How did it go?

889
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:51,174
Kim Hye-young and Lee
Jin-hee are safe with us.

890
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:52,376
Okay.

891
01:25:00,633 --> 01:25:02,508
He says it's our turn.

892
01:25:07,633 --> 01:25:09,017
What are you doing?

893
01:25:10,467 --> 01:25:12,425
Come on, say something!

894
01:25:18,342 --> 01:25:20,217
There will be no release of prisoners.

895
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,257
What?

896
01:25:25,258 --> 01:25:26,757
You said you brought the answer.

897
01:25:26,758 --> 01:25:28,758
This is our answer.

898
01:25:28,759 --> 01:25:31,718
If he wants to proceed,
tell him to change the conditions.

899
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:35,049
I can't. We'll die if I say that.

900
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:37,424
What did he say? Tell us now!

901
01:25:37,425 --> 01:25:39,485
Okay, I'll tell you.

902
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:49,806
This will only weaken
your bargaining power!

903
01:26:07,342 --> 01:26:09,800
He said he'll do the negotiation his way.

904
01:26:15,092 --> 01:26:17,657
He told them to kill that woman.

905
01:26:22,425 --> 01:26:24,392
Sir, won't you do something?

906
01:26:43,133 --> 01:26:44,133
Stop!

907
01:26:47,425 --> 01:26:48,425
Wait.

908
01:26:56,092 --> 01:26:59,633
I will ask our government.

909
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:22,966
They're changing their conditions.

910
01:27:22,967 --> 01:27:30,258
He said to free all Taliban prisoners
by midnight tonight.

911
01:27:32,217 --> 01:27:35,374
Let me confirm that.

912
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:39,757
All of the Taliban prisoners?

913
01:27:39,758 --> 01:27:40,982
That's correct.

914
01:27:41,717 --> 01:27:43,217
If we don't,

915
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:47,217
they'll kill a hostage

916
01:27:48,508 --> 01:27:49,925
every hour.

917
01:27:51,758 --> 01:27:53,133
300 prisoners?

918
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:58,508
They had no intention of negotiating
in the first place.

919
01:28:00,682 --> 01:28:02,404
Let's go to Bagram Air Base.

920
01:28:04,592 --> 01:28:06,132
Please wait a little longer!

921
01:28:06,133 --> 01:28:08,174
Who do you think you are?

922
01:28:08,175 --> 01:28:10,674
We sent Jeong Jae-ho as our negotiator!

923
01:28:10,675 --> 01:28:14,049
Shouldn't we give him
that slim chance and wait?

924
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:17,217
If we start bombing now,
the negotiator is in most danger.

925
01:28:31,425 --> 01:28:34,675
I think it's time, why aren't they calling?

926
01:28:39,467 --> 01:28:40,467
They won't.

927
01:28:41,758 --> 01:28:44,425
Why? Wait a minute...

928
01:28:50,248 --> 01:28:54,249
They said the Korean government broke off
the negotiation. What'll happen to us?

929
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,792
We never should have given them a chance!

930
01:28:57,758 --> 01:28:59,133
You tricked us.

931
01:29:02,383 --> 01:29:03,383
No!

932
01:29:11,042 --> 01:29:13,757
The Allies have launched
a military campaign.

933
01:29:13,758 --> 01:29:15,467
What?

934
01:29:29,675 --> 01:29:30,882
He said to stop lying.

935
01:29:30,883 --> 01:29:34,550
They've got 21 hostages, so the Allies
can't carry out a rescue operation.

936
01:29:37,217 --> 01:29:40,091
Why did he say 21?
Two got released, it should be 19...

937
01:29:40,092 --> 01:29:42,717
This isn't a rescue operation,
this is a mop-up operation!

938
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:54,500
The U.S. and Afghan forces just
needed an excuse to level this place.

939
01:29:57,133 --> 01:29:58,424
When the operation starts,

940
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:03,758
the hostages, you and your men,
and us too will all die!

941
01:30:05,675 --> 01:30:10,383
Are a few of your men more important
than saving many lives?

942
01:30:13,917 --> 01:30:19,948
You yourself provided the excuse
for this bombing. Know that!

943
01:30:32,731 --> 01:30:34,489
I know what you are thinking.

944
01:30:35,667 --> 01:30:38,953
You come here to save those people.

945
01:30:38,954 --> 01:30:41,676
You don't just let them be killed.

946
01:30:42,957 --> 01:30:45,609
Tell your government to stop the attack.

947
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,896
We don't have the power.

948
01:30:50,897 --> 01:30:52,582
Koreans aren't our guests.

949
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:54,759
You sent the troops here!

950
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:57,275
You are an extremely rich country.

951
01:30:57,276 --> 01:30:59,069
You can do whatever you want.

952
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:04,832
You may be a good commander,

953
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:08,417
but you are nothing as a negotiator.

954
01:31:09,413 --> 01:31:11,366
You know your biggest mistake?

955
01:31:12,882 --> 01:31:14,733
You overestimated us.

956
01:31:32,342 --> 01:31:34,424
Allah is the only god.

957
01:31:34,425 --> 01:31:37,675
Muhammad... Muhammad is the only prophet.

958
01:31:57,837 --> 01:32:00,793
It's the price of breaking down this deal.

959
01:32:00,794 --> 01:32:03,134
I will send you the hell first!

960
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:10,749
The only way to stop the bombing
is to tell them we have a deal.

961
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:13,066
We are not afraid of American missiles!

962
01:32:13,067 --> 01:32:14,416
Time is on our side.

963
01:32:14,417 --> 01:32:15,777
So is Allah.

964
01:32:15,778 --> 01:32:18,531
Eventually, we are going to win this war.

965
01:32:18,532 --> 01:32:20,714
Why take things so far?

966
01:32:20,715 --> 01:32:22,332
You know better than anyone,

967
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:24,633
the prisoner exchange is impossible!

968
01:32:25,282 --> 01:32:26,759
Why do you think?

969
01:32:30,196 --> 01:32:31,259
Money.

970
01:32:32,342 --> 01:32:34,688
Money? You have insulted us!

971
01:32:38,175 --> 01:32:39,175
Take him out!

972
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:43,368
Take him too!

973
01:32:44,883 --> 01:32:49,383
He told them to take me too!
Director, what do I do?

974
01:32:56,092 --> 01:32:57,800
These American bastards!

975
01:32:58,592 --> 01:32:59,925
Allah is the Greatest!

976
01:33:26,221 --> 01:33:27,659
50 million.

977
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:35,846
40.

978
01:33:37,971 --> 01:33:39,033
20.

979
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:05,438
Remember, Afghanistan
is the graveyard of empires.

980
01:34:09,854 --> 01:34:11,950
Send all the troops home.

981
01:34:11,951 --> 01:34:15,353
Make all Koreans leave Afghanistan
in a month, for good.

982
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:17,846
Okay?

983
01:34:21,567 --> 01:34:22,693
Okay.

984
01:34:22,694 --> 01:34:25,041
Never set your foot again in this country,

985
01:34:25,042 --> 01:34:26,122
Korean.

986
01:34:56,717 --> 01:34:58,091
Hello?

987
01:34:58,092 --> 01:34:59,944
The negotiation is done.

988
01:34:59,945 --> 01:35:02,132
They'll release all the hostages.

989
01:35:02,133 --> 01:35:04,008
Call the Americans.

990
01:35:04,758 --> 01:35:06,175
Good work!

991
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:11,208
Director Jeong?

992
01:35:13,265 --> 01:35:15,932
Nice work everyone. We've reached a deal!

993
01:35:33,425 --> 01:35:36,592
You can go back to Korea now.

994
01:35:41,092 --> 01:35:42,092
Thank you.

995
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:17,000
I take back my comment
on you being a dweeb.

996
01:36:21,633 --> 01:36:22,791
Great work.

997
01:36:22,792 --> 01:36:25,049
No, thank you.

998
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:29,300
I really wouldn't have been able
to do it without you.

999
01:36:34,633 --> 01:36:35,768
What's this?

1000
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:41,882
They said one has to stay behind.

1001
01:36:41,883 --> 01:36:44,799
What are they talking about?

1002
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,466
They guaranteed our safety up to here,

1003
01:36:48,467 --> 01:36:50,541
so they want to ensure their safety too.

1004
01:36:50,542 --> 01:36:52,572
We're done negotiating, what is this?

1005
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:59,125
He said if we don't do it,
no one can leave here.

1006
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:15,291
I'm the representative of
this negotiation, so I'll stay.

1007
01:37:22,541 --> 01:37:30,333
Then as the person in charge,
lead them safely back to Korea.

1008
01:37:32,792 --> 01:37:34,333
It's my turn now.

1009
01:37:39,417 --> 01:37:43,292
Don't worry. My luck is good.

1010
01:37:48,833 --> 01:37:50,036
I will stay.

1011
01:37:51,833 --> 01:37:53,208
Let him go.

1012
01:37:58,917 --> 01:38:00,083
Get it together!

1013
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:03,041
Be sure to see the director off.

1014
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:07,000
You did well, Lee Bong-han. Go.

1015
01:38:11,342 --> 01:38:13,467
Take care of yourself, brother.

1016
01:39:13,632 --> 01:39:17,924
"If I break this agreement and
disclose anything about my work here,

1017
01:39:17,925 --> 01:39:20,633
I agree to be punished
according to the law..."

1018
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,484
Pretty straightforward, right?

1019
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:35,667
Thank you.

1020
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:46,133
We work ourselves to death,
and are left with nothing.

1021
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:51,726
21 people came back alive.

1022
01:39:51,727 --> 01:39:52,846
That's true.

1023
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:04,257
The 21 former hostages abducted
in Afghanistan on September 19

1024
01:40:04,258 --> 01:40:06,799
have just landed at Incheon Int'I Airport.

1025
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,591
The safety of one anonymous team member

1026
01:40:09,592 --> 01:40:14,924
who remained with the Taliban
after the deal has also been confirmed.

1027
01:40:14,925 --> 01:40:21,258
This marks an end to the largest
hostage crisis in Korea's history.

1028
01:40:26,133 --> 01:40:28,592
3 MONTHS LATER

1029
01:40:29,717 --> 01:40:32,925
The Minister's at the press conference,
but we still haven't figured it out?

1030
01:40:32,926 --> 01:40:35,801
What do you even do? Find out now!

1031
01:40:39,175 --> 01:40:40,507
Hello, who is this?

1032
01:40:40,508 --> 01:40:43,710
You didn't go to Washington?

1033
01:40:43,711 --> 01:40:45,260
Or maybe you couldn't?

1034
01:40:46,508 --> 01:40:47,967
Park Dae-sik?

1035
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,174
You son of a...

1036
01:40:51,175 --> 01:40:53,757
So quick to swear at me!

1037
01:40:53,758 --> 01:40:55,257
Where are you now?

1038
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:57,507
Why didn't you call?

1039
01:40:57,508 --> 01:41:00,424
You know how worried
I was? You weren't hurt?

1040
01:41:00,425 --> 01:41:03,092
I told you. My luck is good.

1041
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:07,049
Is that Director Jeong? Me, me!

1042
01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:10,794
Hold on, someone wants to say hi.

1043
01:41:10,795 --> 01:41:12,091
Huh?

1044
01:41:12,092 --> 01:41:13,750
Director Jeong...

1045
01:41:13,751 --> 01:41:15,632
Salaam! Have you been well?

1046
01:41:15,633 --> 01:41:18,174
Oh, Qasim! Lee Bong-han!

1047
01:41:18,175 --> 01:41:21,957
There must really be no one there.
Working with Qasim again?

1048
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:25,708
Last time in Afghanistan,
I don't think I got fully paid...

1049
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:27,800
You little...

1050
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,875
Director Jeong, come quickly.

1051
01:41:32,175 --> 01:41:36,216
Anyway, take care of yourselves.
Let's get in touch soon.

1052
01:41:36,217 --> 01:41:37,882
Take care and...

1053
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:41,967
I won't say see you later.
Don't want to get into another mess.

1054
01:41:47,508 --> 01:41:48,675
Park Dae-sik.

1055
01:41:50,375 --> 01:41:53,591
Everyone has a place to go back to.

1056
01:41:53,592 --> 01:41:54,633
You know, right?

1057
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:01,299
Peace be upon you.

1058
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:03,050
Peace be upon you.

1059
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:14,882
Did he say he'll pay? No?

1060
01:42:14,883 --> 01:42:17,008
Always talking about money...

1061
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:19,882
Let's go!

1062
01:42:19,883 --> 01:42:23,966
At 8:43 a.m. today, our
government confirmed

1063
01:42:23,967 --> 01:42:28,591
that Marine Star 1
from Dongin Shipping Co. Of Busan

1064
01:42:28,592 --> 01:42:32,716
was kidnapped in waters
off the Indian Ocean,

1065
01:42:32,717 --> 01:42:37,882
300 km from the port of Kismayo, Somalia.

1066
01:42:37,883 --> 01:42:43,507
The hijacked ship
carrying a total of 25 people

1067
01:42:43,508 --> 01:42:45,757
is believed to have been hijacked

1068
01:42:45,758 --> 01:42:48,925
by Somali pirates armed
with portable rockets.

1069
01:42:49,842 --> 01:42:54,341
We are holding an emergency
diplomatic and security meeting

1070
01:42:54,342 --> 01:42:56,424
to discuss countermeasures,

1071
01:42:56,425 --> 01:43:00,675
and a response team
will be sent as soon as possible.

1072
01:43:03,883 --> 01:43:06,217
HWANG JUNG-MIN

1073
