<i>This film is inspired by actual events,</i>

6
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:54,641
<i>but all characters and situations
have been fictionalized.</i>

7
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:05,641
<i>On Sept. 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda led by
Osama bin Laden attacked the US.</i>

8
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:14,191
<i>The US declared war on Afghanistan
for giving refuge to bin Laden.</i>

9
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:18,690
<i>38 countries joined the war,</i>

10
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:23,521
<i>with South Korea sending
hundreds of non-combat troops.</i>

11
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:28,640
<i>After losing power to
a pro-US government,</i>

12
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:32,811
<i>the Taliban turned to suicide
bombing and kidnapping foreigners.</i>

SEPTEMBER 19, 2006

15
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,440
Let us pray.

16
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:29,020
Lord, please bestow Your
grace on this barren land.

17
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:29,691
Amen!

18
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:33,440
And please let the seeds
we plant today take root.

19
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:37,350
Help the people of this
land to understand that

20
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,310
- Jehovah is their...
- Lord.

21
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,020
- one god.
- Amen!

22
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:46,020
We believe the Lord Jesus
will be the King of all peace!

23
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,021
Amen!

24
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:51,191
Everyone okay?

25
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:54,851
What's going on?

26
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,770
Open the door!

27
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm just a bus driver.

28
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:01,821
Please don't hurt me!

29
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:03,981
Open up, now!

30
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:23,501
Quiet!

00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:38,501

SOUTH KOREA, FOREIGN MINISTRY

00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,281
Deputy Kim!

34
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:53,630
Yes?

35
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,870
What happened?

36
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:57,780
They were supposed to arrive at
Kandahar yesterday, but they didn't.

37
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:02,080
That's not what I mean! There's
a travel ban on that country!

38
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:06,790
They entered Dubai through
Beijing, so we never expected...

39
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,961
Just kill me already.

40
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:14,281
What is this?

41
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,501
They're all from the same church.

42
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:19,920
What's their purpose for going there?

43
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:23,420
We believe it's short-term
missionary work.

44
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:25,341
- What?
- Look!

45
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:40,381
<i>We demand the Korean government to pull
its troops out of Afghanistan immediately</i>

46
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:48,090
<i>and promptly release 23 Taliban
warriors locked in Kabul Prison.</i>

47
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:52,420
Tell the Press Office that all media
should describe them as volunteers.

48
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,211
What?

49
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:54,960
Run, or they're all dead!

50
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:55,841
Yes, sir!

51
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:56,920
- Bae!
- Yes?

52
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,420
- Call a meeting quickly.
- Yes, sir.

53
00:05:58,421 --> 00:05:59,630
- Check with foreign press.
- Yes.

54
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:03,590
<i>If our request is not met by
then, we'll kill the hostages.</i>

55
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,131
<i>We give you 24 hours.</i>

56
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:15,261
KARACHI PRISON, PAKISTAN

57
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:22,841
Come out!

58
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,051
What is going on?

59
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,881
Sign here.

60
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:46,631
<i>Park Dae-sik</i>

61
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,551
A hard stay, right?

62
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:10,260
Three months. No, was it four?

63
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:13,550
Can't even remember.

64
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:16,421
Counterfeiting dollars
was a bit extreme.

65
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:19,801
Was it my decision?

66
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,261
You said you'd pull me out quickly.

67
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:26,420
Is this how the nation treats
one who risks his life?

68
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:29,710
You know counterfeiting
is a sensitive issue here.

69
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:30,711
Okay!

70
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,131
Go to Kabul.

71
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:44,961
Let's not see each other again.

72
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,920
What's with your attitude?

73
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:55,091
- People were kidnapped!
- You take care of it.

74
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:57,711
It's 23 people!

75
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:14,630
Hurry!

76
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:15,631
Hurry up!

77
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:34,960
<i>We will soon be landing at
Kabul International Airport.</i>

78
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:39,340
<i>The time in Kabul is 8:24 a.m.,
with a temperature of 31 degrees.</i>

79
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:41,670
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts and return
your tray tables to the upright position.</i>

80
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:42,671
Vice Minister.

81
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:45,420
- Vice Minister!
- Huh?

82
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:47,340
We're landing. Please
put on your seatbelt.

83
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:48,341
Okay.

84
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:05,261
KABUL, CAPITAL OF AFGHANISTAN

85
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:09,631
5 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

86
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,511
Welcome.

87
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:45,630
How is it with the Afghan government?

88
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:49,261
The ambassador is doing all
he can, but they won't budge.

89
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,261
Please come with me.

90
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:26,461
What is it?

91
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,141
He's an intelligence agent.

92
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,140
Are you the negotiator?

93
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:39,931
What's your strategy?

94
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:51,720
They like to show they mean business,

95
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:54,431
so send some positive signal
before they kill someone.

96
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:57,681
Understand?

97
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:07,890
Isn't that the freak who was
screwing around in Pakistan?

98
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:09,180
Yes, sir.

99
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:12,390
Didn't he get kicked
out? Why is he here?

100
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,390
I heard he helped deal with the
Korean hostage incident in Iraq.

101
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:18,140
But that hostage died.

102
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:22,640
Intelligence officers are
so scarce in this region...

103
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,061
They must really be
desperate for agents.

104
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:46,681
AFGHAN FOREIGN MINISTRY

105
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:53,260
Two days ago, two German deporters
were kidnapped in the exact same area.

106
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:58,920
I don't understand why the Koreans did
not ask our government for protection.

107
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:02,130
Especially when they are
moving in such a large group.

108
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:06,511
Tell him to stop lecturing
and release those prisoners.

109
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:13,270
The most important thing right
now is to bring them back, right?

110
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:17,760
Please release some Taliban prisoners
in exchange for the Koreans,

111
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:20,781
like you did last time
for the Italian deporter.

112
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:24,470
The Italian deporter again.

113
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:27,630
That was a very exceptional case.

114
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:30,280
And it was one person at that time.

115
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:33,301
This time, there are
many. Way too many.

116
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:42,420
You are aware that the kidnappers
asked us to withdraw the troops.

117
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:44,260
Yes, I know.

118
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:49,130
But the Korean troops were scheduled to
go back at the end of the year anyway.

119
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,650
They gave you a very easy task.

120
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:53,611
We could postpone it.

121
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:02,850
We could even consider
sending more troops

122
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:07,571
to expand the medical facilities
and roads in Afghanistan.

123
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:17,350
The Afghan Foreign Minister has
decided to hold a press conference.

124
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:18,601
Here's Director Jeong.

125
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:24,060
How long do you think it'll
take to exchange prisoners?

126
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:28,180
It doesn't seem it will take too long.

127
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:31,060
But America's stance is most important,

128
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,720
<i>so I think you should
contact Washington.</i>

129
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:34,930
Got it.

130
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:36,260
<i>Good work.</i>

131
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:37,601
Yes, thank you!

132
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:46,221
ROK EMBASSY ABDUCTION RESPONSE HQ

133
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,511
Tell me the terms of the agreement.

134
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:06,891
Did you not hear me?

135
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:14,710
Look, don't you have
any sense of procedure?

136
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:18,810
Instead of just bursting in,
go through official channels.

137
00:14:18,811 --> 00:14:20,850
I've got no use for that.

138
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:23,471
Will they really release
Taliban prisoners?

139
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:31,101
The Afghans will never do a
deal over the troop withdrawal.

140
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:36,180
How do you know about that?

141
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:39,510
That's a diplomatic secret
sent over the hotline!

142
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,400
Are you wiretapping us?

143
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:43,711
I won't let this slide!

144
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,101
What do you know about this country?

145
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,891
People here grind their teeth
at the mention of the Taliban.

146
00:14:55,551 --> 00:15:00,970
The president almost got sacked when
he tried to release a few prisoners.

147
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:04,511
You think he'll let 23 go free?

148
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,471
Sir, it's starting.

149
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,431
Hussein! Hussein!

150
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:33,210
"We are working closely with
the South Korean government

151
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:34,880
to solve this hostage crisis."

152
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:38,171
<i>Will you accept the Taliban's
demand to release the prisoners?</i>

153
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:47,581
"Under no circumstances will we
release the Taliban prisoners."

154
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:55,910
"The Afghan government is
considering all other options

155
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:58,680
to ensure that none of the
Korean hostages are hurt."

156
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,180
What are those bastards saying?

157
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:02,261
Jeong, what's going on?

158
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,471
It's from Seoul.

159
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,461
Yes, Chief.

160
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:13,211
<i>Didn't you say you
reached an agreement?</i>

161
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,941
It seems there was a misunderstanding.

162
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:21,230
Yes, we'll get it cleared up soon.

163
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,541
<i>We've got one hour left!</i>

164
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,401
I know, but...

165
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,940
The Afghan officials aren't picking up?

166
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:40,071
What? Not yet...

167
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:42,901
What's with this traffic?

168
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:47,070
I'm losing my mind...

169
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,520
Is there any shortcut?

170
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,230
Should we try going through the alleys?

171
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:51,271
Sure.

172
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:04,981
Shit...

173
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,271
Even more packed here.

174
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:32,020
Hey, how much time is left?

175
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:33,610
40 minutes.

176
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:34,691
Jeez.

177
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:39,941
Let's take the opposite lane.

178
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:51,980
Are you blind?

179
00:17:51,981 --> 00:17:53,770
Sorry, sorry!

180
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:56,561
Slowly. Okay, let's go.

181
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:01,981
- Are you crazy?
- Are you blind?

182
00:18:03,111 --> 00:18:05,230
What is it now?

183
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:06,480
How far is it?

184
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,360
It's at the second
intersection, on the corner.

185
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:09,690
Vice Minister!

186
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:12,070
There's no time, I
think we should walk.

187
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:14,571
But arriving on foot...

188
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:18,151
Hurry, it's fine!

189
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:20,071
Seriously?

190
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:46,141
Allah is the Greatest!

191
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:47,861
Is he still not picking up?

192
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:53,441
Sir! Are you okay?

193
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:57,321
Vice Minister, are you hurt?

194
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,480
Hello?

195
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:05,111
Director Jeong?

196
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:07,270
We have 30 minutes left.

197
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:08,901
What do you think will happen?

198
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,860
I think they'll be killed.

199
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:13,071
How do we stop them?

200
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:16,910
Announce that we'll withdraw troops,

201
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,970
and contact the OIC quickly.
<i>Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)</i>

202
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:23,011
<i>Changing our stance means
admitting we made a mistake.</i>

203
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,941
If you look at the situation here,

204
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:33,821
there is no other way.

205
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,190
Minister! You announced a withdrawal?

206
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:43,521
Are we giving in to terrorists
after negotiations failed?

207
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:51,320
What's the backdrop
to this hasty decision?

208
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:52,321
Minister!

209
00:20:57,231 --> 00:21:00,190
Director! The Taliban
extended the deadline!

210
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:01,651
What?

211
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:03,501
- By how much?
- 24 hours.

212
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:08,600
Take good care of the Vice Minister.

213
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,850
What?

214
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,601
- Director!
- Where are you going?

215
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:46,000
Don't you think you
should see a doctor first?

216
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:50,161
I thought we had an agreement.
Why did you back down?

217
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:52,701
Don't be upset.

218
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,720
We think it is very regretful

219
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:59,370
that the Korean government had
to give in to the Taliban's demand.

220
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:04,061
We feel the same that the Afghan
government broke our agreement!

221
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:09,180
All you care about is getting
the hostages released.

222
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:12,300
But we have to keep
fighting the Taliban,

223
00:22:12,301 --> 00:22:14,171
even after you leave.

224
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:17,380
Please understand that for us,

225
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:20,091
this is a very complicated decision.

226
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:23,800
Listen to me.

227
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,330
What does it take to
release the prisoners?

228
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:28,361
Aid?

229
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:30,981
Or American consent?

230
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:35,131
Answer me. Next time,
there may be no extensions.

231
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:38,380
Don't get desperate.

232
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:41,141
This is exactly what the Taliban want.

233
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:45,230
You sound like you
don't care if they die.

234
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,601
They are innocent
people. Just civilians!

235
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:53,691
You really believe they are innocent?

236
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,431
Excuse me?

237
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,631
Hello.

238
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:04,891
Okay.

239
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:10,250
I have a very urgent
matter I have to attend to.

240
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:12,760
- If you don't mind.
- No, no!

241
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,100
We are not done.

242
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,401
A German hostage has been murdered.

243
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:21,320
Next will be a Korean.

244
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:22,771
Mr. Jeong.

245
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:27,931
Do you believe what the Taliban
really want is the prisoners' release?

246
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,951
Are you saying there's something else?

247
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,521
I think we already told you.

248
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,540
Salaam.

249
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,971
Do you know this guy?

250
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:47,271
You seen him?

251
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,530
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

252
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,001
Do you know this guy?

253
00:23:56,721 --> 00:23:59,131
Ask at the second floor
restaurant across the street.

254
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:27,601
Hurry up!

255
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,401
Are you Qasim?

256
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,121
What is he saying?

257
00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:47,380
Qasim is busy now.

258
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:49,631
Qasim doesn't know Korean.

259
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:55,681
Hey!

260
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,431
Lee Bong-han!

261
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:02,770
You know me?

262
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:03,931
Come outside.

263
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:08,430
If you're tired, move to a hotel.

264
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:11,851
No, I have to hold down the fort.

265
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:16,021
Are you okay?

266
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:21,021
The Afghans said we could
pay a ransom for the prisoners?

267
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:22,740
Why didn't you tell me?

268
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:25,190
Bargain with terrorists?

269
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,200
Are you out of your mind?

270
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:30,770
What did the Germans get
for sticking to their principles?

271
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:33,280
Their hostage was murdered!

272
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,721
I'll report to the Minister.

273
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:42,070
The world will see us as
pushovers if word gets out!

274
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:46,570
Our aim is to prevent killings,
not protect our reputation!

275
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,571
Everyone here knows that!

276
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:52,240
Sit still for now.

277
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:54,450
The intelligence service said
they'll solve it in two days.

278
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:55,760
Two days?

279
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:57,900
We only have a day.

280
00:25:57,901 --> 00:25:59,280
What can the NIS do?

281
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:00,781
The Jirga!

282
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:03,151
The Jirga.

283
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:08,860
The Jirga is a council of
Afghan tribal leaders.

284
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:14,450
In a practical sense, all issues in
Afghanistan are decided by them.

285
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:16,950
If they issue a decision,

286
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:20,360
the hostages can be released
without an exchange of prisoners.

287
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:26,861
Currently, our elite agent and a local
coordinator are making contact.

288
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:33,360
What's wrong?

289
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:34,991
What? Let's go.

290
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,310
He says the mule must rest.

291
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,360
Or you can pay another
10 thousand afghanis.

292
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:49,071
What a crook.

293
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:53,861
We're not even halfway there.

294
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,150
This is the only road?

295
00:26:58,151 --> 00:26:59,321
Sure.

296
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,451
I'm serious.

297
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:14,361
Okay, 20 thousand.

298
00:27:15,411 --> 00:27:17,770
And another 20 if we
get there before dark.

299
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,581
Okay? Go.

300
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:24,741
Dae-sik, you should pay him through me.

301
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:28,571
Wait up!

302
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:36,610
PASHTUN TRIBAL VILLAGE

303
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:39,861
19 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

304
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:43,110
Greetings.

305
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:45,280
This man says he knows Ismael.

306
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:47,031
They are Koreans.

307
00:27:58,241 --> 00:27:59,491
Smile.

308
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:06,070
You know Ismael?

309
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:08,070
Do I know him?

310
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:11,360
I saved him by taking him
to the Korean medical unit

311
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:17,020
to get surgery after a bomb exploded.

312
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:19,711
You did?

313
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:28,821
Any friend of my nephew is my friend.

314
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:33,240
But what brings you all the way here?

315
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,940
He's asking why we're here.

316
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:38,151
It's because of the Korean hostages.

317
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:42,351
It's because of the Korean hostages.

318
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:51,441
These people came all
this way for volunteer work.

319
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:08,721
And he brought this
gift as a peace offering.

320
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:10,641
It's the latest phone.

321
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:15,900
Rotate to open.

322
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,741
Rotate to close.

323
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:27,101
See, they love anything made in Korea.

324
00:29:38,981 --> 00:29:41,020
How do you know about this?

325
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:42,811
You think I'm here to play?

326
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:48,230
You said there's no road.

327
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:51,600
There isn't... it's all minefields.

328
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:52,741
Damn you!

329
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:59,630
I'm Jeong Jae-ho, representing
Korean government.

330
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,480
Nice to meet you.

331
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:04,560
This is Jeong Jae-ho.

332
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:07,151
He's a representative of
the Korean government.

333
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,691
Welcome.

334
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:14,811
Come in.

335
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:19,310
Hello, I'm Afghanistan's only
Pashtun-Korean interpreter,

336
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:21,480
Abdul Kareem Qasim...

337
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:24,981
Qasim for short, just call me Qasim!

338
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:29,690
You're a Korean? That's amazing.

339
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,601
- I'll need your help, then.
- Yes.

340
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:34,231
What are you doing here?

341
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:37,170
What? I am cooperating.

342
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,881
Don't you dare butt in here.

343
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:43,251
Step aside. I'll handle this my way.

344
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:50,341
This place has its own rules.

345
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:54,631
We don't have time for this.
23 lives depend on us.

346
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:08,171
Sir, please calculate
my fee separately.

347
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:19,461
A professional negotiator like
you is really in another class!

348
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:25,630
A hospital in the chief's
name, building a school...

349
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:28,001
That's not class, it's cash.

350
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:32,711
So a new mobile phone is more classy?

351
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:37,840
You both work for the
country, no need to bicker.

352
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:41,170
Doesn't matter what path you
take to get to the same place.

353
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:43,881
And the phone did the trick. Nice job.

354
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:56,961
Is he really a key
figure within the Jirga?

355
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:01,751
For sure.

356
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:05,250
He's royal family.

357
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:06,840
Royal family?

358
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,091
Family lines are important in Islam.

359
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:13,550
There are some families
even the Taliban can't touch.

360
00:32:13,551 --> 00:32:16,801
So we need to win
over that tribal chief.

361
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:32,420
Korean! Join us.

362
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:34,960
I think they're testing us.

363
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:35,961
Wait.

364
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:39,300
Don't underestimate their pride.

365
00:32:39,301 --> 00:32:41,461
If you refuse, they'll think
you don't respect them.

366
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:02,751
Have a smoke!

367
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:11,460
That isn't tobacco, it's a
strong strain of hashish.

368
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:13,710
One more time!

369
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:15,380
He says to smoke more, but don't do it.

370
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:16,521
I'm fine!

371
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:21,501
Great!

372
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:47,531
Someone's coming...

373
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:08,110
He said he'll help us.

374
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:11,781
He said the hostages will be
safe as we discuss the matter.

375
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:21,660
They're helping us because
they want to show

376
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:24,741
that Islam respects honor
and is welcoming to guests.

377
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:34,071
JIRGA ASSEMBLY

378
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:04,991
They decided to let them go.

379
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:08,611
Really? For real?

380
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:10,910
Wow!

381
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:13,950
Great work, really!

382
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:15,321
Thank you!

383
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,491
I'll buy you a drink back in Korea!

384
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:24,381
I'm not going back to Korea.

385
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:28,571
I like this area.

386
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:34,151
I like feeling I'm the only
one between sky and earth.

387
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:45,241
Hey! Listen up!

388
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:50,321
They agreed to release the hostages!

389
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,700
What kind of reaction is that?

390
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:02,030
Anyway, my great translating

391
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:04,990
and pretending to know
Ismael played a big part.

392
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:06,581
You're not friends with Ismael?

393
00:36:07,821 --> 00:36:09,781
One in three guys here is named Ismael.

394
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:16,150
That tickles.

395
00:36:16,151 --> 00:36:19,691
Have you no fear,
pulling a prank like that?

396
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:25,201
Jeez...

397
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:30,991
Now, let's settle the payment.

398
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,570
FOREIGN MINISTRY

399
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:34,780
Director.

400
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:36,240
What?

401
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:40,070
There's no plane that
can take all 23 of them.

402
00:36:40,071 --> 00:36:41,611
Should I book a private plane?

403
00:36:43,491 --> 00:36:46,700
Who are they, Olympic gold medalists?

404
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:48,490
Find some connecting flights!

405
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:49,491
Yes, sir.

406
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,451
What is it?

407
00:36:56,491 --> 00:37:01,110
<i>So why do missionaries keep
taking these reckless trips?</i>

408
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:03,410
<i>If one dies on a mission...</i>

409
00:37:03,411 --> 00:37:05,860
Don't just stand there.
Call the TV station!

410
00:37:05,861 --> 00:37:06,941
Yes, sir!

411
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:12,530
<i>In fact, they all wrote their wills
before flying to Afghanistan.</i>

412
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,910
Yes?

413
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:15,150
<i>This is the Foreign Ministry.</i>

414
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,410
Sorry?

415
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:18,990
What you're broadcasting
now is very dangerous.

416
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:20,701
It could provoke the Taliban!

417
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:26,780
How can I control their opinions?
They aren't reading off a script.

418
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:30,030
If something happens to the hostages,
will you take responsibility?

419
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,740
Stop the broadcast now!

420
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:35,660
How can I cut off a live broadcast?

421
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:39,820
The Taliban don't understand
Korean, what's the problem?

422
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:41,230
<i>Sorry, I've got to go.</i>

423
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:43,061
We're broadcasting.

424
00:37:47,951 --> 00:37:49,450
No, go away.

425
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:51,950
I'm sorry, but everything is settled.

426
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:53,950
Swindler!

427
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,241
Dae-sik, let's go!

428
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,110
What is he saying?

429
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:10,450
He's asking why we lied to them?

430
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:11,581
What?

431
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:20,110
He asked why we told them
they were volunteers...

432
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:21,730
Why are they on TV?

433
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:22,821
Shit...

434
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:27,020
Listen to me. They're not missionaries.

435
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:29,971
You've got to insist
they're volunteers, okay?

436
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:32,661
This is unforgivable!

437
00:38:33,401 --> 00:38:34,950
Volunteers! Volunteers!

438
00:38:34,951 --> 00:38:36,570
They're not volunteers.

439
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:37,571
Chief!

440
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:39,461
We're not lying!

441
00:38:47,571 --> 00:38:51,320
The hostages are currently
held in three groups,

442
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:56,491
with the first eight scheduled
for release tomorrow morning.

443
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:11,031
The press conference will
resume after a 10-minute break.

444
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:16,160
What do you mean we
have to pay the ransom?

445
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:17,820
<i>The negotiation failed!</i>

446
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:21,240
Every broadcast here
is quoting Korean news,

447
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:23,911
reporting that the hostages
are missionaries.

448
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:25,950
Is this true?

449
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:30,111
Al Jazeera is broadcasting the
Korean feed with subtitles.

450
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:35,990
The Afghans will mediate
the ransom payment.

451
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:38,110
<i>Is there no other way?</i>

452
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:42,570
It's the most realistic,
preferable option now.

453
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:45,310
Director Jeong, don't be so inflexible.

454
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:49,241
<i>Why don't you try negotiating
through the Jirga one more time?</i>

455
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:51,781
It's over with the Jirga, Chief!

456
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:55,980
Minister, you need to decide quickly.

457
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:58,111
<i>We'll discuss it, so just wait.</i>

458
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,321
Is that so?

459
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:03,141
Okay, thanks.

460
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:08,610
What is it?

461
00:40:08,611 --> 00:40:10,941
An Asian body has
been found in Musheky.

462
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:13,820
No, that can't be!

463
00:40:13,821 --> 00:40:16,570
Wait, what is it now?

464
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:18,480
I have to go home!

465
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:19,771
Let's go check.

466
00:40:21,231 --> 00:40:22,331
Shit...

467
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,821
These people are from
the Korean government.

468
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:37,321
5 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING

469
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:41,691
For crying out loud...

470
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:49,291
What's this?

471
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:50,981
Wait!

472
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:54,191
Vice Minister!

473
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:57,401
I found this on a Taliban website.

474
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:03,020
<i>My name is Hong Mi-sook.</i>

475
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:07,940
<i>I am Korean and I work as a nurse.</i>

476
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:11,361
<i>This is my first time
visiting Afghanistan.</i>

477
00:42:13,111 --> 00:42:18,021
<i>Everyone here is kind
and treating us well.</i>

478
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:26,111
<i>We are provided with a great
meal and bed every day.</i>

479
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:33,611
<i>I miss my family.</i>

480
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,440
<i>I strongly urge</i>

481
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:49,480
<i>the Korean government
take more active steps</i>

482
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:51,441
<i>to save its people.</i>

483
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:57,020
What did he say?

484
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,021
He said they never asked for money.

485
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:09,391
The only way for the Korean hostages to go
home is the release of Taliban prisoners.

486
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:23,270
We warn the Korean government.

487
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:27,640
Persuade the Afghan government to
release Taliban prisoners within 24 hours

488
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:30,061
or we will kill more hostages.

489
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:38,690
Mr. Negotiator, now what?

490
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:41,521
All right, don't panic.

491
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:45,220
The Taliban want us to panic.

492
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:48,360
How can I not panic right now?

493
00:43:48,361 --> 00:43:52,110
Just give me a chance to think!

494
00:43:52,111 --> 00:43:53,861
Think?

495
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:57,610
People are dying while you think!

496
00:43:57,611 --> 00:43:59,480
Watch your mouth!

497
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:00,820
Have you gone mad?

498
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:02,650
Hey, stop it!

499
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:04,571
What are you doing?

500
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:26,451
- One more.
- Sure.

501
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:33,601
Neither America, nor President Karzai

502
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:37,681
will ever hand over the prisoners.

503
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:43,301
There's only one way.

504
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,970
Direct negotiation.

505
00:44:46,971 --> 00:44:49,080
Never.

506
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:52,231
That's absolutely ridiculous.

507
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:54,511
Why?

508
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:57,681
Are you afraid to meet the Taliban?

509
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:01,351
It figures...

510
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:06,601
The dweeb who spends his
life in an air-conditioned office

511
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:11,101
would pee his pants when
meeting the Taliban.

512
00:45:15,221 --> 00:45:18,970
Do you know what it means to sit
at the same table as the Taliban?

513
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:22,390
There is a Maginot line that
can't be crossed in diplomacy.

514
00:45:22,391 --> 00:45:26,760
The moment a diplomat sits
face to face with the Taliban,

515
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:31,800
South Korea becomes a country
that surrendered to terrorists.

516
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:34,391
It would be a crushing diplomatic loss!

517
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,141
Diplomacy...

518
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:40,011
Mr. Diplomat,

519
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:43,471
you can eat this.

520
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:55,141
Then send me. I'll go.

521
00:45:57,051 --> 00:46:00,971
Why? You want to make up
for what happened in Iraq?

522
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:10,301
You think I do this for myself?

523
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:20,760
Here's some personal advice.

524
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:23,220
Just go back to Korea.

525
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:26,600
Staying stuck in the past,
roaming around this place

526
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:29,221
that would drive anyone crazy.

527
00:47:00,411 --> 00:47:02,451
Save me!

528
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:08,011
Please save me...

529
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:13,260
It's all my fault...

530
00:47:13,261 --> 00:47:16,390
Watch, and then tell your government!

531
00:47:16,391 --> 00:47:18,641
I want to go home!

532
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:20,801
No...

533
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:04,791
Are you Mr. Park from South
Korea Intelligence Service?

534
00:48:16,131 --> 00:48:18,510
Let me get this straight.

535
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:23,460
So that broker persuaded the Taliban
to change their list of prisoners,

536
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:27,601
and we'll be able to get
those inmates released?

537
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:30,491
Yes, how many times
do I have to tell you?

538
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:34,750
Abdullah is no simple broker.

539
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:38,850
He's a British businessman who
dealt with the Taliban before the war,

540
00:48:38,851 --> 00:48:41,600
and has intervened in such
kidnappings countless times.

541
00:48:41,601 --> 00:48:43,600
How do we get those
inmates out of prison?

542
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:44,871
An inside job.

543
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:49,811
How is that possible, especially
with the U.S. military against it?

544
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:51,801
Since it's in Ghazni, it's possible.

545
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:55,380
The central government has
less control over that region.

546
00:48:55,381 --> 00:48:57,390
Jailbreaks happen often.

547
00:48:57,391 --> 00:48:59,140
How much does he want?

548
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:00,470
Two million dollars.

549
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:01,471
What?

550
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:15,200
Mr. Abdullah, until now, the Taliban
demanded we release 23 prisoners.

551
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:17,661
Now suddenly, they changed the list?

552
00:49:18,531 --> 00:49:20,170
I don't understand.

553
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:23,500
The Taliban also feel uncomfortable
about these killings.

554
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:27,470
As the clock is ticking, they are
having internal disagreements.

555
00:49:27,471 --> 00:49:30,511
If given the chance,
they prefer to negotiate.

556
00:49:31,431 --> 00:49:35,231
You are not Afghan. Why get involved?

557
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:39,300
As someone who understands the Afghans,

558
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:42,931
I truly want these Koreans
to go back to their families.

559
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:58,550
No trust.

560
00:49:58,551 --> 00:50:00,260
No deal.

561
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:01,961
I'm wasting my time here.

562
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:06,711
Just a moment, please.

563
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:12,770
What's the problem?

564
00:50:12,771 --> 00:50:14,190
He's settled kidnapping cases?

565
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:16,641
Then let's check with
the British government.

566
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:19,980
Everyone working here has
fake names and nationalities.

567
00:50:19,981 --> 00:50:22,230
A background check will take too long.

568
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:24,771
We have to go with our gut feeling.

569
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:28,610
Please decide quickly.

570
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,940
There's no time to sit and think.

571
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:32,940
We need to properly check first!

572
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:36,020
What if there's another victim?
Will you take the blame?

573
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:39,610
If she's ready, put her on the phone.

574
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:40,761
<i>Hello?</i>

575
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:42,891
Will this buy your trust?

576
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:46,161
Two minutes.

577
00:50:48,481 --> 00:50:49,481
<i>Hello?</i>

578
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:54,480
This is the Vice Foreign
Minister. What's your name?

579
00:50:54,481 --> 00:50:57,980
<i>I am Hong Mi-sook. Please help me!</i>

580
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:01,310
Yes, please stay calm.
I'll ask you a few questions.

581
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:03,360
How many are with you now?

582
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:06,150
<i>There are seven of us here.</i>

583
00:51:06,151 --> 00:51:08,940
How many Taliban guards?

584
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,480
<i>Three?</i>

585
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:12,520
How's everyone's health?

586
00:51:12,521 --> 00:51:16,770
<i>Not good, especially Hye-young,
she's not eating at all.</i>

587
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:20,110
Where do you think you are now?
Any recognizable terrain?

588
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:24,691
<i>I don't know. They
keep moving us at night.</i>

589
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:29,190
<i>Wait!</i>

590
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:32,811
<i>Please just tell my family this.</i>

591
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:38,310
<i>I'm sorry, and I love
them. Just tell them that...</i>

592
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:42,401
Ms. Hong! Don't worry, you'll
be able to tell them yourself.

593
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:50,981
So?

594
00:51:51,871 --> 00:51:53,201
Now what?

595
00:52:09,061 --> 00:52:12,560
<i>One hundred dollar bills. No consecutive
serial numbers. Put them in two bags.</i>

596
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:14,011
Mix them up.

597
00:52:35,271 --> 00:52:37,311
Dae-sik, there's 100 here.

598
00:52:41,311 --> 00:52:44,921
<i>As soon as we get the money,
you get the prisoners.</i>

599
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:48,691
4 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

600
00:52:56,771 --> 00:52:58,521
Team A has arrived.

601
00:53:01,771 --> 00:53:04,270
GHAZNI CENTRAL PRISON

602
00:53:04,271 --> 00:53:06,150
Team B ready.

603
00:53:06,151 --> 00:53:09,061
Everyone stay alert, and
let's finish this quickly.

604
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,821
Where is Abdullah?

605
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:01,101
Where's the money?

606
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:12,051
Salaam!

607
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:16,891
Now, release the prisoners.

608
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,711
Should we count the money first?

609
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:24,631
The prisoners first.

610
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:28,111
Very well.

611
00:54:34,991 --> 00:54:36,251
It's me.

612
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:39,241
Release the prisoners.

613
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:53,431
Yes, Vice Minister.
We counted 23 of them.

614
00:54:54,131 --> 00:54:55,501
It's done.

615
00:55:09,591 --> 00:55:11,921
This heat is killing me!

616
00:55:19,961 --> 00:55:21,130
What the...?

617
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:23,250
What is it? What's wrong?

618
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:25,251
Vice Minister, look at this.

619
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:29,960
Director Jeong asked me to
dig up more info on Abdullah.

620
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:32,340
This is from the
British Foreign Ministry,

621
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:34,210
and it seems he's a fake.

622
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:36,500
Abdullah, real name Peter Merchant.

623
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:38,301
It says he died in Kuwait last year.

624
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:41,150
Take the prisoners to this place.

625
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:42,881
The Korean hostages will be there.

626
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:45,731
May God be with you.

627
00:55:52,221 --> 00:55:53,591
Just a moment.

628
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:59,300
Director Jeong! Don't
give him the money!

629
00:55:59,301 --> 00:56:00,121
What?

630
00:56:00,122 --> 00:56:02,121
He's a fraud!

631
00:56:04,811 --> 00:56:05,991
Hands up.

632
00:56:37,581 --> 00:56:38,841
Put it down.

633
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:43,460
Are you okay?

634
00:56:43,461 --> 00:56:44,810
I'm okay.

635
00:56:44,811 --> 00:56:46,351
Put it down!

636
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:05,410
No, don't go!

637
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:06,540
Don't follow them!

638
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:07,541
No!

639
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:17,211
Shit...

640
00:57:49,001 --> 00:57:50,001
Sorry.

641
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:41,421
Take him out, quick!

642
01:00:00,981 --> 01:00:02,360
Hey!

643
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:06,480
Investigate whether that
NIS nut was in on this fraud!

644
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:08,651
Find out how much he got paid!

645
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:14,980
You should've checked if the Taliban
got paid for allowing that call!

646
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:17,771
You think you're here on vacation?

647
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,980
You bastard. You won't
get away with this!

648
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:29,900
You're out to ruin us, aren't you?

649
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:33,111
Please stop, sir.
He's doing all he can.

650
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:52,941
It's a Taliban general.

651
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:55,561
Hussein.

652
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:03,921
He wants to suggest something very
important to the Korean government now.

653
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:15,440
"Transfer $100,000 to the foreign
account by this afternoon.

654
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:17,690
Then we'll release 30 Koreans."

655
01:01:17,691 --> 01:01:20,150
He's saying he'll release 30 Koreans.

656
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:21,731
30?

657
01:01:22,441 --> 01:01:24,651
Not 23, but 30?

658
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:32,400
Fake Taliban, petty crime
inmates, a fraud broker...

659
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:34,271
Damn!

660
01:01:44,081 --> 01:01:45,501
Hello?

661
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:53,790
This time, he says he's
the Taliban commander.

662
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,970
He said the deadline
has already passed.

663
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:59,110
First he's a general,
now he's a commander?

664
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:00,980
Translate this word for word!

665
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:03,561
If he calls one more time,
he won't get away with it!

666
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:11,361
<i>My name is Park Sung-jin.</i>

667
01:02:12,811 --> 01:02:15,020
<i>Born August 1973.</i>

668
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:18,191
<i>I live in Ojeong-dong, Bucheon.</i>

669
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:23,041
Mr. Park Sung-jin!

670
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:29,310
Tell him it's a misunderstanding.
We need more time!

671
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:30,511
Translate now!

672
01:02:33,611 --> 01:02:35,940
<i>Please meet these people's demands!</i>

673
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:37,611
<i>Then we can live.</i>

674
01:02:40,261 --> 01:02:41,810
<i>Please save me!</i>

675
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:45,800
Whatever it takes, we will find
a way to release the prisoners!

676
01:02:45,801 --> 01:02:47,051
Hurry!

677
01:02:54,641 --> 01:02:57,310
We gave enough time,
but you kept wasting time.

678
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:58,930
Hurry and tell them!

679
01:02:58,931 --> 01:03:02,970
<i>I want to live! Please save me!</i>

680
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:06,731
Mr. Park, say "Nanawatai".

681
01:03:08,561 --> 01:03:11,061
Protection! Fairness! Mercy
of the Pashtun people!

682
01:03:13,901 --> 01:03:16,021
<i>- Allah is the Greatest!</i>
- No!

683
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:27,100
Next time, bring me the right answer.

684
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:29,261
The next deadline is
tomorrow at 4 o'clock.

685
01:03:40,061 --> 01:03:43,261
Welcome, Minister. I'm
Secretary Cha Min-yong.

686
01:03:50,941 --> 01:03:53,901
I'm ashamed to make you
come so far, Minister.

687
01:03:55,451 --> 01:03:59,180
<i>The Taliban have warned the Korean government
that there will be further killings.</i>

688
01:03:59,181 --> 01:04:02,110
<i>In response, the Foreign
Affairs minister</i>

689
01:04:02,111 --> 01:04:05,560
<i>has made a visit to the
Afghan President Karzai.</i>

690
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:10,140
<i>Will the Korean government's new negotiation
strategy be able to satisfy the Taliban</i>

691
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:13,600
<i>without causing any friction to
the South Korean-Afghan relations,</i>

692
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:17,501
<i>and effectively prevent the
Taliban from further killings?</i>

693
01:04:56,431 --> 01:04:59,201
Yes?

694
01:05:02,021 --> 01:05:03,730
What happened?

695
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:05,731
They launched a military operation!

696
01:05:07,811 --> 01:05:10,611
What are you talking about?

697
01:05:12,311 --> 01:05:14,400
<i>The military have mobilised in Ghazni,</i>

698
01:05:14,401 --> 01:05:19,310
<i>and there are concerns that the joint
military exercise will provoke the Taliban...</i>

699
01:05:19,311 --> 01:05:23,061
So this is the plan
the Minister brought?

700
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:32,520
Vice Minister.

701
01:05:32,521 --> 01:05:35,020
Is it true that we're launching
a military operation?

702
01:05:35,021 --> 01:05:36,561
Just a normal operation.

703
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:41,371
This is a sensitive time,
it can provoke the Taliban!

704
01:05:41,461 --> 01:05:43,041
We need to stop this right now!

705
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:46,611
How can we stop soldiers from
training on the battlefield?

706
01:05:46,741 --> 01:05:47,940
It's not...

707
01:05:47,941 --> 01:05:50,031
We're preparing for the worst.

708
01:05:51,061 --> 01:05:54,150
If they kill any more hostages,

709
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:56,140
there will be a rescue operation.

710
01:05:56,141 --> 01:06:01,190
Minister, the U.S. military's attacks
in that area have failed for years!

711
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:05,821
So should we just sit back
and watch the hostages die?

712
01:06:06,891 --> 01:06:08,891
We're not done negotiating yet.

713
01:06:08,971 --> 01:06:13,320
President Karzai gave a final
refusal to release the prisoners.

714
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:14,570
What?

715
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:19,280
Director Jeong, start packing.

716
01:06:19,281 --> 01:06:22,400
You've done enough.
Your work is done here.

717
01:06:22,401 --> 01:06:24,991
- Minster!
- I'll take care of it, so go home.

718
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:31,990
Then what will happen to the captives?

719
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:34,821
Minister! The U.S. Army
commander is on the line.

720
01:06:54,651 --> 01:06:55,901
What did he say?

721
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:03,111
How did it go?

722
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:07,531
I've been ordered home.

723
01:07:07,741 --> 01:07:08,741
What?

724
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:15,291
So you're just going to walk away?

725
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,201
And the captives?

726
01:07:19,611 --> 01:07:21,990
You're going to let them die?

727
01:07:21,991 --> 01:07:25,011
Hey!

728
01:07:33,241 --> 01:07:37,860
I feel bad seeing you leave after
all the trouble you went through.

729
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:41,040
I'll come visit you when
I'm back in Seoul.

730
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,741
Thank you for your efforts.

731
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:47,291
Great work.

732
01:07:49,221 --> 01:07:51,051
<i>Let's hear what they have to say.</i>

733
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:55,721
<i>Hong Mi-sook is my wife and
a mother of two children.</i>

734
01:07:56,991 --> 01:08:00,491
<i>Please bring her back safely.</i>

735
01:08:01,781 --> 01:08:05,481
<i>Please help my wife Hong Mi-sook</i>

736
01:08:06,931 --> 01:08:09,641
<i>to return home safely. Please!</i>

737
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:15,411
<i>Honey, you must be so tired.</i>

738
01:08:17,741 --> 01:08:18,911
Hold on.

739
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:29,080
Hello? This is Jeong
Jae-ho from Afghanistan.

740
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:30,950
I'd like to speak to the
Chief Presidential Secretary.

741
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:35,040
<i>He's in a meeting now,
so if you tell me...</i>

742
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:37,330
This is a very urgent matter,
so please connect me.

743
01:08:37,331 --> 01:08:39,700
<i>He can't answer the phone right now.</i>

744
01:08:39,701 --> 01:08:42,700
If I don't talk to him
now, you'll regret it!

745
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:46,821
Director of Foreign Ministry? So what?

746
01:08:47,621 --> 01:08:49,580
Director Jeong, what is it?

747
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:51,041
Mr. Secretary.

748
01:08:54,491 --> 01:08:57,080
Let me negotiate
face-to-face with the Taliban.

749
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:58,790
I'll try to persuade them myself.

750
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:01,161
Did they change their conditions?

751
01:09:02,411 --> 01:09:08,791
No, but face-to-face negotiations
are our last chance now.

752
01:09:12,491 --> 01:09:15,120
I know how you feel,

753
01:09:15,121 --> 01:09:18,701
<i>but Minister Choi is there
now, so follow his orders.</i>

754
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,241
Director, you'll be
late for your flight.

755
01:10:17,401 --> 01:10:20,440
Hello! This is Jeong Jae-ho!

756
01:10:20,441 --> 01:10:22,151
<i>This is the President.</i>

757
01:10:23,081 --> 01:10:26,331
<i>You really think there's a chance?</i>

758
01:10:27,411 --> 01:10:32,911
<i>Everyone says it's
impossible. Is it possible?</i>

759
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:37,661
It's a long shot.

760
01:10:37,831 --> 01:10:41,960
But Mr. President, I can't give up.

761
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:45,360
<i>I'm told we can't
guarantee your safety.</i>

762
01:10:45,361 --> 01:10:48,370
<i>Will you still go?</i>

763
01:10:48,371 --> 01:10:49,371
Yes.

764
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:52,291
<i>You can come back alive?</i>

765
01:10:53,581 --> 01:10:55,541
I'll try my best.

766
01:11:04,371 --> 01:11:06,500
My fellow Koreans.

767
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:10,960
1 HOUR BEFORE DEADLINE
You must be anxious at the news of a second victim

768
01:11:10,961 --> 01:11:17,790
among our people kidnapped
by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

769
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:23,620
<i>I emphasize, we are willing
to use any means possible</i>

770
01:11:23,621 --> 01:11:28,330
<i>to ensure the prompt and
safe return of our citizens.</i>

771
01:11:28,331 --> 01:11:31,461
Director Jeong, do you
know what you've done?

772
01:11:32,661 --> 01:11:38,161
Our president just sent an open invitation
to negotiate with the terrorists!

773
01:11:38,261 --> 01:11:42,391
You know better than anyone what
a stain this is on our diplomacy!

774
01:11:43,671 --> 01:11:49,140
As far as I know, our first
duty is to protect our citizens.

775
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:52,971
If I am mistaken, please tell me.

776
01:11:54,971 --> 01:11:57,310
We have a message from the Taliban.

777
01:11:57,311 --> 01:11:59,260
The hostages are safe,

778
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:01,681
and if we send a team,
they'll negotiate with us.

779
01:12:04,761 --> 01:12:09,470
The expected point of contact is near
Mijan, northeast of Kandahar Province.

780
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:13,430
The U.S. military will provide
protection up to the meeting spot.

781
01:12:13,431 --> 01:12:15,260
It's said they want

782
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:19,350
$1M for a US prisoner, and $1.5M
for an Italian photographer.

783
01:12:19,351 --> 01:12:21,390
We've got a lot of people.

784
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:23,471
This is highly confidential.

785
01:12:27,485 --> 01:12:28,156
Thank you so much.

786
01:12:28,181 --> 01:12:29,431
KIDNAPPING LOCATION

787
01:12:30,351 --> 01:12:32,100
How many vehicles for that day?

788
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:34,351
- Two cars, eight in total.
- Okay.

789
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:45,140
Javeed Nurul Haq.

790
01:12:45,141 --> 01:12:48,181
Considered a top-level terrorist
even among the Taliban.

791
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:58,601
It's a group that the
CIA are keen to capture.

792
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:03,890
This is quite terrible.

793
01:13:03,891 --> 01:13:07,261
He's a notorious figure
even among the Taliban.

794
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:10,511
Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim?

795
01:13:11,851 --> 01:13:14,101
- Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim?
- I'm here!

796
01:13:20,431 --> 01:13:22,970
Dae-sik!

797
01:13:22,971 --> 01:13:23,971
Move!

798
01:13:25,511 --> 01:13:27,680
Dae-sik, buddy!

799
01:13:27,681 --> 01:13:29,721
Can you please get me out of here?

800
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:35,140
No wonder I couldn't reach you.

801
01:13:35,141 --> 01:13:37,220
You couldn't stay out of trouble?

802
01:13:37,221 --> 01:13:39,641
It was a misunderstanding.

803
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:42,100
Should I give you a chance to get out?

804
01:13:42,101 --> 01:13:46,180
Please. As a fellow Korean, please?

805
01:13:46,181 --> 01:13:49,311
- Then translate for me.
- Of course, whatever you...

806
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:51,971
Where are we going?

807
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:54,851
- To the Taliban.
- The Taliban?

808
01:13:59,471 --> 01:14:01,930
Have a safe trip. I'll just stay here.

809
01:14:01,931 --> 01:14:03,510
It's to save people.

810
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:07,220
I should risk my life to save theirs?

811
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:09,640
What nonsense. Bye!

812
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:12,180
It's probably better
than getting flogged.

813
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,560
Flogged?

814
01:14:13,561 --> 01:14:16,980
Gambling, drinking, swindling.

815
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:18,821
You did the full set.

816
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:24,140
Under Sharia law, you'll get
whipped dozens of times.

817
01:14:24,141 --> 01:14:25,601
Can you take that?

818
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:30,471
It hurts. It already hurts.

819
01:14:31,971 --> 01:14:33,811
Let's talk outside.

820
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:37,561
10 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING

821
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:54,161
Are you ready?

822
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,580
What?

823
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,251
You being nice is awkward.

824
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,371
Since I may never see you again.

825
01:15:09,411 --> 01:15:10,751
It's a joke.

826
01:15:12,711 --> 01:15:15,040
You know how to joke?

827
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,501
Why aren't you wearing this?

828
01:15:18,831 --> 01:15:22,591
They'll think I'm scared. I won't
give them the upper hand.

829
01:15:29,121 --> 01:15:33,271
Pride won't protect you from bullets.

830
01:15:38,871 --> 01:15:39,871
Thanks.

831
01:15:48,751 --> 01:15:50,961
No bathroom breaks
during the negotiation.

832
01:15:54,921 --> 01:15:57,141
I can't even drink water?

833
01:17:05,911 --> 01:17:07,331
They're coming.

834
01:17:18,251 --> 01:17:20,290
I heard you were a church deacon.

835
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:22,580
Why does that matter
when I'm facing death?

836
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:25,251
I'll pray to the local god.

837
01:17:41,121 --> 01:17:42,351
What is he saying?

838
01:17:44,211 --> 01:17:45,211
Go on.

839
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:47,410
Huh?

840
01:17:47,411 --> 01:17:48,411
Go.

841
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:50,211
Me?

842
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:56,501
Why'd they have to come here
and cause so much trouble?

843
01:18:04,081 --> 01:18:05,251
Will you be okay?

844
01:18:07,831 --> 01:18:08,831
With what?

845
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:12,660
Not calling your family.

846
01:18:12,661 --> 01:18:16,861
Wow, you really must
have wiretapped us.

847
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:25,041
You know who I envy the most?

848
01:18:28,331 --> 01:18:30,791
Someone with a place to go back to.

849
01:18:38,161 --> 01:18:43,121
They said only the negotiator
and interpreter can come.

850
01:18:45,711 --> 01:18:49,251
I don't think I need this.

851
01:18:51,751 --> 01:18:53,211
Let's go.

852
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:55,161
Wait.

853
01:19:04,961 --> 01:19:07,711
Pop this with your molars in one bite.

854
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:19,871
Hey.

855
01:19:22,081 --> 01:19:23,161
I'm good.

856
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:31,460
Hey! Where are we going?

857
01:20:31,461 --> 01:20:33,210
Shut up.

858
01:20:33,211 --> 01:20:34,961
Where are we going?

859
01:20:45,711 --> 01:20:47,711
Director, how far are we going?

860
01:21:18,621 --> 01:21:24,120
I am Jeong Jae-ho, the negotiator
representing the Korea government.

861
01:21:24,121 --> 01:21:27,501
I'm here to negotiate
the hostage issue.

862
01:21:41,911 --> 01:21:43,541
He says it's nice to meet you.

863
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:55,081
He asks if you brought the answer.

864
01:21:59,621 --> 01:22:02,461
What are you doing? These
people are quick-tempered.

865
01:22:03,971 --> 01:22:08,181
First, ask them to show us
the condition of the Koreans.

866
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:16,931
- Bring the monitor.
- Yes.

867
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:36,380
He says now that you've
checked, let's start talking.

868
01:22:36,381 --> 01:22:39,801
- There's one more thing.
- What is it now?

869
01:22:46,011 --> 01:22:48,430
As I'm here on behalf of
the Korean government,

870
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:52,131
you should prove you are
the leader of this negotiation.

871
01:23:05,051 --> 01:23:07,091
This guy is a bit particular.

872
01:23:12,931 --> 01:23:15,801
What can he do to make you believe him?

873
01:23:18,971 --> 01:23:21,430
Tell him to release three
of the hostages first.

874
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:23,431
- What?
- Translate, now!

875
01:23:24,381 --> 01:23:25,881
Dammit, this...

876
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:37,011
He says you're tricking them!

877
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:43,551
If you let them go now, Muslims all
over the world will be proud of you.

878
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:05,590
He said he'll let two go.

879
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:07,181
That it's a gift from Allah.

880
01:24:30,501 --> 01:24:32,530
Hold on. We have to
check for explosives.

881
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:33,830
What the hell are you saying?

882
01:24:33,831 --> 01:24:34,871
Over here!

883
01:24:40,471 --> 01:24:43,011
Oh, god!

884
01:24:43,841 --> 01:24:46,631
Ms. Kim Hye-young? Ms. Kim?

885
01:24:48,711 --> 01:24:50,160
Come here.

886
01:24:50,161 --> 01:24:51,471
Come here!

887
01:24:54,091 --> 01:24:55,091
Hello?

888
01:24:55,092 --> 01:24:56,511
<i>How did it go?</i>

889
01:24:58,011 --> 01:25:00,300
Kim Hye-young and Lee
Jin-hee are safe with us.

890
01:25:00,301 --> 01:25:01,501
<i>Okay.</i>

891
01:25:09,761 --> 01:25:11,631
He says it's our turn.

892
01:25:16,761 --> 01:25:18,141
What are you doing?

893
01:25:19,591 --> 01:25:21,551
Come on, say something!

894
01:25:27,471 --> 01:25:29,341
There will be no release of prisoners.

895
01:25:32,931 --> 01:25:34,380
What?

896
01:25:34,381 --> 01:25:35,880
You said you brought the answer.

897
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,880
This is our answer.

898
01:25:37,881 --> 01:25:40,841
If he wants to proceed, tell
him to change the conditions.

899
01:25:42,181 --> 01:25:44,180
I can't. We'll die if I say that.

900
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:46,550
What did he say? Tell us now!

901
01:25:46,551 --> 01:25:48,611
Okay, I'll tell you.

902
01:25:56,181 --> 01:25:58,931
This will only weaken
your bargaining power!

903
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:18,931
He said he'll do the
negotiation his way.

904
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,781
He told them to kill that woman.

905
01:26:31,551 --> 01:26:33,521
Sir, won't you do something?

906
01:26:52,471 --> 01:26:53,471
Stop!

907
01:26:56,761 --> 01:26:57,761
Wait.

908
01:27:05,561 --> 01:27:09,101
I will ask our government.

909
01:27:27,221 --> 01:27:32,430
<i>They're changing their conditions.</i>

910
01:27:32,431 --> 01:27:39,721
He said to free all Taliban
prisoners by midnight tonight.

911
01:27:41,681 --> 01:27:44,840
Let me confirm that.

912
01:27:44,841 --> 01:27:49,220
All of the Taliban prisoners?

913
01:27:49,221 --> 01:27:50,451
<i>That's correct.</i>

914
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:52,681
If we don't,

915
01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:56,681
they'll kill a hostage

916
01:27:57,971 --> 01:27:59,391
every hour.

917
01:28:01,221 --> 01:28:02,601
300 prisoners?

918
01:28:03,771 --> 01:28:07,971
They had no intention of
negotiating in the first place.

919
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:11,871
Let's go to Bagram Air Base.

920
01:28:14,061 --> 01:28:15,600
Please wait a little longer!

921
01:28:15,601 --> 01:28:17,640
Who do you think you are?

922
01:28:17,641 --> 01:28:20,140
We sent Jeong Jae-ho as our negotiator!

923
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:23,520
Shouldn't we give him
that slim chance and wait?

924
01:28:23,521 --> 01:28:26,681
If we start bombing now, the
negotiator is in most danger.

925
01:28:40,891 --> 01:28:44,141
I think it's time, why
aren't they calling?

926
01:28:48,931 --> 01:28:49,931
They won't.

927
01:28:51,221 --> 01:28:53,891
Why? Wait a minute...

928
01:28:59,711 --> 01:29:03,720
They said the Korean government broke off
the negotiation. What'll happen to us?

929
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:06,261
We never should have
given them a chance!

930
01:29:07,221 --> 01:29:08,601
You tricked us.

931
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:12,851
No!

932
01:29:20,511 --> 01:29:23,220
The Allies have launched
a military campaign.

933
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:24,931
What?

934
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:40,350
He said to stop lying.

935
01:29:40,351 --> 01:29:44,021
They've got 21 hostages, so the Allies
can't carry out a rescue operation.

936
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:49,560
Why did he say 21? Two
got released, it should be 19...

937
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:52,181
This isn't a rescue operation,
this is a mop-up operation!

938
01:29:59,591 --> 01:30:03,971
The U.S. and Afghan forces just
needed an excuse to level this place.

939
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:07,890
When the operation starts,

940
01:30:07,891 --> 01:30:13,221
the hostages, you and your
men, and us too will all die!

941
01:30:15,141 --> 01:30:19,851
Are a few of your men more
important than saving many lives?

942
01:30:23,381 --> 01:30:29,411
You yourself provided the excuse
for this bombing. Know that!

943
01:30:42,201 --> 01:30:43,951
I know what you are thinking.

944
01:30:45,131 --> 01:30:48,420
You come here to save those people.

945
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:51,141
You don't just let them be killed.

946
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:55,191
Tell your government
to stop the attack.

947
01:30:59,031 --> 01:31:00,480
We don't have the power.

948
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:02,170
Koreans aren't our guests.

949
01:31:02,171 --> 01:31:04,350
You sent the troops here!

950
01:31:04,351 --> 01:31:06,860
You are an extremely rich country.

951
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:08,651
You can do whatever you want.

952
01:31:12,331 --> 01:31:14,420
You may be a good commander,

953
01:31:14,421 --> 01:31:18,001
but you are nothing as a negotiator.

954
01:31:19,001 --> 01:31:20,951
You know your biggest mistake?

955
01:31:22,471 --> 01:31:24,321
You overestimated us.

956
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:44,010
Allah is the only god.

957
01:31:44,011 --> 01:31:47,261
Muhammad... Muhammad
is the only prophet.

958
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:10,380
It's the price of breaking
down this deal.

959
01:32:10,381 --> 01:32:12,721
I will send you the hell first!

960
01:32:16,791 --> 01:32:20,340
The only way to stop the bombing
is to tell them we have a deal.

961
01:32:20,341 --> 01:32:22,650
We are not afraid of American missiles!

962
01:32:22,651 --> 01:32:24,000
Time is on our side.

963
01:32:24,001 --> 01:32:25,360
So is Allah.

964
01:32:25,361 --> 01:32:28,120
Eventually, we are
going to win this war.

965
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:30,300
Why take things so far?

966
01:32:30,301 --> 01:32:31,920
You know better than anyone,

967
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:34,221
the prisoner exchange is impossible!

968
01:32:34,871 --> 01:32:36,341
Why do you think?

969
01:32:39,781 --> 01:32:40,841
Money.

970
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:44,271
Money? You have insulted us!

971
01:32:47,761 --> 01:32:48,761
Take him out!

972
01:32:51,891 --> 01:32:52,951
Take him too!

973
01:32:54,471 --> 01:32:58,971
He told them to take me
too! Director, what do I do?

974
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:07,391
These American bastards!

975
01:33:08,181 --> 01:33:09,511
Allah is the Greatest!

976
01:33:35,811 --> 01:33:37,241
50 million.

977
01:33:44,361 --> 01:33:45,431
40.

978
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:48,621
20.

979
01:34:11,091 --> 01:34:15,021
Remember, Afghanistan
is the graveyard of empires.

980
01:34:19,441 --> 01:34:21,540
Send all the troops home.

981
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:24,941
Make all Koreans leave
Afghanistan in a month, for good.

982
01:34:26,341 --> 01:34:27,431
Okay?

983
01:34:31,151 --> 01:34:32,280
Okay.

984
01:34:32,281 --> 01:34:34,630
Never set your foot
again in this country,

985
01:34:34,631 --> 01:34:35,711
Korean.

986
01:35:06,301 --> 01:35:07,680
Hello?

987
01:35:07,681 --> 01:35:09,530
The negotiation is done.

988
01:35:09,531 --> 01:35:11,720
They'll release all the hostages.

989
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:13,591
Call the Americans.

990
01:35:14,341 --> 01:35:15,761
Good work!

991
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:20,791
Director Jeong?

992
01:35:22,851 --> 01:35:25,521
<i>Nice work everyone.
We've reached a deal!</i>

993
01:35:43,011 --> 01:35:46,181
You can go back to Korea now.

994
01:35:50,681 --> 01:35:51,681
Thank you.

995
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:26,591
I take back my comment
on you being a dweeb.

996
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:32,710
Great work.

997
01:36:32,711 --> 01:36:34,970
No, thank you.

998
01:36:34,971 --> 01:36:39,221
I really wouldn't have been
able to do it without you.

999
01:36:44,551 --> 01:36:45,681
What's this?

1000
01:36:49,871 --> 01:36:51,800
They said one has to stay behind.

1001
01:36:51,801 --> 01:36:54,720
What are they talking about?

1002
01:36:54,721 --> 01:36:58,380
They guaranteed our safety up to here,

1003
01:36:58,381 --> 01:37:00,460
so they want to
ensure their safety too.

1004
01:37:00,461 --> 01:37:02,491
We're done negotiating, what is this?

1005
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:09,041
He said if we don't do
it, no one can leave here.

1006
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:25,211
I'm the representative of
this negotiation, so I'll stay.

1007
01:37:32,461 --> 01:37:40,251
Then as the person in charge,
lead them safely back to Korea.

1008
01:37:42,711 --> 01:37:44,251
It's my turn now.

1009
01:37:49,331 --> 01:37:53,211
Don't worry. My luck is good.

1010
01:37:58,751 --> 01:37:59,951
I will stay.

1011
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:03,121
Let him go.

1012
01:38:08,831 --> 01:38:10,001
Get it together!

1013
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:12,961
Be sure to see the director off.

1014
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:16,921
You did well, Lee Bong-han. Go.

1015
01:38:21,261 --> 01:38:23,381
Take care of yourself, brother.

1016
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:27,840
"If I break this agreement and disclose
anything about my work here,

1017
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:30,551
I agree to be punished
according to the law..."

1018
01:39:31,901 --> 01:39:33,401
Pretty straightforward, right?

1019
01:39:44,581 --> 01:39:45,581
Thank you.

1020
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:56,051
We work ourselves to death,
and are left with nothing.

1021
01:39:58,671 --> 01:40:01,640
21 people came back alive.

1022
01:40:01,641 --> 01:40:02,761
That's true.

1023
01:40:08,891 --> 01:40:14,350
<i>The 21 former hostages abducted
in Afghanistan on September 19</i>

1024
01:40:14,351 --> 01:40:16,900
<i>have just landed at
Incheon Int'I Airport.</i>

1025
01:40:16,901 --> 01:40:19,690
<i>The safety of one anonymous team member</i>

1026
01:40:19,691 --> 01:40:25,020
<i>who remained with the Taliban after
the deal has also been confirmed.</i>

1027
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:31,351
<i>This marks an end to the largest
hostage crisis in Korea's history.</i>

1028
01:40:36,231 --> 01:40:38,691
3 MONTHS LATER

1029
01:40:39,811 --> 01:40:43,020
The Minister's at the press conference,
but we still haven't figured it out?

1030
01:40:43,021 --> 01:40:45,901
What do you even do? Find out now!

1031
01:40:49,271 --> 01:40:50,600
Hello, who is this?

1032
01:40:50,601 --> 01:40:53,810
<i>You didn't go to Washington?</i>

1033
01:40:53,811 --> 01:40:55,361
<i>Or maybe you couldn't?</i>

1034
01:40:56,601 --> 01:40:58,061
Park Dae-sik?

1035
01:40:59,651 --> 01:41:01,270
You son of a...

1036
01:41:01,271 --> 01:41:03,851
So quick to swear at me!

1037
01:41:04,071 --> 01:41:05,570
<i>Where are you now?</i>

1038
01:41:05,571 --> 01:41:07,820
Why didn't you call?

1039
01:41:07,821 --> 01:41:10,740
You know how worried
I was? You weren't hurt?

1040
01:41:10,741 --> 01:41:13,411
I told you. My luck is good.

1041
01:41:14,871 --> 01:41:17,370
Is that Director Jeong? Me, me!

1042
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:21,110
Hold on, someone wants to say hi.

1043
01:41:21,111 --> 01:41:22,410
<i>Huh?</i>

1044
01:41:22,411 --> 01:41:24,070
Director Jeong...

1045
01:41:24,071 --> 01:41:25,950
Salaam! Have you been well?

1046
01:41:25,951 --> 01:41:28,490
Oh, Qasim! Lee Bong-han!

1047
01:41:28,491 --> 01:41:32,270
There must really be no one there.
Working with Qasim again?

1048
01:41:32,271 --> 01:41:36,021
Last time in Afghanistan, I
don't think I got fully paid...

1049
01:41:37,121 --> 01:41:38,121
You little...

1050
01:41:38,821 --> 01:41:41,191
Director Jeong, come quickly.

1051
01:41:42,491 --> 01:41:46,530
Anyway, take care of yourselves.
Let's get in touch soon.

1052
01:41:46,531 --> 01:41:48,200
<i>Take care and...</i>

1053
01:41:48,201 --> 01:41:52,281
I won't say see you later. Don't
want to get into another mess.

1054
01:41:57,821 --> 01:41:58,991
Park Dae-sik.

1055
01:42:00,691 --> 01:42:03,910
Everyone has a place to go back to.

1056
01:42:03,911 --> 01:42:04,951
You know, right?

1057
01:42:09,621 --> 01:42:13,371
Peace be upon you.

1058
01:42:21,871 --> 01:42:25,200
Did he say he'll pay? No?

1059
01:42:25,201 --> 01:42:27,321
Always talking about money...

1060
01:42:28,371 --> 01:42:30,200
Let's go!

1061
01:42:30,201 --> 01:42:34,280
At 8:43 a.m. today, our
government confirmed

1062
01:42:34,281 --> 01:42:38,910
that Marine Star 1 from Dongin
Shipping Co. Of Busan

1063
01:42:38,911 --> 01:42:43,030
was kidnapped in waters
off the Indian Ocean,

1064
01:42:43,031 --> 01:42:48,200
300 km from the port
of Kismayo, Somalia.

1065
01:42:48,201 --> 01:42:53,820
The hijacked ship carrying
a total of 25 people

1066
01:42:53,821 --> 01:42:56,070
is believed to have been hijacked

1067
01:42:56,071 --> 01:42:59,241
by Somali pirates armed
with portable rockets.

1068
01:43:00,161 --> 01:43:04,660
We are holding an emergency
diplomatic and security meeting

1069
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:06,740
to discuss countermeasures,

1070
01:43:06,741 --> 01:43:10,991
and a response team will
be sent as soon as possible.

1071
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:16,531
HWANG JUNG-MIN
