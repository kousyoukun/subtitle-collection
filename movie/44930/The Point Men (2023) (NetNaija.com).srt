<i>This film is inspired by actual events,</i>

6
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:49,621
<i>but all characters and situations
have been fictionalized.</i>

7
00:00:55,711 --> 00:01:00,621
<i>On Sept. 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda led by
Osama bin Laden attacked the US.</i>

8
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:09,171
<i>The US declared war on Afghanistan
for giving refuge to bin Laden.</i>

9
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,670
<i>38 countries joined the war,</i>

10
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:18,501
<i>with South Korea sending
hundreds of non-combat troops.</i>

11
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:23,620
<i>After losing power to
a pro-US government,</i>

12
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:27,791
<i>the Taliban turned to suicide
bombing and kidnapping foreigners.</i>

15
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,420
Let us pray.

16
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:24,000
Lord, please bestow Your
grace on this barren land.

17
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:24,671
Amen!

18
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:28,420
And please let the seeds
we plant today take root.

19
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:32,330
Help the people of this
land to understand that

20
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,290
- Jehovah is their...
- Lord.

21
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,000
- one god.
- Amen!

22
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:41,000
We believe the Lord Jesus
will be the King of all peace!

23
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:42,001
Amen!

24
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,171
Everyone okay?

25
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:49,831
What's going on?

26
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,750
Open the door!

27
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:55,540
I'm just a bus driver.

28
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,801
Please don't hurt me!

29
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,961
Open up, now!

30
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:18,481
Quiet!

SOUTH KOREA, FOREIGN MINISTRY

00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:47,261
Deputy Kim!

34
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:48,610
Yes?

35
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:49,850
What happened?

36
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:52,760
They were supposed to arrive at
Kandahar yesterday, but they didn't.

37
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:57,060
That's not what I mean! There's
a travel ban on that country!

38
00:04:57,061 --> 00:05:01,770
They entered Dubai through
Beijing, so we never expected...

39
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:03,941
Just kill me already.

40
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:09,261
What is this?

41
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:11,481
They're all from the same church.

42
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,900
What's their purpose for going there?

43
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:18,400
We believe it's short-term
missionary work.

44
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,321
- What?
- Look!

45
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:35,361
<i>We demand the Korean government to pull
its troops out of Afghanistan immediately</i>

46
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:43,070
<i>and promptly release 23 Taliban
warriors locked in Kabul Prison.</i>

47
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:47,400
Tell the Press Office that all media
should describe them as volunteers.

48
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:48,191
What?

49
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,940
Run, or they're all dead!

50
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:50,821
Yes, sir!

51
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:51,900
- Bae!
- Yes?

52
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,400
- Call a meeting quickly.
- Yes, sir.

53
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:54,610
- Check with foreign press.
- Yes.

54
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:58,570
<i>If our request is not met by
then, we'll kill the hostages.</i>

55
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:00,111
<i>We give you 24 hours.</i>

56
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:10,241
KARACHI PRISON, PAKISTAN

57
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:17,821
Come out!

58
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,031
What is going on?

59
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:37,861
Sign here.

60
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,611
<i>Park Dae-sik</i>

61
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,531
A hard stay, right?

62
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:05,240
Three months. No, was it four?

63
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:08,530
Can't even remember.

64
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:11,401
Counterfeiting dollars
was a bit extreme.

65
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,781
Was it my decision?

66
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:17,241
You said you'd pull me out quickly.

67
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:21,400
Is this how the nation treats
one who risks his life?

68
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,690
You know counterfeiting
is a sensitive issue here.

69
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:25,691
Okay!

70
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:29,111
Go to Kabul.

71
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,941
Let's not see each other again.

72
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,900
What's with your attitude?

73
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:50,071
- People were kidnapped!
- You take care of it.

74
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,691
It's 23 people!

75
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:09,610
Hurry!

76
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:10,611
Hurry up!

77
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:29,940
<i>We will soon be landing at
Kabul International Airport.</i>

78
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:34,320
<i>The time in Kabul is 8:24 a.m.,
with a temperature of 31 degrees.</i>

79
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:36,650
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts and return
your tray tables to the upright position.</i>

80
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:37,651
Vice Minister.

81
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:40,400
- Vice Minister!
- Huh?

82
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,320
We're landing. Please
put on your seatbelt.

83
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,321
Okay.

84
00:08:56,071 --> 00:09:00,241
KABUL, CAPITAL OF AFGHANISTAN

85
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:04,611
5 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

86
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:37,491
Welcome.

87
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:40,610
How is it with the Afghan government?

88
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:44,241
The ambassador is doing all
he can, but they won't budge.

89
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,241
Please come with me.

90
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:21,441
What is it?

91
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:23,121
He's an intelligence agent.

92
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:33,120
Are you the negotiator?

93
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,911
What's your strategy?

94
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:46,700
They like to show they mean business,

95
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:49,411
so send some positive signal
before they kill someone.

96
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,661
Understand?

97
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:02,870
Isn't that the freak who was
screwing around in Pakistan?

98
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,160
Yes, sir.

99
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:07,370
Didn't he get kicked
out? Why is he here?

100
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:11,370
I heard he helped deal with the
Korean hostage incident in Iraq.

101
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,120
But that hostage died.

102
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:17,620
Intelligence officers are
so scarce in this region...

103
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:21,041
They must really be
desperate for agents.

104
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,661
AFGHAN FOREIGN MINISTRY

105
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:48,240
Two days ago, two German deporters
were kidnapped in the exact same area.

106
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:53,900
I don't understand why the Koreans did
not ask our government for protection.

107
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:57,110
Especially when they are
moving in such a large group.

108
00:11:57,111 --> 00:12:01,491
Tell him to stop lecturing
and release those prisoners.

109
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:08,250
The most important thing right
now is to bring them back, right?

110
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:12,740
Please release some Taliban prisoners
in exchange for the Koreans,

111
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:15,761
like you did last time
for the Italian deporter.

112
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,450
The Italian deporter again.

113
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:22,610
That was a very exceptional case.

114
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,260
And it was one person at that time.

115
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:28,281
This time, there are
many. Way too many.

116
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:37,400
You are aware that the kidnappers
asked us to withdraw the troops.

117
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:39,240
Yes, I know.

118
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:44,110
But the Korean troops were scheduled to
go back at the end of the year anyway.

119
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,630
They gave you a very easy task.

120
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:48,591
We could postpone it.

121
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,830
We could even consider
sending more troops

122
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:02,551
to expand the medical facilities
and roads in Afghanistan.

123
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:12,330
The Afghan Foreign Minister has
decided to hold a press conference.

124
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:13,581
Here's Director Jeong.

125
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:19,040
How long do you think it'll
take to exchange prisoners?

126
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:23,160
It doesn't seem it will take too long.

127
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:26,040
But America's stance is most important,

128
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,700
<i>so I think you should
contact Washington.</i>

129
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:29,910
Got it.

130
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:31,240
<i>Good work.</i>

131
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,581
Yes, thank you!

132
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:41,201
ROK EMBASSY ABDUCTION RESPONSE HQ

133
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:55,491
Tell me the terms of the agreement.

134
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:01,871
Did you not hear me?

135
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,690
Look, don't you have
any sense of procedure?

136
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:13,790
Instead of just bursting in,
go through official channels.

137
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,830
I've got no use for that.

138
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:18,451
Will they really release
Taliban prisoners?

139
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:26,081
The Afghans will never do a
deal over the troop withdrawal.

140
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,160
How do you know about that?

141
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,490
That's a diplomatic secret
sent over the hotline!

142
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:37,380
Are you wiretapping us?

143
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:38,691
I won't let this slide!

144
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:44,081
What do you know about this country?

145
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:48,871
People here grind their teeth
at the mention of the Taliban.

146
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:55,950
The president almost got sacked when
he tried to release a few prisoners.

147
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:59,491
You think he'll let 23 go free?

148
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:02,451
Sir, it's starting.

149
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:12,411
Hussein! Hussein!

150
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:28,190
"We are working closely with
the South Korean government

151
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,860
to solve this hostage crisis."

152
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:33,151
<i>Will you accept the Taliban's
demand to release the prisoners?</i>

153
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:42,561
"Under no circumstances will we
release the Taliban prisoners."

154
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:50,890
"The Afghan government is
considering all other options

155
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:53,660
to ensure that none of the
Korean hostages are hurt."

156
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,160
What are those bastards saying?

157
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,241
Jeong, what's going on?

158
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:02,451
It's from Seoul.

159
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:05,441
Yes, Chief.

160
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:08,191
<i>Didn't you say you
reached an agreement?</i>

161
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:12,921
It seems there was a misunderstanding.

162
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:16,210
Yes, we'll get it cleared up soon.

163
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,521
<i>We've got one hour left!</i>

164
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:21,381
I know, but...

165
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:33,920
The Afghan officials aren't picking up?

166
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:35,051
What? Not yet...

167
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:37,881
What's with this traffic?

168
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,050
I'm losing my mind...

169
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,500
Is there any shortcut?

170
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,210
Should we try going through the alleys?

171
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,251
Sure.

172
00:16:58,631 --> 00:16:59,961
Shit...

173
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,251
Even more packed here.

174
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:27,000
Hey, how much time is left?

175
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,590
40 minutes.

176
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:29,671
Jeez.

177
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,921
Let's take the opposite lane.

178
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:46,960
Are you blind?

179
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:48,750
Sorry, sorry!

180
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,541
Slowly. Okay, let's go.

181
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,961
- Are you crazy?
- Are you blind?

182
00:17:58,091 --> 00:18:00,210
What is it now?

183
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,460
How far is it?

184
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:03,340
It's at the second
intersection, on the corner.

185
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,670
Vice Minister!

186
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,050
There's no time, I
think we should walk.

187
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:09,551
But arriving on foot...

188
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:13,131
Hurry, it's fine!

189
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:15,051
Seriously?

190
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:41,121
Allah is the Greatest!

191
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:42,841
Is he still not picking up?

192
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:48,421
Sir! Are you okay?

193
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:52,301
Vice Minister, are you hurt?

194
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:58,460
Hello?

195
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,091
Director Jeong?

196
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:02,250
We have 30 minutes left.

197
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:03,881
What do you think will happen?

198
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:06,840
I think they'll be killed.

199
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,051
How do we stop them?

200
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,890
Announce that we'll withdraw troops,

201
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:13,950
and contact the OIC quickly.
<i>Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)</i>

202
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,991
<i>Changing our stance means
admitting we made a mistake.</i>

203
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:24,921
If you look at the situation here,

204
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,801
there is no other way.

205
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:36,170
Minister! You announced a withdrawal?

206
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:38,501
Are we giving in to terrorists
after negotiations failed?

207
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:46,300
What's the backdrop
to this hasty decision?

208
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:47,301
Minister!

209
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:55,170
Director! The Taliban
extended the deadline!

210
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,631
What?

211
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,481
- By how much?
- 24 hours.

212
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,580
Take good care of the Vice Minister.

213
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:04,830
What?

214
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,581
- Director!
- Where are you going?

215
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,980
Don't you think you
should see a doctor first?

216
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:45,141
I thought we had an agreement.
Why did you back down?

217
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:47,681
Don't be upset.

218
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:50,700
We think it is very regretful

219
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:54,350
that the Korean government had
to give in to the Taliban's demand.

220
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:59,041
We feel the same that the Afghan
government broke our agreement!

221
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:04,160
All you care about is getting
the hostages released.

222
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:07,280
But we have to keep
fighting the Taliban,

223
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:09,151
even after you leave.

224
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:12,360
Please understand that for us,

225
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:15,071
this is a very complicated decision.

226
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:18,780
Listen to me.

227
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:22,310
What does it take to
release the prisoners?

228
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:23,341
Aid?

229
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:25,961
Or American consent?

230
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:30,111
Answer me. Next time,
there may be no extensions.

231
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:33,360
Don't get desperate.

232
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:36,121
This is exactly what the Taliban want.

233
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:40,210
You sound like you
don't care if they die.

234
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:43,581
They are innocent
people. Just civilians!

235
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,671
You really believe they are innocent?

236
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:51,411
Excuse me?

237
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:57,611
Hello.

238
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,871
Okay.

239
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:05,230
I have a very urgent
matter I have to attend to.

240
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:07,740
- If you don't mind.
- No, no!

241
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:09,080
We are not done.

242
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:11,381
A German hostage has been murdered.

243
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:16,300
Next will be a Korean.

244
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,751
Mr. Jeong.

245
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:22,911
Do you believe what the Taliban
really want is the prisoners' release?

246
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:25,931
Are you saying there's something else?

247
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:29,501
I think we already told you.

248
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:36,520
Salaam.

249
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:37,951
Do you know this guy?

250
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:42,251
You seen him?

251
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:48,510
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

252
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:49,981
Do you know this guy?

253
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:54,111
Ask at the second floor
restaurant across the street.

254
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,581
Hurry up!

255
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:35,381
Are you Qasim?

256
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:39,101
What is he saying?

257
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:42,360
Qasim is busy now.

258
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:44,611
Qasim doesn't know Korean.

259
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:50,661
Hey!

260
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:53,411
Lee Bong-han!

261
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,750
You know me?

262
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:58,911
Come outside.

263
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:03,410
If you're tired, move to a hotel.

264
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:06,831
No, I have to hold down the fort.

265
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:11,001
Are you okay?

266
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:16,001
The Afghans said we could
pay a ransom for the prisoners?

267
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:17,720
Why didn't you tell me?

268
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:20,170
Bargain with terrorists?

269
00:25:20,171 --> 00:25:22,180
Are you out of your mind?

270
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:25,750
What did the Germans get
for sticking to their principles?

271
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:28,260
Their hostage was murdered!

272
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,701
I'll report to the Minister.

273
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:37,050
The world will see us as
pushovers if word gets out!

274
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:41,550
Our aim is to prevent killings,
not protect our reputation!

275
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:43,551
Everyone here knows that!

276
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:47,220
Sit still for now.

277
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:49,430
The intelligence service said
they'll solve it in two days.

278
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:50,740
Two days?

279
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:52,880
We only have a day.

280
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,260
What can the NIS do?

281
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,761
The Jirga!

282
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:58,131
The Jirga.

283
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:03,840
The Jirga is a council of
Afghan tribal leaders.

284
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:09,430
In a practical sense, all issues in
Afghanistan are decided by them.

285
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,930
If they issue a decision,

286
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:15,340
the hostages can be released
without an exchange of prisoners.

287
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:21,841
Currently, our elite agent and a local
coordinator are making contact.

288
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:28,340
What's wrong?

289
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:29,971
What? Let's go.

290
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:39,290
He says the mule must rest.

291
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,340
Or you can pay another
10 thousand afghanis.

292
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:44,051
What a crook.

293
00:26:46,431 --> 00:26:48,841
We're not even halfway there.

294
00:26:51,221 --> 00:26:53,130
This is the only road?

295
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:54,301
Sure.

296
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:58,431
I'm serious.

297
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:09,341
Okay, 20 thousand.

298
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:12,750
And another 20 if we
get there before dark.

299
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:14,561
Okay? Go.

300
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:19,721
Dae-sik, you should pay him through me.

301
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:23,551
Wait up!

302
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:31,590
PASHTUN TRIBAL VILLAGE

303
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:34,841
19 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

304
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:38,090
Greetings.

305
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:40,260
This man says he knows Ismael.

306
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:42,011
They are Koreans.

307
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:54,471
Smile.

308
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:01,050
You know Ismael?

309
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:03,050
Do I know him?

310
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:06,340
I saved him by taking him
to the Korean medical unit

311
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:12,000
to get surgery after a bomb exploded.

312
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:14,691
You did?

313
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:23,801
Any friend of my nephew is my friend.

314
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:28,220
But what brings you all the way here?

315
00:28:28,221 --> 00:28:30,920
He's asking why we're here.

316
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:33,131
It's because of the Korean hostages.

317
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:37,331
It's because of the Korean hostages.

318
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:46,421
These people came all
this way for volunteer work.

319
00:28:55,701 --> 00:29:03,701
And he brought this
gift as a peace offering.

320
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:05,621
It's the latest phone.

321
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,880
Rotate to open.

322
00:29:10,881 --> 00:29:13,721
Rotate to close.

323
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:22,081
See, they love anything made in Korea.

324
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:36,000
How do you know about this?

325
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,791
You think I'm here to play?

326
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,210
You said there's no road.

327
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:46,580
There isn't... it's all minefields.

328
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:47,721
Damn you!

329
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:54,610
I'm Jeong Jae-ho, representing
Korean government.

330
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:56,460
Nice to meet you.

331
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,540
This is Jeong Jae-ho.

332
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:02,131
He's a representative of
the Korean government.

333
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:06,671
Welcome.

334
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:09,791
Come in.

335
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:14,290
Hello, I'm Afghanistan's only
Pashtun-Korean interpreter,

336
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,460
Abdul Kareem Qasim...

337
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:19,961
Qasim for short, just call me Qasim!

338
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:24,670
You're a Korean? That's amazing.

339
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:26,581
- I'll need your help, then.
- Yes.

340
00:30:27,631 --> 00:30:29,211
What are you doing here?

341
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,150
What? I am cooperating.

342
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:33,861
Don't you dare butt in here.

343
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:38,231
Step aside. I'll handle this my way.

344
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:45,321
This place has its own rules.

345
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:49,611
We don't have time for this.
23 lives depend on us.

346
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:03,151
Sir, please calculate
my fee separately.

347
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:14,441
A professional negotiator like
you is really in another class!

348
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:20,610
A hospital in the chief's
name, building a school...

349
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:22,981
That's not class, it's cash.

350
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,691
So a new mobile phone is more classy?

351
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:32,820
You both work for the
country, no need to bicker.

352
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:36,150
Doesn't matter what path you
take to get to the same place.

353
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:38,861
And the phone did the trick. Nice job.

354
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:51,941
Is he really a key
figure within the Jirga?

355
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:56,731
For sure.

356
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:00,230
He's royal family.

357
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:01,820
Royal family?

358
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:04,071
Family lines are important in Islam.

359
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:08,530
There are some families
even the Taliban can't touch.

360
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:11,781
So we need to win
over that tribal chief.

361
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:27,400
Korean! Join us.

362
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:29,940
I think they're testing us.

363
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:30,941
Wait.

364
00:32:31,941 --> 00:32:34,280
Don't underestimate their pride.

365
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:36,441
If you refuse, they'll think
you don't respect them.

366
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:57,731
Have a smoke!

367
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:06,440
That isn't tobacco, it's a
strong strain of hashish.

368
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:08,690
One more time!

369
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:10,360
He says to smoke more, but don't do it.

370
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:11,501
I'm fine!

371
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:16,481
Great!

372
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:42,511
Someone's coming...

373
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:03,090
He said he'll help us.

374
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:06,761
He said the hostages will be
safe as we discuss the matter.

375
00:34:13,391 --> 00:34:16,640
They're helping us because
they want to show

376
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:19,721
that Islam respects honor
and is welcoming to guests.

377
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:29,051
JIRGA ASSEMBLY

378
00:34:58,301 --> 00:34:59,971
They decided to let them go.

379
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:03,591
Really? For real?

380
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:05,890
Wow!

381
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:08,930
Great work, really!

382
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:10,301
Thank you!

383
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,471
I'll buy you a drink back in Korea!

384
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,361
I'm not going back to Korea.

385
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:23,551
I like this area.

386
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:29,131
I like feeling I'm the only
one between sky and earth.

387
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:40,221
Hey! Listen up!

388
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:45,301
They agreed to release the hostages!

389
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:53,680
What kind of reaction is that?

390
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:57,010
Anyway, my great translating

391
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:59,970
and pretending to know
Ismael played a big part.

392
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:01,561
You're not friends with Ismael?

393
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:04,761
One in three guys here is named Ismael.

394
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:11,130
That tickles.

395
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:14,671
Have you no fear,
pulling a prank like that?

396
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:20,181
Jeez...

397
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:25,971
Now, let's settle the payment.

398
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,550
FOREIGN MINISTRY

399
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:29,760
Director.

400
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:31,220
What?

401
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:35,050
There's no plane that
can take all 23 of them.

402
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:36,591
Should I book a private plane?

403
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:41,680
Who are they, Olympic gold medalists?

404
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:43,470
Find some connecting flights!

405
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:44,471
Yes, sir.

406
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:49,431
What is it?

407
00:36:51,471 --> 00:36:56,090
<i>So why do missionaries keep
taking these reckless trips?</i>

408
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,390
<i>If one dies on a mission...</i>

409
00:36:58,391 --> 00:37:00,840
Don't just stand there.
Call the TV station!

410
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:01,921
Yes, sir!

411
00:37:02,711 --> 00:37:07,510
<i>In fact, they all wrote their wills
before flying to Afghanistan.</i>

412
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:08,890
Yes?

413
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:10,130
<i>This is the Foreign Ministry.</i>

414
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:11,390
Sorry?

415
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:13,970
What you're broadcasting
now is very dangerous.

416
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:15,681
It could provoke the Taliban!

417
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:21,760
How can I control their opinions?
They aren't reading off a script.

418
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:25,010
If something happens to the hostages,
will you take responsibility?

419
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:26,720
Stop the broadcast now!

420
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:30,640
How can I cut off a live broadcast?

421
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:34,800
The Taliban don't understand
Korean, what's the problem?

422
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,210
<i>Sorry, I've got to go.</i>

423
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,041
We're broadcasting.

424
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:44,430
No, go away.

425
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,930
I'm sorry, but everything is settled.

426
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,930
Swindler!

427
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,221
Dae-sik, let's go!

428
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:03,090
What is he saying?

429
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:05,430
He's asking why we lied to them?

430
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:06,561
What?

431
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:15,090
He asked why we told them
they were volunteers...

432
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:16,710
Why are they on TV?

433
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,801
Shit...

434
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:22,000
Listen to me. They're not missionaries.

435
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,951
You've got to insist
they're volunteers, okay?

436
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:27,641
This is unforgivable!

437
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:29,930
Volunteers! Volunteers!

438
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:31,550
They're not volunteers.

439
00:38:31,551 --> 00:38:32,551
Chief!

440
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:34,441
We're not lying!

441
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:46,300
The hostages are currently
held in three groups,

442
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:51,471
with the first eight scheduled
for release tomorrow morning.

443
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:06,011
The press conference will
resume after a 10-minute break.

444
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:11,140
What do you mean we
have to pay the ransom?

445
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,800
<i>The negotiation failed!</i>

446
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:16,220
Every broadcast here
is quoting Korean news,

447
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,891
reporting that the hostages
are missionaries.

448
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:20,930
Is this true?

449
00:39:20,931 --> 00:39:25,091
Al Jazeera is broadcasting the
Korean feed with subtitles.

450
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:30,970
The Afghans will mediate
the ransom payment.

451
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:33,090
<i>Is there no other way?</i>

452
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:37,550
It's the most realistic,
preferable option now.

453
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:40,290
Director Jeong, don't be so inflexible.

454
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:44,221
<i>Why don't you try negotiating
through the Jirga one more time?</i>

455
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:46,761
It's over with the Jirga, Chief!

456
00:39:47,961 --> 00:39:50,960
Minister, you need to decide quickly.

457
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:53,091
<i>We'll discuss it, so just wait.</i>

458
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:55,301
Is that so?

459
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:58,121
Okay, thanks.

460
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:03,590
What is it?

461
00:40:03,591 --> 00:40:05,921
An Asian body has
been found in Musheky.

462
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:08,800
No, that can't be!

463
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:11,550
Wait, what is it now?

464
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:13,460
I have to go home!

465
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:14,751
Let's go check.

466
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:17,311
Shit...

467
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:41,801
These people are from
the Korean government.

468
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:32,301
5 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING

469
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:36,671
For crying out loud...

470
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:44,271
What's this?

471
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:45,961
Wait!

472
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:49,171
Vice Minister!

473
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,381
I found this on a Taliban website.

474
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:58,000
<i>My name is Hong Mi-sook.</i>

475
00:41:58,001 --> 00:42:02,920
<i>I am Korean and I work as a nurse.</i>

476
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:06,341
<i>This is my first time
visiting Afghanistan.</i>

477
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:13,001
<i>Everyone here is kind
and treating us well.</i>

478
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:21,091
<i>We are provided with a great
meal and bed every day.</i>

479
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:28,591
<i>I miss my family.</i>

480
00:42:35,801 --> 00:42:37,420
<i>I strongly urge</i>

481
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:44,460
<i>the Korean government
take more active steps</i>

482
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,421
<i>to save its people.</i>

483
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:52,000
What did he say?

484
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:54,001
He said they never asked for money.

485
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:04,371
The only way for the Korean hostages to go
home is the release of Taliban prisoners.

486
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:18,250
We warn the Korean government.

487
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:22,620
Persuade the Afghan government to
release Taliban prisoners within 24 hours

488
00:43:22,621 --> 00:43:25,041
or we will kill more hostages.

489
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:33,670
Mr. Negotiator, now what?

490
00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:36,501
All right, don't panic.

491
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:40,200
The Taliban want us to panic.

492
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,340
How can I not panic right now?

493
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:47,090
Just give me a chance to think!

494
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,841
Think?

495
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,590
People are dying while you think!

496
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:54,460
Watch your mouth!

497
00:43:54,461 --> 00:43:55,800
Have you gone mad?

498
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:57,630
Hey, stop it!

499
00:43:57,631 --> 00:43:59,551
What are you doing?

500
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:21,431
- One more.
- Sure.

501
00:44:25,531 --> 00:44:28,581
Neither America, nor President Karzai

502
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:32,661
will ever hand over the prisoners.

503
00:44:36,621 --> 00:44:38,281
There's only one way.

504
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:41,950
Direct negotiation.

505
00:44:41,951 --> 00:44:44,060
Never.

506
00:44:44,061 --> 00:44:47,211
That's absolutely ridiculous.

507
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:49,491
Why?

508
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:52,661
Are you afraid to meet the Taliban?

509
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:56,331
It figures...

510
00:44:58,331 --> 00:45:01,581
The dweeb who spends his
life in an air-conditioned office

511
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:06,081
would pee his pants when
meeting the Taliban.

512
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:13,950
Do you know what it means to sit
at the same table as the Taliban?

513
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:17,370
There is a Maginot line that
can't be crossed in diplomacy.

514
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:21,740
The moment a diplomat sits
face to face with the Taliban,

515
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:26,780
South Korea becomes a country
that surrendered to terrorists.

516
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:29,371
It would be a crushing diplomatic loss!

517
00:45:31,701 --> 00:45:33,121
Diplomacy...

518
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:34,991
Mr. Diplomat,

519
00:45:36,831 --> 00:45:38,451
you can eat this.

520
00:45:47,241 --> 00:45:50,121
Then send me. I'll go.

521
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:55,951
Why? You want to make up
for what happened in Iraq?

522
00:46:01,151 --> 00:46:05,281
You think I do this for myself?

523
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:15,740
Here's some personal advice.

524
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:18,200
Just go back to Korea.

525
00:46:18,201 --> 00:46:21,580
Staying stuck in the past,
roaming around this place

526
00:46:21,581 --> 00:46:24,201
that would drive anyone crazy.

527
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:57,431
Save me!

528
00:47:00,161 --> 00:47:02,991
Please save me...

529
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:08,240
It's all my fault...

530
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:11,370
Watch, and then tell your government!

531
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,621
I want to go home!

532
00:47:14,781 --> 00:47:15,781
No...

533
00:47:56,701 --> 00:47:59,771
Are you Mr. Park from South
Korea Intelligence Service?

534
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:13,490
Let me get this straight.

535
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:18,440
So that broker persuaded the Taliban
to change their list of prisoners,

536
00:48:18,441 --> 00:48:22,581
and we'll be able to get
those inmates released?

537
00:48:22,731 --> 00:48:25,471
Yes, how many times
do I have to tell you?

538
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:29,730
Abdullah is no simple broker.

539
00:48:29,731 --> 00:48:33,830
He's a British businessman who
dealt with the Taliban before the war,

540
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:36,580
and has intervened in such
kidnappings countless times.

541
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,580
How do we get those
inmates out of prison?

542
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:39,851
An inside job.

543
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:44,791
How is that possible, especially
with the U.S. military against it?

544
00:48:44,851 --> 00:48:46,781
Since it's in Ghazni, it's possible.

545
00:48:47,161 --> 00:48:50,360
The central government has
less control over that region.

546
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:52,370
Jailbreaks happen often.

547
00:48:52,371 --> 00:48:54,120
How much does he want?

548
00:48:54,121 --> 00:48:55,450
Two million dollars.

549
00:48:55,451 --> 00:48:56,451
What?

550
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:10,180
Mr. Abdullah, until now, the Taliban
demanded we release 23 prisoners.

551
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,641
Now suddenly, they changed the list?

552
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:15,150
I don't understand.

553
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:18,480
The Taliban also feel uncomfortable
about these killings.

554
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:22,450
As the clock is ticking, they are
having internal disagreements.

555
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:25,491
If given the chance,
they prefer to negotiate.

556
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:30,211
You are not Afghan. Why get involved?

557
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:34,280
As someone who understands the Afghans,

558
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:37,911
I truly want these Koreans
to go back to their families.

559
00:49:51,711 --> 00:49:53,530
No trust.

560
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:55,240
No deal.

561
00:49:55,241 --> 00:49:56,941
I'm wasting my time here.

562
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,691
Just a moment, please.

563
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:07,750
What's the problem?

564
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:09,170
He's settled kidnapping cases?

565
00:50:09,171 --> 00:50:11,621
Then let's check with
the British government.

566
00:50:11,671 --> 00:50:14,960
Everyone working here has
fake names and nationalities.

567
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:17,210
A background check will take too long.

568
00:50:17,211 --> 00:50:19,751
We have to go with our gut feeling.

569
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:23,590
Please decide quickly.

570
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:25,920
There's no time to sit and think.

571
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:27,920
We need to properly check first!

572
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:31,000
What if there's another victim?
Will you take the blame?

573
00:50:31,001 --> 00:50:34,590
If she's ready, put her on the phone.

574
00:50:34,591 --> 00:50:35,741
<i>Hello?</i>

575
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:37,871
Will this buy your trust?

576
00:50:39,971 --> 00:50:41,141
Two minutes.

577
00:50:43,461 --> 00:50:44,461
<i>Hello?</i>

578
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:49,460
This is the Vice Foreign
Minister. What's your name?

579
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:52,960
<i>I am Hong Mi-sook. Please help me!</i>

580
00:50:52,961 --> 00:50:56,290
Yes, please stay calm.
I'll ask you a few questions.

581
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:58,340
How many are with you now?

582
00:50:58,341 --> 00:51:01,130
<i>There are seven of us here.</i>

583
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:03,920
How many Taliban guards?

584
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:05,460
<i>Three?</i>

585
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:07,500
How's everyone's health?

586
00:51:07,501 --> 00:51:11,750
<i>Not good, especially Hye-young,
she's not eating at all.</i>

587
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:15,090
Where do you think you are now?
Any recognizable terrain?

588
00:51:15,091 --> 00:51:19,671
<i>I don't know. They
keep moving us at night.</i>

589
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:24,170
<i>Wait!</i>

590
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:27,791
<i>Please just tell my family this.</i>

591
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:33,290
<i>I'm sorry, and I love
them. Just tell them that...</i>

592
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:37,381
Ms. Hong! Don't worry, you'll
be able to tell them yourself.

593
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:45,961
So?

594
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:48,181
Now what?

595
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:07,540
<i>One hundred dollar bills. No consecutive
serial numbers. Put them in two bags.</i>

596
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,991
Mix them up.

597
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:32,291
Dae-sik, there's 100 here.

598
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:39,901
<i>As soon as we get the money,
you get the prisoners.</i>

599
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:43,671
4 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

600
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,501
Team A has arrived.

601
00:52:56,751 --> 00:52:59,250
GHAZNI CENTRAL PRISON

602
00:52:59,251 --> 00:53:01,130
Team B ready.

603
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:04,041
Everyone stay alert, and
let's finish this quickly.

604
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:14,801
Where is Abdullah?

605
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:56,081
Where's the money?

606
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:07,031
Salaam!

607
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,871
Now, release the prisoners.

608
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:14,691
Should we count the money first?

609
00:54:16,901 --> 00:54:19,611
The prisoners first.

610
00:54:21,831 --> 00:54:23,091
Very well.

611
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:31,231
It's me.

612
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,221
Release the prisoners.

613
00:54:45,531 --> 00:54:48,411
Yes, Vice Minister.
We counted 23 of them.

614
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:50,481
It's done.

615
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:06,901
This heat is killing me!

616
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:16,110
What the...?

617
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:18,230
What is it? What's wrong?

618
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,231
Vice Minister, look at this.

619
00:55:21,021 --> 00:55:24,940
Director Jeong asked me to
dig up more info on Abdullah.

620
00:55:24,941 --> 00:55:27,320
This is from the
British Foreign Ministry,

621
00:55:27,321 --> 00:55:29,190
and it seems he's a fake.

622
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:31,480
Abdullah, real name Peter Merchant.

623
00:55:31,481 --> 00:55:33,281
It says he died in Kuwait last year.

624
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,130
Take the prisoners to this place.

625
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:37,861
The Korean hostages will be there.

626
00:55:38,891 --> 00:55:40,711
May God be with you.

627
00:55:47,201 --> 00:55:48,571
Just a moment.

628
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:54,280
Director Jeong! Don't
give him the money!

629
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:55,101
What?

630
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,101
He's a fraud!

631
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:00,971
Hands up.

632
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:33,821
Put it down.

633
00:56:36,981 --> 00:56:38,440
Are you okay?

634
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:39,790
I'm okay.

635
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:41,331
Put it down!

636
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:00,390
No, don't go!

637
00:57:00,391 --> 00:57:01,520
Don't follow them!

638
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:02,521
No!

639
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:12,191
Shit...

640
00:57:43,981 --> 00:57:44,981
Sorry.

641
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:36,401
Take him out, quick!

642
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:57,340
Hey!

643
00:59:57,341 --> 01:00:01,460
Investigate whether that
NIS nut was in on this fraud!

644
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:03,631
Find out how much he got paid!

645
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:09,960
You should've checked if the Taliban
got paid for allowing that call!

646
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:12,751
You think you're here on vacation?

647
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:22,960
You bastard. You won't
get away with this!

648
01:00:22,961 --> 01:00:24,880
You're out to ruin us, aren't you?

649
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:28,091
Please stop, sir.
He's doing all he can.

650
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:47,921
It's a Taliban general.

651
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:50,541
Hussein.

652
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:58,901
He wants to suggest something very
important to the Korean government now.

653
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:10,420
"Transfer $100,000 to the foreign
account by this afternoon.

654
01:01:10,421 --> 01:01:12,670
Then we'll release 30 Koreans."

655
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:15,130
He's saying he'll release 30 Koreans.

656
01:01:15,131 --> 01:01:16,711
30?

657
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:19,631
Not 23, but 30?

658
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:27,380
Fake Taliban, petty crime
inmates, a fraud broker...

659
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:29,251
Damn!

660
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:40,481
Hello?

661
01:01:45,641 --> 01:01:48,770
This time, he says he's
the Taliban commander.

662
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,950
He said the deadline
has already passed.

663
01:01:50,951 --> 01:01:54,090
First he's a general,
now he's a commander?

664
01:01:54,091 --> 01:01:55,960
Translate this word for word!

665
01:01:55,961 --> 01:01:58,541
If he calls one more time,
he won't get away with it!

666
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:06,341
<i>My name is Park Sung-jin.</i>

667
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:10,000
<i>Born August 1973.</i>

668
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:13,171
<i>I live in Ojeong-dong, Bucheon.</i>

669
01:02:15,711 --> 01:02:18,021
Mr. Park Sung-jin!

670
01:02:21,411 --> 01:02:24,290
Tell him it's a misunderstanding.
We need more time!

671
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:25,491
Translate now!

672
01:02:28,591 --> 01:02:30,920
<i>Please meet these people's demands!</i>

673
01:02:30,921 --> 01:02:32,591
<i>Then we can live.</i>

674
01:02:35,241 --> 01:02:36,790
<i>Please save me!</i>

675
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:40,780
Whatever it takes, we will find
a way to release the prisoners!

676
01:02:40,781 --> 01:02:42,031
Hurry!

677
01:02:49,621 --> 01:02:52,290
We gave enough time,
but you kept wasting time.

678
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:53,910
Hurry and tell them!

679
01:02:53,911 --> 01:02:57,950
<i>I want to live! Please save me!</i>

680
01:02:57,951 --> 01:03:01,711
Mr. Park, say "Nanawatai".

681
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:06,041
Protection! Fairness! Mercy
of the Pashtun people!

682
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:11,001
<i>- Allah is the Greatest!</i>
- No!

683
01:03:18,851 --> 01:03:22,080
Next time, bring me the right answer.

684
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:24,241
The next deadline is
tomorrow at 4 o'clock.

685
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:38,241
Welcome, Minister. I'm
Secretary Cha Min-yong.

686
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:48,881
I'm ashamed to make you
come so far, Minister.

687
01:03:50,431 --> 01:03:54,160
<i>The Taliban have warned the Korean government
that there will be further killings.</i>

688
01:03:54,161 --> 01:03:57,090
<i>In response, the Foreign
Affairs minister</i>

689
01:03:57,091 --> 01:04:00,540
<i>has made a visit to the
Afghan President Karzai.</i>

690
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:05,120
<i>Will the Korean government's new negotiation
strategy be able to satisfy the Taliban</i>

691
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:08,580
<i>without causing any friction to
the South Korean-Afghan relations,</i>

692
01:04:08,581 --> 01:04:12,481
<i>and effectively prevent the
Taliban from further killings?</i>

693
01:04:51,411 --> 01:04:54,181
Yes?

694
01:04:57,001 --> 01:04:58,710
What happened?

695
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:00,711
They launched a military operation!

696
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:05,591
What are you talking about?

697
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:09,380
<i>The military have mobilised in Ghazni,</i>

698
01:05:09,381 --> 01:05:14,290
<i>and there are concerns that the joint
military exercise will provoke the Taliban...</i>

699
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:18,041
So this is the plan
the Minister brought?

700
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,500
Vice Minister.

701
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:30,000
Is it true that we're launching
a military operation?

702
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:31,541
Just a normal operation.

703
01:05:33,031 --> 01:05:36,351
This is a sensitive time,
it can provoke the Taliban!

704
01:05:36,441 --> 01:05:38,021
We need to stop this right now!

705
01:05:38,191 --> 01:05:41,591
How can we stop soldiers from
training on the battlefield?

706
01:05:41,721 --> 01:05:42,920
It's not...

707
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:45,011
We're preparing for the worst.

708
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:49,130
If they kill any more hostages,

709
01:05:49,131 --> 01:05:51,120
there will be a rescue operation.

710
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:56,170
Minister, the U.S. military's attacks
in that area have failed for years!

711
01:05:56,171 --> 01:06:00,801
So should we just sit back
and watch the hostages die?

712
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:03,871
We're not done negotiating yet.

713
01:06:03,951 --> 01:06:08,300
President Karzai gave a final
refusal to release the prisoners.

714
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:09,550
What?

715
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:14,260
Director Jeong, start packing.

716
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:17,380
You've done enough.
Your work is done here.

717
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:19,971
- Minster!
- I'll take care of it, so go home.

718
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:26,970
Then what will happen to the captives?

719
01:06:26,971 --> 01:06:29,801
Minister! The U.S. Army
commander is on the line.

720
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:50,881
What did he say?

721
01:06:55,921 --> 01:06:58,091
How did it go?

722
01:07:00,381 --> 01:07:02,511
I've been ordered home.

723
01:07:02,721 --> 01:07:03,721
What?

724
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:10,271
So you're just going to walk away?

725
01:07:11,721 --> 01:07:13,181
And the captives?

726
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:16,970
You're going to let them die?

727
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:19,991
Hey!

728
01:07:28,221 --> 01:07:32,840
I feel bad seeing you leave after
all the trouble you went through.

729
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:36,020
I'll come visit you when
I'm back in Seoul.

730
01:07:36,021 --> 01:07:37,721
Thank you for your efforts.

731
01:07:41,271 --> 01:07:42,271
Great work.

732
01:07:44,201 --> 01:07:46,031
<i>Let's hear what they have to say.</i>

733
01:07:47,281 --> 01:07:50,701
<i>Hong Mi-sook is my wife and
a mother of two children.</i>

734
01:07:51,971 --> 01:07:55,471
<i>Please bring her back safely.</i>

735
01:07:56,761 --> 01:08:00,461
<i>Please help my wife Hong Mi-sook</i>

736
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,621
<i>to return home safely. Please!</i>

737
01:08:06,601 --> 01:08:10,391
<i>Honey, you must be so tired.</i>

738
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:13,891
Hold on.

739
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:24,060
Hello? This is Jeong
Jae-ho from Afghanistan.

740
01:08:24,061 --> 01:08:25,930
I'd like to speak to the
Chief Presidential Secretary.

741
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:30,020
<i>He's in a meeting now,
so if you tell me...</i>

742
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:32,310
This is a very urgent matter,
so please connect me.

743
01:08:32,311 --> 01:08:34,680
<i>He can't answer the phone right now.</i>

744
01:08:34,681 --> 01:08:37,680
If I don't talk to him
now, you'll regret it!

745
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:41,801
Director of Foreign Ministry? So what?

746
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:44,560
Director Jeong, what is it?

747
01:08:44,561 --> 01:08:46,021
Mr. Secretary.

748
01:08:49,471 --> 01:08:52,060
Let me negotiate
face-to-face with the Taliban.

749
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:53,770
I'll try to persuade them myself.

750
01:08:53,771 --> 01:08:56,141
Did they change their conditions?

751
01:08:57,391 --> 01:09:03,771
No, but face-to-face negotiations
are our last chance now.

752
01:09:07,471 --> 01:09:10,100
I know how you feel,

753
01:09:10,101 --> 01:09:13,681
<i>but Minister Choi is there
now, so follow his orders.</i>

754
01:09:24,311 --> 01:09:27,221
Director, you'll be
late for your flight.

755
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:15,420
Hello! This is Jeong Jae-ho!

756
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:17,131
<i>This is the President.</i>

757
01:10:18,061 --> 01:10:21,311
<i>You really think there's a chance?</i>

758
01:10:22,391 --> 01:10:27,891
<i>Everyone says it's
impossible. Is it possible?</i>

759
01:10:30,011 --> 01:10:32,641
It's a long shot.

760
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:36,940
But Mr. President, I can't give up.

761
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:40,340
<i>I'm told we can't
guarantee your safety.</i>

762
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:43,350
<i>Will you still go?</i>

763
01:10:43,351 --> 01:10:44,351
Yes.

764
01:10:45,311 --> 01:10:47,271
<i>You can come back alive?</i>

765
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:50,521
I'll try my best.

766
01:10:59,351 --> 01:11:01,480
My fellow Koreans.

767
01:11:01,481 --> 01:11:05,940
1 HOUR BEFORE DEADLINE
You must be anxious at the news of a second victim

768
01:11:05,941 --> 01:11:12,770
among our people kidnapped
by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

769
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:18,600
<i>I emphasize, we are willing
to use any means possible</i>

770
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:23,310
<i>to ensure the prompt and
safe return of our citizens.</i>

771
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:26,441
Director Jeong, do you
know what you've done?

772
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:33,141
Our president just sent an open invitation
to negotiate with the terrorists!

773
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:37,371
You know better than anyone what
a stain this is on our diplomacy!

774
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:44,120
As far as I know, our first
duty is to protect our citizens.

775
01:11:44,121 --> 01:11:47,951
If I am mistaken, please tell me.

776
01:11:49,951 --> 01:11:52,290
We have a message from the Taliban.

777
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:54,240
The hostages are safe,

778
01:11:54,241 --> 01:11:56,661
and if we send a team,
they'll negotiate with us.

779
01:11:59,741 --> 01:12:04,450
The expected point of contact is near
Mijan, northeast of Kandahar Province.

780
01:12:04,451 --> 01:12:08,410
The U.S. military will provide
protection up to the meeting spot.

781
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:10,240
It's said they want

782
01:12:10,241 --> 01:12:14,330
$1M for a US prisoner, and $1.5M
for an Italian photographer.

783
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,370
We've got a lot of people.

784
01:12:16,371 --> 01:12:18,451
This is highly confidential.

785
01:12:22,465 --> 01:12:23,136
Thank you so much.

786
01:12:23,161 --> 01:12:24,411
KIDNAPPING LOCATION

787
01:12:25,331 --> 01:12:27,080
How many vehicles for that day?

788
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:29,331
- Two cars, eight in total.
- Okay.

789
01:12:38,331 --> 01:12:40,120
Javeed Nurul Haq.

790
01:12:40,121 --> 01:12:43,161
Considered a top-level terrorist
even among the Taliban.

791
01:12:49,951 --> 01:12:53,581
It's a group that the
CIA are keen to capture.

792
01:12:55,491 --> 01:12:58,870
This is quite terrible.

793
01:12:58,871 --> 01:13:02,241
He's a notorious figure
even among the Taliban.

794
01:13:03,741 --> 01:13:05,491
Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim?

795
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:09,081
- Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim?
- I'm here!

796
01:13:15,411 --> 01:13:17,950
Dae-sik!

797
01:13:17,951 --> 01:13:18,951
Move!

798
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:22,660
Dae-sik, buddy!

799
01:13:22,661 --> 01:13:24,701
Can you please get me out of here?

800
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:30,120
No wonder I couldn't reach you.

801
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:32,200
You couldn't stay out of trouble?

802
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:34,621
It was a misunderstanding.

803
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,080
Should I give you a chance to get out?

804
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:41,160
Please. As a fellow Korean, please?

805
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:44,291
- Then translate for me.
- Of course, whatever you...

806
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:46,951
Where are we going?

807
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:49,831
- To the Taliban.
- The Taliban?

808
01:13:54,451 --> 01:13:56,910
Have a safe trip. I'll just stay here.

809
01:13:56,911 --> 01:13:58,490
It's to save people.

810
01:13:58,491 --> 01:14:02,200
I should risk my life to save theirs?

811
01:14:02,201 --> 01:14:04,620
What nonsense. Bye!

812
01:14:04,621 --> 01:14:07,160
It's probably better
than getting flogged.

813
01:14:07,161 --> 01:14:08,540
Flogged?

814
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:11,960
Gambling, drinking, swindling.

815
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:13,801
You did the full set.

816
01:14:14,611 --> 01:14:19,120
Under Sharia law, you'll get
whipped dozens of times.

817
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,581
Can you take that?

818
01:14:22,951 --> 01:14:25,451
It hurts. It already hurts.

819
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:28,791
Let's talk outside.

820
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:32,541
10 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING

821
01:14:47,311 --> 01:14:49,141
Are you ready?

822
01:14:55,021 --> 01:14:56,560
What?

823
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:58,231
You being nice is awkward.

824
01:14:59,271 --> 01:15:01,351
Since I may never see you again.

825
01:15:04,391 --> 01:15:05,731
It's a joke.

826
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:10,020
You know how to joke?

827
01:15:10,021 --> 01:15:12,481
Why aren't you wearing this?

828
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:17,571
They'll think I'm scared. I won't
give them the upper hand.

829
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:28,251
Pride won't protect you from bullets.

830
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:34,851
Thanks.

831
01:15:43,731 --> 01:15:45,941
No bathroom breaks
during the negotiation.

832
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:52,121
I can't even drink water?

833
01:17:00,891 --> 01:17:02,311
They're coming.

834
01:17:13,231 --> 01:17:15,270
I heard you were a church deacon.

835
01:17:15,271 --> 01:17:17,560
Why does that matter
when I'm facing death?

836
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:20,231
I'll pray to the local god.

837
01:17:36,101 --> 01:17:37,331
What is he saying?

838
01:17:39,191 --> 01:17:40,191
Go on.

839
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:42,390
Huh?

840
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:43,391
Go.

841
01:17:44,191 --> 01:17:45,191
Me?

842
01:17:46,771 --> 01:17:51,481
Why'd they have to come here
and cause so much trouble?

843
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:00,231
Will you be okay?

844
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:03,811
With what?

845
01:18:05,021 --> 01:18:07,640
Not calling your family.

846
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:11,841
Wow, you really must
have wiretapped us.

847
01:18:17,521 --> 01:18:20,021
You know who I envy the most?

848
01:18:23,311 --> 01:18:25,771
Someone with a place to go back to.

849
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:38,101
They said only the negotiator
and interpreter can come.

850
01:18:40,691 --> 01:18:44,231
I don't think I need this.

851
01:18:46,731 --> 01:18:48,191
Let's go.

852
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,141
Wait.

853
01:18:59,941 --> 01:19:02,691
Pop this with your molars in one bite.

854
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:14,851
Hey.

855
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:18,141
I'm good.

856
01:20:24,561 --> 01:20:26,440
Hey! Where are we going?

857
01:20:26,441 --> 01:20:28,190
Shut up.

858
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:29,941
Where are we going?

859
01:20:40,691 --> 01:20:42,691
Director, how far are we going?

860
01:21:13,601 --> 01:21:19,100
I am Jeong Jae-ho, the negotiator
representing the Korea government.

861
01:21:19,101 --> 01:21:22,481
I'm here to negotiate
the hostage issue.

862
01:21:36,891 --> 01:21:38,521
He says it's nice to meet you.

863
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:50,061
He asks if you brought the answer.

864
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:57,441
What are you doing? These
people are quick-tempered.

865
01:21:58,951 --> 01:22:03,161
First, ask them to show us
the condition of the Koreans.

866
01:22:09,701 --> 01:22:11,911
- Bring the monitor.
- Yes.

867
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:31,360
He says now that you've
checked, let's start talking.

868
01:22:31,361 --> 01:22:34,781
- There's one more thing.
- What is it now?

869
01:22:40,991 --> 01:22:43,410
As I'm here on behalf of
the Korean government,

870
01:22:43,411 --> 01:22:47,111
you should prove you are
the leader of this negotiation.

871
01:23:00,031 --> 01:23:02,071
This guy is a bit particular.

872
01:23:07,911 --> 01:23:10,781
What can he do to make you believe him?

873
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:16,410
Tell him to release three
of the hostages first.

874
01:23:16,411 --> 01:23:18,411
- What?
- Translate, now!

875
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:20,861
Dammit, this...

876
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:31,991
He says you're tricking them!

877
01:23:34,201 --> 01:23:38,531
If you let them go now, Muslims all
over the world will be proud of you.

878
01:23:58,201 --> 01:24:00,570
He said he'll let two go.

879
01:24:00,571 --> 01:24:02,161
That it's a gift from Allah.

880
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:27,510
Hold on. We have to
check for explosives.

881
01:24:27,511 --> 01:24:28,810
What the hell are you saying?

882
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:29,851
Over here!

883
01:24:35,451 --> 01:24:37,991
Oh, god!

884
01:24:38,821 --> 01:24:41,611
Ms. Kim Hye-young? Ms. Kim?

885
01:24:43,691 --> 01:24:45,140
Come here.

886
01:24:45,141 --> 01:24:46,451
Come here!

887
01:24:49,071 --> 01:24:50,071
Hello?

888
01:24:50,072 --> 01:24:51,491
<i>How did it go?</i>

889
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:55,280
Kim Hye-young and Lee
Jin-hee are safe with us.

890
01:24:55,281 --> 01:24:56,481
<i>Okay.</i>

891
01:25:04,741 --> 01:25:06,611
He says it's our turn.

892
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:13,121
What are you doing?

893
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:16,531
Come on, say something!

894
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,321
There will be no release of prisoners.

895
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:29,360
What?

896
01:25:29,361 --> 01:25:30,860
You said you brought the answer.

897
01:25:30,861 --> 01:25:32,860
This is our answer.

898
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:35,821
If he wants to proceed, tell
him to change the conditions.

899
01:25:37,161 --> 01:25:39,160
I can't. We'll die if I say that.

900
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:41,530
What did he say? Tell us now!

901
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:43,591
Okay, I'll tell you.

902
01:25:51,161 --> 01:25:53,911
This will only weaken
your bargaining power!

903
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:13,911
He said he'll do the
negotiation his way.

904
01:26:19,201 --> 01:26:21,761
He told them to kill that woman.

905
01:26:26,531 --> 01:26:28,501
Sir, won't you do something?

906
01:26:47,451 --> 01:26:48,451
Stop!

907
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:52,741
Wait.

908
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:04,081
I will ask our government.

909
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:27,410
<i>They're changing their conditions.</i>

910
01:27:27,411 --> 01:27:34,701
He said to free all Taliban
prisoners by midnight tonight.

911
01:27:36,661 --> 01:27:39,820
Let me confirm that.

912
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:44,200
All of the Taliban prisoners?

913
01:27:44,201 --> 01:27:45,431
<i>That's correct.</i>

914
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:47,661
If we don't,

915
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:51,661
they'll kill a hostage

916
01:27:52,951 --> 01:27:54,371
every hour.

917
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:57,581
300 prisoners?

918
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:02,951
They had no intention of
negotiating in the first place.

919
01:28:05,131 --> 01:28:06,851
Let's go to Bagram Air Base.

920
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:10,580
Please wait a little longer!

921
01:28:10,581 --> 01:28:12,620
Who do you think you are?

922
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:15,120
We sent Jeong Jae-ho as our negotiator!

923
01:28:15,121 --> 01:28:18,500
Shouldn't we give him
that slim chance and wait?

924
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:21,661
If we start bombing now, the
negotiator is in most danger.

925
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:39,121
I think it's time, why
aren't they calling?

926
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:44,911
They won't.

927
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:48,871
Why? Wait a minute...

928
01:28:54,691 --> 01:28:58,700
They said the Korean government broke off
the negotiation. What'll happen to us?

929
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:01,241
We never should have
given them a chance!

930
01:29:02,201 --> 01:29:03,581
You tricked us.

931
01:29:06,831 --> 01:29:07,831
No!

932
01:29:15,491 --> 01:29:18,200
The Allies have launched
a military campaign.

933
01:29:18,201 --> 01:29:19,911
What?

934
01:29:34,121 --> 01:29:35,330
He said to stop lying.

935
01:29:35,331 --> 01:29:39,001
They've got 21 hostages, so the Allies
can't carry out a rescue operation.

936
01:29:41,661 --> 01:29:44,540
Why did he say 21? Two
got released, it should be 19...

937
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:47,161
This isn't a rescue operation,
this is a mop-up operation!

938
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:58,951
The U.S. and Afghan forces just
needed an excuse to level this place.

939
01:30:01,581 --> 01:30:02,870
When the operation starts,

940
01:30:02,871 --> 01:30:08,201
the hostages, you and your
men, and us too will all die!

941
01:30:10,121 --> 01:30:14,831
Are a few of your men more
important than saving many lives?

942
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:24,391
You yourself provided the excuse
for this bombing. Know that!

943
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:38,931
I know what you are thinking.

944
01:30:40,111 --> 01:30:43,400
You come here to save those people.

945
01:30:43,401 --> 01:30:46,121
You don't just let them be killed.

946
01:30:47,521 --> 01:30:50,171
Tell your government
to stop the attack.

947
01:30:54,011 --> 01:30:55,460
We don't have the power.

948
01:30:55,461 --> 01:30:57,150
Koreans aren't our guests.

949
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,330
You sent the troops here!

950
01:30:59,331 --> 01:31:01,840
You are an extremely rich country.

951
01:31:01,841 --> 01:31:03,631
You can do whatever you want.

952
01:31:07,311 --> 01:31:09,400
You may be a good commander,

953
01:31:09,401 --> 01:31:12,981
but you are nothing as a negotiator.

954
01:31:13,981 --> 01:31:15,931
You know your biggest mistake?

955
01:31:17,451 --> 01:31:19,301
You overestimated us.

956
01:31:36,911 --> 01:31:38,990
Allah is the only god.

957
01:31:38,991 --> 01:31:42,241
Muhammad... Muhammad
is the only prophet.

958
01:32:02,401 --> 01:32:05,360
It's the price of breaking
down this deal.

959
01:32:05,361 --> 01:32:07,701
I will send you the hell first!

960
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:15,320
The only way to stop the bombing
is to tell them we have a deal.

961
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:17,630
We are not afraid of American missiles!

962
01:32:17,631 --> 01:32:18,980
Time is on our side.

963
01:32:18,981 --> 01:32:20,340
So is Allah.

964
01:32:20,341 --> 01:32:23,100
Eventually, we are
going to win this war.

965
01:32:23,101 --> 01:32:25,280
Why take things so far?

966
01:32:25,281 --> 01:32:26,900
You know better than anyone,

967
01:32:26,901 --> 01:32:29,201
the prisoner exchange is impossible!

968
01:32:29,851 --> 01:32:31,321
Why do you think?

969
01:32:34,761 --> 01:32:35,821
Money.

970
01:32:36,911 --> 01:32:39,251
Money? You have insulted us!

971
01:32:42,741 --> 01:32:43,741
Take him out!

972
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:47,931
Take him too!

973
01:32:49,451 --> 01:32:53,951
He told them to take me
too! Director, what do I do?

974
01:33:00,661 --> 01:33:02,371
These American bastards!

975
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:04,491
Allah is the Greatest!

976
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:32,221
50 million.

977
01:33:39,341 --> 01:33:40,411
40.

978
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:43,601
20.

979
01:34:06,071 --> 01:34:10,001
Remember, Afghanistan
is the graveyard of empires.

980
01:34:14,421 --> 01:34:16,520
Send all the troops home.

981
01:34:16,521 --> 01:34:19,921
Make all Koreans leave
Afghanistan in a month, for good.

982
01:34:21,321 --> 01:34:22,411
Okay?

983
01:34:26,131 --> 01:34:27,260
Okay.

984
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:29,610
Never set your foot
again in this country,

985
01:34:29,611 --> 01:34:30,691
Korean.

986
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:02,660
Hello?

987
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:04,510
The negotiation is done.

988
01:35:04,511 --> 01:35:06,700
They'll release all the hostages.

989
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,571
Call the Americans.

990
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:10,741
Good work!

991
01:35:14,521 --> 01:35:15,771
Director Jeong?

992
01:35:17,831 --> 01:35:20,501
<i>Nice work everyone.
We've reached a deal!</i>

993
01:35:37,991 --> 01:35:41,161
You can go back to Korea now.

994
01:35:45,661 --> 01:35:46,661
Thank you.

995
01:36:18,771 --> 01:36:21,571
I take back my comment
on you being a dweeb.

996
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:27,690
Great work.

997
01:36:27,691 --> 01:36:29,950
No, thank you.

998
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:34,201
I really wouldn't have been
able to do it without you.

999
01:36:39,531 --> 01:36:40,661
What's this?

1000
01:36:44,851 --> 01:36:46,780
They said one has to stay behind.

1001
01:36:46,781 --> 01:36:49,700
What are they talking about?

1002
01:36:49,701 --> 01:36:53,360
They guaranteed our safety up to here,

1003
01:36:53,361 --> 01:36:55,440
so they want to
ensure their safety too.

1004
01:36:55,441 --> 01:36:57,471
We're done negotiating, what is this?

1005
01:37:00,651 --> 01:37:04,021
He said if we don't do
it, no one can leave here.

1006
01:37:15,981 --> 01:37:20,191
I'm the representative of
this negotiation, so I'll stay.

1007
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:35,231
Then as the person in charge,
lead them safely back to Korea.

1008
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:39,231
It's my turn now.

1009
01:37:44,311 --> 01:37:48,191
Don't worry. My luck is good.

1010
01:37:53,731 --> 01:37:54,931
I will stay.

1011
01:37:56,731 --> 01:37:58,101
Let him go.

1012
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:04,981
Get it together!

1013
01:38:06,351 --> 01:38:07,941
Be sure to see the director off.

1014
01:38:09,271 --> 01:38:11,901
You did well, Lee Bong-han. Go.

1015
01:38:16,241 --> 01:38:18,361
Take care of yourself, brother.

1016
01:39:18,531 --> 01:39:22,820
"If I break this agreement and disclose
anything about my work here,

1017
01:39:22,821 --> 01:39:25,531
I agree to be punished
according to the law..."

1018
01:39:26,881 --> 01:39:28,381
Pretty straightforward, right?

1019
01:39:39,561 --> 01:39:40,561
Thank you.

1020
01:39:46,401 --> 01:39:51,031
We work ourselves to death,
and are left with nothing.

1021
01:39:53,651 --> 01:39:56,620
21 people came back alive.

1022
01:39:56,621 --> 01:39:57,741
That's true.

1023
01:40:03,871 --> 01:40:09,330
<i>The 21 former hostages abducted
in Afghanistan on September 19</i>

1024
01:40:09,331 --> 01:40:11,880
<i>have just landed at
Incheon Int'I Airport.</i>

1025
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:14,670
<i>The safety of one anonymous team member</i>

1026
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:20,000
<i>who remained with the Taliban after
the deal has also been confirmed.</i>

1027
01:40:20,001 --> 01:40:26,331
<i>This marks an end to the largest
hostage crisis in Korea's history.</i>

1028
01:40:31,211 --> 01:40:33,671
3 MONTHS LATER

1029
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:38,000
The Minister's at the press conference,
but we still haven't figured it out?

1030
01:40:38,001 --> 01:40:40,881
What do you even do? Find out now!

1031
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:45,580
Hello, who is this?

1032
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:48,790
<i>You didn't go to Washington?</i>

1033
01:40:48,791 --> 01:40:50,341
<i>Or maybe you couldn't?</i>

1034
01:40:51,581 --> 01:40:53,041
Park Dae-sik?

1035
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:56,250
You son of a...

1036
01:40:56,251 --> 01:40:58,831
So quick to swear at me!

1037
01:40:59,051 --> 01:41:00,550
<i>Where are you now?</i>

1038
01:41:00,551 --> 01:41:02,800
Why didn't you call?

1039
01:41:02,801 --> 01:41:05,720
You know how worried
I was? You weren't hurt?

1040
01:41:05,721 --> 01:41:08,391
I told you. My luck is good.

1041
01:41:09,851 --> 01:41:12,350
Is that Director Jeong? Me, me!

1042
01:41:12,351 --> 01:41:16,090
Hold on, someone wants to say hi.

1043
01:41:16,091 --> 01:41:17,390
<i>Huh?</i>

1044
01:41:17,391 --> 01:41:19,050
Director Jeong...

1045
01:41:19,051 --> 01:41:20,930
Salaam! Have you been well?

1046
01:41:20,931 --> 01:41:23,470
Oh, Qasim! Lee Bong-han!

1047
01:41:23,471 --> 01:41:27,250
There must really be no one there.
Working with Qasim again?

1048
01:41:27,251 --> 01:41:31,001
Last time in Afghanistan, I
don't think I got fully paid...

1049
01:41:32,101 --> 01:41:33,101
You little...

1050
01:41:33,801 --> 01:41:36,171
Director Jeong, come quickly.

1051
01:41:37,471 --> 01:41:41,510
Anyway, take care of yourselves.
Let's get in touch soon.

1052
01:41:41,511 --> 01:41:43,180
<i>Take care and...</i>

1053
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:47,261
I won't say see you later. Don't
want to get into another mess.

1054
01:41:52,801 --> 01:41:53,971
Park Dae-sik.

1055
01:41:55,671 --> 01:41:58,890
Everyone has a place to go back to.

1056
01:41:58,891 --> 01:41:59,931
You know, right?

1057
01:42:04,601 --> 01:42:08,351
Peace be upon you.

1058
01:42:16,851 --> 01:42:20,180
Did he say he'll pay? No?

1059
01:42:20,181 --> 01:42:22,301
Always talking about money...

1060
01:42:23,351 --> 01:42:25,180
Let's go!

1061
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:29,260
At 8:43 a.m. today, our
government confirmed

1062
01:42:29,261 --> 01:42:33,890
that Marine Star 1 from Dongin
Shipping Co. Of Busan

1063
01:42:33,891 --> 01:42:38,010
was kidnapped in waters
off the Indian Ocean,

1064
01:42:38,011 --> 01:42:43,180
300 km from the port
of Kismayo, Somalia.

1065
01:42:43,181 --> 01:42:48,800
The hijacked ship carrying
