<i>This film is inspired by actual events,</i>

6
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,600
<i>but all characters and situations
have been fictionalized.</i>

7
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,600
<i>On Sept. 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda led by
Osama bin Laden attacked the US.</i>

8
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:09,150
<i>The US declared war on Afghanistan
for giving refuge to bin Laden.</i>

9
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,649
<i>38 countries joined the war,</i>

10
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,480
<i>with South Korea sending
hundreds of non-combat troops.</i>

11
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,599
<i>After losing power to
a pro-US government,</i>

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,770
<i>the Taliban turned to suicide
bombing and kidnapping foreigners.</i>

SEPTEMBER 19, 2006

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,399
Let us pray.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,979
Lord, please bestow Your
grace on this barren land.

17
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,650
Amen!

18
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:28,399
And please let the seeds
we plant today take root.

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,309
Help the people of this
land to understand that

20
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,269
- Jehovah is their...
- Lord.

21
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,979
- one god.
- Amen!

22
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,979
We believe the Lord Jesus
will be the King of all peace!

23
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
Amen!

24
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,150
Everyone okay?

25
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,810
What's going on?

26
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,729
Open the door!

27
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,519
I'm just a bus driver.

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,780
Please don't hurt me!

29
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,940
Open up, now!

30
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
Quiet!

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,460

SOUTH KOREA, FOREIGN MINISTRY

33
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Deputy Kim!

34
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:48,589
Yes?

35
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,829
What happened?

36
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,739
They were supposed to arrive at
Kandahar yesterday, but they didn't.

37
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,039
That's not what I mean! There's
a travel ban on that country!

38
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,749
They entered Dubai through
Beijing, so we never expected...

39
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,920
Just kill me already.

40
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,240
What is this?

41
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,460
They're all from the same church.

42
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,879
What's their purpose for going there?

43
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,379
We believe it's short-term
missionary work.

44
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,300
- What?
- Look!

45
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:35,340
<i>We demand the Korean government to pull
its troops out of Afghanistan immediately</i>

46
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,049
<i>and promptly release 23 Taliban
warriors locked in Kabul Prison.</i>

47
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,379
Tell the Press Office that all media
should describe them as volunteers.

48
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,170
What?

49
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:49,919
Run, or they're all dead!

50
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,800
Yes, sir!

51
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:51,879
- Bae!
- Yes?

52
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,379
- Call a meeting quickly.
- Yes, sir.

53
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,589
- Check with foreign press.
- Yes.

54
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,549
<i>If our request is not met by
then, we'll kill the hostages.</i>

55
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,090
<i>We give you 24 hours.</i>

56
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,220
KARACHI PRISON, PAKISTAN

57
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,800
Come out!

58
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,010
What is going on?

59
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,840
Sign here.

60
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,590
<i>Park Dae-sik</i>

61
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,510
A hard stay, right?

62
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,219
Three months. No, was it four?

63
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,509
Can't even remember.

64
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,380
Counterfeiting dollars
was a bit extreme.

65
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,760
Was it my decision?

66
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,220
You said you'd pull me out quickly.

67
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,379
Is this how the nation treats
one who risks his life?

68
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,669
You know counterfeiting
is a sensitive issue here.

69
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,670
Okay!

70
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,090
Go to Kabul.

71
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,920
Let's not see each other again.

72
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,879
What's with your attitude?

73
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,050
- People were kidnapped!
- You take care of it.

74
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,670
It's 23 people!

75
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,589
Hurry!

76
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,590
Hurry up!

77
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,919
<i>We will soon be landing at
Kabul International Airport.</i>

78
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,299
<i>The time in Kabul is 8:24 a.m.,
with a temperature of 31 degrees.</i>

79
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,629
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts and return
your tray tables to the upright position.</i>

80
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,630
Vice Minister.

81
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,379
- Vice Minister!
- Huh?

82
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,299
We're landing. Please
put on your seatbelt.

83
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Okay.

84
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,220
KABUL, CAPITAL OF AFGHANISTAN

85
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,590
5 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

86
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,470
Welcome.

87
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,589
How is it with the Afghan government?

88
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,220
The ambassador is doing all
he can, but they won't budge.

89
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,220
Please come with me.

90
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,420
What is it?

91
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,100
He's an intelligence agent.

92
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,099
Are you the negotiator?

93
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,890
What's your strategy?

94
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,679
They like to show they mean business,

95
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,390
so send some positive signal
before they kill someone.

96
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
Understand?

97
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,849
Isn't that the freak who was
screwing around in Pakistan?

98
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,139
Yes, sir.

99
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,349
Didn't he get kicked
out? Why is he here?

100
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,349
I heard he helped deal with the
Korean hostage incident in Iraq.

101
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,099
But that hostage died.

102
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,599
Intelligence officers are
so scarce in this region...

103
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,020
They must really be
desperate for agents.

104
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,640
AFGHAN FOREIGN MINISTRY

105
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:48,219
Two days ago, two German deporters
were kidnapped in the exact same area.

106
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,879
I don't understand why the Koreans did
not ask our government for protection.

107
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,089
Especially when they are
moving in such a large group.

108
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,470
Tell him to stop lecturing
and release those prisoners.

109
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,229
The most important thing right
now is to bring them back, right?

110
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,719
Please release some Taliban prisoners
in exchange for the Koreans,

111
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,740
like you did last time
for the Italian deporter.

112
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,429
The Italian deporter again.

113
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,589
That was a very exceptional case.

114
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,239
And it was one person at that time.

115
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,260
This time, there are
many. Way too many.

116
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,379
You are aware that the kidnappers
asked us to withdraw the troops.

117
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,219
Yes, I know.

118
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,089
But the Korean troops were scheduled to
go back at the end of the year anyway.

119
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,609
They gave you a very easy task.

120
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,570
We could postpone it.

121
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,809
We could even consider
sending more troops

122
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,530
to expand the medical facilities
and roads in Afghanistan.

123
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,309
The Afghan Foreign Minister has
decided to hold a press conference.

124
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,560
Here's Director Jeong.

125
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,019
How long do you think it'll
take to exchange prisoners?

126
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,139
It doesn't seem it will take too long.

127
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,019
But America's stance is most important,

128
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,679
<i>so I think you should
contact Washington.</i>

129
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,889
Got it.

130
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,219
<i>Good work.</i>

131
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,560
Yes, thank you!

132
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,180
ROK EMBASSY ABDUCTION RESPONSE HQ

133
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,470
Tell me the terms of the agreement.

134
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,850
Did you not hear me?

135
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,669
Look, don't you have
any sense of procedure?

136
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,769
Instead of just bursting in,
go through official channels.

137
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,809
I've got no use for that.

138
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,430
Will they really release
Taliban prisoners?

139
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,060
The Afghans will never do a
deal over the troop withdrawal.

140
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,139
How do you know about that?

141
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,469
That's a diplomatic secret
sent over the hotline!

142
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,359
Are you wiretapping us?

143
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,670
I won't let this slide!

144
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,060
What do you know about this country?

145
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,850
People here grind their teeth
at the mention of the Taliban.

146
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:55,929
The president almost got sacked when
he tried to release a few prisoners.

147
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,470
You think he'll let 23 go free?

148
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,430
Sir, it's starting.

149
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,390
Hussein! Hussein!

150
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,169
"We are working closely with
the South Korean government

151
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,839
to solve this hostage crisis."

152
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,130
<i>Will you accept the Taliban's
demand to release the prisoners?</i>

153
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,540
"Under no circumstances will we
release the Taliban prisoners."

154
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,869
"The Afghan government is
considering all other options

155
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,639
to ensure that none of the
Korean hostages are hurt."

156
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,139
What are those bastards saying?

157
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,220
Jeong, what's going on?

158
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,430
It's from Seoul.

159
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,420
Yes, Chief.

160
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,170
<i>Didn't you say you
reached an agreement?</i>

161
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,900
It seems there was a misunderstanding.

162
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,189
Yes, we'll get it cleared up soon.

163
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,500
<i>We've got one hour left!</i>

164
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,360
I know, but...

165
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,899
The Afghan officials aren't picking up?

166
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,030
What? Not yet...

167
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,860
What's with this traffic?

168
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,029
I'm losing my mind...

169
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,479
Is there any shortcut?

170
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,189
Should we try going through the alleys?

171
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,230
Sure.

172
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,940
Shit...

173
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,230
Even more packed here.

174
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,979
Hey, how much time is left?

175
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,569
40 minutes.

176
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,650
Jeez.

177
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,900
Let's take the opposite lane.

178
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,939
Are you blind?

179
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,729
Sorry, sorry!

180
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,520
Slowly. Okay, let's go.

181
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,940
- Are you crazy?
- Are you blind?

182
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,189
What is it now?

183
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,439
How far is it?

184
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,319
It's at the second
intersection, on the corner.

185
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,649
Vice Minister!

186
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,029
There's no time, I
think we should walk.

187
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,530
But arriving on foot...

188
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,110
Hurry, it's fine!

189
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,030
Seriously?

190
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,100
Allah is the Greatest!

191
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,820
Is he still not picking up?

192
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,400
Sir! Are you okay?

193
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,280
Vice Minister, are you hurt?

194
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,439
Hello?

195
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,070
Director Jeong?

196
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,229
We have 30 minutes left.

197
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,860
What do you think will happen?

198
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,819
I think they'll be killed.

199
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,030
How do we stop them?

200
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,869
Announce that we'll withdraw troops,

201
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,929
and contact the OIC quickly.
<i>Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)</i>

202
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,970
<i>Changing our stance means
admitting we made a mistake.</i>

203
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,900
If you look at the situation here,

204
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,780
there is no other way.

205
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,149
Minister! You announced a withdrawal?

206
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,480
Are we giving in to terrorists
after negotiations failed?

207
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,279
What's the backdrop
to this hasty decision?

208
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Minister!

209
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,149
Director! The Taliban
extended the deadline!

210
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,610
What?

211
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,460
- By how much?
- 24 hours.

212
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,559
Take good care of the Vice Minister.

213
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,809
What?

214
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,560
- Director!
- Where are you going?

215
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,959
Don't you think you
should see a doctor first?

216
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,120
I thought we had an agreement.
Why did you back down?

217
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,660
Don't be upset.

218
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,679
We think it is very regretful

219
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,329
that the Korean government had
to give in to the Taliban's demand.

220
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:59,020
We feel the same that the Afghan
government broke our agreement!

221
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,139
All you care about is getting
the hostages released.

222
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,259
But we have to keep
fighting the Taliban,

223
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,130
even after you leave.

224
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,339
Please understand that for us,

225
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,050
this is a very complicated decision.

226
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,759
Listen to me.

227
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,289
What does it take to
release the prisoners?

228
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,320
Aid?

229
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,940
Or American consent?

230
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,090
Answer me. Next time,
there may be no extensions.

231
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,339
Don't get desperate.

232
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,100
This is exactly what the Taliban want.

233
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,189
You sound like you
don't care if they die.

234
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,560
They are innocent
people. Just civilians!

235
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,650
You really believe they are innocent?

236
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,390
Excuse me?

237
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,590
Hello.

238
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,850
Okay.

239
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,209
I have a very urgent
matter I have to attend to.

240
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,719
- If you don't mind.
- No, no!

241
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,059
We are not done.

242
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,360
A German hostage has been murdered.

243
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,279
Next will be a Korean.

244
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,730
Mr. Jeong.

245
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,890
Do you believe what the Taliban
really want is the prisoners' release?

246
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,910
Are you saying there's something else?

247
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,480
I think we already told you.

248
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,499
Salaam.

249
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,930
Do you know this guy?

250
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,230
You seen him?

251
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,489
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

252
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,960
Do you know this guy?

253
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,090
Ask at the second floor
restaurant across the street.

254
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,560
Hurry up!

255
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,360
Are you Qasim?

256
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,080
What is he saying?

257
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,339
Qasim is busy now.

258
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,590
Qasim doesn't know Korean.

259
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Hey!

260
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,390
Lee Bong-han!

261
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,729
You know me?

262
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,890
Come outside.

263
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,389
If you're tired, move to a hotel.

264
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,810
No, I have to hold down the fort.

265
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,980
Are you okay?

266
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:15,980
The Afghans said we could
pay a ransom for the prisoners?

267
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,699
Why didn't you tell me?

268
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,149
Bargain with terrorists?

269
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,159
Are you out of your mind?

270
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,729
What did the Germans get
for sticking to their principles?

271
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,239
Their hostage was murdered!

272
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,680
I'll report to the Minister.

273
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,029
The world will see us as
pushovers if word gets out!

274
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,529
Our aim is to prevent killings,
not protect our reputation!

275
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,530
Everyone here knows that!

276
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,199
Sit still for now.

277
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,409
The intelligence service said
they'll solve it in two days.

278
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,719
Two days?

279
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,859
We only have a day.

280
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,239
What can the NIS do?

281
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,740
The Jirga!

282
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,110
The Jirga.

283
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,819
The Jirga is a council of
Afghan tribal leaders.

284
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:09,409
In a practical sense, all issues in
Afghanistan are decided by them.

285
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,909
If they issue a decision,

286
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,319
the hostages can be released
without an exchange of prisoners.

287
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,820
Currently, our elite agent and a local
coordinator are making contact.

288
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,319
What's wrong?

289
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,950
What? Let's go.

290
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,269
He says the mule must rest.

291
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,319
Or you can pay another
10 thousand afghanis.

292
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,030
What a crook.

293
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,820
We're not even halfway there.

294
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,109
This is the only road?

295
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,280
Sure.

296
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,410
I'm serious.

297
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,320
Okay, 20 thousand.

298
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,729
And another 20 if we
get there before dark.

299
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,540
Okay? Go.

300
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,700
Dae-sik, you should pay him through me.

301
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,530
Wait up!

302
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,569
PASHTUN TRIBAL VILLAGE

303
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:34,820
19 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

304
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,069
Greetings.

305
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,239
This man says he knows Ismael.

306
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,990
They are Koreans.

307
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,450
Smile.

308
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,029
You know Ismael?

309
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,029
Do I know him?

310
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,319
I saved him by taking him
to the Korean medical unit

311
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,979
to get surgery after a bomb exploded.

312
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,670
You did?

313
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,780
Any friend of my nephew is my friend.

314
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,199
But what brings you all the way here?

315
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,899
He's asking why we're here.

316
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,110
It's because of the Korean hostages.

317
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,310
It's because of the Korean hostages.

318
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,400
These people came all
this way for volunteer work.

319
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:03,680
And he brought this
gift as a peace offering.

320
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,600
It's the latest phone.

321
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,859
Rotate to open.

322
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,700
Rotate to close.

323
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,060
See, they love anything made in Korea.

324
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,979
How do you know about this?

325
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,770
You think I'm here to play?

326
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,189
You said there's no road.

327
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,559
There isn't... it's all minefields.

328
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,700
Damn you!

329
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,589
I'm Jeong Jae-ho, representing
Korean government.

330
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,439
Nice to meet you.

331
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,519
This is Jeong Jae-ho.

332
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,110
He's a representative of
the Korean government.

333
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,650
Welcome.

334
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,770
Come in.

335
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,269
Hello, I'm Afghanistan's only
Pashtun-Korean interpreter,

336
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,439
Abdul Kareem Qasim...

337
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,940
Qasim for short, just call me Qasim!

338
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,649
You're a Korean? That's amazing.

339
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,560
- I'll need your help, then.
- Yes.

340
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,190
What are you doing here?

341
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,129
What? I am cooperating.

342
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,840
Don't you dare butt in here.

343
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:38,210
Step aside. I'll handle this my way.

344
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,300
This place has its own rules.

345
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,590
We don't have time for this.
23 lives depend on us.

346
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,130
Sir, please calculate
my fee separately.

347
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:14,420
A professional negotiator like
you is really in another class!

348
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,589
A hospital in the chief's
name, building a school...

349
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,960
That's not class, it's cash.

350
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,670
So a new mobile phone is more classy?

351
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,799
You both work for the
country, no need to bicker.

352
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,129
Doesn't matter what path you
take to get to the same place.

353
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,840
And the phone did the trick. Nice job.

354
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,920
Is he really a key
figure within the Jirga?

355
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,710
For sure.

356
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,209
He's royal family.

357
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,799
Royal family?

358
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,050
Family lines are important in Islam.

359
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,509
There are some families
even the Taliban can't touch.

360
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,760
So we need to win
over that tribal chief.

361
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,379
Korean! Join us.

362
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,919
I think they're testing us.

363
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Wait.

364
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,259
Don't underestimate their pride.

365
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,420
If you refuse, they'll think
you don't respect them.

366
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,710
Have a smoke!

367
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,419
That isn't tobacco, it's a
strong strain of hashish.

368
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,669
One more time!

369
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,339
He says to smoke more, but don't do it.

370
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,480
I'm fine!

371
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,460
Great!

372
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,490
Someone's coming...

373
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,069
He said he'll help us.

374
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,740
He said the hostages will be
safe as we discuss the matter.

375
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,619
They're helping us because
they want to show

376
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,700
that Islam respects honor
and is welcoming to guests.

377
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,030
JIRGA ASSEMBLY

378
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,950
They decided to let them go.

379
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,570
Really? For real?

380
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,869
Wow!

381
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,909
Great work, really!

382
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,280
Thank you!

383
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,450
I'll buy you a drink back in Korea!

384
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,340
I'm not going back to Korea.

385
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,530
I like this area.

386
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,110
I like feeling I'm the only
one between sky and earth.

387
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,200
Hey! Listen up!

388
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,280
They agreed to release the hostages!

389
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,659
What kind of reaction is that?

390
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,989
Anyway, my great translating

391
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,949
and pretending to know
Ismael played a big part.

392
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,540
You're not friends with Ismael?

393
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,740
One in three guys here is named Ismael.

394
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,109
That tickles.

395
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,650
Have you no fear,
pulling a prank like that?

396
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,160
Jeez...

397
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,950
Now, let's settle the payment.

398
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,529
FOREIGN MINISTRY

399
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,739
Director.

400
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,199
What?

401
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,029
There's no plane that
can take all 23 of them.

402
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,570
Should I book a private plane?

403
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,659
Who are they, Olympic gold medalists?

404
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,449
Find some connecting flights!

405
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,450
Yes, sir.

406
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,410
What is it?

407
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:56,069
<i>So why do missionaries keep
taking these reckless trips?</i>

408
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,369
<i>If one dies on a mission...</i>

409
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,819
Don't just stand there.
Call the TV station!

410
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,900
Yes, sir!

411
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,489
<i>In fact, they all wrote their wills
before flying to Afghanistan.</i>

412
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,869
Yes?

413
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,109
<i>This is the Foreign Ministry.</i>

414
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,369
Sorry?

415
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,949
What you're broadcasting
now is very dangerous.

416
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,660
It could provoke the Taliban!

417
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,739
How can I control their opinions?
They aren't reading off a script.

418
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,989
If something happens to the hostages,
will you take responsibility?

419
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,699
Stop the broadcast now!

420
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,619
How can I cut off a live broadcast?

421
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,779
The Taliban don't understand
Korean, what's the problem?

422
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,189
<i>Sorry, I've got to go.</i>

423
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,020
We're broadcasting.

424
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,409
No, go away.

425
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,909
I'm sorry, but everything is settled.

426
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,909
Swindler!

427
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,200
Dae-sik, let's go!

428
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,069
What is he saying?

429
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,409
He's asking why we lied to them?

430
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,540
What?

431
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,069
He asked why we told them
they were volunteers...

432
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,689
Why are they on TV?

433
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,780
Shit...

434
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,979
Listen to me. They're not missionaries.

435
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,930
You've got to insist
they're volunteers, okay?

436
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,620
This is unforgivable!

437
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,909
Volunteers! Volunteers!

438
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,529
They're not volunteers.

439
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,530
Chief!

440
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,420
We're not lying!

441
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,279
The hostages are currently
held in three groups,

442
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,450
with the first eight scheduled
for release tomorrow morning.

443
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,990
The press conference will
resume after a 10-minute break.

444
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,119
What do you mean we
have to pay the ransom?

445
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,779
<i>The negotiation failed!</i>

446
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,199
Every broadcast here
is quoting Korean news,

447
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,870
reporting that the hostages
are missionaries.

448
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,909
Is this true?

449
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,070
Al Jazeera is broadcasting the
Korean feed with subtitles.

450
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,949
The Afghans will mediate
the ransom payment.

451
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,069
<i>Is there no other way?</i>

452
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,529
It's the most realistic,
preferable option now.

453
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,269
Director Jeong, don't be so inflexible.

454
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,200
<i>Why don't you try negotiating
through the Jirga one more time?</i>

455
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,740
It's over with the Jirga, Chief!

456
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,939
Minister, you need to decide quickly.

457
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,070
<i>We'll discuss it, so just wait.</i>

458
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,280
Is that so?

459
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,100
Okay, thanks.

460
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,569
What is it?

461
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,900
An Asian body has
been found in Musheky.

462
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,779
No, that can't be!

463
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,529
Wait, what is it now?

464
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,439
I have to go home!

465
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,730
Let's go check.

466
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,290
Shit...

467
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,780
These people are from
the Korean government.

468
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,280
5 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING

469
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,650
For crying out loud...

470
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,250
What's this?

471
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,940
Wait!

472
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,150
Vice Minister!

473
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,360
I found this on a Taliban website.

474
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,979
<i>My name is Hong Mi-sook.</i>

475
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,899
<i>I am Korean and I work as a nurse.</i>

476
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,320
<i>This is my first time
visiting Afghanistan.</i>

477
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:12,980
<i>Everyone here is kind
and treating us well.</i>

478
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,070
<i>We are provided with a great
meal and bed every day.</i>

479
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,570
<i>I miss my family.</i>

480
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,399
<i>I strongly urge</i>

481
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,439
<i>the Korean government
take more active steps</i>

482
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,400
<i>to save its people.</i>

483
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,979
What did he say?

484
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,980
He said they never asked for money.

485
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,350
The only way for the Korean hostages to go
home is the release of Taliban prisoners.

486
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,229
We warn the Korean government.

487
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,599
Persuade the Afghan government to
release Taliban prisoners within 24 hours

488
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,020
or we will kill more hostages.

489
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,649
Mr. Negotiator, now what?

490
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,480
All right, don't panic.

491
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,179
The Taliban want us to panic.

492
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,319
How can I not panic right now?

493
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,069
Just give me a chance to think!

494
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,820
Think?

495
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,569
People are dying while you think!

496
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,439
Watch your mouth!

497
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,779
Have you gone mad?

498
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,609
Hey, stop it!

499
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,530
What are you doing?

500
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,410
- One more.
- Sure.

501
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:28,560
Neither America, nor President Karzai

502
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,640
will ever hand over the prisoners.

503
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,260
There's only one way.

504
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,929
Direct negotiation.

505
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,039
Never.

506
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,190
That's absolutely ridiculous.

507
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,470
Why?

508
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,640
Are you afraid to meet the Taliban?

509
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,310
It figures...

510
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,560
The dweeb who spends his
life in an air-conditioned office

511
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,060
would pee his pants when
meeting the Taliban.

512
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,929
Do you know what it means to sit
at the same table as the Taliban?

513
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:17,349
There is a Maginot line that
can't be crossed in diplomacy.

514
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:21,719
The moment a diplomat sits
face to face with the Taliban,

515
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,759
South Korea becomes a country
that surrendered to terrorists.

516
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,350
It would be a crushing diplomatic loss!

517
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,100
Diplomacy...

518
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,970
Mr. Diplomat,

519
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,430
you can eat this.

520
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,100
Then send me. I'll go.

521
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,930
Why? You want to make up
for what happened in Iraq?

522
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,260
You think I do this for myself?

523
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,719
Here's some personal advice.

524
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,179
Just go back to Korea.

525
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,559
Staying stuck in the past,
roaming around this place

526
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,180
that would drive anyone crazy.

527
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,410
Save me!

528
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,970
Please save me...

529
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,219
It's all my fault...

530
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,349
Watch, and then tell your government!

531
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,600
I want to go home!

532
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,760
No...

533
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,750
Are you Mr. Park from South
Korea Intelligence Service?

534
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,469
Let me get this straight.

535
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:18,419
So that broker persuaded the Taliban
to change their list of prisoners,

536
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,560
and we'll be able to get
those inmates released?

537
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,450
Yes, how many times
do I have to tell you?

538
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,709
Abdullah is no simple broker.

539
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:33,809
He's a British businessman who
dealt with the Taliban before the war,

540
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,559
and has intervened in such
kidnappings countless times.

541
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,559
How do we get those
inmates out of prison?

542
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,830
An inside job.

543
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,770
How is that possible, especially
with the U.S. military against it?

544
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,760
Since it's in Ghazni, it's possible.

545
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,339
The central government has
less control over that region.

546
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,349
Jailbreaks happen often.

547
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,099
How much does he want?

548
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,429
Two million dollars.

549
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:56,430
What?

550
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:10,159
Mr. Abdullah, until now, the Taliban
demanded we release 23 prisoners.

551
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,620
Now suddenly, they changed the list?

552
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:15,129
I don't understand.

553
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,459
The Taliban also feel uncomfortable
about these killings.

554
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,429
As the clock is ticking, they are
having internal disagreements.

555
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,470
If given the chance,
they prefer to negotiate.

556
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,190
You are not Afghan. Why get involved?

557
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,259
As someone who understands the Afghans,

558
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,890
I truly want these Koreans
to go back to their families.

559
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,509
No trust.

560
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,219
No deal.

561
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,920
I'm wasting my time here.

562
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,670
Just a moment, please.

563
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:07,729
What's the problem?

564
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,149
He's settled kidnapping cases?

565
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,600
Then let's check with
the British government.

566
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,939
Everyone working here has
fake names and nationalities.

567
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,189
A background check will take too long.

568
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,730
We have to go with our gut feeling.

569
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,569
Please decide quickly.

570
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,899
There's no time to sit and think.

571
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,899
We need to properly check first!

572
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,979
What if there's another victim?
Will you take the blame?

573
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,569
If she's ready, put her on the phone.

574
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:35,720
<i>Hello?</i>

575
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,850
Will this buy your trust?

576
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,120
Two minutes.

577
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
<i>Hello?</i>

578
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:49,439
This is the Vice Foreign
Minister. What's your name?

579
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,939
<i>I am Hong Mi-sook. Please help me!</i>

580
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,269
Yes, please stay calm.
I'll ask you a few questions.

581
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,319
How many are with you now?

582
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,109
<i>There are seven of us here.</i>

583
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,899
How many Taliban guards?

584
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,439
<i>Three?</i>

585
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,479
How's everyone's health?

586
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,729
<i>Not good, especially Hye-young,
she's not eating at all.</i>

587
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:15,069
Where do you think you are now?
Any recognizable terrain?

588
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:19,650
<i>I don't know. They
keep moving us at night.</i>

589
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,149
<i>Wait!</i>

590
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:27,770
<i>Please just tell my family this.</i>

591
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,269
<i>I'm sorry, and I love
them. Just tell them that...</i>

592
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:37,360
Ms. Hong! Don't worry, you'll
be able to tell them yourself.

593
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:45,940
So?

594
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,160
Now what?

595
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,519
<i>One hundred dollar bills. No consecutive
serial numbers. Put them in two bags.</i>

596
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,970
Mix them up.

597
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,270
Dae-sik, there's 100 here.

598
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,880
<i>As soon as we get the money,
you get the prisoners.</i>

599
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,650
4 HOURS BEFORE DEADLINE

600
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,480
Team A has arrived.

601
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:59,229
GHAZNI CENTRAL PRISON

602
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,109
Team B ready.

603
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,020
Everyone stay alert, and
let's finish this quickly.

604
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,780
Where is Abdullah?

605
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,060
Where's the money?

606
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,010
Salaam!

607
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,850
Now, release the prisoners.

608
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,670
Should we count the money first?

609
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,590
The prisoners first.

610
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,070
Very well.

611
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,210
It's me.

612
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,200
Release the prisoners.

613
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:48,390
Yes, Vice Minister.
We counted 23 of them.

614
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,460
It's done.

615
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,880
This heat is killing me!

616
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,089
What the...?

617
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:18,209
What is it? What's wrong?

618
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,210
Vice Minister, look at this.

619
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,919
Director Jeong asked me to
dig up more info on Abdullah.

620
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,299
This is from the
British Foreign Ministry,

621
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,169
and it seems he's a fake.

622
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:31,459
Abdullah, real name Peter Merchant.

623
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,260
It says he died in Kuwait last year.

624
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,109
Take the prisoners to this place.

625
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,840
The Korean hostages will be there.

626
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,690
May God be with you.

627
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,550
Just a moment.

628
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,259
Director Jeong! Don't
give him the money!

629
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,080
What?

630
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:57,080
He's a fraud!

631
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:00,950
Hands up.

632
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,800
Put it down.

633
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,419
Are you okay?

634
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,769
I'm okay.

635
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,310
Put it down!

636
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,369
No, don't go!

637
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,499
Don't follow them!

638
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,500
No!

639
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,170
Shit...

640
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,960
Sorry.

641
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,380
Take him out, quick!

642
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,319
Hey!

643
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,439
Investigate whether that
NIS nut was in on this fraud!

644
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,610
Find out how much he got paid!

645
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:09,939
You should've checked if the Taliban
got paid for allowing that call!

646
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,730
You think you're here on vacation?

647
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,939
You bastard. You won't
get away with this!

648
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,859
You're out to ruin us, aren't you?

649
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:28,070
Please stop, sir.
He's doing all he can.

650
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,900
It's a Taliban general.

651
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,520
Hussein.

652
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:58,880
He wants to suggest something very
important to the Korean government now.

653
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:10,399
"Transfer $100,000 to the foreign
account by this afternoon.

654
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,649
Then we'll release 30 Koreans."

655
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:15,109
He's saying he'll release 30 Koreans.

656
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,690
30?

657
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,610
Not 23, but 30?

658
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:27,359
Fake Taliban, petty crime
inmates, a fraud broker...

659
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,230
Damn!

660
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,460
Hello?

661
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,749
This time, he says he's
the Taliban commander.

662
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,929
He said the deadline
has already passed.

663
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,069
First he's a general,
now he's a commander?

664
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,939
Translate this word for word!

665
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,520
If he calls one more time,
he won't get away with it!

666
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,320
<i>My name is Park Sung-jin.</i>

667
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:09,979
<i>Born August 1973.</i>

668
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,150
<i>I live in Ojeong-dong, Bucheon.</i>

669
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,000
Mr. Park Sung-jin!

670
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:24,269
Tell him it's a misunderstanding.
We need more time!

671
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:25,470
Translate now!

672
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:30,899
<i>Please meet these people's demands!</i>

673
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,570
<i>Then we can live.</i>

674
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,769
<i>Please save me!</i>

675
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:40,759
Whatever it takes, we will find
a way to release the prisoners!

676
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,010
Hurry!

677
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,269
We gave enough time,
but you kept wasting time.

678
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,889
Hurry and tell them!

679
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:57,929
<i>I want to live! Please save me!</i>

680
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:01,690
Mr. Park, say "Nanawatai".

681
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,020
Protection! Fairness! Mercy
of the Pashtun people!

682
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,980
<i>- Allah is the Greatest!</i>
- No!

683
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,059
Next time, bring me the right answer.

684
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,220
The next deadline is
tomorrow at 4 o'clock.

685
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,220
Welcome, Minister. I'm
Secretary Cha Min-yong.

686
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,860
I'm ashamed to make you
come so far, Minister.

687
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:54,139
<i>The Taliban have warned the Korean government
that there will be further killings.</i>

688
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,069
<i>In response, the Foreign
Affairs minister</i>

689
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,519
<i>has made a visit to the
Afghan President Karzai.</i>

690
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,099
<i>Will the Korean government's new negotiation
strategy be able to satisfy the Taliban</i>

691
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,559
<i>without causing any friction to
the South Korean-Afghan relations,</i>

692
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:12,460
<i>and effectively prevent the
Taliban from further killings?</i>

693
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,160
Yes?

694
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,689
What happened?

695
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,690
They launched a military operation!

696
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:05,570
What are you talking about?

697
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,359
<i>The military have mobilised in Ghazni,</i>

698
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:14,269
<i>and there are concerns that the joint
military exercise will provoke the Taliban...</i>

699
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:18,020
So this is the plan
the Minister brought?

700
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:27,479
Vice Minister.

701
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,979
Is it true that we're launching
a military operation?

702
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,520
Just a normal operation.

703
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:36,330
This is a sensitive time,
it can provoke the Taliban!

704
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,000
We need to stop this right now!

705
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:41,570
How can we stop soldiers from
training on the battlefield?

706
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:42,899
It's not...

707
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,990
We're preparing for the worst.

708
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:49,109
If they kill any more hostages,

709
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:51,099
there will be a rescue operation.

710
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:56,149
Minister, the U.S. military's attacks
in that area have failed for years!

711
01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:00,780
So should we just sit back
and watch the hostages die?

712
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,850
We're not done negotiating yet.

713
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:08,279
President Karzai gave a final
refusal to release the prisoners.

714
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,529
What?

715
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:14,239
Director Jeong, start packing.

716
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,359
You've done enough.
Your work is done here.

717
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,950
- Minster!
- I'll take care of it, so go home.

718
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,949
Then what will happen to the captives?

719
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:29,780
Minister! The U.S. Army
commander is on the line.

720
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:50,860
What did he say?

721
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,070
How did it go?

722
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,490
I've been ordered home.

723
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,700
What?

724
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:10,250
So you're just going to walk away?

725
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,160
And the captives?

726
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:16,949
You're going to let them die?

727
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,970
Hey!

728
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:32,819
I feel bad seeing you leave after
all the trouble you went through.

729
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,999
I'll come visit you when
I'm back in Seoul.

730
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,700
Thank you for your efforts.

731
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,250
Great work.

732
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,010
<i>Let's hear what they have to say.</i>

733
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,680
<i>Hong Mi-sook is my wife and
a mother of two children.</i>

734
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:55,450
<i>Please bring her back safely.</i>

735
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:00,440
<i>Please help my wife Hong Mi-sook</i>

736
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:04,600
<i>to return home safely. Please!</i>

737
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:10,370
<i>Honey, you must be so tired.</i>

738
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:13,870
Hold on.

739
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:24,039
Hello? This is Jeong
Jae-ho from Afghanistan.

740
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,909
I'd like to speak to the
Chief Presidential Secretary.

741
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:29,999
<i>He's in a meeting now,
so if you tell me...</i>

742
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,289
This is a very urgent matter,
so please connect me.

743
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,659
<i>He can't answer the phone right now.</i>

744
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,659
If I don't talk to him
now, you'll regret it!

745
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,780
Director of Foreign Ministry? So what?

746
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,539
Director Jeong, what is it?

747
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:46,000
Mr. Secretary.

748
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:52,039
Let me negotiate
face-to-face with the Taliban.

749
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,749
I'll try to persuade them myself.

750
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,120
Did they change their conditions?

751
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:03,750
No, but face-to-face negotiations
are our last chance now.

752
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:10,079
I know how you feel,

753
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,660
<i>but Minister Choi is there
now, so follow his orders.</i>

754
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:27,200
Director, you'll be
late for your flight.

755
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,399
Hello! This is Jeong Jae-ho!

756
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,110
<i>This is the President.</i>

757
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,290
<i>You really think there's a chance?</i>

758
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:27,870
<i>Everyone says it's
impossible. Is it possible?</i>

759
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:32,620
It's a long shot.

760
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:36,919
But Mr. President, I can't give up.

761
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,319
<i>I'm told we can't
guarantee your safety.</i>

762
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,329
<i>Will you still go?</i>

763
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:44,330
Yes.

764
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,250
<i>You can come back alive?</i>

765
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,500
I'll try my best.

766
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,459
My fellow Koreans.

767
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:05,919
1 HOUR BEFORE DEADLINE
You must be anxious at the news of a second victim

768
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,749
among our people kidnapped
by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

769
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:18,579
<i>I emphasize, we are willing
to use any means possible</i>

770
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:23,289
<i>to ensure the prompt and
safe return of our citizens.</i>

771
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:26,420
Director Jeong, do you
know what you've done?

772
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:33,120
Our president just sent an open invitation
to negotiate with the terrorists!

773
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:37,350
You know better than anyone what
a stain this is on our diplomacy!

774
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:44,099
As far as I know, our first
duty is to protect our citizens.

775
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,930
If I am mistaken, please tell me.

776
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,269
We have a message from the Taliban.

777
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:54,219
The hostages are safe,

778
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,640
and if we send a team,
they'll negotiate with us.

779
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:04,429
The expected point of contact is near
Mijan, northeast of Kandahar Province.

780
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:08,389
The U.S. military will provide
protection up to the meeting spot.

781
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,219
It's said they want

782
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:14,309
$1M for a US prisoner, and $1.5M
for an Italian photographer.

783
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,349
We've got a lot of people.

784
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,430
This is highly confidential.

785
01:12:22,444 --> 01:12:23,115
Thank you so much.

786
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,390
KIDNAPPING LOCATION

787
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,059
How many vehicles for that day?

788
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,310
- Two cars, eight in total.
- Okay.

789
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:40,099
Javeed Nurul Haq.

790
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,140
Considered a top-level terrorist
even among the Taliban.

791
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:53,560
It's a group that the
CIA are keen to capture.

792
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:58,849
This is quite terrible.

793
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:02,220
He's a notorious figure
even among the Taliban.

794
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,470
Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim?

795
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,060
- Where's Abdul Kareem Qasim?
- I'm here!

796
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,929
Dae-sik!

797
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:18,930
Move!

798
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:22,639
Dae-sik, buddy!

799
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,680
Can you please get me out of here?

800
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,099
No wonder I couldn't reach you.

801
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,179
You couldn't stay out of trouble?

802
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:34,600
It was a misunderstanding.

803
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,059
Should I give you a chance to get out?

804
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:41,139
Please. As a fellow Korean, please?

805
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:44,270
- Then translate for me.
- Of course, whatever you...

806
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,930
Where are we going?

807
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,810
- To the Taliban.
- The Taliban?

808
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,889
Have a safe trip. I'll just stay here.

809
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,469
It's to save people.

810
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:02,179
I should risk my life to save theirs?

811
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:04,599
What nonsense. Bye!

812
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,139
It's probably better
than getting flogged.

813
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,519
Flogged?

814
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,939
Gambling, drinking, swindling.

815
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,780
You did the full set.

816
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:19,099
Under Sharia law, you'll get
whipped dozens of times.

817
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,560
Can you take that?

818
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,430
It hurts. It already hurts.

819
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,770
Let's talk outside.

820
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,520
10 DAYS SINCE KIDNAPPING

821
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:49,120
Are you ready?

822
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,539
What?

823
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,210
You being nice is awkward.

824
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,330
Since I may never see you again.

825
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:05,710
It's a joke.

826
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,999
You know how to joke?

827
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,460
Why aren't you wearing this?

828
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:17,550
They'll think I'm scared. I won't
give them the upper hand.

829
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,230
Pride won't protect you from bullets.

830
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:34,830
Thanks.

831
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:45,920
No bathroom breaks
during the negotiation.

832
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,100
I can't even drink water?

833
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:02,290
They're coming.

834
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:15,249
I heard you were a church deacon.

835
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,539
Why does that matter
when I'm facing death?

836
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:20,210
I'll pray to the local god.

837
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,310
What is he saying?

838
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:40,170
Go on.

839
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,369
Huh?

840
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:43,370
Go.

841
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:45,170
Me?

842
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:51,460
Why'd they have to come here
and cause so much trouble?

843
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,210
Will you be okay?

844
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:03,790
With what?

845
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,619
Not calling your family.

846
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:11,820
Wow, you really must
have wiretapped us.

847
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,000
You know who I envy the most?

848
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:25,750
Someone with a place to go back to.

849
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:38,080
They said only the negotiator
and interpreter can come.

850
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:44,210
I don't think I need this.

851
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:48,170
Let's go.

852
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,120
Wait.

853
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,670
Pop this with your molars in one bite.

854
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:14,830
Hey.

855
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,120
I'm good.

856
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,419
Hey! Where are we going?

857
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,169
Shut up.

858
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,920
Where are we going?

859
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:42,670
Director, how far are we going?

860
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:19,079
I am Jeong Jae-ho, the negotiator
representing the Korea government.

861
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,460
I'm here to negotiate
the hostage issue.

862
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,500
He says it's nice to meet you.

863
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,040
He asks if you brought the answer.

864
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:57,420
What are you doing? These
people are quick-tempered.

865
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:03,140
First, ask them to show us
the condition of the Koreans.

866
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,890
- Bring the monitor.
- Yes.

867
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:31,339
He says now that you've
checked, let's start talking.

868
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:34,760
- There's one more thing.
- What is it now?

869
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:43,389
As I'm here on behalf of
the Korean government,

870
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:47,090
you should prove you are
the leader of this negotiation.

871
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:02,050
This guy is a bit particular.

872
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:10,760
What can he do to make you believe him?

873
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:16,389
Tell him to release three
of the hostages first.

874
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:18,390
- What?
- Translate, now!

875
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,840
Dammit, this...

876
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:31,970
He says you're tricking them!

877
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:38,510
If you let them go now, Muslims all
over the world will be proud of you.

878
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,549
He said he'll let two go.

879
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:02,140
That it's a gift from Allah.

880
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,489
Hold on. We have to
check for explosives.

881
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:28,789
What the hell are you saying?

882
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:29,830
Over here!

883
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:37,970
Oh, god!

884
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,590
Ms. Kim Hye-young? Ms. Kim?

885
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:45,119
Come here.

886
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,430
Come here!

887
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:50,050
Hello?

888
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,470
<i>How did it go?</i>

889
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:55,259
Kim Hye-young and Lee
Jin-hee are safe with us.

890
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,460
<i>Okay.</i>

891
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,590
He says it's our turn.

892
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,100
What are you doing?

893
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:16,510
Come on, say something!

894
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:24,300
There will be no release of prisoners.

895
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:29,339
What?

896
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:30,839
You said you brought the answer.

897
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,839
This is our answer.

898
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,800
If he wants to proceed, tell
him to change the conditions.

899
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,139
I can't. We'll die if I say that.

900
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,509
What did he say? Tell us now!

901
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:43,570
Okay, I'll tell you.

902
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,890
This will only weaken
your bargaining power!

903
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:13,890
He said he'll do the
negotiation his way.

904
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,740
He told them to kill that woman.

905
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,480
Sir, won't you do something?

906
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:48,430
Stop!

907
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,720
Wait.

908
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:04,060
I will ask our government.

909
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:27,389
<i>They're changing their conditions.</i>

910
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:34,680
He said to free all Taliban
prisoners by midnight tonight.

911
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,799
Let me confirm that.

912
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,179
All of the Taliban prisoners?

913
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:45,410
<i>That's correct.</i>

914
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,640
If we don't,

915
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,640
they'll kill a hostage

916
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:54,350
every hour.

917
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,560
300 prisoners?

918
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:02,930
They had no intention of
negotiating in the first place.

919
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:06,830
Let's go to Bagram Air Base.

920
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,559
Please wait a little longer!

921
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,599
Who do you think you are?

922
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,099
We sent Jeong Jae-ho as our negotiator!

923
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:18,479
Shouldn't we give him
that slim chance and wait?

924
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,640
If we start bombing now, the
negotiator is in most danger.

925
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:39,100
I think it's time, why
aren't they calling?

926
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:44,890
They won't.

927
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:48,850
Why? Wait a minute...

928
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:58,679
They said the Korean government broke off
the negotiation. What'll happen to us?

929
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,220
We never should have
given them a chance!

930
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:03,560
You tricked us.

931
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:07,810
No!

932
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:18,179
The Allies have launched
a military campaign.

933
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,890
What?

934
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,309
He said to stop lying.

935
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:38,980
They've got 21 hostages, so the Allies
can't carry out a rescue operation.

936
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:44,519
Why did he say 21? Two
got released, it should be 19...

937
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,140
This isn't a rescue operation,
this is a mop-up operation!

938
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:58,930
The U.S. and Afghan forces just
needed an excuse to level this place.

939
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,849
When the operation starts,

940
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:08,180
the hostages, you and your
men, and us too will all die!

941
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:14,810
Are a few of your men more
important than saving many lives?

942
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:24,370
You yourself provided the excuse
for this bombing. Know that!

943
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,910
I know what you are thinking.

944
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:43,379
You come here to save those people.

945
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:46,100
You don't just let them be killed.

946
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:50,150
Tell your government
to stop the attack.

947
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:55,439
We don't have the power.

948
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,129
Koreans aren't our guests.

949
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:59,309
You sent the troops here!

950
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:01,819
You are an extremely rich country.

951
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:03,610
You can do whatever you want.

952
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:09,379
You may be a good commander,

953
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:12,960
but you are nothing as a negotiator.

954
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,910
You know your biggest mistake?

955
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,280
You overestimated us.

956
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:38,969
Allah is the only god.

957
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:42,220
Muhammad... Muhammad
is the only prophet.

958
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:05,339
It's the price of breaking
down this deal.

959
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,680
I will send you the hell first!

960
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:15,299
The only way to stop the bombing
is to tell them we have a deal.

961
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,609
We are not afraid of American missiles!

962
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:18,959
Time is on our side.

963
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,319
So is Allah.

964
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,079
Eventually, we are
going to win this war.

965
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,259
Why take things so far?

966
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:26,879
You know better than anyone,

967
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,180
the prisoner exchange is impossible!

968
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:31,300
Why do you think?

969
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:35,800
Money.

970
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:39,230
Money? You have insulted us!

971
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:43,720
Take him out!

972
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:47,910
Take him too!

973
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:53,930
He told them to take me
too! Director, what do I do?

974
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,350
These American bastards!

975
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:04,470
Allah is the Greatest!

976
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:32,200
50 million.

977
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,390
40.

978
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,580
20.

979
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:09,980
Remember, Afghanistan
is the graveyard of empires.

980
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,499
Send all the troops home.

981
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,900
Make all Koreans leave
Afghanistan in a month, for good.

982
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:22,390
Okay?

983
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:27,239
Okay.

984
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,589
Never set your foot
again in this country,

985
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:30,670
Korean.

986
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:02,639
Hello?

987
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,489
The negotiation is done.

988
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,679
They'll release all the hostages.

989
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,550
Call the Americans.

990
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,720
Good work!

991
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,750
Director Jeong?

992
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:20,480
<i>Nice work everyone.
We've reached a deal!</i>

993
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:41,140
You can go back to Korea now.

994
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,640
Thank you.

995
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:21,550
I take back my comment
on you being a dweeb.

996
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:27,669
Great work.

997
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:29,929
No, thank you.

998
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:34,180
I really wouldn't have been
able to do it without you.

999
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:40,640
What's this?

1000
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:46,759
They said one has to stay behind.

1001
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:49,679
What are they talking about?

1002
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:53,339
They guaranteed our safety up to here,

1003
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,419
so they want to
ensure their safety too.

1004
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:57,450
We're done negotiating, what is this?

1005
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:04,000
He said if we don't do
it, no one can leave here.

1006
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:20,170
I'm the representative of
this negotiation, so I'll stay.

1007
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:35,210
Then as the person in charge,
lead them safely back to Korea.

1008
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:39,210
It's my turn now.

1009
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:48,170
Don't worry. My luck is good.

1010
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:54,910
I will stay.

1011
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:58,080
Let him go.

1012
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:04,960
Get it together!

1013
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:07,920
Be sure to see the director off.

1014
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,880
You did well, Lee Bong-han. Go.

1015
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:18,340
Take care of yourself, brother.

1016
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:22,799
"If I break this agreement and disclose
anything about my work here,

1017
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,510
I agree to be punished
according to the law..."

1018
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,360
Pretty straightforward, right?

1019
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:40,540
Thank you.

1020
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:51,010
We work ourselves to death,
and are left with nothing.

1021
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:56,599
21 people came back alive.

1022
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:57,720
That's true.

1023
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:09,309
<i>The 21 former hostages abducted
in Afghanistan on September 19</i>

1024
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:11,859
<i>have just landed at
Incheon Int'I Airport.</i>

1025
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:14,649
<i>The safety of one anonymous team member</i>

1026
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:19,979
<i>who remained with the Taliban after
the deal has also been confirmed.</i>

1027
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:26,310
<i>This marks an end to the largest
hostage crisis in Korea's history.</i>

1028
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:33,650
3 MONTHS LATER

1029
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:37,979
The Minister's at the press conference,
but we still haven't figured it out?

1030
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:40,860
What do you even do? Find out now!

1031
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:45,559
Hello, who is this?

1032
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:48,769
<i>You didn't go to Washington?</i>

1033
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:50,320
<i>Or maybe you couldn't?</i>

1034
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,020
Park Dae-sik?

1035
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:56,229
You son of a...

1036
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:58,810
So quick to swear at me!

1037
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:00,529
<i>Where are you now?</i>

1038
01:41:00,530 --> 01:41:02,779
Why didn't you call?

1039
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:05,699
You know how worried
I was? You weren't hurt?

1040
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:08,370
I told you. My luck is good.

1041
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:12,329
Is that Director Jeong? Me, me!

1042
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:16,069
Hold on, someone wants to say hi.

1043
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,369
<i>Huh?</i>

1044
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:19,029
Director Jeong...

1045
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:20,909
Salaam! Have you been well?

1046
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:23,449
Oh, Qasim! Lee Bong-han!

1047
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:27,229
There must really be no one there.
Working with Qasim again?

1048
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:30,980
Last time in Afghanistan, I
don't think I got fully paid...

1049
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,080
You little...

1050
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:36,150
Director Jeong, come quickly.

1051
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:41,489
Anyway, take care of yourselves.
Let's get in touch soon.

1052
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:43,159
<i>Take care and...</i>

1053
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:47,240
I won't say see you later. Don't
want to get into another mess.

1054
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:53,950
Park Dae-sik.

1055
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:58,869
Everyone has a place to go back to.

1056
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:59,910
You know, right?

1057
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:08,330
Peace be upon you.

1058
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:20,159
Did he say he'll pay? No?

1059
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,280
Always talking about money...

1060
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:25,159
Let's go!

1061
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:29,239
At 8:43 a.m. today, our
government confirmed

1062
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:33,869
that Marine Star 1 from Dongin
Shipping Co. Of Busan

1063
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:37,989
was kidnapped in waters
off the Indian Ocean,

1064
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:43,159
300 km from the port
of Kismayo, Somalia.

1065
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:48,779
The hijacked ship carrying
a total of 25 people

1066
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:51,029
is believed to have been hijacked

1067
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:54,200
by Somali pirates armed
with portable rockets.

1068
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:59,619
We are holding an emergency
diplomatic and security meeting

1069
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:01,699
to discuss countermeasures,

1070
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:05,950
and a response team will
be sent as soon as possible.

1071
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:11,490
HWANG JUNG-MIN
