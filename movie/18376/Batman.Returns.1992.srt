Penguin man living in Gotham sewers!

May l have your attention, Gotham City?

19
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:08,357
今晚点燃圣诞树的时刻 已经到了

20
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:08,357
lt is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.

21
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,625
好看吧？

22
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,625
How about that?

23
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:33,186
半人半企鹅，十分恐怖

24
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:33,186
Part man, part penguin! All horrifying!

25
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:36,390

32
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:46,937
Missing link between man and bird.

33
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:48,705
是人与鸟间的缺失环节

34
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:48,705
My dear boy...

35
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:51,608
孩子，有时看那种垃圾 是种消遣

36
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:51,608
...sometimes it's a diversion to read such rubbish.

37
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:54,011
但多数时候是浪费时间

38
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:54,011
Usually, it's a waste of time.

39
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:58,584
随你说 今日专题，企鹅 快来看，人或谜？

40
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:58,584
Whatever. Today's issue! The Penguin! Man or myth?

41
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,953
“环球报”在此，25分

42
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,953
''The Globe''! Right here! 25 cents!

43
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,699
祝希望，也许加上些幸运

44
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,699
Well, here's hoping.

45
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,758
高谭可在漫长时期后 过第一个快乐圣诞节

46
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,758
With luck, Gotham will have its first merry Christmas in years.

47
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:34,541
我觉得很下流 在圣诞季节提起新发电厂

48
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:34,541
l feel almost vulgar at yuletide...

49
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:39,401
但我们若要动工兴建 就需要许可

50
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:39,401
...mentioning the new power plant. But if we're to break ground when we must, l'll need permits...

51
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:45,095
法规变通，减税鼓励 那类讨厌的微末小节

52
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:45,095
...variances, tax incentives. That sort of pesky nonsense.

53
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:47,472
发电厂？

54
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:47,472
Power plant?

55
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:49,647
麦斯，所有研究均显示

56
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:49,647
Studies show we've enough power to get

57
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:52,483
我们的电力 足以应付到下世纪中期

58
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:52,483
us into the middle of the next century.

59
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:55,221
你的分析家指的是 每年百分之一的人口成长

60
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:55,221
Your analysts foresee growth at 1% per annum.

61
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:58,519
那不是成长，是温和膨胀

62
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:58,519
That's a mild swelling.

63
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:00,060
试想像

64
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:00,060
lmagine...

65
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,130
一个高谭市

66
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,130
...a Gotham City...

67
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,659
在未来

68
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,659
...of the future,

69
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:08,737
灯光燃起如一片繁星 但却闪灭不定

70
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:08,737
lit up like a blanket of stars...but blinking on and off...

71
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:11,508
电力低得令人难堪

72
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:11,508
...embarrassingly low on juice.

73
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:13,346
老实说

74
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:13,346
Frankly...

75
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,462
我因而畏缩，市长先生

76
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,462
...l cringe, Mr. Mayor.

77
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,836
抱歉，你的任何计划

78
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,836
Sorry, any plans must go

79
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:21,520
都得循正常管道 向负责委员会申请

80
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:21,520
to the usual committees...through the usual channels.

81
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,058
我有个建议

82
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,058
l have a suggestion.

83
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,443
好的...

84
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,443
Well...

85
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:37,246
事实上更算是个问题

86
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:37,246
...actually, really, just more like a question.

87
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:42,746
恐怕我们未适当训练 凯尔小姐

88
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:42,746
l'm afraid we haven't properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.

89
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:46,553
但她有个优点 她泡的咖啡非常香

90
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:46,553
ln the plus column, though...she makes great coffee.

91
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:56,747
爸

92
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:56,747
Dad?

93
00:08:57,164 --> 00:09:02,964
市长先生 该下去为大众带来喜悦了

94
00:08:57,164 --> 00:09:02,964
Mr. Mayor? Time to go down and bring joy to the masses.

95
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,052
天！ “事实上更算是个问题”

96
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,052
''Actually, more of a question.''

97
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,712
你这个笨蛋

98
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,712
You stupid corn dog.

99
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:19,099
天！笨蛋，笨蛋

100
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:19,099
Corn dog, corn dog.

101
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,328
我光靠许瑞克员工 便可取得足以重选的签名

102
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,328
l have enough signatures from Shreck employees to warrant a recall.

103
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:51,731
那不是威胁 只是单纯数据

104
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:51,731
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.

105
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:52,762
也许

106
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:52,762
Maybe.

107
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,169
但你没有立场 而且也没有候选人

108
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,169
But you sure as hell don't have an issue or a candidate.

109
00:09:56,338 --> 00:10:00,175
哈，许瑞克先生 非常感谢各位女士先生

110
00:09:56,338 --> 00:10:00,175
Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen.

111
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:05,525
祝我们市政府的人 和你们所有人-假期快乐

112
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:05,525
From those of us at City Hall to each and every one of you......Happy Holidays.

113
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:09,319
今晚有位不需介绍的人 与我们同在

114
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:09,319
We have with us a man who needs no introduction,

115
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,489
他对本市贡献良多

116
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,489
he's given us so much.

117
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:16,602
请欢迎高谭市的圣诞老人 麦斯许瑞克

118
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:16,602
Please welcome Gotham's own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.

119
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,789
到人事处拿那些合约

120
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,789
Pick up those contracts from Personnel and...

121
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:43,096
再去拿干洗衣物和纸巾

122
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:43,096
...pick up the dry cleaning and paper towels.

123
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:46,523
糟糕

124
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:46,523
Darn!

125
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:54,075
忘了我的讲稿

126
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:54,075
Forgot my speech.

127
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:58,180
提醒我教训那个叫什么的

128
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:58,180
Remind me to take it out on what's-her-name.

129
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:03,906
圣诞老人？恐怕不是

130
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:03,906
Santa Claus?Afraid not.

131
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:08,893
我只是个低贱的走运笨蛋

132
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:08,893
l'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.

133
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:13,046
我要回馈你们若不满意 就告我吧

134
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:13,046
Sue me...if l want to give some back.

135
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:20,870
但愿我能送出的 不只是昂贵的玩具

136
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:20,870
l only wish l could hand out more than just...expensive baubles.

137
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:25,481
但愿我能送出世界和平

138
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:25,481
l wish l could hand out world peace...

139
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:28,601
和无条件的爱

140
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:28,601
...and unconditional love...

141
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,315
包在大蝴蝶结中

142
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,315
...wrapped in a big bow.

143
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:37,300
但是你可以 你会的！

144
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:37,300
Oh, but you can.Oh, but you will.

145
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,274
圣诞快乐

146
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,274
Merry Christmas.

147
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:00,388
好主意

148
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:00,388
Great idea.

149
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:02,597
不是我的主意

150
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:02,597
Not mine.

151
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,611
你在等什么？发出讯号

152
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,611
Give the signal!

153
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:32,692
我们要大角色 主导一切的那个家伙

154
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:32,692
We want the big guy! The guy who runs the show!

155
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,371
你要什么？ 不是你

156
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,371
What do you want?Not you!

157
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:41,090
许瑞克 你得先过我这一关

158
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:41,090
Shreck!You'll have to go through me.

159
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:42,636
奇普！

160
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:42,636
Chip

161
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,787
爸，走，救你自已

162
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,787
Dad! Go! Save yourself!

163
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:45,795
爸，走！

164
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:45,795
Dad, go!

165
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:41,655
不！ 闭嘴！

166
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:41,655
Shut up!

167
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:52,798
再上前一步，蝙蝠侠先生 我就...

168
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:52,798
Take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and l'll--

169
00:15:58,284 --> 00:15:59,636
没打中

170
00:15:58,284 --> 00:15:59,636
Missed.

171
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,614
是那位蝙蝠侠

172
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,614
The Batman.

173
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:17,203
或只是蝙蝠侠

174
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:17,203
Or is it just ''Batman''?

175
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,297
当然，任你选择

176
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,297
Your choice, of course.

177
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,588
真是短暂

178
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,588
Well, that was... ...very brief.

179
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,692
就和我生命中的 所有男人一样

180
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,692
Just like all the men in my life.

181
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,389
什么男人？

182
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,389
What men?

183
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:35,245
但是...

184
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:35,245
Well...

185
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:39,788
但话说回来，还有你 不过你需要治疗

186
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:39,788
...then again, there's you. But you need therapy.

187
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:05,201
谢谢你拯救我们，蝙蝠侠 恐怕马戏团帮又回来了

188
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:05,201
Thanks for saving the day, Batman. The Circus Gang is back.

189
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:06,569
静观后效吧

190
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:06,569
We'll see.

191
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,938
他们差点捉走麦斯许瑞克

192
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,938
They almost made off with our mover and shaker, Max Shreck.

193
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,174
那令人难以忍受的混蛋呢

194
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,174
Where is that insufferable bastard?

195
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,399
（动物园）

196
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:04,650
（极地世界）

197
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:24,939
嗨

198
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:24,939
Hi

199
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,038
相信你搜寻的字眼是...

200
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,038
l believe the word you're looking for is...

201
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,861
事实上 这一切只是个恶梦

202
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,861
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.

203
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:53,234
你在家中床上 无比宁静，安适的憩息着

204
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:53,234
You're at home in bed... ...heavily sedated, resting comfortably...

205
00:18:53,234 --> 00:19:00,911
因你毕生牟取暴利 而吐出的致癌物而垂死

206
00:18:53,234 --> 00:19:00,911
...dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed... ...in a lifetime of profiteering.

207
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:07,004
是悲剧性的讽刺 或诗般的正义？你告诉我

208
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:07,004
Tragic irony... ...or poetic justice? You tell me.

209
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:12,736
我的天，是真的 下水道的企鹅人

210
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:12,736
My God, it's true. Penguin Man of the sewer.

211
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:23,363
奇异的是，麦斯 你和我有些共通之处

212
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:23,363
Odd as it may seem, Max... ...you and l have something in common.

213
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:27,416
我们受孕时都如怪物

214
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:27,416
We're both perceived as monsters.

215
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,721
然而...

216
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,721
But somehow...

217
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:41,260
你是个倍受敬重的怪物 而我则不然

218
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:41,260
...you're a well-respected monster... ...and l am, to date... ...not!

219
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,365
老实说，我不以为然 我是个生意人

220
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,365
Frankly, l feel that's a bum rap. l'm a businessman.

221
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:50,873
强硬，对，刻薄，也行 但还不足使我成为怪物

222
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:50,873
Tough, yes. Shrewd, okay. But that does not make me a monster.

223
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:56,012
别糗自己了，麦斯 我对你一清二楚

224
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:56,012
Don't embarrass yourself, Max! l know all about you.

225
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,948
你隐藏，我发掘

226
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,948
What you hide, l discover.

227
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:04,990
你弃于马桶中的 我将它保存起来，明白吗

228
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:04,990
What you put in your toilet... ...l place on my mantle. Get the picture?

229
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,460
那是什么？ 打算对我催眠吗？

230
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,460
ls that supposed to hypnotize me?

231
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,164
不，只是要让你头痛欲裂

232
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,164
Just give you a splitting headache.

233
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:12,338
没有效

234
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:12,338
lt's not working.

235
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:16,971
真没有，只是空包弹

236
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:16,971
Oh, you big baby! Just blanks.

237
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:20,376
今晚我大费周章 只为杀你吗？

238
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:20,376
Would l go through all this trouble just to kill you?

239
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:25,815
不，麦斯 我有个全然不同的目的

240
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:25,815
No, Max. l have an entirely other purpose.

241
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:27,818
我准备好了，麦斯

242
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:27,818
l'm ready, Max.

243
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:30,621
我已在下面太久

244
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:30,621
l've been down here too long.

245
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:33,358
我该上升了

246
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:33,358
lt's time for me to ascend...

247
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,796
重新出现

248
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,796
...to re-emerge...

249
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:39,399
藉着你的帮助

250
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:39,399
...with your help...

251
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:42,937
你的深谙其道，你的机伶

252
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:42,937
...your know-how... ...your savvy.

253
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:46,274
我并非生于下水道

254
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:46,274
l wasn't born in the sewer, you know.

255
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:50,546
我来自...和你一样

256
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:50,546
l come from... ...like you.

257
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:53,617
而和你一样，我要尊重

258
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:53,617
And, like you, l want some respect!

259
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:57,055
得到我的基本人权

260
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:57,055
A recognition of my basic humanity.

261
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,522
但最重要的...

262
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,522
But most of all...

263
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:03,829
我要藉找到我父母 来查出我是谁

264
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:03,829
...l want to find out who l am... ...by finding my parents...

265
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,200
得知我的姓名

266
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,200
...learning my human name.

267
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,827
高谭人视为当然的 简单事物

268
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,827
Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted!

269
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:19,952
我到底为何得帮你？

270
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:19,952
And... ...exactly why am l going to help you? Well....

271
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:26,397
我们开始吧

272
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:26,397
Let's start.

273
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,027
这是什么？

274
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,027
Let's see what we have in here.

275
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:47,178
一些你那干净纺织厂的 有毒废水

276
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:47,178
A batch of toxic waste... ...from your clean textile plant!

277
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,621
这种废物后面有一大池

278
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,621
There's a whole lagoon of this crud in the back!

279
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,290
那可能来自任何地方

280
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,290
lt could be from anywhere.

281
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,030
证明你拥有高谭市 半数易燃建筑的文件呢？

282
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,030
What about the documents that prove you own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?

283
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,199
若有那种文件...

284
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,199
lf there were such documents...

285
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:04,971
而且我不承认有... 我也早已将它们切碎了

286
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:04,971
...that's not an admission... ...they would've been shredded.

287
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:07,225
好主意

288
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:07,225
Good idea.

289
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:14,850
许多胶带和一点耐心 情况便截然不同

290
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:14,850
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.

291
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,582
对了

292
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,582
By the way...

293
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:19,856
你的老合伙人 佛列德亚特金好吗？

294
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:19,856
...how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?

295
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:21,525
佛列德？

296
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:21,525
Fred?

297
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:28,062
我相信他正在度延长假期 他...很好

298
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:28,062
Fred's actually... ...l believe he's on an extended vacation. He's good.

299
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:30,724
他很好

300
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:30,724
Good.

301
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:38,747
你好，麦斯，记得我吗？ 我是佛列德的手

302
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:38,747
Hiya, Max. Remember me? l'm Fred's hand!

303
00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:41,651
要向其他部份肢体致意吗

304
00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:41,651
Want to greet any other body parts?

305
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:46,522
记住 你摒弃的，我珍惜

306
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:46,522
Remember, Max... ...you flush it, l flaunt it.

307
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:50,864
你知道吗，企鹅先生

308
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:50,864
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?

309
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:59,940
我想或许...我能协助你 筹划一个欢迎返乡的策略

310
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:59,940
l think, perhaps... ...l could help orchestrate a ''Welcome Home'' scenario for you.

311
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,512
等我们俩都回到家 或许我们能互相帮助

312
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,512
Once back home, perhaps we could help each other.

313
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:09,068
你不会后悔的 许瑞克先生

314
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:09,068
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

315
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:17,402
亲爱的，我回来了

316
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:17,402
Honey, l'm home!

317
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:21,411
我忘了，我未婚

318
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:21,411
Oh, l forgot. l'm not married.

319
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:33,350
猫咪小姐

320
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:33,350
Miss Kitty.

321
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:39,134
从你拒绝分享的 性胡闹活动归来了吗

322
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:39,134
Back from more sexual escapades you refuse to share?

323
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:42,267
不是我爱刺探

324
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:42,267
Not that l'd ever pry.

325
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:46,559
喝你的晚餐吧

326
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:46,559
Drink your dinner.

327
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:53,320
什么？

328
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:53,320
What?

329
00:23:54,707 --> 00:23:57,412
怎么会有人如此可悲？

330
00:23:54,707 --> 00:23:57,412
How can anyone be so pathetic?

331
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,548
对，对你而言我是可悲

332
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,548
Yes, to you l seem pathetic. But l'm a working girl.

333
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:02,034
但我是个上班女郎 得付房租

334
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:07,419
你若能贡献点生活费 而不要开溜就好了

335
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:07,419
Must pay the rent. Maybe if you chipped in instead of stepping out.

336
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:09,492
瑟琳娜亲爱的，是妈

337
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:09,492
Selina, dear, it's your mother.

338
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:11,379
只是打电话问候你一下 对，但是...

339
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:11,379
Just calling to say hello. Yeah, but...

340
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:15,800
但是我很失望 你不回家过圣诞节

341
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:15,800
But l'm disappointed you're not coming home for Christmas.

342
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,168
我要和你讨论

343
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,168
l want to discuss why you insist on languishing in Gotham City...

344
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:21,774
你为何要像低级秘书般 坚持要在高谭市受折磨

345
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:21,774
...as some lowly secretary.

346
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,826
是低级助理

347
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,826
Lowly assistant.

348
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:29,617
瑟琳娜，记得我们的 圣诞出游计划吗？

349
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:29,617
Selina, about that Christmas getaway we planned...

350
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:31,386
我将要独自去

351
00:24:29,617 --> 00:24:31,386
l'm going alone.

352
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:36,107
萧博士说我需要独处 而非附属品

353
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:36,107
Dr. Shaw says l need to be my own person, not an appendage.

354
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:41,434
真是个附属品

355
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:41,434
Some appendage!

356
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:51,766
瑟琳娜凯尔的答录机盛宴 永不停息

357
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:51,766
The party never stops on Selina Kyle's answering machine.

358
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:55,449
看来上次打板球时 我该让他赢的

359
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:55,449
l should've let him win that last racquetball game.

360
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:58,253
哈，瑟琳娜凯尔

361
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:58,253
Hello... ...Selina Kyle.

362
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:01,890
我们要告诉你有种新的 高谭女士香水

363
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:01,890
We're calling to tell you about exciting new Gotham Lady perfume.

364
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:07,560
它会使女人感觉像女人 而且男人不会有抱怨

365
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:07,560
lt makes women feel like women... and the men have no complaints either.

366
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:11,201
嗨，瑟琳娜，这是你自己 真蠢

367
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:11,201
Hi Selina

368
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:13,537
提醒你，你得回办公室去

369
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:13,537
This is yourself reminding you to come all the way back to the office...

370
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:16,608
除非你记得带 布鲁斯韦恩的档案回家

371
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:16,608
-...if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file--

372
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:18,516
因为会议在周三 你这个笨蛋

373
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:18,516
-You stupid corn dog!

374
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:21,482
（许瑞克百货公司）

375
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,672
加班吗？

376
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,672
Working late?

377
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:47,447
我只是在帮你预备明早 和布鲁斯韦恩开会的资料

378
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:47,447
l'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.

379
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:51,751
我调出发电厂企划案的 所有档案和...

380
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:51,751
l pulled all of the files on the proposed power plant...

381
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:55,891
预备请韦恩先生 投资的文件

382
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:55,891
...and Mr. Wayne's investment.

383
00:25:55,891 --> 00:26:00,683
我甚至打开了保护档 多勤奋啊

384
00:25:55,891 --> 00:26:00,683
l even opened the protected files--How industrious!

385
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:04,934
你是如何打开保护档的

386
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:04,934
How did you open the protected files?

387
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:07,675
我能问吗？

388
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:07,675
May l ask?

389
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:18,945
我想你的密码是吉拉多 你的吉娃娃的名字

390
00:26:11,543 --> 00:26:18,945
l figured your password was ''Geraldo,'' your chihuahua, and it was.

391
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:26,161
这实在非常有趣

392
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:26,161
This is all very interesting,

393
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:29,699
虽然在技术上有一点难懂

394
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:29,699
though a bit on the technical side...

395
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:34,571
我是指发电厂 如何只在名义上是发电厂

396
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:34,571
...about how the power plant is a power plant in name only...

397
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:40,349
而事实上，它将是个 巨大的容电器？

398
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:40,349
...since, in fact, it's going to be a big, giant... ...big, giant...capacitor.

399
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:47,053
它不会产电力 反而会吸收高谭市的...

400
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:47,053
And, instead of generating power, it'll be sucking power from...

401
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:52,333
电力，并贮存起来

402
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:52,333
...Gotham City... ...and storing it...

403
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,234
囤积它

404
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,234
...stockpiling it...

405
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:59,958
我得说那是个 非常新奇的方式

406
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:59,958
...which is a very novel approach, l'd say.

407
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,647
那你会将此事告诉谁？

408
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,647
Who'd you say this to?

409
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:06,863
没有人

410
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:06,863
Nobody.

411
00:27:12,452 --> 00:27:17,280
好奇会使猫如何呢？

412
00:27:12,452 --> 00:27:17,280
What did curiosity do to the cat?

413
00:27:18,192 --> 00:27:23,665
我不是猫 我只是个助理，一个秘书

414
00:27:18,192 --> 00:27:23,665
l'm no cat. l'm just an assistant. A secretary.

415
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:26,469
而且是非常好的一个

416
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:26,469
And a very good one.

417
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:28,771
太好了

418
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:28,771
Too good?

419
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:32,544
听着，那是我们的秘密 真的

420
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:32,544
Listen... ...it's our secret. Honest.

421
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:36,948
你怎能对一个无意义的人 如此残忍？

422
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:36,948
How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless? This power plant...

423
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:41,621
这发电厂将是我的传家宝 是我遗留下来的

424
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:41,621
...is my legacy. lt's what l leave behind. For Chip.

425
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:45,784
留给奇普 任何事都无法阻止

426
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:45,784
Nothing must prevent that.

427
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:47,766
好，动手吧

428
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:47,766
OK,Go ahead.

429
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:52,268
恐吓我，欺压我 若能使你觉得强大

430
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:52,268
lntimidate me. Bully me, if it makes you feel big.

431
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:54,771
反正你又不可能杀了我

432
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:54,771
lt's not like you can kill me!

433
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:59,113
事实上就有可能

434
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:59,113
Actually, it's a lot like that.

435
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:08,741
什么？

436
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:08,741
What?

437
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,189
什么？

438
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,189
What?

439
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:18,678
你知道，有那么一秒 你真的吓到我了

440
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:18,678
For a second, you really frightened me.

441
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,525
真的吗？

442
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,525
Really?!

443
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:47,989
亲爱的，我回来了

444
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:47,989
Honey, l'm home!

445
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:52,803
我忘了，我未婚

446
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:52,803
Oh, l forgot. l'm not married.

447
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:31,795
瑟琳娜，我是妈 打电话给我

448
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:31,795
Selina, this is your mother. Call me.

449
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:36,173
瑟琳娜，我是妈 你为何没回我电话

450
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:36,173
Selina, this is your mother. Why haven't you called me back?

451
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,739
哈，瑟琳娜凯尔

452
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,739
Hello, Selina Kyle.

453
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:42,812
我们打电话，是想确定 你已试用过高谭女士香水

454
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:42,812
We're just calling to make sure you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.

455
00:30:42,812 --> 00:30:46,649
在办公室只要喷一下 你老板会要你下班留下

456
00:30:42,812 --> 00:30:46,649
One whiff of this and your boss will ask you to stay after work...

457
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:49,820
开二人烛光员工会议

458
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:49,820
...for a candlelight staff meeting for two.

459
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,458
高谭女士香水 许瑞克百货公司仅售

460
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,458
Gotham Lady perfume. Exclusively at Shreck's department store.

461
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:54,561
不！

462
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:54,561
No

463
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:41,032
我不知道你觉得如何 猫咪小姐

464
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:41,032
l don't know about you, Miss Kitty, but l feel...

465
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:44,259
但我觉得...可口多了

466
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:44,259
...so much yummier.

467
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,876
女士先生们

468
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,876
Ladies and gentlemen;

469
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:08,199
我再度在你们面前

470
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:08,199
l stand before you again to denounce the urban chaos

471
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,804
遣责似乎与我们共存于 这伟大城市的都市紊乱

472
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,804
we live with in our city.

473
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:13,953
它得停止 也定能得阻止

474
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:13,953
lt's got to stop.lt's going to stop!

475
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:20,414
在这应该聚合的时节

476
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:20,414
Our community is coming apart... ...in a season when it should be coming together.

477
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:23,618
我们的社区正在崩离 我不在乎批评者会怎么说

478
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:23,618
l don't care what the cynics may say. This is the Christmas season...

479
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:26,855
现在是圣诞时节 应该是愈合的时候

480
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:26,855
...and should be a healing time.

481
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:32,329
我不只以官员的身份声明 更以丈夫与父亲的立场说

482
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:32,329
l say that not only as an official... ...but as a husband and a father.

483
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:35,840
昨晚的暴行不会再发生

484
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:35,840
Last night's violence won't happen again.

485
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:41,659
我不太善于言词 因此我只能说，谢了

486
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:41,659
l'm not good at speeches, so l'll just say, ''Thanks.''

487
00:34:49,717 --> 00:34:52,153
天，是可怕的企鹅人

488
00:34:49,717 --> 00:34:52,153
lt's the hideous Penguin Man.

489
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:55,379
来，孩子带走 但请别伤害我的孩子

490
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:55,379
Just don't hurt my baby, please.

491
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:52,227
这是数分钟前在高谭广场 发生的非凡情况

492
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:52,227
This was the remarkable scene only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.

493
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:57,968
神秘的企鹅解救市长之子 并宣布他的存在

494
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:57,968
The mysterious Penguin saving the life of the Mayor's baby -then announcing his presence.

495
00:35:57,968 --> 00:36:05,424
我要的回报 是找到我父母的机会

496
00:35:57,968 --> 00:36:05,424
-All l want in return...is a chance...to find my Mom and Dad.

497
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:10,150
一个查出他们是谁...

498
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:10,150
A chance to find out who they are...

499
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,721
及我是谁的机会

500
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,721
...and thusly... ...who l am.

501
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:18,093
然后，由我父母处

502
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:18,093
And then... ...with my parents...

503
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,797
设法了解为什么...

504
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,797
...try to understand...why.

505
00:36:21,797 --> 00:36:27,672
为何他们做出 他们觉得非做不可的事

506
00:36:21,797 --> 00:36:27,672
Why they did what l guess they felt they had to do...

507
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:29,974
对一个孩子...

508
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:29,974
...to a child...

509
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:36,662
一个生来有点不同的孩子

510
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:36,662
...who was born... ...a little different.

511
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:43,457
一个在下水道渡过 第一个圣诞节...

512
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:43,457
A child... ...who spent his first Christmas...

513
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:48,231
及其后许多个...的孩子

514
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:48,231
...and many since... ...in a sewer.

515
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:54,271
韦恩先生？有何不对吗？ 没有

516
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:54,271
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?

517
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:55,372
他的父母

518
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:55,372
His parents.

519
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:58,743
再度说明 本画面直接拍自高谭广场

520
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:58,743
This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.

521
00:36:58,743 --> 00:37:00,912
但愿他找到他们

522
00:36:58,743 --> 00:37:00,912
l hope he finds them.

523
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:09,249
他在那里，站在高谭市 领导人物麦斯许瑞克旁边

524
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:05,080
There he is, standing alongside Gotham's leading citizen,

525
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,249
Max Shreck. How about a statement? People want to know.

526
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:12,664
（档案室）

527
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,806
企鹅不能受打扰 档案室是公共场所

528
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,806
-Penguin's not to be disturbed! -lt's a public place!

529
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:25,676
你违反宪法第一修正案 妨碍新闻自由    走开

530
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:25,676
-Walk. Now. Move. -Freedom of the press!

531
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,515
等一下

532
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,515
Wait a minute.

533
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:34,387
那尊严隐密的 重新发掘你的根的自由呢

534
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:34,387
What about the freedom to rediscover your roots... ...with dignity in privacy?

535
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:37,024
怎么，许瑞克先生 企鹅是你的私人好友吗？

536
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:37,024
ls the Penguin a personal friend?

537
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:40,828
是，他是全市的私人好友 因此，发发慈悲吧

538
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:40,828
He's a personal friend of the whole city, so have a heart.

539
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:44,469
让宪法休息一下，好吗 现在是圣诞时期

540
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:44,469
Give the Constitution a rest. lt's Christmas.

541
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,365
“红三角马戏团 推出猛狮精彩表演”

542
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,365
''Red Triangle Circus put on a swell show with fierce lions.

543
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:37,930
“马戏团回来表演两周 孩子们会爱...”谢谢

544
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:37,930
''Circus returns for two weeks-- ''Kids will love--'' Thanks.

545
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:44,808
是冷的 是马铃薯奶油浓汤，先生

546
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:44,808
Cold! lt's vichyssoise.

547
00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:47,405
本来就该是冷的

548
00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:47,405
lt's supposed to be cold.

549
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:52,985
“马戏团带着畸型人回来 可能不适小孩观看”

550
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:52,985
''Circus is back with a freak show. May not be suitable for kids.

551
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:55,121
“有狮子狗女士...”

552
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:55,121
''Featuring a poodle lady...

553
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:59,682
“世上最快的人 和极地鸟男孩”

554
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:59,682
''...the world's fattest man... ''...and Aquatic Bird Boy.''

555
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,383
你为何决心证明 这个企鹅所言不实

556
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,383
Why are you determined to prove... ...that this Penguin is not what he seems?

557
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:10,473
你一定得当全城 唯一的“人兽”吗？

558
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:10,473
Must you be the only lonely ''man-beast'' in town?

559
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,444
“在数个城镇发生无数 儿童失踪案件后”

560
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,444
''Circus folded its tents yesterday... ''

561
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:15,609
“马戏团昨天收起帐篷 也许永远不能再演出”

562
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:15,609
...after reports of missing children in several towns.

563
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:19,384
警方已关闭红三角表演场

564
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:19,384
''Police have closed down the Red Triangle's fairgrounds.

565
00:39:19,384 --> 00:39:25,577
然而至少一名畸型表演者 在接受侦讯前失踪了

566
00:39:19,384 --> 00:39:25,577
''However, at least one freak show performer vanished before... ''...he could be questioned.''

567
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:29,746
我想你觉得好多了，先生

568
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:29,746
l suppose you feel better now.

569
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:33,123
没有

570
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:33,123
No.

571
00:39:34,102 --> 00:39:36,948
事实上，我觉得更糟

572
00:39:34,102 --> 00:39:36,948
Actually, l feel worse.

573
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:56,197
你为何还在外面

574
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:56,197
Why're you still out?

575
00:39:56,197 --> 00:40:01,502
你是在关心那个奇怪 英雄般的企鹅人物吗

576
00:39:56,197 --> 00:40:01,502
Are you concerned about that strange, heroic Penguin person?

577
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:05,774
我想他知道他父母是谁

578
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:05,774
l think he knows who his parents are.

579
00:40:05,774 --> 00:40:07,956
他另有所图

580
00:40:05,774 --> 00:40:07,956
There's something else.

581
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:08,873
企鹅先生... 企鹅是不会飞的鸟

582
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:08,873
Mr. Penguin... A penguin is a bird that cannot fly!

583
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,775
我是个人

584
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,775
l am a man!

585
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:14,425
我有名字

586
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:14,425
l have a name!

587
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:21,493
奥兹瓦卡伯波特

588
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:21,493
Oswald Cobblepot!

589
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:27,246
卡伯波特先生 你永无机会与父母和解了

590
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:27,246
You'll never be able to settle with them?

591
00:42:27,483 --> 00:42:29,073
没错

592
00:42:27,483 --> 00:42:29,073
True.

593
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:32,490
我是他们的长子

594
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:32,490
l was their ''Number One'' son...

595
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:35,826
他们却视我如粪土

596
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:35,826
...and they treated me like number two.

597
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:41,377
但害怕非自然之物是人性

598
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:41,377
But it's human nature to fear... ...the unusual.

599
00:42:42,301 --> 00:42:51,079
也许当我用晶亮的鳍 拿着我的宝贵婴儿玩具

600
00:42:42,301 --> 00:42:51,079
Perhaps... ...when l held my... ...Tiffany baby rattle... ...with a shiny flipper...

601
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:55,251
而非五根胖手指时

602
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:55,251
...instead of five chubby digits...

603
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:57,824
他们惊怕了

604
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:57,824
...they freaked.

605
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:04,228
但我原谅他们

606
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:04,228
But l forgive them.

607
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:07,433
企鹅原谅父母 “我对自己与世界 都感到平和”

608
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:07,433
Penguin forgives parents! ''l'm at peace with myself and the world! ''

609
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:09,902
“只要有心 便不需要手”

610
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:09,902
''Don't need hands as long as you got heart.''

611
00:43:09,902 --> 00:43:13,173
“我的心充满爱 我觉得有五尺高”

612
00:43:09,902 --> 00:43:13,173
''My heart is filled with love. l feel five feet tall.''

613
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:17,277
他像只变成王子的青蛙 不，他更像只企鹅

614
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:17,277
-He's like a frog that became a prince. -No, he's more like a penguin.

615
00:43:23,052 --> 00:43:26,289
好了，漂亮的小东西 乖乖听话

616
00:43:23,052 --> 00:43:26,289
Now, now, pretty little thing.

617
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:29,385
我最喜欢高大强壮

618
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:29,385
Nice and easy.

619
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:36,462
又不怕对体型小一半的人 展现力量的人

620
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:36,462
l just love a big man who's not afraid to show it with someone half his size.

621
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:42,012
温柔待我 这是我的第一次

622
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:42,012
Be gentle, it's my first time.

623
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:50,167
井字游戏

624
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:50,167
Tic, tac, toe.

625
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:58,696
对了，我... 你使自己容易受害

626
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:58,696
You make it easy, don't you?

627
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:03,737
总是等着蝙蝠侠来救你

628
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:03,737
Always waiting for some Batman to save you.

629
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:06,304
我是猫女

630
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:06,304
l am Catwoman...

631
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:09,041
听我怒吼

632
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:09,041
...hear me roar.

633
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:26,697
我想请你喝咖啡 但我的助理正在休假

634
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:26,697
l'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.

635
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,933
好时机，反正过年之前

636
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,933
Good time. Everyone but

637
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:32,171
除了拦路大盗 大家都会减少活动

638
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:32,171
the bandits'll be slacking off till after New Year.

639
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:34,606
我不确定是否喜欢 你的推论，布鲁斯

640
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:34,606
Not sure l like the inference.

641
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:37,596
抱歉，麦斯 未发觉我有做推论

642
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:37,596
Didn't realize l made one.

643
00:44:40,915 --> 00:44:45,687
我现在促销发电厂计划 因为将来花费将更高

644
00:44:40,915 --> 00:44:45,687
l'm pushing this power plant now because it'll cost more later.

645
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:48,858
省一百万等于赚一百万

646
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:48,858
A million saved is a million earned.

647
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:52,749
我做了这份报告 也许你想看看

648
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:52,749
l commissioned this report. Take a look at it.

649
00:44:53,897 --> 00:44:57,001
麦斯，重点是 高谭市已供电过量

650
00:44:53,897 --> 00:44:57,001
Gotham City has a power surplus.

651
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:58,537
我确信你知道

652
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:58,537
l'm sure you know that.

653
00:44:58,537 --> 00:45:02,108
我的问题是... 你的目的为何？

654
00:44:58,537 --> 00:45:02,108
My question is... ...what's your angle?

655
00:45:02,108 --> 00:45:05,453
供电过量？布鲁斯 你该惭愧，没那回事

656
00:45:02,108 --> 00:45:05,453
Power surplus? Bruce, shame on you!

657
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,982
电力再多都不为过

658
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,982
No such thing. One can never have too much power.

659
00:45:08,982 --> 00:45:12,654
我的生命若有何意义 那就是意义

660
00:45:08,982 --> 00:45:12,654
lf my life has a meaning, that's the meaning.

661
00:45:12,654 --> 00:45:14,656
我将与你唱反调

662
00:45:12,654 --> 00:45:14,656
l'll fight you.

663
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:18,294
我已和市长谈过 我们看法一致，因此...

664
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:18,294
l've already spoken to the Mayor and we agree.

665
00:45:18,294 --> 00:45:22,032
市长多如过江之鲫 贵族容易没落

666
00:45:18,294 --> 00:45:22,032
Mayors come and go. Blue bloods tire easily.

667
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:24,879
你以为能和拳王许瑞克 打上十五回合吗？

668
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:24,879
Can you go 15 rounds with Muhammad Shreck?

669
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:26,972
看来得拭目以待

670
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:26,972
l guess we'll find out.

671
00:45:26,972 --> 00:45:29,842
当然，我没有卡伯波特 那种犯罪集团首领支持

672
00:45:26,972 --> 00:45:29,842
Of course, l don't have a crime boss like Cobblepot in my corner.

673
00:45:29,842 --> 00:45:31,396
因此，也许... 犯罪集团首领？

674
00:45:29,842 --> 00:45:31,396
Crime boss?!

675
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,647
证明你知道什么？ 天之骄子先生

676
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,647
Shows what you know...

677
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:38,083
奥兹瓦是高谭的新英雄

678
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:38,083
...Mr. To-the-manor-born- with-a-silver-spoon. Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.

679
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:41,824
他父母若未嫌弃他 你们俩或许会是校舍室友

680
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:41,824
lf his parents hadn't 86'ed him, you'd have been bunkies at prep school.

681
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:44,093
奥兹瓦控制红三角帮

682
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:44,093
He controls the Red Triangle Gang.

683
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:46,061
我还无法证明 但我们都知道...

684
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:46,061
l can't prove it yet, but we both--

685
00:45:46,061 --> 00:45:48,899
韦恩，我不允许办公室内 有揭人隐私之举

686
00:45:46,061 --> 00:45:48,899
l'll not stand for mud-slinging here.

687
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:50,489
我助理若在此

688
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:50,489
lf my assistant was here, she'd have already escorted you out.

689
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,133
早已护送你出去... 到任何他要去之处

690
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,133
Anywhere he wants.

691
00:45:54,238 --> 00:46:02,092
可能是夜总会、岩穴 或隐密的藏身处

692
00:45:54,238 --> 00:46:02,092
Preferably some nightspot grotto... ...or... ...secluded hideaway.

693
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:05,719
好西装 谢谢

694
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:05,719
Nice suit.

695
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:07,629
瑟琳娜

696
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:07,629
Selina

697
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:13,196
瑟琳娜，瑟琳娜 那是我的名字，百万麦斯

698
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:13,196
Selina Selina

699
00:46:13,196 --> 00:46:17,467
别念太多磨坏 否则我要你买个新的赔我

700
00:46:13,196 --> 00:46:17,467
That's my name, don't wear it out or l'll make you buy me a new one.

701
00:46:17,467 --> 00:46:19,091
瑟琳娜

702
00:46:17,467 --> 00:46:19,091
Selina

703
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:23,775
这是布鲁斯...韦恩

704
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:23,775
This is Bruce... ...Wayne.

705
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:25,542
是，我们见过

706
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:25,542
We've met.

707
00:46:25,543 --> 00:46:31,117
有吗？  抱歉 我误以为自己是别人

708
00:46:25,543 --> 00:46:31,117
Have we? No, l'm sorry. l mistook me for somebody else.

709
00:46:31,117 --> 00:46:33,554
你是指我吧？

710
00:46:31,117 --> 00:46:33,554
You mean, ''mistook me.''

711
00:46:33,554 --> 00:46:36,558
我误以为我...对 我是那么说的吗？

712
00:46:33,554 --> 00:46:36,558
lsn't that what l said?

713
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:39,228
不，我想不是

714
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:39,228
l don't think so.

715
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:41,481
怎么回事？

716
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:41,481
What happened?

717
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:46,136
你在滑雪坡上受伤了吗？

718
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:46,136
Did you hurt yourself... on that ski slope?

719
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:50,691
因此你才缩短假期回来？

720
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:50,691
ls that why you cut short your vacation? Came back?

721
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,509
很模糊

722
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,509
lt's a blur.

723
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:55,816
我是说，未完全失去记忆

724
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:55,816
Not complete amnesia.

725
00:46:55,816 --> 00:47:01,856
我记得玛丽玛格丽特修女 在教堂呕吐

726
00:46:55,816 --> 00:47:01,856
l remember Sister Mary Margaret puking in church.

727
00:47:01,856 --> 00:47:03,925
贝西莱利说那是害喜

728
00:47:01,856 --> 00:47:03,925
And Betsy saying it was morning sickness.

729
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:06,662
我也记得有次上学 忘了穿内裤

730
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:06,662
And the time l forgot to wear my underpants to school...

731
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:11,935
而注意到的男孩 名叫瑞奇佛莱伯格

732
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:11,935
...and the name of the boy who noticed was Ricky Friedburg.

733
00:47:11,935 --> 00:47:13,951
他已经死了

734
00:47:11,935 --> 00:47:13,951
He's dead now.

735
00:47:14,038 --> 00:47:17,893
但昨晚却完全模糊

736
00:47:14,038 --> 00:47:17,893
But last night... ...complete blur.

737
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:21,920
很不可思议吧？

738
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:21,920
Couldn't you just die?

739
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:25,318
瑟琳娜

740
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:25,318
Selina

741
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:27,085
拜托

742
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:27,085
Please...

743
00:47:27,588 --> 00:47:29,924
送韦恩先生出去

744
00:47:27,588 --> 00:47:29,924
...show out Mr. Wayne.

745
00:47:29,924 --> 00:47:31,277
乐意之至

746
00:47:29,924 --> 00:47:31,277
With pleasure.

747
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:36,540
你的外套，韦恩先生

748
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:36,540
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.

749
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:52,953
你不像是会和 许瑞克先生做生意的人

750
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:52,953
You don't seem like the type who does business with Shreck.

751
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,923
你也不像是 会服从他的命令的人

752
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,923
Nor you, the type to take orders from him. Well, that's a...

753
00:47:56,923 --> 00:48:02,618
说来话长 我可以腾出一些时间

754
00:47:56,923 --> 00:48:02,618
...long story. l could free up some time.

755
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:07,937
我的电话有登记 我受诱惑  我得工作

756
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:07,937
-l'm listed. -l'm tempted. l'm working.

757
00:48:07,937 --> 00:48:09,005
我要走了

758
00:48:07,937 --> 00:48:09,005
l'm leaving.

759
00:48:09,939 --> 00:48:13,377
爸，你相信她说的吗？ 女人

760
00:48:09,939 --> 00:48:13,377
You buy that blurry business? Women.

761
00:48:13,377 --> 00:48:18,250
除了你已逝的母亲 任何事我都不讶异，奇普

762
00:48:13,377 --> 00:48:18,250
Nothing surprises me. Except your late mother.

763
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,921
谁会想到瑟琳娜 竟有能毁坏的脑袋

764
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,921
Who'd have thought Selina had a brain to damage?

765
00:48:21,921 --> 00:48:25,426
最坏结果吗？ 她企图勒索我

766
00:48:21,921 --> 00:48:25,426
Bottom line? She tries to blackmail me,

767
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:31,194
我将她推出更高的窗 此时，我有更重要的事

768
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:31,194
l'll drop her out of a higher window.Meantime l've got badder fish to fry.

769
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:45,980
奥兹瓦，我是麦斯

770
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:45,980
Oswald... ...it's Max.

771
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:00,995
你在家吗？

772
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:00,995
You're home?

773
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,602
你好吗？

774
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,602
How you been?

775
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:14,871
你的家人，有家庭真好

776
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:14,871
Your extended family. Good to have a family.

777
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:19,292
我现在宁可不受打扰

778
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:19,292
l'd rather not be disturbed now.

779
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,563
下楼，奥兹瓦 我要给你一个惊喜

780
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,563
Come on downstairs, Oswald. l have a surprise.

781
00:49:22,563 --> 00:49:25,303
我不喜欢惊喜

782
00:49:22,563 --> 00:49:25,303
l don't like surprises.

783
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,014
下来吧

784
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,014
Come on.

785
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:56,889
别偷看

786
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:56,889
Don't peek.

787
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:01,017
你会破坏惊喜的

788
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:01,017
You'll spoil it.

789
00:50:23,505 --> 00:50:27,209
对，奉承是个重担 我很清楚

790
00:50:23,505 --> 00:50:27,209
Adulation is a cross to bear. God knows l know.

791
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:31,449
但在进步的道路上 有人得代替我们的名气

792
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:31,449
But someone's got to supplant our standing in the way of progress.

793
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:34,519
别否认，卡伯波特先生 你有那种魔力

794
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:34,519
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic.

795
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:38,932
你的非凡魅力远胜我们 下来吧

796
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:38,932
Your charisma's bigger than both of us. Come on down.

797
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:42,368
市长

798
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:42,368
Mayor.

799
00:50:43,531 --> 00:50:46,413
市长，麦斯

800
00:50:43,531 --> 00:50:46,413
Mayor.

801
00:50:46,634 --> 00:50:50,272
十一月选举 现在不是才十二月末吗

802
00:50:46,634 --> 00:50:50,272
Elections happen in November. lt's late December.

803
00:50:50,272 --> 00:50:51,673
不用担心

804
00:50:50,272 --> 00:50:51,673
Don't worry.

805
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:56,644
我要你见珍和乔希 我的形象顾问

806
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:56,644
l want you to meet Jen and Josh, my image consultants.

807
00:50:57,213 --> 00:51:01,211
来，拾回你天生的权利

808
00:50:57,213 --> 00:51:01,211
Here. Reclaim your birthright.

809
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:06,257
我是珍，嗨

810
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:06,257
l'm Jen.

811
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:08,761
好，我看看

812
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:08,761
Okay, let's see.

813
00:51:08,761 --> 00:51:12,766
首先我要做的是 将这些小手套戴在你手上

814
00:51:08,761 --> 00:51:12,766
What l'd like to do first is put these gloves on you.

815
00:51:12,766 --> 00:51:16,003
我们的研究显示 我们的选民喜欢手指

816
00:51:12,766 --> 00:51:16,003
Our research tells us that voters like fingers.

817
00:51:16,003 --> 00:51:19,680
因此，若将它藏起来 我们...

818
00:51:16,003 --> 00:51:19,680
So if we were to just lose this....

819
00:51:19,807 --> 00:51:22,310
我们改天再戴，好吗？

820
00:51:19,807 --> 00:51:22,310
We'll do it another time.

821
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:28,200
下水道没多少 能反光的平面，对吧？

822
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:28,200
Not a lot of reflective surfaces in the sewer, huh?

823
00:51:38,431 --> 00:51:44,754
不过，原可能更糟 我的鼻子可能血流不止

824
00:51:38,431 --> 00:51:44,754
Still, could be worse. My nose could be gushing blood.

825
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:49,044
你的鼻子可能...

826
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:49,044
What do you mean by that?

827
00:51:49,044 --> 00:51:51,547
所有人回去工作

828
00:51:49,044 --> 00:51:51,547
Everybody, back to work!

829
00:51:55,418 --> 00:52:00,694
我们来创造一个市长

830
00:51:55,418 --> 00:52:00,694
Let's make... ...a mayor!

831
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,503
说得对，我们错过 正常排定的选举

832
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,503
You're right, we missed the regular election...

833
00:52:09,503 --> 00:52:12,439
但当选官员可以改选 弹劾

834
00:52:09,503 --> 00:52:12,439
...but elected officials can be recalled.

835
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:15,310
罢黜，像尼克森

836
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:15,310
Given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.

837
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:20,182
艾格纽，再想想你 奥兹瓦卡伯波特填补其位

838
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:20,182
Then think of you... ...Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.

839
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:23,064
我倒想填补她

840
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:23,064
l'd like to fill her void.

841
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:29,527
我们需要签名以促成改选 那些我能供应，奥兹瓦

842
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:29,527
We'll need signatures to overturn the ballot. l can supply those.

843
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:31,563
教她我的法国鳍把戏

844
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:31,563
-Teach her my French flipper trick.

845
00:52:31,563 --> 00:52:34,824
奥兹瓦 我们还需要一样东西

846
00:52:31,563 --> 00:52:34,824
-We need one more thing.

847
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:37,477
一块踏板吗？

848
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:37,477
A platform?

849
00:52:38,673 --> 00:52:41,843
停止环球温室效应 开始环球冷却效应

850
00:52:38,673 --> 00:52:41,843
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.

851
00:52:41,843 --> 00:52:44,179
使世界成为巨大冰箱

852
00:52:41,843 --> 00:52:44,179
Make the world an icebox.

853
00:52:44,179 --> 00:52:48,451
我喜欢，但要改选市长 需要一个触媒，导火线

854
00:52:44,179 --> 00:52:48,451
l like it. But to get the Mayor recalled, we must have a catalyst.

855
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:51,322
“你做得很好 卡伯波特市长”

856
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:51,322
''You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot.''

857
00:52:51,322 --> 00:52:54,558
“你的餐桌准备好了 卡伯波特市长”

858
00:52:51,322 --> 00:52:54,558
''Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot.''

859
00:52:54,558 --> 00:52:59,197
“我需要你，奥兹瓦 我现在就需要你”

860
00:52:54,558 --> 00:52:59,197
''l need you, Oswald. l need you now.''

861
00:52:59,197 --> 00:53:02,744
“那是我见过最大的伞”

862
00:52:59,197 --> 00:53:02,744
''That's the biggest parasol l've ever seen.''

863
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:10,064
很快就会发生东京湾意外 及雷斯塔格大火之类事件

864
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:10,064
Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin, or the Reichstag fire...

865
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:21,825
你要我上面的老朋友 使市长发狂吗？  正是

866
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:21,825
You want my old friends up there... ...to drive the Mayor into a foaming frenzy?

867
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:24,878
听来很好玩

868
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:24,878
-Exactly. -Sounds fun. But...

869
00:53:25,263 --> 00:53:28,745
但我不能分神，麦斯 我有我的正事要办

870
00:53:25,263 --> 00:53:28,745
...l mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.

871
00:53:28,745 --> 00:53:31,838
分神，奥兹瓦？

872
00:53:28,745 --> 00:53:31,838
l have my own things to tend to.

873
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:33,674
现在你有机会实现

874
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:33,674
Sidetracked? This is your chance to fulfill a destiny...

875
00:53:33,674 --> 00:53:37,873
这是被你父母 草率抛弃的天命

876
00:53:33,674 --> 00:53:37,873
...your parents carelessly discarded.

877
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,754
你是指重拾我天生权利

878
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,754
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?

879
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:47,824
试想身为市长后 你将得到媒体的注意

880
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:47,824
lmagine, as Mayor, you have the ear of the media...

881
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:53,067
企业大亨将尊重你的意见 无限嬉闹

882
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:53,067
...access to the captains of industry... ...unlimited poontang.

883
00:53:56,068 --> 00:53:59,773
你的条件很诱人，麦斯

884
00:53:56,068 --> 00:53:59,773
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.

885
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:02,098
好吧，我就当市长

886
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:02,098
All right, l'll be Mayor.

887
00:54:05,313 --> 00:56:07,415
烧吧，宝贝，烧吧！

888
00:54:05,313 --> 00:56:07,415
Burn, baby, burn! !

889
00:56:49,415 --> 00:56:52,052
她是谁？ 她是什么？

890
00:56:49,415 --> 00:56:52,052
-Who is she? -What is she?

891
00:56:52,052 --> 00:56:55,789
我不知道是要开火 或坠入爱河

892
00:56:52,052 --> 00:56:55,789
l don't know whether to open fire or fall in love.

893
00:56:55,789 --> 00:57:00,765
可怜虫 手枪和私处老是搞不清楚

894
00:56:55,789 --> 00:57:00,765
You poor guys. Always confusing your pistols with your privates.

895
00:57:03,132 --> 00:57:05,869
别伤害我们，小姐 我们的薪水不到三百块

896
00:57:03,132 --> 00:57:05,869
Don't hurt us. Our take-home's under 300.

897
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:08,407
薪水太高了，滚吧

898
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:08,407
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

899
00:57:26,161 --> 00:57:27,750
尽管打我吧

900
00:57:26,161 --> 00:57:27,750
Go ahead and hit me.

901
00:58:06,544 --> 00:58:09,498
欣赏你的作品吗？

902
00:58:06,544 --> 00:58:09,498
Admiring your handiwork?

903
00:58:10,615 --> 00:58:13,711
参观暴乱场面

904
00:58:10,615 --> 00:58:13,711
Touring the riot scene.

905
00:58:13,853 --> 00:58:17,886
沉重的评估破坏情况

906
00:58:13,853 --> 00:58:17,886
Gravely assessing the devastation.

907
00:58:18,525 --> 00:58:22,380
尽荣耀的市长职责

908
00:58:18,525 --> 00:58:22,380
Upstanding-Mayor stuff.

909
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,433
你不是市长

910
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,433
You're not Mayor.

911
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,980
世事多变

912
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,980
Things change.

913
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:34,212
你有何企图？

914
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:34,212
What do you want?

915
00:58:34,212 --> 00:58:36,115
好直接

916
00:58:34,212 --> 00:58:36,115
The direct approach.

917
00:58:36,115 --> 00:58:41,714
我欣赏一个戴面具的人 能如此

918
00:58:36,115 --> 00:58:41,714
l admire that in a man with a mask.

919
00:58:43,923 --> 00:58:49,397
你不会真的以为你赢吧

920
00:58:43,923 --> 00:58:49,397
You don't really think you'll win, do you?

921
00:58:49,397 --> 00:58:51,614
世事多变

922
00:58:49,397 --> 00:58:51,614
Things change.

923
00:59:16,063 --> 00:59:19,574
我先看到她的，得走了

924
00:59:16,063 --> 00:59:19,574
l saw her first. Got to fly.

925
01:00:08,027 --> 01:00:11,332
你怎么如此？我是个女人

926
01:00:08,027 --> 01:00:11,332
How could you? l'm a woman!

927
01:00:11,332 --> 01:00:12,992
对不起，我...

928
01:00:11,332 --> 01:00:12,992
l'm sorry.

929
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:32,024
如我所说，我是个女人 不能让人视为理所当然

930
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:32,024
As l was saying, l'm a woman and can't be taken for granted.

931
01:00:32,024 --> 01:00:35,429
人生无常，我也是

932
01:00:32,024 --> 01:00:35,429
Life's a bitch, now so am l.

933
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,950
你是谁？

934
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,950
Who are you?

935
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:56,755
蝙蝠背后是什么人？

936
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:56,755
Who's the man behind the bat?

937
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:59,958
也许你能帮我找出...

938
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:59,958
Maybe you can help me find...

939
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:03,327
在猫背后的女人

940
01:00:59,958 --> 01:01:03,327
...the woman... ...behind the cat.

941
01:01:04,097 --> 01:01:08,331
不，那不是你

942
01:01:04,097 --> 01:01:08,331
No, that's not you.

943
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,829
这才是你

944
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,829
Here you are.

945
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,580
被猫便盒救了一条命

946
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,580
Saved by kitty litter.

947
01:01:34,702 --> 01:01:35,911
混蛋！

948
01:01:34,702 --> 01:01:35,911
Bastard!

949
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:55,094
阿福

950
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:55,094
Alfred...

951
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:58,298
帮我拿消毒软膏来，好吗

952
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:58,298
...bring me some antiseptic ointment.

953
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,038
来了，会痛吗？先生

954
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,038
Coming. Are you in pain, sir?

955
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:04,669
不太会

956
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:04,669
Not really.

957
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:30,410
谢谢... 我或许救了市长的宝贝

958
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:30,410
l may have saved the Mayor's baby...

959
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:36,568
但我拒绝救如婴儿般 束手无策的市长

960
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:36,568
...but l refuse to save a mayor... ...who stood by, helpless as a baby...

961
01:02:36,745 --> 01:02:40,114
使高谭市遭到破坏

962
01:02:36,745 --> 01:02:40,114
...while Gotham was ravaged by a disease...

963
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:45,656
使老鹰童子军 患病成为疯狂小丑

964
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:45,656
...that turned Eagle Scouts into crazed clowns...

965
01:02:45,656 --> 01:02:50,402
快乐的主妇变成猫女 谢谢

966
01:02:45,656 --> 01:02:50,402
...and happy homemakers into catwomen. Thank you.

967
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:57,070
奥兹瓦卡伯波特 吸引高谭市的神秘兽人

968
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:57,070
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast, Thank you.

969
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,988
今天宣布要竞选高谭市长 谢谢

970
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,988
made his bid to run Gotham.

971
01:03:01,176 --> 01:03:05,624
卡伯波特先生 你是年轻人的最佳模范

972
01:03:01,176 --> 01:03:05,624
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest role model a young person could have.

973
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:11,816
你是模范能得到的 最热情年轻人

974
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:11,816
And you're the hottest young person... ...a role model could have.

975
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,939
来

976
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,939
Here.

977
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,335
戴个徽章

978
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,335
Wear a button.

979
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:23,547
让我帮你戴在这里

980
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:23,547
Let me just get it on here.

981
01:03:25,313 --> 01:03:26,701
谢谢你们...

982
01:03:25,313 --> 01:03:26,701
Thank you.

983
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:29,720
谢谢你们...

984
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:29,720
Thank you.

985
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,883
我真的会喜欢上 候选市长这种事

986
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,883
This mayor stuff is not about power, it's about reaching out to people.

987
01:03:34,883 --> 01:03:38,956
非关权力，而是接触人民 触摸人民，抚摸人民

988
01:03:34,883 --> 01:03:38,956
Touching people. Groping people.

989
01:03:38,956 --> 01:03:41,058
企鹅，有个... 我不叫企鹅！

990
01:03:38,956 --> 01:03:41,058
-Penguin-- -My name is not Penguin!

991
01:03:41,058 --> 01:03:43,460
我是奥兹瓦卡伯波特

992
01:03:41,058 --> 01:03:43,460
lt's Oswald Cobblepot.

993
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,315
奥兹瓦，有人要见你

994
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,315
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.

995
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:58,123
正是我在找的女人

996
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:58,123
Just the pussy l've been looking for.

997
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:04,447
这里真冷

998
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:04,447
lt's chilly in here.

999
01:04:05,054 --> 01:04:10,226
我会使你温暖 冷静，奥兹瓦

1000
01:04:05,054 --> 01:04:10,226
l'll warm you. Down, Oswald.

1001
01:04:10,294 --> 01:04:12,597
我们需要谈谈

1002
01:04:10,294 --> 01:04:12,597
We need to talk.

1003
01:04:12,597 --> 01:04:16,602
你瞧 你和我有共通点

1004
01:04:12,597 --> 01:04:16,602
You see... ...you and l have something in common.

1005
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,538
听来很熟悉

1006
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,538
Sounds familiar.

1007
01:04:18,538 --> 01:04:23,644
毁灭的癖好？ 对流行大师的鄙视？

1008
01:04:18,538 --> 01:04:23,644
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for czars of fashion?

1009
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:28,792
等等，别告诉我 赤裸裸的性魅力？

1010
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:28,792
Wait, don't tell me. Naked sexual charisma?

1011
01:04:28,883 --> 01:04:30,864
蝙蝠侠

1012
01:04:28,883 --> 01:04:30,864
Batman.

1013
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:37,060
我们的共同仇敌 药膏中的苍蝇

1014
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:37,060
The thorn in both our sides. The fly in our ointment.

1015
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,756
药膏？

1016
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,756
Ointment?

1017
01:04:39,597 --> 01:04:43,468
我会有气味和无气味的 我会再回来

1018
01:04:39,597 --> 01:04:43,468
l've got scented and unscented. l'll come back later.

1019
01:04:43,468 --> 01:04:48,041
对了，你是登记投票人吗 我是市长候选人

1020
01:04:43,468 --> 01:04:48,041
Perchance, are you a registered voter? l'm a mayoral prospect.

1021
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:53,213
我今天只有一个目的 打倒蝙蝠

1022
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:53,213
l have but one pet cause today. Ban the Bat.

1023
01:04:53,647 --> 01:04:58,487
又是他，没问题 他已经完了，你看

1024
01:04:53,647 --> 01:04:58,487
Oh, him again. No bother. He's already history. Check it out.

1025
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:04,328
我们要拆开他的蝙蝠车 将它变成活动氢弹

1026
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:04,328
We'll disassemble his Batmobile and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.

1027
01:05:04,328 --> 01:05:06,231
不，不

1028
01:05:04,328 --> 01:05:06,231
No,

1029
01:05:06,231 --> 01:05:09,033
他的力量比殉教者还大

1030
01:05:06,231 --> 01:05:09,033
He'd have even more power as a martyr.

1031
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:10,535
要消灭蝙蝠侠

1032
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:10,535
To destroy Batman, we must

1033
01:05:10,535 --> 01:05:14,006
首先得将他变成 他最痛恨的人

1034
01:05:10,535 --> 01:05:14,006
first turn him into what he hates the most.

1035
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:16,367
意即，我们

1036
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:16,367
Namely, us.

1037
01:05:17,244 --> 01:05:18,979
你是指陷害他？

1038
01:05:17,244 --> 01:05:18,979
Frame him?

1039
01:05:18,979 --> 01:05:22,620
还没上任就有黑名单了？

1040
01:05:18,979 --> 01:05:22,620
Not even in office yet and already an enemies list.

1041
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:28,160
那些名字不能任人窥探

1042
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:28,160
Those names are not for prying eyes.

1043
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:32,362
我为何要信任一个猫女？

1044
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:32,362
Why should l trust some catbroad anyway?

1045
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:35,967
也许你只是个 心理不平衡的名媛

1046
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:35,967
Maybe you're a screwed-up sorority chick getting back at daddy...

1047
01:05:35,967 --> 01:05:43,227
为父亲未在十六岁时 买那只小马而生报复之心

1048
01:05:35,967 --> 01:05:43,227
...for not buying her that pony when she turned 16.

1049
01:05:57,493 --> 01:06:01,657
好鸟，对

1050
01:05:57,493 --> 01:06:01,657
Nice birdie.

1051
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:18,229
好猫...

1052
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:18,229
Nice kitty. Nice kitty.

1053
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,663
蝙蝠侠伤了我的手臂

1054
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,663
Batman napalmed my arm.

1055
01:06:27,663 --> 01:06:31,401
在我才开始满意自己时 就害我跌落谷底

1056
01:06:27,663 --> 01:06:31,401
He knocked me off a building just when l started to feel good about myself.

1057
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:35,992
我要在他坠落时 扮演重要角色

1058
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:35,992
l want to play an integral part in his degradation.

1059
01:06:38,344 --> 01:06:42,234
计划正在形成

1060
01:06:38,344 --> 01:06:42,234
A plan is forming.

1061
01:06:48,423 --> 01:06:50,783
我要参加

1062
01:06:48,423 --> 01:06:50,783
l want in.

1063
01:06:52,127 --> 01:06:57,267
想到要害蝙蝠侠 就令我觉得...

1064
01:06:52,127 --> 01:06:57,267
The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all...

1065
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,378
肮脏

1066
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,378
...dirty.

1067
01:07:02,707 --> 01:07:08,271
或许我就在这儿 给自己洗个澡

1068
01:07:02,707 --> 01:07:08,271
Maybe l'll just give myself a bath right here.

1069
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:18,693
我向市长挑战

1070
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:18,693
l challenge the Mayor...

1071
01:07:18,693 --> 01:07:23,466
明晚在高谭广场 重点圣诞树

1072
01:07:18,693 --> 01:07:23,466
...to relight the Christmas tree in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.

1073
01:07:23,466 --> 01:07:24,902
他得证明...

1074
01:07:23,466 --> 01:07:24,902
Sir, shall we change

1075
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:29,174
先生，要换台 看有尊严品味的节目吗

1076
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:29,174
the channel to a program with some dignity and class?

1077
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:32,270
或许可看“爱的连线”

1078
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:32,270
''The Love Connection'' perhaps?

1079
01:07:33,111 --> 01:07:35,915
并非我对市长有信心

1080
01:07:33,111 --> 01:07:35,915
l have no faith in the Mayor.

1081
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:42,589
但我盼望祈祷 蝙蝠侠能出现，维护和平

1082
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:42,589
But l hope and pray... ...that Batman... ...will be present to preserve the peace.

1083
01:07:42,589 --> 01:07:46,338
非常感谢你们，谢谢 狡猾

1084
01:07:42,589 --> 01:07:46,338
Subtle.

1085
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:51,531
你为何如此做？

1086
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:51,531
Why are you doing this?

1087
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:54,072
瑟琳娜？

1088
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:54,072
Selina?

1089
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:00,954
抱歉，我无意吓你 吓我？不，是我在吓自己

1090
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:00,954
Sorry, l didn't mean to scare you. Scare me? l was just scaring myself.

1091
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:08,644
我不明白，但很高兴见你 离开许瑞克，置身俗世中 是

1092
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:08,644
l don't see how, but.... lt's nice to see you in the real world, away from Shreck.

1093
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:11,560
很高兴能在这里

1094
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:11,560
lt's nice to be here.

1095
01:08:13,963 --> 01:08:15,552
你没事吧？

1096
01:08:13,963 --> 01:08:15,552
You okay?

1097
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:21,544
你似乎得了假期忧郁症

1098
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:21,544
You look like you have the holiday blues or something.

1099
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:28,681
天，近来的事，真怪异

1100
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:28,681
Boy, the news these days. Weird!

1101
01:08:28,681 --> 01:08:34,488
听电视说估计猫女 重140磅

1102
01:08:28,681 --> 01:08:34,488
l heard on TV that Catwoman weighs 140 pounds.

1103
01:08:34,488 --> 01:08:38,293
不知这些烂记者 晚上怎么睡得着

1104
01:08:34,488 --> 01:08:38,293
How do these hacks sleep at night?

1105
01:08:38,293 --> 01:08:40,628
甚至不精确 蝙蝠侠毁了它

1106
01:08:38,293 --> 01:08:40,628
lt's not even accurate. ''Batman blows it.''

1107
01:08:40,628 --> 01:08:44,701
光是财产损失方面 他可能就救了百万元

1108
01:08:40,628 --> 01:08:44,701
He probably saved millions in property damage.

1109
01:08:44,701 --> 01:08:48,271
你不会是要去看 重新点燃圣诞树吧

1110
01:08:44,701 --> 01:08:48,271
You're not going to the relighting of the tree, are you?

1111
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:51,576
不是，我不想死在那里

1112
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:51,576
l wouldn't be caught dead there.

1113
01:08:51,576 --> 01:08:56,783
今晚将是冷漠城市的 热情之夜

1114
01:08:51,576 --> 01:08:56,783
lt's going to be a hot time on a cold town tonight.

1115
01:08:56,783 --> 01:09:00,487
你有黑暗的一面，对吧？

1116
01:08:56,783 --> 01:09:00,487
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?

1117
01:09:00,487 --> 01:09:03,334
不比你黑暗，布鲁斯

1118
01:09:00,487 --> 01:09:03,334
No darker than yours.

1119
01:09:06,428 --> 01:09:09,498
你何不到我家去 我们可以一起看电视

1120
01:09:06,428 --> 01:09:09,498
Why don't you come over and we can watch it on TV?

1121
01:09:09,498 --> 01:09:10,293
什么？

1122
01:09:09,498 --> 01:09:10,293
The tree-lighting ceremony.

1123
01:09:10,298 --> 01:09:15,733
点树灯仪式 不行，我今晚得到别地

1124
01:09:10,298 --> 01:09:15,733
l can't. l have to be somewhere tonight.

1125
01:09:15,772 --> 01:09:20,812
来吃顿提早的晚餐如何 五点？六点？

1126
01:09:15,772 --> 01:09:20,812
How about coming for dinner at 5? Let's say 6?

1127
01:09:20,812 --> 01:09:24,975
好，五点 五点，你和我，好

1128
01:09:20,812 --> 01:09:24,975
Five. Five. You and me.

1129
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:34,495
树灯熄灭，然后我按钮

1130
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:34,495
The tree lights up and then l push the button.

1131
01:09:34,495 --> 01:09:39,667
不，慢着... 我按钮，然后树灯亮

1132
01:09:34,495 --> 01:09:39,667
Wait, wait. l push the button, then the tree lights up.

1133
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:45,076
你是谁？ 星探

1134
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:45,076
Who are you? Talent scout.

1135
01:09:45,076 --> 01:09:46,911
进来

1136
01:09:45,076 --> 01:09:46,911
Come in.

1137
01:09:46,911 --> 01:09:52,403
你知道，我不是只会点树灯 我还是个女演员

1138
01:09:46,911 --> 01:09:52,403
l don't just light trees. l'm an actress as well.

1139
01:09:52,718 --> 01:09:55,778
那是什么？相机吗？

1140
01:09:52,718 --> 01:09:55,778
What is that thing? A camera or something?

1141
01:09:56,356 --> 01:09:58,159
说“起士”

1142
01:09:56,356 --> 01:09:58,159
Say ''Cheese!''

1143
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:00,585
起士

1144
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:00,585
Cheese.

1145
01:10:12,076 --> 01:10:14,057
谢谢阿福

1146
01:10:12,076 --> 01:10:14,057
Thanks, Alfred.

1147
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:17,464
我确信他是个好...同伴

1148
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:17,464
l'm sure he's wonderful company...

1149
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:22,683
但富有单身汉不觉无聊吗

1150
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:22,683
...but doesn't the gold-plated-bachelor bit get a little stale?

1151
01:10:22,755 --> 01:10:26,360
我猜和寂寞秘书一样

1152
01:10:22,755 --> 01:10:26,360
A lot like the lonely-secretary syndrome, l guess.

1153
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,329
执行助理

1154
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,329
Executive Assistant.

1155
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:30,026
抱歉

1156
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:30,026
Sorry.

1157
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:34,499
秘书

1158
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:34,499
Secretary.

1159
01:10:39,242 --> 01:10:42,338
有女朋友吗？

1160
01:10:39,242 --> 01:10:42,338
Any girlfriend?

1161
01:10:42,846 --> 01:10:44,684
当然

1162
01:10:42,846 --> 01:10:44,684
Sure

1163
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:48,840
你是指...认真的？

1164
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:48,840
You mean, as in serious?

1165
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:53,326
没有，有过一个，不成功 出了什么差错？

1166
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:53,326
Had one, didn't work. What went wrong? Hang on!

1167
01:10:53,326 --> 01:10:55,463
慢着，我想我知道

1168
01:10:53,326 --> 01:10:55,463
l think l know!

1169
01:10:55,463 --> 01:10:59,967
你对她隐瞒秘密？ 不，我将一切告诉她

1170
01:10:55,463 --> 01:10:59,967
You kept things from her. l told her everything.

1171
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:01,650
而那个事实吓到了她？

1172
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:01,650
The truth frightened her?

1173
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,082
有两个事实

1174
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,082
There are two truths...

1175
01:11:05,488 --> 01:11:06,876
你知道吗？

1176
01:11:05,488 --> 01:11:06,876
...you know?

1177
01:11:07,378 --> 01:11:13,555
而她无法调和二者 因为我也无法调和二者

1178
01:11:07,378 --> 01:11:13,555
She had trouble reconciling them because l had trouble... ...reconciling them.

1179
01:11:14,419 --> 01:11:15,522
是

1180
01:11:14,419 --> 01:11:15,522
Yes

1181
01:11:18,124 --> 01:11:20,271
若维琪以为... 维琪？

1182
01:11:18,124 --> 01:11:20,271
Vicki thought-- Vicki?

1183
01:11:21,128 --> 01:11:23,145
溜冰好手或空姐？

1184
01:11:21,128 --> 01:11:23,145
lce skater or stewardess?

1185
01:11:24,732 --> 01:11:27,993
不，她是个摄影记者

1186
01:11:24,732 --> 01:11:27,993
No, she was a photojournalist.

1187
01:11:28,603 --> 01:11:33,051
对你双重性的困扰 维琪的看法对吗？

1188
01:11:28,603 --> 01:11:33,051
Was Vicki right about your... ...difficulty with duality?

1189
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:41,122
我若说是，那...

1190
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:41,122
You see... ...if l say yes, then...

1191
01:11:43,088 --> 01:11:48,235
你会以为我是杀人狂...

1192
01:11:43,088 --> 01:11:48,235
...you'll think of me as a... ...Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and...

1193
01:11:56,304 --> 01:11:58,356
也许不肯让我吻你

1194
01:11:56,304 --> 01:11:58,356
You might not let me kiss you.

1195
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:04,105
会令人失望的 一向是所谓的正常人

1196
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:04,105
lt's the so-called normal guys who always let you down.

1197
01:12:04,681 --> 01:12:08,227
狂人从未吓到我 至少他们执着

1198
01:12:04,681 --> 01:12:08,227
Sicko's never scare me. At least they're committed.

1199
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:14,644
是

1200
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:14,644
Yeah

1201
01:12:48,101 --> 01:12:50,913
不，我不能那么做 我也是

1202
01:12:48,101 --> 01:12:50,913
l can't do that. Neither can l.

1203
01:12:51,172 --> 01:12:54,510
这是特别报导 冰雪公主被绑架了

1204
01:12:51,172 --> 01:12:54,510
The lce Princess has been kidnapped. This is a special bulletin.

1205
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:59,931
戈登署长，你能证实 蝙蝠侠涉嫌绑架的传闻吗

1206
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:59,931
Can you confirm Batman's suspected involvement in the abduction?

1207
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:03,876
这个证据纯粹是间接的

1208
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:03,876
The evidence is purely circumstantial.

1209
01:13:04,522 --> 01:13:06,325
它沾了血迹

1210
01:13:04,522 --> 01:13:06,325
This was found, stained with blood,

1211
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,674
是在失踪女孩的 更衣室找到的

1212
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,674
in the missing girl's dressing room.

1213
01:13:10,162 --> 01:13:12,704
我得走了... 不，是我，这是你的家

1214
01:13:10,162 --> 01:13:12,704
-l must go. -No, it's your house.

1215
01:13:12,704 --> 01:13:17,673
慢着，坐一下，好吗？ 轻松点，我马上回来

1216
01:13:12,704 --> 01:13:17,673
Hold on. Just sit for a second. Relax and l'll be right back.

1217
01:13:26,049 --> 01:13:29,524
阿福，我得到广场去 我看到了

1218
01:13:26,049 --> 01:13:29,524
l've got to go to the plaza.

1219
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:31,889
是，我知道 他简直是在求我出现

1220
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:31,889
-He is begging me to show. -l hoped you'd snub him.

1221
01:13:31,889 --> 01:13:34,214
因此我希望你别理他 不行，那是绑架案

1222
01:13:31,889 --> 01:13:34,214
l can't. lt's kidnapping.

1223
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:35,669
听着，我要你这么做

1224
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:35,669
Here's what you'll do.

1225
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:37,719
糟糕

1226
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:37,719
Shit!

1227
01:13:41,634 --> 01:13:44,838
告诉瑟琳娜 就是里面的凯尔小姐

1228
01:13:41,634 --> 01:13:44,838
Tell Selina, Ms. Kyle,

1229
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:47,174
告诉她...我得进城去

1230
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:47,174
l had to go out of town

1231
01:13:47,174 --> 01:13:49,578
告诉她... 我突然有笔大生意要处理

1232
01:13:47,174 --> 01:13:49,578
.Tell her l had a big business deal or-- You know what?

1233
01:13:49,578 --> 01:13:51,713
不，这样吧，告诉她... 让她知道...

1234
01:13:49,578 --> 01:13:51,713
Let her know,way--

1235
01:13:51,713 --> 01:13:53,649
不是用愚蠢的 “做我女友”的方法

1236
01:13:51,713 --> 01:13:53,649
not in some kind of dumb, ''be-my-girlfriend''

1237
01:13:53,649 --> 01:13:55,523
我会转达讯息的 太好了

1238
01:13:53,649 --> 01:13:55,523
l'll relay the message.

1239
01:13:59,089 --> 01:14:01,159
凯尔小姐？ 阿福

1240
01:13:59,089 --> 01:14:01,159
Ms. Kyle,

1241
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:05,393
韦恩先生叫我告诉你... 韦恩先生？布鲁斯，对

1242
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:05,393
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that-- Bruce, yes.

1243
01:14:06,098 --> 01:14:11,679
可否代我告诉他 我历经许多...改变...

1244
01:14:06,098 --> 01:14:11,679
Would you tell him... ...l've been going through... a lot of changes and....

1245
01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:18,046
不，只要告诉他 我的突然离去并非拒绝

1246
01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:18,046
Just that... ...this is not a rejection...

1247
01:14:18,046 --> 01:14:21,981
事实上，他使我觉得有

1248
01:14:18,046 --> 01:14:21,981
...my abruptly leaving. ln fact, he makes me feel the way...

1249
01:14:22,553 --> 01:14:24,462
我希望真的是的感受

1250
01:14:22,553 --> 01:14:24,462
...l hope l really am.

1251
01:14:24,588 --> 01:14:25,762
不！

1252
01:14:24,588 --> 01:14:25,762
No

1253
01:14:26,424 --> 01:14:33,067
你能编个借口或什么吗 我正好想到一个

1254
01:14:26,424 --> 01:14:33,067
Could you just make up a sonnet or... a dirty limerick? One has just sprung to mind.

1255
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:35,978
谢谢 这边，夫人

1256
01:14:33,132 --> 01:14:35,978
This way, ma'am.

1257
01:14:36,803 --> 01:14:37,739
抱歉

1258
01:14:36,803 --> 01:14:37,739
Sorry

1259
01:15:36,978 --> 01:15:38,436
女士先生们

1260
01:15:36,978 --> 01:15:38,436
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1261
01:15:38,613 --> 01:15:41,151
女士先生们 请注意一下好吗？

1262
01:15:38,613 --> 01:15:41,151
Please, may l have your attention?

1263
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:49,244
我知道对许多人而言 近来高谭似乎祸患频仍

1264
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:49,244
l know that to many of you... ...Gotham seems a bit beleaguered these days.

1265
01:15:49,759 --> 01:15:51,395
但我要你们知道

1266
01:15:49,759 --> 01:15:51,395
But l want you to know your elected officials...

1267
01:15:51,395 --> 01:15:57,404
你们选的官员与警方 已经控制住情势

1268
01:15:51,395 --> 01:15:57,404
...and your police department... ...have the situation well in hand.

1269
01:16:57,911 --> 01:16:59,987
会痛的 谢谢你

1270
01:16:57,911 --> 01:16:59,987
Gotta hurry. Thank you.

1271
01:17:00,347 --> 01:17:01,582
这是陷阱 好让人觉得是我做的

1272
01:17:00,347 --> 01:17:01,582
lt was set up.

1273
01:17:01,582 --> 01:17:03,417
别担心，我会告诉警方

1274
01:17:01,582 --> 01:17:03,417
l'll tell the police

1275
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:04,971
我是被一个有鱼腥味的 丑鸟人绑架的

1276
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:04,971
l was kidnapped by an ugly birdman with fish breath.

1277
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:07,051
有人提到鱼吗？

1278
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:07,051
Did somebody say fish?

1279
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,190
我整天都未进食呢！

1280
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,190
l haven't been fed all day.

1281
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:11,972
吃地板吧

1282
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:11,972
Eat floor.

1283
01:17:13,631 --> 01:17:14,318
高织

1284
01:17:13,631 --> 01:17:14,318
High fiber.

1285
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:16,574
帅哥

1286
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:16,574
Hey, stud...

1287
01:17:18,068 --> 01:17:20,013
我以为我们互相吸引

1288
01:17:18,068 --> 01:17:20,013
-...l thought we had something together.

1289
01:17:20,038 --> 01:17:21,532
没错

1290
01:17:20,038 --> 01:17:21,532
-We do.

1291
01:17:36,392 --> 01:17:37,364
得走了

1292
01:17:36,392 --> 01:17:37,364
Got to go.

1293
01:17:37,693 --> 01:17:39,116
女孩子的悄悄话

1294
01:17:37,693 --> 01:17:39,116
Girl talk.

1295
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:07,924
她放我走了

1296
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:07,924
She let me go.

1297
01:18:08,298 --> 01:18:10,931
我想是因为我以女孩立场 跟她讲理

1298
01:18:08,298 --> 01:18:10,931
l reasoned with her, girl-to-girl.

1299
01:18:12,002 --> 01:18:14,220
小心，别动

1300
01:18:12,002 --> 01:18:14,220
Be careful. Don't move.

1301
01:18:16,842 --> 01:18:18,016
草地飞镖

1302
01:18:16,842 --> 01:18:18,016
Lawn dart!

1303
01:18:21,848 --> 01:18:24,421
有翅膀的老鼠 做拿手的事吧

1304
01:18:21,848 --> 01:18:24,421
Rats with wings, do your thing.

1305
01:18:30,559 --> 01:18:32,575
蝙蝠侠推落冰雪公主

1306
01:18:30,559 --> 01:18:32,575
Batman pushed the Princess!

1307
01:18:48,214 --> 01:18:49,317
停火！

1308
01:18:48,214 --> 01:18:49,317
Hold your fire!

1309
01:18:50,282 --> 01:18:51,421
停火！

1310
01:18:50,282 --> 01:18:51,421
Hold your fire!

1311
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:08,405
你对我这种女孩 很有吸引力

1312
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:08,405
You're catnip to a girl like me.

1313
01:19:08,405 --> 01:19:13,477
英俊，迷人 值得付出一切代价

1314
01:19:08,405 --> 01:19:13,477
Handsome, dazed... ...and to die for.

1315
01:19:21,287 --> 01:19:23,434
你若吃w寄生会致命

1316
01:19:21,287 --> 01:19:23,434
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

1317
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:28,846
但你若认真，吻更致命

1318
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:28,846
But a kiss... ...can be even deadlier if you mean it.

1319
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:40,946
你是这周第二个杀我的人

1320
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:40,946
You're the second man who killed me this week.

1321
01:19:40,946 --> 01:19:42,784
但我还剩七条命

1322
01:19:40,946 --> 01:19:42,784
But l've got seven lives left.

1323
01:19:43,182 --> 01:19:44,750
我试过救你

1324
01:19:43,182 --> 01:19:44,750
l tried to save you--

1325
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,977
似乎你企图救的每个女人 结果都死了

1326
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,977
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead.

1327
01:19:48,721 --> 01:19:50,903
或大为责怪你

1328
01:19:48,721 --> 01:19:50,903
Or deeply resentful.

1329
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:52,878
也许你该退休了

1330
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:52,878
Maybe you should retire.

1331
01:20:16,323 --> 01:20:17,188
可恶！

1332
01:20:16,323 --> 01:20:17,188
Damn.

1333
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:54,126
真出色

1334
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:54,126
Outstanding.

1335
01:20:54,737 --> 01:21:01,378
你是包装成性感 圣诞礼物的美女与野兽

1336
01:20:54,737 --> 01:21:01,378
You're Beauty and the Beast... ...in one luscious Christmas gift pack.

1337
01:21:01,378 --> 01:21:03,359
你说你只要吓吓冰雪公主

1338
01:21:01,378 --> 01:21:03,359
You said you'd scare the lce Princess.

1339
01:21:04,015 --> 01:21:05,675
我觉得她看来蛮怕的

1340
01:21:04,015 --> 01:21:05,675
She looked pretty scared to me.

1341
01:21:08,421 --> 01:21:09,773
来点香槟？

1342
01:21:08,421 --> 01:21:09,773
Touch of the bubbly?

1343
01:21:14,494 --> 01:21:19,968
我们还在等我们 让我们结合圆房吧

1344
01:21:14,494 --> 01:21:19,968
So what are we waiting for? Let's consummate our fiendish union.

1345
01:21:19,968 --> 01:21:21,320
你在说些什么？

1346
01:21:19,968 --> 01:21:21,320
What?

1347
01:21:21,779 --> 01:21:25,761
别这样，你无法想像吗

1348
01:21:21,779 --> 01:21:25,761
Oh, come on. Can't you picture?

1349
01:21:26,108 --> 01:21:28,211
市长的华宅一片黑暗

1350
01:21:26,108 --> 01:21:28,211
lt's the Mayor's mansion.

1351
01:21:28,211 --> 01:21:31,722
我精疲力尽 于是你进卧室

1352
01:21:28,211 --> 01:21:31,722
l'm bushed, so here you come into the bedroom...

1353
01:21:32,317 --> 01:21:34,369
扭着你的小尾巴

1354
01:21:32,317 --> 01:21:34,369
...twitching your little tail...

1355
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:39,728
一手拿我的拖鞋 一手拿杯纯马丁尼  拜托

1356
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:39,728
...my slippers in one hand, a dry martini in the other. Please.

1357
01:21:40,059 --> 01:21:42,203
我无论如何不会碰你 你这差劲的妞儿

1358
01:21:40,059 --> 01:21:42,203
l wouldn't touch you to scratch you.

1359
01:21:42,203 --> 01:21:46,968
我该阉掉你 你发出了所有的讯号

1360
01:21:42,203 --> 01:21:46,968
You lousy minx! l'll have you spayed! You sent out all the signals!

1361
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:49,115
我想我不再喜欢你了

1362
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:49,115
l don't think l like you anymore!

1363
01:21:57,481 --> 01:22:01,540
再见，我未参加的人 上天堂吧

1364
01:21:57,481 --> 01:22:01,540
Good-bye, my unintended. Go to heaven.

1365
01:22:38,064 --> 01:22:39,073
谢谢

1366
01:22:38,064 --> 01:22:39,073
Thank you

1367
01:23:01,229 --> 01:23:02,260
他在这

1368
01:23:01,229 --> 01:23:02,260
There he is!

1369
01:23:04,964 --> 01:23:06,589
别调整荧幕

1370
01:23:04,964 --> 01:23:06,589
Don't adjust your sets.

1371
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:11,899
欢迎光临 奥兹瓦卡伯波特驾驶学校

1372
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:11,899
Welcome... ...to the Oswald Cobblepot School of Driving.

1373
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:15,888
各位先生，开始尖叫吧

1374
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:15,888
Gentlemen, start your screaming.

1375
01:23:49,553 --> 01:23:53,657
也许此时提起，时机不对 但我的驾照过期了

1376
01:23:49,553 --> 01:23:53,657
This may be a bad time to mention it, but my license is expired!

1377
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,014
轻松点

1378
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,014
Relax.

1379
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:15,976
我会对付高谭市那些 爱抱怨的讨厌白痴木偶的

1380
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:15,976
l'll take care of the squealing, wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham!

1381
01:25:03,744 --> 01:25:07,671
我玩弄这个臭城市 于掌股之间

1382
01:25:03,744 --> 01:25:07,671
You must admit l play this stinking city like a harp from hell!

1383
01:25:27,908 --> 01:25:30,790
十二点方向 有个无助的老太太

1384
01:25:27,908 --> 01:25:30,790
Helpless old lady at 12 o'clock high!

1385
01:26:07,891 --> 01:26:08,863
真奇怪

1386
01:26:07,891 --> 01:26:08,863
That's funny.

1387
01:26:17,436 --> 01:26:19,380
好啦，现在我有点担心了

1388
01:26:17,436 --> 01:26:19,380
Now l'm a little worried.

1389
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:49,318
他就算活着，也不用担心 别紧张

1390
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:49,318
So he survived. Why worry? He didn't even lose a limb!

1391
01:26:50,943 --> 01:26:53,480
他连四肢都没少一点 眼球，失禁都没有

1392
01:26:50,943 --> 01:26:53,480
An eyeball! Bladder control!

1393
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:57,073
重点是听听他们 他们对旧象征已失去信心

1394
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:57,073
Listen to them. They've lost faith in old symbols.

1395
01:26:57,073 --> 01:27:01,057
他们已认同你 是未来的代表了

1396
01:26:57,073 --> 01:27:01,057
They'll bond with you, the icon of the future.

1397
01:27:01,057 --> 01:27:02,958
若是成功，便别改变

1398
01:27:01,057 --> 01:27:02,958
lf it works, don't fix it.

1399
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,882
我们今晚在我的 面具舞会上庆祝

1400
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,882
We'll celebrate tonight at my annual ball...

1401
01:27:04,882 --> 01:27:09,951
许瑞克和卡伯波特 耀眼的联盟

1402
01:27:04,882 --> 01:27:09,951
...Shreck and Cobblepot... ...the visionary alliance.

1403
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:12,509
走吧

1404
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:12,509
Go

1405
01:27:29,992 --> 01:27:35,520
在维护我们这个 美丽城市的时刻

1406
01:27:29,992 --> 01:27:35,520
When it came time... ...to ensure the safety of our fair city...

1407
01:27:36,767 --> 01:27:38,499
市长有计划吗？

1408
01:27:36,767 --> 01:27:38,499
...did the Mayor have a plan?

1409
01:27:38,636 --> 01:27:40,130
没有

1410
01:27:38,636 --> 01:27:40,130
No!

1411
01:27:42,074 --> 01:27:45,372
他依赖一个人

1412
01:27:42,074 --> 01:27:45,372
He relied on a man.

1413
01:27:45,778 --> 01:27:47,830
一个蝙蝠侠

1414
01:27:45,778 --> 01:27:47,830
A Batman.

1415
01:27:48,349 --> 01:27:52,975
一个行动炸弹 最后终于爆炸的化妆疯子

1416
01:27:48,349 --> 01:27:52,975
A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak...

1417
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,794
我们主要关切的 是这个可怕的怪物

1418
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,794
Our prime concern is this ghastly grotesque.

1419
01:27:56,191 --> 01:27:59,108
但也别忘了修蝙蝠车

1420
01:27:56,191 --> 01:27:59,108
But let's not forget about repairing the Batmobile.

1421
01:27:59,595 --> 01:28:01,540
得考虑安全问题

1422
01:27:59,595 --> 01:28:01,540
There's security to consider.

1423
01:28:01,799 --> 01:28:05,653
我们不能任意将它 送到一个修车厂，对吧

1424
01:28:01,799 --> 01:28:05,653
We can't just take it to any old body shop.

1425
01:28:05,804 --> 01:28:06,907
安全问题？

1426
01:28:05,804 --> 01:28:06,907
Security?

1427
01:28:07,138 --> 01:28:09,190
谁让维琪维尔进蝙蝠洞

1428
01:28:07,138 --> 01:28:09,190
Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave?

1429
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:12,044
我正在工作 一转身，她便在那里

1430
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:12,044
l'm working and l turn around. There she is.

1431
01:28:12,211 --> 01:28:13,670
“嗨，维琪，进来”

1432
01:28:12,211 --> 01:28:13,670
''Hi, Vick. Come on in.''

1433
01:28:23,292 --> 01:28:25,653
准备好了吗 我想我走楼梯

1434
01:28:23,292 --> 01:28:25,653
-Ready? -l'll take the stairs.

1435
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:51,654
你们问我 我是否为个人荣耀上场

1436
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:51,654
You ask...am l up here for personal glory?

1437
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:53,666
不是

1438
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:53,666
No.

1439
01:28:55,331 --> 01:28:58,392
我受苦多年

1440
01:28:59,402 --> 01:29:04,752
快乐的藏身于 你们的大道下方

1441
01:29:06,979 --> 01:29:16,126
我渴望重新捕捉的荣耀 是高谭的荣耀

1442
01:29:06,979 --> 01:29:16,126
The glory that l yearn to recapture... ...is the glory of Gotham!

1443
01:29:28,605 --> 01:29:30,823
（频道锁定）

1444
01:29:31,643 --> 01:29:34,762
我要如何达成

1445
01:29:31,643 --> 01:29:34,762
How can this be accomplished?

1446
01:29:35,814 --> 01:29:40,085
我知道你们都很关心

1447
01:29:35,814 --> 01:29:40,085
l know... ...you're all concerned.

1448
01:29:42,155 --> 01:29:43,365
轻松点

1449
01:29:42,155 --> 01:29:43,365
Relax.

1450
01:29:43,991 --> 01:29:49,626
我玩弄这个臭城市 于掌股之间

1451
01:29:43,991 --> 01:29:49,626
l'll take care of the squealing, wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham.

1452
01:29:55,573 --> 01:29:57,482
我没有那么说

1453
01:29:55,573 --> 01:29:57,482
l didn't say that.

1454
01:29:59,243 --> 01:30:01,279
你得承认

1455
01:29:59,243 --> 01:30:01,279
You must admit l played this stinking city...

1456
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:06,630
我玩弄这个臭城市 于掌股之间

1457
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:06,630
...like a harp from hell!

1458
01:30:07,688 --> 01:30:08,827
你得承认

1459
01:30:07,688 --> 01:30:08,827
You must admit...

1460
01:30:09,256 --> 01:30:13,360
我玩弄这个臭城市 于掌股之间

1461
01:30:09,256 --> 01:30:13,360
...l played this stinking city like a harp from hell!

1462
01:30:16,031 --> 01:30:19,850
我玩弄这个臭城市 于掌股之间

1463
01:30:22,172 --> 01:30:27,736
我玩弄这个臭城市 于掌股之间

1464
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:35,323
等一下！

1465
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:10,284
为何老是有人带着 蛋和番茄去听演讲

1466
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:10,284
Why does someone always bring eggs and tomatoes to a speech?

1467
01:31:34,194 --> 01:31:35,404
他在那里

1468
01:31:34,194 --> 01:31:35,404
There is he

1469
01:32:07,302 --> 01:32:08,927
我的宝贝们

1470
01:32:07,302 --> 01:32:08,927
My babies.

1471
01:32:09,872 --> 01:32:11,532
你们想我吗？

1472
01:32:09,872 --> 01:32:11,532
Did you miss me?

1473
01:32:25,325 --> 01:32:26,914
你们想我吗？

1474
01:32:25,325 --> 01:32:26,914
Did you miss me?

1475
01:32:28,828 --> 01:32:30,322
很棒的演讲，奥兹瓦

1476
01:32:28,828 --> 01:32:30,322
Great speech, Oswald.

1477
01:32:31,999 --> 01:32:33,623
我不叫奥兹瓦

1478
01:32:31,999 --> 01:32:33,623
My name is not Oswald!

1479
01:32:34,201 --> 01:32:35,589
是企鹅

1480
01:32:34,201 --> 01:32:35,589
lt's Penguin!

1481
01:32:36,204 --> 01:32:37,758
我不是人类

1482
01:32:36,204 --> 01:32:37,758
l am not a human being!

1483
01:32:38,306 --> 01:32:41,604
我是动物，是冷血的

1484
01:32:38,306 --> 01:32:41,604
l am an animal. Cold-blooded!

1485
01:32:42,346 --> 01:32:43,626
冷气转强

1486
01:32:42,346 --> 01:32:43,626
Crank the A.C.!

1487
01:32:44,148 --> 01:32:46,780
我的名单呢？ 将名字送上来

1488
01:32:44,148 --> 01:32:46,780
Where are my lists?! Bring me the names!

1489
01:32:48,118 --> 01:32:53,618
时候到了 这是高谭市长子的名字

1490
01:32:48,118 --> 01:32:53,618
lt's time. These are the names of the first-born sons of Gotham City.

1491
01:32:54,293 --> 01:32:55,953
就和我一样

1492
01:32:54,293 --> 01:32:55,953
Just like l was.

1493
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:57,264
而和我一样

1494
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:57,264
And like me,

1495
01:32:57,664 --> 01:33:00,096
可怕的命运在等着他们

1496
01:32:57,664 --> 01:33:00,096
a terrible fate waits for them.

1497
01:33:00,835 --> 01:33:06,843
当他们的父母狂欢时 他们将在摇篮软床上做梦

1498
01:33:00,835 --> 01:33:06,843
Tonight, while their parents party... ...they'll be dreaming away...

1499
01:33:06,976 --> 01:33:15,753
我们将劫走他们 将他们带到下水道

1500
01:33:06,976 --> 01:33:15,753
...in their safe cribs... ...their soft beds... ...and we'll snatch them... ...carry them into the sewer...

1501
01:33:15,753 --> 01:33:19,680
将他们丢入深黑水墓中

1502
01:33:15,753 --> 01:33:19,680
...and toss them into a deep, dark, watery grave.

1503
01:33:21,593 --> 01:33:22,946
企鹅

1504
01:33:21,593 --> 01:33:22,946
Penguin?

1505
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,490
杀死熟睡儿童 岂不是有一点...

1506
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,490
Killing sleeping children... ...isn't that a little...

1507
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:40,071
不，是很多

1508
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:40,071
No, it's a lot.

1509
01:33:49,896 --> 01:33:52,332
韦恩先生，提醒你

1510
01:33:49,896 --> 01:33:52,332
A reminder. Tonight is

1511
01:33:52,332 --> 01:33:55,286
今晚那个怪许瑞克先生 要举行讨厌的派对

1512
01:33:52,332 --> 01:33:55,286
that loathsome party hosted by the odious Mr. Shreck.

1513
01:33:55,702 --> 01:33:59,834
我们能严正回绝吗？ 没兴趣

1514
01:33:55,702 --> 01:33:59,834
May we R.S.V.P. in the resoundingly negative? Not interested.

1515
01:34:02,545 --> 01:34:04,098
不过...

1516
01:34:02,545 --> 01:34:04,098
Although...

1517
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:08,219
瑟琳娜凯尔可能会在场

1518
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:08,219
...Selina Kyle might be there.

1519
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:33,475
真出色的服装

1520
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:33,475
lngenious costume.

1521
01:34:34,017 --> 01:34:38,536
我来猜猜看，基金会好人

1522
01:34:34,017 --> 01:34:38,536
Let me guess. Trust-fund goodie-goodie.

1523
01:34:38,789 --> 01:34:40,378
感觉很好吧？

1524
01:34:38,789 --> 01:34:40,378
Feeling good?

1525
01:34:41,493 --> 01:34:44,553
你差点使一个怪物 当上高谭市长

1526
01:34:41,493 --> 01:34:44,553
You almost made a monster of the Mayor of Gotham City.

1527
01:34:44,996 --> 01:34:47,143
我是本市之光

1528
01:34:44,996 --> 01:34:47,143
l am the light of this City...

1529
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,938
我是它的恶毒扭曲灵魂

1530
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,938
...and l am its mean, twisted soul.

1531
01:34:50,938 --> 01:34:53,571
谁当市长有关系吗？ 对我而言是的

1532
01:34:50,938 --> 01:34:53,571
Does it matter who's Mayor? To me.

1533
01:34:53,807 --> 01:34:55,337
无聊

1534
01:34:53,807 --> 01:34:55,337
Yawn.

1535
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:35,342
听着，昨天很抱歉

1536
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:35,342
l'm sorry about yesterday, but l had...

1537
01:35:35,692 --> 01:35:39,287
我得去处理一笔大生意 没关系

1538
01:35:35,692 --> 01:35:39,287
...a pretty big deal come through. Fall through, actually.

1539
01:35:39,287 --> 01:35:42,363
我得回家去喂我的猫

1540
01:35:39,287 --> 01:35:42,363
lt's okay. l had to go home and feed my cat.

1541
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:53,492
那不伤感情罗？

1542
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:53,492
No hard feelings, then?

1543
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:57,280
事实上

1544
01:35:55,584 --> 01:35:57,280
Actually...

1545
01:35:59,088 --> 01:36:01,864
应该是半伤

1546
01:35:59,088 --> 01:36:01,864
...semihard, l'd say.

1547
01:36:07,699 --> 01:36:11,174
寝具部有个 大而舒适的双人床

1548
01:36:07,699 --> 01:36:11,174
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.

1549
01:36:12,505 --> 01:36:15,374
你说我们...

1550
01:36:12,505 --> 01:36:15,374
Why don't we....

1551
01:36:15,374 --> 01:36:17,700
脱掉舞会服装吗？

1552
01:36:15,374 --> 01:36:17,700
Take off our costumes?

1553
01:36:20,681 --> 01:36:23,254
我想我已厌倦戴面具了

1554
01:36:20,681 --> 01:36:23,254
l'm tired of wearing masks.

1555
01:36:23,485 --> 01:36:25,217
我也是

1556
01:36:23,485 --> 01:36:25,217
Me too.

1557
01:36:26,188 --> 01:36:28,240
让我问你一件事

1558
01:36:26,188 --> 01:36:28,240
Tell me something.

1559
01:36:29,192 --> 01:36:31,304
你今晚为何来？

1560
01:36:29,192 --> 01:36:31,304
Why'd you come tonight?

1561
01:36:31,595 --> 01:36:34,584
你先说 来看你

1562
01:36:31,595 --> 01:36:34,584
-You first. -To see you.

1563
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:37,711
说得真好

1564
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:37,711
Lovely.

1565
01:36:38,837 --> 01:36:43,357
但愿我能说同样的话 但我是为了麦斯来的

1566
01:36:38,837 --> 01:36:43,357
l wish l could say the same, but l came for Max.

1567
01:36:44,645 --> 01:36:46,948
什么意思？你和...

1568
01:36:44,645 --> 01:36:46,948
Do you mean you...

1569
01:36:46,948 --> 01:36:48,371
不可能是你和麦斯

1570
01:36:46,948 --> 01:36:48,371
...and Max...

1571
01:36:49,584 --> 01:36:50,971
我和麦斯！

1572
01:36:49,584 --> 01:36:50,971
Me and Max?

1573
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,158
不！

1574
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,158
No

1575
01:36:57,346 --> 01:37:00,580
这个和麦斯

1576
01:36:57,346 --> 01:37:00,580
No. This and Max.

1577
01:37:01,265 --> 01:37:02,533
不！

1578
01:37:01,265 --> 01:37:02,533
No

1579
01:37:02,533 --> 01:37:07,433
别告诉我杀死麦斯 无法解决一切，会的

1580
01:37:02,533 --> 01:37:07,433
Don't tell me killing Max won't solve anything, because it will.

1581
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:11,179
你不厌倦这虚伪强盗大亨 老是获胜吗？

1582
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:11,179
Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber-baron...

1583
01:37:11,478 --> 01:37:14,482
他应该被埋在六尺下才对

1584
01:37:11,478 --> 01:37:14,482
...coming out on top? He should be six feet under.

1585
01:37:14,482 --> 01:37:16,383
我确信你和你老板之间 有许多问题

1586
01:37:14,482 --> 01:37:16,383
You may have problems with your boss,

1587
01:37:16,383 --> 01:37:18,779
但是，你以为你是什么人

1588
01:37:16,383 --> 01:37:18,779
but who do you think you are?

1589
01:37:21,724 --> 01:37:23,942
我已经不知道了 布鲁斯

1590
01:37:21,724 --> 01:37:23,942
l don't know anymore, Bruce.

1591
01:37:38,577 --> 01:37:41,733
w寄生下的吻

1592
01:37:38,577 --> 01:37:41,733
A kiss under the mistletoe.

1593
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:46,220
你知道，吃w寄生会致命

1594
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:46,220
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

1595
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:48,853
但你若认真

1596
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:48,853
But a kiss can be even deadlier...

1597
01:37:50,475 --> 01:37:51,969
吻更致命

1598
01:37:50,475 --> 01:37:51,969
...if you mean it.

1599
01:38:02,674 --> 01:38:04,027
我的天

1600
01:38:02,674 --> 01:38:04,027
Oh, my God.

1601
01:38:04,877 --> 01:38:08,803
这是否意味 我们得开始再打斗

1602
01:38:04,877 --> 01:38:08,803
Do we have to start fighting?

1603
01:38:09,048 --> 01:38:12,275
我们到外面去

1604
01:38:09,048 --> 01:38:12,275
Let's go outside.

1605
01:38:45,493 --> 01:38:49,277
父亲！  我的儿子 你没事吧？  是，我很好

1606
01:38:45,493 --> 01:38:49,277
-Are you okay? -l'm all right.

1607
01:38:56,342 --> 01:39:00,968
你们没邀我 因此我不请自来

1608
01:38:56,342 --> 01:39:00,968
You didn't invite me... ...so l crashed!

1609
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:04,651
你要做什么？

1610
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:04,651
What do you want?

1611
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:11,406
现在，我的部队正在全城 搜寻你们的孩子

1612
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:11,406
Right now, my troops are fanning out across town for your children!

1613
01:39:11,727 --> 01:39:14,917
对，你们的长子

1614
01:39:11,727 --> 01:39:14,917
Yes! For your first-born sons!

1615
01:39:15,964 --> 01:39:20,304
你们使他无助在家的那个

1616
01:39:15,964 --> 01:39:20,304
The ones you left defenseless at home... ...so you could dress up like jerks...

1617
01:39:20,304 --> 01:39:25,483
好让你们能打扮得像傻瓜 喝酒，尽情跳舞

1618
01:39:20,304 --> 01:39:25,483
...get juiced and dance... ...badly!

1619
01:39:30,183 --> 01:39:38,427
我亲自来抓高谭最心爱的 儿子，奇普许瑞克先生

1620
01:39:30,183 --> 01:39:38,427
l've personally come... ...for Gotham's favorite son... ...Mr. Chip Shreck.

1621
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:44,542
跟我走，你这个大白痴 以便死于下面的下水道中

1622
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:44,542
Come with me, you great white dope! To die, way down in the sewer!

1623
01:39:44,542 --> 01:39:50,135
就抓我吧 别抓奇普

1624
01:39:44,542 --> 01:39:50,135
Not Chip. lf you have any human feeling, take me instead.

1625
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:53,578
你若有丝毫人性 我没有，因此，不行

1626
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:53,578
l don't. So, no!

1627
01:39:53,578 --> 01:39:54,858
我才是你要的

1628
01:39:53,578 --> 01:39:54,858
l'm the one you want.

1629
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:59,519
问你自己，操纵背叛你的 不是麦斯许瑞克吗？

1630
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:59,519
lsn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you? lsn't it Max, not Chip...

1631
01:39:59,519 --> 01:40:04,799
你要看到他淹死的 不是麦斯吗？

1632
01:39:59,519 --> 01:40:04,799
...you want to immerse to his eyeballs in raw sewage?

1633
01:40:09,531 --> 01:40:11,156
好吧，你说的有理

1634
01:40:09,531 --> 01:40:11,156
Okay, you got a point.

1635
01:40:11,667 --> 01:40:14,905
我就暂时让小王子活着

1636
01:40:11,667 --> 01:40:14,905
l'll let the little prince live, for now.

1637
01:40:14,905 --> 01:40:16,150
进鸭子里去

1638
01:40:14,905 --> 01:40:16,150
ln the duck!

1639
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:46,113
实在太好了

1640
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:46,113
This is going to be good...

1641
01:40:46,378 --> 01:40:54,587
在高谭最有希望的作物 成熟前，将它们砍断

1642
01:40:46,378 --> 01:40:54,587
...to cut down a whole crop of Gotham's most promising... ...before their prime.

1643
01:40:55,288 --> 01:40:58,621
你问我如何引诱他们？

1644
01:40:55,288 --> 01:40:58,621
You asked me...how do l lure them in?

1645
01:41:02,163 --> 01:41:06,327
一点“吹笛企鹅”把戏

1646
01:41:02,163 --> 01:41:06,327
A little ''Pied Penguin'' action.

1647
01:41:07,369 --> 01:41:15,316
你可以看着他们沉入一池 你的工业副产品中

1648
01:41:07,369 --> 01:41:15,316
And you get to watch them sink... ...into a deep puddle... ...of your industrial by-products.

1649
01:41:15,316 --> 01:41:16,490
然后

1650
01:41:15,316 --> 01:41:16,490
Then...

1651
01:41:16,614 --> 01:41:20,398
你再加入他们

1652
01:41:16,614 --> 01:41:20,398
...you join them.

1653
01:41:52,625 --> 01:41:56,445
快点将那些孩子装好 好吗？

1654
01:41:52,625 --> 01:41:56,445
Hurry up and get those kids loaded.

1655
01:42:04,974 --> 01:42:09,138
这边走，孩子们 来吧，跟我走

1656
01:42:04,974 --> 01:42:09,138
Right this way, kiddies. Come with me.

1657
01:42:25,366 --> 01:42:28,284
所有的儿童呢？

1658
01:42:25,366 --> 01:42:28,284
So where are all the children?

1659
01:42:31,907 --> 01:42:35,940
“爱亲的企鹅 儿童们懊悔不克参加”

1660
01:42:31,907 --> 01:42:35,940
''Dear Penguin; ''The children regret they're unable to attend.

1661
01:42:36,446 --> 01:42:38,284
“蝙蝠侠”

1662
01:42:36,446 --> 01:42:38,284
''Batman!''

1663
01:42:52,199 --> 01:42:54,631
我亲爱的企鹅们

1664
01:42:52,199 --> 01:42:54,631
My dear penguins...

1665
01:42:54,969 --> 01:42:58,159
我们站在一个大关键上

1666
01:42:54,969 --> 01:42:58,159
...we stand on a great threshold!

1667
01:42:58,908 --> 01:43:01,126
害怕是正常的

1668
01:42:58,908 --> 01:43:01,126
lt's okay to be scared!

1669
01:43:01,477 --> 01:43:04,147
你们有许多人将回不来

1670
01:43:01,477 --> 01:43:04,147
Many of you won't be coming back.

1671
01:43:04,514 --> 01:43:06,566
多谢蝙蝠侠

1672
01:43:04,514 --> 01:43:06,566
Thanks to Batman...

1673
01:43:06,884 --> 01:43:11,676
惩罚所有 神的子女的时刻到了

1674
01:43:06,884 --> 01:43:11,676
...the time has come... ...to punish all God's children!

1675
01:43:12,959 --> 01:43:16,185
长子，次子，三子，四子

1676
01:43:12,959 --> 01:43:16,185
First-, second-, third- and fourth-born!

1677
01:43:16,696 --> 01:43:20,409
为何要有偏见？ 男性和女生

1678
01:43:16,696 --> 01:43:20,409
Why be biased? Male and female!

1679
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:23,453
性别平等

1680
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:23,453
Hell, the sexes are equal...

1681
01:43:23,905 --> 01:43:29,148
和他们的性感带炸入空中

1682
01:43:23,905 --> 01:43:29,148
...with their erogenous zones... ...blown sky-high!

1683
01:43:31,415 --> 01:43:34,404
向前走

1684
01:43:31,415 --> 01:43:34,404
Forward... ...march!

1685
01:43:35,353 --> 01:43:40,917
解放高谭行动开始

1686
01:43:35,353 --> 01:43:40,917
The liberation of Gotham... ...has begun!

1687
01:44:25,214 --> 01:44:27,646
企鹅们在地面上活动了

1688
01:44:25,214 --> 01:44:27,646
The penguins are moving above ground.

1689
01:44:52,815 --> 01:44:58,935
企鹅军接近发射目的地 高谭广场

1690
01:44:52,815 --> 01:44:58,935
Penguin army... ...approaching launch destination at Gotham Plaza.

1691
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:01,472
距燃点一分钟

1692
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:01,472
One minute until ignition.

1693
01:45:01,894 --> 01:45:06,973
他们不尊重我 我就让他们送命

1694
01:45:01,894 --> 01:45:06,973
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal... ...so l'm laying them on a slab!

1695
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:10,955
企鹅似乎在高谭广场集结

1696
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:10,955
Penguins converging on Gotham Plaza.

1697
01:45:33,933 --> 01:45:37,159
距燃点三十秒

1698
01:45:33,933 --> 01:45:37,159
30 seconds until ignition.

1699
01:45:38,038 --> 01:45:44,847
发射后估计死亡人数 十万人

1700
01:45:38,038 --> 01:45:44,847
Estimated casualties after launch; 100,000 people.

1701
01:45:47,015 --> 01:45:50,490
企鹅们已抵达高谭广场

1702
01:45:47,015 --> 01:45:50,490
The penguins have reached Gotham Square.

1703
01:46:09,277 --> 01:46:11,744
距发射十五秒

1704
01:46:09,277 --> 01:46:11,744
15 seconds to ignition.

1705
01:46:13,181 --> 01:46:14,770
准备好了，先生

1706
01:46:13,181 --> 01:46:14,770
Ready, sir.

1707
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:18,901
我已定好座标

1708
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:18,901
Got the coordinates.

1709
01:46:19,589 --> 01:46:27,933
10 9 8 7！

1710
01:46:19,589 --> 01:46:27,933
10，9，8，7

1711
01:46:27,933 --> 01:46:28,834
好了，让他们转向 是，先生

1712
01:46:27,933 --> 01:46:28,834
Let's turn them around.

1713
01:46:32,171 --> 01:46:36,655
（频率锁定）

1714
01:46:37,478 --> 01:46:39,351
情况不对

1715
01:46:37,478 --> 01:46:39,351
Something is wrong.

1716
01:46:41,483 --> 01:46:44,887
讯号被干扰了

1717
01:46:41,483 --> 01:46:44,887
The signal is jammed.

1718
01:46:53,665 --> 01:46:56,262
他们似乎转向了

1719
01:46:53,665 --> 01:46:56,262
They seem to be turning around.

1720
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:30,418
过来 还有某种东西 往这边来了

1721
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:30,418
There is also something coming this way.

1722
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:33,177
非常大，非常快

1723
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:33,177
Very large. Very fast.

1724
01:47:40,922 --> 01:47:42,167
谁在那里

1725
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:49,932
谁在那里

1726
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:49,932
Who's there?!

1727
01:47:57,276 --> 01:47:59,602
好，我要定出讯号来源了

1728
01:47:57,276 --> 01:47:59,602
Homing in on the signal's origin.

1729
01:49:16,374 --> 01:49:21,416
你嫉妒我是个真正怪物 而你得戴面具

1730
01:49:16,374 --> 01:49:21,416
You're jealous because l'm a genuine freak... ...and you have to wear a mask!

1731
01:49:21,781 --> 01:49:23,168
也许你说得对

1732
01:49:21,781 --> 01:49:23,168
You might be right.

1733
01:49:26,688 --> 01:49:29,914
但唯一重要的是 谁拿着雨伞

1734
01:49:26,688 --> 01:49:29,914
But what it all comes down to is; who's holding the umbrella?

1735
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:57,944
我的宝贝

1736
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:57,944
My babies! !

1737
01:51:34,778 --> 01:51:36,014
我不知道你有何所求

1738
01:51:34,778 --> 01:51:36,014
l don't know what you want,

1739
01:51:36,014 --> 01:51:39,727
但我知道只要一点功夫 就能为你弄到手

1740
01:51:36,014 --> 01:51:39,727
but l can get it with a minimum of fuss.

1741
01:51:40,986 --> 01:51:43,418
钱...珠宝

1742
01:51:40,986 --> 01:51:43,418
Money. Jewels.

1743
01:51:43,723 --> 01:51:46,190
很大的一串珠宝

1744
01:51:43,723 --> 01:51:46,190
A very big ball of string.

1745
01:51:50,198 --> 01:51:52,036
你的血，麦斯 我的血？

1746
01:51:50,198 --> 01:51:52,036
Your blood, Max.

1747
01:51:52,634 --> 01:51:54,258
我在办公室捐过了

1748
01:51:52,634 --> 01:51:54,258
l gave at the office.

1749
01:51:54,637 --> 01:51:56,653
只有半品脱 我要的是半加仑

1750
01:51:54,637 --> 01:51:56,653
A half-pint. l'm talking gallons.

1751
01:51:57,006 --> 01:51:58,107
我们来谈条件

1752
01:51:57,006 --> 01:51:58,107
Let's make a deal!

1753
01:51:58,107 --> 01:52:00,311
除了我的血 我能为你做什么？

1754
01:51:58,107 --> 01:52:00,311
Other than my blood, what can l do?

1755
01:52:00,311 --> 01:52:03,193
抱歉，麦斯，以死还死

1756
01:52:00,311 --> 01:52:03,193
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.

1757
01:52:13,993 --> 01:52:17,932
你不只在救一条命 也是在救...  闭嘴！

1758
01:52:13,993 --> 01:52:17,932
You're not just saving a life-- Shut up. You're going to jail.

1759
01:52:17,932 --> 01:52:18,513
你要去坐牢了

1760
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:20,902
别天真了

1761
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:20,902
Don't be naive.

1762
01:52:20,902 --> 01:52:24,807
法律对他或我们这种人 都莫可奈何

1763
01:52:20,902 --> 01:52:24,807
The law doesn't apply to people like him...or us.

1764
01:52:24,807 --> 01:52:25,816
二者皆非

1765
01:52:24,807 --> 01:52:25,816
Wrong on both counts.

1766
01:52:35,687 --> 01:52:37,454
你为何要如此做？

1767
01:52:35,687 --> 01:52:37,454
Why do this?

1768
01:52:41,028 --> 01:52:43,175
我们将他交给警方

1769
01:52:41,028 --> 01:52:43,175
Let's just take him to the police.

1770
01:52:44,665 --> 01:52:48,638
然后我们可以一起回家

1771
01:52:44,665 --> 01:52:48,638
Then we can go home... ...together.

1772
01:52:54,977 --> 01:52:57,230
瑟琳娜...

1773
01:52:54,977 --> 01:52:57,230
Selina...

1774
01:52:59,384 --> 01:53:01,709
你不懂吗？

1775
01:52:59,384 --> 01:53:01,709
...don't you see?

1776
01:53:01,886 --> 01:53:03,938
我们是一样的

1777
01:53:01,886 --> 01:53:03,938
We're the same.

1778
01:53:05,724 --> 01:53:07,776
我们是一样的

1779
01:53:05,724 --> 01:53:07,776
We're the same.

1780
01:53:08,895 --> 01:53:12,715
由中间分裂为二

1781
01:53:08,895 --> 01:53:12,715
Split... ...down the center.

1782
01:53:32,157 --> 01:53:36,330
瑟琳娜，拜托

1783
01:53:32,157 --> 01:53:36,330
Please.

1784
01:53:36,330 --> 01:53:37,930
布鲁斯

1785
01:53:36,330 --> 01:53:37,930
Bruce...

1786
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:42,272
我愿意和你 住在你的城堡中

1787
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:42,272
l would love to live with you in your castle...

1788
01:53:43,371 --> 01:53:46,954
直到永远 一如童话故事

1789
01:53:43,371 --> 01:53:46,954
...forever, just like in a fairy tale.

1790
01:53:52,015 --> 01:53:54,485
但我就是无法忍受自己

1791
01:53:52,015 --> 01:53:54,485
l just couldn't live with myself.

1792
01:53:54,485 --> 01:53:57,965
因此，别假装这是个 快乐结局  瑟琳娜

1793
01:53:54,485 --> 01:53:57,965
Don't pretend this is a happy ending.

1794
01:53:58,690 --> 01:54:00,671
瑟琳娜凯尔

1795
01:53:58,690 --> 01:54:00,671
Selina Kyle.

1796
01:54:01,227 --> 01:54:03,065
你被开除了

1797
01:54:01,227 --> 01:54:03,065
You're fired.

1798
01:54:03,295 --> 01:54:05,098
还有布鲁斯韦恩

1799
01:54:03,295 --> 01:54:05,098
And Bruce Wayne...

1800
01:54:05,399 --> 01:54:07,267
你为何做蝙蝠侠的打扮

1801
01:54:05,399 --> 01:54:07,267
...why are you dressed up like Batman?

1802
01:54:07,267 --> 01:54:10,327
因为他是蝙蝠侠 你这低能儿

1803
01:54:07,267 --> 01:54:10,327
Because he is Batman, you moron!

1804
01:54:11,372 --> 01:54:12,307
以前是

1805
01:54:11,372 --> 01:54:12,307
Was.

1806
01:54:12,307 --> 01:54:13,765
不要

1807
01:54:12,307 --> 01:54:13,765
Don't.

1808
01:54:14,542 --> 01:54:19,263
你杀我，企鹅杀我 蝙蝠侠杀我

1809
01:54:14,542 --> 01:54:19,263
You killed me, the Penguin killed me, Batman killed me.

1810
01:54:19,816 --> 01:54:22,954
去掉三条命 你有足够子弹解决我吗

1811
01:54:19,816 --> 01:54:22,954
Three lives down. Got enough to finish me off?!

1812
01:54:22,954 --> 01:54:24,412
只有一个办法能知道

1813
01:54:22,954 --> 01:54:24,412
One way to find out.

1814
01:54:28,292 --> 01:54:30,644
4 5

1815
01:54:28,292 --> 01:54:30,644
Four. Five.

1816
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:35,319
仍然活着

1817
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:35,319
Still alive!

1818
01:54:44,881 --> 01:54:46,055
Six.

1819
01:54:46,082 --> 01:54:51,812
7，好女孩都上天堂

1820
01:54:46,082 --> 01:54:51,812
Seven. All good girls go to heaven.

1821
01:54:56,127 --> 01:54:58,701
还剩两条命

1822
01:54:56,127 --> 01:54:58,701
Two lives left.

1823
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:03,179
我想该留下一条 过明年圣诞节

1824
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:03,179
l'll save one for next Christmas.

1825
01:55:05,005 --> 01:55:07,852
但在这同时...

1826
01:55:05,005 --> 01:55:07,852
But in the meantime...

1827
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:11,406
吻一下，如何？ 圣诞老人

1828
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:11,406
...how about a kiss, Santie Claus?

1829
01:56:41,838 --> 01:56:43,226
Shit!

1830
01:56:43,727 --> 01:56:46,609
可恶，选到一把可爱的

1831
01:56:43,727 --> 01:56:46,609
l picked a cute one.

1832
01:56:49,334 --> 01:56:51,766
热气使我不舒服

1833
01:56:49,334 --> 01:56:51,766
The heat's getting to me.

1834
01:56:52,371 --> 01:56:54,968
我马上就谋杀你

1835
01:56:52,371 --> 01:56:54,968
l'll murder you momentarily.

1836
01:56:57,277 --> 01:57:03,443
但首先，我需要喝冰水

1837
01:56:57,277 --> 01:57:03,443
But first... ...l need a cool drink... ...of ice water.

1838
01:58:45,144 --> 01:58:46,768
阿福，停车

1839
01:58:45,144 --> 01:58:46,768
Stop the car.

1840
02:00:07,947 --> 02:00:12,146
无论如何 圣诞快乐，韦恩先生

1841
02:00:07,947 --> 02:00:12,146
Come what may... ...Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.

1842
02:00:12,519 --> 02:00:14,595
圣诞快乐，阿福

1843
02:00:12,519 --> 02:00:14,595
Merry Christmas, Alfred.

1844
02:00:16,257 --> 02:00:18,368
“平安归于人”

1845
02:00:16,257 --> 02:00:18,368
Goodwill toward men.

1846
02:00:20,262 --> 02:00:22,694
和女人

1847
02:00:20,262 --> 02:00:22,694
And women.

1848
02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:33,518
剧终
