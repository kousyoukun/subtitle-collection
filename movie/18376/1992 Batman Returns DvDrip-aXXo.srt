1
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:39,303
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

2
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,236
Penguin sighting! Man or myth?

3
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:33,496
What is he? Today's edition.
Another penguin sighting.

4
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:36,182
Another penguin sighting! Check it out!

5
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:40,689
Penguin man living in Gotham's sewers!
Read all about the latest sighting!

6
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,786
May I have your attention, Gotham City?

7
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,951
It is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.

8
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:56,993
How about that?

9
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,406
Part man, part penguin! All horrifying!

10
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,762
Find out for only 50 cents! Come on!

11
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:23,078
Read about the possible terror
beneath our feet! Check it out!

12
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,804
Read about it!

13
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:29,407
Missing link between man and bird.

14
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:30,750
My dear boy...

15
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:33,723
...sometimes it's a diversion
to read such rubbish.

16
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:36,025
Usually, it's a waste of time.

17
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:39,477
Whatever. Today's issue!
"The Penguin: Man or myth?"

18
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,738
The Globe! Right here! 35 cents!

19
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,960
Well, here's hoping.

20
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:11,700
With a little luck, Gotham will have its
first merry Christmas in a long while.

21
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:14,290
I feel almost vulgar in this
Yuletide contest...

22
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:16,783
...mentioning the new power plant.

23
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:20,619
But if we're to break ground we got
to break ground, I'll need permits...

24
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,359
...variances, tax incentives.
That sort of pesky nonsense.

25
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:27,141
Power plant?

26
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:31,648
Max, all studies show we've got enough power to
get us into the middle of the next century.

27
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,060
Analysts are talking growth at 1% per annum.
Its not growth. That's a mild swelling.

28
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:38,937
Imagine...

29
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:40,663
...a Gotham City...

30
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:44,595
...of the future, lit up like a blanket
of stars...

31
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:47,280
...but blinking on and off...

32
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:49,774
...embarrassingly low on juice.

33
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:51,308
Frankly...

34
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,897
...I cringe, Mr. Mayor.

35
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:57,733
Sorry, any plans youve got will have
to go to the usual committees...

36
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,747
...through the usual channels.

37
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:01,570
I have a suggestion.

38
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:10,201
Well...

39
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:13,845
...actually, really, just more like a question.

40
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:19,216
I'm afraid we haven't
properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.

41
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,997
In the plus column, though...

42
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:23,819
...she makes a hell of a cop of coffee.

43
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:33,025
Dad.

44
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:37,437
Mr. Mayor. Time to go down
and bring joy to the masses.

45
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:49,425
"Actually, more like a question. "

46
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,247
You stupid corn dog.

47
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,124
Corn dog, corn dog.

48
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:23,950
I have enough signatures from Shreck
employees alone to warrant a recall.

49
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:26,539
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.

50
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:30,663
Maybe. But you dont have an issue Max
and sure as hell don't have a candidate.

51
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:33,923
Thank you very mutch,
ladies and gentlemen.

52
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,855
From those of us at City Hall
to each and every one of you...

53
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,390
...happy holidays.

54
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:44,473
We have with us a man who needs no
introduction, he's given so much to our city.

55
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,596
Will you welcome please Gotham's
own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.

56
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:11,997
Pick up those contracts for Personnel and...

57
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:14,874
...pick up the dry cleaning
and paper towels...

58
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:18,518
Darn!

59
00:10:24,176 --> 00:10:25,615
I forgot my speech.

60
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:28,300
Remind me to take it out
on what's-her-name.

61
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,862
Santa Claus?

62
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:35,397
Afraid not.

63
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:38,945
I'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.

64
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,726
Sue me...

65
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:44,220
...if I want to give some back.

66
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:49,878
I only wish I could hand out more
than just...

67
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,700
...expensive baubles.

68
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:55,440
I wish I could hand out world peace...

69
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,317
...and unconditional love...

70
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,770
...wrapped in a big bow.

71
00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:04,935
Oh, but you can.

72
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,140
Oh, but you will.

73
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,196
Merry Christmas.

74
00:11:28,143 --> 00:11:29,486
Great idea.

75
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:31,212
Not mine.

76
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,862
What are you waiting for? The signal!

77
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:56,949
We want the big guy!
The guy who runs the show!

78
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:00,689
What do you want?

79
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,031
Not you!

80
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:03,853
Shreck!

81
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:06,155
You'll have to go through me.

82
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:09,895
Dad, go! Save yourself!

83
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:11,046
Dad, go!

84
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:01,813
Shut up!

85
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:12,267
Take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and I'll-

86
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,076
You missed.

87
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:33,077
The Batman.

88
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,667
Or is it just "Batman"?

89
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,421
Your choice, of course.

90
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:45,065
Well, that was...

91
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:46,696
...very brief.

92
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:49,285
Just like all the men in my life.

93
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:51,299
What men?

94
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,121
Well...

95
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,245
...then again, there's you.
But you need therapy.

96
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:21,700
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
Im afraid the Circus Gang is back.

97
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:23,043
We'll see.

98
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:26,495
They almost made off with our mover
and shaker, Max Shreck. But I...

99
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,180
Where is that insufferable son of a bitch?

100
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,477
I believe the word you're looking for is...

101
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:59,520
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.

102
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,397
You're at home in bed...

103
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:05,370
...heavily sedated, resting comfortably...

104
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,494
...dying from the carcinogens
you've personally spewed...

105
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,947
...in a lifetime of profiteering.

106
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:14,577
Tragic irony...

107
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,495
...or poetic justice?

108
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:18,125
You tell me.

109
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:20,906
My God, it's true.

110
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,304
Penguin Man of the sewer.

111
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:29,442
Odd as it may seem, Max...

112
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,990
...you and I have something in common:

113
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,497
We're both perceived as monsters.

114
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,156
But somehow...

115
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,992
...you're a well-respected monster...

116
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,293
...and I am, to date...

117
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:51,403
...not!

118
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:54,952
Frankly, I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman.

119
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,678
Tough, yes.

120
00:18:56,774 --> 00:19:00,130
Shrewd, okay. But that does not
make me a monster.

121
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:03,007
Don't embarrass yourself, Max!

122
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,117
I know all about you.

123
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,419
What you hide, I discover.

124
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:10,488
What you put in your toilet...

125
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,461
...I place on my mantle. Get the picture?

126
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:16,242
Is that supposed to hypnotize me?

127
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,927
No, just give you a splitting headache.

128
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,133
It's not working.

129
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:23,914
Oh, you big baby!

130
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,736
Just blanks.

131
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:28,901
Would I go through all this trouble
tonight just to kill you?

132
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:30,340
No, Max.

133
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:33,121
I have an entirely other purpose.

134
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:35,806
I'm ready, Max.

135
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:38,491
I've been down here too long.

136
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,081
It's time for me to ascend...

137
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,382
...to re-emerge...

138
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,451
...with your help...

139
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,082
...your know-how...

140
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:49,808
...your savvy.

141
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:53,164
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.

142
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,658
I come from...

143
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,576
...like you.

144
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,357
And, like you, I want some respect!

145
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,522
A recognition of my basic humanity.

146
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:05,728
But most of all...

147
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:08,988
...I want to find out who I am...

148
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,002
...by finding my parents...

149
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:13,208
...learning my human name.

150
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:17,811
Simple stuff that the good people
of Gotham take for granted!

151
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:20,401
And...

152
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:23,278
...exactly why am I going to help you?

153
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,059
Well...

154
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:32,005
Let's start.

155
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,075
Let's see what we have in here.

156
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:48,116
A batch of toxic waste...

157
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,665
...from your clean textile plant!

158
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:55,597
There's a whole lagoon of this crud
in the back!

159
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,898
That could have come from anywhere.

160
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:02,598
What about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?

161
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:04,899
If there were such documents...

162
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:06,817
...that's not an admission...

163
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:09,215
...I wouldve seen through
that they were shredded.

164
00:21:09,694 --> 00:21:11,037
Good idea.

165
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:16,120
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference.

166
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,244
By the way...

167
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:23,025
...how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?

168
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:24,367
Fred?

169
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:27,053
Fred's actually...

170
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:30,601
I believe he's on an extended vacation.
He's good.

171
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,108
Good.

172
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,808
Hiya, Max. Remember me?
I'm Fred's hand!

173
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:43,452
Want to greet any other body parts?

174
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,466
Remember, Max...

175
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:47,863
...you flush it, I flaunt it.

176
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:51,795
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?

177
00:21:56,878 --> 00:21:58,413
I think, perhaps...

178
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:01,865
...I could help orchestrate a little
"Welcome Home" scenario for you.

179
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:05,222
Once we're both back home,
perhaps we could help each other.

180
00:22:06,373 --> 00:22:08,866
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

181
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:17,977
Honey, I'm home!

182
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,388
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

183
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,801
Miss Kitty.

184
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:38,596
Back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share?

185
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:42,624
Not that I'd ever pry.

186
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,884
Drink your dinner.

187
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:53,269
What?

188
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,913
How can anyone be so pathetic?

189
00:22:58,352 --> 00:23:01,325
Yes, to you I seem pathetic,
but I'm a working girl.

190
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:05,161
Got to pay the rent. Maybe if you were
chipping in instead of stepping out.

191
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:10,339
Selina, dear, it's your mother.
Just calling to say hello.

192
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:11,778
Yeah, right, but...

193
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:15,135
But I'm disappointed you're not
coming home for Christmas.

194
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,587
I want to discuss just why you insist
on languishing in Gotham City...

195
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:20,601
...as some lowly secretary.

196
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:22,327
Lowly assistant.

197
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:27,218
Selina, about that Christmas getaway
we planned...

198
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:32,876
I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need
to be my own person, not an appendage.

199
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:38,631
Some appendage!

200
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:47,550
The party never stops
on Selina Kyle's answering machine.

201
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:52,441
I guess I should've let him win
that last racquetball game.

202
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:53,783
Hello...

203
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,318
...Selina Kyle.

204
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:58,770
We're calling to tell you about exciting,
new Gotham Lady perfume.

205
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:03,277
It makes women feel like women...
and the men have no complaints either.

206
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:09,895
This is yourself calling to remind you to
come all the way back to the office...

207
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:14,690
- ... and let you remember the Bruce Wayne file...
- You stupid corn dog!

208
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,925
Working late?

209
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:41,159
I'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne
meeting in the morning.

210
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,187
I pulled all the files
on the proposed power plant...

211
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:51,708
...and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment.
And I even opened the protected files-

212
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,202
How industrious!

213
00:24:55,832 --> 00:24:58,038
How did you open the protected files?

214
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,148
May I ask?

215
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:09,642
I figured your password was "Geraldo,"
your Chihuahua, and it was.

216
00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:21,150
This is all very interesting,
though a bit on the technical side...

217
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:26,808
I mean about how the power plant
is a power plant in name only...

218
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:30,357
...since, in fact, it's going to be a big,
giant...

219
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:32,850
...big, giant... capacitor.

220
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,276
And, instead of generating power,
it'll be sucking power from...

221
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,481
...Gotham City...

222
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:44,071
...and storing it...

223
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:46,277
...stockpiling it...

224
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,537
...which is a very novel approach, I'd say.

225
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,853
Who'd you say this to?

226
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:58,360
Nobody.

227
00:26:04,402 --> 00:26:06,800
What did curiosity do to the cat?

228
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,252
I'm no cat.

229
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:12,937
I'm just an assistant.

230
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,472
A secretary.

231
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:16,773
And a very good one.

232
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,787
Too good?

233
00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:20,993
Listen...

234
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:23,199
...it's our secret. Honest.

235
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:26,172
How can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless?

236
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:27,706
This power plant...

237
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:30,871
...is my legacy. It's what I leave behind.

238
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:32,214
For Chip.

239
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:34,611
Nothing must prevent that.

240
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:41,708
Okey, go ahead. Intimidate me.
Bully me, if it makes you feel big.

241
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:44,106
It's not like you can just kill me!

242
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:46,791
Actually, it's a lot like that.

243
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:06,547
For a second, you really frightened me.

244
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:17,959
Really?

245
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:31,804
Honey, I'm home!

246
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:36,983
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

247
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:14,097
Selina, this is your mother. Call me.

248
00:29:15,248 --> 00:29:18,988
Selina, this is your mother.
Why haven't you called me back?

249
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:21,385
Hello, Selina Kyle.

250
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:25,476
We're just calling to make sure
you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.

251
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:29,633
One whiff of this at the office and your boss
will be asking you to stay after work...

252
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:32,414
...for a candlelight staff meeting for two.

253
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:36,442
Gotham Lady perfume.
Exclusively at Shreck's department store.

254
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:17,174
I don't know about you,
Miss Kitty, but I feel...

255
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:19,668
...so much yummier.

256
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:39,040
Ladies and gentlemen:

257
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:45,561
I stand before you once again to denounce
the urban chaos we live with in our city.

258
00:32:46,712 --> 00:32:48,151
It's got to stop.

259
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:51,219
And It's going to stop!
Our community is coming apart...

260
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,576
...in a season when
it should be coming together.

261
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:58,124
I don't care what the cynics may say.
This is the Christmas season...

262
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,755
...and should be a time of healing.

263
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:02,344
And I tell you that not only as an official...

264
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,221
...but as a husband and a father.

265
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:08,002
Last night's violence won't happen again.

266
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:14,140
I'm not realle born for speeches,
so I'lljust say, "Thanks. "

267
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,785
No...
It's the hideous Penguin Man.

268
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:27,854
Here, take the baby.
Just don't hurt me, please!

269
00:34:18,586 --> 00:34:22,518
This was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.

270
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:26,067
The mysterious Penguin saving the life
of the mayor's baby...

271
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:29,807
...and announcing his presence to the world.
- All I want in return...

272
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:32,205
...is a chance...

273
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:34,506
...to find my mom and dad.

274
00:34:36,232 --> 00:34:38,726
A chance to find out who they are...

275
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,315
...and thusly...

276
00:34:41,603 --> 00:34:43,042
...who I am.

277
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,055
And then...

278
00:34:45,343 --> 00:34:47,069
...with my parents...

279
00:34:47,357 --> 00:34:49,467
...try to understand... why.

280
00:34:50,906 --> 00:34:54,262
Why they did what I guess
they felt they had to do...

281
00:34:56,372 --> 00:34:58,002
...to a child...

282
00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:00,208
...who was born...

283
00:35:03,085 --> 00:35:04,907
...a little different.

284
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,784
A child...

285
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,757
...who spent his first Christmas...

286
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:13,443
...and many since...

287
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:16,224
...in a sewer.

288
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:18,525
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?

289
00:35:21,978 --> 00:35:23,129
His parents.

290
00:35:23,225 --> 00:35:25,526
This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.

291
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:28,499
I hope he finds them.

292
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:33,294
Here he is, standing alongside
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.

293
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:36,171
How about a statement?
People want to know.

294
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,694
- Penguin's not to be disturbed!
- It's a public place!

295
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,187
- Walk. Now. Move.
- Freedom of the press!

296
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,817
Wait a minute.

297
00:35:54,872 --> 00:35:58,037
What about the freedom
to rediscover your roots...

298
00:35:58,517 --> 00:36:00,435
...with dignity and privacy?

299
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,832
Is the Penguin a personal friend?

300
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:06,572
Yes he's a personal friend of this
whole city, so have a heart.

301
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,449
Give the Constitution a rest.
It's Christmas.

302
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:50,975
"Red Triangle Circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions.

303
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:57,305
"Circus returns for a two-week...

304
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,031
"Kids will love... "

305
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,565
Thanks.

306
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,648
It's cold!

307
00:37:05,744 --> 00:37:07,087
It's vichyssoise.

308
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:09,868
It's supposed to be cold.

309
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:15,526
"Circus is back with a freak show,
may not be suitable for kids...

"... the world's fattest man...

00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,047
"... and Aquatic Bird Boy. "

313
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:24,925
Why are you now determined to prove...

314
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:28,569
...that this Penguin is not what he seems?

315
00:37:28,952 --> 00:37:31,925
Must you be the only lonely "man-beast"
in town?

316
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:34,131
"The circus folded its tents yesterday...

321
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:50,147
I suppose you feel better now sir.

322
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:53,791
No.

323
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:56,956
Actually, I feel worse.

324
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:16,136
Why're you still out?

325
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:19,972
Are you concerned about that strange,
heroic Penguin person?

326
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,904
I think he knows who his parents are.

327
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:27,453
There's something else.

328
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:20,104
Mr. Penguin...

329
00:40:20,138 --> 00:40:22,727
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly!

330
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:25,700
I am a man!

331
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:28,290
I have a name!

332
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:33,756
Oswald Cobblepot!

333
00:40:35,578 --> 00:40:38,264
Mr Cobblepot.
You'll never get a chance to settle with them?

334
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,771
True.

335
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,936
I was their "Number-One" son...

336
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:48,717
...and they treated me like number two.

337
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,978
But it's human nature to fear...

338
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:54,759
...the unusual.

339
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:56,964
Perhaps...

340
00:40:57,444 --> 00:40:58,883
...when I held my...

341
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:00,992
...Tiffany baby rattle...

342
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:03,965
...with a shiny flipper...

343
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:06,746
...instead of five chubby digits...

344
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:09,815
...they freaked.

345
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,186
But I forgive them.

346
00:41:16,816 --> 00:41:19,693
"Penguin forgives parents!
'I'm at peace with myself and the world!

347
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:22,187
"'Don't need hands as long
as you got heart.

348
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:25,447
"'My heart is filled with love.
I feel five feet tall. "'

349
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:29,284
- He's like a frog that became a prince.
- No, he's more like a penguin.

350
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,956
Now, now, pretty little thing.

351
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:38,874
Nice and easy.

352
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:47,505
I just love a big, strong man who's not afraid
to show it with someone half his size.

353
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:52,108
Be gentle, it's my first time.

354
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:00,452
Tic-tac-toe.

355
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:07,836
You make it so easy, don't you?

356
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:11,001
Always waiting for some Batman
to save you.

357
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:15,317
I am Catwoman...

358
00:42:16,372 --> 00:42:18,002
...hear me roar.

359
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:35,648
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant
is using her vacation time.

360
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,443
Good time. Anyone but the bandits'll be
slacking off till after the New Year anyway.

361
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:43,032
I'm not sure I like the inference, Bruce.

362
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,950
Im sorry Max.
I didn't realize I made one.

363
00:42:49,554 --> 00:42:53,486
I'm pushing this power plant now
because it'll cost more later.

364
00:42:53,965 --> 00:42:56,171
A million saved is a million earned.

365
00:42:56,938 --> 00:42:59,623
I commissioned this report. I thought
you might want to take a look at it.

366
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:05,474
The point is Max, Gotham City has a power
surplus. I'm sure you know that.

367
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,487
My question is:

368
00:43:08,446 --> 00:43:09,501
What's your angle?

369
00:43:09,597 --> 00:43:12,091
"Power surplus?" Bruce, shame on you!

370
00:43:12,954 --> 00:43:16,119
No such thing. One can never have
too much power.

371
00:43:16,406 --> 00:43:19,859
If my life has a meaning,
that's the meaning.

372
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:25,133
Yeah well, I'll fight you on this. I've already
spoken to the mayor and we agree.

373
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:26,668
Mayors come and go.

374
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,682
Blue bloods tire easy.

375
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,367
You think you could go 15 rounds
with Muhammad Shreck?

376
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:33,477
Well I guess we'll got to find out.

377
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:36,642
Of course, I don't have a crime boss
like Cobblepot in my corner.

378
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:39,039
"Crime boss?" Shows what you know...

379
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,916
..."Mr. To-The-Manor-Born-
With-A-Silver-Spoon. "

380
00:43:42,012 --> 00:43:44,122
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.

381
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,150
If his parents hadn't 86'ed him,
you'd have been bunkies at prep school.

382
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:51,890
Oswald controls the Red Triangle Gang.
I can't prove it yet, but we both-

383
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:54,575
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud-slinging
in this office.

384
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:58,028
If my assistant was here,
she already wouldve escorted you out-

385
00:43:58,124 --> 00:43:59,562
Anywhere he wants.

386
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:03,494
Preferably some nightspot grotto...

387
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,549
...or...

388
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,755
...secluded hideaway.

389
00:44:08,673 --> 00:44:09,920
Nice suit.

390
00:44:15,962 --> 00:44:20,085
That's my name, don't wear it out
or I'll make you buy me a new one.

391
00:44:24,209 --> 00:44:25,744
This is Bruce...

392
00:44:26,127 --> 00:44:27,182
...Wayne.

393
00:44:27,949 --> 00:44:29,004
Yeah we've met.

394
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:30,443
Have we?

395
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:33,608
No, I'm sorry. I mistook me
for somebody else.

396
00:44:35,046 --> 00:44:36,677
You mean, "mistook me. "

397
00:44:37,444 --> 00:44:39,362
Isn't that what I said?

398
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:41,568
I don't think so.

399
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,061
What happened?

400
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:48,089
Did you hurt yourself... on that ski slope?

401
00:44:49,623 --> 00:44:52,788
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?

402
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:57,391
It's a blur.

403
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:03,146
Not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...

404
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:06,406
...and Betsy Riley saying
it was morning sickness.

405
00:45:06,502 --> 00:45:09,571
And I remember the time I forgot to
wear my underpants to school...

406
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:13,311
...and the name of the boy who noticed
was Ricky Friedburg.

407
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,805
He's dead now.

408
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:17,531
But last night...

409
00:45:17,723 --> 00:45:19,449
...complete blur.

410
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,997
Couldn't you just die?

411
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:28,176
Please...

412
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:30,861
...show out Mr. Wayne.

413
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:32,492
With pleasure.

414
00:45:34,889 --> 00:45:36,711
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.

415
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:53,207
You don't seem like the type who
does business with mr Shreck.

416
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,892
No. You don't seem like the type
to take orders from him.

417
00:45:55,988 --> 00:45:57,330
Well, that's a...

418
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,057
...long story.

419
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,838
I could free up some time.

420
00:46:03,564 --> 00:46:05,482
- I'm listed.
- I'm tempted.

421
00:46:05,674 --> 00:46:06,921
I'm working.

422
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:09,318
I'm leaving.

423
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:11,716
You buy that blurry business?

424
00:46:11,908 --> 00:46:12,962
Women.

425
00:46:13,346 --> 00:46:15,168
Nothing surprises me...

426
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,374
...except your late mother.

427
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:20,635
Who'd have thought Selina
had a brain to damage?

428
00:46:20,826 --> 00:46:22,265
Bottom line?

429
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:26,485
If she tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out of a higher window.

430
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:27,731
Meantime...

431
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,033
...I've got badder fish to fry.

432
00:46:41,158 --> 00:46:42,404
Oswald...

433
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,322
...it's Max.

434
00:46:57,077 --> 00:46:58,420
You're home?

435
00:47:05,517 --> 00:47:06,860
How've you been?

436
00:47:08,394 --> 00:47:10,216
Your extended family?

437
00:47:10,696 --> 00:47:12,230
Good to have a family.

438
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,066
I'd mutch rather not be disturbed now.

439
00:47:16,354 --> 00:47:19,135
Come on downstairs, Oswald.
I have a surprise.

440
00:47:19,327 --> 00:47:21,245
I don't like surprises.

441
00:47:37,548 --> 00:47:38,507
Come on.

442
00:47:50,975 --> 00:47:52,221
Don't peek.

443
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:55,674
You'll spoil it.

444
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:21,855
Yes adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know.

445
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,787
But someone's got to supplant our
standing in the way of progress, Mayor.

446
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:29,240
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot,
you've got the magic.

447
00:48:29,431 --> 00:48:32,788
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.

448
00:48:34,802 --> 00:48:35,953
Mayor?

449
00:48:37,104 --> 00:48:38,254
Mayor.

450
00:48:40,172 --> 00:48:43,241
Elections happen in November.
It's late December.

451
00:48:43,433 --> 00:48:44,680
Don't worry.

452
00:48:44,872 --> 00:48:48,324
I want you to meet Jen and Josh,
my image consultants.

453
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:50,913
Here.

454
00:48:51,105 --> 00:48:53,023
Reclaim your birthright.

455
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:56,764
I'm Jen.

456
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,436
Okay, let's see. What I'd like to do first
is to put these little glovethings on you.

457
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:07,696
Our research tells us
that voters like fingers.

458
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:10,286
So if we were to just lose this...

459
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,738
We'll do it another time.

460
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,629
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
down in the sewer, huh?

461
00:49:29,562 --> 00:49:31,480
Still, it could be worse.

462
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:34,453
My nose could be gushing blood.

463
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:40,687
Your nose could be...
What do you mean by that?

464
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:46,729
Everybody, back to work!

465
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:48,934
Let's make...

466
00:49:49,606 --> 00:49:50,948
...a mayor!

467
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,196
You're right, we missed the
regularly scheduled election...

468
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:01,977
...but elected officials can be recalled,
impeached...

469
00:50:02,073 --> 00:50:04,662
...given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.

470
00:50:04,758 --> 00:50:06,293
Then think of you...

471
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:09,074
...Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.

472
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:11,471
I'd like to fill her void.

473
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:17,993
We'll need signatures to overturn
the ballot. I can supply those.

474
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:22,308
- Teach her my French flipper trick.
- We need one more thing.

475
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:25,953
A platform?

476
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:31,611
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world an icebox.

477
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:36,118
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled,
we must have a catalyst trigger.

478
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:38,899
"You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot. "

479
00:50:39,475 --> 00:50:42,160
"Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot. "

480
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,996
"I need you, Oswald. I need you now! "

481
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,791
"That's the biggest parasol I've ever seen. "

482
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:55,682
Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin,
or the Reichstag fire...

483
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,273
You want my old friends up there...

484
00:51:05,464 --> 00:51:07,958
...to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?

485
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,972
- Exactly.
- Sounds fun.

486
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:11,794
But...

487
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:15,055
...I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.

488
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:17,548
I have my own things to tend to.

489
00:51:17,932 --> 00:51:21,288
"Sidetracked?" This is your chance
to fulfill your destiny...

490
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,878
...that your parents carelessly discarded.

491
00:51:27,714 --> 00:51:29,632
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?

492
00:51:29,824 --> 00:51:32,701
Imagine, as mayor,
you have the ear of the media...

493
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:35,674
...access to the captains of industry...

494
00:51:36,249 --> 00:51:38,071
...unlimited poontang.

495
00:51:41,524 --> 00:51:43,825
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.

496
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:46,894
All right, I'll be mayor.

497
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,361
Burn, baby, burn!

498
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:29,928
- Who is she?
- What is she?

499
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:33,189
I don't know whether to open fire
or fall in love.

500
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,299
You poor guys.

501
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,655
Always confusing your pistols
with your privates.

502
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,546
Don't hurt us lady.
Our take-home's less than $300.

503
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,560
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

504
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,932
Go ahead and hit me.

505
00:55:41,663 --> 00:55:43,389
Admiring your handiwork?

506
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:47,417
Touring the riot scene.

507
00:55:48,856 --> 00:55:51,349
Gravely assessing the devastation.

508
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:55,281
"Upstanding-Mayor" stuff.

509
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:00,843
You're not the mayor.

510
00:56:02,665 --> 00:56:04,104
Things change.

511
00:56:06,022 --> 00:56:07,461
What do you want?

512
00:56:08,228 --> 00:56:10,050
The direct approach.

513
00:56:10,338 --> 00:56:12,831
I admire that in a man with a mask.

514
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:20,312
You don't really think you'll win, do you?

515
00:56:22,997 --> 00:56:24,435
Things change.

516
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:50,808
I saw her first. Got to fly.

517
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,390
How could you? I'm a woman!

518
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,308
I'm sorry.

519
00:57:55,830 --> 00:58:00,433
As I was saying, I'm a woman
and can't be taken for granted.

520
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:03,694
Life's a bitch, now so am I.

521
00:58:19,614 --> 00:58:20,765
Who are you?

522
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,258
Who's the man behind the bat?

523
00:58:25,176 --> 00:58:27,190
Maybe you can help me find...

524
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,108
...the woman...

525
00:58:29,684 --> 00:58:31,218
...behind the cat.

526
00:58:33,903 --> 00:58:35,534
No, that's not you.

527
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,329
There you are.

528
00:58:55,673 --> 00:58:57,495
Saved by Kitty Litter.

529
00:59:01,427 --> 00:59:02,578
Bastard!

530
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:20,224
Alfred...

531
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:23,389
...bring me some antiseptic ointment.

532
00:59:23,581 --> 00:59:25,691
Coming. Are you in pain, sir?

533
00:59:28,376 --> 00:59:29,718
Not really.

534
00:59:51,105 --> 00:59:53,694
I may have saved the mayor's baby...

535
00:59:55,228 --> 00:59:57,626
...but I refuse to save a mayor...

536
00:59:57,818 --> 01:00:00,407
...who stood by, helpless as a baby...

537
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:04,627
...while Gotham was ravaged
by a disease...

538
01:00:04,723 --> 01:00:08,847
...that turned Eagle Scouts
into crazed clowns...

539
01:00:09,326 --> 01:00:12,683
...and happy homemakers into catwomen.

540
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,409
Thank you.

541
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:22,273
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast,
today made his bid to run Gotham.

542
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:28,986
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest
role model a young person could have.

543
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:31,767
And you're the hottest young person...

544
01:00:31,863 --> 01:00:34,740
...a role model could have.

545
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,617
Here.

546
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,303
Wear a button.

547
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:43,851
Let me just get it on here.

548
01:00:47,495 --> 01:00:48,838
Thank you.

549
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,757
This mayor stuff is not about power,
it's about reaching out to people...

550
01:00:57,949 --> 01:00:59,963
...touching people, groping people.

551
01:01:00,058 --> 01:01:01,881
- Penguin-
- My name is not Penguin!

552
01:01:01,976 --> 01:01:04,182
It's Oswald Cobblepot.

553
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:07,827
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.

554
01:01:15,115 --> 01:01:17,704
Just the pussy I've been looking for.

555
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:24,034
It's chilly in here.

556
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:26,432
I'll warm you.

557
01:01:26,815 --> 01:01:28,254
Down, Oswald.

558
01:01:30,459 --> 01:01:31,898
We need to talk.

559
01:01:31,994 --> 01:01:33,337
You see...

560
01:01:33,528 --> 01:01:36,118
...you and I have something in common.

561
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:37,940
Sounds familiar.

562
01:01:38,419 --> 01:01:40,433
Appetite for destruction?

563
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,927
Contempt for the czars of fashion?

564
01:01:43,214 --> 01:01:44,941
Wait, don't tell me.

565
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:47,051
Naked sexual charisma?

566
01:01:48,489 --> 01:01:49,736
Batman.

567
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:52,901
The thorn in both our sides.

568
01:01:53,572 --> 01:01:55,586
The fly in our ointment.

569
01:01:56,161 --> 01:01:57,408
Ointment?

570
01:01:57,983 --> 01:02:00,765
I've got scented and unscented.

571
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:02,395
I'll come back later.

572
01:02:02,874 --> 01:02:06,615
Perchance, are you a registered voter?
I'm a mayoral prospect.

573
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,012
I have but one pet cause today:

574
01:02:09,971 --> 01:02:11,410
Ban the Bat.

575
01:02:11,889 --> 01:02:15,821
Oh, him again. No bother.
He's already history. Check it out.

576
01:02:16,493 --> 01:02:20,712
We'll disassemble his Batmobile
and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.

577
01:02:24,069 --> 01:02:26,466
He'd have even more power as a martyr.

578
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:30,974
To destroy Batman, we must first
turn him into what he hates the most.

579
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:32,892
Namely, us.

580
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:36,057
Frame him?

581
01:02:36,248 --> 01:02:39,221
Not even in office yet
and already an enemies list.

582
01:02:41,044 --> 01:02:43,537
Those names are not for prying eyes.

583
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,044
Why should I trust some catbroad anyway?

584
01:02:49,195 --> 01:02:53,127
Maybe you're a screwed-up sorority chick
getting back at her daddy...

585
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:56,771
...for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweet-sixteen.

586
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:14,609
Nice birdie.

587
01:03:29,378 --> 01:03:30,817
Nice kitty.

588
01:03:31,296 --> 01:03:32,639
Nice kitty.

589
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,078
Batman napalmed my arm.

590
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:45,682
He knocked me off a building just
when I started to feel good about myself.

591
01:03:45,778 --> 01:03:48,751
I want to play an integral part
in his degradation.

592
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:54,409
A plan is forming.

593
01:04:02,177 --> 01:04:03,424
I want in.

594
01:04:05,629 --> 01:04:08,794
The thought of busting Batman
makes me feel all...

595
01:04:10,808 --> 01:04:11,767
...dirty.

596
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:18,672
Maybe I'll just give myself a bath
right here.

597
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,948
I challenge the mayor...

598
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:34,784
...to re-light the Christmas tree
in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.

599
01:04:35,934 --> 01:04:40,442
Sir, shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and class?

600
01:04:41,017 --> 01:04:43,127
The Love Connection perhaps?

601
01:04:45,525 --> 01:04:47,634
...not that I have any faith in the mayor.

602
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,457
But I hope and pray...

603
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,183
...that Batman...

604
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,060
...will be present to preserve the peace.

605
01:04:55,403 --> 01:04:56,458
Subtle.

606
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:01,732
Why are you doing this?

607
01:05:03,938 --> 01:05:04,993
Selina?

608
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,308
Im sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

609
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,090
Scare me? No, I was just scaring myself.

610
01:05:12,857 --> 01:05:14,775
I don't see how, but...

611
01:05:15,063 --> 01:05:18,227
Anyway, It's nice to see you in the
real world, away from Shreck.

612
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:21,296
Yeah well...
It's nice to be here.

613
01:05:24,557 --> 01:05:25,900
Are you all right?

614
01:05:27,818 --> 01:05:30,886
You look like you have the holiday blues
or something.

615
01:05:33,572 --> 01:05:36,449
Boy, the news these days.

616
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:38,079
Weird!

617
01:05:39,134 --> 01:05:43,162
I heard on TV that Catwoman is
thought to weigh 140 pounds.

618
01:05:44,217 --> 01:05:46,327
I dont know how these
hacks sleep at night?

619
01:05:46,423 --> 01:05:49,108
It's not even accurate. "Batman blows it"?

620
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:52,369
He probably saved millions of dollars
in property damage alone.

621
01:05:53,615 --> 01:05:57,164
You're not going there are you the
re-lighting of the tree thing?

622
01:05:57,355 --> 01:06:00,328
No, I wouldn't be caught dead there.

623
01:06:00,712 --> 01:06:03,877
It's going to be a hot time
in the cold town tonight.

624
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,960
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?

625
01:06:09,151 --> 01:06:11,261
No darker than yours, Bruce.

626
01:06:14,618 --> 01:06:17,543
Listen, why don't you come over and
we can watch together on TV?

627
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:20,660
What?
The tree-lighting ceremony.

628
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,920
I can't. I have to be somewhere tonight.

629
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:26,414
How about if you come over and we
have a dinner, lets say five?

630
01:06:26,606 --> 01:06:27,852
Let's say six?

631
01:06:29,003 --> 01:06:29,737
Okey, five.

632
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:31,209
Five. You and me.

633
01:06:38,593 --> 01:06:41,566
The tree lights up
and then I push the button.

634
01:06:41,854 --> 01:06:43,005
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

635
01:06:43,197 --> 01:06:45,978
I press the button, and then the
tree lights up.

636
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:49,622
Who are you?

637
01:06:50,102 --> 01:06:51,540
Talent scout.

638
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:53,362
Come in.

639
01:06:53,938 --> 01:06:57,486
I don't just light trees.
I'm an actress as well.

640
01:06:59,212 --> 01:07:02,089
What is that thing?
A camera or something?

641
01:07:02,665 --> 01:07:04,391
Say, "Cheese! "

642
01:07:05,638 --> 01:07:07,172
Cheese.

643
01:07:17,817 --> 01:07:18,968
Thanks, Alfred.

644
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:23,476
I'm sure he's wonderful company...

645
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:26,736
...but doesn't the "gold-plated-bachelor" bit
get a little stale?

646
01:07:27,983 --> 01:07:31,627
A lot like the "lonely-secretary" syndrome,
I guess.

647
01:07:31,723 --> 01:07:33,450
Executive Assistant.

648
01:07:33,737 --> 01:07:34,696
Oh, sorry.

649
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:39,204
Secretary.

650
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,054
Any girlfriend?

651
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:48,890
Sure.

652
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:51,959
You mean, as in serious?

653
01:07:53,205 --> 01:07:55,028
No. Had one, didn't work.

654
01:07:55,411 --> 01:07:57,425
What went wrong? Hang on!

655
01:07:57,617 --> 01:07:58,960
I think I know!

656
01:07:59,439 --> 01:08:01,069
You kept things from her.

657
01:08:01,165 --> 01:08:02,700
I told her everything.

658
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:05,481
The truth frightened her?

659
01:08:05,577 --> 01:08:07,495
There are two truths...

660
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:10,564
...you know?

661
01:08:10,851 --> 01:08:14,112
She had trouble reconciling them
because I had trouble...

662
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:16,893
...reconciling them.

663
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:21,976
Vicki thought-

664
01:08:22,072 --> 01:08:23,031
Vicki?

665
01:08:24,086 --> 01:08:25,908
Ice skater or stewardess?

666
01:08:27,922 --> 01:08:30,224
No, she was a photojournalist.

667
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:33,293
Was Vicki right about your...

668
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,211
...difficulty with duality?

669
01:08:39,047 --> 01:08:40,293
You see...

670
01:08:41,157 --> 01:08:43,170
...if I say yes, then...

671
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:46,815
...you'll think of me as a...

672
01:08:47,007 --> 01:08:49,692
...Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and...

673
01:08:57,748 --> 01:08:59,666
You might not let me kiss you.

674
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:05,612
It's the so-called normal guys
who always let you down.

675
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,776
Sickos never scare me.
At least they're committed.

676
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:48,480
I can't do that.

677
01:09:48,672 --> 01:09:49,918
Neither can I.

678
01:09:50,014 --> 01:09:53,467
This is a special bulletin.
The Ice Princess has been kidnapped.

679
01:09:54,522 --> 01:09:59,509
Can you confirm reports of Batman's
suspected involvement in the abduction?

680
01:09:59,605 --> 01:10:02,194
The evidence is purely circumstantial.

681
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:06,989
This was found, stained with blood,
in the missing girl's dressing room.

682
01:10:08,523 --> 01:10:10,825
- I must go.
- No, it's your house.

683
01:10:11,209 --> 01:10:15,908
Hold on. Just sit for a second okey
and relax. I'll be right back.

684
01:10:24,923 --> 01:10:27,176
- Alfred. I've got to go to the plaza.
- I saw it!

685
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:30,389
- Yeah I know, he is begging me to show.
- Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.

686
01:10:30,485 --> 01:10:33,938
I can't. There's been a kidnapping.
Here's what I want you to do.

687
01:10:34,033 --> 01:10:34,993
Shit!

688
01:10:38,637 --> 01:10:43,432
Tell Selina, you know, Ms. Kyle,
tell her I had to go out of town.

689
01:10:43,528 --> 01:10:46,309
Tell her that a big business deal came up...
You know what?

690
01:10:46,884 --> 01:10:50,720
Let her know, not in some dumb
"be-my-girlfriend" kind of way-

691
01:10:50,912 --> 01:10:52,734
I will relay the message.

692
01:10:56,954 --> 01:10:59,448
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that-

693
01:10:59,831 --> 01:11:01,174
Bruce, yes...

694
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:04,243
Would you tell him...

695
01:11:04,435 --> 01:11:07,599
...I've been going through...
a lot of changes and...

696
01:11:09,517 --> 01:11:10,956
No.
Just that...

697
01:11:11,148 --> 01:11:13,066
...this is not a rejection...

698
01:11:13,545 --> 01:11:15,176
...my abruptly leaving.

699
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:17,669
In fact, he makes me feel the way...

700
01:11:18,244 --> 01:11:19,971
...I hope I really am.

701
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:25,917
No, could you just make up a sonnet or
something, a dirty limerick?

702
01:11:26,013 --> 01:11:27,835
One has just sprung to mind.

703
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:30,520
This way, ma'am.

704
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:30,842
Ladies and Gentlemen.

705
01:12:31,034 --> 01:12:34,391
Ladies and gentlemen please, if I can
have your attention for just a minute?

706
01:12:35,733 --> 01:12:37,939
Now folks, I know that to many of you...

707
01:12:38,227 --> 01:12:41,200
...Gotham seems a bit
beleaguered these days.

708
01:12:41,871 --> 01:12:44,269
But I want you to know that
your elected officials...

709
01:12:44,365 --> 01:12:46,379
...and your police department...

710
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:48,872
...have the situation well in hand.

711
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:47,996
Got to hurry.

712
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:48,969
Thank you.

713
01:13:49,003 --> 01:13:50,825
It was set up to look like I did it.

714
01:13:50,921 --> 01:13:54,373
I'll tell the police I was kidnapped
by an ugly birdman with fish breath.

715
01:13:54,469 --> 01:13:56,004
Did somebody say fish?

716
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:58,401
I haven't been fed all day.

717
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,511
Eat floor.

718
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:03,100
High fiber.

719
01:14:04,155 --> 01:14:05,498
Hey, stud...

720
01:14:05,594 --> 01:14:08,759
- ... I thought we had something together.
- We do.

721
01:14:24,103 --> 01:14:26,692
Got to go. Girl talk.

722
01:14:53,161 --> 01:14:57,285
She let me go. I think 'cause I reasoned
with her, girl-to-girl.

723
01:14:58,436 --> 01:15:01,121
Be careful. Don't move.

724
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,902
Lawn dart!

725
01:15:07,834 --> 01:15:09,944
Rats with wings, do your thing.

726
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,000
Batman pushed the Princess!

727
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:36,030
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

728
01:15:48,593 --> 01:15:50,895
You're catnip to a girl like me.

729
01:15:52,141 --> 01:15:53,772
Handsome, dazed...

730
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:56,841
...and to die for.

731
01:16:04,417 --> 01:16:06,814
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

732
01:16:07,582 --> 01:16:09,020
But a kiss...

733
01:16:09,308 --> 01:16:11,705
...can be even deadlier if you mean it.

734
01:16:20,816 --> 01:16:23,597
You're the second man
who's killed me this week.

735
01:16:23,789 --> 01:16:25,707
But I've got seven lives left.

736
01:16:25,899 --> 01:16:27,242
I tried to save you-

737
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:30,406
Seems like every woman
you try to save ends up dead.

738
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,516
Or deeply resentful.

739
01:16:33,475 --> 01:16:35,297
Maybe you should retire.

740
01:16:57,355 --> 01:16:58,506
Damn.

741
01:17:32,167 --> 01:17:33,606
Outstanding!

742
01:17:34,277 --> 01:17:36,483
You're Beauty and the Beast...

743
01:17:36,962 --> 01:17:40,607
...in one luscious Christmas gift pack.

744
01:17:40,799 --> 01:17:43,196
You said you were going to
scare the Ice Princess.

745
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:45,306
She looked pretty scared to me.

746
01:17:47,512 --> 01:17:49,334
A touch of the bubbly?

747
01:17:53,074 --> 01:17:55,088
So what are we waiting for?

748
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,541
Let's consummate our fiendish union.

749
01:17:58,636 --> 01:18:00,171
What are you talking about?

750
01:18:00,363 --> 01:18:01,609
Oh, come on.

751
01:18:02,089 --> 01:18:03,623
Can't you picture?

752
01:18:03,815 --> 01:18:05,829
It's dark in the mayor's mansion.

753
01:18:06,213 --> 01:18:10,336
I'm bushed, so here you come
into the bedroom...

754
01:18:10,528 --> 01:18:12,542
...twitching your little tail...

755
01:18:12,638 --> 01:18:16,043
...my slippers in one hand,
a dry martini in the other.

756
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:17,146
Oh please.

757
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:19,639
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.

758
01:18:19,735 --> 01:18:24,530
You lousy minx! I should have you spayed!
You sent out all the signals!

759
01:18:24,626 --> 01:18:26,928
I don't think I like you anymore!

760
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,518
Good-bye, my unintended.

761
01:18:36,997 --> 01:18:38,244
Go to heaven.

762
01:19:35,498 --> 01:19:36,649
There he is!

763
01:19:39,142 --> 01:19:40,868
Don't adjust your sets.

764
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,307
Welcome...

765
01:19:42,594 --> 01:19:46,431
...to the Oswald Cobblepot
School of Driving.

766
01:19:46,814 --> 01:19:50,075
Gentlemen, start your screaming.

767
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:25,846
This may be a bad time to mention it,
but my license has expired!

768
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:43,301
Just relax.

769
01:20:43,492 --> 01:20:47,712
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham!

770
01:21:32,786 --> 01:21:36,718
You got to admit I played this stinking
city, like a harp from hell!

771
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:58,392
Helpless old lady at 12 o clock high!

772
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,506
That's funny.

773
01:22:43,946 --> 01:22:45,576
Now I'm a little worried.

774
01:23:11,374 --> 01:23:13,867
So he survived. Whats to worry?

775
01:23:13,963 --> 01:23:17,703
He didn't even lose a limb!
An eyeball! Bladder control!

776
01:23:17,799 --> 01:23:21,539
The point is, listen to them.
They've lost faith in old symbols.

777
01:23:21,635 --> 01:23:24,512
They're ready to bond with you,
the icon of the future.

778
01:23:24,608 --> 01:23:26,430
If it works, don't fix it.

779
01:23:26,718 --> 01:23:29,020
We'll celebrate tonight at my annual
mascerade ball.

780
01:23:29,116 --> 01:23:31,034
Shreck and Cobblepot...

781
01:23:31,705 --> 01:23:34,294
...the visionary alliance.

782
01:23:52,612 --> 01:23:54,338
When it came time...

783
01:23:54,722 --> 01:23:58,462
...to ensure the safety of our fair city...

784
01:23:59,037 --> 01:24:01,243
...did the mayor have a plan?

785
01:24:02,106 --> 01:24:03,065
No!

786
01:24:04,504 --> 01:24:07,189
He relied on a man.

787
01:24:08,148 --> 01:24:10,354
A Batman.

788
01:24:10,641 --> 01:24:14,573
A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak...

789
01:24:14,669 --> 01:24:17,450
Our prime concern is
this ghastly grotesque.

790
01:24:18,026 --> 01:24:21,095
But let's not forget about
repairing the Batmobile.

791
01:24:21,382 --> 01:24:23,204
There's security to consider.

792
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:27,232
Its not if though we can take it to
any old Joess body shop. Is it?

793
01:24:27,424 --> 01:24:28,479
Security?

794
01:24:28,671 --> 01:24:30,877
Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave?

795
01:24:30,973 --> 01:24:35,096
I'm siting there and working, I turn around
and there she is. "Hi, Vick. Come on in. "

796
01:24:44,111 --> 01:24:46,317
- Ready?
- I think I'll take the stairs.

797
01:25:07,128 --> 01:25:11,539
You ask... am I up here for personal glory?

798
01:25:12,402 --> 01:25:13,457
No.

799
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,418
The glory that I yearn to recapture...

800
01:25:29,665 --> 01:25:31,679
...is the glory of Gotham!

801
01:25:49,133 --> 01:25:52,298
How can this be accomplished?

802
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,887
I know...

803
01:25:55,558 --> 01:25:58,052
...you're all concerned.

804
01:25:59,394 --> 01:26:00,545
Hey just relax.

805
01:26:01,217 --> 01:26:07,354
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham.

806
01:26:12,533 --> 01:26:14,068
I didn't say that.

807
01:26:16,369 --> 01:26:20,301
You got to admit I played
this stinking city...

808
01:26:20,397 --> 01:26:22,411
...like a harp from hell!

809
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:25,384
You got to admit...

810
01:26:25,576 --> 01:26:29,891
...I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!

811
01:27:20,144 --> 01:27:24,460
Why is there always someone who brings
eggs and tomatoes to a speech?

812
01:27:46,901 --> 01:27:48,339
There he is!

813
01:28:18,549 --> 01:28:19,891
My babies.

814
01:28:21,138 --> 01:28:22,768
Did you miss me?

815
01:28:36,195 --> 01:28:37,729
Did you miss me?

816
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:41,182
Great speech, Oswald.

817
01:28:42,332 --> 01:28:44,250
My name is not Oswald!

818
01:28:44,826 --> 01:28:46,264
It's Penguin!

819
01:28:46,552 --> 01:28:48,470
I am not a human being!

820
01:28:48,854 --> 01:28:52,019
I am an animal. Cold-blooded!

821
01:28:52,498 --> 01:28:53,937
Crank the A.C.!

822
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:56,814
Where are my lists? Bring me the names!

823
01:28:57,869 --> 01:28:59,211
It's time.

824
01:28:59,499 --> 01:29:03,719
These are the names of the first-born sons
of Gotham City.

825
01:29:03,815 --> 01:29:05,349
Just like I was.

826
01:29:05,733 --> 01:29:09,569
And like me, a terrible fate waits for them.

827
01:29:10,432 --> 01:29:13,501
Tonight, while their parents party...

828
01:29:13,788 --> 01:29:16,186
...they'll be dreaming away...

829
01:29:16,282 --> 01:29:18,296
...in their safe cribs...

830
01:29:18,488 --> 01:29:20,310
...their soft beds...

831
01:29:20,693 --> 01:29:22,707
...and we'll snatch them...

832
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,817
...carry them into the sewer...

833
01:29:25,009 --> 01:29:29,133
...and toss them into a deep, dark,
watery grave.

834
01:29:30,092 --> 01:29:31,243
Penguin?

835
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:34,311
Killing sleeping children...

836
01:29:34,407 --> 01:29:36,421
...isn't that a little...

837
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:47,450
No, it's a lot.

838
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,287
A reminder.

839
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:02,699
Tonight is that loathsome party hosted
by the odious Mr. Shreck.

840
01:30:02,794 --> 01:30:05,863
May we RSVP
in the resoundingly negative?

841
01:30:06,055 --> 01:30:07,206
Not interested.

842
01:30:09,316 --> 01:30:10,563
Although...

843
01:30:13,248 --> 01:30:14,878
...Selina Kyle might be there.

844
01:30:37,127 --> 01:30:38,758
Ingenious costume.

845
01:30:39,141 --> 01:30:40,580
Let me guess.

846
01:30:40,772 --> 01:30:42,690
Trust-fund goody-goody?

847
01:30:43,937 --> 01:30:45,375
Feeling good?

848
01:30:46,334 --> 01:30:49,595
You almost made a monster the mayor
of Gotham City.

849
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:52,184
I am the light of this city...

850
01:30:52,568 --> 01:30:54,965
...and I am its mean, twisted soul.

851
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:56,979
Does it matter who's mayor?

852
01:30:57,075 --> 01:30:58,226
It does to me.

853
01:30:58,610 --> 01:30:59,760
Yawn.

854
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,793
Listen I'm sorry about yesterday,
but I had...

855
01:31:38,889 --> 01:31:42,533
...a pretty big deal come through.
Fall through, actually.

856
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:45,410
It's okay. I had to go home
and feed my cat.

857
01:31:53,753 --> 01:31:55,288
No hard feelings then?

858
01:31:57,685 --> 01:31:59,124
Actually...

859
01:32:01,138 --> 01:32:02,960
...semi-hard, I'd say.

860
01:32:08,906 --> 01:32:13,222
There's a big, comfy California King
over in Bedding.

861
01:32:13,797 --> 01:32:15,331
What do you say...

862
01:32:16,482 --> 01:32:18,208
We take off our costumes?

863
01:32:22,524 --> 01:32:24,058
I guess I'm tired of wearing masks.

864
01:32:24,442 --> 01:32:25,689
Me too.

865
01:32:27,031 --> 01:32:28,758
Let me ask you something.

866
01:32:30,292 --> 01:32:31,731
Why'd you come tonight?

867
01:32:32,498 --> 01:32:34,128
- You first.
- To see you.

868
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:37,389
Thats lovely.

869
01:32:39,307 --> 01:32:43,047
And I really wish I could say the same,
but I came for Max.

870
01:32:44,965 --> 01:32:46,500
Do you mean you...

871
01:32:46,883 --> 01:32:48,130
Not you and Max?

872
01:32:49,568 --> 01:32:50,911
Me and Max?

873
01:32:57,432 --> 01:32:58,967
No. This and Max.

874
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:06,927
Don't give me a killing Max won't
solve anything speech, because it will.

875
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:11,051
Aren't you tired of this
sanctimonious robber baron...

876
01:33:11,146 --> 01:33:13,160
...allways coming out on top when
he should be six feet under?

877
01:33:13,256 --> 01:33:17,284
You may have problems with your boss,
but who do you think you are?

878
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:22,847
I don't know anymore, Bruce.

879
01:33:36,273 --> 01:33:38,287
A kiss under the mistletoe.

880
01:33:41,452 --> 01:33:43,561
"Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it. "

881
01:33:43,595 --> 01:33:45,767
"But a kiss can be even deadlier...

882
01:33:48,165 --> 01:33:49,603
"... if you mean it. "

883
01:33:59,481 --> 01:34:00,920
Oh, my God.

884
01:34:01,783 --> 01:34:04,180
Does this mean we have to start fighting?

885
01:34:05,235 --> 01:34:06,770
Let's go outside.

886
01:34:41,103 --> 01:34:43,117
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

887
01:34:50,981 --> 01:34:52,803
You didn't invite me...

888
01:34:52,995 --> 01:34:54,625
...so I crashed!

889
01:34:58,078 --> 01:34:59,037
What do you want?

890
01:34:59,132 --> 01:35:00,955
Right now, my troops...

891
01:35:01,146 --> 01:35:03,352
...are fanning out across town...

892
01:35:03,544 --> 01:35:05,366
...for your children!

893
01:35:05,558 --> 01:35:06,517
Yes!

894
01:35:06,709 --> 01:35:09,298
For your first-born sons!

895
01:35:09,586 --> 01:35:12,175
The ones you left defenseless at home...

896
01:35:12,463 --> 01:35:14,765
...so you could dress up like jerks...

897
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:17,546
...get juiced and dance...

898
01:35:17,642 --> 01:35:18,888
...badly!

899
01:35:23,492 --> 01:35:25,601
I've personally come...

900
01:35:25,793 --> 01:35:27,999
...for Gotham's favorite son...

901
01:35:28,287 --> 01:35:29,917
...Mr. Chip Shreck.

902
01:35:31,547 --> 01:35:34,520
You're coming with me,
you Great White Dope...

903
01:35:34,808 --> 01:35:37,397
...to die, way down in the sewer!

904
01:35:37,781 --> 01:35:42,097
Not Chip. If you have any human feeling,
take me instead.

905
01:35:43,343 --> 01:35:45,357
I don't. So, no!

906
01:35:45,645 --> 01:35:46,604
I'm the one you want.

907
01:35:46,796 --> 01:35:50,632
Ask yourself, Isn't it Max Shreck who
manipulated and betrayed you?

908
01:35:50,824 --> 01:35:53,221
Isn't it Max, not Chip...

909
01:35:53,509 --> 01:35:57,537
...you want to see immersed
to his eyeballs in raw sewage?

910
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:03,579
Okay, you got a point.

911
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:06,264
I'll let the little prince live, for now.

912
01:36:06,744 --> 01:36:07,894
In the duck!

913
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,802
This is going to be good...

914
01:36:36,569 --> 01:36:41,364
...to cut down a whole crop
of Gotham's most promising...

915
01:36:41,652 --> 01:36:43,378
...before their prime.

916
01:36:45,392 --> 01:36:48,269
You ask me... how do I lure them in?

917
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:54,215
A little "Pied Penguin" action.

918
01:36:56,709 --> 01:36:59,298
And you get to watch them sink...

919
01:36:59,394 --> 01:37:01,600
...into a deep puddle...

920
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:04,381
...of your industrial by-products.

921
01:37:04,573 --> 01:37:05,723
Then...

922
01:37:05,915 --> 01:37:07,450
...you join them.

923
01:37:39,961 --> 01:37:42,934
Would you hurry up and get
those kids loaded allready.

924
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:53,483
Right this way, kiddies.

925
01:37:54,058 --> 01:37:55,497
Come with me.

926
01:38:11,321 --> 01:38:13,526
So where are all the children?

927
01:38:17,362 --> 01:38:18,609
"Dear Penguin:

928
01:38:18,801 --> 01:38:21,870
"The children regret
they're unable to attend.

929
01:38:22,349 --> 01:38:23,596
"Batman! "

930
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:38,269
My dear penguins...

931
01:38:39,612 --> 01:38:42,872
...we stand on a great threshold!

932
01:38:43,448 --> 01:38:45,749
It's okay to be scared!

933
01:38:46,037 --> 01:38:48,627
Many of you won't be coming back.

934
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:50,449
Thanks to Batman...

935
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,846
...the time has come...

936
01:38:53,038 --> 01:38:55,436
...to punish all God's children!

937
01:38:56,874 --> 01:39:00,135
First-, second-, third- and fourth-born!

938
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:02,149
Why be biased?

939
01:39:02,245 --> 01:39:03,971
Male and female!

940
01:39:04,834 --> 01:39:07,136
Hell, the sexes are equal...

941
01:39:07,711 --> 01:39:09,821
...with their erogenous zones...

942
01:39:10,013 --> 01:39:12,027
...blown sky-high!

943
01:39:14,232 --> 01:39:15,383
Forward...

944
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:17,781
...march!

945
01:39:18,164 --> 01:39:21,233
The liberation of Gotham...

946
01:39:21,425 --> 01:39:23,823
...has begun!

947
01:40:06,116 --> 01:40:08,321
The penguins are moving above ground.

948
01:40:32,681 --> 01:40:34,119
Penguin army...

949
01:40:34,311 --> 01:40:38,435
...approaching launch destination
at Gotham Plaza.

950
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:41,216
One minute until ignition.

951
01:40:41,312 --> 01:40:43,517
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal...

952
01:40:43,709 --> 01:40:46,299
...so I'm laying them on a slab!

953
01:40:47,162 --> 01:40:50,135
Penguins seem to be converging
on Gotham Plaza.

954
01:41:12,096 --> 01:41:15,069
Thirty seconds until ignition.

955
01:41:16,316 --> 01:41:19,385
Estimated casualties after launch:

956
01:41:20,056 --> 01:41:22,070
100,000 people.

957
01:41:24,755 --> 01:41:28,016
The penguins have reached
Gotham Square.

958
01:41:46,046 --> 01:41:48,539
Fifteen seconds to ignition.

959
01:41:50,841 --> 01:41:52,663
Ready when you are, sir.

960
01:41:54,389 --> 01:41:56,020
I've got the coordinates.

961
01:42:03,596 --> 01:42:05,226
Let's turn them around.

962
01:42:13,378 --> 01:42:14,816
Something is wrong.

963
01:42:16,543 --> 01:42:19,228
Something hasjammed the signal.

964
01:42:28,339 --> 01:42:30,640
They seem to be turning around.

965
01:43:00,466 --> 01:43:03,439
There is also something coming this way.

966
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:06,508
Very large. Very fast.

967
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:23,866
Who's there?

968
01:43:29,908 --> 01:43:32,114
I'm homing in on the signal's origin.

969
01:44:45,287 --> 01:44:48,548
You're jealous
because I'm a genuine freak...

970
01:44:48,644 --> 01:44:50,849
...and you have to wear a mask!

971
01:44:50,945 --> 01:44:53,247
You might be right.

972
01:44:54,781 --> 01:44:59,481
But what it all comes down to is:
Who's holding the umbrella?

973
01:45:24,032 --> 01:45:25,662
My babies!

974
01:46:58,783 --> 01:47:03,099
I don't know what you want, but I know
I can get it for you, with a minimum of fuss.

975
01:47:04,825 --> 01:47:05,880
Money.

976
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:07,127
Jewels.

977
01:47:07,318 --> 01:47:09,812
A very big ball of string.

978
01:47:13,168 --> 01:47:14,703
Your blood, Max.

979
01:47:14,895 --> 01:47:17,004
I gave at the office.

980
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:19,882
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.

981
01:47:19,977 --> 01:47:20,841
Let's make a deal!

982
01:47:20,936 --> 01:47:22,855
Other than my blood, what can I do for you?

983
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:25,156
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.

984
01:47:36,377 --> 01:47:38,391
You're not just saving a life-

985
01:47:38,487 --> 01:47:40,309
Shut up. You're going to jail.

986
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:45,775
Don't be naive. The law doesn't
apply to people like him... or us.

987
01:47:45,871 --> 01:47:47,597
Wrong on both counts.

988
01:47:57,283 --> 01:47:58,434
Why doing this?

989
01:48:02,366 --> 01:48:04,188
Let's just take him to the police.

990
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:07,449
Then we can go home...

991
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:09,655
...together.

992
01:48:15,505 --> 01:48:16,943
Selina...

993
01:48:20,108 --> 01:48:21,739
...don't you see?

994
01:48:22,698 --> 01:48:24,040
We're the same.

995
01:48:26,054 --> 01:48:27,493
We're the same.

996
01:48:28,931 --> 01:48:30,082
Split...

997
01:48:30,274 --> 01:48:32,288
...right down the center.

998
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:54,153
Selina... please.

999
01:48:55,017 --> 01:48:56,167
Bruce...

1000
01:48:56,935 --> 01:49:00,675
...I would love to live with you
in your castle...

1001
01:49:02,017 --> 01:49:04,607
...forever, just like in a fairy tale.

1002
01:49:10,745 --> 01:49:14,677
I just couldn't live with myself.
So don't pretend this is a happy ending.

1003
01:49:16,595 --> 01:49:18,513
Selina Kyle.

1004
01:49:18,896 --> 01:49:20,623
You're fired.

1005
01:49:21,006 --> 01:49:22,636
And Bruce Wayne...

1006
01:49:22,732 --> 01:49:24,842
...why are you dressed up like Batman?

1007
01:49:24,938 --> 01:49:27,815
Because he is Batman, you moron!

1008
01:49:28,678 --> 01:49:29,925
Was.

1009
01:49:32,131 --> 01:49:33,090
Don't.

1010
01:49:33,282 --> 01:49:37,022
You killed me, the Penguin killed me,
Batman killed me.

1011
01:49:37,118 --> 01:49:39,899
Three lives down.
Got enough to finish me off?

1012
01:49:39,995 --> 01:49:41,529
One way to find out.

1013
01:49:45,173 --> 01:49:46,133
Four.

1014
01:49:46,228 --> 01:49:47,283
Five.

1015
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:52,078
Still alive!

1016
01:50:01,189 --> 01:50:02,436
Six.

1017
01:50:02,724 --> 01:50:03,779
Seven.

1018
01:50:03,874 --> 01:50:06,560
All good girls go to heaven.

1019
01:50:11,834 --> 01:50:13,369
Two lives left.

1020
01:50:15,287 --> 01:50:17,780
I think I'll save one for next Christmas.

1021
01:50:20,178 --> 01:50:22,096
But in the meantime...

1022
01:50:23,726 --> 01:50:25,932
...how about a kiss, Santie Claus?

1023
01:51:53,299 --> 01:51:54,258
Shit!

1024
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:56,847
I picked a cute one.

1025
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:02,026
The heat's getting to me.

1026
01:52:02,889 --> 01:52:05,574
I'll murder you momentarily.

1027
01:52:07,205 --> 01:52:08,835
But first...

1028
01:52:09,123 --> 01:52:11,616
...I need a cool drink...

1029
01:52:11,904 --> 01:52:14,302
...of ice water.

1030
01:53:51,259 --> 01:53:52,985
Alfred, stop the car.

1031
01:55:10,666 --> 01:55:12,008
Well, come what may...

1032
01:55:12,488 --> 01:55:14,406
...Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.

1033
01:55:15,365 --> 01:55:17,379
Merry Christmas, Alfred.

1034
01:55:18,626 --> 01:55:20,544
Goodwill toward men.

1035
01:55:22,654 --> 01:55:23,804
And women.

1036
01:55:51,232 --> 01:55:53,726
