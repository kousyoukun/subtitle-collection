1
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:38,864
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

2
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,906
Penguin sighting! Man or myth?

3
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:33,148
What is he? Today's edition.
Another penguin sighting.

4
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,795
Another penguin sighting!
Check it out!

5
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:40,350
Penguin man living in Gotham's sewers!
Read all about the latest sighting!

6
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,380
May I have your attention, Gotham City?

7
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,631
It is time for tonight's
lighting of the tree.

8
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,625
How about that?

9
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:15,067
Part man, part penguin! All horrifying!

10
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:18,395
Find out for only 50 cents! Come on!

11
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:22,749
Read about the possible terror
beneath our feet! Check it out!

12
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,437
Read about it!

13
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,031
Missing link between man and bird.

14
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,393
My dear boy...

15
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:33,395
Sometimes it's a diversion
to read such rubbish.

16
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,639
Usually, it's a waste of time.

17
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:39,111
Whatever. Today's issue!
The Penguin. Man or myth?

18
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:42,438
The Globe! Right here! 25 cents!

19
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,642
Well, here's hoping.

20
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:11,354
With luck, Gotham will have its first
merry Christmas in years.

21
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:13,991
I feel almost vulgar
in this Yuletide context...

22
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,484
mentioning the new power plant.

23
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:20,273
But if we're to break ground
when we must, I'll need permits...

24
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:24,003
variances, tax incentives.
That sort of pesky nonsense.

25
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,804
Power plant?

26
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:31,321
Studies show we've enough power to get
us into the middle of the next century.

27
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,761
Your analysts foresee growth at 1% per annum.
That's not growth... that's a mild swelling.

28
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,562
Imagine...

29
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,288
a Gotham City...

30
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,249
of the future, lit up
like a blanket of stars...

31
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:46,963
but blinking on and off...

32
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:49,447
embarrassingly low on juice.

33
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:50,972
Frankly...

34
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,523
I cringe, Mr. Mayor.

35
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:57,368
Sorry, any plans must go
to the usual committees...

36
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:59,373
through the usual channels.

37
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,204
I have a suggestion.

38
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:09,845
Well...

39
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,528
actually, really, just
more like a question.

40
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:18,928
I'm afraid we haven't
properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.

41
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,651
In the plus column, though...

42
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:23,493
she makes a hell of a cup of coffee.

43
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:32,651
Dad.

44
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,130
Mr. Mayor. Time to go down
and bring joy to the masses.

45
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:49,061
Actually, more of a question.

46
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:50,892
You stupid corn dog.

47
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,779
Corn dog, corn dog.

48
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:23,663
I have enough signatures
from Shreck employees to warrant a recall.

49
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,262
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.

50
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:30,299
Maybe. But you sure as hell
don't have an issue or a candidate.

51
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,579
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

52
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:37,588
From those of us at City Hall
to each and every one of you...

53
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:39,065
Happy holidays.

54
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:44,148
We have with us a man who needs
no introduction, he's given us so much.

55
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:48,262
Please welcome Gotham's
own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.

56
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:11,711
Pick up those contracts
for personnel and...

57
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,550
pick up the dry cleaning
and paper towels...

58
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:18,194
Darn!

59
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:25,310
I forgot my speech.

60
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:28,043
Remind me to take it out
on what's-her-name.

61
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:33,596
Santa Claus?

62
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:35,073
Afraid not.

63
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:38,631
I'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.

64
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,431
Sue me...

65
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,915
if I want to give some back.

66
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,593
I only wish I could hand out more
than just...

67
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,358
expensive baubles.

68
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,155
I wish I could hand out world peace...

69
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:58,032
and unconditional love...

70
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,475
wrapped in a big bow.

71
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:04,640
Oh, but you can.

72
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:06,798
Oh, but you will.

73
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:14,921
Merry Christmas.

74
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:29,201
Great idea.

75
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,870
Not mine.

76
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:23,608
What are you waiting for? The signal!

77
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:56,695
We want the big guy!
The guy who runs the show!

78
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:00,454
What do you want?

79
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,768
Not you!

80
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:03,581
Shreck!

81
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,901
You'll have to go through me.

82
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,575
Dad, go! Save yourself!

83
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:10,773
Dad, go!

84
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,629
Shut up!

85
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:12,006
Take one step closer,
Mr. Manbat, and I'll...

86
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:18,796
You missed.

87
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:32,798
The Batman.

88
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:35,445
Or is it just Batman?

89
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:41,199
Your choice, of course.

90
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:44,843
Well, that was...

91
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:46,445
very brief.

92
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:49,005
Just like all the men in my life.

93
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:51,087
What men?

94
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:52,832
Well...

95
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,966
then again, there's you,
but you need therapy.

96
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:21,488
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
The Circus Gang is back.

97
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:22,773
We'll see.

98
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:26,207
They almost made off with our mover
and shaker, Max Shreck.

99
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:28,930
Where is that insufferable son of a bitch?

100
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:45,941
I believe the word you're looking for is...

101
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:59,301
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.

102
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:02,149
You're at home in bed...

103
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:05,103
heavily sedated, resting comfortably...

104
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:09,265
dying from the carcinogens
you've personally spewed...

105
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,699
in a lifetime of profiteering.

106
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:14,387
Tragic irony...

107
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,305
or poetic justice?

108
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:17,868
You tell me.

109
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:20,707
My God, it's true.

110
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,104
Penguin Man of the sewer.

111
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,232
Odd as it may seem, Max...

112
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:32,791
You and I have something in common.

113
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,260
We're both perceived as monsters.

114
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:42,908
But somehow...

115
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:46,802
you're a well-respected monster...

116
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,037
and I am, to date...

117
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,195
not!

118
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:54,753
Frankly, I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman.

119
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:56,431
Tough, yes.

120
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:59,874
Shrewd, okay. But that does not
make me a monster.

121
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:02,837
Don't embarrass yourself, Max!

122
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,918
I know all about you.

123
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:07,239
What you hide, I discover.

124
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:10,318
What you put in your toilet...

125
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,233
I place on my mantle.
Get the picture?

126
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,072
Is that supposed to hypnotize me?

127
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:18,748
No, just give you a splitting headache.

128
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:20,954
It's not working.

129
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:23,677
Oh, you big baby!

130
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:25,519
Just blanks.

131
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,722
Would I go through all this trouble
just to kill you?

132
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,151
No, Max.

133
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:32,913
I have an entirely other purpose.

134
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:35,560
I'm ready, Max.

135
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,283
I've been down here too long.

136
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,844
It's time for me to ascend...

137
00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:43,165
to re-emerge...

138
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,243
with your help...

139
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:47,922
your know-how...

140
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:49,562
your savvy.

141
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,928
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.

142
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:55,479
I come from...

143
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:57,407
like you.

144
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:00,150
And, like you, I want some respect!

145
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:03,353
A recognition of my basic humanity.

146
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,520
But most of all...

147
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,762
I want to find out who I am...

148
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:10,843
by finding my parents...

149
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:13,049
learning my human name.

150
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:17,681
Simple stuff that the good people
of Gotham take for granted!

151
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:20,251
And...

152
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:23,051
exactly why am I going to help you?

153
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:25,890
Well...

154
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,769
Let's start.

155
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,887
Let's see what we have in here.

156
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:47,891
A batch of toxic waste...

157
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,439
from your clean textile plant!

158
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:55,409
There's a whole lagoon of this crud
in the back!

159
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,692
It could have come from anywhere.

160
00:20:58,104 --> 00:21:02,410
What about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?

161
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,731
If there were such documents...

162
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:06,611
that's not an admission...

163
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:08,654
they would've been shredded.

164
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:10,812
Good idea.

165
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,895
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference.

166
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:20,057
By the way...

167
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,848
how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?

168
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:24,219
Fred?

169
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,856
Fred's actually...

170
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:30,414
I believe he's on an extended vacation.
He's good.

171
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:34,941
Good.

172
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,621
Hiya, Max. Remember me?
I'm Fred's hand!

173
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:43,333
Want to greet any other body parts?

174
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,260
Remember, Max...

175
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,696
You flush it, I flaunt it.

176
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:51,571
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?

177
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,227
I think, perhaps...

178
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,660
I could help orchestrate
a "Welcome Home" scenario for you.

179
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:05,065
Once we're both back home,
perhaps we could help each other.

180
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:08,661
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

181
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:17,829
Honey, I'm home!

182
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,184
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

183
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,673
Miss Kitty.

184
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:38,430
Back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share?

185
00:22:40,722 --> 00:22:42,467
Not that I'd ever pry.

186
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:45,670
Drink your dinner.

187
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,113
What?

188
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,795
How can anyone be so pathetic?

189
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,197
Yes, to you I seem pathetic,
but I'm a working girl.

190
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,033
Must pay the rent. Maybe if you
chipped in instead of stepping out.

191
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:10,155
Selina, dear, it's your mother.
Just calling to say hello.

192
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:11,593
Yeah, but...

193
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,960
But I'm disappointed you're not
coming home for Christmas.

194
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:18,393
I want to discuss why you insist
on languishing in Gotham City...

195
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,397
as some lowly secretary.

196
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,152
Lowly assistant.

197
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:27,034
Selina, about that Christmas getaway
we planned...

198
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:32,721
I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need
to be my own person, not an appendage.

199
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,475
Some appendage!

200
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:47,356
The party never stops
on Selina Kyle's answering machine.

201
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,324
I should've let him win
that last racquetball game.

202
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,599
Hello...

203
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:55,201
Selina Kyle.

204
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:58,644
We're calling to tell you about exciting,
new Gotham Lady perfume.

205
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,123
It makes women feel like women
and the men have no complaints either.

206
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,759
This is yourself reminding you to come
all the way back to the office...

207
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:14,564
- if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file...
- You stupid corn dog!

208
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:34,809
Working late?

209
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:41,005
I'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne
meeting in the morning.

210
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:45,052
I pulled all the files
on the proposed power plant...

211
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:51,535
and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment.
I even opened the protected files...

212
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,048
How industrious!

213
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,893
How did you open the protected files?

214
00:24:58,862 --> 00:24:59,975
May I ask?

215
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:09,450
I figured your password was "Geraldo",
your Chihuahua, and it was.

216
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:21,016
This is all very interesting,
though a bit on the technical side...

217
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:26,655
about how the power plant
is a power plant in name only...

218
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:30,175
since, in fact, it's going to be
a big, giant...

219
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:32,735
big, giant... capacitor.

220
00:25:35,306 --> 00:25:39,142
And, instead of generating power,
it'll be sucking power from...

221
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:41,376
Gotham City...

222
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:43,975
and storing it...

223
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:46,181
stockpiling it...

224
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:49,384
which is a very novel approach, I'd say.

225
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:53,700
Who'd you say this to?

226
00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:58,179
Nobody.

227
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:06,657
What did curiosity do to the cat?

228
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:10,148
I'm no cat.

229
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,785
I'm just an assistant.

230
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:14,348
A secretary.

231
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:16,621
And a very good one.

232
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:18,654
Too good?

233
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:20,860
Listen...

234
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:23,027
It's our secret. Honest.

235
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,029
How can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless?

236
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:27,621
This power plant...

237
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,709
is my legacy,
it's what I leave behind...

238
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:32,100
for Chip.

239
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:34,469
Nothing must prevent that.

240
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:41,662
Go ahead. Intimidate me.
Bully me, if it makes you feel big.

241
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:43,992
It's not like you can kill me!

242
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,668
Actually, it's a lot like that.

243
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:06,472
For a second, you really frightened me.

244
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:17,837
Really?

245
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:31,721
Honey, I'm home!

246
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:36,842
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

247
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:13,977
Selina, this is your mother.
Call me.

248
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:18,935
Selina, this is your mother.
Why haven't you called me back?

249
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:21,256
Hello, Selina Kyle.

250
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:25,370
We're just calling to make sure
you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.

251
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:29,532
One whiff of this and your boss
will ask you to stay after work...

252
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:32,333
for a candlelight staff meeting for two.

253
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:36,332
Gotham Lady perfume.
Exclusively at Shreck's department store.

254
00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:17,125
I don't know about you,
Miss Kitty, but I feel...

255
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:19,599
so much yummier.

256
00:32:37,495 --> 00:32:39,010
Ladies and gentlemen,

257
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:45,483
I stand before you again to denounce
the urban chaos we live with in our city.

258
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:48,044
It's got to stop.

259
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:51,123
It's going to stop!
Our community is coming apart...

260
00:32:51,382 --> 00:32:54,527
in a season when
it should be coming together.

261
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:58,047
I don't care what the cynics may say.
This is the Christmas season...

262
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,725
and should be a healing time.

263
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:02,276
I say that not only as an official...

264
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:05,173
but as a husband and a father.

265
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:07,963
Last night's violence won't happen again.

266
00:33:11,176 --> 00:33:14,130
I'm not good at speeches,
so I'll just say, thanks.

267
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,737
It's the hideous Penguin Man.

268
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:27,777
Take the baby.
Just don't hurt me, please!

269
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:22,462
This was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.

270
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:25,981
The mysterious Penguin saving the life
of the mayor's baby...

271
00:34:26,154 --> 00:34:29,741
- and announcing his presence.
- All I want in return...

272
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:32,148
is a chance...

273
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:34,507
to find my mom and dad.

274
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:38,708
A chance to find out who they are...

275
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,268
and thusly...

276
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:42,985
who I am.

277
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:44,990
And then...

278
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:47,061
with my parents...

279
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:49,430
try to understand why...

280
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:54,263
Why they did what I guess
they felt they had to do...

281
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:57,946
to a child...

282
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:00,152
who was born...

283
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:04,909
a little different.

284
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:07,776
A child...

285
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,749
who spent his first Christmas...

286
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,435
and many since...

287
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:16,187
in a sewer.

288
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,508
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?

289
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:23,073
His parents.

290
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,471
This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.

291
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,511
I hope he finds them.

292
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:33,268
Here he is, standing alongside
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.

293
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,193
How about a statement?
People want to know.

294
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:49,638
- Penguin's not to be disturbed!
- It's a public place!

295
00:35:49,763 --> 00:35:52,199
- Walk. Now. Move.
- Freedom of the press!

296
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:53,753
Wait a minute.

297
00:35:54,846 --> 00:35:58,040
What about the freedom
to rediscover your roots...

298
00:35:58,529 --> 00:36:00,437
with dignity and privacy?

299
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,835
Is the Penguin a personal friend?

300
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:06,518
He's a personal friend of the whole city,
so have a heart.

301
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:09,443
Give the Constitution a rest.
It's Christmas.

302
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:51,007
Red Triangle Circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions.

303
00:36:55,055 --> 00:36:57,328
Circus returns for a two-week...

304
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:59,006
Kids will love...

305
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:00,531
Thanks.

306
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:05,642
It's cold!

307
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:07,091
It's vichyssoise.

308
00:37:08,222 --> 00:37:09,891
It's supposed to be cold.

309
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:15,492
Circus is back with a freak show,
may not be suitable for kids...

310
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:17,573
featuring a poodle lady...

311
00:37:17,822 --> 00:37:19,731
the world's fattest man...

312
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,013
and Aquatic Bird Boy.

313
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:25,533
Why are you determined to prove...

314
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:28,535
that this Penguin is not what he seems?

315
00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:31,891
Must you be the only lonely "man-beast"
in town?

316
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:34,136
The circus folded its tents yesterday...

317
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:37,291
after reports of missing children
in several towns.

318
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:40,369
Police have closed down
the Red Triangle fairgrounds.

319
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:44,004
However, at least one
freak-show performer vanished before...

320
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:46,536
he could be questioned.

321
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,132
I suppose you feel better now.

322
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:53,815
No.

323
00:37:55,062 --> 00:37:56,980
Actually, I feel worse.

324
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,180
Why're you still out?

325
00:38:16,266 --> 00:38:20,016
Are you concerned about that strange,
heroic Penguin person?

326
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,939
I think he knows who his parents are.

327
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:27,420
There's something else.

328
00:40:18,928 --> 00:40:20,117
Mr. Penguin...

329
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:22,716
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly!

330
00:40:24,365 --> 00:40:25,718
I am a man!

331
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:28,317
I have a name!

332
00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:33,764
Oswald Cobblepot!

333
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:38,319
You'll never be able to settle with them?

334
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:42,760
True.

335
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:45,963
I was their number one son...

336
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:48,754
and they treated me like number two.

337
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,957
But it's human nature to fear...

338
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:54,767
the unusual.

339
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:57,049
Perhaps...

340
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:58,968
when I held my...

341
00:40:59,092 --> 00:41:01,010
Tiffany baby rattle...

342
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:03,964
with a shiny flipper...

343
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:06,841
instead of five chubby digits...

344
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,891
they freaked.

345
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:15,204
But I forgive them.

346
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:19,731
Penguin forgives parents!
I'm at peace with myself and the world!

347
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:22,282
Don't need hands as long
as you got heart.

348
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:25,485
My heart is filled with love.
I feel five feet tall.

349
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:29,360
- He's like a frog that became a prince.
- No, he's more like a penguin.

350
00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:37,013
Now, now, pretty little thing.

351
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:38,892
Nice and easy.

352
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:47,572
I love a big, strong man who's not afraid
to show it with someone half his size.

353
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,175
Be gentle, it's my first time.

354
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:00,500
Tic-tac-toe.

355
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:07,894
You make it so easy, don't you?

356
00:42:08,383 --> 00:42:11,020
Always waiting for some Batman
to save you.

357
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,374
I am Catwoman.

358
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:18,060
Hear me roar.

359
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:35,744
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant
is using her vacation time.

360
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:40,463
Good time. Everyone but the bandits'll
be slacking off till after the New Year.

361
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:43,100
I'm not sure I like the inference.

362
00:42:43,196 --> 00:42:45,018
I didn't realize I made one.

363
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:53,506
I'm pushing this power plant now
because it'll cost more later.

364
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,220
A million saved is a million earned.

365
00:42:56,997 --> 00:42:59,663
I commissioned this report.
Take a look at it.

366
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:05,503
Gotham City has a power surplus.
I'm sure you know that.

367
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,585
My question is...

368
00:43:08,476 --> 00:43:09,589
What's your angle?

369
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:12,188
Power surplus? Bruce, shame on you!

370
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:16,187
No such thing. One can never have
too much power.

371
00:43:16,475 --> 00:43:19,429
If my life has a meaning,
that's the meaning.

372
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:25,145
I'll fight you. I've already spoken
to the mayor and we agree.

373
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:26,746
Mayors come and go.

374
00:43:26,957 --> 00:43:28,751
Blue bloods tire easily.

375
00:43:29,038 --> 00:43:31,417
Can you go 15 rounds
with Muhammad Shreck?

376
00:43:31,637 --> 00:43:33,546
I guess we'll find out.

377
00:43:33,843 --> 00:43:36,749
Of course, I don't have a crime boss
like Cobblepot in my corner.

378
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:39,108
Crime boss? Shows what you know...

379
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,947
Mr. To-The-Manor-Born-With-A-Silver-Spoon.

380
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:44,229
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.

381
00:43:44,479 --> 00:43:47,989
If his parents hadn't 86'ed him,
you'd have been bunkies at prep school.

382
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:51,950
He controls the Red Triangle Gang.
I can't prove it yet, but we both...

383
00:43:52,122 --> 00:43:54,683
I'll not stand for mud-slinging here.

384
00:43:54,846 --> 00:43:58,078
If my assistant was here,
she'd have already escorted you out...

385
00:43:58,164 --> 00:43:59,632
Anywhere he wants.

386
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:02,346
Preferably some nightspot grotto...

387
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,600
or...

388
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,796
secluded hideaway.

389
00:44:08,723 --> 00:44:10,037
Nice suit.

390
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:20,117
That's my name, don't wear it out
or I'll make you buy me a new one.

391
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,842
This is Bruce...

392
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:27,242
Wayne.

393
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,065
We've met.

394
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:30,522
Have we?

395
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:33,716
No, I'm sorry. I mistook me
for somebody else.

396
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:36,804
You mean, mistook me.

397
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,441
Isn't that what I said?

398
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,638
No, I don't think so.

399
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,160
What happened?

400
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:48,198
Did you injure yourself on that ski slope?

401
00:44:49,694 --> 00:44:52,887
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?

402
00:44:56,052 --> 00:44:57,443
It's a blur.

403
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:03,245
Not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...

404
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:06,515
and Betsy saying
it was morning sickness.

405
00:45:06,611 --> 00:45:09,642
And I remember the time I forgot
to wear my underpants to school...

406
00:45:09,738 --> 00:45:13,411
and the name of the boy who
noticed was Ricky Friedburg.

407
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,847
He's dead now.

408
00:45:16,221 --> 00:45:17,650
But last night...

409
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:19,491
complete blur.

410
00:45:21,217 --> 00:45:23,049
Couldn't you just die?

411
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:28,285
Please...

412
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:30,971
show out Mr. Wayne.

413
00:45:31,297 --> 00:45:32,611
With pleasure.

414
00:45:35,018 --> 00:45:36,811
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.

415
00:45:50,142 --> 00:45:53,249
You don't seem like the type
who does business with Mr. Shreck.

416
00:45:53,345 --> 00:45:55,973
No. You don't seem like the type
to take orders from him.

417
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:57,411
Well, that's a...

418
00:45:57,661 --> 00:45:59,138
long story.

419
00:45:59,905 --> 00:46:01,938
I could free up some time.

420
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:05,573
- I'm listed.
- I'm tempted.

421
00:46:05,822 --> 00:46:06,964
I'm working.

422
00:46:08,229 --> 00:46:09,419
I'm leaving.

423
00:46:09,908 --> 00:46:11,816
You buy that blurry business?

424
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:13,015
Women.

425
00:46:13,427 --> 00:46:15,211
Nothing surprises me...

426
00:46:15,748 --> 00:46:17,494
except your late mother.

427
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:20,774
Who'd have thought Selina
had a brain to damage?

428
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:22,337
Bottom line?

429
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:26,538
She tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out of a higher window.

430
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:27,823
Meantime...

431
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:30,182
I've got badder fish to fry.

432
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:42,544
Oswald...

433
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,385
It's Max.

434
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,541
You're home?

435
00:47:05,676 --> 00:47:06,942
How've you been?

436
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:10,347
Your extended family?

437
00:47:10,797 --> 00:47:12,341
Good to have a family.

438
00:47:14,077 --> 00:47:16,149
I'd rather not be disturbed now.

439
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:19,266
Come on downstairs, Oswald.
I have a surprise.

440
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:21,347
I don't like surprises.

441
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:38,629
Come on.

442
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,314
Don't peek.

443
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:55,748
You'll spoil it.

444
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:22,200
Adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know.

445
00:48:22,323 --> 00:48:25,871
But someone's got to supplant our
standing in the way of progress Mayor.

446
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:29,362
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot,
you've got the magic.

447
00:48:29,525 --> 00:48:32,882
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.

448
00:48:34,972 --> 00:48:36,104
Mayor?

449
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:38,348
Mayor.

450
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:43,364
Elections happen in November.
It's late December.

451
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:44,802
Don't worry.

452
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:48,399
I want you to meet Jen and Josh,
my image consultants.

453
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:51,036
Here.

454
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:53,117
Reclaim your birthright.

455
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:56,867
I'm Jen.

456
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:04,607
Okay, let's see. What I'd like to do first
is put these gloves on you.

457
00:49:04,933 --> 00:49:07,800
Our research tells us
that voters like fingers.

458
00:49:07,973 --> 00:49:10,438
So if we were to just lose this...

459
00:49:11,972 --> 00:49:13,842
We'll do it another time.

460
00:49:15,492 --> 00:49:18,762
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
down in the sewer, huh?

461
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:31,565
Still, it could be worse.

462
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:34,567
My nose could be gushing blood.

463
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,168
What do you mean by that?

464
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:46,891
Everybody, back to work!

465
00:49:47,658 --> 00:49:51,091
Let's make a mayor!

466
00:49:56,462 --> 00:49:59,330
You're right, we missed
the regular election...

467
00:49:59,502 --> 00:50:02,130
but elected officials can be recalled,
impeached...

468
00:50:02,226 --> 00:50:04,787
Given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.

469
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,417
Then think of you...

470
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:09,169
Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.

471
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:11,615
I'd like to fill her void.

472
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:18,136
We'll need signatures to overturn
the ballot. I can supply those.

473
00:50:18,702 --> 00:50:22,452
- Teach her my French flipper trick.
- We need one more thing.

474
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:26,096
A platform?

475
00:50:27,506 --> 00:50:31,736
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world a giant icebox.

476
00:50:32,148 --> 00:50:36,262
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled,
we must have a catalyst.

477
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:39,015
You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot.

478
00:50:39,628 --> 00:50:42,295
Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot.

479
00:50:42,985 --> 00:50:45,622
I need you, Oswald. I need you now!

480
00:50:47,473 --> 00:50:50,341
That's the biggest
parasol I've ever seen.

481
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:55,865
Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin,
or the Reichstag fire...

482
00:51:03,029 --> 00:51:05,417
You want my old friends up there...

483
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:08,150
to drive the mayor
into a foaming frenzy?

484
00:51:08,313 --> 00:51:10,107
- Exactly.
- Sounds fun.

485
00:51:10,874 --> 00:51:11,900
But...

486
00:51:12,715 --> 00:51:15,228
I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.

487
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:17,741
I have my own things to tend to.

488
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,423
Sidetracked, Oswald? This is
your chance to fulfill your destiny...

489
00:51:21,596 --> 00:51:24,051
that your parents carelessly discarded.

490
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,825
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?

491
00:51:29,997 --> 00:51:32,865
Imagine, as mayor,
you have the ear of the media...

492
00:51:33,114 --> 00:51:35,867
access to the captains of industry...

493
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:38,226
unlimited poontang.

494
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:43,980
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.

495
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:47,030
All right, I'll be mayor.

496
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:52,506
Burn, baby, burn!

497
00:54:28,149 --> 00:54:30,134
- Who is she?
- What is she?

498
00:54:30,546 --> 00:54:33,376
I don't know whether to open fire
or fall in love.

499
00:54:34,066 --> 00:54:35,495
You poor guys.

500
00:54:35,668 --> 00:54:38,813
Always confusing your pistols
with your privates.

501
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:43,695
Don't hurt us. Our take-home's
less than $300.

502
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:45,738
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

503
00:55:03,355 --> 00:55:05,101
Go ahead and hit me.

504
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:43,549
Admiring your handiwork?

505
00:55:45,716 --> 00:55:47,624
Touring the riot scene.

506
00:55:49,082 --> 00:55:51,509
Gravely assessing the devastation.

507
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,508
Upstanding-Mayor stuff.

508
00:55:59,555 --> 00:56:01,070
You're not the mayor.

509
00:56:02,883 --> 00:56:04,350
Things change.

510
00:56:06,278 --> 00:56:07,630
What do you want?

511
00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:10,229
The direct approach.

512
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:13,020
I admire that in a man with a mask.

513
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:20,472
You don't really think you'll win, do you?

514
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:24,672
Things change.

515
00:56:48,811 --> 00:56:50,998
I saw her first. Got to fly.

516
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:40,647
How could you? I'm a woman!

517
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:42,566
I'm sorry.

518
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:59,771
As I was saying, I'm a woman
and can't be taken for granted.

519
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:03,530
Life's a bitch, now so am I.

520
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:20,975
Who are you?

521
00:58:21,618 --> 00:58:23,497
Who's the man behind the bat?

522
00:58:25,463 --> 00:58:27,449
Maybe you can help me find...

523
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:29,290
the woman...

524
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:31,457
behind the cat.

525
00:58:32,104 --> 00:58:35,811
No, that's not you.

526
00:58:39,302 --> 00:58:40,578
There you are.

527
00:58:55,951 --> 00:58:57,774
Saved by Kitty Litter.

528
00:59:01,629 --> 00:59:02,847
Bastard!

529
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:20,503
Alfred...

530
00:59:21,232 --> 00:59:23,696
Bring me some antiseptic ointment.

531
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:25,941
Coming. Are you in pain, sir?

532
00:59:28,674 --> 00:59:29,940
Not really.

533
00:59:51,394 --> 00:59:53,906
I may have saved the mayor's baby...

534
00:59:55,479 --> 00:59:57,857
but I refuse to save a mayor...

535
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,667
who stood by, helpless as a baby...

536
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,909
while Gotham was ravaged
by a disease...

537
01:00:04,954 --> 01:00:08,110
that turned Eagle Scouts
into crazed clowns...

538
01:00:09,558 --> 01:00:12,186
and happy homemakers into catwomen.

539
01:00:13,317 --> 01:00:14,382
Thank you.

540
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:21,594
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast,
made his bid to run Gotham.

541
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,796
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest
role model a young person could have.

542
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,779
And you're the hottest young person...

543
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,032
a role model could have.

544
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,427
Here.

545
01:00:38,406 --> 01:00:39,873
Wear a button.

546
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:43,354
Let me just get it on here.

547
01:00:47,804 --> 01:00:49,080
Thank you.

548
01:00:53,731 --> 01:00:58,037
This mayor stuff is not about power,
it's about reaching out to people...

549
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,195
touching people, groping people.

550
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:02,123
- Penguin...
- My name is not Penguin!

551
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:04,041
It's Oswald Cobblepot.

552
01:01:04,645 --> 01:01:07,398
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.

553
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:17,928
Just the pussy I've been looking for.

554
01:01:22,531 --> 01:01:24,286
It's chilly in here.

555
01:01:25,408 --> 01:01:26,684
I'll warm you.

556
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:28,487
Down, Oswald.

557
01:01:30,731 --> 01:01:32,122
We need to talk.

558
01:01:32,294 --> 01:01:33,599
You see...

559
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:36,399
you and I have something in common.

560
01:01:36,658 --> 01:01:38,240
Sounds familiar.

561
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:40,724
Appetite for destruction?

562
01:01:40,935 --> 01:01:43,160
Contempt for the czars of fashion?

563
01:01:43,496 --> 01:01:45,241
Wait, don't tell me.

564
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,284
Naked sexual charisma?

565
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:49,969
Batman.

566
01:01:51,053 --> 01:01:53,211
The thorn in both our sides.

567
01:01:53,892 --> 01:01:55,848
The fly in our ointment.

568
01:01:56,452 --> 01:01:57,728
Ointment?

569
01:01:58,217 --> 01:02:00,490
I've got scented and unscented.

570
01:02:00,979 --> 01:02:02,686
I'll come back later.

571
01:02:03,175 --> 01:02:06,877
Perchance, are you a registered voter?
I'm a mayoral prospect.

572
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:09,332
I have but one pet cause today.

573
01:02:10,263 --> 01:02:11,653
Ban the Bat.

574
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:16,046
Oh, him again. No bother.
He's already history. Check it out.

575
01:02:16,736 --> 01:02:20,975
We'll disassemble his Batmobile
and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.

576
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:26,720
He'd have even more power as a martyr.

577
01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:31,256
To destroy Batman, we must first
turn him into what he hates the most.

578
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,212
Namely, us.

579
01:02:35,063 --> 01:02:36,329
Frame him?

580
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:39,533
Not even in office yet
and already an enemies list.

581
01:02:41,307 --> 01:02:43,810
Those names are not for prying eyes.

582
01:02:45,622 --> 01:02:48,298
Why should I trust some catbroad anyway?

583
01:02:49,468 --> 01:02:53,458
Maybe you're a screwed-up sorority chick
getting back at her daddy...

584
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:57,016
for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweet-sixteen.

585
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:14,940
Nice birdie.

586
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,062
Nice kitty.

587
01:03:31,551 --> 01:03:32,903
Nice kitty.

588
01:03:39,473 --> 01:03:41,381
Batman napalmed my arm.

589
01:03:41,957 --> 01:03:45,946
He knocked me off a building just
when I started to feel good about myself.

590
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:49,063
I want to play an integral part
in his degradation.

591
01:03:53,072 --> 01:03:54,750
A plan is forming.

592
01:04:02,442 --> 01:04:03,746
I want in.

593
01:04:05,961 --> 01:04:09,069
The thought of busting Batman
makes me feel all...

594
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:12,109
dirty.

595
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:18,985
Maybe I'll just give myself a bath
right here.

596
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,232
I challenge the mayor...

597
01:04:31,405 --> 01:04:35,068
to re-light the Christmas tree
in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.

598
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,717
Sir, shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and class?

599
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:43,469
The Love Connection perhaps?

600
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,910
Not that I have any faith in the mayor.

601
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:49,799
But I hope and pray...

602
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,516
that Batman...

603
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:54,393
will be present to preserve the peace.

604
01:04:55,688 --> 01:04:56,800
Subtle.

605
01:05:00,205 --> 01:05:02,075
Why are you doing this?

606
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:05,316
Selina?

607
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:09,642
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

608
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:12,365
Scare me? I was just scaring myself.

609
01:05:13,171 --> 01:05:15,079
I don't see how, but...

610
01:05:15,367 --> 01:05:18,522
it's nice to see you in the real world,
away from Shreck.

611
01:05:20,009 --> 01:05:21,639
It's nice to be here.

612
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:26,243
Are you all right?

613
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:31,163
You look like you have the holiday blues
or something.

614
01:05:33,934 --> 01:05:35,919
Boy, the news these days.

615
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,799
Weird!

616
01:05:39,497 --> 01:05:42,479
I heard on TV that Catwoman
weighs 140 pounds.

617
01:05:44,532 --> 01:05:46,603
How do these hacks sleep at night?

618
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,442
It's not even accurate.
Batman blows it?

619
01:05:49,778 --> 01:05:52,683
He probably saved millions
in property damage alone.

620
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:57,450
You're not going to the re-lighting
of the tree, are you?

621
01:05:57,651 --> 01:05:59,886
I wouldn't be caught dead there.

622
01:06:01,017 --> 01:06:04,163
It's going to be a hot time
in the cold town tonight.

623
01:06:06,139 --> 01:06:08,805
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?

624
01:06:09,457 --> 01:06:10,924
No darker than yours.

625
01:06:14,943 --> 01:06:18,088
Why don't you come over
and we can watch together on TV?

626
01:06:18,462 --> 01:06:20,524
The tree-lighting ceremony.

627
01:06:20,822 --> 01:06:23,574
I can't. I have to be somewhere tonight.

628
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,729
How about coming for dinner at five?

629
01:06:26,902 --> 01:06:28,168
Let's say six?

630
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,048
Five.

631
01:06:30,144 --> 01:06:31,534
Five. You and me.

632
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,892
The tree lights up
and then I push the button.

633
01:06:42,218 --> 01:06:43,330
Wait, wait.

634
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:46,332
I push the button, then the tree lights up.

635
01:06:48,548 --> 01:06:49,938
Who are you?

636
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:51,895
Talent scout.

637
01:06:52,547 --> 01:06:53,765
Come in.

638
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:57,256
I don't just light trees.
I'm an actress as well.

639
01:06:59,586 --> 01:07:02,377
What is that thing?
A camera or something?

640
01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:04,295
Say, cheese!

641
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:06,932
Cheese.

642
01:07:18,144 --> 01:07:19,342
Thanks, Alfred.

643
01:07:21,193 --> 01:07:23,342
I'm sure he's wonderful company...

644
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:27,101
but doesn't the "gold-plated-bachelor"
bit get a little stale?

645
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:31,503
A lot like the "lonely-secretary" syndrome,
I guess.

646
01:07:32,069 --> 01:07:33,824
Executive Assistant.

647
01:07:34,073 --> 01:07:35,023
Sorry.

648
01:07:38,235 --> 01:07:39,501
Secretary.

649
01:07:43,836 --> 01:07:45,342
Any girlfriend?

650
01:07:48,075 --> 01:07:49,188
Sure.

651
01:07:50,396 --> 01:07:52,343
You mean, as in serious?

652
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:55,383
No. Had one, didn't work.

653
01:07:55,757 --> 01:07:57,781
What went wrong? Hang on!

654
01:07:57,992 --> 01:07:59,344
I think I know!

655
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:01,425
You kept things from her.

656
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:03,065
I told her everything.

657
01:08:04,235 --> 01:08:05,827
The truth frightened her?

658
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:07,822
There are two truths...

659
01:08:09,596 --> 01:08:10,862
you know?

660
01:08:11,198 --> 01:08:14,468
She had trouble reconciling them
because I had trouble...

661
01:08:15,753 --> 01:08:17,268
reconciling them.

662
01:08:21,114 --> 01:08:22,313
Vicki thought...

663
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,349
Vicki?

664
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,226
Ice skater or stewardess?

665
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:30,551
No, she was a photojournalist.

666
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,668
Was Vicki right about your...

667
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:35,586
difficulty with duality?

668
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:40,631
You see...

669
01:08:41,523 --> 01:08:43,469
if I say yes, then...

670
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:47,191
you'll think of me as a...

671
01:08:47,363 --> 01:08:50,029
Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and...

672
01:08:58,085 --> 01:08:59,994
You might not let me kiss you.

673
01:09:02,727 --> 01:09:05,911
It's the so-called normal guys
who always let you down.

674
01:09:06,084 --> 01:09:09,114
Sickos never scare me.
At least they're committed.

675
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:48,886
I can't do that.

676
01:09:49,049 --> 01:09:50,238
Neither can I.

677
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:53,844
This is a special bulletin.
The Ice Princess has been kidnapped.

678
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:58,927
Can you confirm reports of Batman's
suspected involvement in the abduction?

679
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:02,562
The evidence is purely circumstantial.

680
01:10:02,936 --> 01:10:07,328
This was found, stained with blood,
in the missing girl's dressing room.

681
01:10:08,853 --> 01:10:11,155
- I must go.
- No, it's your house.

682
01:10:11,577 --> 01:10:14,962
Hold on. Just sit for a second and relax.
I'll be right back.

683
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,410
I've got to go to the plaza.

684
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:30,729
- He is begging me to show.
- I hoped you'd snub him.

685
01:10:30,901 --> 01:10:34,325
I can't. There's been a kidnapping.
Here's what I want you to do.

686
01:10:34,421 --> 01:10:35,370
Shit!

687
01:10:39,063 --> 01:10:43,103
Tell Selina, Ms. Kyle,
I had to go out of town.

688
01:10:43,263 --> 01:10:46,687
Tell her that a big business
deal came up... You know what?

689
01:10:47,224 --> 01:10:50,648
Let her know, not in some kind of dumb,
be-my-girlfriend kind of way...

690
01:10:50,744 --> 01:10:52,489
I'll relay the message.

691
01:10:57,304 --> 01:10:59,816
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that...

692
01:11:00,181 --> 01:11:01,533
Bruce, yes...

693
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,573
Would you tell him...

694
01:11:04,822 --> 01:11:08,016
I've been going through
a lot of changes and...

695
01:11:09,944 --> 01:11:11,334
Just that...

696
01:11:11,545 --> 01:11:13,454
this is not a rejection...

697
01:11:13,943 --> 01:11:15,573
my abruptly leaving.

698
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:18,009
In fact, he makes me feel the way...

699
01:11:18,585 --> 01:11:20,340
I hope I really am.

700
01:11:21,989 --> 01:11:25,461
Could you just make up a sonnet
or something, a dirty limerick?

701
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:28,175
One has just sprung to mind.

702
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:30,937
This way, ma'am.

703
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,184
Ladies and Gentlemen.

704
01:12:31,443 --> 01:12:33,869
Please, may I have your attention?

705
01:12:36,162 --> 01:12:38,348
I know that to many of you...

706
01:12:38,636 --> 01:12:41,590
Gotham seems a bit
beleaguered these days.

707
01:12:42,242 --> 01:12:44,697
But I want you to know
your elected officials...

708
01:12:44,802 --> 01:12:46,788
and your police department...

709
01:12:46,884 --> 01:12:49,339
have the situation well in hand.

710
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:48,097
Got to hurry.

711
01:13:48,192 --> 01:13:49,005
Thank you.

712
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:51,197
It was set up to look like I did it.

713
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:54,205
I'll tell the police I was kidnapped
by an ugly birdman with fish breath.

714
01:13:54,251 --> 01:13:55,443
Did somebody say fish?

715
01:13:55,692 --> 01:13:58,764
I haven't been fed all day.

716
01:13:58,969 --> 01:14:00,283
Eat floor.

717
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:02,882
High fiber.

718
01:14:04,014 --> 01:14:05,280
Hey, stud...

719
01:14:05,452 --> 01:14:08,560
- I thought we had something together.
- We do.

720
01:14:23,895 --> 01:14:25,727
Got to go. Girl talk.

721
01:14:52,983 --> 01:14:56,493
She let me go. I think 'cause I reasoned
with her, girl-to-girl.

722
01:14:58,219 --> 01:15:00,175
Be careful. Don't move.

723
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:03,733
Lawn dart!

724
01:15:07,665 --> 01:15:09,775
Rats with wings, do your thing.

725
01:15:16,028 --> 01:15:17,774
Batman pushed the Princess!

726
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:34,010
Hold your fire!

727
01:15:48,434 --> 01:15:50,726
You're catnip to a girl like me.

728
01:15:51,954 --> 01:15:53,623
Handsome, dazed...

729
01:15:54,994 --> 01:15:56,663
and to die for.

730
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,656
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

731
01:16:07,395 --> 01:16:08,823
But a kiss...

732
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,614
can be even deadlier if you mean it.

733
01:16:20,677 --> 01:16:23,468
You're the second man
who's killed me this week.

734
01:16:23,631 --> 01:16:25,549
But I've got seven lives left.

735
01:16:25,712 --> 01:16:27,103
I tried to save you...

736
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:30,229
Seems like every woman
you try to save ends up dead.

737
01:16:30,594 --> 01:16:32,349
Or deeply resentful.

738
01:16:33,317 --> 01:16:35,149
Maybe you should retire.

739
01:16:57,198 --> 01:16:58,310
Damn.

740
01:17:32,049 --> 01:17:33,440
Outstanding!

741
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:36,355
You're Beauty and the Beast...

742
01:17:36,844 --> 01:17:39,520
in one luscious Christmas gift pack.

743
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:42,992
You said you'd scare the Ice Princess.

744
01:17:43,088 --> 01:17:45,159
She looked pretty scared to me.

745
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,158
A touch of the bubbly?

746
01:17:52,927 --> 01:17:54,922
So what are we waiting for?

747
01:17:55,133 --> 01:17:57,636
Let's consummate our fiendish union.

748
01:17:58,451 --> 01:17:59,894
What are you talking about?

749
01:18:00,053 --> 01:18:01,444
Oh, come on.

750
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:03,486
Can't you picture?

751
01:18:03,649 --> 01:18:05,721
It's dark in the mayor's mansion.

752
01:18:06,095 --> 01:18:09,202
I'm bushed, so here you come
into the bedroom...

753
01:18:10,372 --> 01:18:12,367
twitching your little tail...

754
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:15,724
my slippers in one hand,
a dry martini in the other.

755
01:18:15,973 --> 01:18:16,999
Please.

756
01:18:17,498 --> 01:18:19,522
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.

757
01:18:19,617 --> 01:18:23,761
You lousy minx! I should have you spayed!
You sent out all the signals!

758
01:18:24,374 --> 01:18:26,753
I don't think I like you anymore!

759
01:18:34,454 --> 01:18:36,410
Good-bye, my unintended.

760
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:38,117
Go to heaven.

761
01:19:35,382 --> 01:19:36,523
There he is!

762
01:19:39,064 --> 01:19:40,733
Don't adjust your sets.

763
01:19:40,944 --> 01:19:42,172
Welcome...

764
01:19:42,431 --> 01:19:45,375
to the Oswald Cobblepot
School of Driving.

765
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:49,010
Gentlemen, start your screaming.

766
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:25,703
This may be a bad time to mention it,
but my license has expired!

767
01:20:42,198 --> 01:20:43,148
Just relax.

768
01:20:43,397 --> 01:20:47,626
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham!

769
01:21:32,682 --> 01:21:36,595
You must admit I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!

770
01:21:56,006 --> 01:21:58,279
Helpless old lady at 12:00 high!

771
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:35,403
That's funny.

772
01:22:43,814 --> 01:22:45,483
Now I'm a little worried.

773
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:13,094
So he survived. Why worry?

774
01:23:13,257 --> 01:23:16,853
He didn't even lose a limb!
An eyeball! Bladder control!

775
01:23:17,707 --> 01:23:20,977
Listen to them. They've lost faith
in old symbols.

776
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:24,449
They're ready to bond with you,
the icon of the future.

777
01:23:24,545 --> 01:23:26,376
If it works, don't fix it.

778
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:28,975
We'll celebrate tonight at my annual ball.

779
01:23:29,062 --> 01:23:30,970
Shreck and Cobblepot...

780
01:23:31,584 --> 01:23:33,617
The visionary alliance.

781
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:54,294
When it came time...

782
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:57,459
to ensure the safety of our fair city...

783
01:23:58,945 --> 01:24:01,142
did the mayor have a plan?

784
01:24:01,986 --> 01:24:03,021
No!

785
01:24:04,469 --> 01:24:06,177
He relied on a man.

786
01:24:08,066 --> 01:24:09,341
A Batman.

787
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:13,999
A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak...

788
01:24:14,472 --> 01:24:17,340
Our prime concern is
this ghastly grotesque.

789
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:21,022
But let's not forget about
repairing the Batmobile.

790
01:24:21,272 --> 01:24:23,142
There's security to consider.

791
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:26,259
We can't just take it to any old body shop.

792
01:24:27,352 --> 01:24:28,388
Security?

793
01:24:28,637 --> 01:24:30,786
Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave?

794
01:24:30,872 --> 01:24:35,024
I'm working, I turn around and there
she is. Hi, Vick. Come on in.

795
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:46,264
- Ready?
- I'll take the stairs.

796
01:25:07,076 --> 01:25:09,999
You ask me, am I up here for personal glory?

797
01:25:12,322 --> 01:25:13,348
No.

798
01:25:25,767 --> 01:25:28,395
The glory that I yearn to recapture...

799
01:25:29,603 --> 01:25:31,637
is the glory of Gotham!

800
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:51,239
How can this be accomplished?

801
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:54,836
I know...

802
01:25:55,047 --> 01:25:56,994
you're all concerned.

803
01:25:59,372 --> 01:26:00,504
Just relax.

804
01:26:01,127 --> 01:26:05,357
I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham.

805
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:14,036
I didn't say that.

806
01:26:16,328 --> 01:26:19,282
You must admit I played
this stinking city...

807
01:26:20,327 --> 01:26:22,322
like a harp from hell!

808
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,362
You must admit...

809
01:26:25,535 --> 01:26:28,882
I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!

810
01:27:20,104 --> 01:27:23,854
Why is there always someone who brings
eggs and tomatoes to a speech?

811
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:48,252
There he is!

812
01:28:18,548 --> 01:28:19,862
My babies.

813
01:28:21,109 --> 01:28:22,701
Did you miss me?

814
01:28:36,156 --> 01:28:37,739
Did you miss me?

815
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:41,143
Great speech, Oswald.

816
01:28:42,352 --> 01:28:44,183
My name is not Oswald!

817
01:28:44,797 --> 01:28:46,226
It's Penguin!

818
01:28:46,514 --> 01:28:48,422
I am not a human being!

819
01:28:48,796 --> 01:28:51,021
I am an animal. Cold-blooded!

820
01:28:52,431 --> 01:28:53,946
Crank the A.C.!

821
01:28:54,157 --> 01:28:56,823
Where are my lists?
Bring me the names!

822
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,144
It's time.

823
01:28:59,518 --> 01:29:03,134
These are the names of the first-born sons
of Gotham City.

824
01:29:03,757 --> 01:29:05,349
Just like I was.

825
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:08,629
And like me, a terrible
fate waits for them.

826
01:29:10,394 --> 01:29:12,993
Tonight, while their parents party...

827
01:29:13,597 --> 01:29:15,832
they'll be dreaming away...

828
01:29:16,244 --> 01:29:18,229
in their safe cribs...

829
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:20,272
their soft beds...

830
01:29:20,636 --> 01:29:22,708
and we'll snatch them...

831
01:29:22,881 --> 01:29:24,789
carry them into the sewer...

832
01:29:24,962 --> 01:29:28,107
and toss them into a deep,
dark, watery grave.

833
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,196
Penguin?

834
01:29:31,924 --> 01:29:34,073
Killing sleeping children...

835
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:36,077
isn't that a little...

836
01:29:45,926 --> 01:29:47,432
No, it's a lot.

837
01:29:57,003 --> 01:29:58,279
A reminder.

838
01:29:58,442 --> 01:30:02,278
Tonight is that loathsome party hosted
by the odious Mr. Shreck.

839
01:30:02,604 --> 01:30:05,318
May we RSVP
in the resoundingly negative?

840
01:30:06,009 --> 01:30:07,227
Not interested.

841
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:10,516
Although...

842
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:14,755
Selina Kyle might be there.

843
01:30:37,091 --> 01:30:38,760
Ingenious costume.

844
01:30:39,172 --> 01:30:40,601
Let me guess.

845
01:30:40,774 --> 01:30:42,682
Trust-fund goody-goody?

846
01:30:43,977 --> 01:30:45,320
Feeling good?

847
01:30:46,298 --> 01:30:49,568
You almost made a monster
the mayor of Gotham City.

848
01:30:49,971 --> 01:30:52,206
I am the light of this city...

849
01:30:52,532 --> 01:30:54,920
and I am its mean, twisted soul.

850
01:30:55,332 --> 01:30:57,001
Does it matter who's mayor?

851
01:30:57,097 --> 01:30:58,238
It does to me.

852
01:30:58,612 --> 01:30:59,725
Yawn.

853
01:31:36,465 --> 01:31:38,767
I'm sorry about yesterday, but I had...

854
01:31:38,901 --> 01:31:42,210
a pretty big deal come through,
fall through, actually.

855
01:31:42,383 --> 01:31:45,135
It's okay. I had to go home
and feed my cat.

856
01:31:53,747 --> 01:31:55,339
No hard feelings then?

857
01:31:57,747 --> 01:31:59,099
Actually...

858
01:32:01,142 --> 01:32:02,973
semi-hard, I'd say.

859
01:32:08,948 --> 01:32:12,295
There's a big, comfy California King
over in Bedding.

860
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:15,374
What do you say?

861
01:32:16,467 --> 01:32:18,260
Take off our costumes?

862
01:32:21,627 --> 01:32:23,698
I'm tired of wearing masks.

863
01:32:24,513 --> 01:32:25,703
Me too.

864
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:28,743
Let me ask you something.

865
01:32:29,951 --> 01:32:31,582
Why'd you come tonight?

866
01:32:32,195 --> 01:32:34,104
- You first.
- To see you.

867
01:32:36,473 --> 01:32:37,422
Lovely.

868
01:32:39,033 --> 01:32:42,141
I wish I could say the same,
but I came for Max.

869
01:32:44,989 --> 01:32:46,543
Do you mean you...

870
01:32:46,869 --> 01:32:48,183
Not you and Max?

871
01:32:49,592 --> 01:32:50,945
Me and Max?

872
01:32:57,274 --> 01:32:58,943
No. This and Max.

873
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:06,030
Don't tell me killing Max
won't solve anything, because it will.

874
01:33:07,076 --> 01:33:10,269
Aren't you tired of this
sanctimonious robber baron...

875
01:33:10,432 --> 01:33:13,223
coming out on top when
he should be six feet under?

876
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:17,309
You may have problems with your boss,
but who do you think you are?

877
01:33:20,195 --> 01:33:22,353
I don't know anymore, Bruce.

878
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:38,350
A kiss under the mistletoe.

879
01:33:41,486 --> 01:33:43,548
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

880
01:33:43,644 --> 01:33:45,792
But a kiss can be even deadlier...

881
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:49,676
if you mean it.

882
01:33:59,564 --> 01:34:00,916
Oh, my God.

883
01:34:01,808 --> 01:34:04,234
Does this mean we have to start fighting?

884
01:34:05,241 --> 01:34:06,757
Let's go outside.

885
01:34:41,167 --> 01:34:43,162
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

886
01:34:51,016 --> 01:34:52,839
You didn't invite me...

887
01:34:53,098 --> 01:34:54,680
so I crashed!

888
01:34:58,094 --> 01:34:59,120
What do you want?

889
01:34:59,216 --> 01:35:00,962
Right now, my troops...

890
01:35:01,211 --> 01:35:03,369
are fanning out across town...

891
01:35:03,618 --> 01:35:05,364
for your children!

892
01:35:05,651 --> 01:35:06,601
Yes!

893
01:35:06,774 --> 01:35:08,768
For your first-born sons!

894
01:35:09,497 --> 01:35:12,250
The ones you left defenseless at home...

895
01:35:12,537 --> 01:35:14,762
so you could dress up like jerks...

896
01:35:14,858 --> 01:35:16,891
get juiced and dance...

897
01:35:17,659 --> 01:35:18,925
badly!

898
01:35:23,336 --> 01:35:25,245
I've personally come...

899
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:28,093
for Gotham's favorite son...

900
01:35:28,294 --> 01:35:30,011
Mr. Chip Shreck.

901
01:35:31,181 --> 01:35:33,771
You're coming with me,
you Great White Dope...

902
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:36,926
to die, way down in the sewer!

903
01:35:37,578 --> 01:35:41,203
Not Chip. If you have any human feeling,
take me instead.

904
01:35:43,418 --> 01:35:45,049
I don't. So, no!

905
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:46,718
I'm the one you want.

906
01:35:46,823 --> 01:35:50,170
Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated
and betrayed you?

907
01:35:50,707 --> 01:35:52,692
Isn't it Max, not Chip...

908
01:35:53,268 --> 01:35:56,615
you want to see immersed
to his eyeballs in raw sewage?

909
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,098
Okay, you got a point.

910
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:06,052
I'll let the little prince live, for now.

911
01:36:06,301 --> 01:36:07,442
In the duck!

912
01:36:33,826 --> 01:36:35,897
This is going to be good...

913
01:36:36,626 --> 01:36:40,222
to cut down a whole crop
of Gotham's most promising...

914
01:36:41,268 --> 01:36:42,860
before their prime.

915
01:36:45,114 --> 01:36:47,569
You ask me how do I lure them in?

916
01:36:51,549 --> 01:36:53,822
A little "Pied Penguin" action.

917
01:36:56,315 --> 01:36:58,694
And you get to watch them sink...

918
01:36:59,518 --> 01:37:01,264
into a deep puddle...

919
01:37:01,436 --> 01:37:03,863
of your industrial by-products.

920
01:37:04,678 --> 01:37:05,733
Then...

921
01:37:05,954 --> 01:37:07,507
you join them.

922
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,464
Hurry up and get those kids loaded.

923
01:37:51,681 --> 01:37:53,589
Right this way, kiddies.

924
01:37:54,126 --> 01:37:55,555
Come with me.

925
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:13,595
So where are all the children?

926
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:18,716
Dear Penguin.

927
01:38:18,927 --> 01:38:21,919
The children regret
they're unable to attend.

928
01:38:22,447 --> 01:38:23,713
Batman!

929
01:38:36,688 --> 01:38:38,396
My dear penguins...

930
01:38:39,729 --> 01:38:42,107
We stand on a great threshold!

931
01:38:43,526 --> 01:38:45,444
It's okay to be scared!

932
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:48,475
Many of you won't be coming back.

933
01:38:48,849 --> 01:38:50,566
Thanks to Batman...

934
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,963
the time has come...

935
01:38:53,174 --> 01:38:55,476
to punish all God's children!

936
01:38:56,934 --> 01:38:59,686
First, second, third and fourth-born!

937
01:39:00,453 --> 01:39:01,921
Why be biased?

938
01:39:02,218 --> 01:39:03,800
Male and female!

939
01:39:04,529 --> 01:39:06,687
Hell, the sexes are equal...

940
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:09,727
with their erogenous zones...

941
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:11,569
blown sky-high!

942
01:39:14,379 --> 01:39:17,889
Forward march!

943
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:20,363
The liberation of Gotham...

944
01:39:21,495 --> 01:39:22,924
has begun!

945
01:40:06,224 --> 01:40:08,449
The penguins are moving above ground.

946
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:34,219
Penguin army...

947
01:40:34,392 --> 01:40:37,576
approaching launch destination
at Gotham Plaza.

948
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:40,903
One minute until ignition.

949
01:40:41,431 --> 01:40:43,617
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal...

950
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:46,092
so I'm laying them on a slab!

951
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:49,938
Penguins seem to be converging
on Gotham Plaza.

952
01:41:12,235 --> 01:41:14,268
Thirty seconds until ignition.

953
01:41:16,158 --> 01:41:18,584
Estimated casualties after launch,

954
01:41:19,677 --> 01:41:21,183
100,000 people.

955
01:41:24,473 --> 01:41:27,148
The penguins have reached
Gotham Square.

956
01:41:45,763 --> 01:41:47,672
Fifteen seconds to ignition.

957
01:41:50,156 --> 01:41:51,786
Ready when you are, sir.

958
01:41:54,481 --> 01:41:56,150
I've got the coordinates.

959
01:42:03,678 --> 01:42:05,309
Let's turn them around.

960
01:42:13,528 --> 01:42:14,957
Something is wrong.

961
01:42:16,644 --> 01:42:18,639
Something has jammed the signal.

962
01:42:28,489 --> 01:42:30,762
They seem to be turning around.

963
01:43:00,569 --> 01:43:03,321
There is also something coming this way.

964
01:43:04,251 --> 01:43:06,160
Very large. Very fast.

965
01:43:21,773 --> 01:43:23,048
Who's there?

966
01:43:30,021 --> 01:43:32,246
I'm homing in on the signal's origin.

967
01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:48,135
You're jealous
because I'm a genuine freak...

968
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:50,618
and you have to wear a mask!

969
01:44:50,868 --> 01:44:52,460
You might be right.

970
01:44:54,953 --> 01:44:58,732
But what it all comes down to is,
who's holding the umbrella?

971
01:45:24,156 --> 01:45:25,460
My babies!

972
01:46:58,209 --> 01:47:02,362
I don't know what you want,
but I can get it with a minimum of fuss.

973
01:47:04,453 --> 01:47:05,565
Money.

974
01:47:05,891 --> 01:47:06,841
Jewels.

975
01:47:07,128 --> 01:47:09,037
A very big ball of string.

976
01:47:13,333 --> 01:47:14,925
Your blood, Max.

977
01:47:15,136 --> 01:47:16,642
I gave at the office.

978
01:47:17,054 --> 01:47:19,126
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.

979
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:20,881
Let's make a deal!

980
01:47:21,054 --> 01:47:23,087
Other than my blood, what can I do?

981
01:47:23,173 --> 01:47:25,360
Sorry, Max, a die for a die.

982
01:47:36,139 --> 01:47:38,403
You're not just saving a life...

983
01:47:38,537 --> 01:47:40,484
Shut up. You're going to jail.

984
01:47:41,174 --> 01:47:45,250
Don't be naive. The law doesn't
apply to people like him or us.

985
01:47:45,816 --> 01:47:47,331
Wrong on both counts.

986
01:47:57,018 --> 01:47:58,130
Why do this?

987
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:04,047
Let's just take him to the police.

988
01:48:05,582 --> 01:48:07,212
Then we can go home...

989
01:48:08,382 --> 01:48:09,495
together.

990
01:48:15,307 --> 01:48:16,333
Selina...

991
01:48:19,421 --> 01:48:21,013
Don't you see?

992
01:48:22,106 --> 01:48:23,324
We're the same.

993
01:48:25,664 --> 01:48:27,016
We're the same.

994
01:48:28,666 --> 01:48:29,692
Split...

995
01:48:30,105 --> 01:48:31,534
down the center.

996
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:53,419
Please.

997
01:48:54,627 --> 01:48:55,740
Bruce...

998
01:48:56,545 --> 01:48:59,576
I would love to live with you
in your castle...

999
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:04,620
forever, just like in a fairy tale.

1000
01:49:10,154 --> 01:49:13,770
I just couldn't live with myself.
Don't pretend this is a happy ending.

1001
01:49:16,388 --> 01:49:17,587
Selina Kyle.

1002
01:49:19,035 --> 01:49:20,387
You're fired.

1003
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:22,305
And Bruce Wayne...

1004
01:49:22,794 --> 01:49:24,540
Why are you dressed up like Batman?

1005
01:49:24,636 --> 01:49:26,937
Because he is Batman, you moron!

1006
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:29,306
Was.

1007
01:49:31,790 --> 01:49:32,701
Don't.

1008
01:49:32,874 --> 01:49:36,346
You killed me, the Penguin killed me,
Batman killed me.

1009
01:49:36,873 --> 01:49:39,789
Three lives down.
Got enough to finish me off?

1010
01:49:39,875 --> 01:49:41,342
One way to find out.

1011
01:49:44,795 --> 01:49:45,744
Four.

1012
01:49:45,994 --> 01:49:47,106
Five.

1013
01:49:50,434 --> 01:49:51,575
Still alive!

1014
01:50:00,878 --> 01:50:01,914
Six.

1015
01:50:02,077 --> 01:50:03,112
Seven.

1016
01:50:03,323 --> 01:50:05,472
All good girls go to heaven.

1017
01:50:11,677 --> 01:50:13,192
Two lives left.

1018
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,738
I'll save one for next Christmas.

1019
01:50:20,078 --> 01:50:21,910
But in the meantime...

1020
01:50:23,684 --> 01:50:25,755
how about a kiss, Santie Claus?

1021
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:54,323
Shit!

1022
01:51:54,658 --> 01:51:56,404
I picked a cute one.

1023
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:01,765
The heat's getting to me.

1024
01:52:02,657 --> 01:52:04,805
I'll murder you momentarily.

1025
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:08,411
But first...

1026
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:11,125
I need a cool drink...

1027
01:52:11,816 --> 01:52:13,408
of ice water.

1028
01:53:51,278 --> 01:53:52,544
Stop the car.

1029
01:55:10,245 --> 01:55:11,837
Come what may...

1030
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:14,158
Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne!

1031
01:55:15,127 --> 01:55:16,796
Merry Christmas, Alfred!

1032
01:55:18,493 --> 01:55:20,075
Goodwill toward men...

1033
01:55:22,655 --> 01:55:23,844
and women.
