1
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:44,397
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

2
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:40,717
Merry Christmas.

3
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,596
Penguin sighting!
Check it out! Man or myth?

4
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,808
What is he? Today's edition.
Another Penguin sighting.

5
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,644
Another Penguin sighting! Check it out!

6
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:56,566
Grotesque penguin-man living in Gotham
sewers. Read all about the latest sighting.

7
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,115
<i>Could I have your attention, Gotham City?</i>

8
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:07,410
<i>It is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.</i>

9
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,291
How about that?

10
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:33,144
Part man, part penguin. All horrifying!

11
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:36,314
Find out for only 50 cents. Come on!

12
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:40,651
Read about the possible terror
beneath our feet. Check it out, people!

13
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,071
Read about it! Today's issue.

14
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,281
Read about the latest sighting
of the penguin creature.

15
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,200
Missing link between man and bird.

16
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,659
My dear boy...

17
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,579
sometimes it's a diversion
to read such rubbish.

18
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,040
Most of the time, it's a waste of time.

19
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:58,377
Whatever. Today's issue, the Penguin.
Check him out. Man or myth?

20
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,464
<i>The Globe</i>. Right here. Twenty-five cents.

21
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,281
Well, here's hoping.

22
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:31,369
Maybe with a little luck, Gotham will have
its first merry Christmas in a good long while.

23
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:35,873
I feel almost vulgar in this yuletide context
mentioning the new power plant.

24
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,293
But if we're gonna break ground,
when we gotta break ground...

25
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,173
I'll need permits, variances, tax incentives.
That sort of pesky nonsense.

26
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,385
Power plant?

27
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:49,971
Max, all our studies show us
we've got enough power...

28
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:52,098
to get us into the middle of the next century.

29
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,517
Your analysts are talking growth
at 1 percent per annum.

30
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,811
That's not growth. That's a mild swelling.

31
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:01,023
Imagine a Gotham City...

32
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,903
of the future, lit up like a blanket of stars...

33
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,239
but blinking on and off...

34
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,867
embarrassingly low on juice.

35
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:12,451
Frankly...

36
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,163
I cringe, Mr. Mayor.

37
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,250
Sorry, any plans you've got will have
to go to the usual committees...

38
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,294
through the usual channels.

39
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,337
I have a suggestion.

40
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,263
Well...

41
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,225
actually, really, just more like a question.

42
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,939
I'm afraid
we haven't properly housebroken Miss Kyle.

43
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,609
In the plus column, though...

44
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,360
she makes a hell of a cup of coffee.

45
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:55,786
Dad.

46
00:08:57,163 --> 00:09:00,708
Mr. Mayor. It's time to go down
and bring joy to the masses.

47
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,179
"Actually, more of a question."

48
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,306
You stupid corn dog.

49
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,434
Oh, God. Corn dog.

50
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,490
All right. Give us some room.

51
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,919
Wait, let him through, please.

52
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:49,048
I have enough signatures from Shreck
employees alone to warrant a recall.

53
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,509
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.

54
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,678
Maybe. But you don't have an issue, Max.

55
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,721
And you sure as hell don't have a candidate.

56
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,139
Hello, Mr. Shreck!

57
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,433
<i>Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

58
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,521
<i>From those of us at City Hall
to each and every one of you...</i>

59
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:04,855
<i>happy holidays.</i>

60
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:08,734
<i>We have with us tonight
a man who really needs no introduction.</i>

61
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,486
<i>He's given so much to our city.</i>

62
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,324
<i>Will you welcome, please,
Gotham's own Santa Claus: Max Shreck.</i>

63
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:39,223
Pick up those contracts from Personnel and...

64
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,809
pick up the dry cleaning, paper towels....

65
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:45,771
Oh, darn.

66
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,112
Forgot my speech.

67
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,490
Remind me to take it out on what's-her-name.

68
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,164
<i>Santa Claus? Afraid not.</i>

69
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,501
<i>I'm just a poor schmo who got lucky.</i>

70
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:12,256
<i>And sue me if I want to give some back.</i>

71
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:20,431
<i>I only wish I could hand out more
than just expensive baubles.</i>

72
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,393
<i>I wish I could hand out world peace...</i>

73
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,646
<i>and unconditional love...</i>

74
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,941
<i>wrapped in a big bow.</i>

75
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,989
Oh, but you can. Oh, but you will.

76
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:44,914
Merry Christmas.

77
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:01,639
- Great idea.
- Not mine.

78
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,163
Let's go!

79
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,734
What're you waiting for? The signal!

80
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,395
We want the big guy!
The guy who runs the show!

81
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,484
- What do you want?
- Not you!

82
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,821
- Shreck!
- You'll have to go through me.

83
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:41,906
Ooh.

84
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,408
- Chip.
- Dad, go! Save yourself!

85
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:45,826
Dad, go!

86
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,650
Shut up!

87
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,244
You take one step closer, Mr. Man-bat, and....

88
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,043
Ha-ha-ha. You missed.

89
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:11,764
Wow.

90
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,016
The Batman.

91
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,353
Or is it just Batman?

92
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,483
Uh, your choice, of course.

93
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:28,113
Well, that was very brief.

94
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:30,741
Just like all the men in my life.

95
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,826
I know, what men?

96
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,079
Well....

97
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:39,083
Then again, there's you. But you need therapy.

98
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,858
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
I'm afraid the Circus Gang is back.

99
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,193
We'll see.

100
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,738
They almost made off with our mover
and shaker, Max Shreck, but....

101
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,741
Where is that insufferable son of a bitch?

102
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:24,897
Hi.

103
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,906
I believe the word you're looking for is....

104
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:47,586
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.

105
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,671
You're at home in bed...

106
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,883
heavily sedated, resting comfortably...

107
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:58,055
dying from the carcinogens
you've personally spewed...

108
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,808
in a lifetime of profiteering.

109
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,228
Tragic irony or poetic justice?

110
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,146
You tell me.

111
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:08,857
My God, it's true.

112
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,527
Penguin Man of the sewer.

113
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,450
Odd as it may seem, Max...

114
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,745
you and I have something in common.

115
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,375
We're both perceived as monsters.

116
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,297
But somehow...

117
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,051
you're a well-respected monster...

118
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:40,264
and I am, to date, not!

119
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,768
Frankly, I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman.

120
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,311
Tough, yes.

121
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:50,065
Shrewd, okay.
But that does not make me a monster.

122
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:54,945
Don't embarrass yourself, Max!
I know all about you.

123
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,448
What you hide, I discover.

124
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,742
What you put in your toilet...

125
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,829
I place on my mantle. Get the picture?

126
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,748
What, is that supposed to hypnotize me?

127
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,751
No, just give you a splitting headache.

128
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,795
It's not working.

129
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,592
You big baby! Just blanks.

130
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:20,012
Would I go through all this trouble tonight
just to kill you?

131
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,638
No, Max.

132
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:24,016
I have an entirely other purpose.

133
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,102
I'm ready, Max.

134
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:29,980
I've been down here too long.

135
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:33,108
It's time for me to ascend...

136
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,235
to re-emerge...

137
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,113
with your help...

138
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,990
your know-how...

139
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,700
your savvy.

140
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,037
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.

141
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,956
I come from....

142
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,583
Like you.

143
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,045
And, like you, I want some respect!

144
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,256
A recognition of my basic humanity.

145
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,050
But most of all...

146
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:03,639
I want to find out who I am
by finding my parents...

147
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,141
learning my human name.

148
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:10,854
Simple stuff that the good people
of Gotham take for granted!

149
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,649
And...

150
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:17,152
exactly why am I gonna help you?

151
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,571
Well....

152
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,661
Let's start.

153
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,505
Ooh. What have we here? Let's see.

154
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:43,553
A batch of toxic waste...

155
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,598
from your clean textile plant.

156
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,352
There's a whole lagoon of this crud in the back.

157
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,312
That could have come from anywhere.

158
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:57,609
What about the documents that prove
you own half the firetraps in Gotham City?

159
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,611
If there were such documents...

160
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,613
that's not an admission.

161
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,824
I would have seen to it they were shredded.

162
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,410
Good idea.

163
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:12,541
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference.

164
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,877
By the way...

165
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,672
how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?

166
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,340
Fred?

167
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,010
Fred's actually....

168
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,680
I believe he's on extended vacation. He's good.

169
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,560
Good.

170
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:37,566
Hiya, Max. Remember me? I'm Fred's hand!

171
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,444
You want to greet any other body parts?

172
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,279
Remember, Max...

173
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:45,073
you flush it, I flaunt it.

174
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,078
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?

175
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,792
I think perhaps...

176
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:59,296
I could help orchestrate
a little welcome-home scenario for you.

177
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:03,592
Once we're both back home,
perhaps we can help each other out.

178
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,595
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

179
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:16,396
Honey, I'm home!

180
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,692
I forgot. I'm not married.

181
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,496
Miss Kitty.

182
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,793
Back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share?

183
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,713
Not that I'd ever pry.

184
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,050
Drink your dinner.

185
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:52,933
What?

186
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,728
How can anyone be so pathetic?

187
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,525
Yes, to you I seem pathetic.
But I'm a working girl.

188
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:05,570
Gotta pay the rent. Maybe if you were
chipping in instead of stepping out.

189
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,700
<i>Selina, dear,
it's your mother. Just calling to say hello.</i>

190
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:11,993
Yeah, right, but....

191
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,747
<i>But I'm disappointed
you're not coming home for Christmas.</i>

192
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:19,417
<i>I want to discuss just why you insist
on languishing in Gotham City...</i>

193
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,503
<i>as some lowly secretary.</i>

194
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,088
Lowly assistant.

195
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,135
<i>Selina,
about that Christmas getaway we planned...</i>

196
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:34,432
<i>I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need
to be my own person, not an appendage.</i>

197
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,230
Some appendage!

198
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:49,406
The party never stops
on Selina Kyle's answering machine.

199
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,578
Guess I should've let him win
that last racquetball game.

200
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,414
<i>Hello, Selina Kyle.</i>

201
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:01,293
<i>We're calling to tell you
about exciting new Gotham Lady perfume.</i>

202
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:05,755
<i>It makes women feel like women
and the men have no complaints, either.</i>

203
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,301
<i>Hey, Selina.</i>

204
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,553
<i>This is yourself calling to remind you, honey...</i>

205
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,471
<i>that you have to come
all the way back to the office...</i>

206
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:14,931
You stupid corn dog!

207
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,058
<i>...unless you remembered
to bring home the Bruce Wayne file.</i>

208
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,602
<i>Because the meeting's on Wednesday.</i>

209
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:38,955
Working late?

210
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,248
Um....

211
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:45,795
I'm just boning up
for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.

212
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:50,050
I pulled all of the files
on the proposed power plant...

213
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,638
and Mr. Wayne's hope-for investment.

214
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,641
And I even opened the protected files and--

215
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,184
How industrious.

216
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:02,812
How did you open protected files...

217
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,315
may I ask?

218
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,277
Um, well....

219
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:15,325
I figured your password was "Heraldo,"
your chihuahua, and it was.

220
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:28,463
Um, this is all very interesting,
though a bit on the technical side.

221
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:33,343
I mean, about how the power plant is
a power plant in name only...

222
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,805
since, in fact, it's gonna be a big, giant...

223
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,516
capacitor.

224
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:45,522
And that, instead of generating power,
it'll sort of be sucking power from...

225
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:50,485
um, Gotham City and storing it...

226
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,113
stockpiling it.

227
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:57,284
Which is a very novel approach, I'd say.

228
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,121
And who would you say this to?

229
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:03,957
Um....

230
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,001
Nobody.

231
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,343
What did curiosity do to the cat?

232
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,930
I'm no cat.

233
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,016
I'm just an assistant.

234
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:22,809
A secretary.

235
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,020
And a very good one.

236
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,355
Too good?

237
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,568
Listen, it's our secret. Honest.

238
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:35,030
How can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless?

239
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,531
This power plant...

240
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,909
is my legacy. It's what I leave behind...

241
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,244
for Chip.

242
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,830
Nothing must prevent that.

243
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:46,875
Okay.

244
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:51,588
Go ahead. Intimidate me,
bully me, if it makes you feel big.

245
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,631
I mean, it's not like you can just kill me!

246
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,593
Actually, it's a lot like that.

247
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,520
Huh?

248
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,982
Huh?

249
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,364
You know, for a second there,
you really frightened me.

250
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,084
Really?

251
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,161
Honey, I'm home.

252
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,499
I forgot. I'm not married.

253
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,288
<i>Selina, this is your mother. Call me.</i>

254
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:34,834
<i>Selina, this is your mother.
Why haven't you called me back?</i>

255
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:38,046
<i>Hello, Selina Kyle.</i>

256
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:41,966
<i>We're just calling to make sure
you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.</i>

257
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:46,429
<i>One whiff of this at the office
and your boss will ask you to stay after work...</i>

258
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:49,265
<i>for a candlelight staff meeting for two.</i>

259
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:52,769
<i>Gotham Lady perfume.
Exclusively at Shreck's department store.</i>

260
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:41,562
I don't know about you, Miss Kitty, but I feel...

261
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,940
so much yummier.

262
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,043
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

263
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,630
<i>I stand before you once again...</i>

264
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:11,801
<i>to denounce the urban chaos
we seem to have to live with in our great city.</i>

265
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,386
<i>It's got to stop.</i>

266
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:17,140
<i>And it's going to stop.
Our community is coming apart...</i>

267
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:20,101
<i>in a season when it should be coming together.</i>

268
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:23,646
<i>I don't care what the cynics may say.
This is the Christmas season.</i>

269
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,565
<i>It should be a time of healing.</i>

270
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,276
<i>And I tell you that, not only as an official...</i>

271
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:30,778
<i>but as a husband and a father.</i>

272
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,240
<i>Last night's violence will not happen again.</i>

273
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:40,496
<i>I'm not really one for speeches,
so I'll just say, "Thanks."</i>

274
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,549
No! It's the hideous Penguin Man.

275
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:54,552
Here, take the baby. Just don't hurt me, please.

276
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:51,818
<i>This was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.</i>

277
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,071
<i>The mysterious Penguin saving the life
of the mayor's baby and...</i>

278
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:59,575
<i>- announcing his presence to the world.
- All I want in return...</i>

279
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:04,413
<i>is a chance to find my mom and dad.</i>

280
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:09,210
<i>A chance to find out who they are...</i>

281
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,755
<i>and thusly, who I am.</i>

282
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:16,968
<i>And then, with my parents...</i>

283
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,555
<i>try to understand why.</i>

284
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:25,560
<i>Why they did what I guess
they felt they had to do...</i>

285
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,982
<i>to a child who was born...</i>

286
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,653
<i>a little different.</i>

287
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:41,868
<i>A child who spent his first Christmas...</i>

288
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,954
<i>and many since...</i>

289
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:47,832
<i>in a sewer.</i>

290
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:50,501
Mr. Wayne? Is something wrong?

291
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:51,878
No.

292
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,172
His parents.

293
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,508
<i>Again, this scene, direct from Gotham Plaza...</i>

294
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:58,926
<i>where we have just witnessed....</i>

295
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,887
I hope he finds them.

296
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,725
<i>Here he is, standing alongside
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.</i>

297
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:08,561
<i>How about a statement?
People want to know.</i>

298
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,450
- Penguin's not to be disturbed.
- This is a public place.

299
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:24,368
- Take a walk. Move!
- You're violating the First Amendment.

300
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,495
- Breaching the freedom of the press!
- Wait a minute.

301
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:31,667
What about the freedom
to rediscover your roots...

302
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:33,836
with dignity and privacy?

303
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:36,672
What's the deal, Mr. Shreck?
Is the Penguin a personal friend?

304
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,509
Yes, he's a personal friend of this whole city,
so have a heart.

305
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:43,471
Give the Constitution a rest, okay?
It's Christmas.

306
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,806
"Red Triangle Circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions.

307
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:33,396
"Circus return for two-week....

308
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:34,939
"Kids will love...."

309
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:36,607
Thanks.

310
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:43,364
- It's cold!
- It's vichyssoise, sir.

311
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:46,409
It's supposed to be cold.

312
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:52,331
"Circus is back with a freak show.
May not be suitable for kids.

313
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:54,166
"Featuring a poodle lady...

314
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,210
"the world's fattest man...

315
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:59,213
"and aquatic bird-boy."

316
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,842
Why are you now determined to prove...

317
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,553
that this Penguin is not what he seems?

318
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,473
Must you be
the only lonely man-beast in town?

319
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,809
"The circus folded its tents yesterday...

320
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:15,271
"perhaps forever, after numerous reports
of missing children in several towns.

321
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:18,024
"Police have closed down
the Red Triangle's fairgrounds.

322
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,777
"However, at least
one freak-show performer vanished before...

323
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:24,280
"he could be questioned."

324
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,159
I suppose you feel better now, sir.

325
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:32,329
No.

326
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,416
Actually, I feel worse.

327
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,686
<i>Why are you still out?</i>

328
00:39:55,853 --> 00:40:00,149
<i>Are you concerned about
that strange, heroic Penguin person?</i>

329
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:03,235
I think he knows who his parents are.

330
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:06,906
There's something else.

331
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,270
Penguin!

332
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:03,439
Can we get a statement from you?

333
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:04,815
So, Mr. Penguin--

334
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:07,276
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly.

335
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,654
I am a man.

336
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,240
I have a name.

337
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,705
Oswald Cobblepot!

338
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:24,168
Mr. Cobblepot, you'll never get a chance
to settle up with them?

339
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:28,339
True.

340
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,592
I was their number one son...

341
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,470
and they treated me like number two.

342
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:38,641
But it's human nature to fear...

343
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,976
the unusual.

344
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:45,105
Perhaps when I held...

345
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:47,191
my Tiffany baby rattle...

346
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:50,236
with a shiny flipper...

347
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:54,114
instead of five chubby digits...

348
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,325
they freaked.

349
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,206
But I forgive them.

350
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,630
"You don't need hands
as long as you've got heart."

351
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:12,841
"My heart is filled with love. I feel 5 feet tall."

352
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:16,637
- He's like a frog that became a prince.
- No, he's more like a penguin.

353
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,229
Now, pretty little thing.

354
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:26,897
Nice and easy.

355
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,196
I just love a big, strong man
who's not afraid to show it...

356
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:36,031
with someone half his size.

357
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:40,286
Be gentle, it's my first time.

358
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:49,962
Tic-tac-toe.

359
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:54,675
Thanks. I--

360
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:57,678
You make it so easy, don't you?

361
00:43:57,845 --> 00:44:01,265
Always waiting for some Batman to save you.

362
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,394
I am Catwoman.

363
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:08,063
Hear me roar.

364
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:26,248
I'd offer you coffee,
but my assistant is using her vacation time.

365
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:27,624
Good time, too.

366
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:31,545
Everyone but the bandits will be slacking off
till after New Year, anyway.

367
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:35,632
- I'm not sure I like the inference, Bruce.
- Sorry, Max. Didn't realize I made one.

368
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:44,725
I'm pushing this power plant now
because it'll cost more later.

369
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:47,144
A million saved is a million earned.

370
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:51,190
I commissioned this report.
I thought you might want to take a look at it.

371
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:57,821
The point is, Max, Gotham City has
a power surplus. I'm sure you know that.

372
00:44:57,988 --> 00:44:59,198
My question is...

373
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:01,450
what's your angle?

374
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:04,953
Power surplus? Bruce, shame on you.

375
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,499
No such thing.
One can never have too much power.

376
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:12,002
If my life has a meaning, that's the meaning.

377
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:16,507
Yeah, well, I'm gonna fight you on this.
I've already spoken to the mayor...

378
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:19,468
- and we see eye to eye.
- Mayors come and go.

379
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:21,637
Blue bloods tire easy.

380
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:24,306
You think you could go 15 rounds
with Muhammad Shreck?

381
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:26,642
Well, I guess we're gonna find out.

382
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:29,812
Of course, I don't have a crime boss
like Cobblepot in my corner, so--

383
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,398
Crime boss? Shows what you know...

384
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:35,234
Mr. To-the-manor-born-with-a-silver-spoon.

385
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:37,694
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.

386
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,530
If his parents hadn't 86'd him...

387
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:41,407
you two might have been bunkies
at prep school.

388
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,117
Oswald controls the Red Triangle Gang.

389
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:45,869
I can't prove it yet, but we both--

390
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,372
Wayne, I'll not stand
for mudslinging in this office.

391
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:52,042
If my assistant was here,
she already would have escorted you out....

392
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:53,794
Anywhere he wants.

393
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:57,840
Preferably some nightspot, grotto...

394
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:00,801
or secluded hideaway.

395
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:05,264
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.

396
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:06,515
Selina.

397
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,727
Selina. Selina.

398
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,354
That's my name, Maximillions.

399
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:15,107
Don't wear it out,
or I'll make you buy me a new one.

400
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,193
Selina....

401
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:22,197
This is Bruce Wayne.

402
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,951
- Yeah, we've met.
- Have we?

403
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:30,747
Oh, I'm sorry. You know what?
I mistook me for somebody else. Sorry.

404
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:32,082
You mean, mistook me.

405
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,711
I mistook.... Yeah. Isn't that what I said?

406
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:37,546
No, I don't think so.

407
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:39,965
What happened?

408
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:44,845
Did you injure yourself on that ski slope?

409
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:48,974
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?

410
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:53,687
It's a blur.

411
00:46:54,730 --> 00:47:00,402
I mean, not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...

412
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:03,280
and Betsy Riley saying
it was morning sickness.

413
00:47:03,447 --> 00:47:06,450
And I remember the time
I forgot to wear my underpants to school...

414
00:47:06,617 --> 00:47:10,412
and the name of the boy
who noticed was Ricky Friedburg.

415
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:12,956
He's dead now.

416
00:47:13,624 --> 00:47:16,752
But last night, complete blur.

417
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:20,631
Couldn't you just die?

418
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:25,802
Selina, please...

419
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:29,264
show out Mr. Wayne.

420
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:30,557
With pleasure.

421
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,103
Um, your coat, Mr. Wayne.

422
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:36,939
Oh. Right.

423
00:47:48,951 --> 00:47:52,162
You don't seem like the type
who does business with Mr. Shreck.

424
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:54,790
No, you don't seem like the type
that takes orders from him.

425
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:57,960
Well, that's a long story.

426
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:01,213
I could free up some time.

427
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,092
- I'm listed.
- I'm tempted.

428
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:06,343
I'm working.

429
00:48:07,761 --> 00:48:08,845
I'm leaving.

430
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:12,558
- Dad, you buy that blurry business?
- Women.

431
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:15,060
Nothing surprises me, Chip.

432
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,354
Except your late mother.

433
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:20,566
Who'd have thought
Selina had a brain to damage?

434
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,442
Bottom line?

435
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:26,905
She tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out a higher window.

436
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:30,284
Meantime, I've got badder fish to fry.

437
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:45,173
Oswald, it's Max.

438
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:00,147
You're home?

439
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:08,864
How've you been?

440
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:12,200
Your extended family?

441
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:14,494
Good to have a family.

442
00:49:16,622 --> 00:49:18,665
I'd much rather not be disturbed now.

443
00:49:18,832 --> 00:49:21,918
Come on downstairs, Oswald. I have a surprise.

444
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:23,587
I don't like surprises.

445
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,064
Come on down.

446
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:56,286
Don't peek.

447
00:49:58,455 --> 00:49:59,706
You'll spoil it.

448
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:06,672
Ta-da!

449
00:50:23,397 --> 00:50:27,317
Yes. Adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know.

450
00:50:27,484 --> 00:50:30,946
But someone's got to supplant
our standing-in-the-way-of-progress mayor.

451
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:34,616
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot,
you've got the magic.

452
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,286
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.

453
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:41,915
Mayor?

454
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,292
Mayor.

455
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:49,589
Max, elections happen in November.
Is this not late December?

456
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:51,091
Don't worry about it.

457
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:55,595
I want you to meet Jen and Josh,
my image consultants.

458
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:57,514
Here.

459
00:50:57,848 --> 00:50:59,433
Reclaim your birthright.

460
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:04,604
I'm Jen. Hi.

461
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,649
Okay, let's see.

462
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:12,320
What I'd like to do first is to put
these little glove thingies on you.

463
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:15,157
Our research tells us that voters like fingers.

464
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:17,743
So if we wanna just lose this....

465
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:21,747
We'll do it another time then, okay?

466
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,042
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
down in the sewer, huh?

467
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,851
Still, could be worse.
My nose could be gushing blood.

468
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,232
Your nose could be....
What do you mean by that?

469
00:51:52,194 --> 00:51:53,653
Oh, God!

470
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,031
Everybody, back to work!

471
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:59,826
Let's make a mayor!

472
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,794
You're right, we missed
the regularly scheduled election...

473
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,671
but elected officials can be recalled,
impeached...

474
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,466
given the boot. Look at Nixon. Agnew.

475
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:16,468
Then think of you...

476
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:19,638
Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.

477
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:21,348
I'd like to fill her void.

478
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:28,814
We're gonna need signatures
to overturn the ballot. I can supply those.

479
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,818
- Teach her my French flipper trick.
- Oswald, we need one more thing.

480
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:36,488
A platform?

481
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:42,869
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world a giant icebox.

482
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:47,707
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled,
we have to have a catalyst, a trigger.

483
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:50,210
You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot.

484
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:54,047
Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot.

485
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:57,759
I need you, Oswald. I need you now.

486
00:52:58,927 --> 00:53:03,390
That's the biggest parasol I've ever seen.

487
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:07,435
Soon. One incident like the Gulf of Tonkin
or the Reichstag fire.

488
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:17,737
You want my old friends up there...

489
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:20,574
to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?

490
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,826
- Exactly.
- Sounds fun.

491
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:25,287
But...

492
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,248
I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.

493
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:30,000
I've got my own things to tend to.

494
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:34,379
Sidetracked? Oswald, this is your chance
to fulfill a destiny...

495
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:36,798
your parents carelessly discarded.

496
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:42,846
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?

497
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:46,141
Imagine, as mayor,
you'd have the ear of the media...

498
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:49,644
access to captains of industry...

499
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:51,980
unlimited poontang.

500
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:57,819
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.

501
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:00,780
All right, I'll be mayor.

502
00:54:05,035 --> 00:54:07,621
Burn, baby, burn!

503
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:51,451
- Who is she?
- What is she?

504
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:54,329
I don't know whether to open fire or fall in love.

505
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:56,498
You poor guys.

506
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:59,834
Always confusing your pistols
with your privates.

507
00:57:02,754 --> 00:57:05,298
Don't hurt us, lady.
Our take-home's less than 300.

508
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:07,300
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

509
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,195
Yeah. Go ahead and hit me.

510
00:58:05,984 --> 00:58:07,527
Admiring your handiwork?

511
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:11,865
Touring the riot scene.

512
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:16,119
Gravely assessing the devastation.

513
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:20,373
Upstanding mayor stuff.

514
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,712
You're not the mayor.

515
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:30,300
Things change.

516
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,677
What do you want?

517
00:58:32,844 --> 00:58:38,099
Ah. The direct approach.
I admire that in a man with a mask.

518
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:46,316
You don't really think you'll win, do you?

519
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,612
Things change.

520
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:04,542
Meow.

521
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:18,306
I saw her first. Gotta fly.

522
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:10,275
How could you? I'm a woman.

523
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:11,901
I'm sorry. I--

524
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:30,586
As I was saying, I'm a woman
and can't be taken for granted.

525
01:00:31,421 --> 01:00:34,048
Life's a bitch, now so am I.

526
01:00:50,857 --> 01:00:54,235
Who are you?
Who's the man behind the bat?

527
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:58,656
Maybe you can help me find...

528
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,535
the woman behind the cat.

529
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:06,831
No, that's not you.

530
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:09,917
Ahh.

531
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:12,754
There you are.

532
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:30,480
Saved by Kitty Litter.

533
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:35,943
Bastard!

534
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:54,003
Alfred...

535
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:57,298
bring me some antiseptic ointment,
would you?

536
01:01:57,465 --> 01:01:59,300
<i>Coming. Are you in pain, sir?</i>

537
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:03,471
No. Not really.

538
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,316
Meow.

539
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:19,987
Thank you.

540
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:29,205
I may have saved the mayor's baby...

541
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,834
but I refuse to save a mayor...

542
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,795
who stood by, helpless as a baby...

543
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:40,174
while Gotham was ravaged by a disease...

544
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:44,929
that turned Eagle Scouts into crazed clowns...

545
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:48,808
and happy homemakers into catwomen.

546
01:02:48,975 --> 01:02:50,059
Thank you.

547
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:56,023
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast
who's been romancing Gotham...

548
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,900
today made his bid to run Gotham.

549
01:02:58,067 --> 01:02:59,360
Thank you.

550
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:05,241
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest role model
a young person could have.

551
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:11,247
And you're the hottest young person
a role model could have.

552
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,250
Here.

553
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:16,919
Wear a button.

554
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:21,048
Let me just get it on there.

555
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,220
Thank you.

556
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:28,556
Thank you.

557
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:32,935
I could really get into this mayor stuff.

558
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,605
It's not about power,
it's about reaching out to people...

559
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:37,607
touching people, groping people.

560
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:39,775
- Penguin--
- My name's not Penguin!

561
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:42,403
It's Oswald Cobblepot.

562
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:46,199
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.

563
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:49,285
Ooh.

564
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:56,459
Just the pussy I've been looking for.

565
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:02,798
It's chilly in here.

566
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,094
- I'll warm you.
- Down, Oswald.

567
01:04:09,764 --> 01:04:11,265
We need to talk.

568
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:15,228
You see, you and I have something in common.

569
01:04:15,937 --> 01:04:17,355
Sounds familiar.

570
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:20,107
Appetite for destruction?

571
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:22,818
Contempt for the czars of fashion?

572
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:24,820
Wait, don't tell me.

573
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:28,449
Naked sexual charisma?

574
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:29,825
Batman.

575
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:33,746
The thorn in both our sides.

576
01:04:33,913 --> 01:04:36,165
The fly in our ointment.

577
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:37,500
Ointment?

578
01:04:38,501 --> 01:04:40,836
I've got scented or unscented.

579
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:42,547
I'll come back later.

580
01:04:43,089 --> 01:04:47,385
Perchance, are you a registered voter?
I am a mayoral prospect.

581
01:04:47,552 --> 01:04:50,596
I have but one pet cause today.

582
01:04:51,055 --> 01:04:52,515
Ban the bat.

583
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:57,395
Oh, him again. No bother.
He's already history. Check it out.

584
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:02,441
We're gonna disassemble his Batmobile
and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.

585
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:05,027
No. No.

586
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:08,114
He'd have even more power as a martyr.

587
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:13,077
To destroy Batman, we must first turn him
into what he hates the most.

588
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:14,954
Namely, us.

589
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:18,207
You mean, frame him?

590
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:21,544
Not even in office yet
and already an enemies list, hm?

591
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:25,715
Those names are not for prying eyes.

592
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:31,137
Why should I trust some cat-broad, anyway?

593
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:36,058
Maybe you're just a screwed-up sorority chick
who's getting back at her daddy...

594
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:40,229
for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweet 16.

595
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:58,456
Nice birdie.

596
01:06:08,341 --> 01:06:11,385
Mmm. Mmm.

597
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:15,348
Nice kitty.

598
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:17,058
- Mm-mmm.
- Nice kitty.

599
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:18,851
Nice kitty.

600
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:26,525
Look, Batman napalmed my arm.

601
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:30,613
He knocked me off a building just when
I was starting to feel good about myself.

602
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,658
I want to play an integral part
in his degradation.

603
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:40,623
A plan is forming.

604
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,298
I want in.

605
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:54,637
The thought of busting Batman
makes me feel all...

606
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:57,807
dirty.

607
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:05,189
Maybe I'll just give myself a bath right here.

608
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:17,952
<i>I challenge the mayor...</i>

609
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:21,956
<i>to relight the Christmas tree
in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.</i>

610
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:27,628
Sir, shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and class?

611
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,423
The <i>Love Connection</i> perhaps?

612
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:34,677
<i>Not that I have any faith in the mayor.</i>

613
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:38,681
<i>But I hope and pray that Batman...</i>

614
01:07:38,848 --> 01:07:43,018
<i>will be present to preserve the peace.
Thank you very much.</i>

615
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:44,353
Subtle.

616
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:49,859
Why are you doing this?

617
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:53,863
- Selina?
- Huh?

618
01:07:54,029 --> 01:07:56,991
Hi. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

619
01:07:57,158 --> 01:08:00,828
Scare me? No.
I was just scaring myself, actually.

620
01:08:01,662 --> 01:08:03,748
I don't see how, but....

621
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:06,834
It's nice to see you out in the real world,
away from Shreck.

622
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:10,004
Well, it's nice to be here.

623
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:16,177
- You all right?
- Hm? Mm-hm.

624
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:20,389
You look like maybe you have
the holiday blues or something.

625
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:22,141
No.

626
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:27,188
Boy, the news these days. Weird.

627
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:30,441
I heard on TV that...

628
01:08:30,608 --> 01:08:33,110
Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds.

629
01:08:34,195 --> 01:08:36,113
I don't know how these hacks sleep at night.

630
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:39,158
It's not even accurate. "Batman blows it"?

631
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:42,578
He probably saved millions of dollars
in property damage alone.

632
01:08:43,996 --> 01:08:47,875
You're not going to that, are you?
The relighting of the tree thing?

633
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:50,377
No. I wouldn't be caught dead there.

634
01:08:51,504 --> 01:08:54,799
It's gonna be a hot time
on the cold town tonight.

635
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:59,845
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?

636
01:09:00,012 --> 01:09:01,889
No darker than yours, Bruce.

637
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,604
Listen, why don't you come over
and we can watch it together on TV?

638
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:11,982
- What?
- The tree-lighting ceremony.

639
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:15,110
I can't. I have to be somewhere tonight.

640
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:18,322
How about if you come over
for an early dinner. Let's say 5?

641
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:19,907
Let's say 6?

642
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:21,700
Okay, 5.

643
01:09:21,867 --> 01:09:24,161
Five. You and me. Okay?

644
01:09:30,835 --> 01:09:34,088
The tree lights up, and then I push the button.

645
01:09:34,255 --> 01:09:35,506
No, wait.

646
01:09:35,673 --> 01:09:38,467
I press the button, and then the tree lights up.

647
01:09:41,262 --> 01:09:44,390
- Who are you?
- Talent scout.

648
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:46,433
Come in.

649
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,229
You know, I don't just light trees.
I'm an actress, as well.

650
01:09:50,396 --> 01:09:51,605
Ooh.

651
01:09:52,565 --> 01:09:55,776
What is that thing?
A camera or something?

652
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:57,486
Say cheese.

653
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:00,155
Cheese.

654
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,002
Thanks, Alfred.

655
01:10:15,129 --> 01:10:17,464
I'm sure he's wonderful company...

656
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:21,260
but doesn't the gold-plated bachelor bit
get a little stale?

657
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:26,015
A lot like the lonely secretary syndrome,
I guess.

658
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:29,101
- Executive assistant.
- Sorry.

659
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:34,023
Secretary.

660
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:40,362
Any girlfriend?

661
01:10:42,907 --> 01:10:44,158
Sure.

662
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:47,661
You mean, as in serious?

663
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:50,915
Uh, no. Had one, didn't work.

664
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:54,460
What went wrong? Hang on, I think I know.

665
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:58,464
- You kept things from her.
- No, I told her everything.

666
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,342
And the truth frightened her?

667
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:06,013
There are two truths, you know?

668
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:10,392
She had trouble reconciling them,
because I had trouble...

669
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:13,354
reconciling them.

670
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:15,689
Yeah.

671
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,652
- See, Vicki thought--
- Vicki?

672
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:22,905
Ice skater or stewardess?

673
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:27,993
No, she was a photojournalist.

674
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:32,623
Well, was Vicki right
about your difficulty with duality?

675
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:37,962
See....

676
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:41,298
If I say yes, then...

677
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,760
you're gonna think of me as...

678
01:11:44,927 --> 01:11:48,013
a Norman Bates, Ted Bundy type and....

679
01:11:53,978 --> 01:11:57,356
Well, you might not let me kiss you.

680
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:03,946
It's the so-called normal guys
who always let you down.

681
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:07,783
Sickos never scare me.
At least they're committed.

682
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:14,081
Well, yeah.

683
01:12:47,656 --> 01:12:50,242
- You can't do that.
- Neither can I.

684
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:55,122
<i>The Ice Princess has been
kidnapped. Commissioner Gordon...</i>

685
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:57,499
<i>can you confirm for us
the reports we're hearing...</i>

686
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:00,544
<i>of Batman's suspected involvement
in the abduction?</i>

687
01:13:00,711 --> 01:13:03,130
<i>This evidence is purely circumstantial.</i>

688
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:07,760
<i>This was found, stained with blood,
in the missing girl's dressing room.</i>

689
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:12,556
- I gotta get out of here.
- No, it's your house.

690
01:13:12,723 --> 01:13:17,227
Hold on. Just sit for a second and relax.
I'll be right back.

691
01:13:25,778 --> 01:13:28,989
- Alfred, I've got to get down to the plaza.
- I saw it.

692
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:31,158
I know. He's practically begging me to show.

693
01:13:31,325 --> 01:13:32,701
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.

694
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:35,871
No, I can't. There's been a kidnapping.
Here's what I want you to do.

695
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:37,664
Shit!

696
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:45,339
Tell Selina, you know, Miss Kyle in there,
tell her I had to go out of town.

697
01:13:45,506 --> 01:13:49,510
Tell her there's a big business deal
that came up. No, you know what?

698
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:53,263
Let her know, not in some kind of dumb,
be-my-girlfriend kind of way--

699
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,474
- I will relay the message.
- Great.

700
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:00,270
- Miss Kyle...
- Alfred.

701
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:03,315
- Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that--
- Mr. Wayne?

702
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:04,775
Bruce, yes.

703
01:14:04,942 --> 01:14:07,861
Um, would you tell him for me that...

704
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:11,448
I've been going through a lot of changes and....

705
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:14,743
No. Just that...

706
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:18,997
this is not a rejection, my abruptly leaving.

707
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:21,583
In fact, he makes me feel the way...

708
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,044
I hope I really am.

709
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:25,879
No.

710
01:14:26,046 --> 01:14:30,300
Could you just make up a sonnet
or something, a dirty limerick?

711
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:33,887
- One has just sprung to mind.
- Thanks.

712
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:37,224
- This way, ma'am.
- Sorry.

713
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:06,879
Where is that?

714
01:15:36,617 --> 01:15:38,202
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

715
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:41,205
<i>Please, if I could have your attention
for just a minute.</i>

716
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,959
<i>Folks, I know that to many of you...</i>

717
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:48,795
<i>Gotham seems a bit beleaguered these days.</i>

718
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:52,382
<i>But I want you to know
that your elected officials...</i>

719
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:56,887
<i>and your police department have
the situation well in hand.</i>

720
01:16:57,864 --> 01:16:59,741
- Gotta hurry.
- Thank you.

721
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:02,911
- It was set up to look like I did this.
- No sweat. I'll just tell the police...

722
01:17:03,078 --> 01:17:05,122
I was kidnapped by an ugly birdman
with fish breath.

723
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:06,957
Did somebody say "fish"?

724
01:17:07,124 --> 01:17:09,459
I haven't been fed all day.

725
01:17:09,918 --> 01:17:10,919
Eat floor.

726
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:14,715
High fiber.

727
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:16,800
Hey, stud...

728
01:17:16,967 --> 01:17:20,554
- I thought we had something together.
- We do.

729
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:38,822
Gotta go. Girl talk.

730
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:10,479
She let me go. I think
because I reasoned with her, girl to girl.

731
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:14,107
Be careful. Don't move.

732
01:18:16,443 --> 01:18:17,819
Lawn dart!

733
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:24,034
Rats with wings, do your thing.

734
01:18:30,624 --> 01:18:32,793
Batman pushed the Princess!

735
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:48,850
Hold your fire!

736
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:51,978
Hold your fire!

737
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:06,785
You're catnip to a girl like me.

738
01:19:07,828 --> 01:19:10,414
Handsome, dazed...

739
01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:13,166
and to die for.

740
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:23,176
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

741
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:28,473
But a kiss can be even deadlier
if you mean it.

742
01:19:37,566 --> 01:19:40,986
You're the second man
who killed me this week.

743
01:19:41,153 --> 01:19:43,029
But I've got seven lives left.

744
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,322
I tried to save you--

745
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:47,868
Seems like every woman
you try to save ends up dead.

746
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:50,454
Or deeply resentful.

747
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:52,914
Maybe you should retire.

748
01:20:16,062 --> 01:20:17,147
Damn.

749
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:53,892
Outstanding.

750
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:57,145
You're Beauty and the Beast...

751
01:20:57,312 --> 01:21:01,233
in one luscious Christmas gift pack.

752
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:03,652
You said you were going to scare
the Ice Princess.

753
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:05,779
She looked pretty scared to me.

754
01:21:08,448 --> 01:21:09,824
Touch of the bubbly?

755
01:21:14,204 --> 01:21:15,956
So, what are we waiting for?

756
01:21:16,498 --> 01:21:19,793
Let's consummate our fiendish union.

757
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,503
What are you talking about?

758
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:25,090
Oh, come on. Can't you picture?

759
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:27,717
It's dark in the mayor's mansion.

760
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:32,097
I'm bushed,
so here you come into the bedroom...

761
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:34,349
twitching your little tail...

762
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:37,686
my slippers in one hand,
a dry martini in the other.

763
01:21:37,852 --> 01:21:39,187
Oh, please.

764
01:21:39,813 --> 01:21:41,898
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.

765
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:44,818
You lousy minx! I ought to have you spayed!

766
01:21:44,985 --> 01:21:46,695
You sent out all the signals!

767
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:49,114
And I don't think I like you anymore!

768
01:21:57,497 --> 01:22:01,209
Goodbye, my unintended. Go to heaven.

769
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:39,289
Thank you.

770
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:01,978
There he is!

771
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:06,524
<i>Don't adjust your sets.</i>

772
01:23:07,317 --> 01:23:12,072
<i>Welcome to
the Oswald Cobblepot School of Driving.</i>

773
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:15,992
<i>Gentlemen, start your screaming.</i>

774
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:53,780
<i>Maybe this is a bad time to mention this,
but my license has expired!</i>

775
01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:11,798
<i>Just relax.</i>

776
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:16,678
<i>I'll take care of the squealing,
wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham!</i>

777
01:25:03,475 --> 01:25:06,144
<i>You gotta admit, I played this stinking city...</i>

778
01:25:06,311 --> 01:25:08,188
<i>like a harp from hell!</i>

779
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:30,126
Helpless old lady at 12:00 high.

780
01:26:07,747 --> 01:26:08,790
That's funny.

781
01:26:17,549 --> 01:26:18,925
Now I'm a little worried.

782
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:48,454
So he survived. What's the worry?

783
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:52,792
He didn't even lose a limb,
an eyeball, bladder control.

784
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:56,880
The point is, listen to them.
They've lost faith in old symbols.

785
01:26:57,046 --> 01:27:00,174
They're ready to bond with you,
the icon of the future.

786
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:02,176
If it works, don't fix it.

787
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:04,679
We'll celebrate tonight
at my annual Max-querade Ball.

788
01:27:04,846 --> 01:27:06,931
Shreck and Cobblepot...

789
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:10,643
the visionary alliance. Come on.

790
01:27:29,495 --> 01:27:31,414
<i>When it came time...</i>

791
01:27:31,581 --> 01:27:35,251
<i>to ensure the safety of our fair city...</i>

792
01:27:36,336 --> 01:27:38,129
<i>did the mayor have a plan?</i>

793
01:27:38,296 --> 01:27:39,380
No!

794
01:27:39,547 --> 01:27:40,673
<i>No!</i>

795
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:45,094
<i>He relied on a man.</i>

796
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:47,555
<i>A Batman.</i>

797
01:27:48,014 --> 01:27:51,935
<i>A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak....</i>

798
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:55,688
Our prime concern is this ghastly grotesque.

799
01:27:56,022 --> 01:27:59,108
But let's not forget
about repairing the Batmobile.

800
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:01,527
There's security to consider.

801
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:05,490
It's not as though we can take it
to any old Joe's body shop, is it, sir?

802
01:28:05,657 --> 01:28:06,908
Security?

803
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:09,118
Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave?

804
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:13,623
I'm sitting there, working, and I turn around
and there she is. "Hi, Vick. Come on in."

805
01:28:23,091 --> 01:28:25,551
- Ready?
- I think I'll take the stairs.

806
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:51,619
<i>You ask me, am I up here for personal glory?</i>

807
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,788
<i>No.</i>

808
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:58,334
<i>I toiled for many years...</i>

809
01:28:58,501 --> 01:29:01,170
<i>in utter obscurity...</i>

810
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:05,299
<i>beneath your boulevards.</i>

811
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:09,929
<i>The glory that I yearn to recapture...</i>

812
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:13,725
<i>is the glory of Gotham!</i>

813
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:34,245
<i>How can this be accomplished?</i>

814
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:39,584
<i>I know you're all concerned.</i>

815
01:29:41,753 --> 01:29:43,463
<i>Hey, just relax.</i>

816
01:29:43,629 --> 01:29:48,885
<i>I'll take care of the squealing,
wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham!</i>

817
01:29:55,391 --> 01:29:56,851
I didn't say that.

818
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:03,357
<i>You gotta admit, I played this stinking city...</i>

819
01:30:03,524 --> 01:30:05,485
<i>like a harp from hell!</i>

820
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,286
Boo!

821
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,976
Get out of here!

822
01:31:05,878 --> 01:31:09,590
Why is there always someone
who brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech?

823
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:35,324
There he is!

824
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:08,065
My babies.

825
01:32:09,567 --> 01:32:10,943
Did you miss me?

826
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:26,834
Did you miss me?

827
01:32:28,586 --> 01:32:30,171
Great speech, Oswald.

828
01:32:31,589 --> 01:32:35,509
My name is not Oswald! It's Penguin!

829
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:37,970
I am not a human being!

830
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:41,515
I am an animal! Cold-blooded!

831
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:43,643
Crank the a.c.!

832
01:32:43,809 --> 01:32:46,729
Where are my lists? Bring me the names!

833
01:32:47,813 --> 01:32:49,315
It's time.

834
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:53,694
These are the names
of the first-born sons of Gotham City.

835
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:55,655
Just like I was.

836
01:32:55,988 --> 01:32:59,825
And like me, a terrible fate waits for them.

837
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:03,871
Tonight, while their parents party...

838
01:33:04,163 --> 01:33:06,707
they'll be dreaming away...

839
01:33:06,874 --> 01:33:09,085
in their safe cribs...

840
01:33:09,252 --> 01:33:11,254
their soft beds...

841
01:33:11,504 --> 01:33:13,673
and we will snatch them...

842
01:33:13,839 --> 01:33:15,758
carry them into the sewer...

843
01:33:15,925 --> 01:33:20,179
and toss them into a deep, dark, watery grave.

844
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,265
Um, Penguin?

845
01:33:23,182 --> 01:33:27,520
I mean, killing sleeping children,
isn't that a little, uh...?

846
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:39,865
No, it's a lot "uh."

847
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:50,751
Mr. Wayne, a reminder.

848
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:54,964
Tonight is that loathsome party
hosted by the odious Mr. Shreck.

849
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:58,092
May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?

850
01:33:58,759 --> 01:33:59,802
Not interested.

851
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:03,514
Although...

852
01:34:05,933 --> 01:34:07,810
Selina Kyle might be there.

853
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,793
Ingenious costume.

854
01:34:33,419 --> 01:34:34,754
Let me guess.

855
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:37,173
Trust fund goodie-goodie.

856
01:34:38,424 --> 01:34:39,759
Feeling good, huh?

857
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:44,472
Well, you almost made a monster
the mayor of Gotham City.

858
01:34:44,638 --> 01:34:46,682
I am the light of this city...

859
01:34:47,266 --> 01:34:49,477
and I am its mean, twisted soul.

860
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:51,645
Does it matter who's mayor?

861
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:54,607
- It does to me.
- Yawn.

862
01:35:31,936 --> 01:35:33,104
- Hi.
- Hi.

863
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,773
I'm sorry about yesterday, but I had...

864
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:39,193
a pretty big deal come through.
Fall through, actually.

865
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:42,196
It's okay. I had to go home and feed my cat.

866
01:35:51,038 --> 01:35:52,456
So no hard feelings, then?

867
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:56,627
Actually...

868
01:35:58,963 --> 01:36:00,631
semi-hard, I'd say.

869
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:10,933
There's a big, comfy California King
over in Bedding.

870
01:36:12,226 --> 01:36:13,686
What do you say?

871
01:36:14,854 --> 01:36:16,605
You mean, take off our costumes?

872
01:36:20,359 --> 01:36:22,570
I guess I'm tired of wearing masks.

873
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,447
Me too.

874
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:27,491
Let me ask you something.

875
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:30,369
Why'd you come tonight?

876
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:33,122
- You first.
- To see you.

877
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:36,709
That's lovely.

878
01:36:38,461 --> 01:36:42,089
I really wish I could say the same,
but I came for Max.

879
01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:46,427
What do you mean? You and....

880
01:36:46,594 --> 01:36:47,720
Not you and Max.

881
01:36:49,597 --> 01:36:50,890
Me and Max.

882
01:36:57,354 --> 01:36:59,732
No. This and Max.

883
01:37:02,485 --> 01:37:06,280
Don't give me
a killing-Max-won't-solve-anything speech.

884
01:37:06,447 --> 01:37:07,573
Because it will.

885
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:10,951
Aren't you tired
of this sanctimonious robber-baron...

886
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:13,621
always coming out on top
when he should be six feet under?

887
01:37:13,787 --> 01:37:16,081
I'm sure you have a lot of problems
with your boss...

888
01:37:16,248 --> 01:37:18,167
but who the hell do you think you are?

889
01:37:21,504 --> 01:37:23,672
I don't know anymore, Bruce.

890
01:37:38,145 --> 01:37:40,272
A kiss under the mistletoe.

891
01:37:41,857 --> 01:37:45,736
You know,
mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

892
01:37:45,903 --> 01:37:47,696
But a kiss can be even deadlier...

893
01:37:50,616 --> 01:37:51,784
if you mean it.

894
01:38:02,461 --> 01:38:03,712
Oh, my God.

895
01:38:04,588 --> 01:38:06,674
Does this mean we have to start fighting?

896
01:38:08,342 --> 01:38:09,552
Let's go outside.

897
01:38:45,504 --> 01:38:47,423
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

898
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:59,893
You didn't invite me, so I crashed!

899
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:06,483
- What do you want?
- Right now, my troops...

900
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:09,028
are fanning out across town...

901
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:12,197
for your children! Yes!

902
01:39:12,364 --> 01:39:15,034
For your first-born sons!

903
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,203
The ones you left defenseless at home...

904
01:39:18,537 --> 01:39:20,789
so you could dress up like jerks...

905
01:39:20,956 --> 01:39:23,667
get juiced and dance...

906
01:39:23,834 --> 01:39:25,169
badly!

907
01:39:29,882 --> 01:39:31,717
I've personally come...

908
01:39:32,384 --> 01:39:34,762
for Gotham's favorite son:

909
01:39:34,928 --> 01:39:36,555
Mr. Chip Shreck.

910
01:39:37,931 --> 01:39:41,352
You're coming with me, you great white dope...

911
01:39:41,644 --> 01:39:44,271
to die way down in the sewer.

912
01:39:44,438 --> 01:39:48,442
Not Chip. If you have an iota
of human feeling, take me instead.

913
01:39:50,736 --> 01:39:52,655
I don't. So, no.

914
01:39:52,821 --> 01:39:54,823
I'm the one you want. Ask yourself.

915
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:58,160
Isn't it Max Shreck
who manipulated and betrayed you?

916
01:39:58,327 --> 01:40:00,496
Isn't it Max, not Chip...

917
01:40:00,954 --> 01:40:04,500
who you want to see immersed
to his eyeballs in raw sewage?

918
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:11,340
Okay, you got a point.

919
01:40:11,507 --> 01:40:14,426
I'll let the little prince live for now.

920
01:40:14,593 --> 01:40:16,178
In the duck!

921
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:45,124
This is gonna be good...

922
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:50,796
to cut down a whole crop
of Gotham's most promising...

923
01:40:50,963 --> 01:40:52,631
before their prime.

924
01:40:54,967 --> 01:40:57,720
You ask me, how do I lure them in?

925
01:41:01,807 --> 01:41:04,435
A little Pied Penguin action.

926
01:41:06,603 --> 01:41:09,857
And you get to watch them sink...

927
01:41:10,023 --> 01:41:11,859
into a deep puddle...

928
01:41:12,025 --> 01:41:15,070
of your industrial byproducts.

929
01:41:15,487 --> 01:41:18,073
Then you join them.

930
01:41:52,316 --> 01:41:55,194
Would you hurry up
and get those kids loaded already?

931
01:42:04,495 --> 01:42:06,955
Right this way, kiddies. Come on.

932
01:42:07,122 --> 01:42:08,332
Come with me.

933
01:42:25,057 --> 01:42:26,892
So where are all the children?

934
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:37,861
"Batman."

935
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:53,585
My dear penguins...

936
01:42:54,628 --> 01:42:57,256
we stand on a great threshold.

937
01:42:58,465 --> 01:43:00,425
It's okay to be scared.

938
01:43:01,218 --> 01:43:03,428
Many of you won't be coming back.

939
01:43:04,054 --> 01:43:08,100
Thanks to Batman, the time has come...

940
01:43:08,559 --> 01:43:10,811
to punish all of God's children.

941
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:16,108
First-, second-, third-, and fourth-born!

942
01:43:16,275 --> 01:43:17,943
Why be biased?

943
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:20,153
Male and female!

944
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,323
Hell, the sexes are equal...

945
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:28,120
with their erogenous zones blown sky-high!

946
01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:34,042
Forward march!

947
01:43:34,793 --> 01:43:37,921
The liberation of Gotham...

948
01:43:38,088 --> 01:43:40,674
has begun!

949
01:44:24,676 --> 01:44:26,720
<i>The penguins are moving above ground.</i>

950
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:56,333
<i>Penguin army approaching launch destination...</i>

951
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:57,751
<i>at Gotham Plaza.</i>

952
01:44:58,877 --> 01:45:01,213
<i>One minute until ignition.</i>

953
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,715
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal...

954
01:45:03,882 --> 01:45:06,551
so I'm laying them on a slab!

955
01:45:07,552 --> 01:45:10,055
<i>The penguins seem
to be converging on Gotham Plaza.</i>

956
01:45:33,328 --> 01:45:36,790
<i>Thirty seconds until ignition.</i>

957
01:45:37,582 --> 01:45:40,585
<i>Estimated casualties after launch:</i>

958
01:45:41,378 --> 01:45:43,755
<i>100,000 people.</i>

959
01:45:45,924 --> 01:45:49,636
<i>The penguins have reached Gotham Square.</i>

960
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:11,033
<i>Fifteen seconds to ignition.</i>

961
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:14,661
Ready when you are, sir.

962
01:46:17,664 --> 01:46:19,082
I've got the coordinates.

963
01:46:19,249 --> 01:46:23,754
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven....</i>

964
01:46:27,257 --> 01:46:29,718
- All right. Let's turn them around.
- Yes, sir.

965
01:46:37,517 --> 01:46:38,643
<i>Something is wrong.</i>

966
01:46:41,063 --> 01:46:43,398
<i>Something has jammed the signal.</i>

967
01:46:53,075 --> 01:46:55,410
<i>They seem to be turning around.</i>

968
01:47:24,231 --> 01:47:25,482
Hey.

969
01:47:26,483 --> 01:47:29,569
<i>There is also something coming this way.</i>

970
01:47:30,362 --> 01:47:32,864
<i>Very large. Very fast.</i>

971
01:47:48,713 --> 01:47:49,840
Who's there?

972
01:47:57,222 --> 01:47:59,141
I'm homing in on the signal's origin.

973
01:49:16,009 --> 01:49:19,012
You're just jealous
because I'm a genuine freak...

974
01:49:19,179 --> 01:49:21,223
and you have to wear a mask!

975
01:49:21,806 --> 01:49:23,433
You might be right.

976
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:30,106
But what it all comes down to is,
who's holding the umbrella?

977
01:49:56,549 --> 01:49:58,051
My babies!

978
01:51:34,647 --> 01:51:39,736
I don't know what you want, but I know
I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.

979
01:51:41,112 --> 01:51:43,573
Money, jewels...

980
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:45,867
a very big ball of string.

981
01:51:50,288 --> 01:51:52,082
- Your blood, Max.
- My blood?

982
01:51:52,248 --> 01:51:54,167
I gave at the office.

983
01:51:54,334 --> 01:51:56,252
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.

984
01:51:56,419 --> 01:51:58,296
Let's make a deal.

985
01:51:58,463 --> 01:52:00,298
Other than my blood, what can I do for you?

986
01:52:00,465 --> 01:52:03,176
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.

987
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:16,564
You're not just saving a life, you're saving--

988
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:18,274
Shut up. You're going to jail.

989
01:52:19,401 --> 01:52:23,947
Don't be naive. The law doesn't apply
to people like him or us.

990
01:52:24,114 --> 01:52:25,824
Wrong on both counts.

991
01:52:35,875 --> 01:52:37,043
Why are you doing this?

992
01:52:41,047 --> 01:52:42,966
Let's just take him to the police.

993
01:52:44,843 --> 01:52:46,177
Then we can go home...

994
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,888
together.

995
01:52:54,894 --> 01:52:55,937
Selina...

996
01:52:59,232 --> 01:53:00,692
don't you see?

997
01:53:02,026 --> 01:53:03,069
We're the same.

998
01:53:05,864 --> 01:53:07,157
We're the same.

999
01:53:08,741 --> 01:53:11,494
Split, right down the center.

1000
01:53:32,056 --> 01:53:34,350
Selina, please.

1001
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:37,228
Bruce...

1002
01:53:38,062 --> 01:53:41,733
I would love to live with you in your castle...

1003
01:53:43,693 --> 01:53:45,904
forever, just like in a fairy tale.

1004
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:55,830
I just couldn't live with myself.
So don't pretend this is a happy ending.

1005
01:53:55,997 --> 01:53:57,123
Selina.

1006
01:53:58,625 --> 01:53:59,876
Selina Kyle.

1007
01:54:01,419 --> 01:54:02,712
You're fired.

1008
01:54:03,254 --> 01:54:05,173
And Bruce Wayne...

1009
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:07,133
why are you dressed up like Batman?

1010
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:10,470
Because he is Batman, you moron.

1011
01:54:11,054 --> 01:54:12,096
Was.

1012
01:54:14,849 --> 01:54:16,017
Don't.

1013
01:54:16,184 --> 01:54:19,604
You killed me, the Penguin killed me,
Batman killed me.

1014
01:54:19,771 --> 01:54:22,982
That's three lives down.
You got enough in there to finish me off?

1015
01:54:23,149 --> 01:54:24,651
One way to find out.

1016
01:54:28,279 --> 01:54:30,532
Four, five.

1017
01:54:34,285 --> 01:54:35,828
Still alive!

1018
01:54:45,129 --> 01:54:47,173
Six, seven.

1019
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:50,218
All good girls go to heaven.

1020
01:54:56,307 --> 01:54:57,976
Two lives left.

1021
01:55:00,144 --> 01:55:02,605
I think I'll save one for next Christmas.

1022
01:55:05,149 --> 01:55:07,068
But in the meantime...

1023
01:55:08,945 --> 01:55:11,072
how about a kiss, Santie Claus?

1024
01:56:42,205 --> 01:56:45,667
Shit! I picked a cute one.

1025
01:56:48,961 --> 01:56:51,089
The heat's getting to me.

1026
01:56:52,048 --> 01:56:54,717
I'll murder you momentarily.

1027
01:56:56,886 --> 01:56:58,262
But first...

1028
01:56:58,763 --> 01:57:01,182
I need a cool drink...

1029
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,893
of ice water.

1030
01:58:45,244 --> 01:58:46,496
Alfred, stop the car.

1031
02:00:07,702 --> 02:00:11,455
Well, come what may,
merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.

1032
02:00:12,665 --> 02:00:14,000
Merry Christmas, Alfred.

1033
02:00:16,168 --> 02:00:17,503
"Goodwill toward men."

1034
02:00:20,506 --> 02:00:21,549
And women.
