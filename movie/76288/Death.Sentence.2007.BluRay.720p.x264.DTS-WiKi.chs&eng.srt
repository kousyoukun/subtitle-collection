1
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,770
{\fs12}Okay. I can't get that, that...

2
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,630
{\fs12}Okay, guys. Ready?

3
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,270
{\fs12}- We wish you a Merry Christmas. - It's just the...

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,800
{\fs12}bike I wanted.

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,200
{\fs12}Yeah, do you like it?

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,530
{\fs12}Is that the one?

7
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,680
{\fs12}Good. Merry Christmas.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,370
{\fs12}Oh, the new hockey stick.

9
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,920
{\fs12}Is it a good size?

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,110
{\fs12}Yeah, it looks fine to me.

11
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,580
{\fs12}Let me see that slapshot.

12
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,710
{\fs12}Hey, don't knock anything off the table.

13
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,320
{\fs12}I am the greatest.

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,050
{\fs12}I am the greatest.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,630
{\fs12}Show me what you got. Oh.

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,030
{\fs12}Hang on one sec.

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,270
{\fs12}Ready?

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,700
{\fs12}All right, flip it up.

19
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,010
{\fs12}You okay?

20
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,810
{\fs12}You okay?

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,650
{\fs12}Okay, you're on your own.

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,220
{\fs12}Oh, my gosh. Luke.

23
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,480
{\fs12}Oh, honey.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,190
{\fs12}Watch out for the tree though.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,920
{\fs12}Do a trick.

26
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,330
{\fs12}Do a trick.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,760
{\fs12}How proud are you of him?

28
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,200
{\fs12}Oh, my God. He's amazing.

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,560
{\fs12}Did mommy do that?

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,640
{\fs12}Tell me the truth. Did mommy do that painting for you?

31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,870
{\fs12}Hey. Wow. Look at that.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,370
{\fs12}Just got one question. What the heck is it?

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,370
{\fs12}It is abstract.

34
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,610
{\fs12}So when I get signed, I'll buy you a new house, okay?

35
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,110
{\fs12}Hey, what's wrong with this house?

36
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,750
{\fs12}Ready?

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,410
{\fs12}Oh, shit.

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,250
{\fs12}Okay, make a wish.

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,250
{\fs12}So how old are you, mom?

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,330
{\fs12}- How old am I? - We were just wondering.

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,520
{\fs12}You look gorgeous.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,990
{\fs12}You don't look a day over...

43
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,300
{\fs12}Just spit it out, dad.

44
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,030
{\fs12}Brendan Hume, you've just won MVP.

45
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,400
{\fs12}...our golden boy.

46
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,280
{\fs12}Number one...

47
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,810
{\fs12}Get this baby lit.

48
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,210
{\fs12}Can I slap him when we wake him up?

49
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,540
{\fs12}No...

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:34,980
{\fs12}Please?

51
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,550
{\fs12}He's going to kill us.

52
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,680
{\fs12}Surprise!

53
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,290
{\fs12}- Surprise! - Happy Birthday, Lukey!

54
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,290
{\fs12}- Happy Birthday, Lukey! - Happy Birthday.

55
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,360
{\fs12}Fourteen,

56
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,500
{\fs12}it feels no different that yesterday when I was thirteen.

57
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,860
{\fs12}Do you want your fourteen punches now or...?

58
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,990
{\fs12}A little later, after I wake up.

59
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,790
{\fs12}Get off me.

60
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,190
{\fs12}Ah man. I almost had you.

61
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,170
{\fs12}Should old acquaintance be forgot.

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,470
{\fs12}And never brought to mind.

63
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,780
{\fs12}Should old acquaintance be forgot.

64
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,320
{\fs12}and days of auld lang syne.

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,370
{\fs12}Can I bother you?

66
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,250
{\fs12}Just you think there's no order anywhere, there's order looking right at you.

67
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,740
{\fs12}Okay.

68
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,450
{\fs12}What do you need here?

69
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,110
{\fs12}Annie just said I need you to approve this.

70
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,920
{\fs12}This guy worked here at Starfish for six years...

71
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,490
{\fs12}but his wife's dead, no kids, no will.

72
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,290
{\fs12}I just want to roll his pension back up into the fund,

73
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,450
{\fs12}make it easy.

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,460
{\fs12}Come on, don't make file with the state.

75
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,160
{\fs12}We file with the state so that one day...

76
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,700
{\fs12}if someone looks back at this guy's death, he will see that we did ourjob.

77
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,270
{\fs12}You're right. You've got to cover our asses.

78
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,870
{\fs12}I got it, sorry.

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,510
{\fs12}No... we do ourjob,

80
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,910
{\fs12}and we do right by a guy who worked for us.

81
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,480
{\fs12}Lest he died in vain.

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,140
{\fs12}What's that 'order in the universe' thing?

83
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,150
{\fs12}Well, you know, our insurer spent three hundred thousand bucks...

84
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,290
{\fs12}on this new model, new field data,

85
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,450
{\fs12}new society.

86
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,290
{\fs12}Who is the ideal employee?

87
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,220
{\fs12}Who dies how and when?

88
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,990
{\fs12}And they sent it over to show what a great job they're doing.

89
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,330
{\fs12}And you know what it says?

90
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,430
{\fs12}It says that people with kids live longer than people with no kids...

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,630
{\fs12}people with two live longer than people with one...

92
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,900
{\fs12}smoking is bad...

93
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,170
{\fs12}speeding is bad...

94
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,240
{\fs12}deaths in a family are bad... divorce is bad.

95
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,910
{\fs12}It's kind of nice...

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,310
{\fs12}to see that all that junk is still true.

97
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,820
{\fs12}You know?

98
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,350
{\fs12}Hey, you're the one with perfect kids.

99
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,180
{\fs12}Brendan, you're such a kiss-ass.

100
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,980
{\fs12}God gave me the skills.

101
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,150
{\fs12}- I can't help it. - Oh. God. Mom.

102
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,790
{\fs12}I need to go kill myself.

103
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,690
{\fs12}Of course you do, Lukey.

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,630
{\fs12}May I be excused?

105
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,460
{\fs12}No.

106
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,260
{\fs12}I've got a cretin for a brother.

107
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,800
{\fs12}I've a no-dick for a brother.

108
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,200
{\fs12}Okay, you stop. Right now.

109
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,930
{\fs12}You should know better.

110
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,940
{\fs12}What?

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,680
{\fs12}Let's be a family, should we?

112
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,570
{\fs12}Can I say no?

113
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,470
{\fs12}No.

114
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,450
{\fs12}I demand emancipation. I want a lawyer.

115
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,780
{\fs12}Okay, I am filing right...

116
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,350
{\fs12}- I'm home. - Now.

117
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,240
{\fs12}Sorry I'm late. Did I miss dinner?

118
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,080
{\fs12}No, there's plenty. I'll heat something up for you.

119
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,750
{\fs12}Hey, dad, I need a ride to the city on Saturday.

120
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,460
{\fs12}The city?

121
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,030
{\fs12}Yeah, it's an exchange game.

122
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,190
{\fs12}I'm the first line again.

123
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,360
{\fs12}No kidding.

124
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,300
{\fs12}- That's fantastic. - Yeah.

125
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,700
{\fs12}Waldren must love you.

126
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,800
{\fs12}Yeah, because he's a kiss-ass.

127
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,840
{\fs12}Well, good for him. We all going?

128
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,700
{\fs12}No, Lukey's got soccer.

129
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,480
{\fs12}Yeah, but I'm not starting

130
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,870
{\fs12}so you can just go on... - Maybe you should just kiss some...

131
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,140
{\fs12}more ass, orjust not suck so bad.

132
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,880
{\fs12}Dad, he was just kidding. Okay, he was just being an idiot.

133
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,780
{\fs12}Don't call him an idiot.

134
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,150
{\fs12}Lucas, you have a loyal and loving brother.

135
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,050
{\fs12}I agree.

136
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,160
{\fs12}A loyal and loving kiss-ass.

137
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,460
{\fs12}Look, should we just all please be civilized for once

138
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,720
{\fs12}before I kill somebody?

139
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,190
{\fs12}Whatever, weasel.

140
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,070
{\fs12}Duh, whatever, weasel.

141
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,330
{\fs12}Luke.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,030
{\fs12}Plate.

143
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,710
{\fs12}Come here, little punk.

144
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,380
{\fs12}Get off me.

145
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,480
{\fs12}See what you miss when you don't come home.

146
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,240
{\fs12}Yeah, well, at least they're not throwing food.

147
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,790
{\fs12}Play a heck of a game, kid. I'm proud of you.

148
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,000
{\fs12}Heck of a game.

149
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,760
{\fs12}Thank you...

150
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,430
{\fs12}Love the way you're handling the puck.

151
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,830
{\fs12}It's great.

152
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,910
{\fs12}So some of the guys have been talking about

153
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,970
{\fs12}maybe going to college in Canada.

154
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,450
{\fs12}Canada, huh?

155
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,550
{\fs12}Canada is far.

156
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,820
{\fs12}You'll still have Lukey.

157
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,220
{\fs12}Now there's a comfort.

158
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,090
{\fs12}Oh, no, come on, I'm kidding.

159
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,950
{\fs12}You get to kid about your kids or you lose your mind.

160
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,060
{\fs12}You'll see.

161
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,420
{\fs12}Look, you had a great game.

162
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,030
{\fs12}You've had several great games...

163
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,100
{\fs12}but professional hockey, is that what we're talking about here, Bren?

164
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,570
{\fs12}I mean maybe, I don't know.

165
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,200
{\fs12}That's a risky business.

166
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,100
{\fs12}And this is coming from your extensive professional sports background

167
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,740
{\fs12}- or... - No, my extensive...

168
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,440
{\fs12}risk assessment background, thank you very much.

169
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,840
{\fs12}Risk, liabilities, the stuff of life, son.

170
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,210
{\fs12}No, it's the stuff of your life, dad,

171
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,050
{\fs12}your thrilling life.

172
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,120
{\fs12}Hey, don't make fun of your father, you bum.

173
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,650
{\fs12}I'm the only one you get.

174
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,270
{\fs12}I guess we can talk to Coach Waldren...

175
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,240
{\fs12}and you can research schools in Canada...

176
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,000
{\fs12}and find somebody who could educate us on hockey

177
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,040
{\fs12}- versus law school. - Dad...

178
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:04,650
{\fs12}What?

179
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,750
{\fs12}Educate us?

180
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,110
{\fs12}Look, I just want to play some hockey.

181
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,080
{\fs12}Hey, lights.

182
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,560
{\fs12}Dad, so what do you say?

183
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,530
{\fs12}I said we could look into it,

184
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,990
{\fs12}- all right? - Okay.

185
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,330
{\fs12}Please don't tell your mother.

186
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,630
{\fs12}I would never.

187
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,920
{\fs12}Where the heck is the darn expressway?

188
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,220
{\fs12}Oh, great.

189
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,750
{\fs12}Hey, where do you think you're going?

190
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,010
{\fs12}I need my fluids, dad.

191
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,980
{\fs12}Oh, yeah, the obligatory Slushee stop.

192
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,810
{\fs12}They have them in there, right?

193
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,350
{\fs12}That, or something worse for you.

194
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,550
{\fs12}- Do you have money? - Yeah.

195
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,490
{\fs12}Okay, quick in and out, because we got to get home.

196
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,650
{\fs12}All right.

197
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,270
{\fs12}Hey, honey, it's me. I just wanted to let you know...

198
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,500
{\fs12}that our son is going to Canada to play hockey...

199
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,370
{\fs12}and we didn't want any kind of long drawn-out goodbye,

200
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,070
{\fs12}so I dropped him off at the airport.

201
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:45,870
{\fs12}He says he'll call,

202
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,480
{\fs12}but of course we may never see our son again.

203
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,680
{\fs12}But as long as he's happy, right?

204
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,120
{\fs12}Okay.

205
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,620
{\fs12}I love you.

206
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,780
{\fs12}And we'll be home soon. Bye.

207
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,390
{\fs12}Watch your ass, bitch.

208
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,030
{\fs12}Back up off me, all right. Whatever, man.

209
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,320
{\fs12}Get the fuck down

210
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,420
{\fs12}or I will blow your fucking head off.

211
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,950
{\fs12}Get the fuck down.

212
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,620
{\fs12}Hey, yo, this is your man.

213
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,650
{\fs12}This is your man.

214
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,050
{\fs12}- He's going for his gat, dog. - Come on, Billy.

215
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,470
{\fs12}Get this fucker.

216
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,070
{\fs12}That's your guy.

217
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,900
{\fs12}Do this or you're not one of us. Do it.

218
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,340
{\fs12}Hey, you can do this.

219
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,140
{\fs12}Joey.

220
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,780
{\fs12}Kill that motherfucker, Joey.

221
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,620
{\fs12}That's my boy.

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,760
{\fs12}Let's go. Let's go.

223
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,890
{\fs12}Give me the gun. Let's go.

224
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,960
{\fs12}- What about Joey. - Get the fuck in the car.

225
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,860
{\fs12}What the fuck!

226
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,270
{\fs12}Goddamn it.

227
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,280
{\fs12}Fuck you.

228
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,320
{\fs12}Motherfucker.

229
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,630
{\fs12}Brendan.

230
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,960
{\fs12}Brendan.

231
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,360
{\fs12}Oh, God.

232
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,900
{\fs12}Help.

233
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,460
{\fs12}Help me.

234
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,170
{\fs12}Somebody help me.

235
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,740
{\fs12}Help.

236
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,220
{\fs12}Where's Joe?

237
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,490
{\fs12}He's a man now.

238
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,390
{\fs12}He can take the subway.

239
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,810
{\fs12}Can you get some help?

240
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,600
{\fs12}Can somebody help us, please? Please.

241
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,340
{\fs12}Doctor.

242
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,840
{\fs12}I need a gurney.

243
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,110
{\fs12}He was cut. Somebody cut him in...

244
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,910
{\fs12}Get an airway open. Create an airway.

245
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,640
{\fs12}He's my son.

246
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,650
{\fs12}- That's my son. - Maggie.

247
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,010
{\fs12}- Okay, get him. - Brendan,

248
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,920
{\fs12}we're in the hospital now, okay?

249
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,460
{\fs12}They're going to take care of you now.

250
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,480
{\fs12}Get your fixed up.

251
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,620
{\fs12}Sir, I'm sorry.

252
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,520
{\fs12}You need to stay back here. - What?

253
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,220
{\fs12}- No, the doctors need to do theirjob, sir. - I know,

254
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,890
{\fs12}but I can't go in there?

255
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,500
{\fs12}Sorry.

256
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,400
{\fs12}Okay, he'll be okay, right?

257
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,870
{\fs12}It's my son.

258
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,440
{\fs12}His name's Brendan.

259
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,520
{\fs12}Five

260
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,930
{\fs12}It's number five.

261
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,730
{\fs12}That's Joe Darley.

262
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,110
{\fs12}He's...

263
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,970
{\fs12}a kid.

264
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,370
{\fs12}He's a runt. Almost twenty-three.

265
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,270
{\fs12}and he's an animal.

266
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,610
{\fs12}Supposed to have some kind of a...

267
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,880
{\fs12}pre-trial, a hearing, tomorrow...

268
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,140
{\fs12}and they want me to go make a statement.

269
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,220
{\fs12}You want to go with me?

270
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,690
{\fs12}You go.

271
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,670
{\fs12}Put that animal in jail.

272
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,980
{\fs12}That's what the cops called him.

273
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,570
{\fs12}Animal.

274
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,300
{\fs12}You're going to take that off?

275
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,300
{\fs12}The school said they wanted to do a memorial

276
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,770
{\fs12}at the next game.

277
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,480
{\fs12}The team wanted to do something.

278
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,280
{\fs12}That's nice of them.

279
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,560
{\fs12}He would have been playing.

280
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,240
{\fs12}Till my body is dust.

281
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:31,050
{\fs12}Till my soul is no more.

282
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,580
{\fs12}I will love you.

283
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,150
{\fs12}Love you.

284
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,800
{\fs12}Till the sun starts to cry.

285
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,700
{\fs12}And the moon turns to rust.

286
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,170
{\fs12}I will love you...

287
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,480
{\fs12}Iove you.

288
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,820
{\fs12}But I need to know...

289
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:16,290
{\fs12}Will you stay for all time forever...

290
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,590
{\fs12}and a day?

291
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,240
{\fs12}Then I'll give my heart...

292
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:33,110
{\fs12}till the end of our time...

293
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,980
{\fs12}forever and a day.

294
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,750
{\fs12}Today's easy.

295
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,250
{\fs12}I need you to sit there, put the fear of God in this guy.

296
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,260
{\fs12}If the judge asks you, you tell him what you told us,

297
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,790
{\fs12}and identify Darley in court.

298
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,230
{\fs12}Okay?

299
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,030
{\fs12}The minute I get your statement in, with you sitting right there...

300
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,060
{\fs12}the public defender's going to wet his pants and fold.

301
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,330
{\fs12}I'll make a deal in five minutes.

302
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,490
{\fs12}Get this guy in jail today, easy-peasy.

303
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,730
{\fs12}Deal? Wait.

304
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,530
{\fs12}Hang on, what do you mean?

305
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,500
{\fs12}What deal?

306
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,340
{\fs12}I want this guy to go away for the rest of his life.

307
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,870
{\fs12}No.

308
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,240
{\fs12}I can get you 3 to 5, guaranteed. That's a very decent result.

309
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,880
{\fs12}I'm talking guaranteed time,

310
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,910
{\fs12}not maybe, not the jury didn't feel up to it.

311
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,110
{\fs12}That's worth more than chasing some make-believe 10 to life

312
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:11,980
{\fs12}and the guy walks free.

313
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,050
{\fs12}You want that?

314
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,590
{\fs12}He killed my son.

315
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,890
{\fs12}Mr. Hume. I've got one eyewitness. You.

316
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,650
{\fs12}That's nice.

317
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,590
{\fs12}But do you know how many cases with one eyewitness

318
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,250
{\fs12}I don't even bother to try for a deal on?

319
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,260
{\fs12}The machete magically disappeared.

320
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,260
{\fs12}The only blood we could find on that weasel was his own

321
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,460
{\fs12}from when the car clipped him.

322
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,300
{\fs12}And you picked the only gas station in America

323
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,270
{\fs12}without a working surveillance camera.

324
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,440
{\fs12}We've just got your word.

325
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,200
{\fs12}That's not bad, if I can scare the guy into a deal.

326
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,710
{\fs12}You're using my son's death like some kind of card trick.

327
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,150
{\fs12}Look, I get a banger off the street a year or so,

328
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,810
{\fs12}somebody does my job for me...

329
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,220
{\fs12}he doesn't get out of there alive. Fine with me.

330
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,480
{\fs12}He finds Jesus. Fine with me.

331
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,560
{\fs12}But we get religion and go to trail,

332
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,020
{\fs12}as much as I'd love to...

333
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,590
{\fs12}and the defense starts working on.

334
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,420
{\fs12}"When was your last eye exam?"

335
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,160
{\fs12}"What do you have against inner city youth?"

336
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,460
{\fs12}And how unfair it is for them to grow up so violent...

337
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,760
{\fs12}how they're forced into initiation killings or face execution themselves.

338
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,430
{\fs12}You want ajury feeling sorry for this fucker? Huh?

339
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,230
{\fs12}You want him to walk?

340
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,340
{\fs12}Wait, you said...

341
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,170
{\fs12}initiation killing.

342
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,840
{\fs12}I thought this was a robbery.

343
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,780
{\fs12}It only looked like one.

344
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,240
{\fs12}It was an initiation.

345
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,110
{\fs12}You kill someone at random to get made in a gang.

346
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,120
{\fs12}It's the price of admission.

347
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,950
{\fs12}Are you saying that Brendan was killed...

348
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,760
{\fs12}so that some asshole could feel more like a man?

349
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,300
{\fs12}So that he could be in some club?

350
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,010
{\fs12}This is a 'take it or leave it' thing, sorry to say.

351
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,150
{\fs12}Your Honor, I'd like to enter the statement of a witness...

352
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,750
{\fs12}present at the time of the attack,

353
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,080
{\fs12}father of the victim.

354
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,850
{\fs12}We can enter that at trial, can we not, Mr. Behring?

355
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,510
{\fs12}I believe, your honor, if we enter it today...

356
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,890
{\fs12}defense will change their plea to guilty.

357
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,290
{\fs12}Save the people the time and expense of a trial.

358
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,520
{\fs12}That's the statement?

359
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,170
{\fs12}Mr. Hume?

360
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,740
{\fs12}Mr. Hume?

361
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,370
{\fs12}You're giving evidence that Mr. Darley here, before your eyes...

362
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,920
{\fs12}attacked your son and caused his death?

363
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,060
{\fs12}You're saying you will testify to that in a trial?

364
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,560
{\fs12}No, your honor, I am not.

365
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,330
{\fs12}What?

366
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,060
{\fs12}It was dark.

367
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,170
{\fs12}There were a lot of them.

368
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,930
{\fs12}I can't be sure anymore.

369
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,900
{\fs12}Mr. Behring...

370
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,810
{\fs12}do you expect to obtain evidence other than Mr. Hume's here?

371
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,280
{\fs12}No, your honor, I do not.

372
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,480
{\fs12}I'm dismissing this case.

373
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,980
{\fs12}Mr. Darley, you're released from custody.

374
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,150
{\fs12}You may return with a bailiff to the holding cells...

375
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,720
{\fs12}to retrieve your personal effects.

376
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,540
{\fs12}Joe.

377
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,480
{\fs12}You beat that shit. You beat that.

378
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,310
{\fs12}You the man.

379
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,460
{\fs12}That's it.

380
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,130
{\fs12}Come on, let's go.

381
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,500
{\fs12}You beat that rap pretty fucking good, huh? I'm proud of you.

382
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,670
{\fs12}Who's a man now?

383
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,840
{\fs12}I know.

384
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,000
{\fs12}Get in the car.

385
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,340
{\fs12}Have a nice fun time with this one here, weasel.

386
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,340
{\fs12}- Okay. - All right?

387
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,650
{\fs12}I'm proud of you.

388
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,050
{\fs12}All right?

389
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,010
{\fs12}Dad?

390
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,020
{\fs12}Dad?

391
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,450
{\fs12}What are you doing?

392
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,260
{\fs12}Nothing.

393
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,070
{\fs12}Hey, what are you doing? Don't play with that. Put it down.

394
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,540
{\fs12}So it was...

395
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,380
{\fs12}like a...

396
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,950
{\fs12}gas station.

397
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,560
{\fs12}Where Bren got killed?

398
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,390
{\fs12}Yeah, it was a gas station.

399
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,830
{\fs12}Why do you want to know?

400
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,890
{\fs12}I just...

401
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,500
{\fs12}you know, I wondered where he died.

402
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,970
{\fs12}Yeah.

403
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,840
{\fs12}It was...

404
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,610
{\fs12}a Stop-Spot in Rockside.

405
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,750
{\fs12}Do you...

406
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,090
{\fs12}Do you think he was scared?

407
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,230
{\fs12}Yeah, Luke, I do.

408
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,690
{\fs12}I think he was scared.

409
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,260
{\fs12}How did it go?

410
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,540
{\fs12}They let him go.

411
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,500
{\fs12}They did what? Why?

412
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,170
{\fs12}I don't think it was him.

413
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,810
{\fs12}Well, but you said it was him. You said they had him.

414
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,410
{\fs12}Are they going to keep looking?

415
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,950
{\fs12}Yeah, they said they would.

416
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,440
{\fs12}Oh, Jesus.

417
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,080
{\fs12}I'm sorry. What do you want me to do?

418
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,910
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

419
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,720
{\fs12}I left something at the office. I'd better go back.

420
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,360
{\fs12}Now?

421
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,160
{\fs12}- Nick. - I'll be home as soon as I can.

422
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,080
{\fs12}Oh, God, what am I doing?

423
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,600
{\fs12}Fucking piece of shit.

424
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,790
{\fs12}Fuck.

425
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,470
{\fs12}Jesus.

426
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,580
{\fs12}Fuck man. You fucking scared the shi...

427
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,710
{\fs12}Hey, wait a minute.

428
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,420
{\fs12}You fucking kidding me?

429
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,150
{\fs12}You?

430
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,310
{\fs12}Fuck.

431
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,280
{\fs12}Fuck.

432
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,220
{\fs12}Fuck.

433
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,210
{\fs12}Fuck.

434
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,810
{\fs12}Oh, God.

435
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,030
{\fs12}Oh, God.

436
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,260
{\fs12}Oh, fuck.

437
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,660
{\fs12}Oh, you know mom's perfect.

438
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,860
{\fs12}Oh, well, that's for sure.

439
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,940
{\fs12}Nah, I got nothing.

440
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,070
{\fs12}I want to be just like you, dad.

441
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,610
{\fs12}Oh, that's what I like to hear.

442
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,750
{\fs12}I've been meaning to do this for months.

443
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,610
{\fs12}It's very grown-up of you to help.

444
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,220
{\fs12}Hi, guys.

445
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,430
{\fs12}Hey.

446
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,790
{\fs12}What happened?

447
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,530
{\fs12}I slipped in the driveway.

448
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,790
{\fs12}Honey. Oh, my God. Look at you.

449
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,670
{\fs12}You're a mess.

450
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,500
{\fs12}It's okay, I cut my head. That's all.

451
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,330
{\fs12}Are you all right?

452
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,870
{\fs12}Fine, yeah. That's okay.

453
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,170
{\fs12}No, it's not okay.

454
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,440
{\fs12}I'm going to take a shower.

455
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,980
{\fs12}Okay, I'm going to get bandages. I'll bring them up.

456
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,040
{\fs12}How you doing, kid?

457
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,320
{\fs12}You okay?

458
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,820
{\fs12}I'm okay.

459
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,020
{\fs12}I guess.

460
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,360
{\fs12}Good.

461
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,960
{\fs12}That's good.

462
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,230
{\fs12}I'm going to take a shower.

463
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,670
{\fs12}Brendan Hume, you've just won MVP.

464
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:56,940
{\fs12}What do you have to say for yourself?

465
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,700
{\fs12}Can I take this already? Can I take this?

466
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,380
{\fs12}Number one...

467
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,510
{\fs12}Brendan Hume, our golden boy.

468
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,740
{\fs12}Oh, honey.

469
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,150
{\fs12}Oh, God.

470
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,020
{\fs12}- Oh, God. - Baby. It's okay.

471
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,020
{\fs12}I'm so sorry.

472
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,390
{\fs12}- Oh, God. - It's okay.

473
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,920
{\fs12}- I'm so sorry. - It's okay.

474
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,260
{\fs12}Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

475
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,510
{\fs12}Yo, Billy.

476
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,690
{\fs12}Watch the fucking pieces.

477
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,630
{\fs12}For Chris' sake, they're worth something,

478
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,960
{\fs12}unlike you.

479
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,030
{\fs12}Where you been, Nancy?

480
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,400
{\fs12}What the fuck you call that?

481
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,300
{\fs12}That's our night.

482
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,210
{\fs12}When I take pity on you and your faggot half-wit friends...

483
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,110
{\fs12}give you a couple of corners to run...

484
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,310
{\fs12}you better deliver for me...

485
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,610
{\fs12}or I'll know you been dealing, and I'll kill you.

486
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,750
{\fs12}You could be the prince of Pan-Yan...

487
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,150
{\fs12}if you fucking light-bag me,

488
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,450
{\fs12}I'll fucking kill you.

489
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,920
{\fs12}Lord knows I've been patient.

490
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,730
{\fs12}Yes.

491
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,330
{\fs12}You can get the fuck out of my sight now.

492
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,380
{\fs12}Fucking half-wit.

493
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,300
{\fs12}What?

494
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,390
{\fs12}What?

495
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,270
{\fs12}Somebody fucking tell me what the fuck is going on.

496
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,300
{\fs12}You hear?

497
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,980
{\fs12}Joe, dude.

498
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,420
{\fs12}Somebody stuck him.

499
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,880
{\fs12}He's dead.

500
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,560
{\fs12}What?

501
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,620
{\fs12}You're lying.

502
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,660
{\fs12}Man he's gone.

503
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,450
{\fs12}Hey.

504
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,120
{\fs12}How you guys faring? You getting through?

505
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,460
{\fs12}Yeah, we're okay.

506
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,430
{\fs12}You find compensations.

507
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,590
{\fs12}That's what we do, right? We compensate for our losses.

508
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,750
{\fs12}Move on.

509
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,830
{\fs12}If anything like that ever happened to me, I'd just...

510
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,190
{\fs12}I don't know, I think I'd snap.

511
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:21,940
{\fs12}Well, you really don't know what you'd do until it happens.

512
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,810
{\fs12}Surprise yourself.

513
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,140
{\fs12}Excuse me, Nick.

514
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,040
{\fs12}Detective Wallis is here to see you.

515
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,210
{\fs12}Yeah, come on in.

516
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,380
{\fs12}Hi, I'm sorry to break in on your day.

517
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,610
{\fs12}No, it's fine.

518
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,280
{\fs12}The guy we thought killed your son?

519
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,020
{\fs12}Somebody killed him.

520
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,200
{\fs12}Well, what was that?

521
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,130
{\fs12}Some kind of a gang thing or...?

522
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,130
{\fs12}We think so.

523
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,200
{\fs12}Man, I guess there is justice, huh?

524
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,470
{\fs12}Yeah, I suppose there is.

525
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,660
{\fs12}I thought you'd like to know.

526
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,030
{\fs12}If he was the guy, I mean.

527
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,850
{\fs12}Yes, well, thanks for letting me know.

528
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,250
{\fs12}All right, I'll leave you to it then.

529
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,430
{\fs12}I guess I don't need to say anything, Nick...

530
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,460
{\fs12}but you know the company would pay for counseling if you guys want it.

531
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,760
{\fs12}We'll manage.

532
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,800
{\fs12}Thanks, Owen.

533
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,030
{\fs12}Okay.

534
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,770
{\fs12}He didn't deserve that. No way he deserved that.

535
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,910
{\fs12}He was a true fucking soldier.

536
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,280
{\fs12}To Joe.

537
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,820
{\fs12}He was a good fucking boy.

538
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,820
{\fs12}A good fucking boy.

539
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,190
{\fs12}So that's what we're going to do?

540
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,560
{\fs12}Why don't you show a little fucking respect at least?

541
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,920
{\fs12}See, that's why you guys are nothing.

542
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,960
{\fs12}That's why you're bunch of fucking punks...

543
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,430
{\fs12}because you would rather drink up

544
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,800
{\fs12}and toke yourself fucking witless.

545
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,900
{\fs12}Witless and scared shitless.

546
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,440
{\fs12}My bad.

547
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,070
{\fs12}Let's... here, cheers.

548
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,450
{\fs12}Get your fucking glasses up.

549
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,670
{\fs12}All of you.

550
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,690
{\fs12}Joe just wasn't made for this shit. That's all.

551
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,390
{\fs12}He wasn't like us.

552
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,230
{\fs12}No, wasn't like you, you mean.

553
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,500
{\fs12}He was not like you.

554
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,000
{\fs12}He was better than you.

555
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,710
{\fs12}We as good as brothers since we was kids,

556
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,710
{\fs12}and you fucking go this way?

557
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,570
{\fs12}What. I am not as good as you now?

558
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,010
{\fs12}Joe was like blood to me, dog.

559
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,420
{\fs12}As good as fucking blood. You, too.

560
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,100
{\fs12}Well.

561
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,930
{\fs12}I would like to catch the motherfucker that did this.

562
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,730
{\fs12}Oh, we will.

563
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,110
{\fs12}Ain't no motherfucking doubt.

564
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,180
{\fs12}Do the right fucking thing for Joe, yeah?

565
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,950
{\fs12}So who fucking did it?

566
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,580
{\fs12}It wasn't the Cutty Macks, man. I would know about it.

567
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,950
{\fs12}Unless you were high.

568
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,180
{\fs12}I'm not high.

569
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,750
{\fs12}Well, it wasn't B-street, Billy.

570
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,120
{\fs12}Wasn't the Hall. Wasn't any of those assholes.

571
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,750
{\fs12}Yo, my sister said she saw some fucker in a suit down there.

572
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,420
{\fs12}Just chilling.

573
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,230
{\fs12}How many 'fuckers in a suit' you ever see at Stokely fucking Hall?

574
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,810
{\fs12}See, here's a comical thing.

575
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,740
{\fs12}When one of us gets killed, we don't make the paper.

576
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:50,380
{\fs12}But the son of a senior VP of Starfish Capital...

577
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,760
{\fs12}Go talk to your sister.

578
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,580
{\fs12}Hey, Amy, what's up?

579
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,020
{\fs12}I'm going home.

580
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,450
{\fs12}You okay? You need anything?

581
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,380
{\fs12}No, I'm fine.

582
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,360
{\fs12}I'm just going to finish this risk analysis and then...

583
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,130
{\fs12}Actually, could you drop this off with Owen, please

584
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,360
{\fs12}on your way out?

585
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,090
{\fs12}- Sure. - Thank you. Good night.

586
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,020
{\fs12}Wait, dude.

587
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,980
{\fs12}Get his ass. Come on.

588
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,470
{\fs12}Come on.

589
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,670
{\fs12}Get him...

590
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,690
{\fs12}Where's he at?

591
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,420
{\fs12}Go...

592
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,170
{\fs12}Go...

593
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,240
{\fs12}Go...

594
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,550
{\fs12}Go...

595
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,500
{\fs12}Come on.

596
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,950
{\fs12}Hey, which way is 1801?

597
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,620
{\fs12}1801 Main, which way?

598
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,960
{\fs12}Through the boiler room, there.

599
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,140
{\fs12}Where the fuck did he go?

600
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,540
{\fs12}Heco, Dog, Spink, go cut him off.

601
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,700
{\fs12}Kill him.

602
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,960
{\fs12}Go.

603
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,230
{\fs12}Go.

604
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,170
{\fs12}Go.

605
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:40,970
{\fs12}Go.

606
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:45,910
{\fs12}Where is he at?

607
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,450
{\fs12}Oh, God. Okay.

608
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,380
{\fs12}Oh, shit.

609
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,880
{\fs12}Did you talk to Sally?

610
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,120
{\fs12}Yeah.

611
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,920
{\fs12}Move your ass, let's go.

612
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,820
{\fs12}Tommy, go.

613
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,590
{\fs12}Jamie, get your Willie Nelson ass up there.

614
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,030
{\fs12}You ain't going to make a fool out of me, motherfucker.

615
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,160
{\fs12}Fuck.

616
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,640
{\fs12}Billy, we got to go, man.

617
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,940
{\fs12}Billy, we got to get the fuck out of here. Come on.

618
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,480
{\fs12}Go. Come on.

619
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,140
{\fs12}Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus.

620
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,220
{\fs12}Hi honey, I'm sorry I'm late.

621
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:46,860
{\fs12}What?

622
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:48,430
{\fs12}Wait, what do you mean? You can't find him?

623
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,660
{\fs12}Where the hell is he?

624
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,040
{\fs12}Well, did you call his friends?

625
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,670
{\fs12}Oh, Jesus. Honey.

626
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,040
{\fs12}Look, I got to call you back.

627
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,610
{\fs12}I think I know where he is.

628
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,420
{\fs12}All right.

629
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,960
{\fs12}Get whatever prints you can from this stuff. Let me know.

630
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,100
{\fs12}Look, I need you to start a canvas, all right?

631
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,930
{\fs12}Pull people from the street if you have to.

632
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,500
{\fs12}Someone had to see something.

633
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,350
{\fs12}Luke.

634
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,150
{\fs12}Luke, what the hell are you doing?

635
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,220
{\fs12}Your mother's worried sick. Now get in the car.

636
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:53,160
{\fs12}No.

637
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,700
{\fs12}I said, get in the car.

638
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,700
{\fs12}No, I don't want to get in the car.

639
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,000
{\fs12}I said get in the car.

640
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,040
{\fs12}Fuck you.

641
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,230
{\fs12}Lucas.

642
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,410
{\fs12}This is not a safe place.

643
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,480
{\fs12}Yeah, I know that much, don't I?

644
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:13,750
{\fs12}Would it have been better if it was me?

645
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:16,350
{\fs12}Is that what it is?

646
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,230
{\fs12}You guys could have handled that a lot easier

647
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,260
{\fs12}than losing Bren the golden boy.

648
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,430
{\fs12}Luke...

649
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,770
{\fs12}Please get in the car.

650
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,340
{\fs12}Come on.

651
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,310
{\fs12}Luke, get in that goddamn car right now.

652
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,140
{\fs12}Right now.

653
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,490
{\fs12}Oh, God.

654
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,930
{\fs12}Oh, baby. Honey.

655
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,660
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

656
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,890
{\fs12}Don't ever do that again, okay?

657
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,560
{\fs12}Yo, we're going to do this?

658
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,660
{\fs12}You need to sign in.

659
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,930
{\fs12}Sir, you need to sign in.

660
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,500
{\fs12}Messengers drop-off over there.

661
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,200
{\fs12}No, I need to hand deliver this,

662
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,770
{\fs12}to Nicholas Hume.

663
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,940
{\fs12}You can sign in and drop it off like everyone else.

664
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,950
{\fs12}Call upstairs.

665
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,350
{\fs12}Shit.

666
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,760
{\fs12}Nicholas Hume.

667
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,830
{\fs12}Move.

668
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,370
{\fs12}Nicholas Hume.

669
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,170
{\fs12}Nicholas Hume.

670
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,220
{\fs12}Nice office, motherfucker.

671
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,810
{\fs12}What the hell do you want?

672
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,380
{\fs12}That's the gift of freedom, baby.

673
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,390
{\fs12}Sir, should we escort this person out?

674
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,650
{\fs12}Sir?

675
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,890
{\fs12}Free from wondering how you're going to die now.

676
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,290
{\fs12}You're free from wondering if you're going to die alone, you hear?

677
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,160
{\fs12}Get him out of here.

678
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,160
{\fs12}Because you'll get joy and grace all over

679
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,340
{\fs12}when you finally meet your maker.

680
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,340
{\fs12}Get off me!

681
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,730
{\fs12}Where are you, you bastard?

682
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:59,000
{\fs12}You want to send me a reward for finding that wallet of yours?

683
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:00,660
{\fs12}Tell me where the fuck you are, right now.

684
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,970
{\fs12}No, I'll tell you where the fuck you are.

685
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,010
{\fs12}You're in my end of the fucking sewer, buddy.

686
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,940
{\fs12}I say who lives. I say who dies.

687
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,110
{\fs12}Now, you better get that through your fucking skull,

688
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,870
{\fs12}because there's no more warnings.

689
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,550
{\fs12}I'm coming for some fucking family time.

690
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,850
{\fs12}No. You listen to me.

691
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,260
{\fs12}You go near my family...

692
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,090
{\fs12}and I will cut out your goddamn guts

693
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,630
{\fs12}like I did your fucking friend, you hear me?

694
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,230
{\fs12}He wasn't my friend.

695
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,370
{\fs12}He was my brother.

696
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,100
{\fs12}And now I'm coming for the rest of your family.

697
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,540
{\fs12}You just bought them a death sentence, motherfucker.

698
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:39,470
{\fs12}Wait.

699
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:40,870
{\fs12}Don't.

700
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,180
{\fs12}Fuck...

701
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:04,760
{\fs12}Nick, what's going on?

702
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,930
{\fs12}Pick up...

703
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:12,640
{\fs12}Nick?

704
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,870
{\fs12}Honey, are you okay?

705
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,270
{\fs12}Is Luke home from school?

706
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:16,910
{\fs12}Yes, we're fine.

707
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,680
{\fs12}All right, just stay there till the police come.

708
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,350
{\fs12}Promise me.

709
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,710
{\fs12}Why, what's wrong?

710
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,720
{\fs12}Honey, just stay there till the police get there.

711
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,080
{\fs12}I'm on my way.

712
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,090
{\fs12}Oh, come on...

713
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,430
{\fs12}Hey, can I have Detective Wallis, please?

714
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,570
{\fs12}Detective Wallis

715
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,430
{\fs12}Give me Detective Wallis, right now.

716
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:41,830
{\fs12}Shit.

717
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,030
{\fs12}Homicide, this is Wallis.

718
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,440
{\fs12}They threatened my family.

719
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:45,640
{\fs12}Mr. Hume?

720
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:47,900
{\fs12}Fucking trash...

721
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:49,750
{\fs12}threatened to kill my family.

722
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,950
{\fs12}All right, where is your family right now?

723
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:53,110
{\fs12}They're at home.

724
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,250
{\fs12}They're both at home.

725
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:56,490
{\fs12}Just help us, please.

726
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,230
{\fs12}Helen? Luke?

727
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:16,540
{\fs12}Nick?

728
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:20,740
{\fs12}God.

729
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,970
{\fs12}What the hell is happening?

730
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,310
{\fs12}Honey, why the police...?

731
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,810
{\fs12}Nick, you're scaring me.

732
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,720
{\fs12}Oh! God.

733
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:33,650
{\fs12}Nick, talk to me.

734
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,880
{\fs12}Dad, what's going on?

735
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,660
{\fs12}Nick.

736
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,060
{\fs12}what's going on?

737
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:45,960
{\fs12}You stay there.

738
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,240
{\fs12}Thank God you're here.

739
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,680
{\fs12}Your son was a hockey player.

740
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,190
{\fs12}Yes.

741
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,020
{\fs12}The car will stay here tonight.

742
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,360
{\fs12}Now, Mr. Hume, I think it's time you told me...

743
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,590
{\fs12}exactly who did what to whom?

744
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:19,170
{\fs12}You make war on the wrong dog, hm?

745
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,500
{\fs12}That what you did?

746
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,400
{\fs12}Thought you could just go kill some little asshole

747
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,270
{\fs12}because you live all the way out here?

748
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,310
{\fs12}What are you saying?

749
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,010
{\fs12}What is she saying, Nick?

750
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,170
{\fs12}I've done nothing wrong.

751
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,380
{\fs12}Well, then, why don't you tell me how you make

752
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,780
{\fs12}Billy Darley this pissed off at you?

753
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,690
{\fs12}You asked for my help.

754
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,600
{\fs12}All right.

755
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,440
{\fs12}All right.

756
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,780
{\fs12}Just try to get through tonight, Mr. Hume.

757
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:03,780
{\fs12}And be grateful you're still alive.

758
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,010
{\fs12}But if you started a war...

759
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,250
{\fs12}God help you.

760
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,490
{\fs12}What have you done?

761
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:28,230
{\fs12}How do I make it stop?

762
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:30,700
{\fs12}Did you start it?

763
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:36,350
{\fs12}Listen...

764
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,940
{\fs12}I don't really care what happens to me.

765
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,680
{\fs12}I just need them to be safe.

766
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,050
{\fs12}Tell me how to stop this?

767
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,520
{\fs12}Well, first of all, do everything they tell you.

768
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,590
{\fs12}Everything.

769
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,590
{\fs12}Don't worry, Mr. Hume.

770
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,740
{\fs12}We've put out an APB for Billy and his gang.

771
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,290
{\fs12}I can't believe I didn't see what was going on with you.

772
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,860
{\fs12}How could you do what you did?

773
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,300
{\fs12}You thought you could balance the equation?

774
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,070
{\fs12}Put order in the universe?

775
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,570
{\fs12}I lost my boy.

776
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,510
{\fs12}Your boy.

777
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,920
{\fs12}You are a good father.

778
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,660
{\fs12}And nothing that's happened changes that.

779
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:01,900
{\fs12}And I love you.

780
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,530
{\fs12}And I always will.

781
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,400
{\fs12}It's good that you're getting rid of it anyway.

782
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,820
{\fs12}Yeah.

783
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,470
{\fs12}No.

784
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,610
{\fs12}Mom.

785
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,590
{\fs12}Fucking get out.

786
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:44,650
{\fs12}Mom.

787
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:47,730
{\fs12}Get over here.

788
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:48,870
{\fs12}Get over here.

789
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:50,840
{\fs12}Sup, Billy.

790
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:08,850
{\fs12}No.

791
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,350
{\fs12}No.

792
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,450
{\fs12}No.

793
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,960
{\fs12}Tonight I lack the strengthen to even move.

794
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:54,660
{\fs12}And you walked and watched me die.

795
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:01,070
{\fs12}But I know this is harder for you.

796
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:07,840
{\fs12}Because love has beat you down.

797
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,270
{\fs12}Yeah, come on.

798
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,160
{\fs12}You know you're not alone.

799
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,170
{\fs12}Doctor.

800
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,240
{\fs12}Doctor.

801
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:41,970
{\fs12}Hold the legs.

802
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:44,080
{\fs12}Sedate him.

803
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:45,640
{\fs12}Hold him down.

804
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,380
{\fs12}Can you turn that off?

805
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,150
{\fs12}The monitor or your heart?

806
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,550
{\fs12}I'll ask the doctor.

807
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,190
{\fs12}This thing stops. Right now.

808
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,600
{\fs12}God knows why you're still alive,

809
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,900
{\fs12}but you're being given a second chance.

810
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,500
{\fs12}You think that officer's out there protecting you?

811
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,040
{\fs12}He's protecting you from yourself?

812
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,850
{\fs12}He'll haul your ass right tojail if I say so.

813
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,740
{\fs12}You want your retribution,

814
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,440
{\fs12}and you killed a couple of punks, and it bought you what?

815
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,120
{\fs12}Everybody thinks they're right in a war.

816
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,550
{\fs12}Everybody still dies in the end.

817
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,090
{\fs12}You were never going to win this, Mr. Hume.

818
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,320
{\fs12}Nobody is.

819
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:09,860
{\fs12}I killed them.

820
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,460
{\fs12}I killed my family.

821
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:18,210
{\fs12}Well, your son's still alive.

822
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,080
{\fs12}What?

823
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,210
{\fs12}Barely.

824
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:23,400
{\fs12}Where is he?

825
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,880
{\fs12}Is he here? Where is he?

826
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,580
{\fs12}Hey, come on. Wait a second now.

827
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,480
{\fs12}Luke.

828
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:29,820
{\fs12}Luke.

829
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:31,480
{\fs12}Luke?

830
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:32,710
{\fs12}- He's alright. Let him go. - Lucas?

831
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:34,650
{\fs12}- Sir, you need to get back to bed. - Where is my son?

832
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,690
{\fs12}Tell me where my son is.

833
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,620
{\fs12}He's in room 206.

834
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,790
{\fs12}Lukey?

835
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:39,620
{\fs12}Luke?

836
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,030
{\fs12}We're taking care of your son.

837
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,760
{\fs12}- Doctor... It's ok. Just let him through. - Luke?

838
01:10:58,450 --> 01:10:59,750
{\fs12}Is he going to wake up?

839
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:01,980
{\fs12}I can't say right now.

840
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,520
{\fs12}It was never going to balance.

841
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,260
{\fs12}What did you say?

842
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:18,930
{\fs12}The equation.

843
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,470
{\fs12}Sometimes it's just chaos.

844
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,510
{\fs12}That's all there is.

845
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,210
{\fs12}I'd like a minute with him.

846
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,480
{\fs12}Please.

847
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:49,960
{\fs12}I'll be waiting.

848
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,610
{\fs12}Hey, Luke, can you hear me?

849
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,480
{\fs12}Can you move your fingers?

850
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:09,480
{\fs12}Son, just move your fingers if you can hear me.

851
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,390
{\fs12}Luke, I know that

852
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,530
{\fs12}you think that...

853
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,600
{\fs12}I didn't care about you as much as your brother.

854
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,770
{\fs12}God, I...

855
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:29,840
{\fs12}I don't know, maybe I didn't at first.

856
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,530
{\fs12}You know...

857
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,750
{\fs12}when you mom and I

858
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,650
{\fs12}first had Brendan...

859
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,210
{\fs12}he was just...

860
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,850
{\fs12}he was so amazing to me, you know.

861
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:47,720
{\fs12}He was like this miracle kid.

862
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:51,220
{\fs12}But I always knew exactly what to expect with him.

863
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:54,260
{\fs12}And then when you came along...

864
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:57,470
{\fs12}I don't know, I kind of expected to

865
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:00,370
{\fs12}have another Brendan, you know.

866
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:01,900
{\fs12}I expected you to be just like him,

867
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,130
{\fs12}but you weren't.

868
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:04,940
{\fs12}I mean you were so different,

869
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:06,980
{\fs12}just different than him, different than me.

870
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,810
{\fs12}You were just so much more...

871
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,940
{\fs12}so much more like your mom, you know...

872
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,110
{\fs12}stubborn and...

873
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,390
{\fs12}Too much passion.

874
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,350
{\fs12}Your mother.

875
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:29,260
{\fs12}Oh, she meant the world to me.

876
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:33,070
{\fs12}And so do you.

877
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,400
{\fs12}I just want you to know that I love you.

878
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:41,970
{\fs12}I love you so much.

879
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,510
{\fs12}I love your brother and I love your mother...

880
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,810
{\fs12}I love our family

881
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,380
{\fs12}and I...

882
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:59,730
{\fs12}I'm so sorry

883
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:02,570
{\fs12}that I wasn't a better father.

884
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:07,670
{\fs12}I'm so sorry

885
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,130
{\fs12}that I couldn't protect you guys.

886
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,660
{\fs12}Shit.

887
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,690
{\fs12}Hey you, get a doctor, right now.

888
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,410
{\fs12}Hey, Owen.

889
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:58,210
{\fs12}I need you to check a number for me.

890
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:02,020
{\fs12}Yeah, 5550128.

891
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:04,720
{\fs12}Well, check somewhere else. Just get it for me.

892
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:07,390
{\fs12}And the savings too, huh?

893
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,360
{\fs12}Yeah, everything.

894
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:09,360
{\fs12}All of it.

895
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,320
{\fs12}Pulling out the kids' college fund, huh?

896
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:45,750
{\fs12}Hello?

897
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:46,990
{\fs12}Hey, Nick, it's Owen.

898
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,360
{\fs12}Yeah, I got that number run.

899
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:50,760
{\fs12}It's a bar. 'The Four Roses.'

900
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,660
{\fs12}Nick, what's going on?

901
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,670
{\fs12}Do you need me to call anyone?

902
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,100
{\fs12}Thanks. Goodbye. Owen.

903
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:55,140
{\fs12}Nick?

904
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:16,590
{\fs12}I'm looking for Billy Darley or any of his friends.

905
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:22,130
{\fs12}"IN SPANISH"

906
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,780
{\fs12}"IN SPANISH"

907
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:57,230
{\fs12}Fuck you.

908
01:17:59,240 --> 01:17:59,640
{\fs12}Fuck you.

909
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,400
{\fs12}Fuck you. Back it up.

910
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:05,040
{\fs12}Let me go...

911
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,540
{\fs12}You tell me where Billy Darley is.

912
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:09,000
{\fs12}Tell me right now.

913
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,200
{\fs12}Right now.

914
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:12,540
{\fs12}You don't want Billy Darley, buddy.

915
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:16,380
{\fs12}I got business with him.

916
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:18,750
{\fs12}Okay, let me go.

917
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,850
{\fs12}Let me go.

918
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:23,060
{\fs12}"IN SPANISH"

919
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:29,500
{\fs12}His boy Heco is crashing at 113, up the block.

920
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:32,700
{\fs12}He's usually hooking up around dinner time, you know?

921
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,330
{\fs12}Okay?

922
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,040
{\fs12}"IN SPANISH"

923
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:39,830
{\fs12}One more thing.

924
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:43,240
{\fs12}I need to buy some guns.

925
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,950
{\fs12}Help you?

926
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,890
{\fs12}I need guns.

927
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:12,900
{\fs12}I don't know you.

928
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,210
{\fs12}I came from the 'Four Roses.'

929
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,610
{\fs12}I'm going to guess

930
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,620
{\fs12}you're a little bit far from home.

931
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:31,130
{\fs12}Well, don't let me smell fear on you.

932
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,830
{\fs12}Fear is for the enemy.

933
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,320
{\fs12}Fear

934
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,430
{\fs12}and bullets.

935
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,840
{\fs12}Lots of fucking bullets.

936
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,670
{\fs12}You got the bastard of bastards.

937
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,470
{\fs12}.357...

938
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,550
{\fs12}for guaranteed head removal.

939
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,650
{\fs12}That's a sweetie.

940
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:01,950
{\fs12}You got your standard size.45,

941
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:04,320
{\fs12}super size.

942
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:07,600
{\fs12}That's a fucking 'Hungry Man' right there.

943
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,260
{\fs12}And you got the king of mayhem.

944
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,770
{\fs12}Half cannon, sword ofjustice.

945
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:16,070
{\fs12}Take this fucker to the Holy Land,

946
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,000
{\fs12}start your own crusade.

947
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,980
{\fs12}Any one of these...

948
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,010
{\fs12}is bound to make you feel better

949
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:23,940
{\fs12}about what's bothering you.

950
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:53,500
{\fs12}What about that one?

951
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,570
{\fs12}This one?

952
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,000
{\fs12}All right, I'll take this and these.

953
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:17,560
{\fs12}That's three fucking grand worth of killing.

954
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,860
{\fs12}You got three grand worth of killing to do?

955
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,800
{\fs12}There's five.

956
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,780
{\fs12}Well, that makes you a preferred customer.

957
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:35,340
{\fs12}I'm going to give you some accessories.

958
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:38,080
{\fs12}Just because you got a thing about you.

959
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,250
{\fs12}You have got a killing thing about you...

960
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,760
{\fs12}you surely do.

961
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:06,350
{\fs12}You the motherfucker after my son Billy?

962
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,390
{\fs12}He's your son?

963
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,550
{\fs12}That'd make you the motherfucker killed Joe, that right?

964
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:20,320
{\fs12}You killed my youngest?

965
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,360
{\fs12}Now you're after Billy, yeah?

966
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,770
{\fs12}Yeah, I'm after him.

967
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:33,640
{\fs12}Well, Billy is no damn doing of mine.

968
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,880
{\fs12}Anything he did is no damn doing of mine.

969
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:43,280
{\fs12}So somebody needs to make somebody pay for something

970
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:45,390
{\fs12}to make themselves feel better...

971
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:48,350
{\fs12}Billy'd be the one to pay.

972
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,750
{\fs12}Kill the little piss-pants.

973
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,690
{\fs12}See if it makes a damn day's difference to me.

974
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:56,300
{\fs12}Dad to dad,

975
01:22:57,230 --> 01:22:58,570
{\fs12}don't tell me about it.

976
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,070
{\fs12}Just go do it.

977
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,300
{\fs12}Lord knows I've been patient.

978
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:07,070
{\fs12}And you're a cash fucking customer.

979
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,020
{\fs12}But you think about asking me where Billy is.

980
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,080
{\fs12}I'll kill you.

981
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:20,820
{\fs12}Go your way, now.

982
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:25,230
{\fs12}Go with God...

983
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,430
{\fs12}and a bag full of guns.

984
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:17,120
{\fs12}Going to focus on the pain.

985
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,490
{\fs12}The...

986
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:23,800
{\fs12}What the fuck?

987
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,000
{\fs12}What the fuck? Who the fuck?

988
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:28,910
{\fs12}You?

989
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:31,260
{\fs12}We fucking killed you.

990
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:32,700
{\fs12}What the fuck?

991
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,740
{\fs12}Get the fuck out of here.

992
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,350
{\fs12}Where is Billy?

993
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:45,150
{\fs12}Fuck you.

994
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,060
{\fs12}That's my tooth, you asshole.

995
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,690
{\fs12}Tell me where the fuck he is.

996
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:52,920
{\fs12}The office.

997
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:54,030
{\fs12}The office.

998
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,390
{\fs12}What the fuck is that?

999
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,500
{\fs12}It's the abandoned mental hospital.

1000
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,400
{\fs12}It's where we cook our shit, dude.

1001
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,930
{\fs12}It's by the bridge on Stygian Street.

1002
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,140
{\fs12}All right, man? Stygian Street.

1003
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:10,250
{\fs12}Call him.

1004
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,920
{\fs12}Good thing your daddy got you some training wheels...

1005
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,050
{\fs12}so you don't have to Rollerblade over here for your fucking sister's habit, huh?

1006
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:18,180
{\fs12}She's been a good customer of mine for a while.

1007
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,380
{\fs12}I been a pretty great customer of hers too.

1008
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:26,320
{\fs12}Fucking prick.

1009
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,830
{\fs12}Heco, you sandbagging son of a bitch...

1012
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,100
{\fs12}That fucker didn't die, Billy.

1013
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,700
{\fs12}That fucker didn't die, Billy.

1014
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:45,680
{\fs12}What the fuck are you talking about?

1015
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:48,850
{\fs12}He says you're sentenced.

1016
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:56,850
{\fs12}So what?

1017
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,590
{\fs12}So this, motherfucker.

1018
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,850
{\fs12}What are we fucking up tonight, son?

1019
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,220
{\fs12}What the fuck do you want now?

1020
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:30,380
{\fs12}You look like you're in a fucking hurry.

1021
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:33,390
{\fs12}You know how much I got to wipe your fucking nose?

1022
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,560
{\fs12}I got to get some Fortune Five Hundred faggot off my back...

1023
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:39,700
{\fs12}by telling him he can fucking have you, you think I enjoyed that?

1024
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,930
{\fs12}What you don't get is...

1025
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,000
{\fs12}I care about what happens to you

1026
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:47,180
{\fs12}because it can fucking hurt me.

1027
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:49,870
{\fs12}Now do you need any more fucking instructions?

1028
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:56,080
{\fs12}No. Thanks, dad.

1029

{\fs12}I'm gonna kill you. Son of the bitch.

1039
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,570
{\fs12}Go get him. Go...

1040
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,590
{\fs12}Come on...

1041
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,130
{\fs12}...Go that way...

1042
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,780
{\fs12}You know you're going to die in here.

1043
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:49,770
{\fs12}Fuck.

1044
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:59,660
{\fs12}Look at you.

1045
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:03,970
{\fs12}You look like one of us.

1046
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:10,970
{\fs12}Look what I made you.

1047
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:46,400
{\fs12}Ready?

1048
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:55,120
{\fs12}Tonight I lack the strengthen to even move.

1049
01:38:56,630 --> 01:39:00,930
{\fs12}And you walked and watched me die.

1050
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:07,330
{\fs12}But I know this is harder for you.

1051
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:13,770
{\fs12}Because love has beat you down.

1052
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,870
{\fs12}Yeah, come on.

1053
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:30,460
{\fs12}You know you're not alone.

1054
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:39,840
{\fs12}Any New Year's resolutions?

1055
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:42,260
{\fs12}No, you know mom's perfect.

1056
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:43,460
{\fs12}Oh, well, that's for sure.

1057
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:44,730
{\fs12}Nah, I got nothing.

1058
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:50,680
{\fs12}Five, four, three, two, one.

1059
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:52,210
{\fs12}Happy New Year.

1060
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,780
{\fs12}Happy New Year.

1061
01:39:54,650 --> 01:39:56,480
{\fs12}All right, what do you expect this year?

1062
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:58,310
{\fs12}Your son.

1063
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:01,290
{\fs12}He started moving.

1064
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:04,760
{\fs12}I think he's going to pull through.

1065
01:40:15,070 --> 01:40:17,870
{\fs12}Should old acquaintance be forgot.

1066
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:22,810
{\fs12}And never brought to mind.

1067
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,770


1068
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,630


1069
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,270
  

1070
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,800


1071
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,200
