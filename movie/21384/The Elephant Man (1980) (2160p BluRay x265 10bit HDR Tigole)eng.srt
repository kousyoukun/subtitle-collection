1
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:41,533
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

2
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:34,108
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

3
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,908
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

4
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:32,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

5
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:36,975
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Darling, don't be difficult. Let's take our sweet...

6
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,350
{\1c&H00FFFF&}lovely children on an outing.

7
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:55,392
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't do this. I know my rights.

8
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:58,100
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I have the authority to close
you down, and I'm doing just that.

9
00:05:58,142 --> 00:06:02,683
{\1c&H00FFFF&}This exhibit degrades everybody
who sees it and the creature himself.

10
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:06,017
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He is a freak! How else will he live?

11
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,350
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Freaks are one thing. This is entirely different.

12
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:12,767
{\1c&H00FFFF&}This is monstrous and should not be allowed.

13
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:16,433
{\1c&H00FFFF&}These officers will see to it
you're on your way soon. Good day!

14
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:21,308
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Move along please.

15
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:25,975
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Hold it there, sir.

16
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:28,100
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come this way.

17
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,683
{\1c&H00FFFF&}On the move again...

18
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:48,183
{\1c&H00FFFF&}my treasure.

19
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:28,767
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We'll be seeing a lot more of these machine accidents...

20
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,600
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Mr. Hodges.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,183
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Abominable things, these machines.
You can't reason with them.

22
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,267
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What a mess!

23
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:48,642
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Pull on the rope.

24
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,600
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Irons, please.

25
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:06,933
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Who is it?

26
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:11,433
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

27
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:15,433
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- I found it.
- Good. Did you see it?

28
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:21,975
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right. I'll see you in a moment. Thank you.

29
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:27,058
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Who's that?

30
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:30,517
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- A friend of mine.
- Oh, yes.

31
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,933
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

32
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:36,142
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, Freddie!

33
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,600
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Nothing of any importance.

34
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:35,975
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Can you tell me where Cleeves Street is?

35
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:39,475
{\1c&H00FFFF&}'Round back, to the left,
then to the right. Straight through.

36
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:40,975
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

37
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,183
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you the proprietor?

38
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:03,850
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And who might you be, sir?

39
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:06,891
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.

40
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:13,100
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't think so. No, sir, we're...

41
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,391
{\1c&H00FFFF&}closed.

42
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,391
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, I'd pay handsomely for a private showing.

43
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:21,391
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you the proprietor?

44
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:23,433
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Handsomely? Who sent you?

45
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,141
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind.

46
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:32,850
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm the owner.

47
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:55,516
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Life...

48
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:01,266
{\1c&H00FFFF&}is full of surprises.

49
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:08,474
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Consider the fate...

50
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:11,349
{\1c&H00FFFF&}of this creature's poor mother...

51
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,641
{\1c&H00FFFF&}struck down...

52
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:18,766
{\1c&H00FFFF&}in the fourth month of her maternal condition...

53
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:22,266
{\1c&H00FFFF&}by an elephant, a wild elephant.

54
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:24,266
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Struck down...

55
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:30,058
{\1c&H00FFFF&}on an uncharted African isle.

56
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:32,808
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The result...

57
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:36,849
{\1c&H00FFFF&}is plain to see.

58
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:41,349
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Ladies and gentlemen...

59
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,724
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the terrible...

60
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:49,474
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Elephant Man!

61
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:06,099
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Stand up.
- Stand up!

62
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:14,099
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Turn around.

63
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:16,933
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Turn around! Turn around!

64
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:00,974
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes...

65
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:03,849
{\1c&H00FFFF&}you'll bring him to me
tomorrow morning at 10:00, Mr... .

66
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,724
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Bytes.

67
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:08,224
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He'll be there.

68
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,724
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good.

69
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:15,683
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Here's my card, and I'll send a cab.

70
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,224
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right?

71
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:19,766
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We have a deal.

72
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:24,599
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We understand each other.

73
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:29,183
{\1c&H00FFFF&}More than money has changed hands.

74
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:32,433
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We understand each other completely, my friend.

75
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,808
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, well, thank you, Mr. Bytes.

76
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:37,766
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Tomorrow.

77
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,891
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Cor! What a stink!

78
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,641
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm looking for Mr. Frederick Treves...

79
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:22,599
{\1c&H00FFFF&}please, ma'am.

80
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,891
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Very well. I'll-I'll send for him.

81
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:31,099
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Nurse... Oh, Mr. Treves, sir, this...

82
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:33,766
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- This...
- Yes. Thank you.

83
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,849
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I was expecting him.

84
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:39,682
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yes, are you the cab driver?
- Yes, sir.

85
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:43,307
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Anyone else with you?
- No, sir. Just this gentleman.

86
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:45,891
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Thank you for your troubles.
- Not at all, sir.

87
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:47,432
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My pleasure.

88
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:49,932
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

89
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,724
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Will you come this way, please?

90
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:58,516
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Mothershead, I'll be in my room,
and I'm not to be disturbed.

91
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:01,182
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- All right?
- Of course, sir.

92
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:07,266
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Will you come with me, please?

93
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:11,224
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You heard what the doctor said!

94
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:18,766
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Go on.

95
00:17:57,682 --> 00:17:59,641
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My name is Frederick Treves...

96
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:02,891
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and I'm a surgeon here at the London Hospital.

97
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:04,391
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And...

98
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:10,266
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I lecture in anatomy at the medical college.

99
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:17,891
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'd like very much to examine you so that...

100
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,599
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Would that be all right?

101
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:25,432
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.

102
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,266
{\1c&H00FFFF&}First I'd like to ask you a few questions.

103
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,516
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Would that be all right?

104
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:40,599
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Your owner tells me... I mean
the man who looks after you tells me...

105
00:18:40,682 --> 00:18:45,599
{\1c&H00FFFF&}that you're English and your name is John Merrick.

106
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:49,766
{\1c&H00FFFF&}John Merrick. Is that right?

107
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,682
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I tell you what. I think I'll ask you a question...

108
00:18:57,766 --> 00:19:01,182
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and you shake your head like this for "no."

109
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:06,224
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you always been the way you are now?

110
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:10,099
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you in any pain?

111
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,349
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Are your parents still alive?

112
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:17,766
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you understand me?

113
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:21,141
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Your father and your mother, are they dead?

114
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:24,891
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Freddie, what are you doing for...

115
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:29,099
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry. I had no idea you had...

116
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:33,182
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Freddie, what the hell have you got in there?

117
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:35,599
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You'll know soon enough, at the meeting of the Society.

118
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,515
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Until then, I beg of you not a word to anyone, please.

119
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,890
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, if you insist. But you must have quite a find in there.

120
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:45,640
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- I don't know what I've got.
- Nothing of any importance, eh?

121
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:50,265
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Not a word, please, Fox. Not a word.

122
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:54,974
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.

123
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:00,390
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

124
00:20:31,224 --> 00:20:32,807
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's all right.

125
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:47,265
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I think I'll examine you now.

126
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,640
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll leave the questions till later.

127
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:53,182
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right?

128
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:57,432
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Will you take your hat off now, please?

129
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,932
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't be frightened.

130
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:03,390
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I simply want to look at you.

131
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:07,974
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Take your hat off. Don't be frightened.

132
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,557
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

133
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,140
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good afternoon.

134
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:25,140
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers.

135
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,974
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Pull the curtains aside.

136
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,682
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He is English...

137
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:45,932
{\1c&H00FFFF&}he is 21 years of age...

138
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:48,432
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and his name is John Merrick.

139
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:53,057
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Gentlemen, in the course of my profession I have come upon...

140
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,349
{\1c&H00FFFF&}many lamentable deformities of
the face due to injury or disease...

141
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:58,890
{\1c&H00FFFF&}as well as mutilations...

142
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:02,390
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and contortions of the body depending upon like causes.

143
00:22:02,474 --> 00:22:04,640
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But at no time have I met with such...

144
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:07,599
{\1c&H00FFFF&}a perverted or degraded version of a human being as this man.

145
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,765
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I draw your attention to the
insidious conditions affecting him.

146
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:14,224
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Can you see over there?
- Yes.

147
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:17,515
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull...

148
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,099
{\1c&H00FFFF&}right upper limb, which is totally useless...

149
00:22:21,182 --> 00:22:23,682
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the alarming curvature of the spine.

150
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:26,932
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Would you turn around, please?
- Turn around, please.

151
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,974
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The looseness of the skin...

152
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:37,557
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90% of the body.

153
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,099
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And there is every indication that these afflictions have been...

154
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:44,640
{\1c&H00FFFF&}in existence and have progressed rapidly since birth.

155
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:47,390
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis.

156
00:22:47,474 --> 00:22:49,432
{\1c&H00FFFF&}As an interesting side note...

157
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:51,557
{\1c&H00FFFF&}in spite of the aforementioned anomalies...

158
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,765
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the patient's genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected.

159
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:58,432
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

160
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:04,557
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And his left arm is perfectly normal, as you see.

161
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:09,890
{\1c&H00FFFF&}So then, gentlemen, owing to this series of conditions...

162
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:13,223
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the congenital skull exostosis,
extensive papillomatous growth...

163
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:15,723
{\1c&H00FFFF&}large pendulous masses in connection with the skin...

164
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,973
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the great enlargement of the right upper limb...

165
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:21,182
{\1c&H00FFFF&}involving all the bones, the massive distortion of the head...

166
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:25,682
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and the extensive area covered by papillomatous growth...

167
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:29,098
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the patient has been called the Elephant Man.

168
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:30,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

169
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,265
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You never mentioned his mental state.

170
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:04,973
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, he's an imbecile, probably from birth.

171
00:24:05,098 --> 00:24:06,973
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The man's a complete idiot.

172
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,098
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I pray to God he's an idiot.

173
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,057
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Where have you been?

174
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:54,932
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Out.

175
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,348
{\1c&H00FFFF&}How can I eat with a noise like that?

176
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,890
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Bytes, don't!

177
00:25:12,932 --> 00:25:16,182
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Where have you been? What did you do?

178
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:24,223
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Our man is sick. Come right away.
- What is it?

179
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:26,473
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Like this.

180
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:31,557
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- What did you do with him?
- He's been like this all night.

181
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,307
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He was fine when he left here. Now look at him.

182
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,098
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I intend to.

183
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,807
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- What happened?
- He fell!

184
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:45,390
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He falls.

185
00:25:54,265 --> 00:25:56,182
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Looks like he's had a very severe fall.

186
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,432
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He's a clumsy soul.

187
00:26:01,515 --> 00:26:03,432
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Never looks where he's going.

188
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:07,765
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But that's all right. He has me to take care of him.

189
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:10,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.

190
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:13,932
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, that's how he sleeps.

191
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:17,890
{\1c&H00FFFF&}If he lies down, he'll kill himself.

192
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:21,348
{\1c&H00FFFF&}His head's too big.

193
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:25,223
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right. This man belongs in a hospital.

194
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,182
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Can't you treat him here?

195
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:30,765
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen, he's my livelihood.

196
00:26:30,848 --> 00:26:34,098
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We're business partners, he and I.

197
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,306
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He's the greatest freak in the world.

198
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, now you listen. You won't have
much of a livelihood if he dies.

199
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, stop wasting my time. I'm going to fetch a cab.

200
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,515
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I truly, truly appreciate this, my friend.

201
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:53,181
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen. There are a lot of things I could do for you.

202
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:59,140
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You see, I move in the proper circles for this type of thing.

203
00:27:00,223 --> 00:27:03,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}In fact, anything at all...

204
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,723
{\1c&H00FFFF&}if you take my meaning.

205
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:09,098
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Everything will be taken care of.

206
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:11,098
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's good to do business with you.

207
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,098
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Here we go.

208
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,306
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.

209
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:58,723
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Can I have a bowl of oatmeal, please?

210
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:00,556
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir.

211
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,431
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Breakfasting with the patients this morning, Mr. Treves?

212
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:05,556
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. No, it's for a patient.

213
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,681
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There you are, sir.

214
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:10,556
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you. Morning.

215
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,931
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Morning.

216
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:18,973
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, Treves! Just come here for a moment, will you?

217
00:29:29,223 --> 00:29:30,640
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What's that?

218
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:35,806
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good heavens! You haven't acquired
a sudden taste for this, have you?

219
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,890
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yes, sir. It's quite nutritious.
- Possibly.

220
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:41,223
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Not quite the diet for a grown man.

221
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:42,723
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Nurse!

222
00:29:43,723 --> 00:29:45,640
{\1c&H00FFFF&}When you have a moment...

223
00:29:45,723 --> 00:29:50,431
{\1c&H00FFFF&}take this up to the patient in the isolation ward, will you?

224
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:52,223
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir.

225
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,640
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.

226
00:29:57,973 --> 00:30:00,181
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Won't he indeed! Just a minute, Treves.

227
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,515
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Something I want to say to you. Come in.

228
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:08,973
{\1c&H00FFFF&}A hospital's no place for secrecy, you know, Mr. Treves.

229
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:13,264
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Doctors spiriting hooded figures about is apt to cause comment.

230
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:15,556
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why wasn't this patient properly admitted?

231
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:19,223
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why is he in the isolation ward?
He's not contagious, is he?

232
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:23,473
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No, sir. He's got chronic bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.

233
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:25,514
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why isn't he in the general ward then?

234
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:29,264
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, sir, he's quite seriously deformed...

235
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:32,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and I fear the other patients would find him rather shocking.

236
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:35,431
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Deformed? Is that it?

237
00:30:35,514 --> 00:30:38,639
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Am I to assume then that he is ultimately incurable?

238
00:30:38,723 --> 00:30:39,639
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir.

239
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:42,806
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But you must be aware that this
hospital doesn't accept incurables.

240
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:44,806
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The rules are perfectly clear.

241
00:30:44,889 --> 00:30:46,806
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, sir, I'm well aware of that...

242
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:49,723
{\1c&H00FFFF&}but this case is quite exceptional.

243
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:14,139
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I quite appreciate your problem, Mr. Treves.

244
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:18,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why not contact the British Home or
the Royal Hospital for Incurables?

245
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:20,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}They might find a place for him.

246
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:23,264
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll look into it. Would you like to meet him?

247
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:42,556
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Excuse me.

248
00:31:43,264 --> 00:31:44,764
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The Elephant Man.

249
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:52,889
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Sorry.

250
00:31:59,764 --> 00:32:02,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I should have warned you.

251
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,598
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please forgive me.

252
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:07,806
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

253
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:12,223
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up here.

254
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,681
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell her to knock on the door and wait for me.

255
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:29,889
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry about that. L...

256
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:35,223
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We'll bring you another breakfast.
You must be very hungry.

257
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:39,681
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And I think you'll be quite comfortable here for a while.

258
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:41,764
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll see to it that you have everything you need.

259
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:04,972
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Cor blimey!

260
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:14,097
{\1c&H00FFFF&}So, this is the Elephant Man.

261
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,139
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I ain't seen nothing like you before.

262
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:23,056
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What the bleedin' hell happened to ya?

263
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:29,264
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Dumb, eh?

264
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:33,764
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I like people that can keep quiet.

265
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:39,931
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Here, have a drink.

266
00:36:42,597 --> 00:36:44,931
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Go on! No?

267
00:36:49,597 --> 00:36:52,097
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You should be more sociable, mate.

268
00:36:54,264 --> 00:36:56,514
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You'll get yourself disliked.

269
00:37:01,806 --> 00:37:05,139
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You and I are gonna be good friends...

270
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,472
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and I've got a lot of friends who'd like to meet you.

271
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,639
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And they will, mate.

272
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:12,597
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Believe me, they will.

273
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:27,097
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?

274
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:29,264
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, up on the bed.

275
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:08,639
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All he understands is a good smack.

276
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:12,347
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He's had his share of smacks.
That's what drives him under the bed.

277
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,139
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You have to treat him with kindness and patience.

278
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:18,889
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Perhaps you've got time for that sort of treatment, Mr. Treves.

279
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:21,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But I haven't. I've got a hospital to run.

280
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:24,139
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, don't you waste your time with him, sir.

281
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:29,055
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's like talking to a brick wall.

282
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:33,472
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, I don't mean to be harsh but...

283
00:38:33,555 --> 00:38:35,514
{\1c&H00FFFF&}he doesn't belong here.

284
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:42,514
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Honestly, sir, honestly, what can you do for him?

285
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:58,597
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, and by the way, Mr. Carr Gomm said...

286
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,597
{\1c&H00FFFF&}he would like to see you when you can spare a moment.

287
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,347
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yes.
- Right.

288
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,680
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't help you unless you help me.

289
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,389
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You see, I believe there's something
that you want to say to me.

290
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,139
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Something back there.

291
00:39:27,222 --> 00:39:29,722
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't help you unless you help me, you know!

292
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:35,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I believe you want to say something to me, don't you?

293
00:39:37,597 --> 00:39:40,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I've got to understand what you're
feeling, what you're thinking.

294
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,722
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you understand me?

295
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:51,597
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, just nod your head
if you can... Can you understand me?

296
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,389
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Just nod your head if you understand me.

297
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,680
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.

298
00:40:02,555 --> 00:40:04,889
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You do understand.

299
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:07,472
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I want to hear... I want to hear you talk.

300
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:10,389
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We're gonna show them that you're not a wall. Understand?

301
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,222
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I want you to talk to me.

302
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:17,222
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, now, I want to hear you say it.

303
00:40:17,305 --> 00:40:19,847
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I've got to hear how you say things.

304
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,347
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I won't hurt you. I've got to hear
and understand how you say things.

305
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,805
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Very slowly, I want you to say, "Yes."

306
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,180
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Say, "Yes."

307
00:40:36,513 --> 00:40:38,388
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.

308
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:40,972
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes!

309
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:42,472
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good.

310
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:46,597
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, now, just once more say it again. "Yes."

311
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,055
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I can understand that.

312
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:55,597
{\1c&H00FFFF&}That's good.

313
00:40:56,763 --> 00:40:58,763
{\1c&H00FFFF&}That's very good. All right now.

314
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:01,847
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm going to say some words to you,
and I want you to repeat them.

315
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,138
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you understand?

316
00:41:04,222 --> 00:41:06,597
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Say, "Hello.

317
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,430
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My name is..."

318
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:14,472
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello.

319
00:41:15,763 --> 00:41:18,513
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My name is...

320
00:41:18,597 --> 00:41:21,222
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"John Merrick."

321
00:41:23,972 --> 00:41:27,180
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No. John... That's very good.

322
00:41:27,263 --> 00:41:29,430
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Say, "John Merrick."

323
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:38,055
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Hello. My name is John Merrick."

324
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:41,513
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello.

325
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:44,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My name is...

326
00:41:45,013 --> 00:41:47,638
{\1c&H00FFFF&}John Merrick.

327
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:49,055
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You can speak.

328
00:41:57,722 --> 00:41:59,722
{\1c&H00FFFF&}How did you get up here?

329
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:03,180
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I want my man back.

330
00:42:03,263 --> 00:42:07,888
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Just a moment. How did you get up?
- Never mind that. I want my man.

331
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,888
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He's still very sick.

332
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,347
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, come downstairs with me,
and I'll explain the situation.

333
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,055
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't!

334
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,555
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't.

335
00:42:17,597 --> 00:42:21,638
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You've had plenty of time to...

336
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:23,888
{\1c&H00FFFF&}cure him.

337
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,638
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And now he's leaving with me.

338
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:31,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you understand me now, Mr. Treves?

339
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:33,763
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We made a deal.

340
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:35,597
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You misunderstood.

341
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,305
{\1c&H00FFFF&}This man has suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning.

342
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:42,180
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He's my patient now.

343
00:42:42,263 --> 00:42:44,263
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Pull the other one, why don't you?

344
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:46,263
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Bytes, I'm sorry.

345
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:48,805
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But all you do is profit from another man's misery.

346
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,888
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you think you're better than me?

347
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:54,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No, I never said that.

348
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:58,555
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You wanted the freak...

349
00:42:58,638 --> 00:43:02,097
{\1c&H00FFFF&}to show to those doctor chums of
yours, to make a name for yourself.

350
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,138
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You, my friend.

351
00:43:05,722 --> 00:43:10,805
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I gave you the freak on trust...

352
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}in the name of science...

353
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:15,972
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and now I want him back!

354
00:43:16,097 --> 00:43:18,097
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You do not own this man! Now stop it!

355
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,805
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I want him back!

356
00:43:20,888 --> 00:43:22,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}So you can beat him? So you can starve him?

357
00:43:23,013 --> 00:43:25,388
{\1c&H00FFFF&}A dog in the streets would fare better with you!

358
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,597
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I shall go to the authorities.

359
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:30,972
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Go to the authorities then! Go to them by all means.

360
00:43:31,097 --> 00:43:34,430
{\1c&H00FFFF&}They'll be very interested
to hear your story as well as ours.

361
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,222
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now...

362
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:42,763
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I think we really do understand one another.

363
00:43:45,805 --> 00:43:47,263
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.

364
00:44:02,221 --> 00:44:05,430
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Singularly unattractive character, I must say.

365
00:44:07,263 --> 00:44:11,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, Treves, it seems to me I might
as well meet this patient of yours.

366
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,805
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you very much. Thank you.

367
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,805
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Shall we say in a few days then?

368
00:44:19,888 --> 00:44:22,138
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Shall we say 2:00 tomorrow afternoon?

369
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:29,055
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. Well, whatever's most convenient for you, sir.

370
00:44:29,138 --> 00:44:31,513
{\1c&H00FFFF&}2:00 then, tomorrow.

371
00:44:31,596 --> 00:44:33,596
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you very much.

372
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}2:00!

373
00:44:43,221 --> 00:44:45,638
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Morning, Mr. Treves. Early again, I see.

374
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:46,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.

375
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:50,055
{\1c&H00FFFF&}With these early habits of yours,
you'd have made a good milkman.

376
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,846
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- I'll keep that in mind, Charles.
- Okay, sir. Good morning.

377
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He restoreth my soul.

378
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:10,055
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He leadeth me into paths of... for His name's sake.

379
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:13,513
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Righteousness. Righteousness.

380
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,763
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness...

381
00:45:19,846 --> 00:45:22,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}for His name's sake.

382
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,471
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good. That's very good. Good.

383
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:29,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}When your visitor comes today,
say it exactly the way you've said it.

384
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:34,721
{\1c&H00FFFF&}So when I introduce him to you,
say the words that you've learned.

385
00:45:34,763 --> 00:45:38,555
{\1c&H00FFFF&}If you have trouble with any words,
I'll help you, so don't worry.

386
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:41,096
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I will introduce him to you and say...

387
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,596
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Please meet Mr. Carr Gomm."

388
00:45:43,638 --> 00:45:45,221
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And you will say?

389
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:51,055
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello. My name is John Merrick.

390
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:53,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm very pleased to meet you.

391
00:45:54,638 --> 00:45:57,096
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good! Good.

392
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:00,138
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll go and get Mr. Carr Gomm.

393
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,388
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It is only a physical problem.

394
00:46:10,055 --> 00:46:12,805
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He has trouble with certain sounds because of...

395
00:46:12,888 --> 00:46:16,221
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the constrictive deformity of the mouth, but he can talk.

396
00:46:16,263 --> 00:46:20,096
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Talking's one thing, but is he able
to understand what's said to him?

397
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,138
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. Oh, yes! Except...

398
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:27,221
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Except he's so anxious to make a good impression on you...

399
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:29,513
{\1c&H00FFFF&}that he might seem a little nervous.

400
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,805
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come in.

401
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:04,221
{\1c&H00FFFF&}John...

402
00:47:04,263 --> 00:47:07,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}may I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm?

403
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,471
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Carr Gomm, this is John Merrick.

404
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:15,096
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello. My name is John Merrick.

405
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,138
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm very pleased to meet you.

406
00:47:17,263 --> 00:47:19,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm very pleased to meet you.

407
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:23,930
{\1c&H00FFFF&}How are you feeling today?

408
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,638
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I feel much better.

409
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:30,221
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you comfortable here?

410
00:47:32,888 --> 00:47:35,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Everybody's been very kind.

411
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:38,888
{\1c&H00FFFF&}How is your bronchitis?

412
00:47:51,096 --> 00:47:53,596
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Merrick likes the food here, don't you?

413
00:47:58,221 --> 00:48:01,721
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Much better than what I'm used to.

414
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:03,513
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, yes?

415
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:06,513
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. And what was that?

416
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,888
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Potatoes.

417
00:48:12,638 --> 00:48:14,679
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I understood that you'd been flogged.

418
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:21,429
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I feel much better now.

419
00:48:21,513 --> 00:48:22,929
{\1c&H00FFFF&}That's splendid.

420
00:48:22,971 --> 00:48:25,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}How do you find Mr. Treves?

421
00:48:26,054 --> 00:48:28,221
{\1c&H00FFFF&}As a teacher, I mean.

422
00:48:33,763 --> 00:48:38,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Everybody's been very kind.

423
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:45,304
{\1c&H00FFFF&}How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?

424
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:56,096
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Everybody's been very kind.

425
00:48:56,221 --> 00:48:58,138
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, of course, I understand.

426
00:48:58,221 --> 00:49:01,179
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick.

427
00:49:01,263 --> 00:49:03,388
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good day to you.

428
00:49:13,096 --> 00:49:14,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Very good, John.

429
00:49:15,096 --> 00:49:16,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It was very good.

430
00:49:17,096 --> 00:49:18,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll be back in a moment.

431
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:25,929
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The Lord is my shepherd...

432
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:29,304
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I shall not want.

433
00:49:30,388 --> 00:49:32,304
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He maketh me lie down...

434
00:49:32,388 --> 00:49:36,888
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It was a brave attempt, but the man
was mouthing words taught by you.

435
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:40,596
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. Well, I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

436
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:43,888
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He restoreth my soul.

437
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:45,721
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He simply doesn't belong here.

438
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:49,096
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He'd be better off somewhere where
he can be constantly looked after.

439
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:52,096
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry things have turned out this way. Good day to you.

440
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:53,596
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yea...

441
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:58,429
{\1c&H00FFFF&}though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...

442
00:49:58,554 --> 00:50:00,388
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I fear no evil...

443
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:03,263
{\1c&H00FFFF&}for Thou art with me.

444
00:50:03,346 --> 00:50:05,804
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thy rod and staff, they...

445
00:50:05,888 --> 00:50:07,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Carr Gomm!

446
00:50:09,846 --> 00:50:12,179
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, what is it?

447
00:50:12,263 --> 00:50:13,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's that.

448
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,554
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I didn't teach him that part.

449
00:50:20,263 --> 00:50:23,263
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Surely goodness and mercy...

450
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:26,638
{\1c&H00FFFF&}will follow me all the days of my life...

451
00:50:26,721 --> 00:50:31,721
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

452
00:50:35,763 --> 00:50:39,221
{\1c&H00FFFF&}How did you know the rest of it?
I didn't teach you the rest of it.

453
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:41,263
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's very strange.

454
00:50:42,513 --> 00:50:44,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me, how did you know the rest of it?

455
00:50:45,054 --> 00:50:47,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The 23rd Psalm.

456
00:50:50,554 --> 00:50:55,221
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I used to read the Bible every day.

457
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,596
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I know it very well...

458
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:01,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and the Book of Common Prayer.

459
00:51:03,512 --> 00:51:07,429
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The 23rd Psalm is very beautiful. It's my favorite.

460
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:13,387
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Treves, come and see me in my office
when you're through up here.

461
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:15,429
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There's something important I want to say to you.

462
00:51:16,762 --> 00:51:20,471
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good-bye, Mr. Merrick.
I do hope we shall meet again.

463
00:51:28,512 --> 00:51:32,137
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, why didn't you tell me you could read?

464
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:37,262
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I was frightened.

465
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,596
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I see.

466
00:51:39,637 --> 00:51:44,637
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I was afraid to talk.

467
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:50,429
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please forgive me.

468
00:52:00,304 --> 00:52:03,762
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Can you imagine the kind of life he must have had?

469
00:52:03,804 --> 00:52:05,721
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I think I can.

470
00:52:05,762 --> 00:52:07,721
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't believe so.

471
00:52:07,762 --> 00:52:11,762
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No one could possibly imagine it.
I don't believe any of us can!

472
00:52:22,596 --> 00:52:24,512
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Terrible though his appearance is...

473
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:28,679
{\1c&H00FFFF&}so terrible indeed that women and nervous persons...

474
00:52:28,762 --> 00:52:32,137
{\1c&H00FFFF&}fly in horror from the sight of him...

475
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:37,637
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and that he is debarred from seeking
to earn his livelihood in any way...

476
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,512
{\1c&H00FFFF&}yet he is superior in intelligence.

477
00:52:40,596 --> 00:52:44,554
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He can read and write, he's quiet, gentle...

478
00:52:44,637 --> 00:52:48,471
{\1c&H00FFFF&}not to say even refined in his mind."

479
00:52:56,012 --> 00:52:59,262
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I should very much like to meet this gentleman.

480
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:27,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you seen this?

481
00:53:35,054 --> 00:53:36,471
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen to this.

482
00:53:36,554 --> 00:53:38,554
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey up! Hey up!

483
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,137
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now listen.

484
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:48,846
{\1c&H00FFFF&}This is a letter to the London Times...

485
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:51,054
{\1c&H00FFFF&}from the governor of the hospital.

486
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:55,054
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"There is now in a little room off one of our attic wards...

487
00:53:55,096 --> 00:53:57,596
{\1c&H00FFFF&}a man named John Merrick.

488
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,846
{\1c&H00FFFF&}So dreadful a sight that he is unable...

489
00:53:59,929 --> 00:54:03,054
{\1c&H00FFFF&}even to come out by daylight to the garden.

490
00:54:03,096 --> 00:54:06,096
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He is being called the Elephant Man...

491
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:08,721
{\1c&H00FFFF&}on account of his terrible deformity.

492
00:54:08,762 --> 00:54:13,721
{\1c&H00FFFF&}His appearance is so terrible
that women and nervous persons...

493
00:54:13,762 --> 00:54:16,387
{\1c&H00FFFF&}fly in terror at the sight of him."

494
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:21,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And how do you get tickets to see him?

495
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:24,262
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Your very own Sunny Jim.

496
00:54:24,346 --> 00:54:26,971
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Let's go and see him then!
- All right, keep your shirt on.

497
00:54:27,054 --> 00:54:29,346
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The time must be right.

498
00:54:30,929 --> 00:54:32,929
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Right now he's in the attic.

499
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:38,387
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But tomorrow they're moving him to
Bedstead Square right into my lap.

500
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:41,887
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Then, for the right price...

501
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:47,054
{\1c&H00FFFF&}you will see something you'll
never ever see again in your life!

502
00:55:36,512 --> 00:55:38,429
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, don't look so glum, girls.

503
00:55:38,512 --> 00:55:42,345
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Enthusiastic volunteers
should be more cheerful, hmm?

504
00:55:43,262 --> 00:55:45,929
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Put your collar straight, girl.

505
00:55:46,012 --> 00:55:48,429
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And remember...

506
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:51,512
{\1c&H00FFFF&}that under no circumstances...

507
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:53,012
{\1c&H00FFFF&}whatsoever...

508
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:57,679
{\1c&H00FFFF&}are any mirrors to be brought into this room.

509
00:55:57,762 --> 00:55:59,720
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.

510
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:02,762
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.

511
00:56:02,845 --> 00:56:04,262
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.

512
00:56:09,595 --> 00:56:14,387
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- He's so ugly.
- Ugly or not, you're gonna help me.

513
00:56:20,387 --> 00:56:23,220
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

514
00:56:23,262 --> 00:56:24,720
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.

515
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:28,595
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You look very nice in your new clothes.

516
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,387
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you very much.

517
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:35,095
{\1c&H00FFFF&}If there's nothing else, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.

518
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:37,095
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No, there's nothing.

519
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,929
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You ready for tea?

520
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,720
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please go in, John.

521
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,720
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Make yourself comfortable.

522
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:37,220
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come along, meet our guest.

523
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:49,429
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Merrick, I'd like you to meet my wife, Anne.

524
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:52,470
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Anne, this is John Merrick.

525
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:58,554
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Merrick.

526
00:58:02,928 --> 00:58:04,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm...

527
00:58:05,012 --> 00:58:08,220
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm very pleased...

528
00:58:14,387 --> 00:58:16,803
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What is it? What's the matter?

529
00:58:18,803 --> 00:58:21,387
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's just that l...

530
00:58:22,512 --> 00:58:26,553
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not used to being...

531
00:58:26,595 --> 00:58:31,053
{\1c&H00FFFF&}treated so well by...

532
00:58:31,137 --> 00:58:33,220
{\1c&H00FFFF&}a beautiful woman.

533
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,595
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you like a cup of tea, Mr. Merrick?

534
00:58:39,637 --> 00:58:41,595
{\1c&H00FFFF&}That's a good idea.

535
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,595
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you like to come and see the
rest of the house? I'll show you.

536
00:58:59,137 --> 00:59:01,095
{\1c&H00FFFF&}How's your tea?

537
00:59:04,803 --> 00:59:06,428
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's very good!

538
00:59:09,762 --> 00:59:14,012
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm enjoying my visit here very much.

539
00:59:14,095 --> 00:59:18,553
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's so kind of you to invite me into your own home.

540
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,220
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry that I...

541
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,970
{\1c&H00FFFF&}made a spectacle of myself.

542
00:59:28,053 --> 00:59:30,178
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No, not at all.

543
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:38,303
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I like the way...

544
00:59:38,387 --> 00:59:40,970
{\1c&H00FFFF&}you arranged your pictures on the mantelpiece.

545
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,428
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, thank you.

546
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:46,220
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Is that the way they do it in most houses?

547
00:59:46,262 --> 00:59:49,262
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I'm sure they do, yes.

548
00:59:49,345 --> 00:59:52,162
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Who are they of?

549
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:56,595
{\1c&H00FFFF&}These are relatives, and these are our children.

550
00:59:56,678 --> 00:59:59,178
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Children? Oh, may I see?

551
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,845
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, of course.

552
01:00:08,512 --> 01:00:10,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Where are the children?

553
01:00:12,137 --> 01:00:15,220
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, um, well, they're out with friends...

554
01:00:15,262 --> 01:00:16,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}at the moment.

555
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:19,637
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Friends.

556
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And here is Frederick's mother.

557
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,720
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, how lovely.

558
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:31,720
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And these are my parents.

559
01:00:37,637 --> 01:00:40,220
{\1c&H00FFFF&}They have such...

560
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,303
{\1c&H00FFFF&}noble faces.

561
01:00:43,387 --> 01:00:46,512
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I've always... I've always thought so myself.

562
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:49,595
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you...

563
01:00:52,428 --> 01:00:54,512
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you care to see my mother?

564
01:00:55,887 --> 01:00:57,303
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Your mother?

565
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,720
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, please.

566
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,553
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, she's...

567
01:01:12,262 --> 01:01:14,303
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful.

568
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:16,678
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, she had...

569
01:01:16,762 --> 01:01:19,512
{\1c&H00FFFF&}She had the face of an angel.

570
01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:30,678
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I must've...

571
01:01:34,511 --> 01:01:38,053
{\1c&H00FFFF&}been a great disappointment to her.

572
01:01:38,136 --> 01:01:39,720
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No, Mr. Merrick.

573
01:01:41,386 --> 01:01:44,095
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No son as loving as you
could ever be a disappointment.

574
01:01:46,428 --> 01:01:49,970
{\1c&H00FFFF&}If only I could find her...

575
01:01:50,095 --> 01:01:52,511
{\1c&H00FFFF&}so she could see me...

576
01:01:52,595 --> 01:01:56,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}with such lovely friends here now.

577
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,970
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Perhaps she could...

578
01:01:59,095 --> 01:02:00,970
{\1c&H00FFFF&}love me as I am.

579
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:05,678
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I've tried so hard to be good.

580
01:02:13,845 --> 01:02:15,220
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm so sorry.

581
01:02:17,178 --> 01:02:18,261
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.

582
01:02:18,345 --> 01:02:20,345
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm so sorry.

583
01:02:21,803 --> 01:02:23,636
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please. Here.

584
01:03:02,386 --> 01:03:04,303
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What's that you're doing?

585
01:03:07,553 --> 01:03:09,136
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What is it?

586
01:03:12,261 --> 01:03:15,345
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I see. It's St. Phillips.

587
01:03:15,428 --> 01:03:17,636
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why, that's very good.

588
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,428
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, you got the windows and arches just right.

589
01:03:35,428 --> 01:03:37,011
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I wish...

590
01:03:39,178 --> 01:03:41,095
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I could sleep...

591
01:03:42,678 --> 01:03:44,428
{\1c&H00FFFF&}like normal people.

592
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:55,595
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Mr. Treves?
- Yes?

593
01:03:55,636 --> 01:03:58,136
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There's something that...

594
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,345
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I've been meaning to ask you...

595
01:04:00,428 --> 01:04:02,511
{\1c&H00FFFF&}for some time now.

596
01:04:02,595 --> 01:04:03,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What's that?

597
01:04:05,636 --> 01:04:07,053
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Can you cure me?

598
01:04:11,386 --> 01:04:13,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No, we can care for you...

599
01:04:13,803 --> 01:04:16,845
{\1c&H00FFFF&}but we can't cure you.

600
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:23,011
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought not.

601
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come in.

602
01:04:37,511 --> 01:04:41,470
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Good morning.
- Good morning.

603
01:04:41,553 --> 01:04:44,720
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There's someone here who'd like
to meet you, if that's all right.

604
01:04:44,803 --> 01:04:47,345
{\1c&H00FFFF&}May I introduce you to one of the bright lights...

605
01:04:47,428 --> 01:04:49,636
{\1c&H00FFFF&}of the English stage, Mrs. Kendal.

606
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,470
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Mrs. Kendal, Mr. John Merrick.
- Good day, Mr. Merrick.

607
01:04:55,678 --> 01:04:57,261
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good day.

608
01:04:57,345 --> 01:04:59,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I've brought you some things. I hope you like them.

609
01:05:00,011 --> 01:05:01,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope you don't think it too forward.

610
01:05:06,844 --> 01:05:09,386
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I knew you'd understand.

611
01:05:09,469 --> 01:05:11,386
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll leave you together.

612
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:14,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Here.

613
01:05:17,303 --> 01:05:21,594
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I want you to know, I don't go about
giving my picture to just anyone.

614
01:05:21,636 --> 01:05:23,594
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, no. I wouldn't think of it.

615
01:05:25,553 --> 01:05:27,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's beautiful.

616
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:30,178
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You're so...

617
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:32,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll... Well, I'll...

618
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:39,053
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I shall put it in a... in a place of honor.

619
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:43,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Here, next to my mother.

620
01:05:49,886 --> 01:05:52,053
{\1c&H00FFFF&}She's very pretty, your mother.

621
01:05:52,136 --> 01:05:53,678
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, yes.

622
01:06:08,553 --> 01:06:11,011
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I see you're constructing a...

623
01:06:11,053 --> 01:06:12,678
{\1c&H00FFFF&}church?

624
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:17,844
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, no. It's a cathedral.

625
01:06:17,928 --> 01:06:20,261
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You see?

626
01:06:20,303 --> 01:06:24,178
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Only, I have to rely...

627
01:06:24,261 --> 01:06:25,844
{\1c&H00FFFF&}on my imagination...

628
01:06:25,928 --> 01:06:28,636
{\1c&H00FFFF&}for what I can't actually see.

629
01:06:40,178 --> 01:06:45,469
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Treves tells me that you're in the theater.

630
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:47,553
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you live there?

631
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:50,428
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.

632
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:54,178
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, it must be...

633
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:57,094
{\1c&H00FFFF&}wonderful just to work there.

634
01:06:57,178 --> 01:07:00,386
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Is it beautiful?
- You've never been?

635
01:07:00,469 --> 01:07:03,053
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm afraid not.

636
01:07:03,803 --> 01:07:05,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, Mr. Merrick. You must go.

637
01:07:05,803 --> 01:07:08,053
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The theater's the most beautiful place on earth.

638
01:07:08,136 --> 01:07:10,094
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course, I am a bit partial.

639
01:07:11,386 --> 01:07:15,469
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The theater is romance.

640
01:07:16,844 --> 01:07:18,428
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Romance.

641
01:07:23,469 --> 01:07:25,928
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Which reminds me, I've brought you something else.

642
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:34,803
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Thank you.
- Have you read it?

643
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:40,803
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No, but I certainly shall.

644
01:07:48,844 --> 01:07:51,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Romeo and Juliet.

645
01:07:51,844 --> 01:07:54,178
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, I've heard of this.

646
01:07:58,136 --> 01:08:02,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"If I profane with my unworthiest hand...

647
01:08:02,803 --> 01:08:05,261
{\1c&H00FFFF&}this holy shrine...

648
01:08:05,303 --> 01:08:08,719
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the gentle fine is this...

649
01:08:08,803 --> 01:08:11,428
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My lips...

650
01:08:11,511 --> 01:08:14,094
{\1c&H00FFFF&}two blushing pilgrims...

651
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:18,053
{\1c&H00FFFF&}ready stand to smooth that rough touch...

652
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:23,261
{\1c&H00FFFF&}with a tender kiss."

653
01:08:24,469 --> 01:08:28,428
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much...

654
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:30,802
{\1c&H00FFFF&}which mannerly devotion shows in this.

655
01:08:30,886 --> 01:08:35,052
{\1c&H00FFFF&}For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch...

656
01:08:35,136 --> 01:08:37,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and palm to palm is holy Palmer's kiss."

657
01:08:39,302 --> 01:08:42,511
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"O, then dear saint...

658
01:08:42,594 --> 01:08:45,552
{\1c&H00FFFF&}let lips do what hands do.

659
01:08:45,636 --> 01:08:48,386
{\1c&H00FFFF&}They pray, grant thou...

660
01:08:48,469 --> 01:08:52,636
{\1c&H00FFFF&}lest faith turn to despair."

661
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,636
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Saints do not move...

662
01:08:56,136 --> 01:08:58,094
{\1c&H00FFFF&}though grant for prayer's sake."

663
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:02,094
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Then move not...

664
01:09:02,177 --> 01:09:05,802
{\1c&H00FFFF&}while my prayer's effect I take.

665
01:09:07,136 --> 01:09:09,052
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thus from my lips...

666
01:09:09,136 --> 01:09:12,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}by thine, my sin is purged."

667
01:09:17,344 --> 01:09:19,927
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, yes. And then it says they kiss.

668
01:09:23,302 --> 01:09:26,261
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."

669
01:09:32,552 --> 01:09:35,594
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Sin from thy lips?

670
01:09:35,677 --> 01:09:38,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}O trespass sweetly urged.

671
01:09:40,052 --> 01:09:42,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Give me my sin again."

672
01:09:48,844 --> 01:09:50,886
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, Mr. Merrick.

673
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:53,094
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You're not an elephant man at all.

674
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,842
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

675
01:09:57,883 --> 01:09:59,469
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

676
01:09:59,469 --> 01:10:01,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You're Romeo.

677
01:10:09,511 --> 01:10:13,011
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Mrs. Kendal, always at the forefront of fashion and form...

678
01:10:13,094 --> 01:10:15,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}was seen leaving the London the other afternoon.

679
01:10:15,802 --> 01:10:18,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No, dear readers, the most facile actress of our day...

680
01:10:18,511 --> 01:10:22,761
{\1c&H00FFFF&}has not been taken ill,
but rather said she was visiting a friend.

681
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:26,052
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And who was the lucky recipient of this attention?

682
01:10:26,136 --> 01:10:29,261
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Quick inquiries proved it to be
none other than Mr. John Merrick...

683
01:10:29,302 --> 01:10:34,011
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the Elephant Man, with whom our
readers are undoubtedly familiar.

684
01:10:34,094 --> 01:10:36,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}After a chat of three quarters of an hour...

685
01:10:36,469 --> 01:10:38,719
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. Merrick...

686
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:40,886
{\1c&H00FFFF&}with an autographed portrait of herself."

687
01:10:40,969 --> 01:10:42,927
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I saw it in his room.

688
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:46,594
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"Owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme nature...

689
01:10:46,677 --> 01:10:50,844
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Merrick has never been properly
presented to London society.

690
01:10:50,927 --> 01:10:53,052
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal goes...

691
01:10:53,136 --> 01:10:57,344
{\1c&H00FFFF&}others inevitably follow, the question arises...

692
01:10:57,427 --> 01:11:00,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}'Will London society present itself to him?'"

693
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:05,052
{\1c&H00FFFF&}This walking stick is so... is so dashing.

694
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,552
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Much more elegant than my old one.

695
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:12,302
{\1c&H00FFFF&}More tea?

696
01:11:18,219 --> 01:11:23,136
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You see, I don't go out as often as I would like...

697
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:25,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}because naturally...

698
01:11:25,511 --> 01:11:28,677
{\1c&H00FFFF&}some people do find my appearance disturbing.

699
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:32,302
{\1c&H00FFFF&}If you have a chill, I could close the window.

700
01:11:32,386 --> 01:11:35,219
{\1c&H00FFFF&}No, I'm fine. Please...

701
01:11:35,302 --> 01:11:37,927
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, thank you.

702
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:39,594
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

703
01:11:40,969 --> 01:11:42,552
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You see...

704
01:11:43,844 --> 01:11:46,219
{\1c&H00FFFF&}people are frightened...

705
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,469
{\1c&H00FFFF&}by what they don't understand.

706
01:11:50,136 --> 01:11:53,677
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And it is hard to understand even for me...

707
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:56,219
{\1c&H00FFFF&}because, well, my mother...

708
01:11:57,594 --> 01:12:00,177
{\1c&H00FFFF&}she was so very beautiful.

709
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:13,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Mothershead, I don't think he
should have any more visitors today.

710
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,760
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I have to lecture at the college, so I'll be back this evening.

711
01:12:15,802 --> 01:12:19,052
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.

712
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:22,302
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- I'm awfully late. What is it?
- Well, sir, I don't quite...

713
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:24,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't quite understand...

714
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,927
{\1c&H00FFFF&}why it is you allow that sort of people in there.

715
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,760
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why? Because he enjoys it,
and I think it's very good for him.

716
01:12:30,844 --> 01:12:33,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, but sir, you saw the expression on their faces.

717
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:35,677
{\1c&H00FFFF&}They didn't hide their disgust.

718
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,469
{\1c&H00FFFF&}They don't care anything about John.

719
01:12:37,552 --> 01:12:39,844
{\1c&H00FFFF&}They only want to impress their friends.

720
01:12:39,927 --> 01:12:41,844
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I think you're being rather harsh on them, don't you?

721
01:12:41,927 --> 01:12:43,969
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I beg your pardon, sir.

722
01:12:44,052 --> 01:12:46,010
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You yourself hardly showed him much loving kindness...

723
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:48,052
{\1c&H00FFFF&}when he first arrived, did you?

724
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:51,927
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I bathed him, I fed him and I cleaned up after him, didn't I?

725
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,552
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And I see that my nurses do the same.

726
01:12:54,635 --> 01:12:59,094
{\1c&H00FFFF&}And if"loving kindness" can be called care...

727
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,969
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and practical concern...

728
01:13:02,052 --> 01:13:05,344
{\1c&H00FFFF&}then I did show him loving kindness
and I am not ashamed to admit it.

729
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:08,594
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I didn't mean it exactly that way. Now, please believe me.

730
01:13:08,677 --> 01:13:10,594
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, of course I appreciate your concern.

731
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:13,052
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I appreciate everything that you've done for Mr. Merrick.

732
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:17,552
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But I am the physician in charge
and I must do what is best for him.

733
01:13:17,635 --> 01:13:21,344
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Please, now, I'm also very late.
- If you ask my opinion...

734
01:13:21,427 --> 01:13:23,802
{\1c&H00FFFF&}he's only being stared at all over again.

735
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,594
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

736
01:13:53,052 --> 01:13:54,969
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Night time.

737
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:43,651
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

738
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:47,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What's the matter, Freddie?

739
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:53,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes.

740
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:55,218
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What on earth made you think of him?

741
01:16:55,302 --> 01:17:00,302
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I'm beginning to believe that
Mr. Bytes and I are very much alike.

742
01:17:00,385 --> 01:17:01,968
{\1c&H00FFFF&}That's absurd.

743
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,927
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It seems that I've made Mr. Merrick...

744
01:17:07,968 --> 01:17:11,968
{\1c&H00FFFF&}into a curiosity all over again, doesn't it?

745
01:17:12,052 --> 01:17:15,260
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Only this time in a hospital rather than a carnival.

746
01:17:17,302 --> 01:17:19,385
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My name is constantly in the papers...

747
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:22,468
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm always being praised to the skies.

748
01:17:22,552 --> 01:17:26,510
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Patients are now expressly asking for my services.

749
01:17:26,593 --> 01:17:29,052
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course they do, because you're a very fine doctor.

750
01:17:29,135 --> 01:17:32,302
{\1c&H00FFFF&}John Merrick is happier and more fulfilled now...

751
01:17:32,385 --> 01:17:33,885
{\1c&H00FFFF&}than he's ever been in his entire life...

752
01:17:33,968 --> 01:17:36,135
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and it's completely due to you.

753
01:17:38,093 --> 01:17:41,718
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What was it all for? Why did I do it?

754
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,677
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Freddie, what are you trying to say?

755
01:17:48,802 --> 01:17:50,760
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Am I a good man...

756
01:17:51,885 --> 01:17:53,802
{\1c&H00FFFF&}or am I a bad man?

757
01:17:59,468 --> 01:18:03,343
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Steady on, Treves. Steady on, my dear fellow.

758
01:18:03,427 --> 01:18:05,343
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come sit down, won't you?

759
01:18:10,968 --> 01:18:14,343
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Gentlemen, I know we usually open these proceedings...

760
01:18:14,427 --> 01:18:16,343
{\1c&H00FFFF&}by reading the minutes.

761
01:18:16,427 --> 01:18:18,927
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But on this occasion, in the interests of urgency...

762
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,760
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I think we should first conclude...

763
01:18:20,802 --> 01:18:23,260
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the matter previously under discussion...

764
01:18:23,302 --> 01:18:25,677
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the case of Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man.

765
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:30,010
{\1c&H00FFFF&}One moment, Mr. Chairman. As far as I'm concerned...

766
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:33,218
{\1c&H00FFFF&}this creature has no business being here at all.

767
01:18:34,427 --> 01:18:36,343
{\1c&H00FFFF&}l, for one, am sick and tired...

768
01:18:36,427 --> 01:18:39,385
{\1c&H00FFFF&}of this competitive freak-hunting...

769
01:18:39,468 --> 01:18:42,093
{\1c&H00FFFF&}by these overly ambitious young doctors...

770
01:18:42,177 --> 01:18:44,427
{\1c&H00FFFF&}trying to make names for themselves.

771
01:18:44,468 --> 01:18:48,260
{\1c&H00FFFF&}To parade them about in front of the
pathological society is one thing...

772
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:50,385
{\1c&H00FFFF&}but to waste this committee's valuable time...

773
01:18:50,468 --> 01:18:54,802
{\1c&H00FFFF&}with requests for shelter for these
abominations of nature is another.

774
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:02,718
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You must be more careful.

775
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,801
{\1c&H00FFFF&}In the light of these facts, our course is clear.

776
01:19:06,885 --> 01:19:10,260
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The question is not whether to
accept this creature as a patient.

777
01:19:10,301 --> 01:19:13,801
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The question is, when will
those rooms be vacated for use...

778
01:19:13,885 --> 01:19:17,051
{\1c&H00FFFF&}by better qualified, more deserving cases?

779
01:19:17,093 --> 01:19:18,801
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I move that this Elephant Man...

780
01:19:18,885 --> 01:19:21,385
{\1c&H00FFFF&}be removed from the premises immediately.

781
01:19:21,468 --> 01:19:25,176
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We have a sacred duty to cure the sick...

782
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,843
{\1c&H00FFFF&}not care for circus animals.

783
01:19:28,301 --> 01:19:31,635
{\1c&H00FFFF&}That is my last word on the subject.
Mr. Chairman, shall we vote?

784
01:19:31,718 --> 01:19:35,301
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I take it, Mr. Broadneck, your mind
is quite unshakable in this matter?

785
01:19:35,385 --> 01:19:38,468
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Chairman, do you not have ears?

786
01:19:38,551 --> 01:19:41,051
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I am unalterably opposed!

787
01:19:41,801 --> 01:19:43,801
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My mind is made up on this!

788
01:19:45,676 --> 01:19:47,760
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You shall not sway me.

789
01:19:47,843 --> 01:19:51,676
{\1c&H00FFFF&}May we now vote, Mr. Chairman, at long last?

790
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:54,301
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, Broadneck.

791
01:19:54,385 --> 01:19:56,301
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I think the time has come.

792
01:19:57,385 --> 01:20:00,551
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness...

793
01:20:00,593 --> 01:20:03,843
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

794
01:20:21,718 --> 01:20:24,510
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good morning, gentlemen.
I hope I am not disturbing you.

795
01:20:24,593 --> 01:20:26,635
{\1c&H00FFFF&}On the contrary, ma'am. Your presence here...

796
01:20:26,718 --> 01:20:29,426
{\1c&H00FFFF&}is always greatly appreciated.

797
01:20:29,468 --> 01:20:32,510
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We were just taking a vote on Mr. Merrick.

798
01:20:36,593 --> 01:20:40,385
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Her Royal Highness has shown
the greatest interest in his fate.

799
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:42,801
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Indeed I have, sir, as has the queen.

800
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:49,010
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I have a brief communication from Her Majesty...

801
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:51,551
{\1c&H00FFFF&}which she has requested that I read to you.

802
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:57,468
{\1c&H00FFFF&}"To the Governing Committee, London Hospital.

803
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:09,426
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I would very much like to commend you
for the charitable face...

804
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:12,426
{\1c&H00FFFF&}you have shown Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man.

805
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:15,093
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It is laudable that you have provided...

806
01:21:15,176 --> 01:21:17,551
{\1c&H00FFFF&}one of England's most unfortunate sons...

807
01:21:17,593 --> 01:21:22,218
{\1c&H00FFFF&}with a safe and tranquil harbor, a home.

808
01:21:22,301 --> 01:21:24,218
{\1c&H00FFFF&}For this immeasurable kindness...

809
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,635
{\1c&H00FFFF&}as well as the many other acts of mercy...

810
01:21:26,718 --> 01:21:28,635
{\1c&H00FFFF&}on behalf of the poor...

811
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:32,843
{\1c&H00FFFF&}of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me informed...

812
01:21:32,926 --> 01:21:35,801
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I gratefully thank you.

813
01:21:35,885 --> 01:21:37,510
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Signed, Victoria."

814
01:21:42,593 --> 01:21:46,968
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sure I can count on you
gentlemen to do the Christian thing.

815
01:21:47,051 --> 01:21:50,676
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you very much, ma'am. I'm sure we shall all try.

816
01:21:51,926 --> 01:21:54,551
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Gentlemen, I wish to move that Mr. John Merrick...

817
01:21:54,635 --> 01:21:57,051
{\1c&H00FFFF&}be admitted to this hospital on a permanent basis...

818
01:21:57,135 --> 01:22:00,343
{\1c&H00FFFF&}provided the hospital receives a yearly sum...

819
01:22:00,426 --> 01:22:03,135
{\1c&H00FFFF&}equal to the cost of the occupation of one bed.

820
01:22:03,843 --> 01:22:06,051
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All those in favor?

821
01:22:17,676 --> 01:22:20,718
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you, gentlemen. The motion is carried.

822
01:22:26,885 --> 01:22:29,259
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. Come in!

823
01:22:34,718 --> 01:22:36,301
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good afternoon.

824
01:22:37,926 --> 01:22:40,759
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Carr Gomm has something he wants to say to you.

825
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:43,259
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Merrick, I have very great pleasure...

826
01:22:43,343 --> 01:22:46,093
{\1c&H00FFFF&}in being able to welcome you officially...

827
01:22:46,176 --> 01:22:47,926
{\1c&H00FFFF&}to the London Hospital.

828
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:50,676
{\1c&H00FFFF&}This morning, the governing committee unanimously voted...

829
01:22:50,759 --> 01:22:54,926
{\1c&H00FFFF&}that you should be provided with
these rooms on a permanent basis.

830
01:22:54,968 --> 01:22:57,218
{\1c&H00FFFF&}This is your home now.

831
01:22:57,259 --> 01:22:59,593
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm so very, very glad for you.

832
01:22:59,634 --> 01:23:01,968
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Welcome home, lad.

833
01:23:06,176 --> 01:23:07,759
{\1c&H00FFFF&}This is...

834
01:23:09,801 --> 01:23:11,259
{\1c&H00FFFF&}my home?

835
01:23:11,301 --> 01:23:12,468
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.

836
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:17,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, will you thank the governing committee for me?

837
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:19,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I will do my utmost...

838
01:23:19,593 --> 01:23:22,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}to merit their kindness.

839
01:23:23,134 --> 01:23:25,218
{\1c&H00FFFF&}This...

840
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:27,468
{\1c&H00FFFF&}is my home?

841
01:23:28,551 --> 01:23:30,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. This as well.

842
01:23:37,843 --> 01:23:39,176
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Your dressing case.

843
01:23:48,343 --> 01:23:49,926
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, thank you.

844
01:23:56,551 --> 01:23:58,468
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thanks, all my friends.

845
01:23:58,551 --> 01:24:00,759
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

846
01:24:00,843 --> 01:24:04,051
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- You like it?
- Oh, my friends.

847
01:24:09,593 --> 01:24:11,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, my friends.

848
01:24:14,051 --> 01:24:16,551
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, thank you.

849
01:24:41,218 --> 01:24:43,634
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Who's next?
- I say.

850
01:24:45,051 --> 01:24:47,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- What, you again?
- Yeah, but...

851
01:24:47,593 --> 01:24:50,926
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But these young ladies have never seen it.

852
01:24:54,218 --> 01:24:55,801
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You're on, mate.

853
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:01,718
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, that's it for this performance.

854
01:25:01,759 --> 01:25:05,218
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Jim, can I go tonight?
- Sit down, Charlie.

855
01:25:06,593 --> 01:25:08,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There's always tomorrow. Don't worry.

856
01:25:12,218 --> 01:25:14,718
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Room for one more?

857
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:16,759
{\1c&H00FFFF&}At the right price.

858
01:25:18,634 --> 01:25:20,134
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There's room.

859
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:34,551
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, all right! Keep the noise down!

860
01:25:37,051 --> 01:25:39,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We don't want to frighten him, do we?

861
01:26:13,967 --> 01:26:16,301
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello. My name...

862
01:26:16,384 --> 01:26:20,592
{\1c&H00FFFF&}is John Merrick...

863
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:24,926
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and I'm very, very pleased...

864
01:26:24,967 --> 01:26:27,426
{\1c&H00FFFF&}to meet you.

865
01:26:31,551 --> 01:26:34,176
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I think you are...

866
01:26:34,259 --> 01:26:37,259
{\1c&H00FFFF&}very beautiful...

867
01:26:40,842 --> 01:26:43,426
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Curtain time!

868
01:26:43,509 --> 01:26:47,051
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You look beautiful, darling.
I wouldn't change a thing.

869
01:26:48,176 --> 01:26:50,426
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You look like the bleedin' Prince of Wales.

870
01:26:52,426 --> 01:26:54,342
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Here, my friends...

871
01:26:55,884 --> 01:26:57,592
{\1c&H00FFFF&}is the Elephant Man!

872
01:27:00,717 --> 01:27:04,134
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I told you he was horrible.

873
01:27:04,217 --> 01:27:05,801
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Just horrible.

874
01:27:15,259 --> 01:27:18,384
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Perhaps the ladies would like a closer look?

875
01:27:18,426 --> 01:27:22,009
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah, yeah.
- No, Jack!

876
01:27:26,092 --> 01:27:27,676
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There.

877
01:27:29,967 --> 01:27:33,134
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He's quite a ladies' man, isn't he?

878
01:27:33,217 --> 01:27:37,217
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on. Give the ladies' man a little kiss, eh?

879
01:27:38,551 --> 01:27:40,759
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on. Give him a kiss.

880
01:27:40,862 --> 01:27:41,628
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

881
01:27:52,759 --> 01:27:55,509
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Here, here, here! That's enough romance.

882
01:27:55,592 --> 01:27:57,176
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Time for beddy-byes.

883
01:28:47,551 --> 01:28:49,467
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, all right. Keep the noise down.

884
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:52,092
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, keep it quiet. Quiet! Hey!

885
01:28:52,176 --> 01:28:54,134
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Keep it quiet. Now, watch this.

886
01:29:38,759 --> 01:29:41,384
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, that's enough! That's enough!

887
01:29:41,425 --> 01:29:43,634
{\1c&H00FFFF&}That's it. The show's over.

888
01:29:43,717 --> 01:29:45,634
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll see you back at the Peacock.

889
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,467
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Get out of here.

890
01:30:17,509 --> 01:30:19,092
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Here.

891
01:30:20,259 --> 01:30:21,842
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on.

892
01:30:24,759 --> 01:30:27,675
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There you are. That's better, isn't it?

893
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,050
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I've done well tonight.

894
01:30:33,134 --> 01:30:36,134
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Here. Buy yourself a sweet.

895
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:04,842
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My treasure.

896
01:32:08,628 --> 01:32:09,695
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

897
01:32:14,378 --> 01:32:15,345
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

898
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:23,537
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Treves

899
01:32:23,925 --> 01:32:27,050
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- I know what happened last night.
- What?

900
01:32:35,634 --> 01:32:37,842
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Dear God.

901
01:32:37,842 --> 01:32:39,592
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Boy!

902
01:32:56,842 --> 01:33:00,883
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Where is he? Where's Mr. Merrick?

903
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,967
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Where is he? Where's Mr. Merrick?

904
01:33:11,092 --> 01:33:13,967
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Don't lie to me!

905
01:33:15,383 --> 01:33:18,633
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I know all about it. You were seen.

906
01:33:18,717 --> 01:33:20,633
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You're involved with Bytes, aren't you?

907
01:33:20,717 --> 01:33:23,592
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You've taken him. Where is he?

908
01:33:23,633 --> 01:33:26,592
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, wait a minute. I haven't taken him anywhere.

909
01:33:26,675 --> 01:33:30,217
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know no Bytes.
We were just having a bit of fun.

910
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,300
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We never hurt him.

911
01:33:32,383 --> 01:33:34,300
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, just having a laugh, that's all.

912
01:33:34,383 --> 01:33:37,508
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You bastard! He's gone!

913
01:33:37,592 --> 01:33:39,925
{\1c&H00FFFF&}When I left him, he was in bed safe and sound!

914
01:33:39,967 --> 01:33:43,258
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You bastard! You bastard!

915
01:33:43,342 --> 01:33:46,967
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You're not listening to me!
I told you, I don't know no Bytes!

916
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:48,842
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I ain't done nothing wrong.

917
01:33:48,925 --> 01:33:52,633
{\1c&H00FFFF&}People pay money to see your monster. I collect it.

918
01:33:52,717 --> 01:33:54,883
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You're the monster! You're the freak!

919
01:33:54,925 --> 01:33:57,050
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, get out! You're finished!

920
01:33:57,092 --> 01:34:00,592
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't frighten me,
you and your bleedin' Elephant Man.

921
01:34:02,133 --> 01:34:05,342
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm glad what I done,
and you can do nothing about it.

922
01:34:05,425 --> 01:34:07,633
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Only Mothershead can sack me now!

923
01:34:13,425 --> 01:34:15,050
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Done.

924
01:34:31,758 --> 01:34:33,717
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There's something I'd like to tell you, Treves.

925
01:34:34,883 --> 01:34:38,717
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, I felt as deeply as you did about John.

926
01:34:38,758 --> 01:34:40,508
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, now he's disappeared...

927
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:42,800
{\1c&H00FFFF&}very likely to the continent.

928
01:34:42,883 --> 01:34:45,092
{\1c&H00FFFF&}There's no question of your going after him.

929
01:34:45,175 --> 01:34:48,175
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You're desperately needed here by your patients.

930
01:34:48,258 --> 01:34:51,092
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You did everything in your power.

931
01:34:51,133 --> 01:34:53,175
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Remember that, Treves.

932
01:34:53,258 --> 01:34:55,175
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Everything in your power.

933
01:36:24,717 --> 01:36:26,300
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Get the stool.

934
01:36:53,008 --> 01:36:54,550
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Get up, you bastard.

935
01:37:20,383 --> 01:37:24,133
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Look at all these beautiful animals.

936
01:37:28,633 --> 01:37:31,091
{\1c&H00FFFF&}What a lot you have.

937
01:37:43,091 --> 01:37:45,591
{\1c&H00FFFF&}That sly bastard.

938
01:37:50,591 --> 01:37:53,841
{\1c&H00FFFF&}He's doing this to spite me!

939
01:38:03,841 --> 01:38:06,258
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You're doing this to spite me...

940
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,258
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and it's got to stop!

941
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:10,800
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Bytes, he's sick!

942
01:38:10,883 --> 01:38:12,800
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Let him die!

943
01:38:14,925 --> 01:38:17,675
{\1c&H00FFFF&}But don't think I'm going to bury that...

944
01:38:20,091 --> 01:38:21,758
{\1c&H00FFFF&}bag of flesh!

945
01:38:21,841 --> 01:38:23,425
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Wrong!

946
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:32,466
{\1c&H00FFFF&}As a matter of fact...

947
01:38:39,091 --> 01:38:41,716
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Bytes, no!
- As a matter of fact...

948
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,758
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Bytes, stop, please!

949
01:39:29,633 --> 01:39:32,133
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Bytes, please, don't!

950
01:40:38,508 --> 01:40:40,091
{\1c&H00FFFF&}We've decided...

951
01:40:43,341 --> 01:40:45,258
{\1c&H00FFFF&}we're gonna get you out of here.

952
01:40:45,341 --> 01:40:47,466
{\1c&H00FFFF&}All right?

953
01:41:13,924 --> 01:41:15,841
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good on you, mate. Good on you.

954
01:42:35,508 --> 01:42:36,924
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Luck, my friend.

955
01:42:39,591 --> 01:42:42,841
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Luck. And who needs it more than we?

956
01:44:10,466 --> 01:44:12,549
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, mister.

957
01:44:13,882 --> 01:44:16,966
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mister, why is your head so big?

958
01:44:21,091 --> 01:44:23,049
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why is your head so big, mister?

959
01:44:26,341 --> 01:44:29,382
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why is your head so big? Why won't you answer me?

960
01:44:35,757 --> 01:44:37,674
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Why is your head so big, mister?

961
01:45:05,924 --> 01:45:07,882
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop him!

962
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:04,545
{\1c&H00FFFF&}

963
01:46:05,091 --> 01:46:08,091
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I am not an animal!

964
01:46:09,966 --> 01:46:12,882
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I am not an animal!

965
01:46:15,591 --> 01:46:19,216
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I am a human being!

966
01:46:24,591 --> 01:46:27,424
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I am...

967
01:46:27,466 --> 01:46:29,424
{\1c&H00FFFF&}a man!

968
01:46:34,466 --> 01:46:36,424
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Excuse me, sir.

969
01:46:36,507 --> 01:46:38,966
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Out of the way, sir. Excuse me.

970
01:46:41,966 --> 01:46:45,257
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Treves, sir! They found him!

971
01:46:45,341 --> 01:46:47,882
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I think they found John!

972
01:46:59,382 --> 01:47:00,965
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

973
01:47:08,257 --> 01:47:10,965
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Keep still, girl.
- Sorry.

974
01:47:12,507 --> 01:47:16,132
{\1c&H00FFFF&}That was very nice of Mrs. Kendal
to give me this dress for tonight.

975
01:47:16,215 --> 01:47:17,799
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's so beautiful.

976
01:47:21,257 --> 01:47:24,049
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Does Mrs. Kendal know that John is dying?

977
01:47:28,424 --> 01:47:29,882
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, she knows.

978
01:47:44,965 --> 01:47:47,424
{\1c&H00FFFF&}How do I look?

979
01:47:47,507 --> 01:47:49,132
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Splendid.

980
01:47:49,215 --> 01:47:53,299
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, you will not look out of place.
You look absolutely splendid.

981
01:47:53,382 --> 01:47:57,257
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- Oh, splendid. Shall we go?
- Yes.

982
01:47:58,299 --> 01:47:59,882
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Again...

983
01:47:59,924 --> 01:48:03,965
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't tell you how sorry I am for what happened.

984
01:48:04,049 --> 01:48:07,549
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You see, I had no idea, really.

985
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:10,382
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, you mustn't blame yourself.

986
01:48:10,424 --> 01:48:15,049
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mr. Treves, don't worry about me...

987
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:17,257
{\1c&H00FFFF&}my friend.

988
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:22,882
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I am happy every hour of the day.

989
01:48:22,882 --> 01:48:27,465
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My life is full because I know that I am loved.

990
01:48:31,299 --> 01:48:34,090
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I have gained myself.

991
01:48:42,424 --> 01:48:46,090
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I could not say that...

992
01:48:46,174 --> 01:48:48,215
{\1c&H00FFFF&}were it not for you.

993
01:48:52,382 --> 01:48:55,757
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, and l...

994
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:59,715
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You've done so much for me as well.

995
01:48:59,757 --> 01:49:01,382
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

996
01:49:03,715 --> 01:49:05,257
{\1c&H00FFFF&}So...

997
01:49:06,424 --> 01:49:08,382
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead and Nora...

998
01:49:08,424 --> 01:49:11,007
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and be back in a few minutes.

999
01:49:13,424 --> 01:49:15,382
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Very good, my friend.

1000
01:49:19,965 --> 01:49:21,924
{\1c&H00FFFF&}My friend.

1001
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:19,840
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Mrs. Kendal.

1002
01:52:22,757 --> 01:52:24,923
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.

1003
01:52:25,007 --> 01:52:26,923
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Your Royal Highness...

1004
01:52:27,007 --> 01:52:28,757
{\1c&H00FFFF&}ladies and gentlemen...

1005
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,340
{\1c&H00FFFF&}tonight's performance was very special to me...

1006
01:52:31,423 --> 01:52:33,923
{\1c&H00FFFF&}because it was very special to someone else.

1007
01:52:34,007 --> 01:52:37,048
{\1c&H00FFFF&}A man who knows the theater and who loves the theater...

1008
01:52:37,090 --> 01:52:40,048
{\1c&H00FFFF&}and yet this is the very first time he's ever been here.

1009
01:52:41,257 --> 01:52:43,048
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I wish to dedicate...

1010
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:46,007
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The whole company wishes to dedicate with all their hearts...

1011
01:52:46,090 --> 01:52:48,507
{\1c&H00FFFF&}tonight's performance...

1012
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:50,548
{\1c&H00FFFF&}to Mr. John Merrick...

1013
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:52,590
{\1c&H00FFFF&}my very dear friend.

1014
01:53:04,965 --> 01:53:07,923
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Stand up. They want to see you.

1015
01:53:08,007 --> 01:53:10,798
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Go on. It's all right. Just stand up.

1016
01:53:10,882 --> 01:53:12,798
{\1c&H00FFFF&}They want to see you.

1017
01:53:49,215 --> 01:53:53,132
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I really did believe that...

1018
01:53:53,215 --> 01:53:56,840
{\1c&H00FFFF&}the ogre would never get out of the dungeon.

1019
01:53:58,631 --> 01:54:02,131
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good. So you really enjoyed yourself?

1020
01:54:04,923 --> 01:54:06,506
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It was wonderful!

1021
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:11,381
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good. Then we must go again some evening.

1022
01:54:11,423 --> 01:54:14,548
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, yes. Oh, I hope so.

1023
01:54:14,631 --> 01:54:16,673
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, we will. We will.

1024
01:54:18,215 --> 01:54:20,590
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good. I'm pleased.

1025
01:54:20,631 --> 01:54:24,465
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I ought to go.

1026
01:54:24,548 --> 01:54:28,840
{\1c&H00FFFF&}You must get some sleep. Good night, and sleep well.

1027
01:54:31,048 --> 01:54:34,840
{\1c&H00FFFF&}- And you too, my friend.
- Yes.

1028
01:54:34,923 --> 01:54:37,381
{\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm so pleased you enjoyed yourself.

1029
01:54:37,423 --> 01:54:39,548
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good night.

1030
01:54:43,006 --> 01:54:44,590
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Good night.

1031
01:56:16,881 --> 01:56:18,423
{\1c&H00FFFF&}It's finished.

1032
01:59:49,673 --> 01:59:54,006
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Never, oh, never nothing will die.

1033
01:59:54,048 --> 01:59:58,381
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The stream flows, the wind blows.

1034
01:59:58,423 --> 02:00:02,381
{\1c&H00FFFF&}The cloud fleets, the heart beats.

1035
02:00:23,756 --> 02:00:25,923
{\1c&H00FFFF&}Nothing will die.
