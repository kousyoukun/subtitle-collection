1
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,288
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn’t pay his debts?

2
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,249
His boots catch fire!

3
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,711
Why do you howl...

4
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:08,422
when it is I who am bitten?

5
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:11,425
-What am I, Mr. Lambert?
-Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

6
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,427
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

7
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,514
12 pounds, 1 schilling and 4 pence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

8
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:18,432
-Aaah! I can pay you!
-When?

9
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:21,685
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
Oh, for pity’s sake!

10
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,938
Take them out.

11
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:25,940
Where will you find...

12
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:27,983
16 pounds, 5 schillings and 9 pence...

13
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:30,027
Including interest, in 3 weeks?

14
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:32,780
-I have a wonderful new play.
-Put them back in.

15
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,823
-It’s a comedy!
-Cut off his nose.

16
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:37,743
It’s a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

17
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,455
-And his ears.
-And a share!

18
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:43,707
We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!

19
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,002
Partners?

20
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:53,300
It’s a crowd-tickler.

21
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:56,679
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

22
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,890
-A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
-I think I've seen it.

23
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,642
I didn’t like it.

24
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:05,437
-But this time it is by Shakespeare.
-What’s it called?

25
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:08,315
"Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate’s Daughter".

26
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:10,484
Good title.

27
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:13,988
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

28
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:16,365
Let’s say we open in 2 weeks.

29
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,993
That’s, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

30
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:22,663
In addition, 400 backsides at
three pence, a penny extra for cushions.

31
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:24,665
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

32
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:28,586
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees?

33
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:31,714
-20 pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
-Correct.

34
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,925
-But I have to pay the actors and the author.
-Share of the profits.

35
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:37,428
-There’s never any...
-Of course not.

36
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:41,974
Mr. Fennyman, I think you
might have hit upon something.

37
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:43,893
Sign there.

38
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:51,859
So, "Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate’s Daughter".

39
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:53,861
Almost finished?

40
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,448
Without doubt he’s completing
it at this very moment.

41
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:38,739
<b><u>Subtitles by ADONI@</u></b>

42
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,592
Will. Will!

43
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:01,178
Where is my play?

44
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:04,515
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

45
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:07,977
<i>Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.</i>

46
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:10,771
No, no, we haven’t the time.
Talk prose.

47
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:12,731
Where is my play?

48
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:15,442
-It is all locked safe in here.
-God be praised.

49
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,319
Locked?

50
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:20,823
-As soon as I find my muse.
-Who is she this time?

51
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:22,741
She is always Aphrodite.

52
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:25,661
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet?

53
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,747
Henslowe, you have no soul...

54
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:32,585
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

55
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:34,503
Ow! Will!

56
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:37,506
I am a dead man and buggered to boot.

57
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,092
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

58
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:43,095
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

59
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:46,098
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain’s
Men are invited to court...

60
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:49,101
and receive 10 pounds
to play your piece...

61
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:52,104
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

62
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:54,106
when you were green and grateful.

63
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:57,109
-What piece? "Richard Crookback"?
-No! It's comedy they want.

64
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:59,028
Like "Romeo and Ethel".

65
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:02,114
-Who wrote that?
-Nobody. You were writing it for me.

66
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:05,117
-I gave you 3 pound a month since.
-Half what you owe me.

67
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:07,536
I'm still due for
"One Gentleman of Verona".

68
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:11,040
What is money to you and me?
I, your patron, you, my word Wright.

69
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,958
When the plague lifts...

70
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:16,045
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the "Curtain".

71
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:18,047
-I will have nothing for the "Rose".
-Mr. Henslowe.

72
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:20,716
-Will you lend me 50 pounds?
-50 pounds? What for?

73
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:23,052
Burbage offers me a partnership
in the Chamberlain’s Men.

74
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:27,014
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

75
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:29,934
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

76
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:31,936
No, then?

77
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,980
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

78
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:39,693
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

79
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:44,281
And the "Rose" smells
thusly rank by any name!

80
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:48,994
I say, a plague on both their houses!

81
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,996
Where are you going?

82
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,165
My weekly confession.

83
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:01,257
Words, words, words.

84
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,759
Once, I had the gift.

85
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:07,847
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

86
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:09,849
Love that overthrows empires.

87
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:13,352
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

88
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:17,273
For sixpence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

89
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:20,776
-But now...
-And yet you tell me you lie with women.

90
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:25,197
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe...

91
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:29,410
Rosaline, Borage’s seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind...

92
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,204
Yes, now and again.
What of it?

93
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,956
I have lost my gift.

94
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:36,417
I am here to help you.

95
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,919
Tell me, in your own words.

96
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:46,510
It’s as if my quill is broken...

97
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:50,514
as if the organ of my imagination
has dried up...

98
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,268
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

99
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:55,853
Interesting.

100
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:58,063
-Nothing comes.
-Most interesting.

101
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:02,568
It’s like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

102
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:08,032
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

103
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:11,785
How long has it been?

104
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:16,040
A goodly length in times past,
but lately...

105
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,460
No, no.
You have a wife, children?

106
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:24,298
Aye.

107
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:29,929
I was a lad of 18. Anne Hathaway
was a woman half as old again.

108
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:32,973
-A woman of property?
-She had a cottage.

109
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:36,435
One day she was 3 months
gone with child, so...

110
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:37,853
And your relations?

111
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:41,649
-On my mother’s side, the Ardens.
-No, your marriage bed.

112
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:45,236
4 years and a 100 miles away
in Stratford.

113
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:49,114
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

114
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:51,116
Banishment was a blessing.

115
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,372
-So, now you are free to love...
-Yet cannot love, nor write it.

116
00:08:57,498 --> 00:09:01,335
Here is a... a bangle...

117
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:04,922
found in Psyche’s temple
on Olympus.

118
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,299
Cheap at 4 pence.

119
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:12,304
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

120
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:14,390
Will it restore my gift?

121
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,893
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

122
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:21,105
Words will flow like a river.

123
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:23,274
See you next week.

124
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:27,736
-Now where?
-To the palace at Whitehall.

125
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,115
All right.

126
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,618
Hello, Will.

127
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:37,746
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

128
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,709
-You too, good Crab.
-Crab’s nervous. He’s never played the palace.

129
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,211
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will?

130
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:47,631
-I could do it.
-No, they'd laugh at Seneca if you played it.

131
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:50,968
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

132
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:54,138
-How goes it, Will?
-I’m still owed money for this play...

133
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,348
-Burbage.
-Not by me. I only stole it.

134
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:58,976
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

135
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:01,395
Where were my seamstress' eyes?

136
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:04,231
When are you coming over
to the Chamberlain’s Men?

137
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,441
When I have £50.

138
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:08,944
-You writing?
-A comedy. All but done.

139
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:10,821
A pirate comedy.

140
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:12,615
-Wonderful.
-Bring it tomorrow.

141
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:15,034
-It’s for Henslowe. He paid me.
-How much?

142
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:16,410
-£10.
-You’re a liar.

143
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:20,289
He wants Romeo for Ned
and the Admiral’s Men.

144
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:22,082
Mmm. Ned’s wrong for it.

145
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:24,543
Will?

146
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:27,880
Here’s 2 sovereigns. I'll give
you another 2 when I see the pages.

147
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:29,965
-Done.
-Burbage, I will see you hanged...

148
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:32,092
-for a pickpocket.
-The queen has commanded it.

149
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:35,679
She loves a comedy. And
the Master of the Revels favours us.

150
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:38,724
And what favour does Mr. Tilney
receive from you?

151
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:40,684
-Ask him.
-She comes!

152
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:09,547
<i>Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.</i>

153
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,841
<i>Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,</i>

154
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:15,845
<i>were it not affection
chains thy tender days...</i>

155
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:20,182
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

156
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:23,727
-I’ve lost my gift.
-You left it in my bed.

157
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:25,604
Come to look for it again.

158
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:35,447
Are you to be my muse, Rosaline?

159
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:38,617
Burbage has my keeping...

160
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,786
but you have my heart.

161
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,374
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

162
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:47,376
Will Shakespeare has a play.

163
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,795
Let’s go and cough through it.

164
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:54,884
<i>My father weeping,
my mother wailing...</i>

165
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:59,638
<i>our maid howling,
our cat wringing her hands.</i>

166
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:03,100
<i>Yet did not this coldhearted cur...</i>

167
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:06,103
<i>shed one tear...</i>

168
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:20,951
You see?
Comedy.

169
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:27,166
Love, and a bit with a dog.
That’s what they want.

170
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:39,094
<i>He is a stone, a very pebble stone,</i>

171
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:43,182
<i>and has no more pity in him
than a dog!</i>

172
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:46,268
<i>A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.</i>

173
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:51,148
<i>Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word...</i>

174
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:53,734
Well played, Master Crab!

175
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:57,863
I commend you!

176
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:03,494
<i>What light is light...</i>

177
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:06,038
<i>if Silvia be not seen?</i>

178
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:09,208
<i>What joy is joy...</i>

179
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,544
<i>if Silvia be not by?</i>

180
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:14,547
<i>Unless it be to think that she is by...</i>

181
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,551
<i>and feed upon the shadow of perfection.</i>

182
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:23,055
<i>Except I be by Silvia
in the night,</i>

183
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:26,600
<i>there is no music
in the nightingale.</i>

184
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,603
<i>Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,</i>

185
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:33,148
<i>there is no day for me to look upon.</i>

186
00:13:56,505 --> 00:14:00,134
Did you like Proteus
or Valentine best?

187
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:03,137
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

188
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:05,639
Oh, I liked the dog for laughs.

189
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,142
Silvia, I did not care for much.

190
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:10,144
His fingers were red
from fighting...

191
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:13,397
and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.

192
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,651
Stage love will never be true love
while the law of the land...

193
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:21,614
has our heroines being played
by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

194
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:24,783
-Oh, when can we see another?
-When the queen commands it.

195
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:26,702
No, but at the playhouse. Nurse!

196
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:30,664
Be still. Playhouses are not
for wellborn ladies.

197
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,917
Oh! I’m not so wellborn.

198
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,503
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

199
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:38,005
and well-married
is more so.

200
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:40,424
Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.

201
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:43,010
All the men at court
are without poetry.

202
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,013
If they see me, they see
my father’s fortune.

203
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:49,600
I will have poetry in my life...

204
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:51,602
and adventure.

205
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:55,397
And love.
Love above all.

206
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:57,441
Like Valentine and Silvia?

207
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:01,362
No, not the artful postures of love...

208
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:05,449
but love that overthrows life.

209
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:09,203
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart...

210
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:13,707
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

211
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:17,378
Love as there has never been
in a play.

212
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:21,382
I will have love,
or I will end my days as...

213
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:23,384
As a nurse?

214
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:28,264
Oh, but I would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

215
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:32,601
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

216
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:36,689
I would stay asleep my whole life...

217
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:40,693
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

218
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:43,821
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

219
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:49,243
Now spit.

220
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:16,020
This time the boots are coming off.

221
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:17,438
What have I done?

222
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,607
The theaters have all been
closed down by the plague.

223
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:22,526
-Oh, that.
-By order of the Master of the Revels.

224
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,031
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

225
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:31,869
The natural condition is one of insurmountable
obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.

226
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:33,787
-So what do we do?
-Nothing.

227
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:36,665
Strangely enough,
it all turns out well.

228
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:40,211
-How?
-I don’t know. It’s a mystery.

229
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:42,630
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

230
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,507
The theaters are reopened...

231
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:48,302
by order of the Master of the Revels!

232
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:51,555
The theaters are reopened!

233
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:56,018
Mr. Fennyman, Mr. Tilney
has reopened the playhouses.

234
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:58,437
If you wouldn’t mind.

235
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:05,986
-Where’s the play?
-Oh, it’s coming. It’s coming.

236
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,533
It’s coming.

237
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:23,629
Will!

238
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:25,631
Will, I have wonderful news.

239
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:27,758
So have I.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

240
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:29,635
God, I’m good!

241
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,638
Rosaline?
You mean Ethel.

242
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:39,770
Richard?

243
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,482
Burbage!

244
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:51,574
Mr. Tilney.

245
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:55,327
Like you,
I found him not at home.

246
00:17:57,663 --> 00:18:00,541
I would’ve made you immortal.

247
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,589
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

248
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:09,258
What does Burbage care of that?

249
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:13,095
He’s readying the "Curtain"
for Kit Marlowe.

250
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,432
-You’ve opened the playhouses?
-I have, Master Shakespeare.

251
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:19,518
-But the plague...
-Yes, I know...

252
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:22,521
but he was always hanging around the house.

253
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:40,122
The special today is a pig’s foot
marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

254
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:42,082
served on a buckwheat pancake...

255
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:47,171
-Will! Have you finished?
-Yes, nearly.

256
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:49,924
Good morning, Master Nol.
You'll have a nice part.

257
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:53,260
-Yes!
-We’ll need Ralph for the pirate king.

258
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,554
Clear that bloody table!

259
00:18:55,554 --> 00:18:58,599
None other than the Admiral’s Men
are out on tour.

260
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,768
I need actors!

261
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:04,855
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

262
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:10,152
-What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
-It won’t cost you a penny! Ha ha ha!

263
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:11,987
Auditions in half an hour!

264
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:19,870
Ralph Bagswell,
I'd have a part for you...

265
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,206
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard’s drunkard.

266
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,416
Never when I’m working.

267
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,127
Never when I’m working!

268
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:32,424
-Get me to drink mandragora.
-Straight up, Will?

269
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:35,803
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

270
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:37,555
Kit.

271
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:41,016
-How goes it, Will?
-Wonderful. Wonderful.

272
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,229
-Burbage says you have a play.
-I have, and the chinks to show for it.

273
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:47,982
I insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

274
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:51,068
I hear you have a new play
for the "Curtain".

275
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,237
Not new.
My "Doctor Faustus".

276
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:56,031
Ah. I love your early work.

277
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,784
<i>Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...</i>

278
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:01,412
<i>and burnt the topless towers
of llium?"</i>

279
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:04,415
I have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

280
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:06,333
"The Massacre at Paris".

281
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,213
-Good title.
-Yours?

282
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:14,049
"Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate’s Daughter".

283
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:19,722
-Yes, I know. I know.
-What is the story?

284
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,850
Well, there’s this pirate...

285
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:28,355
In truth,
I have not written a word.

286
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:31,275
Romeo.

287
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:34,361
Romeo is Italian...

288
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:36,697
always in and out of love.

289
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,074
Yes, that’s good.
Until he meets...

290
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:41,410
-Ethel.
-Do you think?

291
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:44,038
-The daughter of his enemy.
-The daughter of his enemy.

292
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:46,332
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

293
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:49,919
by Ethel’s brother, or something.
His name is Mercutio.

294
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,837
Mercutio.
Good name.

295
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:55,341
-Will! They’re waiting for you!
-Yes, I’m coming.

296
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:58,177
Good luck with yours, Kit.

297
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,055
I thought your play
was for Burbage.

298
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,266
-This is a different one.
-A different one you haven’t written?

299
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:06,727
<i>Was this the face...</i>

300
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,355
<i>that launched a thousand ships...</i>

301
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:11,857
<i>and burnt the topless
towers of llium?</i>

302
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:13,442
Thank you!

303
00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:16,195
<i>Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...</i>

304
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:17,571
<i>And burnt the top-</i>

305
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:18,989
Thank you!

306
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:20,991
<i>Was this the face...</i>

307
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:24,662
<i>that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless towers...</i>

308
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:27,456
I would like to give you something
from Faustus...

309
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:29,834
-by Christopher Marlowe.
-How refreshing.

310
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,627
<i>...the topless towers of llium?</i>

311
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:34,755
<i>Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.</i>

312
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,052
<i>W- W- Was this the f...</i>

313
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:43,722
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

314
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,977
My tailor wants to be an actor.

315
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:51,814
I have a few debts here and there.
Well, that seems to be everybody.

316
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:54,275
-Did you see a "Romeo"?
-I did not.

317
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:57,027
Well, I to my work,
you to yours.

318
00:21:57,027 --> 00:21:59,989
Oh, God.

319
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:07,329
May I begin, sir?

320
00:22:07,955 --> 00:22:11,208
-Your name?
-Thomas Kent.

321
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:14,461
I would like to do a speech
by a writer...

322
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:16,881
who commands the heart of every player.

323
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:24,013
<i>What light is light...</i>

324
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:27,057
<i>if Silvia be not seen?</i>

325
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,688
<i>What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by?</i>

326
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:40,196
<i>Unless it be to think that she is by
and feed upon the shadow of perfection.</i>

327
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:46,577
<i>Except I be by Silvia
in the night...</i>

328
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,497
<i>there is no music
in the nightingale.</i>

329
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,044
<i>Unless I look on Silvia
in the day...</i>

330
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:59,006
<i>there is no day
for me to look upon.</i>

331
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,970
<i>She is my essence,
and I leave to be if I be not...</i>

332
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,806
-Take off your hat!
-My hat?

333
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:10,684
Where’d you learn how to do that?

334
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:13,103
-I...
-Let me see you. Take off your hat.

335
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:17,566
-Are you M-Master Shakespeare?
-Wait there. Wait there!

336
00:23:30,454 --> 00:23:34,041
-Will, w-where are the pages?
-Where is the boy?

337
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:40,130
B- B- B- Break a leg!

338
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:46,762
Sir, will you buy my sweet orange?

339
00:24:05,573 --> 00:24:06,866
Hey!

340
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:27,303
Everybody ready? All away!

341
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:31,849
-Follow that boat!
-Right you are, governor.

342
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:39,982
I know your face.
Are you an actor?

343
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:43,444
-Yes.
-Yes, I think I’ve seen you in something.

344
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:46,405
-That one about a king.
-Really?

345
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,075
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

346
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:05,508
-Do you know that house?
-Sir Robert De Lesseps.

347
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:19,647
Where is she?
Our guests are upon us!

348
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:23,567
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

349
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:26,654
My husband will have it settled tonight.

350
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:29,281
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

351
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:32,493
Tomorrow he drags me off to the country...

352
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:37,456
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

353
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:40,751
God save you, Mother.

354
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:43,754
Hot water, Nurse.

355
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:48,843
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

356
00:25:48,843 --> 00:25:50,803
-Who, sir?
-The actor.

357
00:25:50,845 --> 00:25:53,264
-Who asks for him?
-Will Shakespeare.

358
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:56,392
Poet, playwright of the "Rose".

359
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:57,768
Master Kent...

360
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:00,938
is my nephew.

361
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:02,940
I will wait.

362
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:05,442
Much good may it do you.

363
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:11,115
<i>"Romeo Montague...</i>

364
00:26:11,198 --> 00:26:13,158
<i>a Young Man of Verona".</i>

365
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,119
Verona again?

366
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:17,204
<i>"A comedy of quarreling families...</i>

367
00:26:17,204 --> 00:26:19,540
<i>"reconciled in the discovery
of Romeo...</i>

368
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,042
<i>"to be the very same Capulet cousin...</i>

369
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:25,921
<i>"stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...</i>

370
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:30,384
<i>"that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king".</i>

371
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,469
Your mother and your father...

372
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:35,472
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

373
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:38,809
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

374
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:41,437
-He looks well enough for a charlatan.
-Oh, Nurse!

375
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:44,899
He would give Thomas Kent the life
of Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

376
00:26:44,982 --> 00:26:47,484
My lady, when your parents return,
I will tell.

377
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:49,403
You will not tell.

378
00:26:49,486 --> 00:26:51,822
As I love you and you love me...

379
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:56,202
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy’s wig.

380
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:04,960
- Master Plum. What business here?
-The 5 schilling business, Will.

381
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,129
We play for the dancing.

382
00:27:26,357 --> 00:27:29,860
-I seek Master Thomas Kent.
-Musicians don’t eat.

383
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:32,112
Sir Robert’s orders.

384
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:34,907
She’s a beauty, my lord,
as would take...

385
00:27:34,907 --> 00:27:37,493
a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

386
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:41,372
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

387
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:44,041
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

388
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,043
when your grandson is a Wessex.

389
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:48,379
-Is she fertile?
-Oh, she will breed.

390
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:52,550
-If she do not, send her back.
-Is she obedient?

391
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:56,262
As any mule in Christendom.
But if you are the man to ride her...

392
00:27:56,345 --> 00:27:59,431
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

393
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,642
I like her.

394
00:28:21,537 --> 00:28:25,708
By all the stars in heaven.
Who is she?

395
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:29,253
Viola De Lesseps?
Dream on, Will.

396
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,835
Master Shakespeare.

397
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:19,512
-My lady Viola.
-My lord.

398
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,348
I have spoken with your father.

399
00:29:22,473 --> 00:29:25,809
So, my lord?
I speak with him every day.

400
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:45,079
Good sir.

401
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:48,832
I heard you were a poet.

402
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:54,463
A poet of no words?

403
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:01,679
Poet?

404
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:06,058
I was a poet till now, but I’ve seen
beauty that puts...

405
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:09,979
my poems at one with
the talking ravens in the Tower.

406
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,898
-How do I offend, my lord?
-By coveting my property.

407
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:15,734
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat...

408
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:18,153
anon.
Do you have a name?

409
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:21,031
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

410
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:47,558
Romeo! Romeo!

411
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:50,561
A Young Man of Verona.

412
00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:53,397
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

413
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,567
-My lady!
-Who is there?

414
00:30:57,651 --> 00:31:00,070
-Will Shakespeare.
-Madam!

415
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:03,324
Anon, good nurse,
anon.

416
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:07,786
-Master Shakespeare?
-The same, alas.

417
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:10,539
-But why alas?
-A lowly player.

418
00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:14,418
Alas, indeed, for I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

419
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:17,171
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

420
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:19,590
-I am him too.
-Madam!

421
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:22,593
Anon!
I will come again.

422
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:27,806
Oh, I am fortune’s fool.
I will be punished for this.

423
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:32,561
Oh, my lady, my love!

424
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:35,731
If they find you here, they will kill you.

425
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:39,610
-You can bring them with a word.
-Oh, not for the world.

426
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,780
-Madam!
-Anon!

427
00:32:41,881 --> 00:32:43,799
<i>Draw, if you be men!</i>

428
00:32:43,841 --> 00:32:45,926
<i>Gregory,
remember thy swashing blow!</i>

429
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:49,388
<i>Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.</i>

430
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:52,391
It starts well, then it’s all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

431
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:55,352
Where’s the comedy, Will?
Where’s the dog?

432
00:32:55,352 --> 00:32:56,854
Do you think it’s funny?

433
00:32:56,896 --> 00:33:00,357
I was a pirate king, now I’m a nurse.
That’s funny.

434
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,402
We are 6 men short, and those we
have will be over parted ranters...

435
00:33:03,402 --> 00:33:05,529
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

436
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:07,823
My Romeo’s let me down.
I see disaster.

437
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:10,451
We are 4 acts short,
if you’re looking for disaster.

438
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:13,287
-Sir!
-Who are you, master?

439
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:16,123
I’m Ethel, sir, the pirate’s daughter.

440
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:19,168
I'll be damned if you are!

441
00:33:20,836 --> 00:33:22,588
Your attention, please!

442
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:26,050
-Gentlemen, thank you!
-You are welcome.

443
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:28,802
-Who’s that?
-Nobody. He’s the author.

444
00:33:28,802 --> 00:33:31,889
We are about to embark on a great voyage.

445
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:35,434
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

446
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:37,978
It does no harm.
Authors like it.

447
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:41,398
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we...

448
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:43,317
I’ll do it.

449
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,819
Now listen to me, you dregs.

450
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,905
Actors are 10 a penny...

451
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:52,326
and I, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

452
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:53,994
Huzzah!

453
00:33:54,078 --> 00:33:57,665
The Admiral’s Men
are returned to the house!

454
00:33:57,748 --> 00:33:59,750
Huzzah!

455
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:01,794
Ned!

456
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,090
Henslowe!

457
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:08,092
Earl! Good to see you.

458
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:13,681
Who is this?

459
00:34:13,764 --> 00:34:16,225
Silence, you dog!

460
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:19,228
I am "Hieronimo".

461
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:23,607
I am "Tamburlaine".
I am "Faustus".

462
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:28,445
I am "Barabbas",
the Jew of Malta.

463
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:32,491
Oh, yes, Master Will.
I am "Henry the 6th".

464
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:36,537
What is the play,
and what is my part?

465
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,081
-Uh, one moment, sir...
-Who are you?

466
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:43,919
I’m, um... I’m the money.

467
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,131
Then you may remain,
so long as you remain silent.

468
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:51,051
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

469
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:53,512
-Thank you, sir.
-We are in desperate want...

470
00:34:53,512 --> 00:34:56,807
of a "Mercutio", Ned.
A young nobleman of Verona.

471
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:58,893
-And the title of this piece?
-"Mercutio".

472
00:34:58,893 --> 00:35:00,227
Is it?

473
00:35:01,562 --> 00:35:03,480
I will play him.

474
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:08,110
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

475
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:10,154
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

476
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:12,406
Sam, my pretty one!

477
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,160
-Are you ready to fall in love again?
-I am, Master Shakespeare.

478
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:18,454
Your voice.
Have they dropped?

479
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:20,915
No! No.
A touch of cold only.

480
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,753
Master Henslowe, you have your actors,
except Thomas Kent.

481
00:35:25,836 --> 00:35:28,297
I saw his "Tamburlaine", you know.

482
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,382
-It was wonderful.
-Yes, I saw it.

483
00:35:30,382 --> 00:35:32,384
Of course, such mighty writing.

484
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:35,054
There’s no one like Marlowe.

485
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,611
Better fortune, boy.

486
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:52,154
I was in a play.

487
00:35:52,446 --> 00:35:55,574
They cut my head off
in "Titus Andronicus".

488
00:35:55,616 --> 00:35:58,661
When I write plays,
they’ll be like "Titus".

489
00:35:58,744 --> 00:36:00,204
You admire it.

490
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:02,456
I liked it when they cut heads off,

491
00:36:02,456 --> 00:36:05,376
and the daughter mutilated with knives.

492
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:08,254
-What’s your name?
-John Webster.

493
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:09,630
Here, kitty, kitty.

494
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:16,303
Plenty of blood.

495
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:18,264
That’s the only writing.

496
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:21,767
I have to get back.

497
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:24,812
<i>See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.</i>

498
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:27,022
<i>I’ll know his grievance,
or be much denied.</i>

499
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:30,651
<i>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.</i>

500
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:31,986
Cut around him for now.

501
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:33,362
-What? Who?
-Romeo.

502
00:36:33,362 --> 00:36:35,364
-The one who came with your letter.
-What?

503
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:36,991
<i>Good morrow, cousin.</i>

504
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:40,619
<i>-Is the day so young?
-But new struck nine.</i>

505
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:42,872
<i>Ay me.
Sad hours seem long.</i>

506
00:36:42,913 --> 00:36:45,416
<i>What sadness
lengthens Romeo’s hours?</i>

507
00:36:45,457 --> 00:36:48,252
<i>Not having that which having
makes them short.</i>

508
00:36:48,294 --> 00:36:49,128
Good!

509
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,754
<i>-In love?
-Out.</i>

510
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:54,633
<i>-Of love?
-Out of her favour where I am in love.</i>

511
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:57,344
No, no, don’t spend it all at once.

512
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:00,181
Yes, sir.

513
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:02,933
-Do you understand me?
-No, sir.

514
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:06,353
You’re speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

515
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:09,690
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet?

516
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,775
-Juliet? You mean Ethel.
-God’s teeth!

517
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:15,196
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

518
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,952
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

519
00:37:21,952 --> 00:37:26,207
I’m very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

520
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:31,378
Of course you have not.
I have not written it. Go once more.

521
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:35,716
Will.
Where is Mercutio?

522
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:38,802
Locked safe in here. I’ll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

523
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:40,721
I have a sonnet to write.

524
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:42,890
Sonnet?
You mean a play!

525
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:52,775
<i>" For Lady Viola De Lesseps,
by the hand of Thomas Kent.</i>

526
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:57,071
<i>" Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</i>

527
00:37:57,112 --> 00:38:00,491
<i>" Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.</i>

528
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:05,538
<i>" Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May... "</i>

529
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,581
Two hours at prayer!

530
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:11,710
-Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
-Piety is for Sunday!

531
00:38:11,752 --> 00:38:14,839
And 2 hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

532
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,341
It would be better that you return
tomorrow, my lord.

533
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:20,177
It would be better if you’d tell her
to get off her knees and show...

534
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:23,305
some civility to her 6day
lord and master!

535
00:38:26,141 --> 00:38:27,226
Mmmph!

536
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,859
My lady Viola.

537
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:38,237
Lord Wessex.
You’ve been waiting.

538
00:38:38,237 --> 00:38:39,363
I am aware of it.

539
00:38:40,614 --> 00:38:42,992
But it is beauty’s privilege.

540
00:38:43,284 --> 00:38:44,702
You flatter, my lord.

541
00:38:44,785 --> 00:38:48,539
No. I have spoken to the queen.

542
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,626
Her Majesty’s consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife...

543
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:54,420
and once given,
her consent is her command.

544
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:56,964
Do you intend to marry, my lord?

545
00:38:57,047 --> 00:39:01,802
Your father should keep you better
informed. He has bought me for you.

546
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:06,974
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

547
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:09,643
You are allowed to show your pleasure.

548
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:13,647
But I do not love you, my lord.

549
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:16,483
How your mind hops about.

550
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,028
Your father was a shopkeeper.

551
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:22,072
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

552
00:39:22,072 --> 00:39:24,283
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

553
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:25,910
You will like Virginia.

554
00:39:25,993 --> 00:39:28,579
-Virginia?
-Oh, yes.

555
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:31,749
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

556
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,461
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

557
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:38,380
I fancy tobacco has a future.

558
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:41,425
We will not stay there long, 3-4 years.

559
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:45,930
-But why me?
-It was your eyes.

560
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:49,058
No, your lips.

561
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,613
Will you defy your father
and your queen?

562
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:04,615
The queen has consented?

563
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:06,534
She wants to inspect you.

564
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:09,203
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

565
00:40:09,286 --> 00:40:15,626
Be submissive, modest,
grateful and brief.

566
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:20,214
I will do my duty, my lord.

567
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:29,557
<i>"Master Will,
poet dearest to my heart...</i>

568
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,561
<i>I beseech you
banish me from yours.</i>

569
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:36,897
<i>I am to marry Lord Wessex.</i>

570
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:40,401
<i>A daughter’s duty...</i>

571
00:40:40,484 --> 00:40:42,903
<i>and the queen’s command".</i>

572
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:08,262
Gentlemen upstage, Ladies downstage.

573
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:13,851
Gentlemen upstage, Ladies downstage.

574
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:17,188
Are you a lady Mr. Kent?

575
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,023
I’m very sorry, sir.

576
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:24,528
We’re gonna have to do it again.

577
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:28,282
You did not like the speech?

578
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:30,367
No, the speech is excellent.

579
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:34,038
<i>Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.</i>

580
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:36,373
Excellent and a good length.

581
00:41:36,457 --> 00:41:40,836
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

582
00:41:42,004 --> 00:41:44,215
There. You have this duel.

583
00:41:44,298 --> 00:41:48,177
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

584
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:53,224
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

585
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:56,060
<i>A plague on both your houses!</i>

586
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:03,442
He dies?

587
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:08,989
-Ohh!
-Will!

588
00:42:09,114 --> 00:42:11,075
Where are my pages?

589
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:25,256
Did you give her my letter?

590
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:29,093
And this is for you!

591
00:42:42,022 --> 00:42:45,276
Oh, Thomas, she has cut my strings.

592
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:48,612
I’m unmanned...

593
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:51,824
unmended and unmade...

594
00:42:51,907 --> 00:42:53,784
like a puppet in a box.

595
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,620
-Writer, is he?
-Row your boat!

596
00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:00,541
She tells me to keep away.
She is to marry Lord Wessex!

597
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,001
What should I do?

598
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:04,587
If you love her,
you must do as she asks.

599
00:43:04,628 --> 00:43:07,756
-And break her heart and mine?
-It is only yours you can know.

600
00:43:07,756 --> 00:43:11,177
-She loves me, Thomas!
-Does she say so?

601
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:14,763
No, and yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

602
00:43:14,763 --> 00:43:18,142
-Was she weeping when she gave you this?
-Uh...

603
00:43:18,267 --> 00:43:21,562
-Her letter came to me by the nurse.
-Your aunt.

604
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:23,439
Yes, my aunt.

605
00:43:24,565 --> 00:43:26,942
But perhaps she wept a little.

606
00:43:29,236 --> 00:43:31,488
Tell me how you love her, Will.

607
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:35,576
Like a sickness and its cure together.

608
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:37,870
Oh, yes.

609
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:40,331
Like rain and sun.

610
00:43:40,414 --> 00:43:43,000
Like cold and heat.

611
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:46,545
Is your lady beautiful?

612
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:51,592
Since I came here from the country,
I have not seen her close.

613
00:43:51,675 --> 00:43:54,595
Tell me, is...
is she beautiful?

614
00:43:54,678 --> 00:43:58,474
Thomas, if I could write
with the beauty of her eyes...

615
00:43:58,474 --> 00:44:02,520
I was born to look in them
and know myself.

616
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:06,440
-A-A-And her lips?
-Her lips?

617
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:10,861
The early morning rose would wither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

618
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:13,614
And her voice,
like lark’s song?

619
00:44:13,614 --> 00:44:16,617
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

620
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:20,287
I would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

621
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:22,957
-Ah, she sings too?
-Constantly.

622
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,502
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

623
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:28,546
And her bosom.

624
00:44:28,629 --> 00:44:32,675
-Did I mention her bosom?
-What of her bosom?

625
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:35,386
Oh, Thomas, a pair of pippins...

626
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:38,389
as round and rare
as golden apples.

627
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,475
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

628
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:44,979
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

629
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:47,857
when her eyes and lips and voice...

630
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:50,860
may be no more beautiful than mine.

631
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:54,405
Besides, can a... can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

632
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:58,117
love happily with
a bank side poet and player?

633
00:44:58,117 --> 00:45:00,411
Yes, by God!

634
00:45:00,494 --> 00:45:03,330
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

635
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:06,584
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king...

636
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,086
an their love should be minded by each...

637
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:11,839
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

638
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,925
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

639
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:16,844
But what of Lord Wessex?

640
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:20,347
For one kiss I would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

641
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:30,274
Oh, Will.

642
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:33,360
Thank you, my lady.

643
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:36,864
Lady?

644
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:40,367
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

645
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:43,204
Wouldn’t deceive a child.

646
00:45:44,663 --> 00:45:48,959
Strangely enough,
I’m a bit of a writer me self.

647
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:51,712
It wouldn’t take you long to read it.

648
00:45:51,712 --> 00:45:54,423
I expect you’d know all the booksellers!

649
00:46:03,015 --> 00:46:05,017
Can you love a fool?

650
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:07,811
Can you love a player?

651
00:46:15,736 --> 00:46:18,197
Wait!
You’re still a maid...

652
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:21,408
and perhaps as mistook in me
as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

653
00:46:21,408 --> 00:46:24,245
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

654
00:46:24,245 --> 00:46:25,829
I am.

655
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:28,832
Then kiss me again,
for I am not mistook.

656
00:46:41,887 --> 00:46:44,807
I do not know how to undress a man.

657
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,892
It is strange to me too.

658
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:02,885
Go to.
Go to.

659
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,977
I would not have thought it.

660
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,190
There is something
better than a play.

661
00:48:16,273 --> 00:48:18,817
There is.

662
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,320
Even your play.

663
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:25,324
Oh?

664
00:48:26,659 --> 00:48:29,203
And that was only my first try.

665
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:47,638
Will.

666
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:52,434
You would not leave me.

667
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,520
I must.

668
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,772
Look how pale the window.

669
00:48:56,772 --> 00:48:58,649
Moonlight.

670
00:48:58,774 --> 00:49:01,610
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

671
00:49:01,735 --> 00:49:04,822
It was the owl.
Come to bed.

672
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:09,285
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

673
00:49:11,245 --> 00:49:13,122
Mr. Henslowe?

674
00:49:13,247 --> 00:49:15,666
Mmm, let him be damned for his pages.

675
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:17,626
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

676
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:20,629
There is time. Mmm!
It is still dark.

677
00:49:20,754 --> 00:49:23,716
-It’s broad day. The rooster tells us so.
-It was the owl.

678
00:49:23,757 --> 00:49:26,343
Believe me, love, it was the owl...

679
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:30,890
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

680
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:35,811
My lady?

681
00:49:35,936 --> 00:49:38,689
The house is stirring.
It is a new day.

682
00:49:39,773 --> 00:49:42,151
It is a new world.

683
00:49:42,276 --> 00:49:45,237
<i>Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...</i>

684
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:47,948
<i>which mannerly devotion
shows in this.</i>

685
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:51,243
<i>For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...</i>

686
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:54,663
<i>and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.</i>

687
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:58,459
<i>Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?</i>

688
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:00,461
<i>Aye, pilgrim.</i>

689
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:02,963
<i>Lips that they must use
in prayer.</i>

690
00:50:03,047 --> 00:50:06,300
<i>Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.</i>

691
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,219
<i>They pray.</i>

692
00:50:08,302 --> 00:50:11,722
<i>Grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.</i>

693
00:50:11,805 --> 00:50:15,226
<i>Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.</i>

694
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:20,189
-It’s you.
-Suffering cats!

695
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,654
<i>Then move not while
my prayer’s effect I take.</i>

696
00:50:30,991 --> 00:50:34,411
<i>Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.</i>

697
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:37,331
<i>Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.</i>

698
00:50:37,331 --> 00:50:42,169
<i>Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.</i>

699
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:44,797
Yes, yes!
Um, not quite right.

700
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,882
It is more...
Let me.

701
00:50:46,966 --> 00:50:49,927
<i>Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.</i>

702
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:55,057
<i>Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.</i>

703
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:03,399
-You kiss by the book.
-Well, Will!

704
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:05,484
It was lucky you were here.

705
00:51:05,568 --> 00:51:08,070
-Why do not I write the rest of your play...
-Yes, yes!

706
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:12,283
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph?

707
00:51:12,575 --> 00:51:16,245
<i>Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.</i>

708
00:51:18,038 --> 00:51:20,875
<i>-What is her mother?
-Marry, bachelor,</i>

709
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:23,544
<i>her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...</i>

710
00:51:23,544 --> 00:51:25,754
<i>and a wise and virtuous.</i>

711
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:28,841
<i>I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.</i>

712
00:51:28,841 --> 00:51:33,596
<i>I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks.</i>

713
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:35,764
<i>Is she a Capulet?</i>

714
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:39,935
<i>Oh, dear account!
My life is my foe’s debt.</i>

715
00:51:39,935 --> 00:51:42,730
<i>Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.</i>

716
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:45,900
<i>Aye, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.</i>

717
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:50,321
<i>Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman?</i>

718
00:51:50,404 --> 00:51:52,865
<i>The son and heir of old Tiberio.</i>

719
00:51:52,865 --> 00:51:55,201
Let it be night.

720
00:51:55,242 --> 00:51:58,746
<i>What’s he that follows
here that would not dance?</i>

721
00:51:58,746 --> 00:52:01,498
<i>-I know not.
-Go ask his name.</i>

722
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:06,754
<i>If he be married, my grave is like
to be my wedding bed.</i>

723
00:52:08,422 --> 00:52:09,840
No, do not go.

724
00:52:09,924 --> 00:52:11,842
I must. I must.

725
00:52:11,926 --> 00:52:15,179
<i>-The only son of your great enemy.
-Terrible.</i>

726
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:17,348
<i>Simply... terrible!</i>

727
00:52:23,771 --> 00:52:28,692
<i>But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?</i>

728
00:52:28,776 --> 00:52:33,572
<i>It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun.</i>

729
00:52:33,656 --> 00:52:38,202
<i>Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...</i>

730
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:41,288
<i>who is already sick
and pale with grief...</i>

731
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:45,835
<i>that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she".</i>

732
00:52:45,918 --> 00:52:48,671
-Oh, Will.
-Yes, some of it’s speak able.

733
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:51,632
<i>It is my lady.
Oh, it is my love!</i>

734
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:54,468
<i>Oh, that she knew she were!</i>

735
00:52:54,552 --> 00:52:58,138
<i>The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...</i>

736
00:52:58,222 --> 00:53:00,599
<i>as daylight doth a lamp".</i>

737
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:03,811
<i>Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...</i>

738
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:06,397
<i>stream so bright...</i>

739
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,609
<i>that birds would sing
and think it were not night.</i>

740
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:14,864
<i>See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.</i>

741
00:53:14,947 --> 00:53:17,867
<i>Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand...</i>

742
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:20,202
<i>that I might touch that cheek.</i>

743
00:53:20,286 --> 00:53:21,453
<i>Ay, me.</i>

744
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:25,541
<i>Oh, Romeo, Romeo!</i>

745
00:53:25,624 --> 00:53:28,210
<i>Wherefore art thou, Romeo?</i>

746
00:53:28,294 --> 00:53:31,922
<i>-Deny thy father and...
-and refuse thy name.</i>

747
00:53:32,006 --> 00:53:34,925
<i>Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...</i>

748
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:37,678
<i>and I’ll no longer be a Capulet.</i>

749
00:53:37,761 --> 00:53:40,681
<i>Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?</i>

750
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:44,685
<i>What man art thou that
thus be screened in night...</i>

751
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:47,396
<i>so stumblest on my counsel?"</i>

752
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:50,774
<i>By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.</i>

753
00:53:50,816 --> 00:53:55,571
<i>My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.</i>

754
00:53:55,571 --> 00:53:59,033
<i>Had I it written
I would tear the word.</i>

755
00:53:59,116 --> 00:54:03,454
<i>The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...</i>

756
00:54:03,537 --> 00:54:06,707
<i>and the place death,
considering who thou art...</i>

757
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,460
<i>if any of my kinsmen find thee here.</i>

758
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,505
<i>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</i>

759
00:54:12,588 --> 00:54:17,092
<i>Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.</i>

760
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:21,597
<i>Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.</i>

761
00:54:21,597 --> 00:54:23,974
<i>Would not for the world
they saw thee here.</i>

762
00:54:23,974 --> 00:54:26,977
<i>I have night’s cloak
to hide me from their eyes.</i>

763
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:30,481
<i>-And but thou love me let them find me here.
-Good night.</i>

764
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:32,525
<i>Good night...</i>

765
00:54:32,608 --> 00:54:35,569
<i>as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...</i>

766
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:37,947
<i>as that within my breast.</i>

767
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,324
<i>Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</i>

768
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:43,953
-That’s my line.
-Oh. It is mine too.

769
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:47,081
<i>Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</i>

770
00:54:47,122 --> 00:54:49,667
<i>What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?</i>

771
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,337
<i>The exchange of thy love’s
faithful vow for mine.</i>

772
00:54:53,379 --> 00:54:56,799
<i>My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.</i>

773
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:59,552
<i>My love is deep.</i>

774
00:54:59,635 --> 00:55:02,179
<i>The more I give to thee...</i>

775
00:55:02,263 --> 00:55:04,223
<i>the more I have...</i>

776
00:55:04,306 --> 00:55:06,392
<i>for both are infinite.</i>

777
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:08,853
Madam?

778
00:55:08,936 --> 00:55:13,065
<i>-I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
-Juliet!</i>

779
00:55:13,148 --> 00:55:14,942
Anon, good nurse.

780
00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:18,028
<i>Anon, good nurse
Sweet Montague, be true.</i>

781
00:55:18,153 --> 00:55:21,073
Stay but a little.
I will come again.

782
00:55:21,156 --> 00:55:24,076
<i>Stay but a little.
I will come again.</i>

783
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,537
<i>Oh, blessed, blessed night.</i>

784
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:30,207
<i>I am a feared...</i>

785
00:55:30,332 --> 00:55:34,712
<i>being in night,
all this is but a dream.</i>

786
00:55:34,837 --> 00:55:39,633
<i>Too flattering sweet
to be substantial.</i>

787
00:55:42,428 --> 00:55:45,431
<i>To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.</i>

788
00:55:45,431 --> 00:55:47,433
<i>A thousand times, good night.</i>

789
00:55:47,516 --> 00:55:50,019
<i>A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.</i>

790
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:53,898
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

791
00:55:53,898 --> 00:55:57,568
I have no neck in this pig dress.

792
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:04,533
-How is it?
-It’s all right.

793
00:56:08,454 --> 00:56:11,207
Ned, I know, I know.

794
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,210
-It’s good.
-Oh?

795
00:56:14,293 --> 00:56:17,046
The title won’t do.

796
00:56:17,129 --> 00:56:18,881
Ah.

797
00:56:18,964 --> 00:56:22,426
"Romeo and Juliet".
Just a suggestion.

798
00:56:23,636 --> 00:56:25,554
Thank you, Ned.

799
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:32,895
-You are a gentleman.
-And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

800
00:56:32,978 --> 00:56:35,773
<i>-What o’clock tomorrow shall I send to thee?
-By the hour of nine.</i>

801
00:56:35,773 --> 00:56:38,067
<i>I shall not fail.
"Tis 20 year till then.</i>

802
00:56:38,067 --> 00:56:40,236
<i>I have forgot why I called thee back.</i>

803
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,030
-You mean no dog of any kind?
-Shh! Silence.

804
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:48,452
The friar marries them in secret, then Ned
gets into a fight with one of the Capulets.

805
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:51,080
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned’s way.

806
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:52,748
I mean, in Mercutio's way.

807
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:56,210
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

808
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:58,587
Then the prince banishes him
from Verona.

809
00:56:58,587 --> 00:57:00,881
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

810
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:02,967
on the island of the pirate king.

811
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:06,846
For God’s sake, cease your prattling
and get out!

812
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:09,390
Get out!

813
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:13,978
A thousand apologies.

814
00:57:15,729 --> 00:57:18,482
Please.

815
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:21,402
<i>...and with a silken thread
plucks it back again...</i>

816
00:57:21,402 --> 00:57:23,737
<i>so loving-jealous
of his liberty.</i>

817
00:57:23,737 --> 00:57:26,365
<i>I would I were thy bird.</i>

818
00:57:26,365 --> 00:57:29,451
<i>-Sweet, so would I; yet I should
kill thee with much cherishing.</i>

819
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:33,038
<i>Good night.
Good night.</i>

820
00:57:33,122 --> 00:57:38,085
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.</i>

821
00:57:45,676 --> 00:57:48,470
Sunday.

822
00:57:48,554 --> 00:57:50,681
"Tis Sunday.

823
00:57:57,271 --> 00:58:00,232
I found something in my sleep.

824
00:58:00,316 --> 00:58:03,777
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

825
00:58:04,653 --> 00:58:08,574
-But it will end well for love.
-In heaven, perhaps.

826
00:58:08,616 --> 00:58:11,368
It is not a comedy I’m writing now.

827
00:58:13,204 --> 00:58:16,457
A broad river divides my lovers.

828
00:58:16,498 --> 00:58:20,002
Family, duty, fate.

829
00:58:22,296 --> 00:58:25,341
As unchangeable as nature.

830
00:58:25,424 --> 00:58:26,884
Yes.

831
00:58:28,344 --> 00:58:30,971
This is not life, Will.

832
00:58:31,472 --> 00:58:34,058
It is a stolen season.

833
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,227
Be patient, my lord.

834
00:58:36,227 --> 00:58:39,855
-Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
-My Lord, I will go...

835
00:58:39,855 --> 00:58:42,942
Sunday.
Greenwich!

836
00:58:46,445 --> 00:58:48,364
Now, pay attention, nursie.

837
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,950
The queen...
Gloriana Regina...

838
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:54,620
God’s chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us...

839
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,831
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening’s festivities...

840
00:58:57,831 --> 00:59:01,085
to bestow her gracious favour
on my choice of wife.

841
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:03,796
And if we’re late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

842
00:59:03,796 --> 00:59:08,050
So get you to my lady’s chamber and produce her
with or without her undergarments!

843
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,469
You cannot!
Not for the queen herself!

844
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:13,722
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

845
00:59:13,806 --> 00:59:15,975
To be the wife of a poor player?

846
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:20,437
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

847
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:24,275
And yet I would if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

848
00:59:24,316 --> 00:59:26,902
You follow your desire freely enough
in the night.

849
00:59:26,902 --> 00:59:30,281
-So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
-Then I’ll go with you.

850
00:59:30,322 --> 00:59:33,409
-You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
-I know how to fight.

851
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:35,494
Stage fighting.

852
00:59:36,036 --> 00:59:37,705
Oh, Will.

853
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,750
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you...

854
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:45,129
but as Viola,
the river divides us...

855
00:59:45,212 --> 00:59:49,300
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

856
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:52,303
I’ll drag her down
by the queen’s command!

857
00:59:55,222 --> 00:59:57,224
Good morning, my Lord.

858
00:59:57,308 --> 01:00:02,354
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

859
01:00:02,438 --> 01:00:05,983
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

860
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:08,527
Are you bringing your laundrywoman?

861
01:00:10,905 --> 01:00:13,699
Her chaperone,
my lady’s country cousin.

862
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:18,996
My, but you be a handsome gallant,
just as she said.

863
01:00:19,038 --> 01:00:21,123
You may call me Miss Wilhelmina.

864
01:00:21,165 --> 01:00:24,710
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps.

865
01:00:24,793 --> 01:00:27,630
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

866
01:00:27,713 --> 01:00:32,343
Aye, she never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

867
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:06,710
-Now?
-Now.

868
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:10,381
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

869
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,678
-Is there a man?
-A man, my lord?

870
01:01:15,678 --> 01:01:19,348
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, I think.

871
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:22,226
-Does he come to the house?
-A theater poet?

872
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:25,896
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

873
01:01:25,896 --> 01:01:28,190
-Has he been to the house?
-Marlowe?

874
01:01:28,274 --> 01:01:30,568
Oh, yes. He is the one.

875
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:34,154
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

876
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,949
That dog!

877
01:01:52,715 --> 01:01:54,717
Your Majesty.

878
01:01:55,968 --> 01:01:58,220
Stand up straight, girl.

879
01:02:01,891 --> 01:02:03,767
I’ve seen you.

880
01:02:03,893 --> 01:02:07,688
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

881
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:10,232
Your Majesty.

882
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,277
What do you love so much?

883
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:17,031
-Your Majesty...
-Speak up, girl, I know who I am!

884
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:20,784
Do you love stories
of kings and queens...

885
01:02:20,826 --> 01:02:25,414
of feats of arms,
or is it courtly love?

886
01:02:25,456 --> 01:02:27,458
I love theater.

887
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:30,794
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed...

888
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,507
They’re not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And?

889
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:40,679
-And I love poetry above all.
-Above Lord Wessex?

890
01:02:41,514 --> 01:02:45,809
My lord, when you cannot find your wife,
you better look for her at the playhouse.

891
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:51,106
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

892
01:02:51,148 --> 01:02:54,610
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

893
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:57,863
-They cannot make it true.
-Oh, but they can.

894
01:03:01,784 --> 01:03:06,956
I mean, Your Majesty, they...
they do not, they have... not...

895
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,834
but I believe
there is one who can.

896
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:14,797
My Lady Viola is young in the world.
Your Majesty is wise in it.

897
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:17,591
Nature and truth
are the very enemies of playacting.

898
01:03:17,633 --> 01:03:21,804
-I’ll wager my fortune.
-I thought you were here because you had none.

899
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:31,647
-Well, no one will take your wager, it seems.
-50 pounds.

900
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:36,193
50 pounds?

901
01:03:37,736 --> 01:03:42,658
A very worthy sum on a very worthy question.

902
01:03:42,741 --> 01:03:47,580
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

903
01:03:47,955 --> 01:03:51,208
I bear witness to the wager...

904
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:54,837
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

905
01:03:57,131 --> 01:03:59,842
I have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

906
01:04:00,759 --> 01:04:03,345
Are there no more fireworks?

907
01:04:03,429 --> 01:04:07,892
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola’s audience.

908
01:04:08,475 --> 01:04:11,645
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

909
01:04:11,729 --> 01:04:15,774
She’s been plucked since I saw her last,
and not by you.

910
01:04:15,774 --> 01:04:18,694
It takes a woman to know it.

911
01:04:22,323 --> 01:04:24,241
Marlowe.

912
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:37,087
Burbage?

913
01:04:37,171 --> 01:04:40,049
Huh? Who’s there?

914
01:04:40,132 --> 01:04:42,801
Marlowe.

915
01:04:44,345 --> 01:04:46,472
You are playing my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

916
01:04:46,472 --> 01:04:48,682
Don’t spend yourself in sport.

917
01:04:48,766 --> 01:04:52,436
-What do you want, Kit?
-My "Massacre at Paris" is complete.

918
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:55,814
-What? You have the last act?
-If you have the money.

919
01:04:55,814 --> 01:04:59,902
-Tomorrow.
-Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

920
01:04:59,985 --> 01:05:02,279
Oh, will you desist, madam!

921
01:05:02,363 --> 01:05:05,282
-Oh!
-20 pounds on delivery.

922
01:05:05,324 --> 01:05:08,661
Now, what is money to men like us?

923
01:05:09,578 --> 01:05:14,542
Besides, if I need a play, I have another
waiting... a comedy by Shakespeare.

924
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:16,502
Oh, "Romeo".

925
01:05:16,585 --> 01:05:19,797
-Gave it to Henslowe.
-Never!

926
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,967
Well, I’m to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

927
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:26,095
I gave Shakespeare
2 sovereigns for "Romeo".

928
01:05:26,178 --> 01:05:30,683
You did, but Ned Alleyn and the Admiral’s Men
have the playing of it at the "Rose".

929
01:05:30,683 --> 01:05:32,643
Treachery!

930
01:05:33,978 --> 01:05:36,230
Traitor and thief!

931
01:05:39,149 --> 01:05:41,402
Oh, no.

932
01:05:41,443 --> 01:05:43,487
No!

933
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:03,424
<i>By my head, here comes the Capulets.</i>

934
01:06:03,424 --> 01:06:06,343
<i>By my heel, I care not.</i>

935
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:09,805
<i>Follow me close.
I will speak with them.</i>

936
01:06:09,805 --> 01:06:12,892
<i>Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.</i>

937
01:06:12,933 --> 01:06:15,186
Are you going to do it like that?

938
01:06:15,269 --> 01:06:17,479
Positions.

939
01:06:17,563 --> 01:06:21,942
<i>-By my head, here comes the Capulets.
-By my heel, I care not.</i>

940
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:24,278
<i>Follow me close.
I will speak to them.</i>

941
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:27,239
<i>Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.</i>

942
01:06:27,489 --> 01:06:30,701
<i>And but one word with one of us?</i>

943
01:06:30,784 --> 01:06:33,621
<i>Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.</i>

944
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:37,458
Where’s that thieving hack that
can’t keep his pen in his own ink pot?

945
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,585
What is this rabble?

946
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:44,715
Draw, if you be a man!

947
01:07:07,738 --> 01:07:10,115
Wonderful.
Wonderful!

948
01:07:10,991 --> 01:07:14,411
And a dog.

949
01:07:15,996 --> 01:07:17,957
No!

950
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,293
Have privy, players! Please!

951
01:07:21,377 --> 01:07:24,255
Oh! Not with my props!

952
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:25,756
Oh!

953
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,759
-Will! What...
-A writer’s quarrel.

954
01:07:28,843 --> 01:07:31,220
Quite normal.

955
01:07:32,638 --> 01:07:34,765
Stay here.

956
01:07:47,486 --> 01:07:49,071
You are hurt.

957
01:08:02,042 --> 01:08:05,504
I dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

958
01:08:05,588 --> 01:08:10,509
-You were cast ashore in a far country.
-Oh, not yet. Not yet.

959
01:08:10,634 --> 01:08:13,679
Hey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

960
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:15,973
My investment!
Lambert!

961
01:08:17,433 --> 01:08:19,643
Vengeance!

962
01:08:47,129 --> 01:08:49,173
A famous victory!

963
01:08:49,298 --> 01:08:53,344
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house!

964
01:08:53,469 --> 01:08:55,554
Oh, what happy hour.

965
01:08:55,638 --> 01:08:58,807
-This is a tavern!
-It is also a tavern.

966
01:08:58,849 --> 01:09:03,687
-I remember you. The poet!
-Yes, William the Conqueror.

967
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:06,857
One at a time.
One at a time.

968
01:09:06,941 --> 01:09:11,487
Oh, he’s a pretty one. Tell me
your story while I tickle your fancy.

969
01:09:14,949 --> 01:09:18,786
-It’s a house of ill repute.
-It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

970
01:09:18,786 --> 01:09:21,664
Come.
There’s no harm in a drink.

971
01:09:21,747 --> 01:09:26,544
You are welcome to my best house.
Here’s to the Admiral’s Men.

972
01:09:26,627 --> 01:09:28,420
-The Admiral’s Men!
-The Admiral’s Men!

973
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,339
The Admiral’s Men!

974
01:09:53,487 --> 01:09:56,740
Well, I... I quite liked it.

975
01:09:56,824 --> 01:09:58,284
Master Kent...

976
01:09:59,034 --> 01:10:02,162
you have not yet dipped your wick.

977
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:05,833
My wick?

978
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:10,629
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theater,
you must have a part in my play.

979
01:10:10,629 --> 01:10:15,593
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

980
01:10:15,676 --> 01:10:18,762
My heavens.
I thank you.

981
01:10:18,846 --> 01:10:21,140
What’s the play about, then?

982
01:10:21,223 --> 01:10:23,392
Well, there’s this nurse...

983
01:10:28,105 --> 01:10:30,983
Silence, silence, silence!

984
01:10:31,692 --> 01:10:38,449
Master Shakespeare has asked me
to play the part of the apothecary.

985
01:10:40,326 --> 01:10:42,786
The apothecary?

986
01:10:42,786 --> 01:10:46,373
Will, what is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

987
01:10:46,457 --> 01:10:48,626
How does the comedy end?

988
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:53,005
-By God, I wish I knew.
-By God, if you do not, who does?

989
01:10:53,005 --> 01:10:56,717
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending...

990
01:10:56,759 --> 01:11:00,888
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

991
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:19,865
Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

992
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:23,827
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

993
01:11:23,827 --> 01:11:26,247
Marlowe is dead.

994
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:32,503
Stabbed.

995
01:11:32,586 --> 01:11:36,966
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

996
01:11:39,301 --> 01:11:41,303
What have I done?

997
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:44,765
He was the first man among us.

998
01:11:44,849 --> 01:11:47,518
A great light has gone out.

999
01:12:03,284 --> 01:12:05,327
Forgive me.

1000
01:12:08,372 --> 01:12:10,624
God forgive me.

1001
01:12:37,193 --> 01:12:40,362
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ’s sake.

1002
01:12:40,446 --> 01:12:42,865
~One morning in the month of May~

1003
01:12:42,948 --> 01:12:45,993
~From my cot I stray~

1004
01:12:46,076 --> 01:12:48,746
~Just at the dawning of the day~

1005
01:12:48,829 --> 01:12:51,415
~I met with a charming maid~

1006
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:57,087
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

1007
01:12:57,171 --> 01:13:01,175
-It’s not my riding day, my lord.
-Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

1008
01:13:01,759 --> 01:13:03,302
I’m going to church.

1009
01:13:03,385 --> 01:13:07,097
Of course. I understand.
It is to be expected.

1010
01:13:07,181 --> 01:13:10,601
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

1011
01:13:10,684 --> 01:13:13,979
And on a day of mourning.

1012
01:13:14,063 --> 01:13:17,191
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

1013
01:13:17,274 --> 01:13:19,276
Mourning?

1014
01:13:21,028 --> 01:13:23,781
Who is dead, my lord?

1015
01:13:23,864 --> 01:13:28,786
Oh! Dear God, I did not think
it would be me to tell you.

1016
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:33,499
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

1017
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,544
My lady.

1018
01:13:36,627 --> 01:13:40,297
-He is dead?
-Killed last night in a tavern.

1019
01:13:41,924 --> 01:13:45,511
Come then.
We’ll say a prayer for his soul.

1020
01:13:49,557 --> 01:13:56,230
~Who can remember sorrow~

1021
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:34,268
Spare me, dear ghost.

1022
01:14:34,351 --> 01:14:37,897
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me!

1023
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:52,661
Will!

1024
01:14:53,787 --> 01:14:55,664
Oh, my love.

1025
01:14:56,457 --> 01:14:58,542
I thought you were dead.

1026
01:15:03,005 --> 01:15:04,882
It is worse.

1027
01:15:05,799 --> 01:15:07,885
I’ve killed a man.

1028
01:15:12,223 --> 01:15:15,142
Marlowe’s touch
was in my "Titus Andronicus"...

1029
01:15:15,142 --> 01:15:18,771
and my "Henry 6th" was a house built
on his foundations.

1030
01:15:19,897 --> 01:15:22,566
You never spoke so well of him.

1031
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:24,860
He was not dead before.

1032
01:15:25,778 --> 01:15:30,950
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

1033
01:15:31,867 --> 01:15:34,036
You lie.

1034
01:15:35,704 --> 01:15:39,875
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

1035
01:15:39,959 --> 01:15:42,419
My love is no lie.

1036
01:15:43,587 --> 01:15:46,131
I have a wife, yes...

1037
01:15:46,215 --> 01:15:49,552
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1038
01:15:49,552 --> 01:15:54,640
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that...

1039
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,726
and yet, you let me come to your bed.

1040
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:01,063
Calf-love.

1041
01:16:01,146 --> 01:16:05,568
I loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

1042
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:08,404
I was the more deceived.

1043
01:16:08,487 --> 01:16:11,407
Yes, you were deceived...

1044
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:14,869
for I did not know
how much I loved you.

1045
01:16:17,496 --> 01:16:20,583
I love you, Will...

1046
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:22,751
beyond poetry.

1047
01:16:22,835 --> 01:16:25,337
Oh, my love.

1048
01:16:25,421 --> 01:16:29,508
-You ran from me before.
-When I thought you dead, I did not care...

1049
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:31,844
about all the plays
that would never come...

1050
01:16:31,927 --> 01:16:34,722
only that I would
never see your face.

1051
01:16:34,722 --> 01:16:38,017
I saw our end and it will come.

1052
01:16:38,142 --> 01:16:42,730
-You cannot marry Wessex.
-If not you, why not Wessex?

1053
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,399
If not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause...

1054
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:50,070
-and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
-No. No.

1055
01:16:50,154 --> 01:16:54,617
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows...

1056
01:16:54,742 --> 01:16:57,786
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

1057
01:16:59,246 --> 01:17:02,583
For killing Juliet’s
kinsman Tybalt...

1058
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:05,461
the one who killed
Romeo’s friend Mercutio...

1059
01:17:05,503 --> 01:17:09,256
Romeo is banished. But the friar
who married Romeo and Juliet...

1060
01:17:09,298 --> 01:17:10,299
Is that me?

1061
01:17:10,299 --> 01:17:15,262
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1062
01:17:15,262 --> 01:17:19,058
It is a secret potion.
It makes us seeming dead.

1063
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:22,061
She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets.

1064
01:17:22,144 --> 01:17:25,731
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

1065
01:17:27,858 --> 01:17:30,152
I have not said all.

1066
01:17:31,237 --> 01:17:37,201
By maligned fate, the message goes astray
which would tell Romeo of the friar’s plan.

1067
01:17:37,243 --> 01:17:40,538
He hears only that Juliet is dead.

1068
01:17:41,163 --> 01:17:44,500
-And thus he goes to the apothecary...
-That’s me.

1069
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:47,378
...and buys a deadly poison.

1070
01:17:47,378 --> 01:17:50,172
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet...

1071
01:17:50,172 --> 01:17:52,633
who lies there cold as death.

1072
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:55,803
He drinks the poison.

1073
01:17:56,178 --> 01:17:59,306
He dies by her side...

1074
01:17:59,932 --> 01:18:03,686
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

1075
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:08,315
And so Juliet takes his dagger...

1076
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:10,234
and then kills herself.

1077
01:18:14,738 --> 01:18:17,867
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

1078
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:20,828
Sad... and wonderful.

1079
01:18:21,996 --> 01:18:24,915
I have a blue velvet cap
that’ll do well.

1080
01:18:24,915 --> 01:18:29,753
I’ve seen just such a cap
on an apothecary. Just so.

1081
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:34,091
Yes, it will serve.

1082
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:38,512
But there’s a scene missing.

1083
01:18:39,138 --> 01:18:42,057
Between marriage and death?

1084
01:18:47,688 --> 01:18:51,775
The play...
all written out for you.

1085
01:18:53,319 --> 01:18:56,030
I had the clerk at Bridewell do it.

1086
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:58,449
He has a good fist for lettering.

1087
01:19:00,326 --> 01:19:03,370
There is a new scene.

1088
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:10,628
Will you read in for me?

1089
01:19:10,669 --> 01:19:13,964
<i>Wilt thou be gone?
It’s not yet near day.</i>

1090
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,550
<i>It was the nightingale, and not the lark...</i>

1091
01:19:16,634 --> 01:19:19,303
<i>that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.</i>

1092
01:19:19,303 --> 01:19:25,351
<i>Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</i>

1093
01:19:25,392 --> 01:19:29,438
<i>It was the lark,
the herald of the morn...</i>

1094
01:19:29,522 --> 01:19:31,857
<i>no nightingale.</i>

1095
01:19:31,941 --> 01:19:34,944
<i>Look, love,
what envious streaks...</i>

1096
01:19:34,944 --> 01:19:39,073
<i>do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.</i>

1097
01:19:39,156 --> 01:19:42,993
<i>Night’s candles are burnt out...</i>

1098
01:19:43,077 --> 01:19:48,958
<i>and jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.</i>

1099
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:53,754
<i>I must be gone and live,
or stay and die.</i>

1100
01:19:55,256 --> 01:19:59,301
<i>Yon light is not daylight;
I know it, I.</i>

1101
01:19:59,385 --> 01:20:02,346
<i>It is some meteor
that the sun exhales...</i>

1102
01:20:02,429 --> 01:20:07,101
<i>to be to thee this night a torchbearer...</i>

1103
01:20:07,184 --> 01:20:10,396
<i>to light thee on thy way to Mantua.</i>

1104
01:20:12,064 --> 01:20:17,903
<i>Therefore, stay yet.
Thou needst not to be gone.</i>

1105
01:20:18,028 --> 01:20:23,450
<i>Let me be ta'en,
let me be put to death.</i>

1106
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:27,830
<i>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.</i>

1107
01:20:27,955 --> 01:20:33,002
<i>I have more care to stay...
than will to go.</i>

1108
01:20:33,085 --> 01:20:38,549
<i>Come, death, and welcome.
Juliet wills it so.</i>

1109
01:21:01,488 --> 01:21:04,575
You will go far, I fear.

1110
01:21:08,537 --> 01:21:11,040
I hope we work together again.

1111
01:21:13,459 --> 01:21:19,006
<i>Such mortal drugs I have,
but Mantua’s law is death...</i>

1112
01:21:19,006 --> 01:21:21,383
<i>death to any he that utters them.</i>

1113
01:21:21,634 --> 01:21:24,512
Then him. Then me.

1114
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:28,849
<i>Put this in any liquid thing you will and...</i>

1115
01:21:28,974 --> 01:21:33,187
What is it? What is it?

1116
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:37,233
<i>How silver sweet sound
lovers" tongues by night.</i>

1117
01:21:37,274 --> 01:21:39,485
<i>-Like soft music...
-Shakespeare!</i>

1118
01:21:56,669 --> 01:21:59,630
Upstart inky pup!

1119
01:21:59,755 --> 01:22:02,716
I’ll show you your place,
which is in hell!

1120
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:10,516
-You’re on my ground now!
-By God, I’ll fight the lot of you!

1121
01:22:10,516 --> 01:22:12,434
I am more than enough!

1122
01:22:20,109 --> 01:22:22,278
Move!

1123
01:23:44,276 --> 01:23:46,779
Absent friends.

1124
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:51,158
This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

1125
01:23:51,784 --> 01:23:53,035
Will?

1126
01:23:53,077 --> 01:23:56,997
I rejoiced in his death because I thought
it was yours! That is all I know of Marlowe!

1127
01:23:56,997 --> 01:24:00,584
Will? Uh, it’s true.

1128
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:03,462
It was a... tavern brawl.

1129
01:24:03,546 --> 01:24:08,509
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

1130
01:24:08,592 --> 01:24:10,845
A quarrel about the bill.

1131
01:24:10,886 --> 01:24:14,223
The bill?
Oh, vanity, vanity!

1132
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:17,601
Not the billing,
the bill!

1133
01:24:21,981 --> 01:24:25,317
-Oh, God. I am free of it.
-Where is she?

1134
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:29,572
-Close it.
-My Lord Wessex.

1135
01:24:29,613 --> 01:24:32,825
The Rose harbors the ass
that shits on my name!

1136
01:24:32,908 --> 01:24:35,119
Take it down stone by stone.

1137
01:24:35,202 --> 01:24:38,998
I want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

1138
01:24:38,998 --> 01:24:40,958
Mr. Tilney, what is this?

1139
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:43,460
Sedition and indecency.

1140
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:46,172
Master of the Revels, sir.
She’s over here.

1141
01:24:46,255 --> 01:24:48,883
-Where, boy?
-There.

1142
01:24:48,966 --> 01:24:51,135
I saw her bubbies.

1143
01:24:51,218 --> 01:24:55,598
So, a woman on the stage!

1144
01:24:55,681 --> 01:24:59,810
A woman!
I say this theater is closed!

1145
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:01,353
Why, sir?

1146
01:25:01,437 --> 01:25:05,566
For lewdness and unashamed faced ness!

1147
01:25:05,649 --> 01:25:10,529
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

1148
01:25:25,628 --> 01:25:27,671
Not him, her!

1149
01:25:31,425 --> 01:25:33,260
That’s who I meant.

1150
01:25:35,346 --> 01:25:38,849
-He’s a woman.
-This theater is closed.

1151
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:44,188
Notice will be posted!

1152
01:25:44,271 --> 01:25:47,233
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

1153
01:25:47,316 --> 01:25:50,194
-Nobody knew.
-He did.

1154
01:25:50,277 --> 01:25:53,280
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

1155
01:25:55,741 --> 01:25:57,868
It is over.

1156
01:25:58,577 --> 01:26:01,705
I’m sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1157
01:26:16,095 --> 01:26:18,430
I wanted to be an actor.

1158
01:26:19,849 --> 01:26:21,934
I’m so sorry, Will.

1159
01:26:27,648 --> 01:26:30,734
You were... w-w...

1160
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:34,196
w-wonderful.

1161
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:38,033
Thank you.

1162
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:50,921
<i>Put this in any liquid thing you will
and...</i>

1163
01:26:57,344 --> 01:26:59,889
Everything all right?

1164
01:27:37,009 --> 01:27:39,720
I would’ve been good.

1165
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:43,724
-I would’ve been great.
-So would I.

1166
01:27:43,849 --> 01:27:46,227
We both would.

1167
01:28:08,499 --> 01:28:10,960
Lambert, kill him.

1168
01:28:12,294 --> 01:28:14,588
That can wait.

1169
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:24,098
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1170
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:27,309
But my father, James Burbage...

1171
01:28:27,309 --> 01:28:31,772
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty...

1172
01:28:31,856 --> 01:28:36,569
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

1173
01:28:36,652 --> 01:28:40,155
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

1174
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,908
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1175
01:28:43,742 --> 01:28:48,205
I have a theater.
The "Curtain" is yours.

1176
01:29:21,572 --> 01:29:25,117
Will!
We’ll be needing a Romeo.

1177
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:33,959
Oranges! Sweet oranges!

1178
01:30:01,737 --> 01:30:03,697
My ship is moored at bank side...

1179
01:30:03,697 --> 01:30:06,700
bound for Virginia
on the afternoon tide.

1180
01:30:06,742 --> 01:30:10,120
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.
You are gaining a colony.

1181
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:15,626
And you, my lord, are gaining 5,000 pounds
by these drafts in my hand.

1182
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:18,462
Would you oblige me with 50 or so in gold...

1183
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:21,632
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside?

1184
01:30:22,925 --> 01:30:25,803
Ah, the bride!

1185
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:29,974
Good morning, my lord.

1186
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:34,520
I see you are... open for business,
so let’s to church.

1187
01:30:40,109 --> 01:30:41,151
Be gone!

1188
01:31:39,543 --> 01:31:41,462
Oh, my lord!

1189
01:31:41,545 --> 01:31:44,131
-Be good to her, my lord.
-I will.

1190
01:31:44,215 --> 01:31:46,300
Oh, God bless you!

1191
01:31:46,383 --> 01:31:49,220
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There’s a good nurse.

1192
01:31:49,303 --> 01:31:51,263
The tide will not wait!

1193
01:31:51,347 --> 01:31:55,226
Farewell!
You’ll all be welcome in Virginia!

1194
01:32:21,752 --> 01:32:26,423
Candy apples!

1195
01:32:26,507 --> 01:32:30,052
Buy my apples!

1196
01:32:34,557 --> 01:32:36,767
Thank you, sir.
Apples!

1197
01:32:44,275 --> 01:32:47,653
Is this, uh...
Is this all right?

1198
01:32:47,736 --> 01:32:49,655
Yeah.

1199
01:33:04,962 --> 01:33:09,258
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

1200
01:33:09,383 --> 01:33:13,929
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show!

1201
01:33:14,013 --> 01:33:18,976
This is the very business of show!

1202
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:32,656
T- T- T- Two...

1203
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,367
T- T- T- T... T... T...

1204
01:33:35,451 --> 01:33:39,121
T... T- T- Two households...

1205
01:33:39,205 --> 01:33:42,124
-We’re lost.
-No, it will turn out well.

1206
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:45,669
-How will it?
-I don’t know. It’s a mystery.

1207
01:33:48,214 --> 01:33:51,717
T- T... T... T- T...

1208
01:33:51,842 --> 01:33:54,178
T... T...

1209
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:48,023
Two households...

1210
01:34:48,107 --> 01:34:51,235
both alike in dignity...

1211
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:54,071
in fair Verona...

1212
01:34:54,154 --> 01:34:56,740
where we lay our scene.

1213
01:34:56,824 --> 01:34:59,910
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny...

1214
01:34:59,952 --> 01:35:03,372
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

1215
01:35:03,414 --> 01:35:06,458
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

1216
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,670
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

1217
01:35:09,712 --> 01:35:12,506
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

1218
01:35:12,548 --> 01:35:16,010
doth with their death
bury their parents" strife.

1219
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:22,266
...the which of you
with patient ears attend...

1220
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:27,104
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

1221
01:35:33,444 --> 01:35:35,446
-Wonderful.
-Was it...

1222
01:35:36,572 --> 01:35:38,616
good?

1223
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:44,538
<i>Gregory, on my word
we’ll not carry coals.</i>

1224
01:35:44,622 --> 01:35:47,666
<i>No, for then
we should be colliers.</i>

1225
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:50,252
<i>I mean, and we be
in choler we’ll draw.</i>

1226
01:35:50,336 --> 01:35:53,422
-Master Shakespeare.
-Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

1227
01:35:53,506 --> 01:35:56,717
It’s not my fault.
I could do it yesterday.

1228
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:59,220
Do me a speech. Do me a line.

1229
01:35:59,303 --> 01:36:03,140
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow.</i>

1230
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:06,477
-Another little problem.
-What do we do now?

1231
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:10,481
-The show must... You know.
-Go on!

1232
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:13,984
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

1233
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:16,487
-How will it?
-I don’t know. It’s a mystery.

1234
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:18,864
<i>-Fear me not.
-No, marry, I fear thee!</i>

1235
01:36:21,283 --> 01:36:24,161
<i>-Let them begin.
-I will frown as I pass by.</i>

1236
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:28,040
<i>-Let them take it as they list!
-Nay, as they dare.</i>

1237
01:36:28,123 --> 01:36:32,169
<i>I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.</i>

1238
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:35,172
<i>Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?</i>

1239
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:38,551
<i>-I do bite my thumb, sir.
-Excuse me. Thank you.</i>

1240
01:36:38,634 --> 01:36:42,263
<i>-Thank you. Excuse me.
-Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</i>

1241
01:36:42,346 --> 01:36:44,181
-Can we talk?
-Shh!

1242
01:36:44,223 --> 01:36:47,059
-We have no Juliet.
-No Juliet?

1243
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:50,020
-No Juliet?
-It’ll be all right, madam.

1244
01:36:50,062 --> 01:36:52,398
-What happened to Sam?
-Who are you?

1245
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:54,316
Thomas Kent.

1246
01:36:54,733 --> 01:36:56,819
Do you know it?

1247
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,197
Every word.

1248
01:37:09,707 --> 01:37:12,710
<i>I’ll go along,
no such sight to be shown...</i>

1249
01:37:12,793 --> 01:37:15,921
<i>but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.</i>

1250
01:37:16,005 --> 01:37:18,299
<i>Nurse!</i>

1251
01:37:20,676 --> 01:37:23,929
<i>Where’s my daughter?
Call her forth to me.</i>

1252
01:37:24,013 --> 01:37:27,224
<i>Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old...</i>

1253
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:29,226
<i>I bade her come.</i>

1254
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:31,395
How now, who calls?

1255
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:34,231
<i>What, ladybird!</i>

1256
01:37:34,315 --> 01:37:36,066
<i>God forbid!
Where’s this girl?</i>

1257
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,777
<i>What, lamb!</i>

1258
01:37:38,861 --> 01:37:41,071
<i>What, ladybird!</i>

1259
01:37:42,156 --> 01:37:44,575
<i>What, Juliet!</i>

1260
01:37:45,701 --> 01:37:49,079
<i>How now, who calls?</i>

1261
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:56,629
-We’ll all be put in the Clink.
-See you in jail.

1262
01:37:59,757 --> 01:38:02,927
<i>Your mother...
Your mother.</i>

1263
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:06,305
<i>Madam, I am here.
What is your will?</i>

1264
01:38:06,388 --> 01:38:08,432
<i>This is the matter.</i>

1265
01:38:08,516 --> 01:38:10,935
<i>Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.</i>

1266
01:38:11,018 --> 01:38:15,773
<i>Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.</i>

1267
01:38:15,856 --> 01:38:19,193
<i>Thou knowest my daughter’s
of a pretty age.</i>

1268
01:38:19,276 --> 01:38:22,780
<i>-Faith, I know her age unto an hour.
-She’s not 14.</i>

1269
01:38:22,863 --> 01:38:28,369
<i>Oh, I’ll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken...</i>

1270
01:38:28,452 --> 01:38:31,205
<i>I have but 4.</i>

1271
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:55,437
<i>Tell me, daughter Juliet...</i>

1272
01:38:55,521 --> 01:39:00,109
<i>how stands your dispositions
to be married?</i>

1273
01:39:00,192 --> 01:39:03,320
<i>It is an honor
that I dream not of.</i>

1274
01:39:07,616 --> 01:39:10,494
<i>Hold, Tybalt!
Good Mercutio!</i>

1275
01:39:19,795 --> 01:39:21,463
<i>I’m sped.</i>

1276
01:39:21,547 --> 01:39:24,341
<i>Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.</i>

1277
01:39:24,425 --> 01:39:29,722
<i>Ask for me tomorrow,
you shall find me a grave man.</i>

1278
01:39:36,937 --> 01:39:37,980
<i>Yes!</i>

1279
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:46,488
<i>Yah!</i>

1280
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:50,034
<i>Such mortal drugs I have...</i>

1281
01:39:50,117 --> 01:39:54,747
<i>but Mantua’s law is death
to any he that utters them.</i>

1282
01:39:54,872 --> 01:39:57,374
Then him. Then me.

1283
01:40:05,883 --> 01:40:07,927
<i>Romeo, away, be gone!</i>

1284
01:40:08,052 --> 01:40:12,431
<i>The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed!</i>

1285
01:40:12,556 --> 01:40:16,769
<i>The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away!</i>

1286
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:20,314
<i>Oh, I am Fortune’s fool!</i>

1287
01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:22,316
<i>Why dost thou stay?</i>

1288
01:40:22,441 --> 01:40:24,401
<i>Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?</i>

1289
01:40:24,527 --> 01:40:26,695
<i>That murderer, which way ran he?</i>

1290
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,573
<i>-There lies that Tybalt.
-Up, sir. Go with me.</i>

1291
01:40:29,698 --> 01:40:31,700
<i>I charge thee
in the Prince’s name obey.</i>

1292
01:40:31,825 --> 01:40:34,495
<i>Where are the vile beginners
of this fray?</i>

1293
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:36,830
<i>Oh, I am Fortune’s fool.</i>

1294
01:40:39,667 --> 01:40:41,585
<i>You are married?</i>

1295
01:40:45,256 --> 01:40:50,261
<i>If you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed.</i>

1296
01:41:06,026 --> 01:41:08,237
<i>Art thou gone so...</i>

1297
01:41:10,865 --> 01:41:12,992
<i>love, lord...</i>

1298
01:41:13,075 --> 01:41:15,286
<i>aye, husband, friend?</i>

1299
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:20,124
<i>I must hear from thee
every day in the hour...</i>

1300
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:23,127
<i>for in a minute
there are many days.</i>

1301
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:26,797
<i>Oh, by this count
I shall be much in years ere again...</i>

1302
01:41:26,881 --> 01:41:29,300
<i>I behold my Romeo.</i>

1303
01:41:29,884 --> 01:41:31,302
<i>Farewell.</i>

1304
01:41:32,803 --> 01:41:36,348
<i>Oh, thinks thou we shall ever meet again?</i>

1305
01:41:37,766 --> 01:41:40,811
<i>Methinks I see thee,
now thou art so low...</i>

1306
01:41:40,895 --> 01:41:44,356
<i>as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.</i>

1307
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:48,611
<i>Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look’s pale.</i>

1308
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:52,281
<i>Then trust me, love...</i>

1309
01:41:52,364 --> 01:41:54,700
<i>in my eyes, so do you.</i>

1310
01:41:54,783 --> 01:41:58,537
<i>Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.</i>

1311
01:41:58,621 --> 01:42:00,539
<i>Adieu.</i>

1312
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:04,668
<i>Adieu.</i>

1313
01:42:04,752 --> 01:42:07,505
<i>Take thou this vial,
being then in bed...</i>

1314
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:10,674
<i>and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.</i>

1315
01:42:10,758 --> 01:42:14,720
<i>No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.</i>

1316
01:42:14,803 --> 01:42:17,765
<i>And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...</i>

1317
01:42:17,848 --> 01:42:21,060
<i>thou shalt continue
2 and 40 hours...</i>

1318
01:42:21,143 --> 01:42:24,772
<i>and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.</i>

1319
01:42:24,855 --> 01:42:26,941
<i>What ho! Apothecary!</i>

1320
01:42:30,444 --> 01:42:34,073
<i>Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.</i>

1321
01:42:34,156 --> 01:42:37,076
<i>Hold, there is 40 ducats.</i>

1322
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:40,913
<i>-Let me have a dram of poison...
-Such mortal drugs I have...</i>

1323
01:42:40,996 --> 01:42:45,042
<i>but Mantua’s law is death
to any he that utters them.</i>

1324
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:48,629
<i>-Art thou so...
-My poverty, but not my will, consents.</i>

1325
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:57,596
<i>I pay thy poverty
and not thy will.</i>

1326
01:43:01,392 --> 01:43:03,561
<i>Eyes, look your last.</i>

1327
01:43:03,644 --> 01:43:06,397
<i>Arms, take your last embrace.</i>

1328
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:12,361
<i>And, lips,
oh, you, the doors of breath...</i>

1329
01:43:12,444 --> 01:43:14,864
<i>seal with a righteous kiss...</i>

1330
01:43:16,824 --> 01:43:21,412
<i>the dateless bargain
to engrossing death.</i>

1331
01:43:22,705 --> 01:43:28,919
<i>Come, bitter conduct.
Come, unsavoury guide.</i>

1332
01:43:29,003 --> 01:43:32,715
<i>Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...</i>

1333
01:43:32,798 --> 01:43:37,595
<i>run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.</i>

1334
01:43:37,678 --> 01:43:40,097
<i>Here’s to my love!</i>

1335
01:43:48,022 --> 01:43:51,192
<i>Oh... true apothecary!</i>

1336
01:43:55,196 --> 01:43:57,448
<i>Thy drugs are quick.</i>

1337
01:44:02,244 --> 01:44:04,830
<i>Thus with a kiss...</i>

1338
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:09,627
<i>I die.</i>

1339
01:44:27,353 --> 01:44:29,438
<i>Where is my lord?</i>

1340
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:35,319
<i>I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?</i>

1341
01:44:35,402 --> 01:44:36,695
Dead!

1342
01:44:50,084 --> 01:44:52,127
<i>What’s this?</i>

1343
01:44:52,211 --> 01:44:55,923
<i>A cup, closed
in my true love’s hand?</i>

1344
01:44:57,633 --> 01:45:01,303
<i>Poison, I see,hath been
his timeless end.</i>

1345
01:45:06,976 --> 01:45:11,564
<i>Oh, happy dagger,
this is thy sheath.</i>

1346
01:45:14,525 --> 01:45:16,902
<i>There rust...</i>

1347
01:45:18,362 --> 01:45:20,573
<i>and let me die.</i>

1348
01:45:27,496 --> 01:45:31,083
<i>A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.</i>

1349
01:45:31,166 --> 01:45:35,588
<i>The sun for sorrow
will not show his head.</i>

1350
01:45:35,671 --> 01:45:40,634
<i>Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.</i>

1351
01:45:40,759 --> 01:45:42,970
<i>Some shall be pardoned...</i>

1352
01:45:43,095 --> 01:45:46,098
<i>and some punished.</i>

1353
01:45:46,182 --> 01:45:50,311
<i>For never was a story
of more woe...</i>

1354
01:45:50,394 --> 01:45:53,981
<i>than this of Juliet...</i>

1355
01:45:54,106 --> 01:45:56,317
<i>and her Romeo.</i>

1356
01:46:23,469 --> 01:46:26,305
Bravo!

1357
01:46:30,059 --> 01:46:32,019
-Yea! Yea!
-Yea!

1358
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:21,110
-Bravo!
-Yea! Bravo!

1359
01:47:35,583 --> 01:47:40,004
-God save the queen!
-I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth!

1360
01:47:40,087 --> 01:47:44,091
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

1361
01:47:44,175 --> 01:47:45,926
Everyone!

1362
01:47:46,010 --> 01:47:49,346
Admiral’s Men,
the Chamberlain’s Men...

1363
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:53,767
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

1364
01:47:53,851 --> 01:47:57,229
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

1365
01:47:57,313 --> 01:48:01,358
Contempt? You closed the "Rose".
I have not opened it.

1366
01:48:01,442 --> 01:48:03,944
That woman is a woman!

1367
01:48:04,028 --> 01:48:06,113
What?

1368
01:48:06,197 --> 01:48:09,408
A woman?
You mean that goat?

1369
01:48:09,491 --> 01:48:14,914
I’ll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

1370
01:48:14,997 --> 01:48:18,334
Mr. Tilney!

1371
01:48:23,547 --> 01:48:27,301
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

1372
01:48:35,142 --> 01:48:37,937
The queen of England
does not attend...

1373
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:40,064
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1374
01:48:40,147 --> 01:48:43,150
So something is out of joint.

1375
01:48:45,069 --> 01:48:48,739
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

1376
01:49:03,546 --> 01:49:06,465
Yes, the illusion is remarkable.

1377
01:49:06,549 --> 01:49:09,260
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

1378
01:49:10,594 --> 01:49:14,598
But I know something of
a woman in a man’s profession.

1379
01:49:14,682 --> 01:49:17,643
Yes, by God,
I do know about that.

1380
01:49:19,395 --> 01:49:22,314
That is enough from you, Master Kent.

1381
01:49:27,152 --> 01:49:29,405
If only Lord Wessex were here.

1382
01:49:29,488 --> 01:49:31,532
He is, ma'am.

1383
01:49:34,451 --> 01:49:37,663
Y-Your Majesty.

1384
01:49:38,914 --> 01:49:41,917
There was a wager I remember...

1385
01:49:42,001 --> 01:49:46,839
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

1386
01:49:46,922 --> 01:49:49,508
I think you lost it today.

1387
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:58,100
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

1388
01:49:58,184 --> 01:50:01,103
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

1389
01:50:07,776 --> 01:50:10,196
Master Shakespeare.

1390
01:50:12,781 --> 01:50:15,784
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself...

1391
01:50:15,868 --> 01:50:18,996
and we will speak some more.

1392
01:50:36,472 --> 01:50:38,724
Your Majesty.

1393
01:50:40,142 --> 01:50:44,730
Why, Lord Wessex.
Lost your wife so soon?

1394
01:50:44,813 --> 01:50:47,566
Indeed I am a bride short...

1395
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:52,363
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

1396
01:50:52,738 --> 01:50:55,032
How is this to end?

1397
01:50:55,074 --> 01:51:00,329
As stories must when love’s denied,
with tears and a journey.

1398
01:51:01,288 --> 01:51:07,169
Those whom God has joined in marriage
not even I can put asunder.

1399
01:51:07,378 --> 01:51:09,046
Master Kent.

1400
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:19,515
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1401
01:51:20,683 --> 01:51:24,478
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

1402
01:51:24,562 --> 01:51:27,022
It’s time to settle accounts.

1403
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:33,237
-How much was that wager?
-50 shillings.

1404
01:51:34,572 --> 01:51:35,823
Pounds.

1405
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:41,662
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

1406
01:51:49,253 --> 01:51:53,174
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

1407
01:51:53,299 --> 01:51:56,135
for "Twelfth Night".

1408
01:52:13,110 --> 01:52:15,613
Too late.
Too late.

1409
01:52:25,497 --> 01:52:27,583
My Lady Wessex.

1410
01:52:42,723 --> 01:52:45,726
A hired player no longer.

1411
01:52:45,851 --> 01:52:51,023
50 pounds, Will,
for the poet of true love.

1412
01:52:52,191 --> 01:52:54,568
I’m done with theater.

1413
01:52:55,903 --> 01:53:00,991
The playhouse is for dreamers.
Look what the dream brought us.

1414
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,745
It was we ourselves did that.

1415
01:53:06,163 --> 01:53:10,376
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

1416
01:53:10,501 --> 01:53:14,630
I have hurt you, and I’m sorry for it.

1417
01:53:14,755 --> 01:53:18,801
If my hurt is to be
that you write no more...

1418
01:53:18,884 --> 01:53:21,262
then I shall be the sorrier.

1419
01:53:26,851 --> 01:53:29,395
The queen commands
a comedy, Will...

1420
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:34,608
-for "Twelfth Night".
-A comedy.

1421
01:53:34,733 --> 01:53:36,735
What would my hero be?

1422
01:53:36,777 --> 01:53:40,698
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

1423
01:53:42,491 --> 01:53:45,953
It’s a beginning.

1424
01:53:46,036 --> 01:53:50,124
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine...

1425
01:53:50,207 --> 01:53:53,544
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

1426
01:53:55,379 --> 01:53:59,592
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

1427
01:53:59,675 --> 01:54:02,553
A storm.
All are lost.

1428
01:54:02,636 --> 01:54:06,098
She lands... on a...

1429
01:54:06,182 --> 01:54:09,185
vast and empty shore.

1430
01:54:10,644 --> 01:54:12,688
She’s brought to the duke...

1431
01:54:14,106 --> 01:54:17,151
-Orsino.
-Orsino?

1432
01:54:18,277 --> 01:54:20,196
Good name.

1433
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:26,243
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1434
01:54:26,285 --> 01:54:29,622
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

1435
01:54:30,789 --> 01:54:33,000
But all ends well.

1436
01:54:33,083 --> 01:54:35,294
How does it?

1437
01:54:36,086 --> 01:54:37,505
I don’t know.

1438
01:54:39,089 --> 01:54:41,884
It’s a mystery.

1439
01:54:48,807 --> 01:54:51,477
You will never age for me...

1440
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:55,105
nor fade, nor die.

1441
01:54:56,148 --> 01:54:58,234
Nor you for me.

1442
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:02,154
Good-bye, my love.

1443
01:55:03,072 --> 01:55:05,366
A thousand times good-bye.

1444
01:55:10,538 --> 01:55:12,831
Write me well.

1445
01:55:44,613 --> 01:55:48,242
My story starts at sea...

1446
01:55:48,325 --> 01:55:52,246
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

1447
01:55:52,955 --> 01:55:55,249
A shipwreck.

1448
01:55:57,918 --> 01:56:01,714
The wild waters roar and heave.

1449
01:56:02,923 --> 01:56:06,177
The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces...

1450
01:56:08,929 --> 01:56:12,808
and all the helpless souls within her...

1451
01:56:12,892 --> 01:56:14,977
drowned.

1452
01:56:17,855 --> 01:56:21,150
All save one:

1453
01:56:21,233 --> 01:56:23,319
a lady...

1454
01:56:24,778 --> 01:56:27,865
whose soul is greater
than the ocean...

1455
01:56:29,116 --> 01:56:34,038
and her spirit stronger
than the sea’s embrace.

1456
01:56:35,706 --> 01:56:38,834
Not for her a watery end...

1457
01:56:40,377 --> 01:56:45,174
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

1458
01:56:48,636 --> 01:56:51,138
It will be a love story,

1459
01:56:55,267 --> 01:56:59,480
for she will be my heroine for all time.

1460
01:57:02,316 --> 01:57:05,861
And her name will be Viola.

1461
01:57:26,316 --> 01:57:32,316
 Thanks for using the subs
      regards, shock
