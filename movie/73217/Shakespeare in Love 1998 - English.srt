1
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,272
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn't pay his debts?

2
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,482
His boots catch fire!

3
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,652
Why do you howl!...

4
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:10,363
when it is I who am bitten?

5
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:13,366
- What am I, Mr. Lambert?
- Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

6
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:15,368
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

7
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,370
Twelve pounds, one schilling and fourpence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

8
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:20,330
- Aaah! I can pay you!
- When?

9
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:23,625
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
Oh, for pity's sake!

10
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,877
Take them out.

11
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,879
Where will you find...

12
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:29,880
Sixteen pounds,
five schillings and ninepence.

13
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,882
Including interest,
in three weeks?

14
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:34,676
- I have a wonderful new play.
- Put them back in.

15
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,678
- It's a comedy!
- Cut off his nose.

16
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:39,305
It's a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

17
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:43,309
- And his ears.
- And a share!

18
00:02:43,392 --> 00:02:45,353
We will be partners,
Mr. Fennyman!

19
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,939
Partners?

20
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:55,236
It's a crowd-tickler.

21
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,823
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

22
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:01,742
- A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
- I think I've seen it.

23
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,577
I didn't like it.

24
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,372
- But this time it is by Shakespeare.
- What's it called?

25
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,250
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

26
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,418
Good title.

27
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:15,838
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

28
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:18,340
Let's say we open
in two weeks.

29
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:20,842
That's, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

30
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:24,554
In addition, 400 backsides at
threepence, a penny extra for cushions.

31
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,597
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

32
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:30,434
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees?

33
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:33,645
- Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
- Correct.

34
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:36,773
- But I have to pay the actors and the author.
- Share of the profits.

35
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:39,275
- There's never any-
- Of course not.

36
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:43,696
Oh- Oh, Mr. Fennyman, I think you
might have hit upon something.

37
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:46,282
Sign there.

38
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:53,788
So, Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

39
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:55,790
Almost finished?

40
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:59,377
Oh, without doubt he's completing it
at this very moment.

41
00:04:57,553 --> 00:05:00,556
Will. Will!

42
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,016
Where is my play?

43
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,353
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

44
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,856
Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.

45
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:12,692
No, no, we haven't the time.
Talk prose.

46
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,693
Where is my play?

47
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:17,321
- It is all locked safe in here.
- God be praised.

48
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,281
Locked?

49
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:22,701
- As soon as I find my muse.
- Who is she this time?

50
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:24,702
She is always Aphrodite.

51
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:27,538
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet?

52
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:30,708
Henslowe, you have no soul,

53
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,461
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

54
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,463
Ow! Will!

55
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:39,465
I am a dead man,
and buggered to boot.

56
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,968
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

57
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,970
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

58
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,973
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain's
Men are invited to court...

59
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,976
and receive ten pounds
to play your piece,

60
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,978
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

61
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,980
when you were green
and grateful.

62
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,983
- What piece? Richard Crookback?
- No! It's comedy they want.

63
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,985
Like Romeo and Ethel.

64
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:03,987
- Who wrote that?
- Nobody. You were writing it for me.

65
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,990
- I gave you three pound a month since.
- Half what you owe me.

66
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:09,409
I'm still due for
One Gentleman of Verona.

67
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:12,912
What is money to you and me?
I, your patron, you, my wordwright.

68
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,914
When the plague lifts,

69
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:17,916
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain.

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,918
- I will have nothing for the Rose.
- Mr. Henslowe.

71
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,920
- Will you lend me 50 pounds?
- Fifty pounds?

72
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,922
- What for?
- Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men.

73
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:27,758
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

74
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:31,887
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

75
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,889
No, then?

76
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:36,933
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

77
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:41,562
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

78
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:46,233
And the Rose smells
thusly rank by any name!

79
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:50,946
I say, a plague
on both their houses!

80
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:52,947
Where are you going?

81
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:55,116
My weekly confession.

82
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,206
Words, words, words.

83
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,709
Once, I had the gift.

84
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,712
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

85
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,714
Love that overthrows empires.

86
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:15,217
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

87
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:19,221
For sixpence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

88
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:22,724
- But now-
- And yet you tell me you lie with women.

89
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:27,144
Black Sue,
Fat Phoebe,

90
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:31,273
Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind-

91
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:34,151
Yes, now and again.
What of it?

92
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:35,819
I have lost my gift.

93
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:38,321
I am here to help you.

94
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:40,823
Tell me,
in your own words.

95
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:48,455
I- It's as if
my quill is broken,

96
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,459
as if the organ
of my imagination has dried up,

97
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:56,087
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

98
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,005
- Interesting.
- Nothing comes.

99
00:07:58,089 --> 00:07:59,965
Most interesting.

100
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:02,801
It's like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

101
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:08,514
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

102
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,686
How long has it been?

103
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,856
A goodly length in times past,
but lately-

104
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,359
No, no.
You have a wife, children?

105
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,197
Aye.

106
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:29,241
I was a lad of 18.

107
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,743
Anne Hathaway was a woman
half as old again.

108
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:34,871
- A woman of property?
- She had a cottage.

109
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:39,709
- One day she was three months gone with child, so
- And your relations?

110
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:43,462
- On my mother's side, the Ardens.
- No, your marriage bed.

111
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:47,132
Four years and a hundred miles away
in Stratford.

112
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:51,011
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

113
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:53,012
Banishment was a blessing.

114
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:56,682
- So, now you are free to love-
- Yet cannot love, nor write it.

115
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:03,230
Here is a- a bangle...

116
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:06,816
found in Psyche's temple
on Olympus.

117
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,193
Cheap at fourpence.

118
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:14,198
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

119
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,200
Will it restore my gift?

120
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:19,703
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

121
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,997
Words will flow like a river.

122
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:24,999
See you next week.

123
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:29,503
- Now where?
- To the palace at Whitehall.

124
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:33,006
All right.

125
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,509
Hello, Will.

126
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:39,637
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

127
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,515
- You too, good Crab.
- Crab's nervous. He's never played the palace.

128
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,018
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will?

129
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:49,437
- I could do it.
- No, they would laugh at Seneca if you played it.

130
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:52,774
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

131
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:55,776
- How goes it, Will?
- I'm still owed money for this play, Burbage.

132
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,279
Not by me.
I only stole it.

133
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:00,781
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

134
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:03,283
Where were
my seamstress' eyes?

135
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:07,245
- When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
- When I have 50 pounds.

136
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:10,873
- You writing?
- A comedy. All but done.

137
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:12,875
A pirate comedy.

138
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,294
- Wonderful.
- Bring it tomorrow.

139
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:19,089
- It's for Henslowe. He paid me. Ten pounds.
- You're a liar.

140
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:23,885
- He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
- Mmm. Ned's wrong for it.

141
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:26,429
Will?

142
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:30,432
- Here's two sovereigns. I'll give you another two when I see the pages.
- Done.

143
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:32,434
Burbage, I will see you
hanged for a pickpocket.

144
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:34,936
The queen has commanded it.
She loves a comedy.

145
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,605
And the Master of the Revels
favors us.

146
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:40,608
And what favor does Mr. Tilney
receive from you?

147
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:42,610
- Ask him.
- She comes!

148
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:11,343
Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.

149
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,637
Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,

150
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:16,515
were it not affection
chains thy tender days...

151
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:21,978
When will you write me
a sonnet, Will?

152
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:25,523
- I've lost my gift.
- You left it in my bed.

153
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:27,524
Come to look for it again.

154
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:37,367
Are you to be my muse,
Rosaline?

155
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,536
Burbage has my keeping,

156
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,538
but you have my heart.

157
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:47,209
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

158
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,210
Will Shakespeare has a play.

159
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:51,713
Let's go and cough through it.

160
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:56,717
My father weeping; my mother wailing;

161
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,555
our maid howling;
our cat wringing her hands.

162
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,016
Yet did not this coldhearted cur...

163
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,019
shed one tear-

164
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,865
You see? Comedy.

165
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,911
Love, and a bit with a dog.

166
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:29,079
That's what they want.

167
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:41,006
He is a stone, a very pebble stone,

168
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,093
and has no more pity in him
than a dog!

169
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:48,096
A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.

170
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:53,059
Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word-

171
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:55,644
Well played, Master Crab!

172
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:59,773
I commend you!

173
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:05,403
What light is light...

174
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,405
if Silvia be not seen?

175
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,116
What joy is joy...

176
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,452
if Silvia be not by?

177
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:16,455
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

178
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:20,458
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

179
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:24,962
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

180
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:28,507
there is no music
in the nightingale.

181
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,510
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

182
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:35,013
there is no day for me
to look upon.

183
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:01,912
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best?

184
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:04,914
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

185
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:07,416
Oh, I liked the dog
for laughs.

186
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,919
Silvia, I did not care for much.

187
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:11,920
His fingers were red
from fighting...

188
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:15,257
and he spoke like
a schoolboy at lessons.

189
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,259
Stage love will never be true love...

190
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:23,389
while the law of the land has our heroines
being played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

191
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:26,558
- Oh, when can we see another?
- When the queen commands it.

192
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:28,560
No, but at the playhouse.
Nurse!

193
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:32,439
Be still.
Playhouses are not for wellborn ladies.

194
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,774
Oh! I'm not so wellborn.

195
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:37,276
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

196
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,779
and well-married
is more so.

197
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:42,281
Lord Wessex
was looking at you tonight.

198
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,783
All the men at court
are without poetry.

199
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:47,786
If they see me, they see
my father's fortune.

200
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:51,456
I will have poetry
in my life,

201
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:53,457
and adventure.

202
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,252
And love.
Love above all.

203
00:14:57,336 --> 00:14:59,254
Like Valentine
and Silvia?

204
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:03,216
No, not the artful postures
of love,

205
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,303
but love that overthrows life.

206
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:11,056
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart,

207
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,477
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

208
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,230
Love as there has never been
in a play.

209
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:23,234
I will have love,
or I will end my days as-

210
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:25,236
As a nurse?

211
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:30,115
Oh, but I would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

212
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:34,244
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

213
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,539
I would stay asleep
my whole life...

214
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:42,543
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

215
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:45,545
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

216
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:51,092
Now spit.

217
00:16:14,362 --> 00:16:17,907
This time the boots
are coming off.

218
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:21,369
- What have I done?
- The theaters have all been closed down by the plague.

219
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:24,371
- Oh, that.
- By order of the Master of the Revels.

220
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:28,792
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

221
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,879
The natural condition is one of insurmountable
obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.

222
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:35,631
- So what do we do?
- Nothing.

223
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:39,385
- Strangely enough, it all turns out well.
- How?

224
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:42,387
I don't know.
It's a mystery.

225
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:44,389
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

226
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:46,391
The theaters are reopened...

227
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:50,144
by order of
the Master of the Revels!

228
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:53,397
The theaters are reopened!

229
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,399
Mr. Fennyman.

230
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,901
Mr. Tilney has reopened
the playhouses.

231
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,278
If you wouldn't mind.

232
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,907
Where's the play?

233
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,827
Oh, it's coming.
It's coming.

234
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,414
It's coming.

235
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:25,509
Will!

236
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:27,511
Will, I have wonderful news.

237
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:29,513
So have I.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

238
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:31,514
God, I'm good!

239
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:34,517
Rosaline?
You mean Ethel.

240
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,690
Richard?

241
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:45,026
Burbage!

242
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:53,450
Mr. Tilney.

243
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:57,204
Like you,
I found him not at home.

244
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:02,000
I would've made you immortal.

245
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:08,380
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

246
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:11,133
What does Burbage care of that?

247
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,970
He's readying the Curtain
for Kit Marlowe.

248
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,306
- You've opened the playhouses?
- I have, Master Shakespeare.

249
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,392
- But the plague-
- Yes, I know.

250
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,395
But he was always
hanging around the house.

251
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:41,910
The special today is a pig's
foot marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

252
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:44,871
- served on a buckwheat pancake-
- Will!

253
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:46,748
Have you finished?

254
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,750
Yes, nearly.

255
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,044
- Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice part.
- Yes!

256
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:56,173
- We'll need Ralph for the pirate king.
- Clear that bloody table!

257
00:18:57,424 --> 00:19:00,343
None other than the Admiral's Men
are out on tour.

258
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:02,637
I need actors!

259
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,640
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

260
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:10,811
- What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
- It won't cost you a penny!

261
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:13,813
Auditions in half an hour!

262
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:21,153
Ralph Bagswell,
I'd have a part for you,

263
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:24,073
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard's drunkard.

264
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,074
Never when I'm working.

265
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:28,952
Never when I'm working!

266
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,247
Get me to drink mandragora.

267
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,248
Straight up, Will?

268
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:37,334
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

269
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:39,628
Kit.

270
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,256
- How goes it, Will?
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

271
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,968
- Burbage says you have a play.
- I have, and the chinks to show for it.

272
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:49,804
I insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

273
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,806
I hear you have a new play
for the Curtain.

274
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,975
Not new.
My Doctor Faustus.

275
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:57,519
Ah.
I love your early work.

276
00:19:57,602 --> 00:20:00,522
"Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

277
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:03,149
and burnt the topless towers
of llium?"

278
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:06,152
I have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

279
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:08,153
The Massacre at Paris.

280
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:13,033
- Whew. Good title.
- Mmm. Yours?

281
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:15,535
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

282
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:19,539
Yes, I know. I know.

283
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:21,540
What is the story?

284
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:24,376
Well, there's this pirate-

285
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:29,381
In truth, I have not written a word.

286
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:33,009
Romeo.

287
00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:36,178
Romeo is Italian,

288
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:38,514
always in and out of love.

289
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:40,807
Yes, that's good.
Until he meets-

290
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:43,226
- Ethel.
- Do you think?

291
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,770
- The daughter of his enemy.
- The daughter of his enemy.

292
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:48,064
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

293
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:51,650
by Ethel's brother, or something-
His name is Mercutio.

294
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:53,652
Mercutio.
Good name.

295
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:57,155
- Will! They're waiting for you!
- Yes, I'm coming.

296
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,991
Good luck with yours, Kit.

297
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:03,661
- I thought your play was for Burbage.
- This is a different one.

298
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:05,746
A different one
you haven't written?

299
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,540
Was this the face...

300
00:21:08,624 --> 00:21:11,084
that launched a thousand ships...

301
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:13,586
and burnt the topless
towers of llium?

302
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,255
Thank you.

303
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:17,924
Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

304
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:20,718
- and burnt the top- topless
towers of llium? - Thank you!

305
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,720
Was this the face...

306
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:26,390
that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless-

307
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:31,019
I would like to give you something
from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

308
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:33,354
- How refreshing.
- ... the topless towers of llium?

309
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:36,565
Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.

310
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:41,862
W- Was this the f-

311
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:45,073
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

312
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,784
My tailor wants to be an actor.

313
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:51,287
I have a few debts
here and there.

314
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,372
Well, that seems
to be everybody.

315
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:55,874
- Did you see a Romeo?
- I did not.

316
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:58,209
Well, I to my work,
you to yours.

317
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:01,796
Oh, God.

318
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:08,135
May I begin, sir?

319
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,014
- Your name?
- Thomas Kent.

320
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:17,810
I
- I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.

321
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:25,817
What light is light...

322
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:28,486
if Silvia be not seen?

323
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:34,158
What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by?

324
00:22:35,576 --> 00:22:37,995
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

325
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:41,331
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

326
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:47,837
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

327
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:51,507
there is no music
in the nightingale.

328
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,845
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

329
00:22:56,928 --> 00:23:00,223
there is no day
for me to look upon.

330
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,353
She is my essence,
and I leave to be if I be not-

331
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:09,648
- Take off your hat!
- My hat?

332
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:12,525
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

333
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:14,819
- I-
- Let me see you. Take off your hat.

334
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:17,238
- Are you M-Master Shakespeare?
- Wait there.

335
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:19,198
Wait there!

336
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:35,588
- Will, w-where are the pages?
- Where is the boy?

337
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:41,927
B- B-B-Break a leg!

338
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:48,557
Sir, will you buy
my sweet orange?

339
00:24:07,032 --> 00:24:08,951
Hey!

340
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,135
Everybody ready? All away!

341
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:33,389
- Follow that boat!
- Right you are, governor.

342
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,479
I know your face.
Are you an actor?

343
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,816
- Yes.
- Yes, I think I've seen you in something.

344
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,818
- That one about a king.
- Really?

345
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:50,821
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

346
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:07,294
- Do you know that house?
- Sir Robert De Lesseps.

347
00:25:17,386 --> 00:25:21,348
Where is she? Our guests are upon us!

348
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:25,352
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

349
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:28,438
My husband will have it
settled tonight.

350
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:30,982
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

351
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:34,276
Tomorrow he drags me off
to the country,

352
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,279
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

353
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:42,534
God save you, Mother.

354
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:45,536
Hot water, Nurse.

355
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,541
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

356
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:52,543
- Who, sir?
- The actor.

357
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:54,961
- Who asks for him?
- Will Shakespeare.

358
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:57,047
Poet, playwright of the Rose.

359
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,549
Master Kent...

360
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:02,718
is my nephew.

361
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:04,720
I will wait.

362
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:07,222
Much good may it do you.

363
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:12,894
"Romeo Montague,

364
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:14,896
a Young Man of Verona. "

365
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:16,897
Verona again?

366
00:26:16,981 --> 00:26:18,899
"A comedy
of quarreling families...

367
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:21,235
reconciled in
the discovery of Romeo...

368
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,737
to be the very same
Capulet cousin...

369
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,615
stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...

370
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:32,161
that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king. "

371
00:26:32,244 --> 00:26:34,163
Your mother and your father-

372
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:37,165
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

373
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:39,668
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

374
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:42,670
- He looks well enough for a charlatan.
- Oh, Nurse!

375
00:26:42,754 --> 00:26:44,672
He would give Thomas Kent...

376
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:46,674
the life of
Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

377
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:49,176
My lady, when your parents return,
I will tell.

378
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,178
You will not tell.

379
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:53,513
As I love you and you love me,

380
00:26:53,597 --> 00:26:56,516
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy's wig.

381
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,648
Master Plum.
What business here?

382
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:06,650
The five schilling business, Will.

383
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:08,902
We play for the dancing.

384
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:13,573
Hyah! Hyah, hyah!

385
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,629
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

386
00:27:29,712 --> 00:27:33,257
Musicians don't eat.
Sir Robert's orders.

387
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,259
She's a beauty, my lord,

388
00:27:35,342 --> 00:27:39,221
as would take a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

389
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:42,724
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

390
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:45,726
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

391
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,728
when your grandson is a Wessex.

392
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:49,772
- Is she fertile?
- Oh, she will breed.

393
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:53,608
- If she do not, send her back.
- Is she obedient?

394
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:55,610
As any mule in Christendom.

395
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:58,613
But if you are the man to ride her,

396
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:00,615
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

397
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:03,033
I like her.

398
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:25,095
By all the stars in heaven.

399
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:27,472
Who is she?

400
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:31,017
Viola De Lesseps? Dream on, Will.

401
00:29:09,134 --> 00:29:11,010
Master Shakespeare.

402
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,977
My lady Viola.

403
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,978
My lord.

404
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:24,481
I have spoken with your father.

405
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:27,483
So, my lord?
I speak with him every day.

406
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:46,417
Good sir.

407
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:50,003
I heard you were a poet.

408
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,259
A poet of no words?

409
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,349
Poet?

410
00:30:03,432 --> 00:30:07,561
I was a poet till now, but I've seen
beauty that puts my poems...

411
00:30:07,644 --> 00:30:10,772
at one with the talking ravens
in the Tower.

412
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:14,066
- How do I offend, my lord?
- By coveting my property.

413
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,444
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat anon.

414
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:19,947
Do you have a name?

415
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,782
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

416
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,306
Romeo. Romeo.

417
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,309
A Young Man of Verona.

418
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,145
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

419
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,314
- My lady!
- Who is there?

420
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:01,275
- Will Shakespeare.
- Madam!

421
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:04,778
Anon, good nurse, anon.

422
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:09,491
- Oh, Master Shakespeare.
- The same, alas.

423
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:11,242
But why "alas"?

424
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:13,286
- A lowly player.
- Alas, indeed.

425
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:16,080
For I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

426
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:18,832
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

427
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,334
- Oh, I am him too.
- Madam!

428
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:24,337
Anon!
I will come again.

429
00:31:25,922 --> 00:31:29,383
Oh, I am fortune's fool.
I will be punished for this.

430
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:34,304
Oh, my lady, my love!

431
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:37,682
If they find you here,
they will kill you.

432
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:41,269
- You can bring them with a word.
- Oh, not for the world.

433
00:31:41,352 --> 00:31:44,522
- Madam!
- Anon!

434
00:32:43,616 --> 00:32:45,534
Draw, if you be men!

435
00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:47,536
Gregory, remember thy swashing blow!

436
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:51,039
Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.

437
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:54,042
It starts well, then it's all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

438
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,544
Where's the comedy, Will?
Where's the dog?

439
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,546
Do you think it's funny?

440
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:01,548
I was a pirate king, now I'm a nurse.
That's funny.

441
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:04,468
We are six men short, and those we
have will be overparted ranters...

442
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,970
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

443
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:09,472
My Romeo's let me down.
I see disaster.

444
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:12,099
We are four acts short,
if you're looking for disaster.

445
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:14,101
- Sir!
- Who are you, master?

446
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:17,855
I'm Ethel, sir,
the pirate's daughter.

447
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:19,856
I'll be damned if you are!

448
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,277
Your attention, please!

449
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,780
- Gentlemen, thank you!
- You are welcome.

450
00:33:27,863 --> 00:33:30,449
- Who's that?
- Nobody. He's the author.

451
00:33:30,532 --> 00:33:33,619
We are about to embark
on a great voyage.

452
00:33:33,702 --> 00:33:37,122
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

453
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:39,624
It does no harm.
Authors like it.

454
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:43,044
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we-

455
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:45,045
I'll do it.

456
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:47,548
Now listen to me, you dregs.

457
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,549
Actors are ten a penny,

458
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:53,470
and I, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

459
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:55,722
Huzzah!

460
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:59,391
The Admiral's Men
are returned to the house!

461
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:01,477
Huzzah!

462
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:07,816
Henslowe!

463
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:09,817
Earl! Good to see you.

464
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,822
Who is this?

465
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:17,824
Silence, you dog!

466
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,785
I am Hieronimo.

467
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:23,496
I am Tamburlaine.

468
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,832
I am Faustus.

469
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:29,835
I am Barabbas,
the Jew of Malta.

470
00:34:31,086 --> 00:34:34,006
Oh, yes, Master Will.
I am Henry the Sixth.

471
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:38,259
What is the play,
and what is my part?

472
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,762
- Uh, one moment, sir-
- Who are you?

473
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,848
I'm, um-
I'm the money.

474
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:46,850
Then you may remain,

475
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,852
so long as you remain silent.

476
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:52,022
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

477
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:55,858
- Thank you, sir.
- We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned.

478
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:58,527
A young nobleman of Verona.

479
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:00,529
- And the title of this piece?
- Mercutio.

480
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:03,198
Is it?

481
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:05,784
I will play him.

482
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,829
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

483
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:11,789
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

484
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:13,791
Sam, my pretty one!

485
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:17,878
- Are you ready to fall in love again?
- I am, Master Shakespeare.

486
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:20,171
Your voice.
Have they dropped?

487
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:22,674
No! No.
A touch of cold only.

488
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:26,385
Master Henslowe, you have your actors...
except Thomas Kent.

489
00:35:27,553 --> 00:35:30,014
I, uh, I saw his Tamburlaine,
you know.

490
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:32,015
- It was wonderful.
- Yes, I saw it.

491
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,017
Of course,
such mighty writing.

492
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:36,186
There's no one like Marlowe.

493
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:51,908
Better fortune, boy.

494
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:53,910
I was in a play.

495
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:56,537
They cut my head off
in Titus Andronicus.

496
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,374
When I write plays,
they'll be like Titus.

497
00:36:00,457 --> 00:36:01,917
You admire it.

498
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,085
I liked it
when they cut heads off,

499
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:07,088
and the daughter
mutilated with knives.

500
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:09,215
- What's your name?
- John Webster.

501
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:11,342
Here, kitty, kitty.

502
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:18,015
Plenty of blood.

503
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:20,016
That's the only writing.

504
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:23,561
I have to get back.

505
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:26,772
See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.

506
00:36:26,856 --> 00:36:28,774
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

507
00:36:28,857 --> 00:36:32,277
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.

508
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:34,279
- Cut around him for now.
- What? Who?

509
00:36:34,362 --> 00:36:36,781
- Romeo.
- The one who came with your letter.

510
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:38,783
- What?
- Good morrow, cousin.

511
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,785
Is the day so young?

512
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:44,038
- But new struck nine.
- Ay me. Sad hours seem long.

513
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:47,040
What sadness
lengthens Romeo's hours?

514
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,543
Not having that which having
makes them short.

515
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,544
- Good.
- In love?

516
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,463
- Out.
- Of love?

517
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:57,466
- Out of her favor where I am in love.
- Don't spend it all at once.

518
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:01,720
Yes, sir.

519
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,639
- Do you understand me?
- No, sir.

520
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,976
You're speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

521
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,312
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet?

522
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,397
- Juliet? You mean Ethel.
- God's teeth!

523
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,900
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

524
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:21,738
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

525
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:27,910
I- I'm very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

526
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:31,079
Of course you have not.
I have not written it.

527
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:33,081
Go once more.

528
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:34,958
Will.

529
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,418
Where is Mercutio?

530
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:40,421
Locked safe in here. I'll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

531
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:42,423
I have a sonnet to write.

532
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:44,591
Sonnet?
You mean a play!

533
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,139
For Lady Viola De Lesseps,

534
00:37:51,222 --> 00:37:55,142
by the hand of Thomas Kent.

535
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:57,978
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

536
00:37:58,062 --> 00:38:01,523
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

537
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:07,195
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May-"

538
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:09,280
Two hours at prayer!

539
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:11,782
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

540
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:13,784
Piety is for Sunday!

541
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:16,787
And two hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

542
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,706
It would be better
that you return tomorrow, my lord.

543
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:22,542
It would be better if you'd tell her to
get off her knees and show some civility...

544
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,627
to her six-day
lord and master!

545
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:29,006
Mmmph!

546
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,554
My lady Viola.

547
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:39,056
Lord Wessex.
You've been waiting.

548
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,058
I am aware of it.

549
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:44,228
But it is
beauty's privilege.

550
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:46,396
You flatter, my lord.

551
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,233
No. I have spoken
to the queen.

552
00:38:50,316 --> 00:38:53,569
Her Majesty's consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife,

553
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:56,572
and once given,
her consent is her command.

554
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:59,074
Do you intend to marry,
my lord?

555
00:38:59,158 --> 00:39:01,410
Your father should keep you
better informed.

556
00:39:01,493 --> 00:39:03,912
He has bought me for you.

557
00:39:03,995 --> 00:39:08,583
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

558
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,876
You are allowed
to show your pleasure.

559
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:15,339
But I do not love you,
my lord.

560
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:18,174
How your mind hops about.

561
00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:20,593
Your father
was a shopkeeper.

562
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:23,054
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

563
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:25,598
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

564
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:27,600
You will like Virginia.

565
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:30,269
- Virginia?
- Oh, yes.

566
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:33,438
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

567
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:37,066
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

568
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,069
I fancy tobacco
has a future.

569
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:43,113
We will not stay there long.
Three or four years.

570
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:45,616
But why me?

571
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:47,617
It was your eyes.

572
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:50,078
No, your lips.

573
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:04,215
Will you defy your father
and your queen?

574
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:06,217
The queen has consented?

575
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:08,219
She wants to inspect you.

576
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:10,888
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

577
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:15,309
Be submissive,
modest, grateful...

578
00:40:15,392 --> 00:40:17,310
and brief.

579
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:21,898
I will do my duty, my lord.

580
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:31,239
"Master Will, poet dearest to my heart,

581
00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:35,243
I beseech you
banish me from yours.

582
00:40:35,326 --> 00:40:38,579
I am to marry Lord Wessex.

583
00:40:39,664 --> 00:40:42,082
A daughter's duty...

584
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,585
and the queen's command. "

585
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,940
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

586
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,529
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

587
00:41:15,612 --> 00:41:18,865
Are you a lady Mr. Kent

588
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:20,700
I'm very sorry, sir.

589
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:26,205
We're gonna have to do it again.

590
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:29,958
You did not like the speech?

591
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:31,960
No, the speech is excellent.

592
00:41:32,043 --> 00:41:35,713
"Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you. "

593
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:38,049
Excellent,
and a good length.

594
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:42,511
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

595
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,889
There.
You have this duel.

596
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:49,767
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

597
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:54,897
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

598
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,733
"A plague
on both your houses!"

599
00:42:03,238 --> 00:42:05,156
He dies?

600
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,661
- Ohh!
- Will!

601
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:12,746
Where are my pages?

602
00:42:24,924 --> 00:42:26,925
Did you give her my letter?

603
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:30,720
And this is for you!

604
00:42:43,649 --> 00:42:46,943
Oh, Thomas,
she has cut my strings.

605
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:50,279
I'm unmanned,

606
00:42:50,363 --> 00:42:53,449
unmended and unmade,

607
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:55,451
like a puppet in a box.

608
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:57,619
- Writer, is he?
- Row your boat!

609
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:59,955
She tells me to keep away.

610
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:03,291
She is to marry Lord Wessex!
What should I do?

611
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:06,294
If you love her,
you must do as she asks.

612
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:09,296
- And break her heart and mine?
- It is only yours you can know.

613
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,298
She loves me, Thomas!

614
00:43:11,382 --> 00:43:13,300
- Does she say so?
- No.

615
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:16,303
And yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

616
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:19,806
- Was she weeping when
she gave you this? - Uh-

617
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:22,642
- Her letter came to me by the nurse.
- Your aunt.

618
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,643
Yes, my aunt.

619
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,605
But perhaps
she wept a little.

620
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:33,151
Tell me how
you love her, Will.

621
00:43:33,234 --> 00:43:36,946
Like a sickness
and its cure together.

622
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:39,532
Oh, yes.

623
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:41,992
Like rain and sun.

624
00:43:42,075 --> 00:43:44,661
Like cold and heat.

625
00:43:45,745 --> 00:43:47,580
Is your lady beautiful?

626
00:43:47,664 --> 00:43:51,250
Since I came here from the country,

627
00:43:51,334 --> 00:43:53,252
I have not seen her close.

628
00:43:53,335 --> 00:43:56,255
Tell me, is-
is she beautiful?

629
00:43:56,338 --> 00:44:00,050
Thomas, if I could write
with the beauty of her eyes,

630
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:03,011
I was born to look in them
and know myself.

631
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:06,847
A- A-And her lips?

632
00:44:06,931 --> 00:44:08,849
Her lips?

633
00:44:08,933 --> 00:44:12,436
The early morning rose would whither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

634
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:15,188
And her voice,
like lark's song?

635
00:44:15,272 --> 00:44:18,191
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

636
00:44:18,274 --> 00:44:21,861
I would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

637
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:24,613
- Ah, she sings too?
- Constantly.

638
00:44:24,697 --> 00:44:28,075
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

639
00:44:28,158 --> 00:44:30,202
And her bosom.

640
00:44:30,285 --> 00:44:32,454
Did I mention her bosom?

641
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:34,330
What of her bosom?

642
00:44:34,414 --> 00:44:36,999
Oh, Thomas,
a pair of pippins...

643
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:40,002
as round and rare
as golden apples.

644
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:43,046
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

645
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,549
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

646
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:51,012
when her eyes and lips and voice
may be no more beautiful than mine.

647
00:44:51,095 --> 00:44:53,889
Besides, can a-

648
00:44:53,973 --> 00:44:56,350
can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

649
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:59,686
love happily with
a bankside poet and player?

650
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:02,063
Yes, by God!

651
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:04,899
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

652
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:08,152
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king.

653
00:45:08,235 --> 00:45:10,654
Their love
should be minded by each,

654
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:13,407
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

655
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,493
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

656
00:45:16,576 --> 00:45:18,494
But what of Lord Wessex?

657
00:45:18,578 --> 00:45:21,998
For one kiss I would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

658
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:31,923
Oh, Will.

659
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:35,593
Thank you, my lady.

660
00:45:37,011 --> 00:45:38,929
Lady?

661
00:45:39,013 --> 00:45:41,932
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

662
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,226
Wouldn't deceive a child.

663
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:50,606
Strangely enough,
I'm a bit of a writer meself.

664
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,275
It wouldn't take you long
to read it.

665
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,069
I expect you'd know
all the booksellers!

666
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,579
Can you love a fool?

667
00:46:06,662 --> 00:46:09,456
Can you love a player?

668
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,132
Wait!

669
00:46:19,215 --> 00:46:22,968
You're still a maid, and perhaps as mistook
in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

670
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:25,804
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

671
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:27,472
I am.

672
00:46:27,556 --> 00:46:30,475
Then kiss me again,
for I am not mistook.

673
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:46,447
I do not know
how to undress a man.

674
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:48,449
It is strange to me too.

675
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,475
Go to. Go to.

676
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:13,608
I would not
have thought it.

677
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:17,779
There is something
better than a play.

678
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:20,448
There is.

679
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,950
Even your play.

680
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,953
Oh?

681
00:48:28,246 --> 00:48:30,832
And that was only
my first try.

682
00:48:47,347 --> 00:48:49,265
Will.

683
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,769
You would not leave me.

684
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:56,271
I must.

685
00:48:56,355 --> 00:48:58,273
Look how pale the window.

686
00:48:58,356 --> 00:49:00,275
Moonlight.

687
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:03,236
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

688
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:06,405
It was the owl.
Come to bed.

689
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,909
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

690
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:14,746
Mr. Henslowe?

691
00:49:14,829 --> 00:49:17,248
Mmm, let him be damned
for his pages.

692
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:19,250
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

693
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:22,253
There is time. Mmm!
It is still dark.

694
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:25,255
- It's broad day. The rooster tells us so.
- It was the owl.

695
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:27,632
Believe me, love, it was the owl-

696
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,969
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

697
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,433
My lady?

698
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,268
The house is stirring.
It is a new day.

699
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,772
It is a new world.

700
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,774
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

701
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,485
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

702
00:49:49,568 --> 00:49:52,780
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

703
00:49:52,863 --> 00:49:56,283
and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.

704
00:49:56,366 --> 00:50:00,078
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

705
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:02,080
Aye, pilgrim.

706
00:50:02,163 --> 00:50:04,582
Lips that they must use
in prayer.

707
00:50:04,665 --> 00:50:07,835
Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

708
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:09,836
They pray.

709
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,340
Grant thou, lest faith
turn to despair.

710
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:16,843
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

711
00:50:18,552 --> 00:50:20,471
It's you.

712
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:22,973
Suffering cats!

713
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:25,142
Then move not...

714
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:28,269
while my prayer's effect
I take.

715
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:36,026
Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.

716
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,862
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

717
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:43,700
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

718
00:50:43,783 --> 00:50:46,411
Yes, yes!
Um, not quite right.

719
00:50:46,494 --> 00:50:48,496
It is more-
Let me.

720
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:51,540
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

721
00:50:51,624 --> 00:50:55,919
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

722
00:51:02,383 --> 00:51:04,927
- You kiss by the book.
- Well, Will!

723
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,096
It was lucky you were here.

724
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:09,598
- Why do not I write the
rest of your play- - Yes, yes!

725
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:13,893
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph?

726
00:51:14,185 --> 00:51:17,855
Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.

727
00:51:19,648 --> 00:51:22,401
- What is her mother?
- Marry, bachelor,

728
00:51:22,484 --> 00:51:25,070
her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...

729
00:51:25,153 --> 00:51:27,364
and a wise and virtuous.

730
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:30,366
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

731
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,536
I tell you, he that
can lay hold of her...

732
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:35,538
shall have the chinks.

733
00:51:35,621 --> 00:51:37,623
- Is she a Capulet?
- Mmm.

734
00:51:37,706 --> 00:51:41,459
Oh, dear account!
My life is my foe's debt.

735
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:44,337
Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.

736
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,506
Aye, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.

737
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:51,927
Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman?

738
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,388
The son and heir
of old Tiberio.

739
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:57,098
Let it be night.

740
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:01,144
- What's he that follows here that would not dance?
- I know not.

741
00:52:01,227 --> 00:52:03,104
Go ask his name.

742
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:08,275
If he be married,
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

743
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:11,444
No, do not go.

744
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,446
I must. I must.

745
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,782
- The only son of your great enemy.
- Terrible.

746
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:18,951
Simply... terrible!

747
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:30,294
"But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

748
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:32,463
It is the east,

749
00:52:32,546 --> 00:52:35,174
and Juliet is the sun.

750
00:52:35,257 --> 00:52:39,803
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

751
00:52:39,886 --> 00:52:42,806
who is already sick
and pale with grief...

752
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:47,435
that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she. "

753
00:52:47,518 --> 00:52:50,312
- Oh, Will.
- Yes, some of it's speakable.

754
00:52:50,396 --> 00:52:53,148
"It is my lady.
Oh, it is my love!

755
00:52:53,231 --> 00:52:56,067
Oh, that she knew she were!

756
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:59,737
The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...

757
00:52:59,821 --> 00:53:02,114
as daylight doth a lamp. "

758
00:53:02,198 --> 00:53:05,326
Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...

759
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:07,995
stream so bright...

760
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:12,707
that birds would sing
and think it were not night.

761
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:16,460
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

762
00:53:16,544 --> 00:53:19,463
Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand,

763
00:53:19,547 --> 00:53:21,799
that I might touch
that cheek.

764
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:25,010
- Ay, me.
- "Oh, Romeo.

765
00:53:25,093 --> 00:53:27,137
Romeo.

766
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,806
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

767
00:53:29,889 --> 00:53:33,517
- Deny thy father and-"
- Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

768
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:36,395
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

769
00:53:36,478 --> 00:53:39,231
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

770
00:53:39,314 --> 00:53:41,691
Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?

771
00:53:43,443 --> 00:53:46,195
"What man art thou that
thus bescreened in night...

772
00:53:46,279 --> 00:53:48,989
so stumblest
on my counsel?"

773
00:53:49,073 --> 00:53:52,284
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.

774
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:57,038
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

775
00:53:57,122 --> 00:54:00,583
Had I it written
I would tear the word.

776
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:05,004
"The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...

777
00:54:05,087 --> 00:54:08,256
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

778
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,925
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

779
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:14,053
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee. "

780
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:18,557
Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.

Good night,

793
00:54:34,154 --> 00:54:37,032
as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...

794
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:39,493
as that within my breast.

795
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,786
Oh, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?"

796
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:43,788
That's my line.

797
00:54:43,871 --> 00:54:45,915
Oh. It is mine too.

798
00:54:45,998 --> 00:54:48,918
Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

799

What satifaction
canst thou have tonight?

800
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,839
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

801
00:54:54,923 --> 00:54:58,384
"My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.

802
00:54:58,468 --> 00:55:01,095
My love is deep.

803

the more I have,

00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:10,395
Madam?

807
00:55:10,478 --> 00:55:14,607
- I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
- Juliet!

808
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:19,611
- "Anon, good nurse. "
- Anon, good nurse. Sweet Montague, be true.

809
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:22,614
"Stay but a little.
I will come again. "

810
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:25,617
Stay but a little.
I will come again.

811
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,119
Oh, blessed, blessed night.

812
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:31,789
"I am afeared...

813
00:55:31,872 --> 00:55:36,293
being in night,
all this is but a dream.

814
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:38,795
Too flattering sweet...

815
00:55:38,879 --> 00:55:40,797
to be substantial. "

816
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,886
To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.

817
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,971
A thousand times,
good night.

818
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,473
A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.

819
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:55,185
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

820
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,438
I have no neck in this pig dress.

821
00:56:02,399 --> 00:56:06,111
- How is it?
- It's all right.

822
00:56:10,031 --> 00:56:12,784
Ned, I know, I know.

823
00:56:12,867 --> 00:56:15,786
- It's good.
- Oh?

824
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,622
The title won't do.

825
00:56:18,706 --> 00:56:20,457
Ah.

826
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:24,002
Romeo and Juliet.
Just a suggestion.

827
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:27,130
Thank you, Ned.

828
00:56:29,298 --> 00:56:34,470
- You are a gentleman. - And you
are a Warwickshire shit-house.

829
00:56:34,553 --> 00:56:37,264
- What o'clock tomorrow shall I send to thee?
- By the hour of nine.

830
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:39,557
I shall not fail.
'Tis 20 year till then.

831
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:41,809
I have forgot
why I called thee back.

832
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:44,604
- You mean no dog of any kind?
- Shh! Silence.

833
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:47,356
The friar marries them in secret,

834
00:56:47,439 --> 00:56:50,359
then Ned gets into a fight
with one of the Capulets.

835
00:56:50,442 --> 00:56:54,446
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned's way. I mean, in Mercutio's way.

836
00:56:54,529 --> 00:56:57,699
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

837
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:00,076
Then the prince
banishes him from Verona.

838
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,453
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

839
00:57:02,536 --> 00:57:04,455
on the island
of the pirate king.

840
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:08,416
For God's sake,
cease your prattling and get out!

841
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,960
Get out!

842
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:15,548
A thousand apologies.

843
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:20,052
Please.

844
00:57:20,135 --> 00:57:22,888
And with a silken thread
plucks it back again,

845
00:57:22,971 --> 00:57:25,223
so loving-jealous
of his liberty.

846
00:57:25,306 --> 00:57:30,353
- I would I were thy bird.
- Sweet, so would I; yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.

847
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:34,606
Good night.
Good night.

848
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:39,361
Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.

849
00:57:47,243 --> 00:57:50,037
Sunday.

850
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,247
'Tis Sunday.

851
00:57:58,836 --> 00:58:01,797
I found something
in my sleep.

852
00:58:01,881 --> 00:58:06,426
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

853
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:10,513
- But it will end well for love.
- In heaven, perhaps.

854
00:58:10,597 --> 00:58:13,516
It is not a comedy
I'm writing now.

855
00:58:15,184 --> 00:58:18,312
A broad river
divides my lovers.

856
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:21,565
Family, duty, fate.

857
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:27,195
As unchangeable as nature.

858
00:58:27,278 --> 00:58:29,196
Yes.

859
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:33,242
This is not life, Will.

860
00:58:33,325 --> 00:58:36,369
It is a stolen season.

861
00:58:36,453 --> 00:58:38,371
- Be patient, my lord.
- Patient?

862
00:58:38,455 --> 00:58:41,332
- Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
- My Lord, I will go-

863
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:44,502
Sunday. Greenwich!

864
00:58:48,005 --> 00:58:49,923
Now, pay attention, nursie.

865
00:58:50,007 --> 00:58:52,509
The queen-
Gloriana Regina,

866
00:58:52,592 --> 00:58:56,095
God's chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us-

867
00:58:56,179 --> 00:58:59,307
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening's festivities...

868
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:02,559
to bestow her gracious favor
on my choice of wife.

869
00:59:02,643 --> 00:59:05,270
And if we're late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

870
00:59:05,354 --> 00:59:09,524
So get you to my lady's chamber and produce
her with or without her undergarments!

871
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:11,943
You cannot!
Not for the queen herself!

872
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:15,571
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

873
00:59:15,654 --> 00:59:18,115
To be the wife
of a poor player.

874
00:59:18,198 --> 00:59:22,077
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

875
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,455
And yet I would if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

876
00:59:25,538 --> 00:59:28,374
You follow your desire
freely enough in the night.

877
00:59:28,457 --> 00:59:32,044
- So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
- Then I'll go with you.

878
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:34,880
- You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
- I know how to fight.

879
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:37,465
Stage fighting.

880
00:59:37,549 --> 00:59:39,634
Oh, Will.

881
00:59:40,802 --> 00:59:43,221
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you,

882
00:59:43,304 --> 00:59:46,640
but as Viola,
the river divides us,

883
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:50,811
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

884
00:59:50,894 --> 00:59:53,813
I'll drag her down
by the queen's command!

885
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:58,734
Good morning, my Lord.

886
00:59:58,818 --> 01:00:03,864
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

887
01:00:03,947 --> 01:00:07,492
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

888
01:00:07,575 --> 01:00:10,036
Are you bringing
your laundrywoman?

889
01:00:12,413 --> 01:00:15,124
Her chaperone,
my lady's country cousin.

890
01:00:15,207 --> 01:00:18,752
My, but you be
a handsome gallant,

891
01:00:18,835 --> 01:00:21,171
just as she said.

892
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:23,715
You may call me
Miss Wilhelmina.

893
01:00:23,798 --> 01:00:26,217
On a more fortuitous
occasion, perhaps.

894
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,136
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

895
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:33,849
Aye, she never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

896
01:01:06,878 --> 01:01:08,796
- Now?
- Now.

897
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,883
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

898
01:01:14,802 --> 01:01:17,096
- Is there a man?
- A man, my lord?

902
01:01:17,179 --> 01:01:20,765
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, I think.

903
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:23,726
- Does he come to the house?
- A theater poet?

904
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:27,313
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

905
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:29,690
- Has he been to the house?
- Marlowe?

906
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:32,067
Oh, yes. He is the one.

907
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:35,695
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

908
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:38,448
That dog!

909
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:56,255
Your Majesty.

910
01:01:57,465 --> 01:01:59,758
Stand up straight, girl.

911
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,305
I've seen you.

912
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:09,100
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

913
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:11,769
Your Majesty.

914
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:14,271
What do you love so much?

915
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,815
- Your Majesty-
- Speak up, girl!

916
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,984
I know who I am.

917
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:22,445
Do you love stories
of kings and queens?

918
01:02:22,529 --> 01:02:24,447
Of feats of arms?

919
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:27,241
Or is it courtly love?

920
01:02:27,325 --> 01:02:29,285
I love theater.

921
01:02:29,368 --> 01:02:32,329
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed-

922
01:02:32,412 --> 01:02:36,041
They're not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And?

923
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:40,211
And I love poetry above all.

924
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:42,213
Above Lord Wessex?

925
01:02:42,296 --> 01:02:44,840
My lord,
when you cannot find your wife,

926
01:02:44,924 --> 01:02:47,342
you better look for her
at the playhouse.

927
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:52,639
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

928
01:02:52,722 --> 01:02:56,058
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

929
01:02:56,142 --> 01:02:58,060
They cannot make it true.

930
01:02:58,144 --> 01:03:00,938
Oh, but they can.

931
01:03:03,398 --> 01:03:08,486
I mean, Your Majesty, they-
they do not, they have... not,

932
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:10,863
but I believe
there is one who can.

933
01:03:12,365 --> 01:03:14,992
My Lady Viola is young in the world.

934
01:03:15,075 --> 01:03:17,035
Your Majesty is wise in it.

935
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,121
Nature and truth are the very enemies
of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

936
01:03:20,205 --> 01:03:23,082
I thought you were here
because you had none.

937
01:03:28,963 --> 01:03:33,175
- Well, no one will take your wager, it seems.
- Fifty pounds.

938
01:03:35,844 --> 01:03:37,720
Fifty pounds?

939
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:44,184
A very worthy sum
on a very worthy question.

940
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:47,646
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

941
01:03:49,481 --> 01:03:52,734
I bear witness to the wager...

942
01:03:52,817 --> 01:03:55,945
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

943
01:03:58,656 --> 01:04:01,366
I have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

944
01:04:02,284 --> 01:04:04,869
Are there
no more fireworks?

945
01:04:04,953 --> 01:04:08,873
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola's audience.

946
01:04:08,956 --> 01:04:13,169
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

947
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:17,214
She's been plucked since I saw her last,
and not by you.

948
01:04:17,297 --> 01:04:20,216
It takes a woman to know it.

949
01:04:23,845 --> 01:04:25,763
Marlowe.

950
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:38,608
Burbage?

951
01:04:38,691 --> 01:04:41,569
Huh? Who's there?

952
01:04:41,652 --> 01:04:44,321
Marlowe.

953
01:04:45,864 --> 01:04:47,908
You are playing
my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

954
01:04:47,991 --> 01:04:50,201
Don't spend yourself
in sport.

955
01:04:50,285 --> 01:04:53,871
- What do you want, Kit?
- My Massacre at Paris is complete.

956
01:04:53,955 --> 01:04:57,249
- What? You have the last act?
- If you have the money.

957
01:04:57,333 --> 01:05:01,420
- Tomorrow.
- Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

958
01:05:01,503 --> 01:05:03,797
Oh, will you desist, madam!

959
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,799
- Oh!
- Twenty pounds on delivery.

960
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:10,177
Now, what is money to men like us?

961
01:05:11,095 --> 01:05:16,016
Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting
- a comedy by Shakespeare.

962
01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:17,976
Oh, Romeo.

963
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,312
- Gave it to Henslowe.
- Never!

964
01:05:21,396 --> 01:05:24,398
Well, I'm to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

965
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,568
I gave Shakespeare
two sovereigns for Romeo.

966
01:05:27,651 --> 01:05:32,072
You did, but Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's
Men have the playing of it at the Rose.

967
01:05:32,155 --> 01:05:34,115
Treachery!

968
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,702
Traitor and thief!

969
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:42,873
Oh, no.

970
01:05:42,915 --> 01:05:44,958
No!

971
01:06:02,724 --> 01:06:04,809
By my head,
here comes the Capulets.

972
01:06:04,893 --> 01:06:07,812
By my heel,
I care not.

973
01:06:08,938 --> 01:06:11,190
Follow me close.
I will speak with them.

974
01:06:11,273 --> 01:06:14,318
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

975
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:16,653
Are you going
to do it like that?

976
01:06:16,737 --> 01:06:18,947
Positions.

977
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:23,326
- By my head, here comes the Capulets.
- By my heel, I care not.

978
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:25,661
Follow me close.
I will speak to them.

979
01:06:25,745 --> 01:06:28,664
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

980
01:06:28,956 --> 01:06:32,167
And but one word with one of us?

981
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:35,045
Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.

982
01:06:35,086 --> 01:06:38,840
Where's that thieving hack that
can't keep his pen in his own ink pot?

983
01:06:38,923 --> 01:06:41,050
What is this rabble?

984
01:06:43,385 --> 01:06:46,179
Draw, if you be a man!

985
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,577
Wonderful.
Wonderful!

986
01:07:12,453 --> 01:07:15,914
And a dog.

987
01:07:17,457 --> 01:07:19,417
No!

988
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:22,754
Have privy, players! Please!

989
01:07:22,837 --> 01:07:25,714
Oh! Not with my props!

990
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:27,216
Oh!

991
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:30,218
- Will! What-
- A writer's quarrel.

992
01:07:30,302 --> 01:07:32,721
Quite normal.

993
01:07:34,097 --> 01:07:36,224
Stay here.

994
01:07:47,776 --> 01:07:50,570
You are hurt.

995
01:08:03,373 --> 01:08:06,959
I dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

996
01:08:07,043 --> 01:08:10,004
- You were cast ashore in a far country.
- Oh, not yet.

997
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,006
Not yet.

998
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:15,050
'Ey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

999
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,469
My investment!
Lambert!

1000
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,139
Vengeance!

1001
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,665
A famous victory!

1002
01:08:50,748 --> 01:08:54,835
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house!

1003
01:08:54,919 --> 01:08:57,463
Oh, what happy hour.

1004
01:08:57,546 --> 01:09:00,799
- This is a tavern!
- It is also a tavern.

1005
01:09:00,882 --> 01:09:03,510
- I remember you. The poet!
- Yes, William the Conqueror.

1006
01:09:05,595 --> 01:09:08,347
One at a time. One at a time.

1007
01:09:08,431 --> 01:09:12,309
Oh, he's a pretty one. Tell me
your story while I tickle your fancy.

1008
01:09:16,438 --> 01:09:20,191
- It's a house of ill repute.
- It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

1009
01:09:20,275 --> 01:09:23,152
Come.
There's no harm in a drink.

1010
01:09:23,236 --> 01:09:28,031
You are welcome to my best house.
Here's to the Admiral's Men.

1011
01:09:28,115 --> 01:09:29,825
- The Admiral's Men!
- The Admiral's Men!

1012
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:31,826
The Admiral's Men!

1013
01:09:54,972 --> 01:09:58,225
Well, I-
I quite liked it.

1014
01:09:58,308 --> 01:10:00,727
Master Kent,

1015
01:10:00,811 --> 01:10:03,646
you have not yet
dipped your wick.

1016
01:10:05,732 --> 01:10:08,150
My "wick"?

1017
01:10:08,234 --> 01:10:12,029
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the
theater, you must have a part in my play.

1018
01:10:12,112 --> 01:10:17,075
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

1019
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:20,244
My heavens.
I thank you.

1020
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:22,622
What's the play about, then?

1021
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:24,874
Well, there's this nurse-

1022
01:10:30,337 --> 01:10:33,089
Silence, silence, silence!

1023
01:10:33,173 --> 01:10:35,550
Master Shakespeare...

1024
01:10:35,633 --> 01:10:39,929
has asked me to play
the part of the apothecary.

1025
01:10:42,139 --> 01:10:44,725
The apothecary?

1026
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:47,852
What is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

1027
01:10:47,936 --> 01:10:50,104
How does the comedy end?

1028
01:10:50,188 --> 01:10:54,400
- By God, I wish I knew.
- By God, if you do not, who does?

1029
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:58,111
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending,

1030
01:10:58,195 --> 01:11:01,448
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

1031
01:11:18,046 --> 01:11:21,299
Will! Mr. Henslowe!
Gentlemen all!

1032
01:11:21,382 --> 01:11:25,177
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

1033
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:27,679
Marlowe is dead.

1034
01:11:31,599 --> 01:11:33,935
Stabbed.

1035
01:11:34,018 --> 01:11:38,397
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

1036
01:11:40,733 --> 01:11:43,277
What have I done?

1037
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,196
He was the first man among us.

1038
01:11:46,279 --> 01:11:48,948
A great light has gone out.

1039
01:12:04,712 --> 01:12:06,756
Forgive me.

1040
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,052
God forgive me.

1041
01:12:38,617 --> 01:12:41,787
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake.

1042
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:44,289
One morning
in the month of May

1043
01:12:44,372 --> 01:12:47,417
From my cot I stray

1044
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,169
Just at the dawning
of the day

1045
01:12:50,253 --> 01:12:52,838
I met with
a charming mai-

1046
01:12:54,757 --> 01:12:58,510
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

1047
01:12:58,593 --> 01:13:02,013
- It's not my riding day, my lord.
- Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

1048
01:13:02,096 --> 01:13:04,724
I'm going to church.

1049
01:13:04,807 --> 01:13:08,519
Of course. I understand.
It is to be expected.

1050
01:13:08,602 --> 01:13:12,022
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

1051
01:13:12,105 --> 01:13:15,400
And on a day of mourning.

1052
01:13:15,483 --> 01:13:18,611
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

1053
01:13:18,695 --> 01:13:20,696
Mourning?

1054
01:13:22,448 --> 01:13:25,200
Who is dead, my lord?

1055
01:13:25,284 --> 01:13:30,205
Oh! Dear God, I did not think
it would be me to tell you.

1056
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:34,917
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

1057
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:37,962
My lady.

1058
01:13:38,045 --> 01:13:41,715
- He is dead?
- Killed last night in a tavern.

1059
01:13:43,341 --> 01:13:46,094
Come then.
We'll say a prayer for his soul.

1060
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:59,356
Who can remember sorrow

1061
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:35,680
Spare me, dear ghost.

1062
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:38,599
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me!

1063
01:14:51,861 --> 01:14:53,779
Will!

1064
01:14:55,197 --> 01:14:57,115
Oh, my love.

1065
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,117
I thought you were dead.

1066
01:15:04,413 --> 01:15:07,124
It is worse.

1067
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:09,460
I've killed a man.

1068
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:16,466
Marlowe's touch
was in my Titus Andronicus,

1069
01:15:16,549 --> 01:15:20,219
and my Henry VI was a house built
on his foundations.

1070
01:15:21,345 --> 01:15:23,931
You never spoke
so well of him.

1071
01:15:24,014 --> 01:15:27,142
He was not dead before.

1072
01:15:27,225 --> 01:15:31,980
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

1073
01:15:33,314 --> 01:15:35,483
You lie.

1074
01:15:37,151 --> 01:15:41,321
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

1075
01:15:41,405 --> 01:15:43,865
My love is no lie.

1076
01:15:45,033 --> 01:15:47,577
I have a wife, yes,

1077
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:50,913
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1078
01:15:50,996 --> 01:15:54,708
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that,

1079
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:59,170
and yet, you let me
come to your bed.

1080
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:02,507
Calf-love.

1081
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:07,011
I loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

1082
01:16:07,094 --> 01:16:09,847
I was the more deceived.

1083
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:12,849
Yes, you were deceived,

1084
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:16,311
for I did not know
how much I loved you.

1085
01:16:18,938 --> 01:16:22,024
I love you, Will,

1086
01:16:22,107 --> 01:16:24,193
beyond poetry.

1087
01:16:24,276 --> 01:16:26,778
Oh, my love.

1088
01:16:26,862 --> 01:16:30,907
- You ran from me before.
- When I thought you dead, I did not care...

1089
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:33,284
about all the plays
that would never come,

1090
01:16:33,367 --> 01:16:36,078
only that I would
never see your face.

1091
01:16:36,162 --> 01:16:39,456
I saw our end,
and it will come.

1092
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:44,044
- You cannot marry Wessex.
- If not you, why not Wessex?

1093
01:16:44,127 --> 01:16:46,713
If not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause,

1094
01:16:46,796 --> 01:16:51,467
- and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
- No. No.

1095
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:56,054
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows,

1096
01:16:56,138 --> 01:16:59,057
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

1097
01:17:00,642 --> 01:17:03,895
For killing Juliet's
kinsman Tybalt,

1098
01:17:03,978 --> 01:17:06,897
the one who killed
Romeo's friend Mercutio,

1099
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:08,941
Romeo is banished.

1100
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:11,610
- But the friar who married
Romeo and Juliet- - Is that me?

1101
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:16,572
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1102
01:17:16,656 --> 01:17:20,409
It is a secret potion.
It makes us seeming dead.

1103
01:17:20,493 --> 01:17:23,454
She is placed in the tomb
of the Capulets.

1104
01:17:23,537 --> 01:17:26,289
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

1105
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,545
I have not said all.

1106
01:17:32,628 --> 01:17:37,800
By maligned fate, the message goes astray
which would tell Romeo of the friar's plan.

1107
01:17:37,883 --> 01:17:41,261
He hears only
that Juliet is dead.

1108
01:17:41,344 --> 01:17:44,347
And thus he goes
to the apothecary...

1109
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:46,349
That's me.

1110
01:17:46,432 --> 01:17:48,684
and buys a deadly poison.

1111
01:17:48,768 --> 01:17:53,689
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet who lies there cold as death.

1112
01:17:53,772 --> 01:17:56,108
He drinks the poison.

1113
01:17:57,567 --> 01:17:59,819
He dies by her side,

1114
01:18:01,404 --> 01:18:04,865
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

1115
01:18:04,949 --> 01:18:08,077
And so Juliet
takes his dagger...

1116
01:18:10,037 --> 01:18:13,039
and then kills herself.

1117
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:19,253
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

1118
01:18:19,336 --> 01:18:22,214
Sad... and wonderful.

1119
01:18:23,382 --> 01:18:26,218
I have a blue velvet cap
that'll do well.

1120
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:29,053
I've seen just such a cap
on an apothecary.

1121
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,139
Just so.

1122
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:35,476
Yes, it will serve.

1123
01:18:37,394 --> 01:18:39,688
But there's a scene missing.

1124
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:42,649
Between marriage
and death?

1125
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:53,158
The play...
all written out for you.

1126
01:18:54,701 --> 01:18:57,329
I had the clerk
at Bridewell do it.

1127
01:18:57,412 --> 01:18:59,831
He has a good fist
for lettering.

1128
01:19:01,999 --> 01:19:03,918
There is a new scene.

1129
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:15,094
- Will you read in for me?
- "Wilt thou be gone? It's not yet near day.

1130
01:19:15,178 --> 01:19:17,930
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

1131
01:19:18,014 --> 01:19:20,599
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear.

1132
01:19:20,683 --> 01:19:23,769
Nightly she sings
on yon pomegranate tree.

1133
01:19:23,852 --> 01:19:26,688
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale. "

1134
01:19:26,771 --> 01:19:30,817
"It was the lark,
the herald of the morn;

1135
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,235
no nightingale.

1136
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:36,238
Look, love,
what envious streaks...

1137
01:19:36,322 --> 01:19:40,450
do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.

1138
01:19:40,534 --> 01:19:44,370
Night's candles
are burnt out,

1139
01:19:44,454 --> 01:19:46,873
and jocund day
stands tiptoe...

1140
01:19:46,956 --> 01:19:50,334
on the misty mountaintops.

1141
01:19:50,417 --> 01:19:54,880
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die. "

1142
01:19:56,631 --> 01:20:00,676
"Yon light is not daylight;
I know it, I.

1143
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,721
It is some meteor
that the sun exhales...

1144
01:20:03,804 --> 01:20:08,475
to be to thee this night
a torchbearer...

1145
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:11,770
to light thee
on thy way to Mantua.

1146
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:15,690
Therefore, stay yet.

1147
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:19,318
Thou needst not
to be gone. "

1148
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:21,653
"Let me be ta'en,

1149
01:20:21,737 --> 01:20:24,823
let me be put to death;

1150
01:20:24,906 --> 01:20:29,244
I am content,
so thou wilt have it so.

1151
01:20:29,327 --> 01:20:31,913
I have more care
to stay...

1152
01:20:31,996 --> 01:20:34,373
than will to go.

1153
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:36,834
Come, death, and welcome.

1154
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:39,920
Juliet wills it so. "

1155
01:21:02,857 --> 01:21:05,943
You will go far, I fear.

1156
01:21:09,905 --> 01:21:12,449
I hope we work
together again.

1157
01:21:15,118 --> 01:21:18,120
"Such mortal drugs I have,
but Mantua's law...

1158
01:21:18,204 --> 01:21:22,499
is death, death to
any he that utters them. "

1159
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:24,209
Then him. Then me.

1160
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:27,795
"Put- Put this...

1161
01:21:27,879 --> 01:21:30,256
- in any liquid thing you will and-"
- Hah!

1162
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:34,551
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

1163
01:21:34,635 --> 01:21:38,638
How silver sweet sound
lovers' tongues by night.

1164
01:21:38,722 --> 01:21:40,640
- Like soft music-
- Shakespeare!

1165
01:21:58,072 --> 01:22:00,032
Upstart inky pup!

1166
01:22:01,158 --> 01:22:04,036
I'll show you your place,
which is in hell!

1167
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:11,835
- You're on my ground now!
- By God, I'll fight the lot of you!

1168
01:22:11,918 --> 01:22:13,836
I am more than enough!

1169
01:22:21,468 --> 01:22:23,678
Move!

1170
01:23:45,084 --> 01:23:47,253
Absent friends.

1171
01:23:48,671 --> 01:23:51,632
This is the murderer
of Kit Marlowe!

1172
01:23:53,008 --> 01:23:54,926
Will?

1173
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:58,262
I rejoiced in his death because I thought
it was yours! That is all I know of Marlowe!

1174
01:23:58,346 --> 01:24:01,932
Will? Uh, it's true.

1175
01:24:02,016 --> 01:24:04,810
It was a... tavern brawl.

1176
01:24:04,893 --> 01:24:09,856
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

1177
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,150
A quarrel about the bill.

1178
01:24:12,233 --> 01:24:15,486
The bill?
Oh, vanity, vanity!

1179
01:24:15,569 --> 01:24:17,947
Not the billing,
the bill!

1180
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:23,952
Oh, God.

1181
01:24:24,035 --> 01:24:26,538
- I am free of it.
- Where is she?

1182
01:24:27,372 --> 01:24:29,624
Close it.

1183
01:24:29,707 --> 01:24:34,169
- My Lord Wessex.
- The Rose harbors the ass that shits on my name!

1184
01:24:34,253 --> 01:24:36,463
Take it down
stone by stone.

1185
01:24:36,546 --> 01:24:40,258
I want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

1186
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:42,218
Mr. Tilney,
what is this?

1187
01:24:42,302 --> 01:24:44,720
Sedition and indecency.

1188
01:24:44,804 --> 01:24:47,514
Master of the Revels, sir.
She's over here.

1189
01:24:47,598 --> 01:24:50,225
- Where, boy?
- There.

1190
01:24:50,309 --> 01:24:52,477
I saw her bubbies.

1191
01:24:52,561 --> 01:24:56,940
So, a woman on the stage!

1192
01:24:57,023 --> 01:25:01,152
A woman!
I say this theater is closed!

1193
01:25:01,235 --> 01:25:02,695
Why, sir?

1194
01:25:02,778 --> 01:25:06,907
For lewdness
and unshamedfacedness!

1195
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:11,869
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

1196
01:25:26,966 --> 01:25:29,010
Not him, her!

1197
01:25:32,346 --> 01:25:34,014
That's who I meant.

1198
01:25:36,683 --> 01:25:40,186
- He's a woman.
- This theater is closed.

1199
01:25:42,105 --> 01:25:45,524
Notice will be posted!

1200
01:25:45,608 --> 01:25:48,569
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

1201
01:25:48,652 --> 01:25:51,530
- Nobody knew.
- He did.

1202
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:54,616
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

1203
01:25:57,076 --> 01:26:00,204
It is over.

1204
01:26:00,287 --> 01:26:03,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1205
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:20,389
I wanted to be an actor.

1206
01:26:20,472 --> 01:26:22,933
I'm so sorry, Will.

1207
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:32,066
You were... w-w-

1208
01:26:33,317 --> 01:26:35,569
w- wonderful.

1209
01:26:37,154 --> 01:26:39,406
Thank you.

1210
01:26:47,996 --> 01:26:52,250
"Let me put this in any
liquid thing you will and-"

1211
01:26:58,673 --> 01:27:01,258
Everything all right?

1212
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:41,919
I would've been good.

1213
01:27:42,003 --> 01:27:45,089
- I would've been great.
- So would I.

1214
01:27:45,172 --> 01:27:47,591
We both would.

1215
01:28:09,861 --> 01:28:12,321
Lambert, kill him.

1216
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:15,908
That can wait.

1217
01:28:19,578 --> 01:28:24,791
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1218
01:28:26,417 --> 01:28:28,544
But my father,
James Burbage,

1219
01:28:28,627 --> 01:28:33,090
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty,

1220
01:28:33,173 --> 01:28:37,886
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

1221
01:28:37,969 --> 01:28:41,472
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

1222
01:28:41,556 --> 01:28:43,557
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1223
01:28:45,059 --> 01:28:49,521
I have a theater.
The curtain is yours.

1224
01:29:22,467 --> 01:29:26,345
Will!
We'll be needing a Romeo.

1225
01:29:33,143 --> 01:29:35,270
Oranges!
Sweet oranges!

1226
01:30:03,045 --> 01:30:07,257
My ship is moored at bankside, bound for
Virginia on the afternoon tide.

1227
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:09,425
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.

1228
01:30:09,509 --> 01:30:11,427
You are gaining a colony.

1229
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:14,346
And you, my lord,
are gaining 5,000 pounds...

1230
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:16,932
by these drafts in my hand.

1231
01:30:17,015 --> 01:30:19,768
Would you oblige me
with 50 or so in gold...

1232
01:30:19,851 --> 01:30:22,937
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside?

1233
01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:27,108
Ah, the bride!

1234
01:30:28,359 --> 01:30:31,278
Good morning, my lord.

1235
01:30:31,361 --> 01:30:35,323
I see you are... open for business,
so let's to church.

1236
01:30:40,536 --> 01:30:42,455
Be gone!

1237
01:30:42,538 --> 01:30:44,665
Hup, hup, hup!

1238
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,758
Oh, my lord!

1239
01:31:42,842 --> 01:31:45,427
- Be good to her, my lord.
- I will.

1240
01:31:45,511 --> 01:31:47,596
Oh, God bless you!

1241
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:50,515
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There's a good nurse.

1242
01:31:50,598 --> 01:31:52,559
The tide will not wait!

1243
01:31:52,642 --> 01:31:56,520
Farewell!
You'll all be welcome in Virginia!

1244
01:32:23,044 --> 01:32:27,715
Candy apples!

1245
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:31,343
Buy my apples!

1246
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:38,057
Thank you, sir.
Apples!

1247
01:32:45,564 --> 01:32:48,942
Is this, uh-
Is this all right?

1248
01:32:49,025 --> 01:32:50,944
Yeah.

1249
01:33:06,249 --> 01:33:10,586
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

1250
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:15,215
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show!

1251
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:20,261
This is the very business
of show!

1252
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:33,940
T- T- T-Two-

1253
01:33:34,024 --> 01:33:36,651
T- T-T-T- T- T-

1254
01:33:36,734 --> 01:33:40,404
T- T-T-Two households-

1255
01:33:40,488 --> 01:33:43,449
- We're lost.
- No, it will turn out well.

1256
01:33:43,532 --> 01:33:46,993
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

1257
01:33:49,496 --> 01:33:53,041
T- T- T- T-T-

1258
01:33:53,124 --> 01:33:55,459
T- T-

1259
01:34:46,755 --> 01:34:49,299
Two households,

1260
01:34:49,382 --> 01:34:52,510
both alike in dignity,

1261
01:34:52,593 --> 01:34:55,346
in fair Verona,

1262
01:34:55,429 --> 01:34:58,015
where we lay our scene.

1263
01:34:58,098 --> 01:35:01,143
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny,

1264
01:35:01,226 --> 01:35:04,604
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

1265
01:35:04,687 --> 01:35:07,690
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

1266
01:35:07,774 --> 01:35:10,901
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

1267
01:35:10,985 --> 01:35:13,737
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

1268
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:17,282
doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

1269
01:35:20,451 --> 01:35:23,538
...the which of you
with patient ears attend,

1270
01:35:23,621 --> 01:35:28,375
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

1271
01:35:34,714 --> 01:35:36,716
- Wonderful.
- Was it...

1272
01:35:37,842 --> 01:35:39,885
good?

1273
01:35:42,638 --> 01:35:45,807
Gregory, on my word
we'll not carry coals.

1274
01:35:45,891 --> 01:35:48,935
No, for then
we should be colliers.

1275
01:35:49,018 --> 01:35:51,521
I mean, and we be
in choler we'll draw.

1276
01:35:51,604 --> 01:35:54,690
- Master Shakespeare.
- Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

1277
01:35:54,774 --> 01:35:57,234
It's not my fault.
I could do it yesterday.

1278
01:35:57,318 --> 01:36:00,487
Do me a speech.
Do me a line.

1279
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:04,407
"Parting is such sweet sorrow. "

1280
01:36:04,491 --> 01:36:07,743
- Another little problem.
- What do we do now?

1281
01:36:07,827 --> 01:36:11,747
- The show must- You know.
- Go on!

1282
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:15,250
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

1283
01:36:15,334 --> 01:36:17,752
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

1284
01:36:17,836 --> 01:36:20,129
- Fear me not.
- No, marry, I fear thee!

1285
01:36:22,548 --> 01:36:25,426
- Let them begin.
- I will frown as I pass by.

1286
01:36:25,509 --> 01:36:29,304
- Let them take it as they list!
- Nay, as they dare.

1287
01:36:29,388 --> 01:36:33,433
I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.

1288
01:36:33,516 --> 01:36:36,436
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

1289
01:36:36,519 --> 01:36:39,814
- I do bite my thumb, sir.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

1290
01:36:39,897 --> 01:36:43,525
- Thank you. Excuse me.
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

1291
01:36:43,609 --> 01:36:45,527
- Can we talk?
- Shh!

1292
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:48,446
- We have no Juliet.
- No Juliet?

1293
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:51,657
- No Juliet?
- It'll be all right, madam.

1294
01:36:51,741 --> 01:36:54,827
- What happened to Sam? -
Who are you? - Thomas Kent.

1295
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:57,496
Do you know it?

1296
01:36:57,579 --> 01:37:00,707
- I serve as good a man as you.
- Every word.

1297
01:37:04,544 --> 01:37:07,171
Hyah! Yah!

1298
01:37:10,966 --> 01:37:13,969
I'll go along,
no such sight to be shown,

1299
01:37:14,052 --> 01:37:17,180
but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.

1300
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:19,557
Nurse!

1301
01:37:21,934 --> 01:37:25,187
Where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

1302
01:37:25,271 --> 01:37:28,482
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

1303
01:37:28,565 --> 01:37:30,484
I bade her come.

1304
01:37:30,567 --> 01:37:32,652
How now, who calls?

1305
01:37:32,736 --> 01:37:35,488
What, ladybird!

1306
01:37:35,571 --> 01:37:37,323
God forbid!
Where's this girl?

1307
01:37:37,406 --> 01:37:40,034
What, lamb!

1308
01:37:40,117 --> 01:37:42,327
What, ladybird!

1309
01:37:43,412 --> 01:37:45,831
What, Juliet!

1310
01:37:46,957 --> 01:37:50,335
How now, who calls?

1311
01:37:53,296 --> 01:37:57,883
- We'll all be put in the Clink.
- See you in jail.

1312
01:38:01,011 --> 01:38:04,180
Your mother-
Your mother.

1313
01:38:04,264 --> 01:38:07,558
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

1314
01:38:07,642 --> 01:38:09,685
This is the matter.

1315
01:38:09,768 --> 01:38:12,187
Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.

1316
01:38:12,271 --> 01:38:17,025
Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.

1317
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:20,445
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

1318
01:38:20,528 --> 01:38:24,031
- Faith, I know her age unto an hour.
- She's not 14.

1319
01:38:24,115 --> 01:38:29,619
Oh, I'll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken,

1320
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:32,455
I have but four-

1321
01:38:54,642 --> 01:38:56,685
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

1322
01:38:56,769 --> 01:39:01,356
how stands your dispositions
to be married?

1323
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:04,567
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

1324
01:39:08,863 --> 01:39:11,740
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

1325
01:39:19,497 --> 01:39:22,708
I- I'm sped.

1326
01:39:22,792 --> 01:39:25,586
Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.

1327
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:28,046
Ask for me tomorrow,

1328
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:30,966
you shall find me
a grave man.

1329
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:41,433
Yes!

1330
01:39:46,688 --> 01:39:48,606
Yah!

1331
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:51,234
"Such mortal drugs I have,

1332
01:39:51,317 --> 01:39:55,988
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them. "

1333
01:39:56,071 --> 01:39:58,615
Then him. Then me.

1334
01:40:07,081 --> 01:40:09,166
Romeo, away, be gone!

1335
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:13,670
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed!

1336
01:40:13,754 --> 01:40:18,007
The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

1337
01:40:19,217 --> 01:40:21,552
Oh, I am Fortune's fool!

1338
01:40:21,636 --> 01:40:23,554
Why dost thou stay?

1339
01:40:23,637 --> 01:40:25,639
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?

1340
01:40:25,723 --> 01:40:27,933
That murderer,
which way ran he?

1341
01:40:28,016 --> 01:40:30,810
- There lies that Tybalt.
- Up, sir. Go with me.

1342
01:40:30,894 --> 01:40:32,937
I charge thee
in the Prince's name obey.

1343
01:40:33,021 --> 01:40:35,731
Where are the vile beginners
of this fray?

1344
01:40:35,815 --> 01:40:38,067
"Oh, I am Fortune's fool. "

1345
01:40:40,861 --> 01:40:42,821
You are married?

1346
01:40:46,449 --> 01:40:51,495
"If you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed. "

1347
01:41:07,259 --> 01:41:09,470
Art thou gone so,

1348
01:41:12,097 --> 01:41:14,224
love, lord,

1349
01:41:14,307 --> 01:41:16,518
aye, husband, friend?

1350
01:41:16,601 --> 01:41:21,355
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

1351
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:24,358
for in a minute
there are many days.

1352
01:41:24,441 --> 01:41:28,028
Oh, by this count
I shall be much in years ere again...

1353
01:41:28,111 --> 01:41:30,530
I behold my Romeo.

1354
01:41:30,613 --> 01:41:32,532
Farewell.

1355
01:41:34,033 --> 01:41:36,952
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

1356
01:41:38,996 --> 01:41:42,040
Methinks I see thee,
now thou art so low,

1357
01:41:42,124 --> 01:41:45,585
as one dead
in the bottom of a tomb.

1358
01:41:45,668 --> 01:41:49,046
Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look'st pale.

1359
01:41:51,298 --> 01:41:53,509
Then trust me, love,

1360
01:41:53,592 --> 01:41:55,928
in my eyes, so do you.

1361
01:41:56,011 --> 01:41:59,764
Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.

1362
01:41:59,848 --> 01:42:01,766
Adieu.

1363
01:42:03,267 --> 01:42:05,895
Adieu.

1364
01:42:05,978 --> 01:42:08,731
Take thou this vial,
being then in bed,

1365
01:42:08,814 --> 01:42:11,900
and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.

1366
01:42:11,984 --> 01:42:15,945
No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.

1367
01:42:16,029 --> 01:42:18,990
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

1368
01:42:19,073 --> 01:42:22,284
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours,

1369
01:42:22,368 --> 01:42:25,996
and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

1370
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:28,165
What ho! Apothecary!

1371
01:42:31,668 --> 01:42:35,296
Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.

1372
01:42:35,379 --> 01:42:38,299
Hold, there is 40 ducats.

1373
01:42:38,382 --> 01:42:42,135
- Let me have a dram of poison-
- Such mortal drugs I have,

1374
01:42:42,219 --> 01:42:46,264
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.

1375
01:42:46,347 --> 01:42:49,850
- Art thou so-
- My poverty, but not my will, consents.

1376
01:42:55,689 --> 01:42:58,608
I pay thy poverty
and not thy will.

1377
01:43:02,612 --> 01:43:04,780
Eyes, look your last.

1378
01:43:04,864 --> 01:43:07,616
Arms, take your last embrace.

1379
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:10,035
And, lips,

1380
01:43:10,118 --> 01:43:13,580
oh, you,
the doors of breath,

1381
01:43:13,663 --> 01:43:16,082
seal with
a righteous kiss...

1382
01:43:18,042 --> 01:43:20,294
the dateless bargain...

1383
01:43:20,378 --> 01:43:22,630
to engrossing death.

1384
01:43:23,922 --> 01:43:26,758
Come, bitter conduct.

1385
01:43:26,842 --> 01:43:30,136
Come, unsavory guide.

1386
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:33,931
Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...

1387
01:43:34,015 --> 01:43:38,811
run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.

1388
01:43:38,894 --> 01:43:41,313
Here's to my love!

1389
01:43:49,237 --> 01:43:52,406
Oh... true apothecary!

1390
01:43:56,410 --> 01:43:58,662
Thy drugs are quick.

1391
01:44:03,458 --> 01:44:06,043
Thus with a kiss...

1392
01:44:08,754 --> 01:44:10,839
I die.

1393
01:44:28,563 --> 01:44:30,648
Where is my lord?

1394
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:36,529
I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?

1395
01:44:36,612 --> 01:44:37,905
Dead!

1396
01:44:51,292 --> 01:44:53,335
What's this?

1397
01:44:53,419 --> 01:44:57,130
A cup, closed
in my true love's hand?

1398
01:44:57,214 --> 01:44:59,716
Poison, I see,

1399
01:44:59,799 --> 01:45:02,510
hath been
his timeless end.

1400
01:45:08,182 --> 01:45:10,726
Oh, happy dagger,

1401
01:45:10,809 --> 01:45:12,769
this is thy sheath.

1402
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:18,065
There rest...

1403
01:45:19,525 --> 01:45:21,777
and let me die.

1404
01:45:28,658 --> 01:45:32,245
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings;

1405
01:45:32,328 --> 01:45:36,749
the sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

1406
01:45:36,832 --> 01:45:41,837
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

1407
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,172
Some shall be pardoned,

1408
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:47,258
and some punished;

1409
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:51,470
for never was a story
of more woe...

1410
01:45:51,553 --> 01:45:55,182
than this of Juliet...

1411
01:45:55,265 --> 01:45:57,517
and her Romeo.

1412
01:46:24,625 --> 01:46:27,502
Bravo!

1413
01:46:31,214 --> 01:46:33,215
- Yea! Yea!
- Yea!

1414
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:22,301
- Bravo!
- Yea! Bravo!

1415
01:47:36,772 --> 01:47:41,192
- God save the queen!
- I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth!

1416
01:47:41,276 --> 01:47:45,279
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

1417
01:47:45,363 --> 01:47:47,114
Everyone!

1418
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:50,534
Admiral's Men,
the Chamberlain's Men...

1419
01:47:50,618 --> 01:47:54,955
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

1420
01:47:55,038 --> 01:47:58,416
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

1421
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:02,545
Contempt? You closed the Rose.
I have not opened it.

1422
01:48:02,628 --> 01:48:05,130
That woman is a woman!

1423
01:48:05,214 --> 01:48:07,299
What?

1424
01:48:07,382 --> 01:48:10,594
A woman?
You mean that goat?

1425
01:48:10,677 --> 01:48:16,098
I'll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

1426
01:48:16,182 --> 01:48:19,518
Mr. Tilney!

1427
01:48:24,731 --> 01:48:28,484
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

1428
01:48:36,408 --> 01:48:39,119
The queen of England
does not attend...

1429
01:48:39,202 --> 01:48:41,246
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1430
01:48:41,329 --> 01:48:44,332
So something
is out of joint.

1431
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:49,920
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

1432
01:49:04,725 --> 01:49:07,644
Yes, the illusion
is remarkable.

1433
01:49:07,728 --> 01:49:10,438
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

1434
01:49:11,773 --> 01:49:15,776
But I know something of
a woman in a man's profession.

1435
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:18,821
Yes, by God,
I do know about that.

1436
01:49:20,572 --> 01:49:23,492
That is enough from you,
Master Kent.

1437
01:49:28,329 --> 01:49:30,581
If only Lord Wessex
were here.

1438
01:49:30,665 --> 01:49:32,708
He is, ma'am.

1439
01:49:35,627 --> 01:49:38,839
Y- Your Majesty.

1440
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:43,092
There was a wager
I remember...

1441
01:49:43,176 --> 01:49:48,013
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

1442
01:49:48,097 --> 01:49:50,682
I think you lost it today.

1443
01:49:55,353 --> 01:49:59,273
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

1444
01:49:59,357 --> 01:50:02,276
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

1445
01:50:08,949 --> 01:50:11,367
Master Shakespeare.

1446
01:50:13,953 --> 01:50:16,956
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself,

1447
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:20,167
and we will speak
some more.

1448
01:50:37,641 --> 01:50:39,893
Your Majesty.

1449
01:50:41,311 --> 01:50:43,271
Why, Lord Wessex.

1450
01:50:43,354 --> 01:50:45,898
Lost your wife so soon?

1451
01:50:45,982 --> 01:50:48,734
Indeed I am a bride short,

1452
01:50:48,817 --> 01:50:53,113
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

1453
01:50:53,196 --> 01:50:55,782
How is this to end?

1454
01:50:55,865 --> 01:50:58,618
As stories must
when love's denied-

1455
01:50:58,701 --> 01:51:01,329
with tears and a journey.

1456
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:03,831
Those whom God
has joined in marriage...

1457
01:51:03,914 --> 01:51:07,376
not even I
can put asunder.

1458
01:51:07,459 --> 01:51:10,170
Master Kent.

1459
01:51:15,883 --> 01:51:19,887
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1460
01:51:21,847 --> 01:51:25,642
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

1461
01:51:25,725 --> 01:51:28,144
It's time
to settle accounts.

1462
01:51:31,355 --> 01:51:34,358
- How much was that wager?
- Fifty shillings.

1463
01:51:35,692 --> 01:51:38,236
Pounds.

1464
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:42,782
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

1465
01:51:50,372 --> 01:51:54,334
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

1466
01:51:54,417 --> 01:51:57,253
for Twelfth Night.

1467
01:52:13,184 --> 01:52:17,855
Too late.

1468
01:52:26,613 --> 01:52:28,656
My Lady Wessex.

1469
01:52:43,836 --> 01:52:46,881
A hired player
no longer.

1470
01:52:46,964 --> 01:52:49,591
Fifty pounds, Will,

1471
01:52:49,675 --> 01:52:52,177
for the poet of true love.

1472
01:52:53,303 --> 01:52:55,221
I'm done with theater.

1473
01:52:57,015 --> 01:52:59,558
The playhouse
is for dreamers.

1474
01:52:59,642 --> 01:53:02,144
Look what the dream
brought us.

1475
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:05,897
It was we ourselves
did that.

1476
01:53:07,274 --> 01:53:11,527
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

1477
01:53:11,611 --> 01:53:15,781
I have hurt you,
and I'm sorry for it.

1478
01:53:15,865 --> 01:53:19,910
If my hurt is to be
that you write no more,

1479
01:53:19,993 --> 01:53:22,412
then I shall be
the sorrier.

1480
01:53:27,959 --> 01:53:30,544
The queen commands
a comedy, Will,

1481
01:53:30,628 --> 01:53:32,588
for Twelfth Night.

1482
01:53:32,671 --> 01:53:35,757
A comedy.

1483
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:37,842
What would my hero be?

1484
01:53:37,926 --> 01:53:41,387
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

1485
01:53:43,598 --> 01:53:47,101
It's a beginning.

1486
01:53:47,184 --> 01:53:51,271
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine-

1487
01:53:51,354 --> 01:53:54,691
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

1488
01:53:56,526 --> 01:54:00,738
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

1489
01:54:00,821 --> 01:54:03,699
A storm.
All are lost.

1490
01:54:03,782 --> 01:54:07,244
She lands... on a...

1491
01:54:07,327 --> 01:54:10,330
vast and empty shore.

1492
01:54:11,789 --> 01:54:13,833
She's brought to the duke-

1493
01:54:15,251 --> 01:54:18,295
- Orsino.
- Orsino?

1494
01:54:19,421 --> 01:54:21,339
Good name.

1495
01:54:21,423 --> 01:54:25,760
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1496
01:54:25,843 --> 01:54:29,722
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

1497
01:54:31,932 --> 01:54:34,142
But all ends well.

1498
01:54:34,226 --> 01:54:36,436
How does it?

1499
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,646
I don't know.

1500
01:54:40,231 --> 01:54:43,025
It's a mystery.

1501
01:54:49,239 --> 01:54:51,908
You will never age for me,

1502
01:54:51,992 --> 01:54:53,910
nor fade,

1503
01:54:53,993 --> 01:54:56,245
nor die.

1504
01:54:56,329 --> 01:54:58,831
Nor you for me.

1505
01:55:00,166 --> 01:55:02,459
Good-bye, my love.

1506
01:55:04,211 --> 01:55:06,588
A thousand times good-bye.

1507
01:55:11,092 --> 01:55:13,010
Write me well.

1508
01:55:45,748 --> 01:55:49,376
My story starts at sea,

1509
01:55:49,459 --> 01:55:52,712
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

1510
01:55:54,088 --> 01:55:57,175
A shipwreck.

1511
01:55:59,051 --> 01:56:02,846
The wild waters roar and heave.

1512
01:56:04,056 --> 01:56:07,309
The brave vessel
is dashed all to pieces,

1513
01:56:10,061 --> 01:56:13,939
and all the helpless souls
within her...

1514
01:56:14,023 --> 01:56:16,317
drowned.

1515
01:56:18,986 --> 01:56:22,280
All save one:

1516
01:56:22,364 --> 01:56:24,532
a lady...

1517
01:56:25,908 --> 01:56:30,162
whose soul is greater
than the ocean,

1518
01:56:30,246 --> 01:56:34,499
and her spirit,
stronger than the sea's embrace.

1519
01:56:36,835 --> 01:56:39,963
Not for her a watery end,

1520
01:56:41,506 --> 01:56:45,593
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

1521
01:56:49,721 --> 01:56:52,265
It will be a love story,

1522
01:56:56,394 --> 01:57:00,564
for she will be my heroine
for all time.

1523
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:06,945
And her name will be Viola.
