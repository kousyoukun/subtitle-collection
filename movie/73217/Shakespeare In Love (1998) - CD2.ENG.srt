1
00:00:00,396 --> 00:00:03,274
Huh? Who's there?

2
00:00:03,357 --> 00:00:06,027
Marlowe.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,614
You are playing
my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

4
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:11,907
Don't spend yourself
in sport.

5
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:15,578
- What do you want, Kit?
- My Massacre at Paris is complete.

6
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:18,956
- What? You have the last act?
- If you have the money.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,127
-Tomorrow.
-Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,504
Oh, will you desist, madam!

9
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:28,507
- Oh!
- Twenty pounds on delivery.

10
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:31,886
Now, what is money to men like us?

11
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:37,725
Besides, if I need a play,
I have another waiting--
a comedy by Shakespeare.

12
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:39,685
Oh, Romeo.

13
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:43,022
- Gave it to Henslowe.
- Never!

14
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:46,108
Well, I'm to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,278
I gave Shakespeare
two sovereigns for Romeo.

16
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:53,783
You did, but Ned Alleyn
and the Admiral's Men have
the playing of it at the Rose.

17
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,826
Treachery!

18
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:59,413
Traitor and thief!

19
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,585
Oh, no.

20
00:01:04,627 --> 00:01:06,671
No!

21
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:26,524
By my head,
here comes the Capulets.

22
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:29,527
By my heel,
I care not.

23
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:32,905
Follow me close.
I will speak with them.

24
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:36,033
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

25
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:38,369
Are you going
to do it like that?

26
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:40,663
Positions.

27
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:45,042
- By my head, here comes the Capulets.
- By my heel, I care not.

28
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:47,378
Follow me close.
I will speak to them.

29
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,381
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

30
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:53,884
And but one word with one of us?

31
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:56,762
Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.

32
00:01:56,804 --> 00:02:00,558
Where's that thieving hack that
can't keep his pen in his own ink pot?

33
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:02,768
What is this rabble?

34
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:07,898
Draw, if you be a man!

35
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:33,299
Wonderful.
Wonderful!

36
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:37,637
And a dog.

37
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,140
No!

38
00:02:41,223 --> 00:02:44,477
Have privy, players! Please!

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,438
Oh! Not with my props!

40
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:48,940
Oh!

41
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:51,943
- Will! What--
- A writer's quarrel.

42
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:54,445
Quite normal.

43
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,949
Stay here.

44
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:12,296
You are hurt.

45
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:28,688
I dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

46
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,732
- You were cast ashore in a far country.
- Oh, not yet.

47
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:33,734
Not yet.

48
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:36,779
'Ey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

49
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:39,198
My investment!
Lambert!

50
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,868
Vengeance!

51
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:12,398
A famous victory!

52
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:16,569
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house!

53
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:19,196
Oh, what happy hour.

54
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,533
- This is a tavern!
- It is also a tavern.

55
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:25,244
- I remember you. The poet!
- Yes, William the Conqueror.

56
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,082
One at a time. One at a time.

57
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:34,045
Oh, he's a pretty one. Tell me
your story while I tickle your fancy.

58
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:41,927
- It's a house of ill repute.
- It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

59
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,889
Come.
There's no harm in a drink.

60
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:49,769
You are welcome to my best house.
Here's to the Admiral's Men.

61
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:51,562
- The Admiral's Men!
- The Admiral's Men!

62
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:53,564
The Admiral's Men!

63
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:19,966
Well, l--
I quite liked it.

64
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:22,468
Master Kent,

65
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:25,388
you have not yet
dipped your wick.

66
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:29,892
My "wick"?

67
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:33,771
Mr. Fennyman,
because you love the theater,
you must have a part in my play.

68
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:38,818
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

69
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:41,988
My heavens.
I thank you.

70
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:44,365
What's the play about, then?

71
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,617
Well, there's this nurse--

72
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,834
Silence, silence, silence!

73
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,295
Master Shakespeare...

74
00:05:57,378 --> 00:06:01,674
has asked me to play
the part of the apothecary.

75
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:06,470
The apothecary?

76
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:09,598
What is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

77
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:11,851
How does the comedy end?

78
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:16,147
- By God, I wish I knew.
- By God, if you do not, who does?

79
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,859
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending,

80
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:23,195
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

81
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:43,049
Will! Mr. Henslowe!
Gentlemen all!

82
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:46,927
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

83
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:49,430
Marlowe is dead.

84
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:55,686
Stabbed.

85
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,149
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

86
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:05,029
What have I done?

87
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:07,949
He was the first man among us.

88
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,701
A great light has gone out.

89
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,511
Forgive me.

90
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:33,808
God forgive me.

91
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:03,546
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake.

92
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:06,048
One morning
in the month of May

93
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:09,176
From my cot I stray

94
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,929
Just at the dawning
of the day

95
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:14,598
I met with
a charming mai--

96
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:20,271
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

97
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:23,774
- It's not my riding day, my lord.
- Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

98
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:26,485
I'm going to church.

99
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:30,281
Of course. I understand.
It is to be expected.

100
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:33,784
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

101
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:37,163
And on a day of mourning.

102
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:40,374
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

103
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,460
Mourning?

104
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,964
Who is dead, my lord?

105
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:51,969
Oh! Dear God, I did not think
it would be me to tell you.

106
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:56,682
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

107
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:59,727
My lady.

108
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,481
- He is dead?
- Killed last night in a tavern.

109
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,860
Come then.
We'll say a prayer for his soul.

110
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:21,123
Who can remember sorrow

111
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:54,615
Spare me, dear ghost.

112
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:57,451
Spare me, dear ghost.

113
00:09:57,535 --> 00:10:00,371
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me!

114
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:15,553
Will!

115
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,889
Oh, my love.

116
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:20,891
I thought you were dead.

117
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:28,899
It is worse.

118
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,235
I've killed a man.

119
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:38,242
Marlowe's touch
was in my Titus Andronicus,

120
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:41,996
and my Henry VI was a house built
on his foundations.

121
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:45,708
You never spoke
so well of him.

122
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,919
He was not dead before.

123
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:53,758
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

124
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:57,261
You lie.

125
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:03,100
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

126
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,645
My love is no lie.

127
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:09,357
I have a wife, yes,

128
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,693
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

129
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:16,489
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that,

130
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:20,952
and yet, you let me
come to your bed.

131
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:24,288
Calf-love.

132
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:28,793
I loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

133
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:31,629
I was the more deceived.

134
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:34,632
Yes, you were deceived,

135
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:38,094
for I did not know
how much I loved you.

136
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:43,808
I love you, Will,

137
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:45,977
beyond poetry.

138
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,562
Oh, my love.

139
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:52,692
- You ran from me before.
- When I thought you dead,
I did not care...

140
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:55,069
about all the plays
that would never come,

141
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:57,863
only that I would
never see your face.

142
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:01,242
I saw our end,
and it will come.

143
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:05,830
- You cannot marry Wessex.
- If not you, why not Wessex?

144
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:08,499
If not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause,

145
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:13,254
- and there will be
no more Will Shakespeare.
- No. No.

146
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:17,842
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows,

147
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:20,845
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

148
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,683
For killing Juliet's
kinsman Tybalt,

149
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:28,686
the one who killed
Romeo's friend Mercutio,

150
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,730
Romeo is banished.

151
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:33,399
- But the friar who married
Romeo and Juliet--
- Is that me?

152
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:38,362
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

153
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:42,199
It is a secret potion.
It makes us seeming dead.

154
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:45,244
She is placed in the tomb
of the Capulets.

155
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:48,080
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

156
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:54,337
I have not said all.

157
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,592
By maligned fate, the message
goes astray which would tell
Romeo of the friar's plan.

158
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:03,054
He hears only
that Juliet is dead.

159
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:06,140
And thus he goes
to the apothecary...

160
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:08,142
That's me.

161
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:10,478
and buys a deadly poison.

162
00:13:10,561 --> 00:13:15,483
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet who lies there cold as death.

163
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,902
He drinks the poison.

164
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,614
He dies by her side,

165
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,661
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

166
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:29,872
And so Juliet
takes his dagger...

167
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:34,835
and then kills herself.

168
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,050
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

169
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:44,011
Sad... and wonderful.

170
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,015
I have a blue velvet cap
that'll do well.

171
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:50,851
I've seen just such a cap
on an apothecary.

172
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:52,937
Just so.

173
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,275
Yes, it will serve.

174
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:01,487
But there's a scene missing.

175
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,448
Between marriage
and death?

176
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:14,959
The play...
all written out for you.

177
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:19,130
I had the clerk
at Bridewell do it.

178
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:21,632
He has a good fist
for lettering.

179
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,720
There is a new scene.

180
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:36,897
- Will you read in for me?
- "Wilt thou be gone?
It's not yet near day.

181
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:39,734
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

182
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:42,403
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear.

183
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:45,573
Nightly she sings
on yon pomegranate tree.

184
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:48,492
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale."

185
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:52,622
"lt was the lark,
the herald of the morn;

186
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:55,041
no nightingale.

187
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:58,044
Look, love,
what envious streaks...

188
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:02,256
do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.

189
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,177
Night's candles
are burnt out,

190
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,679
and jocund day
stands tiptoe...

191
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:12,141
on the misty mountaintops.

192
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:16,687
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die."

193
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,485
"Yon light is not daylight;
I know it, l.

194
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:25,529
It is some meteor
that the sun exhales...

195
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:30,284
to be to thee this night
a torchbearer...

196
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:33,579
to light thee
on thy way to Mantua.

197
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:37,500
Therefore, stay yet.

198
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,128
Thou needst not
to be gone."

199
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:43,464
"Let me be ta'en,

200
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:46,634
Iet me be put to death;

201
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:51,055
I am content,
so thou wilt have it so.

202
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:53,724
I have more care
to stay...

203
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:56,185
than will to go.

204
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,646
Come, death, and welcome.

205
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:01,732
Juliet wills it so."

206
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:27,758
You will go far, I fear.

207
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:34,265
I hope we work
together again.

208
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:39,937
"Such mortal drugs I have,
but Mantua's law...

209
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:44,317
is death, death to
any he that utters them."

210
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,027
Then him. Then me.

211
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,614
"Put-- Put this...

212
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:52,074
- in any liquid thing you will and--"
- Hah!

213
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:56,370
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

214
00:16:56,454 --> 00:17:00,458
How silver sweet sound
lovers' tongues by night.

215
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,460
- Like soft music--
- Shakespeare!

216
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:21,854
Upstart inky pup!

217
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,858
I'll show you your place,
which is in hell!

218
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,658
- You're on my ground now!
- By God, I'll fight the lot of you!

219
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:35,660
I am more than enough!

220
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,503
Move!

221
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:09,086
Absent friends.

222
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:13,466
This is the murderer
of Kit Marlowe!

223
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:16,761
Will?

224
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:20,097
I rejoiced in his death
because I thought it was yours!
That is all I know of Marlowe!

225
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:23,768
Will? Uh, it's true.

226
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:26,646
It was a... tavern brawl.

227
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:31,692
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

228
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:33,986
A quarrel about the bill.

229
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,323
The bill?
Oh, vanity, vanity!

230
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:39,784
Not the billing,
the bill!

231
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,790
Oh, God.

232
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:48,376
- I am free of it.
- Where is she?

233
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,462
Close it.

234
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:56,008
- My Lord Wessex.
- The Rose harbors the ass
that shits on my name!

235
00:19:56,092 --> 00:19:58,302
Take it down
stone by stone.

236
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:02,098
I want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

237
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:04,058
Mr. Tilney,
what is this?

238
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:06,560
Sedition and indecency.

239
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:09,355
Master of the Revels, sir.
She's over here.

240
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:12,066
- Where, boy?
- There.

241
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:14,318
I saw her bubbies.

242
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:18,781
So, a woman on the stage!

243
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:22,994
A woman!
I say this theater is closed!

244
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:24,537
Why, sir?

245
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,749
For lewdness
and unshamedfacedness!

246
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:33,713
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

247
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,855
Not him, her!

248
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,860
That's who I meant.

249
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:02,033
- He's a woman.
- This theater is closed.

250
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:07,371
Notice will be posted!

251
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,416
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

252
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:13,377
- Nobody knew.
- He did.

253
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:16,464
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

254
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:22,053
It is over.

255
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:24,889
I'm sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

256
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,239
I wanted to be an actor.

257
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:44,784
I'm so sorry, Will.

258
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,918
You were... w-w--

259
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,421
w-wonderful.

260
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,258
Thank you.

261
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,105
"Let me put this in any
liquid thing you will and--"

262
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:23,114
Everything all right?

263
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:03,779
I would've been good.

264
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:06,949
- I would've been great.
- So would l.

265
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,452
We both would.

266
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:34,185
Lambert, kill him.

267
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,772
That can wait.

268
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:46,656
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

269
00:23:48,282 --> 00:23:50,409
But my father,
James Burbage,

270
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:54,956
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty,

271
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,752
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

272
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:03,339
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

273
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:05,424
Will Shakespeare has a play.

274
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:11,389
I have a theater.
The curtain is yours.

275
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:48,217
Will!
We'll be needing a Romeo.

276
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:57,143
Oranges!
Sweet oranges!

277
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,133
My ship is moored at bankside, bound for
Virginia on the afternoon tide.

278
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:31,302
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.

279
00:25:31,385 --> 00:25:33,304
You are gaining a colony.

280
00:25:33,387 --> 00:25:36,223
And you, my lord,
are gaining 5,000 pounds...

281
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:38,809
by these drafts in my hand.

282
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:41,646
Would you oblige me
with 50 or so in gold...

283
00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:44,815
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside?

284
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:48,986
Ah, the bride!

285
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:53,157
Good morning, my lord.

286
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,203
I see you are... open for business,
so let's to church.

287
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,335
Be gone!

288
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:06,545
Hup, hup, hup!

289
00:27:02,727 --> 00:27:04,645
Oh, my lord!

290
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:07,315
- Be good to her, my lord.
- I will.

291
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:09,483
Oh, God bless you!

292
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,403
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There's a good nurse.

293
00:27:12,486 --> 00:27:14,447
The tide will not wait!

294
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:18,409
Farewell!
You'll all be welcome in Virginia!

295
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:47,605
Candy apples!

296
00:27:47,688 --> 00:27:49,607
Candy apples!

297
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,235
Buy my apples!

298
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,951
Thank you, sir.
Apples!

299
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:10,836
Is this, uh--
Is this all right?

300
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,838
Yeah.

301
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:32,483
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

302
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:37,113
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show!

303
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:42,159
This is the very business
of show!

304
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:55,840
T-T-- T-Two--

305
00:28:55,923 --> 00:28:58,551
T-T-T-T-- T-- T--

306
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:02,305
T-- T-T-Two households--

307
00:29:02,388 --> 00:29:05,349
- We're lost.
- No, it will turn out well.

308
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:08,894
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

309
00:29:11,397 --> 00:29:14,942
T-T-- T-- T-T--

310
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:17,361
T-- T--

311
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:11,207
Two households,

312
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,418
both alike in dignity,

313
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:17,254
in fair Verona,

314
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:19,924
where we lay our scene.

315
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:23,052
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny,

316
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:26,514
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

317
00:30:26,597 --> 00:30:29,600
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

318
00:30:29,684 --> 00:30:32,812
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

319
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:35,648
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

320
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:39,193
doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

321
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:45,449
...the which of you
with patient ears attend,

322
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:50,288
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

323
00:30:56,627 --> 00:30:58,629
- Wonderful.
- Was it...

324
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:01,799
good?

325
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:07,722
Gregory, on my word
we'll not carry coals.

326
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:10,850
No, for then
we should be colliers.

327
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:13,436
I mean, and we be
in choler we'll draw.

328
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,606
- Master Shakespeare.
- Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

329
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:19,150
It's not my fault.
I could do it yesterday.

330
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:22,403
Do me a speech.
Do me a line.

331
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:26,324
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

332
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:29,660
- Another little problem.
- What do we do now?

333
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:33,664
- The show must-- You know.
- Go on!

334
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:37,168
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

335
00:31:37,251 --> 00:31:39,670
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

336
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:42,048
- Fear me not.
- No, marry, I fear thee!

337
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:47,345
- Let them begin.
- I will frown as I pass by.

338
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:51,223
- Let them take it as they list!
- Nay, as they dare.

339
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:55,353
I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.

340
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:58,356
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

341
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:01,734
- I do bite my thumb, sir.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

342
00:32:01,817 --> 00:32:05,446
- Thank you. Excuse me.
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

343
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,448
- Can we talk?
- Shh!

344
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:10,368
- We have no Juliet.
- No Juliet?

345
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:13,579
- No Juliet?
- It'll be all right, madam.

346
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:16,749
- What happened to Sam?
- Who are you?
- Thomas Kent.

347
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:19,418
Do you know it?

348
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:22,630
- I serve as good a man as you.
- Every word.

349
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:29,095
Hyah! Yah!

350
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,893
I'll go along,
no such sight to be shown,

351
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:39,105
but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.

352
00:32:39,188 --> 00:32:41,482
Nurse!

353
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,113
Where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

354
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:50,408
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

355
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:52,410
I bade her come.

356
00:32:52,493 --> 00:32:54,578
How now, who calls?

357
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:57,415
What, ladybird!

358
00:32:57,498 --> 00:32:59,250
God forbid!
Where's this girl?

359
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,961
What, lamb!

360
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:04,255
What, ladybird!

361
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:07,758
What, Juliet!

362
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:12,263
How now, who calls?

363
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:19,812
- We'll all be put in the Clink.
- See you in jail.

364
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,110
Your mother--
Your mother.

365
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:29,488
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

366
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:31,616
This is the matter.

367
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:34,118
Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.

368
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:38,956
Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.

369
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,376
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

370
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,963
- Faith, I know her age unto an hour.
- She's not 14.

371
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:51,552
Oh, I'll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken,

372
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:54,388
I have but four--

373
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:18,621
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

374
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:23,292
how stands your dispositions
to be married?

375
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:26,504
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

376
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,678
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

377
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:44,647
I-- I'm sped.

378
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,525
Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.

379
00:34:47,608 --> 00:34:49,986
Ask for me tomorrow,

380
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:52,905
you shall find me
a grave man.

381
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:03,374
Yes!

382
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:10,548
Yah!

383
00:35:10,631 --> 00:35:13,175
"Such mortal drugs I have,

384
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:17,930
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them."

385
00:35:18,014 --> 00:35:20,558
Then him. Then me.

386
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:31,110
Romeo, away, be gone!

387
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:35,615
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed!

388
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:39,952
The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

389
00:35:41,162 --> 00:35:43,497
Oh, I am Fortune's fool!

390
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:45,499
Why dost thou stay?

391
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,585
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?

392
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:49,879
That murderer,
which way ran he?

393
00:35:49,962 --> 00:35:52,757
- There lies that Tybalt.
- Up, sir. Go with me.

394
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,884
I charge thee
in the Prince's name obey.

395
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:57,678
Where are the vile beginners
of this fray?

396
00:35:57,762 --> 00:36:00,014
"Oh, I am Fortune's fool."

397
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:04,769
You are married?

398
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:13,444
"lf you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed."

399
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,420
Art thou gone so,

400
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:36,175
Iove, lord,

401
00:36:36,258 --> 00:36:38,469
aye, husband, friend?

402
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:43,307
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

403
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:46,310
for in a minute
there are many days.

404
00:36:46,394 --> 00:36:49,981
Oh, by this count
I shall be much in years ere again...

405
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:52,483
I behold my Romeo.

406
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:54,485
Farewell.

407
00:36:55,987 --> 00:36:58,906
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

408
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,995
Methinks I see thee,
now thou art so low,

409
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:07,540
as one dead
in the bottom of a tomb.

410
00:37:07,623 --> 00:37:11,002
Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look'st pale.

411
00:37:13,254 --> 00:37:15,464
Then trust me, love,

412
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:17,883
in my eyes, so do you.

413
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:21,721
Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.

414
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:23,723
Adieu.

415
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:27,852
Adieu.

416
00:37:27,935 --> 00:37:30,688
Take thou this vial,
being then in bed,

417
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:33,858
and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.

418
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:37,903
No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.

419
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:40,948
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

420
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:44,243
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours,

421
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:47,955
and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

422
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:50,124
What ho! Apothecary!

423
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:57,256
Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.

424
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,259
Hold, there is 40 ducats.

425
00:38:00,343 --> 00:38:04,096
- Let me have a dram of poison--
- Such mortal drugs I have,

426
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,225
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.

427
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:11,812
- Art thou so--
- My poverty, but not my will, consents.

428
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:20,571
I pay thy poverty
and not thy will.

429
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:26,744
Eyes, look your last.

430
00:38:26,827 --> 00:38:29,580
Arms, take your last embrace.

431
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:31,999
And, lips,

432
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:35,544
oh, you,
the doors of breath,

433
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:38,047
seal with
a righteous kiss...

434
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:42,259
the dateless bargain...

435
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:44,595
to engrossing death.

436
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:48,724
Come, bitter conduct.

437
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:52,103
Come, unsavory guide.

438
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:55,898
Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...

439
00:38:55,982 --> 00:39:00,778
run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.

440
00:39:00,861 --> 00:39:03,281
Here's to my love!

441
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:14,375
Oh... true apothecary!

442
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:20,631
Thy drugs are quick.

443
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:28,014
Thus with a kiss...

444
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:32,810
I die.

445
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:52,622
Where is my lord?

446
00:39:54,373 --> 00:39:58,502
I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?

447
00:39:58,586 --> 00:39:59,879
Dead!

448
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:15,311
What's this?

449
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:19,106
A cup, closed
in my true love's hand?

450
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,692
Poison, I see,

451
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:24,487
hath been
his timeless end.

452
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,703
Oh, happy dagger,

453
00:40:32,787 --> 00:40:34,747
this is thy sheath.

454
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:40,044
There rest...

455
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:43,756
and let me die.

456
00:40:50,638 --> 00:40:54,225
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings;

457
00:40:54,308 --> 00:40:58,729
the sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

458
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:03,818
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

459
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:06,153
Some shall be pardoned,

460
00:41:06,237 --> 00:41:09,240
and some punished;

461
00:41:09,323 --> 00:41:13,452
for never was a story
of more woe...

462
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:17,164
than this of Juliet...

463
00:41:17,248 --> 00:41:19,500
and her Romeo.

464
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:49,488
Bravo!

465
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,202
- Yea! Yea!
- Yea!

466
00:42:41,582 --> 00:42:44,293
- Bravo!
- Yea! Bravo!

467
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:03,187
- God save the queen!
- I arrest you in the name
of Queen Elizabeth!

468
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:07,275
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

469
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:09,110
Everyone!

470
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:12,530
Admiral's Men,
the Chamberlain's Men...

471
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:16,951
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

472
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:20,413
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

473
00:43:20,496 --> 00:43:24,542
Contempt? You closed the Rose.
I have not opened it.

474
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:27,128
That woman is a woman!

475
00:43:27,211 --> 00:43:29,297
What?

476
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,591
A woman?
You mean that goat?

477
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:38,097
I'll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

478
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,517
Mr. Tilney!

479
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:50,484
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

480
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:01,120
The queen of England
does not attend...

481
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:03,247
exhibitions of public lewdness.

482
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:06,334
So something
is out of joint.

483
00:44:08,252 --> 00:44:11,922
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

484
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:29,649
Yes, the illusion
is remarkable.

485
00:44:29,732 --> 00:44:32,443
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

486
00:44:33,778 --> 00:44:37,782
But I know something of
a woman in a man's profession.

487
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:40,826
Yes, by God,
I do know about that.

488
00:44:42,578 --> 00:44:45,498
That is enough from you,
Master Kent.

489
00:44:50,336 --> 00:44:52,588
If only Lord Wessex
were here.

490
00:44:52,672 --> 00:44:54,715
He is, ma'am.

491
00:44:57,635 --> 00:45:00,846
Y-Your Majesty.

492
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:05,101
There was a wager
I remember...

493
00:45:05,184 --> 00:45:10,022
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

494
00:45:10,106 --> 00:45:12,692
I think you lost it today.

495
00:45:17,363 --> 00:45:21,284
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

496
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:24,287
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

497
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,379
Master Shakespeare.

498
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:38,968
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself,

499
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:42,179
and we will speak
some more.

500
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:01,907
Your Majesty.

501
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:05,286
Why, Lord Wessex.

502
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:07,913
Lost your wife so soon?

503
00:46:07,997 --> 00:46:10,750
Indeed I am a bride short,

504
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:15,129
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

505
00:46:15,212 --> 00:46:17,798
How is this to end?

506
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:20,635
As stories must
when love's denied--

507
00:46:20,718 --> 00:46:23,346
with tears and a journey.

508
00:46:23,387 --> 00:46:25,848
Those whom God
has joined in marriage...

509
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:29,393
not even I
can put asunder.

510
00:46:29,477 --> 00:46:32,188
Master Kent.

511
00:46:37,902 --> 00:46:41,906
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

512
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:47,662
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

513
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:50,164
It's time
to settle accounts.

514
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:56,379
- How much was that wager?
- Fifty shillings.

515
00:46:57,713 --> 00:47:00,257
Pounds.

516
00:47:00,341 --> 00:47:04,804
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

517
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:16,357
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

518
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,277
for Twelfth Night.

519
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:37,086
Too late.

520
00:47:37,169 --> 00:47:39,880
Too late.

521
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:50,683
My Lady Wessex.

522
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:08,909
A hired player
no longer.

523
00:48:08,993 --> 00:48:11,621
Fifty pounds, Will,

524
00:48:11,704 --> 00:48:14,206
for the poet of true love.

525
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:17,251
I'm done with theater.

526
00:48:19,045 --> 00:48:21,589
The playhouse
is for dreamers.

527
00:48:21,672 --> 00:48:24,175
Look what the dream
brought us.

528
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:27,928
It was we ourselves
did that.

529
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:33,559
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

530
00:48:33,643 --> 00:48:37,813
I have hurt you,
and I'm sorry for it.

531
00:48:37,897 --> 00:48:41,943
If my hurt is to be
that you write no more,

532
00:48:42,026 --> 00:48:44,445
then I shall be
the sorrier.

533
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:52,578
The queen commands
a comedy, Will,

534
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:54,622
for Twelfth Night.

535
00:48:54,705 --> 00:48:57,792
A comedy.

536
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,877
What would my hero be?

537
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:03,422
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

538
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:09,136
It's a beginning.

539
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,307
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine--

540
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:16,727
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

541
00:49:18,562 --> 00:49:22,775
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

542
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:25,736
A storm.
All are lost.

543
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:29,282
She lands... on a...

544
00:49:29,365 --> 00:49:32,368
vast and empty shore.

545
00:49:33,828 --> 00:49:35,871
She's brought to the duke--

546
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:40,334
- Orsino.
- Orsino?

547
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,379
Good name.

548
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:47,800
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

549
00:49:47,883 --> 00:49:51,762
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

550
00:49:53,973 --> 00:49:56,183
But all ends well.

551
00:49:56,267 --> 00:49:58,477
How does it?

552
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:00,688
I don't know.

553
00:50:02,273 --> 00:50:05,067
It's a mystery.

554
00:50:11,282 --> 00:50:13,951
You will never age for me,

555
00:50:14,035 --> 00:50:15,953
nor fade,

556
00:50:16,037 --> 00:50:18,289
nor die.

557
00:50:18,372 --> 00:50:20,875
Nor you for me.

558
00:50:22,209 --> 00:50:24,503
Good-bye, my love.

559
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:28,633
A thousand times good-bye.

560
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:35,056
Write me well.

561
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:11,425
My story starts at sea,

562
00:51:11,509 --> 00:51:14,762
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

563
00:51:16,138 --> 00:51:19,225
A shipwreck.

564
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:24,897
The wild waters roar and heave.

565
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:29,360
The brave vessel
is dashed all to pieces,

566
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:35,992
and all the helpless souls
within her...

567
00:51:36,075 --> 00:51:38,369
drowned.

568
00:51:41,038 --> 00:51:44,333
All save one:

569
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:46,585
a lady...

570
00:51:47,962 --> 00:51:52,216
whose soul is greater
than the ocean,

571
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,554
and her spirit,
stronger than the sea's embrace.

572
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:02,018
Not for her a watery end,

573
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:07,648
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

574
00:52:11,777 --> 00:52:14,322
It will be a love story,

575
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:22,622
for she will be my heroine
for all time.

576
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:29,003
And her name will be Viola.
