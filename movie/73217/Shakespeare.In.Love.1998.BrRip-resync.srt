1
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:59,588
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn't pay his debts?

2
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,549
His boots catch fire!

3
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:06,011
Why do you howl...

4
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:08,722
when it is I who am bitten?

5
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:11,725
-What am I, Mr. Lambert?
-Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

6
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:13,600
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,814
12 pounds, 1 schilling and 4 pence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

8
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:18,732
-Aaah! I can pay you!
-When?

9
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:21,985
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
Oh, for pity’s sake!

10
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,238
Take them out.

11
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:26,240
Where will you find...

12
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,283
16 pounds, 5 schillings and 9 pence...

13
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,327
Including interest, in 3 weeks?

14
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:33,080
-I have a wonderful new play.
-Put them back in.

15
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,123
-It's a comedy!
-Cut off his nose.

16
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:38,043
It's a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

17
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:41,755
-And his ears.
-And a share!

18
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:44,007
We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!

19
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:47,302
Partners?

20
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,600
It's a crowd-tickler.

21
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:56,979
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

22
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,190
-A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
-I think I've seen it.

23
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,942
I didn't like it.

24
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:05,737
-But this time it is by Shakespeare.
-What's it called?

25
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,615
"Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter".

26
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,784
Good title.

27
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:14,288
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

28
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:16,665
Let's say we open in 2 weeks.

29
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,293
That's, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

30
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:22,963
In addition, 400 backsides at
three pence, a penny extra for cushions.

31
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:24,965
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

32
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:28,886
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees?

33
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:32,014
-20 pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
-Correct.

34
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:35,225
-But I have to pay the actors and the author.
-Share of the profits.

35
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,728
-There's never any...
-Of course not.

36
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:42,274
Mr. Fennyman, I think you
might have hit upon something.

37
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:44,193
Sign there.

38
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:52,159
So, "Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter".

39
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:54,161
Almost finished?

40
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,748
Without doubt he's completing
it at this very moment.

41
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:39,039
<b><u>Subtitles by ADONI@</u></b>

42
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,892
Will. Will!

43
00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:01,478
Where is my play?

44
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:04,815
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

45
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:08,277
<i>Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.</i>

46
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:11,071
No, no, we haven't the time.
Talk prose.

47
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:13,031
Where is my play?

48
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:15,742
-It is all locked safe in here.
-God be praised.

49
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:17,619
Locked?

50
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:21,123
-As soon as I find my muse.
-Who is she this time?

51
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:23,041
She is always Aphrodite.

52
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,961
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet?

53
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:29,047
Henslowe, you have no soul...

54
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:32,885
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

55
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:34,803
Ow! Will!

56
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:37,806
I am a dead man and buggered to boot.

57
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,392
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

58
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:43,395
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

59
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:46,398
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain’s
Men are invited to court...

60
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:49,401
and receive 10 pounds
to play your piece...

61
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:52,404
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

62
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:54,406
when you were green and grateful.

63
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:57,409
-What piece? "Richard Crookback"?
-No! It's comedy they want.

64
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,328
Like "Romeo and Ethel".

65
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:02,414
-Who wrote that?
-Nobody. You were writing it for me.

66
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:05,417
-I gave you 3 pound a month since.
-Half what you owe me.

67
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,836
I'm still due for
"One Gentleman of Verona".

68
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:11,340
What is money to you and me?
I, your patron, you, my word Wright.

69
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,258
When the plague lifts...

70
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:16,345
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the "Curtain".

71
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:18,347
-I will have nothing for the "Rose".
-Mr. Henslowe.

72
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:21,016
-Will you lend me 50 pounds?
-50 pounds? What for?

73
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:23,352
Burbage offers me a partnership
in the Chamberlain's Men.

74
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:27,314
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

75
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:30,234
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

76
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,236
No, then?

77
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,280
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

78
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:39,993
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

79
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:44,581
And the "Rose" smells
thusly rank by any name!

80
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:49,294
I say, a plague on both their houses!

81
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:51,296
Where are you going?

82
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,465
My weekly confession.

83
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:01,557
Words, words, words.

84
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,059
Once, I had the gift.

85
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:08,147
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

86
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,149
Love that overthrows empires.

87
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:13,652
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

88
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:17,573
For sixpence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

89
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:21,076
-But now...
-And yet you tell me you lie with women.

90
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:25,497
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe...

91
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:29,710
Rosaline, Borage's seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind...

92
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,504
Yes, now and again.
What of it?

93
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:34,256
I have lost my gift.

94
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:36,717
I am here to help you.

95
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:39,219
Tell me, in your own words.

96
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:46,810
It's as if my quill is broken...

97
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:50,814
as if the organ of my imagination
has dried up...

98
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,568
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

99
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:56,153
Interesting.

100
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:58,363
-Nothing comes.
-Most interesting.

101
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:02,868
It's like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

102
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:08,332
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

103
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,085
How long has it been?

104
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:16,340
A goodly length in times past,
but lately...

105
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,760
No, no.
You have a wife, children?

106
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:24,598
Aye.

107
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:30,229
I was a lad of 18. Anne Hathaway
was a woman half as old again.

108
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:33,273
-A woman of property?
-She had a cottage.

109
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:36,735
One day she was 3 months
gone with child, so...

110
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:38,153
And your relations?

111
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:41,949
-On my mother's side, the Ardens.
-No, your marriage bed.

112
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:45,536
4 years and a 100 miles away
in Stratford.

113
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:49,414
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

114
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,416
Banishment was a blessing.

115
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,672
-So, now you are free to love...
-Yet cannot love, nor write it.

116
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:01,635
Here is a... a bangle...

117
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:05,222
found in Psyche's temple
on Olympus.

118
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:07,599
Cheap at 4 pence.

119
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:12,604
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

120
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:14,690
Will it restore my gift?

121
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,193
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

122
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:21,405
Words will flow like a river.

123
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:23,574
See you next week.

124
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:28,036
-Now where?
-To the palace at Whitehall.

125
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,415
All right.

126
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:34,918
Hello, Will.

127
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:38,046
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

128
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,009
-You too, good Crab.
-Crab's nervous. He's never played the palace.

129
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:44,511
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will?

130
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:47,931
-I could do it.
-No, they'd laugh at Seneca if you played it.

131
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:51,268
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

132
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:54,438
-How goes it, Will?
-I'm still owed money for this play...

133
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,648
-Burbage.
-Not by me. I only stole it.

134
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:59,276
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

135
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:01,695
Where were my seamstress' eyes?

136
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:04,531
When are you coming over
to the Chamberlain's Men?

137
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:05,741
When I have ?0.

138
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:09,244
-You writing?
-A comedy. All but done.

139
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,121
A pirate comedy.

140
00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:12,915
-Wonderful.
-Bring it tomorrow.

141
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:15,334
-It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
-How much?

142
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,710
-Ten pounds.
-You're a liar.

143
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:20,589
He wants Romeo for Ned
and the Admiral's Men.

144
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,382
Mmm. Ned's wrong for it.

145
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:24,843
Will?

146
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:28,180
Here's 2 sovereigns. I'll give
you another 2 when I see the pages.

147
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:30,265
-Done.
-Burbage, I will see you hanged...

148
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:32,392
-for a pickpocket.
-The queen has commanded it.

149
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:35,979
She loves a comedy. And
the Master of the Revels favours us.

150
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:39,024
And what favour does Mr. Tilney
receive from you?

151
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:40,984
-Ask him.
-She comes!

152
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:09,847
<i>Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.</i>

153
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:12,141
<i>Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,</i>

154
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:16,145
<i>were it not affection
chains thy tender days...</i>

155
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:20,482
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

156
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:24,027
-I've lost my gift.
-You left it in my bed.

157
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:25,904
Come to look for it again.

158
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:35,747
Are you to be my muse, Rosaline?

159
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:38,917
Burbage has my keeping...

160
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,086
but you have my heart.

161
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,674
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

162
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,676
Will Shakespeare has a play.

163
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:50,095
Let's go and cough through it.

164
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:55,184
<i>My father weeping,
my mother wailing...</i>

165
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:59,938
<i>our maid howling,
our cat wringing her hands.</i>

166
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:03,400
<i>Yet did not this coldhearted cur...</i>

167
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:06,403
<i>shed one tear...</i>

168
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,251
You see?
Comedy.

169
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:27,466
Love, and a bit with a dog.
That's what they want.

170
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:39,394
<i>He is a stone, a very pebble stone,</i>

171
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:43,482
<i>and has no more pity in him
than a dog!</i>

172
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:46,568
<i>A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.</i>

173
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:51,448
<i>Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word...</i>

174
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:54,034
Well played, Master Crab!

175
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:58,163
I commend you!

176
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,794
<i>What light is light...</i>

177
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:06,338
<i>if Silvia be not seen?</i>

178
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:09,508
<i>What joy is joy...</i>

179
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:11,844
<i>if Silvia be not by?</i>

180
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:14,847
<i>Unless it be to think that she is by...</i>

181
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,851
<i>and feed upon the shadow of perfection.</i>

182
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:23,355
<i>Except I be by Silvia
in the night,</i>

183
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,900
<i>there is no music
in the nightingale.</i>

184
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:29,903
<i>Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,</i>

185
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:33,448
<i>there is no day for me to look upon.</i>

186
00:13:56,805 --> 00:14:00,434
Did you like Proteus
or Valentine best?

187
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:03,437
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

188
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:05,939
Oh, I liked the dog for laughs.

189
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:08,442
Silvia, I did not care for much.

190
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:10,444
His fingers were red
from fighting...

191
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:13,697
and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.

192
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,951
Stage love will never be true love
while the law of the land...

193
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:21,914
has our heroines being played
by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

194
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:25,083
-Oh, when can we see another?
-When the queen commands it.

195
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,002
No, but at the playhouse. Nurse!

196
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:30,964
Be still. Playhouses are not
for wellborn ladies.

197
00:14:30,964 --> 00:14:33,217
Oh! I'm not so wellborn.

198
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,803
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

199
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:38,305
and well-married
is more so.

200
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:40,724
Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.

201
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:43,310
All the men at court
are without poetry.

202
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,313
If they see me, they see
my father's fortune.

203
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:49,900
I will have poetry in my life...

204
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:51,902
and adventure.

205
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:55,697
And love.
Love above all.

206
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,741
Like Valentine and Silvia?

207
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:01,662
No, not the artful postures of love...

208
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:05,749
but love that overthrows life.

209
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,503
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart...

210
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:14,007
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

211
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:17,678
Love as there has never been
in a play.

212
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:21,682
I will have love,
or I will end my days as...

213
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:23,684
As a nurse?

214
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:28,564
Oh, but I would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

215
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:32,901
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

216
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,750
I would stay asleep my whole life...

217
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,993
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

218
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:44,121
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

219
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:49,543
Now spit.

220
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:16,320
This time the boots are coming off.

221
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:17,738
What have I done?

222
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:19,907
The theaters have all been
closed down by the plague.

223
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:22,826
-Oh, that.
-By order of the Master of the Revels.

224
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,331
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

225
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:32,169
The natural condition is one of insurmountable
obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.

226
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:34,087
-So what do we do?
-Nothing.

227
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:36,965
Strangely enough,
it all turns out well.

228
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:40,511
-How?
-I don't know. It's a mystery.

229
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:42,930
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

230
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,807
The theaters are reopened...

231
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,602
by order of the Master of the Revels!

232
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:51,855
The theaters are reopened!

233
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:56,318
Mr. Fennyman, Mr. Tilney
has reopened the playhouses.

234
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:58,737
If you wouldn't mind.

235
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:06,286
-Where’s the play?
-Oh, it's coming. It's coming.

236
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:10,833
It's coming.

237
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:23,929
Will!

238
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:25,931
Will, I have wonderful news.

239
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:28,058
So have I.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

240
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:29,935
God, I'm good!

241
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,938
Rosaline?
You mean Ethel.

242
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:40,070
Richard?

243
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,782
Burbage!

244
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:51,874
Mr. Tilney.

245
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:55,627
Like you,
I found him not at home.

246
00:17:57,963 --> 00:18:00,841
I would've made you immortal.

247
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,889
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

248
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:09,558
What does Burbage care of that?

249
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:13,395
He's readying the "Curtain"
for Kit Marlowe.

250
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,732
-You've opened the playhouses?
-I have, Master Shakespeare.

251
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:19,818
-But the plague...
-Yes, I know...

252
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:22,821
but he was always hanging around the house.

253
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:40,422
The special today is a pig's foot
marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

254
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:42,382
served on a buckwheat pancake...

255
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:47,471
-Will! Have you finished?
-Yes, nearly.

256
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:50,224
Good morning, Master Nol.
You'll have a nice part.

257
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:53,560
-Yes!
-We'll need Ralph for the pirate king.

258
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,854
Clear that bloody table!

259
00:18:55,854 --> 00:18:58,899
None other than the Admiral's Men
are out on tour.

260
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:01,068
I need actors!

261
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:05,155
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

262
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:10,452
-What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
-It won't cost you a penny! Ha ha ha!

263
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:12,287
Auditions in half an hour!

264
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:20,170
Ralph Bagswell,
I'd have a part for you...

265
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,506
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard's drunkard.

266
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,716
Never when I'm working.

267
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:27,427
Never when I'm working!

268
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:32,724
-Get me to drink mandragora.
-Straight up, Will?

269
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:36,103
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

270
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:37,855
Kit.

271
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:41,316
-How goes it, Will?
-Wonderful. Wonderful.

272
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,529
-Burbage says you have a play.
-I have, and the chinks to show for it.

273
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:48,282
I insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

274
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:51,368
I hear you have a new play
for the "Curtain".

275
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,537
Not new.
My "Doctor Faustus".

276
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:56,331
Ah. I love your early work.

277
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,084
<i>Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...</i>

278
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:01,712
<i>and burnt the topless towers
of llium?"</i>

279
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:04,715
I have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

280
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:06,633
"The Massacre at Paris".

281
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,513
-Good title.
-Yours?

282
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:14,349
"Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter".

283
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:20,022
-Yes, I know. I know.
-What is the story?

284
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:23,150
Well, there's this pirate...

285
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:28,655
In truth,
I have not written a word.

286
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:31,575
Romeo.

287
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:34,661
Romeo is Italian...

288
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:36,997
always in and out of love.

289
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,374
Yes, that's good.
Until he meets...

290
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:41,710
-Ethel.
-Do you think?

291
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:44,338
-The daughter of his enemy.
-The daughter of his enemy.

292
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:46,632
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

293
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:50,219
by Ethel's brother, or something.
His name is Mercutio.

294
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:52,137
Mercutio.
Good name.

295
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:55,641
-Will! They’re waiting for you!
-Yes, I'm coming.

296
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:58,477
Good luck with yours, Kit.

297
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,355
I thought your play
was for Burbage.

298
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:04,566
-This is a different one.
-A different one you haven't written?

299
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:07,027
<i>Was this the face...</i>

300
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,655
<i>that launched a thousand ships...</i>

301
00:21:09,655 --> 00:21:12,157
<i>and burnt the topless
towers of llium?</i>

302
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:13,742
Thank you!

303
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:16,495
<i>Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...</i>

304
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:17,871
<i>And burnt the top-</i>

305
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:19,289
Thank you!

306
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:21,291
<i>Was this the face...</i>

307
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,962
<i>that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless towers...</i>

308
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:27,756
I would like to give you something
from Faustus...

309
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:30,134
-by Christopher Marlowe.
-How refreshing.

310
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:31,927
<i>...the topless towers of llium?</i>

311
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:35,055
<i>Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.</i>

312
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,352
<i>W- W- Was this the f...</i>

313
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:44,022
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

314
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,277
My tailor wants to be an actor.

315
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:52,114
I have a few debts here and there.
Well, that seems to be everybody.

316
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:54,575
-Did you see a "Romeo"?
-I did not.

317
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:57,327
Well, I to my work,
you to yours.

318
00:21:57,327 --> 00:22:00,289
Oh, God.

319
00:22:05,252 --> 00:22:07,629
May I begin, sir?

320
00:22:08,255 --> 00:22:11,508
-Your name?
-Thomas Kent.

321
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:14,761
I would like to do a speech
by a writer...

322
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:17,181
who commands the heart of every player.

323
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:24,313
<i>What light is light...</i>

324
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:27,357
<i>if Silvia be not seen?</i>

325
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,988
<i>What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by?</i>

326
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:40,496
<i>Unless it be to think that she is by
and feed upon the shadow of perfection.</i>

327
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:46,877
<i>Except I be by Silvia
in the night...</i>

328
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,797
<i>there is no music
in the nightingale.</i>

329
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,344
<i>Unless I look on Silvia
in the day...</i>

330
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:59,306
<i>there is no day
for me to look upon.</i>

331
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:05,270
<i>She is my essence,
and I leave to be if I be not...</i>

332
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,106
-Take off your hat!
-My hat?

333
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:10,984
Where'd you learn how to do that?

334
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:13,403
-I...
-Let me see you. Take off your hat.

335
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:17,866
-Are you M-Master Shakespeare?
-Wait there. Wait there!

336
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:34,341
-Will, w-where are the pages?
-Where is the boy?

337
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:40,430
B- B- B- Break a leg!

338
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:47,062
Sir, will you buy my sweet orange?

339
00:24:05,873 --> 00:24:07,166
Hey!

340
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:27,603
Everybody ready? All away!

341
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:32,149
-Follow that boat!
-Right you are, governor.

342
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,282
I know your face.
Are you an actor?

343
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:43,744
-Yes.
-Yes, I think I've seen you in something.

344
00:24:43,744 --> 00:24:46,705
-That one about a king.
-Really?

345
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,375
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

346
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:05,808
-Do you know that house?
-Sir Robert De Lesseps.

347
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:19,947
Where is she?
Our guests are upon us!

348
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:23,867
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

349
00:25:23,951 --> 00:25:26,954
My husband will have it settled tonight.

350
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:29,581
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

351
00:25:29,581 --> 00:25:32,793
Tomorrow he drags me off to the country...

352
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:37,756
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

353
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:41,051
God save you, Mother.

354
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:44,054
Hot water, Nurse.

355
00:25:47,307 --> 00:25:49,143
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

356
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:51,103
-Who, sir?
-The actor.

357
00:25:51,145 --> 00:25:53,564
-Who asks for him?
-Will Shakespeare.

358
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:56,692
Poet, playwright of the "Rose".

359
00:25:56,775 --> 00:25:58,068
Master Kent...

360
00:25:58,152 --> 00:26:01,238
is my nephew.

361
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:03,240
I will wait.

362
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:05,742
Much good may it do you.

363
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:11,415
<i>"Romeo Montague...</i>

364
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:13,458
<i>a Young Man of Verona".</i>

365
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,419
Verona again?

366
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:17,504
<i>"A comedy of quarreling families...</i>

367
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:19,840
<i>"reconciled in the discovery
of Romeo...</i>

368
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,342
<i>"to be the very same Capulet cousin...</i>

369
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:26,221
<i>"stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...</i>

370
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:30,684
<i>"that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king".</i>

371
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:32,769
Your mother and your father...

372
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:35,772
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

373
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:39,109
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

374
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:41,737
-He looks well enough for a charlatan.
-Oh, Nurse!

375
00:26:41,778 --> 00:26:45,199
He would give Thomas Kent the life
of Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

376
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:47,784
My lady, when your parents return,
I will tell.

377
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:49,703
You will not tell.

378
00:26:49,786 --> 00:26:52,122
As I love you and you love me...

379
00:26:52,122 --> 00:26:56,502
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy's wig.

380
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,260
- Master Plum. What business here?
-The 5 schilling business, Will.

381
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,429
We play for the dancing.

382
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:30,160
-I seek Master Thomas Kent.
-Musicians don't eat.

383
00:27:30,327 --> 00:27:32,412
Sir Robert's orders.

384
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:35,207
She's a beauty, my lord,
as would take...

385
00:27:35,207 --> 00:27:37,793
a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

386
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:41,672
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

387
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:44,341
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

388
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:46,343
when your grandson is a Wessex.

389
00:27:46,343 --> 00:27:48,679
-Is she fertile?
-Oh, she will breed.

390
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,850
-If she do not, send her back.
-Is she obedient?

391
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:56,562
As any mule in Christendom.
But if you are the man to ride her...

392
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:59,731
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

393
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:01,942
I like her.

394
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:26,008
By all the stars in heaven.
Who is she?

395
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:29,553
Viola De Lesseps?
Dream on, Will.

396
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:10,135
Master Shakespeare.

397
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:19,812
-My lady Viola.
-My lord.

398
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,648
I have spoken with your father.

399
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:26,109
So, my lord?
I speak with him every day.

400
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:45,379
Good sir.

401
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:49,132
I heard you were a poet.

402
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:54,763
A poet of no words?

403
00:30:00,227 --> 00:30:01,979
Poet?

404
00:30:02,396 --> 00:30:06,358
I was a poet till now, but I've seen
beauty that puts...

405
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:10,279
my poems at one with
the talking ravens in the Tower.

406
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,198
-How do I offend, my lord?
-By coveting my property.

407
00:30:13,198 --> 00:30:16,034
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat...

408
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:18,453
anon.
Do you have a name?

409
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:21,331
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

410
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:47,858
Romeo! Romeo!

411
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:50,861
A Young Man of Verona.

412
00:30:50,944 --> 00:30:53,697
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

413
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,867
-My lady!
-Who is there?

414
00:30:57,951 --> 00:31:00,370
-Will Shakespeare.
-Madam!

415
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:03,624
Anon, good nurse,
anon.

416
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:08,086
-Master Shakespeare?
-The same, alas.

417
00:31:08,128 --> 00:31:10,839
-But why alas?
-A lowly player.

418
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:14,718
Alas, indeed, for I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

419
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:17,471
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

420
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:19,890
-I am him too.
-Madam!

421
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:22,893
Anon!
I will come again.

422
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:28,106
Oh, I am fortune's fool.
I will be punished for this.

423
00:31:30,943 --> 00:31:32,861
Oh, my lady, my love!

424
00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:36,031
If they find you here, they will kill you.

425
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:39,910
-You can bring them with a word.
-Oh, not for the world.

426
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,080
-Madam!
-Anon!

427
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:44,099
<i>Draw, if you be men!</i>

428
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:46,226
<i>Gregory,
remember thy swashing blow!</i>

429
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:49,688
<i>Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.</i>

430
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:52,691
It starts well, then it's all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

431
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:55,652
Where's the comedy, Will?
Where's the dog?

432
00:32:55,652 --> 00:32:57,154
Do you think it's funny?

433
00:32:57,196 --> 00:33:00,657
I was a pirate king, now I'm a nurse.
That's funny.

434
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:03,702
We are 6 men short, and those we
have will be over parted ranters...

435
00:33:03,702 --> 00:33:05,829
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

436
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:08,123
My Romeo's let me down.
I see disaster.

437
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:10,751
We are 4 acts short,
if you're looking for disaster.

438
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:13,587
-Sir!
-Who are you, master?

439
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:16,423
I'm Ethel, sir, the pirate's daughter.

440
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:19,468
I'll be damned if you are!

441
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:22,888
Your attention, please!

442
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,350
-Gentlemen, thank you!
-You are welcome.

443
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:29,102
-Who's that?
-Nobody. He's the author.

444
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:32,189
We are about to embark on a great voyage.

445
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:35,734
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

446
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:38,278
It does no harm.
Authors like it.

447
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:41,698
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we...

448
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:43,617
I'll do it.

449
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,119
Now listen to me, you dregs.

450
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:48,205
Actors are 10 a penny...

451
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:52,626
and I, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

452
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:54,294
Huzzah!

453
00:33:54,378 --> 00:33:57,965
The Admiral's Men
are returned to the house!

454
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:00,050
Huzzah!

455
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,094
Ned!

456
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,390
Henslowe!

457
00:34:06,473 --> 00:34:08,392
Earl! Good to see you.

458
00:34:12,604 --> 00:34:13,981
Who is this?

459
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:16,525
Silence, you dog!

460
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:19,528
I am "Hieronimo".

461
00:34:20,154 --> 00:34:23,907
I am "Tamburlaine".
I am "Faustus".

462
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:28,745
I am "Barabbas",
the Jew of Malta.

463
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:32,791
Oh, yes, Master Will.
I am "Henry the 6th".

464
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:36,837
What is the play,
and what is my part?

465
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,381
-Uh, one moment, sir...
-Who are you?

466
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:44,219
I'm, um... I'm the money.

467
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,431
Then you may remain,
so long as you remain silent.

468
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:51,351
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

469
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,812
-Thank you, sir.
-We are in desperate want...

470
00:34:53,812 --> 00:34:57,107
of a "Mercutio", Ned.
A young nobleman of Verona.

471
00:34:57,191 --> 00:34:59,193
-And the title of this piece?
-"Mercutio".

472
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:00,527
Is it?

473
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:03,780
I will play him.

474
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:08,410
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

475
00:35:08,494 --> 00:35:10,454
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

476
00:35:10,454 --> 00:35:12,706
Sam, my pretty one!

477
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,460
-Are you ready to fall in love again?
-I am, Master Shakespeare.

478
00:35:16,543 --> 00:35:18,754
Your voice.
Have they dropped?

479
00:35:18,837 --> 00:35:21,215
No! No.
A touch of cold only.

480
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:26,053
Master Henslowe, you have your actors,
except Thomas Kent.

481
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:28,597
I saw his "Tamburlaine", you know.

482
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,682
-It was wonderful.
-Yes, I saw it.

483
00:35:30,682 --> 00:35:32,684
Of course, such mighty writing.

484
00:35:32,684 --> 00:35:35,354
There's no one like Marlowe.

485
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:50,911
Better fortune, boy.

486
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,454
I was in a play.

487
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:55,874
They cut my head off
in "Titus Andronicus".

488
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:58,961
When I write plays,
they'll be like "Titus".

489
00:35:59,044 --> 00:36:00,504
You admire it.

490
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:02,756
I liked it when they cut heads off,

491
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:05,676
and the daughter mutilated with knives.

492
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:08,554
-What's your name?
-John Webster.

493
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:09,930
Here, kitty, kitty.

494
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:16,603
Plenty of blood.

495
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:18,564
That's the only writing.

496
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:22,067
I have to get back.

497
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:25,112
<i>See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.</i>

498
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:27,322
<i>I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.</i>

499
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:30,951
<i>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.</i>

500
00:36:30,993 --> 00:36:32,286
Cut around him for now.

501
00:36:32,286 --> 00:36:33,662
-What? Who?
-Romeo.

502
00:36:33,662 --> 00:36:35,664
-The one who came with your letter.
-What?

503
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:37,291
<i>Good morrow, cousin.</i>

504
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:40,919
<i>-Is the day so young?
-But new struck nine.</i>

505
00:36:41,003 --> 00:36:43,172
<i>Ay me.
Sad hours seem long.</i>

506
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:45,716
<i>What sadness
lengthens Romeo's hours?</i>

507
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:48,552
<i>Not having that which having
makes them short.</i>

508
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:49,428
Good!

509
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,054
<i>-In love?
-Out.</i>

510
00:36:51,054 --> 00:36:54,933
<i>-Of love?
-Out of her favour where I am in love.</i>

511
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:57,644
No, no, don't spend it all at once.

512
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:00,481
Yes, sir.

513
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:03,233
-Do you understand me?
-No, sir.

514
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:06,653
You're speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

515
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:09,990
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet?

516
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,075
-Juliet? You mean Ethel.
-God's teeth!

517
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:15,496
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

518
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,252
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

519
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:26,507
I'm very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

520
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:31,678
Of course you have not.
I have not written it. Go once more.

521
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:36,016
Will.
Where is Mercutio?

522
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:39,102
Locked safe in here. I'll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

523
00:37:39,102 --> 00:37:41,021
I have a sonnet to write.

524
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:43,190
Sonnet?
You mean a play!

525
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:53,075
<i>" For Lady Viola De Lesseps,
by the hand of Thomas Kent.</i>

526
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:57,371
<i>" Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</i>

527
00:37:57,412 --> 00:38:00,791
<i>" Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.</i>

528
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:05,838
<i>" Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May... "</i>

529
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:07,881
Two hours at prayer!

530
00:38:07,965 --> 00:38:12,010
-Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
-Piety is for Sunday!

531
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:15,139
And 2 hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

532
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,641
It would be better that you return
tomorrow, my lord.

533
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:20,477
It would be better if you'd tell her
to get off her knees and show...

534
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,605
some civility to her 6day
lord and master!

535
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:27,526
Mmmph!

536
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,159
My lady Viola.

537
00:38:35,242 --> 00:38:38,537
Lord Wessex.
You've been waiting.

538
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:39,663
I am aware of it.

539
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:43,292
But it is beauty's privilege.

540
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:45,002
You flatter, my lord.

541
00:38:45,085 --> 00:38:48,839
No. I have spoken to the queen.

542
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:52,926
Her Majesty's consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife...

543
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:54,720
and once given,
her consent is her command.

544
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:57,264
Do you intend to marry, my lord?

545
00:38:57,347 --> 00:39:02,102
Your father should keep you better
informed. He has bought me for you.

546
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:07,274
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

547
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:09,943
You are allowed to show your pleasure.

548
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:13,947
But I do not love you, my lord.

549
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:16,783
How your mind hops about.

550
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:19,328
Your father was a shopkeeper.

551
00:39:19,328 --> 00:39:22,372
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

552
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:24,583
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

553
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,210
You will like Virginia.

554
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:28,879
-Virginia?
-Oh, yes.

555
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:32,049
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

556
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:35,761
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

557
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:38,680
I fancy tobacco has a future.

558
00:39:38,764 --> 00:39:41,725
We will not stay there long, 3-4 years.

559
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:46,230
-But why me?
-It was your eyes.

560
00:39:47,523 --> 00:39:49,358
No, your lips.

561
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,913
Will you defy your father
and your queen?

562
00:40:02,913 --> 00:40:04,915
The queen has consented?

563
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:06,834
She wants to inspect you.

564
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,503
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

565
00:40:09,586 --> 00:40:15,926
Be submissive, modest,
grateful and brief.

566
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:20,514
I will do my duty, my lord.

567
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:29,857
<i>"Master Will,
poet dearest to my heart...</i>

568
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,861
<i>I beseech you
banish me from yours.</i>

569
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:37,197
<i>I am to marry Lord Wessex.</i>

570
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:40,701
<i>A daughter's duty...</i>

571
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:43,203
<i>and the queen's command".</i>

572
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:08,562
Gentlemen upstage, Ladies downstage.

573
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:14,151
Gentlemen upstage, Ladies downstage.

574
00:41:14,234 --> 00:41:17,488
Are you a lady Mr. Kent?

575
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:19,323
I'm very sorry, sir.

576
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:24,828
We're gonna have to do it again.

577
00:41:26,163 --> 00:41:28,582
You did not like the speech?

578
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:30,667
No, the speech is excellent.

579
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:34,338
<i>Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.</i>

580
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:36,673
Excellent and a good length.

581
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:41,136
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

582
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:44,515
There. You have this duel.

583
00:41:44,598 --> 00:41:48,477
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

584
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:53,524
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

585
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:56,360
<i>A plague on both your houses!</i>

586
00:42:01,907 --> 00:42:03,742
He dies?

587
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:09,289
-Ohh!
-Will!

588
00:42:09,414 --> 00:42:11,375
Where are my pages?

589
00:42:23,595 --> 00:42:25,556
Did you give her my letter?

590
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:29,393
And this is for you!

591
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:45,576
Oh, Thomas, she has cut my strings.

592
00:42:47,035 --> 00:42:48,912
I'm unmanned...

593
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:52,124
unmended and unmade...

594
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:54,084
like a puppet in a box.

595
00:42:54,209 --> 00:42:56,920
-Writer, is he?
-Row your boat!

596
00:42:57,129 --> 00:43:00,841
She tells me to keep away.
She is to marry Lord Wessex!

597
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:02,301
What should I do?

598
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:04,887
If you love her,
you must do as she asks.

599
00:43:04,928 --> 00:43:08,056
-And break her heart and mine?
-It is only yours you can know.

600
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:11,477
-She loves me, Thomas!
-Does she say so?

601
00:43:11,477 --> 00:43:15,063
No, and yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

602
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:18,442
-Was she weeping when she gave you this?
-Uh...

603
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:21,862
-Her letter came to me by the nurse.
-Your aunt.

604
00:43:21,987 --> 00:43:23,739
Yes, my aunt.

605
00:43:24,865 --> 00:43:27,242
But perhaps she wept a little.

606
00:43:29,536 --> 00:43:31,788
Tell me how you love her, Will.

607
00:43:31,872 --> 00:43:35,876
Like a sickness and its cure together.

608
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:38,170
Oh, yes.

609
00:43:38,253 --> 00:43:40,631
Like rain and sun.

610
00:43:40,714 --> 00:43:43,300
Like cold and heat.

611
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:46,845
Is your lady beautiful?

612
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:51,892
Since I came here from the country,
I have not seen her close.

613
00:43:51,975 --> 00:43:54,895
Tell me, is...
is she beautiful?

614
00:43:54,978 --> 00:43:58,774
Thomas, if I could write
with the beauty of her eyes...

615
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:02,820
I was born to look in them
and know myself.

616
00:44:04,238 --> 00:44:06,740
-A-A-And her lips?
-Her lips?

617
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:11,161
The early morning rose would wither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

618
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:13,914
And her voice,
like lark's song?

619
00:44:13,914 --> 00:44:16,917
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

620
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:20,587
I would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

621
00:44:20,587 --> 00:44:23,257
-Ah, she sings too?
-Constantly.

622
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,802
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

623
00:44:26,802 --> 00:44:28,846
And her bosom.

624
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:32,975
-Did I mention her bosom?
-What of her bosom?

625
00:44:33,058 --> 00:44:35,686
Oh, Thomas, a pair of pippins...

626
00:44:35,686 --> 00:44:38,689
as round and rare
as golden apples.

627
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,775
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

628
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:45,279
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

629
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:48,157
when her eyes and lips and voice...

630
00:44:48,157 --> 00:44:51,160
may be no more beautiful than mine.

631
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:54,705
Besides, can a... can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

632
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:58,417
love happily with
a bank side poet and player?

633
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:00,711
Yes, by God!

634
00:45:00,794 --> 00:45:03,630
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

635
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,884
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king...

636
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:09,386
an their love should be minded by each...

637
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:12,139
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

638
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:15,225
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

639
00:45:15,225 --> 00:45:17,144
But what of Lord Wessex?

640
00:45:17,227 --> 00:45:20,647
For one kiss I would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

641
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:30,574
Oh, Will.

642
00:45:31,658 --> 00:45:33,660
Thank you, my lady.

643
00:45:35,662 --> 00:45:37,164
Lady?

644
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:40,667
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

645
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:43,504
Wouldn't deceive a child.

646
00:45:44,963 --> 00:45:49,259
Strangely enough,
I'm a bit of a writer me self.

647
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:52,012
It wouldn't take you long to read it.

648
00:45:52,012 --> 00:45:54,723
I expect you'd know all the booksellers!

649
00:46:03,315 --> 00:46:05,317
Can you love a fool?

650
00:46:05,317 --> 00:46:08,111
Can you love a player?

651
00:46:16,036 --> 00:46:18,497
Wait!
You're still a maid...

652
00:46:18,497 --> 00:46:21,708
and perhaps as mistook in me
as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

653
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,545
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

654
00:46:24,545 --> 00:46:26,129
I am.

655
00:46:26,213 --> 00:46:29,132
Then kiss me again,
for I am not mistook.

656
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:45,107
I do not know how to undress a man.

657
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,192
It is strange to me too.

658
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:03,185
Go to.
Go to.

659
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:12,277
I would not have thought it.

660
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,490
There is something
better than a play.

661
00:48:16,573 --> 00:48:19,117
There is.

662
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:21,620
Even your play.

663
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:25,624
Oh?

664
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:29,503
And that was only my first try.

665
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:47,938
Will.

666
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:52,734
You would not leave me.

667
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,820
I must.

668
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,072
Look how pale the window.

669
00:48:57,072 --> 00:48:58,949
Moonlight.

670
00:48:59,074 --> 00:49:01,910
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

671
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:05,122
It was the owl.
Come to bed.

672
00:49:07,207 --> 00:49:09,585
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

673
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:13,422
Mr. Henslowe?

674
00:49:13,547 --> 00:49:15,966
Mmm, let him be damned for his pages.

675
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:17,926
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

676
00:49:18,051 --> 00:49:20,929
There is time. Mmm!
It is still dark.

677
00:49:21,054 --> 00:49:24,016
-It's broad day. The rooster tells us so.
-It was the owl.

678
00:49:24,057 --> 00:49:26,643
Believe me, love, it was the owl...

679
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:31,190
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

680
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:36,111
My lady?

681
00:49:36,236 --> 00:49:38,989
The house is stirring.
It is a new day.

682
00:49:40,073 --> 00:49:42,451
It is a new world.

683
00:49:42,576 --> 00:49:45,537
<i>Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...</i>

684
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:48,248
<i>which mannerly devotion
shows in this.</i>

685
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:51,543
<i>For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...</i>

686
00:49:51,543 --> 00:49:54,963
<i>and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.</i>

687
00:49:55,047 --> 00:49:58,759
<i>Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?</i>

688
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:00,761
<i>Aye, pilgrim.</i>

689
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:03,263
<i>Lips that they must use
in prayer.</i>

690
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:06,600
<i>Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.</i>

691
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,519
<i>They pray.</i>

692
00:50:08,602 --> 00:50:12,022
<i>Grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.</i>

693
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:15,526
<i>Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.</i>

694
00:50:17,236 --> 00:50:20,489
-It's you.
-Suffering cats!

695
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:26,954
<i>Then move not while
my prayer's effect I take.</i>

696
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:34,711
<i>Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.</i>

697
00:50:34,795 --> 00:50:37,631
<i>Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.</i>

698
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:42,469
<i>Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.</i>

699
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:45,097
Yes, yes!
Um, not quite right.

700
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,182
It is more...
Let me.

701
00:50:47,266 --> 00:50:50,227
<i>Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.</i>

702
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:55,357
<i>Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.</i>

703
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:03,699
-You kiss by the book.
-Well, Will!

704
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:05,784
It was lucky you were here.

705
00:51:05,868 --> 00:51:08,370
-Why do not I write the rest of your play...
-Yes, yes!

706
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:12,583
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph?

707
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:16,545
<i>Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.</i>

708
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:21,175
<i>-What is her mother?
-Marry, bachelor,</i>

709
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:23,844
<i>her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...</i>

710
00:51:23,844 --> 00:51:26,054
<i>and a wise and virtuous.</i>

711
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:29,141
<i>I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.</i>

712
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:33,896
<i>I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks.</i>

713
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:36,064
<i>Is she a Capulet?</i>

714
00:51:36,148 --> 00:51:40,235
<i>Oh, dear account!
My life is my foe's debt.</i>

715
00:51:40,235 --> 00:51:43,030
<i>Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.</i>

716
00:51:43,113 --> 00:51:46,200
<i>Aye, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.</i>

717
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:50,621
<i>Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman?</i>

718
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:53,165
<i>The son and heir of old Tiberio.</i>

719
00:51:53,165 --> 00:51:55,501
Let it be night.

720
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:59,046
<i>What's he that follows
here that would not dance?</i>

721
00:51:59,046 --> 00:52:01,798
<i>-I know not.
-Go ask his name.</i>

722
00:52:03,217 --> 00:52:07,054
<i>If he be married, my grave is like
to be my wedding bed.</i>

723
00:52:08,722 --> 00:52:10,140
No, do not go.

724
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:12,142
I must. I must.

725
00:52:12,226 --> 00:52:15,479
<i>-The only son of your great enemy.
-Terrible.</i>

726
00:52:15,562 --> 00:52:17,648
<i>Simply... terrible!</i>

727
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:28,992
<i>But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?</i>

728
00:52:29,076 --> 00:52:33,872
<i>It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun.</i>

729
00:52:33,956 --> 00:52:38,502
<i>Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...</i>

730
00:52:38,585 --> 00:52:41,588
<i>who is already sick
and pale with grief...</i>

731
00:52:41,588 --> 00:52:46,135
<i>that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she".</i>

732
00:52:46,218 --> 00:52:48,971
-Oh, Will.
-Yes, some of it's speak able.

733
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:51,932
<i>It is my lady.
Oh, it is my love!</i>

734
00:52:51,932 --> 00:52:54,768
<i>Oh, that she knew she were!</i>

735
00:52:54,852 --> 00:52:58,438
<i>The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...</i>

736
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:00,899
<i>as daylight doth a lamp".</i>

737
00:53:00,899 --> 00:53:04,111
<i>Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...</i>

738
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:06,697
<i>stream so bright...</i>

739
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,909
<i>that birds would sing
and think it were not night.</i>

740
00:53:10,951 --> 00:53:15,164
<i>See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.</i>

741
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:18,167
<i>Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand...</i>

742
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,502
<i>that I might touch that cheek.</i>

743
00:53:20,586 --> 00:53:21,753
<i>Ay, me.</i>

744
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:25,841
<i>Oh, Romeo, Romeo!</i>

745
00:53:25,924 --> 00:53:28,510
<i>Wherefore art thou, Romeo?</i>

746
00:53:28,594 --> 00:53:32,222
<i>-Deny thy father and...
-and refuse thy name.</i>

747
00:53:32,306 --> 00:53:35,225
<i>Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...</i>

748
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:37,978
<i>and I'll no longer be a Capulet.</i>

749
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:40,981
<i>Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?</i>

750
00:53:42,149 --> 00:53:44,985
<i>What man art thou that
thus be screened in night...</i>

751
00:53:44,985 --> 00:53:47,696
<i>so stumblest on my counsel?"</i>

752
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:51,074
<i>By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.</i>

753
00:53:51,116 --> 00:53:55,871
<i>My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.</i>

754
00:53:55,871 --> 00:53:59,333
<i>Had I it written
I would tear the word.</i>

755
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:03,754
<i>The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...</i>

756
00:54:03,837 --> 00:54:07,007
<i>and the place death,
considering who thou art...</i>

757
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,760
<i>if any of my kinsmen find thee here.</i>

758
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,805
<i>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</i>

759
00:54:12,888 --> 00:54:17,392
<i>Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.</i>

760
00:54:17,392 --> 00:54:21,897
<i>Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.</i>

761
00:54:21,897 --> 00:54:24,274
<i>Would not for the world
they saw thee here.</i>

762
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:27,277
<i>I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.</i>

763
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:30,781
<i>-And but thou love me let them find me here.
-Good night.</i>

764
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:32,825
<i>Good night...</i>

765
00:54:32,908 --> 00:54:35,869
<i>as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...</i>

766
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:38,247
<i>as that within my breast.</i>

767
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,624
<i>Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</i>

768
00:54:40,624 --> 00:54:44,253
-That's my line.
-Oh. It is mine too.

769
00:54:44,336 --> 00:54:47,381
<i>Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</i>

770
00:54:47,422 --> 00:54:49,967
<i>What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?</i>

771
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,637
<i>The exchange of thy love’s
faithful vow for mine.</i>

772
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:57,099
<i>My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.</i>

773
00:54:57,224 --> 00:54:59,852
<i>My love is deep.</i>

774
00:54:59,935 --> 00:55:02,479
<i>The more I give to thee...</i>

775
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:04,523
<i>the more I have...</i>

776
00:55:04,606 --> 00:55:06,692
<i>for both are infinite.</i>

777
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:09,153
Madam?

778
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:13,365
<i>-I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
-Juliet!</i>

779
00:55:13,448 --> 00:55:15,242
Anon, good nurse.

780
00:55:15,242 --> 00:55:18,328
<i>Anon, good nurse
Sweet Montague, be true.</i>

781
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:21,373
Stay but a little.
I will come again.

782
00:55:21,456 --> 00:55:24,376
<i>Stay but a little.
I will come again.</i>

783
00:55:24,459 --> 00:55:26,837
<i>Oh, blessed, blessed night.</i>

784
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,507
<i>I am a feared...</i>

785
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:35,012
<i>being in night,
all this is but a dream.</i>

786
00:55:35,137 --> 00:55:39,933
<i>Too flattering sweet
to be substantial.</i>

787
00:55:42,728 --> 00:55:45,731
<i>To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.</i>

788
00:55:45,731 --> 00:55:47,733
<i>A thousand times, good night.</i>

789
00:55:47,816 --> 00:55:50,319
<i>A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.</i>

790
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,198
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

791
00:55:54,198 --> 00:55:57,868
I have no neck in this pig dress.

792
00:56:01,163 --> 00:56:04,833
-How is it?
-It's all right.

793
00:56:08,754 --> 00:56:11,507
Ned, I know, I know.

794
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,510
-It's good.
-Oh?

795
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:17,346
The title won't do.

796
00:56:17,429 --> 00:56:19,181
Ah.

797
00:56:19,264 --> 00:56:22,726
"Romeo and Juliet".
Just a suggestion.

798
00:56:23,936 --> 00:56:25,854
Thank you, Ned.

799
00:56:28,023 --> 00:56:33,195
-You are a gentleman.
-And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

800
00:56:33,278 --> 00:56:36,073
<i>-What o'lock tomorrow shall I send to thee?
-By the hour of nine.</i>

801
00:56:36,073 --> 00:56:38,367
<i>I shall not fail.
"Tis 20 year till then.</i>

802
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:40,536
<i>I have forgot why I called thee back.</i>

803
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:43,330
-You mean no dog of any kind?
-Shh! Silence.

804
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:48,752
The friar marries them in secret, then Ned
gets into a fight with one of the Capulets.

805
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:51,380
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned's way.

806
00:56:51,421 --> 00:56:53,048
I mean, in Mercutio's way.

807
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:56,510
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

808
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,887
Then the prince banishes him
from Verona.

809
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:01,181
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

810
00:57:01,265 --> 00:57:03,267
on the island of the pirate king.

811
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:07,146
For God's sake, cease your prattling
and get out!

812
00:57:07,229 --> 00:57:09,690
Get out!

813
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:14,278
A thousand apologies.

814
00:57:16,029 --> 00:57:18,782
Please.

815
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:21,702
<i>...and with a silken thread
plucks it back again...</i>

816
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:24,037
<i>so loving-jealous
of his liberty.</i>

817
00:57:24,037 --> 00:57:26,665
<i>I would I were thy bird.</i>

818
00:57:26,665 --> 00:57:29,751
<i>-Sweet, so would I; yet I should
kill thee with much cherishing.</i>

819
00:57:30,169 --> 00:57:33,338
<i>Good night.
Good night.</i>

820
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:38,385
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.</i>

821
00:57:45,976 --> 00:57:48,770
Sunday.

822
00:57:48,854 --> 00:57:50,981
"Tis Sunday.

823
00:57:57,571 --> 00:58:00,532
I found something in my sleep.

824
00:58:00,616 --> 00:58:04,077
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

825
00:58:04,953 --> 00:58:08,874
-But it will end well for love.
-In heaven, perhaps.

826
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:11,668
It is not a comedy I'm writing now.

827
00:58:13,504 --> 00:58:16,757
A broad river divides my lovers.

828
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,302
Family, duty, fate.

829
00:58:22,596 --> 00:58:25,641
As unchangeable as nature.

830
00:58:25,724 --> 00:58:27,184
Yes.

831
00:58:28,644 --> 00:58:31,271
This is not life, Will.

832
00:58:31,772 --> 00:58:34,358
It is a stolen season.

833
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,527
Be patient, my lord.

834
00:58:36,527 --> 00:58:40,155
-Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
-My Lord, I will go...

835
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:43,242
Sunday.
Greenwich!

836
00:58:46,745 --> 00:58:48,664
Now, pay attention, nursie.

837
00:58:48,747 --> 00:58:51,250
The queen...
Gloriana Regina...

838
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:54,920
God's chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us...

839
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,131
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening's festivities...

840
00:58:58,131 --> 00:59:01,385
to bestow her gracious favour
on my choice of wife.

841
00:59:01,385 --> 00:59:04,096
And if we're late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

842
00:59:04,096 --> 00:59:08,350
So get you to my lady's chamber and produce her
with or without her undergarments!

843
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,769
You cannot!
Not for the queen herself!

844
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:14,022
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

845
00:59:14,106 --> 00:59:16,275
To be the wife of a poor player?

846
00:59:16,316 --> 00:59:20,737
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

847
00:59:20,779 --> 00:59:24,575
And yet I would if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

848
00:59:24,616 --> 00:59:27,202
You follow your desire freely enough
in the night.

849
00:59:27,202 --> 00:59:30,581
-So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
-Then I'll go with you.

850
00:59:30,622 --> 00:59:33,709
-You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
-I know how to fight.

851
00:59:33,709 --> 00:59:35,794
Stage fighting.

852
00:59:36,336 --> 00:59:38,005
Oh, Will.

853
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,050
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you...

854
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:45,429
but as Viola,
the river divides us...

855
00:59:45,512 --> 00:59:49,600
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

856
00:59:49,683 --> 00:59:52,603
I'll drag her down
by the queen's command!

857
00:59:55,522 --> 00:59:57,524
Good morning, my Lord.

858
00:59:57,608 --> 01:00:02,654
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

859
01:00:02,738 --> 01:00:06,283
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

860
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:08,827
Are you bringing your laundrywoman?

861
01:00:11,205 --> 01:00:13,999
Her chaperone,
my lady's country cousin.

862
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:19,296
My, but you be a handsome gallant,
just as she said.

863
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:21,423
You may call me Miss Wilhelmina.

864
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:25,010
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps.

865
01:00:25,093 --> 01:00:27,930
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

866
01:00:28,013 --> 01:00:32,643
Aye, she never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

867
01:01:05,342 --> 01:01:07,010
-Now?
-Now.

868
01:01:07,678 --> 01:01:10,681
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

869
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,978
-Is there a man?
-A man, my lord?

870
01:01:15,978 --> 01:01:19,648
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, I think.

871
01:01:19,648 --> 01:01:22,526
-Does he come to the house?
-A theater poet?

872
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:26,196
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

873
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:28,490
-Has he been to the house?
-Marlowe?

874
01:01:28,574 --> 01:01:30,868
Oh, yes. He is the one.

875
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:34,454
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

876
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,249
That dog!

877
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:55,017
Your Majesty.

878
01:01:56,268 --> 01:01:58,520
Stand up straight, girl.

879
01:02:02,191 --> 01:02:04,067
I've seen you.

880
01:02:04,193 --> 01:02:07,988
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

881
01:02:07,988 --> 01:02:10,532
Your Majesty.

882
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,577
What do you love so much?

883
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:17,331
-Your Majesty...
-Speak up, girl, I know who I am!

884
01:02:17,873 --> 01:02:21,084
Do you love stories
of kings and queens...

885
01:02:21,126 --> 01:02:25,714
of feats of arms,
or is it courtly love?

886
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:27,758
I love theater.

887
01:02:27,758 --> 01:02:31,094
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed...

888
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,807
They're not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And?

889
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:40,979
-And I love poetry above all.
-Above Lord Wessex?

890
01:02:41,814 --> 01:02:46,109
My lord, when you cannot find your wife,
you better look for her at the playhouse.

891
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:51,406
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

892
01:02:51,448 --> 01:02:54,910
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

893
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:58,163
-They cannot make it true.
-Oh, but they can.

894
01:03:02,084 --> 01:03:07,256
I mean, Your Majesty, they...
they do not, they have... not...

895
01:03:07,339 --> 01:03:10,134
but I believe
there is one who can.

896
01:03:10,634 --> 01:03:15,097
My Lady Viola is young in the world.
Your Majesty is wise in it.

897
01:03:15,139 --> 01:03:17,891
Nature and truth
are the very enemies of playacting.

898
01:03:17,933 --> 01:03:22,104
-I’ll wager my fortune.
-I thought you were here because you had none.

899
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:31,947
-Well, no one will take your wager, it seems.
-50 pounds.

900
01:03:34,616 --> 01:03:36,493
50 pounds?

901
01:03:38,036 --> 01:03:42,958
A very worthy sum on a very worthy question.

902
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:47,880
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

903
01:03:48,255 --> 01:03:51,508
I bear witness to the wager...

904
01:03:51,592 --> 01:03:55,137
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

905
01:03:57,431 --> 01:04:00,142
I have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

906
01:04:01,059 --> 01:04:03,645
Are there no more fireworks?

907
01:04:03,729 --> 01:04:08,192
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola's audience.

908
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:11,945
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

909
01:04:12,029 --> 01:04:16,074
She's been plucked since I saw her last,
and not by you.

910
01:04:16,074 --> 01:04:18,994
It takes a woman to know it.

911
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:24,541
Marlowe.

912
01:04:35,469 --> 01:04:37,387
Burbage?

913
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:40,349
Huh? Who's there?

914
01:04:40,432 --> 01:04:43,101
Marlowe.

915
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:46,772
You are playing my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

916
01:04:46,772 --> 01:04:48,982
Don't spend yourself in sport.

917
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:52,736
-What do you want, Kit?
-My "Massacre at Paris" is complete.

918
01:04:52,736 --> 01:04:56,114
-What? You have the last act?
-If you have the money.

919
01:04:56,114 --> 01:05:00,202
-Tomorrow.
-Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

920
01:05:00,285 --> 01:05:02,579
Oh, will you desist, madam!

921
01:05:02,663 --> 01:05:05,582
-Oh!
-20 pounds on delivery.

922
01:05:05,624 --> 01:05:08,961
Now, what is money to men like us?

923
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:14,842
Besides, if I need a play, I have another
waiting... a comedy by Shakespeare.

924
01:05:14,925 --> 01:05:16,802
Oh, "Romeo".

925
01:05:16,885 --> 01:05:20,097
-Gave it to Henslowe.
-Never!

926
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,267
Well, I'm to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

927
01:05:23,267 --> 01:05:26,395
I gave Shakespeare
2 sovereigns for "Romeo".

928
01:05:26,478 --> 01:05:30,983
You did, but Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men
have the playing of it at the "Rose".

929
01:05:30,983 --> 01:05:32,943
Treachery!

930
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:36,530
Traitor and thief!

931
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:41,702
Oh, no.

932
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:43,787
No!

933
01:06:01,555 --> 01:06:03,724
<i>By my head, here comes the Capulets.</i>

934
01:06:03,724 --> 01:06:06,643
<i>By my heel, I care not.</i>

935
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:10,105
<i>Follow me close.
I will speak with them.</i>

936
01:06:10,105 --> 01:06:13,192
<i>Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.</i>

937
01:06:13,233 --> 01:06:15,486
Are you going to do it like that?

938
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:17,779
Positions.

939
01:06:17,863 --> 01:06:22,242
<i>-By my head, here comes the Capulets.
-By my heel, I care not.</i>

940
01:06:22,242 --> 01:06:24,578
<i>Follow me close.
I will speak to them.</i>

941
01:06:24,578 --> 01:06:27,539
<i>Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.</i>

942
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:31,001
<i>And but one word with one of us?</i>

943
01:06:31,084 --> 01:06:33,921
<i>Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.</i>

944
01:06:33,921 --> 01:06:37,758
Where's that thieving hack that
can't keep his pen in his own ink pot?

945
01:06:37,758 --> 01:06:39,885
What is this rabble?

946
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:45,015
Draw, if you be a man!

947
01:07:08,038 --> 01:07:10,415
Wonderful.
Wonderful!

948
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:14,711
And a dog.

949
01:07:16,296 --> 01:07:18,257
No!

950
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:21,593
Have privy, players! Please!

951
01:07:21,677 --> 01:07:24,555
Oh! Not with my props!

952
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:26,056
Oh!

953
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,059
-Will! What...
-A writer's quarrel.

954
01:07:29,143 --> 01:07:31,520
Quite normal.

955
01:07:32,938 --> 01:07:35,065
Stay here.

956
01:07:47,786 --> 01:07:49,371
You are hurt.

957
01:08:02,342 --> 01:08:05,804
I dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

958
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:10,809
-You were cast ashore in a far country.
-Oh, not yet. Not yet.

959
01:08:10,934 --> 01:08:13,979
Hey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

960
01:08:13,979 --> 01:08:16,273
My investment!
Lambert!

961
01:08:17,733 --> 01:08:19,943
Vengeance!

962
01:08:47,429 --> 01:08:49,473
A famous victory!

963
01:08:49,598 --> 01:08:53,644
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house!

964
01:08:53,769 --> 01:08:55,854
Oh, what happy hour.

965
01:08:55,938 --> 01:08:59,107
-This is a tavern!
-It is also a tavern.

966
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:03,987
-I remember you. The poet!
-Yes, William the Conqueror.

967
01:09:04,404 --> 01:09:07,157
One at a time.
One at a time.

968
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:11,787
Oh, he's a pretty one. Tell me
your story while I tickle your fancy.

969
01:09:15,249 --> 01:09:19,086
-It's a house of ill repute.
-It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

970
01:09:19,086 --> 01:09:21,964
Come.
There's no harm in a drink.

971
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:26,844
You are welcome to my best house.
Here's to the Admiral's Men.

972
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:28,720
-The Admiral's Men!
-The Admiral's Men!

973
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,639
The Admiral's Men!

974
01:09:53,787 --> 01:09:57,040
Well, I... I quite liked it.

975
01:09:57,124 --> 01:09:58,584
Master Kent...

976
01:09:59,334 --> 01:10:02,462
you have not yet dipped your wick.

977
01:10:03,964 --> 01:10:06,133
My wick?

978
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:10,929
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theater,
you must have a part in my play.

979
01:10:10,929 --> 01:10:15,893
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

980
01:10:15,976 --> 01:10:19,062
My heavens.
I thank you.

981
01:10:19,146 --> 01:10:21,440
What's the play about, then?

982
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:23,692
Well, there's this nurse...

983
01:10:28,405 --> 01:10:31,283
Silence, silence, silence!

984
01:10:31,992 --> 01:10:38,749
Master Shakespeare has asked me
to play the part of the apothecary.

985
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:43,086
The apothecary?

986
01:10:43,086 --> 01:10:46,673
Will, what is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

987
01:10:46,757 --> 01:10:48,926
How does the comedy end?

988
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:53,305
-By God, I wish I knew.
-By God, if you do not, who does?

989
01:10:53,305 --> 01:10:57,017
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending...

990
01:10:57,059 --> 01:11:01,188
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

991
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:20,165
Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

992
01:11:20,249 --> 01:11:24,127
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

993
01:11:24,127 --> 01:11:26,547
Marlowe is dead.

994
01:11:30,467 --> 01:11:32,803
Stabbed.

995
01:11:32,886 --> 01:11:37,266
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

996
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:41,603
What have I done?

997
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:45,065
He was the first man among us.

998
01:11:45,149 --> 01:11:47,818
A great light has gone out.

999
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:05,627
Forgive me.

1000
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:10,924
God forgive me.

1001
01:12:37,493 --> 01:12:40,662
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake.

1002
01:12:40,746 --> 01:12:43,165
~One morning in the month of May~

1003
01:12:43,248 --> 01:12:46,293
~From my cot I stray~

1004
01:12:46,376 --> 01:12:49,046
~Just at the dawning of the day~

1005
01:12:49,129 --> 01:12:51,715
~I met with a charming maid~

1006
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:57,387
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

1007
01:12:57,471 --> 01:13:01,475
-It's not my riding day, my lord.
-Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

1008
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:03,602
I'm going to church.

1009
01:13:03,685 --> 01:13:07,397
Of course. I understand.
It is to be expected.

1010
01:13:07,481 --> 01:13:10,901
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

1011
01:13:10,984 --> 01:13:14,279
And on a day of mourning.

1012
01:13:14,363 --> 01:13:17,491
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

1013
01:13:17,574 --> 01:13:19,576
Mourning?

1014
01:13:21,328 --> 01:13:24,081
Who is dead, my lord?

1015
01:13:24,164 --> 01:13:29,086
Oh! Dear God, I did not think
it would be me to tell you.

1016
01:13:29,169 --> 01:13:33,799
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

1017
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:36,844
My lady.

1018
01:13:36,927 --> 01:13:40,597
-He is dead?
-Killed last night in a tavern.

1019
01:13:42,224 --> 01:13:45,811
Come then.
We'll say a prayer for his soul.

1020
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:56,530
~Who can remember sorrow~

1021
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:34,568
Spare me, dear ghost.

1022
01:14:34,651 --> 01:14:38,197
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me!

1023
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:52,961
Will!

1024
01:14:54,087 --> 01:14:55,964
Oh, my love.

1025
01:14:56,757 --> 01:14:58,842
I thought you were dead.

1026
01:15:03,305 --> 01:15:05,182
It is worse.

1027
01:15:06,099 --> 01:15:08,185
I've killed a man.

1028
01:15:12,523 --> 01:15:15,442
Marlowe's touch
was in my "Titus Andronicus"...

1029
01:15:15,442 --> 01:15:19,071
and my "Henry 6th" was a house built
on his foundations.

1030
01:15:20,197 --> 01:15:22,866
You never spoke so well of him.

1031
01:15:22,866 --> 01:15:25,160
He was not dead before.

1032
01:15:26,078 --> 01:15:31,250
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

1033
01:15:32,167 --> 01:15:34,336
You lie.

1034
01:15:36,004 --> 01:15:40,175
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

1035
01:15:40,259 --> 01:15:42,719
My love is no lie.

1036
01:15:43,887 --> 01:15:46,431
I have a wife, yes...

1037
01:15:46,515 --> 01:15:49,852
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1038
01:15:49,852 --> 01:15:54,940
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that...

1039
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:58,026
and yet, you let me come to your bed.

1040
01:15:58,110 --> 01:16:01,363
Calf-love.

1041
01:16:01,446 --> 01:16:05,868
I loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

1042
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:08,704
I was the more deceived.

1043
01:16:08,787 --> 01:16:11,707
Yes, you were deceived...

1044
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:15,169
for I did not know
how much I loved you.

1045
01:16:17,796 --> 01:16:20,883
I love you, Will...

1046
01:16:20,966 --> 01:16:23,051
beyond poetry.

1047
01:16:23,135 --> 01:16:25,637
Oh, my love.

1048
01:16:25,721 --> 01:16:29,808
-You ran from me before.
-When I thought you dead, I did not care...

1049
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:32,144
about all the plays
that would never come...

1050
01:16:32,227 --> 01:16:35,022
only that I would
never see your face.

1051
01:16:35,022 --> 01:16:38,317
I saw our end and it will come.

1052
01:16:38,442 --> 01:16:43,030
-You cannot marry Wessex.
-If not you, why not Wessex?

1053
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:45,699
If not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause...

1054
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:50,370
-and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
-No. No.

1055
01:16:50,454 --> 01:16:54,917
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows...

1056
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:58,086
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

1057
01:16:59,546 --> 01:17:02,883
For killing Juliet’s
kinsman Tybalt...

1058
01:17:02,883 --> 01:17:05,761
the one who killed
Romeo's friend Mercutio...

1059
01:17:05,803 --> 01:17:09,556
Romeo is banished. But the friar
who married Romeo and Juliet...

1060
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:10,599
Is that me?

1061
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:15,562
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1062
01:17:15,562 --> 01:17:19,358
It is a secret potion.
It makes us seeming dead.

1063
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:22,361
She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets.

1064
01:17:22,444 --> 01:17:26,031
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

1065
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:30,452
I have not said all.

1066
01:17:31,537 --> 01:17:37,501
By maligned fate, the message goes astray
which would tell Romeo of the friar's plan.

1067
01:17:37,543 --> 01:17:40,838
He hears only that Juliet is dead.

1068
01:17:41,463 --> 01:17:44,800
-And thus he goes to the apothecary...
-That's me.

1069
01:17:44,842 --> 01:17:47,678
...and buys a deadly poison.

1070
01:17:47,678 --> 01:17:50,472
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet...

1071
01:17:50,472 --> 01:17:52,933
who lies there cold as death.

1072
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:56,103
He drinks the poison.

1073
01:17:56,478 --> 01:17:59,606
He dies by her side...

1074
01:18:00,232 --> 01:18:03,986
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

1075
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:08,615
And so Juliet takes his dagger...

1076
01:18:08,949 --> 01:18:10,534
and then kills herself.

1077
01:18:15,038 --> 01:18:18,167
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

1078
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:21,128
Sad... and wonderful.

1079
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:25,215
I have a blue velvet cap
that'll do well.

1080
01:18:25,215 --> 01:18:30,053
I've seen just such a cap
on an apothecary. Just so.

1081
01:18:31,305 --> 01:18:34,391
Yes, it will serve.

1082
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:38,812
But there's a scene missing.

1083
01:18:39,438 --> 01:18:42,357
Between marriage and death?

1084
01:18:47,988 --> 01:18:52,075
The play...
all written out for you.

1085
01:18:53,619 --> 01:18:56,330
I had the clerk at Bridewell do it.

1086
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:58,749
He has a good fist for lettering.

1087
01:19:00,626 --> 01:19:03,670
There is a new scene.

1088
01:19:08,926 --> 01:19:10,928
Will you read in for me?

1089
01:19:10,969 --> 01:19:14,264
<i>Wilt thou be gone?
It's not yet near day.</i>

1090
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,850
<i>It was the nightingale, and not the lark...</i>

1091
01:19:16,934 --> 01:19:19,603
<i>that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.</i>

1092
01:19:19,603 --> 01:19:25,651
<i>Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</i>

1093
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:29,738
<i>It was the lark,
the herald of the morn...</i>

1094
01:19:29,822 --> 01:19:32,157
<i>no nightingale.</i>

1095
01:19:32,241 --> 01:19:35,244
<i>Look, love,
what envious streaks...</i>

1096
01:19:35,244 --> 01:19:39,373
<i>do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.</i>

1097
01:19:39,456 --> 01:19:43,293
<i>Night's candles are burnt out...</i>

1098
01:19:43,377 --> 01:19:49,258
<i>and jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.</i>

1099
01:19:49,341 --> 01:19:54,054
<i>I must be gone and live,
or stay and die.</i>

1100
01:19:55,556 --> 01:19:59,601
<i>Yon light is not daylight;
I know it, I.</i>

1101
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:02,646
<i>It is some meteor
that the sun exhales...</i>

1102
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:07,401
<i>to be to thee this night a torchbearer...</i>

1103
01:20:07,484 --> 01:20:10,696
<i>to light thee on thy way to Mantua.</i>

1104
01:20:12,364 --> 01:20:18,203
<i>Therefore, stay yet.
Thou needst not to be gone.</i>

1105
01:20:18,328 --> 01:20:23,750
<i>Let me be ta'en,
let me be put to death.</i>

1106
01:20:23,834 --> 01:20:28,130
<i>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.</i>

1107
01:20:28,255 --> 01:20:33,302
<i>I have more care to stay...
than will to go.</i>

1108
01:20:33,385 --> 01:20:38,849
<i>Come, death, and welcome.
Juliet wills it so.</i>

1109
01:21:01,788 --> 01:21:04,875
You will go far, I fear.

1110
01:21:08,837 --> 01:21:11,340
I hope we work together again.

1111
01:21:13,759 --> 01:21:19,306
<i>Such mortal drugs I have,
but Mantua's law is death...</i>

1112
01:21:19,306 --> 01:21:21,683
<i>death to any he that utters them.</i>

1113
01:21:21,934 --> 01:21:24,812
Then him. Then me.

1114
01:21:24,812 --> 01:21:29,149
<i>Put this in any liquid thing you will and...</i>

1115
01:21:29,274 --> 01:21:33,487
What is it? What is it?

1116
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:37,533
<i>How silver sweet sound
lovers" tongues by night.</i>

1117
01:21:37,574 --> 01:21:39,785
<i>-Like soft music...
-Shakespeare!</i>

1118
01:21:56,969 --> 01:21:59,930
Upstart inky pup!

1119
01:22:00,055 --> 01:22:03,016
I'll show you your place,
which is in hell!

1120
01:22:07,354 --> 01:22:10,816
-You're on my ground now!
-By God, I'll fight the lot of you!

1121
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,734
I am more than enough!

1122
01:22:20,409 --> 01:22:22,578
Move!

1123
01:23:44,576 --> 01:23:47,079
Absent friends.

1124
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:51,458
This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

1125
01:23:52,084 --> 01:23:53,335
Will?

1126
01:23:53,377 --> 01:23:57,297
I rejoiced in his death because I thought
it was yours! That is all I know of Marlowe!

1127
01:23:57,297 --> 01:24:00,884
Will? Uh, it's true.

1128
01:24:00,968 --> 01:24:03,762
It was a... tavern brawl.

1129
01:24:03,846 --> 01:24:08,809
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

1130
01:24:08,892 --> 01:24:11,145
A quarrel about the bill.

1131
01:24:11,186 --> 01:24:14,523
The bill?
Oh, vanity, vanity!

1132
01:24:14,565 --> 01:24:17,901
Not the billing,
the bill!

1133
01:24:22,281 --> 01:24:25,617
-Oh, God. I am free of it.
-Where is she?

1134
01:24:27,536 --> 01:24:29,872
-Close it.
-My Lord Wessex.

1135
01:24:29,913 --> 01:24:33,125
The Rose harbors the ass
that shits on my name!

1136
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,419
Take it down stone by stone.

1137
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:39,298
I want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

1138
01:24:39,298 --> 01:24:41,258
Mr. Tilney, what is this?

1139
01:24:41,258 --> 01:24:43,760
Sedition and indecency.

1140
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,472
Master of the Revels, sir.
She's over here.

1141
01:24:46,555 --> 01:24:49,183
-Where, boy?
-There.

1142
01:24:49,266 --> 01:24:51,435
I saw her bubbies.

1143
01:24:51,518 --> 01:24:55,898
So, a woman on the stage!

1144
01:24:55,981 --> 01:25:00,110
A woman!
I say this theater is closed!

1145
01:25:00,194 --> 01:25:01,653
Why, sir?

1146
01:25:01,737 --> 01:25:05,866
For lewdness and unashamed faced ness!

1147
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:10,829
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

1148
01:25:25,928 --> 01:25:27,971
Not him, her!

1149
01:25:31,725 --> 01:25:33,560
That's who I meant.

1150
01:25:35,646 --> 01:25:39,149
-He's a woman.
-This theater is closed.

1151
01:25:41,068 --> 01:25:44,488
Notice will be posted!

1152
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:47,533
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

1153
01:25:47,616 --> 01:25:50,494
-Nobody knew.
-He did.

1154
01:25:50,577 --> 01:25:53,580
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

1155
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:58,168
It is over.

1156
01:25:58,877 --> 01:26:02,005
I'm sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1157
01:26:16,395 --> 01:26:18,730
I wanted to be an actor.

1158
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:22,234
I'm so sorry, Will.

1159
01:26:27,948 --> 01:26:31,034
You were... w-w...

1160
01:26:32,286 --> 01:26:34,496
w-wonderful.

1161
01:26:36,123 --> 01:26:38,333
Thank you.

1162
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:51,221
<i>Put this in any liquid thing you will
and...</i>

1163
01:26:57,644 --> 01:27:00,189
Everything all right?

1164
01:27:37,309 --> 01:27:40,020
I would've been good.

1165
01:27:40,979 --> 01:27:44,024
-I would've been great.
-So would I.

1166
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:46,527
We both would.

1167
01:28:08,799 --> 01:28:11,260
Lambert, kill him.

1168
01:28:12,594 --> 01:28:14,888
That can wait.

1169
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:24,398
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1170
01:28:25,399 --> 01:28:27,609
But my father, James Burbage...

1171
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:32,072
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty...

1172
01:28:32,156 --> 01:28:36,869
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

1173
01:28:36,952 --> 01:28:40,455
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

1174
01:28:40,539 --> 01:28:43,208
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1175
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:48,505
I have a theater.
The "Curtain" is yours.

1176
01:29:21,872 --> 01:29:25,417
Will!
We'll be needing a Romeo.

1177
01:29:32,132 --> 01:29:34,259
Oranges! Sweet oranges!

1178
01:30:02,037 --> 01:30:03,997
My ship is moored at bank side...

1179
01:30:03,997 --> 01:30:07,000
bound for Virginia
on the afternoon tide.

1180
01:30:07,042 --> 01:30:10,420
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.
You are gaining a colony.

1181
01:30:10,504 --> 01:30:15,926
And you, my lord, are gaining 5,000 pounds
by these drafts in my hand.

1182
01:30:16,009 --> 01:30:18,762
Would you oblige me with 50 or so in gold...

1183
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:21,932
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside?

1184
01:30:23,225 --> 01:30:26,103
Ah, the bride!

1185
01:30:27,354 --> 01:30:30,274
Good morning, my lord.

1186
01:30:30,357 --> 01:30:34,820
I see you are... open for business,
so let's to church.

1187
01:30:40,409 --> 01:30:41,451
Be gone!

1188
01:31:39,843 --> 01:31:41,762
Oh, my lord!

1189
01:31:41,845 --> 01:31:44,431
-Be good to her, my lord.
-I will.

1190
01:31:44,515 --> 01:31:46,600
Oh, God bless you!

1191
01:31:46,683 --> 01:31:49,520
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There's a good nurse.

1192
01:31:49,603 --> 01:31:51,563
The tide will not wait!

1193
01:31:51,647 --> 01:31:55,526
Farewell!
You'll all be welcome in Virginia!

1194
01:32:22,052 --> 01:32:26,723
Candy apples!

1195
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:30,352
Buy my apples!

1196
01:32:34,857 --> 01:32:37,067
Thank you, sir.
Apples!

1197
01:32:44,575 --> 01:32:47,953
Is this, uh...
Is this all right?

1198
01:32:48,036 --> 01:32:49,955
Yeah.

1199
01:33:05,262 --> 01:33:09,558
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

1200
01:33:09,683 --> 01:33:14,229
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show!

1201
01:33:14,313 --> 01:33:19,276
This is the very business of show!

1202
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:32,956
T- T- T- Two...

1203
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,667
T- T- T- T... T... T...

1204
01:33:35,751 --> 01:33:39,421
T... T- T- Two households...

1205
01:33:39,505 --> 01:33:42,424
-We've lost.
-No, it will turn out well.

1206
01:33:42,549 --> 01:33:45,969
-How will it?
-I don't know. It's a mystery.

1207
01:33:48,514 --> 01:33:52,017
T- T... T... T- T...

1208
01:33:52,142 --> 01:33:54,478
T... T...

1209
01:34:45,779 --> 01:34:48,323
Two households...

1210
01:34:48,407 --> 01:34:51,535
both alike in dignity...

1211
01:34:51,618 --> 01:34:54,371
in fair Verona...

1212
01:34:54,454 --> 01:34:57,040
where we lay our scene.

1213
01:34:57,124 --> 01:35:00,210
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny...

1214
01:35:00,252 --> 01:35:03,672
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

1215
01:35:03,714 --> 01:35:06,758
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

1216
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,970
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

1217
01:35:10,012 --> 01:35:12,806
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

1218
01:35:12,848 --> 01:35:16,310
doth with their death
bury their parents" strife.

1219
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:22,566
...the which of you
with patient ears attend...

1220
01:35:22,649 --> 01:35:27,404
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

1221
01:35:33,744 --> 01:35:35,746
-Wonderful.
-Was it...

1222
01:35:36,872 --> 01:35:38,916
good?

1223
01:35:41,668 --> 01:35:44,838
<i>Gregory, on my word
we'll not carry coals.</i>

1224
01:35:44,922 --> 01:35:47,966
<i>No, for then
we should be colliers.</i>

1225
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:50,552
<i>I mean, and we be
in choler we'll draw.</i>

1226
01:35:50,636 --> 01:35:53,722
-Master Shakespeare.
-Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

1227
01:35:53,806 --> 01:35:57,017
It's not my fault.
I could do it yesterday.

1228
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:59,520
Do me a speech. Do me a line.

1229
01:35:59,603 --> 01:36:03,440
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow.</i>

1230
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:06,777
-Another little problem.
-What do we do now?

1231
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:10,781
-The show must... You know.
-Go on!

1232
01:36:10,864 --> 01:36:14,284
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

1233
01:36:14,368 --> 01:36:16,787
-How will it?
-I don't know. It's a mystery.

1234
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:19,164
<i>-Fear me not.
-No, marry, I fear thee!</i>

1235
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:24,461
<i>-Let them begin.
-I will frown as I pass by.</i>

1236
01:36:24,545 --> 01:36:28,340
<i>-Let them take it as they list!
-Nay, as they dare.</i>

1237
01:36:28,423 --> 01:36:32,469
<i>I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.</i>

1238
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:35,472
<i>Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?</i>

1239
01:36:35,556 --> 01:36:38,851
<i>-I do bite my thumb, sir.
-Excuse me. Thank you.</i>

1240
01:36:38,934 --> 01:36:42,563
<i>-Thank you. Excuse me.
-Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</i>

1241
01:36:42,646 --> 01:36:44,481
-Can we talk?
-Shh!

1242
01:36:44,523 --> 01:36:47,359
-We have no Juliet.
-No Juliet?

1243
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:50,320
-No Juliet?
-It'll be all right, madam.

1244
01:36:50,362 --> 01:36:52,698
-What happened to Sam?
-Who are you?

1245
01:36:52,739 --> 01:36:54,616
Thomas Kent.

1246
01:36:55,033 --> 01:36:57,119
Do you know it?

1247
01:36:58,412 --> 01:37:00,497
Every word.

1248
01:37:10,007 --> 01:37:13,010
<i>I'll go along,
no such sight to be shown...</i>

1249
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:16,221
<i>but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.</i>

1250
01:37:16,305 --> 01:37:18,599
<i>Nurse!</i>

1251
01:37:20,976 --> 01:37:24,229
<i>Where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.</i>

1252
01:37:24,313 --> 01:37:27,524
<i>Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old...</i>

1253
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:29,526
<i>I bade her come.</i>

1254
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:31,695
How now, who calls?

1255
01:37:31,778 --> 01:37:34,531
<i>What, ladybird!</i>

1256
01:37:34,615 --> 01:37:36,366
<i>God forbid!
Where's this girl?</i>

1257
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:39,077
<i>What, lamb!</i>

1258
01:37:39,161 --> 01:37:41,371
<i>What, ladybird!</i>

1259
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:44,875
<i>What, Juliet!</i>

1260
01:37:46,001 --> 01:37:49,379
<i>How now, who calls?</i>

1261
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:56,929
-We'll all be put in the Clink.
-See you in jail.

1262
01:38:00,057 --> 01:38:03,227
<i>Your mother...
Your mother.</i>

1263
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:06,605
<i>Madam, I am here.
What is your will?</i>

1264
01:38:06,688 --> 01:38:08,732
<i>This is the matter.</i>

1265
01:38:08,816 --> 01:38:11,235
<i>Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.</i>

1266
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:16,073
<i>Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.</i>

1267
01:38:16,156 --> 01:38:19,493
<i>Thou knowest my daughter’s
of a pretty age.</i>

1268
01:38:19,576 --> 01:38:23,080
<i>-Faith, I know her age unto an hour.
-She's not 14.</i>

1269
01:38:23,163 --> 01:38:28,669
<i>Oh, I'll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken...</i>

1270
01:38:28,752 --> 01:38:31,505
<i>I have but 4.</i>

1271
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:55,737
<i>Tell me, daughter Juliet...</i>

1272
01:38:55,821 --> 01:39:00,409
<i>how stands your dispositions
to be married?</i>

1273
01:39:00,492 --> 01:39:03,620
<i>It is an honor
that I dream not of.</i>

1274
01:39:07,916 --> 01:39:10,794
<i>Hold, Tybalt!
Good Mercutio!</i>

1275
01:39:20,095 --> 01:39:21,763
<i>I'm sped.</i>

1276
01:39:21,847 --> 01:39:24,641
<i>Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.</i>

1277
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:30,022
<i>Ask for me tomorrow,
you shall find me a grave man.</i>

1278
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:38,280
<i>Yes!</i>

1279
01:39:45,746 --> 01:39:46,788
<i>Yah!</i>

1280
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:50,334
<i>Such mortal drugs I have...</i>

1281
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:55,047
<i>but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.</i>

1282
01:39:55,172 --> 01:39:57,674
Then him. Then me.

1283
01:40:06,183 --> 01:40:08,227
<i>Romeo, away, be gone!</i>

1284
01:40:08,352 --> 01:40:12,731
<i>The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed!</i>

1285
01:40:12,856 --> 01:40:17,069
<i>The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away!</i>

1286
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,614
<i>Oh, I am Fortune's fool!</i>

1287
01:40:20,739 --> 01:40:22,616
<i>Why dost thou stay?</i>

1288
01:40:22,741 --> 01:40:24,701
<i>Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?</i>

1289
01:40:24,827 --> 01:40:26,995
<i>That murderer, which way ran he?</i>

1290
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,873
<i>-There lies that Tybalt.
-Up, sir. Go with me.</i>

1291
01:40:29,998 --> 01:40:32,000
<i>I charge thee
in the Prince's name obey.</i>

1292
01:40:32,125 --> 01:40:34,795
<i>Where are the vile beginners
of this fray?</i>

1293
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,130
<i>Oh, I am Fortune's fool.</i>

1294
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:41,885
<i>You are married?</i>

1295
01:40:45,556 --> 01:40:50,561
<i>If you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed.</i>

1296
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:08,537
<i>Art thou gone so...</i>

1297
01:41:11,165 --> 01:41:13,292
<i>love, lord...</i>

1298
01:41:13,375 --> 01:41:15,586
<i>aye, husband, friend?</i>

1299
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:20,424
<i>I must hear from thee
every day in the hour...</i>

1300
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:23,427
<i>for in a minute
there are many days.</i>

1301
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:27,097
<i>Oh, by this count
I shall be much in years ere again...</i>

1302
01:41:27,181 --> 01:41:29,600
<i>I behold my Romeo.</i>

1303
01:41:30,184 --> 01:41:31,602
<i>Farewell.</i>

1304
01:41:33,103 --> 01:41:36,648
<i>Oh, thinks thou we shall ever meet again?</i>

1305
01:41:38,066 --> 01:41:41,111
<i>Methinks I see thee,
now thou art so low...</i>

1306
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:44,656
<i>as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.</i>

1307
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:48,911
<i>Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look'st pale.</i>

1308
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:52,581
<i>Then trust me, love...</i>

1309
01:41:52,664 --> 01:41:55,000
<i>in my eyes, so do you.</i>

1310
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:58,837
<i>Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.</i>

1311
01:41:58,921 --> 01:42:00,839
<i>Adieu.</i>

1312
01:42:02,341 --> 01:42:04,968
<i>Adieu.</i>

1313
01:42:05,052 --> 01:42:07,805
<i>Take thou this vial,
being then in bed...</i>

1314
01:42:07,888 --> 01:42:10,974
<i>and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.</i>

1315
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:15,020
<i>No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.</i>

1316
01:42:15,103 --> 01:42:18,065
<i>And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...</i>

1317
01:42:18,148 --> 01:42:21,360
<i>thou shalt continue
2 and 40 hours...</i>

1318
01:42:21,443 --> 01:42:25,072
<i>and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.</i>

1319
01:42:25,155 --> 01:42:27,241
<i>What ho! Apothecary!</i>

1320
01:42:30,744 --> 01:42:34,373
<i>Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.</i>

1321
01:42:34,456 --> 01:42:37,376
<i>Hold, there is 40 ducats.</i>

1322
01:42:37,459 --> 01:42:41,213
<i>-Let me have a dram of poison...
-Such mortal drugs I have...</i>

1323
01:42:41,296 --> 01:42:45,342
<i>but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.</i>

1324
01:42:45,425 --> 01:42:48,929
<i>-Art thou so...
-My poverty, but not my will, consents.</i>

1325
01:42:54,768 --> 01:42:57,896
<i>I pay thy poverty
and not thy will.</i>

1326
01:43:01,692 --> 01:43:03,861
<i>Eyes, look your last.</i>

1327
01:43:03,944 --> 01:43:06,697
<i>Arms, take your last embrace.</i>

1328
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:12,661
<i>And, lips,
oh, you, the doors of breath...</i>

1329
01:43:12,744 --> 01:43:15,164
<i>seal with a righteous kiss...</i>

1330
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:21,712
<i>the dateless bargain
to engrossing death.</i>

1331
01:43:23,005 --> 01:43:29,219
<i>Come, bitter conduct.
Come, unsavoury guide.</i>

1332
01:43:29,303 --> 01:43:33,015
<i>Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...</i>

1333
01:43:33,098 --> 01:43:37,895
<i>run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.</i>

1334
01:43:37,978 --> 01:43:40,397
<i>Here's to my love!</i>

1335
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:51,492
<i>Oh... true apothecary!</i>

1336
01:43:55,496 --> 01:43:57,748
<i>Thy drugs are quick.</i>

1337
01:44:02,544 --> 01:44:05,130
<i>Thus with a kiss...</i>

1338
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:09,927
<i>I die.</i>

1339
01:44:27,653 --> 01:44:29,738
<i>Where is my lord?</i>

1340
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:35,619
<i>I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?</i>

1341
01:44:35,702 --> 01:44:36,995
Dead!

1342
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:52,427
<i>What's this?</i>

1343
01:44:52,511 --> 01:44:56,223
<i>A cup, closed
in my true love's hand?</i>

1344
01:44:57,933 --> 01:45:01,603
<i>Poison, I see,hath been
his timeless end.</i>

1345
01:45:07,276 --> 01:45:11,864
<i>Oh, happy dagger,
this is thy sheath.</i>

1346
01:45:14,825 --> 01:45:17,202
<i>There rust...</i>

1347
01:45:18,662 --> 01:45:20,873
<i>and let me die.</i>

1348
01:45:27,796 --> 01:45:31,383
<i>A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.</i>

1349
01:45:31,466 --> 01:45:35,888
<i>The sun for sorrow
will not show his head.</i>

1350
01:45:35,971 --> 01:45:40,934
<i>Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.</i>

1351
01:45:41,059 --> 01:45:43,270
<i>Some shall be pardoned...</i>

1352
01:45:43,395 --> 01:45:46,398
<i>and some punished.</i>

1353
01:45:46,482 --> 01:45:50,611
<i>For never was a story
of more woe...</i>

1354
01:45:50,694 --> 01:45:54,281
<i>than this of Juliet...</i>

1355
01:45:54,406 --> 01:45:56,617
<i>and her Romeo.</i>

1356
01:46:23,769 --> 01:46:26,605
Bravo!

1357
01:46:30,359 --> 01:46:32,319
-Yea! Yea!
-Yea!

1358
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:21,410
-Bravo!
-Yea! Bravo!

1359
01:47:35,883 --> 01:47:40,304
-God save the queen!
-I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth!

1360
01:47:40,387 --> 01:47:44,391
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

1361
01:47:44,475 --> 01:47:46,226
Everyone!

1362
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:49,646
Admiral's Men,
the Chamberlain's Men...

1363
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:54,067
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

1364
01:47:54,151 --> 01:47:57,529
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

1365
01:47:57,613 --> 01:48:01,658
Contempt? You closed the "Rose".
I have not opened it.

1366
01:48:01,742 --> 01:48:04,444
That woman is a woman!

1367
01:48:05,328 --> 01:48:06,413
What?

1368
01:48:06,497 --> 01:48:09,708
A woman?
You mean that goat?

1369
01:48:09,791 --> 01:48:15,214
I'll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

1370
01:48:15,297 --> 01:48:18,634
Mr. Tilney!

1371
01:48:23,847 --> 01:48:27,601
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

1372
01:48:35,442 --> 01:48:38,237
The queen of England
does not attend...

1373
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,364
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1374
01:48:40,447 --> 01:48:43,450
So something is out of joint.

1375
01:48:45,369 --> 01:48:49,039
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

1376
01:49:03,846 --> 01:49:06,765
Yes, the illusion is remarkable.

1377
01:49:06,849 --> 01:49:09,560
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

1378
01:49:10,894 --> 01:49:14,898
But I know something of
a woman in a man's profession.

1379
01:49:14,982 --> 01:49:17,943
Yes, by God,
I do know about that.

1380
01:49:19,695 --> 01:49:22,614
That is enough from you, Master Kent.

1381
01:49:27,452 --> 01:49:29,705
If only Lord Wessex were here.

1382
01:49:29,788 --> 01:49:31,832
He is, ma'am.

1383
01:49:34,751 --> 01:49:37,963
Y-Your Majesty.

1384
01:49:39,214 --> 01:49:42,217
There was a wager I remember...

1385
01:49:42,301 --> 01:49:47,139
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

1386
01:49:47,222 --> 01:49:49,808
I think you lost it today.

1387
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:58,400
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

1388
01:49:58,484 --> 01:50:01,403
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

1389
01:50:08,076 --> 01:50:10,496
Master Shakespeare.

1390
01:50:13,081 --> 01:50:16,084
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself...

1391
01:50:16,168 --> 01:50:19,296
and we will speak some more.

1392
01:50:36,772 --> 01:50:39,024
Your Majesty.

1393
01:50:40,442 --> 01:50:45,030
Why, Lord Wessex.
Lost your wife so soon?

1394
01:50:45,113 --> 01:50:47,866
Indeed I am a bride short...

1395
01:50:47,950 --> 01:50:52,663
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

1396
01:50:53,038 --> 01:50:55,332
How is this to end?

1397
01:50:55,374 --> 01:51:00,629
As stories must when love's denied,
with tears and a journey.

1398
01:51:01,588 --> 01:51:07,469
Those whom God has joined in marriage
not even I can put asunder.

1399
01:51:07,678 --> 01:51:09,346
Master Kent.

1400
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:19,815
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1401
01:51:20,983 --> 01:51:24,778
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

1402
01:51:24,862 --> 01:51:27,322
It's time to settle accounts.

1403
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:33,537
-How much was that wager?
-50 shillings.

1404
01:51:34,872 --> 01:51:36,123
Pounds.

1405
01:51:37,499 --> 01:51:41,962
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

1406
01:51:49,553 --> 01:51:53,474
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

1407
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:56,435
for "Twelfth Night".

1408
01:52:13,410 --> 01:52:15,913
Too late.
Too late.

1409
01:52:25,797 --> 01:52:27,883
My Lady Wessex.

1410
01:52:43,023 --> 01:52:46,026
A hired player no longer.

1411
01:52:46,151 --> 01:52:51,323
50 pounds, Will,
for the poet of true love.

1412
01:52:52,491 --> 01:52:54,868
I'm done with theater.

1413
01:52:56,203 --> 01:53:01,291
The playhouse is for dreamers.
Look what the dream brought us.

1414
01:53:02,459 --> 01:53:05,045
It was we ourselves did that.

1415
01:53:06,463 --> 01:53:10,676
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

1416
01:53:10,801 --> 01:53:14,930
I have hurt you, and I'm sorry for it.

1417
01:53:15,055 --> 01:53:19,101
If my hurt is to be
that you write no more...

1418
01:53:19,184 --> 01:53:21,562
then I shall be the sorrier.

1419
01:53:27,151 --> 01:53:29,695
The queen commands
a comedy, Will...

1420
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:34,908
-for "Twelfth Night".
-A comedy.

1421
01:53:35,033 --> 01:53:37,035
What would my hero be?

1422
01:53:37,077 --> 01:53:40,998
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

1423
01:53:42,791 --> 01:53:46,253
It's a beginning.

1424
01:53:46,336 --> 01:53:50,424
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine...

1425
01:53:50,507 --> 01:53:53,844
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

1426
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:59,892
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

1427
01:53:59,975 --> 01:54:02,853
A storm.
All are lost.

1428
01:54:02,936 --> 01:54:06,398
She lands... on a...

1429
01:54:06,482 --> 01:54:09,485
vast and empty shore.

1430
01:54:10,944 --> 01:54:12,988
She's brought to the duke...

1431
01:54:14,406 --> 01:54:17,451
-Orsino.
-Orsino?

1432
01:54:18,577 --> 01:54:20,496
Good name.

1433
01:54:20,579 --> 01:54:26,543
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1434
01:54:26,585 --> 01:54:29,922
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

1435
01:54:31,089 --> 01:54:33,300
But all ends well.

1436
01:54:33,383 --> 01:54:35,594
How does it?

1437
01:54:36,386 --> 01:54:37,805
I don't know.

1438
01:54:39,389 --> 01:54:42,184
It's a mystery.

1439
01:54:49,107 --> 01:54:51,777
You will never age for me...

1440
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:55,405
nor fade, nor die.

1441
01:54:56,448 --> 01:54:58,534
Nor you for me.

1442
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:02,454
Good-bye, my love.

1443
01:55:03,372 --> 01:55:05,666
A thousand times good-bye.

1444
01:55:10,838 --> 01:55:13,131
Write me well.

1445
01:55:44,913 --> 01:55:48,542
My story starts at sea...

1446
01:55:48,625 --> 01:55:52,546
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

1447
01:55:53,255 --> 01:55:55,549
A shipwreck.

1448
01:55:58,218 --> 01:56:02,014
The wild waters roar and heave.

1449
01:56:03,223 --> 01:56:06,477
The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces...

1450
01:56:09,229 --> 01:56:13,108
and all the helpless souls within her...

1451
01:56:13,192 --> 01:56:15,277
drowned.

1452
01:56:18,155 --> 01:56:21,450
All save one:

1453
01:56:21,533 --> 01:56:23,619
a lady...

1454
01:56:25,078 --> 01:56:28,165
whose soul is greater
than the ocean...

1455
01:56:29,416 --> 01:56:34,338
and her spirit stronger
than the sea's embrace.

1456
01:56:36,006 --> 01:56:39,134
Not for her a watery end...

1457
01:56:40,677 --> 01:56:45,474
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

1458
01:56:48,936 --> 01:56:51,438
It will be a love story,

1459
01:56:55,567 --> 01:56:59,780
for she will be my heroine for all time.

1460
01:57:02,616 --> 01:57:06,161
And her name will be Viola.
