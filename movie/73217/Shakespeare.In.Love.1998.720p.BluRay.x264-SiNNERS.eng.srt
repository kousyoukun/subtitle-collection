1
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:59,255
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn't pay his debts?

2
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:01,465
His boots catch fire!

3
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:05,636
Why do you how!...

4
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,347
when it is I who am bitten?

5
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,350
- What am I, Mr. Lambert?
- Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

6
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:13,352
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

7
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:16,355
Twelve pounds, one schilling and fourpence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

8
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,316
- Aaah! I can pay you!
- When?

9
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:21,610
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
Oh, for pity's sake!

10
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:23,863
Take them out.

11
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:25,865
Where will you find...

12
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,867
Sixteen pounds,
five schillings and ninepence.

13
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,869
Including interest,
in three weeks?

14
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:32,663
- I have a wonderful new play.
- Put them back in.

15
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:34,665
- It's a comedy!
- Cut off his nose.

16
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:37,293
It's a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

17
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,297
- And his ears.
- And a share!

18
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,341
We will be partners,
Mr. Fennyman!

19
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:46,927
Partners?

20
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:53,225
It's a crowd-tickler.

21
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:56,812
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

22
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,732
- A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
- I think I've seen it.

23
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:01,567
I didn't like it.

24
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:05,363
- But this time it is by Shakespeare.
- What's it called?

25
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:08,240
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

26
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:10,409
Good title.

27
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:13,829
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

28
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:16,332
Let's say we open
in two weeks.

29
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:18,834
That's, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

30
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:22,546
In addition, 400 backsides at
threepence, a penny extra for cushions.

31
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,590
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

32
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:28,427
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees?

33
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:31,639
- Twenty pounds
to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
- Correct.

34
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:34,767
- But I have to pay
the actors and the author.
- Share of the profits.

35
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,269
- There's never any--
- Of course not.

36
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:41,691
Oh-- Oh, Mr. Fennyman, I think you
might have hit upon something.

37
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:44,276
Sign there.

38
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:51,784
So, Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

39
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,786
Almost finished?

40
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:57,373
Oh, without doubt he's completing it
at this very moment.

41
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:58,559
Will. Will!

42
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:01,020
Where is my play?

43
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:04,357
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

44
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,860
Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.

45
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:10,696
No, no, we haven't the time.
Talk prose.

46
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,698
Where is my play?

47
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:15,326
- It is all locked safe in here.
- God be praised.

48
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:17,286
Locked?

49
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,706
- As soon as I find my muse.
- Who is she this time?

50
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,708
She is always Aphrodite.

51
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,544
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet?

52
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:28,714
Henslowe, you have no soul,

53
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:32,468
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

54
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:34,470
Ow! Will!

55
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:37,473
I am a dead man,
and buggered to boot.

56
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:39,976
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

57
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:42,979
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

58
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:45,982
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain's
Men are invited to court...

59
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:48,985
and receive ten pounds
to play your piece,

60
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:51,988
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

61
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:53,990
when you were green
and grateful.

62
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:56,993
- What piece? Richard Crookback?
- No! It's comedy they want.

63
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,995
Like Romeo and Ethel.

64
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,998
- Who wrote that?
- Nobody. You were writing it for me.

65
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:05,001
- I gave you three pound a month since.
- Half what you owe me.

66
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:07,420
I'm still due for
One Gentleman of Verona.

67
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:10,923
What is money to you and me?
l, your patron, you, my wordwright.

68
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:12,925
When the plague lifts,

69
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,928
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain.

70
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:17,930
- I will have nothing for the Rose.
- Mr. Henslowe.

71
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:19,932
- Will you lend me 50 pounds?
- Fifty pounds?

72
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:22,935
- What for?
- Burbage offers me a partnership
in the Chamberlain's Men.

73
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:25,771
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

74
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:29,900
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

75
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:31,902
No, then?

76
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:34,947
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

77
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:39,577
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

78
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,248
And the Rose smells
thusly rank by any name!

79
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:48,961
I say, a plague
on both their houses!

80
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:50,963
Where are you going?

81
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:53,132
My weekly confession.

82
00:06:58,304 --> 00:07:01,223
Words, words, words.

83
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:03,726
Once, I had the gift.

84
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:07,730
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

85
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,732
Love that overthrows empires.

86
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:13,235
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

87
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,239
For sixpence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

88
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:20,743
-But now--
-And yet you tell me you lie with women.

89
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,164
Black Sue,
Fat Phoebe,

90
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:29,293
Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind--

91
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:32,171
Yes, now and again.
What of it?

92
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:33,839
I have lost my gift.

93
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:36,342
I am here to help you.

94
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,844
Tell me,
in your own words.

95
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:46,477
I-lt's as if
my quill is broken,

96
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,481
as if the organ
of my imagination has dried up,

97
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:54,110
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

98
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:56,028
- Interesting.
- Nothing comes.

99
00:07:56,112 --> 00:07:57,989
Most interesting.

100
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:00,825
It's like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

101
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:06,539
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

102
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,711
How long has it been?

103
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,881
A goodly length in times past,
but lately--

104
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:19,385
No, no.
You have a wife, children?

105
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:24,223
Aye.

106
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:27,268
I was a lad of 18.

107
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:29,770
Anne Hathaway was a woman
half as old again.

108
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:32,898
- A woman of property?
- She had a cottage.

109
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:37,737
- One day she was three months
gone with child, so--
- And your relations?

110
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,490
- On my mother's side, the Ardens.
- No, your marriage bed.

111
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:45,161
Four years and a hundred miles away
in Stratford.

112
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:49,040
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

113
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:51,042
Banishment was a blessing.

114
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,712
- So, now you are free to love--
- Yet cannot love, nor write it.

115
00:08:57,423 --> 00:09:01,260
Here is a-- a bangle...

116
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:04,847
found in Psyche's temple
on Olympus.

117
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,224
Cheap at fourpence.

118
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:12,229
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

119
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:14,231
Will it restore my gift?

120
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:17,735
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

121
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:21,030
Words will flow like a river.

122
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:23,032
See you next week.

123
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:27,536
- Now where?
- To the palace at Whitehall.

124
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:31,040
All right.

125
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:34,543
Hello, Will.

126
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:37,672
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

127
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:41,550
- You too, good Crab.
- Crab's nervous.
He's never played the palace.

128
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:44,053
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will?

129
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:47,473
- I could do it.
- No, they would laugh at Seneca
if you played it.

130
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:50,810
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

131
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:53,813
- How goes it, Will?
- I'm still owed money
for this play, Burbage.

132
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:56,315
Not by me.
I only stole it.

133
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,818
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

134
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:01,320
Where were
my seamstress' eyes?

135
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:05,282
- When are you coming over
to the Chamberlain's Men?
- When I have 50 pounds.

136
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:08,911
- You writing?
- A comedy. All but done.

137
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:10,913
A pirate comedy.

138
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:13,332
- Wonderful.
- Bring it tomorrow.

139
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:17,128
- It's for Henslowe.
He paid me. Ten pounds.
- You're a liar.

140
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:21,924
- He wants Romeo for Ned
and the Admiral's Men.
- Mmm. Ned's wrong for it.

141
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:24,468
Will?

142
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:28,472
- Here's two sovereigns. I'll give you
another two when I see the pages.
- Done.

143
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:30,474
Burbage, I will see you
hanged for a pickpocket.

144
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:32,977
The queen has commanded it.
She loves a comedy.

145
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,646
And the Master of the Revels
favors us.

146
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,649
And what favor does Mr. Tilney
receive from you?

147
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,651
- Ask him.
- She comes!

148
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:09,388
Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.

149
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,682
Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,

150
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,560
were it not affection
chains thy tender days...

151
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:20,024
When will you write me
a sonnet, Will?

152
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:23,569
- I've lost my gift.
- You left it in my bed.

153
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:25,571
Come to look for it again.

154
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:35,414
Are you to be my muse,
Rosaline?

155
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:38,584
Burbage has my keeping,

156
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:40,586
but you have my heart.

157
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:45,257
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

158
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:47,259
Will Shakespeare has a play.

159
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:49,762
Let's go and cough through it.

160
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:54,767
My father weeping; my mother wailing;

161
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,605
our maid howling;
our cat wringing her hands.

162
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:03,067
Yet did not this coldhearted cur...

163
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,070
shed one tear--

164
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,918
You see? Comedy.

165
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:24,964
Love, and a bit with a dog.

166
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:27,133
That's what they want.

167
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:39,061
He is a stone, a very pebble stone,

168
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:43,149
and has no more pity in him
than a dog!

169
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:46,152
A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.

170
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:51,115
Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word--

171
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,701
Well played, Master Crab!

172
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:57,830
I commend you!

173
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,461
What light is light...

174
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:05,463
if Silvia be not seen?

175
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,175
What joy is joy...

176
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:11,510
if Silvia be not by?

177
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:14,513
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

178
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:18,517
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

179
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:23,022
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

180
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:26,567
there is no music
in the nightingale.

181
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,570
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

182
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:33,074
there is no day for me
to look upon.

183
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,976
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best?

184
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,979
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

185
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,481
Oh, I liked the dog
for laughs.

186
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:07,984
Silvia, I did not care for much.

187
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:09,986
His fingers were red
from fighting...

188
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:13,322
and he spoke like
a schoolboy at lessons.

189
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:16,325
Stage love will never be true love...

190
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:21,455
while the law of the land
has our heroines being played
by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

191
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,625
- Oh, when can we see another?
- When the queen commands it.

192
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,627
No, but at the playhouse.
Nurse!

193
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:30,506
Be still.
Playhouses are not for wellborn ladies.

194
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:32,842
Oh! I'm not so wellborn.

195
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:35,344
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

196
00:14:35,428 --> 00:14:37,847
and well-married
is more so.

197
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,349
Lord Wessex
was looking at you tonight.

198
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,852
All the men at court
are without poetry.

199
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:45,855
If they see me, they see
my father's fortune.

200
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:49,525
I will have poetry
in my life,

201
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:51,527
and adventure.

202
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:55,323
And love.
Love above all.

203
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,325
Like Valentine
and Silvia?

204
00:14:57,408 --> 00:15:01,287
No, not the artful postures
of love,

205
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,374
but love that overthrows life.

206
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,128
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart,

207
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:13,549
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

208
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:17,303
Love as there has never been
in a play.

209
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:21,307
I will have love,
or I will end my days as--

210
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,309
As a nurse?

211
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,189
Oh, but I would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

212
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:32,318
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

213
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:36,614
I would stay asleep
my whole life...

214
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:40,618
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

215
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:43,621
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

216
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:49,168
Now spit.

217
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:15,987
This time the boots
are coming off.

218
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,448
- What have I done?
- The theaters have all been
closed down by the plague.

219
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:22,451
- Oh, that.
- By order of the Master of the Revels.

220
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:26,872
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

221
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:30,960
The natural condition is one
of insurmountable obstacles on
the road to imminent disaster.

222
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:33,713
- So what do we do?
- Nothing.

223
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:37,466
- Strangely enough,
it all turns out well.
- How?

224
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:40,469
I don't know.
It's a mystery.

225
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,471
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

226
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:44,473
The theaters are reopened...

227
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:48,227
by order of
the Master of the Revels!

228
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:51,480
The theaters are reopened!

229
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:53,482
Mr. Fennyman.

230
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,985
Mr. Tilney has reopened
the playhouses.

231
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:58,362
If you wouldn't mind.

232
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:02,992
Where's the play?

233
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,911
Oh, it's coming.
It's coming.

234
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:10,499
It's coming.

235
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:23,596
Will!

236
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,598
Will, I have wonderful news.

237
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,600
So have l.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

238
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,602
God, I'm good!

239
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:32,605
Rosaline?
You mean Ethel.

240
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,779
Richard?

241
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:43,115
Burbage!

242
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:51,540
Mr. Tilney.

243
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:55,294
Like you,
I found him not at home.

244
00:17:57,213 --> 00:18:00,091
I would've made you immortal.

245
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:06,472
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

246
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:09,225
What does Burbage care of that?

247
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:13,062
He's readying the Curtain
for Kit Marlowe.

248
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:16,399
- You've opened the playhouses?
- I have, Master Shakespeare.

249
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:19,485
- But the plague--
- Yes, I know.

250
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:22,488
But he was always
hanging around the house.

251
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,006
The special today is a pig's
foot marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

252
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:42,967
- served on a buckwheat pancake--
- Will!

253
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,844
Have you finished?

254
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:46,846
Yes, nearly.

255
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,141
- Good morning, Master Nol.
You will have a nice part.
- Yes!

256
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:54,270
- We'll need Ralph for the pirate king.
- Clear that bloody table!

257
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:58,441
None other than the Admiral's Men
are out on tour.

258
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:00,735
I need actors!

259
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:04,739
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

260
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:08,909
- What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
- It won't cost you a penny!

261
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,912
Auditions in half an hour!

262
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:19,253
Ralph Bagswell,
I'd have a part for you,

263
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:22,173
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard's drunkard.

264
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:24,175
Never when I'm working.

265
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:27,053
Never when I'm working!

266
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:30,348
Get me to drink mandragora.

267
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,350
Straight up, Will?

268
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:35,436
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

269
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,730
Kit.

270
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:41,359
- How goes it, Will?
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

271
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:45,071
- Burbage says you have a play.
- I have, and the chinks to show for it.

272
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:47,907
I insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

273
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,910
I hear you have a new play
for the Curtain.

274
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:53,079
Not new.
My Doctor Faustus.

275
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:55,623
Ah.
I love your early work.

276
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:58,626
"Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

277
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:01,253
and burnt the topless towers
of llium?"

278
00:20:01,337 --> 00:20:04,256
I have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

279
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,258
The Massacre at Paris.

280
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:11,138
- Whew. Good title.
- Mmm. Yours?

281
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:13,641
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

282
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:17,645
Yes, I know. I know.

283
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:19,647
What is the story?

284
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,483
Well, there's this pirate--

285
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:27,488
In truth, I have not written a word.

286
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,117
Romeo.

287
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,286
Romeo is ltalian,

288
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,622
always in and out of love.

289
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:38,916
Yes, that's good.
Until he meets--

290
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,335
- Ethel.
- Do you think?

291
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:43,879
- The daughter of his enemy.
- The daughter of his enemy.

292
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:46,173
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

293
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:49,760
by Ethel's brother, or something--
His name is Mercutio.

294
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:51,762
Mercutio.
Good name.

295
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:55,266
- Will! They're waiting for you!
- Yes, I'm coming.

296
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:58,102
Good luck with yours, Kit.

297
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:01,772
- I thought your play was for Burbage.
- This is a different one.

298
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:03,858
A different one
you haven't written?

299
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:06,652
Was this the face...

300
00:21:06,736 --> 00:21:09,196
that launched a thousand ships...

301
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,699
and burnt the topless
towers of llium?

302
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,367
Thank you.

303
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:16,037
Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

304
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,831
- and burnt the top--
topless towers of llium?
- Thank you!

305
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:20,833
Was this the face...

306
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,503
that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless--

307
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:29,133
I would like to give you something
from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

308
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,469
- How refreshing.
- ...the topless towers of llium?

309
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:34,680
Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.

310
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,977
W-Was this the f--

311
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:43,189
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

312
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:46,901
My tailor wants to be an actor.

313
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:49,403
I have a few debts
here and there.

314
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:51,489
Well, that seems
to be everybody.

315
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:53,991
- Did you see a Romeo?
- I did not.

316
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:56,327
Well, I to my work,
you to yours.

317
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,914
Oh, God.

318
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:06,253
May I begin, sir?

319
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,133
- Your name?
- Thomas Kent.

320
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:15,930
I-l would like to do a speech
by a writer who commands
the heart of every player.

321
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:23,938
What light is light...

322
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:26,607
if Silvia be not seen?

323
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:32,279
What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by?

324
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:36,117
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

325
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,453
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

326
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:45,960
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

327
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:49,630
there is no music
in the nightingale.

328
00:22:50,965 --> 00:22:54,969
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

329
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:58,347
there is no day
for me to look upon.

330
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:04,478
She is my essence,
and I leave to be if I be not--

331
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:07,773
- Take off your hat!
- My hat?

332
00:23:07,857 --> 00:23:10,651
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

333
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:12,945
- I--
- Let me see you. Take off your hat.

334
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:15,364
- Are you M-Master Shakespeare?
- Wait there.

335
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:17,325
Wait there!

336
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:33,716
- Will, w-where are the pages?
- Where is the boy?

337
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,056
B-B-B-Break a leg!

338
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:46,687
Sir, will you buy
my sweet orange?

339
00:24:05,164 --> 00:24:07,083
Hey!

340
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,269
Everybody ready? All away!

341
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:31,524
- Follow that boat!
- Right you are, governor.

342
00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:39,615
I know your face.
Are you an actor?

343
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:42,952
- Yes.
- Yes, I think I've
seen you in something.

344
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:45,955
- That one about a king.
- Really?

345
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:48,958
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

346
00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:05,433
- Do you know that house?
- Sir Robert De Lesseps.

347
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:19,488
Where is she? Our guests are upon us!

348
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:23,492
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

349
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:26,579
My husband will have it
settled tonight.

350
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:29,123
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

351
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:32,418
Tomorrow he drags me off
to the country,

352
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:35,421
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

353
00:25:38,257 --> 00:25:40,676
God save you, Mother.

354
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,679
Hot water, Nurse.

355
00:25:46,932 --> 00:25:48,684
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

356
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:50,686
- Who, sir?
- The actor.

357
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,105
- Who asks for him?
- Will Shakespeare.

358
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,191
Poet, playwright of the Rose.

359
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:57,693
Master Kent...

360
00:25:57,777 --> 00:26:00,863
is my nephew.

361
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:02,865
I will wait.

362
00:26:02,948 --> 00:26:05,368
Much good may it do you.

363
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:11,040
"Romeo Montague,

364
00:26:11,123 --> 00:26:13,042
a Young Man of Verona."

365
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,044
Verona again?

366
00:26:15,127 --> 00:26:17,046
"A comedy
of quarreling families...

367
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:19,382
reconciled in
the discovery of Romeo...

368
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:21,884
to be the very same
Capulet cousin...

369
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:25,763
stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...

370
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:30,309
that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king."

371
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:32,311
Your mother and your father--

372
00:26:32,395 --> 00:26:35,314
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

373
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:37,817
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

374
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,820
- He looks well enough for a charlatan.
- Oh, Nurse!

375
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:42,822
He would give Thomas Kent...

376
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,824
the life of
Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

377
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:47,326
My lady, when your parents return,
I will tell.

378
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,328
You will not tell.

379
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:51,664
As I love you and you love me,

380
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:54,667
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy's wig.

381
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:02,800
Master Plum.
What business here?

382
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:04,802
The five schilling business, Will.

383
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:07,054
We play for the dancing.

384
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,726
Hyah! Hyah, hyah!

385
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:27,783
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

386
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:31,412
Musicians don't eat.
Sir Robert's orders.

387
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:33,414
She's a beauty, my lord,

388
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:37,376
as would take a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

389
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,880
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

390
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:43,883
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

391
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:45,885
when your grandson is a Wessex.

392
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:47,928
- Is she fertile?
- Oh, she will breed.

393
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:51,766
- If she do not, send her back.
- Is she obedient?

394
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:53,768
As any mule in Christendom.

395
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:56,771
But if you are the man to ride her,

396
00:27:56,854 --> 00:27:58,773
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

397
00:27:58,856 --> 00:28:01,192
I like her.

398
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,255
By all the stars in heaven.

399
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,633
Who is she?

400
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:29,178
Viola De Lesseps? Dream on, Will.

401
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:09,176
Master Shakespeare.

402
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:18,144
My lady Viola.

403
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,146
My lord.

404
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:22,648
I have spoken with your father.

405
00:29:22,732 --> 00:29:25,651
So, my lord?
I speak with him every day.

406
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:44,587
Good sir.

407
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:48,174
I heard you were a poet.

408
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:54,430
A poet of no words?

409
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:01,520
Poet?

410
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:05,733
I was a poet till now, but I've seen
beauty that puts my poems...

411
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:08,944
at one with the talking ravens
in the Tower.

412
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:12,239
- How do I offend, my lord?
- By coveting my property.

413
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:15,618
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat anon.

414
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:18,120
Do you have a name?

415
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:20,956
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

416
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,483
Romeo. Romeo.

417
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:50,486
A Young Man of Verona.

418
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:53,322
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

419
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:56,492
- My lady!
- Who is there?

420
00:30:57,576 --> 00:30:59,453
- Will Shakespeare.
- Madam!

421
00:30:59,537 --> 00:31:02,957
Anon, good nurse, anon.

422
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:07,670
- Oh, Master Shakespeare.
- The same, alas.

423
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:09,422
But why "alas"?

424
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:11,465
- A lowly player.
- Alas, indeed.

425
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:14,260
For I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

426
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:17,013
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

427
00:31:17,096 --> 00:31:19,515
- Oh, I am him too.
- Madam!

428
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:22,518
Anon!
I will come again.

429
00:31:24,103 --> 00:31:27,565
Oh, I am fortune's fool.
I will be punished for this.

430
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:32,486
Oh, my lady, my love!

431
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,865
If they find you here,
they will kill you.

432
00:31:35,948 --> 00:31:39,452
- You can bring them with a word.
- Oh, not for the world.

433
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:42,705
- Madam!
- Anon!

434
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:43,724
Draw, if you be men!

435
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:45,726
Gregory, remember thy swashing blow!

436
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,230
Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.

437
00:32:49,313 --> 00:32:52,233
It starts well, then it's all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

438
00:32:52,316 --> 00:32:54,735
Where's the comedy, Will?
Where's the dog?

439
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,737
Do you think it's funny?

440
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:59,740
I was a pirate king, now I'm a nurse.
That's funny.

441
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:02,660
We are six men short, and those we
have will be overparted ranters...

442
00:33:02,743 --> 00:33:05,162
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

443
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:07,665
My Romeo's let me down.
I see disaster.

444
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:10,292
We are four acts short,
if you're looking for disaster.

445
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:12,294
- Sir!
- Who are you, master?

446
00:33:12,378 --> 00:33:16,048
I'm Ethel, sir,
the pirate's daughter.

447
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:18,050
I'll be damned if you are!

448
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:22,471
Your attention, please!

449
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:25,975
- Gentlemen, thank you!
- You are welcome.

450
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:28,644
- Who's that?
- Nobody. He's the author.

451
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:31,814
We are about to embark
on a great voyage.

452
00:33:31,897 --> 00:33:35,318
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

453
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:37,820
It does no harm.
Authors like it.

454
00:33:37,903 --> 00:33:41,240
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we--

455
00:33:41,324 --> 00:33:43,242
I'll do it.

456
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:45,745
Now listen to me, you dregs.

457
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:47,747
Actors are ten a penny,

458
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,667
and l, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

459
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:53,919
Huzzah!

460
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:57,590
The Admiral's Men
are returned to the house!

461
00:33:57,673 --> 00:33:59,675
Huzzah!

462
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:06,015
Henslowe!

463
00:34:06,098 --> 00:34:08,017
Earl! Good to see you.

464
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,022
Who is this?

465
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:16,025
Silence, you dog!

466
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:18,986
I am Hieronimo.

467
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,697
I am Tamburlaine.

468
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:24,033
I am Faustus.

469
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:28,037
I am Barabbas,
the Jew of Malta.

470
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:32,208
Oh, yes, Master Will.
I am Henry the Sixth.

471
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:36,462
What is the play,
and what is my part?

472
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:38,964
- Uh, one moment, sir--
- Who are you?

473
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:43,052
I'm, um--
I'm the money.

474
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:45,054
Then you may remain,

475
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:47,056
so long as you remain silent.

476
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:50,226
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

477
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:54,063
- Thank you, sir.
- We are in desperate want
of a Mercutio, Ned.

478
00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:56,732
A young nobleman of Verona.

479
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:58,734
- And the title of this piece?
- Mercutio.

480
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:01,404
Is it?

481
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:03,990
I will play him.

482
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:08,035
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

483
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,996
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

484
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,998
Sam, my pretty one!

485
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:16,085
- Are you ready to fall in love again?
- I am, Master Shakespeare.

486
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:18,379
Your voice.
Have they dropped?

487
00:35:18,462 --> 00:35:20,881
No! No.
A touch of cold only.

488
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:24,593
Master Henslowe, you have your actors...
except Thomas Kent.

489
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:28,222
I, uh, I saw his Tamburlaine,
you know.

490
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:30,224
- It was wonderful.
- Yes, I saw it.

491
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:32,226
Of course,
such mighty writing.

492
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,395
There's no one like Marlowe.

493
00:35:48,534 --> 00:35:50,119
Better fortune, boy.

494
00:35:50,202 --> 00:35:52,121
I was in a play.

495
00:35:52,204 --> 00:35:54,749
They cut my head off
in Titus Andronicus.

496
00:35:54,832 --> 00:35:58,586
When I write plays,
they'll be like Titus.

497
00:35:58,669 --> 00:36:00,129
You admire it.

498
00:36:00,212 --> 00:36:02,298
I liked it
when they cut heads off,

499
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:05,301
and the daughter
mutilated with knives.

500
00:36:05,384 --> 00:36:07,428
- What's your name?
- John Webster.

501
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:09,555
Here, kitty, kitty.

502
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:16,228
Plenty of blood.

503
00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:18,230
That's the only writing.

504
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,776
I have to get back.

505
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,987
See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.

506
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:26,989
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

507
00:36:27,073 --> 00:36:30,493
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.

508
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:32,495
- Cut around him for now.
- What? Who?

509
00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:34,997
- Romeo.
- The one who came with your letter.

510
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:36,999
- What?
- Good morrow, cousin.

511
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,001
Is the day so young?

512
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:42,254
- But new struck nine.
- Ay me. Sad hours seem long.

513
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:45,257
What sadness
lengthens Romeo's hours?

514
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:47,760
Not having that which having
makes them short.

515
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:49,762
- Good.
- In love?

516
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:51,681
- Out.
- Of love?

517
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:55,685
- Out of her favor where I am in love.
- Don't spend it all at once.

518
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,939
Yes, sir.

519
00:37:00,022 --> 00:37:02,858
- Do you understand me?
- No, sir.

520
00:37:02,942 --> 00:37:06,195
You're speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

521
00:37:06,278 --> 00:37:09,532
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet?

522
00:37:09,615 --> 00:37:11,617
- Juliet? You mean Ethel.
- God's teeth!

523
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:15,121
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

524
00:37:16,706 --> 00:37:19,959
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

525
00:37:21,877 --> 00:37:26,132
I-l'm very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

526
00:37:26,215 --> 00:37:29,302
Of course you have not.
I have not written it.

527
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:31,304
Go once more.

528
00:37:31,387 --> 00:37:33,180
Will.

529
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:35,641
Where is Mercutio?

530
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:38,644
Locked safe in here. I'll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

531
00:37:38,728 --> 00:37:40,646
I have a sonnet to write.

532
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,815
Sonnet?
You mean a play!

533
00:37:46,694 --> 00:37:49,363
For Lady Viola De Lesseps,

534
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:53,367
by the hand of Thomas Kent.

535
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:56,203
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

536
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:59,749
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

537
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:05,421
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May--"

538
00:38:05,504 --> 00:38:07,506
Two hours at prayer!

539
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,009
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

540
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:12,011
Piety is for Sunday!

541
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:15,014
And two hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

542
00:38:15,097 --> 00:38:17,933
It would be better
that you return tomorrow, my lord.

543
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:20,770
It would be better if you'd
tell her to get off her knees
and show some civility...

544
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:22,855
to her six-day
lord and master!

545
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:27,234
Mmmph!

546
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,784
My lady Viola.

547
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:37,286
Lord Wessex.
You've been waiting.

548
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,288
I am aware of it.

549
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:42,458
But it is
beauty's privilege.

550
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:44,627
You flatter, my lord.

551
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,464
No. I have spoken
to the queen.

552
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:51,801
Her Majesty's consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife,

553
00:38:51,884 --> 00:38:54,804
and once given,
her consent is her command.

554
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:57,306
Do you intend to marry,
my lord?

555
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,642
Your father should keep you
better informed.

556
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:02,144
He has bought me for you.

557
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:06,816
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

558
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:09,110
You are allowed
to show your pleasure.

559
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:13,572
But I do not love you,
my lord.

560
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:16,409
How your mind hops about.

561
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:18,828
Your father
was a shopkeeper.

562
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:21,288
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

563
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:23,833
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

564
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:25,835
You will like Virginia.

565
00:39:25,918 --> 00:39:28,504
- Virginia?
- Oh, yes.

566
00:39:28,587 --> 00:39:31,674
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

567
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:35,303
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

568
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:38,306
I fancy tobacco
has a future.

569
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:41,350
We will not stay there long.
Three or four years.

570
00:39:41,434 --> 00:39:43,853
But why me?

571
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:45,855
It was your eyes.

572
00:39:45,938 --> 00:39:48,316
No, your lips.

573
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:02,455
Will you defy your father
and your queen?

574
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:04,457
The queen has consented?

575
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,459
She wants to inspect you.

576
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:09,128
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

577
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:13,549
Be submissive,
modest, grateful...

578
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:15,551
and brief.

579
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:20,139
I will do my duty, my lord.

580
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:29,482
"Master Will, poet dearest to my heart,

581
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:33,486
I beseech you
banish me from yours.

582
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:36,822
I am to marry Lord Wessex.

583
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:40,326
A daughter's duty...

584
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,828
and the queen's command."

585
00:41:04,016 --> 00:41:08,187
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

586
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:13,776
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

587
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:17,113
Are you a lady Mr. Kent

588
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:18,948
I'm very sorry, sir.

589
00:41:21,534 --> 00:41:24,453
We're gonna have to do it again.

590
00:41:25,788 --> 00:41:28,207
You did not like the speech?

591
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,209
No, the speech is excellent.

592
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:33,963
"Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you."

593
00:41:34,046 --> 00:41:36,298
Excellent,
and a good length.

594
00:41:36,382 --> 00:41:40,761
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

595
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:44,140
There.
You have this duel.

596
00:41:44,223 --> 00:41:48,019
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

597
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:53,149
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

598
00:41:53,232 --> 00:41:55,985
"A plague
on both your houses!"

599
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,409
He dies?

600
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:08,914
- Ohh!
- Will!

601
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:11,000
Where are my pages?

602
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:25,181
Did you give her my letter?

603
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:28,976
And this is for you!

604
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:45,201
Oh, Thomas,
she has cut my strings.

605
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:48,537
I'm unmanned,

606
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,707
unmended and unmade,

607
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:53,709
Iike a puppet in a box.

608
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:55,878
- Writer, is he?
- Row your boat!

609
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:58,214
She tells me to keep away.

610
00:42:58,297 --> 00:43:01,550
She is to marry Lord Wessex!
What should I do?

611
00:43:01,634 --> 00:43:04,553
If you love her,
you must do as she asks.

612
00:43:04,637 --> 00:43:07,556
- And break her heart and mine?
- It is only yours you can know.

613
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,558
She loves me, Thomas!

614
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:11,560
- Does she say so?
- No.

615
00:43:11,644 --> 00:43:14,563
And yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

616
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:18,067
- Was she weeping
when she gave you this?
- Uh--

617
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,903
- Her letter came to me by the nurse.
- Your aunt.

618
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:22,905
Yes, my aunt.

619
00:43:24,448 --> 00:43:26,867
But perhaps
she wept a little.

620
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:31,414
Tell me how
you love her, Will.

621
00:43:31,497 --> 00:43:35,209
Like a sickness
and its cure together.

622
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:37,795
Oh, yes.

623
00:43:37,878 --> 00:43:40,256
Like rain and sun.

624
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:42,925
Like cold and heat.

625
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,845
Is your lady beautiful?

626
00:43:45,928 --> 00:43:49,515
Since I came here from the country,

627
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:51,517
I have not seen her close.

628
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,520
Tell me, is--
is she beautiful?

629
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:58,316
Thomas, if I could write
with the beauty of her eyes,

630
00:43:58,399 --> 00:44:01,277
I was born to look in them
and know myself.

631
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:05,114
A-A-And her lips?

632
00:44:05,197 --> 00:44:07,116
Her lips?

633
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,703
The early morning rose would whither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

634
00:44:10,786 --> 00:44:13,456
And her voice,
like lark's song?

635
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:16,459
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

636
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:20,129
I would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

637
00:44:20,212 --> 00:44:22,882
- Ah, she sings too?
- Constantly.

638
00:44:22,965 --> 00:44:26,344
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

639
00:44:26,427 --> 00:44:28,471
And her bosom.

640
00:44:28,554 --> 00:44:30,723
Did I mention her bosom?

641
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:32,600
What of her bosom?

642
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:35,269
Oh, Thomas,
a pair of pippins...

643
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:38,272
as round and rare
as golden apples.

644
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:41,317
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

645
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,820
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

646
00:44:44,904 --> 00:44:49,283
when her eyes and lips and voice
may be no more beautiful than mine.

647
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:52,161
Besides, can a--

648
00:44:52,244 --> 00:44:54,622
can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

649
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:57,958
Iove happily with
a bankside poet and player?

650
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:00,336
Yes, by God!

651
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:03,172
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

652
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:06,425
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king.

653
00:45:06,509 --> 00:45:08,928
Their love
should be minded by each,

654
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:11,681
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

655
00:45:11,764 --> 00:45:14,767
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

656
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,769
But what of Lord Wessex?

657
00:45:16,852 --> 00:45:20,272
For one kiss I would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

658
00:45:28,197 --> 00:45:30,199
Oh, Will.

659
00:45:31,283 --> 00:45:33,869
Thank you, my lady.

660
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:37,206
Lady?

661
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:40,209
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

662
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:42,503
Wouldn't deceive a child.

663
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:48,884
Strangely enough,
I'm a bit of a writer meself.

664
00:45:48,968 --> 00:45:51,554
It wouldn't take you long
to read it.

665
00:45:51,637 --> 00:45:54,348
I expect you'd know
all the booksellers!

666
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,859
Can you love a fool?

667
00:46:04,942 --> 00:46:07,737
Can you love a player?

668
00:46:15,161 --> 00:46:17,413
Wait!

669
00:46:17,496 --> 00:46:21,250
You're still a maid,
and perhaps as mistook in me
as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

670
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:24,086
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

671
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,755
I am.

672
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:28,758
Then kiss me again,
for I am not mistook.

673
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:44,732
I do not know
how to undress a man.

674
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:46,734
It is strange to me too.

675
00:48:00,683 --> 00:48:02,768
Go to. Go to.

676
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,902
I would not
have thought it.

677
00:48:13,154 --> 00:48:16,073
There is something
better than a play.

678
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:18,743
There is.

679
00:48:18,826 --> 00:48:21,245
Even your play.

680
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:25,249
Oh?

681
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:29,128
And that was only
my first try.

682
00:48:45,645 --> 00:48:47,563
Will.

683
00:48:49,649 --> 00:48:52,068
You would not leave me.

684
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:54,570
I must.

685
00:48:54,654 --> 00:48:56,572
Look how pale the window.

686
00:48:56,656 --> 00:48:58,574
Moonlight.

687
00:48:58,658 --> 00:49:01,535
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

688
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:04,705
It was the owl.
Come to bed.

689
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:09,210
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

690
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:13,047
Mr. Henslowe?

691
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,549
Mmm, let him be damned
for his pages.

692
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:17,551
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

693
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:20,554
There is time. Mmm!
It is still dark.

694
00:49:20,638 --> 00:49:23,557
- It's broad day.
The rooster tells us so.
- It was the owl.

695
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:25,935
Believe me, love, it was the owl--

696
00:49:27,353 --> 00:49:30,272
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

697
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:35,736
My lady?

698
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,572
The house is stirring.
It is a new day.

699
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:42,076
It is a new world.

700
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:45,079
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

701
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:47,790
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

702
00:49:47,873 --> 00:49:51,085
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

703
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:54,588
and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.

704
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:58,384
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

705
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:00,386
Aye, pilgrim.

706
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:02,888
Lips that they must use
in prayer.

707
00:50:02,972 --> 00:50:06,142
Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

708
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:08,144
They pray.

709
00:50:08,227 --> 00:50:11,647
Grant thou, lest faith
turn to despair.

710
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:15,151
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

711
00:50:16,861 --> 00:50:18,779
It's you.

712
00:50:18,863 --> 00:50:21,282
Suffering cats!

713
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:23,451
Then move not...

714
00:50:23,534 --> 00:50:26,579
while my prayer's effect
I take.

715
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:34,337
Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.

716
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,173
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

717
00:50:37,256 --> 00:50:42,011
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

718
00:50:42,094 --> 00:50:44,722
Yes, yes!
Um, not quite right.

719
00:50:44,805 --> 00:50:46,807
It is more--
Let me.

720
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:49,852
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

721
00:50:49,935 --> 00:50:54,231
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

722
00:51:00,696 --> 00:51:03,240
- You kiss by the book.
- Well, Will!

723
00:51:03,324 --> 00:51:05,409
It was lucky you were here.

724
00:51:05,493 --> 00:51:07,912
- Why do not I write
the rest of your play--
- Yes, yes!

725
00:51:07,995 --> 00:51:12,208
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph?

726
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,170
Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.

727
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:20,716
- What is her mother?
- Marry, bachelor,

728
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,386
her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...

729
00:51:23,469 --> 00:51:25,680
and a wise and virtuous.

730
00:51:25,763 --> 00:51:28,683
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

731
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:31,852
I tell you, he that
can lay hold of her...

732
00:51:31,936 --> 00:51:33,854
shall have the chinks.

733
00:51:33,938 --> 00:51:35,940
- Is she a Capulet?
- Mmm.

734
00:51:36,023 --> 00:51:39,777
Oh, dear account!
My life is my foe's debt.

735
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,655
Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.

736
00:51:42,738 --> 00:51:45,825
Aye, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.

737
00:51:46,993 --> 00:51:50,246
Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman?

738
00:51:50,329 --> 00:51:52,707
The son and heir
of old Tiberio.

739
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,418
Let it be night.

740
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:59,463
- What's he that follows here
that would not dance?
- I know not.

741
00:51:59,547 --> 00:52:01,424
Go ask his name.

742
00:52:02,842 --> 00:52:06,595
If he be married,
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

743
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:09,765
No, do not go.

744
00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:11,767
I must. I must.

745
00:52:11,851 --> 00:52:15,104
- The only son of your great enemy.
- Terrible.

746
00:52:15,187 --> 00:52:17,273
Simply... terrible!

747
00:52:23,696 --> 00:52:28,617
"But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

748
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:30,786
It is the east,

749
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,497
and Juliet is the sun.

750
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:38,127
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

751
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,130
who is already sick
and pale with grief...

752
00:52:41,213 --> 00:52:45,760
that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she."

753
00:52:45,843 --> 00:52:48,638
- Oh, Will.
- Yes, some of it's speakable.

754
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:51,474
"lt is my lady.
Oh, it is my love!

755
00:52:51,557 --> 00:52:54,393
Oh, that she knew she were!

756
00:52:54,477 --> 00:52:58,064
The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...

757
00:52:58,147 --> 00:53:00,441
as daylight doth a lamp."

758
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:03,653
Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...

759
00:53:03,736 --> 00:53:06,322
stream so bright...

760
00:53:06,405 --> 00:53:11,035
that birds would sing
and think it were not night.

761
00:53:11,118 --> 00:53:14,789
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

762
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:17,792
Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand,

763
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:20,127
that I might touch
that cheek.

764
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:23,339
- Ay, me.
- "Oh, Romeo.

765
00:53:23,422 --> 00:53:25,466
Romeo.

766
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:28,135
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

767
00:53:28,219 --> 00:53:31,847
- Deny thy father and--"
- Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

768
00:53:31,931 --> 00:53:34,725
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

769
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:37,561
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

770
00:53:37,645 --> 00:53:40,022
Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?

771
00:53:41,774 --> 00:53:44,527
"What man art thou that
thus bescreened in night...

772
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,321
so stumblest
on my counsel?"

773
00:53:47,405 --> 00:53:50,616
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.

774
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,371
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

775
00:53:55,454 --> 00:53:58,916
Had I it written
I would tear the word.

776
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,337
"The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...

777
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:06,590
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

778
00:54:06,674 --> 00:54:09,260
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

779
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:12,388
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee."

780
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:16,892
Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.

781
00:54:16,976 --> 00:54:21,397
Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.

782
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,774
Would not for the world
they saw thee here.

783
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:26,777
I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

784
00:54:26,861 --> 00:54:30,406
- And but thou love me
let them find me here.
- "Good night.

785
00:54:30,489 --> 00:54:32,408
Good night,

786
00:54:32,491 --> 00:54:35,369
as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...

787
00:54:35,453 --> 00:54:37,830
as that within my breast.

788
00:54:37,913 --> 00:54:40,124
Oh, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?"

789
00:54:40,207 --> 00:54:42,126
That's my line.

790
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:44,253
Oh. It is mine too.

791
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:47,256
Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

792
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,176
What satifaction
canst thou have tonight?

793
00:54:50,259 --> 00:54:53,179
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

794
00:54:53,262 --> 00:54:56,724
"My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.

795
00:54:56,807 --> 00:54:59,435
My love is deep.

796
00:54:59,518 --> 00:55:02,063
The more I give to thee,

797
00:55:02,146 --> 00:55:04,106
the more I have,

798
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:06,192
for both are infinite."

799
00:55:06,275 --> 00:55:08,736
Madam?

800
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:12,948
- I hear some noise within.
Dear love, adieu.
- Juliet!

801
00:55:13,032 --> 00:55:17,953
- "Anon, good nurse."
- Anon, good nurse.
Sweet Montague, be true.

802
00:55:18,037 --> 00:55:20,956
"Stay but a little.
I will come again."

803
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,959
Stay but a little.
I will come again.

804
00:55:24,043 --> 00:55:26,462
Oh, blessed, blessed night.

805
00:55:27,713 --> 00:55:30,132
"l am afeared...

806
00:55:30,216 --> 00:55:34,637
being in night,
all this is but a dream.

807
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,139
Too flattering sweet...

808
00:55:37,223 --> 00:55:39,141
to be substantial."

809
00:55:42,311 --> 00:55:45,231
To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.

810
00:55:45,314 --> 00:55:47,316
A thousand times,
good night.

811
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,819
A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.

812
00:55:49,902 --> 00:55:53,531
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

813
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:56,784
I have no neck in this pig dress.

814
00:56:00,746 --> 00:56:04,458
- How is it?
- It's all right.

815
00:56:08,379 --> 00:56:11,132
Ned, I know, I know.

816
00:56:11,215 --> 00:56:14,135
- It's good.
- Oh?

817
00:56:14,218 --> 00:56:16,971
The title won't do.

818
00:56:17,054 --> 00:56:18,806
Ah.

819
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:22,351
Romeo and Juliet.
Just a suggestion.

820
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:25,479
Thank you, Ned.

821
00:56:27,648 --> 00:56:32,820
- You are a gentleman.
- And you are
a Warwickshire shit-house.

822
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:35,614
- What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?
- By the hour of nine.

823
00:56:35,698 --> 00:56:37,908
I shall not fail.
'Tis 20 year till then.

824
00:56:37,992 --> 00:56:40,161
I have forgot
why I called thee back.

825
00:56:40,244 --> 00:56:42,955
- You mean no dog of any kind?
- Shh! Silence.

826
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:45,708
The friar marries them in secret,

827
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,711
then Ned gets into a fight
with one of the Capulets.

828
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:52,798
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned's way. I mean, in Mercutio's way.

829
00:56:52,882 --> 00:56:56,052
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

830
00:56:56,135 --> 00:56:58,429
Then the prince
banishes him from Verona.

831
00:56:58,512 --> 00:57:00,806
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

832
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,808
on the island
of the pirate king.

833
00:57:02,892 --> 00:57:06,771
For God's sake,
cease your prattling and get out!

834
00:57:06,854 --> 00:57:09,315
Get out!

835
00:57:11,984 --> 00:57:13,903
A thousand apologies.

836
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:18,407
Please.

837
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:21,243
And with a silken thread
plucks it back again,

838
00:57:21,327 --> 00:57:23,579
so loving-jealous
of his liberty.

839
00:57:23,663 --> 00:57:28,709
- I would I were thy bird.
- Sweet, so would l; yet I should
kill thee with much cherishing.

840
00:57:29,794 --> 00:57:32,963
Good night.
Good night.

841
00:57:33,047 --> 00:57:37,718
Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.

842
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:48,396
Sunday.

843
00:57:48,479 --> 00:57:50,606
'Tis Sunday.

844
00:57:57,196 --> 00:58:00,157
I found something
in my sleep.

845
00:58:00,241 --> 00:58:04,787
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

846
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,874
- But it will end well for love.
- In heaven, perhaps.

847
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:11,877
It is not a comedy
I'm writing now.

848
00:58:13,546 --> 00:58:16,674
A broad river
divides my lovers.

849
00:58:16,757 --> 00:58:19,927
Family, duty, fate.

850
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:25,558
As unchangeable as nature.

851
00:58:25,641 --> 00:58:27,560
Yes.

852
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:31,605
This is not life, Will.

853
00:58:31,689 --> 00:58:34,734
It is a stolen season.

854
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:36,736
- Be patient, my lord.
- Patient?

855
00:58:36,819 --> 00:58:39,697
- Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
- My Lord, I will go--

856
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,867
Sunday. Greenwich!

857
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:48,289
Now, pay attention, nursie.

858
00:58:48,372 --> 00:58:50,875
The queen--
Gloriana Regina,

859
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:54,462
God's chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us--

860
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:57,673
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening's festivities...

861
00:58:57,757 --> 00:59:00,926
to bestow her gracious favor
on my choice of wife.

862
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,638
And if we're late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

863
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:07,892
So get you to my lady's chamber
and produce her with or without
her undergarments!

864
00:59:07,975 --> 00:59:10,311
You cannot!
Not for the queen herself!

865
00:59:10,394 --> 00:59:13,939
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

866
00:59:14,023 --> 00:59:16,484
To be the wife
of a poor player.

867
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:20,446
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

868
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:23,824
And yet I would if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

869
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:26,744
You follow your desire
freely enough in the night.

870
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:30,414
- So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
- Then I'll go with you.

871
00:59:30,498 --> 00:59:33,250
- You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
- I know how to fight.

872
00:59:33,334 --> 00:59:35,836
Stage fighting.

873
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,005
Oh, Will.

874
00:59:39,173 --> 00:59:41,592
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you,

875
00:59:41,676 --> 00:59:45,012
but as Viola,
the river divides us,

876
00:59:45,096 --> 00:59:49,183
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

877
00:59:49,266 --> 00:59:52,186
I'll drag her down
by the queen's command!

878
00:59:55,106 --> 00:59:57,108
Good morning, my Lord.

879
00:59:57,191 --> 01:00:02,238
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

880
01:00:02,321 --> 01:00:05,866
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

881
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,411
Are you bringing
your laundrywoman?

882
01:00:10,788 --> 01:00:13,499
Her chaperone,
my lady's country cousin.

883
01:00:13,582 --> 01:00:17,128
My, but you be
a handsome gallant,

884
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:19,547
just as she said.

885
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:22,091
You may call me
Miss Wilhelmina.

886
01:00:22,174 --> 01:00:24,593
On a more fortuitous
occasion, perhaps.

887
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:27,513
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

888
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:32,226
Aye, she never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

889
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:07,178
- Now?
- Now.

890
01:01:07,261 --> 01:01:10,264
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

891
01:01:13,184 --> 01:01:15,478
- Is there a man?
- A man, my lord?

892
01:01:15,561 --> 01:01:19,148
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, I think.

893
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,109
- Does he come to the house?
- A theater poet?

894
01:01:22,193 --> 01:01:25,696
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

895
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,074
- Has he been to the house?
- Marlowe?

896
01:01:28,157 --> 01:01:30,451
Oh, yes. He is the one.

897
01:01:30,534 --> 01:01:34,080
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

898
01:01:34,163 --> 01:01:36,832
That dog!

899
01:01:52,598 --> 01:01:54,642
Your Majesty.

900
01:01:55,851 --> 01:01:58,145
Stand up straight, girl.

901
01:02:01,774 --> 01:02:03,693
I've seen you.

902
01:02:03,776 --> 01:02:07,488
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

903
01:02:07,571 --> 01:02:10,157
Your Majesty.

904
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:12,660
What do you love so much?

905
01:02:12,743 --> 01:02:15,204
- Your Majesty--
- Speak up, girl!

906
01:02:15,287 --> 01:02:17,373
I know who I am.

907
01:02:17,456 --> 01:02:20,835
Do you love stories
of kings and queens?

908
01:02:20,918 --> 01:02:22,837
Of feats of arms?

909
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,631
Or is it courtly love?

910
01:02:25,715 --> 01:02:27,675
I love theater.

911
01:02:27,758 --> 01:02:30,720
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed--

912
01:02:30,803 --> 01:02:34,432
They're not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And?

913
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:38,602
And I love poetry above all.

914
01:02:38,686 --> 01:02:40,604
Above Lord Wessex?

915
01:02:40,688 --> 01:02:43,232
My lord,
when you cannot find your wife,

916
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:45,735
you better look for her
at the playhouse.

917
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:51,032
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

918
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:54,452
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

919
01:02:54,535 --> 01:02:56,454
They cannot make it true.

920
01:02:56,537 --> 01:02:59,332
Oh, but they can.

921
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:06,881
I mean, Your Majesty, they--
they do not, they have... not,

922
01:03:06,964 --> 01:03:09,258
but I believe
there is one who can.

923
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,387
My Lady Viola is young in the world.

924
01:03:13,471 --> 01:03:15,431
Your Majesty is wise in it.

925
01:03:15,514 --> 01:03:18,517
Nature and truth are the very enemies
of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

926
01:03:18,601 --> 01:03:21,479
I thought you were here
because you had none.

927
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,572
- Well, no one will take
your wager, it seems.
- Fifty pounds.

928
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:36,118
Fifty pounds?

929
01:03:37,662 --> 01:03:42,583
A very worthy sum
on a very worthy question.

930
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:46,045
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

931
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,133
I bear witness to the wager...

932
01:03:51,217 --> 01:03:54,345
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

933
01:03:57,056 --> 01:03:59,767
I have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

934
01:04:00,685 --> 01:04:03,270
Are there
no more fireworks?

935
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:07,274
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola's audience.

936
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:11,570
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

937
01:04:11,654 --> 01:04:15,616
She's been plucked since I saw her last,
and not by you.

938
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,619
It takes a woman to know it.

939
01:04:22,248 --> 01:04:24,166
Marlowe.

940
01:04:35,094 --> 01:04:37,013
Burbage?

941
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,878
Huh? Who's there?

942
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,631
Marlowe.

943
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:48,218
You are playing
my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

944
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,511
Don't spend yourself
in sport.

945
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:54,182
- What do you want, Kit?
- My Massacre at Paris is complete.

946
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:57,560
- What? You have the last act?
- If you have the money.

947
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:01,731
-Tomorrow.
-Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

948
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,108
Oh, will you desist, madam!

949
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:07,111
- Oh!
- Twenty pounds on delivery.

950
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,490
Now, what is money to men like us?

951
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:16,329
Besides, if I need a play,
I have another waiting--
a comedy by Shakespeare.

952
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,289
Oh, Romeo.

953
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:21,626
- Gave it to Henslowe.
- Never!

954
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,712
Well, I'm to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

955
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,882
I gave Shakespeare
two sovereigns for Romeo.

956
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:32,387
You did, but Ned Alleyn
and the Admiral's Men have
the playing of it at the Rose.

957
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,430
Treachery!

958
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,017
Traitor and thief!

959
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,189
Oh, no.

960
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,275
No!

961
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,128
By my head,
here comes the Capulets.

962
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,131
By my heel,
I care not.

963
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,509
Follow me close.
I will speak with them.

964
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:14,637
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

965
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,973
Are you going
to do it like that?

966
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,267
Positions.

967
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:23,646
- By my head, here comes the Capulets.
- By my heel, I care not.

968
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,982
Follow me close.
I will speak to them.

969
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,985
Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.

970
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:32,488
And but one word with one of us?

971
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:35,366
Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.

972
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:39,162
Where's that thieving hack that
can't keep his pen in his own ink pot?

973
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,372
What is this rabble?

974
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,502
Draw, if you be a man!

975
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,903
Wonderful.
Wonderful!

976
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:16,241
And a dog.

977
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,744
No!

978
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:23,081
Have privy, players! Please!

979
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:26,042
Oh! Not with my props!

980
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,544
Oh!

981
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,547
- Will! What--
- A writer's quarrel.

982
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,049
Quite normal.

983
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,553
Stay here.

984
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:50,900
You are hurt.

985
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:07,292
I dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

986
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,336
- You were cast ashore in a far country.
- Oh, not yet.

987
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,338
Not yet.

988
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:15,383
'Ey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

989
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,802
My investment!
Lambert!

990
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,472
Vengeance!

991
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:51,002
A famous victory!

992
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:55,173
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house!

993
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,800
Oh, what happy hour.

994
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:01,137
- This is a tavern!
- It is also a tavern.

995
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:03,848
- I remember you. The poet!
- Yes, William the Conqueror.

996
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:08,686
One at a time. One at a time.

997
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:12,649
Oh, he's a pretty one. Tell me
your story while I tickle your fancy.

998
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:20,531
- It's a house of ill repute.
- It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

999
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:23,493
Come.
There's no harm in a drink.

1000
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:28,373
You are welcome to my best house.
Here's to the Admiral's Men.

1001
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:30,166
- The Admiral's Men!
- The Admiral's Men!

1002
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,168
The Admiral's Men!

1003
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:58,570
Well, l--
I quite liked it.

1004
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:01,072
Master Kent,

1005
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,992
you have not yet
dipped your wick.

1006
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:08,496
My "wick"?

1007
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,375
Mr. Fennyman,
because you love the theater,
you must have a part in my play.

1008
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:17,422
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

1009
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:20,592
My heavens.
I thank you.

1010
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,969
What's the play about, then?

1011
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,221
Well, there's this nurse--

1012
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,438
Silence, silence, silence!

1013
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:35,899
Master Shakespeare...

1014
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:40,278
has asked me to play
the part of the apothecary.

1015
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,074
The apothecary?

1016
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,202
What is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

1017
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,455
How does the comedy end?

1018
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:54,751
- By God, I wish I knew.
- By God, if you do not, who does?

1019
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:58,463
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending,

1020
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:01,799
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

1021
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,653
Will! Mr. Henslowe!
Gentlemen all!

1022
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:25,531
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

1023
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:28,034
Marlowe is dead.

1024
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:34,290
Stabbed.

1025
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:38,753
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

1026
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:43,633
What have I done?

1027
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,553
He was the first man among us.

1028
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,305
A great light has gone out.

1029
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,115
Forgive me.

1030
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,412
God forgive me.

1031
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,150
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake.

1032
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,652
One morning
in the month of May

1033
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:47,780
From my cot I stray

1034
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,533
Just at the dawning
of the day

1035
01:12:50,617 --> 01:12:53,202
I met with
a charming mai--

1036
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:58,875
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

1037
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:02,378
- It's not my riding day, my lord.
- Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

1038
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:05,089
I'm going to church.

1039
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:08,885
Of course. I understand.
It is to be expected.

1040
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:12,388
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

1041
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:15,767
And on a day of mourning.

1042
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,978
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

1043
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:21,064
Mourning?

1044
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,568
Who is dead, my lord?

1045
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:30,573
Oh! Dear God, I did not think
it would be me to tell you.

1046
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:35,286
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

1047
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,331
My lady.

1048
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:42,085
- He is dead?
- Killed last night in a tavern.

1049
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:46,464
Come then.
We'll say a prayer for his soul.

1050
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:59,727
Who can remember sorrow

1051
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,219
Spare me, dear ghost.

1052
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:36,055
Spare me, dear ghost.

1053
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:38,975
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me!

1054
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,157
Will!

1055
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:57,493
Oh, my love.

1056
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:59,495
I thought you were dead.

1057
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,503
It is worse.

1058
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,839
I've killed a man.

1059
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,846
Marlowe's touch
was in my Titus Andronicus,

1060
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:20,600
and my Henry VI was a house built
on his foundations.

1061
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:24,312
You never spoke
so well of him.

1062
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:27,523
He was not dead before.

1063
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:32,362
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

1064
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,865
You lie.

1065
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:41,704
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

1066
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:44,249
My love is no lie.

1067
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,961
I have a wife, yes,

1068
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:51,297
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1069
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:55,093
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that,

1070
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:59,556
and yet, you let me
come to your bed.

1071
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:02,892
Calf-love.

1072
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:07,397
I loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

1073
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,233
I was the more deceived.

1074
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:13,236
Yes, you were deceived,

1075
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,698
for I did not know
how much I loved you.

1076
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:22,412
I love you, Will,

1077
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,581
beyond poetry.

1078
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:27,166
Oh, my love.

1079
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:31,296
- You ran from me before.
- When I thought you dead,
I did not care...

1080
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,673
about all the plays
that would never come,

1081
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,467
only that I would
never see your face.

1082
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:39,846
I saw our end,
and it will come.

1083
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:44,434
- You cannot marry Wessex.
- If not you, why not Wessex?

1084
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:47,103
If not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause,

1085
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:51,858
- and there will be
no more Will Shakespeare.
- No. No.

1086
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:56,446
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows,

1087
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:59,449
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

1088
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:04,287
For killing Juliet's
kinsman Tybalt,

1089
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,290
the one who killed
Romeo's friend Mercutio,

1090
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,334
Romeo is banished.

1091
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:12,003
- But the friar who married
Romeo and Juliet--
- Is that me?

1092
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:16,966
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1093
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:20,803
It is a secret potion.
It makes us seeming dead.

1094
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:23,848
She is placed in the tomb
of the Capulets.

1095
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:26,684
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

1096
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:32,941
I have not said all.

1097
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:38,196
By maligned fate, the message
goes astray which would tell
Romeo of the friar's plan.

1098
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:41,658
He hears only
that Juliet is dead.

1099
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:44,744
And thus he goes
to the apothecary...

1100
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,746
That's me.

1101
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,082
and buys a deadly poison.

1102
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:54,087
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet who lies there cold as death.

1103
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,506
He drinks the poison.

1104
01:17:57,966 --> 01:18:00,218
He dies by her side,

1105
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:05,265
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

1106
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:08,476
And so Juliet
takes his dagger...

1107
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:13,439
and then kills herself.

1108
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:19,654
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

1109
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:22,615
Sad... and wonderful.

1110
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:26,619
I have a blue velvet cap
that'll do well.

1111
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:29,455
I've seen just such a cap
on an apothecary.

1112
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:31,541
Just so.

1113
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,879
Yes, it will serve.

1114
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:40,091
But there's a scene missing.

1115
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:43,052
Between marriage
and death?

1116
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:53,563
The play...
all written out for you.

1117
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:57,734
I had the clerk
at Bridewell do it.

1118
01:18:57,817 --> 01:19:00,236
He has a good fist
for lettering.

1119
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,324
There is a new scene.

1120
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:15,501
- Will you read in for me?
- "Wilt thou be gone?
It's not yet near day.

1121
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:18,338
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

1122
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:21,007
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear.

1123
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,177
Nightly she sings
on yon pomegranate tree.

1124
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,096
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale."

1125
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:31,226
"lt was the lark,
the herald of the morn;

1126
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:33,645
no nightingale.

1127
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:36,648
Look, love,
what envious streaks...

1128
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:40,860
do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.

1129
01:19:40,944 --> 01:19:44,781
Night's candles
are burnt out,

1130
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:47,283
and jocund day
stands tiptoe...

1131
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:50,745
on the misty mountaintops.

1132
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:55,291
I must be gone and live,
or stay and die."

1133
01:19:57,043 --> 01:20:01,089
"Yon light is not daylight;
I know it, l.

1134
01:20:01,172 --> 01:20:04,133
It is some meteor
that the sun exhales...

1135
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:08,888
to be to thee this night
a torchbearer...

1136
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:12,183
to light thee
on thy way to Mantua.

1137
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:16,104
Therefore, stay yet.

1138
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:19,732
Thou needst not
to be gone."

1139
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:22,068
"Let me be ta'en,

1140
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:25,238
Iet me be put to death;

1141
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:29,659
I am content,
so thou wilt have it so.

1142
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,328
I have more care
to stay...

1143
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:34,789
than will to go.

1144
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:37,250
Come, death, and welcome.

1145
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:40,336
Juliet wills it so."

1146
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:06,362
You will go far, I fear.

1147
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:12,869
I hope we work
together again.

1148
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:18,541
"Such mortal drugs I have,
but Mantua's law...

1149
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:22,921
is death, death to
any he that utters them."

1150
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:24,631
Then him. Then me.

1151
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:28,218
"Put-- Put this...

1152
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:30,678
- in any liquid thing you will and--"
- Hah!

1153
01:21:30,762 --> 01:21:34,974
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

1154
01:21:35,058 --> 01:21:39,062
How silver sweet sound
lovers' tongues by night.

1155
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:41,064
- Like soft music--
- Shakespeare!

1156
01:21:58,498 --> 01:22:00,458
Upstart inky pup!

1157
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:04,462
I'll show you your place,
which is in hell!

1158
01:22:08,883 --> 01:22:12,262
- You're on my ground now!
- By God, I'll fight the lot of you!

1159
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:14,264
I am more than enough!

1160
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:24,107
Move!

1161
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,690
Absent friends.

1162
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:52,070
This is the murderer
of Kit Marlowe!

1163
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:55,365
Will?

1164
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:58,701
I rejoiced in his death
because I thought it was yours!
That is all I know of Marlowe!

1165
01:23:58,785 --> 01:24:02,372
Will? Uh, it's true.

1166
01:24:02,455 --> 01:24:05,250
It was a... tavern brawl.

1167
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:10,296
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

1168
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,590
A quarrel about the bill.

1169
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:15,927
The bill?
Oh, vanity, vanity!

1170
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,388
Not the billing,
the bill!

1171
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,394
Oh, God.

1172
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:26,980
- I am free of it.
- Where is she?

1173
01:24:27,814 --> 01:24:30,066
Close it.

1174
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:34,612
- My Lord Wessex.
- The Rose harbors the ass
that shits on my name!

1175
01:24:34,696 --> 01:24:36,906
Take it down
stone by stone.

1176
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:40,702
I want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

1177
01:24:40,785 --> 01:24:42,662
Mr. Tilney,
what is this?

1178
01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:45,164
Sedition and indecency.

1179
01:24:45,248 --> 01:24:47,959
Master of the Revels, sir.
She's over here.

1180
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,670
- Where, boy?
- There.

1181
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:52,922
I saw her bubbies.

1182
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:57,385
So, a woman on the stage!

1183
01:24:57,468 --> 01:25:01,598
A woman!
I say this theater is closed!

1184
01:25:01,681 --> 01:25:03,141
Why, sir?

1185
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:07,353
For lewdness
and unshamedfacedness!

1186
01:25:07,437 --> 01:25:12,317
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

1187
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,459
Not him, her!

1188
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:34,464
That's who I meant.

1189
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:40,637
- He's a woman.
- This theater is closed.

1190
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:45,975
Notice will be posted!

1191
01:25:46,059 --> 01:25:49,020
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

1192
01:25:49,103 --> 01:25:51,981
- Nobody knew.
- He did.

1193
01:25:52,065 --> 01:25:55,068
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

1194
01:25:57,528 --> 01:26:00,657
It is over.

1195
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:03,493
I'm sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1196
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:20,843
I wanted to be an actor.

1197
01:26:20,927 --> 01:26:23,388
I'm so sorry, Will.

1198
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:32,522
You were... w-w--

1199
01:26:33,773 --> 01:26:36,025
w-wonderful.

1200
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,862
Thank you.

1201
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:52,709
"Let me put this in any
liquid thing you will and--"

1202
01:26:59,132 --> 01:27:01,718
Everything all right?

1203
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:42,383
I would've been good.

1204
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:45,553
- I would've been great.
- So would l.

1205
01:27:45,637 --> 01:27:48,056
We both would.

1206
01:28:10,328 --> 01:28:12,789
Lambert, kill him.

1207
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:16,376
That can wait.

1208
01:28:20,046 --> 01:28:25,260
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1209
01:28:26,886 --> 01:28:29,013
But my father,
James Burbage,

1210
01:28:29,097 --> 01:28:33,560
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty,

1211
01:28:33,643 --> 01:28:38,356
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

1212
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:41,943
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

1213
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:44,028
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1214
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:49,993
I have a theater.
The curtain is yours.

1215
01:29:22,942 --> 01:29:26,821
Will!
We'll be needing a Romeo.

1216
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:35,747
Oranges!
Sweet oranges!

1217
01:30:03,524 --> 01:30:07,737
My ship is moored at bankside, bound for
Virginia on the afternoon tide.

1218
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,906
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.

1219
01:30:09,989 --> 01:30:11,908
You are gaining a colony.

1220
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:14,827
And you, my lord,
are gaining 5,000 pounds...

1221
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:17,413
by these drafts in my hand.

1222
01:30:17,497 --> 01:30:20,250
Would you oblige me
with 50 or so in gold...

1223
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:23,419
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside?

1224
01:30:24,712 --> 01:30:27,590
Ah, the bride!

1225
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:31,761
Good morning, my lord.

1226
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:35,807
I see you are... open for business,
so let's to church.

1227
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,939
Be gone!

1228
01:30:43,022 --> 01:30:45,149
Hup, hup, hup!

1229
01:31:41,331 --> 01:31:43,249
Oh, my lord!

1230
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:45,919
- Be good to her, my lord.
- I will.

1231
01:31:46,002 --> 01:31:48,087
Oh, God bless you!

1232
01:31:48,171 --> 01:31:51,007
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There's a good nurse.

1233
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:53,051
The tide will not wait!

1234
01:31:53,134 --> 01:31:57,013
Farewell!
You'll all be welcome in Virginia!

1235
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:26,209
Candy apples!

1236
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:28,211
Candy apples!

1237
01:32:28,294 --> 01:32:31,839
Buy my apples!

1238
01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:38,555
Thank you, sir.
Apples!

1239
01:32:46,062 --> 01:32:49,440
Is this, uh--
Is this all right?

1240
01:32:49,524 --> 01:32:51,442
Yeah.

1241
01:33:06,749 --> 01:33:11,087
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

1242
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:15,717
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show!

1243
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:20,763
This is the very business
of show!

1244
01:33:29,898 --> 01:33:34,444
T-T-- T-Two--

1245
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:37,155
T-T-T-T-- T-- T--

1246
01:33:37,238 --> 01:33:40,909
T-- T-T-Two households--

1247
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:43,953
- We're lost.
- No, it will turn out well.

1248
01:33:44,037 --> 01:33:47,498
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

1249
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:53,546
T-T-- T-- T-T--

1250
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:55,965
T-- T--

1251
01:34:47,267 --> 01:34:49,811
Two households,

1252
01:34:49,894 --> 01:34:53,022
both alike in dignity,

1253
01:34:53,106 --> 01:34:55,858
in fair Verona,

1254
01:34:55,942 --> 01:34:58,528
where we lay our scene.

1255
01:34:58,611 --> 01:35:01,656
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny,

1256
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:05,118
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

1257
01:35:05,201 --> 01:35:08,204
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

1258
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:11,416
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

1259
01:35:11,499 --> 01:35:14,252
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

1260
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:17,797
doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

1261
01:35:20,967 --> 01:35:24,053
...the which of you
with patient ears attend,

1262
01:35:24,137 --> 01:35:28,892
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

1263
01:35:35,231 --> 01:35:37,233
- Wonderful.
- Was it...

1264
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:40,403
good?

1265
01:35:43,156 --> 01:35:46,326
Gregory, on my word
we'll not carry coals.

1266
01:35:46,409 --> 01:35:49,454
No, for then
we should be colliers.

1267
01:35:49,537 --> 01:35:52,040
I mean, and we be
in choler we'll draw.

1268
01:35:52,123 --> 01:35:55,210
- Master Shakespeare.
- Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

1269
01:35:55,293 --> 01:35:57,754
It's not my fault.
I could do it yesterday.

1270
01:35:57,837 --> 01:36:01,007
Do me a speech.
Do me a line.

1271
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:04,928
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

1272
01:36:05,011 --> 01:36:08,264
- Another little problem.
- What do we do now?

1273
01:36:08,348 --> 01:36:12,268
- The show must-- You know.
- Go on!

1274
01:36:12,352 --> 01:36:15,772
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

1275
01:36:15,855 --> 01:36:18,274
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

1276
01:36:18,358 --> 01:36:20,652
- Fear me not.
- No, marry, I fear thee!

1277
01:36:23,071 --> 01:36:25,949
- Let them begin.
- I will frown as I pass by.

1278
01:36:26,032 --> 01:36:29,827
- Let them take it as they list!
- Nay, as they dare.

1279
01:36:29,911 --> 01:36:33,957
I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.

1280
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,960
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

1281
01:36:37,043 --> 01:36:40,338
- I do bite my thumb, sir.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

1282
01:36:40,421 --> 01:36:44,050
- Thank you. Excuse me.
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

1283
01:36:44,133 --> 01:36:46,052
- Can we talk?
- Shh!

1284
01:36:46,135 --> 01:36:48,972
- We have no Juliet.
- No Juliet?

1285
01:36:49,055 --> 01:36:52,183
- No Juliet?
- It'll be all right, madam.

1286
01:36:52,267 --> 01:36:55,353
- What happened to Sam?
- Who are you?
- Thomas Kent.

1287
01:36:55,436 --> 01:36:58,022
Do you know it?

1288
01:36:58,106 --> 01:37:01,234
- I serve as good a man as you.
- Every word.

1289
01:37:05,071 --> 01:37:07,699
Hyah! Yah!

1290
01:37:11,494 --> 01:37:14,497
I'll go along,
no such sight to be shown,

1291
01:37:14,581 --> 01:37:17,709
but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.

1292
01:37:17,792 --> 01:37:20,086
Nurse!

1293
01:37:22,463 --> 01:37:25,717
Where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

1294
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:29,012
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

1295
01:37:29,095 --> 01:37:31,014
I bade her come.

1296
01:37:31,097 --> 01:37:33,182
How now, who calls?

1297
01:37:33,266 --> 01:37:36,019
What, ladybird!

1298
01:37:36,102 --> 01:37:37,854
God forbid!
Where's this girl?

1299
01:37:37,937 --> 01:37:40,565
What, lamb!

1300
01:37:40,648 --> 01:37:42,859
What, ladybird!

1301
01:37:43,943 --> 01:37:46,362
What, Juliet!

1302
01:37:47,488 --> 01:37:50,867
How now, who calls?

1303
01:37:53,828 --> 01:37:58,416
- We'll all be put in the Clink.
- See you in jail.

1304
01:38:01,544 --> 01:38:04,714
Your mother--
Your mother.

1305
01:38:04,797 --> 01:38:08,092
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

1306
01:38:08,176 --> 01:38:10,220
This is the matter.

1307
01:38:10,303 --> 01:38:12,722
Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.

1308
01:38:12,805 --> 01:38:17,560
Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.

1309
01:38:17,644 --> 01:38:20,980
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

1310
01:38:21,064 --> 01:38:24,567
- Faith, I know her age unto an hour.
- She's not 14.

1311
01:38:24,651 --> 01:38:30,156
Oh, I'll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken,

1312
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:32,992
I have but four--

1313
01:38:55,181 --> 01:38:57,225
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

1314
01:38:57,308 --> 01:39:01,896
how stands your dispositions
to be married?

1315
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:05,108
It is an honor
that I dream not of.

1316
01:39:09,404 --> 01:39:12,282
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

1317
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:23,251
I-- I'm sped.

1318
01:39:23,334 --> 01:39:26,129
Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.

1319
01:39:26,212 --> 01:39:28,590
Ask for me tomorrow,

1320
01:39:28,673 --> 01:39:31,509
you shall find me
a grave man.

1321
01:39:38,725 --> 01:39:41,978
Yes!

1322
01:39:47,233 --> 01:39:49,152
Yah!

1323
01:39:49,235 --> 01:39:51,779
"Such mortal drugs I have,

1324
01:39:51,863 --> 01:39:56,534
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them."

1325
01:39:56,618 --> 01:39:59,162
Then him. Then me.

1326
01:40:07,629 --> 01:40:09,714
Romeo, away, be gone!

1327
01:40:09,797 --> 01:40:14,219
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed!

1328
01:40:14,302 --> 01:40:18,556
The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

1329
01:40:19,766 --> 01:40:22,101
Oh, I am Fortune's fool!

1330
01:40:22,185 --> 01:40:24,103
Why dost thou stay?

1331
01:40:24,187 --> 01:40:26,189
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?

1332
01:40:26,272 --> 01:40:28,483
That murderer,
which way ran he?

1333
01:40:28,566 --> 01:40:31,361
- There lies that Tybalt.
- Up, sir. Go with me.

1334
01:40:31,444 --> 01:40:33,488
I charge thee
in the Prince's name obey.

1335
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:36,282
Where are the vile beginners
of this fray?

1336
01:40:36,366 --> 01:40:38,618
"Oh, I am Fortune's fool."

1337
01:40:41,412 --> 01:40:43,373
You are married?

1338
01:40:47,001 --> 01:40:52,048
"lf you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed."

1339
01:41:07,814 --> 01:41:10,024
Art thou gone so,

1340
01:41:12,652 --> 01:41:14,779
Iove, lord,

1341
01:41:14,862 --> 01:41:17,073
aye, husband, friend?

1342
01:41:17,156 --> 01:41:21,911
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

1343
01:41:21,995 --> 01:41:24,914
for in a minute
there are many days.

1344
01:41:24,998 --> 01:41:28,585
Oh, by this count
I shall be much in years ere again...

1345
01:41:28,668 --> 01:41:31,087
I behold my Romeo.

1346
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:33,089
Farewell.

1347
01:41:34,591 --> 01:41:37,510
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

1348
01:41:39,554 --> 01:41:42,599
Methinks I see thee,
now thou art so low,

1349
01:41:42,682 --> 01:41:46,144
as one dead
in the bottom of a tomb.

1350
01:41:46,227 --> 01:41:49,606
Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look'st pale.

1351
01:41:51,858 --> 01:41:54,068
Then trust me, love,

1352
01:41:54,152 --> 01:41:56,487
in my eyes, so do you.

1353
01:41:56,571 --> 01:42:00,325
Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.

1354
01:42:00,408 --> 01:42:02,327
Adieu.

1355
01:42:03,828 --> 01:42:06,456
Adieu.

1356
01:42:06,539 --> 01:42:09,292
Take thou this vial,
being then in bed,

1357
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:12,462
and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.

1358
01:42:12,545 --> 01:42:16,507
No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.

1359
01:42:16,591 --> 01:42:19,552
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

1360
01:42:19,636 --> 01:42:22,847
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours,

1361
01:42:22,931 --> 01:42:26,559
and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

1362
01:42:26,643 --> 01:42:28,728
What ho! Apothecary!

1363
01:42:32,232 --> 01:42:35,860
Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.

1364
01:42:35,944 --> 01:42:38,863
Hold, there is 40 ducats.

1365
01:42:38,947 --> 01:42:42,700
- Let me have a dram of poison--
- Such mortal drugs I have,

1366
01:42:42,784 --> 01:42:46,829
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.

1367
01:42:46,913 --> 01:42:50,416
- Art thou so--
- My poverty, but not my will, consents.

1368
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:59,175
I pay thy poverty
and not thy will.

1369
01:43:03,179 --> 01:43:05,348
Eyes, look your last.

1370
01:43:05,431 --> 01:43:08,184
Arms, take your last embrace.

1371
01:43:08,268 --> 01:43:10,603
And, lips,

1372
01:43:10,687 --> 01:43:14,148
oh, you,
the doors of breath,

1373
01:43:14,232 --> 01:43:16,651
seal with
a righteous kiss...

1374
01:43:18,611 --> 01:43:20,863
the dateless bargain...

1375
01:43:20,947 --> 01:43:23,199
to engrossing death.

1376
01:43:24,492 --> 01:43:27,328
Come, bitter conduct.

1377
01:43:27,412 --> 01:43:30,707
Come, unsavory guide.

1378
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:34,502
Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...

1379
01:43:34,586 --> 01:43:39,382
run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.

1380
01:43:39,465 --> 01:43:41,885
Here's to my love!

1381
01:43:49,809 --> 01:43:52,979
Oh... true apothecary!

1382
01:43:56,983 --> 01:43:59,235
Thy drugs are quick.

1383
01:44:04,032 --> 01:44:06,618
Thus with a kiss...

1384
01:44:09,329 --> 01:44:11,414
I die.

1385
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:31,226
Where is my lord?

1386
01:44:32,977 --> 01:44:37,106
I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?

1387
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:38,483
Dead!

1388
01:44:51,871 --> 01:44:53,915
What's this?

1389
01:44:53,998 --> 01:44:57,710
A cup, closed
in my true love's hand?

1390
01:44:57,794 --> 01:45:00,296
Poison, I see,

1391
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:03,091
hath been
his timeless end.

1392
01:45:08,763 --> 01:45:11,307
Oh, happy dagger,

1393
01:45:11,391 --> 01:45:13,351
this is thy sheath.

1394
01:45:16,312 --> 01:45:18,648
There rest...

1395
01:45:20,108 --> 01:45:22,360
and let me die.

1396
01:45:29,242 --> 01:45:32,829
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings;

1397
01:45:32,912 --> 01:45:37,333
the sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

1398
01:45:37,417 --> 01:45:42,422
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

1399
01:45:42,505 --> 01:45:44,757
Some shall be pardoned,

1400
01:45:44,841 --> 01:45:47,844
and some punished;

1401
01:45:47,927 --> 01:45:52,056
for never was a story
of more woe...

1402
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:55,768
than this of Juliet...

1403
01:45:55,852 --> 01:45:58,104
and her Romeo.

1404
01:46:25,215 --> 01:46:28,092
Bravo!

1405
01:46:31,804 --> 01:46:33,806
- Yea! Yea!
- Yea!

1406
01:47:20,186 --> 01:47:22,897
- Bravo!
- Yea! Bravo!

1407
01:47:37,370 --> 01:47:41,791
- God save the queen!
- I arrest you in the name
of Queen Elizabeth!

1408
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:45,879
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

1409
01:47:45,962 --> 01:47:47,714
Everyone!

1410
01:47:47,797 --> 01:47:51,134
Admiral's Men,
the Chamberlain's Men...

1411
01:47:51,217 --> 01:47:55,555
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

1412
01:47:55,638 --> 01:47:59,017
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

1413
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:03,146
Contempt? You closed the Rose.
I have not opened it.

1414
01:48:03,229 --> 01:48:05,732
That woman is a woman!

1415
01:48:05,815 --> 01:48:07,901
What?

1416
01:48:07,984 --> 01:48:11,195
A woman?
You mean that goat?

1417
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:16,701
I'll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

1418
01:48:16,784 --> 01:48:20,121
Mr. Tilney!

1419
01:48:25,335 --> 01:48:29,088
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

1420
01:48:37,013 --> 01:48:39,724
The queen of England
does not attend...

1421
01:48:39,807 --> 01:48:41,851
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1422
01:48:41,935 --> 01:48:44,938
So something
is out of joint.

1423
01:48:46,856 --> 01:48:50,526
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

1424
01:49:05,333 --> 01:49:08,253
Yes, the illusion
is remarkable.

1425
01:49:08,336 --> 01:49:11,047
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

1426
01:49:12,382 --> 01:49:16,386
But I know something of
a woman in a man's profession.

1427
01:49:16,469 --> 01:49:19,430
Yes, by God,
I do know about that.

1428
01:49:21,182 --> 01:49:24,102
That is enough from you,
Master Kent.

1429
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:31,192
If only Lord Wessex
were here.

1430
01:49:31,276 --> 01:49:33,319
He is, ma'am.

1431
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:39,450
Y-Your Majesty.

1432
01:49:40,702 --> 01:49:43,705
There was a wager
I remember...

1433
01:49:43,788 --> 01:49:48,626
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

1434
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:51,296
I think you lost it today.

1435
01:49:55,967 --> 01:49:59,888
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

1436
01:49:59,971 --> 01:50:02,891
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

1437
01:50:09,564 --> 01:50:11,983
Master Shakespeare.

1438
01:50:14,569 --> 01:50:17,572
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself,

1439
01:50:17,655 --> 01:50:20,783
and we will speak
some more.

1440
01:50:38,259 --> 01:50:40,511
Your Majesty.

1441
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:43,890
Why, Lord Wessex.

1442
01:50:43,973 --> 01:50:46,517
Lost your wife so soon?

1443
01:50:46,601 --> 01:50:49,354
Indeed I am a bride short,

1444
01:50:49,437 --> 01:50:53,733
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

1445
01:50:53,816 --> 01:50:56,402
How is this to end?

1446
01:50:56,486 --> 01:50:59,239
As stories must
when love's denied--

1447
01:50:59,322 --> 01:51:01,950
with tears and a journey.

1448
01:51:01,991 --> 01:51:04,452
Those whom God
has joined in marriage...

1449
01:51:04,535 --> 01:51:07,997
not even I
can put asunder.

1450
01:51:08,081 --> 01:51:10,792
Master Kent.

1451
01:51:16,506 --> 01:51:20,510
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1452
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:26,266
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

1453
01:51:26,349 --> 01:51:28,768
It's time
to settle accounts.

1454
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:34,983
- How much was that wager?
- Fifty shillings.

1455
01:51:36,317 --> 01:51:38,861
Pounds.

1456
01:51:38,945 --> 01:51:43,408
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

1457
01:51:50,999 --> 01:51:54,961
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

1458
01:51:55,044 --> 01:51:57,881
for Twelfth Night.

1459
01:52:13,813 --> 01:52:15,690
Too late.

1460
01:52:15,773 --> 01:52:18,484
Too late.

1461
01:52:27,243 --> 01:52:29,287
My Lady Wessex.

1462
01:52:44,469 --> 01:52:47,513
A hired player
no longer.

1463
01:52:47,597 --> 01:52:50,225
Fifty pounds, Will,

1464
01:52:50,308 --> 01:52:52,810
for the poet of true love.

1465
01:52:53,937 --> 01:52:55,855
I'm done with theater.

1466
01:52:57,649 --> 01:53:00,193
The playhouse
is for dreamers.

1467
01:53:00,276 --> 01:53:02,779
Look what the dream
brought us.

1468
01:53:03,905 --> 01:53:06,532
It was we ourselves
did that.

1469
01:53:07,909 --> 01:53:12,163
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

1470
01:53:12,247 --> 01:53:16,417
I have hurt you,
and I'm sorry for it.

1471
01:53:16,501 --> 01:53:20,547
If my hurt is to be
that you write no more,

1472
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:23,049
then I shall be
the sorrier.

1473
01:53:28,596 --> 01:53:31,182
The queen commands
a comedy, Will,

1474
01:53:31,266 --> 01:53:33,226
for Twelfth Night.

1475
01:53:33,309 --> 01:53:36,396
A comedy.

1476
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:38,481
What would my hero be?

1477
01:53:38,565 --> 01:53:42,026
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

1478
01:53:44,237 --> 01:53:47,740
It's a beginning.

1479
01:53:47,824 --> 01:53:51,911
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine--

1480
01:53:51,995 --> 01:53:55,331
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

1481
01:53:57,166 --> 01:54:01,379
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

1482
01:54:01,462 --> 01:54:04,340
A storm.
All are lost.

1483
01:54:04,424 --> 01:54:07,886
She lands... on a...

1484
01:54:07,969 --> 01:54:10,972
vast and empty shore.

1485
01:54:12,432 --> 01:54:14,475
She's brought to the duke--

1486
01:54:15,894 --> 01:54:18,938
- Orsino.
- Orsino?

1487
01:54:20,064 --> 01:54:21,983
Good name.

1488
01:54:22,066 --> 01:54:26,404
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1489
01:54:26,487 --> 01:54:30,366
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

1490
01:54:32,577 --> 01:54:34,787
But all ends well.

1491
01:54:34,871 --> 01:54:37,081
How does it?

1492
01:54:37,165 --> 01:54:39,292
I don't know.

1493
01:54:40,877 --> 01:54:43,671
It's a mystery.

1494
01:54:49,886 --> 01:54:52,555
You will never age for me,

1495
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,557
nor fade,

1496
01:54:54,641 --> 01:54:56,893
nor die.

1497
01:54:56,976 --> 01:54:59,479
Nor you for me.

1498
01:55:00,813 --> 01:55:03,107
Good-bye, my love.

1499
01:55:04,859 --> 01:55:07,237
A thousand times good-bye.

1500
01:55:11,741 --> 01:55:13,660
Write me well.

1501
01:55:46,401 --> 01:55:50,029
My story starts at sea,

1502
01:55:50,113 --> 01:55:53,366
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

1503
01:55:54,742 --> 01:55:57,829
A shipwreck.

1504
01:55:59,706 --> 01:56:03,501
The wild waters roar and heave.

1505
01:56:04,711 --> 01:56:07,964
The brave vessel
is dashed all to pieces,

1506
01:56:10,717 --> 01:56:14,596
and all the helpless souls
within her...

1507
01:56:14,679 --> 01:56:16,973
drowned.

1508
01:56:19,642 --> 01:56:22,937
All save one:

1509
01:56:23,021 --> 01:56:25,189
a lady...

1510
01:56:26,566 --> 01:56:30,820
whose soul is greater
than the ocean,

1511
01:56:30,904 --> 01:56:35,158
and her spirit,
stronger than the sea's embrace.

1512
01:56:37,493 --> 01:56:40,622
Not for her a watery end,

1513
01:56:42,165 --> 01:56:46,252
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

1514
01:56:50,381 --> 01:56:52,926
It will be a love story,

1515
01:56:57,055 --> 01:57:01,226
for she will be my heroine
for all time.

1516
01:57:04,062 --> 01:57:07,607
And her name will be Viola.
