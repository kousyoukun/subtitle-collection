1
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:01,455
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn't pay his debts?

2
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,665
His boots catch fire!

3
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,836
Why do you how!...

4
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,547
when it is I who am bitten?

5
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,550
- What am I, Mr. Lambert?
- Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

6
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,552
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

7
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,555
Twelve pounds, one schilling and fourpence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

8
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,516
- Aaah! I can pay you!
- When?

9
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,810
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
Oh, for pity's sake!

10
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,063
Take them out.

11
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,065
Where will you find...

12
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,067
Sixteen pounds,
five schillings and ninepence.

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,069
Including interest,
in three weeks?

14
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,863
- I have a wonderful new play.
- Put them back in.

15
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,865
- It's a comedy!
- Cut off his nose.

16
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,493
It's a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

17
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,497
- And his ears.
- And a share!

18
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,541
We will be partners,
Mr. Fennyman!

19
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,127
Partners?

20
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,425
It's a crowd-tickler.

21
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,012
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

22
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,932
- A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
- I think I've seen it.

23
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,767
I didn't like it.

24
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,563
- But this time it is by Shakespeare.
- What's it called?

25
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,440
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

26
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,609
Good title.

27
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,029
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

28
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,532
Let's say we open
in two weeks.

29
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,034
That's, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

30
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,746
In addition, 400 backsides at
threepence, a penny extra for cushions.

31
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,790
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

32
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,627
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees?

33
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,839
- Twenty pounds
to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
- Correct.

34
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,967
- But I have to pay
the actors and the author.
- Share of the profits.

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,469
- There's never any--
- Of course not.

36
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:43,891
Oh-- Oh, Mr. Fennyman, I think you
might have hit upon something.

37
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,476
Sign there.

38
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,984
So, Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

39
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,986
Almost finished?

40
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,573
Oh, without doubt he's completing it
at this very moment.

41
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,759
Will. Will!

42
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,220
Where is my play?

43
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,557
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

44
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,060
Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.

45
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,896
No, no, we haven't the time.
Talk prose.

46
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,898
Where is my play?

47
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,526
- It is all locked safe in here.
- God be praised.

48
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,486
Locked?

49
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,906
- As soon as I find my muse.
- Who is she this time?

50
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,908
She is always Aphrodite.

51
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,744
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet?

52
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,914
Henslowe, you have no soul,

53
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,668
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

54
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,670
Ow! Will!

55
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,673
I am a dead man,
and buggered to boot.

56
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,176
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

57
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,179
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

58
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,182
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain's
Men are invited to court...

59
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,185
and receive ten pounds
to play your piece,

60
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,188
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

61
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,190
when you were green
and grateful.

62
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,193
- What piece? Richard Crookback?
- No! It's comedy they want.

63
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,195
Like Romeo and Ethel.

64
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,198
- Who wrote that?
- Nobody. You were writing it for me.

65
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,201
- I gave you three pound a month since.
- Half what you owe me.

66
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,620
I'm still due for
One Gentleman of Verona.

67
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,123
What is money to you and me?
l, your patron, you, my wordwright.

68
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,125
When the plague lifts,

69
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,128
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain.

70
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,130
- I will have nothing for the Rose.
- Mr. Henslowe.

71
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,132
- Will you lend me 50 pounds?
- Fifty pounds?

72
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,135
- What for?
- Burbage offers me a partnership
in the Chamberlain's Men.

73
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,971
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

74
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,100
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

75
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,102
No, then?

76
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,147
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

77
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:41,777
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

78
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,448
And the Rose smells
thusly rank by any name!

79
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:51,161
I say, a plague
on both their houses!

80
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,163
Where are you going?

81
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,332
My weekly confession.

82
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,423
Words, words, words.

83
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,926
Once, I had the gift.

84
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,930
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

85
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,932
Love that overthrows empires.

86
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,435
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

87
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,439
For sixpence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

88
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,943
-But now--
-And yet you tell me you lie with women.

89
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,364
Black Sue,
Fat Phoebe,

90
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,493
Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind--

91
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:34,371
Yes, now and again.
What of it?

92
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,039
I have lost my gift.

93
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,542
I am here to help you.

94
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,044
Tell me,
in your own words.

95
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,677
I-lt's as if
my quill is broken,

96
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,681
as if the organ
of my imagination has dried up,

97
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,310
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

98
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,228
- Interesting.
- Nothing comes.

99
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,189
Most interesting.

100
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,025
It's like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

101
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,739
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

102
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,911
How long has it been?

103
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,081
A goodly length in times past,
but lately--

104
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,585
No, no.
You have a wife, children?

105
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,423
Aye.

106
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,468
I was a lad of 18.

107
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,970
Anne Hathaway was a woman
half as old again.

108
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:35,098
- A woman of property?
- She had a cottage.

109
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:39,937
- One day she was three months
gone with child, so--
- And your relations?

110
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,690
- On my mother's side, the Ardens.
- No, your marriage bed.

111
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,361
Four years and a hundred miles away
in Stratford.

112
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:51,240
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

113
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,242
Banishment was a blessing.

114
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,912
- So, now you are free to love--
- Yet cannot love, nor write it.

115
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:03,460
Here is a-- a bangle...

116
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,047
found in Psyche's temple
on Olympus.

117
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,424
Cheap at fourpence.

118
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:14,429
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

119
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,431
Will it restore my gift?

120
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,935
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

121
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,230
Words will flow like a river.

122
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,232
See you next week.

123
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,736
- Now where?
- To the palace at Whitehall.

124
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,240
All right.

125
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,743
Hello, Will.

126
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,872
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

127
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,750
- You too, good Crab.
- Crab's nervous.
He's never played the palace.

128
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,253
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will?

129
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,673
- I could do it.
- No, they would laugh at Seneca
if you played it.

130
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:53,010
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

131
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,013
- How goes it, Will?
- I'm still owed money
for this play, Burbage.

132
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,515
Not by me.
I only stole it.

133
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,018
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

134
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,520
Where were
my seamstress' eyes?

135
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,482
- When are you coming over
to the Chamberlain's Men?
- When I have 50 pounds.

136
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:11,111
- You writing?
- A comedy. All but done.

137
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,113
A pirate comedy.

138
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,532
- Wonderful.
- Bring it tomorrow.

139
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,328
- It's for Henslowe.
He paid me. Ten pounds.
- You're a liar.

140
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:24,124
- He wants Romeo for Ned
and the Admiral's Men.
- Mmm. Ned's wrong for it.

141
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,668
Will?

142
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,672
- Here's two sovereigns. I'll give you
another two when I see the pages.
- Done.

143
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,674
Burbage, I will see you
hanged for a pickpocket.

144
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,177
The queen has commanded it.
She loves a comedy.

145
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,846
And the Master of the Revels
favors us.

146
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,849
And what favor does Mr. Tilney
receive from you?

147
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,851
- Ask him.
- She comes!

148
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,588
Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.

149
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,882
Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,

150
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,760
were it not affection
chains thy tender days...

151
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,224
When will you write me
a sonnet, Will?

152
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,769
- I've lost my gift.
- You left it in my bed.

153
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,771
Come to look for it again.

154
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,614
Are you to be my muse,
Rosaline?

155
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,784
Burbage has my keeping,

156
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,786
but you have my heart.

157
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,457
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

158
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,459
Will Shakespeare has a play.

159
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,962
Let's go and cough through it.

160
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,967
My father weeping; my mother wailing;

161
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,805
our maid howling;
our cat wringing her hands.

162
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,267
Yet did not this coldhearted cur...

163
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,270
shed one tear--

164
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,118
You see? Comedy.

165
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,164
Love, and a bit with a dog.

166
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,333
That's what they want.

167
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:41,261
He is a stone, a very pebble stone,

168
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:45,349
and has no more pity in him
than a dog!

169
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,352
A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.

170
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:53,315
Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word--

171
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,901
Well played, Master Crab!

172
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,030
I commend you!

173
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,661
What light is light...

174
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,663
if Silvia be not seen?

175
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,375
What joy is joy...

176
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,710
if Silvia be not by?

177
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,713
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

178
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:20,717
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

179
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,222
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

180
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,767
there is no music
in the nightingale.

181
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,770
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

182
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:35,274
there is no day for me
to look upon.

183
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,176
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best?

184
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,179
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

185
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,681
Oh, I liked the dog
for laughs.

186
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,184
Silvia, I did not care for much.

187
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,186
His fingers were red
from fighting...

188
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,522
and he spoke like
a schoolboy at lessons.

189
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,525
Stage love will never be true love...

190
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:23,655
while the law of the land
has our heroines being played
by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

191
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,825
- Oh, when can we see another?
- When the queen commands it.

192
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,827
No, but at the playhouse.
Nurse!

193
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:32,706
Be still.
Playhouses are not for wellborn ladies.

194
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,042
Oh! I'm not so wellborn.

195
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,544
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

196
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:40,047
and well-married
is more so.

197
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,549
Lord Wessex
was looking at you tonight.

198
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,052
All the men at court
are without poetry.

199
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,055
If they see me, they see
my father's fortune.

200
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:51,725
I will have poetry
in my life,

201
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,727
and adventure.

202
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,523
And love.
Love above all.

203
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,525
Like Valentine
and Silvia?

204
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:03,487
No, not the artful postures
of love,

205
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,574
but love that overthrows life.

206
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:11,328
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart,

207
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,749
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

208
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,503
Love as there has never been
in a play.

209
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,507
I will have love,
or I will end my days as--

210
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,509
As a nurse?

211
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,389
Oh, but I would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

212
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:34,518
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

213
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,814
I would stay asleep
my whole life...

214
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:42,818
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

215
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,821
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

216
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,368
Now spit.

217
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,187
This time the boots
are coming off.

218
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,648
- What have I done?
- The theaters have all been
closed down by the plague.

219
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,651
- Oh, that.
- By order of the Master of the Revels.

220
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:29,072
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

221
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:33,160
The natural condition is one
of insurmountable obstacles on
the road to imminent disaster.

222
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,913
- So what do we do?
- Nothing.

223
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,666
- Strangely enough,
it all turns out well.
- How?

224
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,669
I don't know.
It's a mystery.

225
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,671
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

226
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,673
The theaters are reopened...

227
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:50,427
by order of
the Master of the Revels!

228
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,680
The theaters are reopened!

229
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,682
Mr. Fennyman.

230
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,185
Mr. Tilney has reopened
the playhouses.

231
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,562
If you wouldn't mind.

232
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,192
Where's the play?

233
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,111
Oh, it's coming.
It's coming.

234
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,699
It's coming.

235
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,796
Will!

236
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,798
Will, I have wonderful news.

237
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,800
So have l.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

238
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,802
God, I'm good!

239
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,805
Rosaline?
You mean Ethel.

240
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,979
Richard?

241
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,315
Burbage!

242
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,740
Mr. Tilney.

243
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:57,494
Like you,
I found him not at home.

244
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,291
I would've made you immortal.

245
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,672
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

246
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,425
What does Burbage care of that?

247
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,262
He's readying the Curtain
for Kit Marlowe.

248
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,599
- You've opened the playhouses?
- I have, Master Shakespeare.

249
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:21,685
- But the plague--
- Yes, I know.

250
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,688
But he was always
hanging around the house.

251
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,206
The special today is a pig's
foot marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

252
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,167
- served on a buckwheat pancake--
- Will!

253
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,044
Have you finished?

254
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,046
Yes, nearly.

255
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,341
- Good morning, Master Nol.
You will have a nice part.
- Yes!

256
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:56,470
- We'll need Ralph for the pirate king.
- Clear that bloody table!

257
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,641
None other than the Admiral's Men
are out on tour.

258
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,935
I need actors!

259
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:06,939
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

260
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:11,109
- What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
- It won't cost you a penny!

261
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,112
Auditions in half an hour!

262
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,453
Ralph Bagswell,
I'd have a part for you,

263
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,373
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard's drunkard.

264
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,375
Never when I'm working.

265
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,253
Never when I'm working!

266
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,548
Get me to drink mandragora.

267
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,550
Straight up, Will?

268
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,636
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

269
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,930
Kit.

270
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,559
- How goes it, Will?
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

271
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:47,271
- Burbage says you have a play.
- I have, and the chinks to show for it.

272
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,107
I insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

273
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,110
I hear you have a new play
for the Curtain.

274
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,279
Not new.
My Doctor Faustus.

275
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,823
Ah.
I love your early work.

276
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,826
"Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

277
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,453
and burnt the topless towers
of llium?"

278
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:06,456
I have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

279
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,458
The Massacre at Paris.

280
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:13,338
- Whew. Good title.
- Mmm. Yours?

281
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,841
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

282
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,845
Yes, I know. I know.

283
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,847
What is the story?

284
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,683
Well, there's this pirate--

285
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,688
In truth, I have not written a word.

286
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,317
Romeo.

287
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,486
Romeo is ltalian,

288
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,822
always in and out of love.

289
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,116
Yes, that's good.
Until he meets--

290
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,535
- Ethel.
- Do you think?

291
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,079
- The daughter of his enemy.
- The daughter of his enemy.

292
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,373
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

293
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:51,960
by Ethel's brother, or something--
His name is Mercutio.

294
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,962
Mercutio.
Good name.

295
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,466
- Will! They're waiting for you!
- Yes, I'm coming.

296
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,302
Good luck with yours, Kit.

297
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,972
- I thought your play was for Burbage.
- This is a different one.

298
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,058
A different one
you haven't written?

299
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,852
Was this the face...

300
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:11,396
that launched a thousand ships...

301
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,899
and burnt the topless
towers of llium?

302
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,567
Thank you.

303
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,237
Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

304
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,031
- and burnt the top--
topless towers of llium?
- Thank you!

305
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,033
Was this the face...

306
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,703
that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless--

307
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:31,333
I would like to give you something
from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

308
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,669
- How refreshing.
- ...the topless towers of llium?

309
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,880
Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.

310
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,177
W-Was this the f--

311
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:45,389
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

312
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,101
My tailor wants to be an actor.

313
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,603
I have a few debts
here and there.

314
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:53,689
Well, that seems
to be everybody.

315
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,191
- Did you see a Romeo?
- I did not.

316
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,527
Well, I to my work,
you to yours.

317
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,114
Oh, God.

318
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,453
May I begin, sir?

319
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,333
- Your name?
- Thomas Kent.

320
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:18,130
I-l would like to do a speech
by a writer who commands
the heart of every player.

321
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:26,138
What light is light...

322
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,807
if Silvia be not seen?

323
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:34,479
What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by?

324
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,317
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

325
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,653
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

326
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:48,160
Except I be by Silvia
in the night,

327
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,830
there is no music
in the nightingale.

328
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:57,169
Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,

329
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:00,547
there is no day
for me to look upon.

330
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:06,678
She is my essence,
and I leave to be if I be not--

331
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,973
- Take off your hat!
- My hat?

332
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,851
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

333
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,145
- I--
- Let me see you. Take off your hat.

334
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,564
- Are you M-Master Shakespeare?
- Wait there.

335
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,525
Wait there!

336
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,916
- Will, w-where are the pages?
- Where is the boy?

337
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,256
B-B-B-Break a leg!

338
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,887
Sir, will you buy
my sweet orange?

339
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,283
Hey!

340
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,469
Everybody ready? All away!

341
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,724
- Follow that boat!
- Right you are, governor.

342
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:41,815
I know your face.
Are you an actor?

343
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:45,152
- Yes.
- Yes, I think I've
seen you in something.

344
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:48,155
- That one about a king.
- Really?

345
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:51,158
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

346
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:07,633
- Do you know that house?
- Sir Robert De Lesseps.

347
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:21,688
Where is she? Our guests are upon us!

348
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:25,692
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

349
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,779
My husband will have it
settled tonight.

350
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,323
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

351
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:34,618
Tomorrow he drags me off
to the country,

352
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,621
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

353
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,876
God save you, Mother.

354
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,879
Hot water, Nurse.

355
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,884
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

356
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,886
- Who, sir?
- The actor.

357
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,305
- Who asks for him?
- Will Shakespeare.

358
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,391
Poet, playwright of the Rose.

359
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,893
Master Kent...

360
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:03,063
is my nephew.

361
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,065
I will wait.

362
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,568
Much good may it do you.

363
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,240
"Romeo Montague,

364
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,242
a Young Man of Verona."

365
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,244
Verona again?

366
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,246
"A comedy
of quarreling families...

367
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,582
reconciled in
the discovery of Romeo...

368
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:24,084
to be the very same
Capulet cousin...

369
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:27,963
stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...

370
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:32,509
that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king."

371
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,511
Your mother and your father--

372
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,514
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

373
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:40,017
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

374
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,020
- He looks well enough for a charlatan.
- Oh, Nurse!

375
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,022
He would give Thomas Kent...

376
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,024
the life of
Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

377
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,526
My lady, when your parents return,
I will tell.

378
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,528
You will not tell.

379
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,864
As I love you and you love me,

380
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,867
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy's wig.

381
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,000
Master Plum.
What business here?

382
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,002
The five schilling business, Will.

383
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,254
We play for the dancing.

384
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,926
Hyah! Hyah, hyah!

385
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:29,983
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

386
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:33,612
Musicians don't eat.
Sir Robert's orders.

387
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,614
She's a beauty, my lord,

388
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:39,576
as would take a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

389
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,080
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

390
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:46,083
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

391
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,085
when your grandson is a Wessex.

392
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,128
- Is she fertile?
- Oh, she will breed.

393
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:53,966
- If she do not, send her back.
- Is she obedient?

394
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,968
As any mule in Christendom.

395
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:58,971
But if you are the man to ride her,

396
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,973
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

397
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:03,392
I like her.

398
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,455
By all the stars in heaven.

399
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,833
Who is she?

400
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:31,378
Viola De Lesseps? Dream on, Will.

401
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,376
Master Shakespeare.

402
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,344
My lady Viola.

403
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,346
My lord.

404
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,848
I have spoken with your father.

405
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:27,851
So, my lord?
I speak with him every day.

406
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,787
Good sir.

407
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:50,374
I heard you were a poet.

408
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:56,630
A poet of no words?

409
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:03,720
Poet?

410
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:07,933
I was a poet till now, but I've seen
beauty that puts my poems...

411
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,144
at one with the talking ravens
in the Tower.

412
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:14,439
- How do I offend, my lord?
- By coveting my property.

413
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:17,818
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat anon.

414
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,320
Do you have a name?

415
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:23,156
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

416
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,683
Romeo. Romeo.

417
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,686
A Young Man of Verona.

418
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,522
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

419
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,692
- My lady!
- Who is there?

420
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,653
- Will Shakespeare.
- Madam!

421
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:05,157
Anon, good nurse, anon.

422
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:09,870
- Oh, Master Shakespeare.
- The same, alas.

423
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,622
But why "alas"?

424
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,665
- A lowly player.
- Alas, indeed.

425
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:16,460
For I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

426
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,213
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

427
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,715
- Oh, I am him too.
- Madam!

428
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,718
Anon!
I will come again.

429
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:29,765
Oh, I am fortune's fool.
I will be punished for this.

430
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,686
Oh, my lady, my love!

431
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,065
If they find you here,
they will kill you.

432
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:41,652
- You can bring them with a word.
- Oh, not for the world.

433
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,905
- Madam!
- Anon!

434
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:45,924
Draw, if you be men!

435
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:47,926
Gregory, remember thy swashing blow!

436
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:51,430
Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.

437
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:54,433
It starts well, then it's all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

438
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,935
Where's the comedy, Will?
Where's the dog?

439
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,937
Do you think it's funny?

440
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:01,940
I was a pirate king, now I'm a nurse.
That's funny.

441
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:04,860
We are six men short, and those we
have will be overparted ranters...

442
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,362
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

443
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,865
My Romeo's let me down.
I see disaster.

444
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,492
We are four acts short,
if you're looking for disaster.

445
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,494
- Sir!
- Who are you, master?

446
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:18,248
I'm Ethel, sir,
the pirate's daughter.

447
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,250
I'll be damned if you are!

448
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:24,671
Your attention, please!

449
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:28,175
- Gentlemen, thank you!
- You are welcome.

450
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:30,844
- Who's that?
- Nobody. He's the author.

451
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:34,014
We are about to embark
on a great voyage.

452
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:37,518
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

453
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,020
It does no harm.
Authors like it.

454
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,440
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we--

455
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,442
I'll do it.

456
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,945
Now listen to me, you dregs.

457
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,947
Actors are ten a penny,

458
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,867
and l, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

459
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,119
Huzzah!

460
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:59,790
The Admiral's Men
are returned to the house!

461
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:01,875
Huzzah!

462
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:08,215
Henslowe!

463
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,217
Earl! Good to see you.

464
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,222
Who is this?

465
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,225
Silence, you dog!

466
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,186
I am Hieronimo.

467
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,897
I am Tamburlaine.

468
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,233
I am Faustus.

469
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:30,237
I am Barabbas,
the Jew of Malta.

470
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:34,408
Oh, yes, Master Will.
I am Henry the Sixth.

471
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:38,662
What is the play,
and what is my part?

472
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:41,164
- Uh, one moment, sir--
- Who are you?

473
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:45,252
I'm, um--
I'm the money.

474
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,254
Then you may remain,

475
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,256
so long as you remain silent.

476
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,426
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

477
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:56,263
- Thank you, sir.
- We are in desperate want
of a Mercutio, Ned.

478
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,932
A young nobleman of Verona.

479
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,934
- And the title of this piece?
- Mercutio.

480
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:03,604
Is it?

481
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,190
I will play him.

482
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:10,235
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

483
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:12,196
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

484
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,198
Sam, my pretty one!

485
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:18,285
- Are you ready to fall in love again?
- I am, Master Shakespeare.

486
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:20,579
Your voice.
Have they dropped?

487
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:23,081
No! No.
A touch of cold only.

488
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:26,793
Master Henslowe, you have your actors...
except Thomas Kent.

489
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,422
I, uh, I saw his Tamburlaine,
you know.

490
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,424
- It was wonderful.
- Yes, I saw it.

491
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,426
Of course,
such mighty writing.

492
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,595
There's no one like Marlowe.

493
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,319
Better fortune, boy.

494
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:54,321
I was in a play.

495
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,949
They cut my head off
in Titus Andronicus.

496
00:35:57,032 --> 00:36:00,786
When I write plays,
they'll be like Titus.

497
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:02,329
You admire it.

498
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,498
I liked it
when they cut heads off,

499
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:07,501
and the daughter
mutilated with knives.

500
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:09,628
- What's your name?
- John Webster.

501
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,755
Here, kitty, kitty.

502
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:18,428
Plenty of blood.

503
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,430
That's the only writing.

504
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:23,976
I have to get back.

505
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:27,187
See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.

506
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,189
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

507
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:32,693
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.

508
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,695
- Cut around him for now.
- What? Who?

509
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,197
- Romeo.
- The one who came with your letter.

510
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:39,199
- What?
- Good morrow, cousin.

511
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,201
Is the day so young?

512
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:44,454
- But new struck nine.
- Ay me. Sad hours seem long.

513
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:47,457
What sadness
lengthens Romeo's hours?

514
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,960
Not having that which having
makes them short.

515
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:51,962
- Good.
- In love?

516
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,881
- Out.
- Of love?

517
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:57,885
- Out of her favor where I am in love.
- Don't spend it all at once.

518
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,139
Yes, sir.

519
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:05,058
- Do you understand me?
- No, sir.

520
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:08,395
You're speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

521
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,732
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet?

522
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:13,817
- Juliet? You mean Ethel.
- God's teeth!

523
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:17,321
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

524
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:22,159
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

525
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:28,332
I-l'm very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

526
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:31,502
Of course you have not.
I have not written it.

527
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,504
Go once more.

528
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:35,380
Will.

529
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,841
Where is Mercutio?

530
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:40,844
Locked safe in here. I'll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

531
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,846
I have a sonnet to write.

532
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,015
Sonnet?
You mean a play!

533
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:51,563
For Lady Viola De Lesseps,

534
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:55,567
by the hand of Thomas Kent.

535
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:58,403
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

536
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:01,949
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

537
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,621
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May--"

538
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:09,706
Two hours at prayer!

539
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,209
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

540
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,211
Piety is for Sunday!

541
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:17,214
And two hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

542
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:20,133
It would be better
that you return tomorrow, my lord.

543
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:22,970
It would be better if you'd
tell her to get off her knees
and show some civility...

544
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,055
to her six-day
lord and master!

545
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,434
Mmmph!

546
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,984
My lady Viola.

547
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,486
Lord Wessex.
You've been waiting.

548
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,488
I am aware of it.

549
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,658
But it is
beauty's privilege.

550
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,827
You flatter, my lord.

551
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,664
No. I have spoken
to the queen.

552
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:54,001
Her Majesty's consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife,

553
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:57,004
and once given,
her consent is her command.

554
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:59,506
Do you intend to marry,
my lord?

555
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,842
Your father should keep you
better informed.

556
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:04,344
He has bought me for you.

557
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:09,016
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

558
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,310
You are allowed
to show your pleasure.

559
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:15,772
But I do not love you,
my lord.

560
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:18,609
How your mind hops about.

561
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:21,028
Your father
was a shopkeeper.

562
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,488
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

563
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:26,033
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

564
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,035
You will like Virginia.

565
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,704
- Virginia?
- Oh, yes.

566
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:33,874
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

567
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:37,503
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

568
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:40,506
I fancy tobacco
has a future.

569
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:43,550
We will not stay there long.
Three or four years.

570
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:46,053
But why me?

571
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,055
It was your eyes.

572
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,516
No, your lips.

573
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,655
Will you defy your father
and your queen?

574
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:06,657
The queen has consented?

575
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,659
She wants to inspect you.

576
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:11,328
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

577
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:15,749
Be submissive,
modest, grateful...

578
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:17,751
and brief.

579
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:22,339
I will do my duty, my lord.

580
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:31,682
"Master Will, poet dearest to my heart,

581
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:35,686
I beseech you
banish me from yours.

582
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:39,022
I am to marry Lord Wessex.

583
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:42,526
A daughter's duty...

584
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,028
and the queen's command."

585
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:10,387
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

586
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,976
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

587
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:19,313
Are you a lady Mr. Kent

588
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:21,148
I'm very sorry, sir.

589
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:26,653
We're gonna have to do it again.

590
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:30,407
You did not like the speech?

591
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,409
No, the speech is excellent.

592
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:36,163
"Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you."

593
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,498
Excellent,
and a good length.

594
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:42,961
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

595
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,340
There.
You have this duel.

596
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:50,219
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

597
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:55,349
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

598
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:58,185
"A plague
on both your houses!"

599
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,609
He dies?

600
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:11,114
- Ohh!
- Will!

601
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:13,200
Where are my pages?

602
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,381
Did you give her my letter?

603
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:31,176
And this is for you!

604
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:47,401
Oh, Thomas,
she has cut my strings.

605
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,737
I'm unmanned,

606
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,907
unmended and unmade,

607
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:55,909
Iike a puppet in a box.

608
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:58,078
- Writer, is he?
- Row your boat!

609
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,414
She tells me to keep away.

610
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:03,750
She is to marry Lord Wessex!
What should I do?

611
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:06,753
If you love her,
you must do as she asks.

612
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:09,756
- And break her heart and mine?
- It is only yours you can know.

613
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,758
She loves me, Thomas!

614
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:13,760
- Does she say so?
- No.

615
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:16,763
And yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

616
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:20,267
- Was she weeping
when she gave you this?
- Uh--

617
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,103
- Her letter came to me by the nurse.
- Your aunt.

618
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:25,105
Yes, my aunt.

619
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:29,067
But perhaps
she wept a little.

620
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:33,614
Tell me how
you love her, Will.

621
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:37,409
Like a sickness
and its cure together.

622
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:39,995
Oh, yes.

623
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:42,456
Like rain and sun.

624
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:45,125
Like cold and heat.

625
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,045
Is your lady beautiful?

626
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:51,715
Since I came here from the country,

627
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,717
I have not seen her close.

628
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,720
Tell me, is--
is she beautiful?

629
00:43:56,803 --> 00:44:00,516
Thomas, if I could write
with the beauty of her eyes,

630
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:03,477
I was born to look in them
and know myself.

631
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:07,314
A-A-And her lips?

632
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,316
Her lips?

633
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:12,903
The early morning rose would whither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

634
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:15,656
And her voice,
like lark's song?

635
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:18,659
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

636
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:22,329
I would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

637
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:25,082
- Ah, she sings too?
- Constantly.

638
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:28,544
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

639
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:30,671
And her bosom.

640
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:32,923
Did I mention her bosom?

641
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,800
What of her bosom?

642
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,469
Oh, Thomas,
a pair of pippins...

643
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:40,472
as round and rare
as golden apples.

644
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:43,517
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

645
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,020
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

646
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:51,483
when her eyes and lips and voice
may be no more beautiful than mine.

647
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,361
Besides, can a--

648
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:56,822
can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

649
00:44:56,905 --> 00:45:00,158
Iove happily with
a bankside poet and player?

650
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:02,536
Yes, by God!

651
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:05,372
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

652
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:08,625
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king.

653
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,128
Their love
should be minded by each,

654
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:13,881
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

655
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:16,967
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

656
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,969
But what of Lord Wessex?

657
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:22,472
For one kiss I would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

658
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:32,399
Oh, Will.

659
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:36,069
Thank you, my lady.

660
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,406
Lady?

661
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:42,409
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

662
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,703
Wouldn't deceive a child.

663
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:51,084
Strangely enough,
I'm a bit of a writer meself.

664
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:53,754
It wouldn't take you long
to read it.

665
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:56,548
I expect you'd know
all the booksellers!

666
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,059
Can you love a fool?

667
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:09,937
Can you love a player?

668
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:19,613
Wait!

669
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:23,450
You're still a maid,
and perhaps as mistook in me
as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

670
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:26,286
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

671
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,955
I am.

672
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:30,958
Then kiss me again,
for I am not mistook.

673
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:46,932
I do not know
how to undress a man.

674
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:48,934
It is strange to me too.

675
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:04,968
Go to. Go to.

676
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,102
I would not
have thought it.

677
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:18,273
There is something
better than a play.

678
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:20,943
There is.

679
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:23,445
Even your play.

680
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:27,449
Oh?

681
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:31,328
And that was only
my first try.

682
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:49,763
Will.

683
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:54,268
You would not leave me.

684
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:56,770
I must.

685
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:58,772
Look how pale the window.

686
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:00,774
Moonlight.

687
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:03,735
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

688
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:06,905
It was the owl.
Come to bed.

689
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:11,410
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

690
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:15,247
Mr. Henslowe?

691
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,749
Mmm, let him be damned
for his pages.

692
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,751
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

693
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:22,754
There is time. Mmm!
It is still dark.

694
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:25,757
- It's broad day.
The rooster tells us so.
- It was the owl.

695
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:28,135
Believe me, love, it was the owl--

696
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:32,472
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

697
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,936
My lady?

698
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,772
The house is stirring.
It is a new day.

699
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:44,276
It is a new world.

700
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:47,279
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

701
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:49,990
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

702
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:53,285
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

703
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:56,788
and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.

704
00:49:56,872 --> 00:50:00,584
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

705
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,586
Aye, pilgrim.

706
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:05,088
Lips that they must use
in prayer.

707
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:08,342
Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

708
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:10,344
They pray.

709
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:13,847
Grant thou, lest faith
turn to despair.

710
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:17,351
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

711
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,979
It's you.

712
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:23,482
Suffering cats!

713
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:25,651
Then move not...

714
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:28,779
while my prayer's effect
I take.

715
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:36,537
Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.

716
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,373
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

717
00:50:39,456 --> 00:50:44,211
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

718
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:46,922
Yes, yes!
Um, not quite right.

719
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,007
It is more--
Let me.

720
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:52,052
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

721
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:56,431
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

722
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:05,440
- You kiss by the book.
- Well, Will!

723
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:07,609
It was lucky you were here.

724
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:10,112
- Why do not I write
the rest of your play--
- Yes, yes!

725
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:14,408
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph?

726
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,370
Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.

727
00:51:20,163 --> 00:51:22,916
- What is her mother?
- Marry, bachelor,

728
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,586
her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...

729
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:27,880
and a wise and virtuous.

730
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:30,883
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

731
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:34,052
I tell you, he that
can lay hold of her...

732
00:51:34,136 --> 00:51:36,054
shall have the chinks.

733
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:38,140
- Is she a Capulet?
- Mmm.

734
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:41,977
Oh, dear account!
My life is my foe's debt.

735
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,855
Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.

736
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:48,025
Aye, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.

737
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:52,446
Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman?

738
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:54,907
The son and heir
of old Tiberio.

739
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,618
Let it be night.

740
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:01,663
- What's he that follows here
that would not dance?
- I know not.

741
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:03,624
Go ask his name.

742
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:08,795
If he be married,
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

743
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:11,965
No, do not go.

744
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:13,967
I must. I must.

745
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:17,304
- The only son of your great enemy.
- Terrible.

746
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,473
Simply... terrible!

747
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:30,817
"But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

748
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:32,986
It is the east,

749
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,697
and Juliet is the sun.

750
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:40,327
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

751
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,330
who is already sick
and pale with grief...

752
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:47,960
that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she."

753
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:50,838
- Oh, Will.
- Yes, some of it's speakable.

754
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:53,674
"lt is my lady.
Oh, it is my love!

755
00:52:53,757 --> 00:52:56,593
Oh, that she knew she were!

756
00:52:56,677 --> 00:53:00,264
The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...

757
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:02,641
as daylight doth a lamp."

758
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:05,853
Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...

759
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:08,522
stream so bright...

760
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:13,235
that birds would sing
and think it were not night.

761
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:16,989
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

762
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:19,992
Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand,

763
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:22,327
that I might touch
that cheek.

764
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:25,539
- Ay, me.
- "Oh, Romeo.

765
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:27,666
Romeo.

766
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:30,335
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

767
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:34,047
- Deny thy father and--"
- Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

768
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:36,925
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

769
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:39,761
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

770
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:42,222
Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?

771
00:53:43,974 --> 00:53:46,727
"What man art thou that
thus bescreened in night...

772
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:49,521
so stumblest
on my counsel?"

773
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:52,816
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.

774
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,571
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

775
00:53:57,654 --> 00:54:01,116
Had I it written
I would tear the word.

776
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,537
"The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...

777
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:08,790
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

778
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:11,460
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

779
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:14,588
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee."

780
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:19,092
Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.

781
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:23,597
Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.

782
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,974
Would not for the world
they saw thee here.

783
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:28,977
I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

784
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:32,606
- And but thou love me
let them find me here.
- "Good night.

785
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:34,608
Good night,

786
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:37,569
as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...

787
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:40,030
as that within my breast.

788
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:42,324
Oh, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?"

789
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,326
That's my line.

790
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:46,453
Oh. It is mine too.

791
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:49,456
Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

792
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,376
What satifaction
canst thou have tonight?

793
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:55,379
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

794
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:58,924
"My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.

795
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,635
My love is deep.

796
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:04,263
The more I give to thee,

797
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:06,306
the more I have,

798
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,392
for both are infinite."

799
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,936
Madam?

800
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:15,148
- I hear some noise within.
Dear love, adieu.
- Juliet!

801
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:20,153
- "Anon, good nurse."
- Anon, good nurse.
Sweet Montague, be true.

802
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:23,156
"Stay but a little.
I will come again."

803
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,159
Stay but a little.
I will come again.

804
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,662
Oh, blessed, blessed night.

805
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:32,332
"l am afeared...

806
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:36,837
being in night,
all this is but a dream.

807
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,339
Too flattering sweet...

808
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:41,341
to be substantial."

809
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:47,431
To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.

810
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,516
A thousand times,
good night.

811
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,019
A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.

812
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:55,731
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

813
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:58,984
I have no neck in this pig dress.

814
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:06,658
- How is it?
- It's all right.

815
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:13,332
Ned, I know, I know.

816
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:16,335
- It's good.
- Oh?

817
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:19,171
The title won't do.

818
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:21,006
Ah.

819
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:24,551
Romeo and Juliet.
Just a suggestion.

820
00:56:25,761 --> 00:56:27,679
Thank you, Ned.

821
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:35,020
- You are a gentleman.
- And you are
a Warwickshire shit-house.

822
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:37,814
- What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?
- By the hour of nine.

823
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:40,108
I shall not fail.
'Tis 20 year till then.

824
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:42,361
I have forgot
why I called thee back.

825
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:45,155
- You mean no dog of any kind?
- Shh! Silence.

826
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:47,908
The friar marries them in secret,

827
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:50,911
then Ned gets into a fight
with one of the Capulets.

828
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:54,998
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned's way. I mean, in Mercutio's way.

829
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:58,252
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

830
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:00,629
Then the prince
banishes him from Verona.

831
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:03,006
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

832
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,008
on the island
of the pirate king.

833
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:08,971
For God's sake,
cease your prattling and get out!

834
00:57:09,054 --> 00:57:11,515
Get out!

835
00:57:14,184 --> 00:57:16,103
A thousand apologies.

836
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:20,607
Please.

837
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:23,443
And with a silken thread
plucks it back again,

838
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:25,779
so loving-jealous
of his liberty.

839
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:30,909
- I would I were thy bird.
- Sweet, so would l; yet I should
kill thee with much cherishing.

840
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:35,163
Good night.
Good night.

841
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:39,918
Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.

842
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,596
Sunday.

843
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:52,806
'Tis Sunday.

844
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:02,357
I found something
in my sleep.

845
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:06,987
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

846
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:11,074
- But it will end well for love.
- In heaven, perhaps.

847
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:14,077
It is not a comedy
I'm writing now.

848
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:18,874
A broad river
divides my lovers.

849
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:22,127
Family, duty, fate.

850
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:27,758
As unchangeable as nature.

851
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,760
Yes.

852
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:33,805
This is not life, Will.

853
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,934
It is a stolen season.

854
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:38,936
- Be patient, my lord.
- Patient?

855
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:41,897
- Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
- My Lord, I will go--

856
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,067
Sunday. Greenwich!

857
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,489
Now, pay attention, nursie.

858
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:53,075
The queen--
Gloriana Regina,

859
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:56,662
God's chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us--

860
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:59,873
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening's festivities...

861
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:03,126
to bestow her gracious favor
on my choice of wife.

862
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,838
And if we're late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

863
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:10,092
So get you to my lady's chamber
and produce her with or without
her undergarments!

864
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:12,511
You cannot!
Not for the queen herself!

865
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:16,139
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

866
00:59:16,223 --> 00:59:18,684
To be the wife
of a poor player.

867
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:22,646
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

868
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:26,024
And yet I would if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

869
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:28,944
You follow your desire
freely enough in the night.

870
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:32,614
- So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
- Then I'll go with you.

871
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:35,450
- You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
- I know how to fight.

872
00:59:35,534 --> 00:59:38,036
Stage fighting.

873
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,205
Oh, Will.

874
00:59:41,373 --> 00:59:43,792
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you,

875
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:47,212
but as Viola,
the river divides us,

876
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:51,383
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

877
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:54,386
I'll drag her down
by the queen's command!

878
00:59:57,306 --> 00:59:59,308
Good morning, my Lord.

879
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:04,438
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

880
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:08,066
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

881
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:10,611
Are you bringing
your laundrywoman?

882
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:15,699
Her chaperone,
my lady's country cousin.

883
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:19,328
My, but you be
a handsome gallant,

884
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,747
just as she said.

885
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,291
You may call me
Miss Wilhelmina.

886
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:26,793
On a more fortuitous
occasion, perhaps.

887
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:29,713
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

888
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:34,426
Aye, she never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

889
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:09,378
- Now?
- Now.

890
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:12,464
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

891
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:17,678
- Is there a man?
- A man, my lord?

892
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:21,348
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, I think.

893
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:24,309
- Does he come to the house?
- A theater poet?

894
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:27,896
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

895
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,274
- Has he been to the house?
- Marlowe?

896
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:32,651
Oh, yes. He is the one.

897
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:36,280
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

898
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:39,032
That dog!

899
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,842
Your Majesty.

900
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:00,345
Stand up straight, girl.

901
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:05,893
I've seen you.

902
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:09,688
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

903
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:12,357
Your Majesty.

904
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:14,860
What do you love so much?

905
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:17,404
- Your Majesty--
- Speak up, girl!

906
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:19,573
I know who I am.

907
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:23,035
Do you love stories
of kings and queens?

908
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:25,037
Of feats of arms?

909
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,831
Or is it courtly love?

910
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:29,875
I love theater.

911
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:32,920
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed--

912
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:36,632
They're not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And?

913
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,802
And I love poetry above all.

914
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,804
Above Lord Wessex?

915
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:45,432
My lord,
when you cannot find your wife,

916
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:47,935
you better look for her
at the playhouse.

917
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,232
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

918
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:56,652
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

919
01:02:56,735 --> 01:02:58,654
They cannot make it true.

920
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:01,532
Oh, but they can.

921
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:09,081
I mean, Your Majesty, they--
they do not, they have... not,

922
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:11,458
but I believe
there is one who can.

923
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,587
My Lady Viola is young in the world.

924
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:17,631
Your Majesty is wise in it.

925
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:20,717
Nature and truth are the very enemies
of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

926
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:23,679
I thought you were here
because you had none.

927
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,772
- Well, no one will take
your wager, it seems.
- Fifty pounds.

928
01:03:36,441 --> 01:03:38,318
Fifty pounds?

929
01:03:39,862 --> 01:03:44,783
A very worthy sum
on a very worthy question.

930
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:48,245
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

931
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,333
I bear witness to the wager...

932
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:56,545
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

933
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:01,967
I have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

934
01:04:02,885 --> 01:04:05,470
Are there
no more fireworks?

935
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:09,474
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola's audience.

936
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:13,770
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

937
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:17,816
She's been plucked since I saw her last,
