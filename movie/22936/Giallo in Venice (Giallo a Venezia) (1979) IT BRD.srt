1
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,557
Do you want to hear my opinion?

2
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,895
I can only give you details
after the autopsy

3
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,816
My first impression:
The woman drowned.

4
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,195
No traces of violence,
only scratches.

5
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,491
It's a mystery why the perpetrator
pulled her out of the water.

6
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,287
The man was stabbed
with a sharp object.

7
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,999
Difficult to say what it was,
but it wasn't a knife.

8
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,836
Perhaps I know more
after the autopsy.

9
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,508
So? The woman was drowned?

10
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,009
That's for certain?

11
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,513
I think so!
Or do you want to explain my job to me?

12
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,099
But why has he pulled
her out again?

13
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,143
What was going on in his mind?

14
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,020
Perhaps his conscience.
He even called us.

15
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,940
- We found this in his pockets.
- Thank you.

16
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,361
What do you think?
Powdered sugar or drugs?

17
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,490
- Looks like LSD.
- Yes, just what I wanted to hear.

18
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,576
I expect your report
as soon as possible.

19
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,373
Moment, De Pol, I forgot...

20
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,086
- ...The little girl had no underwear.
- At least she won't catch a cold anymore.

21
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,965
Commissario! Commissario!

22
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,176
The coroner wants to see you.

23
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,639
What is your impression, Maestrini?
Do you think it's about drugs?

24
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,933
Yes, obviously.

25
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,772
I am bewildered by the killer's behaviour.

26
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,568
Why does he drown the girl and pull
her out of the water again?

27
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:44,450
Have a little chat with the man there.
He seems the nosy type.

28
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,786
Perhaps he has seen
something that can help us.

29
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,456
Police.
I want to ask you some questions.

30
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,043
Good day.
Come in.

31
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,094
- Good morning.
- My sister. She does not speak.

32
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,929
This way.
I have to sit down.

33
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,188
- Sit down, too, if you want.
- No thanks.

34
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,150
You said you have
questions for me?

35
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,485
It's about the dead victims who
were found by the canal.

36
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,239
- Have you seen anything?
- What a question! Nonsense!

37
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,699
How could I have seen something?

38
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,660
None of the windows faces
this part of the canal.

39
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:32,081
- See for yourself. - We saw you
with binoculars at the window.

40
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,458
Come clean.

41
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,209
What do you mean?

42
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,795
I will not have it!

43
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,966
Do you think because you're
a cop, you can treat me like that?

44
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,760
Please, calm down!
We don't accuse you of anything.

45
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,596
So you have not seen
anything that could help us?

46
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,598
At night I am asleep.

47
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,225
The crime happened in the evening.
It was not dark.

48
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,228
- I was watching TV at that time.
- Of course!

49
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,898
POLICE OF VENICE

50
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,114
- Good morning!
- Good Morning.

51
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:20,088
Flavia and Fabio:
DRUGS

52
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,981
Commissario, I think it's time to quit.

53
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,779
No luck with the old guy?

54
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,907
Not really.
He wasn't helpful.

55
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,371
- Yes?
- Did you read the newspaper?

56
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,374
Good morning, Judge.
How is your wife?

57
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,377
Two drug related murders!
On the first page!

58
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,172
We are in the middle of the tourist season!
I got a call from Rome!

59
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,467
I want the killer caught,
as soon as possible!

60
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:11,514
Don't worry, we're at it.

61
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:16,102
- We have some leads.
- Good! Keep me informed.

62
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,812
Of course.

63
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,649
- The boss wants quick results!
- As always!

64
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,277
Maestrini, tell me something.

65
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,073
- He's crazy!
- The commissioner?

66
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,159
No, no!
The old man at the window.

67
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,202
His apartment is a shit hole!

68
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,079
He lives there with
his retarded sister.

69
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,832
He is paralyzed on one
side and collects garbage!

70
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,209
- Sounds bad!
- You can say that.

71
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,673
Yes? Ah! Doctor!
What do you have for us?

72
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,925
- Cocaine!
- I told you so.

73
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,429
One more thing: The woman had
sex shortly before her death.

74
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,431
But we do not know whether
it was voluntary.

75
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,767
Exactly.
And we do not know with whom.

76
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,269
Glad you are having a good time,
we have a big problem here.

77
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,730
If I can do something
for you, just ask.

78
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,775
- Thank you! Have a nice day.
- Good luck!

79
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,989
- Cocaine!
- Let's inform the boss.

80
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,533
One moment!
Our dead girl...

81
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,369
she had sex
shortly before death.

82
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,872
- Raped?
- We do not know.

83
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,459
- I'm out for Lunch. See you later, Commissario.
- Maestrini!

84
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,711
- Yes?
- It's all about sex!

85
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,005
That could be the key.

86
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,716
- A sex offender?
- No idea.

87
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,219
Throw me an egg.

88
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,857
- Yes, please?
- You whore! Who is with you?

89
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,902
- It's you.
- I know that a man is with you.

90
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,656
I have no time for this nonsense!
Leave me alone.

91
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,164
Who was that?

92
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,625
- What did you say?
- Who was on the phone?

93
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,544
I do not understand.

94
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,420
- It's not important.
- Let me decide that.

95
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,632
- Who was on the phone?
- Nobody! A madman.

96
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,852
Don't lie to me.
Why are you so nervous?

97
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,688
Me? Nervous?
Why do you think that?

98
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,774
You are mistaken.

99
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,612
- Everything is fine.
- Then why you play with your fingers?

100
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,702
You talk already!
Come on!

101
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,709
Excuse me, Inspector!

102
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,257
Tell me.

103
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,469
- You tell me. - I can not believe
that they had to die that way.

104
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,848
So pointless!
So atrocious.

105
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,192
- Who's there?
- Don't you dare hanging up!

106
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,027
I have asked you a question, slut!

107
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,404
I have told you to
leave me alone!

108
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,990
Stop playing games. Answer!

109
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,744
Leave me alone, or
I call the police.

110
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,997
Who's there? Say, who's here!

111
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,498
Hello?

112
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,334
Damn! He hung up.

113
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,669
What did he want?

114
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,838
As I said, it's just a loony.

115
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,299
He just won't leave me alone.

116
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,134
He says he loves me more than anything.

117
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,803
And that he wants to be with me.

118
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,556
- The usual.
- How long has this been going on?

119
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,433
Perhaps a month or more.

120
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,229
- You didn't want to go to the police?
- No!

121
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,772
I was hoping that he gives up.

122
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,322
Bravo! This is the simplest solution.

123
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:01,827
Please tell me something about
the architect and his wife.

124
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,538
Flavia and I were
very good friends.

125
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,666
We grew up together.

126
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,211
We were good friends,
like sisters.

127
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,963
But we lost sight of each other.

128
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,214
I went to university.

129
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,341
She married.
That's the way it is.

130
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,718
Life changes.

131
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,388
You meet other people.

132
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,848
I rarely heard from her.

133
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,393
He won't give up, no?

134
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,397
We met a year ago
in Venice again.

135
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,941
We then saw each other
more frequently again.

136
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,945
Fabio, her husband, and l...

137
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,531
we didn't get along at the beginning.

138
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,741
But then things improved.

139
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,953
We become friends and the three
of us did lots of things together.

140
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,081
The movies, dinner, theater...

141
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,417
Picnic... and so on.

142
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,252
Did you know that
Fabio took drugs?

143
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,171
Nonsense! That's impossible!

144
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,924
Expensive drugs.

145
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,927
- Cocaine!
- This is not possible.

146
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,305
You never noticed anything?

147
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,598
No, never!

148
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,476
Strange...

149
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,729
when a friendship is so tight.

150
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,732
How was it with Flavia?
Did she say anything?

151
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,444
Did she discuss her
relationship with her husband?

152
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,530
About certain sexual acts?

153
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,408
- What does that have to do with anything?
- I think you understand whee I am coming from.

154
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,916
I do not know what you mean.

155
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,668
Are you sure?

156
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,881
Let's assume we did not only find
pornographic pictures.

157
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,967
But also special equipment?

158
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,678
- Oh!
- Marzia!

159
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,057
I won't leave until you
have told me everything.

160
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,893
Okay.

161
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,312
I'm telling you what I know.

162
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,733
Fabio had unusual requests during sex.

163
00:12:55,816 --> 00:13:01,113
He told me that one
day, on the way home.

164
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,898
Come! Let's go in here.

165
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,008
No, over there.

166
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,596
Fabio!

167
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,391
Good night.

168
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,062
Promise me that we never do
anything like this again.

169
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,273
Why not?
You didn't like it?

170
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,485
It's not that.
Don't you understand?

171
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,572
You're always up for a quick number.
What is the problem?

172
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,491
That's not it!

173
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,494
I felt shabby and ashamed.

174
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,413
- What was that?
- You don't want to understand!

175
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,332
Sex needs new stimuli.

176
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,958
Otherwise it gets boring.

177
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,045
Learn to enjoy the moment.
No matter when or where.

178
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,964
Do you love me still?

179
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,884
That has nothing to do
with it, understand!

180
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,350
No!

181
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,115
Fabio!

182
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,733
No!
You bastard!

183
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,361
No!!!

184
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,405
Stop that!

185
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,314
Hurry up! Here is Marzia,
I've tried all day to reach you.

186
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,650
- I need to talk to you, it's important.
- What about?

187
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,652
- Can we meet?
- Fine with me.

188
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,988
- When?
- As quickly as possible.

189
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,491
In the bar, as always.
Don't make me wait.

190
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,535
What happened?

191
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,078
I'll tell you afterwards.
See you soon.

192
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,830
Ciao!

193
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,292
Attention, she's about to leave the house.

194
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,088
Let's get to work.
See you later.

195
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,007
- See you!
- Have a nice day!

196
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,460
I'm warning you, you whore.

197
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,670
Don't you dare hang up again!

198
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,381
Don't call the police.

199
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,259
You're mine, understand?

200
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,928
Do you understand?

201
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,347
I won't let you out
of my eyes all day!

202
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,182
You can't fool me.

203
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,602
The guy who's with you should
keep his fingers away from you.

204
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,105
I won't let you go.

205
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,025
I love you and you love me.

206
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,486
I know it.

207
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,072
I can't stand another man
touching you.

208
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,491
We belong together.

209
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,826
We are meant for each other.

210
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,823
I won't let you stay with that
bunch of perverts.

211
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,741
I'd rather kill you!

212
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,458
So? What's happening?

213
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,751
The police came to see me.

214
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,920
A brash Commissioner.

215
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,798
- Asked many questions.
- A young guy?

216
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,049
Yes.

217
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,801
Do you remember his name?

218
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,512
- No.
- Probably Commissario De Pol.

219
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,472
- You know him?
- Sure.

220
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,892
He was after me for a while
but couldn't prove a thing.

221
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,448
Speaking about proof?
Did you destroy the photos?

222
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,617
No, should I?

223
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,620
Idiot!
You have to get rid of the stuff.

224
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,164
- If you still have them, give them to me.
- You're crazy.

225
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,890
Well, I do what you say.

226
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,644
Marco, you gotta help me.

227
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,687
I'm afraid.

228
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,147
Why? What is it?

229
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:29,233
He's back and threatened me.

230
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,694
He's obsessed.

231
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,071
The student?

232
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,865
Don't take him seriously.
He's a loony.

233
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,868
You do not know him.
He is fanatic, capable of anything!

234
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,330
Want a tip?

235
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,582
Go on vacation!

236
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,126
Get out of Venice, when you can.

237
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,754
I don't want to be in
your skin at the moment.

238
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,932
You were right again.

239
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,686
Sex is always the key.

240
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,814
Always!

241
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,608
Two of those we now know
as corpses.

242
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,195
And from the third
we know the name.

243
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,571
Marzia!

244
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,785
Here we have the
criminal Marco Dezan.

245
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,916
What is missing is the name of this woman.

246
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,044
At first glance, everything
seems clear.

247
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:43,057
I don't know, something smells funny.

248
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,935
Something does not add up.

249
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:52,066
Who could have be interested
in killing this couple?

250
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,319
The drugs are the only motive.

251
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,281
Perhaps they wanted to deal with
it and got bad company.

252
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,077
Get to work! See if the archive
can give us some answers.

253
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,829
Perhaps we're lucky.

254
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,839
Hello!
Do you want to invite me for breakfast?

255
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,924
In exchange I will tell you
everything I know.

256
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,386
Here's an egg!
How did the autopsy go?

257
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,014
No complaints, thank
you for asking.

258
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,600
You should go on stage
with that act.

259
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,976
Really funny!

260
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,312
Come on!
Can I hear your expertise?

261
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,316
The wound looks as if the architect
was stabbed with scissors.

262
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,985
One that is used by tailors.

263
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,237
Or something like that.

264
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,281
At least we know something.

265
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:47,205
Just arrest all tailors in town, then
you'll have your killer.

266
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,499
What's going on?
Are you a photographer now?

267
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,252
- God! Isn't that...?
- Yes, they are.

268
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,213
- And so lively!
- Very funny.

269
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,841
If only we knew why
Flavia was drowned...

270
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,677
and was then pulled out of the water.

271
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,971
This is really strange.

272
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,821
Here!

273
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,536
Ciao!

274
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,038
- Until next time!
- Ciao!

275
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,224
You scared me.
Stop it!

276
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,559
Why are you sneaking in this way?

277
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,143
I waited.

278
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,981
No reason to scare me like that.

279
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,108
- Shall we go?
- Good.

280
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,194
10,000 in advance.

281
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,781
Come on!

282
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,666
Just a quickie?

283
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,298
Get undressed.

284
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,009
Why the sunglasses?

285
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,553
The bright light hurts my eyes.

286
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,557
- Does it bother you?
- What bothers me is that we still talk.

287
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,226
I do prefer standing.

288
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,604
Get up!

289
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,741
The murderer has waited for
her back there.

290
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,576
We found traces everywhere.

291
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,371
- This is the girl of the orgy.
- Right.

292
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,665
Now she has a name.

293
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,625
This is getting weirder and weirder.

294
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,961
Who kills someone
because of an orgy?

295
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:08,924
It is the only connection
between the dead and the hooker.

296
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,968
Where are they?

297
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,970
Do what you're paid to do.

298
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,723
- Calm down.
- This case is driving rne nuts

299
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,851
- Do you think this was the same man?
- That's what I want to know from you.

300
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,519
Give it some effort!

301
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,563
You are the doctor,
I'm only a cop.

302
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,440
- May I?
- Certainly.

303
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,858
Hey, wait!

304
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:29,695
- I'll bet she was killed with scissors.
- You're disturbing me!

305
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,114
No sense of humor.

306
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,533
Anything to say?

307
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,453
Is that supposed to embarrass me?

308
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,372
Today that's not a big deal anymore.
Does it bother you?

309
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,460
I am bothered by people
who want to take me for a fool.

310
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,713
This time you won't get off
the hook that easily.

311
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,720
I am not a moralist, everyone
can do what he wants.

312
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,931
But your orgy is heavy to digest.

313
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,017
Because two of your friends
were killed.

314
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,520
And the hooker died as well.

315
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,730
Satisfied?

316
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,695
There is enough evidence to
connect you with these murders.

317
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,281
With three murders...!

318
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,536
You should start talking.
It's the best for both of you!

319
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,996
Then I'll see what I can do for you.

320
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,332
Why should I have killed them?

321
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,043
Because of the photos?
That's nonsense!

322
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,003
It's a bluff, you have
nothing on me.

323
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,674
- Watch your mouth.
- Okay, okay!

324
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,594
- Can I smoke here?
- Go ahead.

325
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,141
May I say something, Commissario?

326
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,226
If you have to.

327
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:49,692
On the day of the murder and the
night after I was with Ines Amas.

328
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,026
Check into that!

329
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,278
Of course!

330
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:55,573
- And this morning?
- I was also with her.

331
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:06,333
Let me clarify Commissario.

332
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,879
On the day when Flavia and
her husband were killed...

333
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,714
I was not at home.

334
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,550
I had the day off and was
with my mother.

335
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,635
I stay the night there.

336
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,596
I am not surprised to hear that.

337
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,598
It's true.
Ask her.

338
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,516
Give me a break!

339
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,644
Of course, you knew nothing
about any drugs, right?

340
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,521
First time you hear about drugs.

341
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,024
I bet you know where
the stuff comes from.

342
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,067
You just bluffing!

343
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,987
You sold it to Fabio.

344
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,989
You'd never pass on such an opportunity.

345
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,575
You have no evidence, Inspector.

346
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,953
Because I got out of such things
a long time ago.

347
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,288
Maestrini ?!

348
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,581
Come here.

349
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,083
Check the alibis of the two.

350
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:53,672
- How does the ex fit into all this?
- I don't know.

351
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,717
I have to start somewhere,
even if I am wrong.

352
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,720
We have only the tape and
the letter.

353
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,390
And the big boss
wants us to arrest him.

354
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,976
Why not?
It's logical.

355
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,022
The anonymous letter with
the threat of murder.

356
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,901
He mentioned of a "perverse gang".

357
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:18,614
The's what he says. But it doesn't mean
that he killed three people.

358
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:23,494
It is moral fanaticism which
is overwhelmed by reality.

359
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,995
Happens a lot in America.

360
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:29,375
Let's talk about Fabio.
I have to understand his psychology.

361
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,835
This is the key to everything.
I feel it!

362
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,550
Alberto, I need your
opinion as an expert.

363
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,805
How does the coke
and the neurotic fit together?

364
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:48,477
And what's a plausible connection
between perversion and drugs.

365
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,105
I understand, what
are you getting at.

366
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:55,693
But what's the point trying to
understand Fabio's sick personality?

367
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,945
Will it help us catch his killer?

368
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:02,157
What is the connection with his wife's murder
and the death of the hooker?

369
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,326
Please, answer me.

370
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:09,164
Medically speaking, a drug addiction
does not equal perverse fantasies.

371
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,582
Or vice versa.

372
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,793
A pervert always
needs new stimulation.

373
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:17,172
The cocaine can emphasis
such stimulation

374
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,093
but to most, it serves the
same purpose as with all addicts.

375
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,470
They want to compensate
something that is missing.

376
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,431
Filling the void.

377
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:30,686
They are prisoners
of their own dreams.

378
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,480
They don't distinguish between
dream and reality.

379
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,066
They live almost in
another dimension.

380
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,986
What do you think?

381
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,824
- Give that to me!
- What should I think?

382
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,701
I am running in circles.

383
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:50,372
I also can't distinguish
fantasy and reality anymore.

384
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,335
No! Don't!

385
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,003
No!

386
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,716
Stop it! Let me go!

387
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,680
I don't want that!
I don't!!!

388
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,641
No!!!

389
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,025
I do not want that!

390
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,571
If we classify sexual
mania as pathological...

391
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:49,074
and count in all the men who
take it out on their wifes...

392
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,494
we end up with an Italy full
pathological cases.

393
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,040
You really think so?

394
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,170
What are you doing?

395
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,631
(Unintelligible screams of terror
and dialogue in the movie)

396
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,015
- Let's move one further.
- Why?

397
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,267
- Go! 
- Okay.

398
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,561
(On the screen:
No... Let go of me !!!)

399
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:26,612
(Unintelligible screams of terror
and dialogue in the movie)

400
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:34,745
(Unintelligible screams of terror
and dialogue in the movie)

401
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,592
(On the screen:
No, please don't !!!)

402
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,902
(On the screen:
No! Son of a bitch!)

403
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,561
(Unintelligible screams of terror
and dialogue in the movie)

404
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,188
(On the screen: Goodbye sweety!)

405
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:49,069
(Unintelligible dialogue in the movie)

406
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,535
(Unintelligible dialogue in the movie)

407
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,204
(On the screen:
Wait!)

408
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,207
(On the screen:
But you... you...!)

409
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,168
(Unintelligible dialogue in the movie)

410
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,551
(On the screen:
Let me go!)

411
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,562
Commissario, one moment.

412
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:10,275
- There is a woman waiting for you.
She knows something about the dead.

413
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,735
In there.

414
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,784
I'm Commissario De Pol.
You wanted to see me?

415
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,286
- My name is Flora Di Assisi.
- Pleased to meet you.

416
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,538
- Follow me.
- You're so young.

417
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,540
Please, take a seat.

418
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,549
I recognized this young woman.

419
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,594
She always visited the young man.
Always went into the house.

420
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,694
Excuse me?
Do you have a light?

421
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,279
- I don't smoke.
- Not so fast!

422
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,367
Neither do I.
But we could talk about Flavia.

423
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,121
Pretty.

424
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,626
The important thing here are the scissors.

425
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,628
Of course, this makes me a suspect.

426
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,339
But here reality has
exceeded the imagination.

427
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:18,009
I'm an artist.
This is something I won't miss.

428
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:21,763
Whose signature is this?

429
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,473
Bruno Nielson.

430
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,100
You are German?

431
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,643
My father was Dutch.

432
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,437
Listen, I have a lot to do.

433
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,897
Of course!
Don't get angry.

434
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,941
There is no reason.

435
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,445
- Let us be clear.
- That depends on you.

436
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,656
- The whole story?
- If you are okay with that.

437
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:46,788
Well, I met Flavia by chance..
She was on a visit in Venice.

438
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,916
She lived with her parents.

439
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,003
I found her attractive
and we went out together.

440
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:57,924
But it just didn't work out.

441
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,969
Then she met Fabio.

442
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,680
She fell in love with him.

443
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,641
They married quickly.

444
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:09,853
We both were were
just friends afterwards.

445
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,147
But you were still
in love with her?

446
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,607
Yes, that's true.

447
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,359
- Do you think they were happy?
- No.

448
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,987
At first, for a short time, yes.

449
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,072
I understand.

450
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,241
I doubt it.

451
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:29,498
- Then Fabio showed his true colors.
- He was a pervert!

452
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,000
How do you know?

453
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,795
- It's my job.
- Very well!

454
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,173
He wanted her to do
crazy things.

455
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,091
That's why she came to me.

456
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,469
She told me everything.

457
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,555
She trusted me.

458
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,432
I can't stand it, Bruno.

459
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,184
I can't take it anymore.

460
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,186
He's constantly coming up
with new schemes.

461
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,979
He's mad.

462
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,984
You have to leave him.

463
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,947
- You don't stand a chance against him.
- I can't...

464
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,200
I can not...
I love him.

465
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,870
Flavia!

466
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,997
Flavia!

467
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,793
- If you want, I'll kill him!
- Bruno!

468
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,047
A incriminating statement, no?

469
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,925
I swear I would have done it!

470
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:27,347
Signore Nielsen it's not wise to make
statements like that.

471
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,808
But please, continue.

472
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,936
She was desperate.

473
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,313
Fabio, I don't feel
like it now.

474
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,524
Please, do it for me.
Just one more time.

475
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,694
- Please.
- Only today, then never again.

476
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,279
Never again!

477
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,949
Open up!

478
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,704
Go!

479
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,501
- Good morning.
- Come in.

480
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,169
Where should this go?

481
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,884
Help me with it.

482
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,363
Give me the stuff, please?

483
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,858
How old are you?

484
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,653
- 17
- Already a man!

485
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,335
Please go!
I have enough.

486
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,214
Good bye.

487
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,847
You stupid cow!

488
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,653
- Yes, please?
- You were asleep?

489
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,030
- Any news?
- What time is it?

490
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,824
Only 1o.

491
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,077
I took a tablet.
What do you want?

492
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,704
- We need to talk.
- We can do that tomorrow.

493
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,581
It is very important.
This can not wait.

494
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,501
- It's about the conversation today.
- With the Commissario? Go ahead!

495
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,086
Not on the phone!

496
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,588
I'm with you in 1o minutes.

497
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,508
Get up and make some coffee.

498
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,678
- How he treats her.
- Just the right thing to do.

499
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,221
Well, I'm waiting.

500
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,720
Hello! Sit down!

501
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,514
No, please!

502
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,933
Don't you feel like a little lovin'?

503
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,768
Not today, Marco.

504
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,437
I don't feel well.

505
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,523
Talk and then leave.

506
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:13,234
I want to sleep and
never wake up again.

507
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,863
Do you want coffee?

508
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,199
I need something stronger.

509
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,994
- So? What is?
- You have to be more careful.

510
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,039
Regarding what?

511
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,042
Everything.

512
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,586
- What do you mean?
- It's everything you do and say.

513
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,589
You have the cops on your back.

514
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,884
I have nothing to hide!
Better think about your own problems.

515
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,928
That's what I am doing.

516
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,888
Selfish prick.

517
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,098
I could destroy you if
I wanted to.

518
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,185
Watch your mouth!

519
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,937
Pig! I hate you!

520
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:53,358
- I'll teach you some respect.
- Let go of me!

521
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,777
Get your hands off me!
No !!

522
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,572
- No!
- Don't you like my kisses no more?

523
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,074
No!!!

524
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,130
You pig.

525
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,841
You like that, right?

526
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,404
It turns you on.

527
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:24,897
Hello, Marco!

528
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:32,655
Who are you?

529
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:35,116
A good friend of Marzia.

530
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:38,744
What do you want?

531
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,621
Here!

532
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,334
Hold it, or I'll shoot!

533
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,217
Looks like someone settled
an old score.

534
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:01,137
Doesn't look like a professional hit.

535
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,805
The angry ex-boyfriend?

536
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,558
Possible.

537
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,309
Or better: probably!

538
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,854
He left his business card.

539
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:13,023
A 765er.
Long out of fashion.

540
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,234
And he took a bullet.

541
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,944
The guard found traces of blood.

542
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,946
This wasn't done by a contract killer.

543
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,948
The ballistics experts have to
look into this.

544
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,200
Perhaps we can identify the owner.

545
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,454
Good.

546
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,790
One moment.

547
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,881
I'm coming!

548
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,350
- Pervert, you pervert!
- Help, leave me alone!

549
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,729
No !!!... No!

550
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:55,900
- I'll show you!
- Help! No!!!

551
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:01,489
You stay here, you
pervert slut.

552
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,665
Slut! Stay here!

553
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,211
Qpen up! Open!

554
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,252
My dear, I warned you.

555
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,171
I have to do it.

556
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:48,512
I have to do it.
It's for your own good!

557
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:54,888
They never remember to
flip the calender.

558
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:12,197
What a mess!

559
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,934
Poor thing.
Such a terrible death.

560
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,606
When did she die?

561
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,233
Between four and five
o'clock this morning.

562
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,487
Unbelievable.
Pure blood thirst.

563
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,989
Last night he killed Marco.

564
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:55,532
He was shot.

565
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,577
Tonight he kills Marzia in such a sadistic
manner.

566
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,245
A blood rage.

567
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,290
Do you have any doubt
it was the ex-boyfriend?

568
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,793
Idon't know.
I can't think.

569
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:08,128
It's way too early for
my brain to function properly.

570
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:12,299
One thing I don't understand.

571
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:14,301
Why did he drown Flavia?

572
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,678
Why did he pull her out of the water?

573
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:17,930
It makes no sense.

574
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,890
It drives me crazy.

575
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,435
Don't forget:
you're dealing with a madman.

576
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,230
Crazies don't act logical.

577
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,981
I just know that
something is wrong!

578
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,692
The intuition of a policeman.

579
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,822
Five dead, but the first two
do not fit into the picture.

580
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,157
Commissario!

581
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:40,077
Maestrini, what's up?

582
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,705
No prints on the gun.

583
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,583
But we found the owner.

584
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:50,420
He bought the gun
a week ago in Venice.

585
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,214
And what's his name?

586
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:53,674
Andrea Caron.

587
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,594
25 years, studied philosophy.

588
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:00,806
Perhaps he's our man.

589
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:13,527
- What do you want?
- Come! Police!

590
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,656
It's all legal.
We have a warrant for you.

591
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,366
What have I done?

592
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,369
What's with your hand?

593
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,965
- I cut myself on a can.
- Really?

594
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:37,759
May l...?

595
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:49,897
Can, yes?
Doesn't look like it.

596
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:53,525
A gunshot wound.
Beretta 9mm.

597
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:58,113
A gun that's used by the police,
the army...

598
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,532
and many guards.

599
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,914
Like the one you
shot at yesterday.

600
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:10,083
Signore Caron.

601
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:16,882
So if you don't know anything...

602
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:19,676
haven't been there and have
nothing to say.

603
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,598
-...I advise you to call a lawyer.
- No!

604
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:26,725
You are stubborn.

605
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:30,812
As you wish. Just tell us
the whole story.

606
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,649
You are the policeman.
I have nothing to say.

607
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,737
About three months ago...

608
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:40,447
you met a woman.

609
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:43,158
Her name was Marzia.
You were impressed.

610
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,535
You fell in love.

611
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,830
For a while you were a couple.

612
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:51,458
But it did not work.

613
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:55,212
She dropped you.

614
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:58,507
She had enough of you.

615
01:17:58,715 --> 01:18:01,093
That's when you started
calling her, all the time.

616
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,803
You stalked her.

617
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,347
Sent anonymous letters.

618
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:08,600
- Like this one. Do you recognize it?
- No.

619
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:12,521
Read: "l won't leave you with
this pervert bunch..."

620
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:14,773
I'd rather kill you."
Signed

621
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,775
The initial of your name, Andrea.

622
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,360
Andrea Caron!

623
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,320
This doesn't prove anything.

624
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:22,281
It gets better.

625
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:28,078
You followed and watched her.

626
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:31,665
You found out that Marzia
had sex with three friends.

627
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:45,220
Out of sheer jealousy you
decided to kill all five.

628
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:50,767
The prelude was the murder
of Fabio and Flavia.

629
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,688
You killed both by the canal.

630
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:56,815
Then it was the prostitute's turn.

631
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:01,778
Last night you saw Marzia
in bed with Marco.

632
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:06,033
It shocked you.

633
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:09,244
You saw both having sex,
You got so angry.

634
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:12,956
When Marco left, you followed him.

635
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:15,500
Right to the garden of his house.

636
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:19,254
There, you shot him.

637
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,507
But that wasn't good enough!
Then doused him with gasoline.

638
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,633
Am I right?

639
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,093
Then it was Marzia's turn.

640
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:28,180
Where are the scissors you used
to kill Fabio and the hooker?

641
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:30,223
Where is it?

642
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:32,642
Tell me!

643
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,646
- Where is it?
- You are mad!

644
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,065
Totally crazy!

645
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:42,110
Once again forensics
saves the police!

646
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:46,073
Our guys found this
at his apartment.

647
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:53,246
Anything to say?
Never seen it? Start talking!

648
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:55,165
Confess!

649
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:03,340
We were in love!
You'll never understand.

650
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:07,177
I loved her and she loved me!
I know that.

651
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,514
Then she got corrupted.

652
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:11,848
It was awful.

653
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,227
Yes, I was jealous.

654
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,813
Marzia did not
want to leave him.

655
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,816
I was jealous of the hooker.

656
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,069
Jealous of everyone
who touched her.

657
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,071
That's why I killed her.

658
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,114
All three!

659
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:30,659
I don't know who killed the
architect and his bitch.

660
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:32,244
Someone beat me to it.

661
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:35,247
- I don't believe you! You're lying!
- Why should I?

662
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,749
I have told you everything!

663
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,251
Three murders, or five...

664
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:41,545
what difference does it make?

665
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,102
- I believe him.
- Me too, unfortunately.

666
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,312
That was it.

667
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:02,107
Makes three life sentences.

668
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,109
But we're back at the beginning!

669
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,945
Four suspects,
two are now dead...

670
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:10,782
One is behind bars and the
fourth we ruled out

671
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:14,453
Perhaps we underestimated Nielsen.

672
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:17,956
Come in!
Let's start all over again.

673
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:21,501
- Thanks, Caputo.
- Thank you!

674
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,967
Only one remains!

675
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,761
- What, no coffee?
- No!

676
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,059
Suspect four:
Bruno Nielsen.

677
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,606
We should pay him a visit.

678
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,358
Mostly he's home.

679
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:47,319
Works all day.

680
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,113
And then...

681
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,408
At around four he gos to the
newspaper to deliver his work.

682
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,702
- What time is it?
- Almost half past four.

683
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:56,912
Perfect!

684
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,080
What are we waiting for?

685
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,476
Good Evening, Signore Nielsen.

686
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,813
Good evening, Commissario.

687
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:07,691
- What's this?
- No idea.

688
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:11,069
Once you have offered
us a drink...

689
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:14,656
maybe you can tell us what
this is doing in your apartment.

690
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,117
I'll gladly offer you a drink.

691
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:20,120
But I can not tell you where
this thing comes from you.

692
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:24,708
You know exactly what our visit is about.

693
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:33,049
Remember, Fabio was
killed with scissors.

694
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:36,344
You're a comedian.

695
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,432
I forgot.

696
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:43,351
What?

697
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:47,314
That he was stabbed with scissors
that can be found almost everywhere.

698
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:49,649
You think I am a suspect?

699
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:53,361
It's been sitting on my desk for years.

700
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:56,364
I cut paper with it.

701
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:00,076
I doubt that's a punishable offense.

702
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:04,456
- For you, too'?
- No thanks.

703
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:09,711
I don't like it, but I
have to arrest you.

704
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,673
- A bit premature, no?
- Show him the warrant!

705
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:22,515
Very well then!

706
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:27,270
As you wish.

707
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,899
I'm telling you what I know.

708
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:34,694
But I swear...

709
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,698
these scissors were not the murder weapon.
- I'm listening.

710
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:39,908
Good!

711
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,036
There is not much to tell.

712
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:51,211
On the day when it happened,
Flavia called me.

713
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,171
The two had reconciled.

714
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:57,092
He hasn't been mean to her
for quite a while.

715
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,303
They wanted to renovate the apartment.

716
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:04,391
She was looking at fabrics for new curtains.

717
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,310
And they bought the right tools.

718
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:11,231
Also a large pair of scissors.

719
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:18,405
They went shopping at the Giudecca.

720
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:25,078
Flavia thought Fabio
would be window shopping...

721
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:32,127
furniture for the apartment.

722
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:36,423
He was an architect and
had special tastes.

723
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:42,345
Fabio bought the scissors himself?

724
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:46,057
I don't want to speculate.

725
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:48,226
I just said what I know.

726
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:54,149
What you said so far does not
improve your situation.

727
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:59,028
You are the main suspect and you
have a pair of similar scissors!

728
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:04,993
Confess!
You hated Fabio!

729
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:09,080
And you wanted to kill
him, to help Flavia.

730
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:13,126
But why did you kill her?

731
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:15,503
Gosh!

732
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,882
I knew you have a
vivid imagination!

733
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,551
But that's a big fairy tale.

734
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:25,597
I trust the judge's imagination
is less flamboyant.

735
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,057
You are under arrest, Signore Nielsen.

736
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:50,872
I've expected you, Commissario.

737
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,249
I understand, really.

738
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:54,542
Yes.

739
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:59,130
You seem unhappy.
How is the investigation coming along?

740
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,966
We're about to wrap the case.

741
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,720
But you're right.
I'm not convinced.

742
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,223
Very good.

743
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:09,724
What do you mean?

744
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:13,269
There's a piece in the puzzle missing.

745
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:19,108
Something that seals the whole thing.

746
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:24,155
An event of which
no one else knows.

747
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:26,074
That nobody else has seen?

748
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:28,409
Why didn't you say so earlier?

749
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:31,120
No questions!
Just listen!

750
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:35,542
They had a fight, he
wanted to force her to do something.

751
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:36,751
She didn't want to do it.

752
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,587
- You'll like it! Don't be such a prude.
- Let me go!

753
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:44,300
Don't be such a pussy.

754
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,135
Get out!

755
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:55,103
- You have to do that for me!
- No!

756
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:00,275
Please, darling!

757
01:28:02,735 --> 01:28:04,112
Do it for me.

758
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,364
And what about me?

759
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,116
You don't know
what you're asking of me.

760
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:10,827
Just one more time.
This is important for me.

761
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:12,579
Try to understand rne.

762
01:28:12,745 --> 01:28:14,330
You always say that.

763
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:15,832
It's always the same.

764
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,750
But I cannot go on like this.

765
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:21,546
I love you, but I want
to have a normal life.

766
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,173
You're sick.
You need help!

767
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,718
You know yourself that something
is wrong with you, Fabio.

768
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:29,888
Don't act as if I was stupid
and would not understand.

769
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,639
I explore the nature of man.

770
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,224
That hurts.

771
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:36,311
But it is important to set
us free from constraints.

772
01:28:37,186 --> 01:28:38,646
It is not for everyone.

773
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:42,191
Can't you see how
destructive this is?

774
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:45,612
Don't cry!

775
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:50,742
Well, I'll seek medical help.

776
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:53,995
Really?

777
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,207
Tell me that this isn't true.

778
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,168
I promise!

779
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:03,630
But how can a
doctor help me?

780
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,381
Will you try?

781
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:06,507
Of course!

782
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:16,184
But first, you have to do something!

783
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,055
- Well, honey? How much?
- 1o,ooo!

784
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,391
Let's go then!

785
01:30:09,028 --> 01:30:12,740
- Only you? Or your friend as well?
- Leave that up to us. You'll love it.

786
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:18,830
No! Not like this!

787
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,582
- Hold still, bitch!
- No!

788
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:22,750
What are you doing?

789
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:27,046
- Let go of me !!!
- Hold her tight!

790
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,217
I don't want that.
You pigs!

791
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:38,558
No!!!

792
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:40,727
I said I don't want that.

793
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:45,398
No! No!!!

794
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:47,358
That hurts!

795
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:57,076
No...!!!

796
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,038
Stop <i>m</i>

797
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:08,796
Let go of me !!!

798
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,799
Put her on the ground.
Help me!

799
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:17,472
No !!
No!!!

800
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:22,852
No!

801
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,902
Bastards...!

802
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:34,238
Bastards !!!

803
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:15,446
You see...

804
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:30,461
Bye!

805
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:35,049
Now let's get out!

806
01:32:57,029 --> 01:33:00,992
- Good luck, Inspector.
- Thanks, I need it.

807
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:02,827
We're back at the beginning.

808
01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:04,996
We need to find these workmen.

809
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:08,249
- It won't be easy.
- I can help you.

810
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,877
I see them every day
from the window.

811
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:14,422
The work at the port,
not far from here.

812
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:15,923
It will be easy to track them down.

813
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:18,467
We killed nobody!

814
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:20,970
- We didn't do it.
- Why didn't you intervene?

815
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:23,639
Why haven't you called the police?

816
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,308
We were afraid.

817
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:27,268
We did not know
what would happen.

818
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,729
- We wanted to stay out of it.
- I tell you what will happen.

819
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:33,649
I'll lock you up and throw
away the key.

820
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:35,818
Then you can think about
what you have seen!

821
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:38,404
Start talking!

822
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:41,908
I had lost my cigarettes...

823
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,993
so we went back.

824
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:49,957
Stay! I want you!
You're mine.

825
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:53,461
That was an interesting experience right?

826
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:55,880
Now it's my turn!
I want you!

827
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,423
Now you're mine.

828
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:59,008
You're crazy.

829
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:01,010
- I love you!
- You are crazy!

830
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:10,311
I hate you!

831
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:13,814
I hate you!

832
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,114
You bastard!

833
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:38,798
Pay! You pig!

834
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:45,972
No more!

835
01:34:50,434 --> 01:34:52,561
No more!

836
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,899
No more!

837
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:01,320
I can't stand it anymore.
No more!

838
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:09,578
Flavia!

839
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:13,874
Don't do this!

840
01:35:15,626 --> 01:35:17,044
Flavia!

841
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:52,306
Darling.
