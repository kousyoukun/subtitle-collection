1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,090
11:55. Almost midnight.

2
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,720
Enough time for one more story.

3
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,760
One more story
before 12:00...

4
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,240
just to keep us warm.

5
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,210
In five minutes,
it will be the 21st of April.

6
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,480
One hundred years ago,
on the 21st of April...

7
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,420
out on the waters
around Spivey Point...

8
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,190
a small clipper ship
drew toward land.

9
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,930
Suddenly, out of the night,
the fog rolled in.

10
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,940
For a moment,
they could see nothing...

11
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,440
not a foot ahead of them.

12
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,170
Then they saw a light.

13
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,670
By God, it was a fire
burning on the shore...

14
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,240
strong enough to penetrate
the swirling mist.

15
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,730
They steered a course
toward the light...

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,960
but it was a campfire
like this one.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,400
The ship crashed
against the rocks.

18
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,730
The hull sheared in two.

19
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,740
The mast snapped like a twig...

20
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,770
and the wreckage sank
with all the men aboard.

21
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,410
At the bottom of the sea...

22
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,250
lay the ''Elizabeth Dane''
with her crew...

23
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,750
their lungs
filled with salt water...

24
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,420
their eyes open
and staring into the darkness.

25
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,420
And above,
as suddenly as it had come...

26
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,260
the fog lifted...

27
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,100
receded
back across the ocean...

28
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,800
and never came again.

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,110
But it is told
by the fishermen...

30
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,110
and their fathers
and grandfathers...

31
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,550
that when the fog returns
to Antonio Bay...

32
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,540
the men
at the bottom of the sea...

33
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,050
out in the water
by Spivey Point...

34
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,960
will rise up
and search for the campfire...

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,500
that led them
to their dark and icy death.

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,780
Twelve o' clock,
the 21st of April.

37
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,900
It's twelve midnight...

38
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,310
and we just started
into the witching hour.

39
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,710
This is Stevie Wayne,
on top of the world tonight.

40
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,110
And I'll be here
right up until about 1:00.

41
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,780
I'm all through, Father.

42
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,510
Oh, thank you, Bennett.

43
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,280
I won't need you
until four tomorrow, Bennett.

44
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,650
Yes, sir.

45
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,890
Would you like something to
keep you warm on the way home?

46
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,900
No, thank you.
Father, can I get paid?

47
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,970
Why don't you come in at six
instead of four tomorrow?

48
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,170
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,320
Bennett?

50
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,260
It's 59 degrees outside.

51
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,030
And let me be the first
to wish Antonio Bay...

52
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,540
a happy birthday.

53
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,100
We're one hundred years old
today.

54
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,370
The weatherman's
been trying to spoil it for us.

55
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,500
He says we may be
in for some rain tonight.

56
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,750
But from where I'm sitting,
it looks like clear skies.

57
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,580
I think the weatherman's
been working too hard.

58
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,560
Well, I'll stay here
for another hour...

59
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,890
just to see if he's right.

60
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,450
And I'm inviting you
to stay here with me.

61
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,760
There's a cutter run aground
over here on the east bay, over.

62
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,230
Global 1X5.
It's the ''Lady Belle Pacific.''

63
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,460
Serial number 024KL596. Over.

64
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,900
Global 1X5,
the ''Lady Belle Pacific''...

65
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,960
is seaworthy, no major damage.

66
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,560
Why don't you
send a tow on over here...

67
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,600
about a quarter mile
above the Boatel. Over.

68
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,320
This is KAB,
Antonio Bay, California.

69
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,690
Six minutes after midnight.

70
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,960
Haven't heard
from the weatherman yet...

71
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,470
so I can't say for sure
about that rain...

72
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,600
but there's a full moon
and no clouds in the sky.

73
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,600
I'm Stevie Wayne.

74
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,080
And if you don't have anything
to do right now...

75
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,110
I'll be here playing music
all through the witching hour.

76
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,080
Even if you do
have something to do...

77
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,250
keep me turned on for a while...

78
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,090
and I'll try my best
to do the same for you.

79
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,330
OK!

80
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,450
-How far you going?
-Other side of town.

81
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,820
That's close enough.

82
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,490
-Make it?
-Yeah. Thank you.

83
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,670
Sip?

84
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,200
Thanks.

85
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,850
Listen,
I never hitchhiked before.

86
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,980
I just really want
to be careful.

87
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,930
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

88
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,450
Are you weird?

89
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,660
Yes, I am.

90
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,690
Yes, I am weird.

91
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,260
You are weird.
Thank God you're weird.

92
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,140
The last one was so normal,
it was disgusting.

93
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,970
He picked me up
in Santa Barbara.

94
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,170
By the time we got to Carmel
he wanted to marry me.

95
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,870
Oh, yeah. I thought
you never hitchhiked before.

96
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,010
Not before last week.

97
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,920
You're my...

98
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,510
thirteenth ride.

99
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,290
Oh, great. Weird and unlucky.

100
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,960
We'll see.

101
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,230
Look out!

102
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,460
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

103
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,730
-You're sure?
-I think so.

104
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,330
What the hell was--

105
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,010
It's exactly twelve minutes
after midnight...

106
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,910
and this is Stevie Wayne.

107
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,780
Let's get out of here.

108
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,850
I'm high tonight in the KAB
lighthouse on Spivey Point.

109
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,410
And in case you've forgotten,
it's April 21st...

110
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,690
and a happy birthday
for Antonio Bay.

111
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,590
Now, there's a celebration
planned for tonight.

112
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,430
So if you're so excited
about it you can't sleep...

113
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,060
well, stay up with me...

114
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,410
and I'll figure out some way
to keep you occupied.

115
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,600
Or not.

116
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,120
-KAB.
-Hi, sweetheart.

117
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,310
Hi, Dan. What have you got?

118
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,220
Well, I'm just calling
to see if you're lonely...

119
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,480
if there's anything
I can do about it.

120
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,250
Never lonely, Dan.

121
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,560
I thought
you were off work at 8:00.

122
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,990
I changed shifts to make it
to the big party tonight.

123
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,160
Will you be there?

124
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,660
Until I can talk someone else...

125
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,930
into giving up city life
for Antonio Bay, I'm it.

126
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,940
-And ''it'' means day and night.
-Too much work.

127
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,940
That's what I get
for owning a station.

128
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,070
And if you don't tell me
why you called...

129
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,410
in about fifteen seconds,
I'll have to hang up on you.

130
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,920
-Want something to talk about?
-Anything.

131
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,350
I've got a position
on a trawler about...

132
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,050
fifteen miles out
called the ''Sea Grass.''

133
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,650
And I've got
something on my scope--

134
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,590
appears to be a fog bank.

135
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,960
It's about 25 miles out,
moving in their direction.

136
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,730
Thanks, Dan.
That's worth about ten seconds.

137
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,790
I'm on the air. Bye.

138
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,130
Ahoy, maties.

139
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,040
This is KAB, Antonio Bay.

140
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,950
Stevie Wayne here
beaming a signal across the sea.

141
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,220
To the men of the ''Sea Grass,''
fifteen miles out tonight...

142
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,620
a warm hello...

143
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,390
and keep a watch out
for that fog bank...

144
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,220
heading in from the east.

145
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,730
Now, in the meantime...

146
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,390
relax with me
while I play this song...

147
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,060
from the Coupe DeVilles,
dedicated just to you.

148
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,800
Boy, would I like to meet her.

149
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,070
I saw her
at a grocery store one day.

150
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,070
-And?
-You would like to meet her.

151
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,080
She's crazy.
There's no fog bank out there.

152
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,580
What do you know about her?

153
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,940
-She owns that lighthouse.
-I know that.

154
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,740
Her son plays Little League
with my kid brother.

155
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,080
She's a mother?

156
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,750
I thought
you were happily married.

157
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,410
Not that happy.

158
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,250
No fog bank out there.

159
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,800
There's a fog bank out there.

160
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,660
All right. I'm drunk enough.

161
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,640
Let's go back.

162
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,510
All right, all right.

163
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,170
Al, come here.

164
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,520
-Just give him a hand.
-Come here.

165
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,860
What was that?

166
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,620
Come here.

167
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,130
What was that?

168
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,410
It's the generator.

169
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,840
Wha--wha...

170
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,220
Al.

171
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,170
It's gone.

172
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,070
There was just a ship out there.

173
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,740
Al, listen.

174
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,910
Nothing.

175
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,110
-Listen.
-Who's there?

176
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,360
Who is that?

177
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,950
Al, it's right beside us.

178
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,620
It's big, Al. It's a ship.

179
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,420
It's a big ship!

180
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,930
What happened?
Did you get wet?

181
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,950
It's 12:43...

182
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,360
and I've got
four in a row for you...

183
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,660
right here on KAB.

184
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,620
Nothing but water, Stevie.

185
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,620
But it sure beats Chicago.

186
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,430
KAB.

187
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,170
I like what you said...

188
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,500
but for your information,
you lied.

189
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,910
The fog bank
has moved due west...

190
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,570
and probably
missed the ship entirely.

191
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,450
Well, my gauges must be wrong.

192
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,180
I've got a wind blowing
due east.

193
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,780
What kind of a fog
blows against the wind?

194
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,290
-You got me.
-I'm not so sure I want you.

195
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,120
You're just
a voice on the phone.

196
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,460
You're a voice on the radio.
We'd make a perfect couple.

197
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,490
You let me take you to dinner
tonight, I'll prove it to you.

198
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,440
Sorry, Dan.

199
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,700
My idea of perfection
is a voice on the phone.

200
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,440
OK, mystery lady.

201
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,880
-Good night.
-Good night.

202
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,960
Not bad.

203
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,260
I started a week ago
in San Diego...

204
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,710
right up the coast,
five drawings a day.

205
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,540
It'll probably take me a month
to get to Vancouver...

206
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,140
and if I can sell them
for five bucks apiece...

207
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,480
-I'll be rich.
-Yeah.

208
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,290
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

209
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,350
What's your name?

210
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,050
-Elizabeth.
-Nick.

211
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,820
-Hello, Nick.
-Hi.

212
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,690
Is that where you're from,
San Diego?

213
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,130
Wait a minute. You said,
''Can I ask something?''

214
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,360
Well, something,
to me, means one thing.

215
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,070
-San Diego is two things.
-OK.

216
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,800
Pasadena, and a lot of money.

217
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,280
Never a chance to do
anything I want to do.

218
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,150
What do you want to do?

219
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,290
I don't know.

220
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,530
That's OK. Me, neither.

221
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,290
I think I got to have this one.
Can I buy it?

222
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,630
The drawing's free.

223
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,160
It's 1:00, straight up...

224
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,790
the end of the witching hour,
and time for me to sign off.

225
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,770
So until tomorrow night,
at 6 P.M...

226
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,940
when KAB
comes back on the air...

227
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,750
this is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

228
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,690
hoping you have
a nice rest of the night.

229
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,710
Hey, Mom !

230
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,980
Mom, come on. Get up.
Look what I found.

231
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,650
Andy...I love you...

232
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,130
but sometimes
you're a real pain.

233
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,790
Sure, Mom, but look it.

234
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,160
First, it was a gold coin.

235
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,960
Then it turned into
this neat piece of wood.

236
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,560
This is one of those times.

237
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,300
Look at it, Mom.

238
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,470
Good morning, Andrew.

239
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,600
Did you have a nice time
last night?

240
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,630
Yeah. Old Mr. Machen
told us ghost stories.

241
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,410
Did you thank Mrs. Kobritz
for bringing you home?

242
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,740
Yes, ma'am. Mom, can I have
a stomach pounder and a Coke?

243
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,180
-After lunch.
-OK.

244
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,910
I'm gonna go look
for another one.

245
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,450
Maybe this time
I can get the gold coin.

246
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,010
Where the hell is he?

247
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,180
Rolled out of here
at 4:15 yesterday.

248
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,590
-That's the last I saw of him.
-Al said 7:30, right here.

249
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,720
You know Al.
If I were you--

250
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,250
Did you call
the Coast Guard, Hank?

251
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,320
Nick, they probably
got drunk last night.

252
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,230
-No, he wouldn't do that.
-He'd do anything.

253
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,530
Al and I got drunk so many times
I can't count them all...

254
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,870
but we never got so shitfaced
we couldn't make it back in.

255
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,900
He's too good a sailor
to stay out there all night...

256
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,240
and not let somebody know.

257
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,110
-You sound like his wife.
-Just his friend.

258
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,940
-You worry too much, Nick.
-Yeah.

259
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,410
Where are we going?

260
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,420
I'm going to talk Ashcroft
into taking out his boat...

261
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,010
and looking for the ''Sea Grass.''

262
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,520
Who's Ashcroft?

263
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,530
Someone who owes me a favor.

264
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,530
Can I come along?

265
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,030
I thought you had to move on
to Vancouver?

266
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,290
Eventually.

267
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,740
The sheriff
will drive his own car.

268
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,570
The mayor and his wife
are to be picked up at 6:45...

269
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,600
and brought to the mayor's box.

270
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,140
Then we will have speeches
by the mayor...

271
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,050
the sheriff, and me.

272
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,380
-Do you have my notes?
-Yes, ma'am.

273
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,220
Then we will pass out
the candles...

274
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,020
and begin the procession.

275
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,960
Then I will go home
and pass out.

276
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,190
I'm almost afraid to look.

277
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,490
Well...

278
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,370
Not bad. Not bad at all.

279
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,230
A work of art.

280
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,400
Sandy, just be civil to me
for another five hours.

281
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,030
That's all I ask.

282
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,540
Let's see now.

283
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,370
The candles.
Did you order the candles?

284
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,140
What a thought--a candlelight
procession with no candles.

285
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,450
All taken care of.

286
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,750
And the promotional material--
did you get that to Stevie?

287
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,220
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

288
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,020
Sandy, you can be a very
annoying person at times...

289
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,420
but you do keep me together.

290
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,450
Thank you, Mrs. Williams.

291
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,590
...Spivey Point.
As of 1:57 today...

292
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,530
the ''Sea Grass''
had not responded...

293
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,470
to radio communication.

294
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,530
The Coast Guard
has begun a sweep...

295
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,260
south from Watley...

296
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,930
around Arcom Reef...

297
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,130
and should be
in the area of Spivey Point...

298
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,640
in approximately one hour.

299
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,980
Repeating this bulletin
from the Coast Guard...

300
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,980
be on the look out
for the ''Sea Grass''...

301
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,810
a thirty-foot trawler...

302
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:37,290
last seen approximately 15 miles
east of Spivey Point.

303
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,310
If you sight this vessel...

304
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,060
please notify
the Coast Guard immediately.

305
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,180
Nick, can I ask you a question?

306
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,610
Is it always like this?

307
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,620
It's always different.

308
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,670
You're worried, aren't you?

309
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,090
Yeah. She can get real mean.

310
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,490
There.

311
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,700
If I can just get through
the speeches without yawning.

312
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,000
-I couldn't sleep last night.
-Too excited?

313
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,530
No. Al went out on his boat
last night and didn't come home.

314
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,140
-He still isn't back.
-Mrs. Williams!

315
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,610
I called the Coast Guard,
and they said...

316
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,770
''Oh, he might have had
engine trouble.''

317
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,980
They said not to worry.

318
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,650
He was complaining
about his boat last week.

319
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,150
Maybe you ought to go home.

320
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,680
That's the last place
I want to go.

321
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,660
My dog started to bark
at 12:00 last night...

322
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,660
and didn't stop
until 6:00 this morning.

323
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,960
What happened?

324
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,120
He was pointed toward the ocean
and growling.

325
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,330
What does that tell you?

326
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,770
My dog goes crazy and
decides to bark at the water.

327
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,770
I heard the church bells
at midnight...

328
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,600
as I started
to drift off to sleep...

329
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,340
and my car alarm went off
for absolutely no reason.

330
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,940
-Really?
-Woke up the whole block.

331
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,680
This town sits around for
100 years and nothing happens...

332
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,050
and then one night,
the whole place falls apart.

333
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,350
Take this line, too.

334
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,990
Al! Tommy! Dick!

335
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,190
Cabin and steering house
are empty.

336
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,500
Maybe somebody picked them up.

337
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,970
There's water in the generator.

338
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,170
But the deck is dry as a bone.

339
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,560
There you have it.
My next project...

340
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,440
restoration of
the Morgantown Road Cemetery.

341
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,710
It's historical.
Our ancestors are buried here.

342
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,440
-It'll cost a lot.
-Come on. So?

343
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,280
This town should be proud
of its past.

344
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,910
But trying to get
anyone involved...

345
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,390
in community affairs
is like pulling teeth.

346
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,620
Better get
the estimates ready...

347
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,120
for the council meeting
next month.

348
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,280
Yes, ma'am.

349
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,790
Sandy, you're
the only person I know...

350
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,120
who can make ''Yes, ma'am''
sound like ''Screw you.''

351
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,420
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,590
Now, if we'll just say
a little prayer...

353
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,660
asking that
he not be in his cups.

354
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,840
Not a good sign.

355
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,060
Father Malone?

356
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,340
Another bad sign.

357
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,110
You try the study,
and I'll look up front.

358
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,940
-Jesus!
-I'm sorry, Mrs. Williams.

359
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,680
-Mrs. Williams--
-Are you all right?

360
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,810
I have something to show you.

361
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,830
''December 9.

362
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,760
''Met with Blake this evening
for the first time.

363
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,430
''He stood in the shadows...

364
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,270
''to prevent me from getting
a clear look at his face.

365
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,900
''What a vile disease this is.

366
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,900
''He is a rich man
with a cursed condition...

367
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,470
''but this does not
prevent him...

368
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,570
''from trying to better
his situation...

369
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,950
''and that of his comrades
at the colony.''

370
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,200
Every single gauge is broken.

371
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,100
-All the glass is shattered.
-Remind you of something?

372
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,140
-Last night.
-Your truck.

373
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,320
Thermometer's broken.

374
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,820
The mercury's stuck
at twenty degrees.

375
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:48,100
No water got in here,
but something awful cold did.

376
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,270
''December 11.
Blake's proposition is simple.

377
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,750
''He wants to move off
Tanzier Island...

378
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,440
''and relocate the entire colony
just north of here.

379
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,480
''He has purchased
a clipper ship...

380
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,020
''called the 'Elizabeth Dane.'
with part of his fortune....

381
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,860
''and asks only for permission
to settle here.

382
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,090
''I must balance my feelings
of mercy and compassion...

383
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,190
''toward this poor man...

384
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,760
''with my revulsion
at the thought...

385
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,240
''of a leper colony
only a mile distant.''

386
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,460
It's rusted to the wall.

387
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,370
It was on.

388
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,250
They drank a lot of beer
last night.

389
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,910
Every night.

390
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,250
What's it like?

391
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,250
It's always the same.
Room starts spinning--

392
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,480
I mean fishing.

393
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,080
You fish.

394
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,750
The only thing I know
about fishing...

395
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,130
is you use a lot of worms.

396
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,600
Salt water.

397
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,430
She was clean two nights ago.
I checked her out myself.

398
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,800
Now it's as if she's been
turned over in the water.

399
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,070
''April 20.
The six of us met tonight.

400
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,080
''From midnight until 1:00...

401
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,580
''we planned the death
of Blake and his comrades.

402
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,280
''I tell myself
that Blake's gold...

403
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,290
''will allow
the church to be built...

404
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,020
''and our small settlement
to become a township...

405
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,290
''but it does not soothe
the horror that I feel...

406
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:51,000
''being an accomplice to murder.''

407
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,500
Now what?

408
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,600
Wait for the Coast Guard.

409
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,440
I'm sorry.

410
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,750
What for?

411
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,780
Ever since you picked me up,
things have been going wrong.

412
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,880
The clock broke, the windows
have been breaking...

413
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,480
the weirdo at the door
last night.

414
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,760
-That isn't you.
-I'm not so sure.

415
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,590
Things seem to happen to me.

416
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,960
I'm bad luck.

417
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,170
I don't believe in luck,
good or bad.

418
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,470
I don't believe
in anything much...

419
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,470
Something did happen once.

420
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,290
My father was a fisherman.

421
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,780
He ran a trawler
out of Whitely Reef.

422
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,160
One night, late,
he was coming back in.

423
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,220
He was out beyond the reef,
out near Spivey Point.

424
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,960
He looked to windward...

425
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,500
and saw a brig
under shortsail...

426
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,770
heading right for him.

427
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,270
And he radioed.
There was no reply.

428
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,910
Nothing moved on the deck,
but she held her course.

429
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,290
My dad and two of his hands
boarded the brig--

430
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,990
the ''Resa Jane.''

431
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,430
No one was on board.

432
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,430
There was food on the table...

433
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,770
and a hot, steaming
cup of coffee.

434
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,430
But underneath, the tin cup
was rusted to the table.

435
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,880
And then something caught
my father's eye.

436
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:42,410
It was a gold doubloon
minted in Spain, 1867.

437
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,110
My dad picked up the coin,
put it in his breast pocket...

438
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,450
of his jacket,
and zippered it up.

439
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,290
He came home,
told us the story.

440
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:55,920
And he unzippered the pocket
to give me the coin.

441
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,490
It was gone.

442
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,830
I think I'll go
to Vancouver now.

443
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,930
''April 21st. The deed is done.

444
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,640
''Blake followed
our false fire on shore...

445
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,480
''and his ship broke apart
on the rocks off Spivey Point.

446

by an unearthly fog...

''but may the Lord forgive us

451
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,530
I couldn't read any further.

452
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,740
Your grandfather
had a way with words.

453

Our celebration tonight
is a travesty.

454

We're honoring murderers.

00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,050
Father, where did you find this?

478
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,790
My grandfather hid his sins
in the walls.

479
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,290
When did you find it?

480
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,460
Last night,
just after midnight.

481
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,330
What difference does it make?

482
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,200
That's the same time
the rest of the town fell apart.

483
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,310
And the same time
the six conspirators met...

484
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,750
one hundred years ago.

485
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,910
It's really getting late.

486
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,650
There's not much we can do
about any of this.

487
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,380
Are you going to give
the benediction tonight, Father?

488
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,820
Antonio Bay has a curse on it.

489
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,790
Do we take that as a ''no''?

490
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,020
Maybe it's just as well.

491
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,440
We're leaving now, Father.

492
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,500
Will you be all right?

493
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:33,510
I'm going to call Dr. Thayden
and ask him to just drop by.

494
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,570
I think you're taking
all of this much too seriously.

495
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:40,180
We're all cursed,
Mrs. Williams...

496
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,850
all of us.

497
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:59,340
1340 KAB.

498
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,600
Forty-four.

499
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,550
The smooth sound.
Fabulous 1340 KAB.

500
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,810
Forty-five.

501
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:22,990
From the top of the world,
fabulous 1340 KAB...

502
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:26,590
Antonio Bay, California.

503
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,160
Forty-six.

504
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,810
The smooth sound...

505
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:37,470
Something like
an albatross around the neck...

506
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,980
No. More like a millstone...

507
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,820
a plumbing stone, by God.

508
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,220
Damn them all!

509
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,930
Nine.
Every hour on the hour...

510
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,200
KAB news and weather.

511
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,010
Ten.

512
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:12,140
Every hour on the hour,
KAB news and weather.

513
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,720
End side two, KAB promos.

514
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:31,960
How can a man drown
and not touch the water?

515
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,630
He had water in his lungs...

516
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,410
salt water around his mouth,
seaweed in his clothes.

517
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,470
Unless...

518
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,230
You OK?

519
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,140
Did you see his eyes?

520
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,340
Yeah, I saw his eyes.

521
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,490
Andy, the telephone.

522
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,460
I got it, Mrs. Kobritz.

523
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,760
Andy, where did you get
that piece of driftwood?

524
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,400
I told you, Mom.
On the beach this morning.

525
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,930
-Where?
-By the rocks.

526
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,370
What was it doing?

527
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,370
First it was a gold coin...

528
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,500
and then it turned
into the wood.

529
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,600
Andy, I want you
to stay away from the rocks.

530
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:22,770
Do you understand?

531
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,110
Don't pick up anything else
off the beach.

532
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:26,620
It didn't belong to anybody.

533
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,280
I know, honey.
It's all right.

534
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,120
I just don't want you
to pick up anything else...

535
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,250
unless you come
and get me first. OK?

536
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,050
OK.

537
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,960
Is Mrs. Kobritz there?

538
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,960
She just came in.

539
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,400
OK. I have to start
the broadcast now.

540
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,840
Andy, promise me you won't
leave the house tonight.

541
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,630
Oh, Mom.

542
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,800
Promise me.

543
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,210
Oh, OK.

544
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,410
I love you, Andy.

545
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,780
Me, too, Mom. Bye.

546
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,470
Ahoy, maties.

547
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,850
This is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

548
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,840
and KAB, Antonio Bay,
California, is on the air.

549
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,190
I've lined up some tunes
to help you celebrate...

550
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,060
the 100th birthday
of Antonio Bay.

551
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:42,000
So let's get down to business.

552
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,480
What did your mother want, Andy?

553
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,920
Nothing.

554
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,190
It must have been something.

555
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,820
Nothing.

556
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,300
Mrs. Kobritz,
what are those clouds out there?

557
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,900
Evidence of deep
penetrating wounds...

558
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,430
in each ocular orbit...

559
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,940
entering into
the cranial cavity.

560
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,500
Also jagged lacerations
to the face...

561
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,210
Do you want to wait out front?

562
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,120
I'd rather wait with you.

563
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,520
OK.

564
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,540
Thorax has been crushed...

565
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:40,920
and the lungs
are filled with fluid.

566
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,120
Talk to you a minute?

567
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,460
She gonna be all right?

568
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,600
-Did you talk to Simms?
-I got him on the radio.

569
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,470
He's coming back
from Bodega Bay.

570
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:56,970
What the hell
happened out there?

571
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,810
There was rust
all over everything.

572
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,540
It was like the boat had been
out there a long time...

573
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,980
taking on water.

574
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,810
He was down below
near the bunks.

575
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,150
Nick, his wounds
are covered with algae...

576
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,310
his lungs are full...

577
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,380
and there's silt
under his fingernails.

578
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,650
I saw Dick Baxter
three days ago in Salinas.

579
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,060
Now he's lying in there
on the table...

580
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:16,560
looking like he's been
underwater for a month.

581
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,580
-Do you feel that?
-I'll tell you what happens.

582
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:45,020
-It just got cold in here.
-The water acts like ice.

583
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,300
A whole body would take a year
to decompose...

584
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,810
longer if it was down
far enough, cold enough.

585
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,640
But he was on the boat.

586
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,080
He was below decks.

587
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:08,110
No. Dick Baxter
died in the ocean.

588
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,160
You remember those three kids
that went diving...

589
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,540
for that old boat off the Point?

590
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,670
We got to them,
they'd been down for a week...

591
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:31,830
maybe ten days.

592
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,570
I swear to you right now,
he's been down longer.

593
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,730
And while the wrecking
of that beautiful ship...

594
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,070
upon our coast was,
of course...

595
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,130
a tragedy to those
who were on the ship...

596
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,470
it still was the catalyst
that brought together...

597
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:12,570
all of the people
of this wonderful area.

598
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,010
They came together...

599
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,440
they formed the charter
for Antonio Bay...

600
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,540
the charter by which you have
voted for these councilmen...

601
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,170
who sit on my left
and my right tonight.

602
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,220
The Coast Guard's
looking for them.

603
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,550
They're going to cover the area
pretty good...

604
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:33,460
so, really,
all we can do is wait.

605
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,650
I understand, Sheriff.

606
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,190
Thank you.

607
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:41,160
I got to go. I'm up next.

608
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,740
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Williams.

609
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,180
It's funny,
but all I can think about...

610
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:56,450
is my silly dog
barking all night...

611
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,480
and me just wishing
Al would come home.

612
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,790
Now, we can't have
the chairlady...

613
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,320
of the birthday celebration
in tears, can we?

614
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:11,800
I don't think you ought
to go out there.

615
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:15,700
I think that's exactly
what I ought to do.

616
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,970
I appreciate
all your help, Nick.

617
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,340
That's all right.

618
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:39,880
I searched
a long time for this one.

619
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:42,300
I hope you remember it.

620
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,500
Happy 100th, Antonio Bay.

621
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,910
The ceremonies are underway
at Shelby Square.

622
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,840
And we'll have that candlelight
procession in about an hour.

623
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,610
So if you hurry,
you can still make it.

624
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,120
The Coast Guard
dropped me a note.

625
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:03,210
They found the ''Sea Grass''
earlier this afternoon...

626
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,740
but there's no further word...

627
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:08,620
as to the condition of the ship
or the men on-board.

628
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,990
I'll keep you posted
as the news comes in to me.

629
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,860
Hope no one else gets lost
out there in the fog.

630
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,660
I'll be right back.

631
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,980
Hello. My name's Nick Castle.

632
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,810
You don't know me,
but I'm one of the men...

633
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,750
who found the ''Sea Grass''
this afternoon.

634
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,090
I'm sorry.
I don't have any further word.

635
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,490
I understand.
That's not what I called about.

636
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:44,260
You just mentioned something
now on the radio about the fog.

637
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,600
This is going to sound
a little strange, but...

638
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,540
I saw the fog last night...

639
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,100
out in the ocean
in the distance.

640
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,950
It was...glowing.

641
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,220
What seemed to be happening...

642
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,280
is that the wind
was moving due east...

643
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:15,630
and the fog
just kept moving west.

644
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,190
I know that sounds
completely crazy.

645
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,660
Right now it doesn't.

646
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,860
Something happened last night.

647
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,630
At the same time
that fog was moving in...

648
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,660
this whole town went unglued.

649
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,170
Hold on.

650
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,640
I've got some more
birthday music for you...

651
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,550
and a few other surprises.

652
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,850
Then I'll be ready to check in
with the weatherman.

653
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:41,340
And the weatherman will be
ready to check in with you.

654
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,140
-Hello?
-I'm still here.

655
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,500
There's one other thing.

656
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,270
It may have nothing
to do with the ''Sea Grass''.

657
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,370
Anything.

658
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:04,140
My son found a piece
of driftwood this morning.

659
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:13,220
Hey, Mel. How you doing?

660
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,450
Your girlfriend on the radio
has been talking about you.

661
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:18,460
I came in tonight
just to keep her happy.

662
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,090
I thought
you were off tonight.

663
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,290
I love my job.

664
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:24,630
You can tell them all
about that big fog bank...

665
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,330
moving in
the southeast there.

666
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:28,970
-Where?
-You'll see it.

667
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,980
I'm on my way.
See you tomorrow.

668
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:33,000
Yeah, Mel. I'll see you.

669
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:44,410
There you are.

670
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,030
I've got to make a run
out to the lighthouse...

671
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,590
at Spivey Point.
Want to come?

672
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,900
-Sure.
-Come on.

673
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,040
Hi, sweetheart!

674
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,310
I thought you were celebrating.

675
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,150
I couldn't spend an evening
without you.

676
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,850
I'm up in about thirty seconds.
What's new?

677
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:15,050
Another fog bank.

678
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,520
Where?

679
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,820
It's coming in off the ocean
from the southeast.

680
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,620
It's heading inland.
It should be here...

681
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,360
at the weather station
in ten minutes.

682
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,960
Dan, hold on.

683
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,360
I have a special
weather bulletin.

684
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,960
The tri-county
weather station...

685
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,370
reports a fog bank moving
southeast along the coast.

686
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,100
For whoever's interested...

687
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:38,480
that's the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.

688
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:42,510
Repeating--a fog bank is moving
southwest along the coast...

689
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:45,680
toward the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.

690
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,320
Dan, are you still there?

691
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,660
I'm still here.

692
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,720
You sound different tonight...

693
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:58,790
kind of intense.

694
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,460
I just feel like talking,
that's all.

695
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,800
You told me you didn't like
to talk on the telephone...

696
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,640
because you talked
on the radio all day.

697
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:06,870
Dan, where's the fog now?

698
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,810
It should be
right outside my door now.

699
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,780
Hold on.
I'm going to try something.

700
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,550
I can see it.

701
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:24,320
Now, what is the big deal?

702
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,420
You've seen fog once,
you seen it for life.

703
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,490
There's something
different about this fog.

704
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,330
It glows.
Can't you see anything yet?

705
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:34,830
Glows? Oh, I get it.

706
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,840
You take something
to keep you going, right?

707
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:39,540
Does it make you feel
a little weird sometimes?

708
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,510
-Hey.
-What?

709
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,520
The lights went out.

710
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:48,840
Everything's going crazy.

711
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,280
Barometer's falling,
temperature's dropping.

712
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,280
Dan, what is it?

713
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,710
What the hell's that?

714
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,440
Dan, what is it?
What's happening?

715
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:58,950
What is it?
What's happening?

716
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:01,460
Someone's shining a light
through the window.

717
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,790
Dan, listen to me.

718
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,660
Hold on, sweetheart.
I want to check this out.

719
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,630
Dan, stay on the phone!

720
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,980
This has got to be a joke.

721
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:32,480
Someone's at the front door,
sweetheart...

722
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,390
playing a stupid joke.

723
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,120
And whoever it is...

724
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,460
they ain't gonna like
finding me home.

725
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,290
Dan, stay away from the door!

726
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,480
Anybody here?

727
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,290
Some asshole got drunk
and started taking...

728
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,090
this 100-year-old business
too seriously.

729
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:05,110
And so all of us living here
in Antonio Bay today...

730
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,280
owe a great debt
of gratitude...

731
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,760
to those men and women
a hundred years ago...

732
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:12,950
who struggled and sacrificed
to make this town grow...

733
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,690
into what it is today.

734
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:19,190
And it's up to us to keep
their kind of spirit alive.

735
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:25,400
I have an urgent bulletin.

736
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,170
Will Sheriff David Simms please
contact KAB Radio immediately?

737
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:32,270
The number is 555-2131.

738
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,040
This is an emergency.

739
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,550
So we must redouble our efforts,
work together.

740
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,120
We have a vital,
thriving community.

741
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,630
And I say
we have to keep it that way.

742
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:50,700
This is an emergency.

743
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,190
Sheriff David Simms,
please contact KAB immediately.

744
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,970
555-2131.
This is an emergency.

745
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,320
Sheriff Simms?

746
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,130
And so, as we make our way...

747
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,830
to the presentation
of the statue...

748
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:26,170
I think we should all
keep in mind...

749
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,800
the significance
of this night...

750
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,170
for every citizen
of Antonio Bay.

751
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:22,160
We should all proceed
over to the statue.

752
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,260
Single file. Don't push.

753
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,890
Take your time.

754
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:54,100
Start!

755
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,120
Please start!

756
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,270
Why did all the lights go out?

757
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:07,240
One of the lines
are probably down, Andy.

758
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,970
They usually take care
of these things right away.

759
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,710
I think it's kind of neat.

760
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,880
What's that now?

761
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:00,960
Start!

762
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:09,110
Andy! Andy,
get out of the house!

763
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:11,470
Mrs. Kobritz, get him
out of the house! Please! Run!

764
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:14,450
I think maybe we better
close all the windows, Andy.

765
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,180
Are your bedroom windows
closed?

766
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,480
I'll go see.

767
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,780
Someone listen to me!
My son is trapped!

768
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:31,790
887 White Beach Lane!
My son is trapped by the fog!

769
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,120
Andy, get out of the house!
Run!

770
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,690
Wow! Look at that!

771
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,500
Are your windows all closed?

772
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,870
Yes, ma'am.

773
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,460
What about
your mother's bedroom?

774
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,280
Please, someone!
My son is trapped!

775
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,760
Andy, run! Run!

776
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:08,060
Mrs. Kobritz, run!

777
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,890
Andy, I want you
to go to your room.

778
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,490
I think I should stay.

779
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,900
-Right now.
-Yes.

780
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,190
Go to your room.

781
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:41,890
I want to see who it is.

782
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,320
Can't I stay
for two more seconds?

783
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,930
OK, I'm going.

784
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,780
Mrs. Kobritz?

785
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:19,170
Please. My son is trapped!

786
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,100
887 White Beach Lane.

787
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,730
Someone get
to 887 White Beach Lane.

788
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:42,290
My son is trapped!
Get him out of the fog!

789
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,990
Please, someone!

790
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:53,830
My son is trapped!

791
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,680
Come on!
Get out of there, now!

792
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,250
Andy, run! Run!

793
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,730
Come on! Come on.

794
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:22,530
Go! Go!

795
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,080
Come on!

796
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,380
Don't pop it.
Try to ease it out.

797
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:40,980
Oh, Jesus.

798
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,620
Come on, baby!

799
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:52,120
Come on. It'll go.

800
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:53,330
Reverse! Reverse!

801
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,800
Come on!

802
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,710
Come on, do it! Do it!

803
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:30,700
...Stevie Wayne
for the last twenty minutes.

804
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:33,170
I think it's best
we call it a night here.

805
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,680
Another five or ten minutes...

806
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:36,510
everyone will have
seen the statue.

807
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:39,010
All right, but let's get them
through as quickly as we can.

808
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:41,520
Probably be a good idea
if you went home, Kathy.

809
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,180
We can close up here.

810
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,520
I should see it through
to the end.

811
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:46,850
Mrs. Williams,
there's nothing more to do here.

812
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:49,260
Let me take you home.

813
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:52,130
A little annoying,
but you're right.

814
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,290
-Would you please take me?
-Yes, ma'am.

815
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,990
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Thank you.

816
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:04,110
Andy, I don't even know
if you can hear me.

817
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,230
I'm sorry that
I didn't come for you...

818
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,440
that I wasn't there.

819
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,340
Andy, please understand.

820
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:16,020
I have to stay here.

821
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:31,230
The fog is moving inland...

822
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:33,170
away from the beach...

823
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:37,710
towards Antonio Bay.

824
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,840
It's over by the armory.

825
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:48,620
I can't remember the name.

826
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:51,450
No, no--
I think it's Chestnut.

827
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:59,290
Feel like listening
to some music?

828
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,820
Sure.

829
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:03,730
It's moving faster now.

830
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:05,260
Up Regent Avenue.

831
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:07,300
Up to the end
of Smallhouse Road.

832
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:08,770
What is that?

833
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,040
It's just hitting
the outskirts of town.

834
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,070
Broad Street.

835
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,010
Clay Street.

836
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,210
It's moving down 10th Street.

837
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,710
Get inside and lock your doors.
Close your windows.

838
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,980
There's something in the fog.

839
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,890
If you're on the south side
of town, go north.

840
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,890
Stay away from the fog.

841
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,390
Richardsville Pike
up to Beacon Hill...

842
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,800
is the only clear road.

843
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,810
Up to the church.

844
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,930
If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.

845
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:33,220
Now the junction at 101
is cut off.

846
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,710
If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.

847
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,660
It's the only place
left to go.

848
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:41,530
Get to the old church
on Beacon Hill.

849
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:51,500
-It cut us off!
-Where is it?

850
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,270
-Right behind us.
-Quick, inside.

851
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,440
Come on.

852
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,640
Hurry.

853
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,450
Father, is there a basement
or cellar in here?

854
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:06,510
-We can't hide any longer.
-We have to try!

855
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,490
No matter where we go,
it will find us.

856
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:14,620
Is there a basement
or cellar here?

857
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,630
There's a study in back.
I'll show you the way.

858
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,100
Come on. Hurry.

859
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:20,500
Give me that.

860
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:51,500
The fog is sweeping inland.

861
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,840
It's almost like a wall
across the east end of town.

862
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:22,300
Blake and his men
have come for us.

863
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:23,930
-Who's Blake?
-It's in the journal.

864
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:25,100
-What journal?
-I don't know.

865
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,440
-We're cursed.
-What are you talking about?

866
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:30,670
-Where is the journal?
-It's in there.

867
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,080
Over by the window?

868
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:41,140
-It can do us no good now.
-It's all we got.

869
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:42,880
If anything happens,
just lock the door.

870
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,260
Get back. Shut the door.

871
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,700
''Six must die.''

872
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,000
The three men
on the ''Sea Grass''.

873
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,630
And the weatherman is four.

874
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,140
-Mrs. Kobritz.
-Yeah, five.

875
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,640
And one of us makes six.

876
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,300
That's what they want.
They've come back...

877
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,970
for the six
original conspirators.

878
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:37,450
There must be something
in here!

879
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,970
It's me they want.
I am the sixth!

880
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,140
Why would they want you?

881
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,480
Wait, Father.
You didn't read us this.

882
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,490
''Were it possible
to raise the dead...

883
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,820
''I would return Blake's fortune
to him intact...

884
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:48,790
''save the money spent
on these walls that hide it.''

885
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:50,730
''My fellow conspirators
believe...

886
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,750
''that the confiscated fortune
has been stolen...

887
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,420
''from them, when in fact,
I am the thief...

888
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:57,930
''and God's temple
is the tomb of gold.''

889
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:01,500
''I am the thief,
and God's temple--''

890
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,570
Now, wait. Get rid of that.

891
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:09,740
Get out of the way!

892
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:34,310
-Give me a hand.
-Andy, stay right there.

893
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,690
The gold.

894
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:20,920
He melted down the gold
into this.

895
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:26,860
Somebody help her!

896
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,770
Don't go in there!

897
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:25,550
Blake, I have your gold.

898
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,110
Blake?

899
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,130
This is your gold, Blake.

900
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:17,530
My grandfather stole it
from you.

901
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:22,370
I'm the one
who must answer for it.

902
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:38,050
I'm the sixth conspirator.

903
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:43,190
I'm Father Malone.

904
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:45,390
Take me.

905
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,550
Father Malone!

906
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,600
Look.

907
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:16,510
It's going away.

908
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:55,930
I don't know what happened
to Antonio Bay tonight.

909
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,290
Something came out of the fog...

910
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:02,230
and tried to destroy us.

911
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:05,290
In one moment, it vanished.

912
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:08,830
But if this has been
anything but a nightmare...

913
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:12,740
and if we don't wake up to find
ourselves safe in our beds...

914
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,540
it could come again.

915
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:20,020
To the ships at sea
who can hear my voice...

916
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:24,280
look across the water
into the darkness.

917
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,850
Look for the fog.

918
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,480
Why not six, Blake?

919
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,080
Why not me?
