2
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,981
He's arrived.

3
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,747
Sent.

00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,229
Message opening: Sin Kong Restaurant. 2nd floor.

5
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,000
What tea would you like?

6
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,309
Pui erhi tea? Shui sin tea?

7
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,809
Shui sin, OK?

8
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,115
What would you like to order?

9
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,276
Mr. Lee. Mrs. Lee.

10
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,679
Hello.

11
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,221
Morning. Your Honor and Mrs. Lee.
Your table is ready.

12
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,468
I'll make you some prawn dumplings.

13
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,844
Chef, the victim was a barrister.
Her husband is a judge.

14
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,374
Professional hitman, no doubt about it.

15
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,141
Any pictures?

16
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,586
CCTV only caught the top of his head.

17
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,346
Where's Wai?

18
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,889
He just called. He'll be here in half a minute.

19
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,025
What time is it?

20
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,766
Late again, you bastard!

21
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,101
A barrister was killed.

22
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,240
Professional hitman, no pictures yet.

23
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,844
Wake up.

24
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,446
Lock your gun.

25
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,043
Do some exercise.

26
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,153
Why?

27
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,592
He was in a hurry but he still ate so much.

28
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,294
Like a hungry dog.

29
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,139
Can you not smoke at work?

30
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,648
He's just trying to wake himself up.

31
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,911
Why bother coming in if you're half asleep?

32
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,345
Look at yourself!

33
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,382
Take your job seriously!

34
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,889
Drop the attitude with me, young man!

35
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,496
For his father's sake, calm down.

36
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,635
Piece of shit!

37
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,868
What did you see?

38
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,503
Come on. I've told you four times already!

39
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,768
I want to hear it again.

40
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,972
I'm questioning him.

41
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,940
I've told you four times.

42
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,077
Where did the hitman go? Where did he go?

43
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,917
How could I know?

44
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,283
What's he look like?

45
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,615
I didn’t see anything!

46
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:06,916
Nothing?

47
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,987
Twenty-something, dark skin, well built.

48
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,250
I thought you saw nothing?

49
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,830
You're completely useless!

50
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:13,889
Get out!

51
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,757
Get out! Out!

52
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,594
Out!

53
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,662
Get out! Bastard, get out!

54
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,067
What's wrong with you?

55
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,475
I was just questioning the guy.

56
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,909
Cheung was dong it already.

57
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,015
Are you out of your mind?

58
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,143
How can we work together like this?

59
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,520
We're supposed to be a team.

60
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,858
Don't smoke so much.

61
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,538
Don't block the road!
Ether go this way or that way!

62
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,133
What are you doing?

63
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,035
Can you hear me?

64
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,273
Stupid bitch!

65
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,774
I'm just trying to park, sir.

66
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,975
No parking here. Move on.

67
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,515
OK.

68
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,158
You in rush or something?

69
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,188
I have to pick up a customer.
He's waiting for me.

70
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,558
Go!

71
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,912
What is it?

72
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,439
Hello?

73
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,884
Wai thinks he found him.
He's at an eatery nearby.

74
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,018
Chef, it's Fat Lam!
Wai might have found the suspect!

75
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,294
Calm down.

76
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,497
Too many people. Don't start a commotion.

77
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,000
Wait for backup, OK?

78
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,880
Full yet?

79
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,017
Why don't you go to school?

80
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,346
It's not time yet.

81
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,948
Then go early.

82
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,391
Still betting on Man. U? You're not gonna win.

83
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,727
Go now.

84
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:28,241
No! No!

85
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,011
I am negotiator. Lam.

86
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:44,788
Fat Lam. You call me Fat Lam? OK?
We can talk. I'll handle it!

87
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,097
We can talk. I'll handle it!

88
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,825
Stay there! (Cambodian)

89
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,937
Are you Thai? (Thai)
Stay there! (Cambodian)

90
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,529
How are you? (Thai)

91
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,900
Stay there! (Cambodian)

92
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,865
Calm down! (Thai)

93
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,669
Stay there! (Cambodian)

94
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:06,885
Exchange? Swap? (Thai)

95
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,459
Let go of him!

96
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:46,650
Hold your fire! He's giving himself up.
Don't shoot!

97
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:48,882
Don't move!

98
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,054
Hold your fire!
If you shoot him, we'll have nothing!

99
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,026
Put your gun down! Put your gun down!

100
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,260
Wai! Wai!

101
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,925
Stay here. Wai.

102
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,001
Sir! I'll keep an eye on him.

103
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,163
Fuck you!

104
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,636
Still looking?

105
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,080
Scumbag!

106
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,153
Did you call Lam's wife?

107
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,617
I dd.

108
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,092
No matter what, the investigation must go on.

109
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,389
Yes sir.

110
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,516
Who'd want to murder your wife?

111
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:09,852
Answer me!

112
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,121
Did she owe anyone money?

113
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,359
Or was she having an affair?

114
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,163
Was she really so annoying?

115
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,031
Leave him alone!

116
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,166
Think about it.

117
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,474
Mr. Lee, we found this photo
in the killer’s pocket.

118
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,917
It's of your wife.

119
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,951
We found on the photo...

120
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,454
Not just the killer’s fingerprints
and his partner's.

121
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,994
but your fingerprints, too.

122
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,329
You gave this photo to them, didn’t you?

123
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,065
You hired someone to murder your wife.

124
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:56,800
Are any of you marred yet?

125
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,339
We'd been married thirty-something years.

126
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,077
But she still wanted a divorce.

127
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,646
And she wanted to take all my money.

128
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,081
How could I survive?

129
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,549
This is the way to survive.

130
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,492
What's happening with
the suspect's fingerprints?

131
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,669
We're checking.
It takes longer if he's from overseas.

132
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,527
We're printing the sketch of his partner.

133
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,334
The killer can only escape by water.

134
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,033
Block all the wharfs.

135
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,074
Wai! Take the team and ask around.

136
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,476
Get as much info as you can.

137
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,112
Did you hear me? You want me to repeat it?

138
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,376
Wai!

139
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,684
Where are you?

140
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,683
Where the hell are you?

141
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,315
Wait for me.

142
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,494
Wai! What's wrong with you?

143
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,927
Are you tired or something?

144
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,838
135247. Here's $10.000 for Lam's funeral.

145
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,305
Can you add a dollar?
Never donate even numbers for funerals.

146
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:13,741
It'll bring bad luck.
I'll give you a dollar change.

147
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,584
As cops, we're all prepared to risk our lives.

148
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,550
But only when it's worth it.

149
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,252
You don't know what you're dong.

150
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,894
Don't die for nothing. That guy's mad.

151
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,923
We just want you to be safe. We're a team.

152
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,290
Are you finished?

153
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,659
We don't want you to die before your father.

154
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,897
Hey! Your dollar.

155
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,630
Inspector Ti.

156
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,207
I'm Ben. We're from internal affairs.

157
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,037
What do you want?

158
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,115
Do you visit your father every day?

159
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,443
What's it to you?

160
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,480
A year flew by so fast.

161
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,049
Your father is really a good cop.

162
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,553
But I wonder when he'll wake from his coma?

163
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,220
I've read your police statement again and again.

164
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,556
and I just don't understand one thing.

165
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,896
How could a good cop like
your dad be dealing drugs?

166
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,101
Wake up! Questioning you!

167
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,705
Why were you involved in drug dealing?

168
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,003
Answer them! Answer them!

169
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:22,370
Far from our affluent cites.

170
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,482
Cambodia’s poorest children struggle...

171
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,014
We found an English documentary

172
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,413
shot in Cambodia a few years back.

173
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,317
All the kids have the same
neck tattoo as the hitman.

174
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:39,094
Their only money comes
from illegal boxing matches.

175
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:43,598
where they're just the pawns of gamblers.

176
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,676
If he was brought up this way, he's no human.

177
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,010
Killing means nothing to him.

178
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,344
The children are separated from their parents.

179
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:01,344
and barely get a decent meal for days on end.

180
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,879
They have no hope, no fear and no life ahead.

181
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,957
Their only chance of survival
is when another life ends.

182
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,641
Where's the lighter? Go out to cook!

183
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,322
Quick! Cook some food!

184
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,598
This is the mailbox for 92896167.

185
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,132
Please leave a message.

186
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,552
Any more?

187
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,559
No, sir! I swear!

188
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,088
Trust me!

189
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,831
No, sir! No!

190
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,750
Who was the driver this morning?

191
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,982
Who?

192
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,387
Who was it?

193
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,966
No! No! Don't hit me!

194
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,503
Damn you!

195
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,066
Hey! I want to ask you something.

196
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,973
Don't mess about! I've just been beaten up!

197
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:07,846
This morning. Sin Kong Restaurant.
Who was the driver?

198
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,287
I am asking! I am asking!

199
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,819
Thanks, sir!

200
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,822
Is he your friend?

201
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,270
Ignore him.

202
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,731
Call me when you know who the driver was.

203
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,178
We've found the tax! Where's Wai?

204
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:36,771
I'm calling him!

205
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:37,937
Forget about him!

206
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:41,874
Chef Inspector Sum.

207
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,576
How can I help you?

208
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,893
It's already very late.

209
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,636
The chief is looking for you! Where are you?

210
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,029
Hold on. I have another call.

211
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,342
We found the driver. He's at Ping Shan Garage.

212
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,408
You'd better not be fooling me. Funny Eyes!

213
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,752
Hey, what have you done to my car again?

214
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,362
Don't worry about it.

215
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,658
Just hurry up and change the license plates, OK?

216
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,489
Get down!

217
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,166
Run?

218
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:23,981
Leaving? Run! Run!

219
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,013
Where'd the bastard go?

220
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,223
I was just the driver. How would I know?

221
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,290
Tell me!

222
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,425
Speak!

223
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,798
Where'd he go?

224
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,744
He took the phone.

225
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,500
You have one new message.

226
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,477
Where the hell are you?

227
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,923
Do you know internal affairs
is investigating you, not your dad?

228
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,426
Come back quickly!

229
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,888
Where?

230
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,488
Thanks!

231
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,161
Wai took the phone number for checking.

232
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,428
They found the number's address.
It's a landfill.

233
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,200
Quick! Find him!

234
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,396
Quick!

235
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:29,910
I came from far away to find my mother.

236
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:36,109
My mum is dead. My mum is dead.

237
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,288
My dad wouldn't let me go.

238
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:47,194
He wouldn't let me go. He wouldn't let me go.

239
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,656
He wouldn't let me go.

240
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,837
He wouldn't let me go.

241
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:02,204
He wouldn't let me go. He wouldn't let me go.

242
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:12,918
You have to rely on yourself to survive.

243
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,059
Help me!

244
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,575
How come you're here?

245
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,449
Where'd that bastard go? Where'd he go?

246
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,022
He took my car.

247
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,525
Wai! Wait here!

248
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,328
You're messing up everything!

249
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,530
Wai! Stay here! Wai!

250
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:29,404
Don't make things worse!

251
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,016
[San Ka Village Per]

252
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:29,654
Where is he?

253
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,303
Chef, a fat guy inside

254
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:37,731
was shot dead.

255
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,037
I doubt that Wai did it.

256
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:41,333
But the hitman has no gun.

257
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:43,974
Where the hell is he now?

258
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:56,581
How come you guys are here?

259
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:58,283
Where's Wai?

260
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,356
So, something must have happened inside?

261
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:05,794
Don't bother. We'll take a look ourselves.

262
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,770
I'm in charge here. A man was shot inside.

263
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,097
The one who fired the gun could be Wai.

264
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,703
But unless you find evidence.
he's still on my team.

265
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,809
As their head.
I'll be responsible for what happens.

266
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,911
How well do you know your teammates?

267
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,409
You know what we're investigating, don't you?

268
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,484
Who knows if the cop in a coma is good or bad?

269
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,416
What are you implying?

270
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,259
Let's just say we're investigating everything.

271
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,495
I'd love to see a happy ending, too.

272
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,797
Fine. I promise I'll bring Wai to you.

273
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,573
Don't tail us ever again!

274
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,279
I'll find him as soon as possible.

275
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,688
I lost a teammate today.

276
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,522
And I don't want to lose my friend's son!

277
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,447
Boat...

278
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:26,986
Boat...

279
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:57,682
Did Wai come to see you?

280
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:58,591
No!

281
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,617
Did Wai come to see you?

282
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:00,818
No!

283
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:03,424
Did Wai come to see you?

284
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,024
No!

285
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,558
Did you wake up?

286
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,664
Where's Wai? Where?

287
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:12,730
Tell me!

288
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,305
I didn’t say anything about you.

289
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,906
I wasn't thinking clearly
but I didn’t mention you.

290
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:30,550
Let's go to see the chief.

291
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,176
Thank you. Thank you.

292
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,578
You're so nice to me.

293
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,781
How do we find the hitman?

294
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,178
Who?

295
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,452
Where did he go?

296
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,061
Where is he?

297
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,724
Speak up!

298
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,970
Bastard, tell me!

299
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,194
Tell me!

300
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,704
Where is he?

301
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,280
Tell us!

302
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,613
No...

303
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,420
Tell us! No. No.

304
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,084
Tell us!

305
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,552
Tell us!

306
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,196
Who are you looking for exactly?

307
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:45,364
So many people.
How do I know who you're looking for?

308
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,731
Stop it!

309
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,036
How can I do this?

310
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:59,848
Don't hit me. If you wanna find him, stop!

311
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,968
Get out! Out!

312
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,874
Get out! All of you!

313
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,474
Out of my sight!

314
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,810
We're cops. What are we doing?

315
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,085
Our informer is looking for that guy.

316
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:42,991
If you can't wait, you're free to go.

317
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:46,328
We'll get a reply soon.

318
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,660
You believe in him? You seriously believe in him?

319
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,022
Give back my phone!

320
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:50,930
Don't be silly, okay?

321
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,366
Let's go!

322
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,327
I don't know what's right.

323
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:55,526
but I trust him.

324
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,706
So how long do we have to wait?

325
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:03,442
How long must we wait? When do we know?

326
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,551
You keep saying you're looking for other people.

327
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,511
Looking for so many people.

328
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:17,092
Find yourselves first!

329
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:25,067
Not me! Answer the bloody phone!

330
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:28,125
Hello?

331
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,839
OK

332
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:36,938
Your phone is off, right?

333
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,140
Your father woke up.

334
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:46,711
Do you want to talk to him?

335
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,353
Not now.

336
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,256
We've got plenty of time.

337
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,182
(24 hours Clinic)

338
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,622
Damn! I'm in pan!

339
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,424
What the hell are you looking at? Come and help!

340
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,061
What are you staring at? Help him!

341
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:45,670
What is it?

342
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,241
Come here!

343
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,082
[Dentist Lee Ka-lun. Wong Lam-kong]

344
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,396
Hello? Speaking.

345
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,128
We found him!

346
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:12,672
Convulsions and breathing trouble.

347
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,044
Looks like tetanus infection.

348
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,847
(Cambodian) Save her! Save her!

349
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,343
Candy, do we have any medicine in here?

350
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:23,279
No.

351
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,945
Get some tetanus toxoid from next door.

352
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,379
Okay!

353
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:33,062
Inject! Inject! Inject!

354
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:34,924
Inject!

355
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,003
Save her!

356
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:52,874
Save her!

357
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,916
When was she hurt?

358
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:05,285
None of my business.

359
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,961
Boat! Boat!

360
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,799
What is it? What's happening?

361
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:53,599
Put your guns down! Put your guns down!

362
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:54,632
We're police!

363
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,042
So? You needn't do that to workmates!

364
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:57,970
We're after a killer.

365
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,606
What's happening here?

366
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,649
We just received a report.

367
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:04,079
We found an illegal immigrant in the surgery.

368
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,077
She could be an important witness.

369
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:07,646
Carry on investigating.

370
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:19,095
Hey! Wake up!

371
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,296
Where is he? Where is he?

372
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,630
Answer me! Where is he?

373
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,629
I want an answer!

374
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:26,198
What on earth are you two doing?

375
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:26,833
Nothing!

376
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:27,535
She's a patient!

377
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,942
We just want to ask her something. That's all.

378
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,202
Where's he gone?

379
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,772
Where's he gone?

380
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:37,479
Open the door! She's a patient! Don't be rough.

381
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,879
Please come out! Come out!

382
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,718
Tell them to leave.

383
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,917
We'll take over. You can go.

384
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,115
Yes, sir.

385
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:46,990
Tell me where he is!

386
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,927
Wai!

387
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:48,692
Answer me!

388
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,289
Wai! Open the door!

389
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:51,557
You must know where he is!

390
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:52,656
Tell me! Tell me!

391
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:53,994
Let go of her! Let go! She's sick!

392
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,831
Come outside! Come outside!

393
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,472
Relax. Relax, OK?

394
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,632
I am bloody working here!

395
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,439
Did you kill the fat guy at the landfill?

396
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,837
Yes.

397
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:07,744
You needn't do anything. Take him to the station.

398
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,076
Chef, calm down!

399
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:10,478
If you take him back now, he's finished!

400
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,087
If we don't, he's really finished!

401
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,277
Let go of me!

402
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:14,949
Leave me alone! Let go!

403
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:16,715
Let go of me!

404
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:18,482
You bastard!

405
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,096
I'd have shot you long ago
if your dad wasn't my friend!

406
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,528
Why can't you act decently?

407
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,607
As soon as your father woke up, he asked for you.

408
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:34,270
If he sees you in this shape.

409
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,705
he's going to be upset!

410
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:37,843
You're just a piece of shit!

411
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:39,614
You're calling me a piece of shit?

412
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,875
Then what about him?

413
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,548
Do you know how much he hurt me?

414
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,582
Your dear friend.

415
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:50,248
the big hero, my dearest father...

416
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,721
He's none of these!

417
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:54,154
I tell you, he's just a bastard!

418
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,186
What did you say?

419
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,062
He's no good. I'm telling you!

420
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,224
How dare you!

421
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,507
I wish he were a good cop, too.

422
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,210
I only wish he were.

423
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,150
But he wasn't.

424
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,211
He really wasn't at all.

425
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,398
Dad!

426
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:41,133
Inspector Ti!

427
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,771
Constable No. 3721 reporting!

428
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:47,643
You wanna be a cop?

429
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:53,879
Remember...

430
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:55,950
You're not allowed to be a cop.

431
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:02,019
I wasn't a good policeman at all.

432
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:08,935
I hated people calling me a good cop.

433
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,937
It made me feel ashamed.

434
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:18,470
When did you become a cop?

435
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,841
Calm down! People are watching!

436
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,244
How many times have I told you?

437
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,549
Don't be a cop. Find another job.

438
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,176
You didn't even tell me.

439
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,683
Forget it. He just wants to be like you.

440
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,426
Be like me?

441
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,819
You think cops are heroes?

442
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,191
I just want to be a crime fighter!

443
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,521
Can you fight crime?

444
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,933
You get hurt all over just chasing a junkie.

445
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,735
Young men like you will be corrupted
and end up as gangsters.

446
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,668
I won't!

447
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:42,762
You won't? Shut up!

448
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:43,994
Unless you quit now!

449
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,200
Why should I quit? Quiet!

450
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,366
I'll be a good cop for you to see!

451
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,568
In your bloody dreams!

452
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:51,742
What cop doesn't want to crack a big case?

453
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,677
But the first serious criminal my son caught...

454
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,363
was me. Me.

455
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:11,991
You know him?

456
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:19,531
Ignore him.

457
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,200
Check the stuff.

458
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:26,205
Give me your gun!

459
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,642
You're a disgrace to the force!

460
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:30,941
Let go of me!

461
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,581
Let go! Let go!

462
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:47,193
You really hate me, don't you?

463
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,794
The world is like that.

464
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,278
You used to always think I'm a hero.

465
01:06:58,547 --> 01:06:59,605
I'm telling you now.

466
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,442
your father is a thief.

467
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,245
Catch me. Then you'll be a hero yourself.

468
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,613
Look at me clearly, won't you?

469
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,890
If you don't catch me now.

470
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:15,553
then you'd better go and write a good report.

471
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,824
Then you'll have an easier road ahead.

472
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,814
This is the way to survive.

473
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:02,574
People's hero, sacrifices for others.

474
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:06,275
Police role model shot by
drug dealer, falls into coma.

475
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:09,711
I won't tell this lie for him.

476
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,679
How can he be a hero?

477
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,789
Do you know my pan when I fired the gun?

478
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,856
I felt so relieved

479
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:27,763
It's just a kind of relief.

480
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,964
Why didn't he die?

481
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:35,035
Why did I have to bear this lie for so long?

482
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:41,983
It hurts. I'm really sick and tired.

483
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:45,713
His dad was really a selfish bastard.

484
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,953
But now he doesn't have to lie anymore.

485
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:24,615
Hello?

486
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,089
Long time no see.

487
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:35,727
You're welcome.

488
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,202
He's my friend’s son.
Of course I'll look after him.

489
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,038
Don't say this.

490
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,407
Do you want to speak to Wai?

491
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,408
Maybe later.

492
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,185
We've got plenty of time.

493
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:58,124
Let's meet up for a drink later.

494
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:20,640
It was your father.

495
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,942
He just finished his statement
to internal affairs.

496
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:28,882
He turned himself in.

497
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:32,885
I'll go with you to visit him tomorrow.

498
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:40,686
How is she?

499
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,692
I think her wound is badly infected.

500
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,023
We need to send her to hospital now.

501
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,324
No way!

502
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,162
That bastard must come back for her.

503
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,730
She'll die if we don't send her to hospital.

504
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:55,565
Cheung.

505
01:11:56,779 --> 01:11:57,837
You take her to hospital.

506
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:03,107
We'll wait for the mad dog here.

507
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:06,545
You can go.

508
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,125
Hello?

509
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,030
Chef, that guy has been following me.

510
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:12,372
I'm at Tai Kok Tsui Old Market now. Come quickly!

511
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:13,597
Hold on! We'll be right there!

512
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,334
Wai. Kei.

513
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:16,399
Hurry! The mad dog is chasing Cheung!

514
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:00,877
Don't move!

515
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:10,255
Hands up!

516
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,092
Don't move! Hands up!

517
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:14,532
Hands up!

518
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:20,331
Face the wall! Face the wall!

519
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,082
Kei, watch the girl!

520
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,139
Cheung! Hold on!

521
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,742
Get up! Get up!

522
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:56,568
Scumbag! Let him go!

523
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:57,667
Calm down!

524
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,303
Let him go! Let him go!

525
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:00,042
Put her down!

526
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:01,845
If he doesn't let go of Cheung. I'll shoot her!

527
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,006
Calm down!

528
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,518
Bastard! Let him go!

529
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,815
Don't be a fool! Drop your gun!

530
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:08,622
Put your gun down first! Calm down!

531
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,084
Let him go! Let him go!

532
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,318
Don't be a fool! We're the police!
We don't do things like this!

533
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:14,584
No way!

534
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,726
Let go of Cheung! Let go of Cheung!

535
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:10,512
Boat!

536
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:22,023
He has no bullets!

537
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,925
Cheung!

538
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,333
Come here!

539
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:14,642
Bastard! Come out!

540
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:24,142
Come out!

541
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,111
Come out!

542
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,454
How are they?

543
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:56,621
All dead.

544
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,176
I want to talk with my father.

545
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,160
He committed suicide last night.

546
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:35,600
Dad!

547
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:03,551
Dad!

548
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:09,325
Don't call me that.

549
01:26:18,973 --> 01:26:19,962
Who's she?

550
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:21,664
My wife.

551
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:27,272
Your wife? Take her and leave! Don't stay here.

552
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:28,940
You want to get rid of me?

553
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,554
The police want to arrest you.

554
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:37,185
You're useless!

555
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:40,550
Go away!

556
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:43,620
You're just a stray dog.

557
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:47,264
You're all just trash I picked up.

558
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:50,662
I am the master here.

559
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:02,340
Boot him out.

560
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:31,545
Go back to your dog hole and never come back!

561
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:37,348
You're her husband?

562
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:44,621
Your wife has a serous complication.

563
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:50,094
I suggest she have an operation
to take the baby out.

564
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,093
It'd be better for both of them.

565
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,892
How much?

566
01:32:54,135 --> 01:32:55,261
Five million riel.

567
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,797
Even if I don't charge for the operation.

568
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:02,769
the anesthetic alone

569
01:33:03,544 --> 01:33:06,411
costs at least three million reil.

570
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:28,728
Wait here.

571
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:42,848
Why are you here?

572
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:47,945
My wife is pregnant.

573
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:51,149
I need money. Give me assignments.

574
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:16,013
I know you're still in danger.

575
01:34:16,584 --> 01:34:18,449
but I don't have a gun to give you. Take this.

576
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:28,423
Wait for me here. I'll give you a job.

577
01:35:44,171 --> 01:35:45,365
He's back.

578
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:04,157
2... 4... 7

579
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:09,386
I can help you find him, but you must work for me.

580
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:12,890
Fight. Win money.

581
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:36,482
I want to get cash. You want to get him.

582
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,258
I've earned enough. That guy's trouble.

583
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:40,217
I don't want to see him again.

584
01:42:52,266 --> 01:42:55,724
I came from far away to find my mother.

585
01:42:56,670 --> 01:43:00,299
But my mum was dead. Dad wouldn't let me go.

586
01:43:01,775 --> 01:43:04,710
Dad died, you came to take me away.

587
01:43:07,414 --> 01:43:13,353
If I die, you can go. Right?

588
01:45:40,634 --> 01:45:44,627
