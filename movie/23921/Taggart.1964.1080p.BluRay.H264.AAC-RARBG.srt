1
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,500
Coffee's ready.

2
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,900
Now, how about it, Maudie?
Ain't ya...
just a little bit excited?

3
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,100
Oh, a little excited,
a little happy.

4
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,300
Oh, and tired too.

5
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,100
It's just the way
you described it, Ralph.

6
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,500
Where we gonna
put the house?

7
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,700
That's gonna be
just up to you,

8
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,700
but there is a pretty spot
just over that hill there.

9
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,300
There's a brook just a-curvin'
and a-turnin' through it,

10
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,100
with thick green grass,
pretty shade trees...

11
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,900
and soil so rich
you could grow all
the flowers and vegetables...

12
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,500
you had a mind to.

13
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Here comes our boy.
Didn't take him long,
did it?

14
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,900
How'd it go, Son? Fine.

15
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,300
The barbed wire'll
be delivered
in the morning.

16
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,700
The lumber's gonna take
about three more days.That's all right.

17
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,100
- Ma, how about
some coffee?
- Oh. Comin' up.

18
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,900
How'd you like
that little town?

19
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
Well, I learned
a lot of things
you forgot to mention.

20
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,100
Like, for instance?

21
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,300
Like, for instance,
a man by the name
of Ben Blazer.

22
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,900
Ben Blazer?
I believe I met him.
What about him?

23
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,700
Well, he's the biggest man
in Gunsight,

24
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
and right now
he's the maddest.

25
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,300
They say he's boiling
because we're moving
into this range.

26
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Well, he's got no call
to be mad. This range
is all government land.

27
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,300
I filed my papers.
I paid my money.
It's mine. That's the law.

28
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,500
I know, but they--
they say Blazer
thinks he's the law.

29
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,300
And he hires a lot of men--
men who carry these things.

30
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
You tryin'
to say something?

31
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,500
I'm trying to say
we need more men.
Men with guns.

32
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,900
Earl, will you put this
back on the fire?

33
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,500
Yes, ma'am.

34
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Put that thing away.

35
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,500
Here you are.

36
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,500
I'm gonna have
another cup of that too,
Maudie, if it's all right.

37
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,100
Best coffee
in the territory.
Thanks.

38
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,900
There they are--
all those cattle...

39
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,700
belonging to a squatter
who needs a lesson.

40
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,700
He's gonna get spanked hard,
or my name's not Ben Blazer.

41
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,100
I got my paddle, Dad.

42
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,900
All right, men.

43
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,300
Stampede!

44
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,700
Let's go!

45
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,500
Dad!

46
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,300
What have you done?

47
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
You murderer!

48
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,100
You murderer!
You murderer!

49
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,300
You murderer!

50
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Pa? Pa?

51
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I'm hit bad, Son.

52
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Hang on, Pa.
I'll get you
to the doctor.

53
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,700
Well,
what do you think, Doc?

54
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,100
Well, your father's
still alive,
but I don't know how.

55
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,700
I also don't know
how he survived
the ride into town.

56
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,900
I want to talk to you.

57
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,300
Later.Now.

58
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,900
Anything you got
to say to me,

59
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,900
say it when Dad
can hear.

60
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,500
It can't wait.
You're comin' over
to the office with me...

61
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,100
and tell me what happened
this morning.

62
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,900
I heard that, badge man.

63
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,700
I don't like it.

64
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,700
You... wanna keep your job?

65
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,500
You leave my boy alone.

66
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,700
You made
a little mistake.

67
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,900
Only an inch,

68
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,700
but a mistake.

69
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,500
Bob! Son!

70
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,100
- Read it for me, Doc.
- Stranger challenged.
He went for his gun.

71
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,300
What we call
around here a fair fight.

72
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,500
All right, you.
Come with me.

73
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,700
You-- What's your name?

74
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,100
Taggart.

75
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Do I get hanged
or shot in the back?

76
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Taggart, huh?

77
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
I heard what happened
to your father.

78
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,300
Did you hear
what happened
to my mother?

79
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,700
And an old man?

80
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,300
Did you hear that they were
killed by that thing
I shot in there?

81
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,300
No, I didn't know
about that.

82
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Gunsight's
a nice little town.

83
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,300
If your name is Blazer,
you kill who you want,

84
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,100
when you want,
how you want.

85
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Gunsight's a town
run by one man--

86
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,500
Ben Blazer.

87
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,300
If he lives
and you're here,

88
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,300
you'll hang
or get shot in the back.

89
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,100
You, Taggart--
You get outta town.

90
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Now, get beyond all maps
and stay there.

91
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,300
Don't thank me.
Don't say anything.

92
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,700
The longer you talk,
the longer you're in town.

93
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,500
Good-bye.

94
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,300
Send all three telegrams,
Doc.

95
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,500
The one to Jay Jason,

96
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,900
that's the most important.

97
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,300
I just did
something decent, Blazer.

98
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,700
Time for me to retire.

99
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Mornin', stranger.

100
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,700
My name's Jay Jason.

101
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Nice day, huh?

102
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,100
Hadn't thought about it.

103
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,700
Other things on your mind.
I know how that is.

104
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,500
What's the matter,
cut your head?

105
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,100
Did you fall
and hit a rock?

106
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Or maybe
a bullet crease, huh?

107
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,700
I'll take a look
at it for you.

108
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
I'll take care of it.

109
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,100
You're a man
of few words, mister.

110
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,100
Now, me,
I'm just the opposite.

111
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,700
I talk too large
and think too small.

112
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,700
You better watch that cut.
It might infect.

113
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
What do you want?

114
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,300
Mister, you are a man
who minds his own business.

115
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Opposite of me again.

116
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,900
All I wanna know is,
is that the right road
to Gunsight?

117
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,300
- You're on the right road.
- Well, thanks.

118
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,300
I'm obliged.

119
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,700
When you do talk,
you say the words
a man wants to hear.

120
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,700
Now, you take care
of that head of yours,
the only one you got.

121
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,500
If it starts to infect,
trouble.

122
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
How long, Doc?

123
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Hard to say, Ben.

124
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,900
If you rest
and don't get excited,

125
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,900
there might be a miracle.

126
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,900
I don't believe
in miracles.

127
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,100
Howdy, men.

128
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,900
I'm lookin'
for a Mr. Ben Blazer.

129
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
I'm Blazer.

130
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,700
You Jay Jason?

131
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
Most of the time,

132
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
dependin'
on the circumstances.

133
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,100
Glad I didn't stop
for a short beer.

134
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,900
Might have been too late.

135
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,300
These two men
be workin' with you.

136
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,500
Big one's Vince August.

137
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,500
Other's Cal Dodge.

138
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,100
Well, you two purely ain't
the gentle kind.

139
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,900
Three of us, Mr. Blazer.

140
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,300
You got wholesale slaughter
in mind, huh?

141
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,700
Name's... Taggart.

142
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,700
Killed my son.

143
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,900
I want him dead.

144
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
Only one man?

145
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,300
Mr. Blazer, you hollered me
and these two...

146
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,100
to terminate just one man?

147
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,900
Now, that ain't good business.
My time is valuable.
I don't work for whiskey money.

148
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,700
Five thousand dollars...

149
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
for the three of you.

150
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,500
You mind repeatin' that, sir?

151
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,300
Five thousand.

152
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,900
Well, now, Mr. Blazer,

153
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,300
you're clearly
a man of substance,

154
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,100
and I withdraw
what I said before
about, uh--

155
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,300
But we've still got
a little problem here.

156
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,900
Now, a fact's a fact,
right?

157
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
And your, uh--

158
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,500
tenure on this planet
is just about ended.

159
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,900
How are we
gonna collect
our proper pay...

160
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,300
once the job is done?

161
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,300
I thought of that.

162
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,100
I told the banker.

163
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,100
Show him proof,
any evidence
of Taggart's death,

164
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,300
he'll give you the money.

165
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,300
This-- This here's a warrant
for Taggart's arrest.

166
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,100
It says "dead or alive."

167
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,900
You can stop readin'...

168
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,300
when you get to "dead."

169
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,300
Now, you men get out.
Now, Ben, I told you--

170
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,900
Talk quick, Mr. Blazer.
You're dyin' fast.

171
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,700
Taggart--
Where'll we find him?
I don't know.

172
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,900
- Well, what's he look like?
- Young.

173
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,300
Tall. Black hair.

174
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,900
Black hair.

175
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Did he maybe--
now, just maybe--

176
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,500
have a cut on his head...
right here?

177
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
That's him. Kill him!

178
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,100
Kill him. Kill him!

179
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,900
You can die contented,
Mr. Blazer.

180
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,900
Some days are just better
than others.

181
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,900
No question about it.

182
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,700
Tell me something,
Doc.

183
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,700
Is he wearin' his boots?

184
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,700
Get out!

185
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,900
Jason!

186
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,700
Where you two been?
I been waitin'
and waitin' for you.

187
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,700
You're a liar.

188
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Of course. Of course!

189
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,500
But not where money's
concerned.

190
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,900
Now, I ran into Taggart
right here.

191
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,900
Didn't know who he was then,
of course.

192
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
But between the three of us,
we ought to be able...

193
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,100
to run him down
like a stumblin' steer.

194
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,700
Dodge,
you go that way.

195
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,100
And, Augie,
you go that way.

196
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,900
I'll, uh--
I'll try the road
up here.

197
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,500
No.

198
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,500
Between the two of you,
there ain't one ounce of faith
in your fellow man.

199
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,700
You should not even be
inside a place like this.

200
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,900
You are--
Well, you are a lady,
Mrs. Manners.

201
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,900
No lady's as desperate
for work as I am.

202
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,700
Listen to me sing.
In high school they said
I had the prettiest voice--

203
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,100
No. No, please.
For the last time, please.

204
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,900
I haven't got a job for you
because I haven't got
any customers.

205
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,300
Look. Look.

206
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,900
If I had some customers,
I'd giveyou the money.

207
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,100
All of your dancing girls
have left town.

208
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
You couldn't keep
any customers if you had them.

209
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
And I'm supposed to have
pretty limbs-- legs.

210
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,700
No. No. Please!

211
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,900
Look, Mr. Guiness.

212
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,900
A good day to you, senor.
What is your pleasure?

213
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,900
Whiskey.

214
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,700
This, uh, town
is nailed tighter
than a strongbox.

215
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Where can I get
some food supplies?

216
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,300
Oh, I can sell you
a little coffee, jerky--
things like that.

217
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,500
Thanks. What hit
this town anyway,
an epidemic?

218
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,100
The same thing-- Apaches.

219
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,700
Those Apaches are raiding,
burning, killing,

220
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,700
and they are supposed
to be coming this way.

221
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,300
You would not like to buy
a cantina real cheap, huh?

222
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,500
I'm afraid to make
an offer.

223
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,100
You'd take it.I would. Oh, I would.

224
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Senor, I got no bartenders,
no girls, no customers.

225
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,900
Things are so bad--

226
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,300
My, you're tall
and handsome.

227
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,300
Only you look like
all your puppies
got distemper.

228
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,100
Buy me a drink
and I'll listen
to your troubles.

229
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,900
If I buy a drink,
maybe I'll forget them.

230
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,700
What's your name? Mrs.--
I mean, Lola.

231
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,700
Just call me Lola.

232
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,100
What's your name?
Taggart.

233
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,700
Thank you, sir.

234
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,500
You're not exactly an old,
hardened drinker, are you?

235
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,700
It was my first ever.

236
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,900
But I'll learn.

237
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,700
Um, you said "missus."

238
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,500
Mrs. what?

239
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Mrs. John Manners.

240
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,700
My husband's dead.

241
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
I'm sorry, Mrs. Manners.

242
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,900
We had a ranch
south of here.

243
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,900
Then the Apaches came.

244
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,300
They killed John.

245
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,100
He hid me first.
They never even saw me.

246
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,500
And that's
why you're working here?

247
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,700
I just started,

248
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
as if you couldn't tell.

249
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,900
Mr. Guiness over there
doesn't want me,

250
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,300
but I need money
something awful.

251
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,300
How much money?
Thirty-two dollars.

252
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
That's what it costs
to take the stage north
to the first town.

253
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,300
That should be enough
for your fare...

254
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,500
and a couple of days'
expenses.

255
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,900
Give you time to find
a job you can handle.

256
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,700
Oh, please, mister.
I can't take your money.

257
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
I can't--

258
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,500
I can't be obligated to--

259
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,100
to go through with--
I--

260
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,700
All you're obligated to do
is to smile pretty...

261
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
and say thank you nicely.

262
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,500
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

263
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,100
Call it a loan
or a gift.

264
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,300
Anything you like.

265
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,500
Barkeep, we're lookin'
for a man named Taggart--

266
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,900
a tall young man.

267
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,700
I think I recognized
his horse over in front
of the store.

268
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,900
Could you manage
to point him out...

269
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,300
in this crowd
of roisterous merrymakers?

270
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,900
Why, I declare.

271
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,100
I don't know when I've seen
two more handsome men.

272
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,900
Well.

273
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,700
And I declare I can't remember
when I'veseen two
more handsome--

274
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,300
Hold it.

275
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,100
Let's hear those guns
bounce off the floor.

276
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,300
Do what the man says,
Augie.

277
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,300
Some days are worse than others,
and there's lots of tomorrows.

278
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Back away from those guns.Yes, sir.

279
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,100
At your service, sir.
Want me to stand
on my head?

280
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
Anything to oblige.

281
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,300
I hate to involve you,
Mr. Guiness,

282
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,100
but could you
sit on these guns
for a couple of minutes?

283
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Give me time
to turn my back
and ride out of town?

284
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,100
My pleasure.
A couple of minutes?

285
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,700
Take 10. Take 20.

286
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Taggart, I'm not a petty man.

287
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,700
Besides, I want a drink.

288
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,100
Get out of here, Mrs. Manners.
You are fired.

289
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,900
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Guiness.

290
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,500
Hold him right there.

291
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,900
He's headin' south.

292
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
What's in
that direction?

293
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,900
Apaches.

294
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,900
Apaches!

295
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,100
That Taggart.

296
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
He sure makes it hard
to earn a living.

297
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,100
Go get our horses.

298
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,100
Augie!

299
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,100
Check that.

300
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
Hot, huh?

301
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,500
That means Taggart
can't be too far away.

302
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,100
Ah, he rode out that way.

303
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,300
Still headed south,
like geese in the fall.

304
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,300
And still headed
for them Apaches,
who'll kill him for free.

305
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,700
Us too.

306
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,300
Oh, well.
Get back on your horse.

307
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,100
Welcome, stranger--
and that's sincere.

308
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,300
If we're lucky,
they'll kill him for us.

309
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,500
What we do, Augie,
we wait and see.

310
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,900
Forget wait and see.

311
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,900
Taggart, I'm just
as embarrassed as you are,
us being on the same side.

312
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,500
Just keep your gun
shooting in the right direction.

313
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,700
Ma'am, I've purely
got to congratulate you
on the way you handle a gun.

314
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,300
Why I never saw such--Jason! Drop your gun.

315
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,700
Drop it.

316
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,500
Wh-Why-- Why sure, Taggart.

317
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,100
That's the way
you feel about it.

318
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Changed my mind, Taggart.

319
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,500
We'll do things
just like you said,
only backwards.

320
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,500
Or do you want
to see a woman killed?
You let her go!

321
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,900
- Let her go.
- Do as he says,
or he'll kill her.

322
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,900
Drop it.

323
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,100
There now.

324
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,900
Taggart, you're too close.
Move off a bit.

325
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,300
That's far enough.

326
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,700
You people
got someplace to go?

327
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,100
We were heading
for Fort Wetherbee.

328
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,500
Fort Wetherbee?
Best place for you.

329
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,700
On your way, both of you.

330
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,100
What about our guns?
Suppose we meet
more Indians?

331
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,100
Maybe you won't.
Maybe you'll be lucky.

332
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,100
Come on, Jed.
Now.

333
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,300
I told you, Augie.

334
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,100
Some days are better
than others.

335
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,900
I still don't know
what you're going to get
out of killing me.

336
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
Money.

337
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,700
We're businessmen,
Augie and me.

338
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,900
We get $5,000
for sending you up
to rattle St. Peter's gate.

339
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,300
That Taggart.

340
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,900
He acts like
he wants to live
to be a dirty old man,

341
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,900
full of rheumatism
and false teeth.

342
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,500
But he's got no gun,
and he's gotta be
around here someplace.

343
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,100
There!

344
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,900
Missed him.

345
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,500
But he can't get far.
No horse, no gun,
no nothin'.

346
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,100
Jason, I'm hurtin'.That's 5,000 markers
down there.

347
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,500
Augie, you're a boil
on the heel of progress.

348
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,900
You can't afford to
drag behind and hurt,
not now.

349
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,900
- Who are you?
- Give me my gun back.

350
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,300
- What are you gonna
do with it? Shoot me?
- I don't know. I just might.

351
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,700
Let me know
when you make up your mind.

352
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,900
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I-I-- I was just--

353
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,300
Listen, mind your own business.
What are youdoing here?

354
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,900
Apaches. I'm trying
to stay out of their way.

355
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,900
Hey, keep your hands
off me.

356
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,500
You've got no horse
with you.

357
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,300
And you were perched up there
like an army sentry
guarding something.

358
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,300
What's up here?

359
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,700
Listen, mister.

360
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,100
Why don't you just
saunter on back
to where you came from?

361
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,500
I told you. Apaches.

362
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,500
I'll take a look myself.
Drop that rifle.

363
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,100
Go on. Drop it.

364
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Pick it up,
will you, Miriam,
please?

365
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,700
When I saw him
comin', Dad, I--

366
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,100
I was gonna shoot
to scare him,
but I-I thought that--

367
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,300
I know.
You were afraid
you were gonna hit him.

368
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
All right, mister,
what brought you up here?

369
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Apaches-- Down there.

370
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,500
They're out there.
I saw them.

371
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,100
You, with no horse,
no gun?

372
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,700
No. If he has,
I didn't see them.

373
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,100
What are we
gonna do with you?

374
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Put that rifle down,
and I'll answer you.

375
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,100
Your answer
would be wrong.

376
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,700
Walk, mister.
Come on.

377
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Miriam, stay
behind him, please.

378
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Hold it. Hold--

379
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,300
That's my fault.
I should have
stopped you sooner.

380
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,700
Put it back,
will you, Miriam?
Yes, Dad.

381
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,500
Step across that brush.

382
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,300
Looks like you
didn't intend to have
any unexpected guests.

383
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,900
We weren't expecting
anyguests.

384
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,900
You're the first person
that's blundered up here.

385
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,300
Give me a horse and a gun,
and I'll blunder out again.

386
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,700
How did you know
we were up here?
I didn't.

387
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,100
What makes you think
there's a horse and a gun
up here?

388
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,700
When you're running
from Apaches,
you don't stop to think.

389
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,500
You just hide.

390
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,900
I wish I could believe you.
Move on.

391
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,700
Who is he?
What does he want here?

392
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,300
I'm not sure.

393
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,100
Inside.

394
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
An old mission?

395
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,900
Yes. Abandoned
and long forgotten.

396
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,900
Inside.

397
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
- What's your name?
- Taggart.

398
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,900
Doesn't that thing
ever get heavy?

399
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,100
I'm Consuela.
This is my husband,
Adam Stark.

400
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,300
And Miriam.
She is my step-daughter.

401
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,300
Well, Dad,
whether you like it or not
or whether he likes it or not,

402
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,700
Mr. Taggart's our guest,
and it's time to eat.

403
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,700
Of course.
Will you fix something,
please, Miriam?

404
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,300
Yeah, that's the problem.
You see, you keep a prisoner,
you gotta feed him.

405
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,100
Well, we'll eat
in a few minutes.

406
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,300
Thanks for offering
to help.

407
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,900
Wish I knew what I was
gonna do with you, Taggart.

408
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,500
Any woman would know
what to do with him.

409
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,900
Jason. Jason.

410
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Help me.

411
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,900
Help-- Help me, Jason.

412
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
Look at you now.

413
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,500
$5,000 runnin'
around here someplace,
and what do you do?

414
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,500
No, Jason. No.

415
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,700
Augie, be reasonable.

416
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,700
You're no help.
You're a hindrance.

417
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,700
If I just left you there,
you'd probably die,
but then I'd never be sure.

418
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,300
I'd spend the rest of my days
wondering if you
were still alive...

419
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,700
and lookin' for me
with a gun in your hand. No, Jason.

420
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,500
- Uh, no.
- Right?

421
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,300
Mr. Taggart?

422
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700
I wish to talk to you.

423
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,100
I can help you to leave
this place tonight.

424
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,700
- With a horse and a gun?
- Yes.

425
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,700
If you will
take me with you.

426
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Why?

427
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,900
Because I'm afraid.

428
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,900
I'm afraid
of the Apaches.

429
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,300
I'm afraid
of the Apaches too, but, uh,

430
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,900
I'm sure your husband
will protect you.

431
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,300
He's too old.
But you--

432
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,300
You are young
and strong and brave.

433
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,300
A woman
knows such a thing.

434
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
He's not that old,

435
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,300
not the way he handled me.

436
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,700
I would be good for you.

437
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,900
Good to you.

438
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,900
You don't
think me desirable?

439
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,700
Desirable you are,
Mrs. Stark.

440
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,500
But if I'm gonna get
into trouble with a woman,

441
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,100
at least
she won't be married.

442
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,100
With me you would
not be in trouble.

443
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,300
With me you would
find happiness--

444
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,100
happiness
and great wealth.

445
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,100
Wealth?

446
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,100
Tell me the rest of it--
the real reason
you wanna leave here.

447
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,900
It is that a woman
like me deserves more
than a snoring old man.

448
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:49,100
I deserve a young man--
strong, like you.

449
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,500
We can have riches
beyond count together,

450
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,100
because I know
where to find it.

451
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,700
Sleepwalking, Consuela?

452
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,700
Perhaps you
are jealous, angry...

453
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,500
that I was the first
to visit Mr. Taggart
in the night.

454
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,900
No.

455
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,300
Not little Miriam.

456
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,900
So cool
and so cautious.

457
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,300
And how very tempted
you must be...

458
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,100
to tell your father
where you found me tonight.

459
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
But you would not,

460
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,500
because you would
do nothing to hurt him.

461
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,900
We know each other
too well.

462
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,500
Good night.Good night, Mr. Taggart.

463
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,500
Did I interrupt
something tender?

464
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,700
Is that
what you had in mind?

465
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,900
Yes.

466
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,100
My father
loves Consuela.

467
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,300
God knows why,
but he does.

468
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,300
And I won't let her
near you again.

469
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,500
A horse and a gun
will solve that problem.

470
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,900
Make you happy,
make me happy.

471
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,300
I'm not Consuela.

472
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,100
I didn't come here
to please you...

473
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,900
or me. I'm just trying to help.

474
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,900
You know, there's something
I can't quite believe
about you.

475
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,700
Oh, is there?

476
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,500
I can't believe
that you're as...
cold and cautious...

477
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,500
as Consuela
says you are.

478
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,700
Are you?

479
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,900
Good night.

480
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,300
Stark!

481
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,100
I couldn't shoot.
I was afraid
of hitting you.

482
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,500
How did you get out?

483
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,300
The window.

484
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,700
I'm glad I didn't
think about that.

485
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,500
Taggart, I guess
I was wrong about you.

486
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,300
All I can say is thanks.

487
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,300
Can I have a horse
and a gun now?

488
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,500
Mister, if I had 'em,
you could have
an artillery piece...

489
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,300
and a team of thoroughbreds
to pull it.

490
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,700
Come on. I'll show you
what I'm doing up here.

491
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,500
Gold?

492
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,100
The Los Padres Mine.

493
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,100
Been abandoned for years.

494
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,300
And that ought
to crush out
at almost 50% pure gold.

495
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,300
It's the richest
I ever heard of.

496
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,900
So this is why you didn't
want anybody up here.

497
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,300
Can you blame me? No.

498
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,300
You're gonna be a rich man.

499
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,100
Oh, it's not for me.

500
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,500
I just wanna make
Consuela happy.

501
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,300
She's beautiful,
vital and young,

502
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,900
and, well, she hasn't
had much happiness being
married to an older man.

503
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,500
No excitement
or thrills.

504
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,500
Hardly a romantic life.

505
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,300
But now I'll be able
to give her everything
that money can buy.

506
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,500
I know maybe money
isn't everything,

507
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,700
but it's the best
I have to offer.

508
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,900
And I don't know
what I'd do if I lost her.

509
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,300
It's time to quit,
get far away from here.

510
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,700
Why? Well, that Indian
probably had friends.

511
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,900
Maybe a lot of them.

512
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,100
When he's missed, they're
gonna come prowling around.

513
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,900
Miriam and Consuela
are alone.

514
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,100
We better get back.

515
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,100
Hold it right there.

516
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,900
Stab me
if it ain't you, Taggart.

517
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,900
When I heard
that tin bucket
a-bangin' and a-clatterin',

518
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,900
I knew that somebody
someplace would be
waitin' for me.

519
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,100
But who would ever
expect to find you here?
You would.

520
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,700
Who's he?

521
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,500
Jay Jason
at your service.

522
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,300
Inside.

523
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,100
Kind of reminds me
of Romeo and Juliet, Miss,

524
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,300
with me down here
and you up there.

525
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,700
I'll wager you're
even prettier
when you smile.

526
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,300
You see? I was right.

527
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,700
Inside, Jason.

528
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:11,100
Oh. Do I detect
a note of jealousy
in your tone, Taggart?

529
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,900
Oh, I tell you,
I wouldn't--

530
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,700
All right.

531
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:37,300
Am I actually meeting
another beautiful
young woman...

532
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:42,300
away out here
where nothing grows
but tumbleweeds and Apaches?

533
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,100
Shut my mealy mouth.

534
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,100
It's missus, not miss.

535
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,300
If she's your wife,
mister,

536
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,700
all I got to say
is you're a man
of large luck.

537
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,100
Consuela, go upstairs,
if you please.

538
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,500
What's he want?

539
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,700
He's a professional
killer.

540
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,300
He gets $5,000
for killing me.

541
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,500
Mister, what Taggart
just said
is half the truth.

542
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,700
There's no denying it.

543
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,300
But the other half--
the part I didn't
hear him mention--

544
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,300
is that he's wanted
for murder,

545
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,300
and I'm hired
to get him.

546
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,500
Now, you look to me
like a reasonable,
law-abiding man.

547
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,700
And I'm not asking you
to take my word
against his.

548
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,300
Here is proof.

549
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,100
Here's a warrant
empowering me
to get him dead or alive.

550
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,900
Taggart.
You saved my life
this morning.

551
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,900
Still, this looks legal.

552
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,900
Looks legal?

553
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,100
Islegal.However,

554
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,300
I do not approve
of any instrument...

555
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,900
that encourages a man
to kill for profit.

556
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,300
Therefore, I'm not
gonna permit you
to enforce your warrant.

557
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,700
- What do you wanna
do with him?
- I'd like to shoot him.

558
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,900
- We'll tie him up for now.
- Tie me up?

559
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,100
Mister,
it's a true fact.

560
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,900
There's an awful lot
of awful mad Apaches
paddin' around.

561
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,900
If they ain't
sniffed you out here yet,

562
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,500
they will tonight
or tomorrow,

563
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:35,100
and you're gonna need
anybody who can shoot,
including me.

564
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,900
We'll have to get
that warning bucket
back on the rocks.

565
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,700
I'll stand guard tonight.

566
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,100
Both of us.
We'll try to leave
early in the morning.

567
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,900
Keep him covered
while I get a rope.

568
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,300
Anything out there?
Nothing so far.

569
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,300
Apaches aren't supposed
to attack at night,

570
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,300
but I'm not sure
they know that.

571
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500
Well, it'll be light
in a half hour.

572
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,300
I'm gettin' the horses
ready to leave.

573
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,700
Hot coffee.
I want my guards
to stay awake.

574
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,500
Thanks, Miss Stark.

575
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,100
Why don't you learn
to say Miriam?

576
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,900
While he's learning,
why don't you get anything ready
that you wanna take with you.

577
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,900
Oh, I am ready.

578
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,700
Miriam.

579
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,100
Um, about that warrant--
I guess I owe you
an explanation.

580
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,100
Oh, don't say anything.

581
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,900
I believe more in a man
than I do a piece of paper.

582
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,900
- Good night.
- Good night, Miriam.

583
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,300
Taggart, you married,
engaged, anything like that?

584
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,900
No. Nothing like that.

585
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,300
I'll be out front.

586
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,500
Quiet.

587
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,900
We do not want
the others to hear.

588
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:00,300
I'll be as quiet
as a church mouse.

589
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,700
A mission mouse.

590
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,700
But what is it
we don't want
the others to hear?

591
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,700
Private, secret things.

592
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,300
Now, there's nothin' better
than coo-talkin'
with a lovely woman,

593
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,700
but it's kind of a handicap
being tied down.

594
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,100
I want to hear
what do you have to say
without a handicap.

595
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,300
Let's save the talkin'
for dessert.

596
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,100
You can have me...

597
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,100
and own me...

598
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,300
and take me away...

599
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,700
with more gold
than a man can dream.

600
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,700
You're talkin'
about paradise,

601
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,900
you gorgeous, beautiful--

602
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,900
Gold?

603
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,500
How much gold?

604
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,900
Very much gold.

605
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:12,300
Five thousand dollars
many times over
and over again.

606
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,300
Where?

607
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,900
I will tell you
where there is
everything we need--

608
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,300
horses, guns and the gold.

609
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,100
Where?

610
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,900
And you promise
that we share the gold together?

611
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,300
Of course, my darling.

612
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,500
Of course.

613
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,900
The gold would be
worth nothing without you.

614
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,100
Where?

615
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,900
The stable, in the back.

616
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,700
Come quickly and quietly.

617
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,100
Let me look first.
Adam was out there
a few minutes ago.

618
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,100
Look in there.

619
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,300
Now, tell me about my beauty.

620
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:39,100
There's never been a beauty
like yours, Consuela,

621
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:42,900
and never a woman
with such grace, such charm.

622
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:53,500
Consuela, what
are you doing out here?
Looking for you, Adam.

623
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,300
I couldn't see you
in the front,
and I was worried.

624
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,100
I'm all right,
but you better
get back inside.

625
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,100
I do not wish you
to worry about me.

626
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,300
Get inside
and blow out the lights
and stay there.

627
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,700
Those Apaches--

628
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,500
They got a solid sense
of the right time
and the right place.

629
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,900
I'm frightened.

630
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,500
- Can you see 'em?
- Not a thing.

631
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,300
Maybe they willhit us tonight.

632
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,300
Maybe.

633
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,900
Everything's so quiet.
Do you think we ought
to take a chance and leave?

634
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,900
Well, not seeing Apaches
doesn't mean they're
not around.

635
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,900
Yeah. I know--

636
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,900
Get inside.

637
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,100
Go on. Get inside.

638
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,700
Now's our chance.

639
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,300
Dad.

640
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,700
We beat 'em off,
didn't we?

641
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,700
Let's get him inside.

642
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,900
Get some clean cloth,
Miriam, some alcohol.

643
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,500
Or whiskey'll do.

644
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:09,700
Consuela!

645
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,900
Consuela.
Consuela!

646
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,500
Is Consuela in there?
Here, Dad.

647
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,100
Take a good swallow
of this.

648
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,500
Where is she?

649
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,100
Answer me, Miriam.
Where is she?

650
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,700
I don't know
where she is, Dad.

651
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,100
The bullet passed
straight through.

652
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,100
It left an ugly slice
that'll--

653
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,100
Well, it'll really hurt,
but I think that's all.

654
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,700
You two know something
that I don't?

655
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,700
She's gone.
Jason's gone too.
So is the gold.

656
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,500
Jason forced her
to go with him.

657
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,900
I'm going after them.

658
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:24,300
Oh, easy. Easy, Dad.
I'll have to bandage you first.

659
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,900
You'll help me,
won't you, Taggart?

660
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,900
We're going
to Fort Wetherbee,
all of us.

661
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,100
I gotta go after them.

662
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,300
Where do you think
he's taking her?

663
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,900
With Apaches running around,

664
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,700
Fort Wetherbee's
the only place he can go.

665
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,500
No one in sight.

666
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,500
It's a terrible thing,

667
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,700
but I'm afraid that your
gallant husband's wounds
were fatal.

668
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,300
I'm afraid
that you are a widow.

669
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,100
A wealthy widow.

670
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,900
I shall have
closets bursting
with silks and satins.

671
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,300
I shall have
diamonds, furs,

672
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,100
a shining black carriage
with matched black horses--

673
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:30,100
stallions prancing
with their heads high.

674
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,900
Your crystal ball
must be cracked.

675
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,900
What happened to me
in your future?

676
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,500
But my future is yours.

677
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,500
My heart is yours.

678
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,900
You will have
all the luxuries
you desire too.

679
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:51,300
But most of all,
we will have each other.

680
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,900
Till death do us part?

681
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,100
Exactly.

682
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,500
Now we seal
the bargain?

683
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,500
Sealed, signed
and delivered.

684
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,500
We better keep movin'.

685
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,100
Taggart.

686
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,100
I don't believe
that Jason forced Consuela
to go with him, do you?

687
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,700
I know he didn't.

688
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,500
And you know
that when we get
to Fort Wetherbee...

689
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,700
that Jason
will probably be there?

690
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,500
You don't sound so...
cold and cautious anymore.

691
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,300
But it's true.
He'll kill you if he can.

692
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:13,900
Miriam, when a man
knows something's wrong,

693
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,900
he usually backs away,
leaves it alone.

694
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,300
Now, that's what
I've done with Jason.

695
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,100
But I'm not doing that anymore.

696
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,500
Not now.

697
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,100
Get your father,
and I'll meet you out front.

698
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,500
I'll scout on ahead
and make sure there
are no more Apaches.

699
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,500
Watch for my signal.

700
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,900
Some days are better
than others, Consuela.

701
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,700
And today's
one of the very best
in recorded history.

702
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:45,300
That there is the U.S. Calvary,
herdin' settlers
into Fort Wetherbee.

703
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,300
We'll join 'em
and ride in safety.

704
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,900
Your thoughts are
many miles from here.

705
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:38,700
You're lookin'
into that closet full
of silks and satins?

706
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,700
No.

707
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,900
We are safe now, true?

708
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,700
Stop fretting
and frowning,
my lovely.

709
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:51,100
We've got a lot of guns
on our side now.

710
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,300
Start smiling again...

711
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,300
and dreaming about
all that jewelry
you're gonna buy.

712
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:00,500
Later. Now I'm thinking
about my future.

713
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,300
Our future.

714
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,300
Remember? My future.

715
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,500
And I don't see you in it.

716
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,100
You've forgotten
our bargain...

717
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,500
and how we sealed it.

718
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:22,100
I'll purely enjoy
reminding you.

719
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:25,100
When we reach the fort,
we will say good-bye.

720
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:31,100
You're so long
on beauty...

721
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,700
and so short on memory.

722
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,100
"But most of all,
we will have each other."

723
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,500
Do you remember
saying that?

724
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,300
I changed my mind.
That's all.

725
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,500
We made a promise.

726
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,300
Till death do us part.

727
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,100
My pretty one,

728
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:00,300
you'll keep
that promise.

729
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,700
Lieutenant!

730
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,100
Lieutenant!

731
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,300
Lieutenant, Apaches.

732
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,100
Where?
There's hundreds of 'em
right over that hill.

733
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,300
And they're headin'
this way.

734
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,500
Look to the other side.

735
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,900
Take 'em ahead!

736
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,100
Form a circle!

737
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,300
Caravan, ho!

738
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,100
Get down! Get down!

739
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,300
Help me!
Please help me!

740
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,100
Get back.
Get back in the wagon.

741
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,300
Help me!

742
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,100
Did you find her?
No.

743
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,700
You found something.

744
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:23,300
I saw some Apache sign.
We'll ride that way
to avoid them.

745
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:32,900
Consuela--
Tell me the truth.

746
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,500
She's dead.

747
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,900
- How?
- You don't wanna know.

748
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,300
- What about Jason?
- No sign of him.

749
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,500
Can't you see anything
at all, Sergeant?

750
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,100
Nothing, sir.
Nothing at all.

751
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,100
Here comes one man, sir--
a civilian.
He's ridin' fast.

752
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,300
What have you seen?
A lot more than
any man's supposed to see.

753
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,100
Well, what? Indians, everywhere,
all headed this way...

754
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,300
like they were starved
and the dinner gong rang.

755
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,500
Will you give me
a couple of fresh
horses fast?

756
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,300
I want distance
between me and here
when they arrive.

757
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:58,900
Did you see
any cavalry patrols
or soldiers with wagons?

758
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,900
No patrols, but I saw
soldiers and wagons
along with civilians,

759
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,500
all being slaughtered.

760
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,700
You've gotta give me
fresh horses.

761
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,700
You ain't got
enough soldiers
to protect this place.

762
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:12,700
No horses.
You'll stay and fight
like the rest of us.

763
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:17,300
Here come
three more civilians, sir!
One of them's a woman!

764
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,900
You'd better
get him inside.I'll be all right.

765
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,500
I'm well enough
to shoot a gun.

766
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,700
Colonel, I'm--
I'm looking for my wife.

767
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,700
Beautiful, young,
dark-haired--

768
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,900
There'd be
a man with her.

769
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,700
I'm sorry, sir.
I haven't seen her.

770
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,100
All right, soldier.

771
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:05,100
What did you see out there? Dead soldiers
and dead civilians--

772
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,300
What's left
of some burned wagons.

773
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,300
His wife is dead,
only he doesn't know it yet.

774
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,100
See a cavalry patrol? No, sir. No patrol.

775
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:27,700
- Here come the Indians, sir!
- Close the gates!

776
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,300
Women and children inside!

777
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,300
Miriam, you better
go inside, honey.

778
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:43,100
I'll do what I can
to help out here.

779
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,500
Where's Consuela?

780
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:48,900
Where is she?

781
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,100
Dad!

782
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,100
Dad.

783
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,300
Miriam,

784
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:22,900
take care of Consuela.

785
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,500
Promise me.

786
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:31,100
Take care of her.I promise.

787
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,700
Troop "B" comin' up
to the back gate, sir!

788
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,300
Open the rear gate!
