follow her to fiji?

you ever think
about that, marlon?

towards something?

mmm, no.

the whole way there.

00:55:20,174 --> 00:55:22,753
it's all
gonna be fine.

1001
00:55:24,633 --> 00:55:27,472
i don't know what
to think, marlon.

1002
00:55:30,932 --> 00:55:33,681
maybe i'm losing
my mind, but...

1003
00:55:37,181 --> 00:55:40,350
it feels like the whole world
revolves around me somehow.

1004
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,569
that's a lot of world
for one man, Truman.

1005
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:50,488
sure that's not
wishful thinking?

1006
00:55:50,529 --> 00:55:52,118
you wishing you'd made

1007
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:54,327
something more
out of yourself?

1008
00:55:54,528 --> 00:55:56,327
come on, who hasn't
sat in the john,

1009
00:55:56,538 --> 00:55:59,787
had an imaginary interview
on  seahaven tonight?

1010
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:01,116
who hasn't wanted
to be somebody?

1011
00:56:01,327 --> 00:56:04,376
this is different.
everybody seems to be in on it.

1012
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:12,335
i've been your best friend
since we were 7 years old.

1013
00:56:12,965 --> 00:56:14,844
the only way you and i ever
made it through school

1014
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:18,054
was by cheating off
each other's test papers.

1015
00:56:19,014 --> 00:56:21,633
jesus, they were identical.

1016
00:56:22,843 --> 00:56:25,682
but i always felt safe
knowing that.

1017
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:28,102
'cause whatever
the answer was,

1018
00:56:28,312 --> 00:56:31,391
we were right together
and we were wrong together.

1019
00:56:32,942 --> 00:56:35,941
remember when i stayed up
all night in your tent

1020
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:39,030
'cause you wanted
to play north pole?

1021
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,859
and i got pneumonia?

1022
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,699
[laughing]

1023
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:44,659
you remember that?

1024
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,789
you were out of school
for about a month.

1025
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:56,207
you're the closest thing
i ever had to a brother.

1026
00:57:03,217 --> 00:57:05,426
i know that things...

1027
00:57:05,636 --> 00:57:08,095
haven't really worked
out for either of us

1028
00:57:08,306 --> 00:57:11,095
like we used to
dream they would.

1029
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:12,054
i know that feeling,

1030
00:57:12,265 --> 00:57:15,224
when it's like everything's
slipping away...

1031
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:17,893
you don't want
to believe it,

1032
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:21,063
so you look for answers
somewhere else, but...

1033
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:26,482
well...

1034
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,572
christof:
but, well, the point is...

1035
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:33,571
i'd gladly walk in front
of traffic for you.

1036
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:38,830
marlon: well...

1037
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,449
the point is,
i would gladly

1038
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,119
step in front of traffic
for you, Truman.

1039
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:46,289
and the last thing
i'd ever do is lie to you.

1040
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:52,128
and the last thing
that i would ever do...

1041
00:57:55,178 --> 00:57:57,547
is lie to you.

1042
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:02,226
i mean, think about it,
Truman.

1043
00:58:02,267 --> 00:58:04,936
if everybody
is in on it...

1044
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:08,815
i'd have to be
in on it, too.

1045
00:58:17,524 --> 00:58:20,363
i'm not in on it,
Truman, because...

1046
00:58:21,113 --> 00:58:23,572
there is no "it."

1047
00:58:26,413 --> 00:58:29,332
you were right about
one thing, though.

1048
00:58:30,452 --> 00:58:32,331
what's that?

1049
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,291
the thing that
started all this.

1050
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:52,848
yep. i found him
for you, Truman.

1051
00:58:53,518 --> 00:58:55,727
that's why
i came by tonight.

1052
00:58:55,938 --> 00:58:58,857
i'm sure he's got
quite a story to tell.

1053
00:59:03,146 --> 00:59:05,485
go to him.

1054
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:12,574

move in
for a closeup?

1063
00:59:53,728 --> 00:59:56,107
no, no, no.

1064
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:59,316
move back and...
fade up music.

and now go in close.

i'll make it up
to you, son.

1074
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:37,890
bravo.

1075
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,939
that was a really great
experience.

congratulations.

1077
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,859
ok, quiet down.
let's concentrate.

that was good work.

1079

whoo!

01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:49,068

some champagne up here.

01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,778
congratulations.

just brilliant.

it just broke my heart.

1084

220 countries tuned in
for his first step.

1088
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:33,271
the world stood still
for that stolen kiss,

1089
01:01:34,901 --> 01:01:37,530
and as he grew,
so did the technology.

1090
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:38,439
an entire human life

1091
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:41,699
recorded on an intricate
network of hidden cameras

1092
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:44,989
and broadcast live and
unedited 24 hours a day,

1093
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,868
7 days a week to an audience
around the globe.

1094
01:01:49,948 --> 01:01:52,577
coming to you now
from seahaven island,

1095
01:01:52,788 --> 01:01:55,787
enclosed in the largest
studio ever constructed,

1096
01:01:56,457 --> 01:01:58,086
and along with
the great wall of china,

1097
01:01:58,337 --> 01:02:01,466
one of only 2 manmade structures
visible from space,

1098
01:02:02,876 --> 01:02:05,505
now in its 30th great year,

1099
01:02:06,506 --> 01:02:08,805
it's...

1100
01:02:12,135 --> 01:02:14,344
what a week it's been.
i don't know about you--

1101
01:02:14,554 --> 01:02:16,223
i was on pins and needles
the entire time.

1102
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:19,523
hello and good evening.
i'm your host mike michaelson,

1103
01:02:19,893 --> 01:02:21,182
and welcome to  tru-talk,

1104
01:02:21,393 --> 01:02:23,102
our forum for issues
growing out of the show.

1105
01:02:23,313 --> 01:02:26,232
but tonight,
something very special indeed,

1106
01:02:26,772 --> 01:02:28,481
a rare and
exclusive interview

1107
01:02:28,692 --> 01:02:30,941
with the show's
conceiver and creator.

1108
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:34,240
so, come with us now as we
go live to the lunar room

1109
01:02:34,571 --> 01:02:37,530
on the 221st floor
of the omni cam echosphere,

1110
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,199
where we'll find the world's
greatest tele-visionary--

1111
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,619
the designer and architect
of the world within a world

1112
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:47,628
that is seahaven island--
christof.

1113
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:50,258
before we begin,
i'd like to thank you

1114
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:53,007
on behalf of our audience
for granting this interview.

1115
01:02:53,218 --> 01:02:54,967
we know how demanding
your schedule is,

1116
01:02:55,177 --> 01:02:58,296
and we all know how jealously
you guard your privacy.

1117
01:02:59,137 --> 01:03:01,846
this, sir,
is indeed an honor.

1118
01:03:02,056 --> 01:03:02,555
don't mention it.

1119
01:03:02,766 --> 01:03:04,935
well, the catalyst for
the recent dramatic events

1120
01:03:05,136 --> 01:03:08,105
on the show has been
Truman's father, kirk,

1121
01:03:08,105 --> 01:03:09,564
and his attempts
to infiltrate the show.

1122
01:03:09,765 --> 01:03:12,024
but before we get into that,
i think it's worth noting

1123
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:15,404
that this is not the first time
someone from the outside

1124
01:03:15,694 --> 01:03:16,773
has attempted
to reach Truman, is it?

1125
01:03:16,984 --> 01:03:19,403
christof: we have had
close calls in the past.

1126
01:03:19,613 --> 01:03:22,282
man: Truman!
it's television!

1127
01:03:22,573 --> 01:03:23,702
yes!

1128
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,362
yes! i did it!

1129

i'm on  the Truman show!

1130
01:03:27,032 --> 01:03:29,451
mike: but there's never
been anything to compare

1131
01:03:29,662 --> 01:03:31,041
with this most recent
breach in security--

1132
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:34,250
the first intruder to be
a former cast member.

1133
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:36,330
a dead one at that.

1134
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,539
gotta say, writing kirk
back in--masterstroke.

1135
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,339
since kirk started this
crisis in Truman's life,

1136
01:03:43,379 --> 01:03:46,428
i came to the conclusion
that only he could end it.

1137
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:49,218
Truman! Truman! no!

over there?

that's all.

1142

you've got to know
your limitations, Truman.

mike: but let's remind
viewers exactly why

1144
01:03:59,687 --> 01:04:01,896
dad was written out
in the first place.

1145
01:04:02,106 --> 01:04:03,855
christof: as Truman grew up,
we were forced

1146
01:04:04,066 --> 01:04:07,065
to manufacture ways
to keep him on the island.

you're too late.

nothing left to explore.

with kirk's drowning.

mike: most effective.

1154
01:04:22,703 --> 01:04:24,372
Truman's been terrified
of the water ever since.

christof: when kirk read
the synopsis of the episode,

1156
01:04:27,672 --> 01:04:30,591
he was disappointed
to say the least.

1157
01:04:31,091 --> 01:04:31,250
jesus!

1158
01:04:31,461 --> 01:04:34,590
i'm sure that's what caused
him to break onto the set.

1159
01:04:34,881 --> 01:04:37,970
but how do you intend to
explain his 22-year absence?

1160
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:40,889
amnesia.

1161
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,099
brilliant. let's take
some viewer phone calls.

1162
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,638
charlotte, north carolina,
you're on with christof.

1163
01:04:48,308 --> 01:04:50,727
man: uh, yeah,
hi, christof.

1164
01:04:50,938 --> 01:04:54,067
i was wondering how many
cameras you got in that town.

1165
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:56,686
somewhere in
the vicinity of 5,000.

1166
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:59,406
man: that's
a lot of cameras.

1167
01:04:59,606 --> 01:05:02,405
remember, we started
with just one.

1168
01:05:02,526 --> 01:05:05,195
he was curious
from birth.

1169
01:05:07,285 --> 01:05:08,114
premature by 2 weeks.

1170
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:10,074
almost as if he couldn't
wait to get started.

1171
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:13,244
mike: his eagerness
to leave his mother's womb

1172
01:05:13,624 --> 01:05:14,993
was the very reason
he was the one selected.

1173
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:17,753
in competition with 5 other
unwanted pregnancies,

1174
01:05:17,963 --> 01:05:20,962
the casting of a show,
determined by an air date,

1175
01:05:21,003 --> 01:05:23,882
Truman was the one
who arrived on cue.

1176
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:31,221
mike: incidentally, i believe
Truman is the first child

1177
01:05:31,221 --> 01:05:33,430
to have been legally adopted
by a corporation.

1178
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:34,680
that's correct.

1179
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:36,890
the show has generated
enormous revenues now,

1180
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,349
equivalent to the gross national
product of a small country.

1181
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:42,479
people forget it takes
the population

1182
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,148
of an entire country to
keep the show running.

1183
01:05:44,359 --> 01:05:46,068
since the show is on
24-hours a day

1184
01:05:46,279 --> 01:05:49,528
without commercial interruption,
all those staggering revenues

1185
01:05:50,198 --> 01:05:52,117
are generated
by product placement.

1186
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:54,697
that's true. everything
on the show is for sale.

1187
01:05:54,907 --> 01:05:56,286
from the actor's wardrobe,
food products,

1188
01:05:56,487 --> 01:05:57,326
to the very homes
they live in.

1189
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:00,666
mike: and all of it available
in the Truman catalog.

1190
01:06:00,786 --> 01:06:02,125
operators are standing by.

1191
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:03,955
christof, let me ask you,

1192
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:07,125
why do you think Truman
has never come close

1193
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,584
to discovering the true nature
of his world until now?

1194
01:06:10,874 --> 01:06:12,753
we accept the reality
of the world

1195
01:06:12,964 --> 01:06:14,883
with which we are
presented.

1196
01:06:15,094 --> 01:06:17,173
it's as simple as that.

1197
01:06:17,383 --> 01:06:19,092
the hague for christof.

1198
01:06:19,303 --> 01:06:21,762
hello? the hague?

1199
01:06:22,802 --> 01:06:23,891
all right,
we've lost that call.

1200
01:06:24,102 --> 01:06:26,061
let's go to hollywood.
you're on  tru-talk.

1201
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:28,891
hi, christof. i'd just
like to say one thing.

1202
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:30,310
you're a liar
and a manipulator,

1203
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,400
and what you've done
to Truman is sick!

1204
01:06:32,601 --> 01:06:35,520
well, we remember
this voice, don't we?

1205
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:38,939
how could we forget?

1206
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:40,449
mike: let's go
to another call.

1207
01:06:40,649 --> 01:06:43,318
no, no, no.
it's fine, mike.

1208
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:46,908
i love to reminisce with
former members of the cast.

1209
01:06:48,198 --> 01:06:50,157
sylvia...

1210
01:06:50,368 --> 01:06:53,417
as you announced so
melodramatically to the world,

1211
01:06:53,747 --> 01:06:56,916
you think because you batted
your eyes at Truman once...

1212
01:06:59,506 --> 01:07:01,125
flirted with him...

1213
01:07:01,336 --> 01:07:02,675
stole a few minutes
of air time with him...

1214
01:07:02,876 --> 01:07:06,095
to thrust yourself and your
politics into the limelight...

1215
01:07:07,005 --> 01:07:08,134
that you know him?

1216
01:07:08,345 --> 01:07:10,134
that you know
what's right for him?

1217
01:07:10,345 --> 01:07:13,434
you really think you're
in a position to judge him?

1218
01:07:13,474 --> 01:07:15,513
what right do you have
to take a baby

1219
01:07:15,724 --> 01:07:18,683
and turn his life into
some kind of mockery?

1220
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:21,392
don't you ever
feel guilty?

1221
01:07:22,312 --> 01:07:25,361
i have given Truman a chance
to lead a normal life.

1222
01:07:28,152 --> 01:07:30,111
the world...

1223
01:07:30,321 --> 01:07:32,280
the place you live in...

1224
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:34,950
is the sick place.

1225
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,489
seahaven's the way
the world should be.

1226
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,239
he's not a performer.
he's a prisoner.

1227
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:41,749
look at him! look at
what you've done to him!

1228
01:07:41,959 --> 01:07:42,958
he can leave at any time.

1229
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,628
if his was more
than just a vague ambition,

1230
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:48,958
if he was absolutely determined
to discover the truth,

1231
01:07:51,258 --> 01:07:53,257
there's no way
we could prevent him.

1232
01:07:53,467 --> 01:07:56,426
i think what distresses
you really, caller,

1233
01:07:59,596 --> 01:08:01,345
is that ultimately...

1234
01:08:01,556 --> 01:08:04,475
Truman prefers his cell,
as you call it.

1235
01:08:05,345 --> 01:08:06,764
that's where
you're wrong.

1236
01:08:06,975 --> 01:08:09,934
you're so wrong, and
he'll prove you wrong.

1237
01:08:10,314 --> 01:08:12,733
mike: well, aside from
the heated comments

1238
01:08:12,934 --> 01:08:14,603
of a very
vocal minority,

1239
01:08:14,814 --> 01:08:17,363
it's been an overwhelmingly
positive experience.

1240
01:08:17,563 --> 01:08:19,862
yes. for Truman and
for the viewing public.

1241
01:08:20,073 --> 01:08:22,692
well, christof,
i can't thank you enough

1242
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:24,491
for giving so generously
of your time tonight.

1243
01:08:24,702 --> 01:08:27,951
i think it's safe to say now
that this crisis is behind us

1244
01:08:28,121 --> 01:08:29,530
and Truman is back
to his old self,

1245
01:08:29,741 --> 01:08:32,250
we can look forward to some
exciting new developments?

1246
01:08:32,451 --> 01:08:34,000
well, mike, the big news

1247
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,249
is that meryl
will be leaving Truman

1248
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,879
in an upcoming episode,

1249
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,129
and a new romantic interest
will be introduced.

1250
01:08:41,129 --> 01:08:41,668
mike: aha.

1251
01:08:41,879 --> 01:08:44,218
i'm determined television's
first on-air conception

1252
01:08:44,419 --> 01:08:45,588
will still take place.

1253
01:08:45,798 --> 01:08:48,847
well, another television
milestone straight ahead.

1254
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:50,717
you heard it here first.

1255
01:08:50,928 --> 01:08:53,097
it has been a singular honor
and pleasure, sir.

1256

christof,
what's going on?

1475
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:23,381
did you know that there's
a rumor circulating

1476
01:20:23,591 --> 01:20:25,670
that he's dead?
you hear me?

1477
01:20:25,881 --> 01:20:28,380
the media is having
a feeding frenzy over this.

1478
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,049
all the phone lines
are jammed,

1479
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,049
and every network has
a pirated shot of marlon

making an ass of himself
in front of the camera.

why? we're getting higher
ratings with this graphic

than we've ever had
on this show.

no sign of him.

1485
01:20:45,228 --> 01:20:48,067
why don't you head back
to town and join the others?

1486
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:51,156

at first positions, ok?
