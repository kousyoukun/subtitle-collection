148
00:09:56,393 --> 00:10:00,454
离开我的工作  离开桃源岛

151
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:08,466

154
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:16,670
-不想 -杂货够刺激
No, thanks. Now, there's excitement.

155
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:20,806
你从没兴趣到外面走走?

再走远一点  就回来
You can't get Any further away Before you start Coming back.

166
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:55,441
菲济有些岛屿是没有人到过的

那么  你打算几时去?
So, when are you Going to go?

169
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:05,486
要去  并不简单
It's not that simple.

170
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:10,222
需要钱、筹备
It takes...Money, Planning.

171
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:13,225
不能说走就走
I can't just up and go.

172
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,859
对
Right.

173
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:18,138

174
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:21,608

今晚不行

178
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:52,469
似乎快有风暴  划回去吧
I don't like the look Of that weather, son. I think we should Head back.

179
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:55,304

[thunder]

190
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:21,596
像只落汤鸡  去过哪里?
You're soaked. Where have you been?

191
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:23,892
如果筹到八千元…
I figure if we can Scrape together 8,000--

192
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:27,700
-每次跟马龙玩完后… -就可节俭  到处旅行一年
Every time you and marlon Get together-- We can bum around the world For a year on that.

193
00:13:27,837 --> 00:13:31,000
然后打回原形  不名一文
And then what, truman? We'd be where we were 5 years ago.

194
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:33,709
你不现实得像个少年
You're talking Like a teenager.

195
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,273
也许我的心境像少年
Well, maybe i feel Like a teenager.

196
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,980
我们要供房子

197
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,642
又要供车  怎丢得下?
We have car payments. What, we're just going To walk away from our financial Obligations?

198
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:44,981
会好刺激
It would be An adventure.

199
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:48,720
我们不打算生儿育女吗?
I thought we were going To try for a baby.

200
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,360
还不够刺激?
Isn't that enough Of an adventure?

201
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:54,486
儿女可迟点生  我想出外走走

见见世面  闯新天地!

这种冲动谁都有过
This'll pass.

206
00:14:04,474 --> 00:14:06,738
但迟早会明白不切实际
We all think like this Now and then.

207
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:11,305
先脱掉湿衫裤  好不好?

每逢上床

Ahem.

Nicely done.

592
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:27,438
没什么好看  除非你是家属
This isn't Going to be pretty.

593
00:42:27,575 --> 00:42:29,736
你手术的确高明
It's just Beautiful. Beautiful job.

594

要不要订位?
You want to book the flight?

609

[engine stalls]

624
00:44:49,784 --> 00:44:52,378
各位下车  机件故障
[radiator hissing]Everybody off. We've got a problem.

625
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:13,401
对不起  小伙子
I'm sorry, son.

626
00:45:27,455 --> 00:45:28,854
他的爸爸是芝加哥人  对吗?
His father was from Chicago, wasn't he?

627
00:45:28,923 --> 00:45:32,256
不…他的牙医是佛罗里达人

628
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:33,655
他爸爸是爱荷华人

629
00:45:33,795 --> 00:45:36,127
为什么去芝加哥?
But how come he wants To go to chicago?

630
00:45:36,197 --> 00:45:38,825
他不想去  哪里也不想去
He's not going to chicago. He's not going anywhere.

631
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:39,922
只是和美露斗气
He has to have it out With meryl.

632
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,570
[pluto barks]

633
00:45:57,218 --> 00:45:58,310
阿仁?
Truman?

634
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:04,822

一位太太骑着红色单车

然后有个人拿着鲜花
Followed by a man With flowers

642
00:46:29,717 --> 00:46:32,652
跟着有架黄色甲虫型福士
And a volkswagen beetle With a dented fender.

643
00:46:32,787 --> 00:46:35,221
-楚门  拜?你 -看!
Truman, please. Truman: look.

644
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,294

00:46:51,906 --> 00:46:53,567
来了
There it is! There it is!

649
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:55,836
一架黄色福士
There's that dented Beetle! Yes!

650
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,230

Ha ha ha!

652
00:47:03,218 --> 00:47:04,617
知道我怎猜中吗?
Don't you want to know How i did that?

653
00:47:04,686 --> 00:47:07,018
很简单  他们在兜圈
I'll tell you. They're on a loop.

654
00:47:07,488 --> 00:47:10,480
沿着附近几条街  不断兜圈
They go around the block. They come back.

655
00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:13,422
团团转
They go around again. They just go Round and round. Round and round.

656
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:16,629
我请了马龙夫妇周日来烧烤
I invited rita and marlon For a barbecue on sunday.

657
00:47:16,764 --> 00:47:18,254
我不会在这里

658
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:20,765
记得提醒我买炭

659
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:23,827
我的话你有没有听见?
Are you listening To a word i'm saying?

660
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,331
你讲来讲去  都要去菲济
You're upset because You want to go to fiji. Is that it?

661
00:47:30,612 --> 00:47:33,445
去吧
Ok, ok, go.

662
00:47:35,483 --> 00:47:39,544
但应该储几个月的生活费才去
I think you should save For a few months And then go. There.

663
00:47:40,021 --> 00:47:41,955
现在满意了没有?
Are you happy now?

664
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,900
I want to go take a shower.

665
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:47,919
我们现在就去
Let's go now.

666
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:49,956
我现在可以去了
I'm ready to go now. Why wait?

667
00:47:49,998 --> 00:47:53,490
坐言起行  早走早着  对不对
Early bird Gathers no moss. Rolling stone catches The worm, right?

668
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,200
[laughs]

669
00:47:55,803 --> 00:47:58,363
你在干什么?
Meryl: truman, What are you doing?

670
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,670
Oh!

671
00:48:02,343 --> 00:48:03,503
阿仁
Truman!

672
00:48:04,312 --> 00:48:07,281
应该驶到哪里去?
Where shall we go? Where shall we go?

673
00:48:08,983 --> 00:48:10,075
阿仁  我们去哪里?
Truman, where Are we going?

674
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:12,785
我只是漫无目的  顺其自然
I don't really know. I guess i'm being spontaneous.

675
00:48:13,888 --> 00:48:17,619
不得了  我顺其自然起来!
Somebody help me! I'm being spontaneous!

676
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:21,894
不去菲济了  反正开车去不到
Meryl: truman. Forget fiji. Can't very well drive To fiji, can we?

677
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,770
No.

678
00:48:24,866 --> 00:48:27,334
不如去大西洋城?
What about Atlantic city?

679
00:48:27,435 --> 00:48:28,993
不要去  你讨厌赌博
Oh, no, you hate To gamble.

680
00:48:29,637 --> 00:48:32,367
-的确讨厌 -为什么还去?
That's right, I do, don't i? So why would you want To go there?

681
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,598
因为没去过
Because i never have.

682
00:48:34,008 --> 00:48:36,909
观光就是去没去过的地方
That's why people Go places, isn't it?

683
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:40,310
阿仁  我想呕吐
Truman, truman, I think i'm gonna throw up.

684
00:48:40,415 --> 00:48:41,473
我也想
Me, too.

685
00:48:49,724 --> 00:48:52,056
到处都塞车
Blocked at every turn.

686
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:54,790
配合得天衣无缝  对吗?
Beautifully synchronized, Don't you agree?

687
00:48:54,896 --> 00:48:56,864
连塞车你也怪我?
You're blaming me For the traffic?

688
00:48:56,998 --> 00:48:58,329
不应该怪你?
Should i?

689
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:08,537
我们回家吧
Truman... Let's go home.

690
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:12,476
好  塞车可能塞几个钟头
You're right. We could be stuck Here for hours.

691
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,813
一直塞到大西洋城  回去吧
It could be like this All the way to atlantic city. Let's go back.

692
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:20,545
我一时糊涂  不应该去
I'm sorry. I don't know What got into me.

693
00:49:24,305 --> 00:49:25,966
可以驶慢一点吗?
Meryl: can you Please slow down?

694
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:28,354
可以
Yes, i can.

695
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:33,362
-你忘记转弯 -我又改变主意
Truman! Truman! That's our turnoff! I changed my mind again.

696
00:49:33,602 --> 00:49:35,399
新奥尔良这几天应该好热闹
What's new orleans like This time of year?

697
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:37,630

看  同一条路  一部车都没有
Look, meryl, same road, No cars.

701
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:48,883
像魔术一样
It's magic. Ha ha ha!

702
00:49:49,718 --> 00:49:52,778
我要下车  你的脑袋有毛病
You let me out. You're Not right in the head.

703
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:54,788
你要自毁  自毁到够
You want to destroy Yourself, do it on your own.

704
00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:56,452
我要人陪
I think i'd like A little company.

705
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:08,266
你明知故犯
Oh, truman... You knew This would happen.

706
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:11,906
明知道自己不敢开车过海
You know you can't Drive over water.

707
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:14,838
回家吧  你会觉得安全
Let's go home Where you'll feel safe.

708
00:50:17,446 --> 00:50:20,347

阿仁

We shouldn't be doing this! We're breaking the law!

712
00:50:27,422 --> 00:50:28,389

715
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:35,820

-有山火 -骗人  别怕
Truman! What About that sign? They're exaggerating. We'll be fine.

721
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,571
你不相信吗?
Exaggerating? Do you believe that?

722

[yelling]

00:50:57,452 --> 00:51:00,944
着火了…
Oh, my! Oh, my! Truman, we're on fire!

724
00:51:01,323 --> 00:51:03,291

楚门  停车
Truman, stop! Oh, god!

728
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:15,962
我们没有钱  到新奥尔良怎办
Oh! So, what are we going To do for money When we get To new orleans?

729
00:51:18,106 --> 00:51:20,006
我有桃源的银行卡
I have my seahaven Bank card.

730
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,775
你打算动用储蓄?

731
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:27,478

她一定担心得要命
She's going To be worried sick.

733
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:31,382
可能受不起打击
I don't know how She's going to take this.

734
00:51:43,832 --> 00:51:45,060
又有什么事?

Back up! Back up! Leak at the plant. We had to shut her down.

为什么要替我生孩子?

782
00:54:29,564 --> 00:54:31,498
多种选择
There are So many choices!

783
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,767
快想想办法

叫我怎忍受下去?
How can anyone Expect me To carry on under These conditions?

795
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:13,063
完全没有专业精神
It's unprofessional!

796
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:15,070
不要怕
Shh, it's ok.

我脑袋一片混乱
I don't know what To think, marlon.

801
00:55:32,093 --> 00:55:34,254
快要疯了
Maybe i'm losing My mind, but...

802
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:41,830
全世界似乎绕着我而转
It feels like the whole world Revolves around me somehow.

803
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:47,001
即是说  你自以为好重要
That's a lot of world For one man, truman.

804
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:51,169
不是有点一厢情愿吗?
Sure that's not Wishful thinking?

805
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,613
你感觉郁郁不得志?
You wishing you'd made Something more Out of yourself?

806
00:55:55,116 --> 00:55:57,346
不得志是很正常的感觉
Come on, who hasn't Sat in the john,

807
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:00,053
谁也希望踌躇满志

808
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:02,381
谁也希望做个名人
Who hasn't wanted To be somebody?

809
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:05,319
我的意思是人人都似乎在串谋
This is different. Everybody seems to be in on it.

810
00:56:10,298 --> 00:56:13,267
你七岁时  我们已经是老朋友
I've been your best friend Since we were 7 years old.

811
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:17,971
读书考试  你抄我  我抄你
The only way you and i ever Made it through school was by cheating off Each other's test papers.

812
00:56:19,341 --> 00:56:21,935
你我的答案一模一样
Jesus, they were identical.

813
00:56:23,845 --> 00:56:25,745
我总觉得安全
But i always felt safe Knowing that.

814
00:56:26,915 --> 00:56:28,644
因为无论答对还是答错
'Cause whatever The answer was,

815
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:31,842
我们都能够一同对  一同错
We were right together And we were wrong together.

816
00:56:34,022 --> 00:56:36,616
那一晚去露营  通宵不睡
Remember when i stayed up All night in your tent

817
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:38,654
因为你要扮北极
'Cause you wanted To play north pole?

818
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:41,225
搞到我得肺炎
And i got pneumonia?

819
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:44,730
记得吗?
[laughing]You remember that?

820
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:48,427
你要向学校请了一个月的病假
You were out of school For about a month.

821
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:56,871
你我亲如兄弟
You're the closest thing I ever had to a brother.

822
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:05,376
我知道…
I know that things...

823
00:57:06,688 --> 00:57:07,916
你我的人生都不算顺利
Haven't really worked Out for either of us

824
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:10,389
离理想相当远
Like we used to Dream they would.

825
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,691
觉得时不与我
I know that feeling, When it's like everything's Slipping away...

826
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:18,256
你无法面对现实  于是…
You don't want To believe it

827
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:21,868
疑神疑鬼
So you look for answers Somewhere else, but...

828
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:33,775
但我肯为你这朋友  两胁插刀
Well...the point is...I'd gladly walk in front Of traffic for you.

829
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:42,780
但我肯为你这朋友  两胁插刀
Marlon: well...The point is, I would gladly Step in front of traffic For you, truman.

830
00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:48,022
怎也不会欺骗你
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.

831
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:52,859
怎也不会…
And the last thing That i would ever do...

832

欺骗你
Is lie to you.

833
00:58:00,241 --> 00:58:01,970
你不妨想一想
I mean, think about it, Truman.

834
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:04,911
假如人人都串谋
If everybody Is in on it...

835
00:58:06,915 --> 00:58:09,008
即是说  我也串谋
I'd have to be In on it, too.

836
00:58:18,293 --> 00:58:20,386
我没有串谋  因为…
I'm not in on it, Truman, because...

837
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,320
根本没有这回事
There is no "it."

838
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:29,261
但有一件事你是对的
You were right about One thing, though.

839
00:58:30,905 --> 00:58:31,894
什么事?
What's that?

840
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:35,475
这场风波的起因
The thing that Started all this.

841
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:53,860
我替你找到他
Yep. I found him For you, truman.

842
00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:56,092
所以我今晚来找你
That's why I came by tonight.

843
00:58:56,831 --> 00:58:59,095
他必定有很多话要说
I'm sure he's got Quite a story to tell.

844
00:59:03,138 --> 00:59:04,469
你过去吧

845
00:59:11,379 --> 00:59:12,937
烟雾不要太浓
Easy on the fog.

现在特写
And now go in close.

我会弥补你的损失
I'll make it up To you, son.

859
01:00:15,977 --> 01:00:17,137
一定会
I swear.

860
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,570
[music swells]

861
01:00:23,418 --> 01:00:24,578
爸爸
Dad.

862
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,950
厉害
Yes!

863
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,000
[laughing]

864
01:00:36,497 --> 01:00:37,987
很精彩
Bravo. That was a really great Experience.

865

866
01:00:42,103 --> 01:00:44,435
大家静一点  留神
Ok, quiet down. Let's concentrate.

867
01:00:44,606 --> 01:00:46,096
干得好
Chloe: That was good work.

868
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,970
Whoo!

869
01:00:47,508 --> 01:00:49,408
开香槟庆祝
Tech: let's get Some champagne up here.

870
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,572
基斯督  太精彩了
Congratulations. Moses: brilliant, christof. Just brilliant.

871
01:00:53,648 --> 01:00:55,411
多么感人肺腑
Roman: It just broke my heart.

872
01:00:59,621 --> 01:01:02,488
-大家干得好  恭喜 -好…
Well done, everyone!

873
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,660
Bravo!

874
01:01:10,565 --> 01:01:14,228
(楚门喝尼加拉瓜山出产)

875
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:17,032
(由顶级可可炼制的莫可可)

876
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:23,301
十七亿人见证他出生
Announcer: 1.7 billion Were there for his birth.

877
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:26,375
(巨星诞生)

878
01:01:27,448 --> 01:01:30,611
220个国家收看他学走路
220 countries tuned in For his first step.

879
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:35,017
举世静观他初吻
The world stood still For that stolen kiss,

880
01:01:35,223 --> 01:01:37,623
他与科技并肩成长
And as he grew, So did the technology.

881
01:01:37,959 --> 01:01:42,419
一个人的一生 由秘密摄影网络记录下来
An entire human life Recorded on an intricate Network of hidden cameras

882
01:01:42,497 --> 01:01:46,160
原汁原味  一天二十四小时
And broadcast live and Unedited 24 hours a day,

883
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:49,930
在全球不停直播
7 days a week to an audience Around the globe.

884
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:56,467
桃源岛是一个 规模空前庞大的片场
Coming to you now From seahaven island, Enclosed in the largest Studio ever constructed

885
01:01:56,611 --> 01:01:59,102
从太空俯瞰地球可以看到的
And along with The great wall of china,

886
01:01:59,147 --> 01:02:02,639
唯有桃源岛和万里长城
One of only 2 manmade structures Visible from space,

887
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:06,350
"真人表演"已经踏入

888
01:02:06,454 --> 01:02:09,116
光辉的第三十年
Now in its 30th great year, It's...

889
01:02:13,027 --> 01:02:14,255
过去一个星期
What a week it's been.

890
01:02:14,362 --> 01:02:17,263
高潮迭起  好戏连场
I don't know about you--I was on pins and needles The entire time.

891
01:02:17,332 --> 01:02:20,130
各位观众好  我是米高
Hello and good evening. I'm your host mike michaelson,

892
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:23,999
欢迎收看"真人表演"的 清谈节目"真话"
And welcome to  tru-talk, Our forum for issues Growing out of the show.

893
01:02:24,205 --> 01:02:27,106
今晚千载难逢
But tonight, Something very special indeed,

894
01:02:27,175 --> 01:02:31,612
会独家专访 "真人表演"的创作人
A rare and Exclusive interview With the show's Conceiver and creator.

895
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:38,983
我们上去天网摄制 221楼的太阴室
So, come with us now as we Go live to the lunar room On the 221st floor Of the omni cam echosphere

896
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,453
采访超级电视摄制的先驱
Where we'll find the world's Greatest tele-visionary--

897
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:46,583
桃源岛的设计者和总监
The designer and architect Of the world within a world

898
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:48,218
基斯督
That is seahaven island-- Christof.

899
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:53,733
我先代表观众多谢你接受专访
Before we begin, I'd like to thank you On behalf of our audience For granting this interview.

900
01:02:53,801 --> 01:02:59,137
我们知道你工作繁忙 一向作风都是尽量低调
We know how demanding Your schedule is And we all know how jealously You guard your privacy.

901
01:02:59,307 --> 01:03:01,571
能够采访你  我深感荣幸
This, sir, Is indeed an honor.

902
01:03:01,709 --> 01:03:02,698
不要客气
Don't mention it.

903
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:06,337
"真人表演"最近的一波三折
Well, the catalyst for The recent dramatic events

904
01:03:06,381 --> 01:03:10,511
起因是楚门的父亲偷偷回去
On the show has been Truman's father, kirk

905
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:14,347
外面的人擅闯桃源要接触楚门
And his attempts To infiltrate the show.

906
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,290
But before we get into that, I think it's worth noting

907
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:18,220
这并不是首次  对不对?
That this is not the first time Someone from the outside

908
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:20,088
但都是有惊无险
Has attempted To reach truman, is it? Christof: we have had Close calls in the past.

909
01:03:20,228 --> 01:03:22,560
楚门  上电视了
Man: truman! It's television!

910
01:03:22,697 --> 01:03:27,657
我终于上了"真人表演"
Yes! Yes! I did it! I'm on  the truman show!

911
01:03:28,136 --> 01:03:29,694
但历来的擅闯事件中
Mike: but there's never Been anything to compare

912
01:03:29,737 --> 01:03:32,331
最近这次最严重
With this most recent Breach in security--

913
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,705
因为擅闯的人是前任演员
The first intruder to be A former cast member.

914
01:03:35,777 --> 01:03:36,766
而且本来已经死了
A dead one at that.

915
01:03:37,078 --> 01:03:41,037
你让却克复出  是神来之笔
Gotta say, writing kirk Back in--masterstroke.

916
01:03:41,149 --> 01:03:43,481
既然这场风波由却克引起
Since kirk started this Crisis in truman's life,

917
01:03:43,551 --> 01:03:46,782
我认为解铃还须系铃人
I came to the conclusion That only he could end it.

918
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:48,784
阿仁…
Truman! Truman!

919
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:53,254
-不准过去 -那里有什么?
No! That's off limits! Why? What's Over there?

920
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,870
[construction noises]

921
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:55,691
没什么  只是危险
Nothing. It's dangerous. That's all.

922
01:03:55,797 --> 01:03:58,288
你要记着  有些地方不可以去
You've got to know Your limitations, truman.

923
01:03:58,399 --> 01:04:02,062
当年为什么删除却克这角色?
Mike: but let's remind Viewers exactly why Dad was written out In the first place.

924
01:04:02,203 --> 01:04:07,539
楚门长大 我们设法把他留在桃源岛
Christof: as truman grew up, We were forced To manufacture ways To keep him on the island.

925
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:10,776
我想做探险家  像麦哲伦一样
I'd like to be An explorer, Like the great Magellan.

926
01:04:10,845 --> 01:04:14,406
现在世上已没什么好探险的
You're too late. There's really Nothing left to explore.

927
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,390
[snarling]

928
01:04:19,187 --> 01:04:21,678
于是  我安排却克浸死
Christof: finally, i came up With kirk's drowning.

929
01:04:21,823 --> 01:04:25,259
那办法很有效  楚门从此怕水
Mike: most effective. Truman's been terrified Of the water ever since.

930
01:04:25,493 --> 01:04:28,462
却克被迫浸死  退出节目
Christof: when kirk read The synopsis of the episode,

931
01:04:28,529 --> 01:04:31,362
不消说  失望得很
He was disappointed To say the least.

932
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,462
于是千方百计潜回片场
Jesus! I'm sure that's what caused Him to break onto the set.

933
01:04:35,536 --> 01:04:39,267
但你怎解释他失踪了二十二年
But how do you intend to Explain his 22-year absence?

934
01:04:40,274 --> 01:04:41,502
失忆
Amnesia.

935
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:43,308
高明
Brilliant.

936
01:04:43,478 --> 01:04:44,877
现在接听观众电话
Let's take Some viewer phone calls.

937
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:48,445
北卡州的卡露莲  请说
Charlotte, north carolina, You're on with christof.

938
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:50,816
你好  基斯督
Man: uh, yeah, Hi, christof.

939
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:54,711
你在镇上布置了多少部摄影机
I was wondering how many Cameras you got in that town.

940
01:04:55,189 --> 01:04:57,350
五千部左右
Somewhere in The vicinity of 5,000.

941
01:04:57,492 --> 01:04:59,392
好多
Man: that's A lot of cameras.

942
01:05:00,128 --> 01:05:02,619
记着  我开始时只用一部
Remember, we started With just one.

943
01:05:03,898 --> 01:05:08,562
他一出生就好奇  早产两星期
He was curious From birth. Premature by 2 weeks.

944
01:05:08,669 --> 01:05:10,762
就像迫不及待
Almost as if he couldn't Wait to get started.

945
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:13,572
正因为他急于走出娘胎
Mike: his eagerness To leave his mother's womb

946
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:15,835
所以才获选
Was the very reason He was the one selected.

947
01:05:15,943 --> 01:05:18,605
我们从六个待领养胎儿中
In competition with 5 other Unwanted pregnancies,

948
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:21,170
选出楚门  因为楚门…
The casting of a show, Determined by an air date

949
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:23,773
在现场直播中  准时出世
Truman was the one Who arrived on cue.

950
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:31,456
楚门似乎是首名被机构
Mike: incidentally, i believe Truman is the first child

951
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:33,722
合法领养的孩子
To have been legally adopted By a corporation.

952
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:34,890
对
That's correct.

953
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:38,326
节目带来庞大的收益
The show has generated Enormous revenues now,

954
01:05:38,432 --> 01:05:41,424
相当于一个小国的年产总值
Equivalent to the gross national Product of a small country.

955
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:44,767
但制作上也需要一国的人手
People forget it takes The population

956
01:05:44,906 --> 01:05:48,637
因为二十四小时播放 没广告时间
Of an entire country to Keep the show running.

957
01:05:48,776 --> 01:05:52,837
收入全靠商品的选用
Since the show is on 24-hours a day Without commercial interruption, All those staggering revenues Are generated By product placement.

958
01:05:53,214 --> 01:05:54,943
对  节目上一切都是发售的
That's true. Everything On the show is for sale.

959
01:05:55,283 --> 01:05:58,184
演员的服装、食品、住屋等等
From the actor's wardrobe, Food products, To the very homes They live in.

960
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,753
详情请参阅真人目录
Mike: and all of it available In the truman catalog.

961
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:02,513
欢迎随时来电查询
Operators are standing by.

962
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,454
基斯督  请问…
Christof, let me ask you,

963
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,960
为什么至今楚门还不知道
Why do you think truman Has never come close

964
01:06:08,262 --> 01:06:11,356
自己活在一个什么样的世界?
To discovering the true nature Of his world until now?

965
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:15,358
我们都接受现实
We accept the reality Of the world With which we are Presented.

966
01:06:15,436 --> 01:06:16,494
就是那么简单
It's as simple as that.

967
01:06:17,405 --> 01:06:21,967
海牙有观众打电话来  海牙?
The hague for christof. Hello? The hague?

968
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:26,880
现在改接好莱坞的电话
All right, We've lost that call. Let's go to hollywood. You're on  tru-talk.

969
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:31,351
基斯督  我只想说你好阴险
Hi, christof. I'd just Like to say one thing. You're a liar And a manipulator,

970
01:06:31,485 --> 01:06:33,214
你的所作所为令人恶心
And what you've done To truman is sick!

971
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:39,524
我们都认得这把声音 怎能忘记?
Well, we remember This voice, don't we? How could we forget?

972
01:06:39,627 --> 01:06:40,958
不如改接另一个电话
Mike: let's go To another call.

973
01:06:41,229 --> 01:06:44,221
不要紧  米高
No, no, no. It's fine, mike.

974
01:06:44,332 --> 01:06:46,994
我想跟前度演员聚聚旧
I love to reminisce with Former members of the cast.

975
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,034
施维亚
Sylvia...

976
01:06:50,938 --> 01:06:53,498
你当众o妇骂街  其实没意思
As you announced so Melodramatically to the world,

977
01:06:54,842 --> 01:06:58,903
你以为自己曾向楚门抛眉弄眼
You think because you batted Your eyes at truman once...

978
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:04,308
打情骂俏 曾和他一起出镜几分钟
Flirted with him...Stole a few minutes Of air time with him...

979
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:07,249
卖弄过自己和自己的政见
To thrust yourself and your Politics into the limelight...

980
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:08,816
就以为了解他?
That you know him?

981
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:11,253
知道什么才适合他?
That you know What's right for him?

982
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,520
有资格去评论他?
You really think you're In a position to judge him?

983
01:07:13,628 --> 01:07:15,789
你有什么权…
What right do you have To take a baby

984
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:19,322
把一个人的一生  塑造成闹剧
And turn his life into Some kind of mockery?

985
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:21,534
你一点也不觉得内疚?
Don't you ever Feel guilty?

986
01:07:23,404 --> 01:07:27,306
我为楚门提供一个正常的人生
I have given truman a chance To lead a normal life.

987
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:34,037
这个你所住的世界是病态的
The world...The place you live in...Is the sick place.

988
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:37,985
桃源才是模范的世界
Seahaven's the way The world should be.

989
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:39,685
他不是演员  是囚犯
He's not a performer. He's a prisoner.

990
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:42,050
任由你摆布
Look at him! Look at What you've done to him!

991
01:07:42,323 --> 01:07:43,722
他随时可以走
He can leave at any time.

992
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:46,391
假如他稍有野心
If his was more Than just a vague ambition,

993
01:07:46,527 --> 01:07:50,623
假如他下定决心要查出真相
If he was absolutely determined To discover the truth,

994
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:53,390
我们无法阻止他
There's no way We could prevent him.

995
01:07:53,868 --> 01:07:58,999
你不安  其实另有原因
I think what distresses You really, caller,

996
01:07:59,674 --> 01:08:05,806
就是楚门甘愿坐你所谓的监狱
Is that ultimately...Truman prefers his cell, As you call it.

997
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,379
你错了
That's where You're wrong.

998
01:08:08,015 --> 01:08:11,507
大错特错  他会证明你是错的
You're so wrong, and He'll prove you wrong.

999
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:15,713
观众甚少有恶评
Mike: well, aside from The heated comments Of a very Vocal minority

1000
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:18,452
绝大部分都说它有益世道人心
It's been an overwhelmingly Positive experience.

1001
01:08:18,526 --> 01:08:20,994
对楚门、对观众  都有裨益
Yes. For truman and For the viewing public.

1002
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:23,655
基斯督  万分感谢
Well, christof, I can't thank you enough

1004
01:08:25,566 --> 01:08:28,535
现在危机已成过去
I think it's safe to say now That this crisis is behind us

1005
01:08:28,602 --> 01:08:30,536
楚门恢复了常态
And truman is back To his old self,

1006
01:08:30,604 --> 01:08:33,038
节目会不会有新发展?
We can look forward to some Exciting new developments?

1007
01:08:33,074 --> 01:08:35,008
未来的大事是

Is that meryl Will be leaving truman In an upcoming episode

1009
01:08:38,913 --> 01:08:41,848
楚门将会有第二春
And a new romantic interest Will be introduced.

1010
01:08:42,049 --> 01:08:44,711
我决定将性交过程
Mike: aha. I'm determined television's First on-air conception

1011
01:08:44,785 --> 01:08:46,844

1012

01:10:14,842 --> 01:10:16,571
-西文 -什么事?
Hey, simeon. What?

1018
01:10:21,248 --> 01:10:22,738
他是不是看着我们?
Is he looking at us?

1019
01:10:23,117 --> 01:10:24,948
不得了  难道他看出了破绽?
Jesus, do you Think he knows?

1020
01:10:26,454 --> 01:10:27,682
你好?

1021

而是生死无常的事

Stabbed in the heart by the tip Of a runaway beach umbrella.

1058
01:12:39,987 --> 01:12:41,978

1059
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,940

我的意思是…
I guess what i'm--

1065
01:12:58,072 --> 01:13:00,336
生命脆弱
What i'm saying is that, Uh, life is...fragile.

1066
01:13:02,409 --> 01:13:04,240
-慧云  你的办公室 -对不起

他在地下室干什么?
Christof: what's he doing In the basement?

1078
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,858
美露走后  他搬了下去
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.

1079
01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:05,700

Why wasn't i told? Any unpredictable behavior Has to be reported.

1080
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:09,441
他在睡觉  我以为…

被东西挡着
It's an obstruction-- Obstruction.

1084

1104

闭嘴  观察
Christof: Shut up and watch it!

1267
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,021
你是真的
You were real.

1268
01:32:50,096 --> 01:32:52,155
所以才有那么多人看你
That's what made you So good to watch.

1269
01:32:52,999 --> 01:32:54,261
听我劝告
Listen to me, truman.

1270
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:56,824
外面的世界…
There's no more truth Out there...

1271
01:32:57,904 --> 01:33:00,600
跟我给你的世界一样的虚假
Than there is in the world I created for you.

1272
01:33:02,508 --> 01:33:03,998
有一样的谎言
The same lies.

1273
01:33:05,545 --> 01:33:07,274
一样的欺诈
The same deceit.

1274
01:33:08,181 --> 01:33:10,012
但在我的世界
But in my world...

1275
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,309
你什么也不用怕
You have nothing To fear.

1276
01:33:16,455 --> 01:33:18,355
我比你更清楚你自己
I know you better Than you know yourself.

1277
01:33:18,491 --> 01:33:20,823
你无法在我脑内装摄影机
You never had A camera in my head.

1278
01:33:23,095 --> 01:33:24,357
你害怕
You're afraid.

1279
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:27,462
所以你不能走
That's why You can't leave.

1280
01:33:32,271 --> 01:33:36,207
楚门  不要紧  我明白
It's ok, truman. I understand.

1281
01:33:37,443 --> 01:33:40,105
我看了你的一生
I have been watching you Your whole life.

1282
01:33:42,448 --> 01:33:45,212
你出生时  我在看你
I was watching When you were born.

1283
01:33:47,253 --> 01:33:50,416
你学走路时  我在看你
I was watching when you Took your first step.

1284
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:56,961
你入学  我在看你
I watched you on your First day of school.

1285
01:33:59,465 --> 01:34:02,161
还有你掉第一颗牙齿那一幕
[laughs]The episode when you Lost your first tooth.

1286
01:34:06,672 --> 01:34:08,503
你不能离开  楚门
You can't leave, truman.

1287
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,404
上帝  求求你
Please, god.

1288
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:13,000
你属于这里
Christof: You belong here...

1289
01:34:13,346 --> 01:34:15,075
你可以走出去
You can do it.

1290
01:34:16,349 --> 01:34:17,680
跟我一起吧
With me.

1291
01:34:20,186 --> 01:34:21,414
回答我
Talk to me.

1292
01:34:22,688 --> 01:34:24,349
说句话
Say something.

1293
01:34:28,261 --> 01:34:31,492
说话!你上了电视
Well, say something, Goddamn it. You're on television.

1294
01:34:31,597 --> 01:34:33,895
正在向全世界直播
You're live To the whole world.

1295
01:34:51,417 --> 01:34:53,146
假如再碰不见你…
In case i don't see you...

1296
01:34:54,287 --> 01:34:56,721
祝你早、午、晚都安
Good afternoon, good evening, And good night.

1297
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,570
Yep.

1298
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:26,300
Yeah! Yeah!

1299
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:31,470
He did it. He did it.

1300
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,350
He did it! He did it!

1301
01:35:35,695 --> 01:35:39,096
他走脱了  走吧  楚门
He made it! Yeah! All right, truman!

1302
01:35:48,474 --> 01:35:50,704
停播…
Cease transmission.

1303
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:51,580
Ceasing Transmission.

1304
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:54,210
[taps keyboard]

1305
01:35:55,548 --> 01:35:57,778

You want another slice? No. I'm ok.
