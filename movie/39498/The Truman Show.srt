1
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:24,632
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phoney emotions.

2
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:28,970
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

3
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:34,511
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit, -

4
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:38,479
- there's nothing fake
about Truman himself.

5
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,691
No scripts, no cue cards.

6
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:47,363
It isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine. It's a life.

7
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm not gonna make it. You're
gonna have to go on without me.

8
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,546
No way, mister.

9
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:07,634
You're going to the top of
this mountain, broken legs and all.

10
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:15,266
Many viewers
leave him on all night, for comfort.

11
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,062
You're crazy, you know that?

12
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:26,903
For me there's no difference between
private life and public life.

13
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:32,492
My life is The Truman Show.
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,332
It's a noble life.
It is... a truly blessed life.

15
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,294
Tell me something I don't know.

16
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:47,173
All right.
Promise me one thing, though.

17
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:53,513
If I die before the summit, use me
as an alternative source of food.

18
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,765
You're gross.

19
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:01,646
It's all real.

20
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:07,151
Nothing you see on the show is fake.
It's merely controlled.

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,616
THE TRUMAN SHOW

22
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:19,330
Eat me, dammit. That's an order.

23
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:24,085
Maybe just your love handles.

24
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:28,047
I have love handles?
Yeah, little ones.

25
00:02:28,256 --> 00:02:32,802
- Truman, you're gonna be late.
- Okay!

26
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:45,982
DAY 10,909

27
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,736
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

28
00:02:49,944 --> 00:02:55,325
And in case I don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

29
00:02:56,868 --> 00:03:00,705
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer. Hey, Pluto.

30
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:05,335
- He won't hurt you.
- I know. It's just me.

31
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:08,254
Come on, Pluto.

32
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,653
What is it?

33
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:56,260
<i>An aircraft began shedding parts</i>
<i>as it flew over Seahaven</i> -

34
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,431
- <i>a few moments ago.</i>
<i>Luckily, no one was hurt.</i>

35
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,851
<i>How do you feel today...?</i>
<i>That's good.</i>

36
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,313
- <i>Thinking of flying somewhere</i>?
- Nope.

37
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:12,443
<i>This is classical Klyne.</i>
<i>Forget about the perils of flying</i> -

38
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,989
- <i>and let this music calm you down.</i>

39
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,246
"Dog Fancy", please.
Thank you very much.

40
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,917
Get me a paper, will you, Errol?

41
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:32,630
And one of these for the wife.
Loves her fashion mags.

42
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,176
- That be all for you, Truman?
- That's the whole kit and caboodle.

43
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:50,273
- Hank!
- Good morning, Truman.

44
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:55,903
Good morning, Truman.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

45
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:59,574
- How's your lovely wife?
- Good. Yours?

46
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:02,702
Couldn't be better.

47
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,457
- Nice talking to you.
- You too. Think about that policy.

48
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:11,878
Two for one. That's a good deal.
Doppelgänger special.

49
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:19,594
Hey, fellas.
Going in? Go ahead.

50
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:24,515
- Go ahead.
- I'm not that anxious to get there.

51
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:44,327
Could I have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji Islands.

52
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:47,538
Truman, did you see this?

53
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:53,211
I'm sorry, ma'am. If he's in a coma
he's probably uninsurable.

54
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:59,342
Yes, Fiji. Do you have a listing
for Lauren Garland?

55
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,596
Nothing listed...

56
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:09,102
Do you have a Sylvia Garland?
S for Sylvia.

57
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:14,732
Nothing...
Okay, thank you.

58
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:56,482
- Lawrence.
- I've got a prospect in Wells Park.

59
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:03,615
Wells Park?
On... Harbour Island?

60
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:09,245
- You know another one?
- I can't. I have an appointment.

61
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:11,706
Dentist, or... yeah.

62
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:17,003
You'll lose more than your teeth
if you don't meet your quota.

63
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:21,758
They're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

64
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:28,181
You need this. Besides, a half hour
across the bay will do you good.

65
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,559
Thanks.

66
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:44,948
Hello. Ferry's still here, huh?
Thought I might have missed it.

67
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:49,285
- One way or return?
- Return.

68
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:54,791
There you go, sir.

69
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:55,810
- Do you need any help, sir?
- You go ahead, I'll be fine.

70
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:13,411
Hi, honey.

71
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,499
Look what I got free at
the checkout. It's a "Chef's Pal".

72
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:23,630
It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in
one. No sharpening, dishwater-safe.

73
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:27,592
Wow... that's amazing.

74
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,264
Truman... you missed a spot.

75
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:50,657
That is a beer.

76
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:56,120
- I'm thinking about getting out.
- Yeah? Out of what?

77
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,541
Out of my job. Out of Seahaven.
Off this island. Out.

78
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,422
What the hell's wrong with yourjob?
You've got a great job. A desk job.

79
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:10,009
I'd kill for a desk job.

80
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:17,809
You should try stocking vending
machines. Now <i>there's</i> excitement.

81
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:23,356
- Don't you ever get antsy?
- Where's there to go?

82
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,697
- Fiji.
- Where's Fiji? Near Florida?

83
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:40,873
See here? This is us...

84
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:45,712
And all the way
around here... Fiji.

85
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,717
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

86
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:57,223
There's still islands in Fiji where
no human being has ever set foot.

87
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:02,395
So when are you gonna go?

88
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:05,732
It's not that simple.

89
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,028
It takes money, planning...

90
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:15,033
- You can't just up and go.
- Right.

91
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,911
I'm gonna do it,
don't worry about that.

92
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,000
Bonus time
is just around the corner.

93
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:30,048
- Are you coming for a drink?
- No, I can't tonight.

94
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:54,197
<i>I don't like that weather, son.</i>
<i>We should head back.</i>

95
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:57,492
<i>Just a bit farther. Please?</i>

96
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,662
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Yes!</i>

97
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,958
<i>Daddy!</i>

98
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:21,409
You're soaked.
Where have you been?

99
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:25,872
- We can scrape together 8,000...
- You and Marlon...

100
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,960
- We can bum around the world.
- And then what?

101
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:35,882
- You're talking like a teenager.
- Maybe I feel like a teenager.

102
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:43,056
We have mortgage payments. Do we
just walk away from our obligations?

103
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:48,311
- It would be an adventure.
- We were going to try for a baby.

104
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,815
- Isn't that enough of an adventure?
- That can wait.

105
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:57,904
I want to get away.
See some of the world. Explore!

106
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:01,699
You want to be an explorer...

107
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:06,704
This will pass.
We all think like this now and then.

108
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:14,629
Let's get you out
of these wet clothes. Come to bed.

109
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:21,594
You never see anything. They always
turn the camera and play music.

110
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:25,974
The wind blows, the curtain moves.
You don't see anything.

111
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,108
"Dog Fancy", please.
Thank you.

112
00:14:37,652 --> 00:14:40,488
Paper, Earl, please.

113
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:43,783
I might as well get one of these.

114
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:47,745
- For the wife?
- She's got to have them.

115
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:52,542
- Anything else, Truman?
- That's the whole ball of wax.

116
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,941
Dad?

117
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:21,487
Hey, what are you doing?

118
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:25,992
Get out of the way!

119
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:32,373
Stop those people!
Stop! Stop!

120
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:37,378
Open the door! Somebody
stop the bus! Stop the bus!

121
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:42,759
Somebody stop it!
Stop the bus!

122
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:07,283
It doesn't sound insane at all.

123
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:11,120
I see him ten times a week.

124
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:15,249
I almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon...

125
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,045
It was Dad.
Dressed like a homeless man.

126
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:25,718
And a businessman and a lady
with a dog forced him onto a bus.

127
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:31,182
It's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown.

128
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,811
They never found Dad's body.

129
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:41,359
If it wasn't him, it was his twin!
Did Dad have a brother?

130
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:46,739
You know perfectly well
that your father was an only child.

131
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:50,368
Just like you.

132
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:57,959
Sweetie... You're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

133
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:01,296
You sailing off into that storm...

134
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:08,928
But I've never blamed you.
And I don't blame you now.

135
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:58,603
Truman...?

136
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,776
What are you doing down here?

137
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,237
Fixing the mower.

138
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:15,453
- I saw my father today.
- I know.

139
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:18,790
Your mother called.

140
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,793
You shouldn't upset her like that.

141
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:27,090
- What did you want?
- I made macaroni.

142
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:30,468
- I'm not hungry.
- You know...

143
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:34,138
We ought to throw out that mower.

144
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:38,935
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

145
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:15,596
What's he doing?

146
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:20,143
They got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

147
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:23,646
10,910
NUMBER OF DAYS RUNNING

148
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:18,242
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me. Sorry I fell on you.

149
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:24,123
I've been such a klutz all day.
I must have sprained this ankle.

150
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:29,295
- I'm so sorry to fall on you.
- Don't worry about it.

151
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:33,967
- I'm Meryl.
- Hi, I'm Truman.

152
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:03,806
- Truman, you've studied enough.
- I've got to commit this to memory.

153
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:07,393
Come on, an ice-cold brewsky.

154
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:11,522
You're gonna have to copy off me,
so be careful.

155
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:15,693
You're a better person than I am.

156
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:19,030
- See you later.
- Bye.

157
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:22,116
See you later, loser.

158
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,512
Hi.

159
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:30,268
- <i>Konnichi-wa.</i>
- What?

160
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:35,189
- You take Japanese.
- Oh, yes...

161
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,486
Lauren, right?

162
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:44,949
- It's on the...
- Lauren, right.

163
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:50,580
- I'm Truman Burbank.
- Yeah, I know.

164
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:55,793
- I'm not allowed to talk to you.
- Really?

165
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:03,468
- I'm a pretty dangerous character.
- I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

166
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:09,432
Girls have got to be careful.

167
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:13,186
- You have a boyfriend, right?
- It's not that.

168
00:24:13,394 --> 00:24:18,524
Was it Meryl, the girl I was with?
We're not... We're just friends.

169
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:22,779
- It's nothing like that.
- It's how I look? Not your type?

170
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:27,241
No.

171
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,410
HOW'S IT GOING TO END?

172
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:33,289
I was wondering that myself.

173
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:39,754
Would you maybe, possibly
sometime go out for some pizza?

174
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:43,925
- Like, Friday? Saturday?
- I can't.

175
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,803
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

176
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:49,138
NOW

177
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:54,394
- We have finals tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

178
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:59,607
If we don't go now,
it won't happen. Do you understand?

179
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:03,444
So what do you want to do?

180
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:39,188
Please keep your hands
inside the car!

181
00:25:55,997 --> 00:26:01,919
This is my favourite pizza place.
Tony, one large, extra plankton!

182
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:06,382
We have so little time.
They'll be here any minute.

183
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:11,638
- They don't want me talking to you.
- Then don't talk.

184
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:27,904
They're here.

185
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:32,033
- What do they want?
- Listen to me.

186
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:37,538
Everybody knows everything you do.
They're pretending. Understand?

187
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:43,419
- My name's not Lauren, it's Sylvia.
- Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

188
00:26:43,628 --> 00:26:46,756
- Who are you?
- Her father.

189
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:51,177
I've never seen him before.
Truman, don't listen to him.

190
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:55,098
Everything I've told you
is the truth.

191
00:26:55,306 --> 00:27:00,603
It's fake. It's all for you. The sky
and the sea. Everything is a set!

192
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:05,900
Please, don't listen to him.
He's gonna lie to you.

193
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:10,947
- I want to know what's going on.
- Schizophrenia. We've tried it all.

194
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:16,786
Hypnotism, shock therapy...
Don't worry, you're not the first.

195
00:27:16,995 --> 00:27:21,791
- She brings all her boys down here.
- Truman, he's lying!

196
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,794
Get out of here. Come and find me.

197
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:29,924
- I'll see you in school.
- We're moving to Fiji.

198
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:43,354
Sylvia! Hey!

199
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:58,411
- Why didn't he just follow her?
- His mother got really sick.

200
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,874
He couldn't leave her.
He's kind. Maybe he's too kind.

201
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:07,128
I can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

202
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:12,675
Come on, Sal. We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

203
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:29,484
HOW'S IT GOING TO END?

204
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:03,685
Close, but no cigar.

205
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:35,675
<i>Another beautiful day in paradise.</i>
<i>But don't forget to buckle up.</i>

206
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:05,204
<i>He's heading west on Stuart.</i>
<i>Stand by, all extras.</i>

207
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:09,000
<i>He's turning onto Lancaster Square.</i>

208
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:16,924
<i>My God, he nearly hit her! Something</i>
<i>is wrong. Change frequencies.</i>

209
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:27,977
<i>Sorry about that, folks. I guess</i>
<i>we picked up a police frequency.</i>

210
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:34,025
<i>It's classical Klyne, and we've</i>
<i>still got some great music ahead.</i>

211
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:39,489
<i>But buckle up. Remember safety.</i>
<i>A good driver is a safe driver.</i>

212
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:45,286
CRACKDOWN ON HOMELESS
City Fathers: "Enough is Enough"

213
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:48,052
- Can I help?
- I have an appointment.

214
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:57,020
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

215
00:33:57,228 --> 00:34:01,149
- Just tell me what's happening.
- We're remodelling.

216
00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:05,111
- It's none of your business.
- Tell me, or I'll report you!

217
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,114
You're trespassing.

218
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:42,607
- Marlon!
- Truman, what are you doing here?

219
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:48,112
I've got to talk to you.
I'm on to something big!

220
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:52,200
- You look like shit.
- I think I'm mixed up in something.

221
00:34:52,408 --> 00:34:56,996
A lot of strange things
have been happening.

222
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,005
The people on the elevator,
there was no backing on it...

223
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:12,095
And the radio starts following me,
talking about everything I'm doing.

224
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:17,016
- This is one of your fantasies.
- I think this is about my dad.

225
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:22,897
I think he's alive. I'll tell you
about it later. I'm being followed.

226
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:25,984
Who?

227
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:30,071
It's hard to tell.
They look like regular people.

228
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:37,328
- How about those two?
- Could be.

229
00:35:37,537 --> 00:35:43,084
It's when I'm unpredictable.
That's when they can't...

230
00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:47,171
Anything happen...?
We have to get out of here.

231
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,508
- You ready to go?
- I can't.

232
00:35:55,513 --> 00:36:00,518
- You're gonna get us both fired.
- Okay then, let's do it.

233
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:06,524
Whatever you say, I'm game.
Your birthday comes but once a year!

234
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,990
Maybe I'm being set up
for something.

235
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:18,828
You ever think that your whole life
has been building toward something?

236
00:36:19,037 --> 00:36:21,539
No.

237
00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:27,670
When you were hauling chickens,
how far did you get off the island?

238
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:32,425
I went all over. Never found
a place like this, though.

239
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:36,471
Look at that sunset. It's perfect.

240
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:42,936
That's the big guy.
Quite a paintbrush he's got.

241
00:36:48,149 --> 00:36:51,778
Just between you and me, Marlon...

242
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:56,866
- I'm going away for a while.
- Really?

243
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:12,966
My little clown...
Old carrot-top.

244
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:18,388
The best photos...

245
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:23,226
- We should be getting you home.
- Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

246
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:29,899
Do you remember, Truman?
You slept the whole way there.

247
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:34,821
- It looks so small.
- Things do, when you look back.

248
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:39,534
Look, Truman.
The happiest day of our lives.

249
00:37:39,742 --> 00:37:44,622
- Look! Jean, Jodie, Joanne...
- Doesn't she look beautiful?

250
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:48,751
Well, she still does.

251
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,550
There's room for baby photos. I want
to hold a grandchild before I go.

252
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:59,971
We really should get you home.
No, you stay. Relax.

253
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:05,852
- Your favourite show is coming on.
- And we have something to discuss.

254
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,690
- A certain person's birthday.
- Oh, I see.

255
00:38:10,898 --> 00:38:17,530
<i>There'll be another "Lucy" tomorrow.</i>
<i>Now it's time for Golden Oldies.</i>

256
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:22,619
<i>Tonight we present the classic:</i>
<i>"Show Me the Way to Go Home".</i>

257
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:28,458
<i>You don't have to leave home to</i>
<i>discover what the world is about.</i>

258
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:32,629
<i>We learn that no one is poor</i>
<i>who has friends.</i>

259
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:40,053
<i>Full of laughter, love, pain,</i>
<i>sadness, but ultimately, redemption.</i>

260
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:47,352
<i>The cherry scene will have you</i>
<i>splitting your sides with laughter.</i>

261
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,357
<i>There'll be tears, too, when</i>
<i>David and Jennifer are reunited.</i>

262
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:56,736
<i>Let'sjoin the Abbotts</i>
<i>in Camden Village.</i>

263
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:26,432
Thank you, Sweetie.

264
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:33,398
I need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

265
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:38,736
- I'd love to, but I'm really late.
- What's your rush?

266
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:43,533
There was that elevator disaster.
It was on the news.

267
00:39:43,741 --> 00:39:49,372
The cable just snapped.
The elevator plummeted ten flights.

268
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:55,169
Right next door to where you work.
What if you had been in there?

269
00:39:55,378 --> 00:40:00,633
Anyway, I have an amputation on
one of the women from the elevator.

270
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:05,179
She's very young. It's sad.
Wish me luck.

271
00:40:05,388 --> 00:40:09,517
I'll cross my fingers for you.

272
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:53,561
Excuse me. May I help you?

273
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:58,191
I'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. It's very important.

274
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:01,861
That's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

275
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:08,076
Sure... Okay, fine.
Can you pass along a message?

276
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:11,955
I had to go to Fiji.
I'll call when I get there.

277
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:15,500
- When you get to Fiji?
- You got it.

278
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:19,087
- Fine. I'll tell her.
- Thank you so much.

279
00:41:45,863 --> 00:41:48,283
Sorry.

280
00:41:49,284 --> 00:41:52,161
Let me help you with that.

281
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:58,918
He's here.

282
00:42:01,629 --> 00:42:03,923
Scalpel.

283
00:42:09,637 --> 00:42:13,766
I'm now making
my primary incision, -

284
00:42:13,975 --> 00:42:17,562
- just above the right knee.

285
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:25,737
- Nicely done.
- Unless you're family...

286
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:32,619
- It's just a beautiful job.
- I'll let someone else tidy up.

287
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:38,207
TRAVELLERS BEWARE

288
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,222
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!

289
00:42:58,436 --> 00:43:03,232
- I'm sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

290
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:08,613
- How can I help?
- I'd like a flight to Fiji.

291
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:12,951
- When would you like to leave?
- Today.

292
00:43:30,927 --> 00:43:35,640
I'm sorry. I don't have anything
for at least a month.

293
00:43:35,848 --> 00:43:39,686
It's the busy season.

294
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:42,981
Do you want to book the flight?

295
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:46,442
I'll make other arrangements.

296
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:54,701
Last call for Chicago!
All aboard!

297
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,625
Thank you.

298
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:08,548
Windy City, here we come.

299
00:44:08,756 --> 00:44:11,259
Hi!

300
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:17,098
Hello...

301
00:44:17,307 --> 00:44:22,520
- Mom, isn't that you know you?
- Face the front.

302
00:44:49,631 --> 00:44:52,884
Everybody off, we've got a problem.

303
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:14,989
I'm sorry, son.

304
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:33,341
- Wasn't his father from Chicago?
- His father was from Des Moines.

305
00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:39,847
- Why does he want to go to Chicago?
- He's not going anywhere.

306
00:45:56,906 --> 00:45:59,909
Truman?

307
00:46:03,288 --> 00:46:06,416
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get in.

308
00:46:10,378 --> 00:46:13,715
- Truman...
- Look.

309
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:26,352
I predict that, in just a moment,
we'll see a lady on a red bike -

310
00:46:26,561 --> 00:46:32,108
- followed by a man with flowers and
a Volkswagen with a dented fender.

311
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:35,486
- Truman, please...
- Look!

312
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:42,910
Lady...

313
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,371
Flowers...

314
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,874
- And...?
- And...

315
00:46:50,293 --> 00:46:55,632
- Truman, this is silly.
- There's the dented Beetle! Yes!

316
00:47:02,931 --> 00:47:07,143
You know how I did that?
They're on a loop.

317
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:12,899
They go around the block, they
come back, they go around again.

318
00:47:13,107 --> 00:47:17,612
- I invited Marlon to barbecue...
- I won't be here.

319
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,406
We need more charcoal.

320
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:25,244
Are you listening
to a word I'm saying?

321
00:47:25,453 --> 00:47:29,207
You're upset
because you want to go to Fiji?

322
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:33,086
Okay, go.

323
00:47:35,088 --> 00:47:39,634
I think you should save
for a few months, and then go.

324
00:47:39,842 --> 00:47:42,553
I'm going to take a shower.

325
00:47:46,557 --> 00:47:49,686
Let's go now.
I'm ready. Why wait?

326
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:54,691
Early bird gathers no moss,
rolling stone catches the worm.

327
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:58,653
Truman, what are you doing?

328
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,453
- Truman...
- Where shall we go?

329
00:48:08,788 --> 00:48:13,459
- Truman, where are we going?
- I guess I'm being spontaneous.

330
00:48:13,668 --> 00:48:18,172
Somebody help me!
I'm being spontaneous!

331
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:23,344
Forget Fiji.
We can't drive to Fiji, can we?

332
00:48:24,596 --> 00:48:29,183
- What about Atlantic City?
- No, you hate to gamble.

333
00:48:29,392 --> 00:48:33,563
That's right, I do.
But I never have.

334
00:48:33,771 --> 00:48:36,816
And that's why people go places.

335
00:48:37,025 --> 00:48:41,070
- I think I'm going to throw up.
- Me, too.

336
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:54,542
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully
synchronised, don't you think?

337
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:59,047
- You're blaming me for the traffic?
- Should I?

338
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,723
Truman, let's go home.

339
00:49:08,932 --> 00:49:12,518
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

340
00:49:12,727 --> 00:49:17,565
It'll be like this all the way
to Atlantic City. Let's go back.

341
00:49:17,774 --> 00:49:21,903
I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.

342
00:49:23,863 --> 00:49:28,326
- Can you please slow down?
- Yes, I can.

343
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:33,665
- That's our turn-off.
- I changed my mind.

344
00:49:33,873 --> 00:49:38,211
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardis Gras!

345
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:49,472
Look, Meryl. Same road, no cars.
It's magic.

346
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:54,769
Let me out. If you want to
destroy yourself, do it on your own.

347
00:49:54,978 --> 00:49:59,023
I think I'd like a little company.

348
00:50:03,778 --> 00:50:08,574
Oh, Truman...
You knew this would happen.

349
00:50:08,783 --> 00:50:12,078
You know you can't drive over water.

350
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:16,332
Let's go home,
where you'll feel safe.

351
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:20,920
Give me your hand...
You drive!

352
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:26,926
We shouldn't be doing this.
We're breaking the law!

353
00:50:27,135 --> 00:50:31,681
- Oh, my!
- You can do it! You can make it!

354
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:37,186
We're over! We're over the bridge!

355
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:41,232
- We're over the bridge!
- We're over!

356
00:50:44,694 --> 00:50:46,821
FOREST FIRE WARNING
EXTREME DANGER

357
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:50,867
- What about that sign?
- They exaggerate. We'll be fine.

358
00:50:52,744 --> 00:50:55,622
Do you believe that?

359
00:50:57,957 --> 00:51:01,085
Truman, we're on fire!

360
00:51:01,294 --> 00:51:04,797
- It's just smoke. You okay?
- Yes.

361
00:51:05,006 --> 00:51:08,092
- Wanna do it again?
- No!

362
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:10,929
Truman, stop!

363
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:17,894
What do we do for money
when we get to New Orleans?

364
00:51:18,102 --> 00:51:21,147
I have my Seahaven bank card.

365
00:51:21,356 --> 00:51:25,568
So we're just going to
eat into our savings, is that it?

366
00:51:25,777 --> 00:51:31,115
I'll have to call your mother.
I don't know how she'll take this.

367
00:51:43,711 --> 00:51:45,672
What now?

368
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,383
SEAHAVEN
NUCLEAR POWER STATION

369
00:51:51,803 --> 00:51:55,265
- Looks like a leak at the plant.
- Back up.

370
00:51:55,473 --> 00:52:02,188
Leak at the plant.
The whole area is being evacuated.

371
00:52:02,397 --> 00:52:06,526
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome, Truman.

372
00:52:06,734 --> 00:52:08,569
Truman...

373
00:52:11,155 --> 00:52:14,409
Truman, come back!

374
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,831
Stop him!

375
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:22,417
Truman!

376
00:52:40,393 --> 00:52:42,562
Stay away!

377
00:52:58,077 --> 00:53:03,750
- Thank you both for your help.
- Next time he'll be charged.

378
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:08,713
I understand.
Thanks again. Good night.

379
00:53:26,689 --> 00:53:31,444
Let me get you some help, Truman.
You're not well.

380
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:39,118
Why do you want to have a baby
with me? You can't stand me.

381
00:53:39,327 --> 00:53:42,372
That's not true.

382
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:51,965
I'll fix you some Mococoa. Natural
cocoa beans from Mt. Nicaragua.

383
00:53:52,173 --> 00:53:58,304
- No artificial sweeteners.
- What are you talking about?

384
00:53:58,513 --> 00:54:02,141
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

385
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:06,646
What the hell does this
have to do with anything?

386
00:54:06,854 --> 00:54:11,609
- Tell me what's happening!
- You're having a nervous breakdown.

387
00:54:11,818 --> 00:54:14,696
You're part of this, aren't you?

388
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:21,786
Truman, you are scaring me.

389
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:25,790
No, <i>you're</i> scaring <i>me</i>.
What are you gonna do?

390
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:30,461
Dice me, slice me or peel me?
There's so many choices.

391
00:54:32,255 --> 00:54:35,300
Do something!

392
00:54:35,508 --> 00:54:39,304
What? What did you say?

393
00:54:39,512 --> 00:54:43,266
- Who are you talking to?
- I didn't say anything.

394
00:54:43,474 --> 00:54:48,521
- I wasn't talking to anybody.
- Talk to me!

395
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:53,484
- I don't know anything!
- Stay where you are.

396
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:55,737
Truman...?

397
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:01,618
Thank God!

398
00:55:05,455 --> 00:55:10,543
How can anyone expect me to
carry on under these conditions?

399
00:55:10,752 --> 00:55:13,546
It's unprofessional!

400
00:55:17,425 --> 00:55:21,429
Everything's gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be fine.

401
00:55:25,642 --> 00:55:29,812
I don't know what to think, Marlon.

402
00:55:31,773 --> 00:55:35,818
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

403
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:42,992
It feels like the whole world
revolves around me.

404
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:47,497
That's a lot of world for one man.

405
00:55:48,748 --> 00:55:54,796
Is it wishful thinking? Wishing
you'd made more out of yourself?

406
00:55:55,004 --> 00:56:01,803
Who hasn't sat in the john and
had an imaginary interview on TV?

407
00:56:02,011 --> 00:56:07,558
This is different.
Everybody seems to be in on it.

408
00:56:09,352 --> 00:56:13,481
I've been your best friend
since we were seven.

409
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:19,028
We got through school by cheating
off each other's test papers.

410
00:56:19,237 --> 00:56:23,116
Jesus, they were identical.

411
00:56:23,324 --> 00:56:26,786
But I always felt safe knowing that.

412
00:56:26,995 --> 00:56:32,000
Because whatever the answer was,
we were right or wrong together.

413
00:56:33,626 --> 00:56:39,424
I stayed up all night in your tent
so you could play North Pole.

414
00:56:39,632 --> 00:56:42,802
And I got pneumonia.

415
00:56:43,011 --> 00:56:45,263
Remember that?

416
00:56:45,471 --> 00:56:48,141
You were out of school for a month.

417
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:59,652
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

418
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:10,079
Things haven't worked out for us
like we used to dream they would.

419
00:57:11,873 --> 00:57:16,336
I know what that feeling's like.
Everything slipping away...

420
00:57:16,544 --> 00:57:20,965
You don't want to believe it, so you
look for answers somewhere else.

421
00:57:27,805 --> 00:57:34,270
But the point is, I'd gladly
walk in front of traffic for you.

422
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:44,113
<i>But the point is, I'd gladly</i>
<i>step in front of traffic for you.</i>

423
00:57:44,322 --> 00:57:47,659
And the last thing I'd ever do
is lie to you.

424
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:56,626
And the last thing that
I would ever do... is lie to you.

425
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:03,091
I mean, think about it.

426
00:58:03,299 --> 00:58:08,763
If everybody is in on it...
I'd have to be in on it, too.

427
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:22,777
I'm not in on it, Truman,
because there is no "it".

428
00:58:26,948 --> 00:58:31,244
- You were right about one thing.
- What's that?

429
00:58:33,288 --> 00:58:37,125
The thing that started all this.

430
00:58:50,597 --> 00:58:56,227
I found him for you, Truman.
That's why I came by tonight.

431
00:58:56,436 --> 00:59:00,648
I'm sure he's got
quite a story to tell.

432
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:05,778
Go to him.

433
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,328
Easy on the fog.

434
00:59:14,537 --> 00:59:18,833
Stand by, crane-cam...
Crane-cam.

435
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,593
Button-cam three.

436
00:59:40,897 --> 00:59:43,816
I never stopped believing.

437
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,155
Go wide. Curb-cam eight.

438
00:59:49,364 --> 00:59:52,075
My son.

439
00:59:52,283 --> 00:59:56,162
- Move in for close-up?
- No, no...

440
00:59:57,163 --> 01:00:00,166
Stay back.
Fade up music.

441
01:00:06,422 --> 01:00:09,968
Now go for the close-up.

442
01:00:10,176 --> 01:00:14,514
<i>All those years wasted.</i>
<i>I'll make it up to you, son.</i>

443
01:00:15,515 --> 01:00:17,600
<i>I swear.</i>

444
01:00:23,106 --> 01:00:25,733
<i>Dad...</i>

445
01:00:36,327 --> 01:00:38,329
Bravo!

446
01:00:38,538 --> 01:00:41,541
Congratulations.

447
01:00:41,749 --> 01:00:46,504
- Okay, quiet down. Concentrate.
- That was great television.

448
01:00:52,343 --> 01:00:56,472
- Christof, it was brilliant!
- It broke my heart.

449
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:02,186
Well done! Congratulations!

450
01:01:10,361 --> 01:01:13,531
Truman drinks Mococoa,
world's finest cocoa beans -

451
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,701
- grown on the upper slopes
of Mt. Nicaragua.

452
01:01:20,288 --> 01:01:24,375
<i>1. 7 billion were there</i>
<i>for his birth.</i>

453
01:01:27,462 --> 01:01:30,632
<i>220 countries tuned in</i>
<i>for his first step.</i>

454
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,969
<i>The world stood still</i>
<i>for that stolen kiss.</i>

455
01:01:35,178 --> 01:01:39,349
<i>And as he grew, so did the</i>
<i>technology. A human life,</i> -

456
01:01:39,557 --> 01:01:44,604
- <i>recorded on a network of</i>
<i>hidden cameras and broadcast live</i> -

457
01:01:44,812 --> 01:01:50,193
- <i>24 hours a day, seven days a week,</i>
<i>to an audience around the globe.</i>

458
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:56,491
<i>From Seahaven, enclosed in the</i>
<i>largest studio ever constructed,</i> -

459
01:01:56,699 --> 01:02:02,747
- <i>one of only two man-made</i>
<i>structures visible from space,</i> -

460
01:02:02,956 --> 01:02:08,378
- <i>now in its 30th great year,</i>
<i>it's The Truman Show!</i>

461
01:02:12,423 --> 01:02:16,886
<i>What a week! I was on</i>
<i>pins and needles the entire time.</i>

462
01:02:17,095 --> 01:02:19,931
<i>I'm your host, Mike Michaelson.</i>

463
01:02:20,139 --> 01:02:23,601
<i>Welcome to Tru-Talk, our forum for</i>
<i>issues growing out of the show.</i>

464
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:27,272
<i>Tonight, something very special:</i>

465
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,734
<i>An exclusive interview</i>
<i>with the show's creator.</i>

466
01:02:31,943 --> 01:02:38,741
<i>Let's go live to the 221st floor</i>
<i>of the Omni-Cam Ecosphere.</i>

467
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:42,662
<i>There we'll find</i>
<i>the world's greatest tele-visionary.</i>

468
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:47,917
<i>The designer of the world within</i>
<i>a world that is Seahaven: Christof.</i>

469
01:02:48,126 --> 01:02:53,172
<i>I'd like to thank you</i>
<i>for granting this interview.</i>

470
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:58,845
<i>We know your schedule is demanding,</i>
<i>and how you guard your privacy.</i>

471
01:02:59,053 --> 01:03:03,099
- <i>This, sir, is indeed an honour.</i>
- Don't mention it.

472
01:03:03,308 --> 01:03:06,728
<i>The catalyst</i>
<i>for the recent dramatic events</i> -

473
01:03:07,103 --> 01:03:11,858
- <i>has been Truman's father, Kirk,</i>
<i>and his attempt at infiltration.</i>

474
01:03:12,066 --> 01:03:17,280
<i>This is not the first time someone</i>
<i>has tried to reach Truman, is it?</i>

475
01:03:17,488 --> 01:03:20,783
<i>We have had our close calls.</i>

476
01:03:20,992 --> 01:03:27,665
It's television!
I did it! I'm on The Truman Show!

477
01:03:27,874 --> 01:03:35,298
<i>But now, the first intruder</i>
<i>to be a former cast member.</i>

478
01:03:35,506 --> 01:03:40,637
- <i>A dead one at that.</i>
- <i>Writing Kirk back in, brilliant.</i>

479
01:03:40,845 --> 01:03:46,559
<i>Kirk started this whole crisis. He</i>
<i>was the only one who could end it.</i>

480
01:03:46,768 --> 01:03:49,395
Truman, no!

481
01:03:49,604 --> 01:03:53,274
- That's off limits!
- Why? What's over there?

482
01:03:53,483 --> 01:03:57,946
Nothing. It's dangerous, that's all.
You have to know your limitations.

483
01:03:58,154 --> 01:04:02,325
<i>Let's remind viewers why Dad was</i>
<i>written out in the first place.</i>

484
01:04:02,533 --> 01:04:07,497
<i>As Truman grew up, we manufactured</i>
<i>ways to keep him on the island.</i>

485
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:14,504
- I'd like to be a great explorer.
- There's nothing left to explore.

486
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:24,973
- <i>Then I thought up Kirk's drowning.</i>
- <i>He's feared the water ever since.</i>

487
01:04:25,181 --> 01:04:31,854
<i>When Kirk read the synopsis, he was</i>
<i>disappointed, to say the least.</i>

488
01:04:32,063 --> 01:04:35,316
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>that's why he broke onto the set.</i>

489
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:40,071
<i>But how do you intend to explain</i>
<i>his 22-year absence?</i>

490
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,991
- <i>Amnesia.</i>
- <i>Brilliant.</i>

491
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:49,414
<i>Let's take some viewer calls. North</i>
<i>Carolina, you're on with Christof.</i>

492
01:04:49,622 --> 01:04:54,877
<i>Hi, Christof. I was wondering how</i>
<i>many cameras you got in that town.</i>

493
01:04:55,086 --> 01:04:59,591
<i>Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000.</i>

494
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:03,845
<i>Remember, we started with just one.</i>

495
01:05:04,053 --> 01:05:10,476
<i>He was two weeks premature, as if</i>
<i>he couldn't wait to get started.</i>

496
01:05:10,685 --> 01:05:15,732
<i>And his eagerness to leave the womb</i>
<i>was the reason he was selected.</i>

497
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,819
<i>In competition with five other</i>
<i>unwanted pregnancies</i> -

498
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:25,742
- <i>for a show determined by an air</i>
<i>date, only Truman arrived on cue.</i>

499
01:05:28,703 --> 01:05:33,374
<i>I believe Truman is the first child</i>
<i>to be adopted by a corporation.</i>

500
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:37,629
- <i>That's correct.</i>
- <i>The show's made enormous revenue.</i>

501
01:05:37,837 --> 01:05:41,007
<i>Equivalent to the GNP</i>
<i>of a small country.</i>

502
01:05:41,215 --> 01:05:45,511
<i>It takes the population of an</i>
<i>entire country to keep it running.</i>

503
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:52,644
<i>Since it's on 24 hours, revenues are</i>
<i>generated by product placement.</i>

504
01:05:52,852 --> 01:05:57,857
<i>Everything on the show is for sale,</i>
<i>down to the very homes they live in.</i>

505
01:05:58,066 --> 01:06:02,195
<i>All of it in the Truman catalogue.</i>
<i>Operators are standing by.</i>

506
01:06:02,403 --> 01:06:07,992
<i>Christof, why has Truman</i>
<i>never come close to discovering</i> -

507
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:11,955
- <i>the true nature of his world</i>
<i>until now?</i>

508
01:06:12,163 --> 01:06:16,167
<i>We accept the reality of the world</i>
<i>with which we're presented.</i>

509
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:21,714
<i>The Hague for Christof. Hello.</i>
<i>The Hague...</i>

510
01:06:23,007 --> 01:06:26,594
<i>All right,</i>
<i>let's go to Hollywood, California.</i>

511
01:06:26,803 --> 01:06:32,642
You're a liar and a manipulator, and
what you've done to Truman is sick.

512
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:39,148
<i>Well, we remember this voice,</i>
<i>don't we? How could we forget?</i>

513
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:43,778
- <i>Let's go to another call.</i>
- <i>No, no. It's fine, Mike.</i>

514
01:06:43,987 --> 01:06:48,491
<i>I love to reminisce</i>
<i>with former members of the cast.</i>

515
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:54,706
<i>Sylvia, as you announced so</i>
<i>melodramatically to the world...</i>

516
01:06:54,914 --> 01:06:59,502
<i>Do you think because you batted</i>
<i>your eyes at Truman once,</i> -

517
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:03,965
- <i>flirted with him,</i>
<i>stole a few minutes of air time</i> -

518
01:07:04,173 --> 01:07:08,469
- <i>to thrust your politics into</i>
<i>the limelight, that you know him?</i>

519
01:07:08,678 --> 01:07:13,600
<i>That you know what's right for him?</i>
<i>Are you in a position tojudge him?</i>

520
01:07:13,808 --> 01:07:18,688
What right do you have to
turn a baby's life into a mockery?

521
01:07:18,896 --> 01:07:22,942
Don't you ever feel guilty?

522
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:28,156
<i>I have given Truman</i>
<i>the chance to lead a normal life.</i>

523
01:07:28,364 --> 01:07:32,327
<i>The world, the place you live in,</i> -

524
01:07:32,535 --> 01:07:37,957
- <i>is the sick place. Seahaven</i>
<i>is the way the world should be.</i>

525
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:43,379
- He's a prisoner, not a performer.
- <i>He can leave at any time.</i>

526
01:07:43,588 --> 01:07:48,718
<i>If his was more than a vague</i>
<i>ambition, if he was determined</i> -

527
01:07:48,927 --> 01:07:54,891
- <i>to discover the truth, there's</i>
<i>no way we could prevent him.</i>

528
01:07:55,099 --> 01:07:59,562
<i>I think what distresses you,</i>
<i>really, caller,</i> -

529
01:07:59,771 --> 01:08:05,652
- <i>is that, ultimately, Truman</i>
<i>prefers his cell, as you call it.</i>

530
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:11,157
That's where you're so wrong.
And he'll prove you wrong.

531
01:08:11,366 --> 01:08:17,789
<i>These heated comments aside, it's</i>
<i>been a very positive experience.</i>

532
01:08:17,997 --> 01:08:21,918
<i>For Truman and for the viewers.</i>

533
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:28,466
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>
<i>Now that this crisis is behind us,</i> -

534
01:08:28,675 --> 01:08:32,971
- <i>can we look forward</i>
<i>to some exciting new developments?</i>

535
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:38,768
<i>The big news is: Meryl will leave</i>
<i>Truman in an upcoming episode.</i>

536
01:08:38,977 --> 01:08:42,105
<i>A new romantic interest</i>
<i>will be introduced.</i>

537
01:08:42,313 --> 01:08:46,859
<i>I'm determined that TV's first</i>
<i>on-air conception will take place.</i>

538
01:08:47,068 --> 01:08:50,113
<i>Another television milestone.</i>

539
01:08:50,321 --> 01:08:56,869
<i>It has been a singular honour</i>
<i>and a pleasure. Christof, thank you.</i>

540
01:10:14,864 --> 01:10:17,367
Hey, Simeon.

541
01:10:21,037 --> 01:10:26,084
- Is he looking at us?
- You think he knows?

542
01:10:26,292 --> 01:10:29,837
- <i>Hello...</i>
- Better call Christof.

543
01:10:30,046 --> 01:10:32,966
<i>Come in, Major Burbank.</i>

544
01:10:49,107 --> 01:10:52,944
He's back to his old self.

545
01:10:59,993 --> 01:11:03,746
That's an unusual cat, my man.

546
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:11,296
<i>I hereby proclaim this planet...</i>

547
01:11:14,924 --> 01:11:18,428
<i>... Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.</i>

548
01:11:20,054 --> 01:11:24,183
- Is he gonna go?
- Hallway camera ready.

549
01:11:24,392 --> 01:11:30,064
- <i>That one's for free.</i>
- Stand by, all house cameras.

550
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:34,736
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

551
01:11:34,944 --> 01:11:39,824
- In case I don't see you...
...good afternoon and good night.

552
01:11:41,743 --> 01:11:46,915
Good afternoon, good night...

553
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:53,630
- Morning, Truman. How's it going?
- I'll check. Vital signs are good.

554
01:11:55,673 --> 01:11:58,134
Hey, Pluto!

555
01:11:58,343 --> 01:12:01,596
- Good morning!
- Look who's here.

556
01:12:01,804 --> 01:12:06,809
Beautiful day, isn't it? We thought
about the policy, and we'll take it.

557
01:12:07,018 --> 01:12:11,397
Great! Let's go up to my office
and sign the papers.

558
01:12:11,606 --> 01:12:16,194
- Next week would be better.
- I knew it. See you guys.

559
01:12:16,402 --> 01:12:20,239
- See you next week.
- Looking forward to it!

560
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:24,702
This isn't about insurance.
This is about the great variable.

561
01:12:24,911 --> 01:12:30,291
When will death occur?
Could be a week, a month, a year...

562
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,294
Could be today.

563
01:12:33,503 --> 01:12:39,509
Innocent sunbather, stabbed by
the tip of a runaway beach umbrella.

564
01:12:39,717 --> 01:12:42,971
No way to guard against that.

565
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:48,226
- Excuse me.
- Truman, this is Vivian.

566
01:12:48,434 --> 01:12:51,938
The two of you
are going to be neighbours.

567
01:12:54,899 --> 01:13:00,446
I guess what I'm saying
is that life is... fragile.

568
01:13:02,156 --> 01:13:05,285
- Vivian, your office.
- Sorry.

569
01:13:05,493 --> 01:13:09,497
I'm sorry... You do?

570
01:13:09,706 --> 01:13:14,210
Oh, great.
Let me take your information.

571
01:13:29,475 --> 01:13:32,437
Ready, two. Go to two.

572
01:13:35,565 --> 01:13:40,612
Back to medium... and wide.

573
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:53,333
I was just trying
to train the kid to... never mind.

574
01:13:56,544 --> 01:14:01,549
- What's he doing in the basement?
- He moved in there when Meryl left.

575
01:14:01,758 --> 01:14:06,888
Why wasn't I told? Unpredictable
behaviour has to be reported.

576
01:14:07,096 --> 01:14:12,018
- He's just sleeping. I thought...
- This is the best shot we've got?

577
01:14:12,226 --> 01:14:16,064
- What's on the clock-cam?
- Obstruction.

578
01:14:16,272 --> 01:14:20,944
- What happened?
- He was tidying up his garbage.

579
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:25,365
I was gonna call you,
but he gave up and fell asleep.

580
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:30,870
- I want to check the set-ups...
...for the insurance convention.

581
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:33,665
Nice move.

582
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:43,841
There you go.

583
01:14:53,184 --> 01:14:57,647
Isolate the audio.
Give me a close-up on his torso.

584
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:03,486
Still breathing.

585
01:15:04,487 --> 01:15:09,742
Where's Chloe? Call him.
Tell him it's a wrong number.

586
01:15:13,204 --> 01:15:17,417
- What took you so long?
- I had to wait for it.

587
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:23,715
- They were busy. What's going on?
- I don't know.

588
01:15:23,923 --> 01:15:28,845
- He did nothing but stand around.
- Shut up and watch.

589
01:15:29,053 --> 01:15:32,932
Then we went to night vision.
He's asleep.

590
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:39,564
There! Stop it.
Zoom in under the chair.

591
01:15:42,775 --> 01:15:48,531
- Enhance it.
- Is it...? My God...

592
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:55,788
- He didn't go up the stairs.
- Get Marlon over there!

593
01:16:11,346 --> 01:16:15,433
Truman... Surprise party!

594
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:21,522
I got a six-pack of cold brewskies
with our name on them.

595
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:25,276
Come on, pal.
Come on, buddy.

596
01:16:27,904 --> 01:16:30,198
Shit!

597
01:16:31,741 --> 01:16:36,037
Marlon, find him.
He's still in the room.

598
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,877
- <i>Come out, wherever you are.</i>
- Good. Keep it light.

599
01:16:43,086 --> 01:16:45,421
<i>I know you're in here.</i>

600
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:55,390
Check under the table.
The closet, behind you.

601
01:17:01,187 --> 01:17:05,483
Gee, I wonder where
he could possibly be.

602
01:17:13,408 --> 01:17:15,827
Lawn-cam!

603
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:26,838
- Say something. Keep it going.
- <i>He's gone.</i>

604
01:17:27,046 --> 01:17:30,258
- Cut transmission!
- Cut transmission?

605
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:38,891
- God in heaven!
- Give me the phone!

606
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,568
TECHNICAL FAULT
PLEASE STAND BY

607
01:18:00,872 --> 01:18:07,170
We've got every available extra
looking for him. The crew, too.

608
01:18:07,378 --> 01:18:11,132
- What about prop cars?
- Accounted for.

609
01:18:11,341 --> 01:18:15,678
He has the world's most recognisable
face, he can't disappear.

610
01:18:55,093 --> 01:18:58,471
Go find him, Pluto. Good dog.

611
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,351
All this fuss!
If he could just hear my voice.

612
01:19:03,559 --> 01:19:07,772
Truman! Truman!

613
01:19:07,981 --> 01:19:11,859
Let me try.
Truman!

614
01:19:12,068 --> 01:19:17,282
It's me, Dad!
Let's talk!

615
01:19:19,284 --> 01:19:23,705
Yeah, I know. We're just about
done with the square.

616
01:19:23,913 --> 01:19:28,167
<i>We've got to go back to Barrymore,</i>
<i>check the interiors.</i>

617
01:19:28,376 --> 01:19:34,507
Who's watching the college?
Send someone over there.

618
01:19:39,762 --> 01:19:43,933
- Take another man, get down there.
- Find the son of a bitch!

619
01:19:44,142 --> 01:19:47,812
Get some batteries.
He's not gonna glow in the dark.

620
01:19:50,773 --> 01:19:55,153
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.

621
01:19:59,574 --> 01:20:04,037
- What time is it?
- It's way too early for that.

622
01:20:10,043 --> 01:20:13,630
Cue the sun.

623
01:20:17,842 --> 01:20:20,303
What time is it?

624
01:20:20,511 --> 01:20:26,184
Christof, what's going on?
There's rumours that he's dead.

625
01:20:26,392 --> 01:20:29,020
The media's having a feeding frenzy.

626
01:20:29,228 --> 01:20:34,984
Every network has a pirated shot
of Marlon making an ass of himself.

627
01:20:35,193 --> 01:20:40,615
- The sponsors are threatening us.
- We're getting our highest ratings.

628
01:20:44,744 --> 01:20:48,998
- <i>No sign of him.</i>
- Go back to town, join the others.

629
01:20:49,207 --> 01:20:55,296
Everyone else at first positions.
Everyone <i>is</i> at first positions?

630
01:21:12,814 --> 01:21:16,150
He's got to be there somewhere.

631
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:22,365
- We're not watching the sea.
- Why would we watch the sea?

632
01:21:22,573 --> 01:21:27,579
- Sweep the harbour.
- Bring up the harbour cameras.

633
01:21:27,787 --> 01:21:32,750
- Aren't some of those out?
- Yeah, but we have the lighthouse.

634
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:36,796
All buoy-cams, please.

635
01:21:37,005 --> 01:21:41,092
- Long lens, short-base cameras.
- Why are we looking at the water?

636
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:50,602
Truman, where are you going?

637
01:21:52,812 --> 01:21:58,484
- Sailing? He's afraid of the water.
- Resume transmission.

638
01:22:04,198 --> 01:22:07,452
I got 2-1 he doesn't make it.

639
01:22:11,831 --> 01:22:15,043
Just leave them in the car.

640
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:30,808
Get off this mast-cam. You can't
see his face. Go to the cabin-cam.

641
01:22:33,478 --> 01:22:36,898
Perfect.
That's our hero shot.

642
01:23:03,049 --> 01:23:08,179
- Let's get another boat out there.
- I need to talk to the ferry guys.

643
01:23:08,388 --> 01:23:11,975
Come on, get it moving!

644
01:23:14,769 --> 01:23:19,691
- I'm just the bus driver.
- They can't sail. They're actors!

645
01:23:24,153 --> 01:23:27,073
How do we stop him?

646
01:23:36,457 --> 01:23:43,715
Okay... We're going to access
the weather programme now.

647
01:23:43,923 --> 01:23:48,219
So hold on to your hats.
You got that?

648
01:23:48,428 --> 01:23:52,932
No, I think we'll want to
localise the storm over the boat.

649
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:57,854
Get the co-ordinates.

650
01:23:58,062 --> 01:24:03,818
- There's no rescue boat.
- He'll turn back. He'll be afraid.

651
01:24:05,778 --> 01:24:07,905
There she blows.

652
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,128
Come on.

653
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:47,028
Give me some lightning.

654
01:24:47,236 --> 01:24:49,614
Hit him again!

655
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:08,299
- He can't die on television!
- He was born on television.

656
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:44,711
Hold on!

657
01:26:09,944 --> 01:26:13,197
Is that the best you can do?

658
01:26:13,406 --> 01:26:16,451
You're gonna have to kill me!

659
01:26:17,619 --> 01:26:20,413
<i>What should we do</i>
<i>with a drunken sailor...</i>

660
01:26:20,622 --> 01:26:26,794
- I demand you cease transmission.
- Keep running.

661
01:26:27,003 --> 01:26:29,839
Increase the wind!

662
01:26:32,842 --> 01:26:37,180
- For the last time...
- Capsize him, tip him over.

663
01:26:37,388 --> 01:26:41,935
- He's tied himself to the boat!
- He'll drown, and he doesn't care.

664
01:26:42,143 --> 01:26:44,729
Do it... Do it!

665
01:27:38,408 --> 01:27:40,827
That's enough.

666
01:31:52,579 --> 01:31:54,289
I want to talk to him.

667
01:31:58,167 --> 01:32:00,378
EXIT

668
01:32:11,973 --> 01:32:16,060
Truman... You can speak.

669
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:21,524
<i>I can hear you.</i>

670
01:32:24,193 --> 01:32:27,989
- Who are you?
- I'm the creator of a TV show.

671
01:32:28,197 --> 01:32:31,576
It gives hope
and inspiration to millions.

672
01:32:35,872 --> 01:32:39,667
- <i>Then who am I?</i>
- You're the star.

673
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:49,677
- <i>Was nothing real?</i>
- You were real.

674
01:32:49,886 --> 01:32:54,140
That's what made you so good
to watch. Listen, Truman.

675
01:32:54,349 --> 01:33:00,313
There's no more truth out there
than in the world I created for you.

676
01:33:02,231 --> 01:33:07,237
<i>The same lies, the same deceit.</i>

677
01:33:07,445 --> 01:33:13,576
But in my world,
you have nothing to fear.

678
01:33:16,412 --> 01:33:21,417
- <i>I know you better than you do.</i>
- You never had a camera in my head.

679
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:27,340
You're afraid.
That's why you can't leave.

680
01:33:31,844 --> 01:33:35,682
It's okay, Truman.
I understand.

681
01:33:37,267 --> 01:33:42,438
I have been watching you
your whole life.

682
01:33:42,647 --> 01:33:46,609
I was watching when you were born.

683
01:33:46,818 --> 01:33:50,572
I was watching
when you took your first step.

684
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:59,163
<i>I watched you</i>
<i>on your first day of school.</i>

685
01:33:59,372 --> 01:34:03,793
The episode
when you lost your first tooth.

686
01:34:06,379 --> 01:34:09,090
You can't leave, Truman.

687
01:34:09,299 --> 01:34:12,510
- Please, God.
- <i>You belong here.</i>

688
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,846
You can do it.

689
01:34:15,805 --> 01:34:17,890
With me.

690
01:34:19,809 --> 01:34:23,730
Talk to me.
Say something.

691
01:34:28,067 --> 01:34:34,407
Say something, damn it! You're
on TV. You're live to the world!

692
01:34:51,299 --> 01:34:56,930
In case I don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

693
01:35:35,176 --> 01:35:38,638
He made it!
All right, Truman!

694
01:35:48,481 --> 01:35:50,566
Cease transmission.

695
01:35:55,363 --> 01:35:59,534
- You want another slice?
- No. Let's see what else is on.

696
01:42:41,102 --> 01:42:46,608
