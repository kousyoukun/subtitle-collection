00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:28,555
Tales of monstrous, man-eating anacondas -

2
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:32,893
- have been told for centuries by Amazon tribes.

3
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:36,649
Some are said to worship giant snakes.

4
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,569
Anacondas are ferocious, and enormous.

5
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,860
They can grow up to 40 feet long.

6
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:47,570
They do not merely eat their prey.

7
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:51,246
They regurgitate it in order to kill and eat again.

8
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:37,342
Please, help! Somebody, help!

9
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:44,391
This is an emergency. Somebody, please!

10
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:15,841
Please ...

11
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:40,459
ARlAU JUNGLE HOTEL, BRAZlL DEEP lN THE AMAZON

12
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:21,513
- Miss Flores. - Professor. When did you get in?

13
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:27,192
A couple of days ago. l've been out asking about our tribe.

14
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,528
- Any luck? - The evidence is they're out there.

15
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,910
And can be found ... or so l told the grant people!

16
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:43,534
My guide thinks they're here. He found one of their markers.

17
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:48,204
- That's good! - l think we have a chance.

18
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:53,088
- Get me there, and l'll shoot it. - That's why I hired you.

19
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:58,501
- l appreciate the work. - l wanted the best director.

20
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:02,180
l think we'll make a good team.

21
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:05,470
You're a mess. What happened?

22
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:10,984
Just a small piranha attack. l barely escaped with my life.

23
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:34,961
- Somebody's up awfully early. - Well, today's a good day.

24
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:40,552
Not every day my home girl gets to direct a documentary.

25
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,346
- You ready? - l think so.

26
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:50,425
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

27
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,601
ls this a pleasure cruise?

28
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:59,935
You know me. l don't mix business with pleasure.

29
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:03,564
lf we go up through here ..?

30
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:10,159
This way better. lf not, l cannot be responsible.

31
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:16,416
Well, it's only 55 kilometers more. Better safe than sorry.

32
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:21,048
- Mateo, you understand me? - Sure.

33
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:27,337
- l need some shots over there. - As you say, cheffe .

34
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:34,928
- Where's Westridge? He checked in. - Probably getting his beauty sleep.

35
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:36,812
Careful!

36
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:42,272
Careful! Bordeaux! Fragile. Expensive wine.

37
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:47,984
- Christ! Good morning. - Morning. How was your flight?

38
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:53,401
Actually, it was a bloody nightmare. Ongoing, l think.

39
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,538
- One zoom lens ... - You! Stow this in my room.

40
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,838
l'm the production manager.

41
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:08,426
- Then manage them into my room! - One pompous ass ...

42
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:13,256
ln some cultures, asking you to carry bags shows respect.

43
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:16,349
Respect this!

44
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:20,053
Terri Flores.

45
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,856
l've seen some of your films. They were ... promising.

46
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:30,103
- lt's hot! Are we on the equator? - Welcome aboard ... l guess.

47
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:34,528
- He likes you! - You felt that too?

48
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:37,371
lt's Jacques Cousteau!

49
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:44,952
- joinez-moi avec mon équipe ... - Whatever the hell that means ...

50
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:47,916
Ready for Rio Negro!

51
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:54,634
Everybody! Check your gear and pray you remembered bug spray.

52
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:19,198
Our adventure begins 1,000 miles from the mouth of the Amazon.

53
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:24,529
From here, we travel unexplored backwaters -

54
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:29,416
- in search of the Mist People, the Shirishama.

55
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:33,798
On of the last mysteries of the Rain Forest.

56
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:54,608
ls it just me, or does the jungle make you horny?

57
00:09:56,445 --> 00:10:01,985
- l think it's the jungle. - l've got one thing on my mind.

58
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,030
Can l work, please?

59
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,512
Help!

60
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:29,301
Save me! l'm stranded.

61
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:34,304
My boat is stranded in the ropes. Help me!

62
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,229
There's a dude on a boat over there.

63
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:46,237
Pull over to his boat!

64
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:53,236
We'll bring you on board.

65
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,834
Thank the Lord for you!

66
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:11,094
- Are you okay? - The roots tore off my propeller.

67
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:15,394
We can't take you back to Manaus.

68
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:20,982
At the next village, l know the people. They will help me.

69
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:26,025
- l apologize for the trouble. - There's no need.

70
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:31,701
We're all at the mercy of machines. Yours broke.

71
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:36,205
Mateo, vamonos.

72
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:03,228
- Fish, river style! - Not bad!

73
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:06,980
We should get that on film.

74
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,692
- Ever work in a sushi bar, Mr ..? - Paul Sarone.

75
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:21,110
- Where are you from, Mr. Sarone? - Paraguay.

76
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,077
l studied to be a priest.

77
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:28,628
But then l needed to see the real world.

78
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:33,791
So l ended up in the jungle. l seem to fit.

79
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:37,835
What does a failed priest do here?

80
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:43,434
Who says l failed? l didn't fail.

81
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:47,434
So what is your calling now?

82
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:52,604
Snakes. l catch them.

83
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:56,905
- For zoos and collectors. - Poaching?

84
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:03,405
Poaching is illegal. What are you hunting?

85
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:06,331
We're not hunting anything.

86
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:12,418
We're making a documentary on the Shirishama lndians.

87
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:16,253
- The People of the Mist? - You know of them?

88
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:21,667
- l've seen them. - Could you show me where?

89
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:28,893
You saved my life. l can show you exactly where l saw them.

90
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:36,190
So slurs every river rat after five whiskies in any Manaus bar.

91
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,152
Five whiskies? That's breakfast on the river.

92
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:48,488
Does salad go well with fish river style?

93
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:52,957
Salad would be perfect, little baby bird.

94
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,975
Look at that.

95
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,612
Are they fireflies?

96
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:31,740
Pretty, huh? Family Lampyridae.

97
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:38,661
They use their night flashes to announce that they're ready to mate.

98
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:45,549
- Who flashes? Males or females? - Both, actually.

99
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:51,553
The females with short, dainty, feminine flashes, -

100
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:57,677
- and the males with long, drawn-out, manly flashes.

101
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:05,270
l like that. No pick-up lines, no misunderstandings.

102
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:09,572
Just instinct and nature.

103
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,946
l've missed you.

104
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Bloody racket!

105
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:32,395
Hey! Don't touch my radio!

106
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:46,111
l could cheerfully hire someone to kill you.

107
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:51,531
- 15 dollars should cover it. - l could just kill you for free.

108
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:58,332
- You and whose army? - Your mama's!

109
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:03,176
Are we getting close?

110
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:07,557
- Just around this bend. - Perfect.

111
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:31,955
A snake totem pole.

112
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:36,664
lt's the Shirishama's.

113
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:42,672
They worship giant snakes. Anacondas. As gods and protectors.

114
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:47,088
They have a legend of a journey to a sacred lake.

115
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:50,678
First you pass a waterfall with warrior snakes.

116
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:55,843
Then you travel through the land of the Shirishama, -

117
00:17:56,021 --> 00:18:00,931
- until you come to a wall so high, it blots out the sky ...

118
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:07,396
Then after five days, you reach the head of a giant anaconda.

119
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:13,277
- You know the story. - A beautiful legend ...

120
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:16,538
... of the Maku.

121
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:20,834
- Also the Shirishama. - Not to my knowledge.

122
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:26,542
Their village was right here. They're down this fork.

123
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:32,801
- l know. l trap snakes. - And l'm sure you're good at it.

124
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:37,266
l locate tribes. l'm very good at that.

125
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:42,262
The water is high, so this side is flooded.

126
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:47,646
So our tribe would seek higher ground over here.

127
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,445
- Which way? - This way.

128
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:59,410
l want a shot of you with the totem. Gary, roll sound.

129
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,282
Camera rolling.

130
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:08,044
Our first piece of luck: a Shirishama idol.

131
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:13,005
l know what l know. Leave me at the next village.

132
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,880
With pleasure.

133
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:21,302
What the hell was that all about?

134
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:49,623
- We'll go get some wild sound. - Just be careful.

135
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:53,626
See you guys.

136
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,974
Gary ...

137
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:38,330
lt's unbelievable.

138
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:44,465
- Gary ... - What?

139
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:53,348
Oh my God!

140
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,910
Wait.

141
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,333
Do you hear that?

142
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,996
The silence.

143
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:51,276
- What was that? - l don't know.

144
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,988
Mateo, shine the light over there.

145
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,210
These two are fortunate to be alive.

146
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:17,221
- What happened? - You should have seen it!

147
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:21,934
He just blasted this thing coming right at us.

148
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:30,067
Wild boar. Gores with his tusks. Goes for the eyes.

149
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:34,448
- Denise, are you okay? - Yeah, thanks.

150
00:22:34,615 --> 00:22:40,867
- Everybody stays on board at night. - That's a smart idea.

151
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:48,955
Mateo, let's cut him up. Food for a week.

152
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:53,877
Food?

153
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:21,403
- My turn? - lt's my turn.

154
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:37,256
Mateo, do you have control of this vessel?

155
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:41,007
Lie, if you must.

156
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:46,546
The rope's caught in the propeller.

157
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:56,265
l'll cut us loose.

158
00:23:56,442 --> 00:24:00,771
Let me. This river can kill you 1,000 ways.

159
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:07,399
l can handle it. The only thing l'm afraid of is the candiru acu .

160
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:13,865
lt's a tiny little catfish. lt swims up into your urethra, -

161
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:19,914
- spreads its little spines and refuses to budge.

162
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:26,678
- You have to cut it out. - That's it! l'm going back to L.A.

163
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,166
Terri, something's wrong!

164
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:46,086
Cale?

165
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:51,049
- He's hurt. l'm going. - Hold up!

166
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,755
Hurry up!

167
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:04,594
ls he breathing? Faster, come on!

168
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,856
Hurry!

169
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,980
What is it?

170
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:17,821
Careful.

171
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:23,994
- Get something for his head. - He's not breathing.

172
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:27,750
ln his mouth.

173
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:33,374
- Oh my God! - Damn! What's that?

174
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:39,125
A wasp. Deadly. Poisonous.

175
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:44,552
He's not breathing. What do we do?

176
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:50,056
- How did this happen? - Alcohol.

177
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:53,939
l've got whiskey in my flask.

178
00:26:56,987 --> 00:27:00,936
- Quickly. - What's that for?

179
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:16,920
- He's breathing! - That's it. He'll be all right.

180
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:43,526
- He seems okay, we should go now. - The radio don't work.

181
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:47,445
- l can't fix, okay? - We can start now.

182
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:50,867
No ... fog.

183
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:56,079
We must get him to hospital soon, or he'll die.

184
00:27:56,251 --> 00:28:00,793
What? Terri, we got lights.

185
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:06,254
Good. Mateo, we'll just double back.

186
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:10,887
Fighting the current, lose two days.

187
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:16,596
Cut back to this tributary, save us fifty miles.

188
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:24,603
- The route you suggested yesterday. - For a different reason.

189
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:29,984
Now, it's to get Professor Cale to hospital as fast as possible.

190
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:38,452
l hope you know what you're doing. l don't know about this dude.

191
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:41,375
What choice do l have?

192
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:34,588
What the hell is this? Terri, come here.

193
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:46,678
- This is the river you know? - No, this is new.

194
00:29:47,814 --> 00:29:51,728
But no cause for panic.

195
00:29:54,528 --> 00:30:00,282
l'm not panicking. l'm just looking at this wall blocking our way.

196
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,159
- Let's see what we can do. - Dynamite?

197
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,197
lt's always good to be prepared.

198
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:16,173
- But it must be there for a reason. - Yeah, to keep us out.

199
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,801
We could upset the ecological balance of the river.

200
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,718
l can blow it in ten minutes, -

201
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:29,718
- or we can turn around and lose two days.

202
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:35,644
Terri?

203
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:40,612
For God's sake, blow the bloody thing!

204
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:46,153
Just give me ten minutes, people.

205
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:51,404
l need help. Gary, get the little boat.

206
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:41,037
- There's something down there. - Yes.

207
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:44,912
- l mean it. - l mean it too.

208
00:31:49,094 --> 00:31:52,510
Hurry.

209
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:29,789
Damn it! Snakes!

210
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:37,422
- Babies! - How do we get them off the boat?

211
00:32:37,598 --> 00:32:41,548
Come on, back to Mama.

212
00:32:45,314 --> 00:32:48,184
They're not all babies.

213
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,570
Calm.

214
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:58,696
- You little shit! - Sarone, help him.

215
00:32:58,868 --> 00:33:03,613
Someone get this bloody thing off my hand!

216
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:11,704
- So young, and so lethal. - Get it off me!

217
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,215
Later, Sweetie!

218
00:33:19,387 --> 00:33:25,176
- You knew there were snakes here! - lt was a pleasant surprise.

219
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:30,392
- What about the fuel? - There's only enough for 100 km.

220
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:34,941
About a day's ride. That will have to do.

221
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,897
Back to your mother.

222
00:33:54,670 --> 00:34:00,542
- How's he doing? - He's breathing normally now.

223
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:07,301
- We'll get him home. - l just don't know what's going on.

224
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:13,801
He's supposed to get us to hospital.

225
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,894
But he acts like he owns this river.

226
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:24,152
And we run into a barrier full of snakes. Where's he taking us?

227
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:57,634
Mateo. Stop the boat.

228
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:06,440
Why are we stopping now?

229
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:09,946
There'll be fuel.

230
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:17,696
- You know that boat? - There's lots of boats like that.

231
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:34,420
l get the impression there's nobody home.

232
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:38,725
Mateo, come with me.

233
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:41,639
Hold up.

234
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:46,688
- l'lI get this on film. - You don't need sound, do you?

235
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:03,340
Go aft.

236
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:51,350
- Kind of spooky. - You think so?

237
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:04,020
What the ...

238
00:38:43,692 --> 00:38:47,310
- Help me. - What's that?

239
00:38:47,487 --> 00:38:50,357
Treasures.

240
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:01,452
Here.

241
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:07,706
Careful, my camera's in here.

242
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:21,224
Mateo, let's go!

243
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:26,015
l'm coming.

244
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:03,556
- What about the fuel? - There wasn't any.

245
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:08,636
- Where's Mateo? - He was right behind us.

246
00:40:10,606 --> 00:40:13,441
Mateo!

247
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:23,861
- l'm going back. - Sarone, go with him.

248
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:29,741
- Maybe some other time. - Asshole.

249
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:38,833
Now we've lost our driver!

250
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:44,125
Mateo!

251
00:40:47,975 --> 00:40:51,094
Come on man, stop playing!

252
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:20,629
Danny?

253
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:36,469
- Yeah. - You okay?

254
00:41:36,646 --> 00:41:42,066
- l'm all right. l didn't see him. - How very reassuring!

255
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:47,487
- This is it. - This is all you found?

256
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:55,702
- What the hell is this? - Anaconda skin.

257
00:41:55,872 --> 00:41:59,454
- This big? - It's maybe four years old.

258
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:06,873
lt's grown by now. Something like this made a meal of our captain.

259
00:42:08,551 --> 00:42:13,545
- Snakes don't eat people. - They don't?

260
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:20,180
Anacondas are killing machines. They have heat sensors.

261
00:42:20,353 --> 00:42:25,478
A warm body like Mateo's wasn't hard to find.

262
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:31,071
They wrap around you. Hold you tighter than your lover.

263
00:42:31,238 --> 00:42:37,691
You get to hear your bones break before your veins explode.

264
00:42:39,663 --> 00:42:44,823
- Mateo's probably just lost. - Oh, wake up!

265
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:51,585
lmagine capturing it alive. That's worth a lot of money, Gary.

266
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:59,844
Please people, don't make me out to be a monster. l didn't eat Mateo.

267
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:06,352
Come on, everybody ... We are not sure that Mateo is dead.

268
00:43:06,522 --> 00:43:10,104
- We'll wait here till morning. - Are you insane?

269
00:43:10,275 --> 00:43:15,731
You think he went for a walk? We've got to get out of here.

270
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:20,947
Get a grip! lf it was you, you'd want us to stay.

271
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,326
Listen! lf it was me out there, l'd be dead.

272
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:34,542
- Go to your cabin, lock the door. - Like a bad boy. All right.

273
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:38,214
Where are my shoes?

274
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:44,387
- We'll aim some lights at the boat. - That's a good idea.

275
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,414
l'm not so sure he didn't eat the captain.

276
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:15,201
He sure looks satiated.

277
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:22,629
You think he's still alive?

278
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:26,253
No. Let's go to bed.

279
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:31,256
Danger ...

280
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:35,386
Danger is exciting, huh, Gary?

281
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:38,570
You go on to bed, then i'll catch up to you

282
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:41,698
l'll just talk to him a second.then i'll catch up to you

283
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:47,386
- Hurry up, l'm scared. - l'll be right there.

284
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:59,907
- So ... lt's out there, isn't it? - Yeah.

285
00:45:00,076 --> 00:45:04,323
- And you know how to catch it? - That's right.

286
00:45:04,497 --> 00:45:09,835
But you can't catch it by yourself, you need a partner.

287
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:15,957
Capture alive ... Maybe a million dollars, Gary.

288
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:30,056
REPTlLE TRANQUlLLlZER

289
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:56,244
Still no Mateo.

290
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:42,954
Keep it steady, Westridge!

291
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,012
- What the fuck are you doing? - Anaconda bait.

292
00:46:58,187 --> 00:47:01,223
Oh my God!

293
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:10,941
- Let's go. - Stop! Not on my boat.

294
00:47:11,116 --> 00:47:17,652
You speak for everybody? Gary? Does she speak for everybody?

295
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:23,246
Gary?

296
00:47:23,419 --> 00:47:29,291
With Cale sick, the movie's off. Why not salvage something?

297
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:35,506
Let's film Sarone capturing a big snake.

298
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:41,137
- Have you lost your mind? - No, l'm completely lucid.

299
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,680
lt's you who need to open your eyes.

300
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:50,098
We were taking Cale to hospital, now we're catching a snake?

301
00:47:50,278 --> 00:47:55,485
You're in the middle of the jungle! You question and criticize, -

302
00:47:55,658 --> 00:48:00,782
- but you don't know shit about all this. Neither do l.

303
00:48:00,954 --> 00:48:06,708
But l know who does. This guy! Paul has been here.

304
00:48:06,877 --> 00:48:11,871
lf we help him catch the snake, he'll get us out.

305
00:48:12,048 --> 00:48:15,499
And that is common freaking sense.

306
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:21,596
Come on, Gary, this isn't you! What did he do to you?

307
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:24,636
Think of the money.

308
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:31,144
lmagine filming something like this for the first time ever.

309
00:48:32,526 --> 00:48:36,475
- What else can we do? - l know what l'm doing.

310
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:40,355
l'm gonna throw you two in the river!

311
00:48:44,203 --> 00:48:49,624
- l don't think so. - I didn't want this to happen.

312
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:52,164
Let's go, Westridge.

313
00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:59,915
Occupy yourselves. Play cards.

314
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:26,542
Nobody move!

315
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:07,869
Gary, turn on the lights!

316
00:51:08,047 --> 00:51:11,462
Stop the boat.

317
00:51:14,845 --> 00:51:17,632
Buenas noches!

318
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:21,388
- Come here, Westridge. - You'll get us killed!

319
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:27,893
That's it, go for the eyes! Blind it!

320
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:31,683
Fishing for snakes! He's crazy!

321
00:51:31,861 --> 00:51:36,107
- Just let it go. - Westridge, come here!

322
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:07,932
Where is it?

323
00:52:29,164 --> 00:52:33,114
Don't move. l'll tranquillize it.

324
00:52:52,979 --> 00:52:55,896
Denise, get up here!

325
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:04,311
Gary, help me!

326
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:07,858
- Get up here! - Grab her, man!

327
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:14,615
lt's in the water.

328
00:53:29,638 --> 00:53:32,804
Gary, give me your hand.

329
00:53:39,063 --> 00:53:42,978
lt's no good to me dead.

330
00:53:46,362 --> 00:53:48,354
Gary!

331
00:53:50,115 --> 00:53:52,902
Oh God!

332
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:35,981
May the souls of the faithful departed ...

333
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,488
... through the mercy of God rest in peace.

334
00:54:41,872 --> 00:54:46,499
- Westridge! - How dare you!

335
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:51,876
lt was you who brought that snake. You brought the devil.

336
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,384
There's a devil inside everyone.

337
00:54:56,553 --> 00:54:59,589
Horrible ...

338
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:03,382
Westridge.

339
00:55:08,648 --> 00:55:12,230
Take my gear up to the pilot house.

340
00:55:12,401 --> 00:55:16,351
- l'm not your bloody poodle. - What?

341
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:22,200
- You presume to order me about? - Presume?

342
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:26,829
How you like l presume to throw you in the river?

343
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:31,826
- Take it upstairs. - Thank you.

344
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:39,045
Everyone else, don't move.

345
00:55:39,218 --> 00:55:42,337
Get back.

346
00:55:57,902 --> 00:56:01,520
Terri, let's talk.

347
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:30,107
You want something?

348
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:35,774
l just want to talk to you.

349
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:46,586
I was thinking about the myth.

350
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:53,337
You know, this film was supposed to be my big break.

351
00:57:55,888 --> 00:58:00,051
And it's turned out to be a big disaster.

352
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:08,850
So l was just thinking -

353
00:58:09,025 --> 00:58:15,277
- that maybe l could film you capturing the snake.

354
00:58:19,035 --> 00:58:24,788
And then it wouldn't have all been for nothing.

355
00:58:24,957 --> 00:58:29,085
lt could be dangerous.

356
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:33,001
l know.

357
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:39,801
But you'd be there to protect us.

358
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:44,716
You need protection?

359
00:58:47,853 --> 00:58:53,144
lt's been a long time ... since l had a woman.

360
00:59:04,953 --> 00:59:08,238
You think l'm stupid?

361
00:59:09,582 --> 00:59:12,702
l'm not stupid!

362
00:59:16,046 --> 00:59:21,171
- Shall l hit him again? - Throw him in the river!

363
00:59:21,343 --> 00:59:26,966
- l'm afraid l'd rather enjoy it. - Just tie him up!

364
01:00:02,256 --> 01:00:06,040
This was all one big setup, huh?

365
01:00:06,218 --> 01:00:11,260
Mateo ... you, stranded ... the shipwrecked boat ...

366
01:00:11,432 --> 01:00:17,267
- Your route to the hospital ... - You forgot the wasp.

367
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:31,778
What you do is not so hard. l can trap a snake, too.

368
01:00:33,244 --> 01:00:38,783
As smart as you are, you can survive without me.

369
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:53,177
We're gonna be home soon, okay?

370
01:01:12,698 --> 01:01:17,988
l can't believe how good you're doing. Hang in there, baby.

371
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:29,205
- ls it hard to drive? - No. Like a Cadillac Fleetwood.

372
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:35,050
l'll give you a driving lesson. Black knobs: Forward and back.

373
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:38,801
Red knobs: Fast and slow.

374
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:44,393
Wheel: left and right. Any trouble, turn off the ignition.

375
01:01:44,561 --> 01:01:49,472
Take it for a spin. Take us back to civilisation.

376
01:01:49,649 --> 01:01:55,354
- Shit, no problem! - Take us back to ...

377
01:01:56,197 --> 01:02:01,653
- Crisp sheets and hot showers. - The play-offs and a six-pack!

378
01:02:01,827 --> 01:02:07,201
- Golf, and a gin and tonic. - L.A. traffic and mobile phones.

379
01:02:07,374 --> 01:02:10,043
Don't start!

380
01:02:34,316 --> 01:02:38,313
The waterfall. A beautiful sight, baby bird.

381
01:02:39,195 --> 01:02:44,782
- The legend was right. - What is this place?

382
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:51,408
Oh dear. lt's absolutely beautiful.

383
01:02:57,087 --> 01:03:01,464
- What the hell was that? - l think we hit the bottom.

384
01:03:01,633 --> 01:03:05,796
Turn the wheel hard over left.

385
01:03:08,056 --> 01:03:10,381
Reverse.

386
01:03:12,351 --> 01:03:15,436
Shut it down.

387
01:03:29,743 --> 01:03:35,745
- We got to winch ourselves loose. - And get in the water?

388
01:03:35,915 --> 01:03:41,336
We ain't got much choice. We'll wrap a rope around that tree.

389
01:03:41,504 --> 01:03:46,711
You wrap a rope around thattree. Or we're stuck here forever.

390
01:03:46,884 --> 01:03:53,301
- We've got to make it quick. - l rather hoped l'd done my bit.

391
01:03:57,811 --> 01:04:01,345
- That's our rope. - There's just enough.

392
01:04:01,523 --> 01:04:07,442
Take this and get it around that trunk, so it's secure.

393
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:14,784
Last time l tried this, l had to pick leeches off my scrotum.

394
01:04:52,821 --> 01:04:55,987
Aren't you going to pray?

395
01:04:56,157 --> 01:05:00,534
Never look in the eyes of those you kilI.

396
01:05:00,703 --> 01:05:05,365
They will haunt you forever. l know.

397
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:19,509
l firmly resolve ...

398
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,344
... with help and grace to confess my sins ...

399
01:05:23,516 --> 01:05:27,300
... and amend my life. Amen!

400
01:05:27,478 --> 01:05:32,638
Sanctus ... sanctus ...

401
01:05:32,817 --> 01:05:35,770
... baby bird.

402
01:05:57,298 --> 01:06:00,880
Hurry up.

403
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:20,941
Back on the boat. Now!

404
01:06:22,613 --> 01:06:25,863
- Go! - Christ!

405
01:06:27,493 --> 01:06:31,407
Get on the boat. Go on, hurry!

406
01:06:38,712 --> 01:06:42,626
Over here, you fat-ass bastard!

407
01:06:55,686 --> 01:06:59,766
Get up on the rocks.

408
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:05,770
lt's coming.

409
01:07:05,946 --> 01:07:09,528
Go get the gun. Get it!

410
01:07:15,371 --> 01:07:18,574
Hurry up!

411
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:23,366
- Westridge, keep going! - Danny, watch out!

412
01:07:54,742 --> 01:07:57,197
Move your arm!

413
01:08:34,404 --> 01:08:37,819
Danny!

414
01:08:41,577 --> 01:08:44,246
Westridge!

415
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,173
Come on, hurry up!

416
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:07,800
l'm caught.

417
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,812
Hurry up.

418
01:09:35,836 --> 01:09:39,039
Danny, hold on!

419
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:21,250
You killed my warrior snake.

420
01:10:25,425 --> 01:10:27,832
Get up.

421
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:31,675
The dart.

422
01:10:37,061 --> 01:10:40,643
The tranquillizer's working. Get him!

423
01:10:50,532 --> 01:10:53,651
Damn, the dart came out his back.

424
01:10:55,203 --> 01:10:59,449
Come on, almost there.

425
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:11,041
Baby ..? He's lost consciousness again.

426
01:11:12,552 --> 01:11:17,629
l'll try to get us out. The tree knocked us loose.

427
01:11:31,528 --> 01:11:34,731
Terri, look.

428
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:59,711
- They might have some fuel. - Let's check it out.

429
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,476
- Need some help? - No, l'm cool.

430
01:12:26,205 --> 01:12:31,709
l don't even want to know what happened here.

431
01:12:31,877 --> 01:12:35,826
l hope they got some fuel.

432
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:26,091
Damn!

433
01:13:27,554 --> 01:13:31,172
Those drums ... Could be fuel.

434
01:14:02,628 --> 01:14:05,831
A snake skin.

435
01:14:14,348 --> 01:14:18,559
- There's plenty of fuel in here. - Welcome!

436
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:11,057
Time to wake up.

437
01:15:20,285 --> 01:15:25,160
- Monkey blood. - l'm gonna kill you, Sarone!

438
01:15:25,331 --> 01:15:29,411
Don't get me upset.

439
01:15:33,922 --> 01:15:36,709
See this?

440
01:15:36,884 --> 01:15:41,177
Human bones. That's how it comes out.

441
01:15:41,346 --> 01:15:45,011
Ashes to ashes ...

442
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:03,692
Shit, look!

443
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:07,947
Come on.

444
01:16:35,731 --> 01:16:37,806
Go!

445
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:44,626
Gotcha!

446
01:18:03,938 --> 01:18:06,394
Get loose.

447
01:18:32,048 --> 01:18:35,132
Let's get out!

448
01:18:39,472 --> 01:18:41,390
Just go! Run! lt's coming for you.

449
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:43,798
Just go! Run! lt's coming for you.

450
01:19:36,442 --> 01:19:39,146
Danny, where are you?

451
01:19:40,195 --> 01:19:44,193
- lt's a nest. - l'll go up the smokestack.

452
01:19:44,366 --> 01:19:47,984
- No, l've got the legs. - We can trap it there.

453
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,653
Go!

454
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:21,191
- Can you climb out? - l can use the rope.

455
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,143
Hurry, l think l can blow him up.

456
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:42,205
- l'm going to light it. - Go ahead, l'm at the top.

457
01:20:47,967 --> 01:20:51,217
Danny!

458
01:20:57,351 --> 01:21:01,218
- Get out, the fuse is lit. - Danny, wait!

459
01:21:03,982 --> 01:21:07,398
Hit the hinges.

460
01:21:24,919 --> 01:21:28,287
- Jump! - l can't, it's too high.

461
01:22:14,715 --> 01:22:18,084
l got you. Come on.

462
01:22:21,305 --> 01:22:24,887
Did we get him?

463
01:22:28,854 --> 01:22:32,353
We got him.

464
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,018
You all right?

465
01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:45,445
We should get the fuel, so we can get out of here.

466
01:22:45,619 --> 01:22:48,905
Come on.

467
01:23:15,356 --> 01:23:18,724
Bitch.

468
01:23:24,781 --> 01:23:28,613
Let's get out of here.

469
01:23:43,632 --> 01:23:46,337
Miss Flores ...

470
01:23:49,096 --> 01:23:52,714
You're a mess.

471
01:24:17,122 --> 01:24:21,285
l found another one. Let me see that.

472
01:24:23,128 --> 01:24:25,535
Shirishama.

473
01:24:26,464 --> 01:24:31,589
- Sarone was right. - Danny!

474
01:24:40,936 --> 01:24:45,313
Damn ... l'll get the camera.

475
01:24:47,442 --> 01:24:50,941
- Roll film! - Camera rolling.
