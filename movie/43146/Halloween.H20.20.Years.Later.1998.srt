- Hey. Hey, Miss Wittington.
What's goin' on ?

3
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:10,358
- My house was broken into.
- No shit ?

00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,233
No shit.

Yeah, but they're all dead.

Okay.
Right, thanks.

They said to give 'em
15 minutes and they'll be by.

11
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,858
- Jimmy, where are you going ?
- Check out your house.

12
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:37,150
- No, wait for the police.
Where's the fun in that, huh ?

13
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,525
- Are you coming ?

14
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,983
Nah, l-l better stay
here and protect her.

15

Oh-ho !
Right, dude.

mess with me here !

Jimmy been suspended
five times this year already...

19
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,233

All right.

25
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Nothin' to fear.
The coast is clear.

26
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,025
- You sure ?
- Yeah.

27
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,150
- I checked all the rooms
and all the closets.
- Nothing's missing.

28
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:07,317
I don't think so, but they,
uh, they did a real number
on your office.

29
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,692
- My office ?
- Yeah, there's crap everywhere.

30
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:15,608
Oh, and, uh, also they messed up
your kitchen really bad, too. Ick.

00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,692
Good night.

32

So much for the cops.

00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:40,567
Perfect.

34
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:50,108
- We got beer ! Yes !

35
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,567
- We'll get messed up, man.

36
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,567
I say we egg the house
across the street.

37
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:56,567

- Why not ?

Marion Wittington.
Dr. Sam Loomis's nurse ?

57
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:43,900
He was that shrink
that died a few years ago.

58
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:45,900
He lived here.
She took care of him.

59
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:48,358
Oh, I remember him.
I saw a thing on 60 Minutes on him.

60
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,442
Spent his life tracking down
that Halloween guy...

61
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:52,442
who butchered all those kids
up in Haddonfield, right ?

62
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:55,025
- Michael Myers.
- Right.

63
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,317
- Hey, you don't think Michael Myers--
- They never found his body.

64
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:01,317
Yeah, but that was,
like, 20 years ago.

65
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,900
Fuck me.

66
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,900
Loomis was obsessed
with Michael Myers.

67
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:16,067
This is quite
a love fest.

68

- I'll call up to Haddonfield
and warn 'em.
- There's no way, Fitz.

69
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:21,275
Just a precaution.
Tomorrow's Halloween.

70
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:23,942
All right, you tell 'em to look for
a guy with a cane and Alzheimer's.

71
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:26,358
The guy would be
younger than I am, okay ?

72
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:29,608
I was 15 when he killed
his sister back in '63.

73
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:32,733
Yes, Fitzsimmons. Patch me through
to Haddonfield, please.

74
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:36,317
- Yeah.
- Michael Myers.

75
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,650
Yeah, right.

76
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:19,733
I met him 15 years ago.

77
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:21,733
I was told
there was nothing left.

78
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:24,317
No reason, no conscience.

79
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:28,025
No understanding. Even the most
rudimentary sense of life...

80
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:31,483
and death, of good or evil...

81
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,483
right or wrong.

82
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,608
I met this
six-year-old child...

83
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,525
with this blank, pale,
emotionless face, and...

84
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,233
the blackest eyes.

85
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:47,608
The devil's eyes.

86
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,733
I spent eight years trying to reach him...

87
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:18,025
and then another seven
trying to keep him locked up...

88
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:22,025
because I realized that what was living
behind that boy's eyes...

89
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:25,650
was purely, and simply...

90
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,650
evil.

91
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,483
Mom ! Mom ! Mom. Mom.

92
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:34,775
- Mom ! Mom ! Mom. Mom !

93
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,483
You okay ? You all right ?

94
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:43,233
Oh. Oh !

95
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:47,483
- Everything's okay. It's okay.

96
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:51,942
- Do you need somethin' ?
- Oh ! Uh, yeah.

97
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,942
Yeah, please. Thanks.

98
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,483

00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,192
- Making toast.
- Mm--

103
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:55,900
No.
None for me, thanks.

104
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:59,650
- Caffeine is not a food group.
- We're out of Percodan.

105
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,608
Got mail.
It's from your dad.

106
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:13,525
- Birthday card.
- It's only two months late.
I'm impressed.

107
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,983
Cash is good. I'm gonna need it
when I go to Yosemite.

108
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:19,067
- You're not going.
- Yes, I am.

109
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:22,108
No, you're not.

110
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:25,233
Yes, I am, and with your full blessing.
Do you want to know why ?

111
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,275
- Why ?
- Because today is the day.

112
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:30,817
I can feel it.
Today is the day...

113
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,525
that you're going to realize
that I'm 17 years old...

114
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,108
and your overprotection and paranoia
is inhibiting my growth process.

115
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,650
Want to go camping ?
I'll take you camping.

116
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,942
I don't want
to go with you.

117
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:46,983
Sorry.

118
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:50,233
- Dad would let me go.
- Well, Dad...

119
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,817
is an abusive, chain-smoking
methadone addict.

120
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:54,817
Who would attract
someone like that ?

121
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,775
- Ouch.
- And just think, he left you.

122
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,817
Look, John.

123
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:05,942
I know you get your smart mouth
from my side of the family,
so I'll give you a break.

124
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,067
- But point check, you're going too far.
- No, I'm goin' to Yosemite.

125
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:12,400
- No, you're not.
- Look, Mom, help me out here.

126
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:15,233
I need a little more open air.
I've earned it.

127
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:19,233
Look, I know today is the day,
but I think that--

128
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:22,400
- Oh, really ? What day is that, John ?
- Halloween.

129
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,858
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

130
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:29,108
Look, Mom,
we're through with all that.

131
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,942
We really are.

132
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:44,525
You know what you're becoming ?
You're becoming an Oedipal
enabler, you know that ?

133
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,400
- Thank you.
- I'm serious !

134
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,650
Twenty years from now, you're still
going to be living with her.

135
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,692
Probably running some weird motel
out in the middle of nowhere.

136
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:53,692
- So this means no Yosemite ?
- Correct.

137
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:55,817
- Now, how do I get out of it ?
- Why don't you want to go ?

138
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:58,650
Oh, it's so lame.
No, no, no. It's worse.

139
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,942
I-l went there
two summers ago with my family.

140
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,817
Loathsome. No, it's worse.
It'll come to me.

141
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,942
Wretched. You know ?
Okay, think-think...

142
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,942
campfires, s'mores--

143
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:34,817
Repugnant !
That's it, repugnant.

144
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:36,858
I would rather have
my eyes pierced.

145
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:41,108
I'm very sorry.
I wish I could help. I'm sorry.

146
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,233
- But he promised that--
- No. I'm not going.

147
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:46,067
You couldn't pay me to go.

148
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:52,150
- Hey, what's wrong ?
- Oh-- Uh, my dad.

149
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:55,150
He flaked on
my financial aid again.

150
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:58,108
- The bursar's being such a dick.
Now I can't go to Yosemite.
- You're not going either ?

151
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,108
- No.
- I'm not going.

152
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,108
- How are you going to get out of it ?
- Please.

153
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,275
- Hey. Hold on. We ditch Yosemite.

154
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,817
It means we could have
a Halloween party, just the four of us.

155
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:10,233
Whole place would be empty.
We'd have the run of it.

156
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,692
- We could have a roaming orgy.
- I love the way this man thinks !

157
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:16,858
Hope that's not
the only thing you love about me.

158
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:23,442
- Hey, come on.
- All right, let's go.

159
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:53,108
Okay. You see,
I told you we'd make it.

160
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,567
When I was a little girl,
we used to pee in the woods.

161
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,942
- Ohh ! Uh--
- Don't worry !

162
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,858
Come on.

163
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:21,108
Mom, that's the boys' room.

164
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,275
Then the boys are just
gonna have to deal with it.

165
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:26,692
Hello ?

166
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:32,942
Okay. Coast is clear.

167
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,858
Okay. Come on.

168
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:56,150
I'll be just next door.
Mom's gotta go too.

169
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:59,525
## "Mary Had A Little Lamb"

170
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
- Oh !
- Mom ?

171
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
I know.

172
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:12,983
- Mom ?
- It's just the door, Casey.

173
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,983
Here's some tissues--
Casey ?

174
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,317
Spiders !

175
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,150
All right.
Ready ? You know why you're here.

176
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:34,733
The buses leave for Yosemite
at 4:15, sharp.

177
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,442
And now it's time for me
to do my obligatory plea...

178
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:49,275
that you uphold
the standards of Hillcrest.

179
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,858
And that means
no musical sleeping bags.

180
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,858
- No booze.

181
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,983
- No drugs, no kidding.

182
00:22:58,025 --> 00:23:00,858
Undoubtedly, someone will ruin it
for the rest of them...

183
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,025
so I just want to remind you that
the entire teaching faculty has--

184
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,567
- Hey ! Guess what this is.
- What ?

185
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:10,817
It's my history report.
Forgot to hand it in.

186
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:13,150
Guess who's not going to Yosemite.
I'm so bummed.

187
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:15,192
Guess who has a fever of 102...

188
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:17,192
and has to stay in bed
all weekend long.

189
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:20,858
- You two company ?
- So, what's the plan ?

190
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,608
Romantic dinner,
candlelight, soft music.

191
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:26,900
- Animal sex.
- You need a hormone suppressant.

192
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:29,733
You're embarrassing
the newlyweds, Charles.

193
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:32,442
That's it.
Have a good time.

194
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,317
And why aren't
you going camping, Miss Tate ?

195
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,150
Because it sounds like fun.
And you, Mr. Brennan ?

196
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:45,025
Guidance counselors aren't usually
a big hit in the wilderness.

197
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,150
Besides, somebody has to stay behind and
watch over the three or four outcasts.

198
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:50,192
Oh, good morning, Miss Tate.

199
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:52,317
- Morning, Norma.
- Your mail and messages are
on your desk,

200
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,733
along with the
new quarter budget, and oh,

201
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,317
surprise, surprise, the drains in the
girls' shower room are clogged again.

202
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,858
- Can I talk to you alone
for one second ?
- But, l-l called the plumber,

203
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,858
and he assured me that
he will be here as soon as he can--

204
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,733
Thank you, Norma.
Thank you very much.

205
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:10,317
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Place of employment.

206
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,608
I'm sorry, l-l just--
I needed a fix.

207
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:19,317
- We still on for lunch ?
- Uh-huh. 1:00.

208
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,733
You are, without a doubt,
the most amazing,

209
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:26,483
challenging woman
I have ever met.

210
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,567
And what's wrong now ?

211
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:32,275
Can you just stop with the
Keri analysis just once, please ?

212
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:34,483
You can do it tomorrow,
all you want.

213
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:37,317
But please, can I just
have today off ?

214
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,692
- Whatever you want.
- Thank you.

215
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:43,483
- Lunch. Don't forget.
- 1:00.

216
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,483
Uh--

217
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,483
"He turned, just in time
to see her enter the room,

218
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:17,483
with her long, slender legs
that climbed high up her skirt,

219
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:20,317
Ieading to two tumultuous,

220
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:23,483
round, melon breasts."

221
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,483
Round melon what ?

222
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,483
Now why do you want
to label it like food ?

223
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,025
A-And what kind of melon
you talkin' about ?
Cantaloupe ? Watermelon ? What ?

224
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,317
Baby, it's fiction ! People like
to read descriptive adjectives.

225
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:36,733
- It sets the scene.
- It's stupid is what it is.

226
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,733
It's sensual
and romantic.

227
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:40,567
Ronny, it's unrealistic. This whole
writing career is unrealistic.

228
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,608
Ronny, it's unrealistic. This whole
writing career is unrealistic.

229
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:46,358
Hey, we're married now,
baby, we gotta get serious.

230
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:49,608
- This is serious.
- Honey, I been patient,
but this writing thing...

231
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:53,025
just ain't takin' off, and I want
a baby before I get so old...

232
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:55,275
- I can't get my butt back.
- You gotta give me a chance, honey.

233
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:59,192
I have to express myself creatively.
We payin' the bills, aren't we ?

234
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,608
- Uh ! Fuck me ! Shit !
- What ?

235
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:04,192
Not you, honey. Hold on for a sec.
You scared the shit out of me !

236
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:06,733
Sorry, Ronny.
I gotta ask a favor, man.

237
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,650
- I'm not lettin' you out of here.
- Aw, come on, man.

238
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,650
- Jus-Just for lunch. Please.
- Look, your mom told me...

239
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:13,025
the next time I let you loose,
I was gonna be fired.

240
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:16,442
- Look, man.
I got a date with Molly tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:19,442
And I want to make it special.
What do you say ?

242
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:24,275
Look, I promise I'll be back
for afternoon classes.

243
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,733
Huh ? I just want
to get a gift.

244
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:28,858
Come on, man, have a heart.

245
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:35,358
No. No. Can't do it.

246
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:38,733
Aw, come on, man.
Okay, how about this ?

247
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:42,275
- You accidentally press the gate.
- Mm-hmm.

248
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,483
And when you have
your back turned, we sneak out.

249
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,775
Ronny, don't you get your ass fired--

250
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:55,858
- Don't you do me wrong, okay ?
- Not a chance, man ! Cool.

251
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,317
- All right.
- Get outta here, get outta here.
Comb your hair.

252
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:01,275
- Just one more book.

253
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:04,317
Just one more, and I promise
I'll work with your daddy, all right ?

254
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:02,442
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh, Jesus, Will.

255
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:05,900
- I'm sorry. I thought you saw me.
- No.

256
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:08,858
You see me now ?

257
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,650
How are you doin' ?

258
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:24,608
You wanna talk about it ?

259
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,900
I think I'm losing John.

260
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:34,900
I think he's finally
tired of my bullshit.

261
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,608
How about you ?

262
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,608
You tired of my bullshit ?

263
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,192
I'm a counselor.
I'm attracted to it.

264
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:51,067
- So counsel me.
- Oh, no. I know better.

265
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,358
I love you just
the way you are.

266
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:59,233
Do you think
it's possible...

267
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:01,233
that something so tragic
can happen to somebody...

268
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:03,233
that they never
recover from it ?

269
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:07,483
I like to believe that
recovery is always possible.

270
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:16,733
There's a little back story
that I haven't been, um...

271
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,108
- completely successful with.
- I know.

272
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:27,358
I've tried everything. I really have.
I've tried everything.

273
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:32,817
Twelve steps, uh,
self-help, group therapy,

274
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,775
shrinks, meditation--

275
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:43,608
- Everything.
- That's not everything.

276
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,650
Oh, yeah ?
What else is there ?

277
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:50,192
I'm a really
good listener.

278
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:02,067
Maybe.
Some night, by a...

279
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:04,067
warm fire.

280
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:12,192
I'll be right back.

281
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,358
Can I get another glass
of Chardonnay, please ?

282
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:26,358
- Today.
- Yes, ma'am.

283
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,358
Thank you.

284
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:41,233
Thanks.

285
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:46,400
Thank you very much.

286
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,775
God. I can't believe
we're doin' this.

287
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
- Desperate measures.
- It's illegal.

288
00:31:04,942 --> 00:31:06,942
It's harmless,
and expected.

289
00:31:06,942 --> 00:31:08,942
Studies have proven that
all teenagers, at some point...

290
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,775
- in their adolescent lives,
have shoplifted.
- What studies ?

291
00:31:11,817 --> 00:31:13,692
Hey. We could have avoided
this whole thing...

292
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:15,692
if you woulda simply scored
some of your mom's booze.

293
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:18,233
- Look, my mom's a functioning
- alcoholic. She accounts for--
- John !

294
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:23,067
- John, what are you doing here ?
- Just gettin' some off-campus lunch.

295
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:26,692
You're not allowed to have
little off-campus lunches, John.

296
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:30,650
- You know that. You too, Charlie.
- Sorry, Miss Tate.

297
00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:35,067
Come on,
I'll drive you back.

298
00:31:35,108 --> 00:31:37,358
You know what ?
Charlie, here.

299
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:39,942
Go get in the car.
I'll be right there.

300
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,692
What the fuck
do you think you're doing ?

301
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,775
Mom, I'm really uncomfortable
with you saying that word.

302
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:46,942
Well, then don't put me
in the position, John.

303
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:49,608
Do you know
what day it is ?

304
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,775
Of all the days
for you to pull this shit--

305
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:57,483
What do you think you can do ?
Just wander around town ?

306
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:59,483
I don't ask you
for very much.

307
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:02,942
- Just give me one day !
- Mom, I've given you 17 years !

308
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:05,317
And I need you
to be responsible.

309
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:08,650
- Do you know what that means ?
- Responsible. Don't talk to me
about responsible, Mom !

310
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:13,192
- I just need this one thing !
- Mom, I am not responsible for you !

311
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:17,358
That's it. That's enough.
I can't take it, Mom.

312
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:19,358
He's dead.

313
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:22,525
Michael Myers is dead.

314
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,275
- What do you want me to say ?
- That it's over ?

315
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:32,192
That we should try to get on with
some attempt at a happy existence, Mom.

316
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:35,108
Because all the shit that's going on
in your head is leakin' out on me.

317
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:37,233
And I can't take it anymore.

318
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,608
You told me yourself
you watched him burn.

319
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,608
- I didn't e-exactly stay
to see his ashes, John.
- Mom, 20 years.

320
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,692
Twenty years.

321
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:53,650
Don't you think he would
have shown up by now ?

322
00:32:53,692 --> 00:32:56,192
What's he waitin' for, huh ?

323
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:01,108
Okay, Mom. I can't live
like this. I'm sorry.

324
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:04,525
Wha--
What does that mean, John ?

325
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,900
If you want to stay handcuffed
to your dead brother, that's fine.

326
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:10,400
But you're not draggin' me along.
Not anymore.

327
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,525
- # Mister Sandman #
- Yes ?

328
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,400
# Bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a-- ##

329
00:33:40,942 --> 00:33:42,817
Ronny ?

330
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:46,942
- Mom, let me.
- Where the hell is he ?

331
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:53,775
- Ronny !

332
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:56,942
Hey, Ronny !

333
00:34:11,942 --> 00:34:14,567
- Where the hell were you ?
- Norma told me to walk the perimeter.

334
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
And where were you
when these two got out ?

335
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,150
Eyes up, Ronny.

336
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,817
Psycho.

337
00:34:43,983 --> 00:34:46,983
Okay, bye !

338
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:05,983
- Dennis !

339
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:10,400
- Don't send down any more, all right ?
I gotta go to class.

340
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:31,400
Dennis ?

341
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:38,942
- Oh ! Uh !
- Shh ! The best part.

342
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:44,525
Oh !

343
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:46,983
Do I get points or what ?

344
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:49,025
Huh ?

345
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:52,858
You score. Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:36:52,942 --> 00:36:55,275
Hmm. Well, it just
occurred to me today...

347
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:58,942
that I've never
celebrated Halloween before.

348
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,942
And why is that ?

349
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:03,733
Oh, we've got a psychotic
serial killer in the family,

350
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:06,275
Ioves to butcher people
on Halloween, and...

351
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,442
I just thought it
in bad taste to...

352
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:11,442
celebrate.

353
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:13,692
So why now ?

354
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:16,942
Mm, because there comes a point in your
life where you have to concentrate...

355
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:18,983
on what's right about it.

356
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:22,858
Really ?

357
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,942
And you...

358
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:31,275
are a sterling example...

359
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,275
of what's right.

360
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:38,150
And tonight you get
my full concentration.

361
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,108
I'm honored.

362
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:54,317
Very good point, A.J.
So, what could Victor have done...

363
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
to save Elizabeth ?

364
00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:05,233
Anybody at all ?

365
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:10,942
Come on, people.
Did anybody read the book ?

366
00:38:12,442 --> 00:38:16,317
Guys.
It's "Frahnk-en-steen."

367
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,567
- You could have watched the movie !

368
00:38:22,108 --> 00:38:24,442
Molly. Please.

369
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:26,567
Do you have any thoughts
on Victor and Elizabeth ?

370
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:29,275
Well, uh--
Um...

371
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:32,692
Well, I think that Victor should have
confronted the monster sooner.

372
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:34,733
I mea-- He's completely responsible
for Elizabeth's death.

373
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:38,567
He was, he was so paralyzed by fear
that he never did anything.

374
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,400
It-lt took death
for the guy to get a clue.

375
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:45,983
And why do you think he was
finally able to confront his monster ?

376
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:49,525
I think that Victor had reached
a point in his life where he
had nothing left to lose.

377
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:52,317
I mean, the monster saw to that
by killing off everybody that he loved.

378
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Victor finally
had to face it.

379
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:57,150
It was about redemption.
It was his fate.

380
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:04,317
Okay, everybody, um,
have a good time !

381
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,525
John !

382
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:29,108
What ?

383
00:39:35,817 --> 00:39:38,858
It's a permission slip.

384
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:41,317
Bus leaves in 45 minutes.

385
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,858
- Go pack quick.
- Ma, I don't have to go.

386
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,858
Go, just go ! Have fun.

387
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:49,817
- You sure ?
- Yes. Look, it's good for you.

388
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:52,025
It's good for me.

389
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,442
So, just call me.
You know, call. And call.

390
00:39:55,483 --> 00:39:57,983
If you feel like
you've called too many times,

391
00:39:58,025 --> 00:40:00,400
call once more.

392
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:03,442
Have a great time.

393
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,692
Thanks, Mom.

394
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:14,817
- Hi. So what was that all about ?
- Hey.

395
00:40:14,858 --> 00:40:16,817
She changed her mind
about Yosemite.

396
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:18,858
- So now you're goin' ?

397
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,858
Ah, I wouldn't say that.

398
00:40:39,775 --> 00:40:42,567
I don't know.
If we were at the midterm--

399
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,567
No, she's doing fine.

400
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:48,775
No--

401
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:56,150
Mrs. Cheney,
can I call you right back ?

402
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,733
- Uh, oh ! Oh !
- Damn it !

403
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:24,025
Oh, Miss Tate, I'm-l'm so sorry.
I-l didn't mean to make you jump.

404
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:27,483
- It's okay.
- Well, it's Halloween.
I guess everyone...

405
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:29,983
- is entitled to one good scare.

406
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:34,733
- I've had my share.
- U-Uh, Miss Tate,

407
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:37,400
I know it's not my place.

408
00:41:37,442 --> 00:41:41,400
If I could be maternal
for a moment,

409
00:41:41,442 --> 00:41:44,192
I don't like
to see you like this.

410
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:47,692
I've seen you
like this before, and...

411
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:51,275
we've all had bad
things happen to us.

412
00:41:51,317 --> 00:41:55,025
The trick is
to concentrate on today !

413
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,067
What do I know ?

414
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,317
You just take care
of yourself, okay ?

415
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:05,692
Thank you very much.
I'll see you Monday.

416
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:15,317
Oh ! Mi-Miss Tate,
uh, Happy Halloween.

417
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:18,067
"She took off her clothes,
revealing her satiny-soft femininity.

418
00:43:18,192 --> 00:43:20,275
And Lawrence looked at her
with lust in his eyes...

419
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:23,650
and said, 'l want to invade
every part of your being.

420
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:26,858
I want to tantalize myself
with your sweet nectar.'"

421
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
Old Tanya better not
fall for that shit.

422
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,317
- I smell that a mile away.
- "And Tanya laughed at him.

423
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:34,317
'You don't expect me to fall
for that shit,' she said."

424
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:37,275
That's right,
make her smart. That's it.

425
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:39,317
- Oh, shit, honey, someone's here.
Can I call you back ?

426
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:41,608
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'll hold on.
I wanna know what stupid line...

427
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,358
-Tanya falls for.
-The same one you did. Hold on a second.

428
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:59,067
- Hello !

429
00:43:59,192 --> 00:44:01,067
Hello !

430
00:45:04,025 --> 00:45:05,942
- Hey, honey.
- What's up ? Where did you go ?

431
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:09,150
I don't know. Some car at the gate.
I'm gonna have to call you.

432
00:45:27,483 --> 00:45:29,775
- Hey.
- Wait, wait. What's goin' on, baby ?

433
00:45:29,817 --> 00:45:32,525
- I don't know.

434
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:34,817
Honey-- Where'd you--
Ronny !

435
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,150
You always fuckin' doin' this. You get
me goin', and then you gotta go. Ro--

436
00:45:40,192 --> 00:45:42,733
Hello ?

437
00:47:15,483 --> 00:47:17,358
- Aah !
- Oh !

438
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:19,817
I keep scaring you today.

439
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,692
Wh-What are you doing ?

440
00:47:22,775 --> 00:47:25,692
Uh, n--

441
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,650
Nothing. I, um--

442
00:47:30,692 --> 00:47:32,650
What are you doing ?

443
00:47:32,692 --> 00:47:35,775
I'm making the rounds. I still
have to check on the kids, but...

444
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,775
I was hoping I would have the honor of
spending the evening with you tonight.

445
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:44,192
I'd like the company.

446
00:47:44,233 --> 00:47:47,525
- Give me 20.
- Okay.

447
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,525
I'm okay.

448
00:48:05,692 --> 00:48:07,942
Hello ?

449
00:48:07,983 --> 00:48:12,358
Do you want to die tonight, Cici ?

450
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:16,650
- Oh, uh, come on... in.

451
00:48:18,608 --> 00:48:20,775
Sarah, Molly.

452
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:24,983
Just checking on the Hillcrest remains.
You girls okay ?

453
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:28,358
- Good. Thanks, Mr. Brennan.
- And how are you, Mr. Brennan ?
Looking cute as ever.

454
00:48:28,483 --> 00:48:30,942
Thank you, Sarah.
What are you two up to tonight ?

455
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:33,525
Well, we thought we'd hit the town,
pick up some guys.

456
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:36,400
You know, drop some Roofies in their
drinks. Have a whole date-rape evening.

457
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:38,817
- Oh. Sounds good.
- Care to join us ?

458
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,650
I can't. I'm, uh, I'm having
my nipples pierced.

459
00:48:41,775 --> 00:48:43,942
- Oh.
- But you two have a good time.

460
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:47,067
- Will do.
- If you need anything,
contact me or Miss Tate.

461
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:49,233
- Okay ?
- Thanks, Mr. Brennan.

462
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:50,942
Behave.

463
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:54,525
- My stash. Come on.

464
00:48:57,525 --> 00:49:01,942
- Come on.
- All right. Send it through here.

465
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,067
Come on, man. Let's go.

466
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,358
Yeah.

467
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:11,358
Come on.

468
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:15,358
John.

469
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,525
Come on !

470
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:22,108
I got you.

471
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:08,483
Fuck it.

472
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,525
I thought we'd do this right.

473
00:50:20,525 --> 00:50:22,525
Come on in.

474
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:29,192
Oh, I love food.
I really do.

475
00:50:29,233 --> 00:50:32,108
I hope you don't mind
if I get really big and dumpy.

476
00:50:32,192 --> 00:50:34,108
- It's my goal in life.
- Oh, no.

477
00:50:34,192 --> 00:50:37,567
I, uh, I always found obesity
to be very sexy.

478
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:39,983
God, you are so Renaissance.

479
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:54,233
Oh, the buffet has arrived !

480
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:56,817
Ah, for your pleasure tonight,

481
00:50:56,817 --> 00:51:01,483
we have prepared Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday's Hillcrest dinner selections,

482
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:04,108
ignoring Meat Loaf Monday
and Turkey Tuesday.

483
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,525
- Thank you very much.
I hate that meat loaf.
- Where's the booze ?

484
00:51:07,525 --> 00:51:10,525
- We need a corkscrew for that.
- Oh, I'll go get it.

485
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,275
- Just don't start anything without me.
- Don't worry.

486
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:42,108
I'm not who you think I am.

487
00:51:43,692 --> 00:51:45,567
Okay.

488
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:47,567
Who are you ?

489
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,942
My name's not Keri Tate.

490
00:51:52,983 --> 00:51:56,108
Mmm.

491
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,108
What is it ?

492
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:02,400
Laurie Strode.

493
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,400
- Strode ?
- Strode.

494
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,817
Okay.

495
00:52:10,942 --> 00:52:13,692
I changed my name
when I went into hiding.

496
00:52:13,775 --> 00:52:17,692
Oh, I like that.
That's like-- Iike the--
Iike the witness protection program.

497
00:52:17,692 --> 00:52:20,983
What, did you like rat out
the mob or something ?

498
00:52:23,942 --> 00:52:27,358
My brother killed my sister...

499
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,733
- when she was 17.
- Wow.

500
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:32,817
Well, that's... "sucky."

501
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:36,817
How'd he do that ?

502
00:52:36,817 --> 00:52:39,983
With a really big,
sharp kitchen knife.

503
00:52:40,108 --> 00:52:42,442
That's terrible.

504
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:44,442
Take off your clothes.

505
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:46,567
You said you'd listen.

506
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,400
Okay.

507
00:52:53,983 --> 00:52:57,108
They locked him up
for a long time,

508
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,567
but he got out and...

509
00:53:00,692 --> 00:53:03,275
he came after me,

510
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,108
but I got away.

511
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,692
But he killed
a lot of my friends.

512
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,858
- It happened--
- On Halloween.

513
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,983
- You've heard the story.
- Who hasn't ?

514
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,275
Michael Myers.

515
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:25,942
It's like 20 years ago, right ?

516
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:28,692
1978.

517
00:53:28,733 --> 00:53:31,733
And the girl that-- What happened
to the sister ? She died, right ?

518
00:53:34,275 --> 00:53:36,983
No, she faked her death.

519
00:53:39,275 --> 00:53:41,400
And now she's the headmistress...

520
00:53:41,442 --> 00:53:45,025
of a very posh, secluded
private school in northern California.

521
00:53:45,108 --> 00:53:47,317
What ?

522
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,858
Hoping and praying every year...

523
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:54,275
that her brother won't find her.

524
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,817
You're tellin' me the truth ?

525
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:03,108
- Now do you want a drink ?
- Yeah.

526
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,150
I'll be right back.

527
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,150
Explains a lot, doesn't it ?

528
00:54:19,233 --> 00:54:22,858
So you-- you have been living
with this for 20 years ?

529
00:54:22,942 --> 00:54:26,150
Something like that.

530
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:28,983
But honey, you-you don't--

531
00:54:29,108 --> 00:54:31,525
You don't think that
after all this time h-he'd--

532
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:34,733
he'd still be comin'
after you, do you ?

533
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,150
He sat in a sanitarium
for 15 years, waiting for me.

534
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:43,692
And then...

535
00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:50,025
one rainy night, he decides
to go trick-or-treating.

536
00:54:56,317 --> 00:54:58,275
How old were you ?

537
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,692
Seventeen.

538
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:11,442
What ?

539
00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:16,608
Do you think they made it to Yosemite ?
Do you think they're there ?

540
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:21,025
- I don't know.
- I just-- I just want
to call Johnny. Just--

541
00:55:24,275 --> 00:55:26,858
What is it ?
Keri, what are you doing ?

542
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,858
My phone's dead.

543
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:34,692
Shit.

544
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,567
- What's goin' on ?
- Somebody didn't go to Yosemite.

545
00:55:48,608 --> 00:55:50,817
Keri. Uh, what are you doing ?

546
00:55:50,858 --> 00:55:54,025
- I'm just gonna go find John.
- Th-- This is nuts.

547
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,567
I hope so.

548
00:55:57,442 --> 00:56:00,317
- Jesus !
- Christ !

549
00:56:00,442 --> 00:56:02,525
Ronny, the phones are out.

550
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,608
I know, and there's a strange car
parked down at the gate,

551
00:56:05,692 --> 00:56:08,400
but I can't seem to find
any signs of trespassing.

552
00:56:08,442 --> 00:56:11,317
- Fuck.
- Okay, th-there's no reason
to get upset yet.

553
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,692
Let's just calm down.

554
00:56:13,733 --> 00:56:16,150
Look, I'm gonna go look
for John and the kids.

555
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,983
See if you can get the phones
working, and we'll meet back
at the gate, okay ? Come on.

556
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,442
Charlie !

557
00:56:24,483 --> 00:56:26,817
Charlie ?

558
00:56:26,858 --> 00:56:29,858
Where are you, Charlie ?
We're waiting on you.

559
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:34,483
Charlie.

560
00:56:34,567 --> 00:56:37,025
Inconsiderate,
party of one,

561
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:39,317
your table's ready.

562
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,442
Charlie ?

563
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:54,150
Hi ! Gotcha.

564
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,150
You shit.

565
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,858
I found these,
but no corkscrew.

566
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:02,275
Come on. I'm hungry !
Where are you going now ?

567
00:57:02,317 --> 00:57:04,817
To see if there's
a corkscrew upstairs.

568
00:57:04,858 --> 00:57:07,108
- I'll be right back.

569
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,317
- Charlie.

570
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:42,858
Shit.

571
00:58:26,608 --> 00:58:29,025
Hi.

572
00:58:54,608 --> 00:58:57,192
- Shit.

573
00:58:58,317 --> 00:59:00,692
Lights up, Charlie.

574
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:03,692
No sex games
till I've eaten.

575
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:10,067
Fuck.

576
00:59:20,775 --> 00:59:23,567
Charlie.

577
00:59:23,608 --> 00:59:26,483
Charlie, what are you--

578
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:29,733
Oh, shit !
Oh, my God !

579
00:59:32,192 --> 00:59:33,900
No !

580
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:38,025
Oh, my--

581
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,317
Aaah !

582
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:57,192
Oh !

583
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,275
- Oh !

584
01:00:27,025 --> 01:00:30,650
# They're laid to rest before ##

585
01:00:30,775 --> 01:00:33,650
- Did you hear that ?
- No. What was that ?

586
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:35,650
## [ Off ]

587
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:39,317
I'm gonna go check
on those guys.

588
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:41,608
They've been gone
for a while.

589
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,775
- What do you think they're doin' ?
- Hmm.

590
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:46,233
- Mm-hmm.
- Kind of rates a cheap scare,
doesn't it ?

591
01:00:46,317 --> 01:00:48,233
- Let's go.
- All right.

592
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:03,775
Oh, fuck !

593
01:01:03,858 --> 01:01:05,858
Please.

594
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:17,442
Oh, please !

595
01:01:40,608 --> 01:01:44,067
- Hello !
- Maybe they just skipped to dessert.

596
01:01:46,608 --> 01:01:48,733
- What the hell's that ?
- Oh, man.

597
01:01:51,525 --> 01:01:53,483
What the fuck ?

598
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:06,817
This is a sick joke.

599
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:34,900
- Oh, shit !

600
01:02:34,942 --> 01:02:38,608
Who's that ?

601
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:41,192
- Let's get out of here.

602
01:02:41,317 --> 01:02:44,108
Keep moving. Keep moving !

603
01:02:45,525 --> 01:02:48,233
Go. Go.

604
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:50,483
- Go.
- Come on !

605
01:02:58,442 --> 01:03:01,025
- Come on !
- John, please !

606
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:03,650
Oh, God. Oh, God.
What the fuck are we gonna do ?

607
01:03:03,775 --> 01:03:07,067
We go to the dorms, and we're gonna
call the cops. Okay ?

608
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:09,775
- Come on.

609
01:03:09,817 --> 01:03:12,192
Oh, my God !
Oh, no, please !

610
01:03:18,817 --> 01:03:20,900
Aaah !

611
01:03:23,817 --> 01:03:25,733
Come on !

612
01:03:25,775 --> 01:03:28,358
Come on. Come on.

613
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:41,067
Get up.

614
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:52,025
Oh ! My keys.

615
01:03:52,067 --> 01:03:54,733
- Fuck ! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- Come on. Come on.

616
01:03:54,775 --> 01:03:57,942
I can't find it ! Oh, God.

617
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,358
- Find the fucking keys !
- I know !

01:04:02,525 --> 01:04:05,483
Fuck !

01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:08,692
Oh... shit !

620
01:04:09,942 --> 01:04:12,025

621
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:13,942
- Molly !

622
01:04:13,942 --> 01:04:16,233
- No !
- Molly !

623
01:04:26,942 --> 01:04:29,650
Somebody open
the fucking door !

624
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,108
Oh, my God !

625
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:39,942
- Somebody open the door !

626
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:07,317

627
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:09,650
- Oh, God, he's stabbed.
- Can you walk ?
- Yeah.

628
01:05:09,692 --> 01:05:12,358
- Oh, God.

629
01:05:16,775 --> 01:05:18,942
- Wait.
- Who was that ?

630
01:05:20,942 --> 01:05:22,942
My brother.

631
01:05:28,817 --> 01:05:31,900
Get in there.
Barricade the door. Lock it.

632
01:05:31,942 --> 01:05:34,358

633
01:05:34,483 --> 01:05:36,942
Go !

634
01:05:36,942 --> 01:05:39,233
All right, what do we do ?
What do we do ?

635
01:05:39,275 --> 01:05:41,233
Try to live.

636
01:05:52,275 --> 01:05:54,108
Go.
- What ?

637
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:56,108
- Jump. Go !
- Keri.

638
01:05:56,233 --> 01:05:58,983
- I'm not leaving you.
- I'm not leaving John.

639
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:03,650
Keri !

640
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:20,817
Oh.

641
01:06:24,692 --> 01:06:27,817
Oh, no !

642
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,400
Oh ! Oh, God !

643
01:06:31,108 --> 01:06:33,483
Oh, God. Oh, no.

644
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:37,067
- Oh.

645
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:42,108
Oh, God. Oh.

646
01:06:42,233 --> 01:06:45,525

647
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:05,983
Oh, fuck !

01:07:29,983 --> 01:07:32,108
- Open up !
- Oh, my God !

650
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:34,775
Go. Go !

651
01:07:44,775 --> 01:07:47,525
Run ! Run !

652
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:50,567
Run !

653
01:07:54,567 --> 01:07:57,525
Oh, my God !

654
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:04,400
Shit !

655
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,817
Come on.

656
01:08:06,858 --> 01:08:08,650
Go ! Now !

657
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,858
Mom !

659
01:08:25,108 --> 01:08:28,150
Oh, my God !

660
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:47,108
Miss Tate, come on !

661
01:08:47,233 --> 01:08:49,817
- Go.

662
01:08:50,983 --> 01:08:53,692
- What ?
- Go !

663
01:08:53,733 --> 01:08:56,650
I want you to drive down
the street to the Becker's.

664
01:08:56,692 --> 01:08:59,525
It's a mile down the road. Tell them
to call an ambulance and get the police.

665
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:02,733
- No, we're not leaving you.
- Do as I say, now !

666
01:09:02,817 --> 01:09:04,983
- Mom ?
- I'll be right behind you.

667
01:09:05,067 --> 01:09:08,275
- Mom !
- I'll be right behind you. Go !

668
01:09:57,108 --> 01:09:59,275
Michael !

669
01:10:02,692 --> 01:10:04,650
Michael !

670
01:10:13,692 --> 01:10:15,650
Michael ?

671
01:11:42,858 --> 01:11:45,275
Ohh !

672
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:49,858
- He's dead. He's dead. H-He's dead.
- No. No.

673
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:53,442
- Shh, shh, shh, shh. He's dead.

674
01:14:53,483 --> 01:14:57,150
He's dead, gone.
Shh, shh. Shh.

675
01:15:15,317 --> 01:15:19,275
I got it ! Hey, baby,
I'm gonna write a romantic thriller !

676
01:15:19,317 --> 01:15:21,358
- What ?
- Yeah, a thriller.

677
01:15:21,442 --> 01:15:24,900
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

678
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:28,442
Yeah ! I'm fine.
The bullet just grazed me.

679
01:15:44,608 --> 01:15:46,608
Don't move.

680
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:49,067
Load him in !
Shut the door !

681
01:15:49,192 --> 01:15:52,067
- Hey, hey ! Wait a minute.
- You, move !

682
01:15:56,858 --> 01:16:00,608
