1
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:34,876
We are back!

2
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,134
Let's go!

00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:16,511

00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:23,183
♪ Girl, you really got me now ♪

00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:30,063

11
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:43,927
♪ You really got me (Oh!)

12
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,662
Nuts!

13
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,697
Gimme the Black Beauty.

14
00:01:54,698 --> 00:02:00,089
Alvin, take it easy up there.
You've got to share the spotlight.

15
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,366
You got it, Dave.

16
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,435
- Dave.
- I'm serious, Alvin. This is a charity benefit.

17
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,020
- It's not all about you.
- Sorry, Dave. I can't hear you...

18
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:14,563
over the thousands of fans
screaming my name.

19
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,334
I've got this.

20
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,998
I need a help, boys.

21
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:47,284
Alvin, will you please get down from there.

22
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,720
I can't hear you.

23
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:53,284
- Alvin, I'm not kidding.
- What?

24
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,009
Dave, look out!

25
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,000
Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

26
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:08,676
Oh, Dave.

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,676
Dave?

28
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,981
This should help with the pain.

29
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,468
I wannna talk to my boys.

30
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:24,111
I just gave you a sedative
that will take effect in about one minute, so...

31
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:27,671
But, let them in, quickly.

32
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:33,253
- Dave!
- You are alive! - Hey guys!

33
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,761
- It was an accident. I swear.
- Are you OK?

34
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:38,820
- I'm really sorry, Dave.
- I'll be fine.

35
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,127
I'm just gonna be stucked here for a while.

36
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,983
And until I get out, I made arrangements for
my aunt Jackie to come and stay with you.

37
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:47,210
Who is Aunt Jackie?

38
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:51,025
The one who sent us those mail package of
yummy popcorn for Christmas.

39
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:54,279
- Popcorn Jackie.
- You don't have much time Mr Seville.

40
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,147
Listen, I want you guys to go home
and live a normal childhood.

41
00:04:00,277 --> 00:04:04,647
I even made arrangement
for you to go to school.

42
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:07,605
- School?
- Yes, school.

43
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:11,130
Simon, I'm putting you in charge.

44
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:16,227
- You are?
- I'm counting on you.

45
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,545
Dave, wait a minute.
Why is he in charge?

46
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:23,337
- He's counting on me.
- Dave, please, don't die.

47
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:25,374
He just sleeping.
He had a sedative.

48
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:28,006
Ah, a sedative.

49
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,027
Excuse me, I'm here to escort
the Chipmunks home.

50
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:34,713
We are not leaving Dave.
I'm putting my paw down on this one.

51
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:36,071
You come here.

52
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,958
I got it! I'll fix it! No, made it worse.

53
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,192
Please, please go.

54
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,334
More stress you put on persistent
the longer will take him to recover.

55
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:53,392
You are too slow, nanny.

56
00:04:53,393 --> 00:05:01,970
You'll never hit me! I'm not going anywhere without Daaa.
...aaaydream believer, and a homecoming queen...

57
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:08,812
I hope for your sake
he stays asleep for the entire flight.

58
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:12,680
Maybe you should give him another shot.
Just to be sure.

59
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,929
Any ideas on how we gonna find aunt Jackie?

60
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,182
Follow me.

61
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,210
Excuse me. Sorry.

62
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,611
Excuse me, got you.

63
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:38,712
- Look, aunt Jackie! Aunt Jackie!
- Popcorn Jackie.

64
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:41,263
- Oh, come on dears.
- Yeah, we got you.

65
00:05:41,363 --> 00:05:43,625
- Popcorn!
- Who's sending to Theodore's?

66
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,921
Oh, there is a plenty for everyone.
Give a hug first.

67
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:49,568
Come over here, you old teddy bear.

68
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:52,258
I'm not really much of a hugger.

69
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,381
Oh, boys, I want you to meet someone.
This is my grandson Toby. Toby?

70
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,262
Hi, I'm Theodore.

71
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:01,872
- Toby?!
- What, what happened?

72
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:05,355
- The boys!
- Oh, hey! Hey, how are you? I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:08,835
Toby is living with me 'til he figures out
what he want to do with his life.

74
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,537
So far that means going beeoo-beeoo-beeoo
with his thumbs the all day.

75
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:17,975
For the record goin' beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with my thumbs
right now is keeping me in first place, and that's important.

76
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,911
- Toby get the bags.
- What bags?

77
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:24,708
- The lighters. Get the luggages.
- Oh, the lug, right. Let me get those...

78
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:29,630
- Toby!
- Get the brake! Get the brake!

79
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:37,396
I'm fine. Don't worry!

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,011
I'm so sorry, aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry.
Is she goin' to be ok?

81
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:50,002
Don't worry about me,
I will be home with no time.

82
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:53,265
I wouldn't be so sure.

83
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,026
It was an accident, I swear.

84
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:59,923
Been there, done that.
Several times.

85
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:02,334
I guess he will be taking care of us now?

86
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:05,222
I'll take frankly foster
of five hundred please-outs.

87
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:08,121
Ain't no problem. I can totally do this.

88
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:12,071
I mean, I took care of my cat...
until it ran away.

89
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:15,955
Well, 'ran away' is kind of strong wordin',
I think he just wanted his space.

90
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:19,427
I still see him around neighbourhood.

91
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:24,755
You know, he like hisses and claws at me. But I think
that's his way of saying we're still tight, you know.

92
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:29,853
You guys are nothing to worry about, seriously. 'Cause,
I'm not gonna be like Dave, you know, Dave is gone.

93
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:32,082
Gone?

94
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,616
Not gone, not gone gone.
He is not dead. He's very much alive.

95
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:38,900
He completely coming back. I'm just
gonna be in his room, keepin' his bed warm.

96
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:42,961
I'll be doin'my thing, you'll be doin' your thing.
I mean, you don't need to know that I'm there.

97
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:47,795
We supposed to know that you there,
that's the whole idea.

98
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:55,387
Yeah, ok absolutely. You know that I'm there, I'm just... I'm not
gonna be like: I know everything, and you do this, and you do that.

99
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,854
I mean that.

100
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:00,869
All right, let's do this.

101
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,136
Oh, boy!

102
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,396
Theodore, we gonna be just fine.

103
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,749
The important thing is... we're all still alive.

104
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,417
Well, maybe my "Get Well" card will
help Dave to come faster.

105
00:08:24,326 --> 00:08:27,400
It needs just a touch more glitter.

106
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,032
That should do it.
Who's hungry?

107
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:37,147
- Uh, uh me, me!
- Let's eat.

108
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:40,167
Nada. Find anything?

109
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,962
It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

110
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:46,419
Hello, the cheese balls are in the heat house.

111
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:18,274
Bingo. Dinner, she is aserved.

112
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,835
Hey, what are you doing in here?

113
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,450
A cheese ball?

114
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:27,233
Thumb boy, give me a second, real quick.

115
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:33,398
Alvin, I really need to focus, right now because
I'm one knockout away from my heavy weight title.

116
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,984
Can we play as well?

117
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:42,634
You know, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but else you don't
want see anyone get hurt and there gonna be fistsufferean flyin'.

118
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:44,302
We can play monopoly.

119
00:09:44,303 --> 00:09:46,682
We play monopoly with Dave all the time.

120
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:49,346
That sounds funny.
We should do that sometime right.

121
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:53,172
Now, I got to back and floatin' like
a butterfly and stinging like the bee.

122
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:59,172
Who needs Toby, Theodore, you got us.

123
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:03,296
Yeah, who needs Toby? Boys, right this way.

124
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:24,336
I'm gonna puke.

125
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:29,246
Do you know what Dave would
say if he were here right now?

126
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,072
But I think it means to come more from the belly.

127
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:42,507
Get together.
Be cool.

128
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:46,058
- Helllooooo?
- Boys, it's me.

129
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,568
Dave?

130
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:52,226
Well, I guess since you've answered the phone,
you haven't burned down the house yet.

131
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:54,458
- Have a little faith, Dave.
- Yes.

132
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,707
Mayday!

133
00:10:57,463 --> 00:11:01,210
- What was that?
- Don't stress him out.

134
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:06,843
- Oh, that was... Aunt Jackie.
- Yeah, she's making us a tasty five-course meal.

135
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:10,083
Really? Can I talk to her?

136
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:12,934
She's practising her pole dancing.

137
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:16,600
Pole dancing? But, what happened with making dinner.
Guys, what's going on?

138
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,228
- Gotta go, Dave.
- Alvin, I'm not kidding!

139
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:22,038
- Get better!
- Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

140
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,447
Yep, nobody does that better than him.

141
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:58,674
Toby, Toby wake up.

142
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:06,886
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay. What is it?

143
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:11,864
- I had a nightmare.
- Oh, the nightmares. I hate the nightmares.

144
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:12,913
What was it?

145
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:17,160
I dreamt that we didn't have a family anymore.

146
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:22,537
Theodore, that couldn't happen.
No, you guys are tight.

147
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:25,166
Nothing could ever separate you.

148
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:30,113
Less like an eagle swooped
down from the sky like caw-caaaw!

149
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:38,596
Which couldn't happen ever. Why would
you think that ever happened, you know...

150
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:41,408
The Eagles are in Philadelphia.

151
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,439
Sweet dreams.

152
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:54,782
- Toby, make it stop.
- What are you doing?

153
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:57,850
There is something wrong with the clock.
It won't shut up.

154
00:12:57,851 --> 00:13:00,254
I can't sleep.

155
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:04,873
That's the point.
It's an alarm clock.

156
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:07,464
It helps you wake up early in the morning.

157
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:09,722
Why anyone wanna wake up early?

158
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,683
For the school, you got to be there by eight.

159
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:16,023
- In the morning?
- Look, I don't like any others early anything more than you do.

160
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:22,158
But we are in this together, Alvin. Soon you get
to school, soon I get to compound and get back to sleep.

161
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,585
- You mean you don't stayin' with us in school?
- No, no, no.

162
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,690
I've done my time making very much.

163
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:33,796
- But school is fun, right?
- Fun? Well, I guess Maybe, it's... fun-ish..

164
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,326
Hey, it's my cat!

165
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,378
Hey kiddy it's me, remember?

166
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,879
I treated you good.

167
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:10,897
There, here we go.

168
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:15,551
Enjoy your first day in school.
See you around three-ish.

169
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:26,517
We got it. This got to be a walk in the park.

170
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,183
I'm frightening.

171
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:34,500
Hi, I'm Theodore.

172
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:38,367
Hi, I'm Theodore.

173
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:48,809
- Eagle.
- Go eagle!

174
00:14:56,346 --> 00:14:59,321
That wasn't very fun-ish.

175
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:04,403
You must be our new students.
I'm Dr Rubin, the principal.

176
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,670
And we are the Chipmunks.

177
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:10,627
Yeah, that will explain the fur and booshy tales.

178
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:13,300
- Follow me, gentlemen.
- Gentlemen?

179
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:15,870
Oh, us. Right.

180
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:18,425
There was a minute left and
we were down by two...

181
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:22,024
And I mind couch: I don't care if my
leg is broken, put me in, I can win this...

182
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,602
I never get tired of that story.

183
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:26,977
So I hobbled out barely able to stand...

184
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:29,362
Did I mention my leg was broken?

185
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:31,666
- Mrs. Ortega?
- Yes?

186
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:34,189
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

187
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:38,965
- Well guys, welcome to home room.
- Good to be here, I hope.

188
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:40,815
So this is a classroom?

189
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:44,608
I love the smell of zit cream in the morning.

190
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,455
Hello ladies.

191
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:57,115
Hi, I'm Theodore. Hi, I'm Theodore.

192
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:00,247
Yes, he's Theodore in case you missed it.

193
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:02,006
And I am Simon.

194
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:06,313
My name Seville, Alvin Seville.

195
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:09,633
Enchantée... mademoiselle.

196
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:15,164
Somebody's have to knock these guys down to size.

197
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:18,678
That should be pretty easy, really.
They are only eight inches tall.

198
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:49,723
I had 15 cars. I mean that's like
five more cars than anybody really needs.

199
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,539
I had seven maids.
Courtside seats to the Lakers.

200
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:59,733
Even my maids had courstside seats to the Lakers.

201
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:02,756
Now, look at me.

202
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:05,566
Look at me.
I lost everything.

203
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:09,193
Except for my dignity,
they can't take that away from me.

204
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,690
And it's all because of them.

205
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:18,580
Oh, hey ...crackers.

206
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,846
Now run around, hoping and praying
that I could find other animals that can...

207
00:17:22,946 --> 00:17:25,275
sing or dance.

208
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,694
Wait a second, you don't sing, do you?

209
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:33,939
Hey, hey that's my muffin.
Give me my muffin! You dirty rat.

210
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:40,910
I will get you Chimpmunks.

211
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,682
Girls, we have to get out of here.

212
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,516
I can't see.

213
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,068
- My nose.
- That's my tail! - Sorry.

214
00:17:57,168 --> 00:18:01,066
- Move your ass.
- Ok. Stop pushing me.

215
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,576
- We made it. - Jets Records!
- Phew!

216
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:14,900
Oh, my gosh. It's him! Ian Hawke!

217
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:17,244
Mr Hawke?

218
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:21,169
That voice! I can't get it out of my head!

219
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,329
Hello, Mr Hawke?

220
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,615
That not in my head, that's really happening.

221
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:31,031
- What do you want?
- We want to introduce ourselves.

222
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:35,459
That's right.
I'm Brittany. And this is my sister Eleanor.

223
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,427
Hello, sir. Such a pleasure to meet you!

224
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:42,746
And I'm their sister Jeanette. Although
I feel more like an Olivia or sometimes...

225
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,890
Anyway, we are the Chipmunk girls.

226
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,823
We will be just so honored
to have you to represent us.

227
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:51,813
You made Alvin and the Chipmunk stars.

228
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:53,609
We wanna be stars too, yeah!

229
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:56,490
And hangin' out with the Chipmunks.

230
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:01,025
Ok, now listen before we get all girly and giggly
about this, just tell me one thing...

231
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,192
You can sing, right?

232
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,359
Hang on, not here.

233
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,074
Why not we take this meeting upstairs
in my penthouse office?

234
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:18,802
This is so exciting.

235
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:23,635
Oh, my gosh, can you believe it?

236
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:26,873
My first penthouse office!

237
00:19:30,446 --> 00:19:32,953
Oh, my... the Hollywood sign!

238
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,889
I thought you might like the view!

239
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,139
Ladies, tell me little
something about yourselves.

240
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,953
We grew up in a small town,
population 300 and...

241
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:44,757
Really? That's fascinating. Great!

242
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:47,148
All right, impress me!

243
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,300
One, two, three.

00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:27,895
Girls, girls, girls.

251
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:32,429
Guess who just became the number one
Chipmunks' band in whole dang world?

252
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,034
Ian Hawke.

253
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,603
So, when can we meet the Chipmunks?

254
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:44,296
That's an excellent question
and the excellent answer is...

255
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:48,303
I don't really represent
Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

256
00:20:48,304 --> 00:20:51,618
- Oh, no. Wha-what happened?
- Oh, classic tale.

257
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,431
Sweet and innocent when I met them,
they had nothing ...and then I work my butt of

258
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:57,436
to make them rock stars and...

259
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,336
They changed.
Turned out to be like bad cheese.

260
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:05,803
- No.
- That's terrible.

261
00:21:05,804 --> 00:21:10,045
I know. I mean, I treated
Alvin like my own son, you know.

262
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:13,170
And he just goes and spits on me.

263
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:17,916
Literally. He filled his chipmunk's
cheeks with saliva and just had at it.

264
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:23,216
- Don't even get me started about Simon.
- But not Theodore, right?

265
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:26,249
It's the cuddly ones you have to watch for.

266
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,216
But why we are talkin' about them for, c'mon?
They are over, fired, nobledeute (noble death)...

267
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:32,722
Chipmunks' stupid sayin'.

268
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:35,526
But...

269
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:40,844
Girl Chipmunks' stupid sayin'...
Fasten your seat belts!

270
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:48,101
So I eyed Jay Z's eyes right, and I said:
Jay, where is Beyonce?

271
00:21:48,102 --> 00:21:50,809
And he says: She's holding a plate
full of cheese balls, turn around...

272
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,867
And guess what..

273
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:56,939
- She was.
- PS, Dave left me in charge.

274
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,600
We stay up to ten every night.

275
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:03,307
Look what I can do.

276
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:07,003
You're Theadorable.

277
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:14,386
- I am so sorry.
- That's cool. No harm done.

278
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:18,304
Not yet.
Girls, please, private conference.

279
00:22:19,143 --> 00:22:21,480
Thank you.

280
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:28,099
Listen up, rock stars.

281
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,086
If you talk to those girls again
you're dead.

282
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:34,087
If you look at those girls again
you're dead.

283
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:37,851
If you even think about those girls...

284
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:41,439
- Are you thinking about them?
- Well, I am now.

285
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,620
- That's it.
- You are dead!

286
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:49,234
Get them, c'mon! Crack you, you dirty rats!

287
00:22:52,197 --> 00:22:54,565
Scatter!

288
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:57,792
- That way. Over there!
- I'm runin'.

289
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:03,170
Hey Dumbo, catch me if you can.

290
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:09,099
- You are dead!
- Not!

291
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:11,973
It's stretching time!

292
00:23:21,345 --> 00:23:23,869
Oh, boy.

293
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,933
Eagle.

294
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:29,477
- Eagle! Eagle!
- Get him.

295
00:23:29,478 --> 00:23:32,201
- Move! Move!
- This way.

296
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,238
- Gotcha.
- Wait, wait, come up...

297
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,618
- It's swirley time.
- C'mon, c'mon guys, this is not so...

298
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:41,276
Please, please!

299
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:47,123
- That's a good look for you!
- Thank you.

300
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:52,340
- I can't swim. Help.
- Grab on Simon!

301
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:00,643
You okay?

302
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:04,397
Well, uh, considering that you just saved me
from drowning in a toilet...

303
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:06,777
I'm, uh, pretty good.

304
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,888
I'll be right back.

305
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:11,394
Alvin, Alvin!
We're not gonna solve anything with violence!

306
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:13,498
- It's the fatty ratty.
- Cut it out!

307
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:17,486
- This rat has serious junk in the trunk.
- Yeah, little fatty.

308
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:27,927
Simon, does this make my butt look smaller?

309
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:31,440
Theodore, your butt looks fine.
Those guys are just some jerks.

310
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:45,220
You threatened to climb inside of him
and build a nest.

311
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:49,583
That was out of line and not even sure
that is physically impossible.

312
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:55,305
- I should suspend all three of you.
- Please do.

313
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:06,143
Instead I have the better idea.

314
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:12,058
Due to budget cutbacks, we are in jeopardy
of loosing our beloved music program.

315
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,936
- That's awful.
- I know.

316
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:16,504
But, there is one small ray of hope.

317
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,969
Every year the District
sponsors a music competition...

318
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,638
And the winner school receives 25,000 dolars.

319
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:25,951
If we win, we can save our program.

320
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:28,659
And you want us to perform?

321
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,687
I begin to think that you are a fan?

322
00:25:31,688 --> 00:25:35,591
Why don't you sleep on it.

323
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:39,085
- Wait.
- Great.

324
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:42,289
Promise me that you won't say anything.

325
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,678
The principal has a certain image to uphold.
If Mr Fencle ever finds out about this ta...

326
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:53,216
I just can't believe this, that you are actually
sitting in my office. I have all of your CDs.

327
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:57,039
I even went to see you last year in Denver.
That's where I got this.

328
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:00,227
It was my birthday.
And I was like... Oh, the Chipmunks!

329
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:07,330
So, what you say?
Will you represent our school?

330
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,875
Honestly suspension sounds pretty good to me.

331
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:16,330
Come on Alvin?
One for all, and three for one.

332
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:19,531
Well put, Theodore. Very well put.
Count us in.

333
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:22,571
Go Eagles!

334
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:25,593
Eagles? Where?

335
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:30,798
Ah, the penthouse limo.

336
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,119
Très exclusivo.

337
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:40,094
Hey, isn't that that Chihuahua?
Ya know, from the movie?

338
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,713
Uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, of course it is.
Yeah, a lot of big names live here.

339
00:26:45,714 --> 00:26:48,629
- Oh. Como esta?
- I must have his autograph!

340
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,013
Whoa, whoa, Brittany. You
wanna be a star, act like a star.

341
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:56,091
- You don't get autographs, you give 'em.
- Oh, right.

342
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:01,294
Hey, look over there, there's
a couple of the Jonas Brothers.

343
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:04,017
- Where? I don't see them.
- Here we are.

344
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:09,106
Ok, let's scootin' to my apartment...

345
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:12,976
What? Did I... Oh, darn it! Darn it to heck!

346
00:27:12,977 --> 00:27:15,425
- What? What's wrong?
- Girls, I apologise but...

347
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,869
I seem to left my keys back in my office.

348
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,575
What if one of you shroud through that mail
slot and open it up for me from the inside?

349
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:26,021
I'll do it.

350
00:27:28,408 --> 00:27:31,014
I'm stuck.

351
00:27:32,462 --> 00:27:34,627
All right, I got you, I got you!

352
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,983
Not so hard.

353
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:43,395
I wanna lay off the nuts.

354
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:46,312
All right, how about you, glasses?
You are in better shape. Wanna go?

355
00:27:46,314 --> 00:27:49,991
- Well I'm not that good in things like this.
- I got it!

356
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:01,363
Impressive!

357
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:03,480
Gee, Willakers!

358
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:08,287
Great. Bingo! This is the best treehouse ever!

359
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,683
A red piano.

360
00:28:10,684 --> 00:28:14,320
- Is this a dream?
- Stand by and catch me.

361
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:19,078
- It's much better than a tree!
- I just adore a penthouse view!

362
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:22,066
Nice one, Hawke.

363
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,751
- You like it?
- Sure, Ian.

364
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:27,869
- I live here.
- It's so beautiful.

365
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,404
The last time we visited Meerkat Manor...

366
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:35,710
Arrival group called the Commanders...

367
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:39,445
was making large indoors
in to the Whiskers' teritory.

368
00:28:45,383 --> 00:28:50,562
Toby, I thought I was messy,
but this is really disgusting.

369
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,581
I feel like livin' in a dumpster.

370
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:56,644
Simon, it's Meerkat Manor on it. Watch with me.

371
00:28:57,395 --> 00:29:02,161
You're right. I thik I'll relax,
feelin' my nerves little bit...

372
00:29:02,162 --> 00:29:05,146
What is this?

373
00:29:05,147 --> 00:29:08,092
You got to be joking? A taco.

374
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:10,764
In a blanket? Toby!

375
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:17,228
Ladies and gentlemen, goin' for his turkey
is the Tobster.

376
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:22,183
Come on baby.

377
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:31,656
No problem.
Watch and learn, my friends.

378
00:29:32,244 --> 00:29:39,351
Oops, broken TV, I think this is the time
to play my second favorite game.

379
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:42,202
Hide the broken TV from Dave.
You wanna play?

380
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,494
- No!!!
- Go easy on him, Taco Boy.

381
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:47,806
This day has been bad enough already.

382
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,078
Oh, I think I see what's going on.

383
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,532
- You guys are having some problems at school.
- No, not really...

384
00:29:57,533 --> 00:30:01,422
Unless you consider, having your head
dumped in public toilet, a problem...

385
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:06,893
Squirrelees are the worst.

386
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:08,969
At least, that's what I heard.

387
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,325
Because, there is no way that I
possibly know that, on a personal level.

388
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,796
Toby, what was school like for you?

389
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:57,473
- Toby? Tobyyy!!!
- What?

390
00:30:57,507 --> 00:31:00,182
What was school like for me? In a word?

391
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:05,404
Awesome!
But, you know that 'cause I was like...

392
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,863
Extremely popular.

393
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:12,907
- Is that why you are still live with your grandmother?
- And refer to yourself as Tobster?

394
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:15,707
And go peeoo-peeoo-peeoo all day?

395
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,557
Bed time.

396
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:30,309
Alvin! Alvin wake up and turn off the alarm.

397
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:40,020
Alvin, I'm not kidding. I'm
not kidding, buddy, turn it off!

398
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:42,545
Guys, guys...

399
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,278
Boys, this isn't funny.

400
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,579
Hello? I need help.

401
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,763
A man got us.
He wants to take us to eternal place.

402
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:01,151
- School.
- Howgh! - Have a heart.

403
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,488
Have a heart. Dave wants you to school,
so you are goin'.

404
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,343
Don't worry about taking us three, Toby.
We gonna be all right.

405
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:11,682
- If it hurts?
- Guys, come on.

406
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:15,110
Trust me, the second day is
never as bad as the first.

407
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:23,974
Glasses! Glasses!
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would y...

408
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:27,516
Right in the pancreas.

409
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:35,480
Nurse?

410
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:42,030
C'mon, Alvin! Remember the five D's!
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!

411
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:44,903
You're next, furball.

412
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:47,570
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me?

413
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:51,448
I'm the only one here,
so you must be talkin' to me.

414
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:01,806
- Did you see that?
- Hallelujah!

415
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:04,591
Unbelievable, he caught it.
You're out, man.

416
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:08,603
And the tackle made, she got's in.

417
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:12,409
- He got hands.
- I think that's paws actually.

418
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,181
We can definitely use him on the team.

419
00:33:15,182 --> 00:33:18,928
Hey, furball, how would you like a spot
in the football team?

420
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,941
- Football? Moi?
- I got to say you're good.

421
00:33:21,943 --> 00:33:24,378
I'm gonna let you hangin' out with us at lunch.

422
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:27,952
That is, if you wanna be on the team?

423
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:30,358
- Interesting proposition.
- Alvin?

424
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,737
- Maybe I'll get back to you on that.
- This is a one-time offer.

425
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:36,625
Don't take too long and think it over.

426
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:39,466
Great, but I will dish my brothers!

427
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:43,643
Just to become the first chipmunk ever to
play an actual pose on a football team.

428
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:46,452
No chance.

429
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:50,002
The stadium is unanimous.

430
00:33:50,003 --> 00:33:55,225
It stots and goes, it's out, it's out...
and he catches it!

431
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:57,546
The crowd goes crazy.

432
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:04,125
Me?

433
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:12,175
I think that super cool jock table
is paging you.

434
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,494
Why would I go over there?

435
00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:17,290
Look, if I really need
to worry about being popular.

436
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:21,242
Hello, talking Chipmunk.
World-famous rock star...

437
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:25,224
Dive with his own flesh doll.
Guys, I'm on pajamas.

438
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:28,879
Not to toot my own horn bike.

439
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:33,724
Come on, it's delectable.

440
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:36,575
- Just go, Alvin.
- Really? You really mean it?

441
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:39,665
- Yeah.
- Thanks. I'll be right back.

442
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,073
- What's up, geeks?
- What's up, man?

443
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:48,110
Bring it.

444
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:59,673
I got it, I got it I...

445
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:02,533
Not.

446
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:05,230
- I think he's cute.
- Me too.

447
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:09,661
Toss.

448
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:16,428
Call me.

449
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:20,953
I'm tellin' you, Chipmunks are old news.
I got the next big thing.

450
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:24,441
Singing female Chipmunks.

451
00:35:27,656 --> 00:35:32,810
God, what part of singing female chipmunks
some of this people do not understand...

452
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:39,656
Girls, we are goin' to school.

453
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:43,487
He's up, and he scores.

454
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:50,285
Hey, right up, ass? Wow,
don't hate on a high five?

455
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:53,288
Yeah, high five.

456
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:58,040
Look Alvin, I know you've guys been busy with
your sporting gathers and what not...

457
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:01,884
- But I can really use your help at home.
- Oh, no can do.

458
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:05,149
Ryan is gonna teach me how
to get pretty girls to do my homework.

459
00:36:06,672 --> 00:36:09,877
Alvin, you promised Theodore we hang out.

460
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,276
We are watching Meerkat Manor tonight.
No pretty girls.

461
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:17,441
- Dude, I can't swing it today.
- That's what you say every day, Alvin.

462
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,880
Not to remind you it's
your day to do the laundry.

463
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:23,941
Better listen to your daddy, Alvin.
You don't wanna get grounded?

464
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:30,786
- Are you going to pick that up?
- Are you going to make me?

465
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:35,772
Au contraire, mon frère! I'm just
going to elegantly show you how it's done.

466
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:44,134
Off the glass.
And you call yourself a jar.

467
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:53,016
My brother, he's a real jokester.
Always do.

468
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:56,048
I'll see you guys around.

469
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,154
- That's my play.
- That's my play.

470
00:37:00,155 --> 00:37:04,042
Why are you tryin' to embarrass
me in front of my friends?

471
00:37:04,043 --> 00:37:07,055
Are you kidding me?
They are the ones which should be embarrassed by.

472
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:10,016
- Good luck with the show, guys.
- First row seats. Can't wait!

473
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:12,274
So, which song are we gonna sing?

474
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:15,249
No pressure, but the whole school
is counting on us.

475
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,306
Oh, relax! It's like Ryan said:
Who's gonna beat singing chipmunks?

476
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:49,043
Finally. Oh, Simon is dreamy.

477
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:52,099
- I think Theodore was looking at me!
- Yeah, I know.

478
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,809
But guys remember what Ian said?
We can't trust them.

479
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:20,406
- What happened?
- I never thought I'd say this but...

480
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:25,062
- Pink is my new favourite colour.
- Her glasses were quite fetching.

481
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:28,219
She's like a beautiful green gumdrop.

482
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:32,314
If you guys want to do this
you got to pay attention.

483
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:35,957
- Maybe, this is a good time for us to take a break.
- Good call, take five.

484
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:40,213
She's right. We need to focus.

485
00:38:40,215 --> 00:38:43,009
This is for my screen saver.

486
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,672
- Hey buzz!
- Hey guys? Are you guys ready to go?

487
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,729
'Cause I've got a lot of important staff
to do at home.

488
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:54,751
- You must be their guardian?
- God, that I am. Yes I am.

489
00:38:54,787 --> 00:38:59,056
Hi. How are you, Dr Rubin? I know that
because I went to school here a few years ago.

490
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:03,935
I don't know if you remember me,
Toby Seville probably not...

491
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:10,393
Toby? No way? Hi! Hey, no braces.

492
00:39:10,394 --> 00:39:15,073
- I think it's great.
- I did...

493
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:18,773
I did get the braces off, 'cause they were just...

494
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:36,393
I know a guy who actually works on drum heads.
I'll be in the car, guys.

495
00:39:39,217 --> 00:39:40,936
Somebody is in love.

496
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:44,787
We are going to replace everything.
Chipmunks' honor.

497
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:48,566
The old false modestly suck up routine.

498
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:52,580
- I thought I smelled a rat.
- May I help you Mr Hawke?

499
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:56,363
I was wondering if I could help you,
I just heard about your musical competition...

500
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:59,544
and I just get down here as quickly as I could
to volunteer my girls.

501
00:39:59,545 --> 00:40:03,618
That's very thoughtful of you,
but I've already made up my mind.

502
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:07,574
Perhaps this will change your mind.

503
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:09,500
Girls.

504
00:40:10,714 --> 00:40:14,107
They are with Ian?

505
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:19,603
One, two, one, two...

Good people of West Eastman, you have
just witnessed the debut...

526
00:41:28,668 --> 00:41:31,589
Of the Chipettes!

527
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,615
Thank you!

528
00:41:34,632 --> 00:41:39,226
- Well?
- They were splendid. But as I said before...

529
00:41:39,227 --> 00:41:43,025
I have made my decision.

530
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:47,495
I see.
You've made your decision.

531
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,982
I don't need to speak out of school doctor,
but in the true spirit of democracy...

532
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:58,550
which our great wonderful country was
founded upon...

533
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:01,751
I say, let the people vote.

534
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:07,347
Let them choose.
One person, one vote, I say, let us vote!

535
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:10,665
Let us vote.

536
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:13,708
Let us vote.

537
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:17,173
Please don't be a flasher granby...

538
00:42:17,174 --> 00:42:19,523
let them sing.

539
00:42:19,524 --> 00:42:22,131
Let us vote.

540
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:27,549
You make a persuasive case, Mr Hawke.

541
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,764
All right, here is what I'm going to do.

542
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:36,349
This friday, each group will perform
one song in front of the student body.

543
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:40,233
Whoever gets the most applause, well,
will represent the school.

544
00:42:40,235 --> 00:42:41,915
What?

545
00:42:42,662 --> 00:42:46,546
Thank you. We made it.

546
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:49,263
Oh, it is on, like Donkey Kong!

547
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:55,178
The Meerkats huddle together, at
the end of a dramatic day...

548
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:57,919
to reaffirm their family bond.

549
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,992
The whiskers are going to have
to rely on each other more than ever.

550
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:06,226
Guys, I'm so happy that Mrs Ortega
can rehearsal with us every day after school.

551
00:43:06,227 --> 00:43:10,539
- Wow! Every day?
- Stop right there, ok!

552
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,783
We are the team, we need you.

553
00:43:13,784 --> 00:43:16,713
Would you relax? We are not going to lose.

554
00:43:16,714 --> 00:43:19,357
We'll talk about this in the morning.

555
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,890
Not much to talk about.
I will see you at the rehearsal.

556
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,581
- Stop huggin'.
- I am not huggin'.

557
00:43:27,582 --> 00:43:33,152
You might as well be really obstacles in the
face countryside because you are in fact huggin'.

558
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:37,462
- I'm not.
- I saw, and saw...

559
00:43:37,463 --> 00:43:40,095
I think I will sleep in my own bed tonight.

560
00:43:40,096 --> 00:43:42,984
You know for me, I'm so glad I'm not a meerkat.

561
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:47,350
- Oh, really? And why is that?
- I would never hug with you!

562
00:44:00,465 --> 00:44:04,390
Toby, can I sleep with you?

563
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:10,605
- What?
- Be kind to me.

564
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,449
My brothers are fighting.

565
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:18,795
What? Geeeee... ok.

566
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,266
Man, Dutch Oven!

567
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:36,898
Not the Dutch Oven!
Anything but the Dutch Oven! I can't breath!

568
00:44:38,254 --> 00:44:41,432
It's to late! It burns! It burns!

569
00:45:04,508 --> 00:45:07,963
Now, let's see. What else am I in the mood for?

570
00:45:07,965 --> 00:45:11,540
How about a side order of
friendly advice, courtesy of me?

571
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,739
No, thanks.

572
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,865
Grapes, please.

573
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:22,925
Heh, heh. Excuse me. Ahem. So, uh, well,
I, I, I just wanted to warn you... about Ian.

574
00:45:22,926 --> 00:45:25,502
What?

575
00:45:25,503 --> 00:45:30,596
You should be grateful to him. He did everything
for you, Alvin, and you broke his heart.

576
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:33,837
Hmm, really. How do I put this gently!

577
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:36,491
He's the devil,
he doesn't have a heart,

578
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:40,203
and one of the things he did for us
was put us in a cage!

579
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:45,283
- Oh, Alvin, he would never do that.
- Yeah, guess, you were there, I forgot...

580
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,211
- You, you'd better watch out.
- I don't need any advice from you.

581
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:52,163
- But...
- But, nothing, Alvin! Ian's taking us straight to the tooooooopppp!

582
00:45:55,524 --> 00:45:58,553
Right, straight to the top. I got it.

583
00:45:58,554 --> 00:46:01,820
Yeah, funny. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

584
00:46:06,712 --> 00:46:09,762
Hah, hah we are, so, going
to destroy those Chipmunks!

585
00:46:09,763 --> 00:46:13,278
- I don't want to destroy them.
- Me neither. I just want to hang out with them.

586
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:17,230
All right, look. If you feel that way...

587
00:46:17,231 --> 00:46:20,731
- Maybe we should just withdraw from the contest.
- What?!

588
00:46:20,732 --> 00:46:24,247
I'll put you all in Fedex package and mail you
back to whatever tree you came from.

589
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:27,952
Sounds good? Ok then.
Take room from the top. Let's go!

590
00:46:31,384 --> 00:46:35,377
Wow, wow stop.
Short one in a green dress...

591
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:37,178
- What's your name again?
- Eleanor.

592
00:46:37,179 --> 00:46:40,801
Yeah, look. I'm losin' you there, you know.
Have you always been that short?

593
00:46:40,802 --> 00:46:44,160
- I guess.
- You've got to work on that.

594
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:47,391
Ok, all right. Let me try somethin' here.

595
00:46:47,392 --> 00:46:50,642
Brittany, here. Come up here.
No, you two stay back.

596
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:54,678
A little further.

597
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:57,118
Oh, yeah! Now that I like!

598
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,942
It's not just because Brittany is more
than mega-ultra superstar than you guys.

599
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:06,254
Good, good. Ok, you know what, let's get a
little more separation. Brittany, stay there.

600
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:11,342
Get a little more separation from you guys.
Give her some room! Give her some room, guys.

601
00:47:11,376 --> 00:47:15,138
All right. Watch me now.

602
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:18,792
One, two, three... Watch me.
Watch me now.

603
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:31,486
- Hello?
- Toby?

604
00:47:31,487 --> 00:47:34,698
What are you doing in the house?
Where is Aunt Jacky?

605
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:39,636
Dave, hey Dave, what's happenin'?

606
00:47:40,982 --> 00:47:46,053
Aunt Jacky is in the hospital.

607
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:51,739
I am a little worried.
Who's watcin' the boys?

608
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:55,342
I am.

609
00:47:56,201 --> 00:48:00,097
- So, Dave, how is Paris?
- Wait, are the boys behaving?

610
00:48:00,098 --> 00:48:02,879
Absolutely. They've been just pitchy.

611
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:07,252
- Toby, what's going on?
- Nothing. Don't even worry about it.

612
00:48:07,253 --> 00:48:10,641
You know, I know that you're
not suppose to be stress down.

613
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:14,843
So I'm gonna go right now, but it's all good here.
Come home soon. Bye.

614
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:22,460
Nurse, get me out of here!

615
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:25,812
Help...

616
00:48:25,813 --> 00:48:31,106
I don't mean to interrupt your game but I
saw you stand up to Ryan when he littered...

617
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:33,082
- That's to guts.
- Really?

618
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:37,130
That's the kind of guy we are looking for.
Jeremy Smith, Student body president.

619
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:39,632
- How do you do, I am...
- International recording star...

620
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:43,274
- And litter monitor Simon Seville.
- Litter monitor?

621
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:45,863
Litter monitor,
it's a new position that we've created,

622
00:48:45,864 --> 00:48:49,350
to help raise awareness to the presssing problem
in our society.

623
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:53,213
I agree 99% plus 1.

624
00:48:53,214 --> 00:48:55,444
You did the math.

625
00:48:55,445 --> 00:48:58,459
Simon, I know this is a lot to ask...

626
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:04,513
We are lookin' for a take-charge guy who
take charge of this very rewarding position.

627
00:49:04,514 --> 00:49:07,289
What do you say?

628
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:10,131
Excuse me, everybody.
Quick announcement.

629
00:49:10,132 --> 00:49:13,958
I'm Simon, I am the Litter monitor.
Put your trash in a garbage can. He's out.

630
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:21,493
Hello, ladies. You are probably unaware
that you've thrown a racker on the ground, so...

631
00:49:21,494 --> 00:49:24,116
We gonna just call this morning warning.

632
00:49:25,685 --> 00:49:27,933
Carry on.

633
00:49:27,935 --> 00:49:30,419
- Right up, dudes?
- What up, pal!

634
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:35,065
Hey, everybody! Check it out.
The newest member of the football team.

635
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:39,961
- Soon enough for his first away game.
- Guys, don't mess with me.

636
00:49:39,962 --> 00:49:42,612
I talked to couch.
You are in.

637
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:45,725
- That's great. Awesome.
- So, check it out, hey man...

638
00:49:45,726 --> 00:49:47,618
We are watchin' the new litter monitor.

639
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,011
I even wasn't aware that school even had
a litter monitor.

640
00:49:51,012 --> 00:49:53,735
It don't but don't tell him that.

641
00:49:55,778 --> 00:49:58,611
- Are you goin' to pick it up?
- No.

642
00:49:58,612 --> 00:50:04,713
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
I guess I'm going to have to, anyway a tuition.

643
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:11,379
No, I got a suition from littery.

644
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh, you wanna play that game, do you?
Guess what, I can play that game all day long.

645
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,700
Simon!

646
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,778
It's a joke, dude.

647
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:21,379
Litter is no joking matter.

648
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,324
You're the joke.
We are messing with you.

649
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:26,778
There is no such a thing as Litter monitor.

650
00:50:26,779 --> 00:50:29,248
What?
Big liar, huh!

651
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,549
You knew about this, Alvin?
Spelling "brother" mean anything to you?

652
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,911
Yes, of course.

653
00:50:36,912 --> 00:50:40,049
Well, yes he has some new brothers
now he is on football team.

654
00:50:41,782 --> 00:50:45,515
You still hadn't pick up that litter.

655
00:50:45,516 --> 00:50:47,284
Want me to get rid of litter?

656
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:50,518
- Let's start with you.
- Hey, let go, let go. Noooo!!

657
00:50:52,974 --> 00:50:55,456
Touch down.

658
00:50:58,277 --> 00:51:00,851
I'll catch with you guys in a second.

659
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,792
Ok, I'm a total jerk, I admit.

660
00:51:13,793 --> 00:51:16,645
So are we cool now?

661
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:31,730
Ok, I'm going to put this behind us...

662
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:33,743
- For Theodore's sake.
- I know.

663
00:51:33,744 --> 00:51:35,586
That's why I'm giving you my...

664
00:51:35,587 --> 00:51:39,731
The Alvin currency that I will be on
that stage Friday night.

665
00:51:40,062 --> 00:51:42,414
Wait, wait, wait!
Why woudn't you be there?

666
00:51:42,415 --> 00:51:46,870
Because I had a...

667
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:50,046
- What?
- I...

668
00:51:50,047 --> 00:51:53,538
- You have a what?
- A socker ball game. Now I said it.

669
00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:56,434
A football game.

670
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:07,260
- Simon, Alvin is everything alrigt?
- Theodore. Hello!

671
00:52:07,261 --> 00:52:11,297
Yes, we are fine.
Just a little dumpster wrestling.

672
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:14,102
- It's crazy in here.
- Right.

673
00:52:17,624 --> 00:52:21,243
Don't worry Theo, everything is gonna be fine.

674
00:52:21,244 --> 00:52:25,863
- Alvin, do not miss that Sing all.
- Don't worry, Simon.

675
00:52:25,864 --> 00:52:29,112
I'll be there. I can prove.

676
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:32,482
Hey guys, thanks so much for helping out today.

677
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:37,293
"Toys for Tots" is a really cool organization.
So, everybody is gettin' cool points today.

678
00:52:39,488 --> 00:52:42,336
- What's goin' with Theodore?
- I have no idea.

679
00:52:47,963 --> 00:52:51,352
- Hey Eleanor, why don't you see if Theodore needs some help?
- Ok.

680
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:14,972
- They don't look very comfortable.
- My shoes?

681
00:53:14,973 --> 00:53:19,896
- They are not.
- But Ian says that I need to work on being higher.

682
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:24,645
Well... I think you look
great just the way you are.

683
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:28,926
You do?

684
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:40,219
Hi, you've reached Dave Seville,
please leave a message.

685
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:44,665
Hi, Toby.
This is Julie Ortega, we talked yesterday...

686
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:49,250
a sort of it.
Anyway, the reason I'm calling,

687
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:54,056
is that I am worried about Theodore,
he's been acting a little down lately.

688
00:53:54,057 --> 00:53:57,546
I hope you are going to the "Sing All" Friday.

689
00:53:57,547 --> 00:54:01,027
You know in his down,
Theodore needs all the support he can get.

690
00:54:01,127 --> 00:54:08,286
So, I'll see you there.
I hope we get a chance to talk. Bye.

691
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:18,608
<i>Ok, folks. Time to
get behind your Warriors...</i>

692
00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:23,079
<i>They are listening Eagles down by five,
with only thirty seconds left on the game.</i>

693
00:54:23,081 --> 00:54:28,118
<i>- Time is running out for the...
- ...He really needs to make a move here or...</i>

694
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:31,286
<i>This game is over.
- I know, put me in.</i>

695
00:54:31,287 --> 00:54:33,847
Hey, put me in.

696
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:40,430
<i>- Time out, Time out.
- Time out Eagles.</i>

697
00:54:40,431 --> 00:54:43,415
<i>Number 15 got nine seconds
to make it to the game.</i>

698
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:52,622
All right boys, it's time for the big A.

699
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:57,130
I'm going to crush them and burn them to pain.
The Alvinator is in the house.

700
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:58,443
Are you sure about this?

701
00:54:58,444 --> 00:55:00,676
Four to ten say that we need to go
for the secret weapon.

702
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:03,760
Chip is right.
He left decision on me.

703
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:07,045
Time to make history, boys.

704
00:55:14,842 --> 00:55:18,395
I'm taking you down, Jennifer.

705
00:55:18,396 --> 00:55:21,171
You are the one going down, rat face.

706
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:24,677
I'm going to crack you like an acorn
and eat you for dinner.

707
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:27,644
With some fava beans and a nice chianti.

708
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:32,807
Is this something about my father?

709
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:36,108
One, two...

710
00:55:44,865 --> 00:55:47,776
I'm comin'!

711
00:55:56,445 --> 00:56:00,747
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Don't hate the pain, hate the game.

712
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:03,479
I love the hunt, man.

713
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,283
<i>Final score: Eagles 15. The Warriors 14.</i>

714
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:12,313
What you think about that, sucker?

715
00:56:12,315 --> 00:56:15,713
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You're really muscle chipmunk.

716
00:56:15,714 --> 00:56:20,415
Give me a A, give me an O,
give me a W, give me an E, give me a M...

717
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:23,312
How that spell... awesome.

718
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:26,223
I am the king of the world.

719
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,397
Party with Alvin.

720
00:56:29,398 --> 00:56:32,036
Everybody to the beach house.

721
00:56:32,037 --> 00:56:34,358
Let's do it.

722
00:56:40,759 --> 00:56:44,273
Look guys,
I just want you to know that I'm here for you.

723
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:48,734
There is plenty of time. I'm gonna go find Alvin.
Everything is gonna work out.

724
00:56:49,257 --> 00:56:54,217
<i>- Thank you, Toby.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Rubin.</i>

725
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,712
<i>Thank you, students. Thank you.</i>

726
00:56:58,714 --> 00:57:01,904
Welcome to our exiciting
"Sing All" Competition...

727
00:57:01,905 --> 00:57:05,097
Between the Chipmunks
and the Chipettes.

728
00:57:09,169 --> 00:57:13,373
Remember students, there
are no winners or losers.

729
00:57:13,374 --> 00:57:16,874
Remind me to tell the Chipmunks that one,
when we blow up off the stage.

730
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:21,857
...To our school, a chance to win 25000 dollars
to save our music department.

731
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:25,973
So, without further due,
I give you... the Chipettes.

732
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,255
This is it girls, can you believe it.

733
00:57:31,256 --> 00:57:34,586
Brittany, your time to shine baby.

734
00:57:34,587 --> 00:57:38,250
- Go up there and knock them dead.
- Yes sir, I can do it.

735
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:43,810

And now, let teared for the group that

754

students have told me.

755
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:20,471
Here they are... the Chipmunks.

756
00:59:21,898 --> 00:59:25,870
Hey, you know they say there is no "I" in
the word "team", and they are right.

757
00:59:25,871 --> 00:59:29,201
But, you know where is "IN"?
Alvin.

758
00:59:31,044 --> 00:59:33,916
Such to be you.
Girls!

759
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:36,785
Sadly, he's correct.

760
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:42,144
- Did you find him?
- Guys, sorry, I searched the whole perimeter.

761
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,707
And I don't know why, but
the team is not back yet.

762
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:47,448
What should we do?

763
00:59:48,553 --> 00:59:51,424
I would...

764
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:55,751
I would ask someone... who's not me.

765
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:59,287
I know what we should do.

766
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,763
Hi, everyone.

767
01:00:15,602 --> 01:00:19,096
Our brother, Alvin couldn't be here today.

768
01:00:20,304 --> 01:00:23,854
Thing is, we never performed without Alvin ..

769
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:28,227
...and we are not starting now.

770
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:34,289
You can't have two little pigs,
you can't have only two musketeers so...

771
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:38,073
You know you can't have only two chipmunks.

772
01:00:39,073 --> 01:00:40,376
Thank you.

773
01:00:52,227 --> 01:00:53,499
I'll take you home.

774
01:01:05,317 --> 01:01:06,908
You hear that, girls?

775
01:01:06,909 --> 01:01:11,014
That... is the sound of success.

776
01:01:13,997 --> 01:01:17,422
I relize how devastated you...

777
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,584
Chipmunks' funs must be...

778
01:01:22,415 --> 01:01:25,296
So I guess that means that the Chipettes...

779
01:01:25,297 --> 01:01:28,142
Come on girls, let's take a victory lap.

780
01:01:29,793 --> 01:01:31,819
Hey, come on guys, let's go.

781
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,858
Britt, we have to.

782
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,000
Let's go.

783
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,500
Thank you.

784
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,448
Thanks.

785
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:52,795
Life is good.

786
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:55,728
Especially when you're not a loser.

787
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:59,508
Hey guys? I'm here.

788
01:02:01,242 --> 01:02:02,337
Guys?

789
01:02:03,126 --> 01:02:04,955
Oh, great.

790
01:02:04,956 --> 01:02:06,659
They are gone, Alvin.

791
01:02:07,481 --> 01:02:11,063
- They never gonna forgive me.
- You know... Alvin...

792
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:15,132
Ian was right.
You don't care about anyone except yourself.

793
01:02:20,896 --> 01:02:24,974
And oh, by the way,
I never wanna to win this way.

794
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,768
Simon, are you awake?

795
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:18,001
Theodore, I don't blame you for being mad.

796
01:03:20,555 --> 01:03:22,847
I ran away from home?

797
01:03:22,848 --> 01:03:26,074
Don't look for me in the Zoo,
because I'm not there.

798
01:03:26,076 --> 01:03:28,095
Oh, no Theodore...

799
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:35,794
Hello?

800
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:39,308
Meerkat family?

801
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:47,458
Is anyone home?

802
01:03:48,247 --> 01:03:51,801
My name is Theodore, I like to be in your family.

803
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:00,999
Maybe they are hiding.

804
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,363
Don't be afraid.

805
01:04:08,063 --> 01:04:12,131
You are not a meerkat!

806
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:15,595
Toby, you take the lions,
the tigers and the bears...

807
01:04:15,596 --> 01:04:17,757
Simon and I will take the butterfly room.

808
01:04:18,592 --> 01:04:20,462
Nice Eagle.

809
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,850
Don't move Theodore.

810
01:04:23,851 --> 01:04:26,179
No problem there.

811
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:29,256
Hang in there, hang little guy.
We'll get you out from there.

812
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:35,040
Ok, we need a plan.
And we need carefuly executed plan.

813
01:04:35,702 --> 01:04:38,682
Or you can just ride in there like a maniac.

814
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,520
Theo, watch out.

815
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:43,914
Hi, I'm Theodore...

816
01:04:43,915 --> 01:04:48,903
Hey birdy, look up in here, are you hungry?
Catch this "A"?

817
01:04:48,904 --> 01:04:51,376
That's for appetizer.

818
01:04:54,256 --> 01:04:57,060
Let's all just relax, and
we talk this out, ok!

819
01:04:58,225 --> 01:05:03,415
Look, I guess why you want Theodore, I do,

820
01:05:03,515 --> 01:05:07,013
but I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

821
01:05:08,017 --> 01:05:09,118
He's my brother.

822
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,489
Not let him know that, because
I've been a such a big jerk lately.

823
01:05:17,286 --> 01:05:20,635
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

824
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:24,782
Not really.

825
01:05:25,014 --> 01:05:26,670
I got you, Alvin.

826
01:05:32,988 --> 01:05:34,500
Watch to the eagle.

827
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:38,696
Their only mortal enemy is a piggy elephant.
Luckily I speak a little habitat.

828
01:05:43,804 --> 01:05:45,315
I think it's working.

829
01:05:55,401 --> 01:05:57,155
Guys, that was huge.

830
01:05:57,752 --> 01:06:02,641
He's right.Now we are one for all
and three for one?

831
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:05,779
Come on, Simon, hug it out.

832
01:06:06,835 --> 01:06:08,808
You know I'm sorry, Sy.

833
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:13,690
Sy, don't make me up to kiss you because
I'll do it.

834
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:16,227
I don't care.

835
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:20,752
Here come the lips!
The makeout train leaving the station.

836
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,790
I think after all, I'll take that hug.

837
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,178
Justine, call Ian Hawke.

838
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:41,808
310-555-5309.

839
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:44,804
Morris, get me that Ian Hawke
on the phone.

840
01:06:48,807 --> 01:06:51,554
There you are.

841
01:06:51,555 --> 01:06:53,605
My sweet little money makers.

842
01:06:54,486 --> 01:06:58,801
Do you remember when I told you
that I would make you all big stars?

843
01:07:00,597 --> 01:07:04,610
Well, guess who's opening up for Britney Spears
at Staples Center tonight?

844
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:07,147
Am I dreamin'? Oh, my gosh!

845
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:10,065
Oh, wait, we can't.
We'll miss the school concert!

846
01:07:10,523 --> 01:07:13,550
That's correct.
You will miss the school contest.

847
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:16,030
You are so smart, I can't never get
anything being passed by you.

848
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:23,554
It was never about that stupid school contest,
it was always about making Brittany a star.

849
01:07:23,555 --> 01:07:25,519
That's what you wanted, right?

850
01:07:27,737 --> 01:07:30,992
- Well... yes.
- Tonight is your big chance.

851
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,181
It's all about you, Brittany.

852
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:35,667
But what about Jeanette and Eleanor?

853
01:07:35,668 --> 01:07:38,839
They can sing backups,
I got them some staff too.

854
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:46,014
- We are her sisters.
- We either sing together or not at all!

855
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:49,943
Ok, fine.
All I ever needed is the B-girl.

856
01:07:52,343 --> 01:07:54,442
Ian, I won't do it without them.

857
01:07:57,294 --> 01:08:00,001
Ok, fine, fine. Let's move on to Plan B.

858
01:08:00,602 --> 01:08:03,599
Ok, who likes barbecue?

859
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:10,775
Because I know this awesome little barbecue restaurant
in the valley, that makes the best roasted chipmunks.

860
01:08:11,612 --> 01:08:16,379
Real tasty.
Unless of course, you wanna sing?

861
01:08:24,472 --> 01:08:29,652
Welcome to West Eastman, and thank you
for supporting music in our schools.

862
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:35,273
Now remember, the group you pick tonight,
will win 25000 dollars for their school.

863
01:08:36,724 --> 01:08:40,708
Now there's got a lot of acts, and we have to
trow heat off by nine-thirdy so...

864
01:08:40,709 --> 01:08:47,904
...without no further due, representing Orange
girl put your hands together for... Lou Rosarro.

865
01:09:14,055 --> 01:09:17,815
We meet again.
You wanna a piece of it?

866
01:09:17,915 --> 01:09:19,760
Eagle.

867
01:09:22,397 --> 01:09:23,899
Ian Hawke?

868
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,069
I'll take that.

869
01:09:26,315 --> 01:09:30,226
I didn't realise that you are runnin' a low life.

870
01:09:30,227 --> 01:09:35,119
- Alvin, - Brittany?
- Aren't you guys still interest?

871
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,861
I'm not gonna be able to perform tonight.

872
01:09:37,862 --> 01:09:40,880
What about the music department?
The whole school is counting on you.

873
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:44,383
I know, I know.
I had to listen to you about Ian.

874
01:09:44,384 --> 01:09:45,466
Don't tell me...

875
01:09:45,467 --> 01:09:48,319
Yes, he locked us in a cage.

876
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,840
This is this the biggest you have? I have a license to call
and asked for the biggest thing, that's not the biggest what you got.

877
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:55,756
I will go and take the news to Dr Rubin.

878
01:09:56,864 --> 01:09:59,182
- Brittany?
- Alvin, don't move.

879
01:09:59,183 --> 01:10:01,849
You got it.
Brittany, I'm comin' to get you.

880
01:10:01,996 --> 01:10:04,615
Simon, how do you know to hit a lock?

881
01:10:04,616 --> 01:10:05,557
Roger that.

882
01:10:05,558 --> 01:10:08,408
I need to get to those girls.
Fast.

883
01:10:08,444 --> 01:10:10,253
I know how.

884
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:28,153
The third number is notoriously
the hardest to crack...

885
01:10:28,154 --> 01:10:31,042
I'm assuming that provide
number that we can't assume...

886
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:34,770
The first two numbers are one.
I got to go with one.

887
01:10:34,804 --> 01:10:36,050
It opened.

888
01:10:36,051 --> 01:10:37,803
- All right, girls...
- Ian is coming.

889
01:10:37,804 --> 01:10:39,595
Put the phone back, hurry!

890
01:10:39,596 --> 01:10:41,054
Get ready to be fabulous.

891
01:10:41,055 --> 01:10:42,587
We are ready.

892
01:10:42,588 --> 01:10:47,410
Yeah, you're better be. Because tonight's
performance it's gonna put me back on the top.

893
01:10:55,769 --> 01:10:58,242
And now please welcome... Cherisse.

894
01:11:15,113 --> 01:11:19,840
Driver man, take me to the Arena.
The VIP entrance.

895
01:11:19,841 --> 01:11:24,183
Tout de suite.
A little moonroofs actions.

896
01:11:24,184 --> 01:11:28,096
Moonroofs are go, moonroofs, roofs, roofs...

897
01:11:28,097 --> 01:11:30,344
Champagne.

898
01:11:30,345 --> 01:11:32,990
If you don't mind...
If I do...

899
01:11:32,991 --> 01:11:38,712
You know why I don't mind if I do?
Because tonight we've got to toast...

900
01:11:38,714 --> 01:11:43,500
To a very special someone, named me.

901
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:47,635
They said I couldn't do it,
they said I never bounce back.

902
01:11:48,228 --> 01:11:51,874
Guess what?
Time to kiss my ass.

903
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:59,879
A toast! To the ladies who gonna
make the world forget about the Chipmu...

904
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,950
No, no, no, no!

905
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,581
What are doin'? Alvin.

906
01:12:10,212 --> 01:12:12,871
Hi Ian! Good to see you. You look alright!

907
01:12:16,057 --> 01:12:17,891
No, no! I signed a contract.

908
01:12:17,892 --> 01:12:21,317
- Jump, Jeanette. -Wait!
- I'm not really good...

909
01:12:22,186 --> 01:12:23,996
I bet it you don't perform.

910
01:12:23,998 --> 01:12:25,924
- Gas, Alvin.
- You got it!

911
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:29,916
Hey, Ian! In the words of McDonald, you're fired!

912
01:12:43,494 --> 01:12:47,067
- Hey guys, any sayin' about Alvin yet?
- No Alvin and no Chipettes.

913
01:12:47,068 --> 01:12:51,201
Just Dr Rubin and the entire
school are counting on us.

914
01:12:53,682 --> 01:12:58,245
Well, you know... you know don't worry
everything will work out... ish.

915
01:13:07,701 --> 01:13:09,373
- Faster Alvin!
- Don't worry...

916
01:13:09,374 --> 01:13:12,158
I'm gonna get a real help
from my friend, stay there.

917
01:13:13,272 --> 01:13:15,469
Roger that Alvin.

918
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:17,361
Just like I'm back on the racetrack.

919
01:13:19,146 --> 01:13:21,148
Where you going?
What are you doing?

920
01:13:23,223 --> 01:13:27,199
Wait 'til I tell everybody back home that
I've saved Alvin Seville.

921
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,490
I think I owe you an apology about Ian.

922
01:13:29,491 --> 01:13:32,310
Stick with me Britt.
I'll never stay alive.

923
01:13:33,773 --> 01:13:36,089
Oh yeah, I'll never got to do that.

924
01:13:39,578 --> 01:13:42,280
I got to say, he's definitely persistant.

925
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,006
- We got to lose him.
- Hang on.

926
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,400
I got a plan, jump on a count of three!

927
01:13:52,485 --> 01:13:54,554
Three.

928
01:13:54,909 --> 01:13:58,260
- Oh, that's it.
- I didn't like heights.

929
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,344
- Keep your tight Jeanette.
- Bring my girls right to me.

930
01:14:01,345 --> 01:14:04,805
- We need a remote.
- Guys, I know what have to do.

931
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:06,738
Hats off on Ian.

932
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:15,060
The remote.

933
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:18,154
I can't reach it.

934
01:14:18,155 --> 01:14:20,313
I'm doing it.
Hold my ankles.

935
01:14:24,434 --> 01:14:26,231
I got it.

936
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,743
I got it?

937
01:14:29,878 --> 01:14:32,451
- Well done, Jen.
- Top work, Jeanette.

938
01:14:33,815 --> 01:14:37,525
Hey Ian, you were wrong.
I don't need these.

939
01:14:45,353 --> 01:14:47,915
- Bye bye.
- Adios, Ian.

940
01:14:49,032 --> 01:14:51,837
And now, for our final act of the night...

941
01:14:51,838 --> 01:14:56,797
And, listen we have last second change to the line
up, but we don't think you gonna be to disapointed.

942
01:14:56,798 --> 01:15:01,078
Representing West Eastman it's... the Chipmunks.

943
01:15:05,453 --> 01:15:07,545
We may have to go up there, Theodore.

944
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:17,716
If there are no Chipmunks
we gonna have to move on.

945
01:15:21,507 --> 01:15:23,689
I don't wanna be good again.

946
01:15:25,708 --> 01:15:27,334
I'm sorry, but we have to move on.

947
01:15:34,538 --> 01:15:37,231
I'm not a Chipmunk, as you can see.

948
01:15:44,925 --> 01:15:47,937
Where is the music you loser?
Where is the music? Music?!

949
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:54,976
Ok, I got to song.

950
01:16:34,865 --> 01:16:36,980
Well, that... was huge.

951
01:16:41,004 --> 01:16:43,993
Thank you.

952
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:47,917
The Chipmunks are in the building.

953
01:16:48,693 --> 01:16:51,529
- It is the Chipettes!
- Alvin.

954
01:16:55,537 --> 01:16:57,854
Hello, West Eastman.

955
01:16:58,443 --> 01:17:01,590
I'm puttin' her down.
Hang on.

956
01:17:02,123 --> 01:17:04,323
- Alvin.
- Give me the high-five, brothers.

957
01:17:07,452 --> 01:17:11,341
Ladies and gentlemen, representing West Eastman
it is my great pleasure...

958
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,119
This is such an honor.

959
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,778
- For you or for us?
- For us.

960
01:17:21,491 --> 01:17:23,972
We get it! Come up, guys.

961
01:17:26,178 --> 01:17:29,277

Hey everybody, it's clear that we have a
winner of the 25000 dollars...

975
01:19:03,815 --> 01:19:05,655
And it's West Eastman High.

976
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:09,138
Guys, we did it.

977
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:19,840
It's all yours, Dr Rubin.

978
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:32,045
Ladies and Gentlemen, The Staples Center
is proud to welcome the Chipettes.

979
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:38,795
Hi everyone, I'm Jeanette
and I am Eleanor.

980
01:19:38,796 --> 01:19:40,795
And I'm Brittany.

981
01:19:40,796 --> 01:19:43,665
And we are the Chipettes.

982
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,274
One, two, three.

983
01:20:18,132 --> 01:20:21,458
- Dave, you are dancing.
- You are even good, Dave. Yeah!

984
01:20:21,459 --> 01:20:24,310
- Welcome home.
- So, did you miss us?

985
01:20:24,345 --> 01:20:27,439
Of course I missed you.
You are my boys.

986
01:20:28,068 --> 01:20:31,482
Ok Dave, just did how much you miss us.
There are now six of us.

987
01:20:31,483 --> 01:20:32,724
Alvin, what did you say?

988
01:20:32,725 --> 01:20:35,843
The Chipettes need a place to cresche, right?

989
01:20:35,844 --> 01:20:41,264
So I said that you said, they can stay with us
for as long as they needed to.

990
01:20:42,983 --> 01:20:48,262
Ok, this works for Dave.
Everybody shake what your mama gave ya!

991
01:21:25,372 --> 01:21:28,377
Look at you.
All ready for bed.

992
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,042
Looks like the Chipettes
had a good influence.

993
01:21:32,043 --> 01:21:34,380
Thanks, Dave.

994
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:37,245
Ok guys now lights out.

995
01:21:37,346 --> 01:21:38,471
Good night everybody.

996
01:21:42,378 --> 01:21:44,300
- Alvin?
- I'm not tired.

997
01:21:44,302 --> 01:21:46,542
Sorry, but you've got school tomorrow.

998
01:21:48,686 --> 01:21:51,869
Not tired.

999
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,848
Alvin, come on. It's time for bed.

1000
01:21:56,388 --> 01:21:58,034
Not tired.

1001
01:22:01,877 --> 01:22:04,717
Still not tired. More light.

1002
01:22:04,817 --> 01:22:06,873
Tired. Just kidding.
Much more light.

1003
01:22:06,973 --> 01:22:09,484
Alvin, that's it!
Don't make me come over there...

1004
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:18,114
Oh boy, I finally got relly, really tired.

1005
01:22:18,115 --> 01:22:19,099
Good night, Dave.

1006
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,535
