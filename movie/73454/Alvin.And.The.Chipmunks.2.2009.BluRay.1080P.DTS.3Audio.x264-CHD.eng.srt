1
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,738
We are back!

2
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:43,955
Let's go!

3
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:49,526
Nuts!

4
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:53,583
Gimme the Black Beauty.

5
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:58,977
Alvin, take it easy up there. You've got to share the spotlight.

6
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:00,254
You got it, Dave.

7
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,325
- Dave. - I'm serious, Alvin. This is a charity benefit.

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,912
- It's not all about you. - Sorry,Dave. I can't hear you ...

9
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,245
over the thousands of fans screaming my name.

10
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:16,683
I've got  this.

11
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,894
I need a help, boys.

12
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:46,185
Alvin, will you please get down from there.

13
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,722
I can't hear you.

14
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,188
- Alvin, I'm not kidding. - What?

15
00:02:55,712 --> 00:03:03,476
- Dave, look out! - Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

16
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:10,584
Oh, Dave. Dave?

17
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:16,091
This should help with the pain.

18
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,578
I wannna talk to my boys.

19
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:23,105
I just gave you a sedative that will take effect in about one minute, so...

20
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,783
But, let them in, quickly.

21
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:32,367
- Dave! - You are alive! - Hey guys!

22
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:34,875
- It was an accident. I swear. - Are you OK?

23
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,936
- I'm really sorry, Dave. - I'll be fine.

24
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,242
I'm just gonna be stucked here for a while.

25
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:45,100
And until I get out, I made arrangements for my aunt Jackie to come and stay with you.

26
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,327
Who is Aunt Jackie?

27
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:50,144
The one who sent us those mail package of  yummy popcorn for Christmas.

28
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,399
- Popcorn Jackie. - You don't have much time Mr Seville.

29
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,267
Listen, I want you guys to go home and live a normal childhood.

30
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:03,770
I even made arrangement  for you to go to school.

31
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:06,729
- School? - Yes, school.

32
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,253
Simon, I'm putting you in charge.

33
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:15,352
- You are? - I'm counting on you.

34
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:18,671
Dave, wait a minute.  Why is he in charge?

35
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:22,465
- He's counting on me. - Dave, please, don't die.

36
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:24,503
He just sleeping. He had a sedative.

37
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,135
Ah, a sedative.

38
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,157
Excuse me, I'm here to escort the Chipmunks home.

39
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:33,843
We are not leaving Dave. I'm putting my paw down on this one.

40
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:35,201
You come here.

41
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,090
I got it! I'll fix it! No, made it worse.

42
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:42,326
Please, please go.

43
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:48,469
More stress you put on persistent the longer will take him to recover.

44
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,528
You are too slow, nanny.

45
00:04:52,529 --> 00:05:01,108
You'll never hit me! I'm not going anywhere without Daaa... ...aaaydream believer, and a homecoming queen...

46
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:07,953
I hope for your sake he stays asleep for the entire flight.

47
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:11,820
Maybe you should give him another shot. Just to be sure.

48
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,073
Any ideas on how we gonna find aunt Jackie?

49
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,327
Follow me.

50
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,355
Excuse me. Sorry.

51
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,758
Excuse me, got you.

52
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,860
- Look, aunt Jackie! Aunt Jackie! - Popcorn Jackie.

53
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,411
- Oh, come on dears. - Yeah, we got you.

54
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,563
- Popcorn! - Who's sending to Theodore's?

55
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,072
Oh, there is a plenty for everyone. Give a hug first.

56
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:48,720
Come over here, you old teddy bear.

57
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:51,411
I'm not really much of a hugger.

58
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:55,535
Oh, boys, I want you to meet someone. This is my grandson Toby. Toby?

59
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,416
Hi, I'm Theodore.

60
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:01,026
- Toby?! - What, what happened?

61
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,510
- The boys! - Oh, hey! Hey,how are you? I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.

62
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:07,992
Toby is living with me 'til he figures out what he want to do with his life.

63
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,446
So far that means going beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with his thumbs the all day.

64
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:17,028
For the record goin' beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with my thumbs right now is keeping me in first place, and that's important.

65
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,070
- Toby get the bags. - What bags?

66
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:23,868
- The lighters. Get the luggages. - Oh, the lug, right. Let me get those...

67
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,792
- Toby! - Get the brake! Get the brake!

68
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,560
I'm fine.Don't worry!

69
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:46,178
I'm so sorry, aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry. Is she goin' to be ok?

70
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:49,170
Don't worry about me, I will be home with no time.

71
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:52,433
I wouldn't be so sure.

72
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:56,195
It was an accident, I swear.

73
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:59,093
Been there, done that. Several times.

74
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:01,505
I guess he will be taking care of us now?

75
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,197
I'll take frankly foster of five hundred please-outs.

76
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,293
Ain't no problem. I can totally do this.

77
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:11,245
I mean, I took care of my cat...  until it ran away.

78
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:15,129
Well, 'ran away' is kind of strong wordin', I think he just wanted his space.

79
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,603
I still see him around neighbourhood.

80
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,314
You know, he like hisses and claws at me. but I think that's his way of saying we're still tight, you know.

81
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:29,032
You guys are nothing to worry about, seriously. 'Cause, I'm not gonna be like Dave, you know, Dave is gone.

82
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,262
Gone?

83
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:34,796
Not gone, not gone gone. He is not dead. He's very much alive.

84
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:38,081
He completely coming back. I'm just gonna be in his room, keepin' his bed warm.

85
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:42,091
I'll be doin'my thing,you'll be doin' your thing. I mean, you don't need to know that I'm there.

86
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:46,979
We supposed to know that you there, that's the whole idea.

87
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:54,572
Yeah, ok absolutely. You know that I'm there,I'm just... I'm not gonna be like: I know everything, and you do this, and you do that.

88
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,005
I mean that.

89
00:07:57,049 --> 00:08:00,056
All right, let's do this.

90
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:01,762
Oh, boy!

91
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,587
Theodore, we gonna be just fine.

92
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:18,984
The important thing is...we're all still alive.

93
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:22,610
Well, maybe my "Get Well" card will  help Dave to come faster.

94
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,594
It needs just a touch more glitter.

95
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:33,228
That should do it. Who's hungry?

96
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,344
- Uh, uh me, me! - Let's eat.

97
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:39,364
Nada. Find anything?

98
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:42,161
It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

99
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,481
Bingo. Dinner, she is  aserved.

100
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,043
Hey, what are you doing in here?

101
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:23,659
A cheese ball?

102
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,445
Thumb boy, give me a second, real quick.

103
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:32,610
Alvin, I really need to focus, right now because I'm one knockout away from my heavy weight title.

104
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,197
Can we play as well?

105
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:41,849
You know, I don't want to  hurt your feelings, but else you don't want see anyone get hurt and there gonna be fistsufferean flyin'.

106
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,518
We can play monopoly.

107
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,897
We play monopoly with Dave all the time.

108
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,516
That sounds funny. We should do that sometime right.

109
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:51,472
Now, I got to back and floatin' like a butterfly and stinging like the bee.

110
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:58,391
Who needs Toby, Theodore, you got us.

111
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:02,517
Yeah, who needs Toby? Boys, right this way.

112
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:23,562
I'm gonna puke.

113
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:28,474
Do you know what Dave would say if he were here right now?

114
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:32,301
But I think it means to come more from the belly.

115
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,739
Get together. Be cool.

116
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,290
- Helllooooo? - Boys, it's me.

117
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,801
Dave?

118
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:51,461
Well, I guess since you've answered the phone,  you haven't burned down the house yet.

119
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,693
- Have a little faith, Dave. - Yes.

120
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,941
Mayday!

121
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,446
- What was that? - Don't stress him out.

122
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:06,081
- Oh, that was... Aunt Jackie. - Yeah, she's making us a tasty five-course meal.

123
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:09,322
Really? Can I talk to her?

124
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:12,173
She's practising her pole dancing.

125
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:15,840
Pole dancing? But, what happened with making dinner. Guys, what's going on?

126
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,469
- Gotta go, Dave. - Alvin, I'm not kidding!

127
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,280
- Get better! - Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

128
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,690
Yep, nobody does that better than him.

129
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:57,927
Toby, Toby wake up.

130
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:06,141
- Sorry. - No, that's okay. What is it?

131
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:11,121
- I had a nightmare. - Oh, the nightmares.I hate the nightmares.

132
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:12,169
What was it?

133
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,418
I dreamt that we didn't have a family anymore.

134
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:21,795
Theodore, that couldn't happen.  No, you guys are tight.

135
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:24,426
Nothing could ever separate you.

136
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:29,374
Less like an eagle swooped down from the sky like caw-caaaw!

137
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:37,859
Which couldn't happen ever. Why would you think that ever happened, you know...

138
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,672
The Eagles are in Philadelphia.

139
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:43,704
Sweet dreams.

140
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:54,050
- Toby, make it stop. - What are you doing?

141
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:57,119
There is something wrong with the clock. It won't shut up.

142
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,523
I can't sleep.

143
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:04,142
That's the point. It's an alarm clock.

144
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:06,735
It helps you wake up early in the morning.

145
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,993
Why anyone wanna wake up early?

146
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:11,957
For the school, you got to be there by eight.

147
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,197
- In tðÞe morning? - Look, I don't like any others early anything more than you do.

148
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:21,433
But we are in this together, Alvin. Soon you get to school, soon I get to compound and get back to sleep.

149
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:25,861
- You mean you don't stayin' with us in school? - No, no , no.

150
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:27,966
I've done my time making very much.

151
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:33,075
- But school is fun, right? - Fun? Well, i guess Maybe, it's... fun-ish..

152
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,605
Hey, it's my cat!

153
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,658
Hey kiddy it's me, remember?

154
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:47,160
I treated you good.

155
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:10,185
There, here we go.

156
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:14,840
Enjoy your first day in school. See you around three-ish.

157
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:25,810
We got it. This got to be a walk in the park.

158
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:29,477
I'm frightening.

159
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,795
Hi, I'm Theodore.

160
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:37,663
Hi, I'm Theodore.

161
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:48,107
- Eagle. - Go eagle!

162
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:58,623
That wasn't very fun-ish.

163
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:03,706
You must be our new students. I'm Dr Rubin, the principal.

164
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,974
And we are the Chipmunks.

165
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:09,932
Yeah, that will explain the fur and booshy tales.

166
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,605
- Follow me, gentlemen. - Gentlemen?

167
00:15:12,606 --> 00:15:15,177
Oh, us. Right.

168
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:17,732
There was a minute left and we were down by two ...

169
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:21,332
And I mind couch: I don't care if my leg is broken, put me in, I can win this...

170
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,910
I never get tired of that story.

171
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,287
So I hobbled out barely able to stand...

172
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:28,672
Did I mention my leg was broken?

173
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,977
- Mrs. Ortega? - Yes?

174
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,500
- Good luck. - Thanks.

175
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:38,277
- Well guys, welcome to home room. - Good to be here, I hope.

176
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:40,128
So this is a classroom?

177
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,922
I love the smell of zit cream in the morning.

178
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:47,770
Hello ladies.

179
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:56,432
Hi, I'm Theodore. Hi, I'm Theodore.

180
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,566
Yes, he's Theodore in case you missed it.

181
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,325
And I am Simon.

182
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,632
My name Seville, Alvin Seville.

183
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:08,953
Enchant¨¦e... mademoiselle.

184
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:14,486
Somebody's have to knock these guys down to size.

185
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:17,754
That should be pretty easy, really. They are only eight inches tall.

186
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:49,254
I had 15 cars. I mean that's like five more cars than anybody really needs.

187
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:55,072
I had seven maids. Courtside seats to the Lakers.

188
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,267
Even my maids had courstside seats to the Lakers.

189
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,292
Now, look at me.

190
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:05,103
Look at me. I lost everything.

191
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:08,730
Except for my dignity, they can't take that away from me.

192
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,229
And it's all because of them.

193
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:18,120
Oh, hey ...crackers.

194
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,386
Now run around, hoping and praying that I could find other animals that can ...

195
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:24,817
sing or dance.

196
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:28,237
Wait a second, you don't sing, do you?

197
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,483
Hey, hey that's my muffin. Give me my muffin! You dirty rat.

198
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:40,455
I will get you Chimpmunks.

199
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:51,232
Girls, we have to get out of here.

200
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,065
I can't see.

201
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,618
- My nose. - That's my tail! - Sorry.

202
00:17:56,718 --> 00:18:00,617
- Move your ass. - Ok. Stop pushing me.

203
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:08,130
- We made it. - Jets Records! - Phew!

204
00:18:10,036 --> 00:18:14,456
Oh, my gosh. It's him! Ian Hawke!

205
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:16,799
Mr Hawke?

206
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:20,726
That voice! I can't get it out of my head!

207
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:23,886
Hello, Mr Hawke?

208
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:27,174
That not in my head, that's really happening.

209
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:30,591
- What do you want? - We want to introduce ourselves.

210
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:35,020
That's right. I'm Brittany. And this is my sister Eleanor.

211
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:37,989
Hello, sir. Such a pleasure to meet you!

212
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,308
And I'm their sister Jeanette.  Although I feel more like an Olivia or sometimes....

213
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,454
Anyway, we are the Chipmunk girls.

214
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:49,388
We will be just so honored to have you to represent us.

215
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:51,378
You made Alvin and the Chipmunk stars.

216
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:53,175
We wanna be stars too, yeah!

217
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:56,057
And hangin' out with the Chipmunks.

218
00:18:56,058 --> 00:19:00,593
Ok, now listen before we get all girly and giggly about this, just tell me one thing ...

219
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:03,760
You can sing, right?

220
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,929
Hang on, not here.

221
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:13,646
Why not we take this meeting upstairs in my penthouse office?

222
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:18,375
This is so exciting.

223
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,208
Oh, my gosh, can you believe it?

224
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:26,449
My first penthouse office!

225
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,530
Oh, my... the Hollywood sign!

226
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,466
I thought you might like the view!

227
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:37,716
Ladies, tell me little something about yourselves.

228
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:41,533
We grew up in a small town, population 300 and ...

229
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:44,337
Really? That's fascinating. Great!

230
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,728
All right, impress me!

231
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:50,882
One, two, three.

232
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:27,487
Girls, girls, girls.

233
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:32,022
Guess who just became the number one Chipmunks' band in whole dang world?

234
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,627
Ian Hawke.

235
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:38,198
So, when can we meet the Chipmunks?

236
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:43,892
That's an excellent question  and the excellent answer is...

237
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:47,900
I don't really represent Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

238
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:51,216
- Oh, no. Wha-what happened? - Oh, classic tale.

239
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,031
Sweet and innocent when I met them, they had nothing ...and then I work my butt of

240
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:57,035
to make them rock stars and...

241
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,937
They changed. Turned out to be like bad cheese.

242
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,405
- No. - That's terrible.

243
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:09,648
I know. I mean, I treated Alvin like my own son, you know.

244
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:12,774
And he just goes and spits on me.

245
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:17,521
Literally. He filled his chipmunk's cheeks with saliva and just had at it.

246
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:22,823
- Don't even get me started about Simon. - But not Theodore, right?

247
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:25,856
It's the cuddly ones you have to watch for.

248
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:29,825
But why we are talkin' about them for, c'mon? They are over, fired, nobledeuðÞe (noble death)...

249
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:32,332
Chipmunks' stupid sayin'.

250
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,137
But ...

251
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:40,456
Girl Chipmunks' stupid sayin' ... Fasten your seat belts!

252
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:47,715
So I eyed Jay Z's eyes right, and I said:  Jay, where is Beyonce?

253
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:50,423
And he says : She's holding a plate  full of cheese balls, turn around ...

254
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:52,481
And guess what..

255
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:56,554
- She was. - PS, Dave left me in charge.

256
00:21:56,555 --> 00:22:00,217
We stay up to ten every night.

257
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,925
Look what I can do.

258
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:06,621
You're Theadorable.

259
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:14,007
- I am so sorry. - That's cool. No harm done.

260
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:17,926
Not yet. Girls, please, private conference.

261
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:21,103
Thank you.

262
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:27,723
Listen up, rock stars.

263
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:30,712
If you talk to those girls again you're dead.

264
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:33,713
If you look at those girls again you're dead.

265
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:37,478
If you even think about those girls...

266
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:41,067
- Are you thinking about them? - Well, I am now.

267
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:44,250
- That's it. - You are dead!

268
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:48,865
Get them, c'mon! Crack you, you dirty rats!

269
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,197
Scatter!

270
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,424
- That way. Over there! - I'm runin'.

271
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,804
Hey Dumbo, catch me if you can.

272
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,735
- You are dead! - Not!

273
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:11,609
It's stretching time!

274
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,509
Oh, boy.

275
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:26,573
Eagle.

276
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:29,117
- Eagle! Eagle! - Get him.

277
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:31,843
- Move! Move! - This way.

278
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:34,882
- Gotcha. - Wait, wait, come up...

279
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:38,262
- It's swirley time. - C'mon, c'mon guys, this is not so...

280
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:40,920
Please, please!

281
00:23:43,716 --> 00:23:46,768
- That's a good look for you! - Thank you.

282
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:51,987
- I can't swim. Help. - Grab on Simon!

283
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,293
You okay?

284
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:04,048
Well, uh, considering that you just saved me  from drowning in a toilet...

285
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:06,429
I'm, uh, pretty good.

286
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,540
I'll be right back.

287
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,047
Alvin, Alvin!  We're not gonna solve anything with violence!

288
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,151
- It's the fatty ratty. - Cut it out!

289
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:17,140
- This rat has serious junk in the trunk. - Yeah, little fatty.

290
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,584
Simon, does this make my butt look smaller?

291
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:31,098
Theodore, your butt looks fine. Those guys are just some jerks.

292
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:44,883
You threatened to climb inside of him and build a nest.

293
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:49,247
That was out of line and not even sure that is physically impossible.

294
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:54,970
- I should suspend all three of you. - Please do.

295
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,811
Instead I have the better idea.

296
00:25:06,516 --> 00:25:11,727
Due to budget cutbacks , we are in jeopardy of loosing our beloved music program.

297
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:13,605
- That's awful. - I know.

298
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:16,175
But, there is one small ray of hope.

299
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,639
Every year the District sponsors a music competition...

300
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,311
And the winner school receives 25,000 dolars.

301
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:25,625
IðÞ we win, we can save our program.

302
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:28,334
And you want us to perform?

303
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:31,362
I begin to think that you are a fan?

304
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,268
Why don't you sleep on it.

305
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:38,762
- Wait. - Great.

306
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,967
Promise me that you won't say anything.

307
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:45,607
The principal has a certain image to uphold. If Mr Fencle ever finds out about this ta...

308
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:52,897
I just can't believe this, that you are actually sitting in my office. I have all of your CDs.

309
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:56,720
I even went to see you last year in Denver. That's where I got this.

310
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:59,910
It was my birthday. And I was like...Oh, the Chipmunks!

311
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:07,015
So, what you say?  Will you represent our school?

312
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:11,561
Honestly suspension sounds pretty good to me.

313
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:16,016
Come on Alvin? One for all, and three for one.

314
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:19,219
Well put, Theodore.Very well put. Count us in.

315
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,259
Go Eagles!

316
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,282
Eagles? Where?

317
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:30,489
Ah, the penthouse limo.

318
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,811
Tr¨¨s exclusivo.

319
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:39,787
Hey, isn't that that Chihuahua? Ya know, from the movie?

320
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:45,407
Uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, of course it is. Yeah, a lot of big names live here.

321
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:48,325
- Oh. Como esta? - I must have his autograph!

322
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:51,709
Whoa, whoa, Brittany. You wanna be a star, act like a star.

323
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,789
- You don't get autographs, you give 'em. - Oh, right.

324
00:26:57,791 --> 00:27:00,994
Hey, look over there, there's a couple of the Jonas Brothers.

325
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,716
- Where? I don't see them. - Here we are.

326
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:08,807
Ok, let's scootin' to my apartment ...

327
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:12,680
What? Did I... Oh, darn it! Darn it to heck!

328
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,129
- What? What's wrong? - Girls, I apologise but ...

329
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,574
I seem to left my keys back in my office.

330
00:27:19,434 --> 00:27:23,280
What if one of you shroud through that mail slot and open it up for me from the inside?

331
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,728
I'll do it.

332
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:30,723
I'm stuck.

333
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,336
All right, I got you, I got you!

334
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:40,693
Not so hard.

335
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:43,106
I wanna lay off the nuts.

336
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:46,024
All right, how about you, glasses?  You are in better shape. Wanna go?

337
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:49,704
- Well I'm not that good in things like this. - I got it!

338
00:27:58,337 --> 00:28:01,079
Impressive!

339
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,196
Gee, Willakers!

340
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:08,005
Great. Bingo! This is the best treehouse ever!

341
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:10,402
A red piano.

342
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:14,040
- Is this a dream? - Stand by and catch me.

343
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:18,798
- It's much better than a tree! - I just adore a penthouse view!

344
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:21,788
Nice one, Hawke.

345
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:24,473
- You like it? - Sure, Ian.

346
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:27,592
- I live here. - It's so beautiful.

347
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:33,129
The last time we visited Meerkat Manor ...

348
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,435
Arrival group called the Commanders ...

349
00:28:35,436 --> 00:28:39,171
was making large indoors in to the Whiskers' teritory.

350
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:50,292
Toby, I thought i was messy,  but this is really disgusting.

351
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,310
I feel like livin' in a dumpster.

352
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:56,375
Simon, it's Meerkat Manor on it. Watch with me.

353
00:28:57,126 --> 00:29:01,893
You're right. I thik I'll relax, feelin' my nerves little bit...

354
00:29:01,894 --> 00:29:04,879
What is this?

355
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,825
You got to be joking? A taco.

356
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:10,499
In a blanket? Toby!

357
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:16,964
Ladies and gentlemen, goin' for his turkey is the Tobster.

358
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:21,921
Come on baby.

359
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:31,396
No problem. Watch and learn, my friends.

360
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:39,094
Oops, broken TV, I think this is the time to play my second favorite game.

361
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:41,945
Hide the broken TV from Dave. You wanna play?

362
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,238
- No!!! - Go easy on him, Taco Boy.

363
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:47,551
This day has been bad enough already.

364
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:53,824
Oh, I think I see what's going on.

365
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:57,280
- You guys are having some problems at school. - No, not really ...

366
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:00,774
Unless you consider, having your head  dumped in public toilet, a problem ...

367
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:06,642
Squirrelees are the worst.

368
00:30:06,643 --> 00:30:08,719
At least, that's what I heard.

369
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,077
Because, there is no way that I possibly know that, on a personal level.

370
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:16,549
Toby, what was school like for you?

371
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:57,236
- Toby? Tobyyy!!! - What?

372
00:30:57,271 --> 00:30:59,946
What was school like for me? In a word?

373
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:05,170
Awesome! But, you know that 'cause I was like ...

374
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:08,630
Extremely popular.

375
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:12,613
- Is that why you are still live with your grandmother? - And refer to yourself as Tobster?

376
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:15,475
And go peeoo-peeoo-peeoo all day?

377
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:19,327
Bed time.

378
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:30,082
Alvin! Alvin wake up and turn off the alarm.

379
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:39,796
Alvin, I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding, buddy, turn it off!

380
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,322
Guys, guys ...

381
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:51,056
Boys, this isn't funny.

382
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:54,358
Hello? I need help.

383
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:57,544
A man got us. He wants to take us to eternal place.

384
00:31:57,545 --> 00:32:00,932
- School. - Howgh!  - Have a heart.

385
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:04,270
Have a heart. Dave wants you to school, so you are goin'.

386
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:08,127
Don't worry about taking us three, Toby. We gonna be all right.

387
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:11,466
- If it hurts? - Guys, come on.

388
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:14,894
Trust me, the second day is never as bad as the first.

389
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:23,417
Glasses! Glasses!  You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would y...

390
00:32:24,223 --> 00:32:27,305
Right in the pancreas.

391
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:35,270
Nurse?

392
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:41,822
C'mon, Alvin! Remember the five D's! Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!

393
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:44,696
You're next, furball.

394
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:47,363
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me?

395
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:51,243
I'm the only one here, so you must be talkin' to me.

396
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,605
- Did you see that? - Hallelujah!

397
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:04,390
Unbelievable, he caught it. You're out, man.

398
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,403
And the tackle made, she got's in.

399
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,210
- He got hands. - I think that's paws actually.

400
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:14,982
We can definitely use him on the team.

401
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:18,730
Hey, furball, how would you like a spot inðÞthe football team?

402
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:21,745
- Football? Moi? - I got to say you're good.

403
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:24,182
I'm gonna let you hangin' out with us at lunch.

404
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:27,758
That is, if you wanna be on the team?

405
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,163
- Interesting proposition. - Alvin?

406
00:33:30,164 --> 00:33:33,544
- Maybe I'll get back to you on that. - This is a one-time offer.

407
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,432
Don't take too long and think it over .

408
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,274
Great, but I will dish my brothers!

409
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:43,452
Just to become the first chipmunk ever to  play an actual pose on a football team.

410
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:46,262
No chance.

411
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:49,813
The stadium is unanimous.

412
00:33:49,814 --> 00:33:55,038
It stots and goes, it's out, it's out... and he catches it!

413
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,359
The crowd goes crazy.

414
00:34:02,427 --> 00:34:03,940
Me?

415
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:11,992
I think that super cool jock table is paging you.

416
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:14,312
Why would I go over there?

417
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:17,108
Look, if I really need to worry about being popular.

418
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:21,061
Hello, talking Chipmunk. World-famous rock star ...

419
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:25,044
Dive with his own flesh doll. Guys, I'm on pajamas.

420
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:28,701
Not to toot my own horn bike.

421
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:33,546
Come on, it's delectable.

422
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:36,400
- Just go, Alvin. - Really? You really mean it?

423
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,489
- Yeah. - Thanks. I'll be right back.

424
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,898
- What's up, geeks? - What's up, man?

425
00:34:45,343 --> 00:34:47,937
Bring it.

426
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:59,504
I got it, I got it I...

427
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:02,364
Not.

428
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:05,062
- I think he's cute. - Me too.

429
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:09,494
Toss.

430
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:16,262
Call me.

431
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:20,788
I'm tellin' you, Chipmunks are old news. I got the next big thing.

432
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,277
Singing female Chipmunks.

433
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:32,649
God, what part of singing female chipmunks some of this people do not understand...

434
00:35:35,854 --> 00:35:39,497
Girls, we are goin' to school.

435
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:43,330
He's up, and he scores.

436
00:35:44,848 --> 00:35:50,128
Hey, right up, ass? Wow, don't hate on a high five?

437
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:53,132
Yeah, high five.

438
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:57,886
Look Alvin, I know you've guys been busy with your sporting gathers and what not...

439
00:35:57,887 --> 00:36:01,732
- But I can really use your help at home. - Oh, no can do.

440
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:04,944
Ryan is gonna teach me how  to get pretty girls to do my homework.

441
00:36:06,521 --> 00:36:09,726
Alvin, you promised Theodore we hang out.

442
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:13,126
We are watching Meerkat Manor tonight. No pretty girls.

443
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:17,292
- Dude, I can't swing it today. - That's what you say every day, Alvin.

444
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:19,733
Not to remind you it's your day to do the laundry.

445
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:23,794
Better listen to your daddy, Alvin. You don't wanna get grounded?

446
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:30,642
- Are you going to pick that up? - Are you going to make me?

447
00:36:30,643 --> 00:36:35,628
Au contraire, mon fr¨¨re! I'm just going to elegantly show you how it's done.

448
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:43,993
Off the glass. And you call yourself a jar.

449
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,877
My brother, he's a real jokester. Always do.

450
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,910
I'll see you guys around.

451
00:36:57,611 --> 00:37:00,017
- That's my play. - That's my play.

452
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:03,806
Why are you tryin' to embarrass me in front of my friends?

453
00:37:03,907 --> 00:37:06,919
Are you kidding me? They are the ones which should be embarrassed by.

454
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,882
- Good luck with the show, guys. - First row seats. Can't wait!

455
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:12,139
So, which song are we gonna sing?

456
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,116
No pressure, but the whole school is counting on us.

457
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:19,174
Oh, relax! It's like Ryan said:  Who's gonna beat singing chipmunks?

458
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,919
Finally. Oh, Simon is dreamy.

459
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,976
- I think Theodore was looking at me! - Yeah, I know.

460
00:37:51,977 --> 00:37:55,686
But guys remember what Ian said? We can't trust them.

461
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:20,291
- What happened? - I never thought I'd say this but...

462
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:24,949
- Pink is my new favourite colour. - Her glasses were quite fetching.

463
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:28,106
She's like a beautiful green gumdrop.

464
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:32,202
If you guys want to do this you got to pay attention.

465
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:35,846
- Maybe, this is a good time for us to take a break. - Good call,take five.

466
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:40,104
She's right. We need to focus.

467
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:42,900
This is for my screen saver.

468
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:47,566
- Hey buzz! - Hey guys? Are you guys ready to go?

469
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:49,595
'Cause I've got a lot of important staff  to do at home.

470
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:54,645
- You must be their guardian? - God, that I am. Yes I am.

471
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:58,951
Hi. How are you, Dr Rubin? I know that because I went to school here a few years ago.

472
00:38:58,952 --> 00:39:03,832
I don't know if you remember me, Toby Seville probably not...

473
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:10,293
Toby? No way? Hi! Hey, no braces.

474
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:14,974
- I think it's great. - I did ...

475
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:18,674
I did get the braces off,'cause they were just...

476
00:39:31,017 --> 00:39:36,299
I know a guy who actually works on drum heads. I'll be in the car, guys.

477
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:40,843
Somebody is in love.

478
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:44,695
We are going to replace everything. Chipmunks' honor.

479
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:48,475
The old false modestly suck up routine.

480
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:52,489
- I thought I smelled a rat. - May I help you Mr Hawke?

481
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,274
I was wondering if I could help you, Ijust heard about your musical competition ...

482
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:59,457
and I just get down here as quickly as I could                                                                         to volunteer my girls.

483
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:03,531
That's very thoughtful of you, but I've already made up my mind.

484
00:40:03,532 --> 00:40:07,489
Perhaps this will change your mind.

485
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,415
Girls.

486
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:14,022
They are with Ian?

487
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,522
One, two, one, two ...

488
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,712
They're astounding.

489
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:28,604
Good people of West Eastman, you have  just witnessed the debut...

490
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:31,527
Of the Chipettes!

491
00:41:31,528 --> 00:41:33,553
Thank you!

492
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:39,166
- Well? - They were splendid. But as I said before...

493
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:42,964
I have made my decision.

494
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,437
I see. You've made your decision.

495
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:53,925
I don't need to speak out of school doctor,  but in the true spirit of democracy ...

496
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:58,495
which our great wonderful country was founded upon...

497
00:41:58,496 --> 00:42:01,697
I say, lðÞt the people vote.

498
00:42:01,698 --> 00:42:07,294
Let them choose. One person, one vote, I say, let us vote!

499
00:42:07,295 --> 00:42:10,613
Let us vote.

500
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:13,657
Let us vote.

501
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:17,123
Please don't be a flasher granby...

502
00:42:17,124 --> 00:42:19,473
let them sing.

503
00:42:19,474 --> 00:42:22,082
Let us vote.

504
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:27,503
You make a persuasive case, Mr Hawke.

505
00:42:28,903 --> 00:42:31,717
All right, here is what I'm going to do.

506
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:36,304
This friday, each group will perform one song in front of the student body.

507
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:40,189
Whoever gets the most applause, well, will represent the school.

508
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,871
What?

509
00:42:42,618 --> 00:42:46,504
Thank you. We made it.

510
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:49,221
Oh, it is on, like Donkey Kong!

511
00:42:52,141 --> 00:42:55,138
The Meerkats huddle together, at the end of a dramatic day ...

512
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,880
to reaffirm their family bond.

513
00:42:57,881 --> 00:43:01,954
The whiskers are going to have to rely on each other more than ever.

514
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:06,189
Guys, I'm so happy that Mrs Ortega can rehearsal with us every day after school.

515
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:10,504
- Wow! Every day? - Stop right there, ok!

516
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,749
We are the team, we need you.

517
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,680
Would you relax? We are not going to lose.

518
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:19,324
We'll talk about this in the morning.

519
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:22,858
Not much to talk about. I will see you at the rehearsal.

520
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:27,550
- Stop huggin'. - I am not huggin'.

521
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:33,122
You might as well be really obstacles  in the face countryside because you are in fact huggin'.

522
00:43:33,124 --> 00:43:37,434
- I'm not. - I saw, and saw...

523
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:40,068
I think I will sleep in my own bed tonight.

524
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:42,957
You know for me, I'm so glad I'm not a meerkat.

525
00:43:44,312 --> 00:43:46,284
- Oh, really? And why is that? - I would never hug with you!

526
00:44:00,444 --> 00:44:04,369
Toby, can I sleep with you?

527
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:10,587
- What? - Be kind to me.

528
00:44:10,588 --> 00:44:13,431
My brothers are fighting.

529
00:44:14,681 --> 00:44:18,779
What? Geeeee... ok.

530
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:32,252
Man, Dutch Oven!

531
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:36,886
Not the Dutch Oven! Anything but the Dutch Oven! I can¡¯t breath!

532
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:41,422
It's to late! It burns! It burns!

533
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:07,960
Now, let's see. What else am I in the mood for?

534
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:11,538
How about a side order of friendly advice, courtesy of me?

535
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:13,837
No, thanks.

536
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:15,964
Grapes, please.

537
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:23,026
Heh, heh. Excuse me. Ahem.  So, uh, well, I, I, I just wanted to warn you... about Ian.

538
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:25,604
What?

539
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:30,699
You should be grateful to him.  He did everything for you, Alvin, and you broke his heart.

540
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,940
Hmm,really. How do I put this gently!

541
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:36,596
He's the devil,  he doesn't have a heart,

542
00:45:36,597 --> 00:45:40,309
and one of the things he did for us  was put us in a cage!

543
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:45,390
- Oh, Alvin, he would never do that. - Yeah, guess, you were there, I forgot...

544
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:48,318
- You, you'd better watch out. - I don't need any advice from you.

545
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,677
-But... -But, nothing, Alvin! Ian's taking us straight to the tooooooopppp!

546
00:45:55,635 --> 00:45:58,664
Right, straight to the top. I got it.

547
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:01,932
Yeah, funny. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

548
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:09,875
Hah, hah we are, so, going to destroy those Chipmunks!

549
00:46:09,876 --> 00:46:13,393
- I don't want to destroy them. - Me neither. I just want to hang out with them.

550
00:46:13,394 --> 00:46:17,345
All right, look. If you feel that way ...

551
00:46:17,346 --> 00:46:20,848
- Maybe we should just withdraw from the contest. - What?!

552
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:24,364
I'll put you all in Fedex package and mail you back to whatever tree you came from.

553
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:28,070
Sounds good? Ok then. Take room from the top. Let's go!

554
00:46:31,503 --> 00:46:35,497
Wow, wow stop. Short one in a green dress...

555
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:37,298
- what's your name again? - Eleanor.

556
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:40,923
Yeah, look. I'm losin' you there, you know. Have you always been that short?

557
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:44,283
- I guess. - You've got to work on that.

558
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:47,515
Ok, all right. Let me try somethin' here.

559
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:50,767
Brittany, here. Come up here. No, you two stay back.

560
00:46:50,768 --> 00:46:54,803
A little further.

561
00:46:54,804 --> 00:46:57,245
Oh, yeah! Now that I like!

562
00:46:57,246 --> 00:47:01,069
It's not just because Brittany is more  than mega-ultra superstar than you guys.

563
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:06,384
Good, good. Ok, you know what, let's get a  little more separation. Brittany, stay there.

564
00:47:06,384 --> 00:47:11,472
Get a little more separation from you guys.  Give her some room! Give her some room, guys.

565
00:47:11,506 --> 00:47:15,270
All right. Watch me now.

566
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:18,924
One, two, three ... Watch me. Watch me now.

567
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:31,621
- Hello? - Toby?

568
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:34,835
What are you doing in the house? Where is Aunt Jacky?

569
00:47:34,836 --> 00:47:39,774
Dave, hey Dave, what's happenin'?

570
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,193
Aunt Jacky is in the hospital.

571
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:51,881
I am a little worried. Who's watcin' the boys?

572
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:55,484
I am.

573
00:47:56,344 --> 00:48:00,241
- So, Dave, how is Paris? - Wait, are the boys behaving?

574
00:48:00,242 --> 00:48:03,023
Absolutely. They've been just pitchy.

575
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:07,398
- Toby, what's going on? - Nothing. Don't even worry about it.

576
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:10,788
You know, I know that you're not suppose to be stress down.

577
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:14,366
-So I'm gonna go right now, but it's all good here. Come home soon. Bye. - Toby? Toby?

578
00:48:18,718 --> 00:48:22,610
Nurse, get me out of here!

579
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:25,962
Help...

580
00:48:25,963 --> 00:48:31,258
I don't mean to interrupt your game but I saw you stand up to Ryan when he littered...

581
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:33,234
- That's to guts. - Really?

582
00:48:33,235 --> 00:48:37,284
That's the kind of guy we are looking for. Jeremy Smith, Student body president.

583
00:48:37,285 --> 00:48:39,786
- How do you do, I am ... - International recording star ...

584
00:48:39,787 --> 00:48:43,430
- And litter monitor Simon Seville. - Litter monitor?

585
00:48:43,431 --> 00:48:46,019
Litter monitor,  it's a new position that we've created,

586
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,508
to help raise awareness to the presssing problem  in our society.

587
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:53,372
I agree 99% plus 1.

588
00:48:53,373 --> 00:48:55,603
You did the math.

589
00:48:55,604 --> 00:48:58,618
Simon, I know this is a lot to ask...

590
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:04,674
We are lookin' for a take-charge guy who take charge of this very rewarding position.

591
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,452
What do you say?

592
00:49:08,068 --> 00:49:10,294
Excuse me, everybody. Quick announcement. ðÞ597

593
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:13,567
I'm Simon, I am the Litter monitor. Put your trash in a garbage can. He's out.

594
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:21,658
Hello, ladies. You are probably unaware that you've thrown a racker on the ground, so ...

595
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,283
We gonna just call this morning warning.

596
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:28,101
Carry on.

597
00:49:28,102 --> 00:49:30,588
- Right up, dudes? - What up, pal!

598
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:35,233
Hey, everybody! Check it out. The newest member of the football team.

599
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:40,131
- Soon enough for his first away game. - Guys, don't mess with me.

600
00:49:40,132 --> 00:49:42,784
I talked to couch. You are in.

601
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:45,898
- That's great. Awesome. - So, check it out, hey man...

602
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,791
We are watchin' the new litter monitor.

603
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:51,186
I even wasn't aware that school even had a litter monitor.

604
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:53,909
It don't but don't tell him that.

605
00:49:55,953 --> 00:49:58,788
- Are you goin' to pick it up? - No.

606
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:04,890
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,  I guess I'm going to have to, anyway a tuition.

607
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:11,558
No, I got a suition from littery.

608
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:17,811
Oh, you wanna play that game, do you? Guess what, I can play that game all day long. - Simon!

609
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:19,960
It's a joke, dude.

610
00:50:19,962 --> 00:50:21,561
Litter is no joking matter.

611
00:50:21,562 --> 00:50:24,507
You're the joke. We are messing with you.

612
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:26,962
There is no such a thing as Litter monitor.

613
00:50:26,963 --> 00:50:29,432
What? Big liar, huh!

614
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:34,736
You knew about this, Alvin? Spelling "brother" mean anything to you?

615
00:50:34,737 --> 00:50:37,097
Yes, of course.

616
00:50:37,098 --> 00:50:39,903
Well, yes he has some new brothers now he is on football team.

617
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:45,704
You still hadn't pick up that litter.

618
00:50:45,705 --> 00:50:47,473
Want me to get rid of litter?

619
00:50:47,474 --> 00:50:50,709
- Let's start with you. - Hey, let go, let go. Noooo!!

620
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:55,648
Touch down.

621
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,044
I'll catch with you guys in a second.

622
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:13,988
Ok, I'm a total jerk, I admit.

623
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,842
So are we cool now?

624
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,931
Ok, I'm going to put this behind us ...

625
00:51:31,932 --> 00:51:33,946
- For Theodore's sake. - I know.

626
00:51:33,947 --> 00:51:35,788
That's why I'm giving you my...

627
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:39,935
The Alvin currency that I will be on that stage Friday night.

628
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:42,618
Wait, wait, wait!  Why woudn't you be there?

629
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:47,076
Because I had a...

630
00:51:47,077 --> 00:51:50,253
- What? - I...

631
00:51:50,253 --> 00:51:53,745
- You have a what? - A socker ball game. Now I said it.

632
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:56,643
A football game.

633
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:07,471
- Simon, Alvin is everything alrigt? - Theodore. Hello!

634
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:11,510
Yes, we are fine. Just a little dumpster wrestling.

635
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:14,314
- It's crazy in here. - Right.

636
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,457
Don't worry Theo, everything is gonna be fine.

637
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:26,079
- Alvin, do not miss that Sing all. - Don't worry, Simon.

638
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,329
I'll be there. I can prove.

639
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,701
Hey guys, thanks so much for helping out today.

640
00:52:32,702 --> 00:52:37,513
"Toys for Tots" is a really cool organization. So, everybody is gettin' cool points today.

641
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:42,556
- What's goin' with Theodore? - I have no idðÞa.

642
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:51,291
- Hey Eleanor, why don't you see if Theodore needs some help? - Ok.

643
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,201
- They don't look very comfortable. - My shoes?

644
00:53:15,202 --> 00:53:20,127
- They are not. - But Ian says that I need to work on being higher.

645
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:24,878
Well... I think you look great just the way you are.

646
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:29,160
You do?

647
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,456
Hi, you've reached Dave Seville, please leave a message.

648
00:53:40,457 --> 00:53:44,903
Hi, Toby. This is Julie Ortega, we talked yesterday...

649
00:53:44,904 --> 00:53:49,490
a sort of it. Anyway, the reason I'm calling,

650
00:53:49,491 --> 00:53:54,297
is that I am worried about Theodore, he's been acting a little down lately.

651
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,788
I hope you are going to the "Sing All" Friday.

652
00:53:57,789 --> 00:54:01,269
You know in his down,  Theodore needs all the support he can get.

653
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:08,531
So, I'll see you there. I hope we get a chance to talk. Bye.

654
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:18,856
<i>Ok, folks. Time to get behind your Warriors...<i>

655
00:54:18,857 --> 00:54:23,328
<i>They are listening Eagles down by five,  with only thirty seconds left on the game.<i>

656
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:28,368
<i>- Time is running out for the ... - ...He really needs to make a move here or...<i>

657
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:31,537
<i>This game is over.<i> - I know, put me in.

658
00:54:31,538 --> 00:54:34,098
Hey, put me in.

659
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:40,684
- Time out, Time out. <i>Time out Eagles<i>

660
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:43,670
<i>Number 15 got nine seconds to make it to the game.<i>

661
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:52,878
All right boys, it's time for the big A.

662
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:57,388
I'm going to crush them and burn them to pain. The Alvinator is in the house.

663
00:54:57,389 --> 00:54:58,702
Are you sure about this?

664
00:54:58,802 --> 00:55:00,835
Four to ten say that we need to go for the secret weapon.

665
00:55:00,935 --> 00:55:04,020
Chip is right. He left decision on me.

666
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:07,306
Time to make history, boys.

667
00:55:15,105 --> 00:55:18,658
I'm taking you down, Jennifer.

668
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:21,436
You are the one going down, rat face.

669
00:55:21,436 --> 00:55:24,943
I'm going to crack you like an acorn  and eat you for dinner.

670
00:55:24,944 --> 00:55:27,910
With some fava beans and a nice chianti.

671
00:55:29,174 --> 00:55:33,075
Is this something about my father?

672
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:36,376
One, two ...

673
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:48,048
I'm comin'!

674
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:01,022
That's what I'm talkin' about. Don't hate the pain, hate the game.

675
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,755
I love the hunt, man.

676
00:56:03,756 --> 00:56:07,559
<i>Final score: Eagles 15. The Warriors 14<i>

677
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,591
What you think about that, sucker?

678
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:15,993
- That's what I'm talking about. - You're really muscle chipmunk.

679
00:56:15,994 --> 00:56:20,695
Give me a A, give me an O, give me a W, give me an E, give me a M...

680
00:56:20,696 --> 00:56:23,594
How that spell...awesome.

681
00:56:23,595 --> 00:56:26,505
I am the king of the world.

682
00:56:27,782 --> 00:56:29,680
Party with Alvin.

683
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,319
Everybody to the beach house.

684
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,642
Let's do it.

685
00:56:41,046 --> 00:56:44,560
Look guys,  I just want you to know that I'm here for you.

686
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:49,022
There is plenty of time.I'm gonna go find Alvin. Everything is gonna work out.

687
00:56:49,546 --> 00:56:54,507
-Thank you, Toby. <i>Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Rubin<i>

688
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,004
<i>Thank you, students.Thank you.<i>

689
00:57:02,197 --> 00:57:05,390
Between the Chipmunks and the Chipettes.

690
00:57:09,463 --> 00:57:13,668
Remember students, there are no winners or losers.

691
00:57:13,669 --> 00:57:17,170
Remind me to tell the Chipmunks that one, when we blow up off the stage.

692
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:22,155
...To our school, a chance to win 25 000 dollars to save our music department.

693
00:57:22,156 --> 00:57:26,271
So, without further due, I give you ... the Chipettes.

694
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:31,555
This is it girls, can you believe it.

695
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:34,888
Brittany, your time to shine baby.

696
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:38,552
- Go up there and knock them dead. - Yes sir, I can do it.

697
00:57:39,392 --> 00:57:44,113
- You two I just wanna let you know, not to get in Brittany's way. - Ah, ok.

698
00:58:30,543 --> 00:58:33,268
You like what you see, call Ian Hawke ...

699
00:58:33,372 --> 00:58:37,120
310-555-5309.

700
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:43,320
Don't worry, Simon, Alvin will walk through that door any minute now. Alvin!

701
00:58:49,173 --> 00:58:52,045
I'm back.

702
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:07,805
- Thank you so much. Thank you. - Well done, ladies.

703
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:13,500
And now, let teared for the group that will rock you like a hurricane.

704
00:59:13,501 --> 00:59:17,351
At least that is what many of you students have told me.

705
00:59:17,352 --> 00:59:20,801
Here they are...the Chipmunks.

706
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:26,202
Hey, you know they say there is no "I" in the word "team", and they are right.

707
00:59:26,203 --> 00:59:29,533
But,you know where is "IN" ? Alvin.

708
00:59:31,378 --> 00:59:34,249
Such to be you.  Girls!

709
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,119
Sadly, he's correct.

710
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:42,479
- Did you find him? - Guys, sorry, I searched the whole perimeter.

711
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,043
And I don't know why, but the team is not back yet.

712
00:59:45,044 --> 00:59:47,785
What should we do?

713
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,762
I would ...

714
00:59:51,764 --> 00:59:56,092
I would ask someone...who's not me.

715
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:59,628
I know what we should do.

716
01:00:10,324 --> 01:00:13,107
Hi, everyone.

717
01:00:15,947 --> 01:00:19,442
Our brother, Alvin couldn't be here today.

718
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:24,201
Thing is, we never performed without Alvin ..

719
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:28,575
and we are not starting now.

720
01:00:29,878 --> 01:00:34,640
You can't have two little pigs, you can't have only two musketeers so...

721
01:00:34,982 --> 01:00:38,424
You know you can't have only two chipmunks.

722
01:00:39,425 --> 01:00:40,728
Thank you.

723
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:53,854
I'll take you home.

724
01:01:05,676 --> 01:01:07,266
You hear that, girls?

725
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:11,374
That...is the sound of success.

726
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:17,785
I relize how devastated you...

727
01:01:17,786 --> 01:01:19,945
Chipmunks' funs must be...

728
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,661
So I guess that means that the Chipettes...

729
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:28,507
Come on girls, let's take a victory lap.

730
01:01:30,158 --> 01:01:32,185
Hey, come on guys, let's go.

731
01:01:32,186 --> 01:01:34,225
Britt, we have to.

732
01:01:34,226 --> 01:01:36,338
Let's go.

733
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:42,816
Thank you.

734
01:01:51,724 --> 01:01:53,166
Life is good.

735
01:01:53,951 --> 01:01:56,099
Especially when you're not a loser.

736
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,881
Hey guys? I'm here.

737
01:02:01,616 --> 01:02:02,685
Guys?

738
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:05,330
Oh, great.

739
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:07,034
They are gone, Alvin.

740
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:11,440
- They never gonna forgive me. - You know ... Alvin...

741
01:02:11,441 --> 01:02:15,509
Ian waðÞ right. You don't care about anyone except yourself.

742
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:25,355
And oh, by the way,  I never wanna to win this way.

743
01:02:42,805 --> 01:02:45,154
Simon, are you awake?

744
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,209
Theodore, I don't blame you for being mad.

745
01:03:20,951 --> 01:03:23,243
I ran away from home?

746
01:03:23,244 --> 01:03:26,472
Don't look for me in the Zoo, because I'm not there.

747
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:28,493
Oh, no Theodore ...

748
01:03:34,613 --> 01:03:36,194
Hello?

749
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:39,709
Meerkat family?

750
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:47,860
Is anyone home?

751
01:03:48,649 --> 01:03:52,205
My name is Theodore, I like to be in your family.

752
01:03:59,654 --> 01:04:01,406
Maybe they are hiding.

753
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:02,771
Don't be afraid.

754
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:12,541
You are not a meerkat!

755
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:16,006
Toby, you take the lions, the tigers and the bears ...

756
01:04:16,007 --> 01:04:18,168
Simon and I will take the butterfly room.

757
01:04:19,003 --> 01:04:20,874
Nice Eagle.

758
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,262
Don't move Theodore.

759
01:04:24,263 --> 01:04:26,593
No problem there.

760
01:04:26,594 --> 01:04:29,652
Hang in there, hang little guy. We'll get you out from there.

761
01:04:32,126 --> 01:04:35,457
Ok, we need a plan.  And we need carefuly executed plan.

762
01:04:36,118 --> 01:04:39,099
Or you can just ride in there like a maniac.

763
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:41,937
Theo, watch out.

764
01:04:41,938 --> 01:04:44,333
Hi, I'm Theodore ...

765
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,323
Hey birdy, look up in here, are you hungry? Catch this "A"?

766
01:04:49,324 --> 01:04:51,797
That's for appetizer.

767
01:04:54,677 --> 01:04:57,482
Let's all just relax, and we talk this out, ok!

768
01:04:58,648 --> 01:05:03,839
Look, I guess why you want Theodore, I do,

769
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:07,438
but I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

770
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:09,544
He's my brother.

771
01:05:09,545 --> 01:05:14,916
Not let him know that, because I've been a such a big jerk lately.

772
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:21,064
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

773
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:25,212
Not really.

774
01:05:25,443 --> 01:05:27,101
I got you, Alvin.

775
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,933
Watch to the eagle.

776
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:39,129
Their only mortal enemy is a piggy elephant. Luckily I speak a little habitat.

777
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:45,751
I think it's working.

778
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,593
Guys, that was huge.

779
01:05:58,191 --> 01:06:03,081
He's right.Now we are one for all and three for one?

780
01:06:04,424 --> 01:06:06,419
Come on, Simon, hug it out.

781
01:06:07,276 --> 01:06:09,249
You know I'm sorry, Sy.

782
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,132
Sy, don't make me up to kiss you because  I'll do it.

783
01:06:14,133 --> 01:06:16,671
I don't care.

784
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:21,197
Here come the lips! The makeout train leaving the station.

785
01:06:24,061 --> 01:06:26,236
I think after all, I'll take that hug.

786
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:38,628
Justine, call Ian Hawke.

787
01:06:38,629 --> 01:06:42,258
310-555-5309.

788
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:45,255
Morris, get me that Ian Hawke on the phone.

789
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,207
There you are.

790
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:53,259
My sweet little money makers.

791
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:58,455
Do you remember when I told you that I would make you all big stars?

792
01:07:00,252 --> 01:07:03,320
Well, guess who's opening up for Britney Spears at Staples Center tonight?

793
01:07:05,014 --> 01:07:06,805
Am I dreamin'? oh, my gosh!

794
01:07:06,806 --> 01:07:09,723
Oh, wait, we can't.  We'll miss the school concert!

795
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:13,209
That's correct. You will miss the school contest.

796
01:07:15,691 --> 01:07:23,215
It was never about that stupid school contest, it was always about making Brittany a star.

797
01:07:23,216 --> 01:07:25,182
That's what you wanted, right?

798
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,656
- well...yes. - Tonight is your big chance.

799
01:07:30,657 --> 01:07:32,845
It's all about you, Brittany.

800
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:35,332
But what about Jeanette and Eleanor?

801
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:38,505
They can sing backups, I got them some staff too.

802
01:07:39,937 --> 01:07:45,682
- We are her sisters. - We either sing together or not at all!

803
01:07:46,652 --> 01:07:49,612
Ok, fine. All I ever needed is the B-girl.

804
01:07:52,013 --> 01:07:54,112
Ian, I won't do it without them.

805
01:07:56,964 --> 01:07:59,672
Ok, fine, fine. Let's move on to Plan B.

806
01:07:59,673 --> 01:08:02,671
Ok, who likes barbecue?

807
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:09,188
Because I know this awesome little barbecue restaurant in the valley,  that makes the best roasted chipmunks.

808
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:15,455
Real tasty. Unless of course, you wanna sing?

809
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:29,632
Welcome to West Eastman, and thank you for supporting music in our schools.

810
01:08:29,753 --> 01:08:35,255
Now remember,the group you pick tonight, will win 25000 dollars for their school.

811
01:08:36,705 --> 01:08:40,691
Now there's got a lot of acts, and we have to  trow heat off by nine-thirdy so ..

812
01:08:40,692 --> 01:08:47,889
without no further due, representing Orange girl put your hands together for...Lou Rosarro.

813
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:17,808
We meet again. You wanna a piece of it?

814
01:09:17,908 --> 01:09:19,753
Eagle.

815
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,694
Ian Hawke?

816
01:09:24,695 --> 01:09:26,864
I'll take that.

817
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:31,023
I didn't realise that you are runnin' a low life.

818
01:09:31,024 --> 01:09:35,918
- Alvin, - Brittany? - Aren't you guys still interest?

819
01:09:35,919 --> 01:09:38,660
I'm not gonna be able to perform tonight.

820
01:09:38,661 --> 01:09:41,680
What about the music department? The whole school is counting on you.

821
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:45,183
I know, I know. I had to listen to you about Ian.

822
01:09:45,184 --> 01:09:46,268
Don't tell me...

823
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:49,120
Yes, he locked us in a cage.

824
01:09:49,826 --> 01:09:54,644
This is this the biggest you have? I have a licence to call and asked for the biggest thing, that's not the biggest what you got.

825
01:09:54,645 --> 01:09:56,560
I will go and take the news to Dr Rubin.

826
01:09:57,668 --> 01:09:59,986
- Brittany? - Alvin, don't move.

827
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:02,654
You got it. Brittany, I'm comin' to get you.

828
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:05,421
Simon, how do you know to hit a lock?

829
01:10:05,422 --> 01:10:06,363
Roger that.

830
01:10:06,364 --> 01:10:09,216
I need to get to those girls. Fast.

831
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:11,061
I know how.

832
01:10:24,999 --> 01:10:28,965
The third number is notoriously the hardest to crack ...

833
01:10:28,967 --> 01:10:31,507
I'm assuming that provide number that we can't assume...

834
01:10:31,891 --> 01:10:35,585
The first two numbers are one. I got to go with one.

835
01:10:35,619 --> 01:10:36,864
It opened.

836
01:10:36,964 --> 01:10:38,618
- All right,  girls ... - Ian is coming.

837
01:10:38,619 --> 01:10:40,410
Put the phone back, hurry!

838
01:10:40,411 --> 01:10:41,870
Get ready to be fabulous.

839
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:43,404
We are ready.

840
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:48,228
Yeah, you're better be. Because tonight's performance it's gonna put me back on the top.

841
01:10:56,589 --> 01:10:59,062
And now please welcome...Cherisse.

842
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:20,666
Driver man, take me to the ArðÞna. The VIP entrance.

843
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:25,011
Tout de suite. A little moonroofs actions.

844
01:11:25,012 --> 01:11:28,924
Moonroofs are go, moonroofs, roofs, roofs...

845
01:11:28,925 --> 01:11:31,174
Champagne.

846
01:11:31,175 --> 01:11:33,821
If you don't mind ... If I do...

847
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:39,544
You know why I don't mind if I do? Because tonight we've got to toast ...

848
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:44,334
To a very special someone, named me.

849
01:11:44,335 --> 01:11:48,469
They said I couldn't do it,  they said I never bounce back.

850
01:11:49,062 --> 01:11:52,710
Guess what? Time to kiss my ass.

851
01:11:55,327 --> 01:12:00,717
A toast! To the ladies who gonna make the world forget about the Chipmu...

852
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:10,122
No, no, no, no! What are doin'? Alvin.

853
01:12:11,052 --> 01:12:13,712
Hi Ian! Good to see you. You look alright!

854
01:12:16,898 --> 01:12:18,733
No, no! I signed a contract.

855
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:22,160
- Jump, Jeanette. -Wait! - I'm not really good...

856
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,840
I bet it you don't perform.

857
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,769
- Gas, Alvin. - You got it!

858
01:12:27,475 --> 01:12:30,761
Hey, Ian! In the words of McDonald, you're fired!

859
01:12:44,344 --> 01:12:47,917
- Hey guys, any sayin' about Alvin yet? - No Alvin and no Chipettes.

860
01:12:47,918 --> 01:12:52,052
Just Dr Rubin and the entire school are counting on us.

861
01:12:54,534 --> 01:12:59,099
Well, you know...you know don't worry everything will work out...ish.

862
01:13:08,557 --> 01:13:10,230
- Faster Alvin! - Don't worry...

863
01:13:10,231 --> 01:13:13,015
I'm gonna get a real help from my friend, stay there.

864
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:16,328
Roger that Alvin.

865
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:18,219
Just like I'm back on the racetrack.

866
01:13:20,005 --> 01:13:22,008
Where you going? What are you doing?

867
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:28,060
Wait 'til I tell everybody back home that I've saved Alvin Seville.

868
01:13:28,061 --> 01:13:30,352
I think I owe you an apology about Ian.

869
01:13:30,353 --> 01:13:33,174
Stick with me Britt. I'll never stay alive.

870
01:13:34,637 --> 01:13:36,953
Oh yeah , I'll never got to do that.

871
01:13:40,443 --> 01:13:43,145
I got to say, he's definitely persistant.

872
01:13:46,435 --> 01:13:48,873
- We got to lose him. - Hang on.

873
01:13:50,587 --> 01:13:53,269
I got a plan, jump on a count of three!

874
01:13:53,353 --> 01:13:55,423
Three.

875
01:13:55,777 --> 01:13:59,130
- Oh, that's it. - I didn't like heights.

876
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:02,214
- Keep your tight Jeanette. - Bring my girls right to me.

877
01:14:02,215 --> 01:14:05,677
- We need a  remote. - Guys, I know what have to do.

878
01:14:05,678 --> 01:14:07,610
Hats off on Ian.

879
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:15,935
The remote.

880
01:14:17,387 --> 01:14:19,029
I can't reach it.

881
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,188
I'm doing it. Hold my ankles.

882
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,108
I got it.

883
01:14:27,636 --> 01:14:29,622
I got it?

884
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:33,331
- Well done, Jen. - Top work, Jeanette.

885
01:14:34,695 --> 01:14:38,406
Hey Ian, you were wrong. I don't need these.

886
01:14:46,235 --> 01:14:48,799
- Bye bye. - Adios, Ian.

887
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:52,722
And now, for our final act of the night...

888
01:14:52,723 --> 01:14:57,682
And, listen we have last second change to the line up, but we don't think you gonna be to disapointed.

889
01:14:57,683 --> 01:15:01,966
Representing West Eastman it's...the Chipmunks.

890
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:08,433
We may have to go up there , Theodore.

891
01:15:16,032 --> 01:15:18,454
If there are no Chipmunks we gonna have to move on.

892
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,583
I don't wanna be good again.

893
01:15:26,602 --> 01:15:28,220
I'm sorry, but we haðÞe to move on.

894
01:15:35,435 --> 01:15:38,128
I'm not a Chipmunk, as you can see.

895
01:15:45,824 --> 01:15:48,549
Where is the music you loser? Where is the music? Music?!

896
01:15:52,928 --> 01:15:55,878
Ok, I got to song.

897
01:16:35,777 --> 01:16:37,894
Well, that...was huge.

898
01:16:41,919 --> 01:16:44,908
Thank you.

899
01:16:45,825 --> 01:16:48,833
The Chipmunks are in the building.

900
01:16:49,611 --> 01:16:52,447
- It is the Chipettes! - Alvin.

901
01:16:56,455 --> 01:16:58,773
Hello, West Eastman.

902
01:16:59,362 --> 01:17:02,511
I'm puttin' her down. Hang on.

903
01:17:03,044 --> 01:17:04,789
- Alvin. - Give me the high-five, brothers.

904
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:11,851
Ladies and gentlemen, representing West Eastman  it is my great pleasure...

905
01:17:13,843 --> 01:17:16,042
This is such an honor.

906
01:17:16,043 --> 01:17:18,702
- For you or for us? - For us.

907
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:24,898
We get it! Come up, guys.

908
01:17:27,104 --> 01:17:30,204
And now I give you the Chipettes and the Chipmunks.

909
01:18:54,252 --> 01:18:57,573
Thank you.

910
01:18:59,524 --> 01:19:04,768
Hey everybody, it's clear that we have a winner of the 25000 dollars ...

911
01:19:04,769 --> 01:19:06,609
And it's West Eastman High.

912
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:10,093
Guys, we did it.

913
01:19:18,647 --> 01:19:20,798
It's all yours, Dr Rubin.

914
01:19:25,296 --> 01:19:33,005
Ladies and Gentlemen, The Staples Center is proud to welcome the Chipettes.

915
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:39,758
Hi everyone, I'm Jeanette and I am Eleanor.

916
01:19:39,759 --> 01:19:41,759
And I'm Brittany.

917
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,629
And we are the Chipettes.

918
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:50,239
One, two, three.

919
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:22,433
- Dave, you are dancing. - You are even good, Dave. Yeah!

920
01:20:22,434 --> 01:20:25,286
- Welcome home. - So, did you miss us?

921
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,415
Of course I missed you. You are my boys.

922
01:20:29,044 --> 01:20:32,460
Ok Dave, just did how much you miss us. There are now six of us.

923
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:33,701
Alvin, what did you say?

924
01:20:33,702 --> 01:20:36,821
The Chipettes need a place to cresche , right?

925
01:20:36,822 --> 01:20:42,245
So I said that you said, they can stay with us for as long as they needed to.

926
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:49,244
Ok, this works for Dave. Everybody shake what your mama gave ya!

01:21:26,365 --> 01:21:29,370
Look at you. All ready for bed.

928
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:33,036
Looks like the Chipettes had a good influence.

929
01:21:33,037 --> 01:21:35,375
Thanks, Dave.

930
01:21:35,376 --> 01:21:38,241
Ok guys now lights out.

931
01:21:38,341 --> 01:21:39,270
Good night everybody.

932
01:21:43,374 --> 01:21:45,298
- Alvin? - I'm not tired.

933
01:21:45,299 --> 01:21:47,540
Sorry, but you've got school tomorrow.

934
01:21:49,685 --> 01:21:52,868
Not tired.

935
01:21:53,749 --> 01:21:55,848
Alvin, come on. It's time for bed.

936
01:21:57,389 --> 01:21:59,035
Not tired.

937
01:22:02,879 --> 01:22:05,720
Still not tired. More light.

938
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,876
Tired. Just kidding. Much more light.

939
01:22:07,976 --> 01:22:10,227
Alvin, that's it! Don't make me come over there...

940
01:22:15,714 --> 01:22:19,120
Oh boy, I finally got relly, really tired.

941
01:22:19,121 --> 01:22:20,106
Good night, Dave.

942
01:22:20,107 --> 01:22:23,442
