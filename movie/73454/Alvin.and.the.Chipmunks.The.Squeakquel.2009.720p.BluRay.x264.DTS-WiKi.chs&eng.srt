我想和孩子们说说话.

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,580
我刚刚给你打的镇静剂将在一分钟后起效
I just gave you a sedative that will take effect in about one minute

我只是还要呆在这里一段时间

在我离开这里之前

我会安排杰克阿姨和你们呆在一起
I made arrangements for my aunt Jackie to come and stay with you.

30
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,320
谁是杰克阿姨
Who is Aunt Jackie?

31
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,130
就是在圣诞节给我们邮递美味的爆米花那个
The one who sent us those mail package of yummy popcorn for Christmas.

38
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,340
- 你? -我指望你了
- You are? - I'm counting on you.

39
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,660
大卫 等一下 为什么要交付给他?
Dave, wait a minute.  Why is he in charge?

40
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,460
他指望我了 - 大卫,求你了 别死啊
- He's counting on me. - Dave, please, don't die.

41
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,490
他只是睡觉 他刚刚打了镇定剂

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,130
噢 镇定剂

Excuse me, I'm here to escort the Chipmunks home.

44
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,830
我们不离开大卫 我就呆在这里了

求你了 走吧

48
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,460
你越是坚持 他就越好不了
More stress you put on persistent the longer will take him to recover.

49
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,520
你太慢了 姥姥
You are too slow, nanny.

50
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,380
你阻止不了我的 没有大卫我哪里也不去
You'll never hit me! I'm not going anywhere without Daaa...

51
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,140
梦信徒 和归国皇后...
dream believer, and a homecoming queen...

52
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,940
我希望为了你他能在整个飞行途中都不会醒来
I hope for your sake he stays asleep for the entire flight.

53
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,810
也许你应该再给他打一针 以防万一
Maybe you should give him another shot. Just to be sure.

54
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,060
有什么主意让我们找到杰克?
Any ideas on how we gonna find aunt Jackie?

55
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,320
跟我来

- Popcorn! - Who's sending to Theodore's?

61
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,060
每个人都有份 给我一个拥抱先
Oh, there is a plenty for everyone. Give a hug first.

62
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,710
过来这里 你这个老泰迪熊
Come over here, you old teddy bear.

63
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,400
我不是那么喜欢拥抱
I'm not really much of a hugger.

64
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,940
孩子们 我介绍个人你们认识
Oh, boys, I want you to meet someone.

65
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,180
这是我的孙子托比 托比?
This is my grandson Toby. Toby?

66
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,410
嗨 我是希欧多.

67
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,010
- 托比? - 怎么了?

- The boys! - Oh, hey! Hey,how are you? I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.

托比现在和我住在一起
Toby is living with me

70
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,760
直到他想到他以后要怎么办
'til he figures out what he want to do with his life.

71
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,440
现在看来就成天用他的大拇指 哔哔哔
So far that means going beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with his thumbs the all day.

72
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,420
.重要的是我的手指哔-哔-哔 
For the record goin' beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with my thumbs right now is

73
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,020
一直保持第一名
keeping me in first place, and that's important.

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,060
- 托比拿上包 - 什么包?
- Toby get the bags. - What bags?

75
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,860
- 拿行李 ..噢 行李 对了 让我把那些也带上....
- The lighters. Get the luggages. - Oh, the lug, right. Let me get those...

76
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,780
- 托比! -快刹车 快刹车
- Toby! - Get the brake! Get the brake!

77
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,550
我很好 不用担心
I'm fine.Don't worry!

78
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,170
真抱歉 杰克阿姨 她还好吗?
I'm so sorry, aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry. Is she goin' to be ok?

79
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,160
别担心我 我会很快回去的
Don't worry about me, I will be home with no time.

80
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,430
我可是不那么肯定
I wouldn't be so sure.

81
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,180
那是一个意外 我发誓
It was an accident, I swear.

82
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,080
在那里 好几次这样了
Been there, done that. Several times.

83
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,500
我在想他现在会照顾我们吗?
I guess he will be taking care of us now?

84
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,190
我坦率的说他肯定会让我们离开的
I'll take frankly foster of five hundred please-outs.

85
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,290
别担心 我完全能做好
Ain't no problem. I can totally do this.

86
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,150
我以前把我的猫照顾得很好
I took care of my cat...

87
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,130
直到它跑了
until it ran away.

88
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,460
"逃跑”也许是说难听了点
Well, 'ran away' is kind of strong wordin'

89
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,900
我想是它想有自己的空间吧
 I think he just wanted his space.

90
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,190
但我还在附近看到过它
I still see him around neighbourhood.

91
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,480
你知道吗 它喜欢用爪子抓我
You know, he like hisses and claws at me.

92
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,350
这说明我们还是很亲密的
But I think that's his way of saying we're still tight, you know.

93
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,630
你们真不用担心这个
You guys are nothing to worry about, seriously.

94
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,810
我不会和大卫一样的 你们知道 大卫已经离开了
'Cause, I'm not gonna be like Dave, you know, Dave is gone.

95
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,250
不在了?
Gone?

96
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,700
不是不在了
Not gone, not gone, guys

97
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,960
他还没有死 他还活着呢
He is not dead. He's very much alive.

98
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,070
他肯定还会回来的 我要把他的房子弄得很温暖等他回来
He completely coming back. I'm just gonna be in his room, keepin' his bed warm.

99
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,080
你做你的事我做我的事 我意思是说你可以当我不存在的
I'll be doin'my thing,you'll be doin' your thing. I mean, you don't need to know that I'm there.

100
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,970
可我们知道你在这儿 这才是关键
We supposed to know that you there, that's the whole idea.

101
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,210
是的 你们知道我在 我只是....
Yeah, ok absolutely. You know that I'm there,I'm just...

102
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,300
我不会像这样:
I'm not gonna be like:

103
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,560
我什么都懂 你去做这些 你去做那些
I know everything, and you do this, and you do that.

104
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,990
真的
I mean that.

105
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,050
好的 那就这样吧
All right, let's do this.

106
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,750
伙计
Oh, boy!

107
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,570
希欧多我们会很好的
Theodore, we gonna be just fine.

108
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,970
重要的是我们还活着
The important thing is...we're all still alive.

109
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,600
也许做一张 "康复"卡片会让大卫快点好起来
Well, maybe my "Get Well" card will  help Dave to come faster.

110
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,580
我们拿多点闪粉
It needs just a touch more glitter.

111
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,220
那很好 谁饿了?
That should do it. Who's hungry?

112
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,330
我 我 .我们吃东西吧
- Uh, uh me, me! - Let's eat.

113
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,360
Nada 找到什么了吗
Nada. Find anything?

114
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,150
艾尔文?这里是美食城吗?
It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

115
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,600
嘿 奶酪球在烤箱里
Hello, the cheese balls are in the heat house.

116
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,470

117
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,040
嘿 你在干什么?
Hey, what are you doing in here?

118
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,650
奶酪球?
A cheese ball?

119
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,440
给我点时间 很快
Thumb boy, give me a second, real quick.

120
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,470
我现在真的需要集中精神了
Alvin, I really need to focus, right now

121
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,440
我的重量级冠军已经近在咫尺了
because I'm one knockout away from my heavy weight title.

122
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,180
我们也能玩吗?
Can we play as well?

123
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,190
你知道 我不想伤害你
You know, I don't want to  hurt your feelings

124
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,460
你也不想看到任何一个受伤是吧
but else you don't want see anyone get hurt and there gonna be fistsufferean flyin'.

125
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,510
我们来玩MONOPOLY吧
We can play monopoly.

126
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,880
我们成天都和大卫玩这个
We play monopoly with Dave all the time.

127
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,510
听起来不错 我们也应该这样
That sounds funny. We should do that sometime right.

128
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,460
现在 我要回去像蝴蝶蜜蜂一样勤劳工作啦
Now, I got to back and floatin' like a butterfly and stinging like the bee.

129
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,310
我们不需要托比 希欧多
Who needs Toby, Theodore.

130
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,650
你有我们了

我想吐
I'm gonna puke.

133
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,470
如果大卫在这里的话他会怎么说呢?
Do you know what Dave would say if he were here right now?

134
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,290
我想一定气到他
But I think it means to come more from the belly.

135
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,730
过来 别吵
Get together. Be cool.

136
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,280
大家好 伙计们 是我
- Helllooooo? - Boys, it's me.

137
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,790
大卫?
Dave?

138
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,390
我想你接了电话后
Well, I guess since you've answered the phone

139
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,270
应该还没有把房子烧了
you haven't burned down the house yet.

140
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,680
大卫.请相信我 好吧
- Have a little faith, Dave. - Yes.

141
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,930
救我
Mayday!

142
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,990
怎么了
What was that?

143
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,290
不要告诉他
Don't stress him out.

144
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,640
噢...是杰克.
- Oh, that was... Aunt Jackie.

145
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,600
是 她给我们做了5道美味的食物
Yeah, she's making us a tasty five-course meal.

146
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,310
真的?我能和她聊聊吗
Really? Can I talk to her?

147
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,170
她去练习钢管舞了
She's practising her pole dancing.

148
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,430
钢管舞?
Pole dancing?

149
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,630
但是 那谁做的晚餐?
But, what happened with making dinner.

150
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,830
到底怎么了?
Guys, what's going on?

151
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,450
大卫.我得挂了 - 艾尔文我不是开玩笑的
- Gotta go, Dave. - Alvin, I'm not kidding!

152
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,270
快点好哟 - 艾尔文!!!
- Get better! - Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

153
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,680
没人比他做得更好了
Yep, nobody does that better than him.

154
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
托比,.醒醒
Toby, Toby wake up.

155
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,380
不好意思
Oh,sorry

156
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,930
没事 怎么了
No, that's okay. What is it?

157
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,650
我做噩梦了
I...I had a nightmare.

158
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,930
噩梦 我最讨厌做恶梦了
Oh,the nightmares.I hate the nightmares.

159
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,150
梦到什么了
What was it?

160
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,410
我梦到我们不再有家庭了
I dreamt that we didn't have a family anymore.

161
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,540
希欧多, 那不可能的
Theodore, that couldn't happen.

162
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,550
不会的 你太紧张了
No, you guys are tight.

163
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,420
没人会把我们分开
Nothing could ever separate you.

164
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,370
就算老鹰来了也不能
Less like an eagle swooped down from the sky like caw-caaaw!

165
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,650
这从没有发生过
Which couldn't happen ever.

166
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,520
为什么你认为会发生这样的事呢?
Why would you think that ever happened?

167
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,660
你知道...老鹰在费城
you know...The Eagles are in Philadelphia.

168
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,700
好梦
Sweet dreams.

169
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,040
- 托比,让它停下来 你在干嘛
- Toby, make it stop. - What are you doing?

170
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,110
这钟有点毛病 关不掉了
There is something wrong with the clock. It won't shut up.

171
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,510
这样我没发睡觉
I can't sleep.

172
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,130
那是因为它是个闹钟
That's the point. It's an alarm clock.

173
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,730
它能让你们早起
It helps you wake up early in the morning.

174
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,980
为什么会有人想要早起?
Why anyone wanna wake up early?

175
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,940
去上学啊 你8点要到那里
For the school, you got to be there by eight.

176
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,980
早上?
In the morning?

177
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,470
听着 我可不想像你一样早起
Look, I don't like any others early anything more than you do.

178
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,140
但这是我们的事情,艾尔文
But we are in this together, Alvin

179
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,690
你越早到学校
Soon you get to school

180
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,420
我就能越早回来睡觉
soon I get to compound and get back to sleep.

181
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,540
你意思是说你不和我们一起呆在学校?
You mean you don't stayin' with us in school?

182
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,960
是的,我学习造句的日子已经过去了
No, no , no.I've done my time making very much.

183
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,700
不过学校很有趣 是吧??
But school is fun, right?

184
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,550
有趣?我想是吧?
Fun? Well, i guess Maybe, it's...fun-ish...

185
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,590
嘿 那是我的猫
Hey, it's my cat!

186
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,650
嘿 小家伙 是我 记得吗
Hey kiddy it's me, remember?

187
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,160
我对你很好的啊
I treated you good.

188
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,180
我们到了
There, here we go.

189
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,830
第一天上学玩得开心点 3点左右再来接你们
Enjoy your first day in school. See you around three-ish.

190
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,800
知道了 就像在公园一样
We got it. This got to be a walk in the park.

191
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,470
我害怕
I'm frightening.

192

194
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,100
老鹰 老鹰来了
- Eagle. - Go eagle!

195
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,610
这可不怎么好玩
That wasn't very fun-ish.

196
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,040
你们一定就是新来的了
You must be our new students.

197
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,250
我是罗宾博士 这里的校长

198

我们是花鼠

199
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,930
是的 我能从你们的外表上看出来

There was a minute left and we were down by two ...

203
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,020
当时我在想:
And I mind couch:

204
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,370
就算我腿断了也不要紧 让我上 我一定能赢...
I don't care if my leg is broken, put me in, I can win this...

205
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,900
我从没有放弃过
I never get tired of that story.

206
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,280
所以我自己几乎不能站立...
So I hobbled out barely able to stand...

207
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,660
我有提到我的腿断了吗?

找人量一下他们的身高才行
Somebody's have to knock these guys down to size.

221
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,740

We grew up in a small town, population 300 and ...

269
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,330
真的?那太棒了
Really? That's fascinating. Great!

270
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,720
好了 现在好好表现吧
All right, impress me!

271
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,870
一.二.三
One, two, three.

272
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,470
女孩们
Girls, girls, girls.

273
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,010
猜一下谁会成为了全世界第一的花鼠组合?
Guess who just became the number one Chipmunks' band in whole dang world?

274
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,620
伊恩 霍克
Ian Hawke

275
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,190
什么时候我们可以和花鼠们见面
So, when can we meet the Chipmunks?

276
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,880
好问题 答案是...
That's an excellent question  and the excellent answer is...

277
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,890
我已经不再代表艾尔文和花鼠们了
I don't really represent Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

278
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,290
噢 怎么回事?
- Oh, no. Wha-what happened?

279
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,400
很老套的故事
Oh, classic tale.

280
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,810
当我见他们的时候很可爱 天真 他们什么也没有
Sweet and innocent when I met them, they had nothing

281
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,020
之后 我尽了全力让他们成为了摇滚明星
...and then I work my butt of to make them rock stars and...

282
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,070
后来他们变了
They changed.

283
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,720
变成坏蛋
Turned out to be like bad cheese.

284
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,400
.不 多可怕啊
- No. - That's terrible.

285
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,640
我一直把艾尔文当成我自己的儿子一样对待
I know. I mean, I treated Alvin like my own son, you know.

286
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,230
而他们就这样离我而去
And he just goes and spits on me.

287
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,760
实际
Literally

288
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,410
我有的只是他们留给我的一脸口水
He filled his chipmunk's cheeks with saliva and just had at it.

289
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,810
可别让我提起西门了 幸好不是希欧多
- Don't even get me started about Simon. - But not Theodore, right?

290
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,840
这可爱的还更需要注意
It's the cuddly ones you have to watch for.

291
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,050
为什么我们要谈他们呢? 
But why we are talkin' about them for, c'mon?

292
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,610
他们已经完蛋了 被解雇了..
They are over, fired, nobledeute (noble death)...

293
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,320
花鼠们的蠢说法
Chipmunks' stupid sayin'.

294
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,120
不过...
But...

295
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,310
笨女鼠们
Girl Chipmunks' stupid sayin'...

296
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,480
请系好安全带
Fasten your seat belts!

297
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,710
我看着的他眼睛说 Jay Beyonce在哪里?
So I eyed Jay Z's eyes right, and I said:  Jay, where is Beyonce?

298
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,370
然后他说:
And he says :

299
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,890
她正拿着一碟子的 奶酪球 我一转身
She's holding a plate  full of cheese balls, turn around...

300
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,470
猜是什么
And guess what..

301
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,540
还真是她 大卫让我看着他们
- She was. - PS, Dave left me in charge.

302
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,210
我们每天晚上会呆到10点
We stay up to ten every night.

303
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,910
看看我能做些什么
Look what I can do.

304
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,610
你真是Theadorable
You're Theadorable.

305
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,000
不好意思 没事 没有伤到我
- I am so sorry. - That's cool. No harm done.

306
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,920
还没完 女孩们 我想和他们私聊下
Not yet. Girls, please, private conference.

307
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,100
谢谢
Thank you.

308
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,720
听着 摇滚明星
Listen up, rock stars.

309
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,660
如果你们再敢和那些女孩子聊天
If you talk to those girls again

310
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,490
你们就死定了
you're dead.

311
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,390
如果你们再看那些女孩子一眼
If you look at those girls again

312
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,480
你们就死定了
you're dead.

313
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,470
如果你们再敢想想那些女孩儿.....
If you even think about those girls...

314
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,050
你有想她们吗? 有啊 我现在想着她们
- Are you thinking about them? - Well, I am now.

315
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,240
好 你完蛋了
- That's it. - You are dead!

316
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,850
抓住他 砸死你 该死的
Get them, c'mon! Crack you, you dirty rats!

317
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,190
散开
Scatter!

318
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,410
那边 这边 我在跑
- That way. Over there! - I'm runin'.

319
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,790
嘿 笨蛋 有本事就来抓我
Hey Dumbo, catch me if you can.

320
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,730
你死定了 没有
- You are dead! - Not!

321
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,590
加时吧
It's stretching time!

322
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,500
天啊
Oh, boy.

323
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,570
老鹰
Eagle.

324
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,110
老鹰 老鹰 抓住他
- Eagle! Eagle! - Get him.

325
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,830
快！快！ 这边
- Move! Move! - This way.

326
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,870
抓到你了 .等等..出来
- Gotcha. - Wait, wait, come up...

327
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,260
漩涡来了 C'mon 这可不太......
- It's swirley time. - C'mon, c'mon guys, this is not so...

328
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,910
求你了 求你了
Please, please!

329
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,760
有让你好看的 谢谢
- That's a good look for you! - Thank you.

330
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,980
我不会游泳 帮帮我 抓住西门
- I can't swim. Help. - Grab on Simon!

331
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,280
还好吗?
You okay?

332
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:04,040
恩 还好 你刚刚把我从马桶里救了出来
Well, uh, considering that you just saved me  from drowning in a toilet...

333
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,420
我嘛 很好
I'm, uh, pretty good.

334
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,530
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

335
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,040
艾尔文, 艾尔文!  我们不要用暴力解决
Alvin, Alvin!  We're not gonna solve anything with violence!

336
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,150
这是条肥老鼠 闭嘴
- It's the fatty ratty. - Cut it out!

337
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,300
这老鼠一定在树干里堆了很多垃圾
- This rat has serious junk in the trunk.

338
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,170
是啊 那么多脂肪
Yeah, little fatty.

339
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,580
西门这样会不会让我的臀部看起来小一点
Simon, does this make my butt look smaller?

340
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,760
希欧多 你的臀部看起来很好了
Theodore, your butt looks fine.

341
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,130
那些小子只是一群笨蛋
Those guys are just some jerks.

342
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,880
你威胁他们说要在他们体内建巢?
You threatened to climb inside of him and build a nest.

343
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,230
有点过分了而且甚至事实上也不太可能
That was out of line and not even sure that is physically impossible.

344
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,960
我应该将你们三个停职 可以
- I should suspend all three of you. - Please do.

345
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,800
我还有更好的主意
Instead I have the better idea.

346
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,380
由于预算的削减
Due to budget cutbacks

347
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,510
我们的音乐规划可能会受到影响
we are in jeopardy of loosing our beloved music program.

348
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,590
- 太可怕了 - 我知道
- That's awful. - I know.

349
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,170
但是 我还是有一个小小的希望
But, there is one small ray of hope.

350
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,630
这里每年都会举办一个音乐比赛
Every year the District sponsors a music competition...

351
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,300
赢家将会得到25 000美金
And the winner school receives 25,000 dolars.

352
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,610
如果我们赢了 我们便可以拯救我们的音乐计划
If we win, we can save our program.

353
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,330
你想我们去表演
And you want us to perform?

354
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,350
我在想你到底是不是我们的歌迷了呢
I begin to think that you are a fan?

355
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,260
你们可以考虑一下
Why don't you sleep on it.

356
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,750
等等 好极了
- Wait. - Great.

357
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,950
答应我什么也不要说出去
Promise me that you won't say anything.

358
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,590
校长一定会赞成的 如果让Mr Fencle发现了可...
The principal has a certain image to uphold. If Mr Fencle ever finds out about this ta...

359
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,920
我真是不敢相信你们就坐在我的办公室里 
I just can't believe this, that you are actually sitting in my office.

360
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,680
我有你们全部的CD唱片
I have all of your CDs.

361
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,710
我甚至到丹佛去看过你们 所以我有这个
I even went to see you last year in Denver. That's where I got this.

362
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,900
那是我的生日 但是我就像.... 花鼠们 
It was my birthday. And I was like...Oh, the Chipmunks!

363
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,010
所以 如何? 你们会代表我们学校出演吗
So, what you say?  Will you represent our school?

364
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,560
实话说 听起来挺不错的
Honestly suspension sounds pretty good to me.

365
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,010
艾尔文? 一个对所有 还是3对一
Come on Alvin? One for all, and three for one.

366
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,210
希欧多 精辟 非常精辟 把我们算上
Well put, Theodore.Very well put. Count us in.

367
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,250
飞吧老鹰
Go Eagles!

368
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,270
老鹰 在哪里?
Eagles? Where?

369
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,480
阁楼轿车
Ah, the penthouse limo.

370
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,800
真独特
Très exclusivo.

371
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,780
那个不是吉娃娃吗 电影上那个
Hey, isn't that that Chihuahua? Ya know, from the movie?

372
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:45,400
嗯 是 当然是他 很多大牌住在这里
Uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, of course it is. Yeah, a lot of big names live here.

373
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,310
- 哦. Como esta?   -我一定要他的签名
- Oh. Como esta? - I must have his autograph!

374
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,700
噢 噢 布莱特妮 你想成为明星 想要表现得像个明星
Whoa, whoa, Brittany. You wanna be a star, act like a star.

375
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,230
你不需要他们的签名 而是你签名给他们
You don't get autographs, you give 'em.

376
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,820
噢 好的
Oh, right.

377
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,980
嘿 看那边 乔纳斯兄弟
Hey, look over there, there's a couple of the Jonas Brothers.

378
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,700
-在哪里?  我看不到  -到了
- Where? I don't see them. - Here we are.

379
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,800
快去我房间
Ok, let's scootin' to my apartment ...

380
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,670
噢 该死的
What? Did I... Oh, darn it! Darn it to heck!

381
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,120
什么?怎么了? 女孩们 真不好意思..
- What? What's wrong? - Girls, I apologise but ...

382
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,560
我好像把钥匙留在办公室了
I seem to left my keys back in my office.

383
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,270
你们其中一个能钻进去从里面把门打开吗
What if one of you shroud through that mail slot and open it up for me from the inside?

384
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,710
我来
I'll do it.

385
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,710
我卡住了
I'm stuck.

386
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,330
好 我帮你 我帮你
All right, I got you, I got you!

387
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,690
不会很难啊
Not so hard.

388
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,100
不要你来了
I wanna lay off the nuts.

389
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,640
好 你来试下 眼镜?
All right, how about you, glasses?

390
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,810
你身材比较好 还是你去吧
You are in better shape. Wanna go?

391
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,700
我不太擅长做这个... 我来
- Well I'm not that good in things like this. - I got it!

392
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,070

Impressive!

393
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,190
哇奥.
Gee, Willakers!

394
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,000
好极了 瞧 有史以来最好的树屋子
Great. Bingo! This is the best treehouse ever!

395
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,390
红色的钢琴
A red piano.

396
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,030
我们是在做梦吗? 跟我来
- Is this a dream? - Stand by and catch me.

397
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,790
这比树屋强得多了啊 我喜欢这里的景色
- It's much better than a tree! - I just adore a penthouse view!

398
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,780
不错 霍克
Nice one, Hawke.

399
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,460
喜欢吗 当然
- You like it? - Sure, Ian.

400
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,580
我住在这里 这里太漂亮了

她就像是个迷人绿乳糖

如果你们想干好 就要集中注意了
If you guys want to do this you got to pay attention.

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:47,550
嘿 巴斯 嘿 伙计们 准备好了吗
- Hey buzz! - Hey guys? Are you guys ready to go?

532
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,590
我在家还有很重要的事要做
'Cause I've got a lot of important staff  to do at home.

533
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,830
你一定是他们的监护人了?
You must be their guardian?

534
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,460
天啊 是的 我是
God, that I am. Yes I am.

535
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,940
你好 罗宾博士   我以前也在这学校念过书
Hi. How are you, Dr Rubin? I know that because I went to school here a few years ago.

536
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,820
不知道你是否还记得我 托比应该是不记得了
I don't know if you remember me, Toby Seville probably not...

537
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,280
托比?嗨 是你 没有带牙套了?

我认识一个男孩子也是打鼓的

541
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,330
孩子们 我在车上等你们

542
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,830
有人爱上谁了
Somebody is in love.

543
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,680
我们将替代所有的东西 花鼠们的地位
We are going to replace everything. Chipmunks' honor.

544
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,470
还有人用这陈腔滥调啊
The old false modestly suck up routine.

545
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,400
我想我闻到了花鼠的味道
I thought I smelled a rat.

546
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,170
霍克先生 有什么可以帮到你?

我在想也许我能帮助你们
I was wondering if I could help you

548
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,260
我刚刚听说了你们的音乐比赛
I just heard about your musical competition

549
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,450
我就尽快到这里来推荐我的孩子们

550
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,520
谢谢你的周到 不过我已经做了决定了
That's very thoughtful of you, but I've already made up my mind.

551
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,480
也许这会让你改变决定的
Perhaps this will change your mind.

552
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,400
女孩们
Girls.

553
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,010
她们和伊恩在一起?
They are with Ian?

554
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,510
一二 一二
One, two, one, two ...

555
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,710
她们太棒了
They're astounding.

556
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,600
朋友们 你们刚刚看的是女鼠们
Good people of West Eastman, you have  just witnessed the debut...

557
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,520

Of the Chipettes!

558
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,540
谢谢
Thank you!

559
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,780
怎么样?
Well?

560
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,950
她们太了不起了 但就像我以前说的
They were splendid. But as I said before

561
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,960
我已经下了决定了
I have made my decision.

562
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:47,430
我知道了 你已经做决定了
I see. You've made your decision.

563
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,580
我不需要说服一个学校老师
I don't need to speak out of school doctor

564
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,710
真正意义上的民主
but in the true spirit of democracy

565
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,480
是我们伟大国家的根基
which our great wonderful country was founded upon...

566
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,680
我想说 让人们投票决定吧
I say, let the people vote.

567
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,010
让他们来选择
Let them choose.

568
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,070
一人之投一票 让他们决定
One person, one vote, I say, let us vote!

569
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,600
投票
Let us vote.

570
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,640
投票
Let us vote.

571
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,120
请不要剥脱她们的权利
Please don't be a flasher granby...

572
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,460
让她们唱
let them sing.

573
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,070
投票
Let us vote.

574
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,490
你很有说服力  霍克先生
You make a persuasive case, Mr Hawke.

575
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,700
好 这就是我将要做的
All right, here is what I'm going to do.

576
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,290
本周五 每队将在学生面前表演一首歌
This friday, each group will perform one song in front of the student body.

577
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,180
谁获得最多掌声 那么 谁就代表我们学校
Whoever gets the most applause, well, will represent the school.

578
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,860

What?

579
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:46,500
谢谢 我们成功了
Thank you. We made it.

580
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,210
我们像大型金刚一样强
Oh, it is on, like Donkey Kong!

581
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,130
狐蒙聚在一起结束了戏剧性的一天
The Meerkats huddle together, at the end of a dramatic day ...

582
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,870
重申了他们的家族观念
to reaffirm their family bond.

583
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,940
Whiskers将比以往更加依赖彼此
The whiskers are going to have to rely on each other more than ever.

584
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,170

- Wow! Every day? - Stop right there, ok!

586

你或许也想成为真正的障碍面朝那边
You might as well be really obstacles  in the face countryside

592
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,900
因为你确实在抱

你应该感谢他
You should be grateful to him.

他做的一切都是为了你
He did everything for you, Alvin

616
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,380
而艾尔文你却伤了他的心

Hmm,really. How do I put this gently!

618
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:36,480
他是个坏人 他没心没肺的
He's the devil,  he doesn't have a heart,

619
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:40,200
比如说他就曾把我们关在笼子里
and one of the things he did for us  was put us in a cage!

620
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,950
艾尔文 他不可能做这个

是 想想 你曾在那儿 我忘了.....

我不需要你的任何建议
I don't need any advice from you.

624

-不过..-不过 没什么 艾尔文
-But... -But, nothing, Alvin!

Me neither. I just want to hang out with them.

631
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,230
好吧 如果你们这么想......
All right, look. If you feel that way ...

632
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,730
也许我们应该退出比赛 什么?
- Maybe we should just withdraw from the contest. - What?!

633
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,260
我会把你们用联邦快递寄回你们来的地方
I'll put you all in Fedex package and mail you back to whatever tree you came from.

634
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,960
听起来不错吧?好 开始

Have you always been that short?

639
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:44,170
我想是的 那应该做点什么?
- I guess. - You've got to work on that.

640
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,410
好的 那我试试这个
Ok, all right. Let me try somethin' here.

It's not just because Brittany is more  than mega-ultra superstar than you guys.

- You two I just wanna let you know, not to get in Brittany's way. - Ah, ok.

791
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:33,150

让我们来拭目像暴风雨一样的花鼠们
And now, let teared for the group that will rock you like a hurricane.

798
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:17,240
至少就像很多你的学生告诉我的一样
At least that is what many of you students have told me.

799
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,690
欢迎花鼠们
Here they are...the Chipmunks.

800
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,010
嘿 你知道吗 有句话说在团队里没有自我
Hey, you know they say there is no "I" in the word "team"

801
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,080
他们是对的
and they are right

802
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:29,420
你知道IN是什么吗?艾尔文
But,you know where is "IN" ? Alvin.

803
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,140
就是像你们 女孩们
Such to be you.  Girls!

804
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:37,010
可悲 他是对的
Sadly, he's correct.

805
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,050
找到他了吗?
Did you find him?

806
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:42,360
对不起 我找遍了周围都没有找到
Guys, sorry, I searched the whole perimeter.

807
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,930
我也不知道为什么 整个队也没有回来
And I don't know why, but the team is not back yet.

808
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:47,680
我们怎么办
What should we do?

809
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,650
我应该....
I would ...

810
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:55,990
我应该叫别人.....但不是我
I would ask someone...who's not me.

811
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,520
.我知道我们应该怎么做
I know what we should do.

812
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,990
嗨 大家好
Hi, everyone.

813
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,330
我兄弟 艾尔文今天来不了了
Our brother, Alvin couldn't be here today.

814
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,090
重要的是 我们不会出演的如果艾尔文不在
Thing is, we never performed without Alvin ..

815
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:28,470
我们还没有准备好
and we are not starting now.

816
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:31,400
你们不能只有两头小猪
You can't have two little pigs

817
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:34,530
你们不能只有两个士兵 所以...
you can't have only two musketeers so...

818
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:38,310
只有我们俩不能唱
You know you can't have only two chipmunks.

819
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:40,610
谢谢
Thank you.

820
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:53,740
我带你们回家
I'll take you home.

821
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,150
女孩们 听到了吗
You hear that, girls?

822
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,260
胜利的声音
That...is the sound of success.

823
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:17,670
.我知道你们的失望
I relize how devastated you...

824
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,830
但是花鼠们也一定有自己的原因
Chipmunks' funs must be...

825
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,560
所以我想这意味着女花鼠赢了..
So I guess that means that the Chipettes...

826
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,400
过来 女孩们
Come on girls, let's take a victory lap.

827
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:32,070
过来

Life is good.

832
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,990
尤其你不是一个失败者的时候
Especially when you're not a loser.

833
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,770
嘿 伙计们 我在这儿
Hey guys? I'm here.

834
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:02,570

835
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,220

艾尔文.他们走了.
They are gone, Alvin.

837
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:11,330
他们永远也不会原谅我的 你知道吗 艾尔文...
- They never gonna forgive me. - You know ... Alvin...

838
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,370
伊恩他是对的
Ian was right.

839
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,440
你永远也不会关心其他人除了你自己
You don't care about anyone except yourself.

840
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:25,240
噢 顺便说下 我也不想以这种方式赢你
And oh, by the way,  I never wanna to win this way.

841
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,040
西门,你醒了吗
Simon, are you awake?

842
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,100
希欧多,我不责怪你生气
Theodore, I don't blame you for being mad.

843
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,130
我离家出走了?
I ran away from home?

844
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:26,360
别去公园找我 我不在那里
Don't look for me in the Zoo, because I'm not there.

845
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,390
不.不 希欧多
Oh, no Theodore ...

846
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,080
你好?

有人在家吗
Is anyone home?

849
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:52,100
我是希欧多 我想成为你们的一员
My name is Theodore, I like to be in your family.

850
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,290
也许他们藏起来了
Maybe they are hiding.

851
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,660
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

852
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:12,430
你不是狐B
You are not a meerkat!

853
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,890
托比你来找老虎 狮子和熊那边
Toby, you take the lions, the tigers and the bears ...

854
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:18,060
西门和我去检查蜜蜂那边
Simon and I will take the butterfly room.

855
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,760
好老鹰
Nice Eagle.

856
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,150
不要动希欧多
Don't move Theodore.

857
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:26,490
好的
No problem there.

858
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:29,540
别动 别动小子 我们马上把你就救出去
Hang in there, hang little guy. We'll get you out from there.

859
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:35,350
我们要定个计划 我们需要定个精密的计划
Ok, we need a plan.  And we need carefuly executed plan.

860
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:38,990
或者你可以像个疯子一样跑进去
Or you can just ride in there like a maniac.

861
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,820
Theo,.小心
Theo, watch out.

862
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,220
嗨 我是希欧多
Hi, I'm Theodore ...

863
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:49,220
嘿 大鸟 看这里 你饿了吗 先抓这A
Hey birdy, look up in here, are you hungry? Catch this "A"?

864
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,690
那是开胃菜
That's for appetizer.

865
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:57,370
放松点 我们出去聊好吗
Let's all just relax, and we talk this out, ok!

866
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:03,730
听着 我想我知道你为什么想要希欧多 真的
Look, I guess why you want Theodore, I do,

867
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:07,330
不过 不好意思 我不会允许这事发生的
but I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

868
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:09,440
因为他是我的兄弟
He's my brother.

869
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,650
别让他知道 因为最近我真的是个大混蛋
Not let him know that, because I've been a such a big jerk lately.

870
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,960
如果谁是值得被吃掉 那就是我
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

871
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,100
不是真的
Not really.

872
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,990
艾尔文.我来帮你
I got you, Alvin.

873
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:34,240
当心老鹰
Watch to the eagle.

874
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,350
他们的敌人就是大象
Their only mortal enemy is a piggy elephant.

875
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:40,060
幸好我知道它们在哪里
Luckily I speak a little habitat.

876
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:45,640
我想这行得通
I think it's working.

877
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,480
天啊 这太大了
Guys, that was huge.

878
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,970
那我们现在是一对所有还是三对一
He's right.Now we are one for all and three for one?

879
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:06,310
算了吧 拥抱一下
Come on, Simon, hug it out.

880
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,140
你知道的 对不起
You know I'm sorry, Sy.

881
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,020
不要叫我去亲你我可是会的
Sy, don't make me up to kiss you because  I'll do it.

882
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:16,570
我不介意
I don't care.

883
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:21,090
过来 终于好了
Here come the lips! The makeout train leaving the station.

884
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:26,130
最后 我想我想要那个拥抱
I think after all, I'll take that hug.

885
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,510
打伊恩 霍克电话
Justine, call Ian Hawke.

886
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:42,150
310-555-5309

887
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:45,150
Morris,让伊恩听电话
Morris, get me that Ian Hawke on the phone.

888
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:51,100
你们在这里
There you are.

889
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,410
我亲爱的挣钱小东西
My sweet little money makers.

890
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,550
记得我曾经和你们说过
Do you remember when I told you that

891
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,220
我会让你们变成大明星
I would make you all big stars?

892
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:04,840
猜猜是谁在斯台普斯中心为Britney设了场?
Well, guess who's opening up for Britney Spears at Staples Center tonight?

893
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:07,410
我在做梦吗 天啊

894
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:08,760
等一下 今晚?

01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,380
我们不能错过学校的音乐会
We'll miss the school contest!

896

That's correct. You will miss the school contest.

897
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,630
你们那么聪明 看来我真的没你们厉害
You are so smart, I can't never get  anything being passed by you.

898
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:18,930
其实根本就不是为了学校的竞赛
It was never about that stupid school contest

899
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:23,100
其实一直都只是为了把布莱特妮弄成明星
it was always about making Brittany a star.

900
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,110
这就是你想要的是吗
That's what you wanted, right?

901

恩 是的 .今晚是一个很好的机会

那珍妮和伊莲诺呢
But what about Jeanette and Eleanor?

904
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:39,820
她们可以助唱 我也会给她们薪水的
They can sing backups, I got them some staff too.

905
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:43,540
但是...我们可是好姐妹
But...we are her sisters.

906
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:46,560
要么一起唱要么不唱
We either sing together or not at all!

907
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,730
好 我需要的只是布莱特妮
Ok, fine. All I ever needed is the B-girl.

908
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,650
伊恩 如果她们不去我也不去
Ian, I won't do it without them.

909
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:00,120
好吧 好吧 那就实行B计划

913
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:12,750
味道好极了
Real tasty.

914
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:16,800
当然 除非你们唱歌
Unless of course, you wanna sing?

915
