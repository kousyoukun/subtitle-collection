Alvin, 放松点. 你是全场焦点.

00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:00,254
知道的, Dave.

7
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,325
- Dave. - 我是认真的, Alvin. 这个是有关慈善的.
- Dave. - I'm serious, Alvin. This is a charity benefit.

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,912
- 这不仅仅是你自己. - Dave，我听不到你说什么 ...
- It's not all about you. - Sorry,Dave. I can't hear you ...

9
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,245
很多歌迷在喊我的名字.
over the thousands of fans screaming my name.

10
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:16,683
我知道.

11
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,894
帮我一把.
I need a help, boys.

12
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:46,185
Alvin 你赶紧从那里下来.
Alvin, will you please get down from there.

13
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,722
我听不到你说什么.
I can't hear you.

14
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,188
- Alvin,我不是开玩笑的. - 什么？
- Alvin, I'm not kidding. - What?

15
00:02:55,712 --> 00:03:03,476
- Dave 小心! - Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!
- Dave, look out! - Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

16
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:10,584
Oh, Dave. Dave?
Oh, Dave. Dave?

17
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:16,091
这可以减轻疼痛
This should help with the pain.

18
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,578
我想和孩子们说说话.
I wannna talk to my boys.

19
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:23,105
我刚刚给你打的镇静剂将在一分钟后起效，所以...
I just gave you a sedative that will take effect in about one minute, so...

20
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,783
让它们进来，快点
But, let them in, quickly.

21
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:32,367
- Dave! - 嘿，伙计，你还活着
- Dave! - You are alive! - Hey guys!

22
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:34,875
-.那是一个意外，我发誓 -你还好吗
- It was an accident. I swear. - Are you OK?

23
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,936
-真抱歉，Dave - .我还好
- I'm really sorry, Dave. - I'll be fine.

24
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,242
我只是还要呆在这里一段时间
I'm just gonna be stucked here for a while.

25
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:45,100
在我离开这里之前 我会安排Jackie阿姨和你们呆在一起
And until I get out, I made arrangements for my aunt Jackie to come and stay with you.

26
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,327
谁是Jackie阿姨
Who is Aunt Jackie?

27
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:50,144
就是在圣诞节给我们邮递美味的爆米花那个
The one who sent us those mail package of  yummy popcorn for Christmas.

28
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,399
- 爆米花Jackie - Seville先生，你没有多少时间了
- Popcorn Jackie. - You don't have much time Mr Seville.

29
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,267
听着， 我想你们都回家去过像正常孩子的生活
Listen, I want you guys to go home and live a normal childhood.

30
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:03,770
我甚至已经安排了你们上学的事宜
I even made arrangement  for you to go to school.

31
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:06,729
- 上学？ - 是的，上学
- School? - Yes, school.

32
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,253
Simon,我全部托付给你了
Simon, I'm putting you in charge.

33
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:15,352
- 你？ -我指望你了
- You are? - I'm counting on you.

34
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:18,671
Dave，等一下 为什么要交付给他？
Dave, wait a minute.  Why is he in charge?

35
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:22,465
他指望我了 - Dave,求你了，别死啊
- He's counting on me. - Dave, please, don't die.

36
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:24,503
他只是睡觉 他刚刚打了镇定剂
He just sleeping. He had a sedative.

37
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,135
噢，镇定剂
Ah, a sedative.

38
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,157
打扰了， 我来这里是来护送花鼠们回家的
Excuse me, I'm here to escort the Chipmunks home.

39
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:33,843
我们不离开Dave 我就呆在这里了
We are not leaving Dave. I'm putting my paw down on this one.

40
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:35,201
你过来
You come here.

41
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,090
.我知道了，我会搞掂！那会更加糟糕
I got it! I'll fix it! No, made it worse.

42
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:42,326
求你了，走吧
Please, please go.

43
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:48,469
你越是坚持 他就越好不了
More stress you put on persistent the longer will take him to recover.

44
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,528
你太慢了，姥姥
You are too slow, nanny.

45
00:04:52,529 --> 00:05:01,108
你阻止不了我的，没有Dave我哪里也不去 梦信徒，和归国皇后...
You'll never hit me! I'm not going anywhere without Daaa... ...aaaydream believer, and a homecoming queen...

46
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:07,953
我希望为了你他能在整个飞行途中都不会醒来
I hope for your sake he stays asleep for the entire flight.

47
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:11,820
也许你应该再给他打一针，以防万一
Maybe you should give him another shot. Just to be sure.

48
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,073
有什么主意让我们找到Jackie？
Any ideas on how we gonna find aunt Jackie?

49
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,327
跟我来
Follow me.

50
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,355
让一下
Excuse me. Sorry.

51
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,758
让一下
Excuse me, got you.

52
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,860
看，Jackie，Jackie 爆米花Jackie
- Look, aunt Jackie! Aunt Jackie! - Popcorn Jackie.

53
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,411
过来，亲爱的 我们找到你了
- Oh, come on dears. - Yeah, we got you.

54
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,563
- !爆米花 -谁去送给Theodore
- Popcorn! - Who's sending to Theodore's?

55
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,072
每个人都有份 给我一个拥抱先
Oh, there is a plenty for everyone. Give a hug first.

56
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:48,720
过来这里，你这个老泰迪熊
Come over here, you old teddy bear.

57
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:51,411
我不是那么喜欢拥抱
I'm not really much of a hugger.

58
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:55,535
孩子们，我介绍个人你们认识 这是我的孙子Toby，Toby？
Oh, boys, I want you to meet someone. This is my grandson Toby. Toby?

59
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,416
嗨，我是Theodore.
Hi, I'm Theodore.

60
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:01,026
- Toby? - 怎么了？
- Toby?! - What, what happened?

61
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,510
- 孩子们 - .噢 嘿 你好我是托比，很高兴见到你
- The boys! - Oh, hey! Hey,how are you? I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.

62
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:07,992
托比现在和我住在一起 直到他想到他以后要怎么办
Toby is living with me 'til he figures out what he want to do with his life.

63
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,446
现在看来就成天用他的大拇指 哔哔哔
So far that means going beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with his thumbs the all day.

64
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:17,028
.重要的是我的手指哔-哔-哔 一直保持第一名
For the record goin' beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with my thumbs right now is keeping me in first place, and that's important.

65
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,070
- .Toby拿上包 - 什么包？
- Toby get the bags. - What bags?

66
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:23,868
- 拿行李 ..噢 行李 对了 让我把那些也带上....
- The lighters. Get the luggages. - Oh, the lug, right. Let me get those...

67
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,792
- Toby! -快刹车，快刹车
- Toby! - Get the brake! Get the brake!

68
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,560
我很好，不用担心
I'm fine.Don't worry!

69
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:46,178
真抱歉，Jackie阿姨 她还好吗？
I'm so sorry, aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry. Is she goin' to be ok?

70
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:49,170
别担心我，我会很快回去的
Don't worry about me, I will be home with no time.

71
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:52,433
我可是不那么肯定
I wouldn't be so sure.

72
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:56,195
那是一个意外，我发誓
It was an accident, I swear.

73
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:59,093
在那里 好几次这样了
Been there, done that. Several times.

74
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:01,505
我在想他现在会照顾我们吗?
I guess he will be taking care of us now?

75
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,197
我坦率的说他肯定会让我们离开的
I'll take frankly foster of five hundred please-outs.

76
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,293
别担心，我完全能做好
Ain't no problem. I can totally do this.

77
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:11,245
我是说，我以前把我的猫照顾得很好，直到它跑了
I mean, I took care of my cat...  until it ran away.

78
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:15,129
“逃跑”也许是说难听了点 我想是它想有自己的空间吧
Well, 'ran away' is kind of strong wordin', I think he just wanted his space.

79
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,603
但我还在附近看到过它
I still see him around neighbourhood.

80
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,314
你知道吗，它喜欢用爪子抓我， 这说明我们还是很亲密的
You know, he like hisses and claws at me. but I think that's his way of saying we're still tight, you know.

81
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:29,032
你们真不用担心这个 我不会和Dave一样的，你们知道，Dave已经离开了
You guys are nothing to worry about, seriously. 'Cause, I'm not gonna be like Dave, you know, Dave is gone.

82
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,262
不在了？
Gone?

83
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:34,796
不是不在了， 他还没有死，他还活着呢
Not gone, not gone gone. He is not dead. He's very much alive.

84
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:38,081
他肯定还会回来的 我要把他的房子弄得很温暖等他回来
He completely coming back. I'm just gonna be in his room, keepin' his bed warm.

85
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:42,091
你做你的事我做我的事 我意思是说你可以当我不存在的
I'll be doin'my thing,you'll be doin' your thing. I mean, you don't need to know that I'm there.

86
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:46,979
可我们知道你在这儿 这才是关键
We supposed to know that you there, that's the whole idea.

87
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:54,572
是的，你们知道我在，我只是.... 我不会像这样：我什么都懂，你去做这些，你去做那些
Yeah, ok absolutely. You know that I'm there,I'm just... I'm not gonna be like: I know everything, and you do this, and you do that.

88
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,005
真的
I mean that.

89
00:07:57,049 --> 00:08:00,056
好的 那就这样吧
All right, let's do this.

90
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:01,762
伙计
Oh, boy!

91
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,587
Theodore我们会很好的
Theodore, we gonna be just fine.

92
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:17,893
重要的是我们还活着
The important thing is...we're all still alive.

93
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:22,610
也许做一张 “康复“卡片会让Dave快点好起来
Well, maybe my "Get Well" card will  help Dave to come faster.

94
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,594
我们拿多点闪粉
It needs just a touch more glitter.

95
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:33,228
那很好 谁饿了？
That should do it. Who's hungry?

96
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,344
我，我 .我们吃东西吧
- Uh, uh me, me! - Let's eat.

97
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:39,364
Nada，找到什么了吗
Nada. Find anything?

98
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:42,161
Alvin?这里是美食城吗？
It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

99
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:45,618
嘿，奶酪球在烤箱里

100
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,481
晚餐，来了
Bingo. Dinner, she is  aserved.

101
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,043
嘿，你在干什么？
Hey, what are you doing in here?

102
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:23,659
奶酪球？
A cheese ball?

103
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,445
给我点时间，很快
Thumb boy, give me a second, real quick.

104
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:32,610
我现在真的需要集中精神了 我的重量级冠军已经近在咫尺了
Alvin, I really need to focus, right now because I'm one knockout away from my heavy weight title.

105
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,197
我们也能玩吗？
Can we play as well?

106
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:41,849
你知道，我不想伤害你 你也不想看到任何一个受伤是吧
You know, I don't want to  hurt your feelings, but else you don't want see anyone get hurt and there gonna be fistsufferean flyin'.

107
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,518
我们来玩MONOPOLY吧
We can play monopoly.

108
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,897
我们成天都和Dave玩这个
We play monopoly with Dave all the time.

109
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,516
听起来不错 我们也应该这样
That sounds funny. We should do that sometime right.

110
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:51,472
.现在，我要回去像蝴蝶蜜蜂一样勤劳工作啦
Now, I got to back and floatin' like a butterfly and stinging like the bee.

111
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:58,391
.我们不需要Toby，Theodore 你有我们了
Who needs Toby, Theodore, you got us.

112
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:02,517
是啊，谁需要Toby。伙计们，这边
Yeah, who needs Toby? Boys, right this way.

113
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:23,562
我想吐
I'm gonna puke.

114
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:28,474
如果Dave在这里的话他会怎么说呢？
Do you know what Dave would say if he were here right now?

115
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:32,301
我想一定气到他
But I think it means to come more from the belly.

116
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,739
过来 别吵
Get together. Be cool.

117
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,290
大家好 伙计们，是我
- Helllooooo? - Boys, it's me.

118
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,801
Dave?
Dave?

119
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:51,461
我想你接了电话后 应该还没有把房子烧了
Well, I guess since you've answered the phone,  you haven't burned down the house yet.

120
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,693
Dave.请相信我 好吧
- Have a little faith, Dave. - Yes.

121
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,941
救我
Mayday!

122
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,446
怎么了 不要告诉他
- What was that? - Don't stress him out.

123
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:06,081
噢...是Jackie. .是，她给我们做了5道美味的食物
- Oh, that was... Aunt Jackie. - Yeah, she's making us a tasty five-course meal.

124
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:09,322
真的？我能和她聊聊吗
Really? Can I talk to her?

125
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:12,173
她去练习钢管舞了
She's practising her pole dancing.

126
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:15,840
钢管舞 但是，那谁做的晚餐?到底怎么了？
Pole dancing? But, what happened with making dinner. Guys, what's going on?

127
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,469

129
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,690
没人比他做得更好了

130
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:57,927
Toby,.醒醒

131
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:06,141

- 我做噩梦了 -.噩梦，我最讨厌做恶梦了
- I had a nightmare. - Oh, the nightmares.I hate the nightmares.

133
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:12,169
梦到什么了
What was it?

134
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,418
我梦到我们不再有家庭了
I dreamt that we didn't have a family anymore.

135
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:21,795
Theodore, 那不可能的 不会的，你太紧张了
Theodore, that couldn't happen.  No, you guys are tight.

136
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:24,426
没人会把我们分开
Nothing could ever separate you.

137
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:29,374
就算老鹰来了也不能
Less like an eagle swooped down from the sky like caw-caaaw!

138
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:37,859
这从没有发生过 为什么你认为会发生这样的事呢？你知道....
Which couldn't happen ever. Why would you think that ever happened, you know...

139
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,672
老鹰在费城
The Eagles are in Philadelphia.

140
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:43,704
好梦
Sweet dreams.

141
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:54,050

- Toby, make it stop. - What are you doing?

142
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:57,119
这钟有点毛病 关不掉了
There is something wrong with the clock. It won't shut up.

143
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,523
这样我没发睡觉
I can't sleep.

144
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:04,142
那是因为它是个闹钟
That's the point. It's an alarm clock.

145
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:06,735
它能让你们早起
It helps you wake up early in the morning.

146
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,993
为什么会有人想要早起？
Why anyone wanna wake up early?

147
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:11,957
去上学啊，你8点要到那里

- In t疝e morning? - Look, I don't like any others early anything more than you do.

149
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:21,433
Alvin.但这是我们的事情 你越早到学校，我就能越早回来睡觉
But we are in this together, Alvin. Soon you get to school, soon I get to compound and get back to sleep.

150
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:25,861
你意思是说你不和我们一起呆在学校？ 是的
- You mean you don't stayin' with us in school? - No, no , no.

151
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:27,966
我学习造句的日子已经过去了
I've done my time making very much.

152
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:33,075
不过学校很有趣，是吧? 有趣？我想是吧？
- But school is fun, right? - Fun? Well, i guess Maybe, it's... fun-ish..

153
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,605
嘿，那是我的猫

154
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,658
嘿 小家伙 是我 记得吗

00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:14,840
第一天上学玩得开心点 3点左右再来接你们
Enjoy your first day in school. See you around three-ish.

158
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:25,810
知道了，就像在公园一样
We got it. This got to be a walk in the park.

159
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:29,477
我害怕
I'm frightening.

160
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,795
嗨，我是Theodore

163
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:58,623
这可不怎么好玩
That wasn't very fun-ish.

164
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:03,706
你一定就是新来的了 我是Rubin博士，这里的校长
You must be our new students. I'm Dr Rubin, the principal.

165
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,974
我们是花鼠
And we are the Chipmunks.

166
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:09,932
是的，我能从你们的外表上看出来
Yeah, that will explain the fur and booshy tales.

167
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,605
跟我来，男士们 男士们？

Oh, us. Right.

169
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:17,732
还有一分钟的时候 我们还落后两分....
There was a minute left and we were down by two ...

170
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:21,332
当时我在想：就算我腿断了也不要紧 让我上，我一定能赢...
And I mind couch: I don't care if my leg is broken, put me in, I can win this...

171
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,910
我从没有放弃过
I never get tired of that story.

172
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,287
所以我自己几乎不能站立...
So I hobbled out barely able to stand...

173
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:28,672
我有提到我的腿断了吗？

So this is a classroom?

178
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,922
我喜欢在早上闻奶油的味道

迷人的小姐

185
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:14,486
找人量一下他们的身高才行
Somebody's have to knock these guys down to size.

186
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:17,754
那十分很简单 他们最多只有8英寸高
That should be pretty easy, really. They are only eight inches tall.

187
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:49,254
我有15辆车 有超过5辆都是众多人喜欢的
I had 15 cars. I mean that's like five more cars than anybody really needs.

188
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:55,072
我雇了7个女工 拥有湖人队的场边座位
I had seven maids. Courtside seats to the Lakers.

189
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,267

191
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:05,103
看我 我失去了所有
Look at me. I lost everything.

192
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:08,730
除了我的尊严 .他们拿不走
Except for my dignity, they can't take that away from me.

193
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,229
.而这一切都是因为他们
And it's all because of them.

194
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:18,120
咦，有饼干
Oh, hey ...crackers.

195
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,386
现在奔波着 只是祈祷能找到其他会
Now run around, hoping and praying that I could find other animals that can ...

196

唱歌跳舞的小动物

197
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:28,237
等等，你不会唱歌？是吗?
Wait a second, you don't sing, do you?

198
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,483
嘿，这是我的松饼 给我拿回来，你这该死的小老鼠
Hey, hey that's my muffin. Give me my muffin! You dirty rat.

199

我会抓到你们的

200
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:51,232
女孩们，我们得走了
Girls, we have to get out of here.

201
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,065

不管怎么样，我们是花鼠美眉
Anyway, we are the Chipmunk girls.

215

你让Alvin花鼠们成为大明星

停，不是这里
Hang on, not here.

222
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:13,646
为什么不到我的阁楼办公室去开会

224
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,208

228
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:37,716
女士们，告诉我一些关于你们的事
Ladies, tell me little something about yourselves.

229
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:41,533
我们在一个 只有300人的小镇里长大的
We grew up in a small town, population 300 and ...

230
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:44,337

234
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:32,022
猜一下谁会成为了全世界第一的花鼠组合？

235
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,627
Ian Hawke.
Ian Hawke.

236
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:38,198
什么时候我们可以和花鼠们见面
So, when can we meet the Chipmunks?

237
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:43,892
好问题 答案是...
That's an excellent question  and the excellent answer is...

238
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:47,900
我已经不再代表Alvin和花鼠们了
I don't really represent Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

239
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:51,216
噢，怎么回事？ 很老套的故事
- Oh, no. Wha-what happened? - Oh, classic tale.

240
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,031
当我见他们的时候很可爱，天真 他们什么也没有，之后
Sweet and innocent when I met them, they had nothing ...and then I work my butt of

241
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:57,035
.我尽了全力让他们成为了摇滚明星
to make them rock stars and...

242
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,937
后来他们变了 变成坏蛋
They changed. Turned out to be like bad cheese.

243
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,405
.不 多可怕啊
- No. - That's terrible.

244
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:09,648
我一直把Alvin当成我自己的儿子一样对待
I know. I mean, I treated Alvin like my own son, you know.

245
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:12,774
而他们就这样离我而去
And he just goes and spits on me.

246
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:17,521
实际上，我有的只是他们留给我的一脸口水
Literally. He filled his chipmunk's cheeks with saliva and just had at it.

247
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:22,823
可别让我提起Simon了 幸好不是Theodore
- Don't even get me started about Simon. - But not Theodore, right?

248
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:25,856
这可爱的还更需要注意
It's the cuddly ones you have to watch for.

249
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:29,825
为什么我们要谈他们呢 他们已经完蛋了，被解雇了..
But why we are talkin' about them for, c'mon? They are over, fired, nobledeu疝e (noble death)...

250
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:32,332
花鼠们的蠢说法
Chipmunks' stupid sayin'.

251
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,137
.不过...
But ...

252
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:40,456
笨女鼠们，请系好安全带
Girl Chipmunks' stupid sayin' ... Fasten your seat belts!

253
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:47,715
我看着的他眼睛说，Jay，Beyonce在哪里？
So I eyed Jay Z's eyes right, and I said:  Jay, where is Beyonce?

254
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:50,423
然后他说：她正拿着一碟子的 奶酪球...，我一转身
And he says : She's holding a plate  full of cheese balls, turn around ...

255
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:52,481
猜是什么

Simon这样会不会让我的臀部看起来小一点
Simon, does this make my butt look smaller?

292
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:31,098

Theodore, your butt looks fine. Those guys are just some jerks.

293
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:44,883

You threatened to climb inside of him and build a nest.

294
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:49,247

That was out of line and not even sure that is physically impossible.

295
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:54,970
我应该将你们三个停职 可以

我还有更好的主意

由于预算的削减 我们的音乐规划可能会受到影响
Due to budget cutbacks , we are in jeopardy of loosing our beloved music program.

298
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:13,605
太可怕了 我知道

299
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:16,175
但是，我还是有一个小小的希望
But, there is one small ray of hope.

300
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,639
这里每年都会举办一个音乐比赛
Every year the District sponsors a music competition...

你想我们去表演
And you want us to perform?

304
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:31,362
我在想你到底是不是我们的歌迷了呢
I begin to think that you are a fan?

305
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,268
你们可以考虑一下
Why don't you sleep on it.

306
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:38,762
等等 好极了
- Wait. - Great.

307
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,967
答应我什么也不要说出去
Promise me that you won't say anything.

308
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:45,607
校长一定会赞成的 如果让Mr Fencle发现了可...
The principal has a certain image to uphold. If Mr Fencle ever finds out about this ta...

I just can't believe this, that you are actually sitting in my office. I have all of your CDs.

310
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:56,720
我甚至到丹佛去看过你们 所以我有这个
I even went to see you last year in Denver. That's where I got this.

It was my birthday. And I was like...Oh, the Chipmunks!

312

So, what you say?  Will you represent our school?

313
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:11,561
实话说，听起来挺不错的
Honestly suspension sounds pretty good to me.

314
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:16,016
Alvin? 一个对所有，还是3对一
Come on Alvin? One for all, and three for one.

315

He's the devil,  he doesn't have a heart,

543
00:45:36,597 --> 00:45:40,309

01:04:41,938 --> 01:04:44,333
嗨，我是Theodore
Hi, I'm Theodore ...

767
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,323
嘿，大鸟，看这里，你饿了吗 先抓这A
Hey birdy, look up in here, are you hungry? Catch this "A"?

768
01:04:49,324 --> 01:04:51,797
那是开胃菜
That's for appetizer.

769
01:04:54,677 --> 01:04:57,482
放松点 我们出去聊好吗
Let's all just relax, and we talk this out, ok!

770
01:04:58,648 --> 01:05:03,839
听着 我想我知道你为什么想要Theodore 真的
Look, I guess why you want Theodore, I do,

771
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:07,438
不过 不好意思 我不会允许这事发生的
but I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

772
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:09,544
因为他是我的兄弟
He's my brother.

773
01:05:09,545 --> 01:05:14,916
别让他知道 因为最近我真的是个大混蛋
Not let him know that, because I've been a such a big jerk lately.

774
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:21,064
如果谁是值得被吃掉，那就是我
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

775
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:25,212

Not really.

776
01:05:25,443 --> 01:05:27,101
Alvin.我来帮你
I got you, Alvin.

01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,933
当心老鹰

778
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:39,129
他们的敌人就是大象 幸好我知道它们在哪里
Their only mortal enemy is a piggy elephant. Luckily I speak a little habitat.

779
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:45,751
我想这行得通
I think it's working.

780
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,593
天啊，这太大了
Guys, that was huge.

781
01:05:58,191 --> 01:06:03,081
那我们现在是一对所有还是三对一
He's right.Now we are one for all and three for one?

782
01:06:04,424 --> 01:06:06,419
算了吧，拥抱一下
Come on, Simon, hug it out.

783

你知道的，对不起
You know I'm sorry, Sy.

784
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,132
不要叫我去亲你我可是会的
Sy, don't make me up to kiss you because  I'll do it.

785
01:06:14,133 --> 01:06:16,671

I don't care.

786
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:21,197
过来 终于好了
Here come the lips! The makeout train leaving the station.

787

最后 我想我想要那个拥抱
I think after all, I'll take that hug.
