再給我一把,黑男孩.

Alvin, 放鬆點. 你是全場焦點.

00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:00,254
知道的, Dave.

7
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,325
- Dave. - 我是認真的, Alvin. 這個是有關慈善的.
- Dave. - I'm serious, Alvin. This is a charity benefit.

8
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,912
- 這不僅僅是你自己. - Dave，我聽不到你說什麼 ...
- It's not all about you. - Sorry,Dave. I can't hear you ...

9
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,245
很多歌迷在喊我的名字.
over the thousands of fans screaming my name.

10
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:16,683
我知道.

11
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,894
幫我一把.
I need a help, boys.

12
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:46,185
Alvin 你趕緊從那裡下來.
Alvin, will you please get down from there.

13
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,722
我聽不到你說什麼.
I can't hear you.

14
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,188
- Alvin,我不是開玩笑的. - 什麼？
- Alvin, I'm not kidding. - What?

15
00:02:55,712 --> 00:03:03,476
- Dave 小心! - Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!
- Dave, look out! - Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

16
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:10,584
Oh, Dave. Dave?
Oh, Dave. Dave?

17
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:16,091
這可以減輕疼痛
This should help with the pain.

18
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,578
我想和孩子們說說話.
I wannna talk to my boys.

19
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:23,105
我剛剛給你打的鎮靜劑將在一分鐘後起效，所以...
I just gave you a sedative that will take effect in about one minute, so...

20
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,783
讓它們進來，快點
But, let them in, quickly.

21
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:32,367
- Dave! - 嘿，夥計，你還活著
- Dave! - You are alive! - Hey guys!

22
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:34,875
-.那是一個意外，我發誓 -你還好嗎
- It was an accident. I swear. - Are you OK?

23
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,936
-真抱歉，Dave - .我還好
- I'm really sorry, Dave. - I'll be fine.

24
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,242
我只是還要呆在這裡一段時間
I'm just gonna be stucked here for a while.

25
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:45,100
在我離開這裡之前 我會安排Jackie阿姨和你們呆在一起
And until I get out, I made arrangements for my aunt Jackie to come and stay with you.

26
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,327
誰是Jackie阿姨
Who is Aunt Jackie?

27
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:50,144
就是在聖誕節給我們郵遞美味的爆米花那個
The one who sent us those mail package of  yummy popcorn for Christmas.

28
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,399
- 爆米花Jackie - Seville先生，你沒有多少時間了
- Popcorn Jackie. - You don't have much time Mr Seville.

29
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,267
聽著， 我想你們都回家去過像正常孩子的生活
Listen, I want you guys to go home and live a normal childhood.

30
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:03,770
我甚至已經安排了你們上學的事宜
I even made arrangement  for you to go to school.

31
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:06,729
- 上學？ - 是的，上學
- School? - Yes, school.

32
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,253
Simon,我全部托付給你了
Simon, I'm putting you in charge.

33
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:15,352
- 你？ -我指望你了
- You are? - I'm counting on you.

34
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:18,671
Dave，等一下 為什麼要交付給他？
Dave, wait a minute.  Why is he in charge?

35
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:22,465
他指望我了 - Dave,求你了，別死啊
- He's counting on me. - Dave, please, don't die.

36
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:24,503
他只是睡覺 他剛剛打了鎮定劑
He just sleeping. He had a sedative.

37
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,135
噢，鎮定劑
Ah, a sedative.

38
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,157
打擾了， 我來這裡是來護送花鼠們回家的
Excuse me, I'm here to escort the Chipmunks home.

39
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:33,843
我們不離開Dave 我就呆在這裡了
We are not leaving Dave. I'm putting my paw down on this one.

40
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:35,201
你過來
You come here.

41
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,090
.我知道了，我會搞掂！那會更加糟糕
I got it! I'll fix it! No, made it worse.

42
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:42,326
求你了，走吧
Please, please go.

43
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:48,469
你越是堅持 他就越好不了
More stress you put on persistent the longer will take him to recover.

44
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,528
你太慢了，姥姥
You are too slow, nanny.

45
00:04:52,529 --> 00:05:01,108
你阻止不了我的，沒有Dave我哪裡也不去 夢信徒，和歸國皇后...
You'll never hit me! I'm not going anywhere without Daaa... ...aaaydream believer, and a homecoming queen...

46
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:07,953
我希望為了你他能在整個飛行途中都不會醒來
I hope for your sake he stays asleep for the entire flight.

47
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:11,820
也許你應該再給他打一針，以防萬一
Maybe you should give him another shot. Just to be sure.

48
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,073
有什麼主意讓我們找到Jackie？
Any ideas on how we gonna find aunt Jackie?

49
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,327
跟我來
Follow me.

50
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,355
讓一下
Excuse me. Sorry.

51
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,758
讓一下
Excuse me, got you.

52
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,860
看，Jackie，Jackie 爆米花Jackie
- Look, aunt Jackie! Aunt Jackie! - Popcorn Jackie.

53
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,411
過來，親愛的 我們找到你了
- Oh, come on dears. - Yeah, we got you.

54
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,563
- !爆米花 -誰去送給Theodore
- Popcorn! - Who's sending to Theodore's?

55
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,072
每個人都有份 給我一個擁抱先
Oh, there is a plenty for everyone. Give a hug first.

56
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:48,720
過來這裡，你這個老泰迪熊
Come over here, you old teddy bear.

57
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:51,411
我不是那麼喜歡擁抱
I'm not really much of a hugger.

58
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:55,535
孩子們，我介紹個人你們認識 這是我的孫子Toby，Toby？
Oh, boys, I want you to meet someone. This is my grandson Toby. Toby?

59
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,416
嗨，我是Theodore.
Hi, I'm Theodore.

60
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:01,026
- Toby? - 怎麼了？
- Toby?! - What, what happened?

61
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,510
- 孩子們 - .噢 嘿 你好我是托比，很高興見到你
- The boys! - Oh, hey! Hey,how are you? I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.

62
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:07,992
托比現在和我住在一起 直到他想到他以後要怎麼辦
Toby is living with me 'til he figures out what he want to do with his life.

63
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,446
現在看來就成天用他的大拇指 嗶嗶嗶
So far that means going beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with his thumbs the all day.

64
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:17,028
.重要的是我的手指嗶-嗶-嗶 一直保持第一名
For the record goin' beeoo-beeoo-beeoo with my thumbs right now is keeping me in first place, and that's important.

65
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,070
- .Toby拿上包 - 什麼包？
- Toby get the bags. - What bags?

66
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:23,868
- 拿行李 ..噢 行李 對了 讓我把那些也帶上....
- The lighters. Get the luggages. - Oh, the lug, right. Let me get those...

67
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,792
- Toby! -快剎車，快剎車
- Toby! - Get the brake! Get the brake!

68
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,560
我很好，不用擔心
I'm fine.Don't worry!

69
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:46,178
真抱歉，Jackie阿姨 她還好嗎？
I'm so sorry, aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry. Is she goin' to be ok?

70
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:49,170
別擔心我，我會很快回去的
Don't worry about me, I will be home with no time.

71
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:52,433
我可是不那麼肯定
I wouldn't be so sure.

72
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:56,195
那是一個意外，我發誓
It was an accident, I swear.

73
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:59,093
在那裡 好幾次這樣了
Been there, done that. Several times.

74
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:01,505
我在想他現在會照顧我們嗎?
I guess he will be taking care of us now?

75
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,197
我坦率的說他肯定會讓我們離開的
I'll take frankly foster of five hundred please-outs.

76
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,293
別擔心，我完全能做好
Ain't no problem. I can totally do this.

77
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:11,245
我是說，我以前把我的貓照顧得很好，直到它跑了
I mean, I took care of my cat...  until it ran away.

78
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:15,129
「逃跑」也許是說難聽了點 我想是它想有自己的空間吧
Well, 'ran away' is kind of strong wordin', I think he just wanted his space.

79
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,603
但我還在附近看到過它
I still see him around neighbourhood.

80
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,314
你知道嗎，它喜歡用爪子抓我， 這說明我們還是很親密的
You know, he like hisses and claws at me. but I think that's his way of saying we're still tight, you know.

81
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:29,032
你們真不用擔心這個 我不會和Dave一樣的，你們知道，Dave已經離開了
You guys are nothing to worry about, seriously. 'Cause, I'm not gonna be like Dave, you know, Dave is gone.

82
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,262
不在了？
Gone?

83
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:34,796
不是不在了， 他還沒有死，他還活著呢
Not gone, not gone gone. He is not dead. He's very much alive.

84
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:38,081
他肯定還會回來的 我要把他的房子弄得很溫暖等他回來
He completely coming back. I'm just gonna be in his room, keepin' his bed warm.

85
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:42,091
你做你的事我做我的事 我意思是說你可以當我不存在的
I'll be doin'my thing,you'll be doin' your thing. I mean, you don't need to know that I'm there.

86
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:46,979
可我們知道你在這兒 這才是關鍵
We supposed to know that you there, that's the whole idea.

87
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:54,572
是的，你們知道我在，我只是.... 我不會像這樣：我什麼都懂，你去做這些，你去做那些
Yeah, ok absolutely. You know that I'm there,I'm just... I'm not gonna be like: I know everything, and you do this, and you do that.

88
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,005
真的
I mean that.

89
00:07:57,049 --> 00:08:00,056
好的 那就這樣吧
All right, let's do this.

90
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:01,762
夥計
Oh, boy!

91
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,587
Theodore我們會很好的
Theodore, we gonna be just fine.

92
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:17,893
重要的是我們還活著
The important thing is...we're all still alive.

93
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:22,610
也許做一張 「康復「卡片會讓Dave快點好起來
Well, maybe my "Get Well" card will  help Dave to come faster.

94
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,594
我們拿多點閃粉
It needs just a touch more glitter.

95
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:33,228
那很好 誰餓了？
That should do it. Who's hungry?

96
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,344
我，我 .我們吃東西吧
- Uh, uh me, me! - Let's eat.

97
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:39,364
Nada，找到什麼了嗎
Nada. Find anything?

98
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:42,161
Alvin?這裡是美食城嗎？
It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

99
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:45,618
嘿，奶酪球在烤箱裡

100
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,481
晚餐，來了
Bingo. Dinner, she is  aserved.

101
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,043
嘿，你在幹什麼？
Hey, what are you doing in here?

102
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:23,659
奶酪球？
A cheese ball?

103
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,445
給我點時間，很快
Thumb boy, give me a second, real quick.

104
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:32,610
我現在真的需要集中精神了 我的重量級冠軍已經近在咫尺了
Alvin, I really need to focus, right now because I'm one knockout away from my heavy weight title.

105
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,197
我們也能玩嗎？
Can we play as well?

106
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:41,849
你知道，我不想傷害你 你也不想看到任何一個受傷是吧
You know, I don't want to  hurt your feelings, but else you don't want see anyone get hurt and there gonna be fistsufferean flyin'.

107
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,518
我們來玩MONOPOLY吧
We can play monopoly.

108
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,897
我們成天都和Dave玩這個
We play monopoly with Dave all the time.

109
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,516
聽起來不錯 我們也應該這樣
That sounds funny. We should do that sometime right.

110
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:51,472
.現在，我要回去像蝴蝶蜜蜂一樣勤勞工作啦
Now, I got to back and floatin' like a butterfly and stinging like the bee.

111
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:58,391
.我們不需要Toby，Theodore 你有我們了
Who needs Toby, Theodore, you got us.

112
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:02,517
是啊，誰需要Toby。夥計們，這邊
Yeah, who needs Toby? Boys, right this way.

113
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:23,562
我想吐
I'm gonna puke.

114
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:28,474
如果Dave在這裡的話他會怎麼說呢？
Do you know what Dave would say if he were here right now?

115
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:32,301
我想一定氣到他
But I think it means to come more from the belly.

116
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,739
過來 別吵
Get together. Be cool.

117
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,290
大家好 夥計們，是我
- Helllooooo? - Boys, it's me.

118
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,801
Dave?
Dave?

119
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:51,461
我想你接了電話後 應該還沒有把房子燒了
Well, I guess since you've answered the phone,  you haven't burned down the house yet.

120
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,693
Dave.請相信我 好吧
- Have a little faith, Dave. - Yes.

121
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,941
救我
Mayday!

122
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,446
怎麼了 不要告訴他
- What was that? - Don't stress him out.

123
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:06,081
噢...是Jackie. .是，她給我們做了5道美味的食物
- Oh, that was... Aunt Jackie. - Yeah, she's making us a tasty five-course meal.

124
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:09,322
真的？我能和她聊聊嗎
Really? Can I talk to her?

125
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:12,173
她去練習鋼管舞了
She's practising her pole dancing.

126

Toby,.醒醒

- I had a nightmare. - Oh, the nightmares.I hate the nightmares.

133
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:12,169
夢到什麼了
What was it?

134
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,418
我夢到我們不再有家庭了
I dreamt that we didn't have a family anymore.

135
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:21,795
Theodore, 那不可能的 不會的，你太緊張了
Theodore, that couldn't happen.  No, you guys are tight.

136
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:24,426
沒人會把我們分開
Nothing could ever separate you.

137
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:29,374
就算老鷹來了也不能
Less like an eagle swooped down from the sky like caw-caaaw!

138
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:37,859
這從沒有發生過 為什麼你認為會發生這樣的事呢？你知道....
Which couldn't happen ever. Why would you think that ever happened, you know...

139
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,672
老鷹在費城
The Eagles are in Philadelphia.

140

142
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:57,119
這鍾有點毛病 關不掉了
There is something wrong with the clock. It won't shut up.

143
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,523
這樣我沒發睡覺
I can't sleep.

144
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:04,142
那是因為它是個鬧鐘
That's the point. It's an alarm clock.

145
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:06,735
它能讓你們早起
It helps you wake up early in the morning.

146
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,993
為什麼會有人想要早起？
Why anyone wanna wake up early?

147
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:11,957
去上學啊，你8點要到那裡

- In t疝e morning? - Look, I don't like any others early anything more than you do.

Alvin.但這是我們的事情 你越早到學校，我就能越早回來睡覺
But we are in this together, Alvin. Soon you get to school, soon I get to compound and get back to sleep.

150
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:25,861
你意思是說你不和我們一起呆在學校？ 是的
- You mean you don't stayin' with us in school? - No, no , no.

151
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:27,966
我學習造句的日子已經過去了
I've done my time making very much.

152
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:33,075
不過學校很有趣，是吧? 有趣？我想是吧？
- But school is fun, right? - Fun? Well, i guess Maybe, it's... fun-ish..

153
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,605
嘿，那是我的貓
Hey, it's my cat!

154
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,658
嘿 小傢伙 是我 記得嗎

00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:14,840
第一天上學玩得開心點 3點左右再來接你們
Enjoy your first day in school. See you around three-ish.

158
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:25,810
知道了，就像在公園一樣
We got it. This got to be a walk in the park.

159
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:29,477
我害怕
I'm frightening.

160
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,795
嗨，我是Theodore

162
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:48,107
老鷹 老鷹來了
- Eagle. - Go eagle!

163
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:58,623
這可不怎麼好玩
That wasn't very fun-ish.

164
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:03,706
你一定就是新來的了 我是Rubin博士，這裡的校長
You must be our new students. I'm Dr Rubin, the principal.

165
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,974
我們是花鼠
And we are the Chipmunks.

166
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:09,932
是的，我能從你們的外表上看出來
Yeah, that will explain the fur and booshy tales.

167
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,605
跟我來，男士們 男士們？

我們？好的
Oh, us. Right.

169
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:17,732
還有一分鐘的時候 我們還落後兩分....
There was a minute left and we were down by two ...

170
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:21,332
當時我在想：就算我腿斷了也不要緊 讓我上，我一定能贏...
And I mind couch: I don't care if my leg is broken, put me in, I can win this...

171
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,910
我從沒有放棄過
I never get tired of that story.

172
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,287
所以我自己幾乎不能站立...
So I hobbled out barely able to stand...

173
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:28,672
我有提到我的腿斷了嗎？
Did I mention my leg was broken?

174
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,977
-Ortega女士? -是的

177
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:40,128
這個就是教室嗎
So this is a classroom?

178
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,922
我喜歡在早上聞奶油的味道
I love the smell of zit cream in the morning.

179
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:47,770
你好，小姐們

183
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,632
我是Alvin Seville
My name Seville, Alvin Seville.

184
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:08,953
迷人的小姐
Enchantee... mademoiselle.

185
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:14,486
找人量一下他們的身高才行
Somebody's have to knock these guys down to size.

186
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:17,754
那十分很簡單 他們最多只有8英吋高
That should be pretty easy, really. They are only eight inches tall.

187
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:49,254
我有15輛車 有超過5輛都是眾多人喜歡的
I had 15 cars. I mean that's like five more cars than anybody really needs.

188
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:55,072
我雇了7個女工 擁有湖人隊的場邊座位
I had seven maids. Courtside seats to the Lakers.

189
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,267
甚至我的女僕們都坐在那兒
Even my maids had courstside seats to the Lakers.

190
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,292
看著我
Now, look at me.

191
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:05,103
看我 我失去了所有
Look at me. I lost everything.

192
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:08,730
除了我的尊嚴 .他們拿不走
Except for my dignity, they can't take that away from me.

193
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,229
.而這一切都是因為他們
And it's all because of them.

194
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:18,120
咦，有餅乾
Oh, hey ...crackers.

195
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,386
現在奔波著 只是祈禱能找到其他會
Now run around, hoping and praying that I could find other animals that can ...

196
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:24,817
唱歌跳舞的小動物
sing or dance.

197
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:28,237
等等，你不會唱歌？是嗎?
Wait a second, you don't sing, do you?

198
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,483
嘿，這是我的鬆餅 給我拿回來，你這該死的小老鼠
Hey, hey that's my muffin. Give me my muffin! You dirty rat.

199
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:40,455
我會抓到你們的
I will get you Chimpmunks.

200
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:51,232
女孩們，我們得走了
Girls, we have to get out of here.

201
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,065

206
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:16,799
Hawke先生?
Mr Hawke?

207
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:20,726
那個聲音，我能分辨出來
That voice! I can't get it out of my head!

208
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:23,886
Mr Hawke?你好
Hello, Mr Hawke?

209
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:27,174
好像不是做夢，是真的叫我
That not in my head, that's really happening.

210
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:30,591
你想幹嘛 我想自我介紹一下
- What do you want? - We want to introduce ourselves.

211
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:35,020
是的 我是Brittany，這是我的姐妹Eleanor
That's right. I'm Brittany. And this is my sister Eleanor.

212

先生，很高興見到你
Hello, sir. Such a pleasure to meet you!

213
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,308
我是她們的姐妹 Jeanette 儘管有時我感覺起來像Olivia..
And I'm their sister Jeanette.  Although I feel more like an Olivia or sometimes....

214
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,454
不管怎麼樣，我們是花鼠美眉
Anyway, we are the Chipmunk girls.

215
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:49,388
我們很榮幸在你面前介紹我們自己
We will be just so honored to have you to represent us.

216
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:51,378
你讓Alvin花鼠們成為大明星
You made Alvin and the Chipmunk stars.

217
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:53,175
我們也想成為明星
We wanna be stars too, yeah!

218
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:56,057
和花鼠們一起玩耍
And hangin' out with the Chipmunks.

219
00:18:56,058 --> 00:19:00,593
好了 在我們得到這些之前，告訴我一件事
Ok, now listen before we get all girly and giggly about this, just tell me one thing ...

220
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:03,760
你們會唱歌嗎？
You can sing, right?

221
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,929
停，不是這裡
Hang on, not here.

222
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:13,646
為什麼不到我的閣樓辦公室去開會
Why not we take this meeting upstairs in my penthouse office?

223
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:18,375
這太激動了
This is so exciting.

224
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,208
噢，天啊，真令人不敢相信
Oh, my gosh, can you believe it?

225
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:26,449
我的第一個頂層辦公室
My first penthouse office!

226
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,530
噢..好萊塢標誌耶
Oh, my... the Hollywood sign!

227
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,466
我想你會喜歡這裡的風景的
I thought you might like the view!

228
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:37,716
女士們，告訴我一些關於你們的事
Ladies, tell me little something about yourselves.

229
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:41,533
我們在一個 只有300人的小鎮裡長大的
We grew up in a small town, population 300 and ...

230
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:44,337
真的？那太棒了
Really? That's fascinating. Great!

231
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,728
好了 現在好好表現吧
All right, impress me!

232
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:50,882
一.二.三
One, two, three.

233
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:27,487
女孩們，女孩們，
Girls, girls, girls.

234
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:32,022
猜一下誰會成為了全世界第一的花鼠組合？
Guess who just became the number one Chipmunks' band in whole dang world?

235
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,627
Ian Hawke.
Ian Hawke.

236
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:38,198
什麼時候我們可以和花鼠們見面
So, when can we meet the Chipmunks?

237
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:43,892
好問題 答案是...
That's an excellent question  and the excellent answer is...

238
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:47,900
我已經不再代表Alvin和花鼠們了
I don't really represent Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

239
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:51,216
噢，怎麼回事？ 很老套的故事
- Oh, no. Wha-what happened? - Oh, classic tale.

240
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,031
當我見他們的時候很可愛，天真 他們什麼也沒有，之後
Sweet and innocent when I met them, they had nothing ...and then I work my butt of

241
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:57,035
.我盡了全力讓他們成為了搖滾明星
to make them rock stars and...

242
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,937
後來他們變了 變成壞蛋
They changed. Turned out to be like bad cheese.

243
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,405
.不 多可怕啊
- No. - That's terrible.

244
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:09,648
我一直把Alvin當成我自己的兒子一樣對待
I know. I mean, I treated Alvin like my own son, you know.

245
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:12,774
而他們就這樣離我而去
And he just goes and spits on me.

246
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:17,521
實際上，我有的只是他們留給我的一臉口水
Literally. He filled his chipmunk's cheeks with saliva and just had at it.

247
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:22,823
可別讓我提起Simon了 幸好不是Theodore
- Don't even get me started about Simon. - But not Theodore, right?

248
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:25,856
這可愛的還更需要注意
It's the cuddly ones you have to watch for.

249
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:29,825
為什麼我們要談他們呢 他們已經完蛋了，被解雇了..
But why we are talkin' about them for, c'mon? They are over, fired, nobledeu疝e (noble death)...

250
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:32,332
花鼠們的蠢說法
Chipmunks' stupid sayin'.

251
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,137
.不過...
But ...

252
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:40,456
笨女鼠們，請繫好安全帶
Girl Chipmunks' stupid sayin' ... Fasten your seat belts!

253
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:47,715
我看著的他眼睛說，Jay，Beyonce在哪裡？
So I eyed Jay Z's eyes right, and I said:  Jay, where is Beyonce?

And he says : She's holding a plate  full of cheese balls, turn around ...

255

If you talk to those girls again you're dead.

265
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:33,713

If you look at those girls again you're dead.

266
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:37,478
如果你們再敢想想那些女孩兒.....
If you even think about those girls...

267
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:41,067
你有想她們嗎？ 有啊，我現在想著她們

285
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:04,048

Well, uh, considering that you just saved me  from drowning in a toilet...

286
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:06,429

我馬上回來

288
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,047
Alvin, Alvin!  我們不要用暴力解決
Alvin, Alvin!  We're not gonna solve anything with violence!

289
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,151
這是條肥老鼠 閉嘴
- It's the fatty ratty. - Cut it out!

290
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:17,140
這老鼠一定在ABEFBE47里堆了很多垃圾 是啊，那麼多脂肪
- This rat has serious junk in the trunk. - Yeah, little fatty.

291
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,584
Simon這樣會不會讓我的臀部看起來小一點
Simon, does this make my butt look smaller?

292
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:31,098
你的臀部看起來很好了 那些小子只是一群笨蛋
Theodore, your butt looks fine. Those guys are just some jerks.

293
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:44,883
你威脅他們說要在他們體內建巢？
You threatened to climb inside of him and build a nest.

294
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:49,247
有點過分了而且甚至事實上也不太可能
That was out of line and not even sure that is physically impossible.

295
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:54,970
我應該將你們三個停職 可以
- I should suspend all three of you. - Please do.

296
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,811
我還有更好的主意
Instead I have the better idea.

297
00:25:06,516 --> 00:25:11,727
由於預算的削減 我們的音樂規劃可能會受到影響
Due to budget cutbacks , we are in jeopardy of loosing our beloved music program.

298
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:13,605
太可怕了 我知道
- That's awful. - I know.

299
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:16,175
但是，我還是有一個小小的希望
But, there is one small ray of hope.

300
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,639
這裡每年都會舉辦一個音樂比賽
Every year the District sponsors a music competition...

301
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,311
.贏家將會得到25，000美金
And the winner school receives 25,000 dolars.

302
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:25,625
如果我們贏了，我們便可以拯救我們的音樂計劃
I疝 we win, we can save our program.

303
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:28,334
你想我們去表演
And you want us to perform?

304
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:31,362
我在想你到底是不是我們的歌迷了呢
I begin to think that you are a fan?

305
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,268
你們可以考慮一下
Why don't you sleep on it.

306
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:38,762
等等 好極了
- Wait. - Great.

307
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,967
答應我什麼也不要說出去
Promise me that you won't say anything.

308
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:45,607
校長一定會贊成的 如果讓Mr Fencle發現了可...
The principal has a certain image to uphold. If Mr Fencle ever finds out about this ta...

309
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:52,897
我真是不敢相信你們就坐在我的辦公室裡 我有你們全部的CD唱片
I just can't believe this, that you are actually sitting in my office. I have all of your CDs.

310
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:56,720
我甚至到丹佛去看過你們 所以我有這個
I even went to see you last year in Denver. That's where I got this.

311
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:59,910
那是我的生日 但是我就像.... 花鼠們
It was my birthday. And I was like...Oh, the Chipmunks!

312
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:07,015
所以，如何？ 你們會代表我們學校出演嗎
So, what you say?  Will you represent our school?

313
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:11,561
實話說，聽起來挺不錯的
Honestly suspension sounds pretty good to me.

314
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:16,016
Alvin? 一個對所有，還是3對一
Come on Alvin? One for all, and three for one.

315
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:19,219
Theodore 精闢，非常精闢 把我們算上
Well put, Theodore.Very well put. Count us in.

316

317
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,282
老鷹，在哪裡？
Eagles? Where?

318
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:30,489
閣樓轎車
Ah, the penthouse limo.

319
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,811
真獨特
Tres exclusivo.

320
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:39,787
那個不是Chihuahua嗎 電影上那個
Hey, isn't that that Chihuahua? Ya know, from the movie?

321

Whoa, whoa, Brittany. You wanna be a star, act like a star.

324
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,789
你不需要他們的簽名，而是你簽名給他們 噢，好的
- You don't get autographs, you give 'em. - Oh, right.

325

- You guys are having some problems at school. - No, not really ...

367

Why are you tryin' to embarrass me in front of my friends?

454
00:37:03,907 --> 00:37:06,919

Are you kidding me? They are the ones which should be embarrassed by.

455

He's the devil,  he doesn't have a heart,

543
00:45:36,597 --> 00:45:40,309

別動 別動小子 我們馬上把你就救出去
Hang in there, hang little guy. We'll get you out from there.

763
01:04:32,126 --> 01:04:35,457
我們要定個計劃 我們需要定個精密的計劃
Ok, we need a plan.  And we need carefuly executed plan.

764
01:04:36,118 --> 01:04:39,099
或者你可以像個瘋子一樣跑進去
Or you can just ride in there like a maniac.

765
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:41,937
Theo,.小心
Theo, watch out.

766
01:04:41,938 --> 01:04:44,333
嗨，我是Theodore
Hi, I'm Theodore ...

767
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,323
嘿，大鳥，看這裡，你餓了嗎 先抓這A
Hey birdy, look up in here, are you hungry? Catch this "A"?

768
01:04:49,324 --> 01:04:51,797
那是開胃菜
That's for appetizer.

769

放鬆點 我們出去聊好嗎
Let's all just relax, and we talk this out, ok!

Look, I guess why you want Theodore, I do,

771
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:07,438
不過 不好意思 我不會允許這事發生的
but I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

772
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:09,544
因為他是我的兄弟
He's my brother.

773
01:05:09,545 --> 01:05:14,916
別讓他知道 因為最近我真的是個大混蛋
Not let him know that, because I've been a such a big jerk lately.

774
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:21,064
如果誰是值得被吃掉，那就是我
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

775

Alvin.我來幫你

當心老鷹
Watch to the eagle.

778
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:39,129
他們的敵人就是大象 幸好我知道它們在哪裡
Their only mortal enemy is a piggy elephant. Luckily I speak a little habitat.

779
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:45,751
我想這行得通
I think it's working.

780
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,593
天啊，這太大了
Guys, that was huge.

781
01:05:58,191 --> 01:06:03,081
那我們現在是一對所有還是三對一
He's right.Now we are one for all and three for one?

782
01:06:04,424 --> 01:06:06,419
算了吧，擁抱一下
Come on, Simon, hug it out.

783
01:06:07,276 --> 01:06:09,249
你知道的，對不起
You know I'm sorry, Sy.

784
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,132
不要叫我去親你我可是會的
Sy, don't make me up to kiss you because  I'll do it.

785
01:06:14,133 --> 01:06:16,671
我不介意
I don't care.

786
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:21,197
過來 終於好了
Here come the lips! The makeout train leaving the station.

787
01:06:24,061 --> 01:06:26,236
最後 我想我想要那個擁抱
I think after all, I'll take that hug.

788

其實根本就不是為了學校的競賽 其實一直都只是為了把Brittany弄成明星
It was never about that stupid school contest, it was always about making Brittany a star.
