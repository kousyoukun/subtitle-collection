1
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,048
The latest tanks, planes
and artillery

2
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:17,718
are loaded on transports to
be shipped to
the Libian desert

3
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,221
where they will disembark
at the coastal
fortress of Tobruk.

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,292
Tobruk.

5
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:27,295
Impregnable
stronghold of allied
resistance in North Africa

6
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:29,363
from which Allied troops
throw down the gauntlet

7
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:32,333
to Hitler's
crack Africa Corps.

8
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,436
And now our boys
are over there.

9
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:39,573
They're keen to gain
combat experience in
desert conditions

10
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:45,346
side by side with
their British comrades
against the Nazi war machine.

11
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,683
And they're looking
forward to wiping the smile
off General Rommel's face.

12
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,195
(EXPLOSIONS)

13
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,554
Waco, let's go. I got it.

14
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,922
Come on.

15
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,196
This is U.S. Tank
attachment Unit 5.

16
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,200
Repeat message U.S. Tank
attachment Unit 5.

17
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,269
Repeat, over to you. Over.

18
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:45,739
Sarge!

19
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,876
Get up, come on.
Get up, come on.

20
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,384
I don't understand. Do we
go south?

21
00:01:56,417 --> 00:02:00,488
Yes. All points east, west
and north are under
enemy control.

22
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,892
Come on, get in here.
Damn it.

23
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:08,796
Shit!

24
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,832
Down.

25
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:15,569
Come on.

26
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:21,242
Okay. Okay.
But what's the order?

27
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,377
Good luck to you, yeah?

28
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,213
Get the hell out of there.

29
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,383
Why didn't you say so in the
first place?

30
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,732
See Cairo, they said.

31
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,300
Get a tan.

32
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,869
See how this baby works
in the sand, they said.

33
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,340
Hey, Sarge.
We're in trouble.

34
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,707
Yeah? What is that?
A wild guess?

35
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,644
General retreat ordered.

36
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,911
Points east, west and
north under enemy
control.

37
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,448
We're boxed in.

38
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,815
We still go south,
don't we, Jimmy?

39
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,453
Come on down here
and give us a hand.

40
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,925
What are we going to do
if we can't get this cement
mixer rolling?

41
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,727
Hey, what did I tell you
about that cement mixer stuff?

42
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,229
Lay off that.

43
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:17,498
-She's sensitive.
-Give me
a screw driver.

44
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,702
Put that stuff up there.
You got it?

45
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,704
-What's south?
-Nothing.

46
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,574
-It can't be just nothing?
-Rocks, sand.
Nothing.

47
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,742
South is all we've got.
That's what south is.

48
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,279
(EXPLOSION)

49
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,846
Well, if they keep that
up, they're liable to hit us.

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,848
Is she going to get us
out of here, Joe?

51
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:35,616
She's a lady now.

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,019
You've got to treat her
like a lady.

53
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,721
Get up there
and give it a try.

54
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,955
Cement mixer?

55
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,925
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I'll tell you...

56
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,028
No woman ever sounded
as sweet...

57
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,398
as this baby is
going to sound when
she gets roaring.

58
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,301
All right, Jimmy, give
her a try.

59
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,577
-Damn it.
-Oh, come on, Jimmy.
Come on, Jimmy.

60
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,447
Come on, Jimmy!

61
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,950
He's not feeding her right.

62
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,820
-What?
-He never took a woman
out to dinner?

63
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,288
Come on, Waco, hold onto
this.

64
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,023
Keep those contracts
plugged till I try.

65
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,930
Hey.

66
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,732
She's dead, Joe.

67
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,300
She's not dead.
Get out of here.

68
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,301
Get out of there.

69
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,938
Come on, baby. Come on.

70
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,776
Come on, little doll.
Come on, honey.

71
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,578
Come on.
Get us out of here.

72
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,081
Come on.
Come on, Lulubelle.

73
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,384
Come on, sweetheart,
you can do it.

74
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,285
Lulubelle, come on.
Don't let me down now.

75
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,690
Lulubelle,
come on do it for Joe.

76
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,565
Waco, come on let's go.

77
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,038
Waco, get down here.

78
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:13,381
-He's hurt, Joe.
-Are you going to make it?

79
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,115
Yeah, I'm going to be
all right.

80
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,586
-What happened?
-She bit me, Joe.

81
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,888
Yeah, well some women are
like that, kid.

82
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,423
All right.
Let's get out of here.

83
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,810
Let's see
what this is about.

84
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,546
Let's go.

85
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,885
-Jimmy, stay on the radio.
-Sure.

86
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,670
Sergeant Gunn,
Untied States Army Tank
Attachment.

87
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:19,707
Captain Halliday,
Royal Army Medical Corp.

88
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,108
Where's the rest of your unit,
Sergeant?

89
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,011
Well, you're looking at it.

90
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,548
He got hurt.

91
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,483
Anyone around here
to help him out?

92
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,485
Yes, of course, I can.
Come here, private.

93
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,626
Thank you, sir.

94
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,098
Well, looks like we're
not the only ones who took
a beating.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,969
I had 42 wounded.

96
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,573
By the time the Stukas
were finished with us,
I had 42 dead.

97
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,643
I guess a red cross
doesn't mean
anything anymore, huh?

98
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,778
That's a nasty cut.

99
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,614
-How did it happen?
-Lulubelle bit me, sir.

100
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,616
-Lulubelle?
-That's the tank, sir.

101
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,826
-What's your problem?
-Problem?

102
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,598
Cigarette?

103
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,799
Here help yourself.

104
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,703
Merci. American cigarette.

105
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,606
-I don't see for a long time.
-Pass them around.

106
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,643
I'm afraid that's the
best I can do, Private.

107
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,112
How you doing, Waco?

108
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,681
I'll be all right, Sarge.

109
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,818
You know we could use
all the water you can spare.

110
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,053
(CHUCKLES)

111
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,121
Well,

112
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,558
I'm afraid you're
out of luck, Sergeant.

113
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,026
Our entire supply
was destroyed.

114
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,198
All we have left is what is
in our canteens.

115
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,100
Are these men under your
command, sir?

116
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,235
Stragglers like
yourselves.

117
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,071
-Trying to rejoin
their outfits.
-It's too late for that.

118
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,807
There's been
a general retreat order.

119
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,141
Haven't you got a radio?

120
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,744
Had one, Sergeant.

121
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,179
That gun fire
doesn't sound like
a retreat to me.

122
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,748
Those are German guns,
mopping up.

123
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,118
We're cutting south.

124
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,986
We figure we can
link up with another outfit

125
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,254
and make a stand.

126
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,357
South?

127
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,159
South is like the
Quattara Depression,
Sergeant.

128
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,162
It's the worst piece of
desert in Libya.

129
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,665
So how far do you think
you're going to get
in that tin can?

130
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,067
That's my tank, Private.

131
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,301
She's a good tank.

132
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,004
And right now she's
the only ticket
you've got out of here.

133
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,841
Well, I haven't
considered retreat,
Sergeant, so...

134
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,308
See, you're new to the desert.

135
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,611
We've been here for a while.

136
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,013
It's much better
to dig in and wait
for reinforcement.

137
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,949
Reinforcements?

138
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,652
What are you crazy?
We just got our ass kicked.

139
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,220
I'm sorry, sir.

140
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,624
But, you've been cut
off, and south is the only
way out.

141
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,660
Well, I say dig in, sir.

142
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,728
It's better than running
scared in a tin coffin.

143
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,329
Good luck.

144
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,699
First, we ain't running.

145
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:02,102
We're obeying orders.
Second, she's not made of tin.

146
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,237
Third, she's no one's coffin.

147
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,340
She's the M 3 air cooled Lee.

148
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,309
She can cross
200 miles of desert

149
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,112
as easy as you can take a
stroll in Picadilly Circus.

150
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,047
Didn't sell cars
before the war,
did you Sarge?

151
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,716
And...

152
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,919
Picadilly's in London.
I'm from Gundagai.

153
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,220
That will do, gentlemen.

154
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,190
Look you can either
ride with me

155
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,625
or you can see Berlin
from inside a prison camp.

156
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,095
Me?

157
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,398
I'm going into Berlin
right on top
of Lulubelle there.

158
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,167
Now, south is the only way out
and that's the way
we're going.

159
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,303
South, until we can turn
and make a stand.

160
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,647
Good luck, Captain.
Come on, Waco.

161
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,183
Sergeant,

162
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,689
I go with you.

163
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,759
Why?

164
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,362
I like your cigarettes.

165
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,833
It's transport, sir,
we don't have any.

166
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,303
-All right.
Mount on top.
-Merci.

167
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,275
All right, men.
We should go with
the Americans.

168
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,409
Get your gear, hurry up.

169
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:17,945
Jimmy, wind her up.

170
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,104
Is he any good, your Sergeant?

171
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,373
Is your Sergeant any good?

172
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,109
He's the best.
Joe's a smart guy.

173
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,444
Just don't say nothing
bad about the tank.

174
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,914
Sounds a lot like a
tractor my father
used to have.

175
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,817
Don't call it a tractor.

176
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,356
That's my girl. Kathy.

177
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,094
She got a sister?

178
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,497
The last thing she said
to me was,
"Stay out of trouble, Mike."

179
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,908
Is Sergeant Gunn getting
us out of trouble
or into trouble, Jimmy?

180
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:21,741
Yeah.

181
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,817
(MUTTERS)

182
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,057
What's the problem?

183
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,126
I think I cut the mixture
a little thin.

184
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,460
Try to save on gas.

185
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,396
All right.

186
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,967
Waco, tell them they can
stretch their legs.

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,102
Jimmy,
get down here on the radio.

188
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,175
Fellows,
y'all can come down now.

189
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,119
Frenchie.

190
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,956
Go up on that slope over there
and keep a look out.

191
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,123
Oui, Sergeant.

192
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,125
All right.
We're only going to be
here for a few minutes.

193
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,460
Better eat something.

194
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,529
Drink a third of
a cup of water a piece.

195
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,431
Be sure to measure that
water in a cup.

196
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,568
Waco give them a mess tin.

197
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:36,016
Oh, babe, I'm starving
you to death, ain't I?

198
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,219
Well...

199
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:42,455
I know you need gas, but
not as bad as we need water.

200
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,598
Tobruk.
That's where I'd head for.

201
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,433
Safety first.

202
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,169
This sand is a death trap.

203
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:59,172
Except we're not headed
for Tobruk.

204
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:02,175
He's taking us into
the bloody desert.

205
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,144
Well, we're not going
anywhere this minute.

206
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,579
Listen to it.
The voice of bleeding doom.

207
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,882
It seems to me Sergeant Gunn
knows what he's doing.

208
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,118
Yeah, well, I grew up in
the outback, son.

209
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,120
And the Sarge, is the new boy
in the desert.

210
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,090
-Jimmy.
-Yeah.

211
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,325
You get anything
on that radio yet?

212
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,160
Nothing but static
and heil Hitler.

213
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,365
Well, we're not getting
anything on the radio

214
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,267
so we don't know where
they're going to take a stand.

215
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,436
Tobruk is my bet.
It's never fallen.

216
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,939
Will our petrol hold out?

217
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,507
Well, we've got
enough for about
a hundred and sixty miles.

218
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,642
What we need
is water.

219
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,011
Hey!

220
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,548
I thought I told
you to measure that in a cup.

221
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,950
Sorry. I wasn't thinking.

222
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,087
Waco, take their canteens
and bring them to me.

223
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,589
You just hang on a second,
Sergeant.

224
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,259
We've got our own
officer here...

225
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,994
and we take our
orders from him.

226
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:59,066
-A complainer, huh?
-No, a soldier.

227
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:02,269
A lousy soldier.
You don't take orders
well at all.

228
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:06,006
Well, have you ever heard
of chain of command?
He out ranks you.

229
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,475
Sergeant Gunn is in command
of the tank.

230
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,143
It's his job to get us
through the desert safely.

231
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,112
So you'll take
your orders from him.

232
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,247
I think that's
only common sense.

233
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,350
-Thank you, sir.
-However...

234
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,920
I shall continue to consult
with you on the progress
of this expedition, Sergeant.

235
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,057
My canteen.

236
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,559
Yes, sir.

237
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,530
Waco, pick up the canteens...

238
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,136
Let's move out.

239
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,437
(JEEPS WHIRRING)

240
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,177
Sergeant. Sergeant.

241
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,049
Sergeant. Sergeant...

242
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,220
What do you make of that,
Sarge?

243
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,226
Well, I think for the
first time we got
somebody outnumbered.

244
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,461
Frenchie, send them
a post card.

245
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,998
(GUNSHOT)

246
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,674
That's a British, Sudanese
soldier, Sergeant...

247
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,246
with an Italian prisoner.

248
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,680
I think he's coming after us.

249
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,486
One of you guys give me
something white to wave.

250
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,121
We know when we're licked.

251
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,029
Get up.

252
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,531
Move forward.

253
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,775
Sergeant Major Tambul,
Fourth Sudanese Battalion.

254
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,712
Well, Tambul,
you had us scared.

255
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,149
Well, it's true, Bimbashi.

256
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,085
I thought I had captured
an enemy tank.

257
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,689
Where is the rest of
your outfit, Sergeant Major?

258
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,624
Bir Hacheim.

259
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,394
A column of many machines
and tanks fell upon us there.

260
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,664
All my men died in battle.

261
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:15,034
I escaped and captured
this man to carry my pack.

262
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,672
You know the desert?
-Yes, Sergeant.

263
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,109
We need water.
Could you guide us
to the nearest well?

264
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,344
Yes.

265
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,314
There's one caravan trail.
Very old.

266
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,616
Very hard to find.

267
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,319
It's bad for tank.

268
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:36,089
-It leads to the well
at Hassan-Berani.
-Is there water there?

269
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,724
Is it possible, Sergeant?

270
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,459
Can you get us there,
Sergeant Major?

271
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,431
Allah is my guide.
I can only try.

272
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,199
Excellent. All right.

273
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,536
Okay, Tambul.

274
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,371
-You ride up front.
-Yes, Sergeant.

275
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,508
Waco, wind this thing up.

276
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,611
Jimmy, throw me down a can
of rations.

277
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,548
(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

278
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,417
Excuse, I speak English. I
speak good English.

279
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,353
Sorry, here. No room.

280
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,621
-If you leave me here,
I'll die.
-Look.

281
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,258
You head north and you might
get lucky and join up
with the Germans.

282
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,593
-Now, go on.
-You're American, see?

283
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,762
My wife got cousin
live in America.

284
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,731
-He work for the factory
for the steel.
-Waco, wind this thing up.

285
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,633
-He probably make the steel
for this tank.
-Get out of my way.

286
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,303
Out of my way.

287
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,206
I got a letter from my wife.
I show you a photograph
of my wife.

288
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,175
We have no time
for your photographs.

289
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,310
We have no time
for your photographs.

290
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,147
Jimmy, give me
a half-full canteen.

291
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:37,150
Sergeant, this man
is a prisoner of war, we must
take him with us.

292
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,719
We are moving on.
We are leaving.
Mount up, sir.

293
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,755
-Kinder to put a bullet
in him now.
-I thought about it.

294
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,258
Now, look

295
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,693
this is more than we
can afford.

296
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,595
Now head north.

297
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,598
Sergeant, I protest.
You must not do this.

298
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,701
-I made my decision, Captain.
-You can't do something
this cold blooded.

299
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,636
It's a man's life
we're talking about.

300
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,505
We're talking about
9 lives. Theirs.

301
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,540
Then ask them.
See if they agree with you.

302
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:03,743
They're not going to agree
with me now, Captain.

303
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,612
But when we run out of water,
and they're dying of thirst

304
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,181
you think they're going to
thank me for bringing
an extra mouth along?

305
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,317
Huh?
This is about survival.

306
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,419
Thought that's why you put me
in charge, Captain.

307
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,257
Now,
mount up.

308
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,626
-Sergeant.
-Let go.

309
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:24,163
-Captain, please. Please.
-No. No, I'm sorry.

310
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,200
Lousy way to go.

311
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:30,603
The Sergeant is right.
Stupid war.

312
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,275
(PANTING)

313
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,712
Waco, move it.

314
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,653
Arivadercci.

315
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,256
(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

316
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,335
Waco, stop.

317
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:44,944
Come on.

318
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,383
Come on, mate.

319
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:56,456
Come on, lad. Come on.
Hurry up. Come on, lad.

320
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,957
Come on. Put your hand.

321
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,793
Hurry up.

322
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,296
-Sit down and shut up.
-Sergeant, gracia. Gracia.

323
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,967
He's on board, Sergeant.

324
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,902
Waco, let's go.

325
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,089
-Bone dry.
-Can't be.

326
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,959
Oh, well,
I wasn't thirsty anyway.

327
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,094
Mind you, I wouldn't say no
to a cold beer right now.

328
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,830
-Shut your cake hole,
Williams.
-Suppose we dig?

329
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,467
It's no good, Sergeant.
The water, she comes,
she goes.

330
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,702
The desert chooses
when to give life.

331
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,071
Sergeant, we've only got
two canteens of water left.

332
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:48,408
Sergeant, now might be
a good time to consider
turning back.

333
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,443
We're not done yet.

334
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:53,713
Tambul, how far
is the nearest well?

335
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,915
The ruins of Bir-Acroma.

336
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,117
It is a God forsaken place,
Sergeant.

337
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,919
70 miles south.

338
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,088
70 miles in the Sahara.

339
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,856
Well, we got to try.

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,625

as dry as this one.

Ooh. We...

342
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:15,134
-I should think this is funny.
-No I don't think this is
funny at all.

343
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,438
I was just thinking,
when I was a kid, the biggest
treat I ever got...

344
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:20,139
was going to the beach

345
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,509
and playing in the sand.

346
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:25,878
Jimmy? You got anything
in that radio yet?

347
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,580
Nothing but static and
sauerkraut, Joe.

348
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:30,717
Nothing.

349
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,521
Hey lads, we got company.

350
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,423
And she's not one of ours.
Move it.

351
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,394
Take cover!
Come here.

352
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,741

353
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,517

I want him to think
we're out of ammunition.

He's offering the opportunity

(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)

389
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:03,596
It seems he considers
Sergeant Major to be
of an inferior race.

390
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,066
Well, he doesn't have to worry
about the Sergeant Major's
color.

391
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:10,102
It won't rub off on his nice,
clean uniform.

392
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,972
Search him, Tambul,
thoroughly.

This.

396
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,631
Thought so.

397
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:47,339
And this, Bimbashi.

398
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:50,342
It's in English. Propaganda
dropped for our troops,
no doubt.

399
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:56,015
Raise the white flag and
surrender your arms.

406
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,635
It's Clarkson, sir.
He's been hit.

407
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,674
Tambul, bring him along.

408
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,247
-How bad is he?
-Bad.

409
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:32,151
Well, we can't stay here.

410
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,352
If the fly boy is
telling the truth

411
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,287
there's nothing stopping
the German troops now.

412
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:39,225
They'll be coming down
right over the top of us.

413
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,861
-I can't feel my legs.
-Can he be moved?

414
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,330
Not until we stop
the bleeding.

415
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,899
-Jimmy, get on that radio.
-I'm on it, Sarge.

416
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:53,405
Jerry, here says
Tobruck has fallen.

417
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:56,308
If Tobruk's gone, we're
a bloody long way from home.

Shot cockies. That's us.

419

420
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:07,887
Sergeant, what about
the new prisoner?

421
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,758
What about him?
Suppose you let me have
a little talk with him.

422
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,126
We take a walk behind the hill

423
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,695
and when you are ready to go,
I come back alone.

424
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:21,768
Enjoy your work, huh?

425
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,170
I have a tender heart too,
Sergeant.

426
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,775
But this... This is a nazi...

427
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:34,080
a mad dog and one more mouth
to share the water.

428
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,916
I never let my tender heart
get in the way of what has to
be done.

429
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,452
This kid has got
an iron cross.

430
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,789
He's valuable.

431
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:45,457
I'm going to hang on to him.

432

But I'll tell you what to do,
Frenchie.

433
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,197
I'm going to make you
responsible that this kid
stays in one piece.

Yes, Sergeant.

435
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:02,141
Jimmy, what do you have on the
radio?

436
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,543
It's confirmed, Sarge.
They've got Tobruk.

437
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,913
They're attacking Sidi-Berani.

438
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:09,816
We're still fallen back trying
to reform north
of El Quattara

going to make a stand.

-It doesn't get much
harder than this.
-(WIND BLOWING)

695
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:56,487

00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:00,591
We will.

How do you spell Oasis?

700
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,317
Oh, Waco.

701
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:29,854
O-A-S-I-S.

702
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,656
An oasis.

703
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:34,825
Don't forget to mention the
posh hotel we're staying in.

704
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,428
I'm not going to upset
my wife, Williams.

705
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:40,365
According to this, I'm lying
on some green grass

706
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:42,667
-with some
palm trees waving overhead.
-(CHUCKLES)

707
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,702
Well, I hate to tell you this,
son,

708
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:48,273
but I think the local
post office has been shut
for sometime.

709
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:51,842
Well, I promised my wife
I'd write her a letter
every week if I weren't dead.

710
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,811
Guess what? I ain't dead.

711
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,646
Letter a week?

712
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,882
That's the least you owe them,
back there.

713
00:51:57,915 --> 00:51:59,884
Say, where's back there
for you, Bates?

714
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:02,420
Tibberwee, Yorkshire.

715
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:06,424
It's a fine place except
for some bleeding rain.

716
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:09,627
Mind you I won't say no to
some English drizzle
right now.

717
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,697
(EXHALES)
I'll settle for Michigan
and a little home cooking.

718
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:16,267
You could go a year
without rain in Gundagai.

719
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,835
Then down she'd comes.

720
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:20,438
The desert drives mad.

721
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:24,709
Flowers, green stuff
springing up overnight.

722
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,444
You'd throw a party
if it rained.

723
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,712
Farmer were you?

724
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,315
Drover.

725
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:32,217
That's a cowboy to you.

726
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,585
Best beef in the world.

727
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,921
You ain't never been to Texas.

728
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,926
My village has
the best cheese in the world.

729
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:43,828
My family make it.

730
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,331
The cheese maker, Frenchie.

731
00:52:46,364 --> 00:52:47,698
I'd never have picked it.

732
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:49,534
We have...

733
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:53,971
Fine cows with
brown faces and white neck.

734
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,706
The best milk...

735
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:01,346
And the cheese,
the cheese mes amis.

736
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:03,714
I wish you could have
such a meal.

737
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:07,618
Here you have cheese,
you take your knife so.

738
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,626
Hmm...
Here you have some bread.

739
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:21,232
Hmm...
Some wine of course.

00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,372
A little cheese.

742
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:31,709
A little onion.

743
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:37,248
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
A little onion
and some cheese.

744

00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,954

Hmm...

747
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:48,593
One olive, maybe.

748
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,465
Some more cheese...

749
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,634
And...

750
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:58,269
Some wine.

751
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:03,474
Lay off. You had enough.

752
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:05,510
Oui...

753
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,747
Oui, enough.

754
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,283
Cheer up, buddy.
You'LL get back
there one day...

755
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:15,653
No, I could never go back.

756
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:17,988
The cows...

757
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:20,891
They make no more milk.

758
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:24,495
The Nazis cut their
beautiful white throats and...

759
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:25,596
Took them for meat.

760
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,733

761
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,436
When was this then, Frenchie?

762
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:34,572
Six months ago.

763
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:42,647
I was in the resistance.
You understood resistance?

764
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,916
I help English
airmen to escape.

765

766
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,887

Shoot the hostages.

I have too much hate
to be good to resistance.

We know that...

868
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:11,255
But they don't know that.
They need water bad...

869
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,858
And they'll fight for it
if they have to
and while they're fighting...

870
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:15,459
They ain't outflanking nobody.

871
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:17,061
Have you gone
completely mad, Sergeant?

872
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:19,864
I don't know.

873
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:23,333
I put you in charge
of these men

874
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:25,435
so you could get them
through the desert

875
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,972
-to save lives,
not throw them away.
-Yeah...

876
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:32,142
That was us
against the desert...

877
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:35,145
And now it's us
against the Nazis.

878
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:38,415
Captain, thousands of our boys
are trying to regroup
in Elo Alamein.

879
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:42,352
If we buy them 24 hours,
just 24 hours,
we might make a difference.

881
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,892
That's an awfully big might,
Sergeant.

882
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,596
Well, Captain...

883
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,267
I've been a soldier
since I was 17 years old.

884
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:00,971
And I've been
waiting for this moment.

885
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,909
And you know what?

886
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:09,646
I'm scared...

887
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,283
And that tells me
we're in the right place
at the right time.

888
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:15,886
This is still the men's lives
we're talking about.

889
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,621
These men are soldiers,
Captain.

890
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:19,123
And soldiers have
they're duty?

891
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:20,290
Right.

892
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,228
Tell me something.

893
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:25,896
Are you going to
order them to do this?

894
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,934
No.

895
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:35,539
I'll put it to them.

896
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,008
Go ahead then...

897
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:40,877
Put it to them.

898
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:49,619
Alright. I got a lot to say
and not a lot of time
to say it in.

899
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:54,091
We have 500 thirsty Germans
on their way here
desperate for water.

900
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:57,694
I'm telling their buddies to
go back and tell them we got
all the water they need.

901
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,964
Oh, I get it.
It's a diversion.

902
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,698
While they're poking around
in a dry well

903
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,268
it gives us a bit of time to,
you know...

904
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:05,469
Get away.

905
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:06,903
No...

906
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,206
I ain't leaving.

907
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,674
Are you...

908
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:13,543
Are you, are you saying
we should surrender, Sergeant?

909
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:15,212
I'm saying we stay.

910
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:18,348
We take a stand
and defend the well.

911
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:21,018
-It's got no
bleeding water in it.
-(EXHALES)

912
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:24,321
Don't you get it?
He's using the water as bait.

913
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:26,323
And he thinks this
is the bloody alamo.

914
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:28,558
We can stay.

915
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:32,162
We can defend the well,
and we can delay the Germans.

916
01:05:32,196 --> 01:05:34,931
Well, there's one thing wrong
with that picture, Sergeant.

917
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:38,135
We're here.

918
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:43,507
Here are the Germans.

919
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,743
And that's what happens
when you put nine blokes
up against five hundred.

920
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,612
That's right.

921
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:52,216
If you can't count,
well the rest of us can.

922
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:55,652
If we don't take a stand here
and defend the well
and delay them

923
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:58,288
the Germans are going to come
right through here...

924
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:02,192
And outflank our boys who are
trying to regroup
in Al Alamein.

925
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:04,661
Then a German tank
is going to roll down
the streets of Cairo

926
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:06,696
and Alexandria within a week.

927
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:10,200
I say we stay, take a stand
defend the well.

928
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:12,969
Is this an order, sir?

929
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:20,410
If Sergeant Gunn chooses to
stay and defend the well...

930
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,014
Then I shall
be staying with him.

931
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:28,385
Look, I ain't got
nobody at home waiting for me.

932
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:31,388
But I know
you guys got alot to lose.

933
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:34,058
So I'm only speaking for
Jimmy and me and Waco.

934
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:36,393
You guys have an option.

935
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:39,029
We've got the German
half track back there.

936
01:06:39,063 --> 01:06:40,564
We've got a back door.

937
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:43,100
Tell me something, Sergeant.

938
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:45,602
Reckon we've got
a chance of winning?

939
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,138
I'd say the odds are
about 100 to one.

940
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,545
I fancy the odds.

941
01:06:55,579 --> 01:06:58,048
I'll stay.

942
01:06:58,082 --> 01:07:00,084
Oh God,
the bleeding war's just
caught up with me.

943
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:07,224
Alright. I'm in.

944
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:10,260
I never went out
the back door in my life.

945
01:07:10,294 --> 01:07:12,129
And I'm not going
to start now.

946
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:15,165
Besides...

947
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:19,136
I want to be around
to remind you blokes
that this is a very bad idea.

948
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:21,037
Tambul?

949
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:24,208

950
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,079

01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:32,249

953
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:43,260
Tell the Sergeant
we're sending them back.

01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:46,062

We need food. Fair exchange.
No need to fight.

01:17:10,393 --> 01:17:11,661
Yeah, I'm still here.

1040
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:14,964

1041
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,335

01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,970

1043
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:22,105
Right, Sergeant.

1044
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,239
Frenchie.

1045
01:17:23,272 --> 01:17:24,874
Oui, Sergeant.

1046
01:17:24,908 --> 01:17:26,009
Tambul.

1047
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,176
No trouble, Sergeant.

1049
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:29,979
Over here.

1050
01:17:30,714 --> 01:17:31,715
Casey.

1051
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:36,686
Casey!

1052
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:45,695
God damn it.

1053
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,300
Oh, Casey.

1054
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:13,389
You did good, Doc.

1055
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,891
So did you, Sergeant.

1056
01:18:20,496 --> 01:18:22,165
You've got a victory.

1057
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,735
Yeah.

1058
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:37,747

1059
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:47,456
I'm an optimist, sir...

1060
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,893
But I don't think surrender
if that is what they've
got in mind.

1061
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:51,427
A parlay?

1062
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,763
It seems as though they're
taking it awful seriously.

1063
01:18:53,797 --> 01:18:55,298
Yeah, maybe.

1064
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:58,434
At least they're
taking us seriously, huh?

1065
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:01,170
I better get out there
and see what the hell
they want.

1066
01:19:01,204 --> 01:19:03,272
If there's any translating
to be done, they're going to
have to do it themselves.

1067
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:06,810
If it is treachery...

1068
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:10,046
Well...

1069
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,915
Then you're back in command,
Captain.

1070

You're come a long way,
Sergeant.

1073
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,560
You Americans must have a...

1074

1075
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:02,431

Where is your officer?

1079
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:13,076
Well, our Captain
is British, sir.

1080
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:15,244
You know how the British are.

1081
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:18,114
After a little action
they like to wash up
before tea time.

1082
01:20:25,955 --> 01:20:28,858
HALIDAY: Careful, Doyle.
That's our entire supply.

1083
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:31,861

-Is that your offer?
-Yeah.

1087
01:20:44,107 --> 01:20:46,575
Except you got
a lot of thirsty boys
you we didn't count on.

1088
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:50,646
Private Bergman gave you
a full account of our forces.

1089
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,116
He admitted it...

1090
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:57,887
Before I shot him. But it's
still possible to come
to an agreement, Sergeant.

1091
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,258
What's the deal?

1092
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:05,528
Surrender your arms...
And you can go free...

1093
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:09,966
With a much food and water
as you can carry.

1094
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:13,069
Well...

1095
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:16,872
I don't think so.

1096
01:21:17,941 --> 01:21:19,008
We like it here.

1097
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,677
Actually, we have a...

1098
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,347
So much water that
we can pull our belts
a couple of notches.

1099
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,316
Offer has changed.
The water for guns.

1100
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:31,420
One pint for one rifle.

1101
01:21:31,454 --> 01:21:33,556
One quarter for one mortar.

1102
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:36,059
Water for guns.

1103
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:39,595
-That's the deal.
-You think this is a time
for making jokes, hmm?

1104
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:42,665
I'm not joking, Major.

1105
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:45,034
Water for guns.
Take it or leave it.

1106
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:07,090
-How did you make out, Joe?
-Well...

1107
01:22:07,123 --> 01:22:08,724
Well, they think we have
so much water
that we're swimming in it.

1108
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,493
Good.

1109
01:22:10,526 --> 01:22:13,629
My guess is they're
worse off than we thought.

1110
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,731
They must have some men
in the outer walls.

1111
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,200
That's our first problem.

1112
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:20,469
Our second problem
is ammunition.

01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:22,605
Yeah. All right, Jimmy,
go tell them guys

1114

-That we're under fire
and to come in force.
-Okay.

1115
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:26,375
All right. Let's go.

That's what the Major said.

1123
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,487
What did you say to the Major?

1124
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,390
I told him we're staying
because you liked it here.

1125
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:17,193
I said it reminded you
of home. Gundagui.

-Gundagui.
-That's it.

01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:24,733
Yeah, well, we've
got the heat,
the dust and the thirst.

-Where is the Sergeant?

1218
01:32:54,803 --> 01:32:59,775
We'll make no further attempt
to take the well if you
provide us with water.

1219
01:32:59,808 --> 01:33:02,911
-Tell that to your officer.
-No, no, not acceptable.

1220
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:05,881

How many of you
I wonder are left?

1224
01:33:18,226 --> 01:33:21,096
Enough to watch you choke,
Major.

1225
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:26,034
What's Leroux
think he's doing?

1226
01:33:26,068 --> 01:33:28,871
He's negotiating, sir.
I couldn't stop him.

Damn it, Frenchie.

What is your answer?

1229
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:39,247
I have offered you
the courtesies of war.

We took that easily enough.

-Bayonets.

-Rifle butts.
-Fists.

1248
01:35:05,267 --> 01:35:08,203
Bad time to tell you,
Sergeant. Never been
much good with my fists.

1249
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:10,172
Well, just keep your left up.

-And pray for a miracle.
-Yeah, why not?

1251
01:35:13,241 --> 01:35:15,177
Well, it's four of us
against a battalion

1252
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:17,012
and we're still alive.
You don't call that a miracle?

1253
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:18,814
Maybe.

we started out with mine.

-She didn't mean it.

You get outside

more than this to kill me.

What?

My guess is
it's over pretty quick.

I hope someone finds this.

will ever know this happened.

I'm missing.

nobody knows if I'm dead.

how will they ever know?

see Sergeant.

Never knowing.
