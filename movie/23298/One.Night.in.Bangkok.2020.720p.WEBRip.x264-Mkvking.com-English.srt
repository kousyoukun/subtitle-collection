00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,054
<i>Cabin crew,
prepare for landing, thank you.</i>

2
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,825
Welcome to Bangkok,
we hope you enjoy your stay.

3
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:38,926
Mahalo.

4
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,928
Next.

5
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:54,474
<i>Next station,
Ratchaprarop Station.</i>

6
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:26,113
Good evening, sir. I hope I
didn't make you wait for too long.

7
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:29,250
Oh, not at all, you're right on time.
Perfect, actually.

8
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:45,092
I hope you had a nice nap.

9
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,396
- Water. Ah...

10
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,398
- Thank you
- You're welcome.

11
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,936
You weren't kidding
about the traffic.

12
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,441
Believe it or not,
I was expecting much worse.

13
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,310
We're not too far away now.

14
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,482
Uh... Ahem.

15
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,451
Thank you.

16
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,254
Oh...
Thank you.

17
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,325
Most people would
just toss it to the side.

18
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,496
Most people
are inconsiderate.

19
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,899
This car is spotless.

20
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,335
You must really like this job.

21
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,904
Well, it's decent money.

22
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,207
Plus, I get to choose
my own hours,

23
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,010
and I get to meet
a lot of interesting people.

24
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,179
You like to drive at night?

25
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,914
I have more time at night.

26
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,050
Can't it get dangerous?

27
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,353
Probably, but I've been lucky.

28
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,522
Plus, the app tells me
where I'm being called

29
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:52,426
and where I'm heading to so,
it's all right.

30
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,429
You're a very pretty woman.

31
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,331
You must get propositioned
all the time.

32
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:00,467
I'll be worried if they stop.

33
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:03,103
I'm not getting
any younger, you know.

34
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:07,141
I take it you're not married?

35
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:12,346
- No.
- May I ask you... why?

36
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:17,451
Never got around to it.

37
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:26,026
I have a brother,
he has MS.

38
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,195
They detected it ten years ago.

39
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,264
He's 25 now.

40
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,034
He's everything to me.

41
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,437
I'm sure he is.

42
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,407
And I'm sure you're doing
everything you can.

43
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,545
I am.

44
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,215
It's just this past year...

45
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,117
It's gotten much worse.

46
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,654
Yeah.

47
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:57,224
MS can be like that.

48
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,159
A lot of people
who suffer from it

49
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:02,463
tend to live a lot longer
than they're expected to.

50
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,431
Are you a doctor?

51
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,001
No.

52
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,538
But I was a field medic
a long time ago.

53
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:15,642
I know a little
about a lot of things.

54
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,312
Jack of all trades, huh?

55
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,581
Master of none, that's right.

56
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:24,685
- Your English is very good.
- Well, thank you.

57
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:29,990
I studied English in college,
and that was a long time ago.

58
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,626
Well, I won't
talk about your age

59
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,495
if you don't
talk about my white beard.

60
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,967
I watch a lot of movies as well,
also YouTube videos.

61
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,069
That's how
I practice my English,

62
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,439
but I still feel like
my vocabulary isn't there yet.

63
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,941
Well, you sound great to me.

64
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,177
Besides you're Thai,

65
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,080
you don't need to speak
perfect English.

66
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,016
I'm actually half,
my dad's English.

67
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,052
But I grew up here
and lived here all my life.

68
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:04,358
Who knows, you know,
maybe one day I'm going to be

69
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,695
living in a country where they only
speak English, and no more Thai.

70
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:21,975
Well, the office building
is just up ahead.

71
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,977
Can you pull up in the front?

72
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,012
Mm-hm.

73
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,554
All right, we're here.

74
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,457
My name is Kai.

75
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,693
In Hawaiian it means "the sea."

76
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:43,530
Oh, that's very beautiful.
You're from Hawaii?

77
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:44,598
Yes.

78
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,467
My name is Fha.

79
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,235
It means "sky" in Thai.

80
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,771
Nice to meet you.

81
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:52,172
Nice to meet you, Fha.

82
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,443
How's business been tonight?

83
00:12:56,477 --> 00:13:00,013
You're my first customer.
I just started my shift.

84
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:03,484
- If you don't mind me asking...
- Mm-hm?

85
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,520
How much do you make
on an average Friday night?

86
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:12,760
I would say 1,500 baht,
and 2,000 on a good night.

87
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,596
Sixty dollars?

88
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,098
Yeah, I think so, yes.

89
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,667
I have an offer for you.

90
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:25,305
If you decide to take it
you'll have to turn off the app.

91
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,343
Okay.

92
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:33,614
I have four more stops
after this one, all in the city.

93
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:42,055
One-thousand dollars,
that's the deposit.

94
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,258
You can quit anytime,
take the money.

95
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,428
But if you decide
to stay with me until the end,

96
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,798
I'll give you $5,000 in cash.

97
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:56,069
You don't have to do anything.

98
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:59,573
You don't even have to get out
of the car unless you want to.

99
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,075
I just need you to drive for me.

100
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,717
I need to go up to talk with a lawyer.
Wait for me here.

101
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:14,321
When I get back,
I'll answer any questions you may have.

102
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,757
All right?

103
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:19,693
Thank you.

104
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,800
Thank me at the end.

105
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,151
Hello.

106
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:16,617
Forty-third floor.

107
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,651
Thank you.

108
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,186
You're welcome.

109
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,438
- Good evening, Mr. Kahale.
- Good evening.

110
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:40,908
- How was your flight?
- It was quick.

111
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:42,309
That's nice.

112
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,411
Khun Cha Cha is actually
waiting for you.

113
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,416
Thank you.

114
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,485
Welcome to Bangkok,
Mr. Kahale.

115
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,320
Thank you so much,
Khun Cha Cha.

116
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,454
Sorry to keep you waiting.

117
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:56,456
Not at all.
Please, have a seat.

118
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,492
Thank you.

119
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,827
You have a beautiful office.

120
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:02,396
Seems like
you've done quite well,

121
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,898
especially for being so young.

122
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,399
Yes, I have.

123
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,268
So, please, tell me.
How I can be of service?

124
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,971
You were a bit vague
on the phone,

125
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:13,340
something about an accident
and a family member.

126
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:15,877
Yes.

127
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,813
Actually, more than
just one family member,

128
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,580
the whole family.

129
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,918
Let me show you something.

130
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:45,867
Thank you, Khun Cha Cha.
I'll see you tomorrow.

131
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:53,975
Thank you again for waiting.

132
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:56,077
Not a problem at all.
Did everything go okay?

133
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,677
- Very well.
- Good.

134
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:59,013
I'll be back tomorrow
around 4:00 pm

135
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:00,614
to follow up with details.

136
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:01,916
All right.

137
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,517
Would you please
do me a small favor?

138
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,551
Of course.

139
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,787
It's a bit unusual.

140
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,056
Uh, can you please
ask for a taxi,

141
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,525
and specifically,
a pink one?

142
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,560
I know it's silly.

143
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,730
But I saw a lot of the
pink taxis at the airport,

144
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,965
and with all my travels
I've never ridden in one.

145
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,901
- Sure, yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

146
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,602
Now, please let them know
there'll be two stops:

147
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,872
one at a 24-hour supermarket,

148
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,374
and then at my hotel,
the Hotel Millennium.

149
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,743
Okay, that's not
a problem at all.

150
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,577
It'll take
maybe about ten minutes.

151
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,113
Would you mind
waiting here? Or...

152
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:34,347
Uh, actually,
I prefer waiting outside.

153
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,783
- Okay.
- Um, I think my body

154
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:38,085
could use some fresh
non-airconditioned air.

155
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,487
- Yeah, okay. Great.
- Thank you again.

156
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,889
Have a good evening.

157
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,066
Thank you.

158
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,610
Oh, my gosh, you scared me.

159
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,781
Sorry, you should
lock the doors.

160
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:09,416
Everything went well?

161
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,385
The lawyer was very cooperative.

162
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,990
Well, I don't like lawyers.

163
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:19,559
It's okay, I don't either.

164
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:23,064
So, where next?

165
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:26,033
Thonglor Police Station,
please.

166
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:32,940
I know, first a lawyer,
now police.

167
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:35,910
Mm-hm.
Are you in trouble?

168
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,881
No, it's nothing like that.

169
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:44,185
The lawyer
and the police officer

170
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:49,456
were working on a case that involved
my daughter and her family recently.

171
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,392
I'm here to repay them.

172
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:57,064
We're gonna get there
around 11:00 pm.

173
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,100
Will you be able
to see them then?

174
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,737
I'm sure
that won't be a problem.

175
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:06,633
Man, you fall asleep so easily.

176
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,703
Every moving vehicle.

177
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:10,838
I find I like the motion.

178
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:13,808
What do you like to do?

179
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:15,710
When you're not...

180
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:19,512
driving or taking care
of your brother?

181
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,648
I don't know.

182
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:23,550
I don't really have much time

183
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,986
to do anything else.

184
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,121
You must like something.

185
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,226
Well, what about you?

186
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,165
Fishing.
I like fishing.

187
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,201
- Fishing?
- Fishing.

188
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:42,970
Fishing sounds so boring.

189
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:45,538
Have you tried it?

190
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:49,744
No, but I know what it is,
and it looks boring.

191
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:54,715
Fish are like people.

192
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:56,017
Like people?

193
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,517
Like people.

194
00:21:58,618 --> 00:21:59,987
How?

195
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:02,289
Well, there are some fish

196
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:09,096
that are... really dumb
and easy to catch.

197
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:14,667
Others are extremely smart

198
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:19,106
and much more
difficult to catch.

199
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:25,578
And then there are the rare,
dangerous ones...

200
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:29,216
that can hurt
or even kill you.

201
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:43,097
I actually find it relaxing...
the act of fishing.

202
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:48,668
I don't really care
whether I catch a fish or not.

203
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:54,674
I just like
standing on a beach...

204
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:58,578
watching the waves roll in...

205
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,950
listening to them
crash on the sand...

206
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:08,856
feeling the warm breeze
on my face...

207
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,227
smelling the salt...

208
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:18,165
and the scent
of flowers in the air.

209
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,272
That's how I fish.

210
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:30,311
That's what
my grandfather taught me.

211
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:35,749
That's what I like.

212
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:39,920
It's heaven to me.

213
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:47,228
It sounds very peaceful.

214
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:51,698
You should try it.

215
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,704
Maybe one day.

216
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:18,993
We're here.

217
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:21,095
Do you want me to park in front?

218
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,130
Yeah, park in front.

219
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:24,398
Okay.

220
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:39,413
I'll be back soon.

221
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:19,013
What the fuck?

222
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:23,183
I know you speak English.

223
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:25,152
This is for Lisa.

224
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,388
Who the fuck is...

225
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,349
You're still here.

226
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:42,589
To be honest,
I thought about leaving.

227
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:46,059
You saw I left the bag.

228
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,099
Did you open it?

229
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:57,638
But you know
there's cash inside?

230
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,582
Was it a test?

231
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:13,253
Oh, my God!
What happened to your head?

232
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:20,728
I tripped.
Hit the wall.

233
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,116
You need stitches,
maybe three or four.

234
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,452
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

235
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:47,722
Are you sure?
That's a deep cut.

236
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:49,757
I'm sure.

237
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,993
All right.

238
00:29:58,232 --> 00:29:59,701
Breathe.

239
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,673
And, no, it wasn't a test.

240
00:30:12,613 --> 00:30:15,616
Everything in life
is about making choices.

241
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:19,486
I chose to leave the bag.

242
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:22,556
You chose not to take it.

243
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,494
Life is about making choices

244
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:30,197
and dealing with
those consequences.

245
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:32,432
You understand that?

246
00:30:34,802 --> 00:30:36,704
I understand.

247
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,080
Are you hungry?

248
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:49,516
Let's get something to eat.

249
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,285
We have some time.

250
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,220
What do you feel like eating?

251
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:57,725
Something local.

252
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,060
Well, I know just the place.

253
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:02,162
Okay.

254
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:09,670
I mean, come on, babe,

255
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:12,339
who fucking kills a lawyer
on a Friday night?

256
00:31:13,407 --> 00:31:16,410
Stop it! You're on the scene?

257
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:19,246
I'm actually
just walking in now.

258
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,215
Kai Kahale, American-Hawaiian.

259
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:24,886
Just arrived today,
he came straight here.

260
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,286
He had an appointment.

261
00:31:27,588 --> 00:31:28,890
She led him to the vic's office,

262
00:31:28,923 --> 00:31:31,224
next thing you know
he asks for a taxi,

263
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:34,595
she finds her boss shot dead.
Boom, a bullet to the head.

264
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:37,397
He walked out of here
as if it was nothing.

265
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:39,166
Guards confirmed it as well.

266
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:42,135
Like I said, cold-blooded.

267
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,505
Body slumped over.

268
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:49,242
<i>Blood splattered everywhere
directly behind her.</i>

269
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:55,182
This Kai Kahale sat directly
in front of her and shot her.

270
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:56,583
<i>I'm looking at his ID.</i>

271
00:31:56,617 --> 00:31:58,285
Seems to be real.

272
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:01,488
Arrived this evening, 5:00 pm,
from Haneda.

273
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:05,459
<i>TG 614, business class.</i>

274
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,829
Connecting flight.

275
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:10,597
<i>No alias?</i>

276
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:15,402
Kai Kahale, born 1954. Retired.

277
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:19,941
Worked as a supervisor at a coffee
plantation, big one it seems.

278
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:23,845
He shot her with a silencer,
one shot.

279
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:27,180
He's definitely
not an office worker.

280
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:32,219
Get his picture out. Send it out
to the airports and the borders.

281
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:35,255
Who knows,
maybe we'll get lucky.

282
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:38,558
All right, get as much
information as you can

283
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:42,696
and drop me off at the office.
I left my car there.

284
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,305
Uncle, two of the usual, please.

285
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,264
Sure.

286
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,711
What would you
like to drink?

287
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:59,312
Uh...?

288
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:00,982
I'd recommend you
the chrysanthemum tea.

289
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:03,417
It's really refreshing.
Yeah?

290
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,852
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

291
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:12,201
Uncle,
two chrysanthemum tea, please.

292
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:13,827
Go ahead.

293
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:16,079
- Thank you.
- Customer or boyfriend?

294
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,665
- He's a customer.
- That's good.

295
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,138
Because he looks even older than your dad.

296
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:26,874
Here you go.

297
00:33:26,908 --> 00:33:28,442
Thank you.

298
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:31,278
You're a regular here?

299
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,246
Yeah, I try to come here

300
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,950
two or three times a week,
depends on my ride.

301
00:33:40,021 --> 00:33:41,555
Good?

302
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:43,490
Good.

303
00:33:45,026 --> 00:33:47,227
Can I ask you a question now?

304
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:49,731
Anything.

305
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:54,534
Six-thousand dollars
is a lot of money,

306
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:58,940
and anyone would do it
for half or even less.

307
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:01,675
Probably.

308
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:04,712
But why 6,000?

309
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:10,317
Because I wanted you
to say yes.

310
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:12,586
And I wanted you

311
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,790
to want to do it
and be happy doing it.

312
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:18,592
Okay...

313
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,897
But to be honest,
I can just take half,

314
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,931
it's more than enough for me.

315
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:26,433
No, we made a deal,

316
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:27,969
we shook on it.

317
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,404
Are you sure?

318
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:32,840
Yes.

319
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:38,278
Okay. Thank you.

320
00:34:39,046 --> 00:34:40,514
You're welcome.

321
00:34:40,547 --> 00:34:43,785
As I said, thank me after.

322
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,053
After what?

323
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,595
Oh, no, no, wait.

324
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:58,465
You need to put
some of this in first.

325
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,001
Some nuts.

326
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:03,971
Some... I don't know what
you call this in English.

327
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,440
But it will make it taste good.

328
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,678
Do you eat chili?

329
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:12,880
I do.

330
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:15,582
Thank you.

331
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:16,818
And then you need this,

332
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,753
this is
like the secret recipe.

333
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:21,923
- Fish sauce.
- Fish sauce?

334
00:35:23,157 --> 00:35:25,492
Okay, done, dig in.

335
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,430
Bon appétit.

336
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,399
- Bon appétit.
- Merci.

337
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:36,838
Mmm, smells so good.

338
00:35:47,748 --> 00:35:49,116
It's good, right?

339
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:51,551
It's really good.

340
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:53,988
Great.

341
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:58,458
So, what's after this?

342
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:02,529
After.

343
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,601
We have a stop at a club.

344
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:11,172
- Mm-hm.
- Then we go to a hospital.

345
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:13,440
And the last stop
is at a house.

346
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,743
You're meeting
five people today?

347
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:19,412
No, seven.

348
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:24,185
And you want to know why.

349
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:27,654
Yeah, sorry.

350
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:31,158
It's okay,
human nature.

351
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:39,432
Not too long ago...

352
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:43,536
my daughter and her family
came to Thailand.

353
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:46,908
They got into an accident.

354
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,678
The people
I'll be seeing tonight

355
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:53,546
were involved with it.

356
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:56,017
I see.

357
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,152
Are they okay?

358
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,156
No.

359
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:05,760
They died.

360
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,834
Oh.

361
00:37:15,036 --> 00:37:18,471
I'm... I'm sorry.

362
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,110
It's okay.

363
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:46,701
I was recently
in an accident as well.

364
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,543
White family...

365
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,015
They died too.

366
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,822
Drunk driver.

367
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:14,161
Happens everywhere
in the world.

368
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,169
They have a kid.

369
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:25,206
A child.

370
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:42,890
I'm sorry.

371
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,726
Thank you for bringing me here
and for paying for dinner.

372
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:21,195
- It was excellent.
- You're welcome.

373
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:25,299
And, uh, I'm sorry about
the not so happy conversation.

374
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:27,101
It's okay, it's life.

375
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:30,905
Uh...

376
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:34,607
Do you know
the Ibiza night club?

377
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:39,180
Yeah. Is that
our next destination?

378
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,816
- Yes.
- Okay.

379
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:05,272
A cross, you're not Buddhist?

380
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:07,908
No.

381
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:11,078
I'm not Christian either.

382
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:14,849
Are you atheist?

383
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,751
What's atheist?

384
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:21,688
Atheist is someone who
does not believe in religion.

385
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,728
I believe in faith.

386
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,731
I believe it's good
that people have faith.

387
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:32,199
Do you pray?

388
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,269
Yeah.

389
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,374
May I ask to whom?

390
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:44,644
To my parents.

391
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:52,987
So why the cross?

392
00:40:57,258 --> 00:40:59,760
It belonged to someone I knew.

393
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:04,664
I kept it as a reminder.

394
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,702
Good or bad reminder?

395
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:11,105
Good.

396
00:41:12,206 --> 00:41:14,708
Of something bad I did.

397
00:41:16,277 --> 00:41:18,112
You did something bad?

398
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:22,783
Yeah.

399
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,154
Did anyone get hurt?

400
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:29,957
I don't think so.

401
00:41:32,393 --> 00:41:34,128
But you feel bad.

402
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:38,899
Yeah, I feel...

403
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:43,737
I... I don't know
how to explain.

404
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,106
Guilt.

405
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,143
You feel guilty.

406
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:59,353
Guilt is good.

407
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:04,725
It reminds us to do good.

408
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,128
That's why I kept the cross.

409
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:39,860
Drive around.
Stay close.

410
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:42,529
I'll call,
don't pick up the phone.

411
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:47,001
Meet me over there,
past the entrance,

412
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:49,203
within five minutes
of the phone call.

413
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,072
Okay.

414
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:54,108
Okay.

415
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:29,129
What the fuck, man?

416
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:30,732
- Dominic!
- Holy fuck!

417
00:45:30,765 --> 00:45:34,535
You messed up.
Stay put.

418
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:37,304
What... What do you...
What do you want?

419
00:45:37,337 --> 00:45:41,942
You killed a family with your
Porsche, do you remember?

420
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:46,680
Do you remember?!

421
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:50,217
Yes, yes, yes, yes...
I... I remember.

422
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,686
Just don't... don't...
don't do anything.

423
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,490
Stand up.

424
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:59,259
Wait, no, don't...
Just don't kill...

425
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:01,695
Jesus Christ!

426
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:04,465
- Stand up!
- Okay... I didn't do anything!

427
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:10,705
Do you want...
Do you want my car?

428
00:46:10,738 --> 00:46:13,073
Take it, man, it's yours.

429
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:24,111
- What happened?
- Drive.

430
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:27,749
- What did you do?
- Drive, please.

431
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:33,253
Where's the nearest hospital?

432
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:34,454
Are you hurt?

433
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:37,090
I'm okay, hospital.

434
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:38,692
There's one a few minutes away.

435
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:40,828
Take us there, please.

436
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:43,697
Please!

437
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:03,751
What are you thinking?

438
00:48:03,785 --> 00:48:06,353
I'm thinking there's more.

439
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:10,290
I'm thinking
that it's going to escalate.

440
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:13,828
And I'm thinking he's not
sleeping in a hotel somewhere.

441
00:48:13,861 --> 00:48:16,129
We need to get everything
on these three people.

442
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:20,802
Wife's on it.
She should have something for us soon.

443
00:48:21,903 --> 00:48:23,670
Isn't your son like a week old?

444
00:48:23,705 --> 00:48:28,542
- Nine days.
- Talk about a slave driver.

445
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:30,845
You met my wife, right?

446
00:48:31,913 --> 00:48:34,181
You know she doesn't rest.

447
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:42,322
Speak.

448
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:47,661
All right, thanks.

449
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,297
Seems like you're right again.

450
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,666
- Where?
- Ibiza Night Club.

451
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,902
Twenty-three-year-old,
shot through the chest.

452
00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:59,506
- Witness all claim... old Asian man.
- All right.

453
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:03,210
Wait, boss, there's more.
The kid, he's not dead.

454
00:49:03,243 --> 00:49:05,913
He's being transported
to the hospital as we speak.

455
00:49:05,947 --> 00:49:09,717
You go to the club, get a positive
ID, take a look around,

456
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:11,518
and I'll head over
to the hospital.

457
00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:12,754
Copy that.

458
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:23,230
Can I have a tissue, please?

459
00:49:30,604 --> 00:49:32,172
Thank you.

460
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:15,682
I'm not going to kill you.

461
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:20,287
Nothing has changed.

462
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:24,257
Our deal is still the deal.

463
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,498
It wasn't an accident, right,
me picking you up tonight?

464
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:36,771
No, it wasn't.

465
00:50:39,073 --> 00:50:40,942
I know where you live.

466
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:44,544
I knew your routine.

467
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:52,252
Why?

468
00:50:58,826 --> 00:51:01,261
The family that died
in your car...

469
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:06,566
that was my daughter...

470
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,370
her husband...

471
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,377
and her five-year-old daughter.

472
00:51:20,848 --> 00:51:22,649
My grandchild.

473
00:51:35,997 --> 00:51:38,365
You gonna kill me?

474
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:50,410
It was possible... yes.

475
00:51:52,146 --> 00:51:56,650
It was your car, your signature
on the witness sheet.

476
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:12,033
I swear,
I don't want to kill you.

477
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:14,334
I don't even want to hurt you.

478
00:52:19,606 --> 00:52:22,342
Can you give me
a bottle of water, please?

479
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,656
Thank you.

480
00:52:41,863 --> 00:52:43,130
Drink it.

481
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,546
What changed your mind?

482
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,886
That.

483
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:16,630
I gave that to my daughter...

484
00:53:24,805 --> 00:53:26,774
on her 18th birthday.

485
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:05,046
Anyone who can live
with as much guilt as you do...

486
00:54:07,982 --> 00:54:10,117
over making a choice...

487
00:54:10,985 --> 00:54:12,954
You had no option.

488
00:54:15,723 --> 00:54:20,795
That person has a good heart.

489
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:54,494
You're going to kill him?

490
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:01,534
Yes.

491
00:55:31,032 --> 00:55:33,600
What kind
of fucking place is this?

492
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:38,072
- Is this you?
- What the fuck do you mean?

493
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:39,907
Is this one of
your business associates?

494
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,842
Did you have
some sort of deal go bad?

495
00:55:41,876 --> 00:55:43,310
Fuck you!

496
00:55:43,344 --> 00:55:45,645
Fuck you for even thinking that.

497
00:55:45,678 --> 00:55:47,081
How can I not think it?

498
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:49,616
How many times
have you put us in danger?

499
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:51,252
- Really?
- Yeah.

500
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:54,055
How many times
have you been shot at?

501
00:55:55,089 --> 00:55:56,957
How many times has Dom?

502
00:55:59,093 --> 00:56:02,763
That's right, none.

503
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:04,932
I have never put us in danger.

504
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:09,669
The life I provide you with,

505
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:13,240
ninety-nine percent of the
population would kill for.

506
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:17,178
So, I would appreciate
some respect!

507
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:25,086
The fact that I let you fuck your
little hussies is respect enough.

508
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,155
What, you think I don't know?

509
00:56:28,189 --> 00:56:30,958
You think I'm some <i>farang</i>
who's blind

510
00:56:30,991 --> 00:56:32,393
and doesn't know
what's going on?

511
00:56:32,426 --> 00:56:38,165
Nothing you do goes by me.

512
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:40,034
I can take my son

513
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:44,205
and walk away
with everything you got.

514
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:47,808
I know all
your dirty little secrets.

515
00:56:47,842 --> 00:56:50,744
So the fact
that I'm still standing here,

516
00:56:50,778 --> 00:56:53,247
that's all the respect
you're going to get.

517
00:56:55,082 --> 00:57:00,421
And if my son dies...
I swear to God,

518
00:57:00,454 --> 00:57:04,758
you'll regret the day
that you ever laid eyes on me.

519
00:58:57,271 --> 00:58:58,906
He's a lucky boy.

520
00:59:00,474 --> 00:59:03,444
The bullet went clean through.

521
00:59:03,477 --> 00:59:06,213
All they had to do was clean
his wounds and stitch him up.

522
00:59:07,948 --> 00:59:09,350
He's gonna be okay.

523
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:30,371
You're fired...
useless piece of shit!

524
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,377
You fucking shot my son?!

525
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:42,216
Wait, wait, wait!
What is this all about?

526
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:46,020
Listen, anything you want.
I have so much money.

527
00:59:49,523 --> 00:59:53,827
Your money paid for everything.

528
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,432
Made my son-in-law
into a criminal.

529
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:02,102
You covered your son's crimes!

530
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:08,175
Yeah, you understand now.

531
01:00:10,577 --> 01:00:13,580
I did it to protect my son.

532
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:15,916
Something any father would do.

533
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:21,388
Me too.

534
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:29,963
The apple never falls
far from the tree.

535
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:33,334
He's just a kid.

536
01:00:59,526 --> 01:01:05,332
You're old enough to kill...
you're old enough to die

537
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,172
Well, what do you got?

538
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:47,474
<i>Hurt boobies.</i>

539
01:01:47,508 --> 01:01:49,309
Like father, like son.

540
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:56,150
I found connections between the cops
and the lawyers in over 20 cases.

541
01:01:56,183 --> 01:02:00,988
From small traffic violations
to more serious crimes.

542
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:02,489
Example?

543
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:04,491
<i>Drug and human trafficking,
possession.</i>

544
01:02:04,525 --> 01:02:07,127
<i>You name it,
they worked on it together.</i>

545
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:10,364
And for every instance
the defendants walked.

546
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:13,567
<i>There was only one case involving
the Davis family though.</i>

547
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,005
- Okay.
- A few months ago, the son was involved in an accident.

548
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:20,541
Four people died
and one was injured,

549
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:24,378
including a five-year-old girl.
A British family.

550
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:27,281
- Not American?
- <i>No, British.</i>

551
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:30,484
- The Coopers.
- And the son got acquitted.

552
01:02:30,517 --> 01:02:34,388
Turns out the husband
was the one driving the taxi.

553
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:39,159
Paid the driver extra,
said he always wanted to drive in Bangkok.

554
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:42,696
Got confused,
drove right onto coming traffic.

555
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,132
And ran directly into the son.

556
01:02:45,165 --> 01:02:47,735
<i>Yeah,
that's the official version.</i>

557
01:02:47,769 --> 01:02:50,604
No, thanks to our
two dead friends, I'm sure.

558
01:02:50,637 --> 01:02:52,105
Right.

559
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:55,242
Your thoughts?

560
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:58,312
<i>My thoughts are the same,
the law is the law.</i>

561
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:01,014
Vigilante justice
is still homicide.

562
01:03:11,793 --> 01:03:13,360
Drop it!

563
01:03:15,596 --> 01:03:16,731
Now!

564
01:03:19,533 --> 01:03:22,737
Okay, man, relax.

565
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,372
I'm putting down the gun.

566
01:03:30,778 --> 01:03:32,714
Look, I know everything.

567
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:35,349
The son, he killed
your family, right?

568
01:03:37,184 --> 01:03:38,652
Son or daughter?

569
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:44,024
My daughter.

570
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,463
I understand, but no one
needs to get hurt anymore.

571
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:53,433
Oh, yes, one more person,
then it's done.

572
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:57,304
The only person
that is gonna get hurt is you.

573
01:03:58,138 --> 01:04:00,274
If you continue this.

574
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:01,809
Put down the gun.

575
01:04:01,843 --> 01:04:05,245
Come on, man,
let's handle this the right way.

576
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:06,513
The legal way.

577
01:04:06,547 --> 01:04:08,315
Yeah, that didn't
work out too well

578
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:10,284
for my daughter and her family.

579
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:13,287
<i>And that's on us,
and I apologize.</i>

580
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,822
But there's
good and bad everywhere.

581
01:04:14,856 --> 01:04:18,225
- Yeah.
- They were bad people

582
01:04:18,258 --> 01:04:19,794
pretending to be good.

583
01:04:19,827 --> 01:04:21,628
You are good doing bad,

584
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:23,363
and two wrongs
don't make it right, man.

585
01:04:23,397 --> 01:04:25,399
Nothing will make this right,
not even this.

586
01:04:25,432 --> 01:04:28,235
- So why are we doing this?
- Because I can.

587
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:30,671
Because no one else did.

588
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:35,509
Don't.

589
01:04:36,711 --> 01:04:38,178
I don't want to shoot you,

590
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:40,514
I don't want to shoot her,
but I will.

591
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:42,082
Stay there.

592
01:04:50,524 --> 01:04:52,326
Go, go, go!

593
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:53,560
Go.

594
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:00,735
No!

595
01:05:00,768 --> 01:05:02,336
Kai!

596
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:05,305
No, fuckin' stay there!

597
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:06,841
Kai, you're not
gonna shoot me.

598
01:05:06,874 --> 01:05:09,142
- I will shoot you!
- Let her go.

599
01:05:09,176 --> 01:05:11,746
I'm not letting her go.
I'm not letting her go!

600
01:05:11,779 --> 01:05:13,915
Kai, please let her go,
she didn't do anything.

601
01:05:13,948 --> 01:05:17,150
- I don't want to hurt her!
- I don't have a gun.

602
01:05:17,184 --> 01:05:18,820
Kai, calm down.
That's not you,

603
01:05:18,853 --> 01:05:20,554
you're not that type of man.

604
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:23,290
- They're already dead.
- Stay there!

605
01:05:23,323 --> 01:05:27,227
Kai, they're all dead.
Let her go, please.

606
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,897
- I'm begging you.
- I'm gonna shoot you.

607
01:05:29,931 --> 01:05:31,833
I'm gonna shoot you.

608
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,166
I'll shoot you.

609
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,202
Kai, let her go!

610
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:36,938
You want to shoot me,
then shoot me!

611
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:39,172
But you fucking let her go now!

612
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:41,475
That's not you, Kai!

613
01:05:41,508 --> 01:05:44,277
Let her go!
Okay?

614
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:47,381
I'm a father, just like you.

615
01:05:47,414 --> 01:05:50,217
Just like you,
I'm a father, I understand,

616
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:54,454
but please, just let her go.
Please.

617
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:58,291
Kai... Kai, listen to me.

618
01:05:59,961 --> 01:06:01,528
Let her go.

619
01:06:13,007 --> 01:06:14,541
No!

620
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:19,446
That's on you!
That's on you!

621
01:06:22,784 --> 01:06:24,317
No!

622
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:29,322
Help! Help me!

623
01:06:29,356 --> 01:06:31,625
Officer down! Two down!

624
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:33,928
Come on, bro, hang in there,
hang in there.

625
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:36,731
I didn't kill her, right?

626
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:40,001
No, you didn't, she's good.
She's going to make it. Okay.

627
01:06:57,752 --> 01:06:59,653
Fuck!

628
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,728
Fuck.

629
01:09:14,188 --> 01:09:16,157
This is a surprise.

630
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,657
Where are you?

631
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:19,827
I don't know.

632
01:09:19,861 --> 01:09:22,129
<i>There are cops everywhere.</i>

633
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:24,631
Yeah, I know.

634
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:27,935
Didn't go quite as well
as planned.

635
01:09:28,936 --> 01:09:30,104
Send me your location.

636
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:33,506
They don't know my car,
I'm close.

637
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:34,942
<i>I'll come pick you up.</i>

638
01:09:38,645 --> 01:09:39,981
All right.

639
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:42,183
Park in the alley.

640
01:09:42,216 --> 01:09:44,085
I'll see you when you pull up.

641
01:10:28,162 --> 01:10:29,864
Stay low.

642
01:10:45,512 --> 01:10:48,515
Thank you.

643
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:55,823
Where are we going?

644
01:10:55,856 --> 01:10:58,092
You're bleeding,
we need to fix you.

645
01:10:59,693 --> 01:11:01,494
I'm fine.

646
01:11:04,231 --> 01:11:06,200
Bullet went through.

647
01:11:06,233 --> 01:11:09,770
- How do you know?
- I felt it.

648
01:11:09,804 --> 01:11:12,472
But I can't go to a hospital.

649
01:11:13,274 --> 01:11:14,909
I'm serious.

650
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:19,714
The detective, he's good.
It won't take him long

651
01:11:19,747 --> 01:11:21,949
before he figure's out
who the last target is.

652
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:25,720
And the last target himself...

653
01:11:25,753 --> 01:11:27,822
He's gonna know what's
going on in the next hour...

654
01:11:28,823 --> 01:11:30,157
and disappear.

655
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:34,996
We're not going to the hospital,
don't worry.

656
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:36,864
It's not too far away.

657
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:57,484
Thank you.

658
01:12:19,672 --> 01:12:21,142
How are you holding up?

659
01:12:24,245 --> 01:12:25,612
Better.

660
01:12:32,053 --> 01:12:33,721
You did your best.

661
01:12:34,722 --> 01:12:36,057
I heard everything.

662
01:12:37,725 --> 01:12:39,894
Kid was 29.

663
01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:44,031
He shot a nurse.

664
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:46,867
She was 24.

665
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:54,607
He's not a kid.

666
01:12:56,077 --> 01:12:57,912
There's another target.

667
01:13:00,014 --> 01:13:01,782
I know.

668
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:03,150
That's why I'm here.

669
01:13:06,253 --> 01:13:08,289
You remember the accident?

670
01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:10,891
There was one person
who was injured.

671
01:13:10,925 --> 01:13:12,993
Didn't die.

672
01:13:13,027 --> 01:13:15,796
Her name was Vanida Hoffsted.

673
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:18,132
She was a cab driver.

674
01:13:18,165 --> 01:13:20,633
The girl that testified
at the trial.

675
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:21,702
Yeah.

676
01:13:22,703 --> 01:13:24,105
Earlier tonight,

677
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:28,275
she picked up someone
from On Nut Road around 8:00 pm.

678
01:13:28,309 --> 01:13:33,646
Two hours later,
dropped him off on Silom Road.

679
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,648
Near the law offices?

680
01:13:37,985 --> 01:13:40,154
Well, where is she now?

681
01:13:40,187 --> 01:13:42,389
She turned her app off
after that.

682
01:13:42,423 --> 01:13:45,860
She was driving a new Volvo.
I have the plates.

683
01:13:45,893 --> 01:13:47,660
We can track her.

684
01:13:47,694 --> 01:13:49,964
It'll show up
if she's on the road.

685
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:53,734
- Put everything on it.
- I already ordered it.

686
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:56,303
Of course you did, babe.

687
01:14:00,007 --> 01:14:02,810
- You saw the photos.
- Stop.

688
01:14:04,078 --> 01:14:06,646
I know you're
a good-hearted person...

689
01:14:08,015 --> 01:14:10,117
but he's still
a cold-blooded murderer.

690
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:13,120
He never was one.

691
01:14:13,154 --> 01:14:16,857
He served in the military;
two tours, 40 years ago.

692
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:21,829
After that,
not even a single blemish.

693
01:14:21,862 --> 01:14:26,000
- Not even a traffic violation.
- He's still a murderer.

694
01:14:27,334 --> 01:14:29,870
He's also a father.

695
01:14:29,904 --> 01:14:31,671
Just like you.

696
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:36,911
What are you trying to say,
I should just drop everything?

697
01:14:36,944 --> 01:14:40,314
No, but I know you.

698
01:14:40,347 --> 01:14:43,951
You just watched your young
partner get shot and die.

699
01:14:43,984 --> 01:14:47,221
You're operating
on emotions right now.

700
01:14:47,254 --> 01:14:50,824
I'm just here
to give you some balance.

701
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:59,266
You're a good man, like him.

702
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:02,069
I don't want to see you
do a bad thing.

703
01:15:03,103 --> 01:15:05,206
Two wrongs don't make a right.

704
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:08,809
I gotta go work.

705
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:15,482
Look at him.

706
01:15:21,222 --> 01:15:22,856
Now look at me.

707
01:15:26,227 --> 01:15:28,295
You're a good cop, babe.

708
01:15:29,997 --> 01:15:35,336
But remember, you're a father
now, first and foremost.

709
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:38,405
Then a husband, then a cop.

710
01:15:44,345 --> 01:15:47,214
- I love you.
- Ditto.

711
01:16:19,346 --> 01:16:21,081
Oh, my God.

712
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:46,106
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

713
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:50,477
Uh, do you have
some saline or some alcohol

714
01:16:50,511 --> 01:16:52,046
- or something first?
- Oh, right, yes.

715
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:53,447
Oh, fuck.

716
01:16:55,082 --> 01:16:57,451
- All right. Oh, thanks.
- Sorry.

717
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:01,889
Oh, my gosh,
that's a lot of blood.

718
01:17:12,599 --> 01:17:14,001
Okay...

719
01:17:19,006 --> 01:17:20,541
Are you ready?

720
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:23,310
Okay, this is gonna hurt.

721
01:17:48,936 --> 01:17:50,537
Why'd you come back?

722
01:17:52,473 --> 01:17:54,041
Sorry.

723
01:18:05,018 --> 01:18:07,988
I had a chance to correct
the wrong that I did.

724
01:18:09,957 --> 01:18:11,892
So I made a choice.

725
01:18:16,263 --> 01:18:20,067
You said we live with the
consequences of our own choice.

726
01:18:22,269 --> 01:18:24,338
I made a bad one before.

727
01:18:27,274 --> 01:18:29,410
You didn't have a choice.

728
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:31,979
I know that now.

729
01:18:35,249 --> 01:18:36,383
Ow.

730
01:18:36,417 --> 01:18:39,219
Okay.

731
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:51,365
They gave me two million baht...
and this car.

732
01:18:57,404 --> 01:19:00,641
They told me to say that I
wasn't the one who was driving.

733
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:05,479
That our car hit the other car.

734
01:19:10,217 --> 01:19:12,352
If I didn't take the offer...

735
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:16,190
I believe that they were
probably going to kill me.

736
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:19,626
Yes.

737
01:19:20,661 --> 01:19:22,196
They would have.

738
01:19:24,097 --> 01:19:27,000
I spent most of my money
on my brother.

739
01:19:28,268 --> 01:19:31,605
Paid in advance
for his hospital expenses.

740
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:35,008
There's not much left now.

741
01:19:41,081 --> 01:19:44,351
Well, turn around,
you've got one more to go.

742
01:19:54,261 --> 01:19:55,429
Ooh.

743
01:19:57,464 --> 01:19:59,266
This is gonna hurt more.

744
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:10,778
All right, last one.
Take a deep breath.

745
01:20:19,787 --> 01:20:21,255
Thank you.

746
01:20:22,589 --> 01:20:24,625
It's gonna leave a big scar.

747
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:28,662
It's okay.
It's a good reminder.

748
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:31,265
Of what, tonight?

749
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:34,401
Of you.

750
01:20:34,434 --> 01:20:36,303
Jack of all trades.

751
01:20:45,178 --> 01:20:48,248
I actually have one more reason
why I came back.

752
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:02,529
I started driving two years ago.

753
01:21:04,398 --> 01:21:08,235
Before this, I used to work
in hotels and restaurants.

754
01:21:11,806 --> 01:21:14,608
I meet a lot of foreigners
everywhere I work.

755
01:21:16,778 --> 01:21:22,717
All the foreigners,
they see me, they like me.

756
01:21:24,819 --> 01:21:27,621
They offered money
for me to sleep with them.

757
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:33,560
But I'd never take it.

758
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:37,631
You understand?

759
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:50,444
You're the first man
that I've met... in my life

760
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:53,347
that showed me respect.

761
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:59,386
Who actually gave me
respect for what I do.

762
01:22:00,253 --> 01:22:01,655
My work.

763
01:22:01,688 --> 01:22:04,124
Not for what I look like.

764
01:22:11,231 --> 01:22:13,200
That's why I came back.

765
01:22:22,242 --> 01:22:26,914
That's the nicest thing anyone
has said to me since... my wife.

766
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,786
It's the truth.

767
01:22:33,888 --> 01:22:35,522
Makes it nicer.

768
01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:42,262
Stay here.

769
01:22:54,574 --> 01:22:55,710
Hold this.

770
01:22:58,478 --> 01:23:02,516
There's $4,000 cash
in this bag.

771
01:23:04,752 --> 01:23:06,253
It's yours.

772
01:23:07,889 --> 01:23:09,589
Do you know Bitcoin?

773
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,592
Bit... coin.

774
01:23:12,626 --> 01:23:15,228
Yeah, I think so.

775
01:23:15,262 --> 01:23:16,898
You know it's money?

776
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:19,232
Like electronic money.

777
01:23:19,266 --> 01:23:22,436
I read something online,
but I'm not sure.

778
01:23:22,469 --> 01:23:25,940
Okay, it's not hard
to find out about.

779
01:23:25,973 --> 01:23:29,309
Inside that bag
is a hard drive.

780
01:23:30,912 --> 01:23:33,480
My life savings.

781
01:23:33,513 --> 01:23:37,517
One-million, three-hundred and
eighty-nine thousand dollars.

782
01:23:39,921 --> 01:23:41,555
It's yours.

783
01:23:43,024 --> 01:23:44,959
No, no, no, no,
I cannot take this.

784
01:23:44,992 --> 01:23:46,426
- No, no, no. Listen to me.
- No, no, I cannot.

785
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:48,295
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- No.

786
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:50,798
I converted it to bitcoin.

787
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,701
I didn't know what else to do.

788
01:23:53,735 --> 01:23:55,602
Uh, I was thinking, maybe,

789
01:23:55,635 --> 01:23:58,405
I could donate it
to charity afterwards,

790
01:23:58,438 --> 01:24:01,675
but there is no
afterwards for me.

791
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,678
What do you mean?

792
01:24:06,413 --> 01:24:10,785
I mean, the last guy
is different from the others.

793
01:24:10,818 --> 01:24:13,320
He's much more dangerous.

794
01:24:13,353 --> 01:24:14,621
Much smarter.

795
01:24:14,654 --> 01:24:17,058
Better guarded.

796
01:24:17,091 --> 01:24:19,459
So you think you cannot win?

797
01:24:21,495 --> 01:24:23,630
It was never about
winning for me.

798
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:29,669
Even if I survive,
I'll go to prison.

799
01:24:29,704 --> 01:24:31,605
I should go to prison.

800
01:24:32,907 --> 01:24:34,976
But I can't go there,
you understand?

801
01:24:41,048 --> 01:24:42,817
I understand.

802
01:24:46,087 --> 01:24:49,322
So you must take this.

803
01:24:50,825 --> 01:24:55,362
Because if you take this,
you win.

804
01:24:56,496 --> 01:24:59,666
And if you win, I win.

805
01:25:01,702 --> 01:25:06,540
You take your brother
and you get some passports.

806
01:25:06,573 --> 01:25:10,111
And you take him to some country
that doesn't speak Thai,

807
01:25:10,144 --> 01:25:12,312
if that's what you really want.

808
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:15,615
Okay?

809
01:25:18,418 --> 01:25:19,686
Okay.

810
01:25:33,734 --> 01:25:35,002
Thank you.

811
01:25:41,142 --> 01:25:42,642
You're welcome.

812
01:26:02,462 --> 01:26:03,865
Who is this man?

813
01:26:06,734 --> 01:26:08,535
He's Japanese.

814
01:26:09,804 --> 01:26:13,373
- Like Yakuza?
- No.

815
01:26:14,175 --> 01:26:15,776
But he works with them.

816
01:26:17,544 --> 01:26:19,914
He works with anyone
who can pay his price.

817
01:26:19,947 --> 01:26:23,450
Which is... very high.

818
01:26:23,483 --> 01:26:24,819
To do what?

819
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:28,521
To solve problems.

820
01:26:29,724 --> 01:26:30,992
Like?

821
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:35,730
Like, if you kill someone

822
01:26:35,763 --> 01:26:37,965
and you need to
get rid of the body.

823
01:26:37,999 --> 01:26:42,737
If you get arrested for drunk
driving, killing a family...

824
01:26:43,704 --> 01:26:45,538
he can fix it.

825
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:51,078
He's a really bad man then.

826
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,715
One of the worst.

827
01:26:54,749 --> 01:26:58,485
A type of person who can do
a lot of bad things

828
01:26:58,518 --> 01:27:00,955
and not get dirty for it.

829
01:27:02,689 --> 01:27:05,126
Well, you seem to know
a lot about him.

830
01:27:10,664 --> 01:27:12,033
I hired him.

831
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:15,002
What?

832
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:16,636
He arranged everything for me.

833
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:21,441
The bag, the gun,
the phone, everything.

834
01:27:23,543 --> 01:27:28,548
Oh, well,
you're really smart, Mr. Kai.

835
01:29:27,268 --> 01:29:31,038
Don't go.
Make a choice.

836
01:29:32,973 --> 01:29:35,608
Take me and my brother
to Hawaii.

837
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:40,680
We can go fishing.

838
01:29:46,187 --> 01:29:47,988
That would be nice.

839
01:29:49,423 --> 01:29:53,894
<i>Fishing with you...
and your brother.</i>

840
01:30:03,304 --> 01:30:04,772
Good luck...

841
01:30:08,142 --> 01:30:09,743
Khun Fha.

842
01:32:14,435 --> 01:32:15,936
Hey!

843
01:32:19,139 --> 01:32:21,508
Hey, you motherfucker!

844
01:32:23,043 --> 01:32:25,112
You got all these guys
fighting for you,

845
01:32:25,145 --> 01:32:27,081
you can't do it yourself?

846
01:32:27,848 --> 01:32:30,818
Huh? One guy.

847
01:32:30,851 --> 01:32:33,020
One guy!

848
01:32:33,053 --> 01:32:37,191
Huh? You fucker!
Come out!

849
01:32:37,224 --> 01:32:38,759
Come out!

850
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,363
You, deal with me, old man!

851
01:32:42,396 --> 01:32:43,931
Tough guy!

852
01:32:43,964 --> 01:32:45,966
Come here, fuck head!

853
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,101
Huh?

854
01:32:48,168 --> 01:32:49,803
You want me to come inside?

855
01:32:49,837 --> 01:32:52,773
I'll fucking come inside.
I'll find you.

856
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,188
Hold on a second.

857
01:33:15,129 --> 01:33:17,264
You're really aggressive.

858
01:33:17,298 --> 01:33:19,133
You've got nice hair.

859
01:33:21,201 --> 01:33:25,105
I admire you, I really do.

860
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:27,374
You know, it's impressive
what you've done here tonight.

861
01:33:27,408 --> 01:33:29,476
Well, I'm not finished yet.

862
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:31,812
And I'm only getting started.

863
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:35,849
As you know,
I don't usually

864
01:33:35,883 --> 01:33:38,552
involve myself personally
in anything.

865
01:33:38,585 --> 01:33:42,456
I like to manipulate things.

866
01:33:43,657 --> 01:33:45,592
But I'm really gonna
enjoy this.

867
01:33:48,595 --> 01:33:51,498
It's been a long time
since I killed anyone.

868
01:34:04,044 --> 01:34:06,613
You shot a 22-year-old boy.

869
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:09,883
That's cold-blooded, dude.

870
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:16,623
Yeah, well... I'm not done yet.

871
01:34:16,657 --> 01:34:20,227
You Hawaiian man.

872
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,863
They certainly don't
make 'em like you anymore.

873
01:34:24,531 --> 01:34:27,234
You're pissed at me because
I helped some rich parents

874
01:34:27,267 --> 01:34:29,269
get their son off.

875
01:34:29,303 --> 01:34:31,004
I didn't kill your family.

876
01:34:31,038 --> 01:34:33,307
They'd be dead
if I stepped in or not.

877
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:36,276
So is this all worth it?

878
01:34:39,046 --> 01:34:40,414
Yeah.

879
01:34:41,215 --> 01:34:42,583
It's worth it.

880
01:34:43,484 --> 01:34:44,918
Maybe.

881
01:34:46,387 --> 01:34:48,122
I took my shot.

882
01:34:51,225 --> 01:34:52,626
Now you take yours.

883
01:35:28,162 --> 01:35:29,530
Come on!

884
01:35:42,609 --> 01:35:45,078
Ow, fuck!

885
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,048
Shit.

886
01:35:50,551 --> 01:35:52,152
Goddamn.

887
01:35:54,288 --> 01:35:55,622
Kai!

888
01:35:59,326 --> 01:36:01,261
I should just shoot you.

889
01:36:01,729 --> 01:36:03,297
Kai, Kai...

890
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:05,666
It's me.

891
01:36:07,401 --> 01:36:09,102
Who the fuck are you?

892
01:36:09,737 --> 01:36:11,538
Who the fuck are you?

893
01:36:14,241 --> 01:36:16,610
You're the cab driver.

894
01:36:16,643 --> 01:36:18,713
She's not involved.

895
01:36:21,081 --> 01:36:23,584
Wait, you actually
care about her?

896
01:36:23,617 --> 01:36:25,285
She took bribe money.

897
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:29,623
Yeah, you didn't
give her a choice.

898
01:36:29,656 --> 01:36:33,260
True. Details.

899
01:36:34,495 --> 01:36:36,129
Let her go.

900
01:36:36,163 --> 01:36:38,733
How the fuck
are you still standing?

901
01:36:39,701 --> 01:36:41,235
Please...

902
01:36:42,302 --> 01:36:43,604
let her go.

903
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:50,143
I'm gonna have to say no.

904
01:36:51,445 --> 01:36:54,248
But I'm gonna be a nice guy.

905
01:36:54,281 --> 01:36:59,353
I'm gonna give you a choice.
Who do I shoot first?

906
01:37:10,364 --> 01:37:11,698
Sorry.

907
01:37:14,334 --> 01:37:15,770
Me too.

908
01:37:24,378 --> 01:37:25,512
Her.

909
01:37:28,215 --> 01:37:30,250
Wise choice.

910
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,374
Is this on me too?

911
01:37:57,177 --> 01:37:59,112
I'm sorry about the cop.

912
01:38:01,214 --> 01:38:02,817
And the nurse.

913
01:38:06,687 --> 01:38:11,091
She has all the evidence
to clear my family's name.

914
01:38:11,859 --> 01:38:13,360
Please, do it.

915
01:38:17,765 --> 01:38:19,600
I held her hostage.

916
01:38:20,935 --> 01:38:23,136
I threatened her brother.

917
01:38:24,839 --> 01:38:26,808
I forced her into this.

918
01:38:30,677 --> 01:38:32,546
Please, call an ambulance.

919
01:38:34,247 --> 01:38:35,549
I already have.

920
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:37,684
I'm dead.

921
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:40,487
You know that.

922
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:46,693
I know I don't deserve it...

923
01:38:48,462 --> 01:38:50,364
but I have a request.

924
01:39:31,005 --> 01:39:32,539
Thank you.
