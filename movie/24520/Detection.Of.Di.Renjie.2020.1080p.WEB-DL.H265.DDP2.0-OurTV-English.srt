1
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,150
Fairy flies on a rainy night

2
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,360
Riding the misty waves of the Milky Way

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,270
Beauties get drunk and flush

4
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,950
Dancing and singing tirelessly

5
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,080
Fantastic

6
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,320
Hey, look

7
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,800
A flying fairy

8
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,670
Look there

9
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,440
Dear guests

10
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,320
Look there

11
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,630
Cast money right now

12
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,160
A flying fairy

13
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,880
It’s a flying fairy

14
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,110
Flying Apsaras

15
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,600
Flying Apsaras is to kill me

16
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,910
Flying Apsaras is to kill me

17
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,960
No poisoning

18
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,910
The cause of death is not questionable

19
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,470
Did this man also work with Yungefang

20
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,830
He is the chief trainer of Yungefang

21
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,720
Diao Sanye

22
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,270
Who fell into the Mirror Lake and got drowned seven days ago

23
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,440
The cause of death is not questionable

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,670
Yes

25
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,790
Keep away from her

26
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,920
I’m wondering

27
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,640
Why they smiled

28
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,670
Before death

29
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,110
How can I know

30
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,720
I am responsible for autopsy only. I am not a spirit rapper

31
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,350
Hand it to your superior Mr. Jiang

32
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,510
Cause of death unquestionable

33
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,950
Death from an accidental fall

34
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,670
Everyone

35
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,230
This way please

36
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,830
Months ago

37
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,760
One night Lord of Yan State

38
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Suddenly dreamed a flying Apsaras

39
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,670
An auspicious sign

40
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,160
As expected

41
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,040
In order to commend his meritorious military service

42
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,320
The emperor issued an edict

43
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,270
To have a shrine of remembrance built

44
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,480
The Lord of Yan State invited a painter with a high payment

45
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,670
To paint a mural of flying Apsaras

46
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,550
Unexpectedly

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,950
Three months have passed

48
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,600
But the mural has not been completed

49
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,950
Until one rainy night seven days ago

50
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,600
On the wall of the Flying Apsaras Hall of the shrine

51
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,350
Suddenly appeared a mural of flying Apsaras

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,950
That night

53
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,110
Some witnessed

54
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,110
Diao Sanye, the chief trainer of Yungefang

55
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,350
Humming a tune at a pavilion near the lake

56
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,480
Suddenly jump into the lake

57
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,720
My poor Piaopiao

58
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,920
You have stayed by my side since your childhood

59
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,880
For so many years

60
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,040
You have gone through all sorts of ordeal

61
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,790
Why did you die suddenly

62
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,000
Next month

63
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,720
The Shrine of Remembrance will be completed

64
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:53,320
The Lord of Yan will invite you to dance in his banquet

65
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,110
How should I explain it to him

66
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,320
Sir

67
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,000
You should help us

68
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,950
I am going to die

69
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,350
I am going to die

70
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,950
Qiuniang

71
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,350
How can you make sure that

72
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,830
The gossip is not true

73
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,830
You short lived little hoof

74
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,950
What nonsense you are saying

75
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,830
Let me tell all of you

76
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,760
If Yungefang were to be shut

77
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,670
All of you will have a hard time

78
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,880
Excuse me, girl

79
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,600
May I ask

80
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,390
Your name

81
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,230
Li Luoyu

82
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,230
You are also a dancing girl of Yungefang

83
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,550
How did you get along with Yun Piaopiao

84
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,720
Our relationship was not good

85
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,830
If there were only a person in Yungefang

86
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,070
To hate Yun Piaopiao

87
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,040
That must be me

88
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,950
Because before she became popular

89
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,510
Depending on the music of Flying Fairy

90
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,760
I had been the most popular dancer in Yungefang

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,230
You are honest

92
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,720
Sir

93
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,760
Even if I did not tell you this

94
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,000
You would find it out if you were careful

95
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,760
I have one more question

96
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,510
What does the sentence you spoke to Qiuniang

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,790
mean

98
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,760
Sir

99
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,830
Do you believe that

100
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,230
The behaviors and conduct of everyone

101
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,070
Are being observed by the heaven

102
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,070
Yes, I think so

103
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,670
You mean

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,640
You also believe that

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,720
The Flying Apsaras can claim one’s life

106
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,280
Sometimes one thing is beyond human’s power

107
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,230
The heaven will do the thing instead

108
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:12,880
Who are you

109
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,670
Rude

110
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,550
What are you doing

111
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,320
You are an Imperial Guard

112
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,150
Girl

113
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,670
Come over to warm yourself

114
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,880
Come over to warm yourself

115
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,400
Do I need to be away for a while

116
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,960
I began to practice martial arts at ten

117
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,000
And joined the Imperial Guards at sixteen

118
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,840
There’s nothing I’ve never experienced

119
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,080
So

120
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,710
It’s a big deal

121
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,790
All right, all right

122
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,520
All right

123
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,550
You’re really

124
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,790
Really an extraordinary woman

125
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,470
However

126
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,350
How could you attack me

127
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,670
Without saying anything as we met

128
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,000
You have stolen into the Hall of Flying Apsaras

129
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,880
I don’t know you

130
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,640
Of course I will take you to the Imperial Guards first

131
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,440
I was sent here to look into the case of Yungefang

132
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,280
My investigation here is perfectly justified

133
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,350
But I’m wondering why

134
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,440
A senior official of the Imperial Guards

135
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,110
Also cared about a homicide case of the folks

136
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,400
A dancing girl of Yungefang had died

137
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,200
Naturally it is not our business

138
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,440
But if someone took the chance to spread a rumour

139
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,080
And slander an official appointed by the imperial court

140
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,550
That would be different

141
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,590
I have heard about it

142
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,280
Someone said

143
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,230
The Lord of Yan State

144
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,790
Did not deserve the Shrine of Remembrance

145
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,880
So

146
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,320
The Flying Apsaras had claimed

147
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,840
Lives of some victims

148
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,710
The Lord of Yan State has rendered numerous military services

149
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,880
If he did not deserve it, who deserved it

150
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,000
If I found out who spread the rumour

151
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,230
I would have not forgiven him easily

152
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,670
You didn’t believe that Flying Apsaras claimed lives either

153
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,440
Even if it were really so

154
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,320
I would also capture one and question him about all details

155
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Senior officials

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,150
Why not drink a bowl of ginger soup to dispel the coldness

157
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,150
Have you seen the Flying Apsaras

158
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,400
Yes, I have

159
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
You are deliberately mystifying

160
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,400
The rumour must have been fabricated by you

161
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,470
Don’t be afraid

162
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,470
Just tell us

163
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,880
What you have known

164
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,470
As long as you tell us the truth

165
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,350
We will not make you feel awkward

166
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,790
Three months ago

167
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,520
I received an invitation letter from the mansion of the Lord of Yan State

168
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,520
Asking me

169
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,710
To paint a mural of Flying Apsaras for the Shrine of Remembrance

170
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,110
However, however I tried

171
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,670
I had failed to finish the mural all the time

172
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,760
One night, it was raining heavily

173
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
I passed the Hall of Flying Apsaras

174
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,790
Suddenly I saw some light came from inside

175
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,440
I thought that some thief must have entered the hall

176
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
But as I approached the gate and looked inside

177
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,230
The next day

178
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,350
I heard that Diao Sanye of Yungefang

179
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,030
Fell into the Mirror Lake and was drowned

180
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,840
So you spread the rumour

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,440
Saying that the Flying Apsaras had killed Diao Sanye

182
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,670
No, no, I haven’t

183
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,520
I went to Qiuniang

184
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:37,760
I went to Qiuniang

185
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,910
For what

186
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,030
Because six characters appeared on the wall that night

187
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,590
Whoever insults the Flying Apsaras will be killed

188
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,030
Though the characters had just flashed

189
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,030
I had seen them clearly

190
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,280
So I went to persuade Qiuniang

191
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,230
To ask Yun Piaopiao to stop performing the dance of Flying Fairy

192
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,670
However, I was beaten and repelled by her

193
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,110
As a result, in less than ten days

194
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,350
¬

195
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,520
The Flying Apsaras made her power felt again

196
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,030
Yun Piaopiao also died

197
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,230
If the remarks of He Ziwen

198
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,960
Were utilized by someone

199
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,030
It would harm the reputation of Lord of Yan State

200
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,880
However at the moment

201
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,590
The rumour of Flying Apsaras claiming lives has spread widely

202
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,280
If you really care about Lord of Yan State

203
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,790
You should investigate the case with me at once

204
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,150
To appease the rumour

205
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,790
Investigate with you

206
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,230
Correct

207
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,840
Nonsense

208
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,910
You’re only an inferior officer

209
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,150
Who has been just transferred into the capital

210
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,110
Do you know how many gates

211
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,080
How many palaces

212
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,670
How many neighborhoods in Chang’an

213
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,710
How can you boast about investigating the case

214
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,590
Then, Miss Xie

215
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,280
Do you dare to have a bet with me

216
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,880
What’s the bet

217
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,760
Let’s see who has cracked

218
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,200
This case first in ten days

219
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,110
If you win

220
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,200
I will be at your disposal in the future

221
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,320
If I win

222
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,670
Can you give me your sword

223
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:53,960
All right

224
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,960
It’s deal

225
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,470
Don’t follow me anymore

226
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,880
What are you looking at

227
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
Girl, can’t you change your bad habit

228
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,550
Of pulling out your sword to fight as soon as we meet

229
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Haven’t I told you not to follow me

230
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,280
You have wronged me

231
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,520
As I have already arrived

232
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,840
Let me guess

233
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,910
Miss Xie

234
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,080
You must be doubting that it’s Qiuniang that has spread the rumour

235
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,350
So you come to question her

236
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,590
But

237
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,880
You will be disappointed

238
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,110
Qiuniang is a businessperson

239
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,150
Doing so is

240
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,350
Of no good to her

241
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,790
But why you are here

242
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,840
Because I ran into a girl at Yungefang in daytime

243
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,310
And I’m a bit curious about her

244
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,349
So

245
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,800
I come here to ask Qiuniang about her

246
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,710
Oh

247
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,160
Don’t misunderstand me

248
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,310
I mean

249
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,800
There’s no trauma

250
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,040
She should have hung herself to death

251
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
Did Qiuniang lock

252
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,350
The doors and windows of her room in daily time

253
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,350
Sir

254
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,280
Qiuniang was afraid of heat in daily time

255
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,400
Now it’s hot summer

256
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,110
She should have opened the skylight

257
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,800
Miss Li

258
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,590
Have you witnessed

259
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,830
Qiuniang hanging herself

260
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,590
Yes

261
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,640
I came to Qiuniang to discuss some issue

262
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,880
But as I went inside, I saw

263
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,160
I don’t know why Qiuniang take things too hard

264
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,040
Bad

265
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,230
It must be the Flying Apsaras again

266
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,640
Stop talking nonsense, otherwise you will be taken to Imperial Guards

267
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,400
How domineering you are, Commandant Xie

268
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,950
Now that the cause of death has been found out

269
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,280
I have to go now

270
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,190
Goodbye

271
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,110
Goodbye, Mr. Meng

272
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,350
No wonder Miss Li is afraid

273
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,800
Look at this room

274
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,190
All doors and windows are tightly locked

275
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,230
If Qiuniang had not hung herself

276
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,520
Her life may have been claimed by Flying Apsaras

277
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,560
Di Renjie

278
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,470
You must also want to taste the whip of Imperial Guards

279
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,280
As the coroner had just said

280
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,920
Qiuniang had hang herself

281
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,950
No more Flying Apsaras

282
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,070
Otherwise you will be arrested right now

283
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,040
Take it easy, Miss Xie

284
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,920
The death of Qiuniang

285
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,310
Was naturally not caused by Flying Apsaras

286
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,880
However

287
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,680
She had not hang herself

288
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,590
As Xiao Kui said

289
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,470
The windows of this room

290
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,350
Were originally opened

291
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,680
If

292
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,920
Qiuniang wanted to commit suicide

293
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,950
Just think about it

294
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,880
Will a person to commit suicide

295
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,470
Have the time to

296
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,000
Lock all doors and windows

297
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,040
Besides if her life

298
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,350
Was claimed by Flying Apsaras

299
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,590
It would be more impossible

300
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,590
For her to

301
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,070
Escape after locking doors and windows

302
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,520
In this case

303
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,830
There is only one possible explanation

304
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,070
The murderer had locked the doors and windows on purpose

305
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,760
To make us believe

306
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,950
That Qiuniang had hung herself

307
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,400
Smar

308
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,430
But he was too clever by doing so

309
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,070
Because it had aroused my doubt

310
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,310
But how did the murderer

311
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,190
Escape from the room as all

312
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,000
Doors and windows are locked

313
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,000
This is similar

314
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,160
To the death of Diao Sanye and Yun Piaopiao

315
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,110
But at present

316
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,920
We have not found any evidence

317
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,710
Miss Li

318
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,110
Do you know He Ziwen

319
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,710
No

320
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,760
Mr. Di

321
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,800
Mr. Di

322
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,400
You have been busy for one day

323
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,350
I have cooked a bowl of noodles for you

324
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,830
Thanks, Ms. Hu

325
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,760
Thanks for your kindness

326
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,520
You are welcome

327
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,800
I have worked in the kitchen of Central Judicial Office for decades

328
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,560
It’s the first time for me

329
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,710
To see an officer working so carefully like you

330
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
If all officers were

331
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,470
As careful as you are

332
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,350
The folks will

333
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,710
Have enjoyed a much better life

334
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,680
I must fulfill my responsibility

335
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,520
The lives of folks are also lives

336
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,190
I cannot

337
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,950
Allow any groundless death to happen

338
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,950
Yes

339
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,160
You’re correct

340
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,350
It’s going to rain

341
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,760
I have to collect the clothes right now

342
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,680
Sir, enjoy your noodles

343
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,230
All right

344
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,950
It’s going to rain again

345
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,350
It’s you again

346
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,470
It seems that

347
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,160
We’re predestined

348
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,760
A bad destiny

349
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,920
It is also destiny anyway

350
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,470
Why did you follow Li Luoyu

351
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,070
Why did you come here

352
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,160
I have just heard that

353
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,190
Li Luoyu will dance at the mansion of Lord of Yan State

354
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,190
Instead of Yun Piaopiao

355
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,710
So you doubt that the death of people of Yungefang

356
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,800
Has something to do with her

357
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,400
If not, why did you come

358
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,470
She was lying

359
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,430
Saying that she did not know He Ziwen

360
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,560
They must have colluded

361
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,920
Hey

362
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,230
Don’t cause much disturbance

363
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,190
Scream

364
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:30,920
Not my fault

365
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,400
Not my fault

366
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,400
Really not my fault

367
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,470
Yaohuan

368
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,590
Yaohuan

369
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,310
A pity

370
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,070
Half of the bet had gone

371
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,880
This is the only thing passed down by my father

372
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,110
Let me try

373
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,350
Whether I can fix it

374
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,350
Li Luoyu

375
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,160
Why on earth did you want to kill He Ziwen

376
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,160
And other people of Yungefang

377
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,470
They were not killed by me

378
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,040
Tell the truth

379
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:57,920
He was not killed by me

380
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,070
Really

381
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,520
What did you do at the Shrine of Remembrance

382
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,800
How was He Ziwen

383
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,950
killed

384
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,950
He had committed suicide

385
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,280
Earlier

386
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,470
He Ziwen had a letter sent to me

387
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,110
Asking me to find him at the Shrine of Remembrance at dusk

388
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,760
So I went there alone

389
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:16,950
He saw me

390
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,830
Asking me not to perform the dance of Flying Fairy

391
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,070
Otherwise I would be killed by Flying Apsaras

392
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,280
Like Yun Piaopiao and Qiuniang

393
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,760
And then

394
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,350
And then he seemed to go crazy

395
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,190
Picking up a knife

396
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,430
Stab it into his own chest

397
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,830
Do you think we will believe what you said

398
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,710
What I said is true

399
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,560
I had asked you

400
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,830
Whether you know He Ziwen

401
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,640
Why did you lied to me at that time

402
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,710
Because He Ziwen was bothering me all the time

403
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,190
I cannot get rid of him however I tried

404
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,560
So

405
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,070
I did not want any connection with him

406
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,470
But why you went to see him

407
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,160
That was because

408
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,760
He said he knew how Qiuniang was killed

409
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,350
So you believed

410
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,350
The death of people like Yun Piaopiao

411
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,470
Was caused

412
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,520
By the dance of Flying Fairy

413
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,000
Which caused an insult to the Flying Apsaras

414
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,710
So they were punished

415
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,830
But why dared you agree to

416
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,710
Perform the dance at the mansion of Lord of Yan State

417
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,040
Aren’t you

418
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,310
Afraid of death

419
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,590
Among the five vicious qualities specified in Buddhism

420
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,350
Greed comes first

421
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,560
Their lives were claimed by Flying Apsaras

422
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,880
Because of their greed

423
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,190
I am not afraid

424
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,190
Because the dance of Flying Fairy originally belonged to me

425
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,950
It took me half a year to

426
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,640
Design the dance

427
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,430
With the dance I wished to establish my reputation

428
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,070
Unexpectedly it was snatched by Diao Sanye

429
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,350
And offered to Yun Piaopiao

430
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,640
Why did Diao Sanye

431
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,520
Do so

432
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,880
Because Yun Piaopiao was his illegitimate daughter

433
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,160
With a prostitute

434
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,590
Which was known to all people in Yungefang

435
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,830
Sir, if you did not trust my words

436
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,430
You can ask anyone

437
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,520
Did Qiuniang know about it

438
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,400
Yes

439
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,830
But she didn’t mind

440
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,880
Because she only cared about money

441
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,070
All people in Yungefang are

442
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,830
No more than a tool to earn money for her

443
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,590
Be me

444
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,520
Or Yun Piaopiao

445
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,230
She would not mind as long as we could earn money

446
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,520
Not long ago

447
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,160
I made a request of redeeming myself to her

448
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,800
Some days later

449
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,830
Yun Piaopiao snatched the dance of Flying Fairy from me

450
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,430
Would you believe that

451
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,070
Qiuniang was not in collusion with Diao Sanye

452
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,310
I am clear that

453
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,310
Qiuniang realized that I would not stay

454
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,310
So she wanted to make Yun Piaopiao popular as soon as possible

455
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,430
So that she could earn money for her in place of me

456
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,400
Do you know the man in black

457
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,560
That had attacked you

458
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,680
No

459
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,760
Think about it

460
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,760
The man wants to kill you

461
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,880
I don’t know him

462
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,430
You are still so stubborn

463
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,830
You have to undergo a rough time

464
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,160
Otherwise you won’t tell the truth

465
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,000
Di Renjie

466
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,400
Have you really fallen in love with her

467
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,280
Miss Xie

468
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,000
In handling a case

469
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,950
I depend on evidence

470
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,470
Rather than torture

471
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:56,950
Where are you going

472
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,800
I will hunt for the evidence

473
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,520
Do you know the man in black

474
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,830
That had attacked you

475
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,560
No

476
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,920
Miss Xie

477
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,880
Where’s that guy

478
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,190
That guy has escaped

479
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,070
Luckily

480
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,000
He only used an ordinary overpowering drug

481
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,590
otherwise

482
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,880
The consequence will be worse

483
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,520
than a sleep of hours

484
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,230
I have owed you another favor

485
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,350
A second one

486
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,830
Do you keep a clear account with everyone

487
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,950
With you only

488
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,560
All right

489
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:46,760
Let’s go

490
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,000
Now you have awakened

491
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,070
Get down to business

492
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,710
You should have not come here

493
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,800
You should have not come here

494
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:30,800
Go

495
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,920
Let’s leave here first

496
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,430
Unnecessary

497
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,920
We know each other

498
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,190
Today

499
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,310
However you try

500
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,520
You cannot escape from here

501
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,920
So give up struggle

502
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,950
Meng Shaobai

503
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,680
How do you know it’s me

504
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,110
On the day when Qiuniang died

505
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,870
Did you remember what Li Luoyu

506
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,949
Addressed you

507
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,560
Goodbye, Mr. Meng

508
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,710
Li Luoyu is not a staffer of the Central Judicial Office

509
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,429
You’ve never been to Yungefang

510
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,469
How did she know your surname

511
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,150
For this reason

512
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,710
At that time I felt that

513
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,670
You should have known each other before

514
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
But

515
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,230
You tried to hide that deliberately

516
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,870
Afterward

517
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,630
When interrogating Li Luoyu

518
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,389
She touched her bracelet unconsciously all the time

519
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,150
When one is nervous

520
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,429
Usually he will try to find

521
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,280
Some reliance

522
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,360
So

523
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,320
I guess

524
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,040
The bracelet must be from

525
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,150
A person whom she

526
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,520
Trusts and relies on most

527
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,190
What can be used to carry our love

528
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,600
Only the pair of bracelets on my hands

529
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,630
Correct

530
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,470
This bracelet is really a token of love from me

531
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,230
That’s why you have transferred all guards today

532
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,150
Waiting for me to fall into your net

533
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,760
You are a smart guy

534
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,760
But you cannot

535
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,710
Avoid the chaos when you are concerned

536
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,430
Why did you kill Yun Piaopiao and other people

537
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,870
Senior officers

538
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,150
They were killed by me alone

539
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,560
Shaobai simply wanted to rescue me

540
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,670
I beg you to let him go

541
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,710
Luoyu

542
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,000
This has nothing to do with her

543
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,430
I had killed them all

544
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,190
I admit my guilt

545
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,190
Shaobai

546
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,840
Don’t you think you can bluff it out

547
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,630
You are a pair of accomplice

548
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,840
Both of you are guilty

549
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,430
Di Renjie

550
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,800
Though we have got acquainted for a short time

551
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,430
I know you will tell black from white

552
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,950
Indeed

553
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,710
Luoyu had resentment towards the four victims

554
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,360
But we had agreed that

555
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,390
After saving enough money, I would redeem her

556
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,040
And we will go away to another place

557
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,390
All the past will be forgotten like fleeting cloud

558
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,760
It’s not necessary for her to

559
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,600
Kill them at this critical moment

560
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,560
Was the man in black

561
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,430
That attacked us at the Shrine of Remembrance

562
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,360
you

563
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,710
Correct

564
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,190
It was me

565
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,230
Was the man to

566
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,760
Kill Miss Xie in the woods

567
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,910
You too

568
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,870
No

569
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,950
After you arrested Luoyu into the jail

570
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,950
I was thinking of how to rescue her

571
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,950
I had not any intention to kill Miss Xie

572
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,910
Of what you have said

573
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,870
What is true

574
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,360
What is false

575
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,840
I will figure it out naturally

576
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,870
But for now

577
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,320
You have to be put under custody together

578
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
If you trust me

579
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,840
You should wait until I find out the truth

580
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,560
Before that do not act rashly

581
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:34,910
Okay

582
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,280
You’ve made a progress

583
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,870
This time you have not pulled out your sword at once

584
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,150
Do you believe that they are the culprit

585
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,000
You really have progressed

586
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,190
Now you have used your brain

587
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,430
I am not as smart as you

588
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,430
Neither am I as good at settling cases as you

589
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,150
But I am also clear that

590
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,760
They confessed guilt

591
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,630
Simply to protect each other

592
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,280
Besides, the man in black I fought with in the woods

593
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,360
Seemed to be a different guy from the one

594
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,390
We met at the Shrine of Remembrance that night

595
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,320
There are still many puzzles to solve in this case

596
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,710
What’s your plan

597
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,190
If we have reached the end of a path

598
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,870
We may

599
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,000
Return to the start

600
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,150
And take the path all over again

601
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,600
The start you said

602
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,120
Refers to these bodies

603
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,430
You’re doubting that Meng Shaobai had played a trick

604
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,230
At the time of autopsy

605
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,190
Do you still remember the hidden weapon

606
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,120
Used by the man in black in the woods

607
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,190
I am wondering

608
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,360
If the needle

609
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,870
Were shot into human body

610
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,840
Will it

611
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,120
Vanish instantly too

612
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,870
If the man in black is the culprit

613
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,520
The needle must be the weapon

614
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,870
No wonder we cannot find other traces

615
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,320
In these bodies

616
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,320
Got it

617
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,430
But this is not life-gate

618
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,190
With this small needle

619
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,190
It seems unable to claim a life

620
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,630
I remember the entire needle is blood-red

621
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,710
Will it be stained with poison

622
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,430
Like the past

623
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,120
There is no trace of getting poisoned

624
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,430
Would Meng Shaobai

625
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,800
Have played a trick on the corpses

626
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,630
Trick

627
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,360
Have played a trick on the corpses

628
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,630
Weird

629
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,120
Look at the four bodies

630
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,190
The body of Diao Sanye

631
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,040
Has been placed here for nearly a month

632
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,150
It remains not different from that of He Ziwen

633
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,430
Now

634
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,670
It’s hot summer

635
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,390
Even if cooled with ices

636
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,230
It would have been impossible

637
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,950
For the bodies to remain

638
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,630
unrotten for so long

639
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,670
Look out

640
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,760
Got it

641
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,230
This kind of poison is known as Smiling with a Flower

642
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,710
Whoever is poisoned

643
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,120
His body will remain lifelike and unrotten for months

644
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,320
If I could not accompany

645
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,520
You in the future

646
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,390
Promise me

647
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:56,950
You will live on well

648
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,190
Don’t worry

649
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,190
I will protect you

650
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,630
Mr. Di

651
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,190
I have found out the real cause of death of the four victims

652
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,190
Have you heard of a poison

653
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,430
Called Smiling with a Flower

654
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,230
So

655
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,230
You’re doubting that I have applied the poison

656
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,470
Have you applied it

657
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,840
No

658
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,280
Nor Luoyu

659
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,390
I also wish so

660
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,390
There are limited medical records about the drug

661
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,390
I cannot find out who has applied the drug

662
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,080
Therefore

663
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,190
I will go to Five Poison Valley with Miss Xie

664
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,710
To learn from the poison expert there

665
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,080
Wait until I come back

666
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,280
If I can prove that you and Miss Li are innocent

667
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,520
At that time

668
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,230
I will pick you in person

669
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,360
Out of the jail

670
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,360
All right

671
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,950
I will wait for you

672
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,630
Hey

673
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,630
Are you satisfied with it

674
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,840
So you call me here, simply to give it to me

675
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,600
To be honest

676
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,320
It has taken a lot of my effort

677
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,630
Luckily it was fixed on time

678
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,190
In this trip to the Five Poison Valley

679
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,760
You must have a weapon in your hand

680
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,470
Fire

681
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,600
Fire

682
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,670
Quickly, this way

683
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,840
Hurry up

684
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,910
Water, water

685
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,230
Quickly

686
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,320
Have you had meal

687
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,760
Sir

688
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,950
Except for Meng Shaobai and Li Luoyu

689
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,080
All people have been rescued

690
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,230
What are you going to do

691
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,120
I will go in with you

692
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,430
No, you must stay here

693
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,280
I also want to enter

694
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,120
No, it’s an order

695
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,000
What if something wrong happens to you

696
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,150
Di Renjie

697
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,710
Take care

698
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,360
Xiao Bai

699
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,670
Hurry up

700
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,040
Go

701
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,040
Rescue Luoyu

702
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,470
Let me carry her on my back

703
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,710
Go

704
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,080
Xiao Bai

705
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,630
be careful

706
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,040
Go, rescue Luoyu

707
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,600
Xiao Bai

708
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:55,470
Shao Bai

709
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,600
Go

710
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,280
Go

711
00:42:59,430 --> 00:42:59,910
Go

712
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,950
Are you okay

713
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,000
I am fine

714
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,150
Xiao Bai is still inside

715
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,320
Xiao Bai

716
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:45,560
Xiao Bai

717
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,470
Xiao Bai

718
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,560
Sir

719
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,670
A charred corpse was discovered in the lobby

720
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,950
It should be Meng Shaobai

721
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,630
Shaobai

722
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,190
Shaobai

723
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,230
Shaobai

724
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,670
Shaobai

725
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,470
Shaobai

726
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,080
Shaobai

727
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,710
Sorry

728
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,040
I should have trusted you

729
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,950
But trust me

730
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,000
I will surely find out the culprit

731
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:17,910
To revenge you

732
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,320
Cut it

733
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,430
Don’t simply watch

734
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,840
Are you okay

735
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,560
Fine

736
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:21,870
Kill the leader

737
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:11,950
It’s dead

738
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,000
Who are you

739
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,280
Master

740
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,520
Master

741
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,040
Master

742
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,630
Master

743
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,120
Master

744
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:21,760
Who are you

745
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,950
Why did you kill my master

746
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,150
Brother

747
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,120
You have misunderstood us

748
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,910
We come here to see the poison expert

749
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,710
But unexpectedly

750
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,000
As we entered, we saw the elder lying on the floor

751
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,560
I know

752
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,470
You must come here to revenge on my master

753
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,280
Is he the poison expert

754
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,840
Whoever you are

755
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,950
Today you have entered the Valley and entered my master

756
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,800
You will not leave here alive

757
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,040
You’ve really misunderstood us

758
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,000
Listen to me

759
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,040
Listen, I have not killed your master

760
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,150
Cut the crap

761
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,040
Are you fine

762
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:41,950
Go

763
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,560
Block the door

764
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,710
Gold

765
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:01,840
Wood

766
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:02,710
Water

767
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:04,950
Fire

768
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,390
Earth

769
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,040
This is an array of five elements

770
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,040
Metal restricts wood

771
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,150
Water flows in the opposite direction

772
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,230
Water restricts

773
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,670
Fire promotes earth

774
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,760
Earth promotes gold

775
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:18,560
The three elements restrict each other

776
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:20,760
Those three elements promote each other

777
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,080
The earth position at the middle

778
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,470
Should be the gate of death

779
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,950
I cannot find the switch

780
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,870
Look

781
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,630
Which direction it is gazing at

782
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:58,670
The bed

783
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,520
Dare to have a bet with me

784
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,430
Are you fine

785
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,280
Don’t worry, I won’t die

786
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,520
Poison House

787
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,230
It was said that

788
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,470
Poison House is where

789
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,560
The classics of poisons was collected

790
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,190
And where he was refining poison

791
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,040
I’ve not expected

792
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,600
That it is in this place

793
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:47,560
How did you know

794
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,840
The switch was installed in the bed

795
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,470
That room and this place

796
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,760
Are arranged following the Trigram of five elements

797
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,000
As long as we followed the direction of eight gates

798
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:59,870
We would naturally find

799
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,040
The position of the gate of life

800
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:03,870
Come here

801
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,120
Sit down

802
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,470
This is the Poison Valley

803
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,120
There must be some antidote to the snake poison

804
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,080
Wait for me

805
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,280
I will search for the antidote

806
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,120
Got it

807
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:07,840
Search for them

808
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:08,710
Yes

809
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,600
When you were in coma, I found this

810
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,870
Record of the poison Smiling with a Flower

811
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,390
Smiling with a Flower

812
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,950
Is a powerful poison passed down by Guanzhong Cangmen

813
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:23,710
From generation to generation without being disclosed

814
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,190
But the clan of Cangmen were wiped out

815
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,600
By their foes overnight twenty years ago

816
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:30,630
None of the clan had survived

817
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,320
From then on

818
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,840
The poison had disappeared

819
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,950
That’s to say

820
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,120
The clue is broken again

821
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:39,870
We have made so much effort

822
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,630
And risked our life

823
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,870
But we got nothing in the end

824
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,600
Not necessarily so

825
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,360
Mr. Di

826
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,080
She deserves the title of No. 1 dancing girl in the capital

827
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,230
She is unrivalled by

828
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,600
Yun Piaopiao

829
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,710
I remember Xiao Kui said

830
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,280
Though Yun Piao had snatched the dance of Flying Fairy

831
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:33,670
But she could not

832
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:34,600
Perform many of the movements

833
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:35,840
Look

834
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,360
This movement

835
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,430
Yun Piaopiao could not perform it at all

836
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,280
What do you want to express

837
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,520
Greeting to two officers

838
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,360
We have just come back from the Poison Valley

839
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,670
And come to see you by the way

840
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,320
Have you found out anything

841
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,120
We have found

842
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,080
The poison expert had died

843
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,430
We were almost taken as

844
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,230
The culprit

845
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,760
Luckily his disciple

846
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,040
Trusted the sign of Central Justice Office

847
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,150
I promised to find out the culprit for them

848
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,320
So they agreed to let us go

849
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,840
It’s a pity

850
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,520
That we have not got any useful information

851
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,710
Miss Li

852
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,230
Do you really want to go to perform at the mansion of Lord of Yan State

853
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,760
I know what you’re worried about

854
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,080
But I am convinced that I will be lucky

855
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,080
Besides

856
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,000
Hundreds of employees of Yungefang

857
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Have to earn their living

858
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,470
I must go

859
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,230
Don’t worry

860
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,630
I’ve promised Xiao Bai

861
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,000
To protect your safety

862
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,390
Thank you, Mr. Di

863
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,710
Your performance just now

864
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,430
Is really amazing

865
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,360
The movement of Flying Fairy picking star

866
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,840
Cannot be accomplished without

867
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,150
A foundation of decades

868
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,560
Mr. Di, you have flattered me

869
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,430
My performance is simply some insignificant skill

870
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,600
It’s not worth mentioning

871
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:58,870
All right

872
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,710
I have still some business to handle

873
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:01,870
We have to go now

874
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:03,040
Goodbye, sir

875
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,390
Flying Apsaras has show her presence

876
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,520
And will claim lives again

877
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,910
Flying Apsaras has shown her presence

878
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,950
And will claim lives again

879
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,360
Diao Sanye

880
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,800
Has been drowned to death, do you still remember it

881
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,760
Yes, yes

882
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,840
Plus him, this is already the fourth victim

883
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,520
It’s said that

884
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,710
The Flying Apsaras

885
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:00,040
After killing four victims in succession

886
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,630
Showed her presence again last night

887
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:07,390
You guess

888
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,950
This time

889
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:10,870
I think, she is nothing weird

890
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,840
Perhaps we have guessed it wrong

891
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,910
Because she appeared nothing weird

892
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,710
That is more weird

893
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,040
How is my work compared with yours

894
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,040
You are really smart

895
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,120
You’ve deceived everyone with only a cloaking trick

896
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:53,630
It’s a pity that

897
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:55,760
The flaw has spot by me

898
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,800
The so-called presence of Flying Apsaras

899
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,000
is simply a painting of Flying Apsaras

900
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,630
Outlined on the wall in advance

901
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,760
And then covered with honey

902
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,430
When it’s needed

903
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:06,710
You simply put ants

904
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:07,870
Onto the honey

905
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,600
After the honey is eaten up by the ants

906
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,560
The painting of Flying Apsaras will

907
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,670
Appear instantly

908
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:15,150
And you

909
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,630
Have mixed chronic poison in the hone

910
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,710
After the antis eat up the honey

911
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:20,800
They will die

912
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:22,390
In fact

913
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,040
This is just a small trick

914
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,230
Simply taking advantage of the fear of people

915
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,000
So the trick has not been revealed all the time

916
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,000
Today

917
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:33,320
I create my work

918
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:34,840
In the same way

919
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,000
Are you satisfied with it

920
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,430
Miss Li

921
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:45,080
It’s really you

922
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,470
I should have known that this is a pitfall

923
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,360
But I

924
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,630
It’s simply because

925
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:51,670
You are too confide

926
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,670
You don’t believe that

927
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,470
Your trick will be revealed

928
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,630
So

929
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,040
Upon hearing that the Flying Apsaras made her presence felt again

930
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,150
You will surely come and look

931
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,190
I should have killed you

932
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,190
Who are you

933
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,560
Now that you have known me

934
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,600
Why ask me this question

935
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,710
Twenty years ago

936
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,120
When the clan of Cangmen was wiped out

937
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,710
Where were you

938
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:33,190
That night Cangmen was in flames

939
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,040
Screams were echoing in the air

940
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,630
Cangmen people tried to fight against the foes

941
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,520
But they failed

942
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,230
I was heavily injured and fainted out

943
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,390
So I survived the disaster

944
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,390
When I awoke

945
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,040
Cangmen had been wiped out

946
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,280
You used this to

947
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,360
Kill Yun Piaopiao and other victims

948
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,870
Greed is terrible

949
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,800
I have worked hard for Yungefang for so many years

950
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,710
Qiuniang had acted in collusion with Yun Piaopiao and Diao Sanye

951
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:58,760
To snatch my dance

952
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,120
Didn’t they deserve death

953
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,710
But now that you decided to leave Yungefang

954
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,630
Why did you have to bother yourself about it

955
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,360
Redeeming myself

956
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,320
Why had I not left all the time

957
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,190
After Qiuniang heard about my idea of redeeming mysel

958
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:12,080
She gave a high price of one thousand taels

959
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,710
The saving of me and Shaobai was far from enou

960
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:17,150
So she let Yun Piaopiao snatch my dance

961
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,230
So that I would never be able to

962
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:20,950
Redeem myself

963
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,600
Now that they could not fulfill my request

964
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,000
I would not forgive them

965
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,230
If greedy guys like them

966
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,430
Were not eliminated by the heaven

967
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,760
Then I would enforce justice on behalf of the Heaven

968
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,520
Diao Sanye was mean

969
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,320
Who kept bullying dancing girls in daily time

970
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,150
With an excuse of training

971
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,230
He had stolen my dance

972
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,000
So I killed him firs

973
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,080
Yun Piaopiao

974
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,670
Was frivolous and fished for fame and gains

975
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:55,120
She liked the dance of Flying Fairy so muc

976
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,190
So I fulfilled her dream

977
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,910
And let her die at her most beautiful moment

978
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,600
Qiuniang should have not died

979
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,000
But she would rather offend Lord of Yan State

980
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,190
Than let me dance in place of Yun Piaopiao

981
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,120
Considering our affection for so many years

982
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,910
I offered her a decent death

983
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,670
How about He Ziwen

984
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:20,080
Why did you kill him

985
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:21,230
Because

986
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:22,190
He was also

987
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:24,560
Part of the trap of Flying Apsaras claiming lives

988
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,120
He Ziwen was simply an idiot

989
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:28,910
Who knew nothing except for painting

990
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,230
As I seduced him a bit

991
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,870
He was willing to sacrifice himself for me

992
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,630
You had taught him to

993
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,120
Create a false scene of Flying Apsaras making her presence felt

994
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,760
Everything was originally fine

995
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,870
It’s a pity that he was as greedy as

996
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,710
Other people

997
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,280
He said he wanted to marry me

998
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,360
And with it as a threa

999
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,190
I had no option but kill him to clear the evidence

1000
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,520
How about Meng Shaobai

1001
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:54,870
You really love him

1002
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,080
But why did you kill him too

1003
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,950
It was an accident

1004
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,950
That day I heard your dialogue with Shaobai

1005
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,360
Knowing that you had found out Smiling with a Flower

1006
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,950
A long delay may cause much trouble

1007
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:09,670
So I set the jail on fire

1008
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,150
To make you believe that

1009
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,710
The culprit was to kill us as scapegoat

1010
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:16,760
But I had not expected

1011
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,670
Shaobai

1012
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,560
If Shaobai were still alive

1013
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:28,470
And knew that you are so cruel

1014
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:30,150
He must

1015
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,470
Be very sad

1016
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,120
He had fallen in love with a wrong person

1017
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,190
Mr. Di

1018
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,840
I know that I am sinful

1019
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,950
I have nothing to care about in this world

1020
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,800
But Shaobai

1021
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,320
Would you please tell Shaobai

1022
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,630
If there were an afterlife

1023
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,000
I would meet him innocently

1024
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,040
Li Luoyu

1025
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:01,470
Li Luoyu

1026
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:34,520
Xiao Bai

1027
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,000
Do you think that you’ve loved a wrong girl

1028
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,080
Mr. Di

1029
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,910
Mr. Jiang said

1030
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,430
Now that the case of Yungefang had been settled

1031
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,230
He asked us to return the bodies

1032
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,670
Who tell you that the case has been settled

1033
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:05,470
You can go now

1034
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,430
I will explain it to Mr. Jiang

1035
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,230
Mr. Jiang asked us to wrap up and bury

1036
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:11,520
The body that was drowned in a lake

1037
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:32,710
Sir

1038
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,190
The body of the man who was drowned cannot be found

1039
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:37,430
Do you know where it is

1040
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,230
No

1041
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,910
Why is the body missing

1042
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,320
When have you seen the body

1043
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,040
recently

1044
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:56,320
It seems

1045
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,560
On the day when the jail was on fire

1046
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,760
We have not paid attention to the bodies since then

1047
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:06,320
Li Luoyu

1048
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,080
I know who you are protecting

1049
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:15,910
Shaobai

1050
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,080
If Li Luoyu really love you

1051
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,670
How would she allow your tomb to

1052
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,280
Be filled with weeds

1053
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:25,910
What

1054
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,710
They were killed by the poison Smiling with a Flower

1055
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,000
Dad, you’ve also heard of the poison

1056
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,630
I heard of it when I was fighting in the expedition

1057
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,190
I disdained those who used poison most

1058
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,800
So I have just heard of it

1059
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,870
The culprit produced poisonous needles with toxic blood and ice

1060
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,390
After the needle entered the body

1061
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:45,670
The ice smelted

1062
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,120
So the coroner had failed to find out

1063
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,670
the scar and trace of getting poisoned

1064
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,280
That is too cruel

1065
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:53,670
By the way

1066
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,910
Has the person that applied the poison really died

1067
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:56,840
yes

1068
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,670
She had committed suicide in front

1069
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,000
Of me and Di Renjie

1070
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:01,230
That’s fine

1071
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:02,950
A cruel person will

1072
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,320
Bring more disasters if remaining alive

1073
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:07,760
Dad

1074
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,120
Can you tell me again

1075
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:12,150
How my dad was killed

1076
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,800
Why do you ask this again

1077
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,230
I was small when my dad passed away

1078
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,360
As to the death of my mother

1079
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,430
My knowledge was also limited

1080
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:23,320
Recently

1081
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,870
I have often dreamed of my father

1082
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:27,320
So I cannot help asking it

1083
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,760
That year your dad went on an expedition with me

1084
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,470
And fell into a trap of the enemy

1085
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,000
In order to save me

1086
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,470
He was killed by an arrow

1087
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:38,910
I remember that when my dad was killed

1088
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,520
The army had won a victory and

1089
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,280
Was ready to come back

1090
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,710
Yes

1091
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:46,150
On the way back

1092
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,630
We fell into a pitfall of the enemy

1093
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,320
I had to be blamed for my pride

1094
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:51,520
Yaohuan

1095
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:54,360
I owed you the life of your father

1096
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,120
Dad, you are too serious

1097
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,080
I am to blame

1098
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,120
For mentioning the past

1099
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,080
I have more work to do at the Imperial Guards

1100
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,390
I have to go now

1101
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,360
Go ahead

1102
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,150
That guy is easy to identify

1103
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,870
On his right hand are six fingers

1104
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:38,430
Indeed

1105
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,230
Miss Xie

1106
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,320
Ms. Hu

1107
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:51,760
When will Di Renjie come back

1108
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,840
I don’t know

1109
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:54,800
Besides

1110
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:55,670
Mr. Di will not tell me

1111
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,320
This when he went out

1112
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:01,630
Girl

1113
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:02,800
Don’t worry

1114
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,670
It has got dark now

1115
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,230
He will come back soon

1116
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:08,910
You don’t know

1117
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,150
Where to find him

1118
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,760
Today I have stewed some chicken soup in the kitchen

1119
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,950
I have served one bowl for you

1120
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:18,710
Drink it when it is hot

1121
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,600
And wait for him slowly

1122
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,080
Enjoy it while it’s hot

1123
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,120
It will taste bad when it gets cold

1124
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:31,390
Thanks, Ms. Hu

1125
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:32,710
You are welcome

1126
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:55,950
Miss Xie went out in the morning

1127
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,150
And has not come back

1128
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:58,950
After she came back

1129
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,230
Would you tell her

1130
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,390
Di Renjie had come to her for some urgent issue

1131
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:05,870
Yaohuan is not in the Imperial Guards

1132
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,600
Nor in the mansion of Lord of Yan State

1133
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:09,560
She may have gone to my place

1134
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,600
Mr. Di

1135
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:18,720
Sir

1136
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:19,950
It’s late at night

1137
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,350
I have boiled a cup of ginseng tea

1138
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,080
After finishing it

1139
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:22,750
Go to bed early

1140
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,430
All right, thanks, Ms. Hu

1141
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:25,350
You’re welcome

1142
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,120
Drink it while it is hot

1143
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,080
By the way, Ms. Hu

1144
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,240
Has Miss Xie come here today

1145
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,270
I’ve been in the kitchen all the time

1146
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:49,270
I have not seen her

1147
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,640
Sir, drink it while it is hot, it is good for your stomach

1148
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,200
Di Renjie

1149
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:37,430
However smart you are

1150
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:38,240
In the end

1151
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,270
You have fallen into my hand

1152
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,390
Who are you

1153
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,310
You need not

1154
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:46,870
Know it

1155
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:48,720
But don’t worry

1156
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,200
I will not claim your life

1157
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,120
As long as you stay here

1158
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,430
Quietly for some days

1159
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,080
I will let you go

1160
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,270
It is not that easy, is it

1161
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,350
Will you let me go easily if

1162
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:06,560
I unveil your plot of Flying Apsaras

1163
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,200
I have misjudged your ability

1164
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,790
If I did not guess it wrong

1165
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:15,200
You should have been the person with an attempt to kill Miss Xie in the woods

1166
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,790
Those who had survived

1167
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,520
The disaster of Cangmen twenty years ago

1168
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:21,350
And Yun Piaopiao

1169
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,520
All victims were killed by you with poison

1170
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,640
Li Luoyu

1171
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,750
Was only a scapegoat of you

1172
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:29,790
It appears

1173
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:30,720
That I must kill you

1174
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,200
Why are you

1175
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:41,350
Still supporting you at this moment

1176
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,000
I have made the right friend

1177
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,600
Xiao Bai

1178
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,910
We have not seen each other for a long time

1179
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:51,950
I have known that I cannot conceal it from you

1180
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,750
At that time when you was engulfed in flames

1181
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:57,560
Li Luoyu was sorrowful

1182
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,600
Her sorrow at that time was real

1183
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,470
But days later

1184
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,160
When I saw her again

1185
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:04,680
She tried to suppress her tears

1186
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,350
But

1187
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:07,830
In her eyes

1188
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,790
There was no sorrow of losing a beloved

1189
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,310
She loves you so deeply

1190
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,640
She will not pay a blind eye to

1191
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,790
The weeds

1192
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:15,870
That grew at your tomb

1193
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:18,310
Not until a corpse

1194
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,600
Was missing at the morgue

1195
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,120
Had I realize

1196
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,720
That some fraud had been practiced

1197
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,680
The various behaviors of Luoyu

1198
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:26,910
All indicate that

1199
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,120
She was clear that you had not died

1200
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,870
I had not expected you to investigate Luoyu

1201
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,200
Nor had I expected that

1202
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:36,200
You would find out the death of Yun Piaopiao and other victims

1203
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:37,600
The flame

1204
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:39,750
Was set to clear the charges against me and Luoyu

1205
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,470
But I had not expected you

1206
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:43,910
To rush into the fire to rescue me

1207
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:45,200
That’s because

1208
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:47,680
I have really treated you as my brother

1209
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,640
So I will not kill you

1210
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:53,600
But you will not be allowed to spoil our plan

1211
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:56,750
What on earth you want to do

1212
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:57,430
Shaobai

1213
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,080
Save nonsense to him

1214
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,430
This guy

1215
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,270
Must be killed today

1216
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:03,720
Mother

1217
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:04,750
I beg you

1218
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,560
We have killed enough people

1219
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,270
Let’s spare him

1220
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:10,950
Shaobai, go away

1221
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,750
Mother

1222
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:32,910
Impossible

1223
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:34,600
I have added

1224
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:35,720
Some powder into the tea

1225
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,000
I have not

1226
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:38,040
Drunk the tea

1227
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,470
You said you had not seen Miss Xie

1228
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,520
But there was her fragrance in your sleeve

1229
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,120
You appeared old

1230
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:46,640
But your fingers are still tender

1231
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:47,720
Your skin is as glossy as cream

1232
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,600
You are much younger than your age

1233
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,430
So I pretended to drink the tea

1234
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:54,470
Simply to see what was your plot

1235
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,270
All right

1236
01:12:58,750 --> 01:12:59,830
You are really Di Renjie

1237
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:01,200
No wonder

1238
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,430
My son Shaobai

1239
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,000
Is trying to protect you

1240
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:22,750
Smiling with a Flower

1241
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:24,120
Is indeed a magical poison in the world

1242
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,470
Which can keep one young forever

1243
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,600
So what

1244
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:29,390
Even if time has left no trace

1245
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:31,790
My heart has been scarred and battered

1246
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:33,870
What’s to blame is that you are too smart

1247
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:43,830
You are not my rival

1248
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:45,350
Follow me back to the Central Judicial Office

1249
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,520
Commit no more mistakes

1250
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:47,160
Impossible

1251
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,950
What are waiting

1252
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:55,640
Do you want to see me killed by him

1253
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,080
Mother

1254
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:35,680
Di Renjie

1255
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:38,040
If you fight anymore

1256
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,430
I will kill her

1257
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,000
Mother

1258
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,950
I beg you not to kill any more people

1259
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,720
After we finish our revenge tomorrow

1260
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:53,720
We will escape to another place

1261
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,950
They are helpless with us

1262
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,790
Many victims have been killed

1263
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:57,870
So what

1264
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,160
When 107 people of Cangmen were killed

1265
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,790
Why no one had come to save us

1266
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,350
But they are innocent

1267
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,430
If you really want to kill more people

1268
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,350
You can kill me too

1269
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,000
I have died once

1270
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:14,470
You

1271
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:19,640
Guard them

1272
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:46,790
Xiao Bai

1273
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,310
You are holding the candle to the devil

1274
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,200
Think about Miss Li

1275
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,200
She had died as a scapegoat of your mother

1276
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,120
If you had not kept investigating the case

1277
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,040
How could she be involved

1278
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,310
It is my duty

1279
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,640
To investigate cases and find out the culprit

1280
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,520
You should be clear of

1281
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,640
This point

1282
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,200
Xiao Bai

1283
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:09,520
However great

1284
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,520
The hatred

1285
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,430
And grievance you and your mother are suffering

1286
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:14,080
You should have not harmed innocent people

1287
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:15,950
Innocent

1288
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,390
But in this world

1289
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,600
Who is really innocent

1290
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:25,830
When the whole family of my mother was killed

1291
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,470
When she witnessed her parents and families

1292
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:29,560
killed in front of her

1293
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,430
Luoyu suffered all kinds of humiliation at Yungefang

1294
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:33,910
Aren’t they innocent

1295
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,200
But she has not intended to kill them

1296
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,520
It’s all because of you

1297
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:38,600
Xiao Bai

1298
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,350
What on earth do you and your mother want to do

1299
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,310
Are you going to assassinate Lord of Yan State

1300
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,310
How do you know

1301
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,600
Twenty years ago, the clan of Cangmen was wiped out

1302
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:54,640
The head was called Xie Ling

1303
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,520
He

1304
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,790
He was my father

1305
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:01,240
I have concealed it from you all the time

1306
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,470
At the Poison House

1307
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,870
Other than the classics of poison

1308
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:07,560
I also discovered the truth behind

1309
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,750
The Cangmen disaster twenty years ago

1310
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:12,640
At that time Lord of Yan State was only a general

1311
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,350
My dad was his bosom friend

1312
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,430
My dad should have wiped out Cangmen

1313
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:20,470
Under an order from Lord of Yan State

1314
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:24,270
That brute

1315
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:25,470
Meng Shaobai

1316
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:28,270
If your mother really wants to kill Lord of Yan State

1317
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,040
You must stop her

1318
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,790
I have been around Lord of Yan State for many years

1319
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:34,390
Your mother is not a rival of him

1320
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,160
My mother has waited for this day for twenty years

1321
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,600
However powerful he is

1322
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:42,120
He will not escape his doom this time

1323
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:49,790
Come on

1324
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:51,470
Hang the plaque

1325
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,720
Love live our great majesty

1326
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,520
All of you remain outside the Shrine of Remembrance

1327
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:03,240
I will pay respect here

1328
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,470
To pray for the emperor

1329
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:05,430
None of you are allowed to disturb me

1330
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,160
Yes

1331
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,870
Wen Zhi’an

1332
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,000
Do you remember me

1333
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,680
Who are you

1334
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,270
Twenty years have passed

1335
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,600
You have not recognized my voice now

1336
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,950
No, impossible

1337
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,750
It’s impossible that you are still alive

1338
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:04,680
Indeed I should have not been alive to date

1339
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,000
On the night twenty years ago

1340
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:08,520
I should have died

1341
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:10,720
In the hand of my husband

1342
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:13,680
You want to revenge

1343
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,430
Come

1344
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:17,470
As the lord of a state

1345
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,790
With glorious meritorious military services

1346
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:21,000
I have killed numerous people on the battlefield

1347
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,830
Not to say the hundreds of lives of Cangmen

1348
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,270
Even all souls who had been killed by me

1349
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,270
came to me today

1350
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,790
I will not be scared

1351
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:32,720
That year for marrying the princess and promotion to a higher position

1352
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,640
You were cruel enough to send some soldiers to kill your wife and son

1353
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:37,680
You must have not expected

1354
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,270
That one day you will receive revenge

1355
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:39,950
What’s my fault

1356
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,040
Everyone lives for himself

1357
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:44,080
Why didn’t you refuse to leave my home

1358
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:45,640
You had forced me

1359
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Twenty years have passed

1360
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,790
Father and mother

1361
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,000
Now I can finally revenge you

1362
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,680
You want to harm me with this small trick

1363
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,270
You’ve deceived me

1364
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:20,430
Smiling with a Flower of Cangmen had appeared in Chang’an

1365
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:22,910
Did you think that I would not take any precaution

1366
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:25,470
I asked all soldiers to be away

1367
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:27,830
Simply to induce you

1368
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,830
Twenty years ago

1369
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:31,870
Xie Ling really betrayed me

1370
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:35,040
So you have survived to date

1371
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,390
That’s because he had conscience

1372
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:39,600
Not so cruel as you

1373
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:41,520
For position and wealth

1374
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,470
You had even attempted to kill your wife

1375
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:46,240
And your own son

1376
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,310
How can you swallow

1377
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:50,830
the Foods exchanged

1378
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,750
with the blood of your wife and son

1379
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,120
How can you sleep well

1380
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,560
Twenty years you escaped

1381
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,870
You should have muddled along forever

1382
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:00,680
You still want to kill me for revenge

1383
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,270
You are invite death to yourself

1384
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:04,310
Today I will make your wish come true

1385
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,200
Mother

1386
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:17,720
Mother

1387
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,520
What’s wrong with you

1388
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:21,120
What does he call you

1389
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,470
You must have not expected that

1390
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,750
I have not died myself

1391
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:27,830
Our son has also survived

1392
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,080
We have survived to date

1393
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:34,350
To kill you for revenge

1394
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:37,560
The gratitude and resentment between us

1395
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,870
Will be concluded today

1396
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:40,950
Wait

1397
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,790
You have attempted to kill your wife and son

1398
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:48,080
And killed 107 lives of Cangmen

1399
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,240
Today I will arrest you to the Central Justice Office

1400
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:52,520
And punish you according to national laws

1401
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:54,750
As the lord of a state

1402
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,750
How dare you to do so

1403
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,240
A lord will also be punished too if he commits a crime

1404
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:00,720
You are a lord

1405
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,910
And should have obeyed the laws better

1406
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:33,600
Di Renjie

1407
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,270
Are you okay

1408
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:38,720
Dad

1409
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:40,390
It's none of your business

1410
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,350
Step aside

1411
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:42,520
Dad

1412
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:43,720
Yaohuan

1413
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,240
You also want to betray me

1414
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,200
Dad

1415
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,040
Still remember that I have asked you

1416
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,080
How was my dad killed that year

1417
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,160
It's him

1418
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,270
That year your dad wiped out Cangmen under his order

1419
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:59,080
But he was finally kind enough to let us go

1420
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,950
But on the way back to the capita

1421
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,200
Your dad was killed by him to clear the evidence

1422
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,750
Is it real

1423
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,270
So what

1424
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,870
You also want to revenge on me

1425
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:14,790
Dad

1426
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:16,830
You have looked after me for decades

1427
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:18,520
I respect you

1428
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,950
I can even sacrifice my life for you

1429
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:22,200
To my surprise

1430
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,680
The man whom I have been loyal to for so many years

1431
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,350
Turns out to be the man who had killed my father

1432
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,310
I have known that

1433
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,160
You will be a traitor ultimately

1434
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:44,950
You want to revenge on me

1435
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:46,560
All right

1436
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,080
All of you come together

1437
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:52,040
Anyway today

1438
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,040
None of you can escape from here alive

1439
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:29,640
Xiao Bai

1440
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:36,520
Mother

1441
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:46,830
Mother

1442
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,390
Mother

1443
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:09,240

01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:11,830
Mother

1445
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:14,560
Yaohuan

1446
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:26,160
Xiao Bai

1447
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,240
It’s your mom

1448
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:30,750
I am sorry

1449
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:33,720
I should have not

1450
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,000
Ruined your life with hatred

1451
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,080
Promise me

1452
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:42,600
From today on

1453
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:45,310
Only do what you want to do

1454
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:53,870
Di Renjie

1455
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,640
All people were killed by me

1456
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,240
Xiao Bai

1457
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,350
Has not killed anybody

1458
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:06,270
I beg you

1459
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,270
Beg you

1460
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,350
Don't worry, madame

1461
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,120
I will handle it impartially

1462
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:15,750
Mother

1463
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:16,830
Mother

1464
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,750
Xiao Bai

1465
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:21,790
Xiao Bai

1466
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:29,870
Mother

1467
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,600
Mother

1468
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:44,390
Yaohuan

1469
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:45,470
Yaohuan

1470
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,240
Di Renjie

1471
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,750
I am afraid of being

1472
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:58,080
Disguised as a girl

1473
01:26:58,830 --> 01:26:59,950
Only in front of

1474
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:02,790
you

1475
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,720
I am a girl

1476
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:06,430
I also want to

1477
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,040
Travel at a lake

1478
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:10,310
With my beloved

1479
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,200
Enjoy the moon

1480
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,950
Walk on snow

1481
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,640
Search for plum blossoms

1482
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:22,390
Yaohuan

1483
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,270
Now Di Renjie of the Central Justice Office

1484
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:41,600
Has frequently solved cases

1485
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:42,910
Handled cases impartially

1486
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,390
Righted the wrongs of folks

1487
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,080
Relieved the concern of the royal court

1488
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,390
He is a good official

1489
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:49,040
From today on

1490
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,160
He will be promoted to Shaoqing

1491
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:52,830
Hereby notified

1492
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:58,830
Wen Zhi’an, the lord of Yan State

1493
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,120
Has attempted to kill wife and son

1494
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,790
Deceived the emperor

1495
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,390
His guilt cannot be forgiven

1496
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,910
Considering his meritorious military service

1497
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:09,790
He is allowed to commit suicide

1498
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:24,750
Mother

1499
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:25,910
Luoyu

1500
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,310
This is the music you like most when you are alive

1501
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,160
Meng Shaobai of the past

1502
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:36,600
He will accompany you in the netherworld

1503
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:41,640
From today on

1504
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:43,830
I will forget the past

1505
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:46,870
Start a new life

1506
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,040
As you’ve expected

1507
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,830
Miss Xie has been heavily injured

1508
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,640
Her blood vessels had been reversed

1509
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,160
It depends on the heaven

1510
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,950
When she will awake

1511
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:05,270
Yaohuan

1512
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:08,600
I have planted several red plum trees

1513
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,120
In the backyard

1514
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:12,000
You must wake up

1515
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,830
Before it snows

1516
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,120
I am waiting to walk on snow and enjoy the plum blossoms

1517
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,240
With you
