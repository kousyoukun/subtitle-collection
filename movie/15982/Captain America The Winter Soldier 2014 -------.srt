Yes, left. I understand.

4
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,078
Do not tell!

5
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,727
- Left!
- Come on!

6
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,689
Need a doctor?

7
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,287
I need a new set of lungs.

8
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,608
Dude...

9
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,752
You ran 20 km in 30 minutes.

10
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:39,035
I think I left late.

11
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:41,507
Really?
Should be ashamed.

12
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:43,480
Should give another turn.

13
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:46,553
Do you already have? I guess so.

14
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:48,170
What division are you?

15
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:49,787
58, Paratroopers.

16
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:51,817

- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

18
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,872
I have to do the math.

19
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:59,913
Must
have been crazy to come back after thawing.

20
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:02,381
It's habit.

21
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,137
Glad to meet you, Sam.

22
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:05,615
Is your bed?

23
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:07,716
What?

24
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:09,190
Your bed is too soft.

25
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,223
When I was there I slept on the floor

26
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,784
I used stone as a pillow
like a caveman.

27
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:16,350
Now at home, sleeping in my bed.
It's...

28
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:17,693
A meringue iron.

29
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:19,508
I feel like I'm sinking to the floor.

30
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:21,868
For how long?

31
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,384
Two periods.

32
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:26,022
I miss the good old days?

33
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:29,405
Things are not so bad.

34
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,948
The food is much better.
I used to cook everything.

35
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:33,510
No polio, which is good.

36
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,674

Thanks for running

44
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,193
if that's what you call running.

45
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,345
So the deal?

46
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:01,840

Anyone know where the Smithsonian?

54
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:19,699
I want to pick up a fossil.

55
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:21,311
Very funny.

56
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:26,487
How are you?

57
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:27,614
Good.

58
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,536
I can run everywhere.

59
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:31,152

65
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,678
They asked you?

00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:48,771
1.5 billion.

67
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:50,328
- Why so?
- Because it's SHIELD.

68
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:54,511
When not diversion rate,
a violation.

69
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:56,054
I'm sure they had a good reason.

70
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:57,938
I'm tired of being the administrator of Fury.

71
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:59,801
Relax, not that complicated.

72

Elapsed time.

134

One.

141
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:44,940
I said, SHIELD does not negotiate.

142
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:49,973
Line is dead.

143
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:51,817
I lost contact...

144
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,505

148
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,051
Go back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

149
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:19,823
Natasha!

150
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,397
I thought it was more than just a shield.

151
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:14,038
We'll see.

152
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:41,175
's Weird.

153

What are you doing here?

154
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,052
Doing a copy of the hard drives.

155
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:48,896
Is a good habit.

156
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,551
Rumlow need your help.

157
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:51,645
What are you doing here?

158
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:56,816
SHIELD save the information confidential.

159
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:57,933
My hands on any can.

160
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,662
Our mission is to save hostages.

161
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:01,287
Not. That is your mission...

162
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,481
And you did it beautifully.

163
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,856
You jeopardized the entire operation.

164
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,547
I think you're overreacting.

165
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:27,688
Okay.

166
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,670
It was my error.

167
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:31,692

Can not you stop lying?

170
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,751
I lied
Romanoff had another mission than yours.

171
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:08,098
Which  you have not felt compelled
to tell me too.

172
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:09,317
Do not have to do anything.

173
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:10,952
Hostages could die, Nick.

174
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:14,424
I sent the greatest soldier in history
that does not happen.

175
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,034
Soldiers trust each other,
that makes them an army.

176
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,232
Not a group of people running
and shooting anyone.

177
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:22,025
The last time I trusted someone
I lost an eye.

178
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,267
I wanted to do something that you were not comfortable.

179
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:28,646
Agent Romanoff feels comfortable with everything.

180
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,116
I can lead a mission

181
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,400
the people they lead
have other directives.

182
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,747
Is called partitioning.

183
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,764
Nobody says secret that nobody knows.

184
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:39,716
Except you.

185
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:44,928
You're wrong about me.

186
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:46,972
WWW.SUBTITRARI.PROEu they share.

187
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,865
I work.

188
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:52,878
Insight platform.

189
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,319
I
Captain Rogers has permission for Project Insight. </ I>

190
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,080
Fury Manual Control Director, Nicholas J.

191
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,378
I confirmed. </ I>

192
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:04,128
They used to make music.

193
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:05,824
Da.

194
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:09,395
My grandfather worked on something for 40 years
.

195
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:12,052
Old man working in a beautiful building.

196
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,426
He got good tips.

197
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:17,934
Evening came home with a roll of dollar notes
a fanny pack lunch.

198
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:19,493
He said: "Good!"

199
00:15:19,747 --> 00:15:21,532
All replies: "Hi!"

200
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,803
Over time people became worse.

201
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:26,286
He welcomes...

202
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:28,297
And people say, "Mind your own business!"

203
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,721
Began to keep more closely lunch.

204
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,125
Have you been ripped off?

205
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:37,481
Every week an idiot asks:
"What's in the bag?"

206
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,067
What does he do?

207
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:40,817
Show.

208
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:44,997
Crumpled dollar bill and a Magnum 22 Charger.

209
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:50,884
Grandfather loved people.

210
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:54,127
But not too much trust in them.

211
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:01,472
I know.

212
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,149
I am a little older than .22.

213
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:40,697
This is Project Insight.

214
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:43,170
Three carriers flying next generation

215
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:45,954
synchronized to a network of satellites that locates
objectives.

216
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:47,851
Launched Lemurian Star.

217
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,916
Once launched not need to come down.

218
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:55,924
Fly
suborbital continuously due repulsors us.

219
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,314
Stark?

220
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,467
He had some suggestions when she saw our old
turbine.

221
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,613
These new precision weapons for long range

222
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:06,883
eliminate thousands of enemies per minute.

223
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:11,554
Read Satellites
DNA terrorists out of hiding before.

224
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,840
We neutralize many threats before they happen.

225
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,898
Punishment usually comes after the crime.

226
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:18,713
Not afford to wait that long.

227
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:20,061
Who do you mean?

228
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:21,663
After the events in New York

229
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,506
I convinced the Security Council World

230
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:25,744
we need
progress in analyzing threats.

231
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:28,295
This time we are ahead.

232
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,742
Pointed a gun at Earth
and call protection?

233
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:35,642
I read files SSR.

234
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:37,685
Generation high?

235
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:39,781
You did terrible things.

236
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:42,090
I made compromises

237
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,481
sometimes in some ways that I was not sleeping well.

238
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:46,647
But I did it for people to be free.

239
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:49,054
This is not freedom, it's fear.

240
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,514
SHIELD take the world as it is,
is not how we want us to be.

241
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:56,806
And it's time to know this program
Captain.

242
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:59,854
Do not get excited.

You must be proud of you, Peggy.

The world has changed and no one can go back.

Trying to do as well.

281

Sometimes we can do is to
start over.

Well, I can not let my fiancee.

306
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:16,807
This failure is unacceptable.

307
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,583
Considering that this attack took place
1.6 km from my territorial waters

308
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:23,246
is a little more than that.
Request immediate audience.

309
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:25,232
Do we need the audience, but by action.

310
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,616
Council's duty to oversee SHIELD.

311
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:29,586
A violation like this raises many questions.

312
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:31,526
How did French pirates

313
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:34,671
managed to hijack a vessel SHIELD

314
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:35,923
in broad daylight?

315
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:37,861
Counseling, is Algerian.

316
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,458
I can draw a map if you help.

317
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,962
Appreciate your intelligence,

318
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:44,108
Secretary  Pierce,

319
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,455
but this council has international piracy very seriously.

320
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:50,749
Really? I do not.

321
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:54,170
I am not concerned a ship
concerns me the entire fleet.

322
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:59,136
If this board will respond with a grudge

323
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:01,999
whenever someone attacks us,

324
00:23:02,592 --> 00:23:04,605
maybe we need someone to oversee.

325
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,792
Mr. Secretary, no one is suggesting...

326
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:12,656
Excuse me.

327
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,222
Other problems, Mr. Secretary?

328
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,063
It depends on the definition.

329
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:27,851
40 floors work remotely and need a diversion
to visit me?

330
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:30,085
A nuclear war would be enough.

331
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,546
Are you busy?

332
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:34,444
It solves a cash reserve.

333
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:39,852
I came to ask a favor.

334
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,180
I ask for a vote.

335
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,593
Insight project to be delayed.

336
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,602
Nick, not a favor.
Subcommittee's a large audience.

337
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,685
Maybe it's nothing.
It's probably nothing.

338
00:23:51,022 --> 00:23:53,588
I need time to make sure it's nothing.

339
00:23:53,822 --> 00:23:54,881
If it's a problem?

340
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:57,845
Both we enjoy that we launched
carriers flying.

341
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,374
Agree.

342
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:05,149
But you have to ask
Iron Man come to my niece's birthday.

343
00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:06,816
Thank you, sir.

344
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:10,365
And not running.
Need to socialize.

345
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:14,057
I Trouble is... </ i>

346
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:15,911
I think it's worse.

347
00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:19,788
A policeman arrested me last week.

348
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,439
Because I was drunk.

349
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:26,010
silent to avoid a plastic bag.

350
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:29,379
I thought it was an explosive.

351
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:33,515
Some things leave them there.

352
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,609
Others take them with you.

353
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,790
It's our job to decipher how to fight it.

354
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,793
'll Be in a big suitcase
or a small bag?

355
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:45,647
Up to you.

356
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:48,046
- See you next month.
- Sure.

357
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:52,821
Look who is the runner.

358
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:55,466
I listened to the last minute.
Very intense.

359
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,734
Yes, all veterans have the same problem.

360
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:00,601
Blame.

361
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:02,304
Sorry.

362
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:04,349
Have you lost someone?

363
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,473
My co-pilot, Riley.

364
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:09,734
Flew a night mission.

365
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:12,034
A standard operation rescue parachute.

366
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,390
I had done 1000 times before.

367
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,972
Until
propelled grenade killed Riley.

368
00:25:20,113 --> 00:25:21,809
I could do.

369
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:24,467
It's like I was there just to see
.

370
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,340
- Sorry.
- Then

371
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:30,912
cost me more to find a reason to be here
.

372
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:35,331
Are you happy now, back into the world?

373
00:25:35,627 --> 00:25:39,934
There is no one now who give me orders.

374
00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:41,246
Course.

375
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:43,385
Thinking of giving up?

376
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:45,186
Not.

377
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:48,451
Do not know.

378
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:52,959
I honestly do not know what I would handle
if I would.

379
00:25:53,226 --> 00:25:54,292
Mixed martial arts?

380
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,970
It's just a fantastic idea that came to me now.

381
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,233
You could do anything you want.

382
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:02,080
What makes you happy?

383
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,392

If you want you can use my car.

433
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:56,252
May be cheaper than the basement.

434
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,710
Yes? How much would it cost?

435
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,253
A cup of coffee?

436
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:05,638
Thanks, but...

437

I already have a washing machine down

00:34:15,627 --> 00:34:17,798
Really think I need one?

446
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:21,597

447
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,431

Do not know.

476
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:06,360

00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:44,473
Captain, you will return to SHIELD.

507
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:45,789
Yes, one moment.

508
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:47,016
I will now.

509
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:49,421
Okay.

510
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:54,895
're A terrible liar.

511
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,083
I STRIKE team accompanied him to SHIELD Rogers. </ I>

512
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,360
I said.

513
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,244
- Let's go.
- Yes.

514
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:18,414
STRIKE, we move.

515
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:27,977
Captain.

516
00:40:28,014 --> 00:40:29,077
Alexander Pierce.

517
00:40:29,148 --> 00:40:30,663
Sir, it's an honor.

518
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,022
Honor is mine, Captain.

519
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,589
My father served in the 101st.
Enter.

520
00:40:35,812 --> 00:40:38,715
This picture was made five years after that me and Nick
we met.

521
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,668
When I worked at the State Department
in Bogota.

522
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:43,498
ELN rebels captured embassy.

523
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:48,005
Security pulled me me, but the rebels had taken hostages
.

524
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:51,589
SHIELD Nick was deputy chief.

525
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,158
And comes to me with a plan.

526
00:40:53,394 --> 00:40:55,224
Wants to enter the building through the sewer.

527
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:58,156
I said, "No, we will negotiate."

528
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:02,526
It turned out that not negotiating
ELN and issued a warrant of death.

529
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,095
They entered the sewer and they found?

530
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,637
They found empty.

531
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:09,721
Nick ignored my order directly.

532
00:41:09,952 --> 00:41:13,402
Conducted a military operation unauthorized alien realm

533
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:16,299
and saved the life of a dozen political officials

534
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:17,849
including my face.

535
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:19,225
When you promoted.

536
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:21,184
I have never regretted.

537
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,710
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

538
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:30,530
Do not know.

539
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:33,268
Knew he was listening?

540
00:41:33,913 --> 00:41:36,322
I knew told me Nick.

541
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:39,332
You said and he put them?

542
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:47,317
I want to show you something.

543
00:41:48,194 --> 00:41:49,560
Who  I contacted Batroc </ i>

544
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,173
Live?

545
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:54,609
Yesterday they gave him a place not too sure of Algeria.

546
00:41:55,668 --> 00:41:58,972
He said he's a suspect?
Batroc's not a murderer.

547
00:41:59,194 --> 00:42:01,563
No, it's more complicated than that.

548
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,463
Batroc was contacted anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star.

549
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:08,182
Was contacted via e-mail
and paid by bank transfer.

550
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,666
Money was passed

551
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:13,041
by 17 fake accounts.

552
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,563
Last was a holding company I </ i>

553
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:17,713
registered to Jacob Veech.

554
00:42:17,939 --> 00:42:19,147
I need to know who it is?

555
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:21,417
Unlikely.
Veech died six years ago.

556
00:42:21,654 --> 00:42:24,581
Last address was at Elmhurts 1435.

557
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:28,404
When I met Nick's mother lived at 1437
.

558
00:42:30,072 --> 00:42:33,469
Say that Fury hired pirates?
Why?

559
00:42:33,816 --> 00:42:35,532
Main theory

560
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:39,429
is that diversion was to purchase coverage

561
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:42,389
and selling classified information.

562
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,044
The sale has been suspended

563
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:46,885
and that led to death.

564
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:53,005
If you really knew Nick
should know that this is not true.

565
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:56,040
Why do we talk?

566
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,898
I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted

567
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,947
but because Nick asked me, because we were both realistic
.

568
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:11,875
Knew that despite diplomacy and rhetoric handshakes

569
00:43:12,658 --> 00:43:15,337
to build a better world

570
00:43:15,695 --> 00:43:19,455
sometimes necessary to destroy the old world.

571
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,945
This creates enemies.

572
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:27,569
Like  who made you immoral because you had the courage

573
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:31,209
to get your hands dirty and try to build something better.

574
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:34,808
And the idea that those people can be happy today

575
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:38,720
upsets me greatly.

576
00:43:42,796 --> 00:43:45,208
Captain, you were the only one that saw Nick
alive.

577
00:43:45,254 --> 00:43:46,787
I do not think it's a coincidence.

578
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:49,514
And you do not think so.

579
00:43:51,444 --> 00:43:52,977
I'll ask again.

580
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:55,117
Why was he there?

581
00:43:58,357 --> 00:44:00,082
Told me not to trust anyone.

582
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:05,046
I wonder if that included him and on him.

583
00:44:09,952 --> 00:44:11,020
Sorry.

584
00:44:11,378 --> 00:44:12,948
Those were his last words.

585
00:44:14,304 --> 00:44:15,686
Excuse me.

586
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:19,997
Captain,

587
00:44:20,488 --> 00:44:23,669
someone killed my friend
and I will find out why.

588
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,274
If someone will interpose in my way,
will regret.

589
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:30,040
Anyone.

590
00:44:32,742 --> 00:44:34,307
I understand.

591
00:44:51,794 --> 00:44:53,095
Control operation.

592
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,732
I confirmed. </ I>

593
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:58,225
All staff STRIKE remains in position.

594
00:44:58,449 --> 00:44:59,920
- Was it?
- Yes, sir.

595
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:01,810
- Forensic Department.
I - Confirmed. </ I>

596
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,030
Captain.

597
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:04,149
Rumlow.

598
00:45:13,496 --> 00:45:16,271
The registered
fibers will show us what they have found on the roof.

599
00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:17,964
Want to prepare tactical team?

600
00:45:18,191 --> 00:45:20,102
No, first let's see what it is.

601
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,404
Okay.

602
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,537
What is the status so far?

603
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:37,406
- Go to Administration.
I - Confirmed. </ I>

604
00:45:37,897 --> 00:45:38,954
Excuse me.

605
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:49,343
Regret what happened with Fury.

606
00:45:49,785 --> 00:45:51,937
It's a shame  what happened.

607
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,285
Thanks.

608
00:46:12,555 --> 00:46:13,599
The archive.

609
00:46:13,698 --> 00:46:14,972
I confirmed. </ I>

610
00:46:30,697 --> 00:46:32,512
Before we begin,

611
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:34,977
anyone want to come down?

612
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:41,853
EMERGENCY STOP

613
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:11,282
Mobilize STRIKE units, floor 25.

614
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,632
Relax, buddy.

615
00:47:28,835 --> 00:47:31,790
Captain
I know this is not personal.

616
00:47:43,172 --> 00:47:44,915
Feels like it personally.

617
00:47:53,568 --> 00:47:55,329
Throw shield and put your hands!

618
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,001
Cancel, Rogers!

619
00:48:13,102 --> 00:48:14,397
Open the door!

620
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,429
You have nowhere to run!

621
00:48:36,107 --> 00:48:37,136
Kidding?

622
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:39,639
Heading to the garage.
Close the bridge!

623
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:52,754
I Freeze, Captain Rogers </ i>

624
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:54,420
I Freeze! </ I>

625
00:48:54,606 --> 00:48:57,120
I repeat, stand down </ i>

626
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,492
Please  carefully.

627
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,973
Leave all that work.

628
00:49:37,214 --> 00:49:38,571
This is level one.

629
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:40,487
Contact DOT.

630
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,255
All the lights are on red.

631
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,088
Autopistele Close all airports Baltimore Washington

632
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:46,732
Washington Dulles and Reagan .

633
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:49,902
All the cameras in the city
go through this monitor here.

634
00:49:50,777 --> 00:49:52,233
Scan all open source.

635
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,872
Phones, computers,

636
00:49:54,111 --> 00:49:55,183
tablets.

637
00:49:55,267 --> 00:49:56,361
Any.

638
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:57,931
If someone writes on Tweet about it

639
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,152
I want to know.

640
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:01,075
No disrespect, lead SHIELD

641
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,347
a manhunt for Captain America. We deserve to know why.

642
00:50:04,727 --> 00:50:06,277
Because we lied.

643
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:11,108
Captain Rogers has information related to Director Fury death.

644
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:13,150
Refused to share with us.

645
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:16,453
On how difficult it is to accept,

646
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:20,904
Captain America is a fugitive for SHIELD.

647
00:50:48,342 --> 00:50:49,434
- Where is it?
- Safe.

648
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:50,459
Tell me!

649
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:51,562
Where'd you get that?

650
00:50:51,656 --> 00:50:52,708
Why should I tell you?

651
00:50:52,747 --> 00:50:54,698
Fury and gave it? Why?

652
00:50:54,915 --> 00:50:56,125
- What is it?
- I do not know.

653
00:50:56,318 --> 00:50:57,381
Not lie.

654
00:50:57,613 --> 00:50:59,343
Only I do know everything, Rogers.

655
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:02,398
Knew that Fury hired pirates?

656
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:04,641
Makes sense.

657
00:51:04,649 --> 00:51:06,747
Ship was illegal,
Fury willing to go and do likewise.

658
00:51:06,853 --> 00:51:08,388
Do not ask again.

659
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:11,342
I know who killed him Fury.

660
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,512
Most intelligence agencies believe there is
.

661
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,635
Whoever believes in him
Warrior Winter calls.

662
00:51:20,847 --> 00:51:22,755
Is credited with over two dozen murders

663
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:25,130
the last 50 years.

664
00:51:25,354 --> 00:51:26,635
So it's a myth.

665
00:51:27,135 --> 00:51:30,212
Five years ago I escorted out of the Iran nuclear engineer.

666
00:51:30,449 --> 00:51:32,622
Someone pulled the tires
near Odessa.

667
00:51:32,903 --> 00:51:35,046
I lost control and fell off a cliff.

668
00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:36,720
We saved both.

669
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,877
But Winter Warrior was there.

670
00:51:39,498 --> 00:51:40,728
Encloses engineer

671
00:51:40,953 --> 00:51:42,011
so he shot

672
00:51:42,241 --> 00:51:43,393
right through me.

673
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:45,365
A Soviet bullet.

674
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:48,727
No streaks. Farewell bikini.

675
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:52,277
Yeah, I bet that now you look bad in them.

676
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:57,017
Not help if you go after him.
I know, I tried.

677
00:51:58,308 --> 00:52:00,437
Like you said, it's a myth.

678
00:52:05,244 --> 00:52:07,186
Well, to see what wishes mythical character.

679
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,485
I Nick Fury was killed in cold blood. </ I>

680
00:52:09,858 --> 00:52:13,931
For a rational person,
as a martyr, not a traitor.

681
00:52:14,577 --> 00:52:15,927
Do you know what makes him a traitor?

682
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:18,731
That has hired mercenaries to hijack
own ship.

683
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,316
Nick Fury to use your friendship to oblige the Council

684
00:52:22,317 --> 00:52:26,956
Insight project delay, project
what was to expose illegal operations.

685
00:52:26,957 --> 00:52:28,882
At best, you lied.

686
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:31,913
- And the worst...
- I ask for his resignation?

687
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:36,632
- If you like, take a pen and paper!
- This debate may be delayed.

688
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:41,472
- But want a debate?
- I had already, Mr. Secretary.

689
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,495
Council has voted to immediate activation of the Project Insight.

690
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:52,939
If you mean one of your jokes
brilliant, it's time.

691
00:52:57,593 --> 00:53:01,144
First rule when it escapes it will not run, but to go.

692
00:53:01,556 --> 00:53:04,175
If I run with this shoe, I would
ways.

693
00:53:06,532 --> 00:53:08,984
Driver has access to the six.

694
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,758
How will reactivate the system
SHIELD will know where we are.

695
00:53:11,759 --> 00:53:15,819
- How much time?
- About nine minutes from...

696
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:17,946
... for now.

697
00:53:22,707 --> 00:53:27,143
Fury was right about the ship.
Someone trying to hide something.

698
00:53:27,144 --> 00:53:29,466
The driver is protected by an artificial intelligence.

699
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:31,911
Continue to rewrite to neutralize my orders.

700
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:33,734
Takes him thyself?

701
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:37,333
Who created this thing
is smarter than me.

702
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:38,839
WWW.SUBTITRARI.PROCu least.

703
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,937
Launch a prosecution.

704
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:55,744
The SHIELD developed to detect malicious
, so...

705
00:53:55,756 --> 00:53:59,717
if we fail to read the files,
can find out where it came from.

706
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:01,371
Can I help you?

707
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:05,606
No, my fiance
wanted to choose a destination for your honeymoon.

708
00:54:05,607 --> 00:54:11,096
- Exactly! Follow us to get married.
- Congratulations! Where you want to go?

709
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:13,137
In New Jersey.

710
00:54:17,635 --> 00:54:22,171
- I got the same kind of glasses.
- Are like twins.

711
00:54:22,371 --> 00:54:25,349
Yeah, I have!
You're perfect.

712
00:54:25,684 --> 00:54:29,308
- If you need, ask for Aaron.
- Thank you.

713
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:34,589
- You said nine-minute, hurry up!
- Relax!

714
00:54:34,789 --> 00:54:36,600
Ready.

715
00:54:40,221 --> 00:54:43,538
- You know the place?
- I've been. Let's go!

716
00:54:44,874 --> 00:54:49,787
Standard tactical team. Two rear, two on side
two goes to the us.

717
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:52,878
If we admit, I intervene,
and you run to the back stairs.

718
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:55,089
- Shut up. Take me by the throat and laugh.
- What?

719
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:56,216
Do it!

720
00:55:04,618 --> 00:55:07,275
- Negative.
- I want a report on the story.

721
00:55:07,276 --> 00:55:10,064
- Third Negative.
- The second Negative.

722
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:12,443
Start with upper and lower floors by me.

723
00:55:20,415 --> 00:55:21,662
- Give me a hug.
- What?

724
00:55:21,663 --> 00:55:23,923
Showing affection in public
hinders the agent.

725
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:25,561
Yes, exactly.

726
00:55:34,974 --> 00:55:36,220
So you're embarrassed?

727
00:55:37,024 --> 00:55:38,750
Not quite the right word.

728
00:55:47,434 --> 00:55:50,553
Captain America where he learned to steal cars?

729
00:55:50,843 --> 00:55:52,874
From Nazi Germany.

730
00:55:52,952 --> 00:55:55,525
I borrowed it.
Get your feet off the glove.

731
00:55:58,665 --> 00:56:02,862
May.
I ask a question to which you do not need to answer.

732
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:05,334
But if you will answer me,
is like me replied.

733
00:56:05,336 --> 00:56:08,440
- Let's hear it.
- Was your first kiss of 1945?

734
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,712
- Was pathetic, right?
- I said that!

735
00:56:10,713 --> 00:56:15,585
- It seems like just what you said.
- I was just wondering how much practice you do.

736
00:56:15,593 --> 00:56:17,816
- I need to practice.
- Everybody needs practice!

737
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:21,868
I kissed in 1945.
I 95 years old, not dead.

738
00:56:21,888 --> 00:56:23,726
None Special?

739
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,594
Not so easy to find someone
a similar life experience.

740
00:56:29,614 --> 00:56:31,634
What's the problem?
It is enough to invent something.

741
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:32,765
How do you do?

742
00:56:33,072 --> 00:56:35,203
Do not know.
The truth keeps circumstances.

743
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:37,874
Not the same for everyone.
Every time is different.

744
00:56:38,552 --> 00:56:41,964
- It's true for me.
- It's hard to live like this.

745
00:56:42,104 --> 00:56:44,485
But it's a good way not to die.

746
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:49,059
's Difficult to trust someone you do not know
what kind of person he is.

747
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,775
's Right.

748
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:57,724
- What would you like to be?
- How about a friend?

749
00:57:00,819 --> 00:57:04,953
There is a possibility that you will not be made for this job
Rogers.

750
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,554
I got.

751
00:57:23,164 --> 00:57:27,361
- File came from these coordinates.
- I.

752
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:28,602
SPACE CAMP
LEHIGH FORBIDDEN

753
00:57:34,966 --> 00:57:37,983
's camp who have trained.

754
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:42,150
S changed much?

755
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:45,174
Bit.

756
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:47,787
I hurry up, ladies! </ I>

757
00:57:47,807 --> 00:57:49,354

zero where no radio wave.

Who created the file
a router be used to make confusion.

764
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,447
What is it?

765
00:58:17,647 --> 00:58:22,411
Regulation army prohibited ammunition storage in a radius of 450 m from camp.

766
00:58:22,611 --> 00:58:24,898
This building should not be here.

767
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,495
Is SHIELD.

768
00:58:42,297 --> 00:58:44,426
Probably where it all started.

769
00:58:47,515 --> 00:58:48,526

Who is this girl?

774
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,968
If you already work in an office secret...

775
00:59:40,238 --> 00:59:43,260
why you should hide the elevator?

01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:12,717
It's about the operation
Paperclip after WWII.

797
01:02:12,757 --> 01:02:15,883
SHIELD recruited scholars Germans with strategic capabilities.

798

As I said... </ i>

826
01:03:54,623 --> 01:04:00,473
- What's the driver?
I - Project Insight requires knowledge. </ I>

827
01:04:00,493 --> 01:04:02,938
So I've written an algorithm. </ I>

828
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:07,093
- What kind of algorithm does what?
I - The answer to your question is fascinating. </ I>

829
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:11,396
But unfortunately
'll be too dead to hear. </ I>

830
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,249
unidentified enemy aircraft.
With short-range missiles.

831
01:04:20,421 --> 01:04:23,018
- In 30 seconds.
- Who sent him?

832
01:04:23,038 --> 01:04:27,421
- SHIELD.
I - I'm afraid that I gained time, Captain. </ I>

833
01:04:27,621 --> 01:04:31,026
I Admit it, it's better. </ I>

834
01:04:31,226 --> 01:04:36,299
We're both timeless. </ I>

835
01:05:58,676 --> 01:06:00,529
Get resources.

836
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,711
I leave, Mr. Pierce.
Do you need anything?

837
01:06:20,849 --> 01:06:24,786
No!
Well, Renata, you can go.

838
01:06:25,187 --> 01:06:28,131
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

839
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,627
Do you want some milk?

840
01:06:44,577 --> 01:06:46,899
Schedule has changed.

841
01:06:48,324 --> 01:06:51,097
Time was shortened.

842
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:56,661
Two of the six targets.

843
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,384
I already lost Zola.

844
01:07:00,627 --> 01:07:02,961
I want  confirmed dead in 10 hours.

845
01:07:04,428 --> 01:07:10,171
Excuse me, Mr. Pierce,
I forgot my phone.

846
01:07:14,696 --> 01:07:18,880
Oh, Renata, why did not you knock on the door?

847
01:07:42,252 --> 01:07:43,307
Hey, buddy.

848
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:47,017
I'm sorry, excuse me.
We need a place to hide.

849
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:49,703
All our acquaintances are dead.

850
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:53,478
Not all.

851
01:08:10,439 --> 01:08:12,282
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

852
01:08:20,961 --> 01:08:22,212
What is it?

853
01:08:25,766 --> 01:08:29,350
When I walked into SHIELD,
I thought it the right way.

854
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:36,485
But apparently,
I replaced the KGB with HYDRA.

855
01:08:41,762 --> 01:08:45,286
I thought I knew whose were
lies they told.

856
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:50,468
From now on, no make a difference.

857
01:08:52,021 --> 01:08:54,299
Probably are not made for the job.

858
01:08:58,615 --> 01:09:02,200
- I owe.
- It's okay.

859
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:04,926
Now  If you were me...

860
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,818
and I would have saved your life, be honest with me...

861
01:09:11,697 --> 01:09:13,684
you trust me?

862
01:09:15,805 --> 01:09:17,114
Now, yes.

863
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,948
And I am always honest.

864
01:09:22,693 --> 01:09:26,802
're In a good mood for
one who just found out he died for nothing.

865
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:30,832
I like to know against whom to fight.

866
01:09:31,454 --> 01:09:35,824
Breakfast is ready,
unless you fed something.

867
01:09:37,955 --> 01:09:41,342
The question is: Who can launch at SHIELD
domestic missile attack?

868
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,178
Pierce.

869
01:09:44,463 --> 01:09:47,256
And incidentally sits on
safest building in the world.

870
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:48,769
But working alone.

871
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,414
Algorithm Zola was in Star Lemurian.

872
01:09:51,922 --> 01:09:53,617
So Jasper Sitwell.

873
01:09:57,016 --> 01:10:00,376
The question is: How do two of the most hunted men in Washington

874
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:03,061
kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight?

875
01:10:03,352 --> 01:10:05,505
The answer is: I do.

876
01:10:06,192 --> 01:10:08,306
- What is it?
- You can call it a resume.

877
01:10:11,752 --> 01:10:15,463
E Bakhmala mission Khandil Khalid.
Were you?

878
01:10:16,514 --> 01:10:18,786
Do not tell me it was a paratrooper!

879
01:10:18,826 --> 01:10:21,471
- E Riley?
- Yes.

880
01:10:21,491 --> 01:10:24,547
How did you do? Helicopters had problems with launching grenades
.

881
01:10:24,747 --> 01:10:26,897
- You have used parachutes invisible?
- No.

882
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:28,617
With these.

883
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:37,157
- You said you're a pilot?
- I said to the pilot.

884
01:10:40,805 --> 01:10:44,723
I can not ask you to do it, Sam.
Now you're out of good reason.

885
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:48,503
Captain America needs my help, a good reason to return.

886
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:55,147
- How can we take this?
- Fort Meade is last.

887
01:10:55,457 --> 01:10:58,706
Protected
supervised three gates and a thick wall of steel.

888
01:11:01,352 --> 01:11:02,783
Not be a problem.

889
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,057
EXO-7 FALCON Top Secret

890
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:06,348
Listen, I gotta go home tonight
,

891
01:11:06,368 --> 01:11:10,906
I have problems with
electoral college and must make an appearance.

892
01:11:11,156 --> 01:11:13,514
With one in particular, Senator?

893
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,807
No, not really.

894
01:11:16,282 --> 01:11:20,043
- With a special one for 23 years.
- Very special, I understand.

895
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:23,904
Wants to become a journalist, I have no idea.
Who hears the time?

896
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:27,845
- Does not seem too serious a problem.
- So you say you are broke back.

897
01:11:28,287 --> 01:11:31,799
Not the right place to talk.
Nice tie clip.

898
01:11:32,707 --> 01:11:35,398
- Thank you.
- Come here!

899
01:11:36,504 --> 01:11:37,780
Hail, HYDRA!

900
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,221
- See, it's just...
- Yes, I understand.

901
01:11:43,074 --> 01:11:45,653
- You say we should go to the doctor?
- I think so.

902
01:11:50,165 --> 01:11:52,165
CALL ALEXANDER PIERCE

903
01:11:53,488 --> 01:11:56,040
I need a minute.
Bring the car here.

904
01:12:00,097 --> 01:12:03,090
- Yes, sir.
I - Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? </ I>

905
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:05,676
I is said
crab pies are great. </ I>

906
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:10,140
- Who is it?
I - Handsome sunglasses, 10:00. </ I>

907
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:13,023
I Other 10:00. </ I>

908
01:12:15,178 --> 01:12:16,271
I Yak-so. </ I>

909
01:12:18,621 --> 01:12:22,202
- What?
I - Now go around the corner to your right. </ I>

910
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:24,823
You will find a gray car in second place in the parking lot.

911
01:12:25,025 --> 01:12:28,949
- We're going to walk a little.
- Why should I accept?

912
01:12:29,035 --> 01:12:31,671
Because your tie  seems to be very expensive

913
01:12:31,911 --> 01:12:34,424
and I'd hate to ruin.

914
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,133
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

915
01:12:45,518 --> 01:12:47,904
- I've never heard of him.
- What makes Star Lemurian?

916
01:12:48,138 --> 01:12:50,726
Vomiting, suffer from seasickness.

917
01:12:55,306 --> 01:12:58,867
Theater that's for me to understand
you want to throw me off the roof?

918
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:01,515
There seems to be your style, Rogers.

919
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:05,054
's Right. It's not

920
01:13:05,943 --> 01:13:07,094
's her style.

921
01:13:10,692 --> 01:13:14,147
- Chick from accounting, Lauren...
- Lillian.

922
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:16,902
- Has a lip piercing.
- Yeah, she's cute.

923
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:18,444
Yes, but I do not feel ready yet.

924
01:13:30,129 --> 01:13:32,289
Zola's algorithm is a program...

925
01:13:33,726 --> 01:13:36,794
- Insight choice of targets.
- What goals?

926
01:13:37,031 --> 01:13:38,140
You!

927
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:41,379
TV journalist in Cairo
Undersecretary of Defense

928
01:13:41,589 --> 01:13:43,656
best high school student in Iowa

929
01:13:44,074 --> 01:13:48,032
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, a threat to anyone
HYDRA!

930
01:13:48,356 --> 01:13:52,725
- Now or in the future!
- The Future? How can you know?

931
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:57,042
How could I?

932
01:13:58,779 --> 01:14:01,859
XXI century is a digital book.

933
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:05,569
Zola learned HYDRA have read it.

934
01:14:08,297 --> 01:14:12,146
Bank accounts, medical tests,
voting methods, e-mail,

935
01:14:12,152 --> 01:14:14,678
phone calls
university exams tests.

936
01:14:14,878 --> 01:14:21,390
Zola's algorithm evaluates past
People to predict the future.

937
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:22,913
And then what happens?

938
01:14:26,037 --> 01:14:28,669
- God, Pierce will kill me!
- What will happen?

939
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:35,055
Insight flying aircraft carriers will delete people from the list.

940
01:14:35,255 --> 01:14:39,167
Tens of millions  one shot.

941
01:14:45,587 --> 01:14:49,261
- Leak information not like Hydra.
- Better shut.

942
01:14:49,461 --> 01:14:52,423
Insight launches in 16 hours.
We have little time.

943
01:14:52,443 --> 01:14:55,911
I know we will use it to bypass scanning
DNA and reach carriers.

944
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:59,239
What? Are you crazy?
Is a bad idea!

945
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:44,450
Shit!

946
01:15:55,807 --> 01:15:56,861
Hang!

947
01:17:37,712 --> 01:17:40,751
I'll handle it,
will find Him.

948
01:18:46,032 --> 01:18:47,123
Go, I got it!

949
01:19:14,372 --> 01:19:16,191
I repeat, are civilian area. </ I>

950
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:22,118
I Turn LZ 2300 Virginia Avenue. </ I>

951
01:19:22,129 --> 01:19:24,777
I meeting in two minutes. </ i>

952
01:19:26,805 --> 01:19:28,587
I shootouts on the freeway. </ i>

953
01:19:28,813 --> 01:19:31,280
I Civilians in danger,
repeat civilians in danger. </ i>

954
01:19:35,545 --> 01:19:38,060
LZ 2300 Virginia Avenue. </ I>

955
01:19:38,283 --> 01:19:39,816
I meeting in two minutes. </ I>

956
01:20:05,307 --> 01:20:07,645
Go! Get out of here!

957
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:44,011
- Bucky!
- Who the fuck is Bucky?

958
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:15,915
Leave shield, Captain!
Knees...

959
01:22:15,927 --> 01:22:20,068
Down! On your knees! Down!

960
01:22:20,419 --> 01:22:22,415
Do not move!

961
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:32,433
Put ​​the gun down! Not here!

962
01:22:47,561 --> 01:22:48,660
He was.

963
01:22:51,185 --> 01:22:55,168
We looked forward.
As I do not know.

964
01:22:55,368 --> 01:22:57,759
How?
It happened 70 years ago.

965
01:22:58,252 --> 01:22:59,420
Zola.

966
01:22:59,647 --> 01:23:03,622
Bucky's unit was captured in '43.
He ​​did experiments on him.

967
01:23:03,628 --> 01:23:06,061
Helped him survive.

968
01:23:07,703 --> 01:23:11,080
- Then they found...
- It's not you, Steve.

969
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:16,678
Even when I had nothing, I had
Bucky.

970
01:23:19,304 --> 01:23:21,086
Need to find a doctor immediately.

971
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:24,754
If you apply pressure to the wound,
will bleed out.

972
01:23:32,408 --> 01:23:34,757
Thing my brain was mush.

973
01:23:37,843 --> 01:23:39,128
And who is he?

974
01:23:49,668 --> 01:23:51,544
Three holes.
Start digging.

975
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:21,064
Wound from a firearm.
Lost a pint of blood!

976
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:23,134
- Even a liter!
- I got it!

977
01:24:23,154 --> 01:24:24,802
First wants to see.

978
01:24:33,932 --> 01:24:36,197
Time!

979
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:43,571
Spinal Cord Injury
stern sank, fractured clavicle,

980
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:47,654
perforated liver,
terrible headache.

981
01:24:47,674 --> 01:24:50,586
- You forget the lung over.
- Of course, do not forget it and that.

982
01:24:50,606 --> 01:24:52,688
Otherwise fine.

983
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:55,277
I have operated.
Heart stops beating.

984
01:24:55,297 --> 01:24:59,325
Tetrodotoxin B
ralentează heartbeat to one per minute.

985
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:01,363
Banner created for stress.

986
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:04,330
Did not work on him,
but we used it well.

987
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:06,349
Why all the secrecy?
Why not tell us?

988
01:25:06,549 --> 01:25:09,148
Any attempt on his life had failed to appear.

989
01:25:09,348 --> 01:25:11,293
I can not kill,
if you are already dead.

990
01:25:11,493 --> 01:25:12,894
Then...

991
01:25:13,094 --> 01:25:15,970
not know who to trust.

992
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:21,599
BANK

993
01:25:31,022 --> 01:25:32,406
I Sergeant Barnes... </ i>

994
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:35,792
I Bucky not </ i>

995
01:25:39,149 --> 01:25:42,229
I started procedure. </ I>

996
01:25:46,095 --> 01:25:49,849
I hand you'll be the new Hydra. </ i>

997
01:25:50,284 --> 01:25:51,459
I freeze it </ i>

998
01:26:02,655 --> 01:26:07,384
Sir, is still unstable,
not consistent.

999
01:26:21,118 --> 01:26:22,174
Mission Report.

1000
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:27,025
Mission Report now!

1001
01:26:39,584 --> 01:26:41,299
The man on the bridge...

1002
01:26:44,135 --> 01:26:45,473
who?

1003
01:26:46,971 --> 01:26:49,864
Have you seen this week
another mission.

1004
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:54,171
I knew.

1005
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:04,713
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1006
01:27:06,938 --> 01:27:11,758
You cheated century.
I need to do it more again.

1007
01:27:12,758 --> 01:27:16,759
Society oscillates between order and chaos.

1008
01:27:17,025 --> 01:27:19,517
Tomorrow we will give a small boost.

1009
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:24,080
But if you do not honor you,
I can not do mine.

1010
01:27:25,367 --> 01:27:28,720
And HYDRA
world can not give freedom they deserve.

1011
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:32,999
But I knew him.

1012
01:27:39,366 --> 01:27:40,601
Prepare it!

1013
01:27:40,999 --> 01:27:43,676
A cryogenics undergone long.

1014
01:27:43,922 --> 01:27:47,064
Memory Undo them and take it again.

1015
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,130
The man refused the Nobel Peace Prize.

1016
01:28:31,737 --> 01:28:37,418
Said that peace was not an achievement,
was a responsibility.

1017
01:28:38,932 --> 01:28:42,085
See, stuff
threaten my confidence.

1018
01:28:42,563 --> 01:28:44,369
We have to stop the launch.

1019
01:28:44,774 --> 01:28:48,291
I do not think that the Council will accept my calls.

1020
01:28:50,112 --> 01:28:54,329
- What are they?
- When carriers will reach 900m

1021
01:28:54,344 --> 01:28:58,203
satellites will make a triangle with Insight
and become flying tanks.

1022
01:28:58,243 --> 01:28:59,927
'll Have to intercept conveyors

1023
01:28:59,947 --> 01:29:03,211
and replace them with our target audiences
.

1024
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:06,392
One or two will not be enough.
Need to connect all three

1025
01:29:06,412 --> 01:29:09,804
to work.
If only one operative,

1026
01:29:09,824 --> 01:29:12,278
more people die.

1027
01:29:12,478 --> 01:29:15,903
Assume that all aboard three conveyor
part of HYDRA.

1028
01:29:16,103 --> 01:29:18,743
To get them, you have to insert these servers

1029
01:29:18,943 --> 01:29:21,468
And maybe we can save what...

1030
01:29:21,488 --> 01:29:24,993
Do not save anything. We will not only destroy
carriers, but SHIELD.

1031
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:26,809
SHIELD has nothing to do with it.

1032
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:28,861
I have entrusted the mission,
it will end.

1033
01:29:28,868 --> 01:29:31,166
SHIELD has been compromised, you said that
.

1034
01:29:31,172 --> 01:29:33,300
HYDRA sprang from nowhere,
nobody realized.

1035
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,801
Why do we find in this cave?
That I realized.

1036
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:39,206
How many paid before you realize?

1037
01:29:41,453 --> 01:29:45,161
- I knew nothing of Barnes.
- If you knew, you were telling me?

1038
01:29:45,361 --> 01:29:47,766
Or you had divided him?

1039
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:50,533
SHIELD, HYDRA...

1040
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:54,505
- everything disappears.
- He's right.

1041
01:30:00,779 --> 01:30:03,841
Do not look at me. Doing what he does,
but they are slow.

1042
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:08,362
Well...

1043
01:30:15,027 --> 01:30:17,995
It seems that you give the orders now,
Captain.

1044
01:30:28,871 --> 01:30:30,356
I I come after you. </ I>

1045
01:30:31,285 --> 01:30:33,543
I Mine wanted to accompany me to the cemetery. </ I>

1046
01:30:33,554 --> 01:30:37,583
- I know, I'm sorry.
- I wanted to be alone.

1047
01:30:38,626 --> 01:30:39,739
How was it?

1048
01:30:40,417 --> 01:30:41,654
Was good.

1049
01:30:42,188 --> 01:30:43,632
's Near father.

1050
01:30:45,878 --> 01:30:49,257
- I just wanted to ask...
- I know what you mean, Buck!

1051
01:30:49,457 --> 01:30:53,044
Come on, put down the sofa cushion
since we were kids.

1052
01:30:53,851 --> 01:30:58,063
'll Be fun.
'll Just get my shoes and take out the trash.

1053
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:05,201
Come on!

1054
01:31:07,949 --> 01:31:12,048
Thanks, Buck,
but I can handle it.

1055
01:31:12,307 --> 01:31:16,136
That's right .. you do not need.

1056
01:31:19,438 --> 01:31:22,060
I am with you until the end,
friend.

1057
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:27,324
- Will he, you know?
- I know.

1058
01:31:27,645 --> 01:31:31,518
Listen ! Whatever happened to you and everything is now...

1059
01:31:31,718 --> 01:31:35,829
I do not think it's a type of saving,
but rather a guy to be stopped.

1060
01:31:38,234 --> 01:31:42,260
- I do not know if I could.
- Might not give you a choice.

1061
01:31:42,276 --> 01:31:43,361
Do you recognize.

1062
01:31:44,477 --> 01:31:46,105
Will.

1063
01:31:47,572 --> 01:31:50,081
Ready, it's time.

1064
01:31:52,728 --> 01:31:54,153
- Come dressed as?
- No.

1065
01:31:54,173 --> 01:31:57,236
If you fight a war,
must dress uniform.

1066
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:09,974
Fuck!
This time I really fires!

1067
01:32:34,197 --> 01:32:35,923
We're in the final stage of launch. </ I>

1068
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:37,812
INSIGHT PROJECT LAUNCH

1069
01:32:38,023 --> 01:32:39,892
Be the route.

1070
01:32:41,415 --> 01:32:44,008
I launch by station staff. </ I>

1071
01:32:44,753 --> 01:32:47,152
- How was your flight?
- Great.

1072
01:32:47,166 --> 01:32:49,141
Less airport road

1073
01:32:49,341 --> 01:32:52,059
Unfortunately
SHIELD can not control everything.

1074
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:53,945
Including Captain America.

1075
01:32:57,652 --> 01:33:03,469
E controalată biometric structure.
These will provide unlimited access.

1076
01:33:08,735 --> 01:33:11,647
- Where were they?
- I think in Afghanistan.

1077
01:33:11,847 --> 01:33:13,992
Negative DTS. The route is complete.

1078
01:33:14,192 --> 01:33:15,511
You might say something.

1079
01:33:16,744 --> 01:33:18,879
Probably dish.

1080
01:33:20,001 --> 01:33:21,791
I'm going to control it.

1081
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:25,415
I order a clearance to launch. </ I>

1082
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,211
WWW.SUBTITRARI.PROScuzaţi.

1083
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:36,651
I know that the road was not only smoother
and that someone would have gladly thrown.

1084
01:33:38,663 --> 01:33:42,379
Finally we are here, and
humanity we should be grateful.

1085
01:33:43,269 --> 01:33:46,357
I note, SHIELD agents,
is Steve Rogers. </ I>

1086
01:33:48,629 --> 01:33:51,360
You heard me
these days. </ I>

1087
01:33:51,994 --> 01:33:54,501
I have and ordered me to grasp. </ I>

1088
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:57,464
But the time has come to know the truth .

1089
01:34:00,702 --> 01:34:05,863
SHIELD's not what I thought, unfortunately.
Was swallowed by HYDRA.

1090
01:34:05,881 --> 01:34:08,910
I Alexander Pierce is their leader. </ I>

1091
01:34:11,371 --> 01:34:14,617
I teams STRIKE and Insight are the HYDRA. </ I>

1092
01:34:14,688 --> 01:34:18,531
not yet know how, but
is in this building .

1093
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:21,666
I could be right next to you. </ I>

1094
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:27,759
I'm close to their goal:
absolute control. </ I>

1095
01:34:28,082 --> 01:34:31,795
They shot the Nick Fury and not
will stop here.

1096
01:34:32,181 --> 01:34:36,694
If you are launching today that shipment,
HYDRA will kill anyone who is against...

1097
01:34:40,114 --> 01:34:41,962
unless you stop them. </ I>

1098
01:34:45,281 --> 01:34:46,672
I know I'm asking a lot, but... </ i>

1099
01:34:48,443 --> 01:34:51,744
I price of freedom is high, always
been. </ i>

1100
01:34:52,051 --> 01:34:54,516
And it's a price that
I am willing to pay.

1101
01:34:56,484 --> 01:34:58,903
And if you have one,
then so be it.

1102
01:35:00,789 --> 01:35:02,848
But I bet I will not.

1103
01:35:07,318 --> 01:35:11,096
Speech you wrote before, was
or moment?

1104
01:35:11,296 --> 01:35:14,071
Megalomaniac bastard!

1105
01:35:17,168 --> 01:35:19,196
Arrest him!

1106
01:35:21,029 --> 01:35:22,830
It seems that the stage is mine.

1107
01:35:29,454 --> 01:35:32,318
Proceed launch sequence.
Launches those ships above.

1108
01:35:36,747 --> 01:35:38,243
Problems?

1109
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:45,837
- Is there a problem?
- Excuse me, sir.

1110
01:35:54,288 --> 01:35:56,410
I will not launch ships.

1111
01:35:59,197 --> 01:36:02,699
- Order of the Captain.
- Get out!

1112
01:36:02,738 --> 01:36:03,772
E as he said!

1113
01:36:03,777 --> 01:36:05,576
- I do!
- Drop your weapons!

1114
01:36:06,404 --> 01:36:08,441
Orders  Captain.

1115
01:36:09,633 --> 01:36:11,810
You picked the wrong agento!

1116
01:36:12,704 --> 01:36:14,541
It depends on your point of view.

1117
01:36:43,451 --> 01:36:44,451
Override

1118
01:36:59,009 --> 01:37:03,455
Now close the big door!

1119
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:22,843
TRANSMISSION MONITORING

1120
01:37:23,074 --> 01:37:25,068
They started launching.

1121
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:46,943
Captain, how distinguish the good from the bad?

1122
01:37:46,975 --> 01:37:48,781
If you shoot at us, are bad guys.

1123
01:38:23,121 --> 01:38:25,443
Captain,
I found that saying bad boys!

1124
01:38:25,463 --> 01:38:26,524
Are you okay?

1125
01:38:28,926 --> 01:38:30,144
I have not died!

1126
01:38:37,124 --> 01:38:38,665
I want to ask you a question.

1127
01:38:40,821 --> 01:38:44,116
If tomorrow would turn Pakistan to Mumbai

1128
01:38:45,224 --> 01:38:51,812
and know that they will drag you into a stadium
daughters to run them,

1129
01:38:53,208 --> 01:38:57,803
and you can stop it by pressing a button, you have
do it?

1130
01:38:57,948 --> 01:38:59,582
Everyone!

1131
01:39:01,464 --> 01:39:03,797
No, if your switch.

1132
01:39:27,608 --> 01:39:29,442
I apologize.

1133
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:37,364
I somehow ruined the scene?

1134
01:39:38,374 --> 01:39:40,880
Satellites in position less than a mile away.

1135
01:39:41,457 --> 01:39:44,254
- Falcon state?
- Busy.

1136
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,095
Well, Captain, I came.

1137
01:40:12,025 --> 01:40:13,063
Shit!

1138
01:40:27,128 --> 01:40:29,234
- Eight minutes, Captain!
- I do.

1139
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:37,048
OFF

1140
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:40,342
- How are you?
- Disable security protocols

1141
01:40:40,362 --> 01:40:43,617
- and download secrets on the Internet.
- Including the Hydra.

1142
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:44,742
And SHIELD's.

1143
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,410
If you do, your past will be known
.

1144
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:55,888
Are you sure you have
show the world who you really are?

1145
01:40:56,174 --> 01:40:57,635
But you?

1146
01:41:13,977 --> 01:41:14,981
Alfa is intercepted.

1147
01:41:16,926 --> 01:41:20,167
- Falcon, where are you?
- I made a detour.

1148
01:41:52,723 --> 01:41:53,747
Yes!

1149
01:41:59,749 --> 01:42:01,250
I entered.

1150
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:06,125
Bravo  hunt!

1151
01:42:07,843 --> 01:42:09,888
Two went,
longer one.

1152
01:42:11,445 --> 01:42:13,597
SHIELD All pilots take off!

1153
01:42:13,637 --> 01:42:16,803
We are the only air support available to Captain Rogers.

1154
01:42:57,616 --> 01:42:58,701
Restricted

1155
01:42:58,846 --> 01:43:03,722
Disabling Encryption keeps driving.
It takes two members of the alpha level.

1156
01:43:03,735 --> 01:43:06,402
Do not worry,
waiting guests.

1157
01:43:29,118 --> 01:43:31,144
Did you get my flowers?

1158
01:43:32,967 --> 01:43:35,607
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

1159
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:40,473
- I thought you wanted me dead.
- You know how the game works.

1160
01:43:41,133 --> 01:43:44,869
- Why did you put in charge of SHIELD?
- Because you were the best.

1161
01:43:44,878 --> 01:43:48,892
- Were the most ruthless.
- I did everything to protect people.

1162
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:54,860
Our enemies are yours, Nick.
Chaos, wars...

1163
01:43:55,098 --> 01:43:58,546
Soon
radiological weapon will destroy Moscow

1164
01:43:58,746 --> 01:44:01,706
and an electromagnetic pulse bomb will hot
Chicago.

1165
01:44:01,739 --> 01:44:06,168
Diplomacy?
Is a delay, a palliative.

1166
01:44:06,539 --> 01:44:10,365
You know where I learned that?
At Bogota.

1167
01:44:11,243 --> 01:44:14,572
Do not ask, but just followed.

1168
01:44:14,963 --> 01:44:20,306
Can bring order into the lives of seven billion people

1169
01:44:20,332 --> 01:44:22,398
sacrificing 20 million.

1170
01:44:23,473 --> 01:44:27,078
Is the next step, Nick,
if you have the courage to do it.

1171
01:44:27,098 --> 01:44:29,444
No! I have not the courage to do it.

What are you doing?
Do not think you're approved!

1174
01:44:39,851 --> 01:44:44,413
I know that I've deleted the password,
probably my retina scan,

1175
01:44:44,414 --> 01:44:47,673
but if you want to be one step
before me, Mr. Secretary...

1176
01:44:50,779 --> 01:44:54,929
Have to keep both eyes well open.

Swear to tell the truth and only the truth.

1270
02:00:32,931 --> 02:00:34,157
Swear.

1271
02:00:36,266 --> 02:00:39,147
Why we do not hear from Captain Rogers?

1272
02:00:40,384 --> 02:00:42,143
Do not know what would be left to say.

1273

I think
waste on the river bottom were successful mission.

1274
02:00:46,095 --> 02:00:47,635
Can you explain how should

1275
02:00:47,655 --> 02:00:50,274
as this country to preserve national security now

1276
02:00:50,294 --> 02:00:54,389
when both he and we have destroyed
your security system?

1277
02:00:54,409 --> 02:00:56,656
HYDRA selling you lies,
no information.

1278
02:00:56,676 --> 02:01:02,032
- Many of them have contributed.
- There are people in this committee

1279
02:01:02,052 --> 02:01:04,497
who believe,
service as your status

1280
02:01:04,517 --> 02:01:09,493
Favorable  not for this country,
I should stay in prison.

1281
02:01:09,714 --> 02:01:12,004
Shield us your comments irrelevant.

1282
02:01:13,643 --> 02:01:15,574
I will not close.

1283
02:01:15,996 --> 02:01:18,836
We will close any of us.

1284
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:20,847
Do you know why?

1285
02:01:21,673 --> 02:01:25,032
- Illuminate us!
- Because you need us.

1286
02:01:25,606 --> 02:01:30,383
Fair, the world's vulnerable spot
and indeed we do so,

1287
02:01:31,008 --> 02:01:34,279
but we are the most skilled
defend it.

1288
02:01:35,231 --> 02:01:37,792
So if you want to arrest me,
do it.

1289
02:01:38,225 --> 02:01:40,147
Do you know where to find me.

1290
02:02:15,433 --> 02:02:18,832
So
and you had such an experience.

1291
02:02:19,052 --> 02:02:20,628
Eventually you get used to.

1292
02:02:22,747 --> 02:02:25,164
I searched the archives  Hydra.

1293
02:02:25,416 --> 02:02:28,286
Bastan It seems that many were not down with the ship.

1294
02:02:29,147 --> 02:02:33,212
I'm going to Europe tonight.
I wanted to ask you to come with me.

1295
02:02:33,954 --> 02:02:36,135
I have something to do first.

1296
02:02:36,365 --> 02:02:39,529
And you, Wilson?
I need someone like you.

1297
02:02:39,892 --> 02:02:42,306
I am more of a soldier than a spy.

1298
02:02:42,791 --> 02:02:44,043
Okay.

1299
02:02:49,127 --> 02:02:53,588
If someone asks me,
tell him that I can find here below.

1300
02:02:54,820 --> 02:02:58,240
You should feel honored.
So thank him.

1301
02:02:59,643 --> 02:03:02,323
- Do you go with him?
- No.

1302
02:03:02,343 --> 02:03:04,447
- Stay here?
- No.

1303
02:03:05,062 --> 02:03:08,079
I revealed their identities
I have to find another cover.

1304
02:03:08,099 --> 02:03:10,916
- Could be a bit much.
- I hope.

1305
02:03:13,428 --> 02:03:17,392
Here's what you asked.
We made each other favors.

1306
02:03:19,830 --> 02:03:23,278
do you a favor now?
A nurse call?

1307
02:03:23,298 --> 02:03:26,832
- There's a nurse?
- And you're not a SHIELD agent.

1308
02:03:27,362 --> 02:03:29,839
- What did you say her name?
- Sharon.

1309
02:03:30,495 --> 02:03:32,271
's Nice.

1310
02:03:43,725 --> 02:03:45,471
Be careful, Steve!

1311
02:03:46,329 --> 02:03:48,559
Maybe it would be better to stop here.

1312
02:03:59,495 --> 02:04:02,894
- I go after him?
- No need to come with me.

1313
02:04:02,914 --> 02:04:04,412
I know.

1314
02:04:06,001 --> 02:04:07,419
When do we start?
