1
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,634
That's nice.
Thank you.

2
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:50,372
Thanks very much,
I appreciate it.

3
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,102
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:57,236
Thank you all.

5
00:00:57,312 --> 00:00:58,607
Thank you.

6
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:00,143
I appreciate that.

7
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,177
Thank you.

8
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:02,505
Thank you.

9
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:04,567
So let me ask
you something.

10
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:06,542
Let me ask you how's
everybody doing tonight

11
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,439
huh?

12
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:13,140
Good.

13
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,334
Well fuck you.

14
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,967
Just trying to make
you feel at home.

15
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:23,010
Now listen, I've been
out here all this time

16
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:24,509
and I haven't
been complaining

17
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:25,838
about anything yet

18
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,707
so I think it's time

19
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:29,608
to go into the
complaint department.

20
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:31,903
This is just a
series of things

21
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:35,034
that are pissing
me off okay?

22
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,599
A series of things that
are pissing me off

23
00:01:37,676 --> 00:01:39,666
cause I don't
have pet peeves

24
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:44,801
I have major psychotic
fucking hatreds okay?

25
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:47,308
And it makes the world a
lot easier to sort out.

26
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:49,699
First thing on
my list tonight,

27
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,366
airport security.

28
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:52,567
Tired of this shit.

29
00:01:52,642 --> 00:01:53,869
There's too much of it.

30
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:56,068
There's too much
security at the airport.

31
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:58,768
I'm tired of some guy
with a double digit IQ

32
00:01:58,843 --> 00:02:00,433
and a triple digit income

33
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,135
rooting around inside
of my bag for no reason

34
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,334
and never
finding anything.

35
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,842
Haven't found
anything yet.

36
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:09,841
Haven't found one
bomb in one bag

37
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:10,898
and don't tell me,

38
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:12,202
Well the
terrorist know

39
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,674
there bags are
going to be searched

40
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:15,230
so now they're leaving
their bombs at home.

41
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:16,798
There are no bombs.

42
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:19,966
The whole thing is
fucking pointless

43
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:22,768
and it's completely
without logic.

44
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,103
There's no logic at all.

45
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:26,572
They'll take away gun
but let you keep a knife.

46
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,972
Well what the
fuck is that?

47
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:32,099
In fact there's a whole
list of lethal objects

48
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:34,333
they will allow you
to take on board.

49
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:36,500
Theoretically you
could take a knife,

50
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:37,938
an ice pick,
a hatchet,

51
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:39,269
a straight razor,
a pair of scissors,

52
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:40,740
a chainsaw, six
knitting needles

53
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,365
and a broken
whiskey bottle

54
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:44,069
and the only thing they're
going to say to you

55
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:45,606
is that bag has to fit

56
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:48,903
all the way under the
seat in front of you.

57
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:52,633
And if you didn't take
a weapon on board relax,

58
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,435
after you been flying
for about an hour

59
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,200
they're going to bring
you a knife and fork.

60
00:02:58,274 --> 00:03:01,673
They actually give
you a fucking knife.

61
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:03,231
It's only a table knife

62
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:06,329
but you could kill a
pilot with a table knife.

63
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:09,169
Might take you a couple
of minutes you know,

64
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:11,728
especially if
he's hefty huh?

65
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:13,865
Yeah but you could
get the job done

66
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,839
if you really wanted
to kill the prick.

67
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:18,602
Shit there's a lot of
things you could use

68
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:19,970
to kill a guy with.

69
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,766
You could probably beat
a guy to death with the

70
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,602
Sunday New York
Times couldn't you?

71
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:28,333
Or suppose you just
had really big hands

72
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,464
couldn't you strangle
a flight attendant?

73
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,200
Shit you could probably
strangle two of them,

74
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:33,830
one with each hand.

75
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:35,600
You know if you are lucky
enough to catch them

76
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,639
in that little
kitchen area

77
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:40,501
before they give out the
fucking peanuts you know?

78
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:42,471
But you could
get the job done

79
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,199
if you really
cared enough.

80
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:47,206
So why is it
they allow a man

81
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:48,704
with big powerful hands

82
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:50,864
to get on board
an airplane?

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,235
I'll tell you why.

84
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,170
They know he's not
a security risk

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,704
because he's
already answered

86
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:58,931
the three big
questions.

87
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,437
Question number one:

88
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:03,370
Did you pack your
bags yourself?

89
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,331
No Carrot Top
packed my bags.

90
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:15,463
He and Martha Stewart
and Florence Henderson

91
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,629
came over to the
house last night,

92
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,934
fixed me a lovely
lobster Newburgh,

93
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,766
gave me a full
body massage

94
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:23,702
with sacred oils
from India,

95
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:25,794
performed a four
way around the world

96
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:28,632
and then they
packed my bags.

97
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:31,172
Next question:

98
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:38,597
Have your bags

99
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:40,797
been in your possession
the whole time?

100
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:42,700
No.

101
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:44,670
Usually the night
before I travel,

102
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:47,499
just as the
moon is rising,

103
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:49,469
I place my suitcases
out on the street corner

104
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:50,628
and leave them there

105
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:53,433
unattended for
several hours.

106
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:56,299
Just for good luck.

107
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:59,098
Next question:

108
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,728
Has any
unknown person

109
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:03,293
asked you to take
anything on board?

110
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,201
Hmm,

111
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,670
but what exactly is
an unknown person?

112
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:12,001
Surely everyone is
known to someone.

113
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:13,695
In fact, just
this morning

114
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:17,793
Kareem and Ucef
Allibamgaba

115
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,358
seemed to know each
other quite well.

116
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:21,836
They kept joking about

117
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:25,301
which one of my suitcases
was the heaviest.

118
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,835
And that's another thing they
don't like at the airport,

119
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:29,598
jokes you know?

120
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:32,260
Yeah you can't
joke about a bomb.

121
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:33,996
Well why is it just jokes?

122
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:37,559
What about a riddle?

123
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,602
How about a limerick?

124
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,533
How about a
bomb anecdote?

125
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:46,728
You know no punch line
just a really cute story.

126
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,794
Or suppose you
intended the remark

127
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:51,733
not as a joke but
as an ironic musing.

128
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,736
Are they prepared to
make that distinction?

129
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:56,598
Why I think not.

130
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:59,134
And besides who's
to say what's funny.

131
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:01,327
Airport security
is a stupid idea,

132
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,803
it's a waste of money

133
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:04,427
and it's only there
for one reason,

134
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:07,298
to make white
people feel safe.

135
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,630
That's all, the illusion,

136
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,634
the feeling and
illusion of safety

137
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:13,999
cause the
authorities know

138
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,001
they can't make an
airplane completely safe.

139
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:17,831
Too many people
have access.

140
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:19,390
You'll notice the
drug smugglers

141
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:20,832
don't seem to have
a lot of trouble

142
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:23,199
getting there little
packages on board do they?

143
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,893
No and God bless them too.

144
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:33,758
Oh and by the way

145
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:36,733
an airplane flight shouldn't
be completely safe.

146
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,791
You need a little
danger in your life.

147
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:41,856
Take a fucking chance
once in a while will you?

148
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,094
What are you going to do

149
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,133
play with your prick for
another thirty years?

150
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,792
What are you going to
read People Magazine

151
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:51,028
and eat at Wendy's
till the end of time?

152
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:52,726
Take a fucking chance.

153
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,461
Besides even if
they made

154
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:56,466
all of the airplanes
completely safe

155
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:57,898
the terrorist
would simply

156
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,400
start bombing other
places that are crowded.

157
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:01,195
Porn shops,

158
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,030
crack houses,

159
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,125
titty bars

160
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:05,598
and gangbangs you know?

161
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:08,065
Entertainment venues.

162
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:10,100
The odds of you being
killed by a terrorist

163
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,634
are practically zero.

164
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:15,496
So I say relax and
enjoy the show.

165
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:16,896
You have to be a realist.

166
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:19,057
You have to be realistic
about terrorism.

167
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,396
Certain groups of
people, certain groups,

168
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:22,625
Muslim Fundamentalist,

169
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:23,825
Christian
Fundamentalist,

170
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,263
Jewish Fundamentalist

171
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:29,390
and just plain
guys from Montana

172
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,399
are going to continue to
make life in this country

173
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:34,626
very interesting for
a long, long time.

174
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,031
That's the reality.

175
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:37,895
Angry men in
combat fatigues

176
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:40,195
talking to God on
a two-way radio

177
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,824
and mothering incoherent
slogans about freedom

178
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,332
are eventually
going to provide us

179
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,195
with a great deal
of entertainment.

180
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,959
Especially after your
stupid, fucking economy

181
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:52,430
collapses all around you

182
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:54,124
and the terrorist come
out of the woodwork

183
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,391
and you'll have anthrax

184
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:56,727
in your water supply

185
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,164
and serine gas in
your air conditioners.

186
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:59,561
They'll be chemical
and biological

187
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:01,121
suitcase bombs
in every city

188
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,459
and I say enjoy it,

189
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:03,930
relax. Enjoy the show.

190
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,295
Take a fucking chance.

191
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:06,763
Put a little fun
in your life.

192
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:08,594
To me terrorism
is exciting.

193
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,859
It's exciting.

194
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,898
I think the very
idea that you can

195
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,489
set off a bomb
in a marketplace

196
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,997
and kill several
hundred people

197
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,431
is exciting and
stimulating

198
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,589
and I see it as a
form of entertainment.

199
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,223
Entertainment
that's all it is.

200
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:25,495
Yeah.

201
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:29,720
But... but I also know
that most Americans

202
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:32,263
are soft and frightened
and unimaginative

203
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,991
and they don't realize
there's such a thing

204
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,862
as dangerous fun

205
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,419
and they certainly
don't recognize

206
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:39,087
a good show when
they see one.

207
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:40,653
I have always
been willing

208
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,425
to put myself at
great personal risk

209
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,087
for the sake of
entertainment.

210
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:45,688
And I've always been
willing to put you

211
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:48,026
at great personal risk
for the same reason.

212
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:49,496
As far as I'm concerned

213
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,031
all of this
airport security,

214
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:52,724
all the searches,
the screenings,

215
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,197
the cameras, the questions

216
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,593
it's just one more way

217
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:57,995
of reducing your liberty
and reminding you

218
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:01,497
that they can fuck with
you anytime they want

219
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:03,588
as long as you
put up with it.

220
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:05,426
As long as you
put up with it,

221
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:08,292
which means of course
anytime they want

222
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,886
cause that's what
Americans do now.

223
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,590
Their always willing
to trade away

224
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:13,185
a little of their freedom

225
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:14,627
in exchange for
the feeling,

226
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:16,992
the illusion of security.

227
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:18,257
What we have now

228
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,795
is a completely
neurotic population

229
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:23,421
obsessed with
security and safety

230
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,519
and crime and drugs
and cleanliness

231
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:27,427
and hygiene and germs.

232
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,989
There's another
thing, germs.

233
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:31,961
Where did this
sudden fear of germs

234
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,655
come from in this country?

235
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,196
Had you noticed this,

236
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,729
the media constantly
running stories

237
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:38,353
about all the
latest infections,

238
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,794
salmonella, ecoli,
hanka virus, bird flu

239
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:43,953
and Americans
panic easily

240
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:45,461
so now everybody's
running around

241
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,052
scrubbing this
and spraying that

242
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,323
and overcooking
their food

243
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:49,761
and repeatedly
washing their hands

244
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:52,489
trying to avoid all
contact with germs.

245
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:53,891
It's ridiculous

246
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,929
and it goes to
ridiculous lengths.

247
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:57,155
In prisons

248
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,127
before they give you
a lethal injection

249
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:03,390
they swab your
arm with alcohol.

250
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:05,020
It's true.

251
00:10:05,097 --> 00:10:07,824
It's true.

252
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:09,622
It's true.

253
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:15,426
Well they don't want
you to get an infection

254
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:16,722
and you can see
their point.

255
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:18,421
Wouldn't want some
guy to go to hell

256
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,654
and be sick.

257
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:22,388
Would take a lot of
the sportsmanship

258
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,394
out of the whole
execution.

259
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:29,156
Fear of, germs why
these fucking pussies.

260
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,853
You can't even get a
decent hamburger anymore.

261
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:33,451
They kick the shit
out of everything now

262
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,188
cause everybody's afraid
of food poisoning.

263
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:37,853
Hey where's your
sense of adventure?

264
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,985
Take a fucking
chance will ya?

265
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:41,290
Do you know how
many people

266
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:43,692
die in this country from
food poisoning every year?

267
00:10:43,762 --> 00:10:45,319
Nine thousand,
that's all,

268
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:48,623
it's a minor risk.

269
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:53,457
Take a fucking chance
bunch Goddamn pussies.

270
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,118
Besides what do you think

271
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,126
you have an
immune system for?

272
00:10:57,194 --> 00:11:00,455
It's for killing germs
but it needs practice.

273
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,256
It needs germs
to practice on

274
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:07,020
so... so listen.

275
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,851
So listen.

276
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:12,085
If you kill all the
germs around you

277
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,025
and live a completely
sterile life

278
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:15,423
then when germs
do come along

279
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:17,050
you're not going
to be prepared.

280
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:18,650
And never mind
ordinary germs

281
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:20,091
what are you going to do

282
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,594
when some super
virus comes along

283
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:23,057
that turns your
vital organs

284
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:25,093
into liquid shit?

285
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:26,320
I'll tell you what
you're going to do,

286
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,382
you're going to sick,

287
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,449
you're going to die

288
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:29,584
and you're going
to deserve it

289
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,853
cause you're
fucking weak

290
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:32,483
and you got a fucking
weak immune system.

291
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,287
Now.

292
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,154
Goddamn it.

293
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,318
Hey.

294
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:41,119
All right.

295
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:42,783
Let me you tell
you a true story

296
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:44,551
about immunization okay?

297
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,422
When I was a little
boy in New York City

298
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:49,617
in the 1940's we swam
in the Hudson River

299
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:52,921
and it was filled
with raw sewage okay?

300
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:55,926
We swam in raw
sewage you know,

301
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:58,586
to cool off

302
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:00,886
and at that time the
big fear was polio.

303
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,221
Thousands of kids died
from polio every year

304
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:04,350
but you know something?

305
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,392
In my neighborhood no
one ever got polio,

306
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,755
no one, ever.

307
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:08,950
You know why?

308
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:11,889
Cause we swam
in raw sewage.

309
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,321
It strengthened
our immune systems.

310
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:15,915
The polio never
had a prayer.

311
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:21,685
We were tempered
in raw shit.

312
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:23,554
So... so personally
I never take

313
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,716
any special precautions
against germs.

314
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,088
I don't shy
away from people

315
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,489
who sneeze and cough.

316
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,819
I don't wipe off
the telephone.

317
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,256
I don't cover
the toilet seat

318
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:32,655
and if I drop
food on the floor

319
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:34,658
I pick it
up and eat it.

320
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:36,553
I eat it.

321
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:39,683
Yes I do.

322
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,690
Even if I'm at
a sidewalk café

323
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:44,986
in Calcutta,

324
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,888
the poor section

325
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,753
on New Years morning
during a soccer riot.

326
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:52,484
And you know something
in spite of all that

327
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:53,990
so called risky behavior

328
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,216
I never get infections.

329
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,256
I don't get them.

330
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:57,255
I don't get colds.

331
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:58,254
I don't get flu.

332
00:12:58,323 --> 00:12:59,220
I don't get headaches.

333
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,348
I don't get upset stomach.

334
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:01,584
And you know why?

335
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:02,952
Cause I got a good
strong immune system

336
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,320
and it gets a
lot of practice.

337
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:05,823
My immune system
is equipped

338
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:07,356
with the biologically
equivalent

339
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,584
of fully automatic
military assault rifles

340
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:12,124
with night vision
and laser scopes

341
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,416
and we have
recently acquired

342
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,581
phosphorus grenades,
cluster bombs

343
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:18,589
and anti-personnel
fragmentation mines.

344
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:21,589
So when my white blood
cells are on patrol

345
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:23,122
Keeping order in
my bloodstream

346
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,088
seeking out strangers
and other undesirables,

347
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:26,555
if they see any,

348
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:28,384
any suspicious looking
germs of any kind

349
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:30,855
they don't fuck around.

350
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:32,353
They whip out the weapons,

351
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:33,684
they wax the motherfucker

352
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:35,085
and deposit the
unlucky fellow

353
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:38,146
directly into my colon.

354
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:40,518
Into my colon,
there's no nonsense.

355
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:41,817
There's no
Miranda warning.

356
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:43,048
There's none of that

357
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,554
three strikes and
your out shit.

358
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:49,613
First offense bam
into the colon you go.

359
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:50,882
Yeah.

360
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,149
Good.

361
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,246
Yeah.

362
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:56,152
All right.

363
00:13:56,223 --> 00:14:01,519
Oh, and speaking
of my colon

364
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:02,755
I want you to know

365
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,414
I don't automatically
wash my hands

366
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:06,978
every time I go to
the bathroom okay?

367
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:09,919
Can you deal with that?

368
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:12,419
Sometimes I do,
sometimes I don't.

369
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:13,852
You know when
I was my hands?

370
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:17,251
When I shit on them.

371
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:19,379
That's the only time.

372
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:20,478
That's the only...

373
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:21,782
and you know how
often that happens?

374
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:25,686
Tops... tops two, three
times a week, tops.

375
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:26,847
Tops.

376
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:28,318
Maybe a little
more frequently

377
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:31,116
over the holidays,
you know what I mean?

378
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:32,779
And I'll tell you
something else

379
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:34,945
my well-scrubbed
friends.

380
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:36,987
You don't always need
a shower everyday.

381
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,113
Did you know that?

382
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:39,347
It's overkill.

383
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:41,081
Unless you work out
or work outdoors

384
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:43,280
or for some reason come
in intimate contact

385
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:44,719
with huge
amounts of filth

386
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:46,253
and garbage everyday

387
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,786
you don't always
need a shower.

388
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,149
All you really need to do

389
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,119
is to wash the
four key areas,

390
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:55,621
armpits, asshole,
crotch and teeth.

391
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:56,620
Got that?

392
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:59,849
Armpits, asshole,
crotch and teeth.

393
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:01,750
In fact you can
save yourself

394
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:02,981
a whole lot of time

395
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:04,815
if you simply use
the same brush

396
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:08,048
on all four areas.

397
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:11,143
Thank you.

398
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:16,250
Thank you.

399
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:18,714
I appreciate
it. Thank you.

400
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,179
All right.

401
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,219
Listen I got a
few more items

402
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:25,253
of things that are
pissing me off

403
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,286
and this one comes in
the form of a question.

404
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:29,718
Haven't we had
about enough

405
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:32,811
of this cigar smoking
shit in this country?

406
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:33,943
Huh?

407
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,418
Huh?

408
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,281
When is this going to end?

409
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,082
When is this shit
going to go away?

410
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:42,311
When are these fat,
arrogant, overpaid,

411
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:43,545
overfed, over privileged,

412
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,018
over indulged,
white collar,

413
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:49,314
business criminal,
asshole, cocksuckers

414
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,079
going to put
out their cigars

415
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:54,347
and move along to their
next abomination?

416
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,408
White pussy businessmen

417
00:15:56,485 --> 00:16:00,541
sucking on a
big brown dick.

418
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,880
That's all it is.

419
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,315
That's all it is.

420
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:07,351
Yeah.

421
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:10,614
A big brown dick.

422
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:12,015
Sigmund Freud said,

423
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:14,076
"Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar."

424
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:19,516
Oh yeah, well sometimes
it's a big brown dick...

425
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,279
with a fat, arrogant,
white-collar

426
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:22,818
business
criminal, asshole

427
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:26,249
sucking on the
wet end of it.

428
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,910
But hey, the news is
not all bad for me,

429
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:30,315
not all bad,

430
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:31,645
you want to know
the good part?

431
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:33,308
Cancer of the mouth.

432
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:34,316
Good.

433
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:35,817
Fuck 'em.

434
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:37,043
Makes me happy.

435
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,344
It's an attractive
disease,

436
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:42,249
goes nice with
a cell phone.

437
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:43,409
So light up.

438
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:45,347
Suspend a man and
suck that smoke

439
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:47,180
deep down into
your empty suit

440
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:48,615
and blow it
out your ass

441
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:53,175
you fucking cocksucker.

442
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:54,445
Thank you.

443
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,813
Thank you.

444
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:58,613
Hey,

445
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,512
here's another question
I've been pondering.

446
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:06,016
What is all this
shit about angels?

447
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:07,243
Have you heard this?

448
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,907
Yeah, three out
of four people

449
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,314
now believe in angels.

450
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:15,645
What are you
fucking stupid?

451
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:17,648
Has everybody lost
their fucking mind

452
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:19,377
in this country?

453
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:20,542
Angels, shit.

454
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:21,707
You know what
I think it is?

455
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,614
I think it's a
massive collective

456
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:25,741
psychotic chemical
flashback

457
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:27,977
of all the drugs,

458
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,482
all the drugs,

459
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,177
smoked, swallowed,
snorted, shot

460
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:33,647
and absorbed rectally

461
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:37,081
by all Americans
from 1960 to 1990.

462
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,343
Thirty years of
adulterated street drugs

463
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:43,372
will get you some
fucking angels my friend.

464
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,676
Angels shit.

465
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:46,305
What about goblins huh?

466
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:48,315
Doesn't anybody
believe in goblins?

467
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:50,475
Never hear about them
except on Halloween

468
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:53,311
and its always negative
shit too you know?

469
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:58,007
And zombies, where the
fuck are all the zombies?

470
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,343
That's the trouble
with zombies,

471
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,075
they're unreliable.

472
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,048
I say if you're going
to buy the angels shit

473
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,309
you might as well go

474
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:07,281
for the zombie
package as well.

475
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:11,344
Here's another
horrifying example,

476
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,848
aspect of
American culture,

477
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,404
the pussification,

478
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:16,777
the continued,

479
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:18,973
the continued
pussification

480
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:21,242
of the American male

481
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:23,871
in the form...

482
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,242
yeah all right,

483
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:30,802
in the form of

484
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:34,178
Harley Davidson
theme restaurants.

485
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:37,272
What the fuck is
going on here?

486
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,212
Harley Davidson used
to mean something.

487
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:42,612
It stood for
biker attitude.

488
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:45,206
Grimy outlaws and
there sweaty mamas,

489
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:47,212
full of beer and crank

490
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,838
rolling around
on Harley's

491
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:50,608
looking for a good time

492
00:18:50,682 --> 00:18:51,739
destroying property,

493
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:56,247
raping teenagers and
killing policemen.

494
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:59,905
All very necessary
activities by the way

495
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:02,311
but now theme
restaurants

496
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:03,904
and this soft shit

497
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:06,003
obviously didn't come
from hardcore bikers.

498
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,602
It came from these
weekend motorcyclists.

499
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,840
These fraudulent,

500
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:11,403
two day a week
motherfuckers

501
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,911
who have their bikes

502
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,607
trucked into
Sturgis, South Dakota

503
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:16,873
for the big rally
and then ride around

504
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:18,914
like they just come
in off the road.

505
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,276
Dentist and bureaucrats

506
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,473
and pussy boy
software designers

507
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,637
getting up on a Harley

508
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:26,340
cause they think
it makes them cool.

509
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,880
Well hey Skeezits
you ain't cool,

510
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:31,435
you're fucking chilly.

511
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,412
And chilly ain't
never been cool.

512
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:36,177
And here as long
as were talking

513
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,473
about theme restaurants,

514
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:38,671
I got a proposition
for you,

515
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,645
I think if white people

516
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,974
are going to burn
down black churches

517
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:44,172
then black people

518
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:46,872
ought to burn down the
House Of Blues huh?

519
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:50,537
What a fucking disgrace
that place is,

520
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:51,807
the House Of Blues.

521
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,970
They ought to call it

522
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:56,275
the house of lame
white motherfuckers.

523
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:59,143
Inauthentic, low
frequency, single digit

524
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,143
lame white motherfuckers,

525
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:03,270
especially these
male movie stars

526
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:05,505
who think they're
blues artist.

527
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,703
You ever see these guys?

528
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,405
Don't you just want
to puke in your soup

529
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:10,445
when one of these fat,
balding, overweight,

530
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:11,876
over aged, out of shape,

531
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,342
middle-aged
male movie stars

532
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,843
with sunglasses
jumps on stage

533
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:16,811
and starts blowing
into a harmonica.

534
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,844
It's a fucking sacrilege.

535
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,310
In the first place,

536
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:22,638
in the first place,

537
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,178
white people
got no business

538
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:27,211
playing the blues
ever at all,

539
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:29,245
under any
circumstances.

540
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,142
Ever, ever, ever.

541
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,801
What the fuck
do white people

542
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:35,937
have to be blue about?

543
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:42,308
Banana Republic
ran out of khakis?

544
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:43,673
Huh?

545
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:47,074
The Espresso
machine is jammed.

546
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:51,042
Hootie and the Blowfish
are breaking up?

547
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,804
Shit white people
ought to understand

548
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,277
there job is to give
people the blues

549
00:20:55,343 --> 00:20:57,537
not to get them.

550
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:00,202
And certainly not to
sing or play them.

551
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:01,743
Tell you a little
secret about the blues;

552
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:03,935
it's not enough to know
which notes to play

553
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,805
you got to know why
they need to be played.

554
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:08,935
And another thing,
I don't think,

555
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:10,534
I don't think
white people

556
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:12,942
should be trying to
dance like blacks.

557
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:15,737
Stop that!

558
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,106
Stick to your faggoty
polkas and waltzes.

559
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:21,904
And that repulsive

560
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:25,102
country line dancing
shit that you do

561
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:26,472
and be yourself.

562
00:21:26,543 --> 00:21:28,031
Be proud, be
white, be lame

563
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:30,736
and get the fuck
off the dance floor.

564
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:36,305
Now.

565
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,637
I thank you.

566
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,073
Now listen,

567
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:43,576
long as were
discussing minorities

568
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,575
I'd like to mention
something about language.

569
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:46,974
There are a
couple of terms

570
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:48,532
being used a
lot these days

571
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,167
by guilty
white liberals.

572
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:51,173
First one is,

573
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:52,833
happens to be.

574
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,535
He happens to be black.

575
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,701
I have a friend

576
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:57,833
who happens to be black.

577
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:01,706
Like it's a fucking
accident you know?

578
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:02,901
Happens to be black?

579
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:04,134
Yes he happens
to be black.

580
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,265
Awe yeah, yeah, yeah.

581
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:07,502
He had two black parents?

582
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,008
Oh yes, yes he did.

583
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,665
Yes.

584
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:11,673
And they fucked?

585
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:13,400
Oh indeed they did.

586
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:14,532
Indeed.

587
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:17,904
So where does the
surprise part come in?

588
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:19,442
I should think it
would be more unusual

589
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,998
if he just happened
to be Scandinavian.

590
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:27,372
And the other
term is openly.

591
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:28,532
Openly gay.

592
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,802
They'll say,
he's openly gay.

593
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:32,432
But this... that's
the only minority

594
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:33,702
they use that for.

595
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:34,832
You know you wouldn't say

596
00:22:34,908 --> 00:22:37,339
someone was openly black.

597
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:40,533
Well maybe James Brown

598
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:42,233
or Lewis Farrakhan.

599
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:45,297
Lewis Farrakhan
is openly black.

600
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,363
Colin Powell is
not openly black.

601
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:51,532
Colin Powell is
openly white,

602
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:55,005
he just happens
to be black.

603
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,405
Okay.

604
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,700
Thank you.

605
00:22:57,774 --> 00:22:58,899
Thank you.

606
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:01,308
Yeah.

607
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,068
Oh thank you.

608
00:23:03,142 --> 00:23:04,901
Thank you.

609
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:06,132
And while were at it

610
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:07,537
when did the word urban

611
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:10,165
become synonymous
with the word black?

612
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:12,729
Did I fall asleep for
eight or nine years?

613
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,239
Urban styles, urban
trends, urban music,

614
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,034
I was not consulted
on this at all.

615
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:18,834
Didn't get an email,
didn't a fax,

616
00:23:18,906 --> 00:23:21,237
didn't get a fucking
postcard, fine!

617
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:22,330
Let them go.

618
00:23:22,408 --> 00:23:23,736
And I don't
think white women

619
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:26,863
should be calling each
other girlfriend okay?

620
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,770
Stop pretending
to be black.

621
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,236
And no matter
what color you are

622
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:32,602
"you go girl"

623
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:36,299
should probably go...

624
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,861
right along,

625
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,668
right along with
"you the man."

626
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:41,931
Hey you the man.

627
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:42,699
Oh yeah?

628
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:46,967
Well you the
fucking honkey.

629
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:51,196
Now something a little
more positive for you.

630
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:52,432
Don't want you to think

631
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:53,904
the whole show is
just negativity.

632
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:55,563
This is about a festival.

633
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:57,366
This is my idea
for one of those

634
00:23:57,439 --> 00:24:00,032
big outdoor
summer festivals.

635
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,333
This is called Slugfest.

636
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:04,200
This is for men only.

637
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:05,363
Here's what you do,

638
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,962
you get about a
hundred thousand

639
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,527
of these fucking men,

640
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:09,765
you know the ones I mean,

641
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,202
these macho
motherfuckers.

642
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:15,364
Yeah, these strutting,
preening, posturing,

643
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,892
hairy, sweaty, alpha
male jack offs.

644
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,801
The muscle assholes.

645
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:22,566
You take about a
hundred thousand

646
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:24,366
of these
disgusting pricks

647
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:26,199
and you throw them
in a big dirt arena,

648
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:28,328
big twenty-five
acre dirt arena,

649
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:29,736
and you just let them

650
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:31,430
beat the shit
out of each other

651
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:33,368
for twenty-four
hours nonstop,

652
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:34,631
no food, no water

653
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:38,830
just whiskey and PCP.

654
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:41,631
And you just let them
punch and pound and kick

655
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:43,194
the shit out of
each other until

656
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:44,531
only one guy is
left standing

657
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:45,661
then you
take that guy

658
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:46,829
and you put him
on a pedestal

659
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:50,462
and you shoot him
the fucking head.

660
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:52,266
Yeah.

661
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:55,169
Yeah.

662
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:57,567
Then you put the
whole thing on TV.

663
00:24:57,637 --> 00:24:59,036
Budweiser would
jump at that shit

664
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:00,627
in half a minute.

665
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:01,863
And guys would volunteer.

666
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:02,994
Guys would line up

667
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,128
all you got to do

668
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:06,227
is promise them a small
appliance of some kind.

669
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,894
Men will do anything
just give them something

670
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,027
that plugs in the wall

671
00:25:09,103 --> 00:25:12,229
makes a whirring noise.

672
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,824
Here's another
male cliché,

673
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:16,369
these guys who
cut the sleeves

674
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:17,527
off of their T-shirts

675
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,160
so the rest of us can have

676
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:20,726
an even more
compelling experience

677
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:23,565
of smelling
their armpits.

678
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:27,160
I say, hey Bruno shut it
down would you please?

679
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:31,000
You smell like an
anchovy's cunt okay?

680
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,196
Yeah.

681
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:34,735
Not good.

682
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,429
Not good Bruno

683
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:43,958
and definitely
not for sharing.

684
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:45,400
This is the same
kind of guy

685
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:47,128
that has that
barbed wire tattoo

686
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:49,260
that goes all the way
around the bicep.

687
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:50,701
You've seen that
haven't you?

688
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:52,462
That's just what
I need some guy

689
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:55,228
who hasn't been laid
since the bicentennial

690
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:58,961
wants me to think he's
a bad motherfucker

691
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:01,526
because he's got
a picture ahha,

692
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:04,125
a painting of some
barbed-wire on his...

693
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:05,669
I say hey junior
come around

694
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:07,065
when you have the
real thing on there

695
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:07,795
I'll squeeze that shit on

696
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,800
good and tight
for you okay?

697
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,129
No kidding.

698
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:12,361
No kidding.

699
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:13,766
This is the same
kind of guy if you,

700
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:15,062
if you smashed
him in the face

701
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:16,431
eight or nine times

702
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:17,798
with a big chunk
of concrete

703
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,095
and then beat
him over the head

704
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:20,465
with a steel rod for
an hour and a half

705
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:21,728
you know what?

706
00:26:21,802 --> 00:26:24,631
He'd drop like
a fucking rock.

707
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:26,931
Like a rock.

708
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,728
Here's another guy
thing that sucks.

709
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,098
These T-shirts that say,

710
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,293
Lead follow or get
out of the way.

711
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:34,595
You ever see that?

712
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:36,065
This is more of that

713
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:37,533
stupid Marine
Corp bullshit.

714
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:39,567
Obsolete male impulses

715
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,328
from a hundred
thousand years ago.

716
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:43,526
Lead follow or get
out of the way.

717
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,898
You know what I do

718
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,433
when I see that shirt?

719
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,192
I stand right in
the guys path,

720
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:50,598
force him to
walk around me,

721
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:51,861
he gets a
little past me,

722
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:53,127
I spin him around,

723
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:54,359
kick him in the nuts,

724
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:55,990
rip off his shirt,
wipe it on my ass

725
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:57,624
and shove it down
his fucking throat.

726
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,791
That's what I do when
I see that shirt.

727
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:01,992
Yeah.

728
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:04,326
Hey, listen,

729
00:27:04,402 --> 00:27:05,695
that's all
these Marine's

730
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:07,961
are looking for
a good time.

731
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,829
And speaking
of tough guys,

732
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,833
I'm getting a little
tired of hearing

733
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:13,991
that after six
policemen get arrested

734
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,499
for shoving
a floor lamp

735
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,055
up some black guys ass

736
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:18,600
and ripping his
intestine's out

737
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:20,032
the police
department announces

738
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:23,192
they're going to have
sensitivity training.

739
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,357
I say hey, if you
need special training

740
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:26,866
to be told not to jam

741
00:27:26,934 --> 00:27:29,092
a large
cumbersome object

742
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:30,689
up someone else's asshole

743
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,358
maybe you're
too fucked up

744
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:33,899
to be on the police
force in the first place

745
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,024
huh?

746
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,292
Maybe.

747
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:37,525
Maybe not.

748
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,895
Maybe not, I don't know.

749
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:40,263
Listen, yeah.

750
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:45,028
That's right.

751
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,223
You know what
they ought to do?

752
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,560
They ought to have
two new requirements

753
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,792
for being on the police.

754
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,424
Intelligence and decency.

755
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,727
You never can tell
it might just work.

756
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:56,857
It certainly hasn't
been tried yet.

757
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:58,296
No one should ever have

758
00:27:58,366 --> 00:28:00,060
any object placed
inside their asshole

759
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:01,563
that is larger
than a fist

760
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:06,565
and less loving
than a dildo okay?

761
00:28:06,632 --> 00:28:10,724
Now this next thing is
about our president.

762
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,060
This is about
our president.

763
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:14,393
Bill Jeff.

764
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:15,452
Bill Jeff.

765
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:16,520
Bill Jeff.

766
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,691
Clinton.

767
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,322
I don't call him Clinton
I call him Clittin.

768
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,025
Clittin, C-L-l-T-T-l-N,
apostroph-e.

769
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:26,586
His big deal was J.F.K.

770
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:27,426
Isn't that right?

771
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,658
Love J.F.K.

772
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:29,959
Wanted to immolate J.F.K.

773
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,055
In every way.

774
00:28:31,132 --> 00:28:32,359
Well J.F.K.'s
administration

775
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:33,830
was called Camelot.

776
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:35,125
Well what it really
should have been called

777
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:37,131
Come A Lot.

778
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:40,062
Because that's what
he did he came a lot.

779
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:41,496
So Clinton's
looking for a legacy

780
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:42,655
that's what he
should call it.

781
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:45,219
Well maybe come a little
would be better for him

782
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,286
cause he came a little.

783
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:47,421
You know, a little
on the dress,

784
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:48,623
little on the desk,

785
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:49,958
not a whole lot really.

786
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:51,758
Hey he was no match,

787
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,956
no match for Kennedy in
the pussy department.

788
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:56,223
Kennedy aimed high,

789
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:57,853
Marilyn Monroe.

790
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,023
Clinton showed his dick
to a government clerk.

791
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:03,824
There's a drop off here.

792
00:29:03,897 --> 00:29:06,091
It's a drop off.

793
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:09,324
Thank you.

794
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:11,092
Thank you.

795
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:12,964
Now... I appreciate it.

796
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:14,859
Something else I'm
getting tired of

797
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:17,658
is all this stupid bullshit
we have to listen to

798
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:20,060
all the time
about children.

799
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:21,528
It's all you here
in this country.

800
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:22,688
Children.

801
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:23,729
Help the children.

802
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:24,785
What about the children?

803
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,955
Save the children.

804
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,223
You know what I say?

805
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:28,523
Fuck the children.

806
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:30,222
Fuck 'em.

807
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:33,318
They're getting entirely
too much attention

808
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,726
and I know what you're
thinking you say,

809
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:36,318
Jesus he's not going to
attack children is he?

810
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:40,193
Yes he is.

811
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:43,094
He's going to
attack children.

812
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:45,958
And remember this is
Mister Conductor talking.

813
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,860
I know what I'm
talking about.

814
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:52,655
I know what I'm
talking about.

815
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:55,195
And I also know,

816
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:56,990
I also know all
you single dad's

817
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,392
and soccer mom's

818
00:29:58,462 --> 00:29:59,928
who think you're
such fucking heroes

819
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:01,393
aren't going to
like this

820
00:30:01,462 --> 00:30:03,155
but somebody's got to tell
you for your own good,

821
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:06,127
you're children are
overrated and overvalued.

822
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:08,025
You've turned them into
little cult objects.

823
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:11,686
You have a child fetish
and it's not healthy.

824
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:14,284
And don't give me, don't
give me that weak shit.

825
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:15,953
Well I love my children.

826
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:18,586
Fuck you.

827
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:20,492
Everybody loves
their children.

828
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:22,186
Doesn't make you special.

829
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:25,127
John Wayne Gacy
loved his children.

830
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:28,523
Kept them all right out in
the yard near the garage.

831
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,254
That's not what
I'm talking about.

832
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,158
What I'm talking about
is this constant,

833
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:34,558
mindless, yammering
in the media,

834
00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:36,423
this neurotic fixation

835
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:37,983
that some how everything,

836
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:41,255
everything has to be
revolved around children.

837
00:30:41,328 --> 00:30:43,350
It's completely
out of balance.

838
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,418
Listen, there are a couple
of things about kids

839
00:30:45,496 --> 00:30:46,655
you have to remember.

840
00:30:46,729 --> 00:30:50,352
First of all, they're
not all cute okay?

841
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:51,757
In fact, if you
look at them close

842
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:55,054
some of them are rather
unpleasant looking.

843
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:57,958
And a lot of them don't
smell too good either.

844
00:30:58,028 --> 00:30:59,323
The little ones
in particular

845
00:30:59,394 --> 00:31:00,656
seem to have a kind of

846
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:03,125
urine and sour milk
combination or something.

847
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,642
Stay with me on
this, the longer,

848
00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:05,624
the sooner you face it

849
00:31:05,674 --> 00:31:07,681
the better off
you're going to be.

850
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:09,453
Second premise,
not all children

851
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,987
are smart and
clever got that?

852
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:13,720
Kids are like any
other group of people,

853
00:31:13,794 --> 00:31:17,850
a few winners a
whole lot of losers.

854
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,949
There are a lot of
loser kids out there

855
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:22,960
who simply aren't
going anywhere.

856
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:24,548
And you can't
save them all.

857
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:25,717
You can't save them all.

858
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:26,851
You got to let them go.

859
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:27,982
You go to cut them lose.

860
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:29,856
You got to stop
overprotecting them

861
00:31:29,927 --> 00:31:31,619
cause your making
them too soft.

862
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:34,183
Today's kids are
way too soft.

863
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,023
For one thing there's too
much emphasis on safety.

864
00:31:38,094 --> 00:31:39,683
Childproof
medicine bottles

865
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,988
and fireproof pajamas,

866
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:43,388
child restraints in
car seats and helmets,

867
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:46,255
bicycles, skateboard,
baseball helmet.

868
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:47,952
Kids have to wear helmets
now for everything

869
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:50,424
but jerking off.

870
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:52,550
Grown ups have
taken all the fun

871
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:54,023
out of being a kid

872
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:56,455
just to save a few
thousand lives.

873
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:57,957
It's pathetic.

874
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,721
It's pathetic.

875
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,484
What's happening is,

876
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:02,455
all right,

877
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:04,013
what's happening,

878
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,079
you know what it is?

879
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:08,682
These baby boomers, these
soft, fruity baby boomers

880
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,248
are raising an
entire generation

881
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:12,348
of soft, fruity kids

882
00:32:12,425 --> 00:32:14,449
who aren't even allowed
to have hazardous toys

883
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:16,049
for Christ's sake.

884
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:17,217
Hazardous toys shit.

885
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:18,952
What ever happened
to natural selection?

886
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:20,388
Survival of the fittest.

887
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:22,152
The kid who swallows
too many marbles

888
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:25,386
doesn't grow up to
have kids of his own.

889
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,787
Simple as that.

890
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:27,950
Simple.

891
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:30,583
Nature, nature.

892
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,715
Nature knows best.

893
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,848
We're saving entirely
too many lives

894
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:37,187
in this country
of all ages.

895
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,189
Nature should be
allowed to do its job

896
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,087
of killing off the
weak and sickly

897
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:44,021
and ignorant people
without interference

898
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:46,886
from air bags and
batting helmets.

899
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:51,482
Just think of it as
passive euthenics okay?

900
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:54,786
Now here's another example
of over protection.

901
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:56,720
Did you ever notice
on the TV news

902
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,451
every time some
guy with an AK 47

903
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:01,184
strolls onto a school yard

904
00:33:01,258 --> 00:33:02,848
and kills three
or four kids

905
00:33:02,924 --> 00:33:04,082
and a couple
of teachers,

906
00:33:04,157 --> 00:33:06,089
the next day,
the next day

907
00:33:06,157 --> 00:33:08,987
the school is overrun
with counselors

908
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:10,420
and psychiatrist

909
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,751
and grief
counselors

910
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,949
and trauma therapists

911
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,355
trying to help
the children cope.

912
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,048
Shit when I was in school

913
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:17,317
someone came to our school

914
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,855
and killed three
or four of us

915
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:21,788
we went right on
with our arithmetic.

916
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:27,153
Thirty-five
classmates minus four

917
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:29,986
equals thirty-one.

918
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:31,523
We were tough.

919
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:32,648
We were tough.

920
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:35,348
I say if kids can handle
the violence at home

921
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:36,583
they ought to be
able to handle

922
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:38,953
the violence in school.

923
00:33:39,024 --> 00:33:40,921
I'm not worried about
guns in school,

924
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:42,183
you know what
I'm waiting for?

925
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:44,518
Guns in church.

926
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,146
That's going to
be a lot of fun.

927
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:47,518
And it will
happen you watch.

928
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:50,715
Some nut will go fucking
ape shit in a church

929
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,981
and they'll
refer to him as

930
00:33:52,055 --> 00:33:56,044
a disgruntled worshiper.

931
00:33:56,122 --> 00:33:57,316
Here.

932
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,184
Here's another bunch
of ignorant shit.

933
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:00,721
School uniforms.

934
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,723
Bad theory.

935
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:04,745
The idea that if kids
wear uniforms to school

936
00:34:04,822 --> 00:34:06,119
it helps keep order.

937
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,280
Don't these schools
do enough damage

938
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:10,320
making all these
kids think alike

939
00:34:10,388 --> 00:34:12,787
now there going to get
them to look alike too?

940
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:14,083
And it's not a new idea.

941
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:16,815
I first saw it in old
newsreel in the 1930's

942
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,149
but it was hard
to understand

943
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:22,677
cause the narration
was in German.

944
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:25,114
All right.

945
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:27,582
One more.

946
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:28,779
Thank you.

947
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:31,481
Thank you.

948
00:34:31,555 --> 00:34:33,713
One more item
about children

949
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:36,413
and that is this
superstitious nonsense

950
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:38,455
that blames
tobacco companies

951
00:34:38,522 --> 00:34:40,077
for kids who smoke.

952
00:34:40,154 --> 00:34:41,677
Listen kids don't smoke

953
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:45,654
because a camel in
sunglasses tells them to.

954
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:47,913
They smoke for the
same reasons adults do

955
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:51,442
because it relieves
anxiety and depression.

956
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:52,987
And you'd be anxious
and depressed too

957
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:54,452
if you had to
put up with these

958
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,782
pathetic, insecure,

959
00:34:55,855 --> 00:34:57,650
striving, anal,
yuppie parents

960
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,152
who enroll you in college

961
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:00,516
before you're old
enough to know

962
00:35:00,587 --> 00:35:04,043
which side of the
playpen smells the worst.

963
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:05,847
And then they fill
you full of Ritalin

964
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,215
and drag you
all over town

965
00:35:07,286 --> 00:35:09,013
in search of
meaningless structure.

966
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:11,417
Little League, Cub
Scouts, swimming, soccer,

967
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,942
karate, piano, bagpipes,
watercolors, witchcraft,

968
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:19,249
glass blowing and
dildo practice.

969
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:20,651
They even,

970
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:23,415
they even have play
dates for Christ's sakes.

971
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,850
Playing is now done
by appointment.

972
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:26,977
What ever happened to

973
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:28,417
you show me
your wee wee

974
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:31,884
and I'll show you mine?

975
00:35:31,953 --> 00:35:35,681
Hey no wonder kids
smoke, it helps.

976
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,083
Not as much as weed

977
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:39,846
but hey you can't
have everything.

978
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:40,886
You know it's true,

979
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:43,043
parents are burning these
kids out on structure.

980
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,846
I think everyday
all children

981
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:48,317
should have three
hours of daydreaming,

982
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:50,079
just daydreaming.

983
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:52,915
You could use it a little
of it yourself by the way.

984
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,451
Just sit at the window
stare at the clouds

985
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,644
it's good for you.

986
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,913
Do you want
to know how

987
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,212
you can help
your children?

988
00:35:58,285 --> 00:36:00,582
Leave them the fuck alone!

989
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:04,546
Very well.

990
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,250
Thank you very much.

991
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:09,644
Okay.

992
00:36:12,452 --> 00:36:14,315
All right now a
little change of pace.

993
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:16,010
Little change
of intensity.

994
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:17,016
I want you to know

995
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:18,074
what's on
television tonight

996
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:19,084
on the other channels.

997
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:20,275
Always like people
to know what it is

998
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,646
they're missing by
listening to my shit.

999
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:25,344
First of all on the
Playboy channel

1000
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:27,645
on the Playboy
channel tonight

1001
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:29,480
they have one of those
new reality shows

1002
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:31,574
where the people at home
send in their own tapes

1003
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:35,744
it's called, Home
Videos of Bad Fucking.

1004
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,282
And speaking of that
delightful activity

1005
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,214
I guess you know last
week Rickey Lake

1006
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,581
had a special program

1007
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:43,208
Women Who Fake Orgasms

1008
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,773
so tonight not
to be out done

1009
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:46,681
Jerry Springer has
a night time special

1010
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:49,774
Men Who Fake
Bowel Movements.

1011
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:51,181
Yeah I think they're
running out of topics

1012
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,716
on those shows too.

1013
00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:53,977
Sally Jesse's
next show is

1014
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:55,450
Rapist's Who Force
Their Victims

1015
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:58,244
to Play Yahtzee
Beforehand.

1016
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:01,078
Getting a little
strange on daytime TV.

1017
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,378
Then later on tonight
on the Nostalgia Channel

1018
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,814
they're going to
play back-to-back

1019
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:07,180
two of my
favorite episodes

1020
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:08,580
of Little House
on the Prairie.

1021
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:11,141
First of all of the
1975 Christmas show,

1022
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:14,185
A Douche Bag for Clara.

1023
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:15,408
Wasn't that good?

1024
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,541
And it was sad toward
the end when she cried

1025
00:37:17,617 --> 00:37:21,912
cause she stuck it
in the wrong hole.

1026
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:23,813
But as they say
in the U.S. Navy,

1027
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:27,645
there is no wrong hole.

1028
00:37:27,716 --> 00:37:30,682
And then right after that
they're going to play

1029
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,842
my favorite Little House
on the Prairie of all time,

1030
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,212
Missy Takes A Big
Dump In The Woods.

1031
00:37:36,283 --> 00:37:37,508
And that was
interesting I thought

1032
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:38,742
cause she had on
the high heels

1033
00:37:38,816 --> 00:37:39,782
and the long dress

1034
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,042
and it was fun to watch

1035
00:37:41,116 --> 00:37:44,447
how she had to maneuver
through the poison sumac.

1036
00:37:44,517 --> 00:37:46,982
And they didn't have
toilet paper in those days

1037
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:51,483
she had to use a
series of pinecones.

1038
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,573
And she was pulling them
in the wrong direction.

1039
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,616
Yes.

1040
00:37:56,683 --> 00:37:58,081
I understand toward
the end of the show

1041
00:37:58,149 --> 00:37:59,512
they had to bleep
out a lot of

1042
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:01,844
screaming and
foul language.

1043
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:03,744
And then hey, hey,

1044
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,474
later on tonight
on pay-per-view,

1045
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:08,310
on pay-per-view
Willie Nelson.

1046
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:11,211
Willie Nelson's concert
is on and TV Guide listed

1047
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,975
all the songs he's
going to sing.

1048
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,445
He's going to start out
with one my favorites,

1049
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:18,640
Too Drunk To Jerk Off,
isn't that a good one?

1050
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,147
God I love that song.

1051
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:22,272
Then he's going to do
a series of love songs.

1052
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:25,543
Kiss Me I'm Coming,
awe that's a good one.

1053
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:26,911
Kiss me I'm coming.

1054
00:38:26,982 --> 00:38:28,040
Hold me I'm humming.

1055
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:30,512
Hmmmm.

1056
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:32,707
Well I can't help
it, I am a romantic

1057
00:38:32,782 --> 00:38:35,838
and I do enjoy the
sentimental tunes.

1058
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,244
Here's a sad song,

1059
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,406
I should of Fucked
Ole' What's Her Name.

1060
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:42,572
Remember that?

1061
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:44,409
I should of never
played the game.

1062
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:48,378
I should of fucked
ole' what's her name.

1063
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:50,414
Here's one my mother used
to sing around the house.

1064
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:54,437
You're Love Ran Down My
Leg and Now You're Gone.

1065
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:55,377
Yeah.

1066
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:56,572
Yeah.

1067
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:58,114
That one always got to me.

1068
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:01,045
I'm glad you feel
the same way.

1069
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:02,706
Here's a fine love song.

1070
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:07,769
You Blew My Mind
Now Blow Me.

1071
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:10,575
He even,

1072
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,875
he's even going to do
a Stevie Wonder song,

1073
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:15,913
I Just Called To Say
I Tested Positive.

1074
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,139
Yeah.

1075
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:18,474
Well you don't want
to leave anybody out

1076
00:39:18,546 --> 00:39:19,807
you know what I mean?

1077
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,345
And hey, and hey,

1078
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:22,971
what would a Willie
Nelson show be

1079
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:24,568
without a couple
of cowboy songs?

1080
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:26,010
He's going to do that one

1081
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,704
George Jones and
Waylon Jennings wrote,

1082
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:29,143
Drinking Beer,
Taking A Shit

1083
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:30,804
and Passing Out.

1084
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,311
Then he's going
to do a kind of

1085
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,937
traditional western song,

1086
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:35,310
one that Gene
Autry used to sing

1087
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,505
when I was a little boy,
It's Midnight in Montana

1088
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,172
and I Can't Get My
Dick Out of this Cow.

1089
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:44,678
I love that song.

1090
00:39:44,746 --> 00:39:46,475
I always liked it.

1091
00:39:46,547 --> 00:39:47,603
Yeah.

1092
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,907
You know why I like
that song so much?

1093
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,878
Cause it's a real
cowboy song,

1094
00:39:51,947 --> 00:39:56,003
and by the way, speaking
of cattle fucking,

1095
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,544
do you know why it is

1096
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,010
when a rancher
fucks a sheep

1097
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,807
he does so at the
edge of a cliff?

1098
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,140
It's so the sheep
will push back.

1099
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:08,338
Little something for you.

1100
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:11,535
Yes.

1101
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:13,202
Just a little tip
for you outdoorsmen

1102
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,268
when you're out camping.

1103
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:20,003
Now this next thing
is about names

1104
00:40:20,077 --> 00:40:21,873
that's all names.

1105
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:23,639
Names are an
interest of mine.

1106
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,678
Not a hobby.

1107
00:40:24,746 --> 00:40:26,075
Hobby's cost money.

1108
00:40:26,145 --> 00:40:27,667
Interest are free.

1109
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:28,905
This is just about names.

1110
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:31,103
Did you ever notice how
they name singles bars?

1111
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,666
Singles bars have
all the same kind of

1112
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,677
cutesy little one word
names that end in 'S.'

1113
00:40:35,745 --> 00:40:38,710
Scamps, Tramps, Chats,
Rumors, Cahoots, Cheers,

1114
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:41,436
Chances, Mingles,
Risks, Gambits, Notions,

1115
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,841
hey if I had a singles bar
you know what I'd call it?

1116
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:47,138
Nipples and Dicks.

1117
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,337
A little truth
in advertising.

1118
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:51,468
The Sperm Club.

1119
00:40:51,544 --> 00:40:54,999
Snatch-O-Rama.

1120
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,065
The Crotchiteria,

1121
00:40:58,143 --> 00:41:00,702
Frankie's Fuckery,

1122
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:06,300
Café Vagina,
Open All Night.

1123
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:09,037
Well I'm an old
fashioned guy.

1124
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:11,042
I'm old-fashioned
cause I believe

1125
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,542
the name on the
outside of a place

1126
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,975
ought to let you know

1127
00:41:14,045 --> 00:41:15,508
what's going on
in the inside.

1128
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:17,805
Here would be a good name
for a gay restaurant,

1129
00:41:17,877 --> 00:41:20,308
The Mouthful, huh?

1130
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,071
Come on that's
clever shit,

1131
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:23,540
that's a double
pun Goddamn it,

1132
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:25,906
you didn't think of it.

1133
00:41:25,977 --> 00:41:27,737
Besides you don't
have to eat there

1134
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:29,436
if you don't want to.

1135
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:34,703
No, no, just go in
have a cocktail.

1136
00:41:34,776 --> 00:41:38,573
Or a high ball.

1137
00:41:38,644 --> 00:41:40,405
Here's another name
I don't care for,

1138
00:41:40,477 --> 00:41:41,965
TGI Fridays.

1139
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:43,440
You know these cutesy
ass little places,

1140
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:46,236
TGI Fridays.

1141
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:49,798
That whole TGIF thing was
cute for about an hour,

1142
00:41:49,876 --> 00:41:51,502
about an hour,

1143
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:53,200
and that was 65 years ago

1144
00:41:53,274 --> 00:41:54,969
when someone first
said it on the radio.

1145
00:41:55,043 --> 00:41:56,371
Not cute anymore,

1146
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:59,771
time to start bombing
these locations.

1147
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:01,172
TGI Fridays.

1148
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,710
If I had a
place like that

1149
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,004
you know what
I'd call it?

1150
00:42:04,075 --> 00:42:05,666
H-S-l-O-W,

1151
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:10,006
Holy Shit its
Only Wednesday.

1152
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:13,337
I think people would
drink a lot more liquor

1153
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:18,500
if they thought it was
Wednesday all the time.

1154
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:20,404
Well I'm just looking
for a little honesty

1155
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:21,873
in these names,
little honesty.

1156
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:23,271
That's not asking a lot.

1157
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,068
I'm thinking of
opening up a motel

1158
00:42:25,141 --> 00:42:28,109
and calling it The
Sleep and Fuck.

1159
00:42:28,176 --> 00:42:30,731
Wouldn't that be a good
honest name for a motel?

1160
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:33,773
Who needs this Shady
Pines bullshit?

1161
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:36,603
The Sleep and Fuck Motel.

1162
00:42:36,674 --> 00:42:38,334
Get me one of them
big neon signs,

1163
00:42:38,408 --> 00:42:40,771
Sleep... Fuck.

1164
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:42,808
Sleep... fuck.

1165
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:43,933
Sleep and fuck.

1166
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:45,031
Sleep and fuck.

1167
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:46,075
Sleep and Fuck.

1168
00:42:46,142 --> 00:42:47,833
Sleep... fuck.

1169
00:42:47,906 --> 00:42:49,998
Sleep... fuck.

1170
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,772
Sleep and Fuck.

1171
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,033
Sleep and Fuck.

1172
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,597
You put it right at
the Jersey entrance

1173
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:02,367
to the Holland
Tunnel you know?

1174
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,804
Actually Fuck and Sleep

1175
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:05,602
would be a little more
accurate wouldn't it?

1176
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:07,070
Best name for a
motel would be

1177
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:08,834
The Fuck and Smoke and
Sleep and Rollover

1178
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:10,098
and Get Out of Bed
and Wash Your Crotch

1179
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:11,867
and Go Out and Buy
Two Cans Mr. Pibb

1180
00:43:11,941 --> 00:43:14,735
and Go Home and Fuck
A Whole Lot More.

1181
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:16,739
A whole lot more.

1182
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:18,204
Cause that's all
they ever have left

1183
00:43:18,273 --> 00:43:20,433
in those soda machines
on Sunday nights.

1184
00:43:20,508 --> 00:43:24,463
Mr. Pibb and Diet
Shasta Orange

1185
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:26,095
and that yellow can

1186
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:31,935
of Canada Dry Tonic
Water that nobody wants!

1187
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:33,972
And speaking of
naming things,

1188
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:36,233
am I the only person
in this country

1189
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:38,169
who's laughing when
these commercials

1190
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,332
come on television for
Snapper lawn mowers?

1191
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:44,735
Isn't there anyone else
on this fading republic

1192
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:47,396
who knows what
a snapper is?

1193
00:43:47,472 --> 00:43:50,338
A snapper is a pussy okay?

1194
00:43:50,406 --> 00:43:51,666
That's what it means,

1195
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:53,831
snapper means pussy

1196
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:56,337
It's derived from an
older more specific term

1197
00:43:56,406 --> 00:43:58,837
snappin' pussy,

1198
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:00,566
which describes a
particular type of pussy.

1199
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,127
One with good, quick
muscular control,

1200
00:44:02,205 --> 00:44:03,967
kind of an elasticity
in the vaginal wall

1201
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:05,403
that can grab
a hold of you

1202
00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:06,769
and give you a decent hump

1203
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,362
do you know what
I'm talking about?

1204
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:12,337
A snappin' pussy.

1205
00:44:12,406 --> 00:44:15,735
But now, now snapper
means any kind of pussy

1206
00:44:15,805 --> 00:44:19,034
and they've named a lawn
mower company after it.

1207
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:22,401
Now I have seen a few
snappers in my day,

1208
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:26,166
never seen one
that'll cut grass.

1209
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,136
No.

1210
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,397
No.

1211
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:30,234
Maybe do a little edging,

1212
00:44:30,306 --> 00:44:32,100
a little edging
along the driveway

1213
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:35,104
after a party that's
all you can hope for.

1214
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:39,159
But you know weed whacker
you can understand.

1215
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:41,731
Now a lot of these
company names

1216
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,997
and product names

1217
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:44,401
are influenced
by marketing

1218
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:46,027
and advertising people

1219
00:44:46,104 --> 00:44:48,434
and this next thing
is about advertising

1220
00:44:48,504 --> 00:44:50,130
and by the way if
you should have any

1221
00:44:50,205 --> 00:44:52,170
cognitive dissonance
about the fact

1222
00:44:52,237 --> 00:44:54,567
that I do commercials
for 10-10-2-20

1223
00:44:54,638 --> 00:44:56,969
and still attack
advertising up here

1224
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:58,866
well you're just
going to have

1225
00:44:58,937 --> 00:45:01,266
to figure that shit
out on your own okay?

1226
00:45:01,336 --> 00:45:06,793
Now, this is called
advertising lullaby.

1227
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,268
Keeping in mind of course

1228
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:10,064
that the whole
purpose of advertising

1229
00:45:10,137 --> 00:45:12,830
is to lull
you to sleep.

1230
00:45:12,903 --> 00:45:15,732
Quality, values, styles,
service, selection,

1231

convenience, economy,
savings, performance,

risk, no obligation,

no purchase necessary,

1244

no one will call on you,

1245
00:45:41,802 --> 00:45:45,598
no payments or interest

1246

But limited time only,
so act now, order today,

1247
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:52,395
send no money, offer good

batteries not included,

some items not available,

1253
00:46:01,169 --> 00:46:03,657
some restrictions

1254
00:46:03,736 --> 00:46:07,099
But come on in.

1255

Yours for the asking,

1278
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:03,560
It's our way of
saying thank you.

1279
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:05,397
Actually it's
our way of saying

1280
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:08,262
bend over just a
little bit farther

1281
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:10,664
so we can stick this
big advertising dick

1282
00:47:10,735 --> 00:47:12,893
up your ass a
little bit deeper.

1283
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:14,193
A little bit deeper.

1284
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:16,994
A little bit deeper.

1285
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,061
You miserable,

1286
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:27,065
no good, fucking
consumer asshole.

1287
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:30,456
Cause you do know folks
living in this country

1288
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:31,965
you're bound to know,

1289
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:34,329
that every time you're
exposed to advertising

1290
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,798
you realize once again

1291
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:37,354
that America's
leading industry,

1292
00:47:37,432 --> 00:47:39,229
America's most
profitable business

1293
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:41,596
is still the
manufacture packaging,

1294
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:44,597
distribution and
marketing of bullshit.

1295
00:47:44,665 --> 00:47:47,633
High quality, grade
'A', prime cut,

1296
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,892
pure American bullshit

1297
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:51,261
and the sad part is,

1298
00:47:51,332 --> 00:47:53,423
is that most people seem
to have been indoctrinated

1299
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:55,056
to believe that bullshit

1300
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:56,758
only comes from
certain places,

1301
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,025
certain sources,

1302
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:01,362
advertising, politics,
salesmen, not true,

1303
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:03,090
bullshit is everywhere.

1304
00:48:03,164 --> 00:48:04,563
Bullshit is rampant.

1305
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:05,824
Parents are full of shit,

1306
00:48:05,897 --> 00:48:07,091
teachers are
full of shit,

1307
00:48:07,165 --> 00:48:08,495
clergymen are
full of shit

1308
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:11,589
and law enforcement
people are full of shit.

1309
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:14,063
This entire country,

1310
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:18,258
this entire country is
completely full of shit

1311
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:19,992
and always has been

1312
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:21,620
from the Declaration
of Independence

1313
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:23,460
of the Constitution to
the Star Spangled Banner

1314
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:26,123
it's still nothing more
than one big steaming pile

1315
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:29,686
of red, white and blue
all American bullshit

1316
00:48:29,764 --> 00:48:33,253
because think of
how we started.

1317
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:34,354
Think of that.

1318
00:48:34,431 --> 00:48:35,760
This country was founded

1319
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:37,765
by a group of slave owners

1320
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,422
who told us all men
are created equal.

1321
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:42,087
Oh yeah, all
men except for

1322
00:48:42,163 --> 00:48:44,630
Indians and niggers
and women right?

1323
00:48:44,698 --> 00:48:46,220
Always like to use

1324
00:48:46,297 --> 00:48:47,957
that authentic
American language.

1325
00:48:48,031 --> 00:48:50,292
This was a small
group of unelected,

1326
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:52,593
white male, land
holding, slave owners

1327
00:48:52,665 --> 00:48:54,926
who also suggested
their class

1328
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,192
be the only one
allowed to vote.

1329
00:48:57,265 --> 00:49:00,253
Now that is what's known
as being stunningly

1330
00:49:00,331 --> 00:49:03,626
and embarrassingly
full of shit.

1331
00:49:03,697 --> 00:49:05,856
And I think, I
think Americans

1332
00:49:05,931 --> 00:49:08,397
really show their
ignorance when they say

1333
00:49:08,465 --> 00:49:10,726
they want their
politicians to be honest.

1334
00:49:10,796 --> 00:49:13,957
What are these fucking
creedents talking about?

1335
00:49:14,031 --> 00:49:16,154
If honesty were suddenly

1336
00:49:16,229 --> 00:49:18,059
introduced into
American life

1337
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,652
the whole system
would collapse.

1338
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,356
No one would
no what to do.

1339
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,952
Honesty would fuck
this country up.

1340
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,359
And I think deep down
Americans know that.

1341
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:28,827
That's why they elected

1342
00:49:28,896 --> 00:49:32,124
and re-elected
Bill Clinton.

1343
00:49:32,197 --> 00:49:36,754
That's right.

1344
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,955
Because, because
the American people

1345
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,824
liked their bullshit
right out front

1346
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,919
where they can get a
good strong whiff of it.

1347
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:46,553
Clinton might
be full of shit

1348
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,925
but at least he
lets you know it.

1349
00:49:48,996 --> 00:49:50,929
Dole tried to
hide it didn't he?

1350
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:53,654
Dole kept saying, I'm
a plain and honest man.

1351
00:49:53,728 --> 00:49:55,525
Bullshit.

1352
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:57,026
People don't believe that.

1353
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:58,289
What did Clinton say?

1354
00:49:58,363 --> 00:49:59,727
He said, Hi folks.

1355
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:03,160
I'm completely full shit
and how do you like that?

1356
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,194
And the people said,
You know something?

1357
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:08,318
At least he's honest.

1358
00:50:08,395 --> 00:50:09,919
At least he's honest

1359
00:50:09,997 --> 00:50:12,257
about being completely
full of shit.

1360
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:14,790
It's just like the
business world.

1361
00:50:14,863 --> 00:50:16,192
Same as business.

1362
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:18,420
Everybody knows by
now all businessmen

1363
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,960
are completely
full of shit.

1364
00:50:21,028 --> 00:50:23,358
Just the worse kind
of low life criminal,

1365
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:25,655
cocksuckers you could
ever want to run into.

1366
00:50:25,728 --> 00:50:28,389
The fucking piece
of shit businessman.

1367
00:50:28,463 --> 00:50:30,551
And the proof of it,
the proof of it is

1368
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,185
they don't even
trust each other.

1369
00:50:32,261 --> 00:50:33,725
They don't trust
one another.

1370
00:50:33,793 --> 00:50:35,351
When a businessman
sets down

1371
00:50:35,428 --> 00:50:36,792
and negotiates a deal

1372
00:50:36,862 --> 00:50:38,656
the first thing he
does is automatically

1373
00:50:38,728 --> 00:50:41,421
assume that the other guy
is a complete lying prick

1374
00:50:41,494 --> 00:50:43,791
who's trying to fuck
him out of his money.

1375
00:50:43,862 --> 00:50:45,486
So he's got to do
everything he can

1376
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:47,529
to fuck the other guy
a little bit faster

1377
00:50:47,596 --> 00:50:49,287
and a little bit harder.

1378
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,691
And he's got to do it

1379
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:52,489
with a big smile
on his face.

1380
00:50:52,562 --> 00:50:55,288
You know that big
bullshit businessman smile

1381
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:58,259
and if you're a
customer whoa,

1382
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:00,952
that's when you get
the really big smile.

1383
00:51:01,027 --> 00:51:03,720
Customer always gets
the really big smile

1384
00:51:03,793 --> 00:51:05,124
as the businessman

1385
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,886
carefully
positions himself

1386
00:51:06,959 --> 00:51:08,926
directly behind
the customer

1387
00:51:08,994 --> 00:51:10,618
and unzips his pants

1388
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,989
and proceeds to
service the account.

1389
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,390
I'm servicing
this account.

1390
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:20,018
This customer
needs service.

1391
00:51:20,094 --> 00:51:23,060
Now you know
what they mean.

1392
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:24,889
Now you know what they
mean when they say,

1393
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:28,358
We specialize in
customer service.

1394
00:51:28,427 --> 00:51:30,449
Whoever coined the phrase,

1395
00:51:30,526 --> 00:51:32,116
"let the buyer beware"

1396
00:51:32,193 --> 00:51:36,683
was probably bleeding
from the asshole.

1397
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,452
But that's business.

1398
00:51:39,525 --> 00:51:41,583
That's business.

1399
00:51:43,127 --> 00:51:44,852
But in the bullshit
department,

1400
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:46,119
in the bullshit department

1401
00:51:46,193 --> 00:51:48,715
a businessman
can't hold a candle

1402
00:51:48,792 --> 00:51:50,520
to a clergyman.

1403
00:51:50,593 --> 00:51:52,114
Cause I got to tell
you the truth folks,

1404
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,625
I got to tell
you the truth,

1405
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,681
when it comes to bullshit,

1406
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:59,316
big time, major
league bullshit

1407
00:51:59,392 --> 00:52:02,255
you have to stand in awe,

1408
00:52:02,324 --> 00:52:04,951
in awe of the
all time champion

1409
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:07,514
of false promises and
exaggerated claims

1410
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:08,785
religion,

1411
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,256
no contest.

1412
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:13,382
No contest.

1413
00:52:13,459 --> 00:52:14,890
Religion,

1414
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,719
religion easily has

1415
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:20,088
the greatest bullshit
story ever told.

1416
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:21,486
Think about it.

1417
00:52:21,557 --> 00:52:24,955
Religion has actually
convinced people

1418
00:52:25,024 --> 00:52:29,616
that there's an invisible
man living in the sky

1419
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:31,453
who watches
everything you do,

1420
00:52:31,525 --> 00:52:33,513
every minute of every day

1421
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:35,751
and the invisible man
has a special list

1422
00:52:35,826 --> 00:52:39,620
of ten things he does
not want you to do.

1423
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,680
And if you do any
of these ten things

1424
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:45,088
he has a special place
full of fire and smoke

1425
00:52:45,158 --> 00:52:47,214
and burning and
torture and anguish

1426
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:49,484
where he will send
you to live and suffer

1427
00:52:49,558 --> 00:52:50,955
and burn and choke

1428
00:52:51,024 --> 00:52:53,081
and scream and cry
forever and ever

1429
00:52:53,157 --> 00:52:55,589
till the end of time.

1430
00:52:55,658 --> 00:52:57,986
But he loves you.

1431
00:53:03,991 --> 00:53:08,356
He loves you.

1432
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:13,082
He loves you and
he needs money.

1433
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,817
He always needs money.

1434
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:17,787
He's all-powerful, all
perfect, all knowing

1435
00:53:17,856 --> 00:53:23,551
and all wise somehow
just can't handle money.

1436
00:53:23,623 --> 00:53:26,613
Religion takes in
billions of dollars,

1437
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:28,552
they pay no taxes,

1438
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,816
and they always
need a little more.

1439
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:34,220
Now you talk about a
good bullshit story,

1440
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:37,743
holy shit!

1441
00:53:40,357 --> 00:53:41,913
Thank you.

1442
00:53:44,557 --> 00:53:45,749
Thank you.

1443
00:53:47,623 --> 00:53:48,885
But... thank you very much.

1444
00:53:51,357 --> 00:53:52,823
But I want you to know,

1445
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,376
I want you to
know something,

1446
00:53:54,455 --> 00:53:55,888
this is sincere,
I want you to know

1447
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:58,115
when it comes to
believing in God

1448
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,416
I really tried.

1449
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:01,648
I really, really tried.

1450
00:54:01,723 --> 00:54:03,655
I tried to believe
that there is a God

1451
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:05,154
who created each of us

1452
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:06,449
in his own image
and lightness,

1453
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:08,009
loves us very much

1454
00:54:08,088 --> 00:54:09,851
and keeps a close
eye on things,

1455
00:54:09,923 --> 00:54:11,355
I really tried
to believe that.

1456
00:54:11,423 --> 00:54:13,216
But I got to tell you
the longer you live,

1457
00:54:13,288 --> 00:54:14,719
the more you look around,

1458
00:54:14,787 --> 00:54:18,277
the more you realize
something is fucked up.

1459
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:20,321
Something is wrong here.

1460
00:54:20,388 --> 00:54:22,945
War, disease, death,
destruction, hunger,

1461
00:54:23,021 --> 00:54:25,284
filth, poverty, torture,
crime, corruption

1462
00:54:25,356 --> 00:54:28,481
and the Ice Capades

1463
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,952
something is
definitely wrong.

1464
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:32,715
This is not good work.

1465
00:54:32,788 --> 00:54:34,549
If this is the
best God can do

1466
00:54:34,622 --> 00:54:36,281
I am not impressed.

1467
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:37,980
Results like these
do not belong

1468
00:54:38,054 --> 00:54:40,384
on the resume of
a supreme being.

1469
00:54:40,455 --> 00:54:42,216
This is the kind of
shit you'd expect

1470
00:54:42,288 --> 00:54:45,651
from an office temp
with a bad attitude.

1471
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:48,280
And just between you and
me, between you and me

1472
00:54:48,356 --> 00:54:50,081
in any decently
run universe

1473
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:51,620
this guy would have been

1474
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:54,518
out on his all-powerful
ass a long time ago.

1475
00:54:54,588 --> 00:54:55,951
And by the way,

1476
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,987
I say this guy because
I firmly believe,

1477
00:54:58,054 --> 00:55:00,212
looking at these results,
that if there is a God

1478
00:55:00,287 --> 00:55:02,015
it has to be a man.

1479
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:04,053
No woman could
or would ever

1480
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,553
fuck things up like this.

1481
00:55:06,622 --> 00:55:09,849
So, so,

1482
00:55:09,921 --> 00:55:12,614
lf,

1483
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:15,050
If there is a
God, if there is,

1484
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,643
I think most reasonable
people might agree

1485
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:20,481
that he's at least
incompetent and maybe,

1486
00:55:20,553 --> 00:55:23,645
just maybe doesn't
give a shit.

1487
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:24,948
Doesn't give a shit,

1488
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,541
which I admire
in a person

1489
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:28,086
and which would
explain a lot

1490
00:55:28,153 --> 00:55:29,640
of these bad results.

1491
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:31,448
So rather than
be just another

1492
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,041
mindless religious robot,

1493
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,847
mindlessly and aimlessly

1494
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,409
and blindly believing
that all of this

1495
00:55:36,487 --> 00:55:38,281
is in the hands
of some spooky

1496
00:55:38,353 --> 00:55:39,615
incompetent father figure

1497
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,242
who doesn't give a shit,

1498
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:42,786
I decided to look around

1499
00:55:42,854 --> 00:55:44,579
for something
else to worship.

1500
00:55:44,652 --> 00:55:46,175
Something I could
really count on

1501
00:55:46,252 --> 00:55:48,684
and immediately I
thought of the sun.

1502
00:55:48,753 --> 00:55:49,980
Happened like that.

1503
00:55:50,053 --> 00:55:53,247
Overnight I became
a sun worshiper.

1504
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:54,546
Well not overnight,

1505
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,778
you can't see
the sun at night

1506
00:55:56,852 --> 00:56:00,148
but first thing
the next morning

1507
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:02,979
I became a sun worshiper.

1508
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:04,745
Several reasons,

1509
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,750
first of all I
can see the sun

1510
00:56:06,818 --> 00:56:09,547
okay?

1511
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,675
Yeah.

1512
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,343
Unlike some other
God's I could mention,

1513
00:56:12,419 --> 00:56:14,350
I can actually
see the sun.

1514
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:15,645
I'm big on that.

1515
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:17,277
If I can see something,
I don't know,

1516
00:56:17,353 --> 00:56:20,115
it kind of helps the
creditability along you know?

1517
00:56:20,187 --> 00:56:22,207
So everyday I
can see the sun

1518
00:56:22,284 --> 00:56:24,309
as it gives me
everything I need

1519
00:56:24,386 --> 00:56:26,908
heat, light, food,
flowers in the park,

1520
00:56:26,986 --> 00:56:28,644
reflections on
the lake,

1521
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,583
an occasional skin
cancer but hey

1522
00:56:31,652 --> 00:56:33,549
at least there were
no crucifixions

1523
00:56:33,618 --> 00:56:35,208
and were not setting
people on fire

1524
00:56:35,284 --> 00:56:37,717
simply because they
don't agree with us.

1525
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,976
Sun worship is
fairly simple,

1526
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,676
there's no mystery,
no miracles,

1527
00:56:41,751 --> 00:56:43,306
no pageantry, no
one asks for money,

1528
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:44,816
there are no
songs to learn

1529
00:56:44,884 --> 00:56:46,407
and we don't have
special building

1530
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:50,746
where we all gather once a
week to compare clothing.

1531
00:56:50,817 --> 00:56:52,306
And the best thing,

1532
00:56:52,384 --> 00:56:53,874
the best thing
about the sun

1533
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,712
it never tells
me I'm unworthy.

1534
00:56:55,784 --> 00:56:57,478
Doesn't tell me
I'm a bad person

1535
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:58,846
who needs to be saved.

1536
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,645
Hasn't said an
unkind word.

1537
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:02,980
Treats me fine.

1538
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:05,379
So I worship the sun

1539
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,643
but I don't
pray to the sun

1540
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:09,048
know why?

1541
00:57:09,117 --> 00:57:11,049
I wouldn't presume
on our friendship.

1542
00:57:11,117 --> 00:57:12,343
It's not polite.

1543
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:13,848
I've often thought
people treat God

1544
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:15,384
rather rudely don't you?

1545
00:57:15,451 --> 00:57:18,439
Asking up trillions and
trillions of prayers everyday.

1546
00:57:18,516 --> 00:57:20,981
Asking and pleading
and begging for favors.

1547
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:22,482
Do this, give me that,
I need a new car,

1548
00:57:22,551 --> 00:57:24,015
I want a better job

1549
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,606
and most of this praying

1550
00:57:25,683 --> 00:57:27,149
takes place on Sunday,

1551
00:57:27,217 --> 00:57:29,444
his day off.

1552
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:33,108
It's not nice and it's
no way to treat a friend.

1553
00:57:33,184 --> 00:57:35,011
But people do pray
and they pray

1554
00:57:35,082 --> 00:57:36,309
for a lot of
different things.

1555
00:57:36,382 --> 00:57:39,543
You know you're sister needs
an operation on her crotch.

1556
00:57:39,617 --> 00:57:43,845
Your brother was arrested
for defecating in a mall.

1557
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,109
But most of all you'd
really like to fuck

1558
00:57:46,183 --> 00:57:47,614
that hot little red head

1559
00:57:47,682 --> 00:57:49,443
down at the
convenient store.

1560
00:57:49,515 --> 00:57:50,913
You know the one
with the eye patch

1561
00:57:50,983 --> 00:57:52,813
and the clubfoot huh?

1562
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:54,369
Can you pray for that?

1563
00:57:54,448 --> 00:57:56,279
I think you'd have to.

1564
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:59,407
And I say fine, pray
for anything you want,

1565
00:57:59,483 --> 00:58:01,175
pray for anything but

1566
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:03,238
what about the
divine plan?

1567
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:04,645
Remember that?

1568
00:58:04,716 --> 00:58:06,113
The divine plan;

1569
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:08,615
long time ago God
made a divine plan.

1570
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:10,171
Gave it a lot of thought,

1571
00:58:10,249 --> 00:58:12,543
decided it was a good
plan, put into practice

1572
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:14,309
and for billions and
billions of years

1573
00:58:14,382 --> 00:58:17,041
the divine plan has
been doing just fine.

1574
00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:19,672
Now you come along and
pray for something.

1575
00:58:19,748 --> 00:58:21,373
Well suppose the
thing you want

1576
00:58:21,448 --> 00:58:23,574
isn't in God's
divine plan.

1577
00:58:23,648 --> 00:58:24,978
What do you
want him to do

1578
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:27,309
change his plan
just for you?

1579
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:28,871
Doesn't it seem a
little arrogant?

1580
00:58:28,949 --> 00:58:30,108
It's a divine plan.

1581
00:58:30,183 --> 00:58:31,578
What's the use
of being God

1582
00:58:31,647 --> 00:58:32,944
if every run down schmuck

1583
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:34,172
with a two-dollar
prayer book

1584
00:58:34,246 --> 00:58:36,237
can come along and
fuck up your plan?

1585
00:58:36,315 --> 00:58:37,712
And here's
something else,

1586
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:39,303
another problem
you might have,

1587
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:41,439
suppose your prayers
aren't answered,

1588
00:58:41,514 --> 00:58:42,673
what do you say?

1589
00:58:42,747 --> 00:58:44,112
Well it's God's will.

1590
00:58:44,182 --> 00:58:45,443
Thy will be done.

1591
00:58:45,515 --> 00:58:47,208
Fine but if
it's God's will

1592
00:58:47,282 --> 00:58:48,646
and he's going to do
what he wants to anyway

1593
00:58:48,716 --> 00:58:51,613
why the fuck bother
praying in the first place?

1594
00:58:51,681 --> 00:58:54,374
Seems like a big
waste of time to me.

1595
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,606
Couldn't you just
skip the praying part

1596
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,612
and go right to his will?

1597
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,237
It's all very confusing.

1598
00:59:00,314 --> 00:59:01,643
So to get around
a lot of this

1599
00:59:01,714 --> 00:59:04,009
I decided to
worship the sun

1600
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,479
but as I said I don't
pray to the sun.

1601
00:59:06,548 --> 00:59:08,011
You know who I pray to?

1602
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,773
Joe Peshi.

1603
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:12,244
Joe Peshi.

1604
00:59:12,313 --> 00:59:13,677
Joe Peshi.

1605
00:59:13,747 --> 00:59:15,837
Two reasons, first of all
I think he's a good actor

1606
00:59:15,913 --> 00:59:17,039
okay?

1607
00:59:17,114 --> 00:59:18,239
To me that counts.

1608
00:59:18,314 --> 00:59:19,370
Second,

1609
00:59:19,447 --> 00:59:22,710
he looks like a guy who
can get things done.

1610
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:25,713
Joe Peshi doesn't
fuck around.

1611
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:28,143
Doesn't fuck around.

1612
00:59:28,213 --> 00:59:30,736
In fact,

1613
00:59:30,814 --> 00:59:33,006
in fact, Joe Peshi
came through

1614
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,739
on a couple of things that
God was having trouble with.

1615
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:37,608
For years I asked
God to do something

1616
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:39,907
about my noisy neighbor
with the barking dog,

1617
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,809
Joe Peshi straightened
that cocksucker out

1618
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,971
with one visit.

1619
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:45,806
It's amazing what
you can accomplish

1620
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:48,969
with a simple
baseball bat.

1621
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:52,909
So I've been praying to
Joe for about a year now

1622
00:59:52,979 --> 00:59:54,537
and I noticed something.

1623
00:59:54,614 --> 00:59:56,306
I noticed that
all the prayers

1624
00:59:56,379 --> 00:59:57,868
I used to offer to God

1625
00:59:57,946 --> 01:00:00,104
and all the prayers I
now offer to Joe Peshi

1626
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,669
are being
answered at about

1627
01:00:01,747 --> 01:00:04,176
the same fifty
percent rate.

1628
01:00:04,244 --> 01:00:05,905
Half the time I
get what I want,

1629
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,502
half the time I don't.

1630
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:09,737
Same as God, fifty-fifty.

1631
01:00:09,812 --> 01:00:11,506
Same as the
four-leaf clover

1632
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:12,908
and the horseshoe,

1633
01:00:12,979 --> 01:00:14,411
the wishing well and
the rabbit's foot.

1634
01:00:14,479 --> 01:00:15,944
Same as the Mojo man.

1635
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,375
Same as the Voodoo lady

1636
01:00:17,445 --> 01:00:18,843
who tells you your fortune

1637
01:00:18,912 --> 01:00:20,344
by squeezing the
goat's testicles,

1638
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:22,171
it's all the
same fifty-fifty.

1639
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,268
So just pick your
superstition, sit back,

1640
01:00:24,346 --> 01:00:26,743
make a wish and
enjoy yourself

1641
01:00:26,812 --> 01:00:28,800
and for those of you
who look to the Bible

1642
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:31,867
for a moral lessons
and literary qualities

1643
01:00:31,945 --> 01:00:33,308
I might suggest

1644
01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:34,639
a couple of other
stories for you.

1645
01:00:34,712 --> 01:00:36,802
You might want to look
at the Three Little Pigs,

1646
01:00:36,877 --> 01:00:38,208
that's a good one.

1647
01:00:38,279 --> 01:00:39,799
Has a nice happy ending.

1648
01:00:39,876 --> 01:00:41,035
I'm sure you'll like that.

1649
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,543
Then there's Little
Red Riding Hood

1650
01:00:42,612 --> 01:00:44,010
although it does have
that X-rated part

1651
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,374
where the big bad wolf

1652
01:00:45,445 --> 01:00:47,410
actually eats
the grandmother,

1653
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,841
which I didn't care
for by the way.

1654
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:53,071
And finally I've often
always drawn a great deal

1655
01:00:53,143 --> 01:00:56,133
of moral comfort
from Humpty Dumpty.

1656
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:57,575
The part I like the best,

1657
01:00:57,645 --> 01:00:59,575
all the king's horses
and all the king's men

1658
01:00:59,643 --> 01:01:02,507
couldn't put Humpty Dumpty
back together again.

1659
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,543
That's because there
is no Humpty Dumpty

1660
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:06,439
and there is no God.

1661
01:01:06,509 --> 01:01:09,942
None, not one, no
God, never was.

1662
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:13,239
In fact, I'm going
to put it this way,

1663
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:14,901
if there is a God,

1664
01:01:14,978 --> 01:01:16,706
if there is a God

1665
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:21,039
may he strike this
audience dead.

1666
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,906
See nothing happened.

1667
01:01:22,977 --> 01:01:25,999
Everybody's
okay all right.

1668
01:01:26,076 --> 01:01:28,373
Tell you what,

1669
01:01:28,444 --> 01:01:30,965
tell you what I'll
raise the stakes.

1670
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:32,906
I'll raise the
stakes a little bit;

1671
01:01:32,977 --> 01:01:36,567
if there is a God may
he strike me dead.

1672
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:38,007
See nothing
happened wait

1673
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:40,668
I got a little
cramp in my leg

1674
01:01:40,743 --> 01:01:42,833
and my balls hurt.

1675
01:01:42,909 --> 01:01:45,740
Plus I'm blind.

1676
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,275
Now I'm okay again,

1677
01:01:47,343 --> 01:01:49,310
must have been
Joe Peshi.

1678
01:01:49,377 --> 01:01:51,205
God Bless Joe Peshi.

1679
01:01:51,276 --> 01:01:52,436
Thank you all very much.

1680
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,703
Joe bless you.

1681
01:01:53,774 --> 01:01:54,967
Thank you all very much.

1682
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:57,236
I appreciate it.

1683
01:02:05,076 --> 01:02:05,837
Bye bye.

1684
01:02:05,909 --> 01:02:07,000
Have fun.

1685
01:02:07,075 --> 01:02:08,132
Good.

1686
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:09,606
Thank you very much.

1687
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:21,371
Have a good time,

1688
01:02:21,442 --> 01:02:23,805
Have a good
time, thank you.
