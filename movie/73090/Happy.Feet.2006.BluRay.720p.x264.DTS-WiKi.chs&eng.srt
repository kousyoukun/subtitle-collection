用我心中那首歌

能让我的世界正常运转

把一切都给我吧

31
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,570
说说蛋宝宝，宝贝 说说你和我

我来到了新的住处

它就在孤独大街尽头的心碎旅馆
It's down at the end of Lonely Street At Heartbreak Hotel

42
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,140
我只能说“我是如此孤独，宝贝”
And I said, "I'm feeling so lonely, baby

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,870
“我是如此的孤独”
I'm feeling so lonely

44
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,340
“我是如此孤独”…
Oh, I'm feeling so lonely"...

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,510
我会活不下去的
I could die

爱情又产生了结晶
...and love became the egg.

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,420
孟菲斯？
Memphis?

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,930
抓稳了吗，亲爱的？ 嗯，好了
You got it, sugar? Yeah. Oh, yeah.

58
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,690
它既安全又暖和
Safe and warm.

59
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,360
抱紧了
Hold it tight, now.

60
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,970
哇，我觉得它动了一下
Whoa, I think I felt a move in there.

61
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,230
和往常一样
And in the usual way...

62
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,070
妈妈们在捕鱼期离开了
...the moms left for the fishing season...

63
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,480
而爸爸们则呆在家里孵蛋宝宝
...while the dads stayed home to do egg time.

64
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,910
你保证没事，孩子他爸？
You gonna be okay, Daddy?

65
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,610
噢，当然，亲爱的 我们会在寂寞大街这里等你的
Oh, sure, honey. We'll be waiting for you, right here on Lonely Street.

66
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,660
我越发的爱你了，告诉我这是为什么
I love you more and more, tell me why

67
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,120
那再见了
Bye-bye, now.

68
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,590
诺玛・珍：活跃于六七十年代的美国乡村歌手
再见，诺玛・珍,不用担心我们

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,600
不想让你走

70
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,130
永远不说再见
I never can say goodbye, boy

71
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,270
当别人都已离开
When all others leave...

72
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,510
我们还在这
...we remain!

73
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,380
当夕阳已然西下
When the sun vanishes...

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
我们还在这
...we remain!

75
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,150
我是如此孤独 我是如此孤独…
I'm feeling so lonely I'm feeling so lonely...

76
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,320
彰显智慧吧，弟兄们 大家挤在一起

Warm thy egg!

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,060
挤在一起！
Make a huddle!

79
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,430
共同抵御寒冷！ 共同抵御寒冷！
Share the cold! Share the cold.

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,370
要想在这漫漫长夜生存下来…
Each must take his turn against the icy blast...

81
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,570
大家就要轮流抵挡冰雹
...if we are to survive the endless night.

82
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,340
放开嗓子，兄弟们！
Raise your voices, brothers!

83
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,180
赞美伟大的企鹅歌神
Give praise to the Great 'Guin...

84
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,980
是它让我们心中充满了歌声 是它让我们腹中填满了鱼儿
...who puts songs in our hearts and fish in our bellies!

85
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,820
没有比这更适合我的歌曲
Ain't no particular song I'm more compatible with

86
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,400
哦，宝贝，我现在想跳舞
Oh, baby, I think I wanna dance now.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,760
不不不
No, no, no.

88
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,970
兄弟姐妹们，对我们企鹅
There is a wisdom, brothers and sisters...

89
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,510
有一条至理名言
...that stands above all others.

90
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,850
那就是无论如何… 没事的
Never, ever... It's okay.

91
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,880
…永远不要… 没受伤，瞧

…让蛋宝宝掉下来
...drop your egg.

93
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,150
我们没事，没事的
No, we're cool. We're cool.

94
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:23,110
数千只在漫漫冬夜中引颈高歌的企鹅中
Of the many thousands who sang through that long night of winter...

95
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,470
孟菲斯唱得最有激情
...it was Memphis who cried out most fervently...

96
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,780
是它的歌声转动了地球，带回了阳光
...to turn the Earth and bring back the sun.

97
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,090
是个男孩 嘿，是个女孩
It's a boy! Hey, it's a girl!

98
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,280
多么苗条！ 多么粗犷！
What a peach! What a bruiser!

99
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,620
过来，儿子 来爸爸这儿，过来啊
Come here, son. Come to Daddy, there you go.

100
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,700
儿子，你太让爸爸骄傲了
Son, you have made your daddy so proud.

101
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,700
你知道吗，这都是遗传的
It's all genetics, you know.

102
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,540
孟菲斯？
Memphis?

103
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,480
一切都还好吧？
Is everything okay?

104
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,150
我不知道，我什么也听不见
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

105
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,350
是空包蛋？ 宝贝儿
Is it empty? Honey.

106
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,620
能给我吗？ 葛露亚
Can I have it? Gloria.

107
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,950
没事，莫里斯
It's okay, Maurice.

108
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,360
有时候是这样的，孟菲斯
It happens sometimes, Memphis.

109
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,060
是啊
Yeah.

110
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,770
等等，你听到了吗？
Wait, you hear that?

111
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,670
嗯 嘿，我听到你了，小家伙
Yeah. Hey, I can hear you, buddy.

112
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,840
噢，爸爸在这儿，没事的
Oh, your papa's here, it's okay.

113
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,950
噢，他没事，莫里斯 哈，他出来了
Oh, he's okay, Maurice. Whoa, there it is!

114
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,360
那是他的小脚
That's his little foot there.

115
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,830
还有另一只
There's his other one.

116
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,600
怎么有点不大一样
That's different.

117
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,670
嘿，回来啊，曼波先生
Hey! Come back here, Mr. Mumble.

118
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,830
葛露亚…
Gloria...

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,060
她总是这样随便给人家起名字
She can call him whatever the heck she likes.

120
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,070
哦，小曼波
Whoa, little Mumble.

121
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,340
曼波，曼波？ 你没事吧？
Mumble? Mumble? You okay?

122
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,280
冷…冷….
Freezing. Freezing.

123
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,750
哦，你会习惯的
Oh, you'll get used to it.

124
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,120
来，到爸爸这儿来
Come on. Come to your daddy.

125
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,050
你看他是怎么回事？ 好像站得不大稳
What do you make of that? Little wobbly in the knees.

126
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,420
他没事吧？ 我也不知道
Is he okay? I don't know.

127
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,890
你在干嘛呢，孩子？
What you doing there, boy?

128
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,360
我很快乐，爸爸
I'm happy, Pa.

129
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,570
你的脚怎么了？
What you doing with your feet?

130
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,690
它们也很快乐
They're happy too.

131
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,400
我在别人面前不会这么做的，孩子 为什么？
I wouldn't do that around folks, son. Why not?

132
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,440
这个，这样不像企鹅，知道吗？ 好吧
Well, it just ain't penguin, okay? Okay.

133
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,980
来，过来，到爸爸这里暖和一下
Yeah. Hey, come on over here. Get under here. Get warm.

134
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,410
小心尖嘴，小心尖…
Watch the beak. Watch the beak... Beak!

135
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,020
嘴…
The beak.

136
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,920
好了，乖孩子
Okay, good boy.

137
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,090
这么晚了，她们遇到什么事了？
So late. What's keeping them?

138
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,060
祷告吧，兄弟们 伟大的企鹅歌神不会用食物短缺来考验我们
Pray, brothers, the Great 'Guin does not test us with a lean season.

139
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,830
为什么，诺亚？难道我们还不够恭顺吗？
Why, Noah? Have we not all been dutiful?

140
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,240
看到妈妈的时候…
So when you see your mama...

141
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,530
我要站得笔直 说对了
I stand perfectly still. You got it.

142
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,440
但我怎么知道哪个是妈妈？
But how will I know which one's my mama?

143
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,700
哦，你会知道的
Oh, you'll know.

144
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,680
她走路时一摇一摆 说话时经常咯咯地笑
She's got a wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk.

145
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,490
她唱歌的时候 你的心都会被震颤不已
And when she sings, it darn near breaks your heart.

146
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,990
嘿，等等，我看到她们了，看到了！
Hey, wait. I see them. I see them!

147
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,390
没错，是她们！
You're right! You're right!

148
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,790
老婆们，噢！
Wives, ho!

149
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,860
老婆们，噢！
Wives, ho!

150
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,930
老婆们，噢！
Wives, ho!

151
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,830
等等，不，曼波，回来 别…曼波，回来…曼波！
Wait, no. Wait, no, Mumble, get back here. No, Mumble! Get back... Mumble!

152
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,270
曼波，曼波！
Mumble! Mumble!

153
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,170
曼波！
Mumble!

154
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,810
蜜雪儿，蜜雪儿？
Michelle? Michelle?

155
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,420
罗珊尼？ 蜜雪儿？
Roxanne? Michelle?

156
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,350
阿尔菲？
Alfie?

157
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,690
莫里斯！ 蜜雪儿，蜜雪儿！
Maurice! Michelle! Michelle!

158
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,020
妈妈！
Mommy!

159
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,790
噢，她太讨人喜欢了
Oh, she's so darling.

160
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,630
借过，借过，打扰了 曼波，曼波？
Excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me. Mumble? Mumble?

161
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,830
曼波
Oh, Mumble.

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,340
妈妈？ 曼波！
Mama? Mumble!

163
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,670
妈妈？ 曼波！
Mama? Mumble!

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,210
曼波！
Mumble!

165
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,640
妈妈，妈妈？
Mama? Mama?

166
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,870
曼波，孩子，你在哪儿？ 妈妈！
Mumble, boy, where are you? Mama!

167
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,580
孟菲斯？
Memphis?

168
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,650
噢，孩子他妈 噢，孩子他妈
Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama.

169
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,520
噢，上帝 孩子他爸
Oh, my. Daddy.

170
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,660
我们的孩子在哪儿呢？
So where's the baby?

171
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,130
亲爱的，我会找到他的
Well, honey, I'll find him.

172
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,390
你把宝宝丢了？孟菲斯！ 没事的
You lost the baby? Memphis! It's okay.

173
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,430
妈妈，妈妈？ 站住！
Mama? Mama? Stay!

174
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,500
来妈妈这儿 不，曼波
Come to Mommy. No, Mumble.

175
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,770
妈妈，妈妈
Mama, Mama.

176
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,140
嘿，他的脚怎么了？
Hey, what's wrong with his feet?

177
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,040
哦，一点小毛病，长大就好了
Oh, that's just a little thing he's got going. He'll grow out of it.

178
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,120
妈妈！
Mama!

179
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,920
噢，孟菲斯，他太漂亮了
Oh, Memphis, he's gorgeous.

180
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,790
可不是吗？ 看看你
Isn't he, though? Look at you.

181
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,950
我给你带了东西
I got something for you.

182
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,860
张开嘴
Open up.

183
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,060
哦，我就喜欢看你喂食的样子
Oh, I love the way she does that.

184
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,510
W，X，Y和Z
W, X, Y and Z

185
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,870
早上好，同学们
Good morning, class.

186
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,410
早上好，维奥拉小姐
Good morning, Miss Viola.

187
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,570
好的
Right.

188
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,150
那么，今天我们要上企鹅小学里
Well, today we begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn...

189
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,610
最重要的一堂课
...at Penguin Elementary.

190
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,450
有谁知道是什么吗？
Does anyone know what that is?

191
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,880
谁知道？谁知道？
Anyone? Anyone?

192
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,040
谁？西摩？
Someone? Seymour?

193
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,120
钓鱼吗？ 不是
Fishing? No.

194
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,660
曼波？
Mumble?

195
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,420
不要吃黄色的雪？
Don't eat yellow snow?

196
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,990
不，不是的
No, that's not it, no.

197
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,330
是心灵之歌，小姐 谢谢你，葛露亚，好极了，没错
It's our Heartsong, Miss. Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes.

198
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,370
没有心灵之歌，我们就不能称为真正的企鹅 大家说对不对？
Without our Heartsong, we can't be truly penguin, can we?

199
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,330
对
No.

200
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,870
但是，亲爱的孩子们 事实上这不是我可以教会你们的
But, my dears, it's not something that I can actually teach you.

201
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,440
有人知道为什么吗？ 谁知道，谁知道？
Does anybody know why? Anyone? Anyone?

202
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,270
你之所以不能教给我们，夫人…
You can't teach it to us, ma'am...

203
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,080
…是因为心灵之歌必须由我们自己去寻找
...because we have to find our Heartsongs all by ourselves.

204
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,240
说得好
Well done, you.

205
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,080
这是你在内心深处所听到的…
It's the voice you hear inside...

206
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,840
…真正的自我
...who you truly are.

207
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,550
对，谢谢你，葛露亚 好极了，谢谢你
Yes. Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, lovely, thank you.

208
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,090
那现在让我们安静一下
So let's all be very still now.

209
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,520
等一会儿，你就会感受得到
Take a moment and let it come to you.

210
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,790
我听到了！ 我来
I got one! Pick me!

211
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,900
我来！我来！ 一次一个，西摩，你先来
Pick me! Pick me! One at a time. Yes, Seymour.

212
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,200
别再逼我，我已快要发疯
Don't push me 'Cause I am close to the edge

213
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,310
我不想让毛掉光
I'm trying not to lose my head

214
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,440
嗯，我喜欢 听起来让我觉得很美，亲爱的
Yes, I like that one. I could really get jiggy with that. Lovely.

215
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,200
我准备好了，我听到了
I'm ready. I got one.

216
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,940
噢，我想也是，葛露亚
Oh, I thought you might, Gloria.

217
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,820
夜色如此曼妙
Midnight creeps so slowly

218
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,420
慢慢撒进那些
Into hearts of those

219
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,190
依然渴望的心灵里
Who need more than they get

220
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,260
白昼的赌局
Daylight deals a bad hand

221
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:35,060
下注太多的企鹅 一手烂牌
To a penguin. Who has laid too many bets

222
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,030
我只能想到这么多了
That's as far as I got so far.

223
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,800
噢，好，太好了，真的太棒了 棒极了
Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely. That's beautiful.

224
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,240
曼波，看起来你等不及想和大家分享了
Well, Mumble, since you seem so keen to share.

225
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,980
我想唱的是“砰”的一声，然后…
Mine's sort of a boom and a:

226
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,990
又是“砰”的一声
And another boom.

227
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,280
这就是你在心里听到的？
You heard that in there?

228
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,120
你喜欢吗？ 哦！这不成旋律
Do you like it? I'm afraid that's not a tune.

229
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,150
不算？ 是的，亲爱的，旋律应该是这样的
It's not? No, dear. A tune is like:

230
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,630
哦，好的
Oh, okay.

231
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,670
那是谁？
Who is that?

232
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,680
他是孟菲斯和诺玛・珍的孩子
That is the offspring of Memphis and Norma Jean.

233
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,400
一只小袋鼠 （小袋鼠：四五十年代的一个卡通角色）
The wee hippity-hopper.

234
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,810
这不好笑！
It's not funny!

235
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,010
对，对，一点也不好笑
No. No, not in the least.

236
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,650
没有心灵之歌的企鹅很难算是企鹅
A penguin without a Heartsong is hardly a penguin at all.

237
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,260
他把我耳朵都震坏了
I think he broke my ear.

238
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,130
这么多年了，我从来没，我是说…
In all my years, I've never, I mean...

239
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,900
而且你的声音这么好 哎，太奇怪了
And you having such fine voices. Well, it's bizarre.

240
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,600
发生过什么事吗？我是指早期发育的时候
Did anything happen, you know, during early development?

241
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,210
没有，一切都很好，很正常的孵化
No, all fine. Normal incubation.

242
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,710
好 是吧，亲爱的？
Right. Wasn't it, honey?

243
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,470
对，对，我想可能是这个冬天太寒冷了
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter, I guess.

244
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,640
没错，没错
Right, right.

245
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,280
不过他的确比较晚才孵出来… 嗯，我理解
He did hatch a little late... Yes, I understand. Yes.

246
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,510
一想到他会孤独一生… 小声点，小声点
To think he might spend his life alone... Quite, quite.

247
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,850
…永远都不会遇到真爱
...never to meet his one true love.

248
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,220
噢，拜托，维奥拉小姐 我们可以做什么吗？
Oh, please, Miss Viola, isn't there something we can do?

249
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,850
嗯，幸好还有爱丝特坎太太
Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan.

250
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,020
爱丝特坎太太？
Mrs. Astrakhan?

251
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,960
只要是能办到的事 爱丝特坎太太都能办到
If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can.

252
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,570
不会唱歌？
Can't sing?

253
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,010
不会唱歌？ 真失败，亲爱的
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.

254
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,810
每只小企鹅都有一支心灵之歌
Every little penguin has a song.

255
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,610
教会你以后…
When I have finished...

256
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,450
…你的歌声会让每个人起鸡皮疙瘩
...your singing will be giving everyone the goose pimple.

257
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,520
好，现在开始 首先，我们必须找到一种感觉
Now, to begin. First, we must find a feeling.

258
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,820
开心的感觉，伤心的感觉
Happy feeling, sad feeling.

259
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,330
也或许是孤独的感觉
Maybe lonely feeling.

260
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,700
你感觉到了吗？
You feel it?

261
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,890
好的，现在唱出来吧
Good. Now, let it out.

262
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,760
要自然
Be spontaneous.

263
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,010
那，那是什么？
That, what is that?

264
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,370
我觉得很自然啊
I'm being spontan-you-us.

265
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,650
亲爱的，你想和美丽的女孩约会吗？
Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl?

266
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,180
你想要蛋宝宝吗？
You want to make the egg?

267
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,440
哦，想啊
Oh, yes.

268
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,020
那就唱！不要晃来晃去，别乱动
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog. Do not move muscle.

269
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,320
呆在原地！
No moving!

270
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,530
一闪，一闪，亮晶晶
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

271
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,290
够了！
Enough!

272
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,660
好，我们重头开始
Okay. We go back to the top.

273
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,760
忘记身体，用内心来感受
Forget body. Look inside soul.

274
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,640
感受那种感情，强烈的感情
Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling.

275
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:31,180
它是如此强烈，充满了你的身体
So enormous it fills whole body.

276
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,610
它必须被释放出来，否则你就会爆炸
It must escape or you explode.

277
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,620
现在，张开你的小嘴 快啊
Now, open your little beak. Come on.

278
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,920
对，对，抬起头来，就这样
Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it.

279
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,390
现在，现在…
Now... Now...

280
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,260
就现在！
Now

281
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,530
鬼啊！太恐怖了！
Disaster! Catastrophe!

282
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,960
我从没有失败过
I never fail before.

283
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,260
从来没有，从来没有！
Never! Never!

284
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,310
不过，这样也挺可爱的 但企鹅不能这样，知道吗？
Well, I thought it was kind of cute. But it just ain't penguin, okay?

285
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,750
那他要是就是有点不一样呢？ 我一直就喜欢有点与众不同
So what if he's a little different? I always kind of liked different.

286
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,580
他跟别人没什么不一样的 就是一只普通的帝企鹅
He's not different. He's a regular emperor penguin.

287
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,780
嘿，知道吗？我可以不去上学
Hey, you know what? I can leave school.

288
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,150
我可以去干活，我们一家三口一起
I can go to work. The three of us.

289
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,160
哦，小朋友 在你接受完教育之前哪里也不要去
Whoa, little fella. You ain't going nowhere till you got yourself an education.

290
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,260
你要学会唱的有力而响亮，知道吗？
You get them singing muscles big and strong, you got that?

291
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,560
我会努力的，爸爸
I'll try, Pa.

292
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,230
你最好如此 成功的第一个字是成，第二个字是…
You bet you will. The word "triumph" starts with "try," and it ends with...

293
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,070
“功” 没错，大大的“功”字
"Umph." That's right. A great big "umph."

294
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,400
我要去捕鱼了
I'm going fishing.

295
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,540
噢，曼波
Oh, Mumble.

296
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,720
那是第一个艰难的夏天
That first hard summer...

297
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,920
当他的爸爸妈妈在家和大海之间来回奔波…
...while his mom and dad were working overtime...

298
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,000
…加班加点工作时…
...on the great commute to the sea...

299
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,500
…曼波找到了一个可以远离菲薄…
...Mumble found a place away from disapproving eyes...

300
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:37,130
…尽情展现自我的地方
...where a funky little fella could be himself.

301
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,230
嘿，你在那儿干嘛呢，带蹼的鸟？
Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird?

302
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,630
没事，你们在干嘛呢？
Nothing. What are you doing?

303
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,630
没事，路过吃点午饭而已
Nothing. Just dropped in for a little lunch.

304
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,530
有吃的？这里？
There's food? Here?

305
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,630
腿还是翅膀？
Leg or wing?

306
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,240
不不不，等等，不会是我吧，我是企鹅啊
Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I'm a penguin.

307
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,110
一点没错，带蹼的鸟 就是你，吃鱼的家伙
Exactly. The flipper birds, that's you, eat the fish.

308
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,810
会飞的鸟，也就是我 吃的是带蹼的鸟和鱼
The flying birds, that's me, eat the flipper bird and the fish.

309
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,220
但最近，没什么鱼吃了
And lately, there ain't a lot of fish.

310
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,480
所以… 这次我要吃有汁的那块
So... This time I'm getting the juicy bits.

311
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,060
我先来！ 嘿，你要和我抢？
Me first! Hey, you want a piece of me?

312
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,890
嘿嘿嘿，我在考虑午饭的事情
Hey, hey, hey! I'm trying to think about lunch.

313
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,260
等等！看看这个！
Wait! Watch this!

314
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,630
嗯，是挺奇怪的，好吧，你听着 我就破一次例，文明地解决这件事
Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen. For once, we're gonna do this civilized.

315
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,500
现在，准备好… 嘿！你腿上那是什么？
Now, get in line... Hey! What's that on your leg?

316
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,710
什么？这个小东西？ 哦，天，别跟他提那个
What? This little thing? Oh, no. Don't start him on that.

317
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,010
闭嘴！这只小蹼鸟问了我一个很敏感的问题
Shut up! The little flipper bird asked me a perceptive question.

318
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,880
一个必须给出答案的问题 又来了
A question like that deserves an answer. Here we go.

319
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,720
我送你两个词：
I got two words for you:

320
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,950
异形绑架
"Alien abduction."

321
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,820
噢，你得继续问了 可怜啊
Oh, you had to ask. Have mercy.

322
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,860
安静！
Quiet!

323
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,430
小朋友，这世上有一种东西
Now, little buddy, there is something out there.

324
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,690
一种生物，跟我们不一样的生物
Creatures. Not like us.

325
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,100
更大，更凶猛，当然也更聪明
Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too.

326
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,760
问我是怎么知道的 你怎么知道？
Ask me how I know. How?

327
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,100
因为我被他们捉到过，这就是原因
Because I've been captured by them, that's how.

328
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,300
难以置信
Unbelievable.

329
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,450
“难以置信”什么意思？ 这就是事实
What do you mean "unbelievable?" It's true.

330
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,840
当时我正坐在石头上，干自己的事…
I'm sitting on a rock, minding my own business...

331
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,610
…突然间，他们就来到了我头顶上
...when suddenly, they're onto me.

332
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,910
那些生物，长得跟丑陋的大企鹅似的
These beings, like big ugly penguins.

333
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,210
又肥又胖，松弛的脸上正面安着一双眼睛
Fat, flabby faces with front-ways eyes...

334
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,790
…没羽毛，没有喙 还有这个看来像附属品的东西
...no feathers, no beaks, and these... These appendages.

335
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,650
他们为了检查我，把我绑了起来
They probe me. They tie me up. They strap me down.

336
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,690
然后拿出一个尖尖的东西插进我身体
They take this pointy thing and they stick it into me.

337
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,420
再然后，我就晕了过去
And then, blackout.

338
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,000
天呐
Gosh.

339
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,100
我醒来之后 就在腿上发现了这个…这个东西
I woke up and there's this... This thing on me.

340
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,500
每只会飞的鸟都鄙视我，说 “嘿，发生什么了，黄腿？”
Every flying bird is dissing me, "Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"

341
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,670
真是对我的羞辱
It was humiliating.

342
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,000
然后呢？
And then what?

343
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,210
它们羞辱我，还不够么？
It was humiliating. What more do you want?

344
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,340
它们本来可以吃了你的
They could have eated you.

345
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,480
是啊，是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,890
我猜可能是我可怜的哀号 唤醒了他们内心善良的本性吧
I guess my pitiful cries for mercy appealed to their better nature.

347
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,230
那我能唤醒你更善良的本性吗？
Can I appeal to your better nature?

348
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,190
想得很好，孩子，但…不可能
Nice try, kid, but no.

349
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,300
不，不，不！
No. No. No!

350
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,300
你在下面干嘛，带蹼鸟？
What you doing down there, flipper bird?

351
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,460
上来啊
Get up here.

352
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,270
马上给我上来
Get back up here this minute.

353
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,600
噢，好极了，是你放他走的，没错吧？
Oh, great. You let him get away. Didn't you?

354
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,070
都是因为你，说什么异形
All your screwy alien talk.

355
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,510
嘿，我可被诱拐过 那你去诱拐他啊
Hey, I'm an abductee. Abduct this.

356
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,310
小心我去叫安吉叔叔 噢，好吧
Don't make me call Uncle Angie. Oh, fine.

357
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,580
你们这是干嘛呢?我可是被诱拐过！
Where youse going? I'm an abductee!

358
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,310
我才不管你怎么了呢，我饿死了！ 想知道我们有什么特色菜吗？
I don't care what you are, I'm hungry! Would you like to hear our specials?

359
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,760
吃鱼怎么样？我们没有鱼 吃企鹅怎么样？我们没有企鹅
How about fish? There's no fish. How about penguin? There's no penguin.

360
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,920
那我们能吃啥？
What are we gonna eat?!

361
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,440
我想去的那个世界
There's a world where I can go

362
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,950
那是我可以倾诉秘密的地方
And tell my secrets to

363
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
在我自己的空间里
In my room

364
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,890
他并没有留意自己那颗舞动的心
Paying no mind to his dancing heart...

365
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,390
…学业以垫底的分数结束…
...the kid saw out his school days at the back of the class...

366
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,590
…他迷失在了自己的想象之中
...lost in his imaginings.

367
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,430
天色已经暗下，我…
Now it's dark and I'm...

368
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,630
冰天雪地的彼端 会是怎样一个奇妙的世界呢？
What fabulous worlds lay out there, far beyond the ice?

369
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,800
我不会害怕
I won't be afraid

370
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,780
这只没有心灵之歌的小企鹅
Was there any place...

371
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,440
能否拥有一片
...where one small penguin without a Heartsong...

372
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,310
真正属于自己的天空呢？
...could ever truly belong?

373
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,250
在我自己的空间里
In my room

374
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,230
在遥远的上古
And so, a thousand generations ago...

375
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,930
我们的先祖为了蹼而抛弃了翅膀
...our forefathers forsook our wings for flippers.

376
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,130
你们这些毕业生将会从第一次入海中…
You graduates going to sea for the first time...

377
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,010
…体会到祖先们的明智抉择 给你们带来的无尽益处
...are to reap the benefits of their wise choice.

378
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,210
虽然生活时而坎坷，充满变数
These are lean and uncertain times.

379
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,150
但祖先们智慧的力量…
But by the power of the ancient penguin wisdoms...

380
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,410
…将会与我们，我的同胞们，永远同在
...we, my brethren, will endure.

381
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,390
诺玛・珍
@%$&$ "Blah, blah, blah." Norma Jean.

382
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,460
谁敢说我们的儿子不能毕业？ 他又没有影响别人
Who is he to say my boy can't graduate? He's not hurting anyone.

383
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,160
…都是正确的 你们永远都会为我们这个勇敢的企鹅民族…
True to our ways and you will always be won'thy of this...

384
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:08,460
…而感到骄傲自豪，万岁！
...our brave penguin nation. Excelsior!

385
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,480
大海，我来了！
Ocean, here I come!

386
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,850
知道吗，我们要自己举办一个毕业典礼
You know what? We're gonna have a little graduation ceremony of our own.

387
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,390
你说真的吗，妈妈？ 当然啦
You mean it, Ma? You betcha.

388
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,220
万岁！ 万岁！
Excelsior! Excelsior!

389
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,930
小声点
Keep it down.

390
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,530
爸 孟菲斯
Pa. Memphis.

391
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,140
去抓鱼吧，小子 谢谢，妈妈
Go get them, tiger. Thanks, Ma.

392
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,070
别太晚回来！ 知道了，妈妈
Make every moment count! Got you, Ma!

393
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,340
记住，“危险的陌生人” 嗯，记住了，爸爸
Remember, "Stranger Danger." Yeah, sure, Pa.

394
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,710
还有，小心海豹和虎鲸
And watch out for those leopard seals and them killer whales.

395
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,250
记住了，诺亚
Mark this, Noah.

396
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,920
这小子永远是不详之兆 我敢说不会有什么好事发生的
That boy was always a bad egg. I'm telling you, no good will come of this.

397
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,330
伙计们！
Guys!

398
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,270
等等！
Wait up!

399
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,960
你看咋办？
What do you think?

400
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,900
你先吧 不，还是你先
You first. No, you first.

401
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,500
不，不，不！
No. No, no, no.

402
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,270
别推我
Stop pushing!

403
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,150
那是什么？ 是那个毛球小子吧

404
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,420
看到血了吗？
See any blood?

405
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,730
你们还等什么？

406
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,550

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,250
不好意思，我不是故意…
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

411
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,950
小心，躲开！
Fall back, coming through!

412
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,410

Gloria? All my life, I've wanted to say that you're so...

413
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,640
鱼！ 对，你是如此像鱼

418
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,760
抱歉
Sorry.

419
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,170
葛露亚，你抢到了吗？
Gloria. You got one?

420
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,810
没，下次吧 这只给你
Nope. Not this time. You have it.

421
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,670
谢谢你，曼波，但它是你的 我就是要给你
Thank you, Mumble, but it's yours. I want you to have it.

422
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,510

426
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,100
你让他跑了！
You just let him get away!

427
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,850
他还在呼吸吗？ 我肯定他没在吃鱼
Is he breathing? He's certainly not eating.

428
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,420
曼波，你没事吧？
Mumble? Are you okay?

看看你自己

看看镜子，低声哭泣
Take a look in the mirror and cry a little

443
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,960
主啊，为何如此对我
Lord, what you doing to me?

444
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,040
我一生追随于你
I spent all my years in believing you

445
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,650
为何还是如此痛苦 主啊
I just can't get no relief, Lord

但大家仍然责难于我

454
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,100
他们说，他们说，我太过痴狂

没有共同语言，再无人让我追随
Got no common sense I got nobody left to believe in

537
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,890
那不是石头，大哥，那是爱的宝石

00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,600
像这样
You know:

540
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,790
你们对女孩子不感兴趣吗？
You're not interested in chicas?

541
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,270
嘿，嘿，嘿 你没搞错吧？
Hey, hey, hey. You kidding?

542
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,430
没有我们，女生跟谁搞？
Without us, the chicas got no boom.

543
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,170
那你们几个为什么不去捡鹅卵石？ 鹅卵石有个鸟用，兄弟
Why aren't you collecting pebbles? Pebbles, schmebbles, man.

544
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,940
我们有个性，叛逆 知道为啥不？因为我们性感
We got personality, with a capital Y. Why? Because we're hot.

545
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,880
学着点，高个子
Watch and learn, tall boy.

546
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,710
嘿，嘿，宝贝 过来，我的小妞
Hey. Hey, baby. Over here, mama. Chicky baby.

547
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,320
宝贝 你看什么呢？
Baby. What are you looking at?

548
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,110
在看我吗？ 过来我这儿
You looking at me? Come over here.

549
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,920
来啊，美女 不觉得我很有魅力么，嗯？
Come on, mami. You see something you like, yes?

550
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,620
不觉得，今晚没空，宝贝
I don't think so. Not tonight, baby.

551
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,420
噢，不要这么傲慢嘛，美臀
Oh, don't be so snooty, booty.

552
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,430
我知道你喜欢这个，喜欢这个
That's the way... you like it, you like it

553
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,500
你想要，我给你 得不到，别怪我
You want it, I got it Could've had it, you missed it

554
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,600
看我的脚，哈
Look at the feet, huh?

555
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,900
你们从哪儿学的？ 这个大个子
Where'd you learn that? The big guy.

556
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,600
他从别处来的 他跟我们一伙的
He from out of town. He with us.

557
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,270
再做给我们看看 宝贝，再给我们看看你那双动感的脚
Do it again. Do it, baby. Show me those flipping feet.

558
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,110
不不不，抱歉，美女们 改天吧
No, no, no. Sorry, girls. Some other time maybe.

559
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,050
你们几个脑袋进水了，明白吗？
You guys are soft in the head, okay?

560
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,580
我们走吧
Let's go.

561
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,850
这叫欲擒故纵，知道不？ 等到时机成熟再说
Leave them wanting more, you know? Hold back till the season.

562
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,790
话都放出来了 要么有真行，要么就是吹牛
You show them what you got. Either you got it or not.

563
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,590
咱哥几个呢？ 当然不是吹的
And the Amigos? We got it!

564
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,030
你看我对她们有吸引力吗？
You think I could get some of it?

565
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,000
大哥，你已经很有吸引力啦 你是个“危险角色”，宝贝
Hombre, you've got so much already, you dangerous, baby.

566
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,730
你真的这么觉得么？
You really think so?

567
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,640
你在开玩笑吧？像你这样的舞步…
You kidding? With moves like yours...

568
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,280
…那些女士们绝对会拜倒在你的大脚下的
...you must have all the ladies drooling at your feet.

569
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,610
我可不这么觉得 听听，这小子太可爱了
I wouldn't say that. Oh, listen to him. He's so cute.

570
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,280
这么跟你说吧
Let me tell something to you.

571
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,560
除了我之外，你是这里最有魅力的男人
Except for me, tall boy, you got the most charisma of anybody.

572
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,250
别自以为是了，雷蒙 你这么说会让我很伤心的
Put that ego away, Ramon, you're gonna hurt someone.

573
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,330
嫉妒了吧，等等 我听到有人想要什么
You so jealous. Just a moment. I hear people wanting something.

574
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,590
是我！
Me!

575
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,190
曼博 来吧，小妞们，来跳曼博
Mambo Okay, you girlies, Mambo

576
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,900
再来一次，曼博，曼博，曼博！
One more time now, mambo Mambo, mambo, mambo

577
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,070
曼博！
Mambo!

578
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,320
该你了，该你了
Your turn, your turn.

579
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,230
哦，下来
Oh, get down.

580
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,440
噢，没想到这家伙这么会耍酷
Man, this guy is so accidentally cool.

581
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,440
好吧，好吧
Okay, okay.

582
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,740
妈妈！
Mama!

583
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,960
妈咪！
Mommy!

584
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,220
来吧，毛球
Come on, Fluffy.

585
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,820
哦，我爱死地心引力了
Oh, I love gravity.

586
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,330
哦，我觉得像是在缅怀过去 缅…怀？
Oh, I feel like reminiscing. Remin-icing?

587
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,750
差一点点啊 快走，快走
It was too close. Come on, come on.

588
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,420
嘿，伙计们，我们去哪儿啊？
Hey, guys! Where are we going?

589
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,720
我们要转移了 也就是要换个住处
We relocating. Placing ourselves elsewhere.

590
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,860
但刚才那个，是什么？ 我们怎么会知道？
But that thing, what was it? How should we know?

591
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,430
我们是企鹅 很小的企鹅
We're penguins. Very little penguins.

592
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,560
但那是哪里来的？ 真奇怪啊，像是异形
But where did it come from? It's so weird, so alien.

593
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,140
他在说啥？ 好像在说一个叫易欣的兄弟
What's he talking about? Some hombre called Elian.

594
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,770
我不知道有叫易欣的 倒是有个叫依迅的
I don't know a guy Elian. I knew a guy named Estevan...

595
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,270
不是依讯，是易欣啦 看来我们是解不开这个谜了
Not Estevan, Elian. Guys, we have a mystery here.

596
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,570
真是一个令人难以置信的谜啊
A mind-boggling mystery.

597
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,680
然后呢？我们该做些啥？
So? What are we supposed to do about it?

598
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:15,080
朋友们，我们得到那东西底下去
Amigos, we gotta get to the bottom of this thing.

599
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,720
大个子，过来我跟你说几句话 靠近点，别怕
Big guy, let me tell something to you. Come close. Don't be afraid.

600
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,090
你想知道答案？ 对
You want answers? Yeah.

601
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,620
没别的愿望了？ 没了
That's all you need? Yeah.

602
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:25,780
真没了？ 没了
Nothing else? No.

603
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,330
那就很简单了
Then this is very easy.

604
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,660
去问爱拉斯吧
You go see Lovelace.

605
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,430
爱拉斯 去找爱拉斯
Lovelace. Go see Lovelace.

606
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,590
雷蒙，你真是天才啊，不愧是大哥 谢谢
Genius, Ramon. You are the man. Thank you.

607
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,530
我要陶醉一下 走吧
I take a moment for myself. Let's go.

608
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,970
鞠躬 大哥
Bow down. You the man.

609
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,470
行了，我感觉到你们的爱了 谁是爱拉斯？
That's enough, I feel your love. Who's Lovelace?

610
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,970
爱拉斯是大师 去找爱拉斯
Lovelace is the guru. Go see Lovelace.

611
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,240
他能回答一切问题 所有一切
He got the answer to everything. Everything.

612
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,510
真的吗？ 问他吧，一问一个准
Really? Ask him, he never wrong.

613
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,950
但你得带个鹅卵石去
But first, you gonna need a pebble.

614
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,050
等等，我要先警告听众一下
Hold it, y'all. I have a warning for the audience.

615
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,190
女士们，请把视线移开一下…
Ladies, please, avert your eyes...

616
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,700
…因为我善于催眠
...because I've been known to hypnotize.

617
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:10,000
你们听见这个声音了 现在就将要见到…
You heard the voice, now you're about to meet...

618
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:14,200
…这独一无二的爱拉斯 站在人群之中…
...the one and only Lovelace, in the flesh...

619
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,440
…就在这里，就是现在
...right here, right on, right now.

620
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,950
请显示你的虔诚
The devotion, please.

621
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:24,850
好的
Oh, yeah.

622
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,550
现在说出你的问题吧
And now, your question.

623
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,160
爱拉斯先生…
Senor Lovelace...

624
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,850
…我老婆失踪了，她还活着吗？
...my wife has disappeared. Is she alive?

625
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,760
她还活着吗？ 让真相在歌声中显现吧
Is she alive now? Separate the truth from the jive

626
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,530
告诉我吧，神仙啊
Speak to me, oh, mystic beings

627
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,900
她还开心地活着，并且还记得你
Yes! She's happy and you're in her thoughts.

628
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,810
她有别的男人了吗？
Is she with another male?

629
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,910
一颗鹅卵石换一个问题，下一个！
One pebble, one question. Next!

630
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,110
哦，大师 请问一下神仙…
Oh, Serene One. Please ask the mystic beings...

631
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,880
…我有可能像你一样富有吗？
...will I ever be as rich as you?

632
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,350
在梦里会的，吉恩，下一个！
In your dreams, Jean. Next!

633
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
去啊，去啊 上去啊，大个子
Go ahead. Go ahead. Get up there, big guy.

634
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:08,560
没错，别怕 先生们，安静！一个一个来
That's it. Don't be scared. Gentleman, please! One at a time.

635
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,660
我们一起的 对，一起的
We with him. Yeah, we together.

636
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,270
他有一个很好的问题，快 说啊
He got a beautiful question. Go. Do it.

637
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,960
别跟他对视就好了
Just don't look him in the eye.

638
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,130
你被异形绑架过吗？
Have you ever been abducted by aliens?

639
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,130
你说什么？ 这是什么鬼问题？下一个！
Excuse me? What kind of question is that? Next!

640
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,300
不，等等，先生
No, wait, senor.

641
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,380
我见过一只贼鸥，他脚上也有这么个东西 他说他被异形绑架过
I met a skua once, with something like that on his foot, said he was abducted by aliens.

642
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:30,720
朋友，这是我神圣的护身符…
This, friend, is my sacred talisman...

643
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,420
护身符，护身符
Talisman, talisman

644
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:37,250
…是神仙…
...bestowed on me by the mystic beings...

645
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,950
神仙…
Mystic beings

646
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,030
在我前往禁闭海滩开悟的史诗般征途中…
...during my epic journey of enlightenment...

647
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,320
…赐予我的…
...to the forbidden shore.

648
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,800
禁闭海滩
Forbidden shore

649
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,000
哦，再来一遍
Oh, say it one more.

650
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,730
禁闭海滩 噢，耶
Forbidden shore Oh, yeah

651
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,810
等等，你见到了神仙？
Wait, you saw mystic beings?

652
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,280
我听到了！他们通过我传话！
I hear them! They speak through me!

653
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,510
噢，耶
Oh, yeah.

654
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,680
那种力量让我能够站在这座塔上！
There's a power that makes me stand upon this tower!

655
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,880
他们是不是眼睛长在前面？ 他们检查你了吗？把你绑起来了吗？
Did they have front-ways eyes? Did they probe you? Strap you down?

656
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,460
够了！“他们检查你了吗？”
Enough! "Did they probe me?"

657
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,430
问题太多了，你的鹅卵石不够，傻子！
Too many questions! You don't have enough pebbles, fool.

658
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,800
但你一个问题都还没回答呢
You haven't answered any of my questions.

659
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,560
他还有完没完？ 我们都有事要问呐！
How many questions he got? We've all got stuff to ask!

660
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,500
够了！
Enough!

661
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,540
你们把这个陌生人带到我面前
You bring this stranger before me.

662
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:36,280
他置疑我的权威 把我和贼鸥相提并论
He doubts my powers. He compares me to a skua.

663
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,640
我脑子里有一个声音在呐喊
The voices are shrieking in my head.

664
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,720
那就是，爱拉斯，这个白痴是谁？
They say, "Lovelace, who is this fool?

665
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,390
“告诉他！告诉他一边去繁衍后代吧！”
Tell him! Tell him to go forth and multiply!"

666
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,150
说到这儿…
Come to think of it...

667
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:53,100
…我们为什么不都去繁衍后代呢？
...why don't we all go forth and multiply?

668
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,430
爱拉斯 他在说什么？
Lovelace. What he saying?

669
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,400
交配期到了 这么快？
It's mating season. Already?

670
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,600
我现在要去后宫好好“休息”了
I will retire now to my couch of perpetual indulgence.

671
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,210
好吧，美女们，谁先来？ 我！
Okay, ladies, who's first? Me!

672
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,140
一个一个来 别碰护身符好吗，宝贝们
One at a time. Don't touch the talisman, baby, please.

673
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,580
嘿，等等，等等 我们怎么办？
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What about us?

674
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,520
爱拉斯，爱拉斯，爱拉斯！
Lovelace, Lovelace, Lovelace!

675
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,450
听我说！
Hear me!

676
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,650
这世上的爱还不够多
There's not enough love in the world.

677
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,890
转向你身边的企鹅
Turn to the penguin next to you.

678
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,460
用你的蹼，帮他梳理一下毛发
Put your flippers up. Fluff him up a little bit.

679
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,100
再和他拥抱一下
And give him a great big hug.

680
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,430
好了，美女们
Okay, ladies.

681
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,970
噢，再轻轻地给我叫一声，宝贝们
Oh, make that little noise again, girl.

682
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,700
嘿，我们哪点比不上他了？
Hey, what he got we don't got, man?

683
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,740
你抱着我干嘛？ 爱拉斯这么说的
What you hugging me for? He told me to.

684
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:37,140
一边去 不，其实你很喜欢这样
Get away. No, you like it.

685
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,340
放开他，雷蒙
Get off him, Ramon.

686
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,500
兄弟，你们那有石头吗？
Stretch, got any stones where you come from?

687
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,810
我们不收集石头 不捡？为啥？
We don't collect stones. You don't? Why not?

688
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,970
我们住在冰上
We live on the ice.

689
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,950
那你们怎么赢得女士的芳心？
So how you win the heart of the ladies?

690
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,610
我们唱歌
Well, we sing.

691
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,220
打住！这太荒谬了！ 你在开玩笑吧？
Stop! That's crazy! You're kidding, right?

692
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,230
没有，我们就是以歌传情
No. We sing to each other.

693
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,390
如果那个特别的她 喜欢你的歌声，那么…
If someone special likes your song, you know...

694
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,400
哦，那你找到那个特别的她了吗？
Oh, and you have someone special?

695
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,900
在你黑暗的浪漫史里，有一位高个美女？ 你怎么从未提起？
A tall beauty in your dark romantic past? Of which you never speak?

696
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,160
这个，可以这么说吧
Well, sort of.

697
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,140
嘿，让我们去瞧瞧 说不定她还有一些朋友的
Hey, let's go check it out. Maybe she got some friends.

698
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,300
我喜欢高个的
I like them tall.

699
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,880
没用的
It's never gonna work.

700
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,810
嘿，大家伙 现在是恋爱的季节
Hey, big guy. It's the loving season.

701
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,470
你只要唱歌就行了
All you gotta do is sing.

702
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,120
问题就在这，我不会唱
That's the problem. I can't.

703
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,750
你是鸟，没错吧？ 是鸟就会唱
You a bird, ain't you? All birds can sing.

704
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,180
我唱起来不像鸟
I don't sing like the birdie do

705
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,910
好吧
All right.

706
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,650
找到我，找到我
Find me, find me

707
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,860
他在干嘛？
What's he doing?

708
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,760
我想是在唱歌 唱歌我知道，但不是这样的
I think he's singing. I know singing, that's not singing.

709
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,330
我听过有动物这么叫过 之后就挂掉了！
I heard an animal once do that, but then they rolled him over, he was dead.

710
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,330
是啊，不过她唱歌的时候 会让你的心都震颤不已
Yeah. And when she sings, it darn near breaks your heart.

711
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,270
你看起来是个悲情角色，兄弟
You in tragic shape, man.

712
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,610
别担心，我们帮你解决 我们行吗？
Don't worry. We can fix it. We can?

713
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,940
当然，我们行，肯定行 行吗？
Absolutely. We can. We can. We can?

714
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,550
真的？ 对，让我跟你说几句话
Really? Yes! Let me tell something to you.

715
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,090
过来点，靠近点，你想唱歌？ 对
Come close. Closer. You wanna sing? Yeah.

716
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,750
确定吗？ 当然
You sure? Absolutely.

717
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,320
没有耍我？ 那就容易多了
You making fun of me? Then this is very easy.

718
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:01,590
真的吗？天，要是我能唱歌 这一切就都能改变了
Really? Gosh, if I could sing, that would change everything.

719
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,960
只要严格按我说的做，你肯定行
You will sing. You just got to do exactly what I say.

720
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,260
好的 我刚才说“好吧”？
Okay. Did I say "okay"?

721
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,930
不是 不是？那我说什么了？
No. No. What did I say?

722
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,630
严格按我说的做 一字不差
Do exactly what you say. Exactly what I say.

723
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:22,010
别再逼我，我已快要发疯
Don't push me 'Cause I'm close to the edge

724
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:28,350
我不想让毛掉光
I'm trying not to lose my...

725
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,880
葛露亚
Gloria

726
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,250
这就像是花丛，让我时而疑惑
It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder

727
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,660
如何抵挡这般诱惑
How I keep from going under

728
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,530
夜色如此曼妙
Midnight creeps so slowly

729
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:45,160
慢慢撒进那些，依然渴望的心灵里
Into hearts of those Who need more than they get

730
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:49,570
白昼的赌局
Daylight deals a bad hand

731
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:55,410
下注太多的企鹅一手烂牌
To a penguin who has laid too many bets

732
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,380
我会如你所愿，和你无尽缠绵
I'll make love to you Like you want me to

733
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,490
我会抱紧你，宝贝，所有…
And I'll hold you tight, baby, all...

734
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,920
葛露亚
Gloria

735
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:09,550
镜子盯着你的脸庞
The mirror stares you in the face

736
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,560
说道宝贝…
And says, "Baby..."

737
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:12,960
摇摆你的身体，摇摆…
Shake a bon-bon, Shake a...

738
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,600
“…这些没用”
It don't work

739
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,900
你口中祈祷，却心不在焉
You say your prayers Though you don't care

740
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:26,140
你口中祈祷，却心不在焉
You say your prayers Though you don't care

741
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,810
帅哥们！帅哥们！
Boys! Boys!

742
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,880
帅哥们！
Boys!

743
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:39,590
不 不 不 .
No, no, no...

744
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,610
以下原唱为西班牙语

745
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,310
命已注定

746
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,450
美人芳心

747
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,080
不敢奢求

748
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,230
曼波？
Mumble?

749
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:56,610
听兄弟话

750
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,910
决定表白

751
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:58,900
曼波
Mumble.

752
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,560
安全臂弯

753
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,310
哦，嗨，格露亚
Oh, hi, Gloria.

754
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,520
让你依靠

755
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,740
两手空空

756
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,460
真爱何在

757
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,420
这是你吗？
And this is you?

758
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,420
泪问苍天

759
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,720
当然是我，喜欢吗？
Sure, it's me. You like?

大胆表白 （大胆表白）

转过去
Turn around.

767
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,080
试过才有收获

768
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,680
转过去 为什么？
Turn around. Why?

769
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,800
为什么不呢？ 这个…
Well, why not? Well...

770
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,010
努力过才能成功

胜利定…

772
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,250
果然不是你？ 没错
What do you know? Yeah.

773
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:42,430
…是我的！
My way

774
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:41,220
曼波，你怎么能这样？
Gloria. Mumble, how could you?

775
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,920

00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:48,050
我知道我的尺寸小了一点 但是请不要害怕，我爱你
I know size can be daunting, but don't be afraid. I love you.

777
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,360
葛露亚，别走 我爱你

停下！ 好吧
Stop it! Okay.

782
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:02,040
曼波，你到底在想什么？
Mumble, what could you possibly be thinking?

783
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,240
我没别的办法了
I don't know what else to do.

784
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:12,010
葛露亚，不要…
Oh, Gloria, no.

785
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:15,450
葛露亚
Gloria

786
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,530
葛露亚
Gloria

787
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,090

Go up there, right now.

788
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,600
白昼的赌局…
Daylight deals a bad hand...

789
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,890

Gloria. Gloria.

790
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,800
跟着我的节奏唱
Sing to this.

791
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,970
曼波，你这样让我很尴尬
Mumble, you're embarrassing me.

792
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,480
宝贝…这样没用的
Baby... it don't work.

793
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,520
宝贝
Baby

794
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,530
如此缓慢
So slowly

795
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:06,270
慢慢撒进那些
So slowly into hearts of those

796
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:12,350
依然渴望的心灵里
Who need more than they get

797
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,540
白昼的赌局
Daylight deals a bad hand

798
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:22,210
下注太多的企鹅一手烂牌
To a penguin that has laid too many bets

799
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:26,380
镜子盯着你的脸庞
The mirror stares you in the face

800
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,400
说道“宝贝，这样没用”
And says, "Baby... it don't work"

801
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,560
你口中祈祷，却心不在焉
You say your prayers Though you don't care

802
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:41,700
你一边歌唱，一边对我放电
You sing and you shake the hurt

803
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,840
跳舞吧！
Dance!

804
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,810
摇滚的乐土
Boogie wonderland

807
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,690
夜色如此曼妙
Midnight creeps so slowly

808
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:08,390
慢慢撒进那些，依然渴望的心灵里
Into hearts of men Who need more than they get

809
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,870
白昼的赌局
Daylight deals a bad hand

810
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,740
下注太多的企鹅一手烂牌
To a penguin who has laid too many bets

811
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:19,310
镜子盯着你的脸庞
The mirror stares you in the face

812
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,680
说道“宝贝，这样没用”
And says, "Baby... it don't work"

813
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,380
你口中祈祷，却心不在焉
You say your prayers Though you don't care

814
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:29,520
你一边歌唱，一边对我放电
You dance and shake the hurt

815
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,060
跳吧！
Dance!

816
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,320
曼波！
Mumble!

817
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,690
摇滚的乐土
Boogie wonderland

818
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,770
跳吧，跳吧，跳吧
Dance, dance, dance

819
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,090
曼波
Mumble

820
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,400
摇滚的乐土
Boogie wonderland

821
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,100
快看呐，快看呐 快看呐，快看呐
Check it out, check it out Check it out, check it out

822
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,670
我的兄弟们
My brothers

823
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,920
在我眼里你是如此美丽，宝贝
You look so beautiful to me, baby

824
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,160
曼波 嘿，维奥拉小姐
Mumble. Hey, Miss Viola.

825
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:15,960
这世上的爱永不消失 曼波！
All the love in the world can't be gone Mumble!

826
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:21,100
所有的爱都没有错 曼波！
All the need to be loved can't be wrong Mumble!

827
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,830
太丢人了！
Disgraceful!

828
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,240
他们觉得自己是什么？
Who do they think they are?

829
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,010
诺亚呢？形势有点失控了
Where is Noah? This is getting out of hand.

830
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,980
来啊！
Go!

831
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,660
嘿，孟菲斯，那是你儿子，曼波
Hey, Memphis. It's your boy, Mumble.

832
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:42,060
曼波？ 曼波？
Mumble? Mumble?

833
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:45,720
不不，是曼波，噢！
No, no. No, it's "Mambo." O!

834
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,360
宝贝，他们在说“曼波”
Baby. They're saying, "Mumble."

835
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,780
摇滚！
Boogie!

836
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,250
看吧，诺亚，看！
Behold, Noah, look!

837
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:19,420
这一切早已有预兆 现在我们看到暴动了
This was an omen from the start and now we have this uprising.

838
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,130
停下来，停下来！
Stop! Stop!

839
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,100
停止这些荒唐的举动！
Stop this unruly nonsense!

840
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,750
马上停下来！
Stop it right now!

841
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,420
请你们有点自制力！
A little self-control, if you please!

842
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:40,280
你们这么失常和失态的行为 已经给族群的核心带来了混乱
You bring this disorder, this aberration, to the very heart of our community.

843
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,720
你们疯了吗？
Have you lost your minds?

844
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,650
我们只是在玩乐啊 无害的玩乐啊
We're just having fun. Harmless fun.

845
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:48,060
“无害”？就是你们这些堕落的玩乐 才会造成现在这种食物稀缺的境遇
"Harmless"? It is this kind of backsliding that has brought the scarcity upon us.

846
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:50,750
不好意思，老头 你能说标准企鹅语吗？
Excuse me, smiley. Can you speak plain penguin, please?

847
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,590
他说现在的食物短缺是我造成的
He thinks the food shortage has something to do with me.

848
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:57,430
难道你们不知道 只有社会和谐才能使我们生存下去吗？
Do you not understand that we can only survive here when we're in harmony?

849
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,840
当你和你的朋友带领我们放纵时…
When you and your foreign friends lead us into your easy ways...

850
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,640
…你们已经冒犯伟大的企鹅歌神了
...you offend the Great 'Guin.

851
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,740
你们使他停止了对我们的恩惠
You invite him to withhold his bounty.

852
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,510
他主宰着季节 他既然能给予，自然也能收回
He rules the seasons. He giveth and he can taketh away.

853
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,170
等等，快乐的大脚怎会导致饥荒？
Wait a minute. Happy feet can't cause a famine.

854
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,950
如果不是你们这些异教徒造成的 那还能是什么？
If thy kind of pagan display did not cause it, then what did?

855
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,420
我想原因在很远的地方 冰川的外面
I think it comes from outside. Way beyond the ice.

856
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,920
那里有我们所不了解的事情
There are things out there, things we don't understand.

857
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,760
谜团 不可思议的谜团
Mysteries. Mind-boggling mysteries.

858
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,330
神仙 对，异形
Mystic beings. Yeah, aliens.

859
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,130
他疯了 不，是异形
He's mad. No, aliens.

860
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,960
我听说他们很聪明 他疯了！
I hear they're smart. He's insane.

861
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,760
不，他们可能比我们都聪明 谁知道呢？
No, they might be smarter than all of us. Who knows?

862
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,340
他把鱼都赶走了 还在这里慷慨激昂地说废话！
He drove the fish away, now he's ranting this rubbish!

863
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,770
嘿，听我说 别碰我，你这肮脏的寄生虫
Hey, let me tell something to you. Don't touch me, you filthy vermin.

864
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,770
嘿，你干什么 这就是因果联系
Hey, watch it. And so it follows.

865
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,440
异议导致分裂，分裂导致厄运
Dissent leads to division and division leads us to doom.

866
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,680
你，快乐大脚，曼波，必须离开 听听
You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go. Hear, hear.

867
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:47,290
一步也别动，甜心
Don't you take one step, sweetheart.

868
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,950
你跟这些老糊涂一样有权利呆在这里
You have as much right to be here as any of these daffy old fools.

869
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,390
诺玛・珍，这事我来处理
Norma Jean, I'll deal with this.

870
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,030
爸？
Pa?

871
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,390
曼波，你必须和这些 所谓的朋友断绝关系
Mumble, you must renounce your so-called friends...

872
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,590
并放弃你那些奇怪的想法和特殊的举动
...your peculiar thoughts, your strange ways.

873
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,140
孟菲斯 如果我们是虔诚的…
Memphis. If we are devout...

874
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,430
…并且真诚的祈祷，鱼会回来的
...sincere in our praise, the fish will return.

875
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:10,870
但是，爸… 听着，孩子，我自己也曾堕落过
But, Pa... Listen, boy, I was a backslider myself.

876
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,310
现在我们正在为我当初的疏忽付出代价
I was careless and now we're paying the price.

877
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,070
这和曼波有什么关系？
What's this got to do with Mumble?

878
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,180
因为我的疏忽他才变成了这个样子 他有什么错？
It's why he is the way he is. There's nothing wrong with him!

879
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:21,410
面对现实吧，我们的儿子是个异类 他不是异类，明白吗？
Face it, our sors all messed up. He's not messed up, hear me?

880
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,560
相信我，我心里清楚 你怎么能这么说？
Believe me, I know. How can you say that?

881
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:26,820
因为他还在蛋里时我把它掉地上了
Because when he was just an egg, I dropped him!

882
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:28,760
孟菲斯
Memphis.

883
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,160
曼波
Mumble.

884
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,030
哦，我可怜的小曼波
Oh, my poor little Mumble.

885
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,870
但是，妈妈，可是我很正常啊
But, Mom, I'm perfectly fine.

886
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,030
不不，你不正常，孩子 没错
No. No, you're not, boy. That's right.

887
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,770
为了我们大家 别再动你那畸形的脚了
For all our sakes, you must stop this freakiness with the feet.

888
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:49,080
你父亲说得很对 这反映出了他很痛苦但愿意忏悔
Your father speaks wisely. Heed his suffering heart and repent.

889
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,450
但这毫无意义啊
But it just doesn't make any sense.

890
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,680
看来你的狂妄自大让我们没有别的选择了
Then your arrogance leaves us no choice!

891
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,840
别，等等
No, wait.

892
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:00,120
拜托了，儿子 你可以做到的，不是很难
Please, son, you can do this. It ain't so hard.

893
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:05,730
别让我改变，爸，我是改变不了的
Don't ask me to change, Pa, because I can't.

894
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,960
大家，不用白费口舌了
And that, my brethren, is the end of it.

895
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,030
你，赶快滚！
You, begone!

896
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:22,270
曼波 没事的，妈妈，没事的
Mumble. No, Ma, it's okay. It's okay.

897
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:26,170
你记住了
Let me tell something to you.

898
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,470
当我找到鱼群失踪的原因时…
When I find out what's happening to the fish...

899
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,140
…我会回来的
...I 'll be back.

900
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,610
请让开，请让开
Let me through? Let me through.

901
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,880
曼波，你没必要离开 让他去吧
Mumble, you don't have to go. Let it be.

902
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:38,520
葛露亚 不，不，爸爸，这不公平
Gloria. No. No, Dad, this isn't fair.

903
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,920
葛露亚，听你爸爸的话
Gloria, listen to your father.

904
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:46,990
我的亲人总是责难于他
My folks were always putting him down

905
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,030
责难，责难，责难
Down, down, down

906
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,470
他们说他生错了地方
They said he came From the wrong side of town

907
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,130
他生错了地方
He came from the wrong side of town

908
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:01,400
他们告诉我，他是个冤孽
They told me he was bad

909
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,670
冤孽
So bad

910
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:06,780
但我知道他很伤心 如此伤心
But I know he was sad So sad

911
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:12,120
我永远不会忘记他，那个可恶的带头老大
I'll never forget him The leader of the pack

912
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:16,120
我们的心灵之歌 献给我们真正的朋友，曼波
We sing the heart of our true friend, Mumble.

913
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:22,290
你们这帮无知、愚蠢、顽固、可悲的企鹅
You are a nation of peeny-weeny, piffling, piccolini, piddly-diddly pouft!

914
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,430
团结才有希望
Together, we prevail.

915
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,470
我们信仰智慧
In the wisdoms, we trust.

916
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,570
我们信仰
We trust.

917
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,540
当心
Look out

918
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:39,240
当心
Look out

919
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:43,020
当心
Look out

920
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:47,820
当…
Look...

921
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:52,090
当心
Look out

922
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:59,960
别担心，高个子 我爸爸也叫我，可怜的失败者
Don't worry, tall guy. My father also called me a pitiful loser.

923
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,260
看看我现在
Look how I turn out.

924
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,630
没有用的，雷蒙
You're not helping, Ramon.

925
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:06,500
他会好起来的 只要找到鱼群到底发生了什么就好办了
He gonna be okay. All he gotta do is find out what happened to the fish.

926
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,650
那他怎么找？ 他已经想到了什么
How he gonna do that? He think of something.

927
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,800
异形 什么？
The aliens. What?

928
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,810
我要去和异形对话 你去哪里找他们？
I'm gonna talk to the aliens. How you gonna find aliens?

929
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,540
爱拉斯 他不喜欢你，一点也不喜欢你
Lovelace. He don't like you. He don't like you at all.

930
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,810
没问题，我会唤醒他善良的本性
That's okay. I'll appeal to his better nature.

931
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:21,460
怎么唤醒？ 用非同一般的残忍刑罚？
How you gonna do that? Cruel and unusual punishment?

932
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,120
难以想象的拷问？ 还是可以想象的？
Unimaginable torture? Imaginable torture?

933
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,490
你的歌声？ 不是吧！
Your singing? No!

934
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,000
谁能找到我…
"Can anybody find me"...

935
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,060
你把冰都弄裂了 是雪崩！
You're cracking the ice! Avalanche!

936
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,900
没错，好吧，谢谢你
Yes, okay. Thank you.

937
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:47,220
爱拉斯，你在吗？
Lovelace. You there?

938
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,510
爱拉斯！
Lovelace!

939
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:54,190
爱拉斯
Lovelace.

940
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:00,860
爱拉斯？
Lovelace?

941
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:02,360
来的不是时候？
Is this a bad time?

942
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:04,470
虽然我们没有预约，但是…
I know we don't have an appointment, but...

943
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,760
就一个问题 我要你直截了当的回答
Just one question and I want a straight answer.

944
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,530
哪里能找到神仙？
Where do I find the mystic beings?

945
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,370
他怎么不说话？
Why don't he speak?

946
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,010
爱拉斯，你没事吧？
Lovelace, you okay?

947
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,680
天，他走火入魔了 是癫痫，癫痫！
Boy, he's possessed. It's a seizure! It's a seizure!

948
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:24,320
把嘴掰开 抓住他的舌头
Open the beak. Grab his tongue.

949
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,080
他快窒息了 他脖子上的东西太紧了
He's choking. That thing around his neck, it's too tight.

950
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,890
嘿，你怎么不早说 听我数到三
Well, why didn't you say so? On three.

951
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:34,330
住手！听着！不，朋友们，朋友们！住手！
Stop! Listen! No! Amigos! Amigos! Stop!

952
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,490
干嘛？ 这会弄伤了他
What? You're hurting him.

953
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,040
好些了吗？
Any better?

954
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,730
爱拉斯，你脖子上的那东西哪来的？
Lovelace, how did you get that thing around your neck?

955
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:46,240
是被安放在他脖子上的 神仙干的
It was bestowed on him. By the mystic beings.

956
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,570
不是他们放的？ 不是
They didn't bestow it? No.

957
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,740
哦，天，他已经语无伦次了
Oh, come on, he don't know what he's saying.

958
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,910
是你在游泳时，不小心被套住的？
You were swimming and it just got caught around your neck.

959
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:57,990
哦，怎么可能，他可是大师啊
Oh, no way. He the guru.

960
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:02,190
爱拉斯，你到底见过神仙没有？
Lovelace, did you ever actually meet a mystic being?

961
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,550
正式的见过？
Officially?

962
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,020
没有
No.

963
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,130
我早就知道！全是一派胡言！
I knew it! It's all a lie.

964
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,160
但这肯定是某人的
But this belongs to someone.

965
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:14,030
要是能找到他们，我敢肯定他们能把它拿下来
If we could find them, I bet you they could take it off.

966
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,670
告诉我你在哪里被套住的 我相信他们会帮助我们的，你和我
Show me where you found it. I'm sure they could help us. You and me both.

967
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,410
两个单词，三个音节
Two words, three syllables.

968
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,380
到底是什么？ 你快死了？
What is it? You're dying?

969
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:29,250
不不，等等 过去，过去，你过去的生活
No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life.

970
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,010
你在放毒气
You're passing gas.

971
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,410
他现在觉得自己是只海象
Now he thinks he's an elephant seal.

972
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,530
不不不，翻过前面那座山
No, no, no. Go over the mountains.

973
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:39,630
到山那边去！ 穿过海象的地盘
Go over the mountains! Through the land of the elephant seals.

974
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,390
在海象地盘的另一边 在海象地盘的另一边！
Beyond the land of the elephant seals. Beyond the land of the elephant seals!

975
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,510
等等 怎么了？
Wait. What?

976
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,410
我听到声音了
I hear voices.

977
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,250
有声音 哪里？
There is a voice. Where?

978
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:05,980
风中有很小的声音 曼波！
There's a little voice on the wind. Mumble!

979
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,450
“曼波”？ “曼波”？
"Mambo"? "Mambo"?

980
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,060
听 快乐大脚，曼波
Listen. Mumble Happy Feet.

981
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:10,820
葛露亚？ 葛露亚！
Gloria? Gloria!

982
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:11,980
葛露亚？
Gloria?

983
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,690
嘿，来了个追随者 你会被她弄得神魂颠倒的，兄弟
Hey, you got a stalker. She's obsessed with you, man.

984
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,770
真不敢相信是你
I can't believe it's you.

985
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,000
当然是我了
Of course it's me.

986
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,000
你来这干嘛？
What are you doing here?

987
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:29,370
这世上的爱永不消失
All the love in the world can't be gone

988
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:33,410
爱的需要永远没错
All the need to be loved can't be wrong

989
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:36,310
噢，天 往哪走，“闪亮的大脚”？
Oh, my. So which way, twinkletoes?

990
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:39,850
不不不，你要是跟来了 也许永远也回不去了
No, no, no. If you come, you may never get back home.

991
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,390
我不在乎
Fine by me.

992
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:47,020
葛露亚，那边有你自己的生活 我不能，我是说，我们不能，在这里…
Gloria, you have a life back there. I don't. I mean, we don't. Not out here.

993
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,290
我们怎么能保证蛋宝宝的安全？ 我是说如果我们生了一个的话…
How can we keep an egg safe? That's if we ever had an egg.

994
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,060
这个，我不要蛋宝宝也能很快乐啊
Well, I don't need an egg to be happy.

995
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,260
你现在是这么说 但以后你的朋友们都有了的时候呢？
You say that now, but what about later when all your friends have eggs?

996
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,870
我还有你
Then I'll have you.

997
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:04,710
他要开始山盟海誓了
Now he's going to pledge his soul forever.

998
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,010
葛露亚 瞧，来了
Gloria. Here it comes.

999
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:13,110
我是那种比较特殊的人 需要自己空间的那种
I'm a particular kind of guy, the kind of guy who needs his own space.

1000
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:15,260
不是针对你，而是我…
It's not you, it's me.

1001
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:17,860
我只是还没打算开始认真的恋爱
I'm just not up for a serious relationship right now.

1002
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:21,360
他现在在试着赶她走，继续看
What he's trying to do now is he's pushing her away. Let's watch.

1003
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:25,020
不管你说什么，做什么 我是跟定你了
No matter what you say or do, you're stuck with me.

1004
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,300
拜托，别装了 好像我来这里你一点都不激动似的
Oh, come on. As if you're not totally thrilled that I'm here.

1005
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:31,930
她开始用美人计了 看，这就是你的问题
Now she got him on the ropes. See, right there is your problem.

1006
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:34,010
你觉得你的魅力谁也无法抗拒，是吧？
You think you're irresistible, don't you?

1007
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,510
我不管你从哪里学来的 听了这话的人一定很受伤
I don't care where you're from, that's got to hurt.

1008
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,410
你刚刚说什么？ 葛露亚是如此的高贵，如此的有天分
Excuse me? Gloria's so gorgeous, Gloria's so talented.

1009
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:40,570
什么？
What?

1010
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,150
你只不过能飙到几个高音而已
Just because you can hit a few high notes.

1011
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,450
你对我的歌声有意见？
You got a problem with my singing?

1012
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,850
不是，你唱得相当地好
No, it's perfectly fine.

1013
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,890
“好”？ 如果你喜欢这样赞美你的话
"Fine"? If you like that sort of thing.

1014
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,650
我早已不喜欢这么幼稚的东西了 什么？
It's a little Nana Tootsie for my taste. What?

1015
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:54,960
你知道的 炫耀，浮华，沙沙声
You know, showy, flashy, froufrou.

1016
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,620
“沙沙声”？ 没错
"Froufrou"? That's right.

1017
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,930
不知道你从哪里学的，认为这种 上蹿下跳，原地乱颠的动作很“酷”
Coming from someone who thinks it's cool to jig up and down really fast on the spot...

1018
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,370
…就像个抽筋的白痴似的
...like some twitchy idiot.

1019
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,770
你这个固执己见、不可理喻的傻瓜！
You stubborn, hippity-hoppity fool!

1020
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:11,810
就站在你后面
Right back at you.

1021
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,650
朋友，干得不错
Amigo, that was a good thing you do.

1022
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:27,090
她不和你在一起，会过的好得多
She is going to be so much better off without you.

1023
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,390
她会去找一个善良的，站得稳的家伙 来安慰她…
She is going to find a good, steady guy to comfort her...

1024
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,760
…来深爱她，和她生一大堆宝宝
...and love her up real good and raise a big family.

1025
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,170
雷蒙 然后忘记这段感情…
Ramon. And then she's going to let herself go...

1026
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:39,470
雷蒙 他在心痛呢，非常心痛
Ramon. He's hurting. He's hurting bad.

1027
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:44,310
噢，听着，听着 憋在心里会疯的，你得把它们宣泄出来
Oh, listen, listen, don't hold it in or you explode. You got to let it out.

1028
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,180
宣泄吧，宣泄吧
You just let it out. You let it out.

1029
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:50,220
你们几个转过身去一会儿
Everybody, turn away for a moment.

1030
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:52,690
如果她现在离开他
If she leave him now

1031
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:58,060
他就失去了最宝贵的东西
She take away the biggest part of him

1032
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,360
不要啊，宝贝，请不要离开
Don't, baby, please, don't go

1033
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:04,400
拜托，伙计们
Please, guys.

1034
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:06,560
别再唱了
No more singing.

1035
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:19,810
然后她跟我说“够了，你让我感到恶心”
Then she say to me, "Enough, you are making me nauseous."

1036
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,710
然后我闭嘴了，差点发怒 接着她说什么你知道吗？
So I become silent, almost moody, and you know what she says?

1037
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,950
“你从不让他人替你分担你要学会宣泄出来”
"You never share. You got to let it out."

1038
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,890
雷蒙，你又来了 宣泄吧，宣泄吧
Ramon, come on. Let it out. Let it out.

1039
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,490
停下！放手吧
Stop it! Let it go.

1040
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:34,320
我这辈子没有遇到过一段美好的感情 拥抱他一下吧，拥抱一下
I never had a good relationship in my life. Give him a hug. Give him a hug.

1041
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,730
我要宣泄！ 又来了
I let it out! There we go.

1042
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,460
我要宣泄！ 我知道，要学会忘记
I let it out. I know. Get over it.

1043
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,430
你还能走吗？ 嗯
Can you keep going? Yeah.

1044
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,800
什么味道？ 不是我
What's that smell? It wasn't me.

1045
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:49,710
嘿，毛球，是我们跟着你 走啊，快爬上来
Hey, Fluffy, we're following you. Get up here.

1046
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:01,920
这些海象 他们不吃企鹅的，对吧？
So these elephant seals, they're not penguin eaters, are they?

1047
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:04,490
我不知道，我相信他们是食草动物
I don't know. I believe they are herbivores.

1048
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,530
什么？ 我是说，他们只吃海藻
What? You know, kelp-suckers.

1049
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,030
来吧，爱拉斯，跳
Here we go, Lovelace. Come on.

1050
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,570
赶紧跳，赶紧跳
Jump in time. Jump in time.

1051
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:15,500
好吧，我们跳吧 好，好，好，准备好了？
Okay, let's do it. Okay, okay, okay. Ready?

1052
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:21,110
我知道我能行，我得骗一下自己
I can do this. I can do this. I got to trick myself.

1053
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,180
瞧，那是什么？
Boy, look at that. What?

1054
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:43,690
你们这些野小子最好是迷路了 否则入侵别人的领地可是犯罪
You blokes better be lost, because trespassing's a crime.

1055
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:47,860
我们只是路过 对，他带我们来的
We're just passing through. Yeah. We're with him.

1056
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,940
你们不会是想翻过远处那些山…
You wouldn't be heading over them distant hills...

1057
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:53,040
…再穿过那些暴风雪的土地吧？
...and through the blizzard country?

1058
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:56,010
如果这是通往禁闭海滩的唯一通路 那么是的
If it's the only way to the forbidden shore, yeah.

1059
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,370
哎呀
Crikey.

1060
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,040
你们会碰到毁灭者的
You might come face to face with an annihilator.

1061
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,240
异形毁灭者？
An alien annihilator?

1062
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,350
没错，一看到它你们就会被切成两半
Too right. Cut you up as soon as look at you.

1063
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,550
它们经过的地方不留活口
Waste every living thing in their path.

1064
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,390
他们也毁灭鱼群吗？
Could they be annihilating the fish?

1065
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,150
所有生物
Every living thing.

1066
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:14,800
太残忍了，兄弟，太残忍了
Merciless, mate. Merciless.

1067
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,260
即使你是庞大的巨鲸…
Even if you're a whopping great whale...

1068
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:20,100
…也会被他们拉上岸…
...they drag your sorry carcass ashore...

1069
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:25,970
…切成块，化成汤 变为他们享受的食物…
...dice you up, melt you down, and turn you into fun food.

1070
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,410
前一刻你还是一头巨鲸…
One day you're a big old whale...

1071
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,880
…后一刻…
...next minute...

1072
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,450
…就变成享受的食物了
...fun food.

1073
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,050
得有人去阻止他们
Someone's gotta stop them.

1074
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,710
哦，是吗？你想用什么方法？
Oh, yeah? What's gonna be your approach?

1075
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,910
如果我能和他们谈谈的话
If I could just talk to them.

1076
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,580
唤醒他们善良的本性
Appeal to their better nature.

1077
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,750
很好
Beauty.

1078
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:47,520
当你那些小把戏得逞的时候 一定要让我们知道，记住了吗？
When that crafty little trick pays off, you be sure to let us know, won't you?

1079
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,560
好吧，爱拉斯，我们走
All right, Lovelace, let's go.

1080
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,900
再见，爱拉斯
See you, Lovelace.

1081
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,770
那边会是你的墓地，伙计
Your funeral, mate.

1082
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:50,150
噢，天
Oh, man!

1083
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:53,920
用力推啊 好
Push tight. Okay.

1084
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,740
来啊，伙计们，加油！
Come on, guys. Let's do it.

1085
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:14,820
你们能行的，快点，推啊
You can do it. Come on, push!

1086
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,090
什么声音？
What's that noise?

1087
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:03,830
没听见啊
There's no noise.

1088
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,560
没有喘气，也没有呼吸 爱拉斯呢？
No gasping. No wheezing. Where's Lovelace?

1089
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,410
有时候一只勇敢的企鹅也会失足而死
Sometimes a brave penguin will just slip away to die.

1090
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,510
你觉得他会去极乐世界吗？
Do you think he went to a happy place?

1091
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,270
也许吧 不，不，我想他往这边去了
Probably. No, no. I think he went this way.

1092
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,820
来吧，我们走
Come on. Let's go.

1093
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:52,310
爱拉斯！
Lovelace!

1094
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,970
爱拉斯！
Lovelace!

1095
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,860
哈罗！
Hello?

1096
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:06,660
有人吗？
Is there anyone there?

1097
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:10,420
别…别大声喊 小心被人听见
No... No need to shout. Somebody might hear you.

1098
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,840
脚印看起来不大正常
His feet don't look too good.

1099
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:20,600
他在这里休息了一下 然后他用腹部滑下去了
He rested here. Now he's on his belly!

1100
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:23,340
不，这边 不知道他在这里做什么
No, this way. You don't want to know what he did here.

1101
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,740
你是对的 他在那！爱拉斯！
You're right. There he is. Lovelace!

1102
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,210
没错！爱拉斯！ 爱拉斯！
All right! Lovelace! Lovelace!

1103
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,750
看看爱拉斯 我们来了
Oh, look at Lovelace. We're here.

1104
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,480
你还好吗？ 伙计，要撑住啊
Are you okay? Come on, man. Hang in there, buddy.

1105
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,990
那是什么？
What is it?

1106
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,430
看，似乎每人都有一个
Oh, look. There's one for everyone.

1107
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,120
坚持住，爱拉斯 我知道他们就在附近
Hang in there, Lovelace. I know they're here somewhere.

1108
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,830
他们为什么把这些东西都留在这里？ 我不知道
Why would they leave all this behind? I don't know.

1109
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,830
嘿
Hey.

1110
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,270
告诉他们我们没有危险 我们没有危险！
Tell them we come in peace. We come in peace!

1111
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,970
爱拉斯 爱拉斯
Lovelace. Lovelace.

1112
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,610
爱拉斯 哦，伙计，坚持住
Lovelace. Oh, buddy, come on.

1113
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,840
你没事吧？ 坚持住，伙计
Are you okay? Hang in there, buddy.

1114
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:03,920
哦，看起来不大妙 保持冷静
Oh, that's not good. Stay calm.

1115
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:05,380
保持冷静 不对劲
Stay calm. That's not good.

1116
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,150
好吧，别冷静了 我好怕！
Okay, don't stay calm! Panic!

1117
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,830
噢，不，不！
Oh, no, no!

1118
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:21,960
哦，它们在玩我们呢 他们在玩我们！
Oh, they're making us appe-teasers. They're appe-teasing us!

1119
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,270
我们都死定了
We're all gonna die.

1120
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,410
无论怎样，都离水远点！
Whatever you do, stay out of the water!

1121
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,700
离水远点 别掉下去！
Stay out of the water. Don't go in the water!

1122
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,580
爱拉斯，别下去！
Lovelace, don't go in the water!

1123
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,950
爱拉斯，坚持住！
Lovelace, hang in there!

1124
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,020
坚持住！
Hang in there!

1125
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:46,380
把你恶心的舌头拿开！
Get your dirty tongue off him!

1126
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,700
不，不，不！
No, no, no!

1127
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:52,330
离水远点！
Stay out of the water!

1128
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,200
曼波！ 曼波！
Mumble! Mumble!

1129
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:29,060
他们在打鸟毛球吗？ 不，这是表演，晚餐和表演
They playing birdminton? No, it's a show. Dinner and a show.

1130
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:35,270
爱拉斯！
Lovelace!

1131
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,770
好极了！
Rejoice!

1132
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,390
爱拉斯！
Lovelace!

1133
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,620
救命！伸出手来！
Help! Reach out!

1134
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,630
谢谢你，兄弟，谢谢！
Thank you, my brother, thank you!

1135
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:09,480
我不怕，我不怕！
I wasn't scared! I wasn't scared!

1136
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:14,220
哦，我可爱的兄弟 谢谢，谢谢，谢谢，谢谢
Oh, my beautiful brother, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1137
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:21,360
爱拉斯！你太强了！ 冲，冲
Go, Lovelace! You the man! Go, go, go, go, go!

1138
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,990
够了！
Enough!

1139
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,250
你们今天算是倒霉了！
It's a bad day for you!

1140
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:28,490
你们在和爱拉斯过招！
You dealing with Lovelace now!

1141
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,330
还有我的人，曼波，也在这儿 告诉他们，爱拉斯
And my man, Mumble, here. You tell them, Lovelace.

1142
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,260
给我滚，死鱼们！拜拜啦
Begone, demon fish. Adios.

1143
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,300
没错
That's right.

1144
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,240
逃回你妈妈那里去吧
You hightail it back to your mamas.

1145
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:41,600
他是怎么做到的？ 别让我下水去追你们
How did he do that? Don't make me come in the water.

1146
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,710
我不会放过你们的孩子
I'll come after your sons and daughters.

1147
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,870
我不会给你们好脸色的
I'm gonna give you the bad eye.

1148
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:41,500
他们人好多啊
A whole bunch of them.

1149
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:44,300
他们想统治世界
They gonna rule the world.

1150
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:45,460
一定就是他们了
It's gotta be them.

1151
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,910
就算是，我也不想了解 他们甚至都不知道我们的存在
If it is, I don't wanna know about it. They don't even know we exist.

1152
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,410
这么跟你说吧
Let me tell something to you.

1153
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,570
这事到此为止，结束了
This is the end of the road. It's over.

1154
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,650
你已经做了企鹅能做的一切
You did everything penguinly possible.

1155
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:59,290
你找到了异形 我们会帮你作证的
You found the aliens. We gonna testify to that.

1156
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:02,820
我们会告诉，你那个可笑的民族 他们对你的看法是完全错误的
We'll tell your whole laughing-boy nation they were dead wrong about you.

1157
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,790
现在我们都回家吧，赶紧走
Now, let's all go back home. Right now.

1158
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,330
好极了
Right on.

1159
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,090
能帮我个忙吗？ 当然
Could I ask a favor of you? Sure.

1160
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,820
什么忙？ 你们能照顾好葛露亚吗？
What kind of favor? Could you make sure Gloria's okay?

1161
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,370
还有我妈妈 什么？
And my ma. What?

1162
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,130
还有，如果看到我爸…
And if you see Pa...

1163
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:17,170
…告诉他我尽力了
...tell him I tried.

1164
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,830
好吧，不过你到底想说什么？
Okay, what you talking about?

1165
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,770
我要去阻止他们捕我们的鱼
I'm gonna stop them taking our fish.

1166
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,500
你怎么阻止，曼波？
How you gonna do that, Mumble?

1167
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,940
一路平安，朋友！
Adios, amigos!

1168
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,770
朋友！他真去了！
Amigo! He did it.

1169
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,370
你敢相信吗？
You believe that?

1170
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:58,100
我们怎么跟他妈妈交代？ 他这么大老远带我们来这里，就是为了自杀？
How we gonna tell his mama he bring us all this way just to kill himself?

1171
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,040
不，他没自杀，看
No. He didn't. Look.

1172
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,650
他真是个疯子
He loco maniac.

1173
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:06,750
历史上第一只会飞的企鹅
First ever flying flipper bird.

1174
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,080
你觉得他有多高？
How tall you think that tall boy was?

1175
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:12,420
谁能回答？ 比任何人都高
Who could say? Taller than anyone.

1176
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,530
嘿，是我，爱拉斯…
Hey, it's me, Lovelace...

1177
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,100
…也就是以前大家所说的“大师”
...formerly known as "guru."

1178
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:22,260
我会把你，快乐大脚的故事…
I'm gonna be telling your story, Happy Feet...

1179
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,310
…世世代代将给子孙们听！
...long after you dead and gone!

1180
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:45,590
嘿，嘿！
Hey! Hey!

1181
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,440
由于被人类的无动于衷所激怒…
Enraged by their indifference...

1182
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:43,950
…即使他们已在视野中消失已久 他仍然执着地跟随着他们
...he followed them long after they were gone from his sight.

1183
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,350
他探险比我们之中任何一个去过的都远…
He ventured further than any of us had gone before...

1184
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:54,360
…已经超出了生还的希望
...beyond all hope of return.

1185
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,730
伴随着巨大的洋流…
Swept up by the great currents...

1186
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,560
…他被带着穿过了无尽广阔的大海…
...he was carried endlessly across vast oceans...

1187
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:06,440
…去向了那未知的世界
...to worlds unknown.

1188
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:05,500
打扰一下，请问这是哪里？
Excuse me. What is this place?

1189
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:08,660
你在天堂，大卫，企鹅的天堂
You're in heaven, Dave. Penguin heaven.

1190
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,830
这里离帝企鹅的领地近吗？
Is it anywhere near Emperor Land?

1191
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:13,800
你可以把这里当作任何地方
It's wherever you want it to be.

1192
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,670
试试水吧，戴夫，完全真实
Try the water, Dave. It's really real.

1193
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:39,130
我听说，他最终近距离看到的异形…
I heard tell, when he finally saw aliens up close...

1194
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,500
…跟贼鸥描述的一模一样
...they were just as the skua had described.

1195
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:46,300
请问，你们为什么抢走我们的鱼？
Excuse me. Why are you taking our fish?

1196
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:51,780
大而丑陋的企鹅 肥胖松弛的脸上没有羽毛
Big, ugly penguins without feathers on their fat, flabby faces.

1197
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:57,680
你们为什么抢走我们的鱼？ 你们这样会害死我们的
Why are you taking our fish? You're kind of killing us out there.

1198
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,150
不！不，等等！
No! No, wait!

1199
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,740
噢，天
Oh, my.

1200
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,970
哈罗，这是来自帝企鹅领地的问候 下午好
Hello. Hello from Emperor Land. Good afternoon.

1201
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,900
你们为什么抢走我们的鱼？
Why are you taking our fish?

1202
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:25,510
我知道你们不是故意的 但你们给我们带来了很大的伤害
I'm sure you don't mean to, but you're causing an awful lot of grief.

1203
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,510
我说的不够明白吗？ 都是大白话啊
Am I not making myself clear? I'm speaking plain penguin.

1204
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:34,980
企鹅语，你们听不懂吗？ 你们在偷我们的鱼
Penguin! Don't you understand? You're stealing our fish.

1205
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,990
噢，拜托，你们谁跟我说话吧
Oh, please, anyone, talk to me!

1206
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,390
可怜可怜我们吧 你们在偷我们的鱼…
For pity's sake, you're stealing our F-l-S...

1207
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:53,940
三天以后，他已经声嘶力竭
After three days, he would lose his voice.

1208
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:56,540
三个月以后…
After three months...

1209
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:02,640
…他几乎忘了他来这里的目的
...he would all but lose his mind.

1210
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,030
你终于找到鱼了，宝贝
So you found the fish, baby.

1211
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:20,800
妈？
Ma?

1212
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:22,270
嗨，亲爱的 妈
Hi, sweetie. Ma.

1213
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,840
毛球，不管他们说什么，做什么 我们都会和你站在一起的
Fluffy, no matter what they say or do, we never stopped believing in you.

1214
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,100
那么你很快就能回来了，是吗？
So you'll be back soon, right?

1215
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,910
嘿，别问了，让他吃吧
Hey, come on. Let him eat.

1216
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,070
吃吧，戴夫，不用管我们
Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us.

1217
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,050
但有很多鱼啊，够大家吃的
But there's plenty for everyone.

1218
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:37,520
没事的，甜心，我们可以等
It's okay, sugar. We can wait.

1219
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:39,520
不，不，妈！妈！
No, no, Ma! Ma!

1220
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:43,090
这里有很多啊，妈！
There's lots here. Ma!

1221
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:48,620
妈！
Ma!

1222
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,530
孩子，这个你一定得看看 他又开始了
Kids, you gotta see this. He's on now.

1223
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,660
嘿，大家好！
Hey! Hello!

1224
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,660
这不是那个脚有毛病的家伙吗？ 看起来像
Isn't that the fellow with the wacky feet? Looks like.

1225
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,130
他叫什么？ 我以为他死了呢
What was his name? I thought he was dead.

1226
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:44,700
大家… 显然没死
Everybody... Apparently not.

1227
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:47,810
大家听着！我有重大消息
Everybody, listen up! I've got big news.

1228
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,130
我知道鱼被谁抢走了
I know who's taking the fish!

1229
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:52,780
对，然后把他的脑子也挖走了 是那些异形
Yeah, and they took his brain. It's the aliens.

1230
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:55,210
我跟他们联系了 疯子回来了
I made contact with them. The lunatic is back.

1231
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,380
是异形抢走了我们的鱼
The aliens are taking our fish.

1232
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:59,610
赶快叫人去把诺亚和长老们请来
Someone ought to fetch Noah and the elders.

1233
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:01,090
嘿，你
Hey, you.

1234
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:03,220
葛露亚
Gloria.

1235
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:05,490
再看到你，觉得有点怪怪的
Kind of weird, seeing you again.

1236
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:06,980
是啊
Yeah.

1237
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,530
没什么事吧，宝贝 你记得西摩吧
Everything cool here, baby? You remember Seymour.

1238
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,000
当然，嗨，西摩
Yeah. Hi, Seymour.

1239
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:12,660
嗯
Yeah.

1240
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:15,700
哪个是你孩子？
So which one is yours?

1241
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:18,200
全都是
All of them.

1242
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:24,710
这是我们的歌唱班 他教韵律，我教蓝调
This is our singing class. He teaches rhythm. I teach the blues.

1243
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,470
那你们没…？ 我想我还没等到属于我的那支歌
So you're not? I guess I never heard the right song.

1244
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:30,780
太好了！我不是那个意思…
That's great! I didn't mean...

1245
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,710
我知道谁抢走了我们的鱼了
I found out who's taking the fish.

1246
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:35,020
他们很大，有点丑 但是，葛露亚…
They're big and kind of ugly, but, Gloria...

1247
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:37,490
…他们很厉害的 他们要来这儿
...the things they can do. They're coming here.

1248
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:38,790
哦，是么？
Oh, is that so?

1249
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,360
他们马上要来了 我想他们是想帮助我们
They'll be here soon. I think they wanna help us.

1250
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:43,260
那你跟他们谈过了？
So now you speak with them?

1251
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:46,630
这个，他们不说企鹅语 但他们对这个有反应
Well, they don't speak penguin, but they seem to respond to this.

1252
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,860
他在干嘛？ 开玩笑吧
What's he doing? You gotta be kidding me.

1253
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,060
我建议大家都这么做 这真的很吸引他们
I suggest we all do it. It really gets their attention.

1254
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,570
怎么会这样呢？
And why would it do that?

1255
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,640
你问住我了，不过真的有用
Beats me, but it works.

1256
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:59,680
嘿，是那个脚抽筋的家伙 怪脚！
Hey, it's the hippity-hopper. Freaky feet!

1257
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:00,840
孩子们，孩子们…
Boys, boys...

1258
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,010
毛球 高个子
Fluffy. Tall guy.

1259
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:04,180
兄弟 朋友！
Stretch! Amigo!

1260
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:10,660
你还敢回来？
So you dare come back?

1261
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,550
他说他找到异形了 是他们抢走了我们的鱼
He says he's found aliens and they're taking our fish.

1262
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:16,250
他说他们要来了 还让我们都这么做
He says that they're coming and we all have to do this.

1263
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:21,260
这世上没有异形这东西！
There be no such thing as aliens!

1264
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:26,100
曼波，转过去
Mumble, turn around.

1265
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,730
这是病变啊
It's a disease.

1266
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:32,840
这是他们的吗？
Is that from them?

1267
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:37,710
对，但别害怕 我想这是他们找我用的，仅此而已
Yeah. But don't be afraid. I think it's a way to find me, that's all.

1268
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:41,580
你把他们带到这儿来？ 你让他们来对付自己人？
You led them here? You turned them on your own kind?

1269
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:46,290
等等，你刚才不是说异形不存在吗？
Wait a second, you just said there's no such thing as aliens.

1270
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:50,860
这个，当然不存在
Well, there's not.

1271
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:54,660
就算存在 也只有叛变的傻瓜才会带他们来这儿
But if there were, only a traitorous fool would bring them here.

1272
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:55,930
但他们必须来
But they have to come.

1273
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,070
是他们抢走了我们的鱼 他们有办法解决的
They're the ones taking our fish. They can do something about it.

1274
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,730
除了伟大的企鹅歌神之外 没人拥有给予和夺取的力量
None but the Great 'Guin has the power to give and take away.

1275
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:07,370
但企鹅歌神并没有把事情变得如此反常 这是异形们干的
The Great 'Guin didn't put things out of whack, the aliens did.

1276
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:11,890
这个白痴今天回来 是来取笑我们的苦难
A fool returns this day to mock our suffering.

1277
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:16,180
我们正处于饥荒 他还要我们跟他一起跳
We are starving and he wants us to hippity-hop.

1278
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:19,290
我们是坚持自己的生活方式…
So do we hold fast to our ways...

1279
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:24,160
…还是会为这个跳舞白痴 荒诞的白日梦所蛊惑？
...or do we bend to the fetid fantasies of a dancing fool?

1280
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:35,670
跟我说说，那个脚怎么跳来着？
Say, how does that feet thing go again?

1281
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,400
对啊，给我们演示一下，曼波
Yeah, show us, Mumble.

1282
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:40,840
哦，其实很简单
Oh, it's really quite easy.

1283
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,640
不，不！
No, no!

1284
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:44,150
不，你们必须抵制！
No, you must resist!

1285
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:46,680
没错
That's right.

1286
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:50,420
毫无意义的废话 抵制！原地站好！
Pointless nonsense. Resist! Stand your ground!

1287
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:53,930
停止这荒唐的举动，站好！
Stand your ground against this folly!

1288
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,760
放开嗓子，兄弟们
Raise your voices, brothers.

1289
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:06,240
喊出你们对这些小丑的蔑视！
Cry out in defiance of this jiggity-joggity!

1290
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:08,540
炫出你自己
Show me what you got.

1291
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:13,080
对极了
You got it.

1292
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:19,050
来吧
Come on.

1293
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,550
好，继续
Work, work it.

1294
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,820
没错，很好！让我们召唤智慧！
Yes, yes! Call on the wisdoms!

1295
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:25,720
让大地颤抖！
Let the world tremble!

1296
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,030
当别人都已离开…
For when all others leave...

1297
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,060
…我们还在这！
...we remain!

1298
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,430
曼波，曼波！
Mumble! Mumble!

1299
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,400
妈妈？朋友们
Mama? Amigos.

1300
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:40,610
哦，妈妈 哦，我的孩子
Oh, Mama. Oh, my boy.

1301
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:43,370
我帅气的孩子 哦，妈妈
My gorgeous boy. Oh, Mama.

1302
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:45,670
看看他 你是如此的耀眼
Look at him. You're so dazzling.

1303
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:48,710
哦，毛球 我们一直在等你
Oh, Fluffy. We waited and waited for you.

1304
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,720
噢，耶 爸在哪里？
Oh, yeah. Where's Pa?

1305
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:54,150
相信我，你不会想看到你游手好闲的爸爸
Believe me. You don't wanna see your deadbeat dad.

1306
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,380
你爸有点… 有点什么？
Your pa is sort of... What?

1307
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,860
来吧，我领你去
Come on, I'll show you.

1308
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,030
孟菲斯？
Memphis?

1309
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:12,510
孟菲斯？
Memphis?

1310
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,160
爸？
Pa?

1311
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,710
曼波？
Mumble?

1312
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,870
真的是你吗？
Is it truly you?

1313
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:24,380
完完全全是我，爸
Every last bit of me, Pa.

1314
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,390
我以为…
I thought...

1315
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:36,020
爸？
Pa?

1316
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:42,030
我对你做的那些事…
There ain't been one day...

1317
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:48,640
…没有一件是正确的
...not one day, that I done right by you.

1318
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:55,010
哦，爸
Oh, Pa.

1319
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:57,050
为他跳舞吧，孩子他爸
Dance for him, Daddy.

1320
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,210
跟孩子一起跳舞吧
Dance with your boy.

1321
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,960
你必须原谅我
You'll have to forgive me.

1322
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,820
我对音乐已经完全没感觉了
The music's gone clean out of me.

1323
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,290
不，不会的
No, it hasn't.

1324
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:16,270
这就像用身体唱歌
It's just like singing with your body.

1325
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,460
来吧，爸爸，我们一起来
Come on, baby. We can do it.

1326
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,200
哦，孩子他妈
Oh, Mama.

1327
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:24,740
就是一只脚紧接着另一只脚动
It's just one big old foot after the other.

1328
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:31,140
就这样
That's it.

1329
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:34,990
是的
Yeah.

1330
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,190
对，没错吧？ 嗯，感觉很好
Yeah, see? Well, that feels good.

1331
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:47,870
想让我激情似火
You don't have to be beautiful

1332
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:49,290
耶，孟菲斯
Yeah, Memphis.

1333
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,160
不必在意外表
To turn me on

1334
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:52,630
孩子他爸
Daddy.

1335
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:56,830
我只需要你的身体，宝贝
I just need your body, baby

1336
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:59,500
从日出到日落
From dusk till dawn

1337
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,450
想成为我的女孩，不必多么富有
You don't have to be rich to be my girl

1338
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:08,610
想主宰我的世界，不必特意装酷
You don't have to be cool To rule my world

1339
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:12,690
没有比这，更适合我的歌曲
Ain't no particular song I'm more compatible with

1340
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:17,530
我只是需要你更多的时间，还有…
I just want your extra time and your...

1341
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:40,880
神圣的族群啊！
Holy flock!

1342
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,720
妈呀，妈呀，妈呀
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

1343
01:35:45,390 --> 01:35:47,750
我想你现在最好开始跳舞
I think you better dance now.

1344
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:43,780
一开始只有一只，现在是数以千计
First, there was just one. Now there's thousands.

1345
01:36:43,950 --> 01:36:46,640
它们是不是试图告诉我们什么？ 它们有什么问题？
Are they trying to tell us something? What's the problem?

1346
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:49,610
我们搞乱了它们的食物链 我们必须做点什么
We're messing with their food chain. We've gotta do something.

1347
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:53,480
我们建议禁止一切的海产捕捞 那么多利润，那么多工作机会
We suggest a ban on all marine harvesting. Too much money. Too many jobs.

1348
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:57,550
我们到底为什么要那么做？
Why should we do anything at all?

1349
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:06,630
它们只是这个世界的底层里 一群不会飞的鸟
They're just a bunch of flightless birds at the bottom of the world.

1350
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:13,470
我可不想生活在没有企鹅的世界里
I don't wanna live in a world without penguins.

1351
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,010
那我们该怎么办？
What are we gonna do about it?

1352
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:16,840
砸掉“禁止捕鱼”的牌子
Bang up the sign "No Fishing."

1353
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:22,010
那可是你们所做的…
Is equal to the love...

1354
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:23,580
…爱
...you make.

1355
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:31,820
噢，宝贝，好极了
Oh, baby. Right on.

1356
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:49,470
回想过去，当我还穿着尿布
Looking back on when I Was a little nappy-headed boy

1357
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:53,780
这就像是花丛
It's like a jungle sometimes

1358
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:56,140
让我时而疑惑，如何抵挡这般诱惑
It makes me wonder How I keep from going under

1359
01:37:58,090 --> 01:37:59,550
放马过来吧！来啊！
Bring it on! Go ahead!

1360
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:04,410
尽管我们有时，会一无所获
Even though we sometimes Would not get a thing

1361
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:08,460
但我们仍然享受，生活的快乐
We were happy with The joy the day would bring

1362
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:11,790
我怀念那些，逝去的时光
I wish those days Would come back once more

1363
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:16,160
回来吧 美好时光 回来吧 别再离去
Come back those days, those days Come back, don't go

1364
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:19,230
来吧，宝贝，回来吧
Come here, babe. Come on back.

1365
01:38:19,410 --> 01:38:20,400
回来吧
Come on back

1366
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:22,200
回来吧 回来吧
Come on back Come on back

1367
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:24,870
回来吧 回来吧
Come on back Come on back

1368
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:27,240
我爱那些，我爱那些
I love them, I love them

1369
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:28,580
我爱那些，我爱那些
I love them, I love them

1370
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:36,520
那些美好时光，那些美好时光 那些美好时光，那些美好时光
Those days, those days Those days, those days

1371
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:42,190
那些美好时光
Those days
