<i>once there was a way
To get back homeward</i>

2
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:49,722
<i>Are the stars out tonight?</i>

3
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,166
<i>Once there was a way to get back home</i>

4
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,602
<i>I only have eyes</i>

5
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:02,802
<i>Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry</i>

6
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,311
<i>For you</i>

7
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,076
<i>And I will sing a lullaby</i>

8
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:11,186
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

9
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:13,747
<i>So tell me</i>

10
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:17,222
<i>Tell me something good</i>

11
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:22,395
<i>Tell me that you love me</i>

12
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:25,193
<i>Tell me, baby</i>

13
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:27,768
<i>Tell me something good</i>

14
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:29,666
<i>Only you</i>

15
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,739
<i>But how can you know for sure?</i>

16
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:34,843
<i>Can make this world seem right</i>

17
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,569
<i>Is there really just one?</i>

18
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:39,374
<i>I need your love</i>

19
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:44,152
<i>So many songs, but I'm feeling so lonely.</i>

20
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,120
<i>Where is the love?</i>

21
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:56,632
<i>You don't have to be beautiful</i>

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,735
<i>To turn me on</i>

23
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:03,970
<i>I just need your body, baby</i>

24
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,368
<i>Hello</i>

25
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,807
<i>- From dusk till dawn
- Is it me you're looking for?</i>

26
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:12,072
<i>You don't need experience</i>

27
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:13,340
<i>Take</i>

28
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:17,008
<i>- To turn me out
- These broken wings</i>

29
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:20,281
<i>You just leave it all up to me</i>

30
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:25,393
<i>Let's talk about eggs, baby
Let's talk about you and me</i>

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,189
<i>You don't have to be rich</i>

32
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:29,627
<i>- Give me all your loving
- To be my pearl</i>

33
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,735
<i>You don't have to be cool
To rule my world</i>

34
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,999
<i>Ain't no particular song
I'm more compatible with</i>

35
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:40,608
<i>I just want your extra--</i>

36
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:43,507
Boys. Boys.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,511
Give a chick a chance.

38
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:50,119
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

39
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:53,687
<i>I found a new place to dwell</i>

40
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:58,351
<i>It's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel</i>

41
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,964
<i>And I said, "I'm feelin' so lonely, baby</i>

42
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,691
<i>I'm feelin' so lonely</i>

43
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:07,166
<i>Oh, I'm feelin' so lonely"...</i>

44
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:10,329
<i>I could die</i>

45
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:17,211
<i>Don't have to be rich to be my girl</i>

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,374
<i>Don't have to be cool to rule my world</i>

47
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:24,042
<i>You rule my world</i>

48
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,919
<i>You're the particular song
I'm compatible with</i>

49
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,923
<i>I just want your</i>

50
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:34,621
<i>- Extra time
- Extra time</i>

51
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:40,895
<i>- And your kiss
- And your kiss</i>

52
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,403
<i>His mom and dad met in the usual way.</i>

53
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:47,304
<i>The song became love...</i>

54
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,913
<i>...and love became the egg.</i>

55
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,245
Memphis?

56
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,752
- You got it, sugar?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,515
Safe and warm.

58
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:03,181
Hold it tight, now.

59
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,793
Whoa, I think I felt a move in there.

60
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,055
<i>And in the usual way...</i>

61
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,893
<i>...the moms left for the fishing season...</i>

62
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:15,299
<i>...while the dads stayed home
to do egg time.</i>

63
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:16,733
You gonna be okay, Daddy?

64
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:20,433
Oh, sure, honey. We'll be waiting for you,
right here on Lonely Street.

65
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:25,479
<i>I love you more and more, tell me why</i>

66
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:26,945
Bye-bye, now.

67
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:30,415
Goodbye, Norma Jean.
Don't you worry about a thing.

68
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:33,419
<i>Don't wanna let you go</i>

69
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,952
<i>I never can say goodbye, boy</i>

70
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,095
When all others leave...

71
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,334
...we remain!

72
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:49,198
When the sun vanishes...

73
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,297
...we remain!

74
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:55,967
<i>I'm feelin' so lonely
I'm feelin' so lonely--</i>

75
00:04:56,145 --> 00:05:01,139
Heed the wisdoms, brothers!
Make a huddle!

76
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:04,150
Warm thy egg!

77
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,878
Make a huddle!

78
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,251
- Share the cold!
- Share the cold.

79
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:13,191
Each must take his turn
against the icy blast...

80
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:16,389
...if we are to survive the endless night.

81
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:21,162
<i>Raise your voices, brothers!</i>

82
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:23,999
<i>Give praise to the Great 'Guin...</i>

83
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:29,805
<i>...who puts songs in our hearts
and fish in our bellies!</i>

84
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,646
<i>Ain't no particular song
I'm more compatible with</i>

85
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:43,223
Oh, baby, I think I wanna dance now.

86
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,585
No, no, no.

87
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,796
<i>There is a wisdom,
brothers and sisters...</i>

88
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:55,335
<i>...that stands above all others.</i>

89
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:58,668
<i>- Never, ever...
- It's okay.</i>

90
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:00,706
<i>- ...no matter what...
- No harm done. See?</i>

91
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,777
<i>...drop your egg.</i>

92
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,971
No, we're cool. We're cool.

93
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,928
<i>Of the many thousands who sang
through that long night of winter...</i>

94
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:24,294
<i>...it was Memphis
who cried out most fervently...</i>

95
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:29,598
<i>...to turn the Earth
and bring back the sun.</i>

96
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,909
- It's a boy!
- Hey, it's a girl!

97
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,104
- What a peach!
- What a bruiser!

98
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:14,442
- Come here, son.
- Come to Daddy, there you go.

99
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:16,517
Son, you have made
your daddy so proud.

100
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,517
It's all genetics, you know.

101
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,360
Memphis?

102
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,297
Is everything okay?

103
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,968
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

104
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,172
- Is it empty?
- Honey.

105
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:45,439
- Can I have it?
- Gloria.

106
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,776
It's okay, Maurice.

107
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,186
It happens sometimes, Memphis.

108
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:58,885
Yeah.

109
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,591
Wait, you hear that?

110
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,496
- Yeah.
- Hey, I can hear you, buddy.

111
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,666
Oh, your papa's here, it's okay.

112
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,775
Oh, he's okay, Maurice.
Whoa, there it is!

113
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:20,177
That's his little foot there.

114
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,647
There's his other one.

115
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:26,420
That's different.

116
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,489
Hey! Come back here, Mr. Mumble.

117
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,647
Gloria...

118
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,884
She can call him
whatever the heck she likes.

119
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,892
Whoa, little Mumble.

120
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,165
- Mumble? Mumble?
- You okay?

121
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,101
Freezing. Freezing.

122
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,571
Oh, you'll get used to it.

123
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:49,943
Come on. Come to your daddy.

124
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,873
- What do you make of that?
- Little wobbly in the knees.

125
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:56,245
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

126
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,716
What you doing there, boy?

127
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,184
I'm happy, Pa.

128
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,387
What you doing with your feet?

129
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,515
They're happy too.

130
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:07,219
- I wouldn't do that around folks, son.
- Why not?

131
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:10,263
- Well, it just ain't penguin, okay?
- Okay.

132
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:13,800
Yeah. Hey, come on over here.
Get under here. Get warm.

133
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,234
Watch the beak. Watch the beak-- Beak!

134
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,838
The beak.

135
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,737
Okay, good boy.

136
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,913
So late. What's keeping them?

137
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:32,885
Pray, brothers, the Great 'Guin
does not test us with a lean season.

138
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:36,650
Why, Noah? Have we not all been dutiful?

139
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,058
So when you see your mama...

140
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:41,355
- I stand perfectly still.
- You got it.

141
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,260
But how will I know
which one's my mama?

142
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,525
Oh, you'll know.

143
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:48,499
She's got a wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk.

144
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:52,307
And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

145
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:00,809
Hey, wait. I see them. I see them!

146
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:02,211
You're right! You're right!

147
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:04,615
Wives, ho!

148
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,679
Wives, ho!

149
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:08,750
Wives, ho!

150
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:12,652
Wait, no. Wait, no, Mumble, get back here.
No, Mumble! Get back-- Mumble!

151
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:16,093
Mumble! Mumble!

152
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,996
Mumble!

153
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,629
Michelle? Michelle?

154
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:25,239
- Roxanne?
- Michelle?

155
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,174
Alfie?

156
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,508
- Maurice!
- Michelle! Michelle!

157
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:34,843
Mommy!

158
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,609
Oh, she's so darling.

159
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:41,450
Excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me.
Mumble? Mumble?

160
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:42,648
Oh, Mumble.

161
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:45,157
- Mama?
- Mumble!

162
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,489
- Mama?
- Mumble!

163
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,028
Mumble!

164
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,460
Mama? Mama?

165
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,693
- Mumble, boy, where are you?
- Mama!

166
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,406
Memphis?

167
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:05,474
Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama.

168
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,341
- Oh, my.
- Daddy.

169
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,481
So where's the baby?

170
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,951
Well, honey, I'll find him.

171
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:15,215
- You lost the baby? Memphis!
- It's okay.

172
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,256
- Mama? Mama?
- Stay!

173
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,326
- Come to Mommy.
- No, Mumble.

174
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:23,590
Mama, Mama.

175
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,964
Hey, what's wrong with his feet?

176
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:29,866
Oh, that's just a little thing he's got going.
He'll grow out of it.

177
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,939
Mama!

178
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,737
Oh, Memphis, he's gorgeous.

179
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,607
- Isn't he, though?
- Look at you.

180
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,772
I got something for you.

181
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,679
Open up.

182
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,884
Oh, I love the way she does that.

183
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:54,329
<i>W, X, Y and Z</i>

184
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:55,691
Good morning, class.

185
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:58,231
Good morning, Miss Viola.

186
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,390
Right.

187
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,969
Well, today we begin with the most
important lesson you will ever learn...

188
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,436
...at Penguin Elementary.

189
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,268
Does anyone know what that is?

190
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,704
Anyone? Anyone?

191
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:08,866
Someone? Seymour?

192
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,944
- Fishing?
- No.

193
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:12,478
Mumble?

194
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,240
Don't eat yellow snow?

195
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,816
No, that's not it, no.

196
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,148
- It's our Heartsong, Miss.
- Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes.

197
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,188
Without our Heartsong,
we can't be truly penguin, can we?

198
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,155
No.

199
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,693
But, my dears, it's not something
that I can actually teach you.

200
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:30,263
Does anybody know why?
Anyone? Anyone?

201
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,094
You can't teach it to us, ma'am...

202
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:35,897
...because we have to find
our Heartsongs all by ourselves.

203
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,060
Well done, you.

204
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:38,900
It's the voice you hear inside...

205
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:40,666
...who you truly are.

206
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,368
Yes. Thank you, Gloria.
Excellent, lovely, thank you.

207
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,912
So let's all be very still now.

208
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:49,346
Take a moment and let it come to you.

209
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,610
- I got one!
- Pick me!

210
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,721
- Pick me! Pick me!
- One at a time. Yes, Seymour.

211
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:58,019
<i>Don't push me
'Cause I am close to the edge</i>

212
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,129
<i>I'm trying not to lose my head</i>

213
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:04,266
Yes, I like that one. I could
really get jiggy with that. Lovely.

214
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,025
I'm ready. I got one.

215
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,762
Oh, I thought you might, Gloria.

216
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,639
<i>Midnight creeps so slowly</i>

217
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,244
<i>Into hearts of those</i>

218
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:20,007
<i>Who need more than they get</i>

219
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:23,083
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

220
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,277
<i>To a penguin</i>

221
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:31,882
<i>Who has laid too many bets</i>

222
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,855
That's as far as I got so far.

223
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:36,623
- Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely.
- That's beautiful.

224
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,064
Well, Mumble, since
you seem so keen to share.

225
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,806
Mine's sort of a boom and a:

226
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,807
And another boom.

227
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,104
You heard that in there?

228
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,543
- Do you like it?
- I'm afraid that's not a tune.

229
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:56,974
- It's not?
- No, dear. A tune is like:

230
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:02,449
Oh, okay.

231
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:08,491
Who is that?

232
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:11,497
That is the offspring of Memphis
and Norma Jean.

233
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,225
The wee hippity-hopper.

234
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:21,633
It's not funny!

235
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,835
No. No, not in the least.

236
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:27,471
A penguin without a Heartsong
is hardly a penguin at all.

237
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,084
I think he broke my ear.

238
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,949
In all my years, I've never, I mean--

239
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,717
And you having such fine voices.
Well, it's bizarre.

240
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:40,419
Did anything happen, you know,
during early development?

241
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:43,030
No, all fine. Normal incubation.

242
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:44,529
- Right.
- Wasn't it, honey?

243
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,295
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter,
I guess.

244
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,459
Right, right.

245
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,106
- He did hatch a little late--
- Yes, I understand. Yes.

246
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:55,334
- To think he might spend his life alone...
- Quite, quite.

247
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:57,672
...never to meet his one true love.

248
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:01,043
Oh, please, Miss Viola,
isn't there something we can do?

249
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,675
Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan.

250
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:05,842
Mrs. Astrakhan?

251
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,785
If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can.

252
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,390
Can't sing?

253
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,827
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.

254
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,627
Every little penguin has a song.

255
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:21,429
When I have finished...

256
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:25,267
...your singing will be giving everyone
the goose pimple.

257
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:29,343
Now, to begin.
First, we must find a feeling.

258
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,639
Happy feeling, sad feeling.

259
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:36,148
Maybe lonely feeling.

260
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:38,517
You feel it?

261
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,713
Good. Now, let it out.

262
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,586
Be spontaneous.

263
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,827
That, what is that?

264
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,194
I'm being spontan-you-us.

265
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:56,469
Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl?

266
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,004
You want to make the egg?

267
00:15:58,173 --> 00:15:59,265
Oh, yes.

268
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:04,845
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog.
Do not move muscle.

269
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,141
No moving!

270
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:11,352
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

271
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,112
Enough!

272
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:16,485
Okay. We go back to the top.

273
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,586
Forget body. Look inside soul.

274
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:24,460
Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling.

275
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:28,000
So enormous it fills whole body.

276
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,435
It must escape or you explode.

277
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:34,440
- Now, open your little beak.
- Come on.

278
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,738
Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it.

279
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,211
Now... Now...

280
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:45,081
<i>Now</i>

281
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:16,348
Disaster! Catastrophe!

282
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:18,782
I never fail before.

283
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,082
Never! Never!

284
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:34,131
- Well, I thought it was kind of cute.
- But it just ain't penguin, okay?

285
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,568
So what if he's a little different?
I always kind of liked different.

286
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,402
He's not different.
He's a regular emperor penguin.

287
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,601
Hey, you know what? I can leave school.

288
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,973
I can go to work. The three of us.

289
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,981
Whoa, little fella. You ain't going nowhere
till you got yourself an education.

290
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,086
You get them singing muscles
big and strong, you got that?

291
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:53,380
I'll try, Pa.

292
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:57,047
You bet you will. The word "triumph"
starts with "try," and it ends with...?

293
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:00,889
- "Umph."
- That's right. A great big "umph."

294
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,221
I'm going fishing.

295
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,366
Oh, Mumble.

296
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,544
<i>That first hard summer...</i>

297
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:20,739
<i>...while his mom and dad
were working overtime...</i>

298
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,817
<i>...on the great commute to the sea...</i>

299
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:28,320
<i>...Mumble found a place
away from disapproving eyes...</i>

300
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,951
<i>...where a funky little fella
could be himself.</i>

301
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,052
Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird?

302
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,450
Nothing. What are you doing?

303
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:36,455
Nothing. Just dropped in
for a little lunch.

304
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,355
There's food? Here?

305
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,453
Leg or wing?

306
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,064
Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I'm a penguin.

307
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,930
Exactly. The flipper birds,
that's you, eat the fish.

308
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,630
The flying birds, that's me,
eat the flipper bird and the fish.

309
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:54,037
And lately, there ain't a lot of fish.

310
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,302
- So...
- This time I'm getting the juicy bits.

311
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:58,878
- Me first!
- Hey, you want a piece of me?

312
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:01,709
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm trying to think about lunch.

313
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:05,081
Wait! Watch this!

314
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,456
Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen.
For once, we're gonna do this civilized.

315
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,225
- Now, get in line--
- Hey! What's that on your leg?

316
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,528
- What? This little thing?
- Oh, no. Don't start him on that.

317
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:24,831
Shut up! The little flipper bird
asked me a perceptive question.

318
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,703
- A question like that deserves an answer.
- Here we go.

319
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:29,537
I got two words for you:

320
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:32,772
"Alien abduction."

321
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,643
- Oh, you had to ask.
- Have mercy.

322
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,681
Quiet!

323
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:40,253
Now, little buddy,
there is something out there.

324
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:42,515
Creatures. Not like us.

325
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,921
Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too.

326
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:46,583
- Ask me how I know.
- How?

327
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:48,923
Because I've been captured by them,
that's how.

328
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:50,121
Unbelievable.

329
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,267
What do you mean "unbelievable?"
It's true.

330
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,664
I'm sitting on a rock,
minding my own business...

331
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,428
...when suddenly, they're onto me.

332
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,732
These beings, like big ugly penguins.

333
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:01,034
Fat, flabby faces with front-ways eyes...

334
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:04,610
...no feathers, no beaks,
and these-- These appendages.

335
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,472
They probe me. They tie me up.
They strap me down.

336
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:10,516
They take this pointy thing
and they stick it into me.

337
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,246
And then, blackout.

338
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:14,821
Gosh.

339
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,925
I woke up and there's this--
This thing on me.

340
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:22,325
Every flying bird is dissing me,
"Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"

341
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:24,488
It was humiliating.

342
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,826
And then what?

343
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:29,027
It was humiliating.
What more do you want?

344
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,165
They could have eated you.

345
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:35,302
Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:38,708
I guess my pitiful cries for mercy
appealed to their better nature.

347
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:42,048
Can I appeal to your better nature?

348
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:46,015
Nice try, kid, but no.

349
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:50,124
No. No. No!

350
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:52,123
What you doing down there, flipper bird?

351
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:53,283
Get up here.

352
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,089
Get back up here this minute.

353
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:57,424
Oh, great. You let him get away.
Didn't you?

354
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,896
All your screwy alien talk.

355
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,331
- Hey, I'm an abductee.
- Abduct this.

356
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:04,131
- Don't make me call Uncle Angie.
- Oh, fine.

357
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,398
Where youse going? I'm an abductee!

358
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:10,136
- I don't care what you are, I'm hungry!
- Would you like to hear our specials?

359
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:13,577
How about fish? There's no fish.
How about penguin? There's no penguin.

360
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,740
What are we gonna eat?!

361
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:30,265
<i>There's a world where I can go</i>

362
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:35,768
<i>And tell my secrets to</i>

363
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,098
<i>In my room</i>

364
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,709
<i>Paying no mind to his dancing heart...</i>

365
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:46,211
<i>...the kid saw out his school days
at the back of the class...</i>

366
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:49,407
<i>...lost in his imaginings.</i>

367
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:53,252
<i>Now it's dark and I'm--</i>

368
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:58,455
<i>What fabulous worlds lay out there,
far beyond the ice?</i>

369
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:01,619
<i>--I won't be afraid</i>

370
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:03,597
<i>Was there any place...</i>

371
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:07,257
<i>...where one small penguin
without a Heartsong...</i>

372
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:10,132
<i>...could ever truly belong?</i>

373
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:14,071
<i>In my room</i>

374
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:29,055
And so, a thousand generations ago...

375
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:32,751
...our forefathers
forsook our wings for flippers.

376
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:35,954
You graduates going to sea
for the first time...

377
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,827
...are to reap the benefits
of their wise choice.

378
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:42,035
These are lean and uncertain times.

379
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:44,968
But by the power
of the ancient penguin wisdoms...

380
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,234
...we, my brethren, will endure.

381
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,208
- "Blah, blah, blah."
- Norma Jean.

382
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:55,281
Who is he to say my boy can't graduate?
He's not hurting anyone.

383
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,978
--true to our ways
and you will always be worthy of this...

384
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:05,286
<i>...our brave penguin nation. Excelsior!</i>

385
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,303
Ocean, here I come!

386
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,672
You know what? We're gonna have
a little graduation ceremony of our own.

387
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,212
- You mean it, Ma?
- You betcha.

388
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,044
<i>- Excelsior!
- Excelsior!</i>

389
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:32,747
Keep it down.

390
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,355
- Pa.
- Memphis.

391
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:40,962
- Go get them, tiger.
- Thanks, Ma.

392
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:45,895
- Make every moment count!
- Got you, Ma!

393
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,160
- Remember, "Stranger Danger."
- Yeah, sure, Pa.

394
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:52,534
And watch out for those leopard seals
and them killer whales.

395
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:54,072
Mark this, Noah.

396
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:59,737
That boy was always a bad egg.
I'm telling you, no good will come of this.

397
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:11,154
Guys!

398
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:14,094
Wait up!

399
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:39,781
What do you think?

400
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,719
- You first.
- No, you first.

401
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,326
No. No, no, no.

402
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:52,092
Stop pushing!

403
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:59,972
- What was that?
- I think it was the fuzzball.

404
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:07,240
See any blood?

405
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:12,550
What you waiting for?

406
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:12,371
Hey, Gloria!

407
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,948
Gloria, I adore-ia. I'd like to see more-ia.

408
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:17,778
Gloria.

409
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:39,103
- Mumble?
- Gloria.

410
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,069
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

411
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,771
Fall back, coming through!

412
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:10,236
Gloria? All my life,
I've wanted to say that you're so--

413
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:12,464
- Fish.
- Yeah. You're so fish.

414
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,699
No. Fish!

415
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:16,741
Fish!

416
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,771
Oh, that's mine.

417
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:28,689
- That's lousy.
- You didn't get one?

418
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:33,586
Sorry.

419
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:34,990
Gloria. You got one?

420
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:37,631
- Nope. Not this time.
- You have it.

421
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,495
- Thank you, Mumble, but it's yours.
- I want you to have it.

422
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:43,330
- No. You caught it. You eat it.
- I want you to--

423
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:45,735
Skua! You get back here!

424
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:57,042
- Come on.
- Mumble! Let go!

425
00:28:57,218 --> 00:29:00,210
Mumble! Let go!

426
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,920
You just let him get away!

427
00:29:15,703 --> 00:29:18,672
- Is he breathing?
- He's certainly not eating.

428
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,241
Mumble? Are you okay?

429
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:24,578
Mumble?

430
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:28,609
Take the fish.

431
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:31,251
- What?
- Take the stupid fish.

432
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:33,512
Oh, okay.

433
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,696
Thank you, Mumble.

434
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,101
You're welcome.

479
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:12,143
Mumble!

480
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:15,373
- Who do you think you are?
- Yeah, you're spoiling it for everybody.

481
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,485
- Take a flying leap.
- Yeah, jump in the lake.

482
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:29,592
<i>Where is my baby?</i>

483
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,397
<i>Anybody find me, find me
Find me, find me</i>

484
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:42,908
<i>Somebody</i>

485
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,695
Okay, fellas. Cut it out.

486
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,170
I'm completely terrified.

487
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:16,871
Gloria?

488
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,539
Guys?

489
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:25,281
Get up here or I'll come in after you.

490
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,338
- Safe!
- Oh, yeah!

491
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,710
- You the bomb, bro.
- That's a 9.8.

492
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:04,112
- I give you 10.
- Why?

493
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,819
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.
Bring it. Bring it on.

494
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:12,186
- Kiss my frozen tushy.
- Kiss it. Kiss it.

495
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:19,530
Come here, sausage.
I take you with ketchup.

496
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,191
But first you got to catch up.

497
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,362
Oh, here he comes.
You better move in a half an hour.

498
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:32,503
Let's get out of here.

499
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:36,009
- Hey, amigo, do that again.
- Do what?

500
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:38,277
- That thing with the--
- The clickety-clickety.

501
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:39,441
- That.
- Yeah, do it.

502
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,215
- Come on, come on.
- Well, I just kind of go:

503
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:46,123
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, nice.

504
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:48,558
And then this:

505
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,664
Way to go! It's amazing!

506
00:35:58,172 --> 00:36:00,732
- Oh, the little whisker.
- Look at him.

507
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,207
Oh, he's leaving.
Oh, no, that was his face!

508
00:36:04,378 --> 00:36:07,040
Remember, dumplings,
I know where you live.

509
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:09,149
Yeah, it's called land, lard face.

510
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:11,845
Flop back anytime, rubber butt!

511
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:17,188
See you, fatty.

512
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,292
That's cool. "See you, fatty!"

513
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,190
Did it take you a while
to come up with that one?

514
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,024
All right, way to go, tall guy.

515
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:26,359
Give me fin, give me fin.

516
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:29,829
<i>To the left, to the right
I'm getting it, oh, yes</i>

517
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:31,665
<i>Look out, here I go</i>

518
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,037
<i>I got it, I got it, I don't, I had it</i>

519
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,201
Oh, my stomach hurts. I gotta pee.

520
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,812
Ain't you coming, tall boy?

521
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,819
What, you got something better to do?

522
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:50,787
- No.
- Well, then, come along, Fluffy, let's go.

523
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,235
Hey, stretch, you like to party?

524
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,207
Party? I guess so.

525
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:12,710
Well, stick with us, baby.

526
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,906
Yeah, because we practically
own the action here.

527
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,074
<i>Mambo!</i>

528
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:22,455
Everybody's so... spontan-you-us.

529
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:24,318
Spontan-you-us!

530
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,789
And these are the bad times!

531
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,293
- Yeah, our food chain go loco.
- Everyone a bit down.

532
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:32,193
But it ain't gonna stop no party!

533
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,260
- Viva la party!
- Watch me work.

534
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:38,405
Gosh, he's eating rocks.

535
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,336
- You hear what he said?
- "Eating rocks."

536
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,171
But he had a rock in his mouth.

537
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,712
That's no rock, hombre. It's love stones.

538
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:50,874
- For building the nest.
- The one with the most pebbles wins.

539
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:53,418
You know:

540
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:55,612
<i>You're not interested in chicas?</i>

541
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,087
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You kidding?

542
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:00,250
<i>Without us, the chicas got no boom.</i>

543
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:03,995
- Why aren't you collecting pebbles?
- Pebbles, schmebbles, man.

544
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:07,760
We got personality, with a capital Y.
Why? Because we're hot.

545
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:10,699
Watch and learn, tall boy.

546
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,534
- Hey. Hey, baby.
- Over here, mama. Chicky baby.

547
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,141
- Baby.
- What are you looking at?

548
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:16,936
- You looking at me?
- Come over here.

549
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:19,739
<i>- Come on, mamí.
- You see something you like, yes?</i>

550
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:22,439
I don't think so. Not tonight, baby.

551
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:25,244
Oh, don't be so snooty, booty.

552
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:28,252
<i>That's the way... you like it, you like it</i>

553
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:31,323
<i>You want it, I got it
Could've had it, you missed it</i>

554
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,426
Look at the feet, huh?

555
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,726
- Where'd you learn that?
- The big guy.

556
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,422
- He from out of town.
- He with us.

557
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,092
- Do it again.
- Do it, baby. Show me those flipping feet.

558
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,933
- No, no, no. Sorry, girls.
- Some other time maybe.

559
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:49,872
You guys are soft in the head, okay?

560
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,400
Let's go.

561
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,673
- Leave them wanting more, you know?
- Hold back till the season.

562
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,607
- You show them what you got.
- Either you got it or not.

563
00:38:57,785 --> 00:39:00,413
- And the Amigos?
- We got it!

564
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:03,847
You think I could get some of it?

565
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:08,826
Hombre, you've got so much already,
you dangerous, baby.

566
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:10,554
You really think so?

567
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:12,460
You kidding? With moves like yours...

568
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:15,101
...you must have all the ladies
drooling at your feet.

569
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,433
- I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, listen to him. He's so cute.

570
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,097
Let me tell something to you.

571
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:25,377
Except for me, tall boy,
you got the most charisma of anybody.

572
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:29,073
Put that ego away, Ramon,
you're gonna hurt someone.

573
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,152
You so jealous. Just a moment.
I hear people wanting something.

574
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,413
Me!

575
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:39,015
<i>- Mambo
- Okay, you girlies, Mambo</i>

576
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:42,720
<i>One more time now, mambo
Mambo, mambo, mambo</i>

577
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,888
<i>Mambo!</i>

578
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:08,146
Your turn, your turn.

579
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,051
Oh, get down.

580
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:20,264
Man, this guy is so accidentally cool.

581
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,261
Okay, okay.

582
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:24,563
Mama!

583
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:39,777
Mommy!

584
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:04,043
Come on, Fluffy.

585
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:08,639
Oh, I love gravity.

586
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:12,149
- Oh, I feel like reminiscing.
- Remin-icing?

587
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,574
- It was too close.
- Come on, come on.

588
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:46,245
Hey, guys! Where are we going?

589
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:48,540
- We relocating.
- Placing ourselves elsewhere.

590
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:51,685
- But that thing, what was it?
- How should we know?

591
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:54,252
- We're penguins.
- Very little penguins.

592
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:58,380
But where did it come from?
It's so weird, so alien.

593
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:00,959
- What's he talking about?
- Some hombre called Elian.

594
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:03,596
I don't know a guy Elian.
I knew a guy named Estevan--

595
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:06,096
- Not Estevan, Elian.
- Guys, we have a mystery here.

596
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:07,393
A mind-boggling mystery.

597
00:43:07,568 --> 00:43:09,502
So? What are we
supposed to do about it?

598
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,900
Amigos, we gotta get
to the bottom of this thing.

599
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:18,042
Big guy, let me tell something to you.
Come close. Don't be afraid.

600
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:19,907
- You want answers?
- Yeah.

601
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,445
- That's all you need?
- Yeah.

602
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:22,604
- Nothing else?
- No.

603
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:24,148
Then this is very easy.

604
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:25,478
You go see Lovelace.

605
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,247
- Lovelace.
- Go see Lovelace.

606
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:30,413
- Genius, Ramon. You are the man.
- Thank you.

607
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,354
- I take a moment for myself.
- Let's go.

608
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,788
- Bow down.
- You the man.

609
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:36,293
- That's enough, I feel your love.
- Who's Lovelace?

610
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:38,795
- Lovelace is the guru.
- Go see Lovelace.

611
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:41,059
- He got the answer to everything.
- Everything.

612
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:43,328
- Really?
- Ask him, he never wrong.

613
00:43:43,504 --> 00:43:46,769
But first, you gonna need a pebble.

614
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:54,875
<i>Hold it, y'all. I have a warning
for the audience.</i>

615
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,015
<i>Ladies, please, avert your eyes...</i>

616
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:02,519
<i>...because I've been known to hypnotize.</i>

617
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,826
<i>You heard the voice,
now you're about to meet...</i>

618
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:11,021
<i>...the one and only Lovelace,
in the flesh...</i>

619
00:44:11,198 --> 00:44:16,261
<i>...right here, right on, right now.</i>

620
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:19,770
The devotion, please.

621
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:21,668
Oh, yeah.

622
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:24,367
And now, your question.

623
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:25,978
Señor Lovelace...

624
00:44:26,513 --> 00:44:29,676
...my wife has disappeared. Is she alive?

625
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,586
<i>Is she alive now?
Separate the truth from the jive</i>

626
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:40,351
<i>Speak to me, oh, mystic beings</i>

627
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,722
Yes! She's happy
and you're in her thoughts.

628
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:47,628
Is she with another male?

629
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:50,736
One pebble, one question. Next!

630
00:44:50,904 --> 00:44:53,930
Oh, Serene One.
Please ask the mystic beings...

631
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,700
...will I ever be as rich as you?

632
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:59,168
In your dreams, Jean. Next!

633
00:44:59,346 --> 00:45:01,337
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Get up there, big guy.

634
00:45:01,515 --> 00:45:05,383
- That's it. Don't be scared.
- Gentleman, please! One at a time.

635
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:07,486
- We with him.
- Yeah, we together.

636
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:10,088
- He got a beautiful question. Go.
- Do it.

637
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:11,781
Just don't look him in the eye.

638
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,950
Have you ever been abducted by aliens?

639
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,952
Excuse me?
What kind of question is that? Next!

640
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,120
No, wait, señor.

641
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:22,598
I met a skua once, with something like that
on his foot, said he was abducted by aliens.

642
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:27,537
This, friend, is my sacred talisman...

643
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:30,237
<i>Talisman, talisman</i>

644
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:34,074
...bestowed on me by the mystic beings...

645
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:36,773
<i>Mystic beings</i>

646
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,852
...during my epic journey
of enlightenment...

647
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,145
...to the forbidden shore.

648
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,621
<i>Forbidden shore</i>

649
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:47,818
Oh, say it one more.

650
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,556
<i>- Forbidden shore
- Oh, yeah</i>

651
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:53,632
Wait, you saw mystic beings?

652
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:57,100
I hear them! They speak through me!

653
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,330
Oh, yeah.

654
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,498
There's a power that makes me
stand upon this tower!

655
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,702
Did they have front-ways eyes?
Did they probe you? Strap you down?

656
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:09,280
Enough! "Did they probe me?"

657
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,248
Too many questions!
You don't have enough pebbles, fool.

658
00:46:12,753 --> 00:46:14,618
You haven't answered
any of my questions.

659
00:46:14,788 --> 00:46:18,383
- How many questions he got?
- We've all got stuff to ask!

660
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:24,321
Enough!

661
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,358
You bring this stranger before me.

662
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:33,097
He doubts my powers.
He compares me to a skua.

663
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:35,465
The voices are shrieking in my head.

664
00:46:35,642 --> 00:46:38,543
They say, "Lovelace, who is this fool?

665
00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:44,212
Tell him! Tell him to go forth
and multiply!"

666
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:45,975
Come to think of it...

667
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:49,919
...why don't we all go forth and multiply?

668
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,251
- Lovelace.
- What he saying?

669
00:46:52,426 --> 00:46:54,223
- It's mating season.
- Already?

670
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:58,421
I will retire now
to my couch of perpetual indulgence.

671
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,033
- Okay, ladies, who's first?
- Me!

672
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:03,965
One at a time. Don't touch the talisman,
baby, please.

673
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:07,402
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about us?

674
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,338
<i>Lovelace, Lovelace, Lovelace!</i>

675
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:12,274
Hear me!

676
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:14,471
There's not enough love in the world.

677
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:16,707
Turn to the penguin next to you.

678
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:19,284
Put your flippers up.
Fluff him up a little bit.

679
00:47:19,453 --> 00:47:21,921
And give him a great big hug.

680
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,250
Okay, ladies.

681
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,790
Oh, make that little noise again, girl.

682
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,521
Hey, what he got we don't got, man?

683
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:32,562
- What you hugging me for?
- He told me to.

684
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:33,961
- Get away.
- No, you like it.

685
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:35,158
Get off him, Ramon.

686
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:37,326
Stretch, got any stones
where you come from?

687
00:47:37,504 --> 00:47:39,631
- We don't collect stones.
- You don't? Why not?

688
00:47:39,806 --> 00:47:40,795
We live on the ice.

689
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:42,771
So how you win the heart of the ladies?

690
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,434
Well, we sing.

691
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:50,039
- Stop! That's crazy!
- You're kidding, right?

692
00:47:50,217 --> 00:47:52,048
No. We sing to each other.

693
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:55,211
If someone special likes your song,
you know...

694
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:57,220
Oh, and you have someone special?

695
00:47:57,391 --> 00:48:00,724
- A tall beauty in your dark romantic past?
- Of which you never speak?

696
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:01,986
Well, sort of.

697
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:04,960
Hey, let's go check it out.
Maybe she got some friends.

698
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,121
I like them tall.

699
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,699
It's never gonna work.

700
00:48:07,868 --> 00:48:09,631
- Hey, big guy.
- It's the loving season.

701
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,293
All you gotta do is sing.

702
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,938
That's the problem. I can't.

703
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:15,574
- You a bird, ain't you?
- All birds can sing.

704
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:18,006
<i>I don't sing like the birdie do</i>

705
00:48:19,246 --> 00:48:20,736
All right.

706
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:22,472
<i>Find me, find me</i>

707
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:25,680
What's he doing?

708
00:48:25,852 --> 00:48:28,582
- I think he's singing.
- I know singing, that's not singing.

709
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:34,151
I heard an animal once do that,
but then they rolled him over, he was dead.

710
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:38,153
Yeah. And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

711
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,095
You in tragic shape, man.

712
00:48:40,267 --> 00:48:42,428
- Don't worry. We can fix it.
- We can?

713
00:48:42,603 --> 00:48:44,764
- Absolutely. We can. We can.
- We can?

714
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:47,372
- Really?
- Yes! Let me tell something to you.

715
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:50,908
- Come close. Closer. You wanna sing?
- Yeah.

716
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:52,568
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

717
00:48:52,746 --> 00:48:55,146
You making fun of me?
Then this is very easy.

718
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:58,409
Really? Gosh, if I could sing,
that would change everything.

719
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:02,783
You will sing. You just got to do
exactly what I say.

720
00:49:02,956 --> 00:49:05,083
- Okay.
- Did I say "okay"?

721
00:49:05,258 --> 00:49:06,748
- No.
- No. What did I say?

722
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:10,454
- Do exactly what you say.
- Exactly what I say.

723
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:18,827
<i>Don't push me
'Cause I'm close to the edge</i>

724
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:25,173
<i>I'm trying not to lose my...</i>

725
00:49:26,146 --> 00:49:27,704
<i>Gloria</i>

726
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,076
<i>It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder</i>

727
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,478
<i>How I keep from going under</i>

728
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:35,349
<i>Midnight creeps so slowly</i>

<i>You say your prayers

Mumble.

745
00:50:57,571 --> 00:51:00,131
Oh, hi, Gloria.

746
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:08,240
And this is you?

747
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:12,541
Sure, it's me. You like?

748
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:17,987
Well, I would, if it were really you, yeah.

749
00:51:19,092 --> 00:51:20,889
Well, it is me, sort of.

750
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:22,756
Yeah.

751
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:24,760
Turn around.

00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:26,489
- Turn around.
- Why?

753
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,725
- Well, why not?
- Well...

754
00:51:31,638 --> 00:51:33,071
- What do you know?
- Yeah.

00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,737
Hello.

- Okay.

764
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,858
Mumble, what could
you possibly be thinking?

765
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,057
I don't know what else to do.

00:54:00,687 --> 00:54:05,215
<i>Into hearts of men
Who need more than they get</i>

791
00:54:05,392 --> 00:54:07,690
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

792
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:12,560
<i>To a penguin who has laid too many bets</i>

793
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:16,133
<i>The mirror stares you in the face</i>

794
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:19,500
<i>And says, "Baby... it don't work"</i>

795
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:23,200
<i>You say your prayers
Though you don't care</i>

796
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:26,345
<i>You dance and shake the hurt</i>

797
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,878
<i>Dance!</i>

798
00:54:28,048 --> 00:54:29,140
Mumble!

799
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:33,514
<i>Boogie wonderland</i>

800
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,587
<i>Dance, dance, dance</i>

801
00:54:35,755 --> 00:54:36,915
<i>Mumble</i>

802
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:39,217
<i>Boogie wonderland</i>

803
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:41,917
<i>Check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out</i>

804
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,488
<i>My brothers</i>

805
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:55,740
<i>You look so beautiful to me, baby</i>

806
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:06,980
- Mumble.
- Hey, Miss Viola.

807
00:55:07,153 --> 00:55:12,785
<i>- All the love in the world can't be gone
- Mumble!</i>

808
00:55:12,959 --> 00:55:17,919
<i>- All the need to be loved can't be wrong
- Mumble!</i>

809
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:19,656
Disgraceful!

810
00:55:21,334 --> 00:55:23,063
Who do they think they are?

811
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:26,831
Where is Noah?
This is getting out of hand.

812
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:28,799
Go!

813
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,479
Hey, Memphis. It's your boy, Mumble.

814
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:38,882
- Mumble?
- Mumble?

815
00:55:39,052 --> 00:55:42,544
No, no. No, it's "Mambo." O!

816
00:55:42,722 --> 00:55:46,180
Baby. They're saying, "Mumble."

817
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,604
Boogie!

818
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:10,076
Behold, Noah, look!

819
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:16,246
This was an omen from the start
and now we have this uprising.

820
00:56:16,423 --> 00:56:19,950
Stop! Stop!

821
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:23,926
Stop this unruly nonsense!

822
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:28,567
Stop it right now!

823
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,237
A little self-control, if you please!

824
00:56:32,405 --> 00:56:37,104
You bring this disorder, this aberration,
to the very heart of our community.

825
00:56:37,277 --> 00:56:38,539
Have you lost your minds?

826
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:40,474
- We're just having fun.
- Harmless fun.

827
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:44,879
"Harmless"? It is this kind of backsliding
that has brought the scarcity upon us.

828
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:47,576
Excuse me, smiley. Can you speak
plain penguin, please?

829
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:50,416
He thinks the food shortage
has something to do with me.

830
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:54,253
Do you not understand that we can
only survive here when we're in harmony?

831
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:57,658
When you and your foreign friends
lead us into your easy ways...

832
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,458
...you offend the Great 'Guin.

833
00:56:59,632 --> 00:57:01,566
You invite him to withhold his bounty.

834
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:05,329
- He rules the seasons.
- He giveth and he can taketh away.

835
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,996
Wait a minute.
Happy feet can't cause a famine.

836
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:11,769
If thy kind of pagan display
did not cause it, then what did?

837
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:14,243
I think it comes from outside.
Way beyond the ice.

838
00:57:14,414 --> 00:57:16,746
There are things out there,
things we don't understand.

839
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:18,577
- Mysteries.
- Mind-boggling mysteries.

840
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:20,150
- Mystic beings.
- Yeah, aliens.

841
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,947
- He's mad.
- No, aliens.

842
00:57:22,122 --> 00:57:23,783
- I hear they're smart.
- He's insane.

843
00:57:23,957 --> 00:57:26,585
No, they might be smarter than all of us.
Who knows?

844
00:57:26,759 --> 00:57:29,159
He drove the fish away,
now he's ranting this rubbish!

845
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:32,594
- Hey, let me tell something to you.
- Don't touch me, you filthy vermin.

846
00:57:32,765 --> 00:57:34,596
- Hey, watch it.
- And so it follows.

847
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:38,259
Dissent leads to division
and division leads us to doom.

848
00:57:38,438 --> 00:57:41,498
- You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go.
- Hear, hear.

849
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:44,108
Don't you take one step, sweetheart.

850
00:57:44,277 --> 00:57:47,769
You have as much right to be here
as any of these daffy old fools.

851
00:57:48,615 --> 00:57:51,209
Norma Jean, I'll deal with this.

852
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,851
Pa?

853
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:58,213
Mumble, you must renounce
your so-called friends...

854
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,416
...your peculiar thoughts,
your strange ways.

855
00:58:00,593 --> 00:58:01,958
- Memphis.
- If we are devout...

856
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:04,255
...sincere in our praise,
the fish will return.

857
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:07,695
- But, Pa--
- Listen, boy, I was a backslider myself.

858
00:58:07,867 --> 00:58:10,131
I was careless
and now we're paying the price.

859
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,895
What's this got to do with Mumble?

860
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,006
- It's why he is the way he is.
- There's nothing wrong with him!

861
00:58:15,175 --> 00:58:18,235
- Face it, our son's all messed up.
- He's not messed up, hear me?

862
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,379
- Believe me, I know.
- How can you say that?

863
00:58:20,547 --> 00:58:23,641
Because when he was just an egg,
I dropped him!

864
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:25,579
Memphis.

865
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,978
Mumble.

866
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,851
Oh, my poor little Mumble.

867
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:35,688
But, Mom, I'm perfectly fine.

868
00:58:35,862 --> 00:58:37,853
- No. No, you're not, boy.
- That's right.

869
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:41,592
For all our sakes, you must stop
this freakiness with the feet.

870
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:45,898
Your father speaks wisely.
Heed his suffering heart and repent.

871
00:58:46,072 --> 00:58:48,267
But it just doesn't make any sense.

872
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,500
Then your arrogance leaves us no choice!

873
00:58:50,677 --> 00:58:51,666
No, wait.

874
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:56,945
Please, son, you can do this.
It ain't so hard.

875
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:02,548
Don't ask me to change, Pa,
because I can't.

876
00:59:06,882 --> 00:59:10,784
And that, my brethren, is the end of it.

877
00:59:10,953 --> 00:59:12,853
You, begone!

878
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:19,090
- Mumble.
- No, Ma, it's okay. It's okay.

879
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:22,991
Let me tell something to you.

880
00:59:23,165 --> 00:59:25,292
When I find out
what's happening to the fish...

881
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:27,965
...I'll be back.

882
00:59:28,804 --> 00:59:30,431
Let me through? Let me through.

883
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:32,699
- Mumble, you don't have to go.
- Let it be.

884
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:35,343
- Gloria.
- No. No, Dad, this isn't fair.

885
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:37,741
Gloria, listen to your father.

886
00:59:38,247 --> 00:59:43,810
<i>My folks were always putting him down</i>

887
00:59:43,986 --> 00:59:46,853
<i>Down, down, down</i>

888
00:59:47,022 --> 00:59:51,288
<i>They said he came
From the wrong side of town</i>

889
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:54,952
<i>He came from the wrong side of town</i>

890
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:58,224
<i>They told me he was bad</i>

891
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,492
<i>So bad</i>

892
00:59:59,668 --> 01:00:03,604
<i>- But I know he was sad
- So sad</i>

893
01:00:03,772 --> 01:00:08,937
<i>I'll never forget him
The leader of the pack</i>

894
01:00:09,111 --> 01:00:12,945
We sing the heart
of our true friend, Mumble.

895
01:00:13,115 --> 01:00:19,111
<i>You are a nation of peeny-weeny,
piffling, piccolini, piddly-diddly pouft!</i>

896
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:22,255
Together, we prevail.

897
01:00:22,424 --> 01:00:24,289
In the wisdoms, we trust.

898
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,394
We trust.

899
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:31,363
<i>Look out</i>

900
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:36,061
<i>Look out</i>

901
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:39,841
<i>Look out</i>

902
01:00:40,008 --> 01:00:44,638
<i>Look</i>

903
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:48,909
<i>Look out</i>

904
01:00:52,588 --> 01:00:56,786
Don't worry, tall guy.
My father also called me a pitiful loser.

905
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,085
Look how I turn out.

906
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,454
You're not helping, Ramon.

907
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:03,325
He gonna be okay. All he gotta do
is find out what happened to the fish.

908
01:01:03,499 --> 01:01:05,467
- How he gonna do that?
- He think of something.

909
01:01:05,634 --> 01:01:07,625
- The aliens.
- What?

910
01:01:07,803 --> 01:01:10,636
- I'm gonna talk to the aliens.
- How you gonna find aliens?

911
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:13,366
- Lovelace.
- He don't like you. He don't like you at all.

912
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:15,635
That's okay. I'll appeal
to his better nature.

913
01:01:15,811 --> 01:01:18,279
- How you gonna do that?
- Cruel and unusual punishment?

914
01:01:18,447 --> 01:01:20,938
- Unimaginable torture?
- Imaginable torture?

915
01:01:21,116 --> 01:01:23,311
- Your singing?
- No!

916
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:25,817
<i>"Can anybody find me"...</i>

917
01:01:26,221 --> 01:01:28,883
- You're cracking the ice!
- Avalanche!

918
01:01:29,057 --> 01:01:30,718
Yes, okay. Thank you.

919
01:01:41,136 --> 01:01:44,037
Lovelace. You there?

920
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:46,333
Lovelace!

921
01:01:49,211 --> 01:01:51,008
Lovelace.

922
01:01:56,051 --> 01:01:57,678
Lovelace?

923
01:01:57,853 --> 01:01:59,184
Is this a bad time?

924
01:01:59,354 --> 01:02:01,288
I know we don't have
an appointment, but--

925
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:03,583
Just one question and
I want a straight answer.

926
01:02:03,759 --> 01:02:05,351
Where do I find the mystic beings?

927
01:02:08,196 --> 01:02:10,187
Why don't he speak?

928
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,828
Lovelace, you okay?

929
01:02:16,305 --> 01:02:19,502
- Boy, he's possessed.
- It's a seizure! It's a seizure!

930
01:02:19,675 --> 01:02:21,142
- Open the beak.
- Grab his tongue.

931
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:23,904
He's choking. That thing
around his neck, it's too tight.

932
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,707
- Well, why didn't you say so?
- On three.

933
01:02:26,882 --> 01:02:31,148
Stop! Listen! No! Amigos! Amigos! Stop!

934
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,311
- What?
- You're hurting him.

935
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,857
Any better?

936
01:02:37,025 --> 01:02:39,550
Lovelace, how did you get
that thing around your neck?

937
01:02:39,728 --> 01:02:43,061
- It was bestowed on him.
- By the mystic beings.

938
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:45,392
- They didn't bestow it?
- No.

939
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:48,559
Oh, come on, he don't know
what he's saying.

940
01:02:48,737 --> 01:02:51,729
You were swimming
and it just got caught around your neck.

941
01:02:51,907 --> 01:02:54,808
Oh, no way. He the guru.

942
01:02:55,811 --> 01:02:59,008
Lovelace, did you ever actually meet
a mystic being?

943
01:02:59,748 --> 01:03:01,375
Officially?

944
01:03:02,851 --> 01:03:03,840
No.

945
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:05,953
I knew it! It's all a lie.

946
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:07,986
But this belongs to someone.

947
01:03:08,156 --> 01:03:10,852
If we could find them,
I bet you they could take it off.

948
01:03:11,259 --> 01:03:15,491
Show me where you found it. I'm sure
they could help us. You and me both.

949
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,233
Two words, three syllables.

950
01:03:20,402 --> 01:03:22,199
- What is it?
- You're dying?

951
01:03:22,371 --> 01:03:26,068
No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life.

952
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:27,833
You're passing gas.

953
01:03:29,244 --> 01:03:31,235
Now he thinks he's an elephant seal.

954
01:03:31,413 --> 01:03:33,347
No, no, no. Go over the mountains.

955
01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:36,450
- Go over the mountains!
- Through the land of the elephant seals.

956
01:03:36,618 --> 01:03:41,214
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals.
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals!

957
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:54,328
- Wait.
- What?

958
01:03:55,237 --> 01:03:57,228
I hear voices.

959
01:03:57,406 --> 01:03:59,067
- There is a voice.
- Where?

960
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:02,802
- There's a little voice on the wind.
- Mumble!

961
01:04:02,978 --> 01:04:04,275
- "Mambo"?
- "Mambo"?

962
01:04:04,446 --> 01:04:05,879
- Listen.
- Mumble Happy Feet.

963
01:04:06,415 --> 01:04:07,643
- Gloria?
- Gloria!

964
01:04:07,816 --> 01:04:08,805
Gloria?

965
01:04:08,984 --> 01:04:11,509
Hey, you got a stalker.
She's obsessed with you, man.

966
01:04:15,123 --> 01:04:17,591
I can't believe it's you.

967
01:04:17,759 --> 01:04:19,818
Of course it's me.

968
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:22,824
What are you doing here?

969
01:04:22,998 --> 01:04:26,195
<i>All the love in the world can't be gone</i>

970
01:04:26,368 --> 01:04:30,236
<i>All the need to be loved can't be wrong</i>

971
01:04:30,405 --> 01:04:33,135
- Oh, my.
- So which way, twinkletoes?

972
01:04:33,308 --> 01:04:36,675
No, no, no. If you come,
you may never get back home.

973
01:04:36,845 --> 01:04:38,210
Fine by me.

974
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:43,841
Gloria, you have a life back there.
I don't. I mean, we don't. Not out here.

975
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:47,113
How can we keep an egg safe?
That's if we ever had an egg.

976
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:49,883
Well, I don't need an egg to be happy.

977
01:04:50,058 --> 01:04:54,085
You say that now, but what about later
when all your friends have eggs?

978
01:04:55,464 --> 01:04:56,692
Then I'll have you.

979
01:04:58,133 --> 01:05:01,534
Now he's going to pledge
his soul forever.

980
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:02,829
- Gloria.
- Here it comes.

981
01:05:03,004 --> 01:05:09,933
I'm a particular kind of guy,
the kind of guy who needs his own space.

982
01:05:10,212 --> 01:05:12,077
It's not you, it's me.

983
01:05:12,247 --> 01:05:14,681
I'm just not up for a serious relationship
right now.

984
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:18,183
What he's trying to do now
is he's pushing her away. Let's watch.

985
01:05:18,353 --> 01:05:21,845
No matter what you say or do,
you're stuck with me.

986
01:05:22,023 --> 01:05:25,117
Oh, come on. As if you're not
totally thrilled that I'm here.

987
01:05:25,293 --> 01:05:28,751
- Now she got him on the ropes.
- See, right there is your problem.

988
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:30,830
You think you're irresistible, don't you?

989
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:33,331
I don't care where you're from,
that's got to hurt.

990
01:05:33,502 --> 01:05:36,232
- Excuse me?
- Gloria's so gorgeous, Gloria's so talented.

991
01:05:36,404 --> 01:05:37,393
What?

992
01:05:37,572 --> 01:05:39,972
Just because
you can hit a few high notes.

993
01:05:40,142 --> 01:05:42,269
You got a problem with my singing?

994
01:05:42,444 --> 01:05:44,674
No, it's perfectly fine.

995
01:05:44,846 --> 01:05:46,711
- "Fine"?
- If you like that sort of thing.

996
01:05:46,882 --> 01:05:49,476
- It's a little Nana Tootsie for my taste.
- What?

997
01:05:49,651 --> 01:05:51,778
You know, showy, flashy, froufrou.

998
01:05:51,953 --> 01:05:53,443
- "Froufrou"?
- That's right.

999
01:05:53,622 --> 01:05:57,752
Coming from someone who thinks it's cool
to jig up and down really fast on the spot...

1000
01:05:57,926 --> 01:06:00,190
...like some twitchy idiot.

1001
01:06:03,965 --> 01:06:06,593
You stubborn, hippity-hoppity fool!

1002
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:08,633
Right back at you.

1003
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:21,471
Amigo, that was a good thing you do.

1004
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,914
She is going to be so much better off
without you.

1005
01:06:24,085 --> 01:06:27,213
She is going to find a good, steady guy
to comfort her...

1006
01:06:27,389 --> 01:06:30,586
...and love her up real good
and raise a big family.

1007
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:32,989
- Ramon.
- And then she's going to let herself go--

1008
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:36,289
Ramon. He's hurting. He's hurting bad.

1009
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:41,128
Oh, listen, listen, don't hold it in
or you explode. You got to let it out.

1010
01:06:41,303 --> 01:06:43,999
You just let it out. You let it out.

1011
01:06:44,172 --> 01:06:47,039
Everybody, turn away for a moment.

1012
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:49,507
<i>If she leave him now</i>

1013
01:06:49,678 --> 01:06:54,877
<i>She take away the biggest part of him</i>

1014
01:06:57,252 --> 01:06:59,186
<i>Don't, baby, please, don't go</i>

1015
01:06:59,354 --> 01:07:01,219
Please, guys.

1016
01:07:01,389 --> 01:07:03,380
No more singing.

1017
01:07:13,969 --> 01:07:16,631
Then she say to me, "Enough,
you are making me nauseous."

1018
01:07:16,805 --> 01:07:20,536
So I become silent, almost moody,
and you know what she says?

1019
01:07:20,709 --> 01:07:22,768
"You never share. You got to let it out."

1020
01:07:22,944 --> 01:07:25,708
- Ramon, come on.
- Let it out. Let it out.

1021
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:27,314
Stop it! Let it go.

1022
01:07:27,482 --> 01:07:31,145
- I never had a good relationship in my life.
- Give him a hug. Give him a hug.

1023
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:32,547
- I let it out!
- There we go.

1024
01:07:32,721 --> 01:07:35,281
- I let it out.
- I know. Get over it.

1025
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:38,255
- Can you keep going?
- Yeah.

1026
01:07:38,426 --> 01:07:41,623
- What's that smell?
- It wasn't me.

1027
01:07:42,764 --> 01:07:46,530
Hey, Fluffy, we're following you.
Get up here.

1028
01:07:54,676 --> 01:07:58,737
So these elephant seals,
they're not penguin eaters, are they?

1029
01:07:58,914 --> 01:08:01,314
I don't know.
I believe they are herbivores.

1030
01:08:01,483 --> 01:08:03,348
- What?
- You know, kelp-suckers.

1031
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:05,850
Here we go, Lovelace. Come on.

1032
01:08:07,522 --> 01:08:09,387
Jump in time. Jump in time.

1033
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:12,321
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay, okay, okay. Ready?

1034
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,930
I can do this. I can do this.
I got to trick myself.

1035
01:08:18,099 --> 01:08:19,999
Boy, look at that. What?

1036
01:08:35,951 --> 01:08:40,513
You blokes better be lost,
because trespassing's a crime.

1037
01:08:40,689 --> 01:08:44,682
- We're just passing through.
- Yeah. We're with him.

1038
01:08:45,293 --> 01:08:47,761
You wouldn't be heading
over them distant hills...

1039
01:08:47,929 --> 01:08:49,863
...and through the blizzard country?

1040
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:52,829
If it's the only way
to the forbidden shore, yeah.

1041
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:54,195
Crikey.

1042
01:08:54,369 --> 01:08:57,861
You might come face to face
with an annihilator.

1043
01:08:58,039 --> 01:08:59,063
An alien annihilator?

1044
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,175
Too right. Cut you up
as soon as look at you.

1045
01:09:02,344 --> 01:09:05,370
Waste every living thing in their path.

1046
01:09:05,547 --> 01:09:07,208
Could they be annihilating the fish?

1047
01:09:07,382 --> 01:09:08,974
Every living thing.

1048
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:11,618
Merciless, mate. Merciless.

1049
01:09:11,786 --> 01:09:14,084
Even if you're a whopping great whale...

1050
01:09:14,255 --> 01:09:16,917
...they drag your sorry carcass ashore...

1051
01:09:17,092 --> 01:09:22,792
...dice you up, melt you down,
and turn you into fun food.

1052
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:25,228
One day you're a big old whale...

1053
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,698
...next minute...

1054
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:29,268
...fun food.

1055
01:09:29,437 --> 01:09:30,870
Someone's gotta stop them.

1056
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:33,530
Oh, yeah? What's gonna be
your approach?

1057
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:35,733
If I could just talk to them.

1058
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:37,400
Appeal to their better nature.

1059
01:09:37,579 --> 01:09:38,568
Beauty.

1060
01:09:38,747 --> 01:09:44,344
When that crafty little trick pays off,
you be sure to let us know, won't you?

1061
01:09:44,519 --> 01:09:47,386
All right, Lovelace, let's go.

1062
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:51,717
See you, Lovelace.

1063
01:09:54,162 --> 01:09:56,596
Your funeral, mate.

1064
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:46,972
Oh, man!

1065
01:10:48,016 --> 01:10:50,746
- Push tight.
- Okay.

1066
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,561
Come on, guys. Let's do it.

1067
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:11,637
You can do it. Come on, push!

1068
01:11:55,884 --> 01:11:57,909
What's that noise?

1069
01:11:59,454 --> 01:12:00,648
There's no noise.

1070
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:03,382
- No gasping. No wheezing.
- Where's Lovelace?

1071
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:10,227
Sometimes a brave penguin
will just slip away to die.

1072
01:12:10,398 --> 01:12:12,332
Do you think he went to a happy place?

1073
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,095
- Probably.
- No, no. I think he went this way.

1074
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:30,640
Come on. Let's go.

1075
01:12:47,235 --> 01:12:49,135
Lovelace!

1076
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:52,796
Lovelace!

1077
01:12:58,846 --> 01:13:00,677
Hello?

1078
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,482
Is there anyone there?

1079
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:07,246
- No-- No need to shout.
- Somebody might hear you.

1080
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,657
His feet don't look too good.

1081
01:13:14,829 --> 01:13:17,423
- He rested here.
- Now he's on his belly!

1082
01:13:17,599 --> 01:13:20,159
- No, this way.
- You don't want to know what he did here.

1083
01:13:20,335 --> 01:13:22,565
- You're right.
- There he is. Lovelace!

1084
01:13:22,737 --> 01:13:26,036
- All right! Lovelace!
- Lovelace!

1085
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,573
- Oh, look at Lovelace.
- We're here.

1086
01:13:30,745 --> 01:13:34,306
- Are you okay?
- Come on, man. Hang in there, buddy.

1087
01:13:35,183 --> 01:13:36,810
What is it?

1088
01:13:36,985 --> 01:13:40,250
Oh, look. There's one for everyone.

1089
01:13:40,421 --> 01:13:42,946
Hang in there, Lovelace.
I know they're here somewhere.

1090
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:45,649
- Why would they leave all this behind?
- I don't know.

1091
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:47,650
Hey.

1092
01:13:47,829 --> 01:13:50,093
- Tell them we come in peace.
- We come in peace!

1093
01:13:50,265 --> 01:13:51,789
- Lovelace.
- Lovelace.

1094
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:53,433
- Lovelace.
- Oh, buddy, come on.

1095
01:13:53,601 --> 01:13:55,660
- Are you okay?
- Hang in there, buddy.

1096
01:13:58,273 --> 01:14:00,741
- Oh, that's not good.
- Stay calm.

1097
01:14:00,908 --> 01:14:02,205
- Stay calm.
- That's not good.

1098
01:14:02,377 --> 01:14:04,971
- Okay, don't stay calm!
- Panic!

1099
01:14:11,686 --> 01:14:13,654
Oh, no, no!

1100
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:18,784
- Oh, they're making us appe-teasers.
- They're appe-teasing us!

1101
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,087
We're all gonna die.

1102
01:14:22,363 --> 01:14:24,228
Whatever you do, stay out of the water!

1103
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:26,526
- Stay out of the water.
- Don't go in the water!

1104
01:14:26,701 --> 01:14:29,397
Lovelace, don't go in the water!

1105
01:14:35,243 --> 01:14:36,767
Lovelace, hang in there!

1106
01:14:36,944 --> 01:14:38,844
Hang in there!

1107
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:43,206
Get your dirty tongue off him!

1108
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,520
No, no, no!

1109
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:49,156
Stay out of the water!

1110
01:14:49,324 --> 01:14:51,019
- Mumble!
- Mumble!

1111
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:25,885
- They playing birdminton?
- No, it's a show. Dinner and a show.

1112
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,090
Lovelace!

1113
01:15:37,605 --> 01:15:39,596
Rejoice!

1114
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:49,209
Lovelace!

1115
01:15:49,384 --> 01:15:51,443
- Help!
- Reach out!

1116
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:53,450
Thank you, my brother, thank you!

1117
01:16:04,432 --> 01:16:06,297
I wasn't scared! I wasn't scared!

1118
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:11,037
Oh, my beautiful brother, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!

1119
01:16:15,209 --> 01:16:18,178
- Go, Lovelace! You the man!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1120
01:16:18,346 --> 01:16:20,814
Enough!

1121
01:16:20,982 --> 01:16:23,075
It's a bad day for you!

1122
01:16:23,251 --> 01:16:25,310
You dealing with Lovelace now!

1123
01:16:25,486 --> 01:16:28,148
- And my man, Mumble, here.
- You tell them, Lovelace.

1124
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:31,086
Begone, demon fish. Adios.

1125
01:16:32,493 --> 01:16:34,120
That's right.

1126
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:36,058
You hightail it back to your mamas.

1127
01:16:36,364 --> 01:16:38,423
- How did he do that?
- Don't make me come in the water.

1128
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,533
I'll come after your sons and daughters.

1129
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:42,692
I'm gonna give you the bad eye.

1130
01:17:36,991 --> 01:17:38,322
A whole bunch of them.

1131
01:17:38,493 --> 01:17:41,121
They gonna rule the world.

1132
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:42,284
It's gotta be them.

1133
01:17:42,463 --> 01:17:45,728
- If it is, I don't wanna know about it.
- They don't even know we exist.

1134
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,231
Let me tell something to you.

1135
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:50,393
This is the end of the road. It's over.

1136
01:17:50,571 --> 01:17:53,472
You did everything penguinly possible.

1137
01:17:53,641 --> 01:17:56,109
- You found the aliens.
- We gonna testify to that.

1138
01:17:56,277 --> 01:17:59,644
We'll tell your whole laughing-boy nation
they were dead wrong about you.

1139
01:17:59,814 --> 01:18:01,611
Now, let's all go back home. Right now.

1140
01:18:01,782 --> 01:18:03,147
Right on.

1141
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:04,909
- Could I ask a favor of you?
- Sure.

1142
01:18:05,086 --> 01:18:07,646
- What kind of favor?
- Could you make sure Gloria's okay?

1143
01:18:07,822 --> 01:18:09,187
- And my ma.
- What?

1144
01:18:09,357 --> 01:18:10,949
And if you see Pa...

1145
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:13,992
...tell him I tried.

1146
01:18:14,161 --> 01:18:15,651
Okay, what you talking about?

1147
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:17,593
I'm gonna stop them taking our fish.

1148
01:18:17,765 --> 01:18:19,323
How you gonna do that, Mumble?

1149
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:24,762
Adios, amigos!

1150
01:18:25,106 --> 01:18:26,596
Amigo! He did it.

1151
01:18:50,164 --> 01:18:51,188
You believe that?

1152
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:54,926
How we gonna tell his mama
he bring us all this way just to kill himself?

1153
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:57,866
No. He didn't. Look.

1154
01:18:58,706 --> 01:19:00,469
He loco maniac.

1155
01:19:00,641 --> 01:19:03,576
First ever flying flipper bird.

1156
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:05,905
How tall you think that tall boy was?

1157
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,243
Who could say? Taller than anyone.

1158
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:13,353
Hey, it's me, Lovelace...

1159
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:15,921
...formerly known as "guru."

1160
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:19,082
I'm gonna be telling your story,
Happy Feet...

1161
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:23,128
...long after you dead and gone!

1162
01:19:40,147 --> 01:19:42,411
Hey! Hey!

1163
01:20:32,566 --> 01:20:35,262
<i>Enraged by their indifference...</i>

1164
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:40,772
<i>...he followed them long after
they were gone from his sight.</i>

1165
01:20:42,943 --> 01:20:47,175
<i>He ventured further
than any of us had gone before...</i>

1166
01:20:47,348 --> 01:20:51,182
<i>...beyond all hope of return.</i>

1167
01:20:52,119 --> 01:20:54,553
<i>Swept up by the great currents...</i>

1168
01:20:54,722 --> 01:20:59,386
<i>...he was carried endlessly
across vast oceans...</i>

1169
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:03,257
<i>...to worlds unknown.</i>

1170
01:21:59,553 --> 01:22:02,317
Excuse me. What is this place?

1171
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:05,482
You're in heaven, Dave. Penguin heaven.

1172
01:22:05,659 --> 01:22:07,650
Is it anywhere near Emperor Land?

1173
01:22:07,828 --> 01:22:10,626
It's wherever you want it to be.

1174
01:22:11,465 --> 01:22:15,492
Try the water, Dave. It's really real.

1175
01:22:31,585 --> 01:22:35,954
<i>I heard tell,
when he finally saw aliens up close...</i>

1176
01:22:36,123 --> 01:22:40,321
<i>...they were just as the skua
had described.</i>

1177
01:22:40,494 --> 01:22:43,122
Excuse me. Why are you taking our fish?

1178
01:22:43,297 --> 01:22:48,599
<i>Big, ugly penguins without feathers
on their fat, flabby faces.</i>

1179
01:22:48,769 --> 01:22:54,503
Why are you taking our fish?
You're kind of killing us out there.

1180
01:22:56,877 --> 01:22:58,970
No! No, wait!

1181
01:23:08,589 --> 01:23:10,557
Oh, my.

1182
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:15,789
Hello. Hello from Emperor Land.
Good afternoon.

1183
01:23:15,963 --> 01:23:17,726
Why are you taking our fish?

1184
01:23:17,898 --> 01:23:22,335
I'm sure you don't mean to,
but you're causing an awful lot of grief.

1185
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:27,330
Am I not making myself clear?
I'm speaking plain penguin.

1186
01:23:28,242 --> 01:23:31,803
Penguin! Don't you understand?
You're stealing our fish.

1187
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:38,813
Oh, please, anyone, talk to me!

1188
01:23:38,986 --> 01:23:41,216
For pity's sake, you're stealing our F-I-S--

1189
01:23:45,993 --> 01:23:50,760
<i>After three days, he would lose his voice.</i>

1190
01:23:50,931 --> 01:23:53,365
<i>After three months...</i>

1191
01:23:55,336 --> 01:23:59,466
<i>...he would all but lose his mind.</i>

1192
01:24:11,886 --> 01:24:14,855
So you found the fish, baby.

1193
01:24:15,956 --> 01:24:17,617
Ma?

1194
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:19,088
- Hi, sweetie.
- Ma.

1195
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:23,663
Fluffy, no matter what they say or do,
we never stopped believing in you.

1196
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:25,924
So you'll be back soon, right?

1197
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,727
Hey, come on. Let him eat.

1198
01:24:27,902 --> 01:24:29,893
Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us.

1199
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:31,871
But there's plenty for everyone.

1200
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:34,337
It's okay, sugar. We can wait.

1201
01:24:34,508 --> 01:24:36,339
No, no, Ma! Ma!

1202
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:39,911
There's lots here. Ma!

1203
01:24:43,851 --> 01:24:45,443
Ma!

1204
01:27:05,659 --> 01:27:08,355
- Kids, you gotta see this.
- He's on now.

1205
01:27:30,117 --> 01:27:32,483
Hey! Hello!

1206
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:37,482
- Isn't that the fellow with the wacky feet?
- Looks like.

1207
01:27:37,658 --> 01:27:39,956
- What was his name?
- I thought he was dead.

1208
01:27:40,127 --> 01:27:41,526
- Everybody--
- Apparently not.

1209
01:27:41,695 --> 01:27:44,630
Everybody, listen up! I've got big news.

1210
01:27:44,965 --> 01:27:46,956
I know who's taking the fish!

1211
01:27:47,134 --> 01:27:49,602
- Yeah, and they took his brain.
- It's the aliens.

1212
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,034
- I made contact with them.
- The lunatic is back.

1213
01:27:52,206 --> 01:27:54,197
The aliens are taking our fish.

1214
01:27:54,374 --> 01:27:56,433
Someone ought to fetch
Noah and the elders.

1215
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:57,907
Hey, you.

1216
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:00,037
Gloria.

1217
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:02,307
Kind of weird, seeing you again.

1218
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,805
Yeah.

1219
01:28:03,984 --> 01:28:06,350
- Everything cool here, baby?
- You remember Seymour.

1220
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,817
Yeah. Hi, Seymour.

1221
01:28:07,988 --> 01:28:09,478
Yeah.

1222
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,520
So which one is yours?

1223
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,022
All of them.

1224
01:28:17,397 --> 01:28:21,527
This is our singing class.
He teaches rhythm. I teach the blues.

1225
01:28:21,702 --> 01:28:24,296
- So you're not--?
- I guess I never heard the right song.

1226
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:27,599
That's great! I didn't mean...

1227
01:28:27,941 --> 01:28:29,533
I found out who's taking the fish.

1228
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,837
They're big and kind of ugly,
but, Gloria...

1229
01:28:32,012 --> 01:28:34,310
...the things they can do.
They're coming here.

1230
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:35,607
Oh, is that so?

1231
01:28:35,782 --> 01:28:38,182
They'll be here soon.
I think they wanna help us.

1232
01:28:38,352 --> 01:28:40,081
So now you speak with them?

1233
01:28:40,254 --> 01:28:43,451
Well, they don't speak penguin,
but they seem to respond to this.

1234
01:28:43,624 --> 01:28:45,683
- What's he doing?
- You gotta be kidding me.

1235
01:28:45,859 --> 01:28:48,885
I suggest we all do it.
It really gets their attention.

1236
01:28:49,062 --> 01:28:50,393
And why would it do that?

1237
01:28:50,564 --> 01:28:53,465
Beats me, but it works.

1238
01:28:53,634 --> 01:28:56,501
- Hey, it's the hippity-hopper.
- Freaky feet!

1239
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:57,659
Boys, boys--

1240
01:28:57,838 --> 01:28:58,827
- Fluffy.
- Tall guy.

1241
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:00,997
- Stretch!
- Amigo!

1242
01:29:04,611 --> 01:29:07,478
So you dare come back?

1243
01:29:07,781 --> 01:29:10,375
He says he's found aliens
and they're taking our fish.

1244
01:29:10,551 --> 01:29:13,076
He says that they're coming
and we all have to do this.

1245
01:29:14,555 --> 01:29:18,082
There be no such thing as aliens!

1246
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:22,924
Mumble, turn around.

1247
01:29:26,066 --> 01:29:27,556
It's a disease.

1248
01:29:27,968 --> 01:29:29,663
Is that from them?

1249
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:34,534
Yeah. But don't be afraid.
I think it's a way to find me, that's all.

1250
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:38,405
You led them here?
You turned them on your own kind?

1251
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:43,115
Wait a second, you just said
there's no such thing as aliens.

1252
01:29:45,552 --> 01:29:47,679
Well, there's not.

1253
01:29:47,854 --> 01:29:51,483
But if there were, only a traitorous fool
would bring them here.

1254
01:29:51,658 --> 01:29:52,750
But they have to come.

1255
01:29:52,926 --> 01:29:55,895
They're the ones taking our fish.
They can do something about it.

1256
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:59,555
None but the Great 'Guin
has the power to give and take away.

1257
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:04,193
The Great 'Guin didn't put things
out of whack, the aliens did.

1258
01:30:04,771 --> 01:30:08,707
A fool returns this day
to mock our suffering.

1259
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:13,005
We are starving
and he wants us to hippity-hop.

1260
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:16,115
So do we hold fast to our ways...

1261
01:30:16,283 --> 01:30:20,982
...or do we bend to the fetid fantasies
of a dancing fool?

1262
01:30:29,796 --> 01:30:32,492
Say, how does that feet thing go again?

1263
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:34,224
Yeah, show us, Mumble.

1264
01:30:35,602 --> 01:30:37,661
Oh, it's really quite easy.

1265
01:30:37,838 --> 01:30:39,465
No, no!

1266
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,971
No, you must resist!

1267
01:30:41,808 --> 01:30:43,503
That's right.

1268
01:30:43,877 --> 01:30:47,244
- Pointless nonsense.
- Resist! Stand your ground!

1269
01:30:47,414 --> 01:30:50,747
Stand your ground against this folly!

1270
01:30:56,523 --> 01:30:59,583
Raise your voices, brothers.

1271
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,059
Cry out in defiance of this jiggity-joggity!

1272
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:05,357
Show me what you got.

1273
01:31:08,168 --> 01:31:09,897
You got it.

1274
01:31:14,441 --> 01:31:15,874
Come on.

1275
01:31:16,043 --> 01:31:17,374
Work, work it.

1276
01:31:17,544 --> 01:31:20,638
Yes, yes! Call on the wisdoms!

1277
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:22,543
Let the world tremble!

1278
01:31:22,983 --> 01:31:24,848
For when all others leave...

1279
01:31:25,018 --> 01:31:26,883
...we remain!

1280
01:31:28,622 --> 01:31:30,249
Mumble! Mumble!

1281
01:31:30,424 --> 01:31:33,222
Mama? Amigos.

1282
01:31:34,594 --> 01:31:37,427
- Oh, Mama.
- Oh, my boy.

1283
01:31:37,597 --> 01:31:40,191
- My gorgeous boy.
- Oh, Mama.

1284
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:42,494
- Look at him.
- You're so dazzling.

1285
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:45,536
- Oh, Fluffy.
- We waited and waited for you.

1286
01:31:45,706 --> 01:31:48,539
- Oh, yeah.
- Where's Pa?

1287
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:50,973
Believe me. You don't wanna see
your deadbeat dad.

1288
01:31:51,144 --> 01:31:53,203
- Your pa is sort of...
- What?

1289
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,678
Come on, I'll show you.

1290
01:32:05,058 --> 01:32:06,855
Memphis?

1291
01:32:07,894 --> 01:32:09,327
Memphis?

1292
01:32:09,496 --> 01:32:10,986
Pa?

1293
01:32:14,901 --> 01:32:16,528
Mumble?

1294
01:32:16,703 --> 01:32:18,694
Is it truly you?

1295
01:32:18,872 --> 01:32:21,204
Every last bit of me, Pa.

1296
01:32:25,379 --> 01:32:27,210
I thought...

1297
01:32:31,351 --> 01:32:32,841
Pa?

1298
01:32:36,456 --> 01:32:38,856
There ain't been one day...

1299
01:32:40,827 --> 01:32:45,457
...not one day, that I done right by you.

1300
01:32:49,803 --> 01:32:51,828
Oh, Pa.

1301
01:32:52,005 --> 01:32:53,870
Dance for him, Daddy.

1302
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,031
Dance with your boy.

1303
01:32:59,379 --> 01:33:01,779
You'll have to forgive me.

1304
01:33:02,582 --> 01:33:05,642
The music's gone clean out of me.

1305
01:33:07,521 --> 01:33:09,113
No, it hasn't.

1306
01:33:09,289 --> 01:33:13,089
It's just like singing with your body.

1307
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,285
Come on, baby. We can do it.

1308
01:33:15,462 --> 01:33:17,020
Oh, Mama.

1309
01:33:17,197 --> 01:33:21,566
It's just one big old foot after the other.

1310
01:33:26,973 --> 01:33:27,962
That's it.

1311
01:33:29,976 --> 01:33:31,807
Yeah.

1312
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:36,013
- Yeah, see?
- Well, that feels good.

1313
01:33:41,254 --> 01:33:44,690
<i>You don't have to be beautiful</i>

1314
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:46,114
Yeah, Memphis.

1315
01:33:46,359 --> 01:33:47,986
<i>To turn me on</i>

1316
01:33:48,462 --> 01:33:49,451
Daddy.

1317
01:33:49,629 --> 01:33:53,656
<i>I just need your body, baby</i>

1318
01:33:53,834 --> 01:33:56,325
<i>From dusk till dawn</i>

1319
01:33:57,537 --> 01:34:01,268
<i>You don't have to be rich to be my girl</i>

1320
01:34:01,441 --> 01:34:05,434
<i>You don't have to be cool
To rule my world</i>

1321
01:34:05,612 --> 01:34:09,514
<i>Ain't no particular song
I'm more compatible with</i>

1322
01:34:09,683 --> 01:34:14,347
<i>I just want your extra time and your...</i>

1323
01:34:34,674 --> 01:34:37,700
Holy flock!

1324
01:35:03,103 --> 01:35:05,537
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

1325
01:35:42,208 --> 01:35:44,574
I think you better dance now.

1326
01:36:38,131 --> 01:36:40,599
First, there was just one.
Now there's thousands.

1327
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:43,463
- Are they trying to tell us something?
- What's the problem?

1328
01:36:43,637 --> 01:36:46,435
- We're messing with their food chain.
- We've gotta do something.

1329
01:36:46,606 --> 01:36:50,303
- We suggest a ban on all marine harvesting.
- Too much money. Too many jobs.

1330
01:36:52,212 --> 01:36:54,373
Why should we do anything at all?

1331
01:37:00,086 --> 01:37:03,453
They're just a bunch of flightless birds
at the bottom of the world.

1332
01:37:07,961 --> 01:37:10,293
I don't wanna live in a world
without penguins.

1333
01:37:10,463 --> 01:37:11,828
What are we gonna do about it?

1334
01:37:11,998 --> 01:37:13,659
Bang up the sign "No Fishing."

1335
01:37:15,435 --> 01:37:18,836
Is equal to the love...

1336
01:37:19,005 --> 01:37:20,404
...you make.

1337
01:37:24,477 --> 01:37:28,641
<i>Oh, baby. Right on.</i>

1338
01:37:41,161 --> 01:37:46,292
<i>Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy-headed boy</i>

1339
01:37:49,135 --> 01:37:50,602
<i>It's like a jungle sometimes</i>

1340
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:52,965
<i>It makes me wonder
How I keep from going under</i>

1341
01:37:54,908 --> 01:37:56,375
Bring it on! Go ahead!

1342
01:37:57,243 --> 01:38:01,236
<i>Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing</i>

1343
01:38:01,414 --> 01:38:05,282
<i>We were happy with
The joy the day would bring</i>

1344
01:38:05,452 --> 01:38:08,615
<i>I wish those days
Would come back once more</i>

1345
01:38:08,788 --> 01:38:12,986
<i>Come back those days, those days
Come back, don't go</i>

1346
01:38:13,393 --> 01:38:16,055
Come here, babe. Come on back.

1347
01:38:16,229 --> 01:38:17,218
<i>Come on back</i>

1348
01:38:17,397 --> 01:38:19,024
<i>- Come on back
- Come on back</i>

1349
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,690
<i>- Come on back
- Come on back</i>

1350
01:38:21,868 --> 01:38:24,063
<i>I love them, I love them</i>

1351
01:38:24,237 --> 01:38:25,397
<i>I love them, I love them</i>

1352
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:33,338
<i>Those days, those days
Those days, those days</i>

1353
01:38:33,513 --> 01:38:39,008
<i>Those days</i>
