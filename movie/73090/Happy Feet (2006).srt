135
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,830
The beak.
痛死了……

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,730
Okay, good boy.
好了，乖孩子

137
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,910
So late. What's keeping them?
这么晚了，她们遇到什么事了？

138
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,880
Pray, brothers, the Great 'Guin
does not test us with a lean season.
祷告吧，兄弟们
伟大的企鹅歌神不会用饥饿来考验我们

139
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,650
Why, Noah? Have we not all been dutiful?
为什么，诺亚？难道我们还不够恭顺吗？

140
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,050
So when you see your mama...
看到妈妈的时候……

141
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,350
- I stand perfectly still.
- You got it.
- 我要站得笔直
- 说对了

142
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,260
But how will I know
which one's my mama?
但我怎么知道哪个是妈妈？

143
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,520
Oh, you'll know.
哦，你会知道的

144
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,490
She's got a wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk.
她走路时婀娜多姿,说话轻柔悦耳

145
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,300
And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.
唱起歌来…让你如痴如醉

146
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,800
Hey, wait. I see them. I see them!
嘿，等等，我看到她们了，看到了！

147
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,210
You're right! You're right!
没错，是她们！

148
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,610
Wives, ho!
老婆们，噢！

149
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,670
Wives, ho!
老婆们，噢！

150
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,750
Wives, ho!
老婆们，噢！

151
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,650
Wait, no. Wait, no, Mumble, get back here.
No, Mumble! Get back... Mumble!
等等，不，曼波，回来
别……曼波，回来……曼波！

152
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,090
Mumble! Mumble!
曼波，曼波！

153
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,990
Mumble!
曼波！

154
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,620
Michelle? Michelle?
蜜雪儿，蜜雪儿？

155
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,230
- Roxanne?
- Michelle?
- 罗珊尼？
- 蜜雪儿？

156
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,170
Alfie?
阿尔菲？

157
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,500
- Maurice!
- Michelle! Michelle!
- 莫里斯！
- 蜜雪儿，蜜雪儿！

158
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,840
Mommy!
妈妈！

159
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,600
Oh, she's so darling.
噢，她太讨人喜欢了

160
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,450
Excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me.
Mumble? Mumble?
借过，借过，打扰了
曼波，曼波？

161
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,640
Oh, Mumble.
曼波

162
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,150
- Mama?
- Mumble!
- 妈妈？
- 曼波！

163
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,480
- Mama?
- Mumble!
- 妈妈？
- 曼波！

164
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,020
Mumble!
曼波！

165
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,460
Mama? Mama?
妈妈，妈妈？

166
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,690
- Mumble, boy, where are you?
- Mama!
- 曼波，孩子，你在哪儿？
- 妈妈！

167
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,400
Memphis?
孟菲斯？

168
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,470
Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama.
噢，孩子他妈
噢，孩子他妈

169
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,340
- Oh, my.
- Daddy.
- 噢，上帝
- 孩子他爸

170
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,480
So where's the baby?
我们的孩子在哪儿呢？

171
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,950
Well, honey, I'll find him.
亲爱的，我会找到他的

172
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,210
- You lost the baby? Memphis!
- It's okay.
- 你把宝宝丢了？孟菲斯！
- 没事的

173
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,250
- Mama? Mama?
- Stay!
- 妈妈，妈妈？
- 待在那里！

174
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,320
- Come to Mommy.
- No, Mumble.
- 来妈妈这儿
- 不，曼波

175
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,590
Mama, Mama.
妈妈，妈妈

176
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,960
Hey, what's wrong with his feet?
嘿，他的脚怎么了？

177
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,860
Oh, that's just a little thing he's got going.
He'll grow out of it.
哦，一点小毛病，长大就好了

178
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,930
Mama!
妈妈！

179
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,730
Oh, Memphis, he's gorgeous.
噢，孟菲斯，他好可爱哦

180
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,600
- Isn't he, though?
- Look at you.
- 可不是吗？
- 看看你

181
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,770
I got something for you.
我有东西要送你哦

182
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,670
Open up.
嘴张开

183
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,880
Oh, I love the way she does that.
哦，我最爱看你喂食的样子了

184
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,320
W, X, Y and Z
W，X，Y和Z

185
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,690
Good morning, class.
早上好，同学们

186
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,230
Good morning, Miss Viola.
早上好，薇拉老师

187
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,390
Right.
好的

188
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,960
Well, today we begin with the most
important lesson you will ever learn...
那么，今天我们要上企鹅小学里

189
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,430
...at Penguin Elementary.
最重要的一堂课

190
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,260
Does anyone know what that is?
有谁知道是什么吗？

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,700
Anyone? Anyone?
谁知道？谁知道？

192
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,860
Someone? Seymour?
谁？西摩？

193
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,940
- Fishing?
- No.
- 捕鱼吗？
- 不是

194
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,470
Mumble?
曼波？

195
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,240
Don't eat yellow snow?
不要吃黄色的雪？

196
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,810
No, that's not it, no.
不，不是的

197
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,140
- It's our Heartsong, Miss.
- Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes.
- 唱我们的心曲，老师
- 谢谢你，葛露亚，好极了，没错

198
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,180
Without our Heartsong,
we can't be truly penguin, can we?
不会唱歌，就不是真正的企鹅
大家说对不对？

199
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,150
No.
对

200
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,690
But, my dears, it's not something
that I can actually teach you.
但是，亲爱的孩子们
事实上这不是我可以教会你们的

201
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,260
Does anybody know why?
Anyone? Anyone?
有人知道为什么吗？
谁知道，谁知道？

202
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,090
You can't teach it to us, ma'am...
你之所以不能教给我们

203
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,890
...because we have to find
our Heartsongs all by ourselves.
是因为我们要靠自己找到心曲

204
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,060
Well done, you.
说得好

205
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,900
It's the voice you hear inside...
这是你在内心深处所听到的……

206
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,660
...who you truly are.
……真正的自我

207
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,360
Yes. Thank you, Gloria.
Excellent, lovely, thank you.
对，谢谢你，葛露亚
好极了，谢谢你

208
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,910
So let's all be very still now.
那现在让我们安静一下

209
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,340
Take a moment and let it come to you.
等一会儿，你就会感受得到

210
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,610
- I got one!
- Pick me!
- 我听到了！
- 我来

211
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,720
- Pick me! Pick me!
- One at a time. Yes, Seymour.
- 挑我、挑我…
- 一次一个，西摩，你先来

212
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,010
Don't push me
'Cause I am close to the edge
# 不要逼我，因为我就快要崩溃

213
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,120
I'm trying not to lose my head
# 我不想要失去我的理智,我不想让毛掉光

214
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,260
Yes, I like that one. I could
really get jiggy with that. Lovely.
好棒哦，听得我好想跳舞

215
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,020
I'm ready. I got one.
我想到一首歌了

216
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,760
Oh, I thought you might, Gloria.
噢，我想也是，葛露亚

217
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,630
Midnight creeps so slowly
# 黑夜缓缓进逼

218
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,240
Into hearts of those
# 逼向需求无度

219
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,000
Who need more than they get
# 永不满足的人

220
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,080
Daylight deals a bad hand
# 白画的赌局

221
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,270
To a penguin
# 下注太高的企鹅

222
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,450
# 下注太高的企鹅

223
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,277
Who has laid too many bets
# 下注太高的企鹅

224
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:29,454
Who has laid too many bets

225
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:31,882
# 一手烂牌
Who has laid too many bets

226
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:34,880
Who has laid too many bets

227
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,850
That's as far as I got so far.
我只想到这四句而已

228
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,620
- Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely.
- That's beautiful.
- 噢，很好听，唱得真好
- 棒极了

229
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,060
Well, Mumble, since
you seem so keen to share.
曼波，看起来你等不及想和大家分享了

230
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,800
Mine's sort of a boom and a:
我想唱的是“砰”的一声，然后……

231
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,800
And another boom.
又是“砰”的一声

232
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,100
You heard that in there?
这就是你在心里听到的？

233
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,540
- Do you like it?
- I'm afraid that's not a tune.
- 你喜欢吗？
- 哦！这不成旋律

234
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:55,943
- 你喜欢吗？
- 哦！这不成旋律

235
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,970
- It's not?
- No, dear. A tune is like:
- 不算？
- 是的，亲爱的，旋律应该是这样的

236
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,440
Oh, okay.
哦，好的

237
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,490
Who is that?
那是谁？

238
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,490
That is the offspring of Memphis
and Norma Jean.
他是孟菲斯和诺玛·珍的孩子

239
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,220
The wee hippity-hopper.
一只小袋鼠
（小袋鼠：四五十年代的一个卡通角色）

240
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,630
It's not funny!
这不好笑！

241
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,830
No. No, not in the least.
对，对，一点也不好笑

242
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,470
A penguin without a Heartsong
is hardly a penguin at all.
没有心曲的企鹅根本不算企鹅

243
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,080
I think he broke my ear.
我的耳朵被你震聋了啦

244
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,940
In all my years, I've never, I mean...
这么多年了，我从来没，我是说……

245
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,710
And you having such fine voices.
Well, it's bizarre.
你们的歌声那么美，这就怪了

246
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,410
Did anything happen, you know,
during early development?
孵蛋期间有没有发生什么事？

247
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,030
No, all fine. Normal incubation.
没有，很好啊，一切都很正常

248
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,520
- Right.
- Wasrt it, honey?
- 好
- 是吧，亲爱的？

249
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,290
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter,
I guess.
对，对，除了今年冬天特别冷

250
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,450
Right, right.
没错，没错

251
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,100
- He did hatch a little late...
- Yes, I understand. Yes.
- 不过他的确比较晚才孵出来……
- 嗯，我理解

252
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,330
- To think he might spend his life alone...
- Quite, quite.
- 一想到他会孤独一生……
- 小声点，小声点

253
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,670
...never to meet his one true love.
……永远都不会遇到真爱

254
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,040
Oh, please, Miss Viola,
isn't there something we can do?
噢，拜托，薇拉老师，他还有救吗？

255
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,670
Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan.
嗯，去找天后艾丝卓就没错了

256
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,840
Mrs. Astrakhan?
天后艾丝卓？

257
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,780
If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can.
只要是能办到的事
天后艾丝卓都能办到

258
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,390
Can't sing?
不会唱歌？

259
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,527
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.
不会唱歌？

260
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:18,763
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.

261
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:19,827
真失败，亲爱的
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.

262
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,620
Every little penguin has a song.
每只小企鹅都会唱歌

263
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,420
When I have finished...
上完我的课

264
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,260
...your singing will be giving everyone
the goose pimple.
……你的歌声会让每个人起鸡皮疙瘩

265
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,340
Now, to begin.
First, we must find a feeling.
好，现在开始
首先，我们必须找到一种感觉

266
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,630
Happy feeling, sad feeling.
开心的感觉，伤心的感觉

267
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,140
Maybe lonely feeling.
也或许是孤独的感觉

268
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,510
You feel it?
你感觉到了吗？

269
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,710
Good. Now, let it out.
好的，现在唱出来吧

270
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,580
Be spontaneous.
顺其自然

271
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,820
That, what is that?
你在做什么？

272
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,190
I'm being spontan-you-us.
顺其自然呀

273
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,460
Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl?
亲爱的，你想认识小美眉吗？

274
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,000
You want to make the egg?
你想要蛋宝宝吗？

275
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,260
Oh, yes.
哦，想啊

276
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,445
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog.
Do not move muscle.
那就唱！

277
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:04,645
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog.
Do not move muscle.

278
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:07,845
脚不要乱动，一根筋都别动
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog.
Do not move muscle.

279
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,140
No moving!
不准动！

280
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,350
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
一闪，一闪，亮晶晶

281
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,110
Enough!
够了！

282
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,480
Okay. We go back to the top.
好，我们再从头开始

283
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,580
Forget body. Look inside soul.
身体别动，探索你的心灵

284
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,460
Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling.
感受那种感情，强烈的感情

285
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,000
So enormous it fills whole body.
它是如此强烈，充满了你的身体

286
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,430
It must escape or you explode.
它必须被释放出来，否则你就会爆炸

287
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,440
- Now, open your little beak.
- Come on.
- 现在，张开你的小嘴
- 快啊

288
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,730
Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it.
对，对，抬起头来，就这样

289
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,210
Now... Now...
现在，现在……

290
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,080
Now
就现在！

291
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,340
Disaster! Catastrophe!
太可怕了，太恐怖了

292
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,780
I never fail before.
我从来没有失败过

293
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,080
Never! Never!
从来没有，从来没有！

294
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,130
- Well, I thought it was kind of cute.
- But it just ain't penguin, okay?
- 我觉得他满可爱的啊
- 可是一点都不像企鹅，知道吗？

295
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,560
So what if he's a little different?
I always kind of liked different.
那他要是就是有点不一样呢？
我一直就喜欢有点与众不同

296
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,400
He's not different.
He's a regular emperor penguin.
他跟别人没什么不一样的
他是一只普通的帝企鹅

297
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,600
Hey, you know what? I can leave school.
嘿，知道吗？我可以不去上学

298
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,970
I can go to work. The three of us.
我可以去干活，我们一家三口一起

299
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,980
Whoa, little fella. You ain't going nowhere
till you got yourself an education.
哦，小朋友
在你接受完教育之前哪里也不要去

300
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,080
You get them singing muscles
big and strong, you got that?
你要学会唱的有力而响亮，知道吗？

301
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,380
I'll try, Pa.
我会努力的，爸爸

302
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,040
You bet you will. The word "triumph"
starts with "try," and it ends with...
你最好如此
成功的第一个字是成，第二个字是……

303
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,880
- "Umph."
- That's right. A great big "umph."
- “功”
- 没错，大大的“功”字

304
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,220
I'm going fishing.
我要去捕鱼了

305
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,360
Oh, Mumble.
噢，曼波

306
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,540
That first hard summer...
那是第一个艰难的夏天

307
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,730
...while his mom and dad
were working overtime...
当他的爸爸妈妈在家和大海之间来回奔波……

308
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,810
...on the great commute to the sea...
……加班加点工作时……

309
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,320
...Mumble found a place
away from disapproving eyes...
……曼波找到了一个可以远离菲薄……

310
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,950
...where a funky little fella
could be himself.
……尽情展现自我的地方

311
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:03,103
回想过去，我还是个小毛头

312
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:10,940
卯足劲去装可怜

313
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:15,681
以为那样她就不会打我屁屁

314
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:19,878
我好希望，可以回到过去

315
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:24,458
为什么过去，一去不复返

316
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,595
我好喜欢过去

317
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,050
Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird?
嘿，你在那儿干嘛呢，小小鸟？

318
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,450
Nothing. What are you doing?
没事，你们在干嘛呢？

319
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,450
Nothing. Just dropped in
for a little lunch.
没事，路过吃点午饭而已

320
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,350
There's food? Here?
有吃的？这里？

321
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,450
Leg or wing?
腿还是翅膀？

322
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,060
Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I'm a penguin.
不不不，等等，不会是我吧，我是企鹅啊

323
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,230
Exactly. The flipper birds,
that's you, eat the fish.
一点没错，小小鸟

324
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,333
Exactly. The flipper birds,
that's you, eat the fish.

325
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,930
就是你，吃鱼的家伙
Exactly. The flipper birds,
that's you, eat the fish.

326
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,630
The flying birds, that's me,
eat the flipper bird and the fish.
飞天大雕，也就是我

327
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,703
The flying birds, that's me,
eat the flipper bird and the fish.

328
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,630
吃的是小小鸟和鱼
The flying birds, that's me,
eat the flipper bird and the fish.

329
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,030
And lately, there ain't a lot of fish.
但最近，海里没什么鱼…

330
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,300
- So...
- This time I'm getting the juicy bits.
- 所以……
- 这次我要吃有汁的那块

331
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,870
- Me first!
- Hey, you want a piece of me?
- 我先来！
- 嘿，你要和我抢？

332
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,700
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm trying to think about lunch.
嘿嘿嘿，我在考虑午饭的事情

333
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,081
Wait! Watch this!
等等

334
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:06,384
Wait! Watch this!

335
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,081
看看这个！
Wait! Watch this!

336
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,356
Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen.
For once, we're gonna do this civilized.
嗯，真是个怪胎，好吧，你听着

337
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:18,450
Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen.
For once, we're gonna do this civilized.
我就破一次例，文明地解决这件事

338
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,525
- Now, get in line...
- Hey! What's that on your leg?
排好队…

339
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:19,631
- Now, get in line...
- Hey! What's that on your leg?

340
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:21,220
嘿！你腿上是什么东东？
- Now, get in line...
- Hey! What's that on your leg?

341
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,325
嘿！你腿上是什么东东？

342
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,128
- What? This little thing?
- Oh, no. Don't start him on that.
什么？这小玩意？

343
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:23,400
- What? This little thing?
- Oh, no. Don't start him on that.

344
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,528
拜托，千万不要问他
- What? This little thing?
- Oh, no. Don't start him on that.

345
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,830
Shut up! The little flipper bird
asked me a perceptive question.
闭嘴！这只小小鸟问了我一个很敏感的问题

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,103
- A question like that deserves an answer.
- Here we go.
一个必须给出答案的问题

347
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:30,700
- A question like that deserves an answer.
- Here we go.
又来了

348
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,530
I got two words for you:
我送你两个词：

349
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,770
"Alien abduction."
外星怪客

350
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,640
- Oh, you had to ask.
- Have mercy.
- 你干嘛问啦？
- 有点同情心

351
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,680
Quiet!
闭嘴！

352
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,250
Now, little buddy,
there is something out there.
小朋友，这世上有一种东西

353
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,510
Creatures. Not like us.
一种生物，跟我们不一样的生物

354
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,920
Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too.
更大，更凶猛，当然也更聪明

355
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,580
- Ask me how I know.
- How?
- 问我是怎么知道的
- 你怎么知道？

356
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,920
Because I've been captured by them,
that's how.
因为我被他们捉到过，这就是原因

357
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,120
Unbelievable.
难以置信

358
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,260
What do you mean "unbelievable?"
It's true.
“难以置信”什么意思？
这就是事实

359
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,660
I'm sitting on a rock,
minding my own business...
当时我正在岩石上闲着没事干

360
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,420
...when suddenly, they're onto me.
……突然间，他们攻击我

361
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,730
These beings, like big ugly penguins.
他们就像又大又丑的企鹅

362
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,030
Fat, flabby faces with front-ways eyes...
肥肥多肉的脸，眼睛挤在一起

363
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,610
...no feathers, no beaks,
and these... These appendages.
没羽毛、没尖嘴
还有…四只脚

364
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,470
They probe me. They tie me up.
They strap me down.
他们戳我、绑我、把我摆平

365
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,510
They take this pointy thing
and they stick it into me.
然后拿出一个尖尖的东西插进我身体

366
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,240
And then, blackout.
再然后，我就晕了过去

367
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,820
Gosh.
天呐

368
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,920
I woke up and there's this...
This thing on me.
我醒来之后
就在腿上发现了这个……这个东西

369
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,325
Every flying bird is dissing me,
"Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"
每只会飞的鸟都鄙视我，说

370
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:23,453
Every flying bird is dissing me,
"Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"

371
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:25,325
“嘿，发生什么了，小黄脚？”
Every flying bird is dissing me,
"Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"

372
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,480
It was humiliating.
真是对我的羞辱

373
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,820
And then what?
然后呢？

374
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,020
It was humiliating.
What more do you want?
它们羞辱我，还不够么？

375
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,160
They could have eated you.
它们本来可以吃了你的

376
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,300
Yeah. Yeah.
是啊，是啊

377
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,700
I guess my pitiful cries for mercy
appealed to their better nature.
我猜可能是我可怜的哀号
唤醒了他们内心善良的本性吧

378
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,040
Can I appeal to your better nature?
那我能唤醒你更善良的本性吗？

379
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,715
Nice try, kid, but no.
想得很好，孩子，但..

380
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:47,818
Nice try, kid, but no.

381
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:49,015
不可能
Nice try, kid, but no.

382
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,120
No. No. No!
不，不，不！

383
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,120
What you doing down there, flipper bird?
你在下面干嘛，小小鸟？

384
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,280
Get up here.
上来啊

385
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,080
Get back up here this minute.
马上给我上来

386
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,420
Oh, great. You let him get away.
Didrt you?
噢，好极了，是你放他走的，没错吧？

387
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,890
All your screwy alien talk.
都是因为你，说什么外星怪客

388
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,330
- Hey, I'm an abductee.
- Abduct this.
- 嘿，我可被绑架过耶
- 绑架个头

389
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,130
- Don't make me call Uncle Angie.
- Oh, fine.
- 别逼我找安吉叔叔哦
- 噢，随便

390
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,390
Where youse going? I'm an abductee!
你们去哪?我被绑架过耶！

391
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,136
- I don't care what you are, I'm hungry!
- Would you like to hear our specials?
我才不管你怎么了呢，我饿了！

392
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:11,575
- I don't care what you are, I'm hungry!
- Would you like to hear our specials?

393
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:13,136
想知道今天的特餐是什么吗？
- I don't care what you are, I'm hungry!
- Would you like to hear our specials?

394
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,700
How about fish? There's no fish.
How about penguin? There's no penguin.
吃鱼怎么样？我们没有鱼

Now it's dark and I'm...

But first you got to catch up.

哦，他真来了
我们最好在半小时内离开

535
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:35,500
Let's get out of here.
快……点……闪……人

536
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,000

Way to go! It's amazing!

Oh, he's leaving.
Oh, no, that was his face!
哦，他要逃了，看他的衰脸

545

Remember, dumplings,
I know where you live.

551
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,190
Did it take you a while
to come up with that one?
这句话得费点脑筋才想得出来吧？

552
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,020
All right, way to go, tall guy.

Give me fin, give me fin.

565
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,070
Mambo!
曼博！
（曼博舞：一种源于拉丁美洲的舞蹈，类似于伦巴舞）

00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,450
Everybody's so... spontan-you-us.

But he had a rock in his mouth.

- 嘿，嘿，嘿

Oh, don't be so snooty, booty.

You guys are soft in the head, okay?

Let's go.

- 这叫欲擒故纵，懂吗？
- 等她们回来求我们

You think I could get some of it?
我也能那么迷人吗？

Let me tell something to you.

you got the most charisma of anybody.
除了我，你的魅力无人能比

you're gonna hurt someone.
别闹了，雷蒙，很伤人耶

625
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,570
- It was too close.
- Come on, come on.
- 太疯狂了，我不玩了

626
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,240
Hey, guys! Where are we going?
嘿，伙计们，我们去哪儿啊？

- 去别的地方
- 也就是要换个住处

628
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,680
- But that thing, what was it?
- How should we know?
- 那是什么玩意？

但那是哪里来的？
真奇怪啊，像是外星怪客

- 他在说啥？
- 不知道，什么怪脚

632
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,590
I don't know a guy Elian.
I knew a guy named Estevan...
我不认识怪脚，我认识肉脚…

So? What are we
supposed to do about it?
然后呢？我们该怎么办呢？

636
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,900
Amigos, we gotta get
to the bottom of this thing.
我们一定要查个水落石出

649

够了，有没有戳我…关你屁事呀

You don't have enough pebbles, fool.
你问题太多了，贡品不够，傻子！

any of my questions.
但你一个问题都还没回答呢

The voices are shrieking in my head.

baby, please.

别碰护身符好吗，宝贝们

There's not enough love in the world.

Turn to the penguin next to you.

Put your flippers up.
Fluff him up a little bit.

No. We sing to each other.

- 嘿，大家伙

That's the problem. I can't.

00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,470
Find me, find me
# 找个人来…

753
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,680
What's he doing?
他在干嘛？

754
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:31,580
- I think he's singing.
- I know singing, that's not singing.
- 好像在唱歌
- 我听过歌，那不是唱歌

755

I heard an animal once do that,
but then they rolled him over, he was dead.
我听过有动物像这样惨叫

756
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:35,724

他叫完就挂掉了
I heard an animal once do that,
but then they rolled him over, he was dead.

it darn near breaks your heart.

You in tragic shape, man.
你真是太惨了

真的吗？天，要是我能唱歌
这一切就都能改变了

exactly what I say.
你会唱歌，只要照我的话去做

768
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,080
- Okay.
- Did I say "okay"?
- 好
- 我有说好吗？

769
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,740
- No.

- 照你的话去做

Gloria
葛露亚

774
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,070
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder
# 仿佛在丛林中

00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,250
Do you not understand that we can
only survive here when we're in harmony?
我们只有和谐共处才能生存下去

917
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,650
When you and your foreign friends
lead us into your easy ways...
当你和你的外地朋友在这里胡闹时

918
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,450
...you offend the Great 'Guin.
……你们已经冒犯伟大的企鹅歌神了

919
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,560
You invite him to withhold his bounty.
逼他收回送我们的恩赐

920
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:08,320
- He rules the seasons.
- He giveth and he can taketh away.
- 他掌管着季节
- 他能给予，就能收回

921
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,990
Wait a minute.
Happy feet can't cause a famine.
慢着，快乐的大脚不会造成饥荒

922
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:14,760
If thy kind of pagan display
did not cause it, then what did?
不是你们造成的，会是什么？

923
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,240
I think it comes from outside.
Way beyond the ice.
有外力因素，在冰原之外

924
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:19,740
There are things out there,
things we don't understand.
那里有一种我们不了解的生物

925
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,570
- Mysteries.
- Mind-boggling mysteries.
- 那是个谜
- 天大的谜团

926
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,150
- Mystic beings.
- Yeah, aliens.
- 神秘生物
- 对，外星怪客

927
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,940
- He's mad.
- No, aliens.
- 他疯了
- 不，是外星怪客

928
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,780
- I hear they're smart.
- He's insane.
- 我听说他们很聪明
- 他疯了！

929
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,580
No, they might be smarter than all of us.
Who knows?
不，他们可能比我们都聪明

930
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,150
He drove the fish away,
now he's ranting this rubbish!
他把鱼赶走，现在又在鬼扯淡

931
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,590
- Hey, let me tell something to you.
- Don't touch me, you filthy vermin.
- 我告诉你一件事
- 不要碰我，短腿企鹅

932
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,590
- Hey, watch it.
- And so it follows.
- 小心！
- 这是恶性循环

933
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,250
Dissent leads to division
and division leads us to doom.
纷争造成分裂，分裂带来灭亡

934
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:44,490
- You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go.
- Hear, hear.
- 你，快乐大脚，曼波，必须离开
- 对、对

935
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,100
Don't you take one step, sweetheart.
一步都不准走，儿子

936
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:50,760
You have as much right to be here
as any of these daffy old fools.
你和那些老古板一样有权留下来

937
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,200
Norma Jean, I'll deal with this.
诺玛·珍，这事我来处理

938
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,850
Pa?
爸？

939
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,213
Mumble, you must renounce
your so-called friends...
曼波

940
00:57:59,213 --> 00:57:59,721
Mumble, you must renounce
your so-called friends...

941
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:01,213
你必须和这些所谓的朋友断绝关系……
Mumble, you must renounce
your so-called friends...

942
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,410
...your peculiar thoughts,
your strange ways.
并放弃你那些奇怪的想法和诡异的行为

943
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:04,950
- Memphis.
- Lf we are devout...
- 孟菲斯
- 如果你虔诚…

944
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,250
...sincere in our praise,
the fish will return.
……虔诚祈祷就能解决鱼荒

945
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:10,690
- But, Pa...
- Listen, boy, I was a backslider myself.
- 但是，爸……
- 听好，我也曾违反传统

946
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,130
I was careless
and now we're paying the price.
我太粗心，现在报应来了

947
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,890
What's this got to do with Mumble?
这和曼波有什么关系？

948
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:18,000
- It's why he is the way he is.
- There's nothing wrong with him!
- 我害他变成这样
- 他没有问题

949
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,230
- Face it, our sors all messed up.
- He's not messed up, hear me?
- 承认吧，咱们的儿子有问题
- 他没问题，听见吗？

950
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,370
- Believe me, I know.
- How can you say that?
- 相信我，我很清楚
- 你怎么能这么说？

951
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,640
Because when he was just an egg,
I dropped him!
因为他还是蛋的时候我把他弄掉了！

952
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:28,570
Memphis.
孟菲斯

953
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,970
Mumble.
曼波

954
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,850
Oh, my poor little Mumble.
哦，我可怜的小曼波

955
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,680
But, Mom, I'm perfectly fine.
但是，妈妈，可是我很正常啊

956
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,850
- No. No, you're not, boy.
- That's right.
- 不不，你不正常，孩子
- 就是说嘛

957
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:44,590
For all our sakes, you must stop
this freakiness with the feet.
为了大家好，别再乱跳舞了

958
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,890
Your father speaks wisely.
Heed his suffering heart and repent.
你父亲非常明智
他痛苦的心灵就靠你来抚平

959
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,260
But it just doesn't make any sense.
这一点都没有道理

960
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,500
Then your arrogance leaves us no choice!
你傲慢的态度逼我们别无选择

961
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,660
No, wait.
不，等等

962
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,940
Please, son, you can do this.
It ain't so hard.
孩子，你做得到，这并不难

963
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,540
Don't ask me to change, Pa,
because I can't.
别逼我改变，爸，我做不到

964
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,780
And that, my brethren, is the end of it.
同胞们，那就这样吧

965
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,850
You, begone!
你，赶快滚！

966
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,090
- Mumble.
- No, Ma, it's okay. It's okay.
- 曼波
- 没事的，妈，不要紧

967
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,990
Let me tell something to you.
让我告诉你

968
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,290
When I find out
what's happening to the fish...
等我查明鱼荒的原因…

969
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,960
...I 'll be back.
……我会回来的

970
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,430
Let me through? Let me through.
让我过去，借过一下

971
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,690
- Mumble, you don't have to go.
- Let it be.
- 波波，你不必走
- 让他去吧

972
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:38,340
- Gloria.
- No. No, Dad, this isn't fair.
- 葛露亚
- 不，不，爸爸，这太不公平了

973
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,740
Gloria, listen to your father.
葛露亚，听你爸爸的话

974
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:46,810
My folks were always putting him down
# 我的爸妈老是看不起他

975
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,850
Down, down, down
# 看不起他…

976
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:54,280
They said he came
From the wrong side of town
# 他们说他自来下流社会

977
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,950
He came from the wrong side of town
# 说他来自下流社会

978
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,220
They told me he was bad
# 他们说他很坏

979
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,490
So bad
# 很坏

980
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:06,600
- But I know he was sad
- So sad
- # 但是我懂他的悲
- # 他的悲

981
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:11,930
I'll never forget him
The leader of the pack
# 我永远忘不了那个带头老大

982
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:15,940
We sing the heart
of our true friend, Mumble.
我们唱出波波的心声

983
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:22,110
You are a nation of peeny-weeny,
piffling, piccolini, piddly-diddly pouft!
你们是小心眼小鼻子小眼睛小家子气的小气鬼

984
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,250
Together, we prevail.
团结才有希望

985
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,280
In the wisdoms, we trust.

We trust.
我们信仰

987
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:34,360
Look out
# 当心

988
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:39,060
Look out
# 当心

989
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,840
Look out
# 当心

990
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,630
Look
# 当……

991
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:51,900
Look out
# 当心

992
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:59,780
Don't worry, tall guy.
My father also called me a pitiful loser.
别担心，高个子
我爸也说我是没用的肉脚

993
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,080
Look how I turn out.
看看我现在，我还不是好好的

994
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,450
You're not helping, Ramon.
你在帮倒忙，雷蒙

995
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,320
He gonna be okay. All he gotta do
is find out what happened to the fish.
他不会有事的
只要查清楚鱼都去哪了就好办了

996
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:08,460

- He think of something.
- 他要怎么查？
- 他会有办法的

997
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,620
- The aliens.
- What?
- 外星怪客
- 什么？

998
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,630
- I'm gonna talk to the aliens.
- How you gonna find aliens?
- 我要去和外星怪客对话
- 你去哪里找他们？

999
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,360
- Lovelace.
- He don't like you. He don't like you at all.
- 爱拉斯
- 可是他根本就不喜欢你

1000
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,630
That's okay. I'll appeal
to his better nature.
没关系，我会激起他的同情心

1001
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:21,270

- 你要怎么做？
- 对他严刑铐打？

1002
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,930
- Unimaginable torture?
- Imaginable torture?
- 难以想像的酷刑？
- 可以想像的酷刑？

1003
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,310
- Your singing?
- No!
- 你的歌声？
- 不要吧！

1004
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,810
"Can anybody find me"...
# 有谁可以为我…

1005
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,880
- You're cracking the ice!
- Avalanche!
- 冰都被你震裂了
- 是雪崩！

1006
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:33,710
Yes, okay. Thank you.

1011
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,180
Is this a bad time?
时机好像不太对喔

1012
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,280
I know we don't have
an appointment, but...
我知道我们没预约…

1013
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:06,580
Just one question and
I want a straight answer.
只有一个问题，我要你老实回答

1014
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,350
Where do I find the mystic beings?

1015
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,180
Why don't he speak?

1016
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,820
Lovelace, you okay?
爱拉斯，你没事吧？

1017

- 他中邪了
- 是癫痫，癫痫！

1018
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,140
- Open the beak.
- Grab his tongue.
- 把嘴掰开
- 拉出他的舌头

1019
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,900
He's choking. That thing
around his neck, it's too tight.
他脖子上的东西勒太紧了

1020
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,700

- On three.
- 嘿，你怎么不早说
- 听我数到三

1021
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,140
Stop! Listen! No! Amigos! Amigos! Stop!
- 一、二、三、四！
- 住手，大伙儿，住手！

1022
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,310
- What?
- You're hurting him.

Any better?
有没有好一点？

Lovelace, how did you get
that thing around your neck?
你脖子上的东西是怎么来的？

1025
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,060
- It was bestowed on him.
- By the mystic beings.
- 神赐给他的
- 奥秘之神

1026
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,390
- They didn't bestow it?
- No.
- 不是吗？
- 不是

1027
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,550
Oh, come on, he don't know
what he's saying.
拜托，他脑袋糊涂了

1028
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,720
You were swimming
and it just got caught around your neck.
你在游泳，结果被那玩意套住？

1029
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,800
Oh, no way. He the guru.
不可能，他是大师

1030
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:02,000
Lovelace, did you ever actually meet
a mystic being?
爱拉斯，你见过奥秘之神吗？

1031
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,370
Officially?
真的吗？

1032
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,840
No.
没有

1033
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:08,950
I knew it! It's all a lie.
我就知道，他在骗人

1034
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,980
But this belongs to someone.
这一定属于某个人

1035
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:13,850
If we could find them,
I bet you they could take it off.
要是能找到他们，我敢肯定他们能把它拿下来

1036
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:18,490
Show me where you found it. I'm sure
they could help us. You and me both.
告诉我你在哪里被套住的
我相信他们会帮助我们的，你和我

1037
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,230
Two words, three syllables.
两个单词，三个音节

1038
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,190

- You're dying?
- 到底是什么？
- 你快挂了？

1039
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:29,060
No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life.
不对，过去，你的过去…

1040
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,830
You're passing gas.
你在放屁

1041
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,230
Now he thinks he's an elephant seal.
不对，他说他是海象

1042
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,340
No, no, no. Go over the mountains.
不对，翻越那座山

1043
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:39,450
- Go over the mountains!
- Through the land of the elephant seals.
- 翻越那座山
- 前往海象王国

1044
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:44,210
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals.
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals!
- 越过海象王国
- 答对了！

1045
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,320
- Wait.
- What?
- 等等
- 什么？

1046
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:00,220
I hear voices.
我听到声音

1047
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,060
- There is a voice.
- Where?
- 传来一个声音
- 哪里？

1048
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,800
- There's a little voice on the wind.
- Mumble!
- 风中传来微弱的叫声
- 曼波！

1049
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,270
- "Mambo"?
- "Mambo"?
- “曼波”？
- “曼波”？

1050
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,870
- Listen.
- Mumble Happy Feet.
- 听
- 快乐大脚，曼波

1051
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,640
- Gloria?
- Gloria!
- 葛露亚？
- 葛露亚！

1052
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:11,800
Gloria?
葛露亚？

1053
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,500
Hey, you got a stalker.
She's obsessed with you, man.
嘿，来了个追随者
她很崇拜你呦！

1054
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,590
I can't believe it's you.
我不敢相信是你

1055
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,810
Of course it's me.
当然是我了

1056
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,820
What are you doing here?
你跑来做什么？

1057
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:29,190
All the love in the world can't be gone
# 世界的爱不会消失

1058
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,230
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
# 需要爱的人绝对不会错

1059
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,130
- Oh, my.
- So which way, twinkletoes?
- 噢，天哪
- 往哪走，舞王？

1060
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,670
No, no, no. If you come,
you may never get back home.
不行，你跟我走就回不了家

1061
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,210
Fine by me.
我无所谓

1062
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:46,840
Gloria, you have a life back there.
I don't. I mean, we don't. Not out here.
葛露亚，你过得好好的，我不一样
我们不能在这里过日子

1063
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:50,110
How can we keep an egg safe?
That's if we ever had an egg.
怎么保护蛋？如果要生蛋的话

1064
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,880
Well, I don't need an egg to be happy.
我不必生蛋就很快乐

1065
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:57,080
You say that now, but what about later
when all your friends have eggs?
你现在说的容易
等你朋友都生了你就会后悔

1066
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,690
Then I'll have you.
我有你就好

1067
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:04,530
Now he's going to pledge
his soul forever.
立下山盟海誓的机会来了

1068
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,820
- Gloria.
- Here it comes.
- 葛露亚
- 他要说了

1069
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,930
I'm a particular kind of guy,
the kind of guy who needs his own space.
我是个怪胎
我需要自己的空间

1070
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,070
It's not you, it's me.
你没问题，是我的错

1071
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,680
I'm just not up for a serious relationship
right now.
我还没准备认真谈感情

1072
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:21,180
What he's trying to do now
is he's pushing her away. Let's watch.
他想要赶她回家，好戏上场啰

1073
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,840
No matter what you say or do,
you're stuck with me.
不管你怎么说我都跟定你了

1074
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:28,110
Oh, come on. As if you're not
totally thrilled that I'm here.
少装了，你看到我很高兴

1075
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:31,750
- Now she got him on the ropes.
- See, right there is your problem.
- 她把他逼到死角
- 瞧，这就是你的问题

1076
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:33,830
You think you're irresistible, don't you?
你自以为是万人迷，对吧？

1077
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:36,330
I don't care where you're from,
that's got to hurt.
这种话真伤人

1078
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,230
- Excuse me?
- Gloria's so gorgeous, Gloria's so talented.
- 你说什么？
- 葛露亚美若天仙，才华洋溢

1079
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,390
What?
什么？

1080
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,970
Just because
you can hit a few high notes.
会飚高音有什么了不起

1081
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,260
You got a problem with my singing?
你对我的歌声有意见？

1082
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,670
No, it's perfectly fine.
我觉得还好？

1083
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,710
- "Fine"?
- Lf you like that sort of thing.
- 还好？
- 如果你喜欢这样赞美你的话

1084
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,470
- It's a little Nana Tootsie for my taste.
- What?
- 我觉得你的曲风太幼稚了
- 什么？

1085
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,770
You know, showy, flashy, froufrou.
没品味，太煽情，太浮华了

1086
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,440
- "Froufrou"?
- That's right.
- 太浮华了？
- 没错

1087
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,750
Coming from someone who thinks it's cool
to jig up and down really fast on the spot...
你只会用两只脚乱跳乱抖

1088
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,190
...like some twitchy idiot.
像个抽筋的小丑

1089
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,590
You stubborn, hippity-hoppity fool!
固执又可恶的讨厌鬼

1090
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,630
Right back at you.
骂得好

1091
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,470
Amigo, that was a good thing you do.
你这么做是为她好

1092
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,910
She is going to be so much better off
without you.
她离开你会过更好的生活

1093
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,210
She is going to find a good, steady guy
to comfort her...
她会去找一个善良的，站得稳的家伙来安慰她

1094
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:33,580
...and love her up real good
and raise a big family.
真心爱她，组织大家庭

1095
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,980
- Ramon.
- And then she's going to let herself go...
- 雷蒙
- 然后她会变成黄脸婆…

1096
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,280
Ramon. He's hurting. He's hurting bad.
雷蒙
他很心痛，痛到不行

1097
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:44,120
Oh, listen, listen, don't hold it in
or you explode. You got to let it out.
听好，别强忍，不然会爆炸

1098
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,990
You just let it out. You let it out.
你要发泄出来，发泄出来吧

1099
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,030
Everybody, turn away for a moment.
大伙儿，转过去

1100
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,500
If she leave him now
# 她离开他

1101
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:57,870
She take away the biggest part of him
# 带走他的一部分

1102
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,180
Don't, baby, please, don't go
# 宝贝，请不要走

1103
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,210
Please, guys.
拜托，伙计们

1104
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,380
No more singing.
不要再唱了

1105
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,630
Then she say to me, "Enough,
you are making me nauseous."
她跟我说：“你让我好想吐”

1106
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,530
So I become silent, almost moody,
and you know what she says?
我就生闷气不说话
你知道她怎么说？

1107
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,760
"You never share. You got to let it out."
“你从来不说，你要发泄出来”

1108
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,700
- Ramon, come on.
- Let it out. Let it out.
- 雷蒙，够了
- 发泄出来

1109
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,310
Stop it! Let it go.
够了

1110
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,140
- I never had a good relationship in my life.
- Give him a hug. Give him a hug.
- 我这辈子不曾有过美好恋情
- 抱抱他

1111
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:35,540
- I let it out!
- There we go.
- 我发泄出来了
- 开始了

1112
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,280
- I let it out.
- I know. Get over it.
- 我发泄出来了
- 我知道，别再发泄了

1113
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:41,250
- Can you keep going?
- Yeah.
- 你还能走吗？
- 可以啊

1114
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:44,620
- What's that smell?
- It wasrt me.
- 什么味道？
- 不是我

1115
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,530
Hey, Fluffy, we're following you.
Get up here.
嘿，大毛球，是你在带路，快上来

1116
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,730
So these elephant seals,
they're not penguin eaters, are they?
这些海象
他们不吃企鹅，对吧？

1117
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:04,310
I don't know.
I believe they are herbivores.
不知道，他们是食草动物

1118
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,340
- What?
- You know, kelp-suckers.
- 什么？
- 我是说，他们只吃海藻

1119
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,850
Here we go, Lovelace. Come on.
来吧，爱拉斯，跳

1120
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,380
Jump in time. Jump in time.
该跳啰，该跳啰

1121
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:15,320
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay, okay, okay. Ready?
- 好了，我们走吧
- 好、好、好了吗？

1122
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,930
I can do this. I can do this.
I got to trick myself.
我可以的…我要骗自己做得到

1123
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,990
Boy, look at that. What?
你看，那是什么？

1124
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:43,510
You blokes better be lost,
because trespassing's a crime.
你们最好快滚，擅闯民宅是犯罪

1125
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:47,680
- We're just passing through.
- Yeah. We're with him.
- 我们只是路过
- 对，他带我们来的

1126
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,760
You wouldn't be heading
over them distant hills...
你们该不会想越过高山……

1127
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,860
...and through the blizzard country?
……再穿过冰天雪地吧？

1128
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,820
If it's the only way
to the forbidden shore, yeah.
这样才能抵达禁忌彼岸

1129
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,190
Crikey.
了不起

1130
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,860
You might come face to face
with an annihilator.
你们可能会面对面碰上终极杀手

1131
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:02,060
An alien annihilator?
终极杀手？

1132
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,170
Too right. Cut you up
as soon as look at you.
没错，一见到你就会宰了你

1133
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,370
Waste every living thing in their path.
见一个杀一个

1134
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,200
Could they be annihilating the fish?
鱼也是他们杀的吗？

1135

Every living thing.
只要是活的都逃不了

1136
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:14,610
Merciless, mate. Merciless.
冷血无情，毫不留情

1137
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,080
Even if you're a whopping great whale...
即使你是庞大的巨鲸……

1138
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,910
...they drag your sorry carcass ashore...
他们照样把你拖到岸上

1139
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:25,790
...dice you up, melt you down,
and turn you into fun food.
……切成块，化成汤
变为他们的美味大餐……

1140
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,220
One day you're a big old whale...
前一刻你还是一头巨鲸……

1141
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,690
...next minute...

1142
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,260
...fun food.
……就变成美味大餐了

1143
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:33,870
Someone's gotta stop them.
一定要有人阻止他们

1144
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:36,530
Oh, yeah? What's gonna be
your approach?
是吗？你要怎么做？

1145
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,730
If I could just talk to them.
我可以找他们谈

1146
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:40,400
Appeal to their better nature.
激起他们的同情心

1147
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:41,560
Beauty.
漂亮

1148
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:47,340
When that crafty little trick pays off,
you be sure to let us know, won't you?
成功了记得要通知我们哦

1149
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:50,380
All right, Lovelace, let's go.
好吧，爱拉斯，我们走

1150
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,710
See you, Lovelace.
再见，爱拉斯

1151
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,590
Your funeral, mate.
那边会是你的墓地，伙计

1152
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,970
Oh, man!
噢，天

1153
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:53,740
- Push tight.
- Okay.
- 用力推啊
- 好

1154
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,560
Come on, guys. Let's do it.
来啊，伙计们，加油！

1155
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:14,630
You can do it. Come on, push!
你们能行的，快点，推啊

1156
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,900
What's that noise?
什么声音？

1157
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:03,640
There's no noise.
没听见啊

1158
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,380
- No gasping. No wheezing.
- Where's Lovelace?
- 没有喘气，也没有呼吸
- 爱拉斯呢？

1159
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:13,220
Sometimes a brave penguin
will just slip away to die.
有时候勇敢的企鹅会躲起来等死

1160
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,330
Do you think he went to a happy place?
他上了天堂吗？

1161
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:19,090
- Probably.
- No, no. I think he went this way.
- 有可能
- 不，他往这边走了

1162

So you'll be back soon, right?

Hey, come on. Let him eat.
嘿，别问了，让他吃吧

Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us.

But there's plenty for everyone.

No, no, Ma! Ma!

01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:47,630
Everybody, listen up! I've got big news.

1303
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,950
I know who's taking the fish!
我知道鱼被谁抢走了

1304
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:52,600

- 对，然后把他的脑子也挖走了

Kind of weird, seeing you again.
再看到你，觉得有点怪怪的

1311
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:06,800

01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:15,520
So which one is yours?
哪个是你孩子？

1316

All of them.

This is our singing class.
He teaches rhythm. I teach the blues.
他们是我歌唱班的学生
他教韵律，我教蓝调

1318
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,290

- I guess I never heard the right song.
- 你们没有…？
- 我想我还没等到属于我的那支歌

01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:30,590
That's great! I didn't mean...

01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:32,530
I found out who's taking the fish.
我查出是谁偷走了鱼

They're big and kind of ugly,
but, Gloria...
他们很巨大，长得又丑
但是，葛露亚……

They're coming here.

Oh, is that so?

They'll be here soon.
I think they wanna help us.

So now you speak with them?
那你跟他们谈过了？

1326
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:46,450
Well, they don't speak penguin,
but they seem to respond to this.
这个，他们不说企鹅语
但他们对这个有反应

1327
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,680
- What's he doing?
- You gotta be kidding me.
- 他在干嘛？
- 你玩我啊？

I suggest we all do it.
It really gets their attention.
我建议大家都这么做
这真的很吸引他们

1329
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,390
And why would it do that?
为什么要这么做？

1330
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,460
Beats me, but it works.
你问住我了，不过真的有用

1331
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:59,500
- Hey, it's the hippity-hopper.
- Freaky feet!
- 嘿，是那个脚抽筋的家伙
- 怪胎！

1332
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:00,650
Boys, boys...
孩子们，孩子们……

- Fluffy.
- Tall guy.

1334
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,990
- Stretch!

- 朋友！

1335
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:10,470
So you dare come back?
你还敢回来？

1336
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:13,370
He says he's found aliens
and they're taking our fish.
他说他找到外星怪客了
是他们抢走了我们的鱼

1337
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:16,070
He says that they're coming
and we all have to do this.
他说他们要来了
还让我们都这么做

1338
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:21,080
There be no such thing as aliens!
这世上没有外星怪客这东西！

1339
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:25,920
Mumble, turn around.
曼波，转过去

1340
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:30,550
It's a disease.
是种疾病

1341
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,660
Is that from them?
是他们弄的吗？？

1342
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:37,530
Yeah. But don't be afraid.
I think it's a way to find me, that's all.
对，可是不要怕，这样他们才能找到我

1343
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:41,400
You led them here?
You turned them on your own kind?
你带他们来，背叛你的同胞？

1344
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:46,110
Wait a second, you just said
there's no such thing as aliens.
等等，你刚才不是说外星怪客不存在吗？

1345
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,670
Well, there's not.
这个，当然没有

1346
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:54,480
But if there were, only a traitorous fool
would bring them here.
不过万一有，只有叛徒才会带他们来这里

1347
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:55,750
But they have to come.
他们一定要来

1348
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,890
They're the ones taking our fish.
They can do something about it.
他们偷走我们的鱼，可以还给我们

1349
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,550
None but the Great 'Guin
has the power to give and take away.
只有企鹅歌神才有这种神力

1350
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:07,190
The Great 'Guin didn't put things
out of whack, the aliens did.
但是企鹅歌神没有破坏生态环境
是外星怪客干的

1351
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:11,700
A fool returns this day
to mock our suffering.
这个白痴今天回来是来嘲笑我们的苦难

1352
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:16,000
We are starving
and he wants us to hippity-hop.
我们在挨饿，他还要我们跳舞

1353
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:19,110
So do we hold fast to our ways...
我们是要坚守企鹅传统

1354
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:23,980
...or do we bend to the fetid fantasies
of a dancing fool?
还是让这个疯狂叛徒愚弄我们？

1355
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:35,490
Say, how does that feet thing go again?
你说要怎么跳才对？

1356
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:37,220
Yeah, show us, Mumble.
对啊，给我们演示一下，曼波

1357
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,660
Oh, it's really quite easy.
哦，其实很简单

1358
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,460
No, no!
不，不！

1359
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:43,970
No, you must resist!
不要听他的！

1360
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,500
That's right.
很好

1361
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:50,240
- Pointless nonsense.
- Resist! Stand your ground!
- 没用处的胡闹
- 别听他的话，坚守立场

1362
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:53,740
Stand your ground against this folly!
抗拒这种胡闹的行为！

1363
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,580
Raise your voices, brothers.
大声吼出来，同胞们

1364
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,050
Cry out in defiance of this jiggity-joggity!
喊出你们对这些小丑的蔑视！

1365
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:08,350
Show me what you got.
秀几招来看看

1366
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,890
You got it.
对极了

1367
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,870
Come on.
来吧

1368
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,370
Work, work it.
好，继续

1369
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:23,630
Yes, yes! Call on the wisdoms!
很好，召唤智慧之神

1370
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:25,540
Let the world tremble!
让大地颤抖！

1371
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,840
For when all others leave...
大家都离开……

1372
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:29,880
...we remain!
……只有我们留守！

1373
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,240
Mumble! Mumble!
曼波，曼波！

1374
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:36,220
Mama? Amigos.

- 哦，毛球
- 我们等了你好久

1379
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:51,530
- Oh, yeah.
- Where's Pa?
- 噢，耶
- 爸在哪里？

1380
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:53,970
Believe me. You don't wanna see
your deadbeat dad.
你不会想见到你老爸

1381
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:56,200
- Your pa is sort of...
- What?
- 你爸有一点……
- 有点什么？

1382
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:58,670
Come on, I'll show you.
来吧，我带你去看他

1383
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:09,850
Memphis?
孟菲斯？

1384
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:12,320
Memphis?
孟菲斯？

1385
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:13,980
Pa?
爸？

1386
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,520

Is it truly you?

Every last bit of me, Pa.

I thought...

There ain't been one day...
打从你一出生

1392
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:48,450
...not one day, that I done right by you.
我就没有好好对待你

1393
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,820
Oh, Pa.
哦，爸

1394
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,870
Dance for him, Daddy.
为他跳舞吧，孩子他爸

1395

Dance with your boy.

You'll have to forgive me.
你必须原谅我

1397
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,640
The music's gone clean out of me.
我完全没有节奏感

1398
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,110
No, it hasn't.
不，不会的

1399
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:16,080
It's just like singing with your body.
这就像用身体唱歌

1400
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,280
Come on, baby. We can do it.

Oh, Mama.

It's just one big old foot after the other.
两只脚来回跳动就行了

1403
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:30,960
That's it.
就这样

From dusk till dawn

# 想成为我的女孩，不必多么富有

1413
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:08,430
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
# 想主宰我的世界，不必特意装酷

1414
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:12,510
Ain't no particular song
I'm more compatible with
# 没有比这，更适合我的歌曲

1415
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:17,340
I just want your extra time and your...

I think you better dance now.
我想你现在最好开始跳舞

1419
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:43,590
First, there was just one.
Now there's thousands.
本来只有一只，现在有几千只

1420
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,460
- Are they trying to tell us something?
- What's the problem?
- 他们想告诉我们什么吗？
- 问题出在哪？

1421
01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:49,430
- We're messing with their food chain.
- We've gotta do something.
- 我们破坏了他们的食物链
- 我们必须设法弥补

1422
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,300
- We suggest a ban on all marine harvesting.
- Too much money. Too many jobs.
- 我建议禁止捕捉海洋生物
- 牺牲太大了

1423
01:36:55,210 --> 01:36:57,370
Why should we do anything at all?
我们为什么要帮他们？

1424
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,450
They're just a bunch of flightless birds
at the bottom of the world.
它们只是这个世界的底层里
一群不会飞的笨鸟

1425
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,290
I don't wanna live in a world
without penguins.
我可不想生活在没有企鹅的世界里

1426
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,820
What are we gonna do about it?
我们应该怎么做？

1427
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:16,650
Bang up the sign "No Fishing."
立起警示牌，严禁捕鱼

1428
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:21,830
Is equal to the love...
那可是你们所做的……

1429
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,400
...you make.
……爱

1430
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:31,640
Oh, baby. Right on.
噢，宝贝，好极了

1431
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:49,290
Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy-headed boy
# 回想过去，当我还穿着尿布

1432
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:53,600
It's like a jungle sometimes
# 这就像是花丛

1433
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:55,960
It makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
# 让我时而疑惑，如何抵挡这般诱惑

1434
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,370
Bring it on! Go ahead!
放马过来吧！来啊！

1435
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:04,230
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
# 尽管我们有时，会一无所获

1436
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:08,280
We were happy with
The joy the day would bring
# 但我们仍然享受，生活的快乐

1437
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:11,610
I wish those days
Would come back once more
# 我怀念那些，逝去的时光

1438
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:15,980
Come back those days, those days
Come back, don't go
# 回来吧 美好时光
# 回来吧 别再离去

1439
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:19,050
Come here, babe. Come on back.
# 来吧，宝贝，回来吧

1440
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:20,210
Come on back
# 回来吧

1441
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:22,020
- Come on back
- Come on back
- # 回来吧
- # 回来吧

1442
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:24,690
- Come on back
- Come on back
- # 回来吧
- # 回来吧

1443
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:27,060
I love them, I love them
# 我爱那些，我爱那些

1444
01:38:27,230 --> 01:38:28,390
I love them, I love them
# 我爱那些，我爱那些

1445
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:36,330
Those days, those days
Those days, those days
# 那些美好时光，那些美好时光
# 那些美好时光，那些美好时光

1446
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:42,000
Those days
# 那些美好时光
