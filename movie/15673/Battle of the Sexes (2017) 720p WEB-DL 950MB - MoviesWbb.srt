(grunts)

2
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,330
(panting)

3
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,190
(crowd cheering wildly)

4
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,295
SPORTSCASTER 1: <i>A great way</i>
<i>to win a championship.</i>

5
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:06,131
<i>With a strenuous</i>
<i>brilliant smash...</i>

6
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,167
<i>...Billie Jean King is the...</i>

7
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:12,471
<i>...1972 champion</i>
<i>of the United States!</i>

8
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:13,639
(cheering continues)

9
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,183
SPORTSCASTER 2 (on TV):
<i>Earlier today,</i>
<i>Billie Jean King continued</i>

10
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,318
<i>what has already</i>
<i>been a record year...</i>

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,587
<i>...with an exciting</i>
<i>6-4, 7-6 win</i>

12
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,557
<i>over Rosie Casals</i>
<i>in a sudden-death tiebreaker.</i>

13
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,694
<i>the most successful woman</i>
<i>player of all time...</i>

14
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,597
<i>...and prompts a phone call</i>
<i>from a very special fan:</i>

15
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,199
<i>President Nixon.</i>

16
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,167
BILLIE JEAN:
<i>Hello, Mr. President.</i>

17
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,203
NIXON: <i>Well, I just wanted</i>
<i>to congratulate you.</i>

18
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,171
<i>And I'm glad to see</i>
<i>a fellow Californian</i>

19
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,874
BILLIE JEAN: <i>And I'm glad</i>
<i>to be the first woman</i>

20
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,209
<i>to do it, too.</i>

21
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:53,345
<i>and you've had</i>
<i>a really marvelous year.</i>

22
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,215
<i>Thank you, Mr. President.</i>
<i>Thank you very much, sir.</i>

23
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,483
SPORTSCASTER 2:
<i>Being queen for the day</i>

24
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:58,717
<i>is not enough for this King.</i>

25
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,519
<i>I bet you my head's too big.</i>

26
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,354
SPORTSCASTER 2: <i>She's been</i>
<i>outspoken in her demands</i>

27
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,723
<i>for higher pay</i>
<i>for all women players.</i>

28
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,861
<i>There's no stopping</i>
<i>this little lady.</i>

29
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,797
<i>Billie Jean King celebrated</i>
<i>her win with a big...</i>

30
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,165
(TV stops)

31
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,783
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

32
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,286
<i>...please welcome 1972</i>

33
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,788
<i>U.S. Open Women's</i>
<i>Singles Champion...</i>

34
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,324
<i>...Billie Jean King.</i>

35
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,732
(soft music playing)

36
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,520
Have you seen this?

37
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,955
No. Hey, Gladys.

38
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,290
You want a dance?

39
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,558
I want a gun.

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,725
They just snuck this out

41
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,694
in the middle of the night.
Lowlifes.

42
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,296
This is outrageous.

43
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,698
And it's got Jack Kramer's
fingerprints all over it.

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,267
You're absolutely
right it does.

45
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,735
I know where he's hiding.

46
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,672
You want to come?

47
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:29,541
No. No, you go
do your thing.

48
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,876
But good luck.

49
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,416
Thank you very much, honey.
Sure, Mr. Kramer.

50
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,585
Thank you.
Of course.

51
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,819
GLADYS: They won't get
away with it.

52
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,887
Uh-oh.

53
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,589
DOORMAN:
You can't go in there.

54
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,324
SANDERS: Excuse me.

55
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,725
Wait a minute.

56
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,961
Surprised in their lair.

57
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,997
This is an unexpected
pleasure. (stutters)

58
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,866
My goodness, you both look
sensational, if I may say.

59
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,569
You're not supposed
to be in here, you know.

60
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,005
Because I'm a woman
or because I'm a Jew, Bob?

61
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,708
Please, you're welcome here.
Have a seat.

62
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,745
What can we do for you?

63
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,480
Would you like
a glass of something maybe?

64
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,815
BILLIE JEAN:
No, thank you, Jack.

65
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,352
I find it's best
to be clear before

66
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,853
committing cold-blooded
murder, so...

67
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,955
...clarify...

68
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,691
...the press release.

69
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:20,892
Ah, yes.

70
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,494
It says here
that you're offering

71
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,029
the men's winner $12,000...

72
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,798
...and $1,500 to the women's.

73
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,533
Those are the terms.

74
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,035
The men's prize
needs to be that high

75
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,503
to attract the best players.

76
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,373
the most prestigious
tournament in America.

77
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,275
And paying the women
less than ever

78
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,610
makes it more prestigious.
Uh...

79
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,647
Well, it's simply a question
of what we can afford.

80
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,548
People pay to see
the men play.

81
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,916
They're the draw.

82
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,985
They're eight times
more of a draw?

83
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,787
Sorry?

84
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,921
You're offering
the men's winner

85
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,790
eight times that of the women.

86
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,392
Do we bring in
an eighth of the crowd?

87
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,494
I don't know
percentages, but...

88
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,062
They sold the exact
same amount of tickets

89
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,531
to the women's final today
as the men's.

90
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,534
Isn't that right, Jack?
Today, yeah, I suppose so.

91
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,404
Same sales, same prize money.
Makes sense to me.

92
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,072
KRAMER: Oh, come on.
Be reasonable.

93
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,708
There's no way
that we could afford that.

94
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,376
What's your argument, Jack?

95
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,648
the men have families
that they have to support.

96
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,518
I'm the main breadwinner
in my family.

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,420
Yeah. Yeah.

98
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,487
Look.

99
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,027
The men are simply...
more exciting to watch.

100
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,396
They are.

101
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,931
They're faster.
Fact.

102
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,433
And stronger.
Fact.

103
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,667
And more competitive.

104
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:40,839
It's not your fault,
it's just... biology.

105
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,509
That's not my point. We sell
the same amount of tickets.

106
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,346
I'm sorry.
It's not going to happen.

107
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,785
Well, if that's
the way it is...

108
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,089
...we'll boycott
the tournament.

109
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,623
Fact.

110
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,828
Well, now...

111
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,997
...we'll sure miss
your pretty faces,
but go right ahead.

112
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,599
Not only will we boycott,

113
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,134
we'll set up
our own tournament.

114
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:13,138
At the exact same time
as the Pacific Southwest.

115
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,006
Fact.

116
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,410
Be sure and send me tickets.
You have a good night, ladies.

117
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,913
That'll never happen.

118
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,089
Are we really
gonna do this?

119
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,825
Sure we're gonna do this.

120
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,062
How are we gonna do this?

121
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,532
No idea.

122
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,435
Right.

123
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,042
PRISCILLA:
Did you have a busy day?

124
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,844
Run off my feet.
Not a minute to think.

125
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,516
(sighs) Whatever it is
I'm supposed to be

126
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,117
doing down there, Priscilla,
I'm not doing it.

127
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,487
Well, Daddy told me
that he thinks

128
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,623
you're an integral part
of the company.

129
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,957
Huh. Integral.

130
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,160
Like the stapler on my desk.

131
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,528
PRISCILLA: Well, it's steady,

132
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,796
and it's what
you need right now.

133
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,564
BOBBY: I know. I know.

134
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,037
I wonder how much peppercorns
are in here.

135
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,039
I don't know, Junior.

136
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,774
I'd say about a thousand.

137
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,777
No way! There got to be at
least five thousand in there.

138
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,779
I'd put a dollar
on a thousand.

139
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,849
Young man.
BOBBY: Whoa, no, no, no.

140
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:34,219
Young man,
we do not gamble
at the dinner table.

141
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:37,823
We do not gamble anyplace,
Bobby.

142
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,725
Exactly.
We do not gamble anyplace.

143
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,196
No, we do not.

144
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,765
(sighs)

145
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,101
(whispers) One dollar.

146
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,169
(whispers) Come on.

147
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,173
All right.

148
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,976
Oh, you know what?

149
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,845
I just remembered, I need
to go back to the office

150
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,513
and finish up some work.

151
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,715
Now?

152
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,951
Your father has been
so supportive, honey,

153
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,219
that I don't want
to let him down.

154
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,122
Delicious. Thank you.

155
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,691
See you later, kiddo.

156
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,866
I'm doubling down on Jack.

157
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,868
Bobby, we got $1,200
on the table!

158
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,803
$1,200, buddy!
(laughing)

159
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,040
(dogs bark)

160
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,109
KEN: Bobby, you're not allowed

161
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,677
to have dogs
that good-looking.

162
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,246
HERB: Miss one!

163
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,015
BOBBY: We got him on the run,
here we go!

164
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,683
We got him on the run!

165
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,252
Put the chair out there!

166
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,821
Two chairs
and I'll raise you $500 each.

167
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,092
(dogs barking)

168
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,031
Give the racket to the dog!

169
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,933
BOBBY: Oh, too good for you.

170
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,970
(men exclaim)

171
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,608
Jack, for the love of God!

172
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,911
JACK: Damn it.
BOBBY: Good game, Jack.

173
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,313
JACK: I thought I had you
this time, I really did.

174
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,782
BOBBY: That was a fine,
fine effort.

175
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,150
Great try, great try.

176
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:16,321
What do you expect, Jack?
Bobby's the world champ.

177
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,758
No, I had an advantage.
It was three against one.

178
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,627
It was three against one.

179
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,629
You know what?
He keeps betting me,

180
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,031
I don't know
what to do about it.

181
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,767
The thing about Jack is,
he can afford to lose.

182
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,068
You got to think
about Priscilla, Bobby.

183
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,305
You still married, Bobby?
BOBBY: Oh, barely.

184
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,206
He sure will be if he shows up
in a Rolls-Royce.

185
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,175
He sure as hell won't be if he
shows up in a Rolls-Royce.

186
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,209
Why?

187
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,311
Even Bobby
will find it tough

188
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,679
to talk his way out
of that one.

189
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:44,349
"This guy on the corner just
gave me a Silver Shadow."

190
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,584
Think that'll cut it?

191
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,687
The man just won himself
a Rolls-Royce!

192
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:49,788
LORNIE:
Herb, you're not getting it.

193
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,222
Bobby doesn't gamble anymore.

194
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,324
HANK:
Oh, he don't gamble anymore!

195
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,358
No, no, no.

196
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,993
Gamblers Anonymous
once a week,

197
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,828
shrink twice a week.
I'm a reformed man.

198
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,697
LORNIE: There you are.
Oh, there you go.

199
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,231
You know what? Actually,
Lornie's got a point.

200
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,233
That vehicle's kind
of big to hide.

201
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,836
Jack, why don't you just
keep it for a little while?

202
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,705
You saying
I'm not good for a bet?

203
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,974
No, no, no.
Just keep the engine warm

204
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,208
and don't nick up the paint.

205
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,343
(men laugh)

206
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:18,883
You don't see even a senior
tour making a hundred G's.

207
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,251
Oh, she reckons she ought
to get more than that.

208
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,720
Same as the men.

209
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,989
She's not happy
with $100,000?

210
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,391
That Billie Jean King,
what is her problem?

211
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,093
Bobby, you got to remember,
nowadays it's all

212
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,095
equality this, equality that.

213
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,963
They're burning bras,
for God's sake.

214
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,031
KEN: Why would they
ever pay the women

215
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,366
the same as the guys?

216
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,267
All I can tell you
is that there is nothing wrong

217
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,870
with a nice girl in a short
skirt chasing a ball.

218
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,006
BOBBY: You know,
I won the goddamn U.S. Open.

219
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,274
I could beat Billie Jean King
or any of those women.

220
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,377
But are they offering me
equal prize money on the tour?

221
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,012
No, sir, I'm getting peanuts.

222
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,046
Hey, there's a bet for you.

223
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,180
BOBBY: What's that?

224
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,282
Bobby Riggs
vs. Billie Jean King.

225
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,351
I'd pay a lot to see that.
(hair dryer whirring)

226
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,158
(indistinct chatter)

227
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,259
BILLIE JEAN: Hey, everybody?

228
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,029
I know
what you're all risking,

229
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,131
because I'm risking
the exact same thing.

230
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,265
More.

231
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,301
BILLIE JEAN: No, not more.
The same.

232
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,771
We're all putting our careers
on the line for this.

233
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,873
So I just want to thank you
for your bravery.

234
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,208
And your balls.

235
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,411
(women laugh)

236
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,279
Are we gonna get our hair
done before every event?

237
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,048
Because I could
get used to this.

238
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,051
The salon is a once-only
because the press is here.

239
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,786
And because
I love you so much.

240
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:30,288
Tomorrow the press won't be
here and I won't love you.

241
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,923
This is a budget tour,
ladies...

242
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,425
which means
you will be sharing rooms.

243
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,693
So you might as well start

244
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,894
getting to know
each other now.

245
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,262
I call bunking with Val!

246
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,431
I thought you were gonna
get us a sponsor, Gladys.

247
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,366
GLADYS: I...was. I...

248
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,902
...am, Rosie.

249
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,939
It's just that right now
we are broke, so shut up.

250
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,175
Well, wait. What about
our prize money?

251
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,943
ROSIE: Oh, Val, why are you
worried about prize money?

252
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,078
You only get that if you win.

253
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,345
(laughter)

254
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,081
All right, you've got
30 minutes before

255
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,450
you show your faces
to the press.

256
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,085
Hi.
Hi.

257
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,986
I've been moving around
too much, haven't I?

258
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,354
Yeah.

259
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,291
I'm sorry, I've been, uh...
I'm excited.

260
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,227
Or nervous or something.

261
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,962
You're all tennis players?

262
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,964
Yeah. You don't watch tennis?

263
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,233
Oh, no. I don't have a TV.

264
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,368
But I admire
what you guys are doing.

265
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,370
Sounds like you girls are
getting men to pay attention

266
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,339
to what you're saying
for once.

267
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,974
You know what would
really get their attention?

268
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:27,245
What? That would punish us
just as much as the men.

269
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,080
VALERIE: I don't think
I'd even miss it.

270
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,349
My ex went about it like
he was fixing the carburetor

271
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,951
on the Oldsmobile.

272
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,819
And he could never
get that damn car to start.

273
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,888
VALERIE: Rosie, come on!

274
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,223
At least women know
where the carburetor is.

275
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,493
So...

276
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:42,927
...Billie Jean...

277
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,330
...what do you want?

278
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,467
What do you mean?

279
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,905
With your hair. What do you
want to do with it?

280
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,974
Oh.
(both chuckle)

281
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,443
It doesn't matter.

282
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,245
You can just get it
out of my face.

283
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,347
You don't care
about how you look?

284
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,350
Someone as pretty as you?

285
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,555
Uh, it's... I'm not...

286
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,323
...pret... I mean, I don't...

287
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,828
Thank you for...
for saying that.

288
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,966
What's your name again?

289
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,102
Marilyn.

290
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:34,212
Would you let me just...
give you a little trim?

291
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,318
It'll make you feel like
a whole new person.

292
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,154
I don't think a haircut's ever
made me feel quite like that.

293
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,222
(chuckles)

294
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,161
Is that perfume?

295
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,197
It's lavender oil.

296
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,333
I put it on my wrists
just to relax the customers.

297
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,835
It's nice.

298
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,244
I love it.

299
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,378
(pounding on door)
ROSIE: Billie Jean!

300
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,247
Come on!
I'm coming!

301
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,348
All right!

302
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,116
ROSIE:
What is she doing in there?

303
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,651
It was nice to meet you.

304
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,286
Nice to meet you.

305
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,257
You know what?

306
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,559
We've got a tournament
in San Diego, actually,

307
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,395
next month,
and I have a lot of tickets.

308
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,364
So you could just
bring everyone and...

309
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,399
ROSIE: Billie Jean, let's go!
It's a lot of fun.

310
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,134
Yeah, everyone's
invited to come.

311
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,103
Next month in San Diego.

312
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,504
So... thank you again.

313
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,139
Thank you.

314
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,240
Finally.

315
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:13,511
Do you think there'll be
any cute photographers?

316
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,413
GLADYS: Peaches, I know
he's very cute, but let's go.

317
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:19,017
Get ready, and let's get
these contracts signed.

318
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,184
LARRY: Welcome to the WTA.

319
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,954
Thank you so much
for joining us.

320
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,157
That makes you
a professional.

321
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,426
GLADYS:
Keep this going. Don't dawdle.

322
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,694
ROSIE:
One dollar, Billie Jean.

323
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,129
Yeah, a whole dollar is right.

324
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,298
ROSIE: I'm gonna save it!

325
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,532
Thank you.
Welcome to the WTA.

326
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,566
VALERIE: Where do we sit?

327
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,634
Billie Jean.

328
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,471
Guess who showed up.

329
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,541
LARRY: Judy, come on.
Don't be shy.

330
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,010
GLADYS: This is an
exciting day, girls.
Look excited.

331
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,046
LARRY: Thank you very much.

332
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,715
Okay, girls. Come on,
let's start sitting, please.

333
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,417
LARRY: It's a big day, ladies.
Kerry, you're next.

334
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,584
GLADYS: We're gonna
take a big picture.

335
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,553
Billie Jean...

336
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,557
...what you're doing here
is a big mistake.

337
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,293
Are you here to give us
another option, Jack?

338
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,695
On behalf of the USLTA,

339
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:07,699
I'm here to ask you girls
not to do anything hasty.

340
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,201
So what are you offering?

341
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,636
I'm offering to keep you in

342
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,272
the United States
Lawn Tennis Association.

343
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,275
You're kicking us out.

344
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,311
You do this,
you're becoming our rivals.

345
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,980
We have no option.

346
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,615
I'll sure miss
your pretty face, Jack,

347
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,218
but you go right ahead.

348
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,120
GLADYS: Great.
And then we'll put Billie...

349
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,356
I'm gonna have a very exciting
moment in a second.

350
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,725
This is monumental.
Billie Jean?

351
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,059
BILLIE JEAN: One minute!

352
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,494
If you're not in the USLTA,

353
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,596
you can't play
the Grand Slams.

354
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,365
No Wimbledon. No nothing.

355
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,100
I get it.

356
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:45,636
without the greatest
women players in the world?

357
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,772
They're not so grand.

358
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,475
So I appreciate you coming,
Jack, very much...

359
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,743
...but if you have
nothing to offer us,

360
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,678
I have a contract to sign.

361
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,714
Bye, Jack.

362
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:03,421
GLADYS: Okay, girls,
hold those dollars up.
Beautiful.

363
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,191
Smile, girls.
This isn't a funeral.

364
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,193
Hold up that dollar.

365
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,797
Keep smiling, ladies,

366
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,799
but we've just been
kicked out of the USLTA.

367
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,067
PLAYERS: What?

368
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,570
Wave them
so Jack can see them!

369
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:25,209
Yep, it's a dollar, girls.
Remember that... One dollar.

370
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,291
Is that it? For all of you?

371
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,759
Can I have some ketchup?

372
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,164
Who died?

373
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,698
PLAYERS: Hey, Gladys.

374
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,135
Oh, I get it.
It's all my fault.

375
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,171
Well, Gladys has got
just the thing

376
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,640
for you miserable ingrates.

377
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,711
Cigarettes?

378
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,147
Ladies and gentle-ladies,
may I present to you

379
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,283
the Virginia Slims
Championships.

380
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,286
A Gladys Heldman/Philip Morris
co-production.

381
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,754
Smoking your guts out across

382
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,322
the United States
of America...

383
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,691
...in exchange for twelve
months funding...

384
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,561
...and prize money
of--drum roll, please...

385
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,197
(pounding table)

386
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,099
...$7,000.

387
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,600
VALERIE: Really?
Way to go, Mom!

388
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,836
For every tournament?
For every tournament.

389
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:28,239
That ought to perk up
your lousy second serve.

390
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,474
(hacking)
(chuckling)

391
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,876
You do the tennis,
I'll do the smoking.

392
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:35,313
My girls, from now on
we are fully funded.

393
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,848
I put in a call
to Ted Tinling,

394
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,718
who's gonna be our personal
couturier on tour.

395
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,453
You're each gonna
have your own tennis dresses

396
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,856
designed specially for you.
(players gasp)

397
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,524
And I put in a call
to every woman

398
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,892
who's ever picked up a racket.

399
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,127
Guess who's already signed on.

400
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,228
Oh. Oh.

401
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,330
Don't guess. Margaret Court.

402
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,900
ROSIE: "The Arm."
Billie Jean, are you scared?

403
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,502
I can take her.

404
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,638
GLADYS: Well, you'll get
your chance soon enough.

405
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,807
Waitress!
Ice cream sundaes all around.

406
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,243
We're in the money.

407
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,511
But...

408
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:09,247
...not all around.
Just my table and these two.

409
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,916
TED: Let's try the buttercup,
lemony sort of hue.

410
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:15,253
But I don't really feel it
pops with your complexion,

411
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,255
so let's try the blue.

412
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,257
Oh! It's wonderful, Ted.

413
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,626
You like it?
I love it!

414
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:22,894
And what will the esteemed

415
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,897
Lawn Tennis Association
say about this?

416
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,932
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you,

417
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,169
for the first time
in the history of tennis...

418
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,904
...color!

419
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,339
The shock will kill
the old dears.

420
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,689
DJ: 87 KMRP.

421
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,324
It's twelve minutes
after 7:00,

422
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,393
and we are privileged,
tennis fans...

423
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,795
...to have the great
Billie Jean King

424
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,830
in the studio with us today,
along with a...

425
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,433
...a lot of very lively
WTA tennis players.

426
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,834
Say hi, ladies.

427
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,403
TOGETHER: Hi.

428
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,972
The word is that you gals
are renegades

429
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,974
from the tennis establishment.
Is that right?

430
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,275
BILLIE JEAN: Yeah.

431
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,610
The U.S. Lawn
Tennis Association

432
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,545
wasn't really giving us women
our fair share,

433
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,980
so we thought...

434
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,715
..."Hey, we'll do it
on our own."

435
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,849
Taking the bull by the horns.

436
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,551
That's right.

437
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,586
ROSIE:
<i>Here's the inside scoop:</i>

438
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:25,223
<i>We are the ones laying down</i>
<i>the courts.</i>

439
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,891
<i>We're selling tickets.</i>

440
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,861
<i>And we have to fit in practice</i>
<i>somewhere in between there.</i>

441
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,597
BILLIE JEAN: <i>We are also</i>
<i>trying to get tennis away</i>

442
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,732
<i>from the stuffy old</i>
<i>country club sport.</i>

443
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,601
<i>We want it to be</i>
<i>for everybody.</i>

444
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,637
<i>It's 1973, so... we could</i>
<i>update a couple things.</i>

445
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,906
DJ:    <i>Now, you all</i>
<i>play each other</i>

446
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,441
<i>in the tournaments and...</i>

447
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,610
<i>...you room together as well.</i>

448
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,878
<i>So how does that work</i>
<i>when you have to room</i>

449
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,447
<i>with somebody</i>
<i>who just beat you...</i>

450
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,648
...or who you just defeated?

451
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,750
It's fine,
because I usually win.

452
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,652
BILLIE JEAN:
Oh. That's not true at all.

453
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,887
It's fine if you're not
rooming with Rosie.

454
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,757
Oh, okay. Don't room with
Rosie... That's the message.

455
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,994
We're also, you know,
united for a greater cause.

456
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,795
<i>So it keeps the focus</i>
<i>on something else.</i>

457
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,364
VALERIE:
<i>It's bigger than the match.</i>

458
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,599
Nice to meet you. Bye!

459
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,336
Do you all consider yourselves
women's libbers?

460
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,871
JULIE: Oh, sure.
BILLIE JEAN: I think so.

461
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,773
What we're doing here
is trying to prove

462
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,409
that women should be paid
and respected equally.

463
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:19,910
We're just as entertaining
as the men.

464
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,612
You're definitely
cuter than the men.

465
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,814
(all laughing)

466
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,050
DJ: <i>It must get a little</i>
<i>lonely out there on the road.</i>

467
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:28,753
<i>Don't you ever miss</i>
<i>your husbands?</i>

468
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,022
BILLIE JEAN:
<i>Sure. Of course we do.</i>

469
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,624
<i>I talk to Larry</i>
<i>on the phone every day.</i>

470
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,360
<i>We're used to it. As pros,</i>
<i>we're not home very often.</i>

471
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,828
And some of us
don't have husbands.

472
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,929
Whoa.

473
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,798
Single men,
you heard it here first.

474
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,067
Some of these ladies
are single themselves.

475
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,903
Especially Peaches.
Come on out.

476
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,039
Yeah, bring your daughters.
Or your sons.

477
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,407
Or bring everyone.

478
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,075
You could bring
your whole family.

479
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,543
That's the point of this tour.

480
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:55,413
It's for everyone,
and it's a whole lot of fun.

481
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,648
You heard it here, folks.
We'll get in more music,

482
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,816
but we got tickets
to give away,

483
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,551
so give us a call.

484
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,919
Thanks for coming by, ladies.

485
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,421
Thank you for having us.

486
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,589
Good luck.
Come on out!

487
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,634
It's not exactly the Ritz.

488
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,838
Margaret Court!
Welcome to the nuthouse.

489
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,807
Hi, Ted.
Hey, Margaret.

490
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,711
If you're looking for
the restaurant or the spa

491
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,846
or the swimming pool,
there isn't one.

492
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,081
But if you're looking
for the tickets

493
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,416
you're gonna sell
at the intersection...

494
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,951
they're right here.

495
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,487
Have a lovely evening.
Darling child.

496
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,497
MARGARET:
She's never liked me.

497
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,865
BARRY: Who? Gladys?

498
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,968
MARGARET: No, the great
Billie Jean King.

499
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,103
BARRY:
You just do your talking

500
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,637
on the court, honey.

501
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,574
Come on, cross over!

502
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:57,875
You can do it. There you go.

503
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,143
Watch out for the alligators.

504
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,644
I'm watching out
for the alligator.

505
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,113
You watch out
for the alligator.

506
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:04,582
I'm going across
the wobbly bridge.

507
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,118
Your mother's always
watching us. Right here.

508
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,619
Right here. Okay.

509
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,854
That'll burn you
right to the bones.

510
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,155
That's quicksand.

511
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,591
That's quicksand, all right.
Acid quicksand.

512
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,860
That's why you never
see any of your siblings.

513
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,661
Two rocks.
Don't fall in the quicksand!

514
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,597
Don't fall in the quicksand!

515
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,600
Okay. One more rock
and we're there.

516
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:24,735
Good. You got it.
What if I don't make it?

517
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:28,606
you're gonna make it.
One, two, three...

518
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:30,674
Whoa, whoa.
(doorbell rings)

519
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,510
Well, we almost made it.

520
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,049
Hey, honey!
Could you get that?

521
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,184
PRISCILLA: Okay.

522
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:42,086
I'm reading Junior a story.

523
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,525
Bobby?

524
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,193
Do you know anything
about a, uh...

525
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,663
Rolls-Royce! Cool!

526
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,131
BOBBY (softly): Damn it, Jack.

527
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,135
JUNIOR: Mom, it's got a TV!

528
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,905
Oh, my God.

529
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:02,940
I know, I know. Um...

530
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,108
It was Jack's idea.

531
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,843
You are like a little kid,
you know that?

532
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,711
Well, you're good with kids.

533
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,213
After everything
we talked about?

534
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,182
Everything you promised me?

535
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,756
Okay, okay, I get it.
Give me those.

536
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:20,958
(sighs)

537
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,694
Where are you going?

538
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,930
Can I come, too?
No, you can't come.

539
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,031
Junior!

540
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,934
(engine starts)

541
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,104
MARGARET: All right.
BOY: Thanks, Mrs. Court.

542
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,773
Thanks for coming.

543
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,975
Did you like it?

544
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,176
It was amazing.

545
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,947
Thanks for coming.
Thank you.

546
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,115
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

547
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,517
Nice hair.

548
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,719
You came!

549
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,489
Why didn't you tell me
how good you are?

550
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,491
Ah, well.

551
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,728
Can I ask you a question?

552
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,197
You may.
I may not answer it.

553
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,501
MARILYN: Do you like dancing?

554
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,036
I do.

555
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,005
Yeah.

556
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,073

MARILYN: I can't believe
how you move on the court.

562
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:41,305
It's like watching
some kind of...

563
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,140
...wild animal.

564
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,276
Aw, come on.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

565
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,680
Enjoyed it? I've never seen
anything like it! It was...

566
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,150
It must be intoxicating.

567
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,852
What? Playing tennis?

568
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,856
Being inside your skin.

569
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,292
MAN: Excuse me.

570
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:04,161
I'm so sorry for doing this.

571
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,664
Mrs. King,
I'm such a huge fan.

572
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,299
Oh. Thank you so much.

573
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,800
I'm Miles.

574
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,135
Miles. Great to meet you.

575
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:13,604
Do you dance
as well as you serve?

576
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:14,939
Oh, thanks, I don't think...

577
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:17,074
Tonight we're just gonna
stay here and watch.

578
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,143
Okay.
But nice to meet you, Miles.

579
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,277
You, too.

580
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,813
I'd love to dance!

581
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,983
Well, sure thing.

(chuckles softly)

592
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,877
You're perfect.

593
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,113
(laughs)

594
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,751
I got to go soon.

595
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,019
What?

596
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,420
No.
Yeah.

597
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,422
I got to get a bus
back to L.A.

598
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,890
No, it's too late for that.

599
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,792
You can't take
a bus right now.

600
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,029
You can stay in my room.

601
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,831
I've got two beds.
Honestly, it's no trouble.

602
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,366
Okay.

603
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,435
Thanks.

604
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,070
Sure. Yeah.

605
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,113
This is me.

606
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,715
Us.

607
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,183
Me.

608
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,284
(Marilyn chuckles)

609
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,462
So, Gladys used to
make us share rooms,

610
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:21,732
but we can afford our own now.

611
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,200
I usually take the bed
closest to the window.

612
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,070
But it's fine!
Take whichever
one you want.

613
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,431
I'm married.

614
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,403
That's okay.

615
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,206
I've got a boyfriend.
Sort of.

616
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,043
But you, uh...

617
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,046
...you...

618
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,152
...with women...too?

619
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:18,922
Yeah.

620
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,459
Do you?
No.

621
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,462
No, never. I'm...

622
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,333
There's only ever been Larry.

623
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,437
So...

624
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,074
...can I kiss you?

625
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,246
Mmm.

626
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:04,334
We can take it slow,
that's okay. There's no...

627
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:46,043
<i>It's one of the few sure</i>
<i>things I can count on in life.</i>

628
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:48,612
<i>You love your mother</i>
<i>and you know it.</i>

629
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,214
WOMAN 1: <i>Of course I love her.</i>

630
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,515
<i>I just think she's holding</i>
<i>a grudge because</i>

631
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,916
<i>I didn't go</i>
<i>into the profession</i>

632
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,218
<i>she picked out for me:</i>

633
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,552
<i>Housewife.</i>

634
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,322
(knocking on door on tv)

635
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:00,257
<i>My mother, she's here!</i>

636
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,961
<i>You're beautiful.</i>

637
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:07,331
<i>we turn to the world</i>
<i>of women's tennis...</i>

638
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,067
<i>...as Billie Jean King beat</i>
<i>Kristy Pigeon today,</i>

639
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,603
<i>two sets to zero,</i>
<i>in San Diego.</i>

640
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:15,939
<i>Next, the Virginia Slims tour</i>
<i>heads to Los Angeles.</i>

641
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,508
<i>In baseball, the Yankees</i>
<i>have started 0 and 3</i>

642
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,011
<i>after being swept on the road</i>
<i>by the Red Sox.</i>

643
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,181
(breathing heavily)

644
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,922
(telephone rings)

645
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,125
Oh, it's Larry.

646
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,227
Oh, God, what if it's Gladys?

647
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,096
Jesus,
what if it's my parents?

648
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,531
Well, none of 'em can see
down the phone, can they?

649
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,101
Don't joke. Don't joke.
Just don't...

650
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,302
Don't say anything, okay?

651
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:48,171
Just be quiet.
Just be quiet, okay?

652
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,108
Hello?

653
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,643
BOBBY: <i>Eureka!</i>

654
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:54,011
Hello?

655
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:55,145
<i>Eureka, Billie Jean!</i>

656
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,280
Who is this?

657
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,148
It's Bobby. Bobby Riggs.

658
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,684
<i>Bobby?</i>
<i>How'd you get my number?</i>

659
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,419
Called every hotel
in San Diego.

660
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,288
Listen, I had a great idea.

661
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,189
Okay. Well, it's after
midnight, Bobby,

662
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,991
so can we talk another time?

663
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:12,029
<i>Three sets,</i>
<i>five sets... Your choice.</i>

664
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:13,263
Are you drunk, Bobby?

665
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,531
No, of course not!

666
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:17,401
How about this:
"Man vs. Woman."

667
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:20,437
"Male Chauvinist Pig
vs. Hairy-Legged Feminist".

668
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,540
No offense. You're still
a feminist, right?

669
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,143
No, I'm a tennis player
who happens to be a woman.

670
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,278
That's right.
That's exactly who you are.

671
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,548
And I am a tennis player
who happens to be a man...

672
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,151
<i>...who says that he can beat</i>
<i>any woman on the planet.</i>

673
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,320
<i>Think of the publicity that</i>
<i>we get. Think of the money.</i>

674
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:37,587
No.

675
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,489
<i>Thirty-five grand.</i>

676
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,325
Where'd you get
that kind of money?

677
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,961
You see? You're tempted.
<i>I'm really not.</i>

678
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,495
I'm not interested, Bobby.
Good night.

679
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,064
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

680
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,399
And by the way,
I shave my legs.

681
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,268
(sighs)

682
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,604
Who was that?

683
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:58,475
That was just some crazy old
hustler trying to get a game.

684
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,609
I hope you don't mind.

685
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,545
I borrowed something
to sleep in.

686
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,148
Marilyn.

687
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,452
Ah.

688
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,622
You're gonna give me
the speech, aren't you?

689
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,291
I'm sorry.

690
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,494
Whatever I...

691
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,697
...may feel,
I can't act on it.

692
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:26,236
There's too much at stake.
I mean the tennis tour and...

693
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:27,504
Yeah.

694
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,639
And I have my husband.

695
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,608
He's a great...

696
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,345
...person, and he would be
heartbroken if he found out.

697
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,081
And my parents
would never speak to me again.

698
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,416
Hey, hey, hey.

699
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,551
I get it.

700
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,553
Okay.

701
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,065
Oh, hey.

702
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,034
Thanks.

703
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,174
'Night.
Good night.

00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,090

705
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,361
Hi.

00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,705
LARRY RIGGS: <i>Hello?</i>

00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,707

<i>Dad?</i>

709
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,845
<i>Okay.</i>

00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,422
Hey there, kiddo.

712
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,490
Hey.

713
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,261
Just for tonight.

714
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,465
Maybe tomorrow.

715
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:02,666
Sure, sure.

716
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,171
Oh, a little misunderstanding.

717
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,874
Sometimes Priscilla
goes off the deep end.

718
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,143
Oh, hey... did you see
my Rolls-Royce?

719
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,213
Yeah, that's cool, Dad.

720
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,481
You gonna live in it?

721
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,850
Yeah, well, I could. I could.
It's big enough.

722
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,619
But no, no, no.
I got plans, Larry.
Big plans.

723
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,687
Right.

724
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,291
Yeah, well,
I've... heard 'em.

725
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,660
All of 'em.

726
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,596
Good night, kiddo.

727
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:33,697
Good night, Dad.

00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,177

729
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,281

731
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,785
Honey!

732
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,888
Honey, come on.

733
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,323
Not even a fresh pair
of underpants?

734
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,325
Toothbrush?

735
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,464
Can't we just talk about this?

736
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,737
You know... Oh.

737
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,341
Oh.

738
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,345
Thank you!

GROUP: <i>Hi, Bobby.</i>

741
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,926
BOBBY: <i>At least</i>
<i>that's what Priscilla says.</i>

742
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:38,495
She's gonna leave me
unless I quit gambling.

743
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,732
Puzzles me, though,
that word: "Gambling."

744
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,436
Whenever Priscilla gets a car
out of the garage,

745
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,704
she's gambling big time.

746
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,407
Never checks the mirror.
Sticks it in reverse.

747
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,309
Puts her foot down,
right out onto the highway.

748
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,711
Jeez Louise, that's gambling!

749
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,814
But here I am,
Gamblers Anonymous.

750
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,417
And your point is what, Bobby?

751
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:03,553
My point is this:
Life's a gamble, right?

752
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,422
That's the thrill of it!

753
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:06,756
You know,
you folks aren't here

754
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,692
because you're gamblers.

755
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,695
You are here because
you are terrible gamblers.

756
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:16,333
That's the problem. You lose,
and that's why you're here.

757
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,735
I've been looking at you
guys yammering on

758
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,470
about all of your stuff and...

759
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,973
..."Oh, woe is me"
and "This is terrible."

760
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:24,708
But you know
what the problem is?

761
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,443
The problem is
you don't have a "thing."

762
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,311
LEADER: Can we just...
They don't have a thing.

763
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:29,879
They need an edge.
You need an angle,

764
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,748
an inside track, something...

765
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,584
...that's gonna turn you from
being a gambler to a hustler.

766
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,719
All right, Bobby, thank you.

767
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:38,788
Why should we give up
the one thing in life

768
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,724
that we really love?

769
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,926
These folks don't need to stop
what they're doing,

770
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,594
they just need
to get better at it.

771
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,730
Okay, Bobby, please.
Who's dealing? Who's in?

772
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,531
Huh?

773
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,635
I'm heartbroken.

774
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,637
I don't know why
she won't meet me halfway.

775
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:56,339
I mean, is that too
unreasonable to ask?

776
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,641
Have you considered
you might be

777
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,476
coming at this from
the wrong angle?

778
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:02,779
Every angle, Doc.
I have tried every angle,
believe me.

779
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,614
I know we've discussed
this before.

780
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,383
Oh, I don't know.

781
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:09,052
You're an alpha male.
She's an alpha female.

782
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:10,487
Maybe you have
to face the fact

783
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,389
that she's just not
the right woman for you.

784
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,391
Nah, I understand
what you're saying...

785
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:15,659
...but Billie Jean would make

786
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,927
the best match
by a million miles.

787
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:22,399
She is the leader of
these women. The face.

788
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:25,502
At this rate,
she's not even gonna be
Number 1 next season.

789
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:26,636
She's not?

790
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,406
Nope. Margaret Court.

791
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:32,309
Really? The Arm's
gonna be Number 1?

792
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:34,611
Huh.

793
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,446
Stick or twist?

794
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:38,581
Twist.

795
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,085
Jack of Hearts. Too bad.

796
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:45,522
The point is, not only is
Margaret gonna be Number 1...

797
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,791
...but she's a different
kind of woman.

798
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,693
You think she'd play me?

799
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,661
She's a nice
old-fashioned girl, Bobby.

800
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,496
She'll do as
she's damn well told.

801
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,969
I shouldn't have had so much
to drink last night.

802
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,571
It's inexcusable.

803
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,106
MARILYN:
You had like half a drink.

804
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,008
Well... that's half
a drink too many.

805
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,576
It's the finals this week.

806
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,411
Where are my keys?

807
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:09,913
I think they're in your hand.

808
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,515
Thank you. Okay.

809
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,751
You should leave now.

810
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:15,985
Then I'll follow
in about five minutes.

811
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:18,588
Or actually that will
seem suspicious.

812
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,956
Maybe you should
just stay here.

813
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,024
Okay.

814
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,528
You said
you'd give me a ride.

815
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,465
Right. Right.

816
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:29,966
Right on. Okay.

817
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,101
Ready to go?
Got everything?

818
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,435
Yeah.

819
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,637
Sorry about that.
I'm just a little...

820
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,614
TED: Be careful
with that mannequin, Henry.

821
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,583
Of course, Ted.

822
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,054
Well, look what we have here.

823
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:54,391
And a little <i>deshabille,</i>
<i>wouldn't you say?</i>

824
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:57,527
I would, Henry.
I most definitely would.

825
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,529
(softly) And what
do you think Larry would say?

826
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,797
He must know.

827
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,800
Well, there's knowing...

828
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,402
...and there's knowing.

829
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,636
GLADYS:
Nobody later than four.

830
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:07,771
Rosie? Where's Rosie?

831
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:08,838
ROSIE: I'm here.

832
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,008
No more
speeding tickets, okay?

833
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,544
This is tennis, not NASCAR.

834
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,846
And girls, I am begging you,
for God's sake...

835
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,815
some Slims at the photo call.

836
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:20,550
They've been great to us,

837
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,886
and we need them
to renew our contract.

838
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,622
And I like it.
I mean, look at me. Mmm.

839
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,425
Right?

840
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,427
You're late. And who's that?

841
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,564
This? My, uh, my friend.

842
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:37,434
Marilyn from the salon
in L.A.

843
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,701
Wait, is she coming
on tour with us?

844
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:39,903
That's a great idea.

845
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:43,173
Please, Gladys.
With all the photo shoots
we're doing,

846
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:44,574
we need a hairdresser.

847
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,109
That would be an N
followed by an O.

848
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,577
How's your spelling, Val?

849
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,846
No, no, no.
She lives in L.A.

850
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,781
She works
at the salon in L.A.

851
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,583
She can't just come
on the road.

852
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,118
JULIE: Come on.
It's not... No.

853
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,823
They're not gonna miss me
for just a few days.

854
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:02,058
ROSIE: Yeah. I mean,
we could all pay a little bit.

855
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,860
PEACHES: Yes, please, Gladys?
Look at them!

856
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,929
They get in my eyes.
I can't see the ball.

857
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:09,532
Please, I've had no time
to get these bangs done.

858
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,733
It's a great idea, Mom.

859
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,602
VALERIE: Imagine having
your own stylist.

860
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:13,937
JULIE:
Just for a little while.

861
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,805
Can you do anything
with this?

862
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,674
Of course! Yeah.

863
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,577
Ugh. Get in the car.

864
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,644
(all cheer)

865
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,748
Is this okay?

866
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,619
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, it's good.

867
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:56,246
You do know what she is,
don't you? That...

868
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:58,047
...woman with Billie Jean?

869
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,251
Hairdresser?

870
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:02,919
I think it's her lover.

871
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,922
That girl?

872
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,258
And Billie Jean?

873
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,159
She's married.

874
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,730
They usually are.

875
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:16,533
That's what happens on an
all-women circuit, Barry.

876
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:19,602
Licentiousness. Immorality.

877
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,604
Sin.

878
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,207
Really? Because she shouldn't
be allowed on tour.

879
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,142
On the contrary.

880
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:28,144
Well, isn't she ashamed
of herself?

881
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:31,281
She is ashamed.
That's exactly what she is.

882
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:33,149
And her game's
gonna fall to pieces.

888
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,777
We have to stop
fooling around.

889
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:04,247
I wasn't fooling around.
I was dead serious.

890

Listen.

891
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,650
Larry doesn't even
come on tour with me,

892
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,586
because I can't have
the distraction.

893
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:12,255
I have to focus on my game
a hundred percent.

894
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,591
I promise not to distract you.

895
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,793
But you do distract me.

896

I'm good with my hands.

901
00:43:32,344 --> 00:43:35,144
I don't like being
told what to do.

00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:38,615

We don't have to do anything
you don't want to do. Okay?

Barry, how you doing?
Been a long time.
How are you?

927
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,981
What do you want?

928
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,450

And if you don't like
what I have to say,

930
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:22,919
you'll never hear
from me again.

931
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,787
Is that a promise?
Let him in.

932
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,322
Hey, Margaret,
how are you?

933
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:28,925
No one's getting
a lot of sleep around here.

934
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:30,793
Oh, it's good! It's good.

935
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,462
Who's this?
That's Daniel.

936
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:34,197
Daniel! Do you mind?

937
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,798
May I?
Yeah.

938
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,469
Oh, Daniel, come here, you.
Oh, you're so big!

939
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:42,071
Oh, Daniel, hello!

940
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:45,274
Bobby's gotcha.
Bobby's gotcha.

941
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:48,344
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, look at you.

942
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:51,214
Oh, Margaret, he is lovely.

943
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:53,750
Hi! Do any of the other girls
have kids?

944
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,351
Nope, just me.

945
00:45:55,353 --> 00:46:00,423
That has got to be tough.
Tough on your mom.

946
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,225
Playing all day
and then taking care

947
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:04,060
of you at night. Oh, boy!

948
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:05,862
That's got to be...
And all the traveling?

949
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:07,230
You know what?
You need a nanny.

950
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,232
A nanny. (scoffs)
You know how much they cost?

951
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,100
That's exactly why I'm here.

952
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,903
Because I think $35,000 would
buy you a lot of nanny.

953
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,438
What is your game,
Bobby Riggs?

954
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,773
A match. You versus me.

955
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:19,008
Two out of three sets.
$35,000.

956
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,511
(chuckles)

957
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:23,246
Well... why me?

958
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,114
Why you?
Because you're the best.

959
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,883
Billie Jean has been
on me to play her,

960
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:28,084
but you know what she's like.

961
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:32,054
And besides, I always say
if you're gonna play...

962
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:34,190
...play the number one.

963
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:36,058
Billie Jean's number one.

964
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,528
Not if you beat her tomorrow.

965
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,330
Isn't that right?
Is your mom gonna beat her?

966
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,803
TED: 40 down.
"Lumberjack's tool."

967
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,538
Four letters.

968
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,872
Anything?

969
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:51,140
Oh, my.
What?

970
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,475
It's Larry.
Hmm?

971
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,343
Larry King.

972
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,813
Oh.

973
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,115
Oh.

974
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:01,184
I think I'd better make
a phone call.

975
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:09,592
(ringing)

976
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,496
(grunts)

977
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,231
Hello?

978
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:18,167
<i>Ted here, darling.</i>
<i>A petite heads up.</i>

979
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,303
<i>Larry is in the building.</i>

980
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,904
Shit.
<i>Be careful.</i>

981
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:23,239
Okay. Thanks.

982
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,242
Hey. (laughs)
Oh.

983
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,444
Going up?
Thanks.

984
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,980
Yeah. 31.

985
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:32,048
Me, too.

986
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,863
Starting early.

987
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,099
Oh, well, you know
what they say...

988
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:51,934
it's never too early
for champagne.

989
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,337
(chuckles) My kinda girl.

990
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:55,605
You here for the tennis?

991
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:57,206
I sure am.

992
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,541
Me, too.

993
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,077
I think Billie Jean's
gonna take it.

994
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,013
Oh, are you a fan?

995
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,216
You could say that.

996
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,585
(elevator bell dings)

997
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:11,554
After you.

998
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,033
LARRY: Well, see you around.

999
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:25,167
MARILYN: Maybe.

1000
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,044
Hi! Oh.

1001
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:36,112
Hi.

1002
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:38,180
Hi!
Hi, honey.

1003
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,151
Oh, this is Marilyn.

1004
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,453
Oh.

1005
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,122
Larry.
Oh, hi, hi.

1006
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,324
Marilyn is the, the...

1007
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:49,558
The hairdresser around here.

1008
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,395
And...Larry is...the...

1009
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:53,629
The husband around here.

1010
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:55,197
The husband around here.

1011
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,533
Peaches wants me
to give her a blow dry.

1012
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:58,601
Great.

1013
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,203
LARRY: Marilyn!
Uh-huh?

1014
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:03,472
Was the ice
for Billie Jean's knees?

1015
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,410
Yeah.

1016
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:09,345
Yeah, I'll get that. Thanks.
Bye.

1017
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:11,414
LARRY: Bye.

1018
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,023
Here. Let me.

1019
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,025
Okay.

1020
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:00,763
(clears throat)

1021
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,134
(clears throat)

1022
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:07,603
The roads were clear,
so I made good time.

1023
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:13,776
I should've called ahead,

1024
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:16,145
letting you know
that I was coming.

1025
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,091
Leg up.

1026
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:41,370
Switch.

1027
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,439
BILLIE JEAN: Here.

1028
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,481
Uh...

1029
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,059
I'm gonna get another room.

1030
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:09,565
I've got phone calls to make,

1031
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,801
and you need to rest
for the finals.

1032
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,077
(door closes)

1033
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:15,865
UMPIRE:
<i>Point to Mrs. Court. Love-15.</i>

1034
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,435
(exhales)

1035
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,616
UMPIRE: <i>Love-30.</i>

1036
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:35,551
Jesus Christ, Billie.

1037
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,555
Come on, dumby. Come on.

1038
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:55,704
UMPIRE: <i>Love-40. Match point.</i>
<i>(crowd cheers)</i>

1039
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:14,657
UMPIRE: <i>Game, set and match</i>
<i>to Mrs. Court.</i>

1040
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,349
BILLIE JEAN: That was bad.

1041
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,353
You don't seem yourself.

1042
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,895
I was thinking of
heading home.

1043
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,433
Really?

1044
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,438
There's lots to do
from there and...

1045
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,973
...I was thinking...

1046
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:07,843
...I could give you some space
and let you clear your head.

1047
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,812
BILLIE JEAN: Mmm-hmm.

1048
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,587
Talk to you soon.
Yeah.

1049
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,795
MARILYN: Man.

1050
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:29,598
Damn.

1051
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,401
Hi.

1052
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:33,936
Hi.

1053
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,273
Have you got a cigarette?

1054
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:38,340
Nope.

1055
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,411
Billie Jean know you smoke?

1056
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:45,414
Uh... I guess not.

1057
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:47,683
She's not a fan.

1058
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:49,785
Well, I won't tell
if you won't.

1059
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:54,490
Secrets, huh? There's a lot
of those going around.

1060
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,894
Marilyn, you know
how all this gets paid for?

1061
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:04,900
...the prize money,
rackets, hotels, flights...

1062
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,835
...the food, everything?

1063
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:10,806
And with sponsorship,
that would go away
in a heartbeat

1064
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,575
if certain things
were to be made public.

1065
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,380
I only have Billie Jean's
best interests at heart.

1066
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,983
Look.

1067
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,484
You seem like
a sweet girl and...

1068
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,919
Don't condescend to me.
(sighs)

1069
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,388
Please.

1070
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,725
You know,
I'm not the competition.

1071
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:32,461
I'm just her husband,
and you're...

1072
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:33,662
(exhales)

1073
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,597
...you're just a phase.

1074
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,801
We're both just sideshows.

1075
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:40,936
Tennis is her true love.

1076
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:44,506
And if you get between her
and the game, you'll be gone.

1077
00:55:58,421 --> 00:55:59,488
(door opens)

1078
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,765
Met Bobby Riggs last night.

1079
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:10,899
Funny man.

1080
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,001
BILLIE JEAN:
Tell me you didn't.

1081
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,636
Didn't what?

1082
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:19,041
He just wants to play
an exhibition match is all.

1083
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,510
Now that I'm officially
number one.

1084
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:25,381
It's not a tennis match,
Margaret. You do know that.

1085
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,849
What do you mean?

1086
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:29,651
He tried that exhibition
match line on me.

1087
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:32,721
Oh. And I suppose
you turned him down?

1088
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,392
You think I want to join
the Bobby Riggs circus?

1089
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:39,795
He wants to make himself look
great and women look stupid.

1090
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:42,798
It's not a match.
It's a show.

1091
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,468
I can understand why you might
not want to play him, but...

1092
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,936
...I've got nothing to hide.

1093
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,981
(door closes)

1094
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,485
TED: Mind those seams
when taking that off.

1095
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,154
She's gonna play Bobby Riggs.

1096
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:09,491
The Arm versus The Mouth.
I know where my money's going.

1097
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:13,028
What if she loses, Ted?
What if she blows it?

1098
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,930
He's never gonna let it go.

1099
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,533
He's gonna make women's tennis
look like a laughingstock.

1100
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:20,202
Calm yourself,
Madame Superstar.

1101
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:21,937
Margaret is playing
better than ever,

1102
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,739
and I don't need
to remind you.

1103
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,643
And strictly <i>entre nous...</i>

1104
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:30,012
...we've had to make some
adjustments in the bicep area.

1105
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:31,680
Haven't we, Henry?

1106
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:33,649
About an inch and a half.

1107
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:35,184
(Ted chuckles)

1108
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:36,618
I'm just glad
you're not playing him.

1109
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,520
Not a chance.

1110
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,125
Best be careful.

1111
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:44,460
What do you mean?

1112
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:49,064
The world isn't always
a forgiving place, my dear.

1113
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,072
How are you so free
with yourself?

1114
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,776
Seems like you just do
whatever you want.

1115
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:03,679
I don't do whatever I want.

1116
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:06,482
I pay taxes,
visit the dentist.

1117
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:08,016
You know what I mean.

1118
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,753
I'm one of eight kids.

1119
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:13,622
So...

1120
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:16,024
...no one noticed what I did.

1121
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:20,596
because I would've shocked
the hell out of all of 'em.

1122
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:21,930
(both chuckling)

1123
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,701
I don't know.

1124
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,872
I live... a private life...

1125
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:35,511
...I guess I never think that
people will care what I do.

1126
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,120
God, I think everyone
cares what I do.

1127
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,725
I'm gonna let them all down.

1128
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,863
When I was a kid,
I played at this tennis club.

1129
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,200
I was...

1130
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,135
...twelve.

1131
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,674
It was team photo time,
which is a very big deal.

1132
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:06,742
(both chuckle)

1133
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,912
And my mom made me these...

1134
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:11,113
...white tennis shorts,

1135
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:13,248
because we couldn't afford
a tennis dress.

1136
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,684
And...

1137
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,020
...the man that ran it,

1138
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:19,788
we were all lined up
to take the photo

1139
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,757
and he pointed at me
and he said...

1140
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:24,326
..."That little girl
cannot be in the photo...

1141
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:26,728
..."because she's not
wearing a tennis dress."

1142
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:28,997
That must've crushed you.

1143
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:30,132
No.

1144
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,101
I just thought...

1145
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,237
...that does it.

1146
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:40,175
I'm gonna be the best.

1147
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:43,845
That way I can really...
change things.

1148
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,716
That way I have a voice.

1149
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,120
You have a voice.

1150
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,274
Dad?
Larry!

1151
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:15,143
Sorry I can't stay long.
I'm training.

1152
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:16,378
What the hell are you wearing?

1153
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,280
Ah. It's a sauna suit.

1154
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,982
It's killing me,
but every time I breathe,

1155
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,249
I lose a pound.

1156
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:23,251
You hear the news?
Bobby's back!

1157
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:24,620
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

1158
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:25,988
You heard, huh?
Isn't it great?

1159
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,289
Is it really happening?

1160
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,791
Oh, it's happening.
It is happening! Say...

1161

You want to help?
What with?

1162

With training, with support.

1163

1166
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:44,673
Why you?
You're my son, that's why.

Oh.

<i>Let's face it, in business,</i>

1268
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:35,370
<i>politics, sports,</i>
<i>you name it...</i>

1269
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:36,972
<i>...whatever they like</i>
<i>to think,</i>

1270
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:38,640
<i>at the very top</i>
<i>it's a man's game.</i>

1271
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:40,308
PEACHES: I can't believe this.

1272
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:43,612
I know what'll cheer her up.

1273
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,882
I'll be right back.
Okay, darling.

1274
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,617
KRAMER:
<i>We're at match point here.</i>

1275
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:00,929
(crowd cheers)

1276
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:06,568
HANK RUPP: <i>There it is.</i>
<i>Bobby Riggs wins 6-2, 6-1.</i>

1277
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,036
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

1278
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,938
<i>A rather easy triumph against</i>

1279
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,073
<i>motherhood</i>
<i>and women's liberation.</i>

1280
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,411
That was a massacre.

1281
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,680
BOBBY:
<i>Well, thank you very much.</i>

1282
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:20,148
This is my son, Larry.

1283
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,183
Lousy tennis player,
great guy.

1284
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:24,085
So, now officially Bobby Riggs

1285
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,154
is the number one
ladies player in the world...

1286
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:27,289
...and any ladies out there

1287
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:28,356
want to challenge
for the crown,

1288
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:30,058
<i>you know where to find me.</i>

1289
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,559
<i>And since I have just</i>
<i>proven here today,</i>

1290
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:33,194
<i>beyond a shadow of a doubt...</i>

1291
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:34,629
<i>...that men are</i>
<i>the superior animal,</i>

1292
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:36,331
<i>tell you want I'm gonna do:</i>

1293
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,066
<i>I am gonna triple the bet!</i>

1294
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:41,069
<i>$100,000 to any woman</i>
<i>who can beat Bobby Riggs.</i>

1295
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:43,171
<i>The question I ask myself is,</i>
<i>is she out there,</i>

1296
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:46,007
<i>and does she have the nerve?</i>

1297
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,449
PEACHES: What got into her?

1298
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,184
Fate, sweetie.

1299
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,653
Coming at her
like a runaway train.

1300
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,693
Oh... darling.

1301
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,198
REPORTER:
<i>And in today's much publicized</i>

1302
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,733
<i>tennis face-off between...</i>

1303
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:15,236
<i>and Woman's No. 1</i>
<i>Margaret Court...</i>

1304
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:17,138
<i>...the self-styled</i>
<i>"male chauvinist pig"</i>

1305
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,108

<i>in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1...</i>

1306
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,010
<i>...in what the press</i>
<i>has dubbed</i>

1307
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:23,645
<i>"The Mother's Day Massac..."</i>

1308
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:27,048
Oh, for goodness sakes.
It was just a tennis match.

1309
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,353
The Women's No. 1
can't beat a 55-year-old.

1310
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:33,488
Are you kidding me?

1311
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,756
He's backed me
into a corner now.

1312
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:36,257
Then don't play him.

1313
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:38,360
Who else is gonna
beat him, Marilyn?

1314
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:40,095
I don't have a choice.

1315
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,364
No, you always have a choice.

1316
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:44,032
You don't get it.

1317
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,202
You don't get it. (snorts)

1318
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,441
I don't know how to help you.

1319
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,214
Do you even want me here?

1320
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:06,488
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I need to think.

1321
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:25,407
(tennis balls bouncing
then hitting the fence)

1322
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:17,792
(phone ringing)

1323
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,464
Hello?

1324
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:24,365
BILLIE JEAN: <i>Larry.</i>

1325
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:27,302
Oh. I was wondering
when you were gonna call.

1326
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,736
(groans)

1327
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,307
It was a travesty.

1328
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,309
So?

1329
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,845
Call the bozo.

1330
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,280
Tell him it's on.

1331
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:41,783
But nothing gets agreed on

1332
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:43,651
without my approval,
all right?

1333
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:48,223
Venue, date,
TV rights, everything.

1334
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:50,525
What balls we use.

1335
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:53,661
I know Bobby. He'll be making
deals on his deals by now.

1336
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:55,663
I'll call him first thing
in the morning.

1337
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:58,800
No, now.
He calls me at midnight.

1338
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,702
If we're gonna go, let's go.

1339
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:04,572
Okay.

1340
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,913
You know something?

1341
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:13,581
This can be great.

1342
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,518
<i>Really, really great.</i>

1343
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,187
<i>And not just</i>
<i>for women's tennis, you know?</i>

1344
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,724
As long as I win.

1345
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:28,396
If there's one thing
that I know about you...

1346
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:32,200
...it's that this is one match
you are gonna win.

1347
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,372
You're a good man, Larry.

1348
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:39,774
<i>You're a good woman.</i>

1349
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,611
I wish that were true.

1350
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:48,883
Let's focus on the match.
Everything else can wait.

1351
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:53,888
Good night.

1352
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,273
Marilyn?

1353
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,994
Honey! I am back on top,

1354
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:35,730
I've never felt better,
I beat Margaret Court...

1355
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:37,865
...and now I am playing
Billie Jean King

1356
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:40,501
for $100,000.
What about that?

1357
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:41,769
And...

1358
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:44,639
...it's going to be
on ABC, primetime.

1359
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:46,641
Well, you have some
nerve using all that

1360
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:49,244
"male chauvinist pig"
nonsense.

1361
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:50,478
Who do you think's
been bankrolling

1362
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,381
you all these years?
Me. A woman.

1363
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:55,016
You know something?
You are absolutely right,

1364
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:56,884
and I am gonna pay you back.

1365
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:58,753
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1366
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,421
I don't want it back.

1367
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,259
You want me back?

1368
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:05,326
(Priscilla chuckles)

1369
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,034
So...

1370
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:15,803
...I'm gonna be on the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine.

1371
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:18,606
and never got
the cover of <i>Time.</i>

1372
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,644
So after Billie Jean,
there's an offer on the table

1373
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:24,812
for a million dollars
to play Chrissie Evert.

1374
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:26,481
A million dollars, huh!

1375
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,583
Imagine that?

1376
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,019
Million dollars.

1377
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:33,655
Phew.

1378
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,325
(sighs)

1379
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,727
I'll tell you something.

1380
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,970
It's a pretty scary trip
I'm taking right here...

1381
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:50,505
...and, uh...

1382
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,608
...well, I was, um...

1383
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:57,612
Well, I need you, honey.

1384
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,986
I feel like we've been
through this before.

1385
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:08,056
No, I'm a changed man.
Ask the shrink.

1386
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,325
I did.

1387
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:11,592
What did he say?

1388
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:14,529
Nothing.
He just gave me 30 bucks.

1389
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:16,864
The money that he owed you

1390
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:18,733
from your last game
of blackjack.

1391
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:19,801
(groans)

1392
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,338
He was a terrible player.
(chuckles)

1393
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,906
Christ.
(both laughing)

1394
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,044
Bobby, I love you.

1395
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,881
Well, I love you, too.

1396
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:37,018
I love how
you make me laugh.

1397
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:40,455
I love your crazy ideas
and all your schemes.

1398
01:12:40,457 --> 01:12:43,825
And the way you walk into
a room and you fill it up.

1399
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,728
I love the way
you make me feel.

1400
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,830
I miss that a lot.

1401
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,866
But...

1402
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:54,502
...I need a husband.

1403
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:57,372
I need someone
who is steady.

1404
01:12:57,374 --> 01:12:59,807
Someone that I can rely on.

1405
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:01,676
And that is not you.

1406
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,978
And that's okay.

1407
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,647
It is more than okay.

1408
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:08,883
It is wonderful,
because that...

1409
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,685
...is who you are.

1410
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:14,956
I just can't be
with that person anymore.

1411
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,425
I just can't.

1412
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,995
I'm so sorry.

1413
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:22,563
No.

1414
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

1415
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:29,537
(exhales)

1416
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:30,738
Okay.

1417
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,408
All right.

1418
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:34,542
Okay.

1419
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:35,743
Good-bye.

1420
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:46,888
(door closes)

1421
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:01,803
(line ringing)

1422
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,005
(clears throat)

1423
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,843
Hey, Jimmy! Bobby here.
How are you, my friend?

1424
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:10,077
Never better, never better.

1425
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,146
Listen, what are the odds
right now?

1426
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:16,684
Okay, put 15 grand
on me to win.

1427
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:19,086
That's right, buddy,
15 big ones.

1428
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:22,490
Okay. Great. Thank you, sir.

<i>It was announced today.</i>

1434
01:14:35,605 --> 01:14:36,838
<i>Women's tennis champion</i>

1435
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,006
<i>Miss Billie Jean King,</i>
<i>who is 29...</i>

1436
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:42,477
<i>...accepted the challenge</i>

<i>and place still to be decided.</i>

1439
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:47,114
<i>Miss King said</i>
<i>she will not play</i>

1440

<i>for the money but,</i>
<i>in her words...</i>

1441
01:14:48,852 --> 01:14:50,618

1442

<i>"and women's lib back</i>

1443
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:55,890
<i>Riggs said he issued</i>
<i>the challenge because...</i>

1444
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:57,625
<i>..."I want to prove</i>

1445
01:14:57,627 --> 01:14:59,727
<i>"and they don't belong</i>

1446
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,796
Wow.

1447
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,033
BOBBY: Put her there.
BILLIE JEAN: All right, great.

1448
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:07,101
(chuckles)

1449
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:12,073
Now, don't get me wrong,
I love women...

1450
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:14,008
In the bedroom
and in the kitchen.

1451
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,810
But these days,
they want to be everywhere!

1452
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:17,778
They want to be
doing everything!

1453
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,514
Where is it gonna end?

1454
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:22,016
Pretty soon us fellas won't be
able to go to a ballgame,

1455
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,618
we won't be able
to go fishing.

1456
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:26,053
We won't be able to stop
and have a drink after work.

1457
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:28,022
And that's what this whole
women's lib thing is about.

1458
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,624
And it's got to stop.

1459
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:31,292
And Bobby Riggs
is the man to stop it.

1460
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:34,095
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Custer's Last Stand.

1461
01:15:34,097 --> 01:15:37,098
This is the Lobber
versus the Libber!

1462
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,165
(laughter)

1463
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,569
Take that. Right?

1464
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,038
Keep talking, Bobby.

1465
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,306
The more nonsense you spout,

1466
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:46,841
the worse it will be
when you lose.

1467
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,176
Well, I'm the ladies
number one,

1468
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:51,312
I'm the champ.
Why would I lose?

1469
01:15:51,314 --> 01:15:53,214
Because dinosaurs
can't play tennis.

1470
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:55,082
(all exclaim)

1471
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:57,618
I'm gonna put the "show"
back in "chauvinism."

BOBBY: Gentlemen.

1473
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,826
What a beautiful day
to play tennis, huh?

1474
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:08,095
All right, right here.
Right down the pike.

1475

I feel better than ever.

It's the A to Z

1537
01:19:02,839 --> 01:19:06,373
Vitamins, protein pills,
some fat busters,

Oh, would you just relax?
Come on.

what I did to Margaret,

1546
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:27,461

1551
01:19:39,509 --> 01:19:42,209
There's no comparison.
Margaret folds.

1552

You know Billie.
She loves pressure.

1553

Yeah, but her game's
off right now.

<i>in her third-round match</i>

1578
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:48,075
<i>against Julie Heldman.</i>

1579
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:49,910
<i>Looking tired and dispirited,</i>

1580
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:52,446
<i>Mrs. King left the court</i>
<i>after only one set.</i>

1581
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:53,948
<i>Speculation mounts</i>
<i>that pressure from</i>

1582
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,583
<i>the upcoming match</i>
<i>against Bobby Riggs...</i>

1583
01:20:55,585 --> 01:20:57,351
<i>...is taking its toll.</i>

1584
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,554
Taking its toll, baby!
I knew it!

1585
01:21:00,556 --> 01:21:03,357
She's crumbling,
and I'm hanging out
by the pool!

1586
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,494
Are you scamming me
to get more practice time?

1587
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:11,632
I'm sick.

1588
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:13,300
GLADYS: Let me see that.

1589
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,573
Well, you're not dying.

1590
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:21,442
Try to sound pleased.

1591
01:21:21,444 --> 01:21:24,445
Look, I love
the other girls, but...

1592
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:26,914
...you're the draw.
You're my giant.

1593
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:29,516
I'm a giant with the flu.
I don't know what to say.

1594
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:35,456
Take two weeks off!

1595
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:38,192
Go somewhere,
do what you need to do, okay?

1596
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:39,360
But you have a tournament

1597
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:40,661
the day after that
match with Riggs...

1598
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:42,329
...and, win or lose,
you're gonna be there.

1599
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,531
Okay, thank you.

1600
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:46,500
And just so you know,
if you lose,

1601
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:48,469
I will never forgive you.

1602
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,209
(door closes)

1603
01:21:55,211 --> 01:21:57,945
Oh, Jesus, Larry.

1604
01:21:57,947 --> 01:22:01,081
It's too much. No wonder
my body's falling apart.

1605
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:13,093
Okay, if there's somebody
that you need...

1606
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:14,561
...that you want me
to call...

1607
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,431
...I can call her.

1608
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,237
No, there's nobody.

1609
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,174
REPORTER: <i>And if you mistake</i>
<i>him for a fool,</i>

1610
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:29,310
<i>you may end up</i>
<i>looking like one yourself.</i>

1611
01:22:29,312 --> 01:22:31,979

1615
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:44,325

1616
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:47,461
<i>Has she choked?</i>
<i>Has she fled the country?</i>

1617
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:51,265

<i>with a virus, nobody...</i>

1618
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:54,268
<i>...has seen even the ghost</i>
<i>of Billie Jean King.</i>

1619
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:00,541
Hey! Where are you going?

1620
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:02,209
Where is she going?

1621
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,478
My guess?

1622
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:07,414
Houston.

1623
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,454
ROONE: She does know
what time this is...

1624
01:23:13,456 --> 01:23:15,222
Yes, I told you.

1625
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,624
Has she pulled out?

1626
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:19,293
She was ill.

1627
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:20,361
(elevator bell dings)

1628
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,698
Sorry I'm late, gentlemen.

1629
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,700
Hey, honey, how's the flu?

1630
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,635
LARRY: Flu?
I heard you were ill.

1631
01:23:28,637 --> 01:23:31,438
No. Don't believe everything
you read in the papers, Bobby.

1632
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,707
But thank you for the flowers.
I gave 'em to Rosie.

1633
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:35,309
And I put 'em
in the trash.

1634
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:37,511
Oh.
(men chuckling)

1635
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:38,712
Billie Jean.

1636
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:40,514
Jack.

1637
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:44,585
(chuckles)
What are you doing here?

1638
01:23:44,587 --> 01:23:47,054
Jack's my choice
of commentator for ABC.

1639
01:23:47,056 --> 01:23:48,122
BILLIE JEAN: Jack?

1640
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,657
Oh, that won't work.

1641
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:52,359
Now, Billie Jean,
no one's complaining

1642
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:54,094
about Rosie doing
the play-by-play.

1643
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:55,629
BILLIE JEAN:
Well, Rosie hasn't continually

1644
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:57,331
tried to dismantle
women's tennis.

1645
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:58,599
(Kramer chuckles)

1646
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:01,135
You overstate
my influence, Billie Jean.

1647
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:04,204
You blackballed us
from the USLTA, Jack.

1648
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:06,273
We did you a favor.
Lousy organization.

1649
01:24:06,275 --> 01:24:07,608
Jack's my choice.

1650
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,743
Sure make for
a punchy commentator.

1651
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:16,083
I won't play.

1652
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:19,253
Look, I just spent $750,000
on this event.

1653
01:24:19,255 --> 01:24:21,188
You can't pull out
the day before the match!

1654
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,424
Says who?

1655
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:25,159
KRAMER: Say...

1656
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:28,295
...I wonder if we could...

1657
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:30,497
...have a word,
just the two of us.

1658
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,244
Billie Jean...

1659
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:45,813
...I know we've had
our differences,

1660
01:24:45,815 --> 01:24:49,149
but that's behind us.

1661
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:51,251
This is between you
and Bobby now.

1662
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,319
Bobby?

1663
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:55,656
Oh, Bobby's a clown.

1664
01:24:55,658 --> 01:24:57,391
This whole thing's
an act for him, Jack.

1665
01:24:57,393 --> 01:24:59,326
You know that.

1666
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:02,396
With you it's different.
It's for real.

1667
01:25:02,398 --> 01:25:03,730
What do you mean?

1668
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:08,435
I don't think
you respect women.

1669
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,604
(chuckles)

1670
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,739
I've been happily married
for 32 years.

1671
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:15,742
No, I think you like us in
the kitchen and the bedroom.

1672
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:18,345
I think you are a gentleman,
and I mean that.

1673
01:25:18,347 --> 01:25:19,746
Thank you.
I'll take my compliments

1674
01:25:19,748 --> 01:25:21,748
where I can from you.

1675
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,551
It's when we dare
to want a little bit more.

1676
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,821
Just a little bit
of what you've got.

1677
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:30,824
That's what you can't stand.

1678
01:25:30,826 --> 01:25:32,226
Oh. Really?

1679
01:25:32,228 --> 01:25:33,827
Yeah.

1680
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:35,496
And to have you telling
the American public

1681
01:25:35,498 --> 01:25:37,498
what to read
into every serve?

1682
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:39,500
Every point?

1683
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:45,239
If you're commentating,
I'm not playing.

1684
01:25:45,241 --> 01:25:46,373
How do you think
that's gonna make

1685
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:48,375
the great Billie
Jean King look?

1686
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:52,179
just because she didn't
like the commentator?

1687
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:53,347
I think it's pretty
similar to how

1688
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,782
it'll make the great
Jack Kramer look.

1689
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:57,251
Shutting the whole thing down

1690
01:25:57,253 --> 01:25:59,253
because he didn't
get to participate.

1691
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,790
No. That's not gonna happen.

1692
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:05,726
You're not gonna do this.

1693
01:26:05,728 --> 01:26:08,929
This means too much to you.
You and your Sisterhood.

1694
01:26:08,931 --> 01:26:10,531
You'd never throw it

1695
01:26:10,533 --> 01:26:14,868
Do you remember the last time
you thought I was bluffing?

1696
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:16,870
One dollar.

1697
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:23,544
You know
the difference between

1698
01:26:23,546 --> 01:26:25,679
a good player and a great?

1699
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:29,349
The great players never let
emotion get in the way.

1700
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,418
It messes with their game.

1701
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:43,430
Sorry, Bobby.

1702
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,505
REPORTER: <i>Any last</i>
<i>minute thoughts, Billie Jean?</i>

1703
01:26:51,507 --> 01:26:52,906
<i>Are you going to win?</i>

1704
01:26:52,908 --> 01:26:54,508
Of course she's gonna win.

1705
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:56,443
Against an old guy
like Bobby Riggs, sure.

1706
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:58,979
Let her play Rosewall
or Nastase.

1707
01:26:58,981 --> 01:27:01,448
Men are better.
End of story.

1708
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:02,916
I'm not saying
women are better.

1709
01:27:02,918 --> 01:27:04,451
I've never said that.

1710
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:07,254
I'm saying
we deserve some respect.

1711
01:27:07,256 --> 01:27:09,590
More than Bobby Riggs
or you are giving us.

1712
01:27:09,592 --> 01:27:11,458
Sir, do you have a daughter?

1713
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,994
Or a sister? You sure as heck
have a mother.

1714
01:27:13,996 --> 01:27:15,562
Is your father better
than your mother?

1715
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,397
Just because he's a man?
Do you believe that?

1716
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:18,799
No.

1717
01:27:18,801 --> 01:27:20,267
But that's what
you're saying...

1718
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:21,668
whether you think
you are or not.

1719
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:24,471
If I beat Bobby Riggs,
will you stop saying it?

1720
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:25,739
Okay.

1721
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:27,741
Sir, I'm gonna
hold you to that.

1722
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:29,743
If I see you,
I'm gonna hold you to that.

1723
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:30,877
Thank you.
That's it for today.

1724
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:32,546
We'll see you at the match.

1725
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:19,359
Let's get this show
on the road.

1726
01:28:19,361 --> 01:28:20,661
Here you go, Bobby.

1727
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:28,769
(coughs)

1728
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,642
Dad?
Yeah?

1729
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,711
I'm just gonna
watch it here.

1730
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:43,317
What do you mean?
This is it.
This is the day.

1731
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:44,985
I'm sorry. I'm...

1732
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,354
...I'm not coming.

1733
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:52,459
You don't think I'm gonna
lose, do you, kiddo?

1734
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:53,527
No.

1735
01:28:53,529 --> 01:28:56,930
You'll do great.
You don't need me.

1736
01:28:56,932 --> 01:28:58,465
Good luck, Dad.

1737
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,541
This one's from
Jennifer in Tucson.

1738
01:29:07,543 --> 01:29:10,077
"Good luck, Billie Jean,
we're all rooting for you."

1739
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:11,611
This one's from Annie
from New York.

1740
01:29:11,613 --> 01:29:13,013
"Go, Billie,
we know you're gonna win."

1741
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:15,549
You've lost weight.
I have to take this in.

1742
01:29:15,551 --> 01:29:17,684
We don't have time.
TED AND HENRY: We have time.

1743
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:18,885
How you feeling, honey?

1744
01:29:18,887 --> 01:29:20,354
Do you need anything?
Water?

1745
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:21,655
No, I'm good, thank you.

1746
01:29:21,657 --> 01:29:23,090
Twenty minutes to game time.

1747
01:29:23,092 --> 01:29:25,826
Rosie Casals,
they need you in the studio.

1748
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:28,495
You're gonna kill him.

1749
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:30,964
I'll see you guys in a bit.

1750
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:32,499
Good luck out there.

1751
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:34,901
Now, I have to ask,
do you really intend to

1752
01:29:34,903 --> 01:29:37,437
inflict blue suede shoes...

1753
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:39,840
...on ninety million members
of the viewing public?

1754
01:29:39,842 --> 01:29:42,109
How many?
Oh, my God.
Billie Jean!

1755
01:29:42,111 --> 01:29:43,410
If they're good enough
for Elvis,

1756
01:29:43,412 --> 01:29:44,778
they're good enough for me.

1757
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,381
Well, something's off.

1758
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:49,516
And I think it's the shoes.
It's not the shoes!

1759
01:29:49,518 --> 01:29:50,784
Your hair?

1760
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:59,393
Mom, Dad, this is Marilyn.

1761
01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:00,594
My hairdresser.

1762
01:30:00,596 --> 01:30:03,597
Pleased to meet you.

1763
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:05,732
Well, if there's one thing
I know, it's...

1764
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,702
...never get between a woman
and her hairdresser.

1765
01:30:08,704 --> 01:30:10,404
TED: Very funny. Yes indeed.

1766
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:12,072
DAD: Come on.
Let's find our seats.

1767
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:14,074
Here. I'll take you up there.

1768
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:19,613
Good luck.

1769
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,081
Thank you.

1770
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,783
MOM: Yeah, give 'em heck.

1771
01:30:22,785 --> 01:30:25,085
Billie Jean, I'll be back
to take you to the court.

1772
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:26,153
All right.

1773
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:30,490
Hi.
Hi.

1774
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:36,630
Your hairdresser, huh?

1775
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:40,500
What was I supposed to say?

1776
01:30:40,502 --> 01:30:41,768
No, you're right.

1777
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:44,504
That's why I'm here.

1778
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,776
Come on.

1779
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:53,447
Yeah, just like that.
That looks great.

1780
01:30:53,449 --> 01:30:56,183
Yep, zip her up. Oh, boy!
(chuckles)

1781
01:30:56,185 --> 01:30:58,151
We need the "Sugar Daddy"
facing camera.

1782
01:30:58,153 --> 01:31:00,454
Mmm-hmm.
We got to see that.

1783
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:02,189
Do you want me to hold it
from the stick?

1784
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:04,124
Uh...
Am I gonna hold it that way?

1785
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:06,059
That looks great.

1786
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:08,795
We're trying to prepare
for the match.

1787
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:10,630
So the camera can see it.

1788
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,599
Yeah, up high.
Beautiful.

1789
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:14,935
I'll get it up
nice and high.

1790
01:31:14,937 --> 01:31:17,003
We got it. Thank you.
Have a great match.

1791
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:19,739
BOBBY: Thank you. Thank you,
ladies. See you out there.

1792
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:23,944
See you out there.
Good work.

1793
01:31:23,946 --> 01:31:25,679
SUGAR DADDY GUY:
Do it for the men, Bobby.

1794
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,647
Wow. You good?

1795
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:29,149
Yeah! I'm ready for battle.

1796
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:32,152

We are live in five...

1798

1815
01:32:32,147 --> 01:32:33,747
Is that a priest?

1816
01:32:33,749 --> 01:32:36,082
Yeah. If Bobby wins,
she takes the groom's surname.

1817
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:38,585
But if Billie Jean wins,
the groom takes her name.

1818
01:32:38,587 --> 01:32:42,889
(laughs)
Little flip-flop. Oh, boy.

1819

ROONE: Where's Billie Jean?

1820

TV ANNOUNCER: Can somebody--

1821
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,327
Does anybody know
where she is?

1822
01:32:47,329 --> 01:32:50,030
(sighs) What do you mean,
you lost her?

1823
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:52,632
She's getting a trim.
She'll be right out.

1824
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:54,834
Yeah, like a haircut.

1826
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:14,788
I missed you.

1827

I know.

1828
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:27,200
Uh, ten minutes to game time!

1829
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:33,340
Stay for the match?

1830

Are you sure?
Yes.

<i>Jack Kramer.</i>
<i>The famed tennis promoter.</i>

1836

<i>The famed tennis player</i>
<i>of the past.</i>

1837

<i>We wanted Jack Kramer.</i>

KRAMER: <i>I want to make</i>

<i>When I realized that</i>
<i>I was perhaps a problem...</i>

1885
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:02,415
<i>hustled and promoted...</i>

1886
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:06,286
<i>...ceaselessly and shrewdly</i>
<i>by Bobby Riggs.</i>

1887
01:37:06,288 --> 01:37:11,224
<i>The big act, the big bluster,</i>
<i>the big noise.</i>

1888
01:37:11,226 --> 01:37:13,092
<i>Now he's got</i>
<i>steeper competition</i>

1889
01:37:13,094 --> 01:37:15,094
<i>with Billie Jean King.</i>

1890
01:37:15,096 --> 01:37:18,031
This thing is nuts.

1891
01:37:18,033 --> 01:37:21,234
<i>All right, we're back</i>
<i>on camera and this is our...</i>

1892
01:37:21,236 --> 01:37:23,503
<i>...female expert tonight.</i>
<i>Recognize her?</i>

1893
01:37:23,505 --> 01:37:25,905
<i>Little Rosie Casals.</i>

1894
01:37:25,907 --> 01:37:28,508
<i>Now, you say Billie Jean</i>
<i>will win in three sets?</i>

1895
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:33,847
<i>...and I think what happened</i>
<i>with the Court and Riggs match</i>

1896
01:37:33,849 --> 01:37:35,448
<i>will not happen tonight.</i>

1897
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:37,951
<i>Billie Jean will beat him,</i>
<i>definitely.</i>

1898
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:39,452
Well, I got this
beautiful lollipop

1899
01:37:39,454 --> 01:37:41,087
for Billie Jean.

1900
01:37:41,089 --> 01:37:44,023
I figure she's gonna be
a sucker for my lob.

1901
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:46,492
I got something for you too,
Bobby, actually.

1902
01:37:46,494 --> 01:37:49,095
It's the ultimate gift
for a male chauvinist.

1903
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:51,598
Ugh...

1904
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,366
There you go.

1905
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:54,534
(squealing)

1906
01:37:54,536 --> 01:37:56,035
Oh, that's okay,
that's okay.

1907
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:58,104
Any last words
before the match, Bobby?

1908
01:37:58,106 --> 01:37:59,505
Well, this match
is for all the guys

1909
01:37:59,507 --> 01:38:01,241
around the world
that feel as I do...

1910
01:38:01,243 --> 01:38:03,376
...that the male is king,
the male is supreme.

1911
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:04,477
(men cheering)

1912
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:05,578
Billie Jean?

1913
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,914
I'm done talking.
Let's play.

1914
01:38:07,916 --> 01:38:09,115
Oh!

1915
01:38:09,117 --> 01:38:10,316
Ooh!

1916
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:13,586
(laughing)

1917
01:38:13,588 --> 01:38:15,655
(crowd cheering
and applauding)

1918
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:18,458
(cameras clicking)

1919
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:48,087
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>They have started the match.</i>

1920
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:50,156
<i>Service, Billie Jean.</i>

1921
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:54,027
(crowd exclaims and applauds)

1922
01:38:54,029 --> 01:38:55,428
HOWARD COSELL: <i>Love-15.</i>

1923
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:56,696
Bobby.

1924
01:38:56,698 --> 01:38:58,965
JACK: Make us some money.
That a boy.

1925
01:39:02,236 --> 01:39:04,103
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>This match, of course,</i>

1926
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,572
<i>is going by satellite</i>
<i>all around the world.</i>

1927
01:39:08,976 --> 01:39:11,077
(crowd applauds)

1928
01:39:11,979 --> 01:39:14,314
HOWARD COSELL: <i>15-all.</i>

1929
01:39:14,316 --> 01:39:16,449
<i>And you'll hear the crowd</i>
<i>responding all night</i>

1930
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:19,252
<i>to every point</i>
<i>won by Billie Jean.</i>

1931
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:28,094
(crowd applauds)

1932
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:34,133
Attagirl.

1933
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:38,137
<i>Shouted "Attagirl" right after</i>
<i>Billie hit the winner.</i>

1934
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:40,740
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>he's gonna say "Attagirl".</i>

1935
01:39:40,742 --> 01:39:43,209
He's confident.

1936
01:39:43,211 --> 01:39:45,078
HOWARD COSELL: <i>Not everybody</i>
<i>is for Billie Jean.</i>

1937
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,479
<i>Some are for</i>

1938
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:48,548
<i>the self-proclaimed</i>
<i>male chauvinist.</i>

1939
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:51,551
<i>What he has to lose</i>
<i>if he loses this match!</i>

1940
01:39:51,553 --> 01:39:53,086
ROSIE: <i>He'll have to go back</i>

1941
01:39:53,088 --> 01:39:55,154
<i>to cooking and doing</i>
<i>the housework.</i>

1942
01:39:55,156 --> 01:39:56,356
(crowd cheering)

1943
01:39:56,358 --> 01:39:57,757
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>Game, Billie Jean King,</i>

1944
01:39:57,759 --> 01:40:00,426
<i>and the crowd loves it.</i>

1945
01:40:00,428 --> 01:40:03,162
<i>They're getting ready</i>
<i>to exchange courts.</i>

1946
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:06,366
<i>Billie Jean leads</i>
<i>one game to love.</i>

1947
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:11,571
Bobby, you got to take
that damn jacket off.

1948
01:40:11,573 --> 01:40:13,439
They gave me twenty G's.
I got to keep it on.

1949
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:15,108
I don't care,
you've got to take it off.

1950
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:16,776
(grunts)

1951
01:40:28,656 --> 01:40:32,458
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>Nicely placed by Bobby Riggs.</i>

1952
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,360
ROSIE: <i>I think she's too</i>
<i>tentative at the moment.</i>

1953
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,195
<i>That's really the problem.</i>

1954
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:38,097
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>What is her overall strategy?</i>

1955
01:40:38,099 --> 01:40:39,599
<i>You're so close to her.</i>

1956
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:40,800
<i>Well, psychologically</i>

1957
01:40:40,802 --> 01:40:42,668
<i>she's a better</i>
<i>pressure player.</i>

1958
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:44,637
<i>Billie Jean's basically</i>
<i>like another Bobby Riggs.</i>

1959
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,072
<i>She's a hustler.</i>

1960
01:40:46,074 --> 01:40:47,507
<i>She can take</i>
<i>that type of pressure</i>

1961
01:40:47,509 --> 01:40:49,208
<i>and give the same stuff</i>
<i>back to him.</i>

1962
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:50,410
Still no Riggs.

1963
01:40:50,412 --> 01:40:52,345
Right.

1964
01:40:52,347 --> 01:40:54,414
HOWARD COSELL: <i>We're at 40-15.</i>

1965
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,689
ROSIE: <i>Fun to see the old man</i>
<i>run for that one.</i>

1966
01:41:03,691 --> 01:41:06,359
HOWARD COSELL: <i>If Billie Jean</i>
<i>can keep Bobby running,</i>

1967
01:41:06,361 --> 01:41:09,295
<i>I think she could</i>
<i>wear him down.</i>

1968
01:41:09,297 --> 01:41:13,433
<i>Hence, the jacket begins to be</i>
<i>taken off by Bobby Riggs...</i>

1969
01:41:13,435 --> 01:41:17,370
<i>...and maybe the braggadocio</i>
<i>a little bit reduced.</i>

1970
01:41:17,372 --> 01:41:19,439
<i>A concession to the fact</i>
<i>that Riggs...</i>

1971
01:41:19,441 --> 01:41:23,376
<i>...perhaps knows he's running</i>
<i>into firm competition.</i>

1972
01:41:23,378 --> 01:41:24,777
ROSIE: <i>I think he's gonna</i>
<i>start taking</i>

1973
01:41:24,779 --> 01:41:26,446
<i>some of the vitamin pills.</i>

1974
01:41:26,448 --> 01:41:28,314
<i>He's gonna start needing them.</i>

1975
01:41:35,789 --> 01:41:38,791
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>Game point for Bobby.</i>

1976
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:40,726
GENE SCOTT:
<i>Rosie, she looks tense to me.</i>

1977
01:41:40,728 --> 01:41:42,428
ROSIE: <i>She is tense.</i>
<i>No doubt about that.</i>

1978
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:43,863
<i>This is</i>
<i>a very important match.</i>

1979
01:41:43,865 --> 01:41:46,666
(crowd cheering)

1980
01:41:46,668 --> 01:41:50,169
HOWARD COSELL: <i>And Bobby Riggs</i>
<i>breaks through.</i>

1981
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:53,206
<i>The first perhaps</i>
<i>turning point in...</i>

1982
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,475
<i>...the first set</i>
<i>of this match.</i>

1983
01:41:55,477 --> 01:41:58,411
<i>Bobby Riggs leading</i>
<i>Billie Jean King.</i>

1984
01:41:58,413 --> 01:41:59,679
GENE SCOTT:
<i>He had the pressure on him.</i>

1985
01:41:59,681 --> 01:42:02,215
<i>He responded very well.</i>

1986
01:42:02,217 --> 01:42:04,350
HOWARD COSELL: <i>And Billie Jean</i>
<i>did not respond well</i>

1987
01:42:04,352 --> 01:42:06,619
<i>on that shot.</i>
<i>Advantage to Bobby Riggs.</i>

1988
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:07,753
Attaboy.

1989
01:42:18,766 --> 01:42:22,368
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>Marvelous shot by Bobby...</i>

1990
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:26,372
<i>...and a great quick swing</i>
<i>by Billie Jean.</i>

1991
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:29,642
<i>Billie answering great.</i>
<i>She did what she had to do...</i>

1992
01:42:29,644 --> 01:42:32,245
<i>...and she did it</i>
<i>her way, Gene.</i>

1993
01:42:35,182 --> 01:42:37,316
<i>And a great shot</i>
<i>by Bobby Riggs.</i>

1994
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:52,632
(crowd cheering)

1995
01:42:52,634 --> 01:42:57,270
HOWARD COSELL: <i>And the first</i>
<i>set goes to Billie Jean King.</i>

1996
01:42:57,272 --> 01:42:59,272
<i>Point and set.</i>

1997
01:42:59,274 --> 01:43:01,474
<i>The women in this arena</i>
<i>are standing</i>

1998
01:43:01,476 --> 01:43:04,544
<i>and cheering</i>
<i>for Billie Jean King.</i>

1999
01:43:04,546 --> 01:43:06,546
ROSIE: <i>Bobby doesn't</i>
<i>look very happy.</i>

2000
01:43:06,548 --> 01:43:08,814
<i>He's sort of walking</i>
<i>with his head down.</i>

2001
01:43:08,816 --> 01:43:10,550
<i>I think he's gonna get</i>
<i>a little strategy</i>

2002
01:43:10,552 --> 01:43:12,818
<i>from his coach over there.</i>

2003
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:15,421
GENE SCOTT: <i>They have</i>
<i>a four-minute break, Howard.</i>

2004
01:43:15,423 --> 01:43:17,390
HOWARD COSELL: <i>I suppose</i>
<i>we all expected to have</i>

2005
01:43:17,392 --> 01:43:19,492
<i>some high humor</i>
<i>involved in it.</i>

2006
01:43:19,494 --> 01:43:20,826
<i>Instead, it seems</i>
<i>to have become</i>

2007
01:43:20,828 --> 01:43:23,296
<i>a very, very serious thing,</i>
<i>because...</i>

2008
01:43:23,298 --> 01:43:25,898
<i>...the comedy has gone out</i>
<i>of Bobby Riggs.</i>

2009
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,972
<i>The second game of the second</i>
<i>set has just begun...</i>

2010
01:43:32,974 --> 01:43:36,509
<i>having broken through</i>
<i>Billie Jean King...</i>

2011
01:43:36,511 --> 01:43:40,713
<i>...one game to none</i>
<i>in favor of Bobby Riggs.</i>

2012
01:43:40,715 --> 01:43:43,449
<i>And Billie Jean is seeking</i>
<i>to strike back.</i>

2013
01:43:52,427 --> 01:43:56,929
<i>with that overhand smash,</i>
<i>I'll tell you that.</i>

2014
01:43:56,931 --> 01:43:59,532
GENE SCOTT: <i>Bobby suddenly has</i>
<i>become an underdog, Howard.</i>

2015
01:43:59,534 --> 01:44:01,334
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>Yes, some of them</i>
<i>are cheering for him.</i>

2016
01:44:06,473 --> 01:44:07,607
<i>Beautiful.</i>

2017
01:44:07,609 --> 01:44:09,342
(crowd cheering)

2018
01:44:09,344 --> 01:44:11,811
<i>Billie Jean King...</i>

2019
01:44:11,813 --> 01:44:15,348
<i>...has won the second set,</i>
<i>six games to three.</i>

2020
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:17,883
<i>She leads two sets to love...</i>

2021
01:44:17,885 --> 01:44:21,954
<i>...and it's so far a very</i>
<i>great night for the ladies.</i>

2022
01:44:21,956 --> 01:44:24,757
<i>Bobby Riggs is fighting</i>
<i>for his tennis life.</i>

2023
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:27,026
<i>She's filled</i>
<i>with confidence now.</i>

2024
01:44:27,028 --> 01:44:28,394
ROSIE: <i>Great shot!</i>

2025
01:44:28,396 --> 01:44:29,962
HOWARD COSELL: <i>Marvelous shot!</i>

2026
01:44:29,964 --> 01:44:32,431
<i>Bobby trails</i>
<i>four games to two.</i>

2027
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:34,834
<i>No question about it,</i>
<i>Billie Jean has been</i>

2028
01:44:34,836 --> 01:44:37,036
<i>the aggressor in this match.</i>

2029
01:44:37,038 --> 01:44:39,839
<i>a little problem</i>
<i>with his hand.</i>

2030
01:44:39,841 --> 01:44:41,507
<i>He keeps pulling</i>
<i>on his fingers,</i>

<i>he's getting a cramp.</i>

2032
01:44:44,312 --> 01:44:45,378
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>He's having the hand</i>

2033
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:46,779
<i>and the arm looked at.</i>

2034
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:47,913
ROSIE: <i>Is this an injury then?</i>

2035
01:44:47,915 --> 01:44:49,448
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>This is an injury.</i>

2036
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:51,784
<i>Five minutes delay</i>
<i>for an injury.</i>

2037
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:54,320
ROSIE: <i>I knew it would come</i>
<i>to this. I knew...</i>

2038
01:44:54,322 --> 01:44:56,722
<i>...Bobby would have</i>
<i>to come down to something.</i>

2039
01:44:56,724 --> 01:45:00,459
HOWARD COSELL: <i>Let me say this</i>
<i>about Bobby Riggs, Rosie.</i>

2040
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:02,795
<i>You've gotten in</i>
<i>all your licks tonight</i>

2041
01:45:02,797 --> 01:45:08,601
<i>And he made a lot of noise</i>
<i>about male chauvinism and...</i>

2042
01:45:08,603 --> 01:45:09,935
<i>...the women belonged</i>
<i>in the kitchen,</i>

2043
01:45:09,937 --> 01:45:11,604
<i>and all the rest.</i>

2044
01:45:11,606 --> 01:45:15,374
<i>But he is 55,</i>
<i>and he's some kind of guy.</i>

2045
01:45:15,376 --> 01:45:16,742
ROSIE: <i>I agree.</i>
<i>But I don't think</i>

2046
01:45:16,744 --> 01:45:20,446
<i>...with somebody</i>
<i>of Billie Jean's caliber.</i>

2047
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:22,948
HOWARD COSELL:
<i>Well, the way it's proving</i>

<i>out at the moment...</i>

2049

<i>...turns out</i>
<i>that you are right,</i>

2050
01:45:26,554 --> 01:45:30,022
<i>if it ends this way.</i>

2051
01:45:30,024 --> 01:45:34,093
<i>Okay, Bobby's ready to serve,</i>
<i>trailing in the third set.</i>

2052
01:45:34,095 --> 01:45:35,961
Here we go, Bobby,
what do you say?

2053
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:40,032
(crowd cheering)
Attaboy!

2054
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:42,568
HOWARD COSELL: <i>15-love.</i>

2055
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:45,971
<i>One of the fans yelling,</i>
<i>"Come on, Bobby baby!"</i>

2056
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:48,908
<i>Bobby wins that point...</i>

2057
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:52,378
<i>...as he starts his fight</i>
<i>to break through Billie Jean.</i>

2058
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:56,649
<i>Bobby Riggs fights back</i>

2059

GENE SCOTT: <i>Whether he had</i>

2061

ROSIE: <i>Mmm-hmm. Great shot.</i>

2064

ROSIE: <i>Not bad for an old man.</i>

<i>Walking back, she's walking</i>

2071
