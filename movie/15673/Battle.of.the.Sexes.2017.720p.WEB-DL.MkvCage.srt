And paying the women
less than ever

85
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,540
makes it more prestigious.
Uh...

86
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,579
Well, it's simply a question
of what we can afford.

eight times that of the women.

an eighth of the crowd?

For one thing,

103
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,582
the men have families
that they have to support.

- And stronger.
- Fact.

111

And more competitive.

I'm sorry.
It's not going to happen.

heartbroken if he found out.

728

This whole thing's
an act for him, Jack.

Yeah.

If you're commentating,
I'm not playing.

like the commentator?

1763
01:25:52,357 --> 01:25:53,522
I think it's pretty
similar to how

1764
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:56,157
it'll make the great
Jack Kramer look.

1765

get to participate.

One dollar.

1774

the difference between

a good player and a great?

The great players never let
