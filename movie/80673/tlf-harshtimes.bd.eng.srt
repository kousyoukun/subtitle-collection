1
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,700
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Heads up!

2
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,139
Man down! Cease fire!

3
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,547
(echoes):
Stupid motherfucker!

4
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:34,192
(speaking Spanish)

5
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,433
(speaks Spanish)

6
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,355
Si.

7
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,213
What's up, Sylvia?

8
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:46,116
Cute little outfit.

9
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,747
You look nice.

10
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,779
Mike's in
the bedroom.

11
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:49,813
Yeah?

12
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:56,788
Man, I said
you look nice.

13
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:59,596
I have a court
appearance, Jim.

14
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,728
Well, you just
give 'em hell.

15
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:06,605
Hey.

16
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,132
Hey.

17
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,202
Spiffy duds, huh?

18
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:13,512
You look like
a gift-wrapped turd.

19
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:15,346
Now please leave me alone.
I have to concentrate.

20
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,181
I have two filings
and a deposition today.

21
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,811
Play nice, kids.

22
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:21,878
What up, dog?

23
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,915
- Nothing. Just got back.
- Cool. Cool.

24
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,483
How was Mexico, dog?

25
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:27,825
Oh, it was a dream, man.

26
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:30,964
- Loving my woman.
- Right.

27
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,693
That's it.
I'm out of here.

28
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:35,498
Those are copies
of your resume.

29
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:36,629
Pass them out like candy.

30
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:38,071
'Cause I can always
print up more.

31
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:39,869
And just call me
if anything happens, okay?

32
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,675
And no drinking.

33
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,240
Come on, baby, be cool.

34
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,474
Honey, I'm serious.

35
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,608
No drinking. Okay?

36
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,948
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

37
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:55,116
Good luck.

38
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,424
Your suit's fine, okay?

39
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:06,062
Dude, she called me
a gift-wrapped turd.

40
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:08,666
Don't be fucking
with her, dude.

41
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:10,467
She's pissed.

42
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:12,030
Why is she on
the warpath? Dog...

43
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:15,109
I didn't look for work
yesterday, dude.

44
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:17,907
Sold some of her CDs,
bought a couple of 40s

45
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:19,709
and a pack of GPCs.

46
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:20,942
Caught a buzz
and watched

47
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:22,916
my Chicago vs. Lakers tapes.

48
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:25,146
(laughs):
That's on you, homie.

49
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:27,417
We didn't even
hang yesterday.

50
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,946
I was out of the country.

51
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,925
So? My old lady still
thinks it's your fault.

52
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,187
Huh? Huh? Hmm?

53
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:34,195
Come on, dude, let's get
the fuck out of here

54
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,389
and find my ass
some employment.

55
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,829
It's cool you driving me around?

56
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,423
Yeah, dude, it's cool.
It's no trouble.

57
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,230
JIM:
Here, asshole.

58
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,569
Breakfast.

59
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:46,403
Oh... ho, ho...

60
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,306
Dog.

61
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:50,243
No pisto for me, dude.

62
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,474
Today's a no-pounding day.
You heard the woman.

63
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:54,277
Good. More for me.

64
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:58,817
Fuck it.

65
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,618
Salud.
Salud.

66
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:06,817
Man, hope they put me in
the next class or I'm fucked.

67
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,591
I can't pay my rent.

68
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,599
Landlady's about to pull
a gauge on my ass.

69
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:14,158
What happened to all that money
you saved in the army, dude?

70
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:17,069
The tax-free shit?

71
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:19,869
Man, bro, this fucking
ride cleaned me out.

72
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:21,603
I guess we drank
up the rest.

73
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:23,338
(chuckles):
Dumb ass.

74
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:26,477
Cops better start
paying you, dude.

75
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,948
You spend enough
fucking time with them.

76
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:30,382
They better start kicking me
down some paychecks, man.

77
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,580
They got me hopping through
hoops, you know?

78
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:34,919
"Come in for a test."
"Come back in two weeks."

79
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,720
Another test, another two weeks.

80
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:38,248
Fuck.

81
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:39,317
Shit gets real,

82
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,623
you be hating life.

83
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,687
Party time will be over.

84
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:45,427
Dude, you don't know how much

85
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,492
I'm looking forward
to this shit.

86
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,868
You know, I'll be super recruit.

87
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,736
I was jumping
out of choppers

88
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:52,967
in the mountains,
taking down

89
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,976
hard motherfuckers,
you know?

90
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:58,774
I'll be laughing my way through
LAPD's reindeer games.

91
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:01,544
Shit, they're
gonna love me.

92
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,881
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna
fucking love them, dude.

93
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,978
Ah, fuck you.

94
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:08,387
I'm going to love my old lady.

95
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,152
I'm gonna marry homegirl.

96
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:12,823
Import her ass.

97
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,385
Oh, come on, man.

98
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:15,828
Dude, what happened
to all the honeys

99
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:17,661
we were gonna pimp
with your badge, dog?

100
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:18,666
You're fucking up the plan.

101
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,100
I've been thinking, you know?

102
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:23,366
Love's about sacrifice.

103
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:26,374
Only true measure of it.

104
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:27,932
What would you do for Sylvia?

105
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:31,605
Get a job.

106
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,512
- Mm...
- Nine to fucking five.

107
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:35,379
Yeah.

108
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:36,907
That's love.

109
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,788
Hey.

110
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:55,735
Good morning.

111
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,830
Good morning.

112
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,270
MIKE:
So when do you officially

113
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,971
hand your ass over to the Man?

114
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:07,880
"Mr. Jim Davis,
we regret to inform...

115
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:12,312
I had two beers, right?

116
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:13,719
Yeah.

117
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,086
Going fucking
blind or something.

118
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,091
Okay, this letter
says, quoting...

119
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:22,392
"no longer eligible
as a police officer candidate."

120
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,991
What the fuck does that mean?

121
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:27,001
Come on, dude.

122
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:29,663
"No longer eligible"? I mean,
what does that sound like?

123
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:30,933
They pulled the plug, dude.

124
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:34,999
No, no...

125
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,600
Why?

126
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:39,910
Oh, man, I'll bet you...

127
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:42,007
I'll bet you it's
'cause I'm white.

128
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,177
I bet it's 'cause
you're a dick.

129
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:45,948
No, no, no, Mike,
you don't understand.

130
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,818
I am fucked.

131
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:49,756
I got to get married.

132
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,818
Okay? INS won't let me
bring Marta across

133
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:55,227
unless I got employment.

134
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,321
I promised her.

135
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:58,161
This fucks up my plan.

136
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,498
This is fucking bullshit, okay?

137
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:02,969
This... these fucking
assholes...

138
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:06,337
These fucking assholes!

139
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:07,966
What the fuck
is their problem, man?!

140
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:13,070
This is fucking typical
cop hate game bullshit!

141
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,980
Yo, yo, fucking
chill, Magilla Gorilla.

142
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,380
I mean you're trippir, dude.

143
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:17,510
Hey, what the fuck

144
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:18,712
are you looking at, asshole?!

145
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:21,484
Fucking dick.

146
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:22,490
Yo, yo,

147
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,583
Jim, Jim...

148
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,958
I'm gonna fucking kick your
teeth down your puke hole!

149
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,494
You fucking want some?

150
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:32,728
Jim, Jim, dude.

151
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:33,996
Kick back, dude.

152
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,629
The fucking light is green.
Get the fuck in the car.

153
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:37,968
Man, fuck.
- You're going to catch

154
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,166
a case doing that shit, man.

155
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:40,401
What the fuck were you doing?

156
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:42,239
Fuck the LAPD, man.

157
00:12:42,277 --> 00:12:44,302
What's up with Pasadena,
Pomona, Santa Ana and all that?

158
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,211
Oh, no, fuck the sticks.

159
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:48,182
L.A. City's the shit.

160
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:49,877
Hey, Sheriff's Department.

161
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:52,512
It's good enough for the INS
and still basically L.A., right?

162
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:56,752
Yeah, Sheriff's Department,
yeah.

163
00:12:56,792 --> 00:13:00,057
They make you work
the jails the first two years

164
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,153
or something.

165
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,493
I could be cracking heads

166
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,328
up at the Honor Ranch.

167
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,665
I'll give 'em a call,
start testing.

168
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:09,829
Yeah.

169
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,270
That's right.

170
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:14,207
Yo, it's just
a minor setback, right?

171
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:16,608
Quit trippir, dude.

172
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,806
Shit.

173
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,975
Hey, you know what
I want to do?

174
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,541
What?

175
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,577
I want to get fucked up.

176
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:28,213
Me, too, man.

177
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:31,089
I got to find a job and placate
my baby, you know.

178
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,923
Sylvia's going
to kick your ass?

179
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,588
Come on, big man,
she'll be cool.

180
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:37,291
Come on.

181
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:40,995
(Korean pop music playing)

182
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,370
- Bye, Nicole.

183
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:55,912
Let me get a couple

00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,942
Sorry, you buy whole pack.

00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:59,817
Be cool, dude.

186
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,083
If I buy a whole pack

187
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:02,783
I'm gonna want
to smoke it.

188
00:14:02,824 --> 00:14:05,088
I just want a couple
of smokes with my beer.

189
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:06,821
City give me $1,500 ticket.

190
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:07,886
No more.

191
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:09,897
(speaking Korean)

192
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:30,981
(speaking Korean)

193
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,314
Asshole.

194
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,117
(speaking Korean)

195
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:55,207
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

196
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:56,608
Oh, shit.

197
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,374
That fucking gangster, man.

198
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:01,211
Homeboy just ran
a six second four-forty.

199
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,945
Damn, the chino looked
fucking pissed, man.

200
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,919
You think we'll be able

201
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:07,751
I hate that shit.

202
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:10,656
Fuckir chino lookir at us

204
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:13,955
We totally look like cops.

205
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:15,690
He said he got fined
for that shit.

206
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,890
He was just being cautious.

207
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:21,232
Well, we got pisto,

208
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,328

Oh, yeah, I mean

00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,140
Yesca?
Mm-hmm.

212
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,839
Bingo.

213
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,178
I need to feel
some reefer madness.

214
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:36,979
You sure you want
to score some bud, dude?

215
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,179
You haven't smoked out
since like forever, man.

216
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,747
I said I want
to get fucked up, man.

217
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,486
Fuck this purity bullshit.

218
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,929
Yeah... fuck purity.

219
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,558
Aw, man, look at this
zero-head, dog.

220
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,693
Stupid-ass cholo.

221
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,033
Look at that.

222
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,404
That dude's slangir, dog.

223
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:02,774
Want to get
a dime?

224
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,974
JIM:
No, I want it all.

225
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:14,053
Go for the stash, man.

226
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:23,389
Whoa, go, go, go.

227
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:25,092
Hey, hey, yo, yo.

Fuck.

230
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:32,367
Outstanding.

231
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,534
Out-fucking-standing.

232
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,975
That shit was slick.

233
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:38,102
That motherfucker
just got schooled.

234
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:40,137
Bitch-ass cholo.

235
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:41,773
- Check this shit out, huh?
- Yeah.

236
00:16:41,816 --> 00:16:44,080
Nice motherfucking haul.
You see that shit, huh?

237
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,917
Mm. It's not laced either.

238
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:47,922
Smell that shit.

239
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:49,082
Smell that motherfucking shit.

240
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,183
We just burned my car.

241
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,921
We go back there,
we're gonna get shot.

242
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:53,926
Yeah, no shit.

243
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:54,927
Man, bust that light.

244
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:56,725
Roll that shit up.

245
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,733
Yeah, yeah, Cool.

246
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,496
Yo, let's drop off
some resumes first.

247
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:01,763
Then we'll smoke out, dude.

248
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:02,929
Some resumes.

249
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:04,130
Yeah.

250
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:06,231
Ah, man, fresh air.

251
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:07,468
Look.

252
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,340
Oh! They're
dropped off, man.

253
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:10,605
You fucking asshole, man.

254
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:11,942
I got to get
a fucking job, man.

255
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,277
What's your problem, man?

256
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,576
What the fuck are
you doing, dickhead.

257
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,742
Yo, Mike, first day looking...

258
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,446
nobody ever gets a job
their first day looking.

259
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:22,149
Come on, don't
sweat it, man.

260
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,318
Hey, I can't
fuck around tomorrow.

261
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,520
I got to get a job for sure.

262
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:27,789
This is your job, man.

263
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,194
So act like a fucking
professional,

264
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,357
spark up the goods, 'cause we
got a lot of work to do.

265
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:43,767
It's harsh. It's good, though.

266
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,379
You okay?

267
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:57,448
How are those lungs, baby?

268
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,119
There it is.

269
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,822
That magic feeling.

270
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,741
Damn, look at that bitch.

271
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:26,549
Oh, damn.

272
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,817
Fuck, yeah.

273
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,385
She's fucking good.

274
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:37,057
I bet she got skills.
I want to get laid.

275
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:40,226
You just saw your woman.

276
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:41,701
Only hit her once, man.

277
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:45,103
We can't go nowhere alone.
They got me sleeping in the car.

278
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,907
Family's got that ass
under guard, huh?

279
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:51,070
Lock and key.

280
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:53,910
Fuck, I want to get laid.

281
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:57,041
Pay a visit
to my harem, huh?

282
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:58,245
Online, pornmeister.

283
00:18:58,286 --> 00:18:59,810
Uh-uh, let's go
to Letty's pad, man.

284
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:01,719
How much you want to bet
I hit it.

285
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:03,553
- She won't, dog.
- How much you want to bet?

286
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:04,922
She won't give you shit, dog.

287
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:06,584
You big time
fucked her over.

288
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:09,324
Aw, man, I popped that poodahey.

289
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:12,629
I got that mind control, man.

290
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:16,228
How much you want to bet
I get back up in it?

291
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:17,761
20 bucks?

292
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:19,067
You ain't got 20 bucks.

293
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:21,041
So, neither do you, man.

294
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,906
Come on, shake on that shit.

295
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,344
Come on.

296
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,644
What the fuck, let's go.

297
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:28,876
(knocking)

298
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,316
I got it.

299
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,946
What's up, Patty?

300
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:35,956
- Y tu hermana?
- She ain't here.

301
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:37,491
Y sabes que?

302
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:39,618
You're not welcome
in this house.

303
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:42,789
Sure, Patty.

304
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,923
I'd love to come in.

305
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:47,666
Thank you.

306
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:49,966
Are they here?

307
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:58,208
You're looking fine,
as fuck, chulas.

308
00:19:58,246 --> 00:20:00,407
Don't... don't touch
me, please.

309
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:03,144
Hey, hey.

310
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,749
You got to get out of here.

311
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,756
Letty...

312
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,918
I just wanted
to see you again.

313
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:17,957
Hey, Patty, you want to grab
me a pisto or something?

314
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,967
I ain't grabbing you shit.

315
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,400
Oh, you still got
a mouth, huh?

316
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:23,461
Maybe one day you'll learn
how to keep it shut.

317
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:26,701
Laters. I'm going to my room.

318
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:30,040
You know you have to run
his ass out of here.

319
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,645
Baby.

320
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,945
Let's sit down.

321
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,063
No, no, no.

322
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:54,194
So, um...

323
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:56,066
You a cop yet?

324
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:57,696
I'm working on it.

325
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,969
Y tu?

326
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:02,975
Que andas haciendo?

327
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,411
Well, you know, I'm going
to L.A. Trade Tech.

328
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:08,074
It's good you're doing
positive shit.

329
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:22,428
What, after everything
I don't get a kiss?

330
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:26,229
It's because of everything
you can't get a kiss.

331
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:28,360
Oh, come on, come here.

332
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:31,634
Yeah.

333
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:37,472
Don't.

334
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:40,208
Jim, I got a boyfriend.

335
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:42,011
Who?

336
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:44,346
Flaco.

337
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:45,374
You're back with that

338
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,752
piece of shit after
what he did, Letty?

339
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,185
You're not fucking him, are you?

340
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:53,523
Please tell me no.

341
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:56,394
Yes. So... just go.

342
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:58,228
'Cause there's nothing
here for you, Jim.

343
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,699
See?

344
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:03,067
Okay?

345
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,867
I don't believe
this shit, Letty.

346
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,771
You're too good for that.

347
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:15,082
You gotta go.

348
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,947
Go. Please!

349
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:18,110
Let me talk to them.

350
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:20,086
No, Jim, don't
be stupid. Please.

351
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:24,455
Okay? Largate. Just go.

352
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,492
I guess it's later days.

353
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,977
Largate. Just go!

354
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:46,502
Flaco, the pinchi guero's here!

355
00:22:46,547 --> 00:22:48,777
Apuarte, Jim!
Hurry up!

356
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:50,875
- Fuck him up!
- I got him!

357
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:12,772
Fucking white boy!

358
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:17,634
What's up, faggot?!

359
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:20,511
We're going to fuck you up!

360
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,318
Yo! Pop the trunk

361
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:27,548
so I can handle this shit!

362
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:29,283
Fuck you, puto!

363
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:30,950
I'll bust you!

364
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,983
Leave him alone!

365
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,019
Pop the fucking trunk!

366
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:55,876
Jim!

367
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:59,510
Oh, you fucked up!

368
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:01,715
Get your fucking knees
down on the curb now!

369
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:03,383
Get the fuck
over there, man!

370
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:05,324
Don't fucking move unless you
want your brains hanging out!

371
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,519
What's your problem, Flaco?

372
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:09,496
Motherfucker!

373
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,521
Fucking knees on the curb, man!

374
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:14,967
That's right!

375
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:19,063
Interlock your fingers
behind your heads, Flaco!

376
00:24:19,106 --> 00:24:21,597
You deaf fuck!

377
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,473
Yo, Mike.

378
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:27,776
Yeah?

379
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:29,180
Do up their ride.

380
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,152
Freeze, bitch!

381
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:35,178
I'm going to take that big ass
of yours home,

382
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,384
hit it for a minute, you know?

383
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:38,722
Fuck off!

384
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,748
Now you got it.

385
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:44,757
Yo, relax, homie.

386
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:50,060
You break Letty's heart,
I'm coming for your mom.

387
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:51,264
Fuck!

388
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:55,934
Hey, haina.

389
00:24:55,977 --> 00:24:57,069
Whoo!

390
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:58,635
Fuck off!
Oh, yeah?

391
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,613
What you got down here?

392
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:02,206
(whistles):
Oh...

393
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,740
Liking that.

394
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:10,881
Damn! Those are
badass kicks, dog.

395
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:13,723
Lucky you got little bitch feet,

396
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:16,161
else I'd be stomping around
in them motherfuckers.

397
00:25:16,197 --> 00:25:18,062
- Fuck you, puto.
- Huh?

398
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,760
- Yeah. Fuck you.
- Yes?

399
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:24,566
You fucking stay still!

400
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:26,937
Bitches! If you didn't have
that fucking gun,

401
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:29,499
ese, it wouldn't
be about shit, homie.

402
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:31,444
Not fucking shit!

403
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,947
Hey, later, Patty!

404
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:35,812
I hope you're not
pregnant, but you know

405
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,942
you wanted me to blow in you.

406
00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:38,076
Fuck you!

407
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,780
Bye, Letty!

408
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:48,859
Salud.

409
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:50,227
Salud.

410
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:56,527
Diwy up the bounty, dude.
I know you got some cash.

411
00:26:07,214 --> 00:26:09,307
I know I got more than that.

412
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:13,415
Yeah. Here we go.

413
00:26:13,454 --> 00:26:14,751
Shit.

414
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:16,984
That's my pussy
she's giving away there.

415
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:20,723
Homeboy uses extra large.

416
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:22,524
Man, that's it?
Next time,

417
00:26:22,563 --> 00:26:24,155
jack someone with a job.

418
00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:27,861
Well, fuck you.
What did you get, their lunch?

419
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:29,597
Check it out.

420
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:32,697
Holy shit.
You're kidding me.

421
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:41,978
Whoo! It's a fucking
Ruger P-94. Nine millimeter.

422
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,916
14, plus one in the chamber.

423
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:46,715
It's a good fucking gun.
Durable.

424
00:26:46,754 --> 00:26:48,551
It's brand-new.

425
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:52,583
It's a BB gun.

426
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:54,060
Yeah. Cool.

427
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,687
Here you go, dog.

428
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,061
About time you got a cohete.

429
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:58,565
No. I don't want it.

430
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,863
Why the fuck not? I'll use it.

431
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:02,892
That's a good reason. Sell it.

432
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:04,928
How much you think
we can get for the gun?

433
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,668
Two bills, maybe three.
Costs six new.

434
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,835
We'll sell it
and split the greenery.

435
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:10,866
You sure?

436
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:12,572
It's cool, dude.

437
00:27:12,613 --> 00:27:14,171
50-50.

438
00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:17,808
Good BB gun though.

439
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:20,412
Shoot some birds and shit.

440
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:22,217
Hey, put that shit away.

441
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:23,746
Looks real as hell.

442
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,085
Not a bad day's work.

443
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:40,605
Get down to business though.

444
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:43,075
I know you didn't get any.

445
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,600
So pay up, motherfucker.

446
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,581
Dick.

447
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:57,416
Hello. This is a message
for Michael Alonzo.

448
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:02,225
This is Bob Luell
at the Palm Glen Group.

449
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,322
We have reviewed your resume,

450
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:07,129
and would like
to make an appointment

451
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:08,533
for later in the week.

452
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:09,695
Please call me at your

453
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:11,534
earliest convenience.

454
00:28:11,572 --> 00:28:12,539
Thank you.

455
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:14,837
Huh? That's good.

456
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,467
One more? This is fun.

457
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,603
Sounded a little gay,
but it was good.

458
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,776
No, no, no. No.
That's it, dude. That's it.

459
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:23,943
I get too many callbacks,

460
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:25,212
Sylvia's going
to get suspicious.

461
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:26,844
Oh, Sylvia's going
to be kissing your ass.

462
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:28,252
Not if she
recognizes your voice.

463
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,314
Oh, she won't. Here, sir.

464
00:28:30,357 --> 00:28:31,949
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm cool.

465
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:33,459
- Come on.
- I'm cool.

466
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:35,962
I want to get home before the
little woman and sober up.

467
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:37,964
Come on, bro. One brew.

468
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:40,329
All right, but hey,

469
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:42,198
I got to look for a job
tomorrow for sure.

470
00:28:42,236 --> 00:28:43,464
Okay? I can't
be getting fucked up

471
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:44,562
behind Sylvia's back
when I'm supposed

472
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:45,663
to be looking
for work, man.

473
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:47,367
Not cool.
Tomorrow, for sure.

474
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:49,501
I got to find a job, too.

475
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:54,579
(phone rings)

476
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:56,207
Hello.

477
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:01,049
Yes, sir.

478
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:05,124
Yes, sir. That is correct.

479
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,626
Six years.

480
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,924
Honorably discharged.

481
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:10,623
Yes, sir.

482
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:12,495
I would love to.

483
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:15,593
Believe me, I would
welcome the opportunity.

484
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,631
Tomorrow

485
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:21,607
is not a problem.

486
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:23,940
Thank you, sir.
You have a good day, too.

487
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:26,673
Good-bye, sir.

488
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:28,944
That was the man, huh?
You're all "Sir,

489
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:30,380
sir, sir."

490
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:34,513
Yes! Fucking yes! Thank God!

491
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,820
That was the man!
That was the Federal man!

492
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:43,421
The Federal man!

493
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:44,726
Department of
Homeland Security

494
00:29:44,765 --> 00:29:46,596
wants me to come in
tomorrow to start testing!

495
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:49,569
Oh, shit!

496
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:50,865
Fucking A, my brother!

497
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:52,202
That shit is righteous,
motherfucker!

498
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:53,433
It's on, homie!

499
00:29:53,474 --> 00:29:55,135
Wow, man.
Tomorrow.

500
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:56,905
So what the fuck you
going to do now, dude?

501
00:29:56,944 --> 00:29:58,502
I got to take a piss test.

502
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,843
If I'm cool,
I'm in the house.

503
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:06,414
Yeah! Oh!

504
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:09,889
Shit, dude,
do they piss test for weed?

505
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:12,586
Oh, shit!

506
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,854
You fucked up, man.

507
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,762
Oh, fuck.

508
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,128
I fucked up.

509
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,763
Oh, fuck. I fucked up.

510
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:27,171
Fuck! Oh...

511
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:30,234
You know, one dope
molecule, and I'm done.

512
00:30:30,277 --> 00:30:32,745
And they will burn me

513
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,374
with every law enforcement
outfit in the country.

514
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,576
Shit!

515
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:37,879
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, dude.

516
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:41,376
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

517
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,253
Hey, there's a way out
of every fucking situation.

518
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,781
- Right? Relax, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

519
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:48,260
Yeah. I'm going to do
what I got to do, you know?

520
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,421
It's cool. Fuck, yeah.

521
00:30:49,463 --> 00:30:50,555
I'll pass that shit.

522
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,963
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

523
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:54,330
Of course
you will, dude!

524
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:57,303
Later, loco.

525
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:58,566
Don't fucking trip, dude.

526
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,504
All right.

527
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,565
(sighs):
Shit.

528
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:08,815
Eat.

529
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:10,316
(knocking on door)

530
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:11,841
Come in, dumb ass!

531
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:17,819
What's up, dog?

532
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:18,825
What up, dog...

533
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:21,657
Hey, Jim.
Want some coffee?

534
00:31:21,695 --> 00:31:22,719
Sure.

535
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:24,526
Want some eggs?
There's extra.

536
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:26,760
Yes, ma'am. Please.

537
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,826
I, uh, heard
about the LAPD.

538
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,701
Sorry about that.

539
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:33,673
I thought they
guaranteed you a job.

540
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:35,197
Yea. Me, too.

541
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:38,871
Well, maybe it
wasrt meant to be.

542
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:41,677
You know, you being a cop.

543
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,281
Tell her what's up, dude.

544
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,650
Well, I applied

545
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,713
to all the Federal
law enforcement agencies.

546
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,088
You know, ATF, Border Patrol,

547
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,558
ICE, Homeland Security,
all of them.

548
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:55,357
And Homeland Security's
interested in me.

549
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:57,921
They want me to come in today
and start testing.

550
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:00,456
Wow. That's great.
How sure is this?

551
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,196
Well, I got a urinalysis today.

552
00:32:02,236 --> 00:32:04,397
If I pass that, I'll be
a Special Agent candidate,

553
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:06,463
and then I could
be out of here next month.

554
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,338
You haven't been
smoking out, have you?

555
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:12,072
Nah. Chilled on that shit
a while back.

556
00:32:12,112 --> 00:32:14,342
Good. Well, thanks for driving
Mike around yesterday.

557
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:16,246
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, bro.

558
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:18,274
Three callbacks.

559
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,913
Damn! Good!

560
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:23,719
We dropped off
enough resumes. Whoo!

561
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:25,156
Got more.

562
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:26,216
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

563
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,818
Well, you have
to keep trying

564
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:29,351
until something happens.

565
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:30,886
Finding a job is a job, right?

566
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:32,228
Lunch money.

567
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:33,460
Thank you.

568
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,762
And good
luck today.

569
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:36,736
Thank you.

570
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,203
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

571
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:40,001
Good luck.

572
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:42,474
And, Jim, good luck
on your pee test.

573
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:43,669
I hope you studied.

574
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:49,141
I'm going to
cram for it.

575
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:51,583
Man, that's freaky.

576
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:53,677
She was in
a good mood.

577
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,120
Breakfast
and beer money?

578
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:56,144
Yeah, dude.

579
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,522
She heard the
messages last night.

580
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,719
She got me a sixer.

581
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,421
I slammed two last night.

582
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:03,089
Out-fuckir-standing!

583
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,757
Now we know beer is just
a phone call away.

584
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:05,958
Yeah.

585
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,730
Yeah. We talked shit out
last night, though.

586
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:11,966
You know? Hey, all she wants
is for me to get a job.

587
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:14,870
I shouldn't be playing her
like that.

588
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,307
Dude, you had a good job,

589
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:20,973
with that, uh, with
that Web design shit.

590
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:22,573
Had, dude. Had.

591
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:24,811
All right? All that
shit's in India now.

592
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:26,513
Want a cold one?
No, later.

593
00:33:26,553 --> 00:33:27,781
You got any vinegar?

594
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:30,289
Vinegar? What for?

595
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:37,254
(exhales):
Ah...

596
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:39,265
(groans):
Oh...

597
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:40,323
Damn, dude!

598
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:41,527
Ah...

599
00:33:41,568 --> 00:33:42,694
(blabbers)

600
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,294
- Man!
- That is fuckir sick, man.

601
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:46,272
What'd you do that for?

602
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:47,739
- Shuts down the old kidneys.
- Ooh.

603
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,800
Come on, let's roll.

604
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,275
Grab me that bag, dude.

605
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:08,488
Little trick I learned
in the service.

606
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,793
Aw, that's sick, dude.

607
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:16,496
You're gonna stick
a turkey baster in your dick?

608
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,130
Quit looking, faggot.

609
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:22,006
You wish.

610
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:27,613
(quiet grunt)

611
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,876
(loud groaning)

612
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,383
(groans):
Oh, man.

613
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:31,714
(yells in pain)
Fuckir...

614
00:34:31,752 --> 00:34:33,344
shit, dude.

615
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:34,411
Oh, fuckir shit...

616
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:36,082
- (pained grunting)
- Aw...

617
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,153
Aw, motherfucker!

618
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:42,390
(gasps, groans)

619
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:44,158
Whew!

620
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:45,665
Ah...

621
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,929
(inales)

622
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:50,128
(groans)

623
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,070
That was...

624
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:54,734
unpleasant.

625
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:01,481
(quiet groan):
Man...

626
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:03,210
(clears throat softly)

627
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,616
Man, I want to get
this shit over with.

628
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:07,950
You know, my teeth are floating.

629
00:35:08,021 --> 00:35:09,750
(Jim groans)

630
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,587
Oh...

631
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:14,185
You get those
in the military, dog?

632
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,423
I was a Ranger.

633
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:18,624
Your mom still suck
a mean dick, hmm?

634
00:35:18,665 --> 00:35:20,326
Gotcha! Shouldrt ignore people.

635
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:21,959
Why don't you go
fuck yourself!

636
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:23,094
Hey!

637
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:24,502
Let's play nice,

638
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:26,130
boys.

639
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:29,199
I have everyone's "Consent to
Urinalysis" form signed

640
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:30,301
and dated, am I right?

641
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:31,311
ALL:
Yes, sir.

642
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:33,313
Good. I'm Agent Richards.

643
00:35:33,347 --> 00:35:34,974
Jackets off.

644
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:37,108
I will now administer
the easiest test

645
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:39,176
Homeland Security
will ever give you,

646
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:40,550
the whizz quiz.

647
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:42,953
Roll up both sleeves
past the elbow.

648
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:49,219
Remove all gloves, rings,
watches, bracelets,

649
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:53,597
jewelry, Band-Aids
and bandages.

650
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:57,126
I want to see nothing
but bare hands and forearms.

651
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:59,765
Wiggle your fingers.

652
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:02,468
Let me see
both sides.

653
00:36:02,509 --> 00:36:04,306
Beautifully done.

654
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:06,437
Again, gentlemen,
no talking.

655
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,708
Detweiler, is it?

656
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,682
You're with me.

657
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:13,676
(blows sharply)

658
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:21,256
(blows softly)

659
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:22,956
(blows loudly)

660
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:24,429
(whispers):
Fucker.

661
00:36:24,464 --> 00:36:27,456
(door opens, closes)

662
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:31,629
RICHARDS:
Next!

663
00:36:35,442 --> 00:36:36,670
Name?

664
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,837
Davis, Jim.

665
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,540
Ah, the Ranger.

666
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:41,980
Yes, sir.

667
00:36:42,015 --> 00:36:44,950
- You serve?
- 101st.

668
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:47,453
- High speed.
- All right.

669
00:36:47,487 --> 00:36:49,352
Think you can fill that, son?

670
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:52,119
I could fill
a goddamn trash can, sir.

671
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,094
(laughs): You're full of piss
and vinegar, aren't you, Jim?

672
00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:57,323
Yes, sir.

673
00:36:57,364 --> 00:37:00,822
# #

674
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,563
Hey, unload that shit before
you clown with it, okay?

675
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:05,265
I don't want my head
blown off

676
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:06,704
just when I'm getting
it straight.

677
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:10,907
Pop! What's it like

678
00:37:10,944 --> 00:37:12,434
to just straight-up
whack a motherfucker?

679
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:15,539
What's it like?
I mean, what the fuck, you know?

680
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:18,107
It's like nothing.
What's it supposed to be like?

681
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:19,448
You tell me.

682
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:21,784
You were busting heads
for the military.

683
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,313
I can't talk about
this shit, Mike.

684
00:37:27,961 --> 00:37:30,930
But I will tell you one
thing... you point and shoot,

685
00:37:30,964 --> 00:37:33,728
pop, pop, move on, fuck 'em,
they shouldn't have been there,

686
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:35,325
you move the fuck on.

687
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:39,328
You do not stop
and think about it.

688
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:41,603
- It's not a big deal.
- So if it's nothing,

689
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:42,973
then what you getting
all mad for?

690
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:44,202
I'm not getting mad.

691
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:45,643
I just hate stupid
questions, Mike.

692
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,806
You think you killed
a lot of Commies?

693
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,907
- They werert Commies, dumb ass.
- Then what were they?

694
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,349
You know what they were...
they were fuckir Hajjis,

695
00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:54,911
terrorists, the bad guys.

696
00:37:54,955 --> 00:37:57,924
Did you like it?
(quietly): Oh, shit.

697
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,925
Did you dig it?

698
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,325
You bust a nut?
(popping sound)

699
00:38:03,897 --> 00:38:06,229
Not fuckir now, man.
Seriously.

700
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,835
You're killing my buzz, dude.

701
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,338
Aw, kick back, stress case.

702
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:14,738
Are we on a mission to
sell this piece or what?

703
00:38:14,775 --> 00:38:15,901
Hell, yeah.

704
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:17,307
Let's sell this
fuckir piece.

705
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,904
Got to get some scratch,

706
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:20,742
Pop! Pop! Pop!

707
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,078
(dog barking in distance)

708
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,953
(loud music playing over stereo)

709
00:38:30,023 --> 00:38:33,789
# Don't lay your funky trip
on me... #

710
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:35,522
Yo, Darrel!

711
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:38,258
- Yo, yo, yo, Darrel!

712
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:39,765

713
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,097
Darrel!

714
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:43,398
Come on, come on, come on,

00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,063
(loud music continues)

717
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,004
Y'all need to knock
this shit off right now.

718
00:38:54,047 --> 00:38:56,515
- (Mike chuckling)
- Hey, what's up, bro?

719
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,313
(both talking indistinctly)

720
00:38:58,352 --> 00:38:59,819
Come on in, motherfuckers.

721
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:01,252
(mocking gibberish)
Yeah.

722
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:03,085
Get your little
ass up in here.

723
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,181
Shit!

724
00:39:04,224 --> 00:39:05,555
# Brother, please! #

725
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:07,389
Oh, man...

726
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:09,793

the fuck out of me, man.

727
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,888
(chuckling)

728
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,365
You motherfuckers
got ties on.

729
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,300
I saw that city-lookir
car pull up...

730
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:17,428
I thought y'all was
some rollers or shit.

731
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,462
(chuckles quietly)

732
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:20,939
I just got out of County.

733
00:39:20,974 --> 00:39:24,239
- $9,600.
- No shit. When?

734
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:26,074
Yesterday.

735
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,774
MIKE: Damn. What'd
they put on you?

736
00:39:27,814 --> 00:39:28,781
Some bullshit.

737
00:39:28,815 --> 00:39:30,942
I saw some wrong-ass shit

738
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:32,212
up in there, dude.

739
00:39:32,252 --> 00:39:34,379
I ain't ever going back
to that motherfucker.

740
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:35,945
It scared you straight, huh?

741
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:38,617
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, you get booty-played?

742
00:39:38,658 --> 00:39:40,649
(laughing)

743
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:41,956
Hell, no.

744
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:44,087
You over there tickling
your brown eye, dog?

745
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,565
They-they put some jelly
on there, serve some syrup?

746
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,591
- You toss the salad?
- Hey, you know, nigga,

747
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:52,401
I kept my ass to the wall
and my mouth shut.

748
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,633
Shoot.

749
00:39:53,673 --> 00:39:55,834
I almost lost my job
over that shit.

750
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,503
Fuckir around in there.

751
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,910
Oh, God...

752
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:04,746
- You a cop?
- Nope.

753
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:06,514
Rejected his ass.

754
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:07,679
Fuck you.

755
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:09,279
I'm getting

756
00:40:09,322 --> 00:40:12,382
(laughs):
Damn...

757
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:14,758
That's what I'm talking about!

758
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:16,660
Ah, you hear that?

759
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:19,221
This motherfucker

760
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:21,097

You been wanting that shit, too.

762
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:25,337
It's my dream, dude.

763
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,135
So, you gonna do

765
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,337
I'm gonna get
my own thing going.

766
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,939
You know, I'll be flipping shit,

767
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:37,381
- You know?

768
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:41,148
This motherfucker

769
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,520
Scary, huh?

770
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:44,888
(Jim clears throat)

771
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:48,361
Check this shit out.

772
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:49,692
Oh, hello!

773
00:40:49,729 --> 00:40:51,196
(chuckles):
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

774
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:52,926
This is sweet!

775
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:55,628
We jacked some eses.
Got a BB gun, too.

776
00:40:55,669 --> 00:40:57,967
- A BB gun?
- Yo.

777
00:40:58,004 --> 00:41:00,165
Goddamn!

778
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,142
This is a nice little machine.

779
00:41:03,176 --> 00:41:05,144
Three bills, it's yours.

780
00:41:05,178 --> 00:41:07,169
I ain't got
three bills, dog.

781
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:10,183
My lawyer cleaned me out.

782
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,684
(sighs):
Man...

783
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:15,119
I ain't got no ways
or means, homie.

784
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:18,357
I need this shit, too.

785
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:21,417

787

We need ends, dog.

788
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:30,201
Who'll give us
three bills for it?

789
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,000
Hey, uh, I know a cat.

00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:34,563

00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:39,808
Oh, man, he's old school,

794
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:41,245
Veterano named Eddie.

795
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:43,545
He there today?

796
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,914
Oh, that's just like

797
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:46,282
Mm.

798
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,220
Yeah. Yeah, I'll hook you up.
Don't worry about it.

799
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,416
Cool, cool.

800
00:41:50,457 --> 00:41:53,085
Yo, uh...

801
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:55,617
Y'all need to

802
00:41:55,662 --> 00:41:57,630
Can you do me a favor?

803
00:41:57,664 --> 00:41:58,961
Sure.

804
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,523
You mind calling my pad

805
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:01,966
and leaving a fake message

806
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:05,096
so my old lady thinks I'm
out there looking for a job?

807
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:08,073
Instead you out

808
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:08,972
(both laughing)

809
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,874
Can you hook me up,

810
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:12,674
or what, dog? Huh?

811
00:42:12,712 --> 00:42:14,179
Yeah? All right.

812
00:42:14,214 --> 00:42:15,738
Check this out.

813
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:18,842
Uh, just call, right?
(coughs)

814
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:21,217
And say you're from

815
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:24,485
and that you want
to schedule an interview, dude.

816
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:27,516
Man, y'all some devious
motherfuckers, man.

817
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:28,994
(laughing)

818
00:42:29,062 --> 00:42:30,393
(mumbles)

819
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,593
Hey, hey, make sure
she can't star-69 my shit.

820
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:35,931
Nah, she's...
Serious, man.

821
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:38,767
I ain't trying to break up
no shit on this.

822
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:40,705
All right, it's ringing.

861
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:09,858
Hey, Jim.

862
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,865
We should lose

863
00:44:16,436 --> 00:44:18,336

869
00:45:01,614 --> 00:45:04,515
Hey, dog, I don't
think they like us here.

870
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:05,540
Fuck 'em.

871
00:45:05,585 --> 00:45:07,052
I got my shit.

872
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:09,555
They make a move,
I'm blasting.

873
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:13,582
Which one of these fools
is Eddy?

874
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:17,089
Yeah. I don't know.

875
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,258
They're all paisas here.

876
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:26,495
Hey, why don't you ask
that homegirl right there?

877
00:45:37,383 --> 00:45:40,978
Sientate, guapa.

878
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:41,987
Mm.

879
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:43,079

00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:45,249
Que bien.

882
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:47,851
Sabas donde esta
el Eddy?

883
00:45:47,894 --> 00:45:50,294
Eddy, te hablan.

884
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,138
Que paso?

885
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:01,072
Do I know you?

886
00:46:01,107 --> 00:46:03,507
My homeboy Darrell said
to talk to you.

887
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:06,637
Darrell?
Yeah.

888
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:09,307
I'm Jim, homie.

889
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,952
What's up, man? Mike, dog.

890
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,352
All right.
So what's up?

891
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:18,152
Need a cohete?

892
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:21,557
Maybe.

893
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:27,224
What kind?

894
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:29,292
Ruger P-94, brand-new.

895
00:46:29,335 --> 00:46:30,859
Ruger, huh?
Yeah.

896
00:46:30,904 --> 00:46:31,893
How many mags?

897
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:33,872
One high cap.
I'll throw in the hollow points.

898
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:37,339
Strictly Black Talons, homes.

899
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,607
Homies be wearing
vests these days,

900
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:40,977
know what
I'm saying?

901
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,978
Is it new?

902
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:43,912
Yeah, it's brand-new.

903
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,611
Where's it at?

904
00:46:45,652 --> 00:46:46,914
I can get it.

905
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,015
How much?

906
00:46:51,057 --> 00:46:53,389
Three bills.

907
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:54,893
I'll give you $250
if it's new.

908
00:46:54,928 --> 00:46:56,190
If not, I'll give you $200.

909
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:03,664
Cool.

910
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:07,195
You got the feria, homie?

911
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,730
I can get it.

912
00:47:08,775 --> 00:47:10,436
Orale.

913
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:12,535
Let's kick back,

914
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,638
before we handle business, eh?

915
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:18,940
Hey, guero, you like her?

916
00:47:19,018 --> 00:47:21,816
I do need to get laid.

917
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,652
There it is right

918
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,952
Yo, give me that cohete.

919
00:47:25,024 --> 00:47:28,653

920
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:42,740
Mataste a un flor.

921
00:47:50,016 --> 00:47:51,278
Oh, shit!

922
00:47:51,317 --> 00:47:52,875
Open the fucking door!

923
00:47:55,288 --> 00:47:56,585
(engine starts)

924
00:48:02,795 --> 00:48:03,762
MIKE:
Holy shit, dude!

925
00:48:03,796 --> 00:48:05,696

926
00:48:05,732 --> 00:48:06,926
You think he's gonna
fuckir die?!

927
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:08,866
Sure. Got his carotid.

928
00:48:08,902 --> 00:48:10,699
Fucker was garden-hosing.

929
00:48:10,737 --> 00:48:11,704
He'll bleed out.

930
00:48:11,738 --> 00:48:12,932
Oh, shit, dude,

931
00:48:12,972 --> 00:48:14,940

Quick as shit, too.

935
00:48:21,214 --> 00:48:23,842
Turned that vato into
a fountain of blood.

936
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:25,475
Why the fuck
did he do that, man?

937
00:48:25,518 --> 00:48:27,452
That shit could have been
over anything, you know?

938
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,079
Money, drugs, bitches,
respect, whatever.

939
00:48:29,122 --> 00:48:30,521
That homie, straight-up pimp.

940
00:48:30,556 --> 00:48:32,490
You know, maybe he turned out
that dude's daughter.

941
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:33,583
Looney tunes and shit,

942
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:35,093
glass all stuck
in his fuckir neck.

943
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:36,959
Did you see all that fuckir
blood over there?!

944
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:39,294
Yeah, man, the human body's

945
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:42,460
Damn!

946
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,403
I coulda boned Gracie.

947
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:48,168
She had that proper thickness.

948
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:49,196
Look at me, dog.

949
00:48:49,242 --> 00:48:51,210
Look at me.

950
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:54,008

Oh, man,

953
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:02,744
Trashcanistan.

954
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:06,247
My battle buddy, he got his legs
and arms blown off

955
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:08,658
by a booby-trapped motorcycle.

956
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,926
Medic saved his ass
and he lived.

957
00:49:11,998 --> 00:49:15,832
He didn't want to, but he did.

958
00:49:15,868 --> 00:49:17,267
I got to face my woman.

959
00:49:17,303 --> 00:49:19,601
How in the fuck am I supposed
to play this shit off, huh?

960
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:21,698
Man, you'll do it, player.

961
00:49:23,643 --> 00:49:26,737
(siren wails in distance)

962
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:31,946
Hey, baby girl,
you cooking?

963
00:49:31,985 --> 00:49:33,350
Yeah. Where have you been?

964
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:34,876
Oh, Jim's pad.

965
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:36,183
You been drinking?

966
00:49:36,222 --> 00:49:37,883
Oh, you know,
I had a few brews.

967
00:49:37,924 --> 00:49:39,323
A few?
Yeah.

968
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,587
You look wasted.

969
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:43,918
(gasps)

970
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:44,952
Don't trip, girl.

971
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:46,226
I've been working
all day.

972
00:49:46,265 --> 00:49:50,531
I've been looking
for work all day.

973
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,562
I wish I could hang out and
get wasted like the old days.

974
00:49:53,606 --> 00:49:55,403
You know what?

975
00:49:55,441 --> 00:49:57,739
When I'm working,
you can lounge.

976
00:49:57,777 --> 00:49:59,642
I'll fix this place up,

977
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:01,078
get you nice clothes
and stuff...

978
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:02,342
Mike, Mike, Mike.

979
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:04,907
It doesn't have anything
to do with money.

980
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:06,316
Come here.

981
00:50:06,352 --> 00:50:09,753
Sit down. I want
to talk to you.

982
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:11,313
Hey, it's not
about stuff.

983
00:50:11,357 --> 00:50:14,349
It's about you and me
needing an equal partner.

984
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:15,827
Right.

985
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:17,989
Hey, I know that you
supported me through college

986
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:19,498
and I'm gonna always

987
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:20,658
- owe you for that.
- Right.

988
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,962
Now everything's flipped

989
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:23,593
and I feel like I'm doing
everything alone.

990
00:50:23,636 --> 00:50:27,663
You know, sometimes
I feel like you're my kid.

991
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:29,698
I mean, you sneak
around like one.

992
00:50:29,742 --> 00:50:30,936
Oh-ho!

993
00:50:30,977 --> 00:50:34,003
Look... Wow, dude.

994
00:50:34,113 --> 00:50:36,343
I'm sorry.

995
00:50:36,382 --> 00:50:37,406
Be cool, baby girl,

996
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:38,849
I'm on a mission
to get my shit together.

997
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:41,479
I applied at this commercial
realty company in Studio City,

998
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:43,751
and this black guy,
he was the office manager

999
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,018
and he's fuckir hella cool,

1000
00:50:45,058 --> 00:50:46,855
you know? We're talkir
and all that shit.

1001
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:49,157
You know? We're just kickir it
and all that.

1002
00:50:49,195 --> 00:50:51,595
Did you, did you
check the messages?

1003
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:55,957
Four messages.

1004
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:57,661
DARRELL:
Mr. Alonzo, I'm calling

1005
00:50:57,703 --> 00:51:00,331
from Sunouse Properties
to schedule an interview.

1006
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:02,864
Honey, this is great!

1007
00:51:02,909 --> 00:51:05,810
Mm, mm...
Oh! Oh...

1008
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:07,779
You better call him
first thing in the morning.

1009
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,372
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1010
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:12,782
MIKE:
Oh, damn, dog,
that shit was good, dude.

1011
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,344
Damn, they should give you
a fuckir Oscar for that shit.

1012
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:17,913
(machine beeps)

1013
00:51:26,265 --> 00:51:27,994
You just stood there

1014
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:31,993
and you fed me a line of
bullshit like it was nothing.

1015
00:51:32,105 --> 00:51:35,871
You should be
the lawyer.

1016
00:51:35,908 --> 00:51:38,468
How could you just do that?

1017
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:42,174
How could you look me in the eye
and lie to me like that?

1018
00:51:42,215 --> 00:51:43,239
I'm sorry.

1019
00:51:43,282 --> 00:51:45,876
I'd rather you hit me.

1020
00:51:47,353 --> 00:51:49,218
I'm your clown.

1021
00:51:49,255 --> 00:51:50,779
I'm your fucking clown.

1022
00:51:50,823 --> 00:51:54,350
And you and Jim
are laughing at me?

1023
00:51:54,393 --> 00:51:56,384
No, it's not...

1024
00:51:56,429 --> 00:52:00,695
No, no, no, you are so utterly,
irrevocably busted!

1025
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:06,769
Why don't you just go play
with your little butt buddy?

1026
00:52:06,806 --> 00:52:08,774
Go cook up more lies.

1027
00:52:08,808 --> 00:52:10,776
You know, I bet
you're doing lines again.

1028
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,472
Dude, how could you say
that shit?

1029
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:14,741
I'm not fuckir
doing lines again.

1030
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,338
Yeah, right, right.

1031
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:17,974
I'm not fuckir
doing lines again!

1032
00:52:18,084 --> 00:52:20,518
Right now your word
is less than shit.

1033
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:22,612
Maybe you should go.

1034
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:26,523
Just fuckir go.

1035
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,723
Just fuckir... just go, right?

1036
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:32,355
Fuck it.
I'll fuckir go!

1037
00:52:32,398 --> 00:52:33,456
Please, go. Go!

1038
00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:35,433
Fuck it then!
I'll fuckir go!

1039
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:37,095
Then go, Mike!

1040
00:52:37,136 --> 00:52:38,262
I'm serious!
I'll fuckir go

1041
00:52:38,304 --> 00:52:39,498
except I won't fuckir
come back!

1042
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:40,733
You want me to fuckir go?!

1043
00:52:40,773 --> 00:52:41,762
Fuckir go, Mike!

1044
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:43,104
I'll fuckir go then!

1045
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:44,109
I'll fuckir go!

1046
00:52:44,143 --> 00:52:47,044
Get the fuck outta here!

1047
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:49,445
(phone rings)

1048
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,445
Hello?

1049
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:00,152
Speaking.

1050
00:53:00,193 --> 00:53:04,425
Of course, sir. Absolutely.

1051
00:53:04,463 --> 00:53:07,557
Thank you very much,
Agent Richards.

1052
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,625
Thank you, sir.

1053
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:15,798
Who was that?

1054
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:17,206
That was the feds,
my friend.

1055
00:53:17,243 --> 00:53:20,872
I've been informed that I passed
my urinalysis

1056
00:53:20,913 --> 00:53:23,347
and they would like me
to go in this morning

1057
00:53:23,382 --> 00:53:26,647
to start formal testing.

1058
00:53:26,686 --> 00:53:28,153
Fuck yeah, dude.

1059
00:53:28,187 --> 00:53:29,279
I'll be there all day,

1060
00:53:29,322 --> 00:53:32,382
so take my ride,
get your ass a job.

1061
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:33,449
Let's go.

1062
00:53:33,492 --> 00:53:34,754
Oh, shit!

1063
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:38,491
Come on. Get your
parasitic ass in gear.

1064
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:42,524
(groans)

1065
00:53:42,568 --> 00:53:46,504
I had some twisted-ass dreams
about that dude being killed.

1066
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:48,507
I slept like a baby.

1067
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,942
I heard screaming.

1068
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,536
What kind of tests?

1069
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:56,377
Psychological tests.

1070
00:53:56,415 --> 00:53:59,680
Geez, you're
a freakir psycho, dude.

1071
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,118
Don't answer that shit
honestly.

1072
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:03,644
Hell no.

1073
00:54:03,689 --> 00:54:06,954
They use the Minnesota
Multiphasic Inventory.

1074
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:11,189
It's like 600 questions,
cross-referenced

1075
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,221
to detect deception.

1076
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,756
They ask the same shit

1077
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,791
six different ways.
It's lame.

1078
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,667
You'll ace it.

1079
00:54:18,704 --> 00:54:22,231
Dude, I'm gonna pull it off.

1080
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:25,870
All I needed was a shot.

1081
00:54:25,911 --> 00:54:27,674
Gotta play the system.

1082
00:54:27,713 --> 00:54:31,046
Like a piano.

1083
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:41,551
You done
with that crap, son?

1084
00:54:41,594 --> 00:54:42,822
Yes, sir.

1085
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,524
Let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.

1086
00:54:45,564 --> 00:54:47,623
Bring that with you.

1087
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:50,659
(whispers):
I see dumb people.

1088
00:54:53,773 --> 00:54:56,037
We reviewed
your LAPD package.

1089
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:58,600
Since they ran your background,
physical and psych,

1090
00:54:58,644 --> 00:55:00,703
we're going with
their paper.

1091
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:02,338
- Navy sucks.
- Army swallows.

1092
00:55:02,381 --> 00:55:04,246
Took a little work to
pry your jacket loose

1093
00:55:04,283 --> 00:55:05,716
from their people.

1094
00:55:05,751 --> 00:55:08,311
They don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.

1095
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:09,878
Move it, dirt bag.

1096
00:55:11,424 --> 00:55:12,857
Why'd they drop me?

1097
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,360
Someone here make a call?

1098
00:55:15,394 --> 00:55:16,827
Nope.

1099
00:55:16,862 --> 00:55:18,159
They dropped you
on psych, Jim.

1100
00:55:19,598 --> 00:55:21,657
You blew
their profiles.

1101
00:55:21,701 --> 00:55:24,397
We're all a little
goofy here.

1102
00:55:24,437 --> 00:55:27,099
You'd rather be with us,
wouldn't you?

1103
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:28,731
Absolutely, sir.

1104
00:55:28,774 --> 00:55:31,072
Good answer.

1105
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,543
Have a seat.

1106
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:35,871
Said you were bilingual
on your app.

1107
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,542
They want to test your Spanish.

1108
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,949
We can get that going
if you got time.

1109
00:55:39,985 --> 00:55:41,782
Yes. Sure.

1110
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:43,345
Who's "they"?

1111
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:44,947
Your fans upstairs.

1112
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,855
Fans upstairs? Who?

1113
00:55:46,892 --> 00:55:49,452
This is some shit
above my pay grade,

1114
00:55:49,495 --> 00:55:53,056
but some very important people
have an eye on you, Jim.

1115
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:58,928
RECEPTIONIST:
Westside Realty Management.

1116
00:55:59,038 --> 00:56:00,699
How may I direct your call?

1117
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,764
(distant phone ringing)

1118
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:02,933
Please hold.

1119
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:06,239
Okay, Mike...

1120
00:56:06,278 --> 00:56:07,768
Alonzo?

1121
00:56:07,813 --> 00:56:09,212
Oh, shit. Joe?!

1122
00:56:09,248 --> 00:56:10,647
Damn...
What's up, dog?

1123
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:12,708
- Mikey, look at you.
- What are you doing here, dude?

1124
00:56:12,752 --> 00:56:14,686
Mikey, man, check you out.

1125
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,948
What the fuck you doing here?

1126
00:56:16,055 --> 00:56:17,386
Fucking grew up. I work here.

1127
00:56:17,423 --> 00:56:18,947
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

1128
00:56:19,058 --> 00:56:20,719
Dude, you got to come on up.

1129
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,954
Yeah, I'll show you
the office.

1130
00:56:22,027 --> 00:56:23,426
Fuck, you're gonna trip, man,

1131
00:56:23,462 --> 00:56:24,861
I can see the ocean
and everything.

1132
00:56:24,897 --> 00:56:27,297
Check you out, fucking
ocean view and all that.

1133
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,301
You're wearing a suit now.

1134
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:30,927
- Got your hair cut.
- Hey, watch out, baby.

1135
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,096
Yeah. Tag no more, huh?

1136
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,503
No, man.

1137
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:34,972
Dude, what's up with
your brother, Pedro?

1138
00:56:35,007 --> 00:56:37,066
Oh, man, he's in Iraq.
He's in a forward unit.

1139
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:38,974
Get the fuck out of here. Yeah.

1140
00:56:39,078 --> 00:56:41,239
(muttering):
Fuckir Mexicans.

1141
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:44,113
Bye, sweetie.

1142
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,915
Thank you, sir.
I need me some of this, man.

1143
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:51,286
I've been taking piss all day.

1144
00:56:51,323 --> 00:56:52,312
Dude!

1145
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:53,188
What?

1146
00:56:53,225 --> 00:56:54,192
You're not going to

1147
00:56:54,226 --> 00:56:55,352
- fucking believe this.
- What?

1148
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:57,521
- I had an interview today.
- Yeah?

1149
00:56:57,563 --> 00:56:59,030
- Remember Crazy Joe?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1150
00:56:59,064 --> 00:57:00,929
Dude stomped that guy's
face in at Taco Land

1151
00:57:00,966 --> 00:57:02,934
for grabbing his chick's ass.

1152
00:57:02,968 --> 00:57:04,492
Homeboy got his shit
together, man.

1153
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:05,561
Went to UCLA.

1154
00:57:05,604 --> 00:57:07,834
Works at this office
up in Century City.

1155
00:57:07,873 --> 00:57:09,238
I got the hookup, dog.

1156
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:11,402
- 12 an hour.
- Hoo-hoo!

1157
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:13,105
- That's a lot of lettuce.
- That's right.

1158
00:57:13,145 --> 00:57:14,806
And in three months,
I get benefits.

1159
00:57:14,847 --> 00:57:15,814
Damn! Benefits?

1160
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:17,577
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Shit!

1161
00:57:17,616 --> 00:57:18,776
Yeah!

1162
00:57:18,818 --> 00:57:20,445
It's not for sure yet,
though, dude.

1163
00:57:20,486 --> 00:57:22,113
I still got to
meet the owner, right.

1164
00:57:22,154 --> 00:57:23,849
But he says I'm straight.

1165
00:57:23,889 --> 00:57:25,220
It's all good, you know.

1166
00:57:25,257 --> 00:57:27,157
You're in.
Dude...

1167
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,683
I'm in.
Oh, shit.

1168
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:30,160
Yeah...
What happened?

1169
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,788
They want my ass, man.
Going back tomorrow

1170
00:57:31,831 --> 00:57:33,162
for a polygraph test.

1171
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,429
If I pass that, they'll
send me to Georgia next week.

1172
00:57:35,468 --> 00:57:37,527
Oh... Damn!
It's like that?!

1173
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:38,832
What's up, lawman?

1174
00:57:38,871 --> 00:57:40,202
Whoo-hoo!

1175
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:41,866
How you gonna pass
a lie detector test,

1176
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:43,534
- you lying motherfucker?
- Aw, easy, man.

1177
00:57:43,576 --> 00:57:46,374
After every question,
you just fucking squeeze

1178
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:48,039
like you're taking
a dump, you know, man.

1179
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,173
- It throws the machine off. Ooh!
- Oh, dog.

1180
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,911
You're gonna shit your
pants like that, bro.

1181
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:53,077
Fuck, I think I just did.

1182
00:57:53,118 --> 00:57:54,745
All right, Jim,

1183
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:56,618
I'm going to ask you
some control questions

1184
00:57:56,655 --> 00:57:58,919
before we get
to the good stuff.

1185
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:01,426
They can be answered
just "yes" or "no."

1186
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,623
Just relax and
respond naturally.

1187
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:05,721
(mouse clicks)

1188
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:06,822
Are you ready?

1189
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:07,855
Yes, sir.

1190
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,266
You can just answer
"yes" or "no."

1191
00:58:11,303 --> 00:58:12,668
(mouse clicks)

1192
00:58:12,705 --> 00:58:15,697
"Is your name
Jim Luther Davis?"

1193
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:17,402
Yes.

1194
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:20,037
"Do you live in Los Angeles?"

1195
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,570
Yes.

1196
00:58:22,615 --> 00:58:25,482
"Are you 26 years old?"

1197
00:58:25,518 --> 00:58:26,576
Yes.

1198
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,782
"Are you married?"

1199
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:31,619
No.

1200
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:35,352
(mouse clicks)

1201
00:58:35,394 --> 00:58:36,884
"Are you wearing shoes?"

1202
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:40,330
Yes.

1203
00:58:40,366 --> 00:58:43,426
"Have you ever smoked
marijuana?"

1204
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:47,769
Yes.

1205
00:58:47,806 --> 00:58:50,775
"Aside from the occasion you
mentioned in your application?"

1206
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:52,640
No.

1207
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:58,644
Jim, knock it off.

1208
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:01,816
What, sir?

1209
00:59:01,854 --> 00:59:03,913
Son, I've been doing
polygraph examinations

1210
00:59:04,023 --> 00:59:07,151
since you were swimming
in your daddy's balls.

1211
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:09,660
So I know all the tricks.

1212
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,287
You've either got a tack
in your shoe

1213
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,298
or you're clinching
your butt.

1214
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:16,130
I've got spikes
all over this thing.

1215
00:59:16,168 --> 00:59:19,331
If you do it again,

1216
00:59:19,371 --> 00:59:21,601
I'm going to void this test

1217
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,699
and report that you
were uncooperative.

1218
00:59:23,742 --> 00:59:25,073
Do you understand?

1219
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,873
Yes, sir.

1220
00:59:29,848 --> 00:59:31,611
Walk with me.

1221
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:35,050
We've got a problem, Jim.

1222
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:36,452
With what?

1223
00:59:36,488 --> 00:59:38,046
With your candor.

1224
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,114
(knocking on door)

1225
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,217
Come in.

1226
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,352
He's here, sir.

1227
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:44,055
Bring him in.

1228
00:59:46,031 --> 00:59:48,261
Jim, this is Mr. Hollenbeck,
our regional director.

1229
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,289
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1230
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,859
Have a seat.

1231
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:52,461
Mr. Gillespie.

1232
00:59:52,504 --> 00:59:54,870
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1233
00:59:57,209 --> 00:59:59,473
Jim, uh...

1234
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:00,773
you're an exemplary candidate

1235
01:00:00,813 --> 01:00:03,145
with valuable
operational experience.

1236
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,845
You've cleared the psych
and physical hurdles.

1237
01:00:06,885 --> 01:00:09,581
Your credit's good,
you've kept your nose clean,

1238
01:00:09,622 --> 01:00:11,089
you've got the Spanish.

1239
01:00:11,123 --> 01:00:12,420
You clearance is still valid.

1240
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,823
Everybody we talked to
for background

1241
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:16,760
had only great things
to say about you.

1242
01:00:16,795 --> 01:00:18,888
And then you scored a
negative-five on the polygraph.

1243
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:23,163
That's indicative
of deception.

1244
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,829
We were wondering why

1245
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,600
until we got the results
of urinalysis.

1246
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,406
We detected THC metabolites
in the urine, Jim.

1247
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,238
Levels were just below
the positive threshold,

1248
01:00:36,281 --> 01:00:38,875
but there was a presence.

1249
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:41,010
Do you have a drug
problem, Mr. Davis?

1250
01:00:41,086 --> 01:00:42,553
I don't have a
drug problem, sir.

1251
01:00:44,356 --> 01:00:46,916
I made a very
stupid mistake.

1252
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:48,290
Would you care to tell us
the circumstances

1253
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:49,453
of your stupid mistake?

1254
01:00:49,495 --> 01:00:51,520
I was at a party...

1255
01:00:51,563 --> 01:00:54,623
and someone offered me a joint.

1256
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:58,433
I was pretty angry
about not getting into

1257
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:02,372
the LAPD, so I was feeling
rebellious and, uh...

1258
01:01:05,377 --> 01:01:08,107
...I inaled.

1259
01:01:08,147 --> 01:01:10,775
Someone considering a career
in law enforcement

1260
01:01:10,816 --> 01:01:12,340
would be well advised
to exercise

1261
01:01:12,384 --> 01:01:13,976
a little more discipline.

1262
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:15,919
Yes, sir.

1263
01:01:17,322 --> 01:01:20,291
I'm on the fence, Doug.

1264
01:01:20,325 --> 01:01:21,815
It's your call.

1265
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,158
Mr. Davis, I'm in charge
of several programs.

1266
01:01:24,196 --> 01:01:26,164
Yes, sir?

1267
01:01:26,198 --> 01:01:29,099
Had a nice chat with your
old commanding officer.

1268
01:01:33,172 --> 01:01:35,572
(speaks Korean)

1269
01:01:35,607 --> 01:01:37,541
(speaks Korean)

1270
01:01:37,576 --> 01:01:39,339
Good.

1271
01:01:39,378 --> 01:01:40,675
Recognize these guys?

1272
01:01:44,316 --> 01:01:46,341
Huh?
Yeah,

1273
01:01:46,385 --> 01:01:47,409
they're your buddies.

1274
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,943
Your old Hajji buddies.

1275
01:01:49,054 --> 01:01:51,079
You should work in a deli
how you sliced these guys up.

1276
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:52,147
RICHARDS:
Jesus Christ.

1277
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:53,658
Oh, I'm sorry.

1278
01:01:53,692 --> 01:01:56,160
Did I ruin your lunch?

1279
01:01:56,195 --> 01:01:57,958
You went through
those sons of bitches

1280
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:00,055
like butter.

1281
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:01,657
I took my objective

1282
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,190
and did what was necessary

1283
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:06,261
to obtain information
vital to national security

1284
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:08,432
that saved
American lives.

1285
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,271
Whacked them all,
huh, Jim?

1286
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,573
My C.O. Told me not to leave
anything breathing.

1287
01:02:12,611 --> 01:02:14,476
- I do what I'm told.
- Relax, son.

1288
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:18,313
You were getting paid
to fuck people up.

1289
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:19,977
You know we're beefing up
our anti-narcotics programs

1290
01:02:20,018 --> 01:02:22,509
in Latin America.

1291
01:02:22,554 --> 01:02:23,646
Yes, sir.

1292
01:02:23,689 --> 01:02:26,487
I had heard some things
on the grapevine.

1293
01:02:26,525 --> 01:02:28,152
I want you on my team.

1294
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:29,990
I need someone who
can get things done

1295
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:31,825
on my task force
in Colombia.

1296
01:02:31,864 --> 01:02:34,230
Sir...

1297
01:02:34,266 --> 01:02:36,928
I listed Los Angeles and
San Diego on my dream sheet.

1298
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:38,732
No slots in southern California?

1299
01:02:38,771 --> 01:02:40,398
No, Jim.

1300
01:02:40,439 --> 01:02:41,463
I got Colombia.

1301
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,338
That's what
I have for you.

1302
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,343
If it's not
what you want,

1303
01:02:45,377 --> 01:02:46,366
thank you for your time.

1304
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:48,743
You can hit the door.

1305
01:02:50,382 --> 01:02:53,476
What exactly would I be doing?

1306
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,044
Running and gunning
in the jungle?

1307
01:02:56,088 --> 01:02:58,181
Mr. Davis,
this is the deal.

1308
01:02:58,223 --> 01:03:00,157
You'll be riding shotgun
with the locals

1309
01:03:00,192 --> 01:03:02,456
as interpreter-advisor
on sharp end operations.

1310
01:03:02,494 --> 01:03:03,927
You'll be in some
very hot areas.

1311
01:03:03,962 --> 01:03:05,759
How hot?

1312
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:07,265
We talking trigger time?

1313
01:03:07,299 --> 01:03:08,596
Sure, if you want.

1314
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:11,535
Well, who exactly
would I be working for?

1315
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,731
The U.S. Government, Jim.

1316
01:03:13,772 --> 01:03:16,536
I want you in Glynco,
Georgia next week.

1317
01:03:16,575 --> 01:03:18,736
You make it through
in one piece,

1318
01:03:18,777 --> 01:03:22,269
you'll be working Colombia's
finest by the summer.

1319
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:24,214
It's just that...

1320
01:03:24,249 --> 01:03:26,843
I'm supposed to get
married, sir.

1321
01:03:26,885 --> 01:03:28,876
Maybe now is not the time
to start a family.

1322
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:30,582
We've been together a long time.

1323
01:03:30,622 --> 01:03:32,988
I'm serious about marrying her.

1324
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:37,926
Foreign bride could jeopardize
your security clearance.

1325
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:42,696
Jim, don't shack up
with some Mexican.

1326
01:03:42,734 --> 01:03:46,135
Colombian broads are
smoking hot and knee deep.

1327
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:48,435
You get a per diem
and a driver.

1328
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:50,600
You'll live like
a fucking king down there.

1329
01:03:50,642 --> 01:03:51,631
Yes, sir, I understand.

1330
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:52,735
You take some time,

1331
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:54,177
think about what
you want to do.

1332
01:03:54,213 --> 01:03:55,271
This is a serious
commitment.

1333
01:03:59,384 --> 01:04:02,842
I want the opportunity, sir.

1334
01:04:02,888 --> 01:04:04,822
I want on board.

1335
01:04:09,761 --> 01:04:11,251
Welcome aboard.

1336
01:04:11,296 --> 01:04:12,786
I'm taking a big
chance on you.

1337
01:04:12,831 --> 01:04:13,889
Thank you, sir.

1338
01:04:13,932 --> 01:04:15,559
This is the career
I've dreamed of.

1339
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:16,966
These are your orders,

1340
01:04:17,035 --> 01:04:18,468
orientation material
and travel money.

1341
01:04:18,503 --> 01:04:22,405
Report to FLETC before the end
of working hours Wednesday.

1342
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,636
Thank you, sir.

1343
01:04:24,676 --> 01:04:25,802
God.

1344
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,995
Sorry, dog.

1345
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:53,931
I got the job.

1346
01:04:55,073 --> 01:04:56,904
Oh, shit.

1347
01:04:56,942 --> 01:04:59,502
Yeah?

1348
01:04:59,544 --> 01:05:01,637
Me, too.

1349
01:05:03,882 --> 01:05:06,248
- When do you start?
- Monday.

1350
01:05:06,285 --> 01:05:07,616
When do you start?

1351
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:08,881
Wednesday.

1352
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:12,357
Big Jim, back on
the mars payroll.

1353
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:15,155
Got the W-2

1354
01:05:15,193 --> 01:05:18,424
and the employee handbook
as proof of employment.

1355
01:05:18,463 --> 01:05:21,523
I will be back in the
arms of my woman tonight.

1356
01:05:21,566 --> 01:05:24,729
Good.

1357
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,204
Hey, we got to celebrate
this shit.

1358
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,767
Salud.

1359
01:05:33,445 --> 01:05:34,605
Oh, shit.

1360
01:05:38,617 --> 01:05:40,380
Fuzz.

1361
01:05:40,419 --> 01:05:42,250
They're on my ass, dog.

1362
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:45,085
And my license is suspended.

1363
01:05:45,123 --> 01:05:46,920
Yeah, maybe he's
after someone else.

1364
01:05:49,027 --> 01:05:51,222
Shit. Fucking shit, man.

1365
01:05:51,263 --> 01:05:53,424
He's pointing right at me.

1366
01:05:53,465 --> 01:05:55,524
And we got the open beers.

1367
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:58,468
Fuck the beers, the guns.

1368
01:05:58,503 --> 01:06:00,334
Shoot the fucker.

1369
01:06:00,372 --> 01:06:02,169
Car's in my name. We're fucked.

1370
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:08,941
Shit. Right when shit
was starting to go good, dude,

1371
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:10,071
I'm going to jail.

1372
01:06:10,115 --> 01:06:11,377
Damn it, I'm going to jail.

1373
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:15,210
I can dump these guys.

1374
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:18,447
Rip the video
from their trunk.

1375
01:06:24,129 --> 01:06:25,323
Let's see them hands.

1376
01:06:25,364 --> 01:06:26,388
Let's see your hands

1377
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,296
on the fucking dash!

1378
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:31,325
Grab the sky or I'll blow
your fucking heads off.

1379
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:33,565
Blink and die, scumbags.

1380
01:06:37,676 --> 01:06:39,371
Oh.

1381
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:41,276
Look who it is, dude.

1382
01:06:41,313 --> 01:06:42,871
It's all right,
I know these guys.

1383
01:06:42,914 --> 01:06:44,939
You fucking asshole.

1384
01:06:44,983 --> 01:06:46,917
You're such a prick.
You scared the fuck out of me.

1385
01:06:46,985 --> 01:06:50,250
What's up, homie?

1386
01:06:50,288 --> 01:06:52,916
- What's up, fool?
- What's up, man.

1387
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:55,482
I almost shot you, jerk.

1388
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:57,051
That shit wasrt fucking
funny, Leo.

1389
01:06:57,095 --> 01:06:58,084
Yeah, it was hilarious.

1390
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:00,826
You guys getting
fucked up?

1391
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:04,165
Of course, dog, it's Friday.

1392
01:07:04,202 --> 01:07:06,500
Well, Boot,
you in the Academy yet?

1393
01:07:06,538 --> 01:07:08,529
Fuck no.

1394
01:07:08,573 --> 01:07:09,870
Fuck the LAPD.

1395
01:07:09,908 --> 01:07:12,433
It's local small-time bullshit.

1396
01:07:12,477 --> 01:07:13,535
I'm going with the feds.

1397
01:07:13,578 --> 01:07:14,670
How'd you get that hook-up, dog?

1398
01:07:14,713 --> 01:07:16,840
You know, me, got my
connects, you know.

1399
01:07:16,882 --> 01:07:17,940
Going to FLETC on Wednesday.

1400
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,677
Hey, see you can
get me in there.

1401
01:07:19,718 --> 01:07:21,379
Yeah, I'll look into that.

1402
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,183
How's Sylvia?

1403
01:07:23,221 --> 01:07:25,416
None of your concern,
ass wipe.

1404
01:07:25,457 --> 01:07:27,755
Say hi to her for me, no?

1405
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,158
No.

1406
01:07:29,194 --> 01:07:32,789
This vato's all protective
of his female.

1407
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:34,958
Check this out.

1408
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:37,593
Nice, huh?

1409
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:40,127
It's a nine?
Uh-huh.

1410
01:07:40,172 --> 01:07:41,969
Sorry, dog, I got
a lot of nines.

1411
01:07:42,074 --> 01:07:43,598
Come on, dude,
it's a bad-ass Ruger.

1412
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:45,906
Talk to Toussaint.
He'll buy that shit.

1413
01:07:45,944 --> 01:07:47,878
Toussaint, he's...
he's in Florida.

1414
01:07:47,913 --> 01:07:50,438
He's back.
He called me today.

1415
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:54,841
Page me tonight, bro.

1416
01:07:54,886 --> 01:07:58,822
We'll hit the clubs and
tear up some fine hinas.

1417
01:07:58,857 --> 01:08:01,519
Later.
Sure, dog.

1418
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,027
I'm on the City's time.

1419
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:05,723
You guys be cool.

1420
01:08:05,764 --> 01:08:07,732
Okay?

1421
01:08:12,137 --> 01:08:13,832
That fuck...
he put a scare in me.

1422
01:08:13,872 --> 01:08:15,169
Yeah, me, too.

1423
01:08:15,207 --> 01:08:16,333
He's a dick.

1424
01:08:16,374 --> 01:08:18,069
Want to party with him?

1425
01:08:22,714 --> 01:08:25,205
See if this motherfucker's
home, dude.

1426
01:08:31,923 --> 01:08:36,792
Toussaint? Toussaint?!

1427
01:08:36,828 --> 01:08:37,920
Yo, Toussaint?

1428
01:08:37,963 --> 01:08:39,294
Yeah, come on, man.

1429
01:08:39,331 --> 01:08:43,165
Can't go far in that
little fucking place of yours.

1430
01:08:43,201 --> 01:08:45,328
Goddamnit,
I'm coming.

1431
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:47,167
Chill out.

1432
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,105
Washing that dirty ass.

1433
01:08:54,246 --> 01:08:56,237
Damn it.

1434
01:08:56,281 --> 01:08:58,909
Group love. Group... Come on.

1435
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:00,076
Group love, boys.

1436
01:09:00,118 --> 01:09:03,918
Welcome back, hometown.

1437
01:09:03,989 --> 01:09:07,390
Hey, I missed you
crazy fuckers, man.

1438
01:09:07,425 --> 01:09:08,915
Leo told us
you were back.

1439
01:09:08,994 --> 01:09:11,155
Thanks for calling
asshole.

1440
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,036
You a cop?

1441
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:20,401
Uh-uh. Going federal.

1442
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,606
Man, craziest head I know

1443
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:25,769
is going

1444
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:26,777
to be a fed.

1445
01:09:26,811 --> 01:09:30,042
Yes, sir! Sir.

1446
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:31,776
Still sponging off your woman?

1447
01:09:31,816 --> 01:09:34,216
Fuck you, dog. I got a job.

1448
01:09:34,252 --> 01:09:35,276
This motherfucker.

1449
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,754
Look, dude.

1450
01:09:39,257 --> 01:09:41,282
This is bad.

1451
01:09:41,326 --> 01:09:43,851
It's yours for three
big ones, dog.

1452
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:47,888
Fuck yeah, I want it.

1453
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:51,528
What's up?
What's up?

1454
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,265
Huh?

1455
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:55,705
What the fuck you
say now, huh?

1456
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,298
Hey. Huh?

1457
01:09:57,342 --> 01:09:59,970
Bam, bam, bam.

1458
01:10:00,045 --> 01:10:02,980
Motherfucker,
I'm strapped.

1459
01:10:03,048 --> 01:10:05,380
What the fuck
is up now, huh?

1460
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:07,180
Whoo-ooh!

1461
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:08,379
Whoa, whoa.

1462
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,944
Your kneecap and shit.

1463
01:10:09,988 --> 01:10:14,357
Step up and get blasted.

1464
01:10:14,392 --> 01:10:18,351
Shit, man, what
the fuck is up now?

1465
01:10:18,396 --> 01:10:20,261
Hey, kick back, gunslinger.

1466
01:10:20,298 --> 01:10:21,287
It's loaded.

1467
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:22,595
That shit goes through walls.

1468
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:23,828
You pop the neighbor's
little kids.

1469
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:25,096
(cocks gun, bullets clinking)

1470
01:10:25,136 --> 01:10:26,296
Uh-oh.

1471
01:10:26,338 --> 01:10:27,600
Ooh.

1472
01:10:28,573 --> 01:10:31,440
Fuck, dude.

1473
01:10:31,476 --> 01:10:34,536
Whoa, I'm straight, bro.

1474
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:38,811
Yo, guys, we got
to party tonight, you know?

1475
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:40,613
Go clubbir or something.

1476
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:41,949
I got a better idea.

1477
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:42,976
What?

1478
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,010
Here, sir.

1479
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:47,959
Let's go to Mexico.

1480
01:10:48,059 --> 01:10:49,651
Mexico?!

1481
01:10:49,694 --> 01:10:51,719
- Yeah.
- I'm in.

1482
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,498
Only fags like that...

1483
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,469
Because you're a little faggot.

1484
01:10:59,504 --> 01:11:00,971
I don't get it,
too much fucking hills.

1485
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,098
Right, right.

1486
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,473
Dude, yo, dude, stay back boy,
stay back.

1487
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:07,876
Motherfucker's got to ask
permission.

1488
01:11:07,912 --> 01:11:10,779
Fuck you, all right?

1489
01:11:10,815 --> 01:11:12,578
Let me tell
you something.

1490
01:11:12,617 --> 01:11:14,642
I am a grown motherfucking man,
all right?

1491
01:11:14,686 --> 01:11:16,381
I'm going to tell her
the good news,

1492
01:11:16,421 --> 01:11:18,719
make up, grab my shit
and we are out.

1493
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:21,191
REPORTER:
Lines, lines, and more lines.

1494
01:11:21,226 --> 01:11:23,558
For many passengers
traveling through LAX,

1495
01:11:23,595 --> 01:11:25,688
the waiting has become
unbearable.

1496
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:27,163
It's hit or miss,
you can't predict it...

1497
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:30,167
Excuse me, you're not
made out of glass.

1498
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:31,190
I'm made out of me.

1499
01:11:31,236 --> 01:11:33,864
You're drunk.

1500
01:11:33,905 --> 01:11:35,395
I'm celebrating, baby.

1501
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,771
What, another wasted day?

1502
01:11:38,643 --> 01:11:40,304
Here.

1503
01:11:40,345 --> 01:11:42,711
...Security since 9-11,
but that's true everywhere.

1504
01:11:42,747 --> 01:11:45,875
...and still a recent study shows
the wait at LAX

1505
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:47,441
is the third longest
in the world...

1506
01:11:51,256 --> 01:11:52,621
This is a good company.

1507
01:11:52,657 --> 01:11:54,887
They make all
the new condos downtown.

1508
01:11:54,926 --> 01:11:55,893
How much?

1509
01:11:55,927 --> 01:11:56,951
$12 an hour.

1510
01:11:56,995 --> 01:11:57,962
Plus their MIS guy

1511
01:11:57,996 --> 01:11:59,156
is leaving in three months.

1512
01:11:59,197 --> 01:12:00,960
I'm going to update
my certifications

1513
01:12:00,999 --> 01:12:02,227
and take his job over.

1514
01:12:02,267 --> 01:12:03,393
Then I'll make bank.

1515
01:12:06,938 --> 01:12:08,667
Such an asshole.

1516
01:12:08,707 --> 01:12:10,641
What? Why?
This shit is real.

1517
01:12:10,675 --> 01:12:12,643
This is a great job,
the pay is outstanding

1518
01:12:12,677 --> 01:12:15,578
and it's a great opportunity
for me to do what I want to do.

1519
01:12:15,613 --> 01:12:17,342
I know.

1520
01:12:17,382 --> 01:12:20,545
It's so... it's so Mike,
you know.

1521
01:12:20,585 --> 01:12:22,780
You can't just go out
and get a shitty job.

1522
01:12:22,821 --> 01:12:24,220
You gotta... you gotta get a...

1523
01:12:24,255 --> 01:12:25,222
A dream job?

1524
01:12:25,256 --> 01:12:26,587
Yeah, a dream job.

1525
01:12:26,624 --> 01:12:29,559
Well, why shouldn't your
dream guy have a dream job?

1526
01:12:29,594 --> 01:12:31,619
...the ambitious plans
of many opponents

1527
01:12:31,663 --> 01:12:34,598
on the County Board
of Supervisors...

1528
01:12:42,073 --> 01:12:44,473
Come here, I have a job for you.

1529
01:12:48,713 --> 01:12:52,513
# Da-da-da-da, doo-rup #

1530
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:55,883
# Da-da-da-da.
Doo-rup. #

1531
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,081
What the fuck
is taking so long?

1532
01:12:58,123 --> 01:12:59,613
I knew this
shit would happen.

1533
01:12:59,657 --> 01:13:00,954
She hates my ass.

1534
01:13:00,992 --> 01:13:03,256
She's not going
to let him go.

1535
01:13:03,294 --> 01:13:05,125
Go knock.

1536
01:13:06,731 --> 01:13:09,325
Dude, go knock.

1537
01:13:09,367 --> 01:13:13,770
Bro, drag his fucking
ass out of there.

1538
01:13:21,012 --> 01:13:22,502
Yo, Miguel.

1539
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,474
Hey.

1540
01:13:27,519 --> 01:13:30,420
Mike, hurry up.

1541
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,488
Hey.

1542
01:13:33,525 --> 01:13:35,356
Yo, what the fuck
are you doing?

1543
01:13:35,393 --> 01:13:36,724
Come on, dude.

1544
01:13:36,761 --> 01:13:38,854
Dog, I'm tearir

1545
01:13:38,897 --> 01:13:41,229
I'm hittir it, bro.
It's been a few days.

1546
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:43,894
You guys just go ahead, man.
I'm gonna chill.

1547
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,300
What?

1548
01:13:45,336 --> 01:13:47,827
I'm just gonna kick it here
with the woman.

1549
01:13:47,872 --> 01:13:50,500
You said you'd go, man.

1550
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:52,134
Your womars in your head.

1551
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:53,144
That's wrong.

1552
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:54,509
She's got your nuts, bro.

1553
01:13:54,546 --> 01:13:56,446
Dog, dog...

1554
01:13:56,481 --> 01:13:59,473
Sylvia's all happy 'cause I
got a job, all right, dude?

1555
01:13:59,517 --> 01:14:01,348
She wants us to
fuckir chill together.

1556
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:04,947
Man, that girl put
the zap on your head.

1557
01:14:05,056 --> 01:14:06,580
This is our last
chance to hang.

1558
01:14:06,624 --> 01:14:09,957
- You're like my brother.
- Yeah.

1559
01:14:10,061 --> 01:14:11,653
You're all I got.
You're gonna dog me like that?

1560
01:14:11,696 --> 01:14:12,958
I ain't no fucking do...

1561
01:14:13,064 --> 01:14:15,191
How are you, baby?

1562
01:14:15,233 --> 01:14:17,394
Hey, Sylvia, he's
going to Mexico.

1563
01:14:17,435 --> 01:14:20,734
No, he isn't, Jim.
Yes, he is.

1564
01:14:20,772 --> 01:14:24,765
I'm joining the feds. I'm gone,
I'm out of here next week.

1565
01:14:24,809 --> 01:14:26,367
The least
you can do

1566
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:27,776
is let my best friend

1567
01:14:27,812 --> 01:14:29,109
see me off.

1568
01:14:29,147 --> 01:14:30,273
Baby, it's not safe.

1569
01:14:30,315 --> 01:14:31,782
All you're going
to do is drink.

1570
01:14:31,816 --> 01:14:33,784
Aw, fuck, man.

1571
01:14:33,818 --> 01:14:35,547
Mike, come on.

1572
01:14:35,587 --> 01:14:37,418
Come on, fuck, man!

1573
01:14:37,455 --> 01:14:39,252
Come on,
you promised.

1574
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:40,848
You promised, man.

1575
01:14:40,892 --> 01:14:46,023
Yo... I promised,
Sylvia, okay?

1576
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,929
Mike, you're not
going to Mexico.

1577
01:14:47,966 --> 01:14:49,695
What?

1578
01:14:49,734 --> 01:14:51,201
You're not going.

1579
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:54,399
I'm not your fucking
puppet, Sylvia.

1580
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:56,805
All right, you know what,
do what you want.

1581
01:14:56,841 --> 01:14:59,105
But I'm not going to be
here when you get back.

1582
01:14:59,143 --> 01:15:00,303
That's fucked up.

1583
01:15:00,345 --> 01:15:02,370
Why you got to lay
that bullshit on him?

1584
01:15:02,413 --> 01:15:04,278
Because I don't want him
going with you, Jim.

1585
01:15:04,315 --> 01:15:06,306
You're fucking nuts.

1586
01:15:06,351 --> 01:15:08,615
You're crazy
and you're dangerous,

1587
01:15:08,653 --> 01:15:10,553
and my biggest nightmare
is you with a fucking badge.

1588
01:15:10,588 --> 01:15:12,078
You're the last person
who should have one.

1589
01:15:12,123 --> 01:15:13,090
Yeah?
Yeah.

1590
01:15:13,124 --> 01:15:14,250
That's not bullshit,
it's the truth.

1591
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:15,554
Fuck this!

1592
01:15:15,593 --> 01:15:16,685
Whoa, wait.

1593
01:15:16,728 --> 01:15:18,218
Whatever, man.

1594
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:20,731
Fuckir thanks, homie!

1595
01:15:20,765 --> 01:15:21,891
Yeah, laters.

1596
01:15:21,933 --> 01:15:24,299
Bye.

1597
01:15:24,335 --> 01:15:25,666
Yo, yo.

1598
01:15:25,703 --> 01:15:27,000
I'm going.

1599
01:15:28,473 --> 01:15:29,440
I gotta go.

1600
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:31,101
Get the fuck out
of here, go!

1601
01:15:32,443 --> 01:15:33,171
Go!

1602
01:15:33,211 --> 01:15:34,974
Fuck this shit, man.

1603
01:15:35,013 --> 01:15:36,310
Good night, Sylvia.

1604
01:15:36,347 --> 01:15:37,439
Kiss my ass, Jim.

1605
01:15:37,482 --> 01:15:39,473
Oh, any time, sellout.

1606
01:15:39,517 --> 01:15:42,179
Oh, you going to be happy
once he's dead? Huh?

1607
01:15:51,129 --> 01:15:52,426
Hey, Toussaint.

1608
01:15:52,463 --> 01:15:54,158
I heard the battle, man.

1609
01:15:54,198 --> 01:15:56,462
Yo, your lady didn't
want you going, huh?

1610
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:57,934
No, but I'm going.

1611
01:15:57,969 --> 01:15:59,493
- Hell, yeah.
- Shit.

1612
01:15:59,537 --> 01:16:01,095
- I'm a motherfucking man.
- That's right.

1613
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:03,164
Shit. I walk
the Earth at will.

1614
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:05,107
- Damn right.
- I do whatever the fuck I want.

1615
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,167
You know, we're men, right?

1616
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:07,438
- We're men, right?
- That's right.

1617
01:16:07,478 --> 01:16:08,706
That's what we do, right?

1618
01:16:08,746 --> 01:16:10,373
Amen. And don't worry...

1619
01:16:10,415 --> 01:16:12,645
home girl will be right there
waiting when you get back.

1620
01:16:12,684 --> 01:16:13,810
You're right. You're right.

1621
01:16:13,851 --> 01:16:15,045
She wouldn't play
that shit like that.

1622
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:16,451
Shit, I got a fucking job
for real.

1623
01:16:16,487 --> 01:16:17,385
You did.

1624
01:16:17,422 --> 01:16:18,946
Plus you're my homie, dog.
You're my homie.

1625
01:16:19,057 --> 01:16:20,615
You're going to go fucking
do your thing

1626
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:22,421
- and this is it.
- No, shit, dude.

1627
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:23,484
Yo, we're all dogs.

1628
01:16:23,528 --> 01:16:24,825
I got you guys
back, man.

1629
01:16:24,862 --> 01:16:25,954
No doubt,
no doubt.

1630
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:27,691
It's just going to be
fucking cool, yo.

1631
01:16:27,732 --> 01:16:29,427
I got a job,
you got a job.

1632
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:30,957
Shit, I got some bud.

1633
01:16:31,069 --> 01:16:32,331
- We got some smokes.
- We got some

1634
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,065
- motherfucking money.
- We are on a mission.

1635
01:16:34,105 --> 01:16:37,074
Let's get our heads together
so we can achieve our objective

1636
01:16:37,108 --> 01:16:38,234
in a timely manner.

1637
01:16:38,276 --> 01:16:40,870
Let's get deployed, people.

1638
01:17:06,104 --> 01:17:08,129
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1639
01:17:08,172 --> 01:17:09,298
Rise and fucking shine.

1640
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:11,865
Come on, ladies.
Chow time.

1641
01:17:11,909 --> 01:17:13,069
Chow's getting cold.

1642
01:17:13,111 --> 01:17:16,103
MIKE: Oh, what the fuck, Jim?
Chill, dude.

1643
01:17:31,663 --> 01:17:33,255
Dude, where are we?

1644
01:17:33,297 --> 01:17:36,266
Family, man.

1645
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,892
Damn!
It's a shizzack...

1646
01:17:37,935 --> 01:17:38,902
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1647
01:17:38,936 --> 01:17:41,404
It's a home, all right?

1648
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:43,634
Respect, bro.

1649
01:17:43,675 --> 01:17:45,506
Straighten up, fellas.

1650
01:17:48,946 --> 01:17:50,811
My old lady, Marta.

1651
01:17:50,848 --> 01:17:51,815
Hola.

1652
01:17:51,849 --> 01:17:53,043
Mike.
Hola, mucho gusto.

1653
01:17:53,084 --> 01:17:54,517
Hola, Mike.
Toussaint.

1654
01:17:54,552 --> 01:17:56,019
Hola. Hola. Hola.

1655
01:17:56,054 --> 01:17:57,646
Hola. Marisa.

1656
01:17:57,689 --> 01:17:58,781
Buenos dias. Mi mama.

1657
01:17:58,823 --> 01:17:59,790
Mucho gusto. Marta's mom.

1658
01:17:59,824 --> 01:18:01,758
Buenos dias.

1659
01:18:01,793 --> 01:18:03,090
Vicki.
Vicki.

1660
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:05,027
La prima, esa es mi prima.

1661
01:18:05,063 --> 01:18:06,189
Mucho gusto.

1662
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:07,424
Mucho gusto. Mike. Vicki.

1663
01:18:07,465 --> 01:18:09,160
Toussaint.

1664
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,360
Vicki.

1665
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:11,891
Okay.
(chuckles)

1666
01:18:11,936 --> 01:18:13,403
Hey, grab yourselves a rock.

1667
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:15,167
Si, por favor, sientense.

1668
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:18,509
MARTA:
Vicki?

1669
01:18:18,543 --> 01:18:20,238
/ Cafe, quieren cafe?

1670
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:22,178
Si, cafe, por favor.
Vicki, andale.

1671
01:18:22,213 --> 01:18:24,443
Tranquila, baby.

1672
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:27,117
(laughs)

1673
01:18:27,151 --> 01:18:28,641
Mama!

1674
01:18:28,686 --> 01:18:30,813
Yeah, w-what's
she saying, dude?

1675
01:18:30,855 --> 01:18:32,880
Oh, they... they
think you're cool.

1676
01:18:32,924 --> 01:18:34,050
Oh, sweet.

1677
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,191
Aqui tienes. Gracias.

1678
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:40,527
- Caliente.
- (whispers): Thank you.

1679
01:18:44,402 --> 01:18:45,562
Dude...

1680
01:18:45,603 --> 01:18:47,070
Marta's fine as fuck, bro.

1681
01:18:47,105 --> 01:18:48,299
Hey, hey, hey...

1682
01:18:48,339 --> 01:18:50,364
I'm just saying, dude.
You need to marry her, bro.

1683
01:18:50,408 --> 01:18:52,740
If you don't,
you're a fool.

1684
01:18:52,777 --> 01:18:54,870
/ Que dice?

1685
01:18:54,912 --> 01:18:57,881
Oh...

1686
01:18:57,915 --> 01:19:00,008
- Oh, that shit's good, man.
- (Spanish rock song plays)

1687
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:02,542
No shit, you know they got that
good fucking weed from here.

1688
01:19:02,587 --> 01:19:05,522
That's what I want.
Some of that good shit.

1689
01:19:05,556 --> 01:19:07,922
You know where some fields
are or something, Jim?

1690
01:19:08,025 --> 01:19:10,493
Yeah, that's not... I want to
see, like, where they grow it.

1691
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:11,654
You know, and then maybe

1692
01:19:11,696 --> 01:19:13,755
they'll let us go out
and, like, pick some.

1693
01:19:13,798 --> 01:19:15,925
You know, pick some of
that really good weed.

1694
01:19:26,577 --> 01:19:27,805
Shit.

1695
01:19:33,217 --> 01:19:34,206
MIKE:
Toussaint?

1696
01:19:39,056 --> 01:19:41,047
This is nice.

1697
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:43,390
This is beautiful, man.

1698
01:19:43,427 --> 01:19:44,519
Dog, you see this?

1699
01:19:44,562 --> 01:19:46,860
Here.

1700
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:49,255
Mmm...

1701
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,426
Beautiful...

1702
01:19:50,468 --> 01:19:51,730
Man!

1703
01:19:51,769 --> 01:19:53,168
Mmm!

1704
01:19:53,204 --> 01:19:55,331
When the hell'd you get
all the pistos, dog?

1705
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:56,601
Mexico, man.

1706
01:19:56,641 --> 01:19:57,630
It's magic.

1707
01:20:01,879 --> 01:20:02,971
TOUSSAINT:
He bleed?

1708
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:03,978
JIM:
Like a stuffed pig.

1709
01:20:05,149 --> 01:20:06,980
How'd Letty know you were
tearing up her sister?

1710
01:20:07,051 --> 01:20:09,542
That fuckir bitch Patti, right?

1711
01:20:09,587 --> 01:20:11,248
- Ah...
- I took her to dinner.

1712
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:13,587
Took her for a cruise
up to Malibu, you know?

1713
01:20:13,624 --> 01:20:16,286
Got up all in it.
Back of my ride...

1714
01:20:16,327 --> 01:20:17,988
Pounded that fish, man.

1715
01:20:18,062 --> 01:20:19,393
Good fuckir fish.

1716
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:20,556
I figured the crazy broad

1717
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:21,895
pulled out some hairs and pubes

1718
01:20:21,933 --> 01:20:23,628
and stashed it in the seat,
you know?

1719
01:20:23,668 --> 01:20:26,262
Oh, dude, you got to watch that
shit, man.

1720
01:20:26,304 --> 01:20:28,602
Chicks get treacherous.

1721
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,233
Yeah, no shit.
Sibling rivalry, Jim.

1722
01:20:31,275 --> 01:20:32,640
(chuckles):
Next day,

1723
01:20:32,677 --> 01:20:35,111
I'm driving around with Letty
all kick back and shit,

1724
01:20:35,146 --> 01:20:38,513
and she radars in
on this rat's nest, man.

1725
01:20:38,549 --> 01:20:41,313
Pulls out these long-ass hairs,
she's like "What are these?"

1726
01:20:41,352 --> 01:20:42,319
"Whose are these?"

1727
01:20:43,888 --> 01:20:46,948
She sees all the pubes mixed in,
man... fuckir busted.

1728
01:20:47,058 --> 01:20:48,958
Busted!
(singsong voice): Busted!

1729
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,254
Oh!

1730
01:20:50,294 --> 01:20:52,626
Dude, how'd she know
they were her sister's?

1731
01:20:52,663 --> 01:20:54,130
Oh, come on, dude.

1732
01:20:54,165 --> 01:20:55,723
Mexican chick voodoo,
right, Mike?

1733
01:20:55,766 --> 01:20:57,233
You know,
live and learn.

1734
01:20:57,268 --> 01:20:59,759
Yep, next time you'll be all up
in your ride

1735
01:20:59,804 --> 01:21:01,635
with the Super
Vac, dude.
Treachery!

1736
01:21:01,672 --> 01:21:03,697
Yep, treachery.

1737
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:06,432
(horse snorts)

1738
01:21:09,714 --> 01:21:11,773
Um...

1739
01:21:11,816 --> 01:21:13,511
shouldn't we be

1740
01:21:13,551 --> 01:21:14,779
helping them?

1741
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:16,286
You know how to hand wash?

1742
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,912
- No.
- Then don't sweat it.

1743
01:21:17,955 --> 01:21:18,979
Yeah, we're men.

1744
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:20,580
They know we don't do that shit.

1745
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:21,557
That's right.

1746
01:21:21,592 --> 01:21:22,923
We're men.

1747
01:21:24,795 --> 01:21:26,126
Oh, yeah!

1748
01:21:29,367 --> 01:21:30,595
This is paradise, huh?

1749
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:31,966
Mm-hmm.

1750
01:21:33,804 --> 01:21:35,396
Yo, Mike?

1751
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:36,906
Yeah?

1752
01:21:36,941 --> 01:21:38,169
They're sending me to Colombia.

1753
01:21:43,848 --> 01:21:46,612
Colombia.

1754
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:48,243
Who, the man?

1755
01:21:48,286 --> 01:21:50,220
Yep.

1756
01:21:50,254 --> 01:21:52,449
They're tearing shit up down
there, they need my help.

1757
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:54,287
Doing what?

1758
01:21:54,325 --> 01:21:56,225
Busting up drug labs
and drug lords

1759
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,955
- and all that shit.
- You got it.

1760
01:21:57,995 --> 01:22:00,429
Gonna be an advisor, you know...
shoot him, him and him.

1761
01:22:00,464 --> 01:22:02,625
Then it's back to the barracks
for bitches and beer.

1762
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,464
I'm set.

1763
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:06,663
Why do you want to do
that shit, dude?

1764
01:22:06,704 --> 01:22:08,262
I mean...

1765
01:22:08,306 --> 01:22:11,639
what about Marta, you know?

1766
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:12,700
I mean...

1767
01:22:12,743 --> 01:22:14,677
Ain't gonna happen.

1768
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:17,146
They told me not to get married.

1769
01:22:17,181 --> 01:22:19,115
TOUSSAINT:
That's messed.

1770
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,208
They really told you that?

1771
01:22:20,251 --> 01:22:21,980
Not straight up,
but I heard 'em.

1772
01:22:22,019 --> 01:22:24,817
Yo, if the feds won't let you
hook up with your old lady,

1773
01:22:24,855 --> 01:22:26,550
you need to tell them
to fuck off.

1774
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:27,989
Yeah, I mean,

1775
01:22:28,059 --> 01:22:30,721
you love her,
she loves you, right?

1776
01:22:30,761 --> 01:22:33,389
Dude, you need to move
down here, marry Marta,

1777
01:22:33,431 --> 01:22:34,898
you know, get a good-ass job

1778
01:22:34,932 --> 01:22:37,526
working with fucking
tourists or something.

1779
01:22:37,568 --> 01:22:38,933
Fuck that.

1780
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:41,234
Taking bucket baths
in cold-ass water?

1781
01:22:41,272 --> 01:22:43,103
You know, wading around
in ankle-deep mud?

1782
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,129
Outhouses, man!

1783
01:22:44,175 --> 01:22:46,143
Fuckir outhouses!

1784
01:22:46,177 --> 01:22:48,236
You told Marta yet?

1785
01:22:52,116 --> 01:22:53,743
You love this place.

1786
01:22:53,784 --> 01:22:57,083
It's in your eyes, man.

1787
01:22:57,121 --> 01:22:59,555
Dude, this is
what it's all about.

1788
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:03,822
You got a woman that loves
you and a place to stay.

1789
01:23:03,861 --> 01:23:05,488
You'd be happy here,
and you know it.

1790
01:23:05,529 --> 01:23:09,829
Yeah, well,
shacking up with Marta,

1791
01:23:09,867 --> 01:23:14,964
squeezing out some puppies,
has its appeal, but...

1792
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:18,338
this is my career.

1793
01:23:18,376 --> 01:23:20,344
I got one shot.

1794
01:23:20,378 --> 01:23:21,970
You're making
a mistake.

1795
01:23:22,046 --> 01:23:26,779
You should stay right
here with your lady.

1796
01:23:26,817 --> 01:23:28,182
What the fuck you gonna do

1797
01:23:28,219 --> 01:23:30,084
in Colombia?

1798
01:23:32,323 --> 01:23:34,257
Whack people,

1799
01:23:34,291 --> 01:23:35,553
program shit.

1800
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:38,187
You ain't down, fuck you.

1801
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:40,129
Bring in my gunships

1802
01:23:40,164 --> 01:23:43,224
and smoke your little jungle
hideaway. You know?

1803
01:23:43,267 --> 01:23:44,894
I mean, I'm a solider
of the apocalypse, man.

1804
01:23:44,935 --> 01:23:46,129
I'll be in a chopper,

1805
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:49,867
door-gunning villagers
and shit. Fuck 'em.

1806
01:23:49,907 --> 01:23:52,774
Kill the chickens
and dogs, too, man.

1807
01:23:54,111 --> 01:23:56,636
I don't give a fuck.

1808
01:24:08,526 --> 01:24:09,652
Shh, shh...

1809
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:31,441
Yeah.

1810
01:24:54,305 --> 01:24:57,240
(speaking indigenous language)

1811
01:26:01,705 --> 01:26:02,831
MIKE:
Doce anos.

1812
01:26:02,873 --> 01:26:04,465
- Doce anos.
- JIM: Doce anos...

1813
01:26:04,508 --> 01:26:06,738
Doce... we've been
together that long.

1814
01:26:06,777 --> 01:26:08,039
Es muy bonita.

1815
01:26:08,078 --> 01:26:09,375
Man, you're bring sand
to the beach, dumb ass.

1816
01:26:09,413 --> 01:26:11,643
- Cover that shit up.
- TOUSSAINT: Jim, dude!

1817
01:26:11,682 --> 01:26:12,876
Huh?

1818
01:26:12,917 --> 01:26:15,317
How you say, um, "You're
beautiful" in Spanish?

1819
01:26:15,352 --> 01:26:16,944
Huh? "Bonita."
Bonita.

1820
01:26:19,356 --> 01:26:21,586
Come on, you don't know
that shit, Toussaint?

1821
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:23,388
Tu... bonita.

1822
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:24,553
VICKl:
Gracias.

1823
01:26:24,595 --> 01:26:26,085
MIKE:
Hey, baby, see my new one?

1824
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:27,427
- Right, did I get it?
- Huh?

1825
01:26:27,464 --> 01:26:28,692
Think I got it?

1826
01:26:28,732 --> 01:26:31,860
Yeah, she got the point.

1827
01:26:35,005 --> 01:26:38,441
Yo, Mike, that chick digs you.

1828
01:26:38,475 --> 01:26:40,306
What chick?

1829
01:26:41,845 --> 01:26:43,870
MIKE:
Oh, she's good, dog.

1830
01:26:43,914 --> 01:26:46,109
Yeah, name's Lila.

1831
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:48,175
She's a freak.
She'll fuck you, dude.

1832
01:26:49,687 --> 01:26:51,450
She's a freak, huh?

1833
01:26:51,488 --> 01:26:53,149
How you know? You fuck her?

1834
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:55,249
No, out of respect
for Marta.

1835
01:26:55,292 --> 01:26:58,420
Not that I don't want...
Hey, baby.

1836
01:26:58,462 --> 01:27:01,920
Ask her to dance.

1837
01:27:02,032 --> 01:27:04,125
I'm not cheating
on Sylvia, dude.

1838
01:27:04,168 --> 01:27:05,829
(song ends,
partygoers applaud)

1839
01:27:05,869 --> 01:27:09,134
There's a big gap between
dancing and fucking, man.

1840
01:27:09,173 --> 01:27:11,038
Go explore it.

1841
01:27:12,243 --> 01:27:13,870
No shit.

1842
01:27:23,087 --> 01:27:27,114
Whoo!

1843
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,438
No.

1844
01:30:16,026 --> 01:30:17,618
You're fucking nuts.

1845
01:31:24,394 --> 01:31:26,589
You fucked up, woman.

1846
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:30,200
I'll do it.

1847
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:33,135
(speaking Spanish)

1848
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:36,929
It's easy.

1849
01:31:53,991 --> 01:31:55,754
Jim!

1850
01:31:55,792 --> 01:31:57,384
Jim!

1851
01:32:22,152 --> 01:32:24,120
What's up, man, huh?

1852
01:32:24,154 --> 01:32:25,644
Where's Toussaint?

1853
01:32:25,689 --> 01:32:27,122
He's dancing.

1854
01:32:27,157 --> 01:32:28,124
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1855
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:29,125
- You gonna get back

1856
01:32:29,159 --> 01:32:30,285
to the party?
- Yeah.

1857
01:32:30,327 --> 01:32:32,522
Let's get back
to the party, man.

1858
01:32:34,031 --> 01:32:35,896
- Yeah.
- Hey, uh, go,

1859
01:32:35,933 --> 01:32:37,560
go tell Toussaint that

1860
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:39,159
we're gonna get the
fuck out of here, man.

1861
01:32:39,202 --> 01:32:40,829
Just go into the party,
tell him we're gonna go.

1862
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:41,838
We're leaving, huh?

1863
01:32:41,872 --> 01:32:43,339
Yeah, yeah, we're
gonna leave.

1864
01:32:43,373 --> 01:32:45,000
Let's go, yeah?

1865
01:32:45,042 --> 01:32:46,168
Yeah, let's go.

1866
01:32:46,209 --> 01:32:47,574
Go ahead, go get
Toussaint, man.

1867
01:32:47,611 --> 01:32:48,635
Go get him.

1868
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:58,217
Hey, we're going.

1869
01:32:58,255 --> 01:32:59,222
Come on.

1870
01:32:59,256 --> 01:33:00,223
Fuck you, dude.

1871
01:33:00,257 --> 01:33:02,282
I'm having a
great time, bro.

1872
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:04,351
Then walk back to L.A.,
motherfucker.

1873
01:33:04,394 --> 01:33:05,827
You're in the car or not.

1874
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,834
He's fucking crazy, man.
What the fuck!

1875
01:33:11,868 --> 01:33:14,860
All right,
let's go, man.

1876
01:33:16,607 --> 01:33:19,075
Hey, yo, what the fuck
is your problem, psycho?!

1877
01:33:19,109 --> 01:33:20,838
Hey, hey, homeboy's
losing it, all right?

1878
01:33:20,877 --> 01:33:23,869
Shut the fuck up and just
get in the car, all right?

1879
01:33:23,914 --> 01:33:24,972
Fucking bullshit!

1880
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:28,748
TOUSSAINT:
Fucked up!

1881
01:33:57,814 --> 01:34:01,250
Dude, dude... dude, slow down.

1882
01:34:04,621 --> 01:34:06,179
Fuck, man.

1883
01:34:06,223 --> 01:34:09,784
Whoo, yeah, man.

1884
01:34:09,826 --> 01:34:11,453
Slow down,
you crazy motherfucker!

1885
01:34:11,495 --> 01:34:14,259
I want a cop to pull me over.

1886
01:34:15,832 --> 01:34:18,062
JIM:
Treachery.

1887
01:34:18,101 --> 01:34:19,966
Fucking treachery.

1888
01:34:20,003 --> 01:34:22,301
Jim, slow down!

1889
01:34:22,339 --> 01:34:23,465
Shut up!

1890
01:34:24,641 --> 01:34:26,040
Fuck, dude.

1891
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:29,074
Only female I trust.

1892
01:34:31,181 --> 01:34:32,978
Fuck you, God!

1893
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:36,610
You ain't got the fucking balls
to take my ass.

1894
01:34:38,188 --> 01:34:41,646
Jim, don't say that shit, dude.

1895
01:34:56,807 --> 01:34:57,933
Jim!

1896
01:35:00,911 --> 01:35:04,540
Dude, you are getting
out of control, okay?

1897
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:07,106
You need psychiatric
help, man.

1898
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:10,415
You're seriously
fucked up, dude.

1899
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:15,949
All right, you need to sue
the military or something.

1900
01:35:15,992 --> 01:35:17,687
You used to be mellow.

1901
01:35:21,031 --> 01:35:22,328
Later, homie.

1902
01:35:22,365 --> 01:35:24,128
'Night, dog.

1903
01:35:24,167 --> 01:35:26,362
Laters.

1904
01:35:26,403 --> 01:35:28,371
Dude, I ain't hanging
around you anymore

1905
01:35:28,405 --> 01:35:29,702
until you get
some fucking help.

1906
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:32,470
You can 12-step off, bitch.

1907
01:35:32,509 --> 01:35:34,773
You're dismissed.

1908
01:35:47,557 --> 01:35:49,354
He's right, dude.

1909
01:35:49,392 --> 01:35:50,381
Yeah.

1910
01:35:53,363 --> 01:35:55,854
Georgia will get me
squared away.

1911
01:35:55,899 --> 01:35:58,732
Hope so.

1912
01:35:58,769 --> 01:36:02,227
What was that shit
with Marta, dude?

1913
01:36:02,272 --> 01:36:07,005
I don't know why that happened.

1914
01:36:09,146 --> 01:36:11,307
But I'm cool.
I'm cool now.

1915
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:13,179
Okay?

1916
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:16,085
Yeah.

1917
01:36:16,119 --> 01:36:17,780
I'm cool.

1918
01:36:28,832 --> 01:36:31,164
Look, dude, she told me
she was pregnant.

1919
01:36:31,201 --> 01:36:32,964
I had a panic attack.

1920
01:36:33,036 --> 01:36:34,094
I pulled my gun.

1921
01:36:34,137 --> 01:36:35,365
Come on, dog,

1922
01:36:35,405 --> 01:36:37,168
I thought you loved her, dude.

1923
01:36:37,207 --> 01:36:39,698
I do.

1924
01:36:39,743 --> 01:36:41,768
God, fuck.

1925
01:36:41,812 --> 01:36:44,576
Come on, man, let's
go drop off that bud.

1926
01:36:47,951 --> 01:36:49,248
What bud?

1927
01:36:49,286 --> 01:36:52,119
There's 20 kilos in the trunk.

1928
01:36:52,155 --> 01:36:53,452
Say that again?

1929
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:55,685
There's 20 kilos
in the trunk, man.

1930
01:36:57,227 --> 01:36:58,558
- Of weed?
- Yeah.

1931
01:36:58,595 --> 01:36:59,892
Get the fuck out of here, man.

1932
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:01,397
I picked it up at the party.

1933
01:37:01,431 --> 01:37:03,763
I'm dropping it at Casper's.

1934
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,427
Casper's?

1935
01:37:05,468 --> 01:37:07,231
(laughing):
I get three Gs.

1936
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:10,296
We get three Gs.

1937
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,932
You drove it across the border?

1938
01:37:12,008 --> 01:37:14,067
(laughing):
Yeah.

1939
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:15,407
What if they would've caught us?

1940
01:37:15,445 --> 01:37:17,242
Couldrt happen, man.

1941
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,875
My shit is on fire
right now, man.

1942
01:37:20,917 --> 01:37:23,545
My shit is wired
right now, man.

1943
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:25,714
You risked my ass
without telling me?

1944
01:37:25,755 --> 01:37:28,553
That's not cool, man.
For three fucking Gs?

1945
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:31,254
That's... that's a good rate
for transporting that.

1946
01:37:31,294 --> 01:37:33,262
Shit, if I'd
told you,

1947
01:37:33,296 --> 01:37:34,456

01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:39,135
I wouldn't have been
in the fucking car, dude!

1950
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:41,535
I would've been on

1951
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:43,562
That's a serious breach

1957
01:37:53,316 --> 01:37:55,477
But, you know, I got
bills, I got shit.
