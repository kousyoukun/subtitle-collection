1
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,210
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Heads up!

2
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,530
Man down! Cease fire!

3
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,650
Stupid motherfucker!

4
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,130
<i>Sí.</i>

5
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,770
What's up, Sylvia?

6
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,410
Cute little outfit.

7
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,970
You look nice.

8
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,930
Mike's in
the bedroom.

9
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,930
Yeah?

10
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,650
Man, I said
you look nice.

11
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,330
I have a court
appearance, Jim.

12
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,370
Well, you just
give 'em hell.

13
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,490
Hey.

14
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,490
Spiffy duds, huh?

15
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,650
You look like
a gift-wrapped turd.

16
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,410
Now please leave me alone.
I have to concentrate.

17
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,170
I have two filings
and a deposition today.

18
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,770
Play nice, kids.

19
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,690
What up, dog?

20
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,650
- Nothing. Just got back.
- Cool. Cool.

21
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,130
How was Mexico, dog?

22
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,410
Oh, it was a dream, man.

23
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,410
- Loving my woman.
- Right.

24
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,050
That's it.
I'm out of here.

25
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,770
Those are copies
of your resumé.

26
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,850
Pass them out like candy.

27
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,210
'Cause I can always
print up more.

28
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,930
And just call me
if anything happens, okay?

29
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,650
And no drinking.

30
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,090
Come on, baby, be cool.

31
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,290
Honey, I'm serious.

32
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,330
No drinking. Okay?

33
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,570
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

34
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,570
Good luck.

35
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,730
Your suit's fine, okay?

36
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,050
Dude, she called me
a gift-wrapped turd.

37
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,570
Don't be fucking
with her, dude.

38
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,290
She's pissed.

39
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,770
Why is she on
the warpath? Dog...

40
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,730
I didn't look for work
yesterday, dude.

41
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,410
Sold some of her CDs,
bought a couple of 40s

42
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,170
and a pack of GPCs.

43
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,330
Caught a buzz
and watched

44
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,250
my Chicago Vs. Lakers tapes.

45
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:38,370
That's on you, homie.

46
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,530
We didn't even
hang yesterday.

47
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,010
I was out of the country.

48
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,930
So? My old lady still
thinks it's your fault.

49
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,130
Huh? Huh? Hmm?

50
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,050
Come on, dude, let's get
the fuck out of here

51
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,210
and find my ass
some employment.

52
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,570
It's cool you driving me around?

53
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,090
Yeah, dude, it's cool.
It's no trouble.

54
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,730
<i>Here, asshole.</i>

55
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,010
Breakfast.

56
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,770
Oh... ho, ho...

57
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,570
Dog.

58
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,450
No <i>pisto</i> for me, dude.

59
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,570
Today's a no-pounding day.
You heard the woman.

60
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,290
Good. More for me.

61
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,650
Fuck it.

62
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,330
<i>Salud.</i>
<i>Salud.</i>

63
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,330
Man, hope they put me in
the next class or I'm fucked.

64
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,050
I can't pay my rent.

65
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,930
Landlady's about to pull
a gauge on my ass.

66
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,370
What happened to all that money
you saved in the army, dude?

67
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,170
The tax-free shit?

68
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,850
Man, bro, this fucking
ride cleaned me out.

69
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,530
I guess we drank
up the rest.

70
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,170
Dumb ass.

71
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,170
Cops better start
paying you, dude.

72
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,610
You spend enough
fucking time with them.

73
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,930
They better start kicking me
down some paychecks, man.

74
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,050
They got me hopping through
hoops, you know?

75
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,290
"Come in for a test."
"Come back in two weeks."

76
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,010
Another test, another two weeks.

77
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,490
Fuck.

78
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,490
Shit gets real,

79
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,770
you be hating life.

80
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,730
Party time will be over.

81
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,370
Dude, you don't know how much

82
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,330
I'm looking forward
to this shit.

83
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,610
You know, I'll be super recruit.

84
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,410
I was jumping
out of choppers

85
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,610
in the mountains,
taking down

86
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,490
hard motherfuckers,
you know?

87
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,170
I'll be laughing my way through
LAPD's reindeer games.

88
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,810
Shit, they're
gonna love me.

89
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,050
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna
fucking love them, dude.

90
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,050
Ah, fuck you.

91
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,370
I'm going to love my old lady.

92
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,090
I'm gonna marry homegirl.

93
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,650
Import her ass.

94
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,130
Oh, come on, man.

95
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,530
Dude, what happened
to all the honeys

96
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,290
we were gonna pimp
with your badge, dog?

97
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,250
You're fucking up the plan.

98
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,570
I've been thinking, you know?

99
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,730
Love's about sacrifice.

100
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,650
Only true measure of it.

101
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:36,130
What would you do for Sylvia?

102
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,650
Get a job.

103
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,490
- Mm...
- Nine to fucking five.

104
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,250
Yeah.

105
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,730
That's love.

106
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,090
Hey.

107
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,810
Good morning.

108
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,050
So when do you officially

109
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,690
hand your ass over to the Man?

110
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,450
"Mr. Jim Davis,
we regret to inform...

111
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,690
I had two beers, right?

112
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,050
Yeah.

113
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,330
Going fucking
blind or something.

114
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,290
Okay, this letter
says, quoting...

115
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:28,370
"no longer eligible
as a police officer candidate."

116
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,850
What the fuck does that mean?

117
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,770
Come on, dude.

118
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,330
"no longer eligible"? I mean,
what does that sound like?

119
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,530
They pulled the plug, dude.

120
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,450
No, no...

121
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,970
Why?

122
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,170
Oh, man, I'll bet you...

123
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,170
I'll bet you it's
'cause I'm white.

124
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,250
I bet it's 'cause
you're a dick.

125
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,930
No, no, no, Mike,
you don't understand.

126
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,730
I am fucked.

127
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,610
I got to get married.

128
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,490
Okay? INS won't let me
bring Marta across

129
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,850
unless I got employment.

130
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,890
I promised her.

131
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,650
This fucks up my plan.

132
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,890
This is fucking bullshit, okay?

133
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,250
This... these fucking
assholes...

134
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,490
These fucking assholes!

135
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,050
What the fuck
is their problem, man?!

136
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,970
This is fucking typical
cop hate game bullshit!

137
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,770
Yo, yo, fucking
chill, Magilla Gorilla.

138
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,130
I mean you're trippin', dude.

139
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,210
Hey, what the fuck

140
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,370
are you looking at, asshole?!

141
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,010
Fucking dick.

142
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,010
Yo, yo,

143
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:28,010
Jim, Jim...

144
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,290
I'm gonna fucking kick your
teeth down your puke hole!

145
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,690
You fucking want some?

146
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,810
Jim, Jim, dude.

147
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,010
Kick back, dude.

148
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,570
The fucking light is green.
Get the fuck in the car.

149
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,850
Man, fuck.
- You're going to catch

150
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,970
a case doing that shit, man.

151
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,170
What the fuck were you doing?

152
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,930
Fuck the LAPD, man.

153
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,890
What's up with Pasadena,
Pomona, Santa Ana and all that?

154
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,730
Oh, no, fuck the sticks.

155
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,610
L.A. City's the shit.

156
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,250
Hey, Sheriff's Department.

157
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,770
It's good enough for the INS
and still basically L.A., right?

158
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,850
Yeah, Sheriff's Department,
yeah.

159
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,010
They make you work
the jails the first two years

160
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,050
or something.

161
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,370
I could be cracking heads

162
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,130
up at the Honor Ranch.

163
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,330
I'll give 'em a call,
start testing.

164
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,410
Yeah.

165
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,770
That's right.

166
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,570
Yo, it's just
a minor setback, right?

167
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,890
Quit trippin', dude.

168
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,010
Shit.

169
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,050
Hey, you know what
I want to do?

170
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,530
What?

171
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,450
I want to get fucked up.

172
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,010
Me, too, man.

173
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,770
I got to find a job and placate
my baby, you know.

174
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,530
Sylvia's going
to kick your ass?

175
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,130
Come on, big man,
she'll be cool.

176
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,730
Come on.

177
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,370
- Bye, Nicole.
- Bye.

178
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,570
Let me get a couple
of singles, too, please.

179
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,530
Sorry, you buy whole pack.

180
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,330
Be cool, dude.

181
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,530
If I buy a whole pack

182
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,170
I'm gonna want
to smoke it.

183
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,370
I just want a couple
of smokes with my beer.

184
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,050
City give me $1,500 ticket.

185
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,050
No more.

186
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,490
Asshole.

187
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,450
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

188
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,810
Oh, shit.

189
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,490
That fucking gangster, man.

190
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,210
Homeboy just ran
a six second four-forty.

191
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,850
Damn, the chino looked
fucking pissed, man.

192
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,730
You think we'll be able
to go back there?

193
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,490
I hate that shit.

194
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,250
Fuckin' chino lookin' at us
like we were gonna bust him?

195
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,210
Come on, dude.
We're wearin' suits, man.

196
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,450
We totally look like cops.

197
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,090
He said he got fined
for that shit.

198
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,250
He was just being cautious.

199
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,410
Well, we got <i>pisto</i>,
we got <i>frajos</i>.

200
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,410
Only one thing missin'.

201
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,170
Be-at-ches.

202
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,730
Oh, yeah, I mean
besides bitches, man.

203
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,970
<i>Yesca?</i>
Mm-hmm.

204
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,570
Bingo.

205
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,810
I need to feel
some reefer madness.

206
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,530
You sure you want
to score some bud, dude?

207
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,610
You haven't smoked out
since like forever, man.

208
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,050
I said I want
to get fucked up, man.

209
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,730
Fuck this purity bullshit.

210
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,970
Yeah... fuck purity.

211
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,410
Aw, man, look at this
zero-head, dog.

212
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,490
Stupid-ass cholo.

213
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,770
Look at that.

214
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,010
That dude's slangin', dog.

215
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,250
Want to get
a dime?

216
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,330
No, I want it all.

217
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,050
Go for the stash, man.

218
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,010
Whoa, go, go, go.

219
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,650
Hey, hey, yo, yo.

220
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,730
That's my shit!

221
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,370
Fuck.

222
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,650
Outstanding.

223
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,730
Out-fucking-standing.

224
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,090
That shit was slick.

225
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,130
That motherfucker
just got schooled.

226
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,090
Bitch-ass cholo.

227
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,650
- Check this shit out, huh?
- Yeah.

228
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,850
Nice motherfucking haul.
You see that shit, huh?

229
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,570
Mm. It's not laced either.

230
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,570
Smell that shit.

231
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:41,650
Smell that motherfucking shit.

232
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,690
We just burned my car.

233
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,330
We go back there,
we're gonna get shot.

234
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,290
Yeah, no shit.

235
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,250
Man, bust that light.

236
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,010
Roll that shit up.

237
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,930
Yeah, yeah, Cool.

238
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,610
Yo, let's drop off
some resumés first.

239
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,810
Then we'll smoke out, dude.

240
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,930
Some resumés.

241
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,090
Yeah.

242
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,130
Ah, man, fresh air.

243
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,290
Look.

244
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,090
Oh! They're
dropped off, man.

245
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,290
You fucking asshole, man.

246
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,570
I got to get
a fucking job, man.

247
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,850
What's your problem, man?

248
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,130
What the fuck are
you doing, dickhead.

249
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,250
Yo, Mike, first day looking--

250
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,810
nobody ever gets a job
their first day looking.

251
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,370
Come on, don't
sweat it, man.

252
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,410
Hey, I can't
fuck around tomorrow.

253
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,570
I got to get a job for sure.

254
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,770
This is your job, man.

255
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,130
So act like a fucking
professional,

256
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,210
spark up the goods, 'cause we
got a lot of work to do.

257
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,090
It's harsh. It's good, though.

258
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,250
You okay?

259
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,210
How are those lungs, baby?

260
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,850
There it is.

261
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,410
That magic feeling.

262
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,410
Damn, look at that bitch.

263
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,130
Oh, damn.

264
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,130
Fuck, yeah.

265
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,650
She's fucking good.

266
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,210
I bet she got skills.
I want to get laid.

267
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,250
You just saw your woman.

268
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,650
Only hit her once, man.

269
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,930
We can't go nowhere alone.
They got me sleeping in the car.

270
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,530
Family's got that ass
under guard, huh?

271
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,650
Lock and key.

272
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,370
Fuck, I want to get laid.

273
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,370
Pay a visit
to my harem, huh?

274
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,530
Online, pornmeister.

275
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,050
Uh-uh, let's go
to Letty's pad, man.

276
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,850
How much you want to bet
I hit it.

277
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,610
- She won't, dog.
- How much you want to bet?

278
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,930
She won't give you shit, dog.

279
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,530
You big time
fucked her over.

280
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,170
Aw, man, I popped that poodahey.

281
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,330
I got that mind control, man.

282
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,770
How much you want to bet
I get back up in it?

283
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,250
20 bucks?

284
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,490
You ain't got 20 bucks.

285
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,410
So, neither do you, man.

286
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,170
Come on, shake on that shit.

287
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,530
Come on.

288
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,730
What the fuck, let's go.

289
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,290
I got it.

290
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,810
What's up, Patty?

291
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,690
- <i>Y tu hermana?</i>
- She ain't here.

292
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,170
<i>Y sabes que?</i>

293
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,210
You're not welcome
in this house.

294
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,250
Sure, Patty.

295
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,290
I'd love to come in.

296
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,930
Thank you.

297
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,130
Are they here?

298
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,050
You're looking fine,
as fuck, <i>chulas</i>.

299
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,170
Don't... don't touch
me, please.

300
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,770
Hey, hey.

301
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,250
You got to get out of here.

302
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,170
Letty...

303
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,210
I just wanted
to see you again.

304
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,970
Hey, Patty, you want to grab
me a <i>pisto</i> or something?

305
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,930
I ain't grabbing you shit.

306
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,290
Oh, you still got
a mouth, huh?

307
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,250
Maybe one day you'll learn
how to keep it shut.

308
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,370
Laters. I'm going to my room.

309
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,570
You know you have to run
his ass out of here.

310
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,970
Baby.

311
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,090
Let's sit down.

312
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,770
No, no, no.

313
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,730
So, um...

314
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,530
You a cop yet?

315
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,090
I'm working on it.

316
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,290
<i>Y tu?</i>

317
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,170
<i>Que andas haciendo?</i>

318
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,490
Well, you know, I'm going
to L.A. Trade Tech.

319
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,050
It's good you're doing
positive shit.

320
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,810
What, after everything
I don't get a kiss?

321
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,450
It's because of everything
you can't get a kiss.

322
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,490
Oh, come on, come here.

323
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,650
Yeah.

324
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,250
Don't.

325
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,850
Jim, I got a boyfriend.

326
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,610
Who?

327
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,850
Flaco.

328
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,810
You're back with that

329
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,090
piece of shit after
what he did, Letty?

330
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,410
You're not fucking him, are you?

331
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,650
Please tell me no.

332
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,370
Yes. So... just go.

333
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,130
'Cause there's nothing
here for you, Jim.

334
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,490
See?

335
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,770
Okay?

336
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,530
I don't believe
this shit, Letty.

337
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,330
You're too good for that.

338
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,330
You gotta go.

339
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:56,090
Go. Please!

340
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,210
Let me talk to them.

341
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,090
No, Jim, don't
be stupid. Please.

342
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,290
Okay? <i>Largate.</i> Just go.

343
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,050
I guess it's later days.

344
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,010
<i>Largate.</i> Just go!

345
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,450
Flaco, the <i>pinchi guero</i>'s here!

346
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,610
<i>Apuarte,</i> Jim!
Hurry up!

347
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,650
- Fuck him up!
- I got him!

348
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,650
Fucking white boy!

349
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,290
What's up, faggot?!

350
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,050
We're going to fuck you up!

351
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,610
Yo! pop the trunk

352
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,810
so I can handle this shit!

353
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,490
Fuck you, <i>puto</i>!

354
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,090
I'll bust you!

355
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,010
Leave him alone!

356
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,890
Pop the fucking trunk!

357
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,970
Jim!

358
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,450
Oh, you fucked up!

359
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,570
Get your fucking knees
down on the curb now!

360
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,170
Get the fuck
over there, man!

361
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,050
Don't fucking move unless you
want your brains hanging out!

362
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,170
What's your problem, Flaco?

363
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,050
Motherfucker!

364
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,970
Fucking knees on the curb, man!

365
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,290
That's right!

366
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,210
Interlock your fingers
behind your heads, Flaco!

367
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,650
You deaf fuck!

368
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,330
Yo, Mike.

369
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,570
Yeah?

370
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,930
Do up their ride.

371
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,770
Freeze, bitch!

372
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,650
I'm going to take that big ass
of yours home,

373
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,770
hit it for a minute, you know?

374
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,050
Fuck off!

375
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,050
Now you got it.

376
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,850
Yo, relax, homie.

377
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,930
You break Letty's heart,
I'm coming for your mom.

378
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,090
Fuck!

379
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,570
Hey, <i>haina</i>.

380
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,650
Whoo!

381
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,170
Fuck off!
Oh, yeah?

382
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,050
What you got down here?

383
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,570
Oh...

384
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,050
Liking that.

385
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,890
Damn! Those are
badass kicks, dog.

386
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,650
Lucky you got little bitch feet,

387
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,970
else I'd be stomping around
in them motherfuckers.

388
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,810
- Fuck you, <i>puto</i>.
- Huh?

389
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,410
- Yeah. Fuck you.
- Yes?

390
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,050
You fucking stay still!

391
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,290
Bitches! If you didn't have
that fucking gun,

392
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,770
<i>ese</i>, it wouldn't
be about shit, homie.

393
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,610
Not fucking shit!

394
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,010
Hey, later, Patty!

395
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,810
I hope you're not
pregnant, but you know

396
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,890
you wanted me to blow in you.

397
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,010
Fuck you!

398
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,610
Bye, Letty!

399
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,650
<i>Salud.</i>

400
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,690
Divvy up the bounty, dude.
I know you got some cash.

401
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,930
I know I got more than that.

402
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,890
Yeah. Here we go.

403
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,170
Shit.

404
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,290
That's my pussy
she's giving away there.

405
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,890
Homeboy uses extra large.

406
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,610
Man, that's it?
Next time,

407
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,170
jack someone with a job.

408
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,730
Well, fuck you.
What did you get, their lunch?

409
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,410
Check it out.

410
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,370
Holy shit.
You're kidding me.

411
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,290
Whoo! It's a fucking
Ruger P-94. Nine millimeter.

412
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,090
14, plus one in the chamber.

413
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,810
It's a good fucking gun.
Durable.

414
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,570
It's brand-new.

415
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,450
It's a BB gun.

416
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,850
Yeah. Cool.

417
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,410
Here you go, dog.

418
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,730
About time you got a <i>cohete</i>.

419
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,170
No. I don't want it.

420
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,370
Why the fuck not? I'll use it.

421
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,330
That's a good reason. Sell it.

422
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,290
How much you think
we can get for the gun?

423
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,930
Two bills, maybe three.
Costs six new.

424
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,010
We'll sell it
and split the greenery.

425
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,970
You sure?

426
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,610
It's cool, dude.

427
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,130
50-50.

428
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,650
Good BB gun though.

429
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,130
Shoot some birds and shit.

430
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,850
Hey, put that shit away.

431
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,330
Looks real as hell.

432
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,570
Not a bad day's work.

433
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,490
Get down to business though.

434
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,850
I know you didn't get any.

435
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,330
So pay up, motherfucker.

436
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,050
Dick.

437
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,610
Hello. This is a message
for Michael Alonzo.

438
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,250
This is Bob Luell
at the Palm Glen Group.

439
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,250
We have reviewed your resumé,

440
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,930
and would like
to make an appointment

441
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,290
for later in the week.

442
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,410
Please call me at your

443
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,170
earliest convenience.

444
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,130
Thank you.

445
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,330
Huh? That's good.

446
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,890
One more? This is fun.

447
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,930
Sounded a little gay,
but it was good.

448
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,970
No, no, no. no.
That's it, dude. That's it.

449
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,050
I get too many callbacks,

450
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,290
Sylvia's going
to get suspicious.

451
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,850
Oh, Sylvia's going
to be kissing your ass.

452
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,210
Not if she
recognizes your voice.

453
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,170
Oh, she won't. Here, sir.

454
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,730
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm cool.

455
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,170
- Come on.
- I'm cool.

456
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,570
I want to get home before the
little woman and sober up.

457
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,490
Come on, bro. One brew.

458
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,770
All right, but hey,

459
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,570
I got to look for a job
tomorrow for sure.

460
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,770
Okay? I can't
be getting fucked up

461
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,850
behind Sylvia's back
when I'm supposed

462
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,890
to be looking
for work, man.

463
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,530
Not cool.
Tomorrow, for sure.

464
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,570
I got to find a job, too.

465
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,010
Hello.

466
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,650
Yes, sir.

467
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,570
Yes, sir. That is correct.

468
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,010
Six years.

469
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,210
Honorably discharged.

470
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,850
Yes, sir.

471
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,610
I would love to.

472
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,610
Believe me, I would
welcome the opportunity.

473
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,530
Tomorrow

474
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,370
is not a problem.

475
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,610
Thank you, sir.
You have a good day, too.

476
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,210
Good-bye, sir.

477
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,410
That was the man, huh?
You're all "Sir,

478
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,770
sir, sir."

479
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,730
Yes! Fucking yes! Thank God!

480
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,810
That was the man!
That was the Federal man!

481
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,290
The Federal man!

482
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,530
Department of
Homeland Security

483
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,330
wants me to come in
tomorrow to start testing!

484
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,170
Oh, shit!

485
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,410
Fucking A, my brother!

486
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,690
That shit is righteous,
motherfucker!

487
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,890
It's on, homie!

488
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,530
Wow, man.
Tomorrow.

489
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,210
So what the fuck you
going to do now, dude?

490
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,730
I got to take a piss test.

491
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,050
If I'm cool,
I'm in the house.

492
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,330
Yeah! Oh!

493
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,650
Shit, dude,
do they piss test for weed?

494
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,250
Oh, shit!

495
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,330
You fucked up, man.

496
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,170
Oh, fuck.

497
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,410
I fucked up.

498
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,930
Oh, fuck. I fucked up.

499
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,250
Fuck! Oh...

500
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,170
You know, one dope
molecule, and I'm done.

501
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,570
And they will burn me

502
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,090
with every law enforcement
outfit in the country.

503
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,250
Shit!

504
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,530
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, dude.

505
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,850
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

506
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,650
Hey, there's a way out
of every fucking situation.

507
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,090
- Right? Relax, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

508
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,450
Yeah. I'm going to do
what I got to do, you know?

509
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,570
It's cool. Fuck, yeah.

510
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,650
I'll pass that shit.

511
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,010
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

512
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,290
Of course
you will, dude!

513
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,130
Later, loco.

514
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,370
Don't fucking trip, dude.

515
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,250
All right.

516
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,210
Shit.

517
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,170
Eat.

518
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,090
Come in, dumb ass!

519
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,810
What's up, dog?

520
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,770
What up, dog...

521
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,490
Hey, Jim.
Want some coffee?

522
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,530
Sure.

523
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,250
Want some eggs?
There's extra.

524
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,410
Yes, ma'am. Please.

525
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,330
I, uh, heard
about the LAPD.

526
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,130
Sorry about that.

527
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,010
I thought they
guaranteed you a job.

528
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,490
Yea. Me, too.

529
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,010
Well, maybe it
wasn't meant to be.

530
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,690
You know, you being a cop.

531
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,170
Tell her what's up, dude.

532
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,450
Well, I applied

533
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,410
to all the Federal
law enforcement agencies.

534
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,730
You know, ATF, Border Patrol,

535
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,130
ICE, Homeland Security,
all of them.

536
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,810
And Homeland Security's
interested in me.

537
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,290
They want me to come in today
and start testing.

538
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,690
Wow. That's great.
How sure is this?

539
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,370
Well, I got a urinalysis today.

540
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,490
If I pass that, I'll be
a Special Agent candidate,

541
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,450
and then I could
be out of here next month.

542
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,250
You haven't been
smoking out, have you?

543
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,850
Nah. Chilled on that shit
a while back.

544
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,010
Good. Well, thanks for driving
Mike around yesterday.

545
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,850
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, bro.

546
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,810
Three callbacks.

547
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,330
Damn! Good!

548
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,010
We dropped off
enough resumés. Whoo!

549
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,410
Got more.

550
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,410
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

551
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,930
Well, you have
to keep trying

552
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,410
until something happens.

553
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,890
Finding a job <i>is</i> a job, right?

554
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,170
Lunch money.

555
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,370
Thank you.

556
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,610
And good
luck today.

557
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,490
Thank you.

558
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,890
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

559
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,650
Good luck.

560
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,010
And, Jim, good luck
on your pee test.

561
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,170
I hope you studied.

562
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,410
I'm going to
cram for it.

563
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,730
Man, that's freaky.

564
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,730
She was in
a good mood.

565
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,130
Breakfast
and beer money?

566
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,130
Yeah, dude.

567
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,410
She heard the
messages last night.

568
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:12,530
She got me a sixer.

569
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,170
I slammed two last night.

570
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,770
Out-fuckin'-standing!

571
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,370
Now we know beer is just
a phone call away.

572
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,530
Yeah.

573
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,170
Yeah. We talked shit out
last night, though.

574
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,290
You know? Hey, all she wants
is for me to get a job.

575
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,090
I shouldn't be playing her
like that.

576
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,370
Dude, you <i>had</i> a good job,

577
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,930
with that, uh, with
that Web design shit.

578
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,450
Had, dude. <i>Had.</i>

579
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,610
All right? All that
shit's in India now.

580
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,250
Want a cold one?
No, later.

581
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,450
You got any vinegar?

582
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,850
Vinegar? What for?

583
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,530
Ah...

584
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,450
Oh...

585
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,490
Damn, dude!

586
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,650
Ah...!

587
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,290
- Man!
- That is fuckin' sick, man.

588
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,170
What'd you do that for?

589
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,610
- Shuts down the old kidneys.
- Ooh.

590
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,570
Come on, let's roll.

591
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,650
Grab me that bag, dude.

592
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,490
Little trick I learned
in the service.

593
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,570
Aw, that's sick, dude.

594
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,170
You're gonna stick
a turkey baster in your dick?

595
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,690
Quit looking, faggot.

596
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,450
You wish.

597
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,490
Oh, man.

598
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,770
Fuckin'...

599
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,330
shit, dude.

600
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,370
Oh, fuckin' shit...

601
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,970
Aw...

602
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,890
Aw, motherfucker!

603
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,690
Whew!

604
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,130
Ah...

605
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,290
That was...

606
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,850
unpleasant.

607
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,330
Man...

608
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,290
Man, I want to get
this shit over with.

609
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,530
You know, my teeth are floating.

610
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,010
Oh...

611
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,490
You get those
in the military, dog?

612
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,650
I was a Ranger.

613
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,770
Your mom still suck
a mean dick, hmm?

614
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,410
Gotcha! Shouldn't ignore people.

615
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,970
Why don't you go
fuck yourself!

616
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,050
Hey!

617
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,410
Let's play nice,

618
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,970
boys.

619
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,890
I have everyone's "Consent to
Urinalysis" form signed

620
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,970
and dated, am I right?

621
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,930
Yes, sir.

622
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,850
Good. I'm Agent Richards.

623
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,450
Jackets off.

624
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,490
I will now administer
the easiest test

625
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,450
Homeland Security
will ever give you,

626
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,770
the whizz quiz.

627
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,090
Roll up both sleeves
past the elbow.

628
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:55,090
Remove all gloves, rings,
watches, bracelets,

629
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,290
jewelry, Band-Aids
and bandages.

630
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,690
I want to see nothing
but bare hands and forearms.

631
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,210
Wiggle your fingers.

632
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,810
Let me see
both sides.

633
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,570
Beautifully done.

634
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,610
Again, gentlemen,
no talking.

635
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,850
Detweiler, is it?

636
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,730
You're with me.

637
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,850
Fucker.

638
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,770
Next!

639
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,610
Name?

640
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,690
Davis, Jim.

641
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,330
Ah, the Ranger.

642
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,690
Yes, sir.

643
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,530
- You serve?
- 101st.

644
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,930
- High speed.
- All right.

645
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,770
Think you can fill that, son?

646
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,410
I could fill
a goddamn trash can, sir.

647
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,290
You're full of piss
and vinegar, aren't you, Jim?

648
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:00,410
Yes, sir.

649
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,410
Hey, unload that shit before
you clown with it, okay?

650
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,050
I don't want my head
blown off

651
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,410
just when I'm getting
it straight.

652
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,450
Pop! What's it like

653
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,890
to just straight-up
whack a motherfucker?

654
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,890
What's it like?
I mean, what the fuck, you know?

655
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,330
It's like nothing.
What's it supposed to be like?

656
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,650
You tell me.

657
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,890
You were busting heads
for the military.

658
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:26,290
I can't talk about
this shit, Mike.

659
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,650
But I will tell you one
thing-- you point and shoot,

660
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,330
pop, pop, move on, fuck 'em,
they shouldn't have been there,

661
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,850
you move the fuck on.

662
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:40,690
You do not stop
and <i>think</i> about it.

663
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,890
- It's not a big deal.
- So if it's nothing,

664
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,210
then what you getting
all mad for?

665
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,370
I'm not getting mad.

666
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,770
I just hate stupid
questions, Mike.

667
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,850
You think you killed
a lot of Commies?

668
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:50,850
- They weren't Commies, dumb ass.
- Then what were they?

669
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,170
You know what they were--
they were fuckin' Hajjis,

670
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,650
terrorists, the bad guys.

671
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,530
Did you like it?
Oh, shit.

672
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,450
Did you dig it?

673
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,770
You bust a nut?

674
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,490
Not fuckin' now, man.
Seriously.

675
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,970
You're killing my buzz, dude.

676
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:12,370
Aw, kick back, stress case.

677
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,650
Are we on a mission to
sell this piece or what?

678
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,770
Hell, yeah.

679
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,130
Let's sell this
fuckin' piece.

680
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,610
Got to get some scratch,
you know what I'm saying?

681
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,410
Pop! Pop! Pop!

682
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,610

684
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,930

685
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,130
Come on, come on, come on,

687

Y'all need to knock
this shit off right now.

688
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,730
Hey, what's up, bro?

689
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,890
Come on in, motherfuckers.

690
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,250
Yeah.

691
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,010
Get your little
ass up in here.

692
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,090

You motherfuckers

696
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,730
I saw that city-lookin'
car pull up--

697
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,770
I thought y'all was

698
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,130

Damn. What'd
they put on you?

702
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,650
Some bullshit.

703
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,730
I saw some wrong-ass shit

704
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,970
up in there, dude.

705
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,050
I ain't ever going back
to that motherfucker.

706
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,530
It scared you straight, huh?

707
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,090
- Mm-hmm.

708
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,290
<i>Hell,</i> no.

You over there tickling
your brown eye, dog?

710
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,730
They-they put some jelly
on there, serve some syrup?

711
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,650
- You toss the salad?
- Hey, you know, nigga,

712
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,330
I kept my ass to the wall
and my mouth shut.

713
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,490
Shoot.

714
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,610
I almost lost my job
over that shit.

715
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,210
Fuckin' around in there.

716
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,410
Oh, God...

717
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,170
- You a cop?
- Nope.

718

I ain't got
three bills, dog.

00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,250
Hey, Jim.

820
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,130
We should lose
the monkey suits, dude.

821
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,690
<i>Quien es?</i>

822
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,130
Hey, bring us,
<i>dos pistos, por favor,</i>

823
00:42:38,165 --> 00:42:40,010
<i>mi reina.</i>

824
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,410
Damn.

825
00:42:44,885 --> 00:42:47,650
Hey, dog, I don't
think they like us here.

826
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,650
Fuck 'em.

827
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,090
I got my shit.

828
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,490
They make a move,
I'm blasting.

829
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,330
Which one of these fools
is Eddy?

830
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,730
Yeah. I don't know.

831
00:42:59,765 --> 00:43:02,730
They're all <i>paisas</i> here.

832
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,730
Hey, why don't you ask
that homegirl right there?

833
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,610
<i>Sientate, guapa.</i>

834
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,570
Mm.

835
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:24,650
<i>Habla Espanol?</i>

836
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,610
<i>Si.</i>

837
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,730
<i>Que bien.</i>

838
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,210
<i>Sabas donde esta</i>
<i>el Eddy?</i>

839
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,570
Eddy, <i>te hablan</i>.

840
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,050
<i>Que paso?</i>

841
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:41,890
Do I know you?

842
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,210
My homeboy Darrell said
to talk to you.

843
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,210
Darrell?
Yeah.

844
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,770
I'm Jim, homie.

845
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:54,250
What's up, man? Mike, dog.

846
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,530
All right.
So what's up?

847
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,290
Need a <i>cohete</i>?

848
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,530
Maybe.

849
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:06,970
What kind?

850
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,970
Ruger P-94, brand-new.

851
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,450
Ruger, huh?
Yeah.

852
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,450
How many mags?

853
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,330
One high cap.
I'll throw in the hollow points.

854
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,690
Strictly Black Talons, homes.

855
00:44:16,725 --> 00:44:18,850
Homies be wearing
vests these days,

856
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,170
know what
I'm saying?

857
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,130
Is it new?

858
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,970
Yeah, it's brand-new.

859
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,610
Where's it at?

860
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,850
I can get it.

861
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,770
How much?

862
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,050
Three bills.

863
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,490
I'll give you $250
if it's new.

864
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,770
If not, I'll give you $200.

865
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:41,930
Cool.

866
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,290
You got the <i>feria</i>, homie?

867
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,770
I can get it.

868
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,410
<i>Orale.</i>

869
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,410
Let's kick back,
have a couple <i>pistos</i>

870
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,450
before we handle business, eh?

871
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,570
Hey, <i>guero</i>, you like her?

872
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,330
I do need to get laid.

873
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,090
There it is right
there, brother.

874
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,330
Yo, give me that <i>cohete</i>.

875
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,410
<i>Mataste a un flor.</i>

876
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:27,570
Oh, shit!

877
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,130
Open the fucking door!

878
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,570
<i>Holy shit, dude!</i>

879
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,610
You think he's gonna
fuckin' die?!

880
00:45:42,645 --> 00:45:44,450
Sure. Got his carotid.

881
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,210
Fucker was garden-hosing.

882
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,170
He'll bleed out.

883
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,370
Oh, shit, dude,

884
00:45:48,405 --> 00:45:50,290
I've seen dudes get shot, man,
but I never seen

885
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:51,730
no motherfucking shit
like that before, man!

886
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:54,090
Fucked his shit up, you know?

887
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,250
Quick as shit, too.
That crack-crack!

888
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,810
Turned that <i>vato</i> into
a fountain of blood.

889
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:00,370
Why the fuck
did he do that, man?

890
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,290
That shit could have been
over anything, you know?

891
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:03,850
Money, drugs, bitches,
respect, whatever.

892
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,210
That homie, straight-up pimp.

893
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,090
You know, maybe he turned out
that dude's daughter.

894
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,170
Looney tunes and shit,

895
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,610
glass all stuck
in his fuckin' neck.

896
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,410
Did you see all that fuckin'
blood over there?!

897
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:13,650
Yeah, man, the human body's
got a gallon.

898
00:46:13,685 --> 00:46:16,650
Damn!

899
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,490
I coulda boned Gracie.

900
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,130
She had that proper thickness.

901
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,130
Look at me, dog.

902
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,050
Look at me.

903
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,730
I'm fuckin' traumatized
and shit.

904
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:31,370
Yo, homie, that shit
don't fuckin' faze you at all?

905
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,690
Oh, man,
I seen way worse.

906
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,130
Trashcanistan.

907
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,490
My battle buddy, he got his legs
and arms blown off

908
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,810
by a booby-trapped motorcycle.

909
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:44,930
Medic saved his ass
and he lived.

910
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,690
He didn't want to, but he did.

911
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:50,050
I got to face my woman.

912
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,290
How in the fuck am I supposed
to play this shit off, huh?

913
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,290
Man, you'll do it, player.

914
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,130
Hey, baby girl,
you cooking?

915
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,490
Yeah. Where have you been?

916
00:47:05,525 --> 00:47:06,930
Oh, Jim's pad.

917
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,210
You been drinking?

918
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:09,810
Oh, you know,
I had a few brews.

919
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,210
A few?
Yeah.

920
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,410
You look wasted.

921
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:16,610
Don't trip, girl.

922
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,810
I've been working
all day.

923
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:21,970
I've been looking
for work all day.

924
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,850
I wish I could hang out and
get wasted like the old days.

925
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,610
You know what?

926
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,850
When I'm working,
you can lounge.

927
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,690
I'll fix this place up,

928
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,050
get you nice clothes
and stuff...

929
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,290
Mike, Mike, Mike.

930
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,730
It doesn't have anything
to do with money.

931
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,090
Come here.

932
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:40,370
Sit down. I want
to talk to you.

933
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,890
Hey, it's not
about stuff.

934
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,810
It's about you and me
needing an equal partner.

935
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,210
Right.

936
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,290
Hey, I know that you
supported me through college

937
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,730
and I'm gonna always

938
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:50,850
- owe you for that.
- Right.

939
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,090
Now everything's flipped

940
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,650
and I feel like I'm doing
everything alone.

941
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,570
You know, sometimes
I feel like you're my kid.

942
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,530
I mean, you sneak
around like one.

943
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,690
Oh-ho!

944
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,650
Look... Wow, dude.

945
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,890
I'm sorry.

946
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:06,890
Be cool, baby girl,

947
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,290
I'm on a mission
to get my shit together.

948
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,810
I applied at this commercial
realty company in Studio City,

949
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,010
and this black guy,
he was the office manager

950
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:14,210
and he's fuckin' hella cool,

951
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,970
you know? We're talkin'
and all that shit.

952
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,170
You know? We're just kickin' it
and all that.

953
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,530
Did you, did you
check the messages?

954
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,690
Four messages.

955
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,330
Mr. Alonzo, I'm calling

956
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,890
from Sunhouse Properties
to schedule an interview.

957
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:31,330
Honey, this is great!

958
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,130
Mm, mm...
Oh! Oh...

959
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,050
You better call him
first thing in the morning.

960
00:48:36,085 --> 00:48:37,570
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

961
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,850
Oh, damn, dog,
that shit was good, dude.

962
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:43,290
Damn, they should give you
a fuckin' Oscar for that shit.

963
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,410
You just stood there

964
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:59,250
and you fed me a line of
bullshit like it was nothing.

965
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,970
You should be
the lawyer.

966
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,450
How could you just do that?

967
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,010
How could you look me in the eye
and lie to me like that?

968
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,050
I'm sorry.

969
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,570
I'd rather you hit me.

970
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,770
I'm your clown.

971
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,290
I'm your fucking clown.

972
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,690
And you and Jim
are laughing at me?

973
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,650
No, it's not...

974
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,770
No, no, no, you are so utterly,
irrevocably busted!

975
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,610
Why don't you just go play
with your little butt buddy?

976
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,530
Go cook up more lies.

977
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,450
You know, I bet
you're doing lines again.

978
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,050
Dude, how could you say
that shit?

979
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,250
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again.

980
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,770
Yeah, right, right.

981
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:43,370
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again!

982
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,810
Right now your word
is less than shit.

983
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:47,810
Maybe you should go.

984
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:51,570
Just fuckin' go.

985
00:49:51,605 --> 00:49:55,570
Just fuckin'... just go, right?

986
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,130
Fuck it.
I'll fuckin' go!

987
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,210
Please, go. Go!

988
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,090
Fuck it then!
I'll fuckin' go!

989
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,690
Then go, Mike!

990
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:02,810
I'm serious!
I'll fuckin' go

991
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,010
except I won't fuckin'
come back!

992
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,170
You want me to fuckin' go?!

993
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,170
Fuckin' go, Mike!

994
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,450
I'll fuckin' go then!

995
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:08,410
I'll fuckin' go!

996
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,250
Get the fuck outta here!

997
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,250
Hello?

998
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,810
Speaking.

999
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:27,890
Of course, sir. Absolutely.

1000
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:30,890
Thank you very much,
Agent Richards.

1001
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:32,890
Thank you, sir.

1002
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:38,810
Who was that?

1003
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:40,170
That was the feds,
my friend.

1004
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,690
I've been informed that I passed
my urinalysis

1005
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,050
and they would like me
to go in this morning

1006
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:49,210
to start formal testing.

1007
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,650
Fuck yeah, dude.

1008
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,730
I'll be there all day,

1009
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,730
so take my ride,
get your ass a job.

1010
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,730
Let's go.

1011
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,010
Oh, shit!

1012
00:50:57,045 --> 00:51:00,570
Come on. Get your
parasitic ass in gear.

1013
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:08,250
I had some twisted-ass dreams
about that dude being killed.

1014
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,170
I slept like a baby.

1015
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,490
I heard screaming.

1016
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:15,010
What kind of tests?

1017
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,730
Psychological tests.

1018
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:20,890
Geez, you're
a freakin' psycho, dude.

1019
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:22,290
Don't answer that shit
honestly.

1020
00:51:22,325 --> 00:51:24,690
Hell no.

1021
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,890
They use the Minnesota
Multiphasic Inventory.

1022
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:31,930
It's like 600 questions,
cross-referenced

1023
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,890
to detect deception.

1024
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,370
They ask the same shit

1025
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:37,290
six different ways.
It's lame.

1026
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:39,090
You'll ace it.

1027
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,530
Dude, I'm gonna pull it off.

1028
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,010
All I needed was a shot.

1029
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,730
Gotta play the system.

1030
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,970
Like a piano.

1031
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,050
You done
with that crap, son?

1032
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,290
Yes, sir.

1033
00:52:02,325 --> 00:52:04,850
Let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.

1034
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:06,890
Bring that with you.

1035
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,770
I see dumb people.

1036
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,930
We reviewed
your LAPD package.

1037
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,410
Since they ran your background,
physical and psych,

1038
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,410
we're going with
their paper.

1039
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,970
- Navy sucks.
- Army swallows.

1040
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,810
Took a little work to
pry your jacket loose

1041
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,210
from their people.

1042
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,730
They don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.

1043
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,210
Move it, dirt bag.

1044
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,090
Why'd they drop me?

1045
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:33,490
Someone here make a call?

1046
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,890
Nope.

1047
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,170
They dropped you
on psych, Jim.

1048
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,530
You blew
their profiles.
