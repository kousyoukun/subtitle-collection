1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,740
Someone here make a call?

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:04,140
Nope.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,420
They dropped you
on psych, Jim.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,780
You blew
their profiles.

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,250
We're all a little
goofy here.

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,850
You'd rather be with us,
wouldn't you?

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,410
Absolutely, sir.

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,650
Good answer.

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,090
Have a seat.

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,250
Said you were bilingual
on your app.

11
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,850
They want to test your Spanish.

12
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,170
We can get that going
if you got time.

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,930
Yes. Sure.

14
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,450
Who's "they"?

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,970
Your fans upstairs.

16
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,810
Fans upstairs? Who?

17
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,290
This is some shit
above my pay grade,

18
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,730
but some very important people
have an eye on you, Jim.

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,370
Westside Realty Management.

20
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,090
How may I direct your call?

21
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,210
Please hold.

22
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,410
Okay, Mike...

23
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:52,850
Alonzo?

24
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,250
Oh, shit. Joe?!

25
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,610
Damn...!
What's up, dog?

26
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,610
- Mikey, look at you.
- What are you doing here, dude?

27
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,490
Mikey, man, check you out.

28
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,690
What the fuck you doing here?

29
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,090
Fucking grew up. I work here.

30
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,570
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,290
Dude, you got to come on up.

32
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,450
Yeah, I'll show you
the office.

33
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,890
Fuck, you're gonna trip, man,

34
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:09,250
I can see the ocean
and everything.

35
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,570
Check you out, fucking
ocean view and all that.

36
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,490
You're wearing a suit now.

37
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,050
- Got your hair cut.
- Hey, watch out, baby.

38
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,170
Yeah. Tag no more, huh?

39
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,530
No, man.

40
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,930
Dude, what's up with
your brother, Pedro?

41
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,970
Oh, man, he's in Iraq.
He's in a forward unit.

42
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,770
Get the fuck out of here. Yeah.

43
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,970
Fuckin' Mexicans.

44
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,730
Bye, sweetie.

45
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,290
Thank you, sir.
I need me some of this, man.

46
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,610
I've been taking piss all day.

47
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:35,570
Dude!

48
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,410
What?

49
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,370
You're not going to

50
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,490
- fucking believe this.
- What?

51
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,570
- I had an interview today.
- Yeah?

52
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,010
- Remember Crazy Joe?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,850
Dude stomped that guy's
face in at Taco Land

54
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,770
for grabbing his chick's ass.

55
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,250
Homeboy got his shit
together, man.

56
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,290
Went to UCLA.

57
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,450
Works at this office
up in Century City.

58
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,810
I got the hookup, dog.

59
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,890
- 12 an hour.
- Hoo-hoo!

60
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,530
- That's a lot of lettuce.
- That's right.

61
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,130
And in three months,
I get benefits.

62
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,130
Damn! Benefits?

63
00:01:58,165 --> 00:01:59,810
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Shit!

64
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,970
Yeah!

65
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,570
It's not for sure yet,
though, dude.

66
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,170
I still got to
meet the owner, right.

67
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,810
But he says I'm straight.

68
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,130
It's all good, you know.

69
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,010
You're in.
Dude...

70
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,450
I'm in.
Oh, shit.

71
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,890
Yeah...
What happened?

72
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:13,450
They want my ass, man.
Going back tomorrow

73
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,770
for a polygraph test.

74
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:16,930
If I pass that, they'll
send me to Georgia next week.

75
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,930
Oh...! Damn!
It's like that?!

76
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,210
What's up, lawman?

77
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:21,490
Whoo-hoo!

78
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,090
How you gonna pass
a lie detector test,

79
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,690
- you lying motherfucker?
- Aw, easy, man.

80
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,410
After every question,
you just fucking squeeze

81
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,010
like you're taking
a dump, you know, man.

82
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,050
- It throws the machine off. Ooh!
- Oh, dog.

83
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,730
You're gonna shit your
pants like that, bro.

84
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,850
Fuck, I think I just did.

85
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,450
All right, Jim,

86
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,250
I'm going to ask you
some control questions

87
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,450
before we get
to the good stuff.

88
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,850
They can be answered
just "yes" or "no."

89
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,930
Just relax and
respond naturally.

90
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,050
Are you ready?

91
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,010
Yes, sir.

92
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,330
You can just answer
"yes" or "no."

93
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,530
"Is your name
Jim Luther Davis?"

94
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,170
Yes.

95
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,690
"Do you live in Los Angeles?"

96
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,130
Yes.

97
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,930
"Are you 26 years old?"

98
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,970
Yes.

99
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,050
"Are you married?"

100
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,810
No.

101
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,850
"Are you wearing shoes?"

102
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,170
Yes.

103
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,130
"Have you ever smoked
marijuana?"

104
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,290
Yes.

105
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,170
"Aside from the occasion you
mentioned in your application?"

106
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,970
No.

107
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,730
Jim, knock it off.

108
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,770
What, sir?

109
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,770
Son, I've been doing
polygraph examinations

110
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,890
since you were swimming
in your daddy's balls.

111
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,290
So I know all the tricks.

112
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,850
You've either got a tack
in your shoe

113
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,770
or you're clinching
your butt.

114
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,490
I've got spikes
all over this thing.

115
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,570
If you do it again,

116
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,770
I'm going to void this test

117
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,770
and report that you
were uncooperative.

118
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,090
Do you understand?

119
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,810
Yes, sir.

120
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,370
Walk with me.

121
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,650
We've got a problem, Jim.

122
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,010
With what?

123
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,530
With your candor.

124
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,570
Come in.

125
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,650
He's here, sir.

126
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,290
Bring him in.

127
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,330
Jim, this is Mr. Hollenbeck,
our regional director.

128
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,290
Pleased to meet you, sir.

129
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,810
Have a seat.

130
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,330
Mr. Gillespie.

131
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,650
Pleased to meet you, sir.

132
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,090
Jim, uh...

133
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,330
you're an exemplary candidate

134
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,610
with valuable
operational experience.

135
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,130
You've cleared the psych
and physical hurdles.

136
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,770
Your credit's good,
you've kept your nose clean,

137
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,210
you've got the Spanish.

138
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,490
You clearance is still valid.

139
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,850
Everybody we talked to
for background

140
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:51,650
had only great things
to say about you.

141
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,690
And then you scored a
negative-five on the polygraph.

142
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,810
That's indicative
of deception.

143
00:04:57,845 --> 00:04:59,370
We were wondering why

144
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,050
until we got the results
of urinalysis.

145
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,690
We detected THC metabolites
in the urine, Jim.

146
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,330
Levels were just below
the positive threshold,

147
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,850
but there was a presence.

148
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,890
Do you have a drug
problem, Mr. Davis?

149
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,370
I don't have a
drug problem, sir.

150
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,570
I made a very
stupid mistake.

151
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,890
Would you care to tell us
the circumstances

152
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,010
of your stupid mistake?

153
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,970
I was at a party...

154
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,970
and someone offered me a joint.

155
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,610
I was pretty angry
about not getting into

156
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,410
the LAPD, so I was feeling
rebellious and, uh...

157
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,890
...I inhaled.

158
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,450
Someone considering a career
in law enforcement

159
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,970
would be well advised
to exercise

160
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,530
a little more discipline.

161
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,370
Yes, sir.

162
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,570
I'm on the fence, Doug.

163
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,050
It's your call.

164
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,290
Mr. Davis, I'm in charge
of several programs.

165
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,210
Yes, sir?

166
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,010
Had a nice chat with your
old commanding officer.

167
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,850
Good.

168
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,130
Recognize these guys?

169
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,570
Huh?
Yeah,

170
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,570
they're your buddies.

171
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,050
Your old Hajji buddies.

172
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,090
You should work in a deli
how you sliced these guys up.

173
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,130
Jesus Christ.

174
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,570
Oh, I'm sorry.

175
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,970
Did I ruin your lunch?

176
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,690
You went through
those sons of bitches

177
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,730
like butter.

178
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,250
I took my objective

179
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,730
and did what was necessary

180
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,650
to obtain information
vital to national security

181
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,730
that saved
American lives.

182
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,530
Whacked them all,
huh, Jim?

183
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:42,730
My C.O. told me not to leave
anything breathing.

184
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,530
- I do what I'm told.
- Relax, son.

185
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,210
You were getting paid
to fuck people up.

186
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,810
You know we're beefing up
our anti-narcotics programs

187
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,250
in Latin America.

188
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,330
Yes, sir.

189
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,050
I had heard some things
on the grapevine.

190
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,650
I want you on my team.

191
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,410
I need someone who
can get things done

192
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,170
on my task force
in Colombia.

193
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,490
Sir...

194
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,090
I listed Los Angeles and
San Diego on my dream sheet.

195
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,810
No slots in southern California?

196
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,410
No, Jim.

197
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,410
I got Colombia.

198
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,210
That's what
I have for you.

199
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,130
If it's not
what you want,

200
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,130
thank you for your time.

201
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,410
You can hit the door.

202
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,930
What exactly would I be doing?

203
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,410
Running and gunning
in the jungle?

204
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,450
Mr. Davis,
this is the deal.

205
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,370
You'll be riding shotgun
with the locals

206
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:30,570
as interpreter-advisor
on sharp end operations.

207
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,970
You'll be in some
very hot areas.

208
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,730
How hot?

209
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,170
We talking trigger time?

210
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,450
Sure, if you want.

211
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,250
Well, who exactly
would I be working for?

212
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,370
The U.S. government, Jim.

213
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,050
I want you in Glynco,
Georgia next week.

214
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,170
You make it through
in one piece,

215
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,570
you'll be working Colombia's
finest by the summer.

216
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,410
It's just that...

217
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,930
I'm supposed to get
married, sir.

218
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,890
Maybe now is not the time
to start a family.

219
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,530
We've been together a long time.

220
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,850
I'm serious about marrying her.

221
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,570
Foreign bride could jeopardize
your security clearance.

222
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,170
Jim, don't shack up
with some Mexican.

223
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:12,450
Colombian broads are
smoking hot and knee deep.

224
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,650
You get a per diem
and a driver.

225
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,730
You'll live like
a fucking king down there.

226
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,730
Yes, sir, I understand.

227
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,770
You take some time,

228
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,170
think about what
you want to do.

229
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,210
This is a serious
commitment.

230
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,490
I want the opportunity, sir.

231
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,370
I want on board.

232
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,530
Welcome aboard.

233
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,010
I'm taking a big
chance on you.

234
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,050
Thank you, sir.

235
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,650
This is the career
I've dreamed of.

236
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,010
These are your orders,

237
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,450
orientation material
and travel money.

238
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,250
Report to FLETC before the end
of working hours Wednesday.

239
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,370
Thank you, sir.

240
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,490
God.

241
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,850
Sorry, dog.

242
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,450
I got the job.

243
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,330
Oh, shit.

244
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,810
Yeah?

245
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,850
Me, too.

246
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,290
- When do you start?
- Monday.

247
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,610
When do you start?

248
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:31,810
Wednesday.

249
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,130
Big Jim, back on
the man's payroll.

250
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,810
Got the W-2

251
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,970
and the employee handbook
as proof of employment.

252
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,930
I will be back in the
arms of my woman tonight.

253
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,010
Good.

254
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,370
Hey, we got to celebrate
this shit.

255
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,850
<i>Salud.</i>

256
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,490
Oh, shit.

257
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,010
Fuzz.

258
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,810
They're on my ass, dog.

259
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,530
<i>And my license is suspended.</i>

260
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,290
Yeah, maybe he's
after someone else.

261
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,410
Shit. Fucking shit, man.

262
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,530
He's pointing right at me.

263
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,530
And we got the open beers.

264
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,370
Fuck the beers, the guns.

265
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,170
Shoot the fucker.

266
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,930
Car's in my name. We're fucked.

267
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:29,410
Shit. Right when shit
was starting to go good, dude,

268
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,490
I'm going to jail.

269
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,730
Damn it, I'm going to jail.

270
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,410
I can dump these guys.

271
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,530
Rip the video
from their trunk.

272
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,130
Let's see them hands.

273
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,130
Let's see your hands

274
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,970
on the fucking dash!

275
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,890
Grab the sky or I'll blow
your fucking heads off.

276
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,010
Blink and die, scumbags.

277
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,570
Oh.

278
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,410
Look who it is, dude.

279
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,930
It's all right,
I know these guys.

280
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,930
You fucking asshole.

281
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,810
You're such a prick.
You scared the fuck out of me.

282
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,010
What's up, homie?

283
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,570
- What's up, fool?
- What's up, man.

284
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,050
I almost shot you, jerk.

285
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,530
That shit wasn't fucking
funny, Leo.

286
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,530
Yeah, it was hilarious.

287
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,170
You guys getting
fucked up?

288
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,370
Of course, dog, it's Friday.

289
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,610
Well, Boot,
you in the Academy yet?

290
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,570
Fuck no.

291
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,850
Fuck the LAPD.

292
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,290
It's local small-time bullshit.

293
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,370
I'm going with the feds.

294
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,450
How'd you get that hook-up, dog?

295
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,530
You know, me, got my
connects, you know.

296
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,570
Going to FLETC on Wednesday.

297
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,250
Hey, see you can
get me in there.

298
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,890
Yeah, I'll look into that.

299
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,610
How's Sylvia?

300
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,730
None of your concern,
ass wipe.

301
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,010
Say hi to her for me, no?

302
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,330
No.

303
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,810
This <i>vato</i>'s all protective
of his female.

304
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,890
Check this out.

305
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,410
Nice, huh?

306
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,850
It's a nine?
Uh-huh.

307
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,610
Sorry, dog, I got
a lot of nines.

308
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,170
Come on, dude,
it's a bad-ass Ruger.

309
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,410
Talk to Toussaint.
He'll buy that shit.

310
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,290
Toussaint, he's...
he's in Florida.

311
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,730
He's back.
He called me today.

312
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,970
Page me tonight, bro.

313
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,770
We'll hit the clubs and
tear up some fine <i>hinas</i>.

314
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,370
Later.
Sure, dog.

315
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,810
I'm on the City's time.

316
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,410
You guys be cool.

317
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,330
Okay?

318
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,170
That fuck--
he put a scare in me.

319
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,450
Yeah, me, too.

320
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,570
He's a dick.

321
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,250
Want to party with him?

322
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,090
See if this motherfucker's
home, dude.

323
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:51,210
Toussaint? Toussaint?!

324
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,290
Yo, Toussaint?

325
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,610
Yeah, come on, man.

326
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,330
Can't go far in that
little fucking place of yours.

327
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:59,370
Goddammit,
I'm coming.

328
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,170
Chill out.

329
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,970
Washing that dirty ass.

330
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,850
Damn it.

331
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,410
Group love. Group... Come on.

332
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,530
Group love, boys.

333
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,210
Welcome back, hometown.

334
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,530
Hey, I missed you
crazy fuckers, man.

335
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,010
Leo told us
you were back.

336
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,170
Thanks for calling
asshole.

337
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,730
You a cop?

338
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:33,010
Uh-uh. Going federal.

339
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:37,050
Man, craziest head I know

340
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,170
is going

341
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,130
to be a fed.

342
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,290
Yes, sir! Sir.

343
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:43,930
Still sponging off your woman?

344
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,290
Fuck you, dog. I got a job.

345
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,290
This motherfucker.

346
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,650
Look, dude.

347
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,050
This is bad.

348
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,530
It's yours for three
big ones, dog.

349
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,370
Fuck yeah, I want it.

350
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,890
What's up?
What's up?

351
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,530
Huh?

352
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,890
What the fuck you
say now, huh?

353
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,410
Hey. Huh?

354
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,970
Bam, bam, bam.

355
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,850
Motherfucker,
I'm strapped.

356
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,170
What the fuck
is up now, huh?

357
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,890
Whoo-ooh!

358
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,050
Whoa, whoa.

359
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,530
Your kneecap and shit.

360
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,770
Step up and get blasted.

361
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,610
Shit, man, what
the fuck is up now?

362
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,450
Hey, kick back, gunslinger.

363
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:31,410
It's loaded.

364
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,690
That shit goes through walls.

365
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:33,850
You pop the neighbor's
little kids.

366
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,210
Uh-oh.

367
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,490
Ooh.

368
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,170
Fuck, dude.

369
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:44,130
Whoa, I'm straight, bro.

370
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,210
Yo, guys, we got
to party tonight, you know?

371
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,970
Go clubbin' or something.

372
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:51,250
I got a better idea.

373
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:52,210
What?

374
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,210
Here, sir.

375
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,010
Let's go to Mexico.

376
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,610
Mexico?!

377
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,610
- Yeah.
- I'm in.

378
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,130
Only fags like that...

379
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,050
Because you're a little faggot.

380
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:09,490
I don't get it,
too much fucking hills.

381
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,570
Right, right.

382
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,810
Dude, yo, dude, stay back boy,
stay back.

383
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:16,090
Motherfucker's got to ask
permission.

384
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,890
Fuck you, all right?

385
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,610
Let me tell
you something.

386
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,570
I am a grown motherfucking man,
all right?

387
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,250
I'm going to tell her
the good news,

388
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,490
make up, grab my shit
and we are out.

389
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,850
Lines, lines, and more lines.

390
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,130
For many passengers
traveling through LAX,

391
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,170
the waiting has become
unbearable.

392
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,610
It's hit or miss,
you can't predict it...

393
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:37,490
Excuse me, you're not
made out of glass.

394
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:38,450
I'm made out of me.

395
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,010
You're drunk.

396
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,490
I'm celebrating, baby.

397
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,810
What, another wasted day?

398
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,210
Here.

399
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,490
...security since 9-11,
but that's true everywhere.

400
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,530
...and still a recent study shows
the wait at LAX

401
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,050
is the third longest
in the world...

402
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,010
This is a good company.

403
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,170
They make all
the new condos downtown.

404
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,130
How much?

405
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,170
$12 an hour.

406
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,130
Plus their MIS guy

407
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,290
is leaving in three months.

408
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,010
I'm going to update
my certifications

409
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,210
and take his job over.

410
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,330
Then I'll make bank.

411
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,410
Such an asshole.

412
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,290
What? Why?
This shit is real.

413
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,210
This is a great job,
the pay is outstanding

414
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,010
and it's a great opportunity
for me to do what I want to do.

415
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,730
I know.

416
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,770
It's so... it's so Mike,
you know.

417
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,930
You can't just go out
and get a shitty job.

418
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,330
You gotta... you gotta get a...

419
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:30,290
A dream job?

420
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:31,570
Yeah, a dream job.

421
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,450
Well, why shouldn't your
dream guy have a dream job?

422
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:36,410
...the ambitious plans
of many opponents

423
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,250
on the County Board
of Supervisors...

424
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,730
Come here, I have a job for you.

425
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,770
What the fuck
is taking so long?

426
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,250
I knew this
shit would happen.

427
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,530
She hates my ass.

428
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,770
She's not going
to let him go.

429
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:08,530
Go knock.

430
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,570
Dude, go knock.

431
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,850
Bro, drag his fucking
ass out of there.

432
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,210
Yo, Miguel.

433
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,970
Hey.

434
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,810
Mike, hurry up.

435
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,730
Hey.

436
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,530
Yo, what the fuck
are you doing?

437
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,850
Come on, dude.

438
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,890
Dog, I'm tearin'
it up, man.

439
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,170
I'm hittin' it, bro.
It's been a few days.

440
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,730
You guys just go ahead, man.
I'm gonna chill.

441
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,090
What?

442
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,490
I'm just gonna kick it here
with the woman.

443
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,050
You said you'd go, man.

444
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,610
Your woman's in your head.

445
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,610
That's wrong.

446
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:55,890
She's got your nuts, bro.

447
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,770
Dog, dog...

448
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,650
Sylvia's all happy 'cause I
got a job, all right, dude?

449
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,450
She wants us to
fuckin' chill together.

450
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,930
Man, that girl put
the zap on your head.

451
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,490
This is our last
chance to hang.

452
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,730
- You're like my brother.
- Yeah.

453
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,330
You're all I got.
You're gonna dog me like that?

454
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,610
I ain't no fucking do...

455
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,730
How are you, baby?

456
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,850
Hey, Sylvia, he's
going to Mexico.

457
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,050
No, he isn't, Jim.
Yes, he is.

458
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,930
I'm joining the feds. I'm gone,
I'm out of here next week.

459
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,450
The least
you can do

460
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,810
is let my best friend

461
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,090
see me off.

462
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,210
Baby, it's not safe.

463
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,650
All you're going
to do is drink.

464
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,570
Aw, fuck, man.

465
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,250
Mike, come on.

466
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,050
Come on, fuck, man!

467
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,810
Come on,
you promised.

468
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,330
You promised, man.

469
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,290
Yo... I promised,
Sylvia, okay?

470
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,130
Mike, you're not
going to Mexico.

471
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,810
What?

472
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,290
You're not going.

473
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:53,330
I'm not your fucking
puppet, Sylvia.

474
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,650
All right, you know what,
do what you want.

475
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,850
But I'm not going to be
here when you get back.

476
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,010
That's fucked up.

477
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,970
Why you got to lay
that bullshit on him?

478
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,810
Because I don't want him
going with you, Jim.

479
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,770
You're fucking nuts.

480
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,970
You're crazy
and you're dangerous,

481
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,850
and my biggest nightmare
is you with a fucking badge.

482
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:10,290
You're the last person
who should have one.

483
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,250
Yeah?
Yeah.

484
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,370
That's not bullshit,
it's the truth.

485
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,650
Fuck this!

486
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,730
Whoa, wait.

487
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,170
Whatever, man.

488
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,610
Fuckin' thanks, homie!

489
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:19,690
Yeah, laters.

490
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,010
Bye.

491
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,330
Yo, yo.

492
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,610
I'm going.

493
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,930
I gotta go.

494
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,530
Get the fuck out
of here, go!

495
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,530
Go!

496
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,250
Fuck this shit, man.

497
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,530
Good night, Sylvia.

498
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,610
Kiss my ass, Jim.

499
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,570
Oh, any time, sellout.

500
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,170
Oh, you going to be happy
once he's dead? Huh?

501
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,010
Hey, Toussaint.

502
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:50,650
I heard the battle, man.

503
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,850
Yo, your lady didn't
want you going, huh?

504
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,290
No, but I'm going.

505
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:55,770
- Hell, yeah.
- Shit.

506
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,290
- I'm a motherfucking man.
- That's right.

507
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,290
Shit. I walk
the Earth at will.

508
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,170
- Damn right.
- I do whatever the fuck I want.

509
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,170
You know, we're men, right?

510
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,370
- We're men, right?
- That's right.

511
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,610
That's what we do, right?

512
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,210
Amen. And don't worry--

513
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,370
home girl will be right there
waiting when you get back.

514
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,490
You're right. You're right.

515
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,690
She wouldn't play
that shit like that.

516
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,050
Shit, I got a fucking job
for real.

517
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:12,930
You did.

518
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,410
Plus you're my homie, dog.
You're my homie.

519
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,010
You're going to go fucking
do your thing

520
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,770
- and this is it.
- No, shit, dude.

521
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,770
Yo, we're all dogs.

522
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,050
I got you guys
back, man.

523
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,130
No doubt,
no doubt.

524
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,810
It's just going to be
fucking cool, yo.

525
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,490
I got a job,
you got a job.

526
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,930
Shit, I got some bud.

527
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,250
- We got some smokes.
- We got some

528
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,930
- motherfucking money.
- We are on a mission.

529
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,810
Let's get our heads together
so we can achieve our objective

530
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,930
in a timely manner.

531
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,450
Let's get deployed, people.

532
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,610
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

533
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,730
Rise and fucking shine.

534
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,170
Come on, ladies.
Chow time.

535
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,330
Chow's getting cold.

536
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,250
- Oh, what the fuck, Jim?
- Chill, dude.

537
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,690
Dude, where are we?

538
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,570
Family, man.

539
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,130
Damn!
It's a shizzack...

540
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,090
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

541
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,490
It's a home, all right?

542
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,650
Respect, bro.

543
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,450
Straighten up, fellas.

544
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,530
My old lady, Marta.

545
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,490
<i>Hola.</i>

546
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,650
Mike.
<i>Hola, mucho gusto.</i>

547
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,090
<i>Hola,</i> Mike.
Toussaint.

548
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,530
<i>Hola. Hola. Hola.</i>

549
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,090
<i>Hola. Marisa.</i>

550
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,170
<i>Buenos dias. Mi mama.</i>

551
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,130
<i>Mucho gusto. Marta's mom.</i>

552
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,010
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

553
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,290
Vicki.
Vicki.

554
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,170
<i>La prima, esa es mi prima.</i>

555
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,290
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

556
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,450
<i>Mucho gusto. Mike. Vicki.</i>

557
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,130
Toussaint.

558
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,290
Vicki.

559
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,730
Okay.

560
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,210
Hey, grab yourselves a rock.

561
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:05,890
<i>S? por favor, sientense.</i>

562
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,090
Vicki?

563
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,730
<i>¿Caf? quieren caf?</i>

564
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,610
<i>S? caf? por favor.</i>
<i>Vicki, andale.</i>

565
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,770
<i>Tranquila,</i> baby.

566
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,810
¡Mama!

567
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,890
Yeah, w-what's
she saying, dude?

568
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,890
Oh, they... they
think you're cool.

569
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,010
Oh, sweet.

570
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,970
<i>Aqu?tienes. Gracias.</i>

571
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,210
- <i>Caliente.</i>
- Thank you.

572
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,050
Dude...

573
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,490
Marta's fine as fuck, bro.

574
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,650
Hey, hey, hey...

575
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,650
I'm just saying, dude.
You need to marry her, bro.

576
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,930
If you don't,
you're a fool.

577
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,970
<i>¿Que dice?</i>

578
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,850
Oh...

579
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,890
Oh, that shit's good, man.

580
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,330
No shit, you know they got that
good fucking weed from here.

581
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,170
That's what I want.
Some of that good shit.

582
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,490
You know where some fields
are or something, Jim?

583
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,930
Yeah, that's not... I want to
see, like, where they grow it.

584
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,050
You know, and then maybe

585
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,090
they'll let us go out
and, like, pick some.

586
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,170
You know, pick some of
that really good weed.

587
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,530
Shit.

588
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,690
Toussaint?

589
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,250
This is nice.

590
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,490
This is beautiful, man.

591
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,570
Dog, you see this?

592
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,810
Here.

593
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,130
Mmm...

594
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,250
Beautiful...

595
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,490
Man!

596
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,890
Mmm!

597
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,930
When the hell'd you get
all the <i>pistos</i>, dog?

598
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,170
<i>Mexico,</i> man.

599
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,170
It's magic.

600
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:49,290
He bleed?

601
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,250
Like a stuffed pig.

602
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,130
How'd Letty know you were
tearing up her sister?

603
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,570
That fuckin' bitch Patti, right?

604
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,210
- Ah...
- I took her to dinner.

605
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,450
Took her for a cruise
up to Malibu, you know?

606
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,050
Got up all in it.
Back of my ride...

607
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,690
Pounded that fish, man.

608
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,010
Good fuckin' fish.

609
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,130
I figured the crazy broad

610
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,410
pulled out some hairs and pubes

611
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,090
and stashed it in the seat,
you know?

612
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,610
Oh, dude, you got to watch that
shit, man.

613
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,850
Chicks get treacherous.

614
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,370
Yeah, no shit.
Sibling rivalry, Jim.

615
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,730
Next day,

616
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,090
I'm driving around with Letty
all kick back and shit,

617
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,370
and she radars in
on this rat's nest, man.

618
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,050
Pulls out these long-ass hairs,
she's like "What are these?"

619
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,010
"Whose are these?"

620
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,450
She sees all the pubes mixed in,
man... fuckin' busted.

621
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,370
Busted!
Busted!

622
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,610
Oh!

623
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,890
Dude, how'd she know
they were her sister's?

624
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,330
Oh, come on, dude.

625
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,850
Mexican chick voodoo,
right, Mike?

626
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,330
You know,
live and learn.

627
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,730
Yep, next time you'll be all up
in your ride

628
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,530
with the Super
Vac, dude.
Treachery!

629
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,530
Yep, treachery.

630
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,250
Um...

631
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,930
shouldn't we be

632
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,130
helping them?

633
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,570
You know how to hand wash?

634
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,130
- No.
- Then don't sweat it.

635
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,170
Yeah, we're men.

636
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,690
They know we don't do that shit.

637
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,650
That's right.

638
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,970
We're men.

639
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:09,010
Oh, yeah!

640
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,290
This is paradise, huh?

641
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,610
Mm-hmm.

642
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,930
Yo, Mike?

643
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,370
Yeah?

644
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,570
They're sending me to Colombia.

645
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,650
Colombia.

646
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,250
Who, the man?

647
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,130
Yep.

648
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,250
They're tearing shit up down
there, they need my help.

649
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,050
Doing what?

650
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:37,890
Busting up drug labs
and drug lords

651
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,530
- and all that shit.
- You got it.

652
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,930
Gonna be an advisor, you know--
shoot him, him and him.

653
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,010
Then it's back to the barracks
for bitches and beer.

654
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,810
I'm set.

655
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,890
Why do you want to do
that shit, dude?

656
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,450
I mean...

657
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,690
what about Marta, you know?

658
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:53,690
I mean...

659
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,570
Ain't gonna happen.

660
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,970
They told me not to get married.

661
00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:59,850
That's messed.

662
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,890
They really told you that?

663
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,570
Not straight up,
but I heard 'em.

664
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,330
Yo, if the feds won't let you
hook up with your old lady,

665
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:06,970
you need to tell them
to fuck off.

666
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,370
Yeah, I mean,

667
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,970
you love her,
she loves you, right?

668
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,530
Dude, you need to move
down here, marry Marta,

669
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,970
you know, get a good-ass job

670
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,490
working with fucking
tourists or something.

671
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,850
Fuck that.

672
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,050
Taking bucket baths
in cold-ass water?

673
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,850
You know, wading around
in ankle-deep mud?

674
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,850
Outhouses, man!

675
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,770
Fuckin' outhouses!

676
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,770
You told Marta yet?

677
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,050
You love this place.

678
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,250
It's in your eyes, man.

679
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,610
Dude, this is
what it's all about.

680
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,730
You got a woman that loves
you and a place to stay.

681
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,330
You'd be happy here,
and you know it.

682
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,490
Yeah, well,
shacking up with Marta,

683
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:53,410
squeezing out some puppies,
has its appeal, but...

684
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,650
this is my career.

685
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,570
I got one shot.

686
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,130
You're making
a mistake.

687
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,730
You should stay right
here with your lady.

688
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,090
What the fuck you gonna do

689
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,890
in Colombia?

690
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,890
Whack people,

691
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,130
program shit.

692
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,690
You ain't down, fuck you.

693
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,530
Bring in my gunships

694
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,490
and smoke your little jungle
hideaway. You know?

695
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,090
I mean, I'm a solider
of the apocalypse, man.

696
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,290
I'll be in a chopper,

697
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,890
door-gunning villagers
and shit. Fuck 'em.

698
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,650
Kill the chickens
and dogs, too, man.

699
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:33,370
I don't give a fuck.

700
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,850
Shh, shh...

701
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,730
Yeah.

702
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,410
Doce años.

703
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,970
- Doce años.
- Doce años...

704
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,130
Doce... we've been
together that long.

705
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,370
<i>Es muy bonita.</i>

706
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,690
Man, you're bring sand
to the beach, dumb ass.

707
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:42,850
- Cover that shit up.
- Jim, dude!

708
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,010
Huh?

709
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,370
How you say, um, "You're
beautiful" in Spanish?

710
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,930
Huh? <i>"Bonita."</i>
<i>Bonita.</i>

711
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,370
Come on, you don't know
that shit, Toussaint?

712
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,130
<i>Tu... bonita.</i>

713
00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:55,210
<i>Gracias.</i>

714
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,690
Hey, baby, see my new one?

715
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,970
- Right, did I get it?
- Huh?

716
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,210
Think I got it?

717
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,250
Yeah, she got the point.

718
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,530
Yo, Mike, that chick digs you.

719
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,330
What chick?

720
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,770
Oh, she's good, dog.

721
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,890
Yeah, name's Lila.

722
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,890
She's a freak.
She'll fuck you, dude.

723
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,010
She's a freak, huh?

724
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,650
How you know? You fuck her?

725
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,650
No, out of respect
for Marta.

726
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,690
Not that I don't want...
Hey, baby.

727
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,050
Ask her to dance.

728
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,170
I'm not cheating
on Sylvia, dude.

729
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,970
There's a big gap between
dancing and fucking, man.

730
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,810
Go explore it.

731
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,530
No shit.

732
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,210
Whoo!

733
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,090
No.

734
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,730
You're fucking nuts.

735
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,890
You fucked up, woman.

736
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,370
I'll do it.

737
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,810
It's easy.

738
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,410
Jim!

739
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,050
What's up, man, huh?

740
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,530
Where's Toussaint?

741
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,930
He's dancing.

742
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,890
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

743
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,850
- You gonna get back

744
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:45,970
to the party?
- Yeah.

745
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,130
Let's get back
to the party, man.

746
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,370
- Yeah.
- Hey, uh, go,

747
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,970
go tell Toussaint that

748
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,490
we're gonna get the
fuck out of here, man.

749
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,090
Just go into the party,
tell him we're gonna go.

750
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,050
We're leaving, huh?

751
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,490
Yeah, yeah, we're
gonna leave.

752
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,090
Let's go, yeah?

753
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,210
Yeah, let's go.

754
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,570
Go ahead, go get
Toussaint, man.

755
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,570
Go get him.

756
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,770
Hey, we're going.

757
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,730
Come on.

758
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,690
Fuck you, dude.

759
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,650
I'm having a
great time, bro.

760
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,650
Then walk back to L.A.,
motherfucker.

761
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,050
You're in the car or not.

762
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,810
He's fucking crazy, man.
What the fuck!

763
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,730
All right,
let's go, man.

764
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,770
Hey, yo, what the fuck
is your problem, psycho?!

765
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,450
Hey, hey, homeboy's
losing it, all right?

766
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,370
Shut the fuck up and just
get in the car, all right?

767
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,410
Fucking bullshit!

768
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,050
Fucked up!

769
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:13,210
Dude, dude... dude, slow down.

770
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,930
Fuck, man.

771
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,410
Whoo, yeah, man.

772
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,010
Slow down,
you crazy motherfucker!

773
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,690
I want a cop to pull me over.

774
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,330
Treachery.

775
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,170
Fucking treachery.

776
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,410
Jim, slow down!

777
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,530
Shut up!

778
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,010
Fuck, dude.

779
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,890
Only female I trust.

780
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,650
Fuck you, God!

781
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,130
You ain't got the fucking balls
to take my ass.

782
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,970
Jim, don't say that shit, dude.

783
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,570
Jim!

784
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,930
Dude, you are getting
out of control, okay?

785
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,370
You need psychiatric
help, man.

786
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,570
You're seriously
fucked up, dude.

787
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:24,850
All right, you need to sue
the military or something.

788
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,530
You used to be mellow.

789
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,970
Later, homie.

790
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,690
'Night, dog.

791
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,850
Laters.

792
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,770
Dude, I ain't hanging
around you anymore

793
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,050
until you get
some fucking help.

794
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,690
You can 12-step off, bitch.

795
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,930
You're dismissed.

796
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,890
He's right, dude.

797
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:57,890
Yeah.

798
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,130
Georgia will get me
squared away.

799
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,890
Hope so.

800
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,250
What was that shit
with Marta, dude?

801
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:13,810
I don't know why that happened.

802
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,930
But I'm cool.
I'm cool now.

803
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,730
Okay?

804
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,530
Yeah.

805
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,170
I'm cool.

806
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,010
Look, dude, she told me
she was pregnant.

807
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:38,730
I had a panic attack.

808
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,810
I pulled my gun.

809
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,010
Come on, dog,

810
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,730
I thought you loved her, dude.

811
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,170
I do.

812
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,170
God, fuck.

813
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,850
Come on, man, let's
go drop off that bud.

814
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,330
What bud?

815
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,090
There's 20 kilos in the trunk.

816
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,370
Say that again?

817
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,490
There's 20 kilos
in the trunk, man.

818
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:03,250
- Of weed?
- Yeah.

819
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,530
Get the fuck out of here, man.

820
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,970
I picked it up at the party.

821
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,250
I'm dropping it at Casper's.

822
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,850
Casper's?

823
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,570
I get three Gs.

824
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,530
We get three Gs.

825
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,090
You drove it across the border?

826
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,130
Yeah.

827
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,410
What if they would've caught us?

828
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,170
Couldn't happen, man.

829
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,650
My shit is on fire
right now, man.

830
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,210
My shit is wired
right now, man.

831
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,290
You risked my ass
without telling me?

832
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,010
That's not cool, man.
For three fucking Gs?

833
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,610
That's... that's a good rate
for transporting that.

834
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,530
Shit, if I'd
told you,

835
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,690
you would have gotten

836
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,250
all fucking hinkey at the
border, man, gotten us nabbed.

837
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,170
I wouldn't have been
in the fucking car, dude!

838
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,490
I would've been on
motherfucking Greyhound.

839
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,410
That's a serious breach
of the homie code, man,

840
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,970
not fuckin' telling me.

841
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,570
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry, you know.

842
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,770
I should've had...
I should've got you guys,

843
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,290
you know,
walk across the border.

844
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,730
I could've met
you somewhere.

845
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,850
But, you know, I got
bills, I got shit.

846
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,130
I gotta put my shit
in storage.

847
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,370
I gotta get gas
out to Georgia.

848
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,250
Oh, fuck your money woes, dog!

849
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,290
I am not catching
a fuckin' case for you.

850
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,170
Let me out of the fucking car
right now.

851
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,730
Fuck, man. Come on, man,
let's drop this shit off.

852
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,690
Let's get paid!

853
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,130
Let me out right here.

854
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,530
Mi-Mi-Mi-Mike! Listen, listen!

855
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:13,850
Let me out right here,
right now!

856
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,770
You will feel so much better
with a fistful of twenties.

857
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,370
Huh?

858
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,810
Dude, we're drunk,

859
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,370
and we got a trunk full of
fuckin' weed, dude, I am not...

860
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,810
Okay, fuckin', Mike,
don't bitch out on me!

861
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:28,850
Don't fucking bitch out on me!

862
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,330
I am still on probation,
dick head.

863
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,850
Let me out now!

864
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,010
Let me out right here
right fuckin' now, dude!

865
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,730
Let me get paid, will you?

866
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,170
Will you fuckin'
let me get paid?!

867
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,210
Oh, yo, get paid, man.

868
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,210
Fuckin' go for it,
all right?

869
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,610
Just let me get the fuck out.
I don't give a fuck, dude.

870
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,650
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

871
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,010
What the fuck
are you doing, Jim?

872
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,570
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

873
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,690
Fuck you!

874
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,090
Fuck, I'm sorry, dude,

875
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,170
I'm sorry, dude.

876
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,130
Okay? I'm sorry.

877
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,370
Why the fuck did you put
a gun to my head?

878
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,050
Huh?

879
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,370
You gonna shoot me?

880
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,010
No, man. I'm sorry.
I was trippin'.

881
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,090
I'd never...

882
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:22,130
I'd never put a fuckin' gun
to your head, dude

883
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,290
I know.

884
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,690
I know you wouldn't, man.
I'm sorry.

885
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,050
First your lady, now me, man.
What the fuck is up?

886
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,970
I'm not thinking.

887
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,410
I got too much shit going on.

888
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:38,330
Oh, fuck, I'm just faded,
man, that's all.

889
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,250
I'm just fuckin'
fade right now, okay?

890
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,730
I'll cruise
you by your pad.

891
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,850
I'll drop you
off, man.

892
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,130
I'm sorry.

893
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,570
Yeah. You're a fuck-up.

894
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:53,370
I'm going with you so you
don't fuck this shit up, too.

895
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:57,730
We'll go to Casper's...
get the money.

896
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:58,690
Yeah.

897
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,130
Then you can
drop me off home,

898
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,850
you can go to Georgia fed out
and be the fuckin' man.

899
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,210
Yeah, I'm gonna be
the fucking man.

900
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,730
I can drop you
off, you know.

901
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,410
Take you up the hill.

902
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,770
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

903
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,570
No.

904
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,050
Keep on going.

905
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,010
Looks sketchy.

906
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,050
I don't know.

907
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,130
Ho, what, you gonna
shoot their pigeons?

908
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,250
Yeah.

909
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,530
Just hurry up.

910
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,170
Yo, Casper!

911
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,010
<i>Buenos noches, señor.</i>

912
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,890
<i>¿Tiene los?cosatles?</i>

913
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,090
Go pop the trunk, dude.

914
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,770
<i>Con permiso.</i>

915
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,010
What's up, Casper?

916
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,050
What up, Jim?

917
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,050
What's crackin', man.

918
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,490
Is that you, Mike?

919
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,410
Whassup, homes?

920

Yo, Casper.

921
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,010
Nothing, homey.
How you been?

922
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:41,970
Still with Sylvia?

923
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:43,530
Hope so.

924
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,890
Gonna find out tonight.

925
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,210
So whassup with
your brother, dog?

926
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,290
Fernie?

927
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,850
Got blasted by the hulas
awhile back, <i>ese</i>.

928
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,170
Damn.

929
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,130
Sorry to hear that, dog.

930
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,490
You play, you pay.

931
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,770
He knew what time it was.

932
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,410
Right.

933
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,050
Hey, we gotta bounce.

934
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,290
You got the money?

935
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,570
Yeah, just let me
check the shit, okay?

936
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,730
Yo, bring the feria, homey!

937
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,490
How's your old lady?

938
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,210
Eh... bitch finally
graduated, yo.

939
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,530
Oh, fuck it!

940
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,330
Yeah, now she can
support my ass, eh?

941
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,570
I got all the feria
right here, dog.

942
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,330
It's all rolled
up and shit.

943
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,210
You know what I mean?

944
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,690
Ready to go, dog.
Check this out, homes.

945
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:21,650
Ah, hell, nah!

946
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:22,970
Yo, hold up, dog.
Don't trip.

947
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,690
I know these fools.
They're with me, <i>ese</i>.

948
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,770
These are the fools
that jacked me, man!

949
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,010
Fuck these motherfuckers!
I'm shooting both of 'em!

950
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,250
At least give the homeboy
a pass right here, dog.

951
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:31,330
Yeah, yeah,
let him bounce.

952
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,370
I don't give a fuck.

953
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,810
I want this white boy
in a box, though.

954
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:34,890
Hey, you in the ride.

955
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,490
I ever see you again,
<i>ese</i>, you best be

956
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,770
getting your last supper,
'cause you're a dead man.

957
00:45:38,805 --> 00:45:40,050
Hey, just get the fuck
outta here, Mike.

958
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:41,530
Take off, homey.

959
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,490
I'll be cool.

960
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,450
What the fuck?

961
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,850
Don't trip, <i>ese</i>.
I'm cool.

962
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,570
Chill, dog! Chill, dog!

963
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,050
I got three kids...

964
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:02,170
Oh, no, please,
sir! Please!

965
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,370
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Jim, no!

966
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,330
Please, please.

967
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,330
Why the fuck
did you do that?

968
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:29,930
Pull the door!

969
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,730
Oh, my God, Jim!

970
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:13,650
I'm hit bad.

971
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,090
What have we done?

972
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,250
I can't move my arm...
and I can't feel my legs!

973
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,610
I can't move shit.

974
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,770
I'm fucked up.
I'm fucked up.

975
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,090
I'm fucked up.

976
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:35,770
Okay...

977
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:37,250
Don't trip...

978
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,770
Don't trip, dog.

979
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,890
County Hospital's
right there.

980
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,210
No! No! No!
County Hospital...

981
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,650
Don't you dare
take me there!

982
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,450
Don't you dare!

983
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,090
I'm not going
out like that.

984
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,210
No, we're going.
No, no...

985
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,010
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, we're going.

986
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,650
No medical treatment.
No medical treatment.

987
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,330
But, but...

988
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,810
Mike, Mike...

989
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,410
You gotta kill me.

990
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,330
You gotta kill me.

991
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,770
Why? Why?

992
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:05,690
I fucked up.

993
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:06,850
Everything's shitty.

994
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,770
No, no...

995
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,370
Mercy kill me.

996
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:13,130
Ah... ah, please,

997
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:16,170
Ah, oh, no, dude.

998
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,450
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

999
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:19,930
No, everything's
gonna be fine.

1000
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,330
Jim, shh-shh, shh-shh,
shh-shh, shh-shh.

1001
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,370
Everything's gonna
be fine.

1002
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,650
Everything's gonna be fine.

1003
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,850
Take a look at me,
you dumb fuck!

1004
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,210
Everything's gonna be fine?!

1005
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:29,970
Come on...

1006
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,850
You take my piece...

1007
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,770
and you put it
to my fuckin' head...

1008
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:37,810
and you pull
the trigger.

1009
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,530
You fuckin' step up...

1010
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,210
No...

1011
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,090
...and you do it.

1012
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,210
No.

1013
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,010
'Cause I can't.

1014
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,450
Don't be a fuckin' pussy.

1015
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:53,730
Oh, my God...

1016
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,170
Don't think about it.

1017
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:56,850
Huh?

1018
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:57,810
Do it.

1019
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,010
Please.

1020
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,050
Just kill you and bail?

1021
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:03,330
Yeah.

1022
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,850
Just take off.

1023
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:07,290
And don't look back...

1024
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,810
or you'll...

1025
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,330
or you'll turn into
a pillar of salt.

1026
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,570
Hey... Hey...

1027
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,410
you wanted to know what it was
like to kill someone.

1028
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:21,050
What's up, huh?

1029
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,250
No one's gonna know.

1030
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,690
Hmm?

1031
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,490
Just you...

1032
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,450
and just me.

1033
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,050
And God.

1034
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,650
No fuckin' way.

1035
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,010
- Huh?
- No fuckin' way.

1036
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:34,970
You're crazy; I'm not
shootin' you, dog.

1037
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,170
It's mercy, dog.

1038
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,250
It's mercy.

1039
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,810
I deserve that.

1040
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,410
I'd do it for you.

1041
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,410
I'd do it for you.

1042
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:49,130
Yeah.

1043
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,050
Take it.

1044
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,610
Yeah, yeah.

1045
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,090
JIM
Yeah, yeah... yeah...

1046
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,250
D-Don't, don't
think about it.

1047
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:09,450
Don't think about it.

1048
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,610
Yeah, yeah...

1049
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,770
Ah, yeah.

Yeah.

Ah... ah...

1052
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,370
You did this to yourself,
you stupid fuck!

1053
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,570
You're always doing
stupid shit!

1054
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,330
- I gotta fuckin' fix it!
- Okay, okay.

1055
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,530
Is that what you
fuckin' want?!

1056
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,650
- Yes.
- Huh?

1057
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,090
You want me to fuckin'
fix your head,

1058
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,570
- once and for all?!
- Come on, it's easy.

1059
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,890
It's easy.
No! Bullshit!

1060
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,410
Bullshit! Not for me!

1061

I love you,
fuckin' shit bag.

1062
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,530
I love you, too.

1063
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,570
I'm gonna miss you, brother.

1064
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,050
I'm sorry.

1065
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,090
I'm sorry.

1066
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:55,850
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

1067
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:58,770
Yeah.

1068
