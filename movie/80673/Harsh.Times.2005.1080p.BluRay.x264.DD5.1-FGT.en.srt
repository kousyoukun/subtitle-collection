1
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,823
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Heads up!

2
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:39,243
Man down! Cease fire!

3
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,626
Stupid motherfucker!

4
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:33,962
I was gonna wake you and say goodbye

5
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,384
No smoking in the house

6
00:03:57,223 --> 00:03:58,306
Bad dreams?

7
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:11,340
Yeah. Real trippy shit.

8
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:19,882
Bad habit laying around
with your eyes closed.

9
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,890
That's when they get you.

10
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:32,997
I'll protect you.

11
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:38,210
If I could dream your bad dreams for you,
I would.

12
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,015
No, you wouldn't.

13
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:41,217
Yes. I would.

14
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:45,348
You don't know what I'd do for you.

15
00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:52,367
When are you coming back?

16
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:54,172
Don't know.

17
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,578
Depends on when training starts...

18
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,066
Then I won't be back for a while

19
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,088
I have to go.

20
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:13,622
No, please don't go.

21
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:17,552
Time freezes when you're gone

22
00:05:26,857 --> 00:05:30,988
The first weekend off. I'll come down
and we'll see the judge...

23
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,998
and sign the papers...

24
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,891
and get your visa, get
you over the border...

25
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,904
and be together forever.

26
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,035
This lifetime is enough for me.

27
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:39,335
What's up, Sylvia?

28
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:46,260
Cute little outfit.

29
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:47,844
You look nice.

30
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:48,845
Mike's in the bedroom.

31
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:49,930
Yeah?

32
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:56,903
Man, I said you look nice.

33
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,691
I have a court appearance, Jim.

34
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:01,859
Well, you just give 'em hell.

35
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:08,200
Hey.

36
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:10,286
Spiffy duds, huh?

37
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:13,587
You look like
a gift-wrapped turd.

38
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:15,457
Now please leave me alone.
I have to concentrate.

39
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:17,293
I have two filings
and a deposition today.

40
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:18,961
Play nice, kids.

41
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:21,965
What up, dog?

42
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:24,050
- Nothing. Just got back.
- Cool. Cool.

43
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,552
How was Mexico, dog?

44
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:27,971
Oh, it was a dream, man.

45
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,057
- Loving my woman.
- Right.

46
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:32,775
That's it. I'm out of here.

47
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,646
Those are copies
of your resumé.

48
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:36,731
Pass them out like candy.

49
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:38,149
'Cause I can always
print up more.

50
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:39,984
And just call me
if anything happens, okay?

51
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:42,820
And no drinking.

52
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:45,324
Come on, baby, be cool.

53
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,575
Honey, I'm serious.

54
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:48,709
No drinking. Okay?

55
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:51,079
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

56
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:55,250
Good luck.

57
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,504
Your suit's fine, okay?

58
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:06,179
Dude, she called me
a gift-wrapped turd.

59
00:08:07,513 --> 00:08:08,765
Don't be fucking
with her, dude.

60
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:10,566
She's pissed.

61
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,102
Why is she on
the warpath? Dog...

62
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,189
I didn't look for work
yesterday, dude.

63
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:18,025
Sold some of her CDs,
bought a couple of 40s

64
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,825
and a pack of GPCs.

65
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,028
Caught a buzz and watched

66
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,031
my Chicago Vs. Lakers tapes.

67
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:25,248
That's on you, homie.

68
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,535
We didn't even hang yesterday.

69
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,037
I was out of the country.

70
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,039
So? My old lady still
thinks it's your fault.

71
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,290
Huh? Huh? Hmm?

72
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:34,292
Come on, dude, let's get
the fuck out of here

73
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:35,670
and find my ass
some employment.

74
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:36,928
It's cool you driving me around?

75
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,547
Yeah, dude, it's cool.
It's no trouble.

76
00:08:42,218 --> 00:08:43,469
<i>Here, asshole.</i>

77
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:44,685
Breakfast.

78
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,392
Oh... ho, ho... Dog.

79
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:50,359
<i>No pisto for me, dude.</i>

80
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:52,563
Today's a no-pounding day.
You heard the woman.

81
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:54,398
Good. More for me.

82
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,902
Fuck it.

83
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,739
<i>Salud. Salud.</i>

84
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:06,911
Man, hope they put me in
the next class or I'm fucked.

85
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,711
I can't pay my rent.

86
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:11,714
Landlady's about to pull
a gauge on my ass.

87
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:14,253
What happened to all that money
you saved in the army, dude?

88
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:17,172
The tax-free shit?

89
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,009
Man, bro, this fucking
ride cleaned me out.

90
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:21,760
I guess we drank up the rest.

91
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,429
Dumb ass.

92
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:26,600
Cops better start
paying you, dude.

93
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:28,101
You spend enough
fucking time with them.

94
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,520
They better start kicking me
down some paychecks, man.

95
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,689
They got me hopping through
hoops, you know?

96
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,025
"Come in for a test."
"Come back in two weeks."

97
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,860
Another test, another two weeks.

98
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:38,361
Fuck.

99
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,746
Shit gets real, you
be hating life.

100
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,783
Party time will be over.

101
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,536
Dude, you don't know how much

102
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:47,767
I'm looking forward
to this shit.

103
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:49,957
You know, I'll be super recruit.

104
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,835
I was jumping out of choppers

105
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:53,128
in the mountains, taking down

106
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,131
hard motherfuckers, you know?

107
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:58,884
I'll be laughing my way through
LAPD's reindeer games.

108
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,637
Shit, they're gonna love me.

109
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:03,972
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna
fucking love them, dude.

110
00:10:04,056 --> 00:10:06,059
Ah, fuck you.

111
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:08,478
I'm going to love my old lady.

112
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,313
I'm gonna marry homegirl.

113
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:13,066
Import her ass.

114
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:14,484
Oh, come on, man.

115
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,173
Dude, what happened
to all the honeys

116
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,780
we were gonna pimp
with your badge, dog?

117
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:19,531
You're fucking up the plan.

118
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:21,242
I've been thinking, you know?

119
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:23,907
Love's about sacrifice.

120
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:26,503
Only true measure of it.

121
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,082
What would you do for Sylvia?

122
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:31,718
Get a job.

123
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:33,672
- Mm...
- Nine to fucking five.

124
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:35,472
Yeah.

125
00:10:35,507 --> 00:10:37,008
That's love.

126
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:49,939
Hey.

127
00:10:54,443 --> 00:10:57,948
Good morning.

128
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,369
So when do you officially

129
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,121
hand your ass over to the Man?

130
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:08,042
"Mr. Jim Davis,
we regret to inform...

131
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,463
I had two beers, right?

132
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,881
Yeah.

133
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,570
Going fucking
blind or something.

134
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:17,218
Okay, this letter
says, quoting...

135
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,558
"no longer eligible
as a police officer candidate."

136
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:25,102
What the fuck does that mean?

137
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,111
Come on, dude.

138
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:29,815
"No longer eligible"? I mean,
what does that sound like?

139
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,066
They pulled the plug, dude.

140
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:36,698
No, no... Why?

141
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,076
Oh, man, I'll bet you...

142
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:42,162
I'll bet you it's
'cause I'm white.

143
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,296
I bet it's 'cause
you're a dick.

144
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,083
No, no, no, Mike,
you don't understand.

145
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:47,919
I am fucked.

146
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:49,921
I got to get married.

147
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:53,925
Okay? INS won't let me
bring Marta across

148
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,343
unless I got employment.

149
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:56,427
I promised her.

150
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,262
This fucks up my plan.

151
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:00,599
This is fucking bullshit, okay?

152
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:03,101
This... these fucking
assholes...

153
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:06,438
These fucking assholes!

154
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,106
What the fuck
is their problem, man?!

155
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,196
This is fucking typical
cop hate game bullshit!

156
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,114
Yo, yo, fucking
chill, Magilla Gorilla.

157
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:16,532
I mean you're trippin', dude.

158
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:17,617
Hey, what the fuck

159
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,868
are you looking at, asshole?!

160
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,621
Fucking dick.

161
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:24,708
Yo, yo, Jim, Jim...

162
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,127
I'm gonna fucking kick your
teeth down your puke hole!

163
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:29,630
You fucking want some?

164
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,899
Jim, Jim, dude.

165
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:34,134
Kick back, dude.

166
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:36,805
The fucking light is green.
Get the fuck in the car.

167
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,161
Man, fuck.
You're going to catch

168
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,366
a case doing that shit, man.

169
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,561
What the fuck were you doing?

170
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,359
Fuck the LAPD, man.

171
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,396
What's up with Pasadena,
Pomona, Santa Ana and all that?

172
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,314
Oh, no, fuck the sticks.

173
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,281
L.A. City's the shit.

174
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:49,986
Hey, Sheriff's Department.

175
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,655
It's good enough for the INS
and still basically L.A., right?

176
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,874
Yeah, Sheriff's Department,
yeah.

177
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,162
They make you work
the jails the first two years

178
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,247
or something.

179
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,916
I could be cracking heads

180
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,466
up at the Honor Ranch.

181
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:07,838
I'll give 'em a call,
start testing.

182
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:09,972
Yeah.

183
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:11,390
That's right.

184
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:14,345
Yo, it's just
a minor setback, right?

185
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,764
Quit trippin', dude.

186
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,933
Shit.

187
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:22,103
Hey, you know what
I want to do?

188
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:23,653
What?

189
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:26,691
I want to get fucked up.

190
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:28,325
Me, too, man.

191
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,196
I got to find a job and placate
my baby, you know.

192
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,032
Sylvia's going
to kick your ass?

193
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:34,700
Come on, big man,
she'll be cool.

194
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:37,453
Come on.

195
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:48,548
- Bye, Nicole.
- Bye.

196
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:56,057
Let me get a couple
of singles, too, please.

197
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:58,059
Sorry, you buy whole pack.

198
00:13:58,142 --> 00:13:59,942
Be cool, dude.

199
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,193
If I buy a whole pack

200
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:02,897
I'm gonna want to smoke it.

201
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,233
I just want a couple
of smokes with my beer.

202
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,985
City give me $1,500 ticket.

203
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,986
No more.

204
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:32,429
Asshole.

205
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:55,370
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

206
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:56,754
Oh, shit.

207
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:58,506
That fucking gangster, man.

208
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,335
Homeboy just ran
a six second four-forty.

209
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,709
Damn, the chino looked
fucking pissed, man.

210
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:06,048
You think we'll be able
to go back there?

211
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:07,883
I hate that shit.

212
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:10,804
Fuckin' chino lookin' at us
like we were gonna bust him?

213
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,806
Come on, dude.
We're wearin' suits, man.

214
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:14,106
We totally look like cops.

215
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:15,809
He said he got fined
for that shit.

216
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:17,025
He was just being cautious.

217
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,399
<i>Well, we got pisto,
we got frajos.</i>

218
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,484
Only one thing missin'.

219
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,285
Be-at-ches.

220
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,989
Oh, yeah, I mean
besides bitches, man.

221
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:30,325
<i>Yesca? Mm-hmm.</i>

222
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,958
Bingo.

223
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:34,295
I need to feel
some reefer madness.

224
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,131
You sure you want
to score some bud, dude?

225
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,335
You haven't smoked out
since like forever, man.

226
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,922
I said I want
to get fucked up, man.

227
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:44,673
Fuck this purity bullshit.

228
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:49,095
Yeah... fuck purity.

229
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:53,683
Aw, man, look at this
zero-head, dog.

230
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:54,976
Stupid-ass cholo.

231
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,186
Look at that.

232
00:15:58,188 --> 00:15:59,523
That dude's slangin', dog.

233
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,860
Want to get a dime?

234
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,113
No, I want it all.

235
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,206
Go for the stash, man.

236
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,799
Whoa, go, go, go.

237
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,218
Hey, hey, yo, yo.

238
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,387
That's my shit!

239
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,138
Fuck.

240
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,523
Outstanding.

241
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,351
Out-fucking-standing.

242
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:36,145
That shit was slick.

243
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,232
That motherfucker
just got schooled.

244
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:40,282
Bitch-ass cholo.

245
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:41,902
- Check this shit out, huh?
- Yeah.

246
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:44,238
Nice motherfucking haul.
You see that shit, huh?

247
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:47,074
Mm. It's not laced either.

248
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:48,075
Smell that shit.

249
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:49,243
Smell that motherfucking shit.

250
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,329
We just burned my car.

251
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,081
We go back there,
we're gonna get shot.

252
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:54,082
Yeah, no shit.

253
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:55,083
Man, bust that light.

254
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,043
Roll that shit up.

255
00:16:57,078 --> 00:16:58,885
Yeah, yeah, Cool.

256
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,672
Yo, let's drop off
some resumés first.

257
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:01,923
Then we'll smoke out, dude.

258
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,092
Some resumés.

259
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,260
Yeah.

260
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:06,429
Ah, man, fresh air.

261
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:07,597
Look.

262
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,515
Oh! They're dropped off, man.

263
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,731
You fucking asshole, man.

264
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,101
I got to get
a fucking job, man.

265
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:13,401
What's your problem, man?

266
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:14,770
What the fuck are
you doing, dickhead.

267
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:15,926
Yo, Mike, first day looking-

268
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:18,609
nobody ever gets a job
their first day looking.

269
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:22,279
Come on, don't sweat it, man.

270
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:25,449
Hey, I can't
fuck around tomorrow.

271
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:26,700
I got to get a job for sure.

272
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:27,917
This is your job, man.

273
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:29,335
So act like a fucking
professional,

274
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,539
spark up the goods, 'cause we
got a lot of work to do.

275
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,886
It's harsh. It's good, though.

276
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,530
You okay?

277
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,567
How are those lungs, baby?

278
00:17:57,651 --> 00:17:59,284
There it is.

279
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,988
That magic feeling.

280
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:24,930
Damn, look at that bitch.

281
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:26,682
Oh, damn.

282
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:32,939
Fuck, yeah.

283
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:34,524
She's fucking good.

284
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:37,193
I bet she got skills.
I want to get laid.

285
00:18:37,277 --> 00:18:40,363
You just saw your woman.

286
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:41,829
Only hit her once, man.

287
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:45,286
We can't go nowhere alone.
They got me sleeping in the car.

288
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:50,040
Family's got that ass
under guard, huh?

289
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:51,208
Lock and key.

290
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,044
Fuck, I want to get laid.

291
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:57,215
Pay a visit to my harem, huh?

292
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,383
Online, pornmeister.

293
00:18:58,425 --> 00:19:00,010
Uh-uh, let's go
to Letty's pad, man.

294
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,851
How much you want to bet
I hit it.

295
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:03,722
- She won't, dog.
- How much you want to bet?

296
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:05,098
She won't give you shit, dog.

297
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:06,725
You big time fucked her over.

298
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:09,520
Aw, man, I popped that poodahey.

299
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:12,773
I got that mind control, man.

300
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:16,402
How much you want to bet
I get back up in it?

301
00:19:16,444 --> 00:19:17,903
20 bucks?

302
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:19,613
You ain't got 20 bucks.

303
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:21,361
So, neither do you, man.

304
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:23,076
Come on, shake on that shit.

305
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:25,495
Come on.

306
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:27,831
What the fuck, let's go.

307
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:30,500
I got it.

308
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:33,128
What's up, Patty?

309
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,090
<i>- Y tu hermana?
- She ain't here.</i>

310
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,640
<i>Y sabes que?</i>

311
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,761
You're not welcome
in this house.

312
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:42,930
Sure, Patty.

313
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,099
I'd love to come in.

314
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,270
Thank you.

315
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:50,105
Are they here?

316
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:58,405
<i>You're looking fine,
as fuck, chulas.</i>

317
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,617
Don't... don't touch
me, please.

318
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:03,286
Hey, hey.

319
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,957
You got to get out of here.

320
00:20:06,992 --> 00:20:12,128
Letty... I just wanted
to see you again.

321
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,135
<i>Hey, Patty, you want to grab
me a pisto or something?</i>

322
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,144
I ain't grabbing you shit.

323
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:21,555
Oh, you still got a mouth, huh?

324
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,641
Maybe one day you'll learn
how to keep it shut.

325
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:26,860
Laters. I'm going to my room.

326
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:30,190
You know you have to run
his ass out of here.

327
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:34,820
Baby.

328
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:40,159
Let's sit down.

329
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:50,253
No, no, no.

330
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:56,135
So, um... You a cop yet?

331
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,845
I'm working on it.

332
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:00,180
<i>Y tu?</i>

333
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:03,149
<i>Que andas haciendo?</i>

334
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:05,603
Well, you know, I'm going
to L.A. Trade Tech.

335
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:08,273
It's good you're doing
positive shit.

336
00:21:20,703 --> 00:21:22,587
What, after everything
I don't get a kiss?

337
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:26,375
It's because of everything
you can't get a kiss.

338
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,545
Oh, come on, come here.

339
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,798
Yeah.

340
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:37,638
Don't.

341
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,390
Jim, I got a boyfriend.

342
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,226
Who?

343
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,527
Flaco.

344
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:45,528
You're back with that

345
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:47,899
piece of shit after
what he did, Letty?

346
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,402
You're not fucking him, are you?

347
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:54,006
Please tell me no.

348
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,540
Yes. So... just go.

349
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,410
'Cause there's nothing
here for you, Jim.

350
00:21:59,995 --> 00:22:01,621
See?

351
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:03,248
Okay?

352
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,084
I don't believe
this shit, Letty.

353
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,920
You're too good for that.

354
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,261
You gotta go.

355
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:17,097
Go. Please!

356
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,264
Let me talk to them.

357
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:20,267
No, Jim, don't
be stupid. Please.

358
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:24,605
<i>Okay? Largate. Just go.</i>

359
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:31,696
I guess it's later days.

360
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:44,126
<i>Largate. Just go!</i>

361
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:46,671
<i>Flaco, the pinchi guero's here!</i>

362
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:48,881
<i>Apuarte, Jim! Hurry up!</i>

363
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,050
- Fuck him up!
- I got him!

364
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,991
Fucking white boy!

365
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,794
What's up, faggot?!

366
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,665
We're going to fuck you up!

367
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:26,470
Yo! Pop the trunk

368
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,757
so I can handle this shit!

369
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:29,484
<i>Fuck you, puto!</i>

370
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,349
I'll bust you!

371
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:33,179
Leave him alone!

372
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:37,184
Pop the fucking trunk!

373
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:56,037
Jim!

374
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,672
Oh, you fucked up!

375
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:01,877
Get your fucking knees
down on the curb now!

376
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:03,545
Get the fuck over there, man!

377
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:05,547
Don't fucking move unless you
want your brains hanging out!

378
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:06,715
What's your problem, Flaco?

379
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,683
Motherfucker!

380
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:11,720
Fucking knees on the curb, man!

381
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:15,141
That's right!

382
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:19,229
Interlock your fingers
behind your heads, Flaco!

383
00:24:19,312 --> 00:24:21,815
You deaf fuck!

384
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:26,654
Yo, Mike.

385
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:27,954
Yeah?

386
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:30,157
Do up their ride.

387
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:32,326
Freeze, bitch!

388
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,329
I'm going to take that big ass
of yours home,

389
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:37,581
hit it for a minute, you know?

390
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:38,882
Fuck off!

391
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:39,918
Now you got it.

392
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:44,923
Yo, relax, homie.

393
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:50,262
You break Letty's heart,
I'm coming for your mom.

394
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:51,431
Fuck!

395
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:56,102
<i>Hey, haina.</i>

396
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:57,235
Whoo!

397
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,021
Fuck off! Oh, yeah?

398
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,773
What you got down here?

399
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:03,944
Oh... Liking that.

400
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:11,035
Damn! Those are
badass kicks, dog.

401
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:13,919
Lucky you got little bitch feet,

402
00:25:13,954 --> 00:25:16,373
else I'd be stomping around
in them motherfuckers.

403
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:18,185
<i>- Fuck you, puto.
- Huh?</i>

404
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,961
- Yeah. Fuck you.
- Yes?

405
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:24,764
You fucking stay still!

406
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,260
Bitches! If you didn't have
that fucking gun,

407
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:29,722
<i>ese, it wouldn't
be about shit, homie.</i>

408
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:31,950
Not fucking shit!

409
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:34,108
Hey, later, Patty!

410
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:35,978
I hope you're not
pregnant, but you know

411
00:25:36,062 --> 00:25:37,146
you wanted me to blow in you.

412
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,581
Fuck you!

413
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:39,982
Bye, Letty!

414
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:50,410
<i>Salud.</i>

415
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,751
Divvy up the bounty, dude.
I know you got some cash.

416
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:09,515
I know I got more than that.

417
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,602
Yeah. Here we go.

418
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:14,937
Shit.

419
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,189
That's my pussy
she's giving away there.

420
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:20,902
Homeboy uses extra large.

421
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:22,696
Man, that's it? Next time,

422
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:24,329
jack someone with a job.

423
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:28,034
Well, fuck you.
What did you get, their lunch?

424
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:29,786
Check it out.

425
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:32,873
Holy shit. You're kidding me.

426
00:26:37,878 --> 00:26:42,216
Whoo! It's a fucking
Ruger P-94. Nine millimeter.

427
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:45,101
14, plus one in the chamber.

428
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,888
It's a good fucking gun.
Durable.

429
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,724
It's brand-new.

430
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:52,477
It's a BB gun.

431
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,229
Yeah. Cool.

432
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,862
Here you go, dog.

433
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:57,232
<i>About time you got a cohete.</i>

434
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,735
No. I don't want it.

435
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,945
Why the fuck not? I'll use it.

436
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,072
That's a good reason. Sell it.

437
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:05,158
How much you think
we can get for the gun?

438
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:07,660
Two bills, maybe three.
Costs six new.

439
00:27:07,695 --> 00:27:10,079
We'll sell it
and split the greenery.

440
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:11,046
You sure?

441
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:12,750
It's cool, dude.

442
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,335
50-50.

443
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:18,005
Good BB gun though.

444
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:20,591
Shoot some birds and shit.

445
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:22,426
Hey, put that shit away.

446
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:23,928
Looks real as hell.

447
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,264
Not a bad day's work.

448
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:40,780
Get down to business though.

449
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:42,823
I know you didn't get any.

450
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:44,784
So pay up, motherfucker.

451
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:50,791
Dick.

452
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:58,256
Hello. This is a message
for Michael Alonzo.

453
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:02,470
This is Bob Luell
at the Palm Glen Group.

454
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:04,520
We have reviewed your resumé,

455
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:07,308
and would like
to make an appointment

456
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:08,726
for later in the week.

457
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,894
Please call me at your

458
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:11,729
earliest convenience.

459
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:12,730
Thank you.

460
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:15,032
Huh? That's good.

461
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:16,652
One more? This is fun.

462
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:18,821
Sounded a little gay,
but it was good.

463
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,991
No, no, no. No.
That's it, dude. That's it.

464
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:24,124
I get too many callbacks,

465
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,439
Sylvia's going
to get suspicious.

466
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:27,080
Oh, Sylvia's going
to be kissing your ass.

467
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:28,498
Not if she
recognizes your voice.

468
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,500
Oh, she won't. Here, sir.

469
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,168
No, no, no, no, no. I'm cool.

470
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:33,635
- Come on.
- I'm cool.

471
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,172
I want to get home before the
little woman and sober up.

472
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:38,174
Come on, bro. One brew.

473
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,511
All right, but hey,

474
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,430
I got to look for a job
tomorrow for sure.

475
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:43,615
Okay? I can't
be getting fucked up

476
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,765
behind Sylvia's back
when I'm supposed

477
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:45,930
to be looking for work, man.

478
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,601
Not cool. Tomorrow, for sure.

479
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:49,687
I got to find a job, too.

480
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,445
Hello.

481
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,283
Yes, sir.

482
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:05,371
Yes, sir. That is correct.

483
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:06,838
Six years.

484
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:09,125
Honorably discharged.

485
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,842
Yes, sir.

486
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:12,677
I would love to.

487
00:29:12,712 --> 00:29:15,798
Believe me, I would
welcome the opportunity.

488
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:21,805
Tomorrow is not a problem.

489
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:24,141
Thank you, sir.
You have a good day, too.

490
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:26,859
Good-bye, sir.

491
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:29,146
That was the man, huh?
You're all "Sir,

492
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:30,565
sir, sir."

493
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:34,736
Yes! Fucking yes! Thank God!

494
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:41,076
That was the man!
That was the Federal man!

495
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:43,628
The Federal man!

496
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:44,914
Department of Homeland Security

497
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:46,832
wants me to come in
tomorrow to start testing!

498
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,752
Oh, shit!

499
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:51,052
Fucking A, my brother!

500
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:52,421
That shit is righteous,
motherfucker!

501
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:53,638
It's on, homie!

502
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:55,342
Wow, man. Tomorrow.

503
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:57,105
So what the fuck you
going to do now, dude?

504
00:29:57,177 --> 00:29:58,679
I got to take a piss test.

505
00:29:58,762 --> 00:30:00,097
If I'm cool, I'm in the house.

506
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:06,603
Yeah! Oh!

507
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:10,108
Shit, dude,
do they piss test for weed?

508
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,777
Oh, shit!

509
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,031
You fucked up, man.

510
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,950
Oh, fuck.

511
00:30:20,703 --> 00:30:22,336
I fucked up.

512
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:24,957
Oh, fuck. I fucked up.

513
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,376
Fuck! Oh...

514
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,462
You know, one dope
molecule, and I'm done.

515
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,930
And they will burn me

516
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,552
with every law enforcement
outfit in the country.

517
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:36,768
Shit!

518
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:38,103
Wait, wait, wait, wait, dude.

519
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:41,558
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

520
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:43,476
Hey, there's a way out
of every fucking situation.

521
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:45,980
- Right? Relax, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

522
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:48,482
Yeah. I'm going to do
what I got to do, you know?

523
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:49,626
It's cool. Fuck, yeah.

524
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,735
I'll pass that shit.

525
00:30:50,818 --> 00:30:52,153
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

526
00:30:52,236 --> 00:30:54,572
Of course you will, dude!

527
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:57,491
Later, loco.

528
00:30:57,575 --> 00:30:58,827
Don't fucking trip, dude.

529
00:30:58,862 --> 00:30:59,710
All right.

530
00:30:59,745 --> 00:31:01,747
Shit.

531
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:09,004
Eat.

532
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:12,091
Come in, dumb ass!

533
00:31:16,763 --> 00:31:18,014
What's up, dog?

534
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:21,851
What up, dog... Hey, Jim.
Want some coffee?

535
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:22,935
Sure.

536
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,772
Want some eggs? There's extra.

537
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:26,989
Yes, ma'am. Please.

538
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:30,027
I, uh, heard about the LAPD.

539
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,910
Sorry about that.

540
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:33,864
I thought they
guaranteed you a job.

541
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:35,414
Yea. Me, too.

542
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:39,120
Well, maybe it
wasn't meant to be.

543
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:41,873
You know, you being a cop.

544
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:45,543
Tell her what's up, dude.

545
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:46,843
Well, I applied

546
00:31:46,878 --> 00:31:49,965
to all the Federal
law enforcement agencies.

547
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,300
You know, ATF, Border Patrol,

548
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:52,784
ICE, Homeland Security,
all of them.

549
00:31:52,802 --> 00:31:55,554
And Homeland Security's
interested in me.

550
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:58,140
They want me to come in today
and start testing.

551
00:31:58,224 --> 00:32:00,643
Wow. That's great.
How sure is this?

552
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:02,396
Well, I got a urinalysis today.

553
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:04,648
If I pass that, I'll be
a Special Agent candidate,

554
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:06,650
and then I could
be out of here next month.

555
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:09,527
You haven't been
smoking out, have you?

556
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:12,287
Nah. Chilled on that shit
a while back.

557
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:14,575
Good. Well, thanks for driving
Mike around yesterday.

558
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,494
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, bro.

559
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:18,496
Three callbacks.

560
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:21,130
Damn! Good!

561
00:32:21,165 --> 00:32:23,918
We dropped off
enough resumés. Whoo!

562
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:25,385
Got more.

563
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,421
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

564
00:32:26,504 --> 00:32:28,007
Well, you have to keep trying

565
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,556
until something happens.

566
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:31,093
<i>Finding a job is a job, right?</i>

567
00:32:31,176 --> 00:32:32,428
Lunch money.

568
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:33,679
Thank you.

569
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:35,014
And good luck today.

570
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:36,932
Thank you.

571
00:32:37,016 --> 00:32:38,434
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

572
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:40,235
Good luck.

573
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,689
And, Jim, good luck
on your pee test.

574
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:43,940
I hope you studied.

575
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:49,362
I'm going to cram for it.

576
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:51,781
Man, that's freaky.

577
00:32:51,865 --> 00:32:53,868
She was in a good mood.

578
00:32:53,951 --> 00:32:55,369
Breakfast and beer money?

579
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:56,370
Yeah, dude.

580
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:58,789
She heard the
messages last night.

581
00:32:58,824 --> 00:32:59,922
She got me a sixer.

582
00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:01,625
I slammed two last night.

583
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:03,294
Out-fuckin'-standing!

584
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:04,962
Now we know beer is just
a phone call away.

585
00:33:05,046 --> 00:33:06,179
Yeah.

586
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:08,932
Yeah. We talked shit out
last night, though.

587
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:12,220
You know? Hey, all she wants
is for me to get a job.

588
00:33:12,304 --> 00:33:15,140
I shouldn't be playing her
like that.

589
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:18,526
<i>Dude, you had a good job,</i>

590
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:21,230
with that, uh, with
that Web design shit.

591
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,780
<i>Had, dude. Had.</i>

592
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:25,068
All right? All that
shit's in India now.

593
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,736
Want a cold one? No, later.

594
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:27,987
You got any vinegar?

595
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:30,490
Vinegar? What for?

596
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:40,584
Ah... Oh... Damn, dude!

597
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:41,752
Ah...!

598
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:44,506
- Man!
- That is fuckin' sick, man.

599
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,473
What'd you do that for?

600
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,009
- Shuts down the old kidneys.
- Ooh.

601
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:50,011
Come on, let's roll.

602
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,522
Grab me that bag, dude.

603
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,699
Little trick I learned
in the service.

604
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:14,002
Aw, that's sick, dude.

605
00:34:14,037 --> 00:34:16,707
You're gonna stick
a turkey baster in your dick?

606
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,376
Quit looking, faggot.

607
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:22,213
You wish.

608
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:30,603
Oh, man.

609
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,558
Fuckin'... shit, dude.

610
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:36,311
Oh, fuckin' shit... Aw...

611
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,398
Aw, motherfucker!

612
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:44,277
Whew!

613
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:45,904
Ah...

614
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:54,998
That was... unpleasant.

615
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:01,756
Man...

616
00:35:03,507 --> 00:35:05,843
Man, I want to get
this shit over with.

617
00:35:05,926 --> 00:35:08,179
You know, my teeth are floating.

618
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:14,436
Oh... You get those
in the military, dog?

619
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:16,653
I was a Ranger.

620
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:18,857
Your mom still suck
a mean dick, hmm?

621
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,567
Gotcha! Shouldn't ignore people.

622
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:22,194
Why don't you go fuck yourself!

623
00:35:22,277 --> 00:35:23,327
Hey!

624
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:26,366
Let's play nice, boys.

625
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:29,452
I have everyone's "Consent to
Urinalysis" form signed

626
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:30,536
and dated, am I right?

627
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,537
Yes, sir.

628
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:33,539
Good. I'm Agent Richards.

629
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:35,208
Jackets off.

630
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,336
I will now administer
the easiest test

631
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:39,380
Homeland Security
will ever give you,

632
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:40,763
the whizz quiz.

633
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:43,217
Roll up both sleeves
past the elbow.

634
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:49,473
Remove all gloves, rings,
watches, bracelets,

635
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:53,812
jewelry, Band-Aids
and bandages.

636
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:57,399
I want to see nothing
but bare hands and forearms.

637
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:59,984
Wiggle your fingers.

638
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:02,738
Let me see both sides.

639
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,573
Beautifully done.

640
00:36:04,615 --> 00:36:06,701
Again, gentlemen, no talking.

641
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:08,324
Detweiler, is it?

642
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:09,912
You're with me.

643
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,678
Fucker.

644
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,853
Next!

645
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,906
Name?

646
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:38,859
Davis, Jim.

647
00:36:38,894 --> 00:36:40,779
Ah, the Ranger.

648
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:42,197
Yes, sir.

649
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:45,165
- You serve?
- 101st.

650
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,410
- High speed.
- All right.

651
00:36:47,445 --> 00:36:49,586
Think you can fill that, son?

652
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:52,332
I could fill
a goddamn trash can, sir.

653
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:55,378
You're full of piss
and vinegar, aren't you, Jim?

654
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,547
Yes, sir.

655
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:03,803
Hey, unload that shit before
you clown with it, okay?

656
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,555
I don't want my head blown off

657
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:06,932
just when I'm getting
it straight.

658
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,145
Pop! What's it like

659
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:12,646
to just straight-up
whack a motherfucker?

660
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,775
What's it like?
I mean, what the fuck, you know?

661
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,319
It's like nothing.
What's it supposed to be like?

662
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,696
You tell me.

663
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,032
You were busting heads
for the military.

664
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,576
I can't talk about
this shit, Mike.

665
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,166
But I will tell you one
thing-you point and shoot,

666
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,003
pop, pop, move on, fuck 'em,
they shouldn't have been there,

667
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:35,553
you move the fuck on.

668
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:39,557
<i>You do not stop
and think about it.</i>

669
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,844
- It's not a big deal.
- So if it's nothing,

670
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:43,262
then what you getting
all mad for?

671
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:44,438
I'm not getting mad.

672
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:46,287
I just hate stupid
questions, Mike.

673
00:37:46,322 --> 00:37:48,067
You think you killed
a lot of Commies?

674
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:50,187
- They weren't Commies, dumb ass.
- Then what were they?

675
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,606
You know what they were-
they were fuckin' Hajjis,

676
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:55,150
terrorists, the bad guys.

677
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:58,196
Did you like it? Oh, shit.

678
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:00,198
Did you dig it?

679
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:02,617
You bust a nut?

680
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,454
Not fuckin' now, man.
Seriously.

681
00:38:07,664 --> 00:38:10,146
You're killing my buzz, dude.

682
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:12,593
Aw, kick back, stress case.

683
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:14,964
Are we on a mission to
sell this piece or what?

684
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:16,132
Hell, yeah.

685
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:17,550
Let's sell this fuckin' piece.

686
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:20,177
Got to get some scratch,
you know what I'm saying?

687
00:38:20,212 --> 00:38:20,970
Pop! Pop! Pop!

688
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:34,067
? Don't lay your funky trip
on me...?

689
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:35,785
Yo, Darrel!

690
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,489
- Yo, yo, yo, Darrel!
- Wake the fuck up, Darrel!

691
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:41,325
Darrel!

692
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:43,619
Come on, come on, come on,
wake up and fuckin'

693
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:45,246

694
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:53,297
Y'all need to knock
this shit off right now.

695
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,759
Hey, what's up, bro?

696
00:38:58,594 --> 00:39:00,055
Come on in, motherfuckers.

697
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,479
Yeah.

698
00:39:01,514 --> 00:39:03,349
Get your little ass up in here.

699
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,441
Shit!

700
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:05,810

701
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:07,652
Oh, man...

the fuck out of me, man.

703
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:13,611
You motherfuckers got ties on.

704
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:15,529
I saw that city-lookin'
car pull up-

705
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:17,698
I thought y'all was
some rollers or shit.

706
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:21,160
I just got out of County.

707
00:39:21,202 --> 00:39:24,538
- $9,600.
- No shit. When?

708
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,340
Yesterday.

709
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,043
Damn. What'd they put on you?

710
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:29,002
Some bullshit.

711
00:39:29,044 --> 00:39:31,213
I saw some wrong-ass shit

712
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:32,464
up in there, dude.

713
00:39:32,547 --> 00:39:34,633
I ain't ever going back
to that motherfucker.

714
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:36,183
It scared you straight, huh?

715
00:39:36,218 --> 00:39:38,888
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, you get booty-played?

716
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:42,225
<i>Hell, no.</i>

717
00:39:42,308 --> 00:39:44,310
You over there tickling
your brown eye, dog?

718
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:46,813
They-they put some jelly
on there, serve some syrup?

719
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,815
- You toss the salad?
- Hey, you know, nigga,

720
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:52,653
I kept my ass to the wall
and my mouth shut.

721
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:53,869
Shoot.

722
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:56,115
I almost lost my job
over that shit.

723
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,741
Fuckin' around in there.

724
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:04,999
Oh, God... - You a cop? - Nope.

725
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,793
Rejected his ass.

726
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:07,919
Fuck you.

727
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:09,504

728
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:12,639
Damn...!

729
00:40:12,674 --> 00:40:15,009
That's what I'm talking about!

730
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,929
Ah, you hear that?

731
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:19,515
<i>This motherfucker

You know, I'll be flipping shit,

You know?

<i>We jacked some eses.

This is a nice little machine.

00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:05,404
Three bills, it's yours.

751
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:07,400
I ain't got three bills, dog.

752
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:10,487

We need ends, dog.

Who'll give us
three bills for it?

760
00:41:30,508 --> 00:41:32,267
Hey, uh, I know a cat.

Yeah. Yeah, I'll hook you up.
Don't worry about it.

770
00:41:49,564 --> 00:41:51,465
Cool, cool.

00:43:53,593 --> 00:43:55,581
That shit'll keep
the porch clean.

821
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:58,584
Motherfuckers like y'all
won't be banging on my shit.

822
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,180
Hey, Jim.

823
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,162
We should lose
the monkey suits, dude.

824
00:44:38,377 --> 00:44:40,880
<i>Quien es?</i>

825
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:54,854
<i>Hey, bring us,
dos pistos, por favor,</i>

826
00:44:54,896 --> 00:44:56,814
<i>mi reina.</i>

827
00:44:58,232 --> 00:44:59,317
Damn.

828
00:45:01,903 --> 00:45:04,781
Hey, dog, I don't
think they like us here.

829
00:45:04,822 --> 00:45:05,823
Fuck 'em.

830
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:07,331
I got my shit.

831
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:09,828
They make a move, I'm blasting.

832
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,832
Which one of these fools
is Eddy?

833
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:17,384
Yeah. I don't know.

834
00:45:17,419 --> 00:45:20,507
<i>They're all paisas here.</i>

835
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:26,763
Hey, why don't you ask
that homegirl right there?

836
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:41,278
<i>Sientate, guapa.</i>

837
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:42,279
Mm.

838
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:43,364
<i>Habla Espanol?</i>

839
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:44,372
<i>Si.</i>

840
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:45,534
<i>Que bien.</i>

841
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,120
<i>Sabas donde esta el Eddy?</i>

842
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,622
<i>Eddy, te hablan.</i>

843
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,430
<i>Que paso?</i>

844
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,349
Do I know you?

845
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,803
My homeboy Darrell said
to talk to you.

846
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:06,889
Darrell? Yeah.

847
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,559
I'm Jim, homie.

848
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:14,231
What's up, man? Mike, dog.

849
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,650
All right. So what's up?

850
00:46:16,685 --> 00:46:18,485
<i>Need a cohete?</i>

851
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:21,822
Maybe.

852
00:46:26,494 --> 00:46:27,495
What kind?

853
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:29,581
Ruger P-94, brand-new.

854
00:46:29,664 --> 00:46:30,915
Ruger, huh? Yeah.

855
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,167
How many mags?

856
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,169
One high cap.
I'll throw in the hollow points.

857
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:37,638
Strictly Black Talons, homes.

858
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:39,925
Homies be wearing
vests these days,

859
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,260
know what I'm saying?

860
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:42,261
Is it new?

861
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:44,180
Yeah, it's brand-new.

862
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:45,723
Where's it at?

863
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:47,183
I can get it.

864
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:51,271
How much?

865
00:46:51,354 --> 00:46:53,655
Three bills.

866
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,192
I'll give you $250 if it's new.

867
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:56,526
If not, I'll give you $200.

868
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:03,951
Cool.

869
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:07,455
<i>You got the feria, homie?</i>

870
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:09,123
I can get it.

871
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:10,708
<i>Orale.</i>

872
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:12,794
<i>Let's kick back,
have a couple pistos</i>

873
00:47:12,877 --> 00:47:14,963
before we handle business, eh?

874
00:47:18,217 --> 00:47:19,218
<i>Hey, guero, you like her?</i>

875
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:22,102
I do need to get laid.

876
00:47:22,137 --> 00:47:23,972
There it is right
there, brother.

877
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,224
<i>Yo, give me that cohete.</i>

878
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:43,077
<i>Mataste a un flor.</i>

879
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,550
Oh, shit!

880
00:47:51,585 --> 00:47:53,171
Open the fucking door!

881
00:48:03,098 --> 00:48:04,099
<i>Holy shit, dude!</i>

882
00:48:06,018 --> 00:48:07,270
You think he's gonna
fuckin' die?!

883
00:48:07,305 --> 00:48:09,164
Sure. Got his carotid.

884
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:11,023
Fucker was garden-hosing.

885
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,167
He'll bleed out.

886
00:48:12,202 --> 00:48:13,241
Oh, shit, dude,

887
00:48:13,276 --> 00:48:15,278
I've seen dudes get shot, man,
but I never seen

888
00:48:15,361 --> 00:48:16,779
no motherfucking shit
like that before, man!

889
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:19,199
Fucked his shit up, you know?

890
00:48:19,283 --> 00:48:21,452
Quick as shit, too.
That crack-crack!

891
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:24,121
<i>Turned that vato into
a fountain of blood.</i>

892
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:25,754
Why the fuck
did he do that, man?

893
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:27,791
That shit could have been
over anything, you know?

894
00:48:27,826 --> 00:48:29,427
Money, drugs, bitches,
respect, whatever.

895
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,795
That homie, straight-up pimp.

896
00:48:30,879 --> 00:48:32,797
You know, maybe he turned out
that dude's daughter.

897
00:48:32,832 --> 00:48:33,882
Looney tunes and shit,

898
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:35,383
glass all stuck
in his fuckin' neck.

899
00:48:35,467 --> 00:48:37,308
Did you see all that fuckin'
blood over there?!

900
00:48:37,337 --> 00:48:39,637
Yeah, man, the human body's
got a gallon.

901
00:48:39,672 --> 00:48:42,724
Damn!

902
00:48:42,808 --> 00:48:45,693
I coulda boned Gracie.

903
00:48:45,728 --> 00:48:48,481
She had that proper thickness.

904
00:48:48,516 --> 00:48:49,482
Look at me, dog.

905
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:51,484
Look at me.

906
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:54,285
I'm fuckin' traumatized
and shit.

907
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,075
Yo, homie, that shit
don't fuckin' faze you at all?

908
00:48:58,158 --> 00:49:00,494
Oh, man, I seen way worse.

909
00:49:00,577 --> 00:49:03,045
Trashcanistan.

910
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,583
My battle buddy, he got his legs
and arms blown off

911
00:49:06,618 --> 00:49:09,437
by a booby-trapped motorcycle.

912
00:49:09,472 --> 00:49:12,256
Medic saved his ass
and he lived.

913
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,177
He didn't want to, but he did.

914
00:49:16,212 --> 00:49:17,560
I got to face my woman.

915
00:49:17,595 --> 00:49:19,931
How in the fuck am I supposed
to play this shit off, huh?

916
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:22,017
Man, you'll do it, player.

917
00:49:30,526 --> 00:49:32,110
Hey, baby girl, you cooking?

918
00:49:32,145 --> 00:49:33,696
Yeah. Where have you been?

919
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:35,132
Oh, Jim's pad.

920
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:36,498
You been drinking?

921
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:38,201
Oh, you know,
I had a few brews.

922
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:39,619
A few? Yeah.

923
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:40,870
You look wasted.

924
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,256
Don't trip, girl.

925
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:46,509
I've been working all day.

926
00:49:46,544 --> 00:49:50,846
I've been looking
for work all day.

927
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:53,884
I wish I could hang out and
get wasted like the old days.

928
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,684
You know what?

929
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:58,055
When I'm working,
you can lounge.

930
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,940
I'll fix this place up,

931
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:01,393
get you nice clothes
and stuff...

932
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:02,644
Mike, Mike, Mike.

933
00:50:02,727 --> 00:50:05,230
It doesn't have anything
to do with money.

934
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:06,613
Come here.

935
00:50:06,648 --> 00:50:10,068
Sit down. I want
to talk to you.

936
00:50:10,103 --> 00:50:11,619
Hey, it's not about stuff.

937
00:50:11,654 --> 00:50:14,657
It's about you and me
needing an equal partner.

938
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:16,124
Right.

939
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:18,327
Hey, I know that you
supported me through college

940
00:50:18,362 --> 00:50:19,794
and I'm gonna always

941
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:20,997
- owe you for that.
- Right.

942
00:50:21,032 --> 00:50:22,248
Now everything's flipped

943
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:25,168
and I feel like I'm doing
everything alone.

944
00:50:25,203 --> 00:50:28,005
You know, sometimes
I feel like you're my kid.

945
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,007
I mean, you sneak
around like one.

946
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,223
Oh-ho!

947
00:50:31,258 --> 00:50:34,344
Look... Wow, dude.

948
00:50:34,428 --> 00:50:36,645
I'm sorry.

949
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,682
Be cool, baby girl,

950
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:39,149
I'm on a mission
to get my shit together.

951
00:50:39,184 --> 00:50:41,770
I applied at this commercial
realty company in Studio City,

952
00:50:41,853 --> 00:50:44,105
and this black guy,
he was the office manager

953
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,321
and he's fuckin' hella cool,

954
00:50:45,356 --> 00:50:47,400
you know? We're talkin'
and all that shit.

955
00:50:47,435 --> 00:50:49,444
You know? We're just kickin' it
and all that.

956
00:50:49,528 --> 00:50:51,947
Did you, did you
check the messages?

957
00:50:53,783 --> 00:50:56,285
Four messages.

958
00:50:56,368 --> 00:50:57,953
Mr. Alonzo, I'm calling

959
00:50:58,037 --> 00:51:00,623
from Sunhouse Properties
to schedule an interview.

960
00:51:00,706 --> 00:51:03,418
Honey, this is great!

961
00:51:03,453 --> 00:51:06,094
Mm, mm... Oh! Oh...

962
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:08,131
You better call him
first thing in the morning.

963
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,681
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

964
00:51:09,716 --> 00:51:13,101
Oh, damn, dog,
that shit was good, dude.

965
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,640
Damn, they should give you
a fuckin' Oscar for that shit.

966
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,285
You just stood there

967
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,324
and you fed me a line of
bullshit like it was nothing.

968
00:51:32,408 --> 00:51:36,161
You should be the lawyer.

969
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:38,747
How could you just do that?

970
00:51:38,831 --> 00:51:42,502
How could you look me in the eye
and lie to me like that?

971
00:51:42,537 --> 00:51:43,551
I'm sorry.

972
00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:46,172
I'd rather you hit me.

973
00:51:47,674 --> 00:51:49,509
I'm your clown.

974
00:51:49,592 --> 00:51:51,094
I'm your fucking clown.

975
00:51:51,177 --> 00:51:54,682
And you and Jim
are laughing at me?

976
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:56,684
No, it's not...

977
00:51:56,767 --> 00:52:01,021
No, no, no, you are so utterly,
irrevocably busted!

978
00:52:04,692 --> 00:52:07,112
Why don't you just go play
with your little butt buddy?

979
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:09,079
Go cook up more lies.

980
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:11,116
You know, I bet
you're doing lines again.

981
00:52:11,151 --> 00:52:13,785
Dude, how could you say
that shit?

982
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:15,036
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again.

983
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,621
Yeah, right, right.

984
00:52:16,705 --> 00:52:18,291
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again!

985
00:52:18,374 --> 00:52:20,877
Right now your word
is less than shit.

986
00:52:20,912 --> 00:52:23,897
Maybe you should go.

987
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,848
Just fuckin' go.

988
00:52:26,883 --> 00:52:31,054
Just fuckin'... just go, right?

989
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:32,639
Fuck it. I'll fuckin' go!

990
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:33,772
Please, go. Go!

991
00:52:33,807 --> 00:52:35,726
Fuck it then! I'll fuckin' go!

992
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:37,394
Then go, Mike!

993
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:38,599
I'm serious! I'll fuckin' go

994
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:39,813
except I won't fuckin'
come back!

995
00:52:39,897 --> 00:52:41,064
You want me to fuckin' go?!

996
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:42,065
Fuckin' go, Mike!

997
00:52:42,149 --> 00:52:43,400
I'll fuckin' go then!

998
00:52:43,484 --> 00:52:44,402
I'll fuckin' go!

999
00:52:44,486 --> 00:52:47,405
Get the fuck outta here!

1000
00:52:54,245 --> 00:52:56,749
Hello?

1001
00:52:56,832 --> 00:53:00,468
Speaking.

1002
00:53:00,503 --> 00:53:04,722
Of course, sir. Absolutely.

1003
00:53:04,757 --> 00:53:07,843
Thank you very much,
Agent Richards.

1004
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:09,930
Thank you, sir.

1005
00:53:15,102 --> 00:53:16,103
Who was that?

1006
00:53:16,186 --> 00:53:17,521
That was the feds, my friend.

1007
00:53:17,604 --> 00:53:21,191
I've been informed that I passed
my urinalysis

1008
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:23,694
and they would like me
to go in this morning

1009
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:26,948
to start formal testing.

1010
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:28,449
Fuck yeah, dude.

1011
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:29,582
I'll be there all day,

1012
00:53:29,617 --> 00:53:32,703
so take my ride,
get your ass a job.

1013
00:53:32,787 --> 00:53:33,955
Let's go.

1014
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,089
Oh, shit!

1015
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:38,794
Come on. Get your
parasitic ass in gear.

1016
00:53:42,881 --> 00:53:46,802
I had some twisted-ass dreams
about that dude being killed.

1017
00:53:46,886 --> 00:53:48,805
I slept like a baby.

1018
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:51,390
I heard screaming.

1019
00:53:51,425 --> 00:53:54,077
What kind of tests?

1020
00:53:54,112 --> 00:53:56,694
Psychological tests.

1021
00:53:56,729 --> 00:53:59,984
Geez, you're
a freakin' psycho, dude.

1022
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:01,485
Don't answer that shit
honestly.

1023
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,953
Hell no.

1024
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:07,324
They use the Minnesota
Multiphasic Inventory.

1025
00:54:07,408 --> 00:54:11,495
It's like 600 questions,
cross-referenced

1026
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:13,331
to detect deception.

1027
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:15,083
They ask the same shit

1028
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:17,085
six different ways. It's lame.

1029
00:54:17,169 --> 00:54:18,969
You'll ace it.

1030
00:54:19,004 --> 00:54:22,591
Dude, I'm gonna pull it off.

1031
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:26,179
All I needed was a shot.

1032
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:28,014
Gotta play the system.

1033
00:54:28,049 --> 00:54:31,350
Like a piano.

1034
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,862
You done with that crap, son?

1035
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,162
Yes, sir.

1036
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,866
Let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.

1037
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:47,951
Bring that with you.

1038
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,955
I see dumb people.

1039
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,342
We reviewed your LAPD package.

1040
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,963
Since they ran your background,
physical and psych,

1041
00:54:58,998 --> 00:55:00,816
we're going with their paper.

1042
00:55:00,851 --> 00:55:02,634
- Navy sucks.
- Army swallows.

1043
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:04,553
Took a little work to
pry your jacket loose

1044
00:55:04,637 --> 00:55:06,020
from their people.

1045
00:55:06,055 --> 00:55:08,641
They don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.

1046
00:55:08,724 --> 00:55:10,226
Move it, dirt bag.

1047
00:55:11,727 --> 00:55:13,194
Why'd they drop me?

1048
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:15,732
Someone here make a call?

1049
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:17,150
Nope.

1050
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:18,485
They dropped you on psych, Jim.

1051
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:21,988
You blew their profiles.

1052
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,706
We're all a little goofy here.

1053
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:27,410
You'd rather be with us,
wouldn't you?

1054
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,455
Absolutely, sir.

1055
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,203
Good answer.

1056
00:55:31,238 --> 00:55:32,917
Have a seat.

1057
00:55:34,168 --> 00:55:36,170
Said you were bilingual
on your app.

1058
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:37,839
They want to test your Spanish.

1059
00:55:37,922 --> 00:55:40,258
We can get that going
if you got time.

1060
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:42,094
Yes. Sure.

1061
00:55:42,177 --> 00:55:43,679
Who's "they"?

1062
00:55:43,762 --> 00:55:45,264
Your fans upstairs.

1063
00:55:45,347 --> 00:55:47,182
Fans upstairs? Who?

1064
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:49,768
This is some shit
above my pay grade,

1065
00:55:49,852 --> 00:55:53,355
but some very important people
have an eye on you, Jim.

1066
00:55:57,694 --> 00:55:59,279
Westside Realty Management.

1067
00:55:59,362 --> 00:56:01,030
How may I direct your call?

1068
00:56:02,115 --> 00:56:03,283
Please hold.

1069
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:08,087
Okay, Mike... Alonzo?

1070
00:56:08,122 --> 00:56:09,540
Oh, shit. Joe?!

1071
00:56:09,623 --> 00:56:10,958
Damn...! What's up, dog?

1072
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:13,043
- Mikey, look at you.
- What are you doing here, dude?

1073
00:56:13,127 --> 00:56:14,712
Mikey, man, check you out.

1074
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,297
What the fuck you doing here?

1075
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,715
Fucking grew up. I work here.

1076
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:19,301
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

1077
00:56:19,384 --> 00:56:21,052
Dude, you got to come on up.

1078
00:56:21,136 --> 00:56:22,376
Yeah, I'll show you the office.

1079
00:56:22,387 --> 00:56:23,770
Fuck, you're gonna trip, man,

1080
00:56:23,805 --> 00:56:25,188
I can see the ocean
and everything.

1081
00:56:25,223 --> 00:56:27,642
Check you out, fucking
ocean view and all that.

1082
00:56:27,677 --> 00:56:29,609
You're wearing a suit now.

1083
00:56:29,644 --> 00:56:31,229
- Got your hair cut.
- Hey, watch out, baby.

1084
00:56:31,313 --> 00:56:32,398
Yeah. Tag no more, huh?

1085
00:56:32,482 --> 00:56:33,816
No, man.

1086
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,283
Dude, what's up with
your brother, Pedro?

1087
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:37,403
Oh, man, he's in Iraq.
He's in a forward unit.

1088
00:56:37,487 --> 00:56:39,322
Get the fuck out of here. Yeah.

1089
00:56:39,405 --> 00:56:41,574
Fuckin' Mexicans.

1090
00:56:43,576 --> 00:56:44,495
Bye, sweetie.

1091
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:50,250
Thank you, sir.
I need me some of this, man.

1092
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:51,668
I've been taking piss all day.

1093
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:52,603
Dude!

1094
00:56:52,638 --> 00:56:53,504
What?

1095
00:56:53,587 --> 00:56:54,505
You're not going to

1096
00:56:54,588 --> 00:56:55,672
- fucking believe this.
- What?

1097
00:56:55,756 --> 00:56:57,842
- I had an interview today.
- Yeah?

1098
00:56:57,926 --> 00:56:59,344
- Remember Crazy Joe?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1099
00:56:59,427 --> 00:57:01,262
Dude stomped that guy's
face in at Taco Land

1100
00:57:01,346 --> 00:57:03,264
for grabbing his chick's ass.

1101
00:57:03,348 --> 00:57:04,849
Homeboy got his shit
together, man.

1102
00:57:04,884 --> 00:57:05,899
Went to UCLA.

1103
00:57:05,934 --> 00:57:08,186
Works at this office
up in Century City.

1104
00:57:08,221 --> 00:57:09,998
I got the hookup, dog.

1105
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:11,739
- 12 an hour.
- Hoo-hoo!

1106
00:57:11,774 --> 00:57:13,442
- That's a lot of lettuce.
- That's right.

1107
00:57:13,526 --> 00:57:15,111
And in three months,
I get benefits.

1108
00:57:15,194 --> 00:57:16,160
Damn! Benefits?

1109
00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:17,947
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Shit!

1110
00:57:17,982 --> 00:57:19,115
Yeah!

1111
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:20,783
It's not for sure yet,
though, dude.

1112
00:57:20,866 --> 00:57:22,452
I still got to
meet the owner, right.

1113
00:57:22,536 --> 00:57:24,037
But he says I'm straight.

1114
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:25,539
It's all good, you know.

1115
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:29,007
You're in. Dude... I'm in.
Oh, shit.

1116
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:30,509
Yeah... What happened?

1117
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:32,184
They want my ass, man.
Going back tomorrow

1118
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:33,512
for a polygraph test.

1119
00:57:33,547 --> 00:57:35,800
If I pass that, they'll
send me to Georgia next week.

1120
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:37,885
Oh...! Damn! It's like that?!

1121
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,220
What's up, lawman?

1122
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:40,520
Whoo-hoo!

1123
00:57:40,555 --> 00:57:42,223
How you gonna pass
a lie detector test,

1124
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:44,492
- you lying motherfucker?
- Aw, easy, man.

1125
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,727
After every question,
you just fucking squeeze

1126
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:48,622
like you're taking
a dump, you know, man.

1127
00:57:48,657 --> 00:57:50,482
- It throws the machine off. Ooh!
- Oh, dog.

1128
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:52,286
You're gonna shit your
pants like that, bro.

1129
00:57:52,317 --> 00:57:53,402
Fuck, I think I just did.

1130
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:55,070
All right, Jim,

1131
00:57:55,154 --> 00:57:56,989
I'm going to ask you
some control questions

1132
00:57:57,024 --> 00:57:59,241
before we get
to the good stuff.

1133
00:57:59,324 --> 00:58:01,744
They can be answered
just "yes" or "no."

1134
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:04,998
Just relax and
respond naturally.

1135
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,167
Are you ready?

1136
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,168
Yes, sir.

1137
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,587
You can just answer
"yes" or "no."

1138
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:16,010
"Is your name
Jim Luther Davis?"

1139
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:17,726
Yes.

1140
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:20,347
"Do you live in Los Angeles?"

1141
00:58:20,431 --> 00:58:22,898
Yes.

1142
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:25,854
"Are you 26 years old?"

1143
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:26,938
Yes.

1144
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,108
"Are you married?"

1145
00:58:30,192 --> 00:58:31,943
No.

1146
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:37,199
"Are you wearing shoes?"

1147
00:58:37,282 --> 00:58:40,668
Yes.

1148
00:58:40,703 --> 00:58:43,790
"Have you ever smoked
marijuana?"

1149
00:58:43,825 --> 00:58:44,325
Yes.

1150
00:58:48,127 --> 00:58:51,131
"Aside from the occasion you
mentioned in your application?"

1151
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,966
No.

1152
00:58:56,303 --> 00:58:58,972
Jim, knock it off.

1153
00:59:00,891 --> 00:59:02,142
What, sir?

1154
00:59:02,226 --> 00:59:04,229
Son, I've been doing
polygraph examinations

1155
00:59:04,395 --> 00:59:07,482
since you were swimming
in your daddy's balls.

1156
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:09,984
So I know all the tricks.

1157
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:11,653
You've either got a tack
in your shoe

1158
00:59:11,688 --> 00:59:13,620
or you're clinching your butt.

1159
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:16,492
I've got spikes
all over this thing.

1160
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:19,662
If you do it again,

1161
00:59:19,745 --> 00:59:21,962
I'm going to void this test

1162
00:59:21,997 --> 00:59:24,083
and report that you
were uncooperative.

1163
00:59:24,118 --> 00:59:25,417
Do you understand?

1164
00:59:25,501 --> 00:59:27,253
Yes, sir.

1165
00:59:30,173 --> 00:59:32,008
Walk with me.

1166
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:35,428
We've got a problem, Jim.

1167
00:59:35,463 --> 00:59:36,812
With what?

1168
00:59:36,847 --> 00:59:38,431
With your candor.

1169
00:59:39,516 --> 00:59:41,566
Come in.

1170
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:42,687
He's here, sir.

1171
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,438
Bring him in.

1172
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:48,609
Jim, this is Mr. Hollenbeck,
our regional director.

1173
00:59:48,693 --> 00:59:49,693
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1174
00:59:49,694 --> 00:59:51,195
Have a seat.

1175
00:59:51,279 --> 00:59:52,780
Mr. Gillespie.

1176
00:59:52,864 --> 00:59:55,200
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1177
00:59:57,536 --> 01:00:01,123
Jim, uh... you're an
exemplary candidate

1178
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:03,507
with valuable
operational experience.

1179
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:06,753
You've cleared the psych
and physical hurdles.

1180
01:00:06,788 --> 01:00:09,966
Your credit's good,
you've kept your nose clean,

1181
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:11,433
you've got the Spanish.

1182
01:00:11,468 --> 01:00:12,767
You clearance is still valid.

1183
01:00:12,802 --> 01:00:14,971
Everybody we talked to
for background

1184
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:17,105
had only great things
to say about you.

1185
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,225
And then you scored a
negative-five on the polygraph.

1186
01:00:19,309 --> 01:00:23,564
That's indicative of deception.

1187
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,149
We were wondering why

1188
01:00:25,232 --> 01:00:27,950
until we got the results
of urinalysis.

1189
01:00:27,985 --> 01:00:31,739
We detected THC metabolites
in the urine, Jim.

1190
01:00:33,575 --> 01:00:36,578
Levels were just below
the positive threshold,

1191
01:00:36,661 --> 01:00:39,212
but there was a presence.

1192
01:00:39,247 --> 01:00:41,333
Do you have a drug
problem, Mr. Davis?

1193
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:42,918
I don't have a
drug problem, sir.

1194
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:47,256
I made a very stupid mistake.

1195
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,674
Would you care to tell us
the circumstances

1196
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:50,276
of your stupid mistake?

1197
01:00:50,311 --> 01:00:51,844
I was at a party...

1198
01:00:51,928 --> 01:00:54,979
and someone offered me a joint.

1199
01:00:55,014 --> 01:00:58,769
I was pretty angry
about not getting into

1200
01:00:58,852 --> 01:01:02,773
the LAPD, so I was feeling
rebellious and, uh...

1201
01:01:05,776 --> 01:01:08,445
I inhaled.

1202
01:01:08,529 --> 01:01:11,116
Someone considering a career
in law enforcement

1203
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:12,700
would be well advised
to exercise

1204
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:14,369
a little more discipline.

1205
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,287
Yes, sir.

1206
01:01:17,705 --> 01:01:20,625
I'm on the fence, Doug.

1207
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:22,175
It's your call.

1208
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,547
Mr. Davis, I'm in charge
of several programs.

1209
01:01:24,582 --> 01:01:26,514
Yes, sir?

1210
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,468
Had a nice chat with your
old commanding officer.

1211
01:01:37,978 --> 01:01:39,694
Good.

1212
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,064
Recognize these guys?

1213
01:01:44,651 --> 01:01:47,737
Huh? Yeah, they're your buddies.

1214
01:01:47,821 --> 01:01:49,323
Your old Hajji buddies.

1215
01:01:49,407 --> 01:01:51,409
You should work in a deli
how you sliced these guys up.

1216
01:01:51,492 --> 01:01:52,493
Jesus Christ.

1217
01:01:52,577 --> 01:01:53,995
Oh, I'm sorry.

1218
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:56,497
Did I ruin your lunch?

1219
01:01:56,581 --> 01:01:58,332
You went through
those sons of bitches

1220
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:00,418
like butter.

1221
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:02,004
I took my objective

1222
01:02:02,087 --> 01:02:03,554
and did what was necessary

1223
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:06,592
to obtain information
vital to national security

1224
01:02:06,675 --> 01:02:08,760
that saved American lives.

1225
01:02:08,844 --> 01:02:10,644
Whacked them all, huh, Jim?

1226
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:12,931
My C.O. told me not to leave
anything breathing.

1227
01:02:13,015 --> 01:02:14,816
- I do what I'm told.
- Relax, son.

1228
01:02:14,851 --> 01:02:18,653
You were getting paid
to fuck people up.

1229
01:02:18,688 --> 01:02:20,356
You know we're beefing up
our anti-narcotics programs

1230
01:02:20,391 --> 01:02:22,859
in Latin America.

1231
01:02:22,942 --> 01:02:23,992
Yes, sir.

1232
01:02:24,027 --> 01:02:26,864
I had heard some things
on the grapevine.

1233
01:02:26,899 --> 01:02:28,497
I want you on my team.

1234
01:02:28,532 --> 01:02:30,367
I need someone who
can get things done

1235
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:32,203
on my task force in Colombia.

1236
01:02:32,238 --> 01:02:34,587
Sir...

1237
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:37,291
I listed Los Angeles and
San Diego on my dream sheet.

1238
01:02:37,374 --> 01:02:39,127
No slots in southern California?

1239
01:02:39,162 --> 01:02:40,761
No, Jim.

1240
01:02:40,796 --> 01:02:41,797
I got Colombia.

1241
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,798
That's what I have for you.

1242
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:45,275
If it's not what you want,

1243
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:46,718
thank you for your time.

1244
01:02:46,802 --> 01:02:49,137
You can hit the door.

1245
01:02:50,722 --> 01:02:53,810
What exactly would I be doing?

1246
01:02:53,893 --> 01:02:56,395
Running and gunning
in the jungle?

1247
01:02:56,479 --> 01:02:58,529
Mr. Davis, this is the deal.

1248
01:02:58,564 --> 01:03:00,531
You'll be riding shotgun
with the locals

1249
01:03:00,566 --> 01:03:02,819
as interpreter-advisor
on sharp end operations.

1250
01:03:02,902 --> 01:03:04,320
You'll be in some
very hot areas.

1251
01:03:04,356 --> 01:03:06,121
How hot?

1252
01:03:06,156 --> 01:03:07,658
We talking trigger time?

1253
01:03:07,693 --> 01:03:08,957
Sure, if you want.

1254
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:11,912
Well, who exactly
would I be working for?

1255
01:03:11,947 --> 01:03:14,081
The U.S. government, Jim.

1256
01:03:14,164 --> 01:03:16,917
I want you in Glynco,
Georgia next week.

1257
01:03:16,952 --> 01:03:19,087
You make it through
in one piece,

1258
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,674
you'll be working Colombia's
finest by the summer.

1259
01:03:22,709 --> 01:03:24,557
It's just that...

1260
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:27,178
I'm supposed to get
married, sir.

1261
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:29,264
Maybe now is not the time
to start a family.

1262
01:03:29,299 --> 01:03:30,933
We've been together a long time.

1263
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,352
I'm serious about marrying her.

1264
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:38,274
Foreign bride could jeopardize
your security clearance.

1265
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:43,078
Jim, don't shack up
with some Mexican.

1266
01:03:43,113 --> 01:03:46,533
Colombian broads are
smoking hot and knee deep.

1267
01:03:46,568 --> 01:03:48,785
You get a per diem
and a driver.

1268
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:50,954
You'll live like
a fucking king down there.

1269
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:52,080
Yes, sir, I understand.

1270
01:03:52,115 --> 01:03:53,088
You take some time,

1271
01:03:53,123 --> 01:03:54,541
think about what
you want to do.

1272
01:03:54,624 --> 01:03:55,784
This is a serious commitment.

1273
01:03:59,797 --> 01:04:03,217
I want the opportunity, sir.

1274
01:04:03,301 --> 01:04:05,219
I want on board.

1275
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:11,608
Welcome aboard.

1276
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:13,145
I'm taking a big chance on you.

1277
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:14,229
Thank you, sir.

1278
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:15,898
This is the career
I've dreamed of.

1279
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:17,316
These are your orders,

1280
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:18,879
orientation material
and travel money.

1281
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:22,822
Report to FLETC before the end
of working hours Wednesday.

1282
01:04:22,857 --> 01:04:24,991
Thank you, sir.

1283
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,159
God.

1284
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:46,348
Sorry, dog.

1285
01:04:52,187 --> 01:04:54,272
I got the job.

1286
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,275
Oh, shit.

1287
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,862
Yeah?

1288
01:04:59,946 --> 01:05:02,031
Me, too.

1289
01:05:04,283 --> 01:05:06,619
- When do you start?
- Monday.

1290
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:08,037
When do you start?

1291
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:09,253
Wednesday.

1292
01:05:09,288 --> 01:05:12,709
Big Jim, back on
the man's payroll.

1293
01:05:12,793 --> 01:05:15,511
Got the W-2

1294
01:05:15,546 --> 01:05:18,799
and the employee handbook
as proof of employment.

1295
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:21,885
I will be back in the
arms of my woman tonight.

1296
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:25,105
Good.

1297
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,559
Hey, we got to celebrate
this shit.

1298
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,145
<i>Salud.</i>

1299
01:05:33,815 --> 01:05:34,983
Oh, shit.

1300
01:05:38,988 --> 01:05:40,739
Fuzz.

1301
01:05:40,823 --> 01:05:42,623
They're on my ass, dog.

1302
01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:45,459
<i>And my license is suspended.</i>

1303
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:47,329
Yeah, maybe he's
after someone else.

1304
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:51,585
Shit. Fucking shit, man.

1305
01:05:51,668 --> 01:05:53,795
He's pointing right at me.

1306
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:56,336
And we got the open beers.

1307
01:05:56,371 --> 01:05:58,842
Fuck the beers, the guns.

1308
01:05:58,925 --> 01:06:00,725
Shoot the fucker.

1309
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,597
Car's in my name. We're fucked.

1310
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,353
Shit. Right when shit
was starting to go good, dude,

1311
01:06:09,437 --> 01:06:10,438
I'm going to jail.

1312
01:06:10,521 --> 01:06:11,772
Damn it, I'm going to jail.

1313
01:06:14,025 --> 01:06:15,611
I can dump these guys.

1314
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:18,864
Rip the video from their trunk.

1315
01:06:24,536 --> 01:06:25,704
Let's see them hands.

1316
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:28,673
Let's see your hands
on the fucking dash!

1317
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:31,711
Grab the sky or I'll blow
your fucking heads off.

1318
01:06:31,794 --> 01:06:33,963
Blink and die, scumbags.

1319
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:39,720
Oh.

1320
01:06:39,804 --> 01:06:41,639
Look who it is, dude.

1321
01:06:41,722 --> 01:06:43,224
It's all right,
I know these guys.

1322
01:06:43,307 --> 01:06:45,309
You fucking asshole.

1323
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:47,392
You're such a prick.
You scared the fuck out of me.

1324
01:06:47,394 --> 01:06:50,613
What's up, homie?

1325
01:06:50,648 --> 01:06:53,318
- What's up, fool?
- What's up, man.

1326
01:06:53,401 --> 01:06:55,869
I almost shot you, jerk.

1327
01:06:55,904 --> 01:06:57,405
That shit wasn't fucking
funny, Leo.

1328
01:06:57,489 --> 01:06:58,455
Yeah, it was hilarious.

1329
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:01,534
You guys getting fucked up?

1330
01:07:01,569 --> 01:07:04,544
Of course, dog, it's Friday.

1331
01:07:04,579 --> 01:07:06,916
Well, Boot,
you in the Academy yet?

1332
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:08,918
Fuck no.

1333
01:07:09,001 --> 01:07:10,253
Fuck the LAPD.

1334
01:07:10,336 --> 01:07:12,839
It's local small-time bullshit.

1335
01:07:12,874 --> 01:07:13,923
I'm going with the feds.

1336
01:07:14,006 --> 01:07:15,056
How'd you get that hook-up, dog?

1337
01:07:15,091 --> 01:07:17,260
You know, me, got my
connects, you know.

1338
01:07:17,295 --> 01:07:18,416
Going to FLETC on Wednesday.

1339
01:07:18,428 --> 01:07:20,097
Hey, see you can
get me in there.

1340
01:07:20,132 --> 01:07:21,765
Yeah, I'll look into that.

1341
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:23,565
How's Sylvia?

1342
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,769
None of your concern, ass wipe.

1343
01:07:25,853 --> 01:07:28,188
Say hi to her for me, no?

1344
01:07:28,223 --> 01:07:29,523
No.

1345
01:07:29,606 --> 01:07:33,194
<i>This vato's all protective
of his female.</i>

1346
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:35,363
Check this out.

1347
01:07:36,948 --> 01:07:37,949
Nice, huh?

1348
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:40,500
It's a nine? Uh-huh.

1349
01:07:40,535 --> 01:07:42,370
Sorry, dog, I got
a lot of nines.

1350
01:07:42,453 --> 01:07:43,956
Come on, dude,
it's a bad-ass Ruger.

1351
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:46,292
Talk to Toussaint.
He'll buy that shit.

1352
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:48,294
Toussaint, he's...
he's in Florida.

1353
01:07:48,329 --> 01:07:50,796
He's back. He called me today.

1354
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:55,217
Page me tonight, bro.

1355
01:07:55,301 --> 01:07:59,222
<i>We'll hit the clubs and
tear up some fine hinas.</i>

1356
01:07:59,257 --> 01:08:01,892
Later. Sure, dog.

1357
01:08:01,975 --> 01:08:03,393
I'm on the City's time.

1358
01:08:03,477 --> 01:08:06,146
You guys be cool.

1359
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:08,148
Okay?

1360
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:14,238
That fuck-
he put a scare in me.

1361
01:08:14,273 --> 01:08:15,507
Yeah, me, too.

1362
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:16,706
He's a dick.

1363
01:08:16,741 --> 01:08:18,493
Want to party with him?

1364
01:08:23,081 --> 01:08:25,584
See if this motherfucker's
home, dude.

1365
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:37,180
Toussaint? Toussaint?!

1366
01:08:37,263 --> 01:08:38,313
Yo, Toussaint?

1367
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:39,682
Yeah, come on, man.

1368
01:08:39,766 --> 01:08:43,603
Can't go far in that
little fucking place of yours.

1369
01:08:43,638 --> 01:08:45,688
Goddammit, I'm coming.

1370
01:08:45,772 --> 01:08:47,608
Chill out.

1371
01:08:49,109 --> 01:08:50,528
Washing that dirty ass.

1372
01:08:54,615 --> 01:08:56,617
Damn it.

1373
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,287
Group love. Group... Come on.

1374
01:08:59,371 --> 01:09:00,455
Group love, boys.

1375
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:04,292
Welcome back, hometown.

1376
01:09:04,376 --> 01:09:07,796
Hey, I missed you
crazy fuckers, man.

1377
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:09,297
Leo told us you were back.

1378
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:11,550
Thanks for calling asshole.

1379
01:09:15,972 --> 01:09:19,440
You a cop?

1380
01:09:19,475 --> 01:09:20,810
Uh-uh. Going federal.

1381
01:09:22,645 --> 01:09:26,150
Man, craziest head
I know is going

1382
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:27,151
to be a fed.

1383
01:09:27,234 --> 01:09:30,452
Yes, sir! Sir.

1384
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:32,156
Still sponging off your woman?

1385
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,658
Fuck you, dog. I got a job.

1386
01:09:34,693 --> 01:09:35,659
This motherfucker.

1387
01:09:35,742 --> 01:09:38,163
Look, dude.

1388
01:09:39,664 --> 01:09:41,666
This is bad.

1389
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:44,252
It's yours for three
big ones, dog.

1390
01:09:44,335 --> 01:09:48,256
Fuck yeah, I want it.

1391
01:09:48,339 --> 01:09:51,927
What's up? What's up?

1392
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:53,644
Huh?

1393
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,098
What the fuck you say now, huh?

1394
01:09:56,182 --> 01:09:57,683
Hey. Huh?

1395
01:09:57,766 --> 01:10:00,352
Bam, bam, bam.

1396
01:10:00,436 --> 01:10:03,356
Motherfucker, I'm strapped.

1397
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,775
What the fuck is up now, huh?

1398
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:07,318
Whoo-ooh!

1399
01:10:07,353 --> 01:10:08,778
Whoa, whoa.

1400
01:10:08,862 --> 01:10:11,823
Your kneecap and shit.

1401
01:10:11,858 --> 01:10:14,749
Step up and get blasted.

1402
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:18,789
Shit, man, what
the fuck is up now?

1403
01:10:18,824 --> 01:10:20,708
Hey, kick back, gunslinger.

1404
01:10:20,743 --> 01:10:21,674
It's loaded.

1405
01:10:21,709 --> 01:10:23,009
That shit goes through walls.

1406
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:24,405
You pop the neighbor's
little kids.

1407
01:10:25,546 --> 01:10:26,797
Uh-oh.

1408
01:10:26,832 --> 01:10:28,050
Ooh.

1409
01:10:28,967 --> 01:10:31,852
Fuck, dude.

1410
01:10:31,887 --> 01:10:34,938
Whoa, I'm straight, bro.

1411
01:10:34,973 --> 01:10:39,228
Yo, guys, we got
to party tonight, you know?

1412
01:10:39,263 --> 01:10:41,064
Go clubbin' or something.

1413
01:10:41,099 --> 01:10:42,398
I got a better idea.

1414
01:10:42,433 --> 01:10:43,364
What?

1415
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:44,400
Here, sir.

1416
01:10:46,402 --> 01:10:48,404
Let's go to Mexico.

1417
01:10:48,488 --> 01:10:50,038
Mexico?!

1418
01:10:50,073 --> 01:10:52,158
- Yeah.
- I'm in.

1419
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,880
Only fags like that...

1420
01:10:57,915 --> 01:10:59,882
Because you're a little faggot.

1421
01:10:59,917 --> 01:11:01,437
I don't get it,
too much fucking hills.

1422
01:11:01,453 --> 01:11:02,503
Right, right.

1423
01:11:02,586 --> 01:11:05,422
Dude, yo, dude, stay back boy,
stay back.

1424
01:11:05,457 --> 01:11:08,260
Motherfucker's got to ask
permission.

1425
01:11:08,343 --> 01:11:11,179
Fuck you, all right?

1426
01:11:11,263 --> 01:11:12,979
Let me tell you something.

1427
01:11:13,014 --> 01:11:15,016
I am a grown motherfucking man,
all right?

1428
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,768
I'm going to tell her
the good news,

1429
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:19,105
make up, grab my shit
and we are out.

1430
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:21,572
Lines, lines, and more lines.

1431
01:11:21,607 --> 01:11:23,943
For many passengers
traveling through LAX,

1432
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:26,077
the waiting has become
unbearable.

1433
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:28,364
It's hit or miss,
you can't predict it...

1434
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:30,616
Excuse me, you're not
made out of glass.

1435
01:11:30,651 --> 01:11:31,618
I'm made out of me.

1436
01:11:31,653 --> 01:11:34,253
You're drunk.

1437
01:11:34,288 --> 01:11:35,789
I'm celebrating, baby.

1438
01:11:35,873 --> 01:11:37,207
What, another wasted day?

1439
01:11:39,084 --> 01:11:40,711
Here.

1440
01:11:40,794 --> 01:11:43,547
Security since 9-11,
but that's true everywhere.

1441
01:11:43,582 --> 01:11:46,301
And still a recent study shows
the wait at LAX

1442
01:11:46,342 --> 01:11:47,886
is the third longest
in the world...

1443
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:53,057
This is a good company.

1444
01:11:53,099 --> 01:11:55,268
They make all
the new condos downtown.

1445
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,269
How much?

1446
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:57,354
$12 an hour.

1447
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:58,355
Plus their MIS guy

1448
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,565
is leaving in three months.

1449
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,400
I'm going to update
my certifications

1450
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:02,630
and take his job over.

1451
01:12:02,665 --> 01:12:03,819
Then I'll make bank.

1452
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,074
Such an asshole.

1453
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:11,042
What? Why? This shit is real.

1454
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,044
This is a great job,
the pay is outstanding

1455
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,999
and it's a great opportunity
for me to do what I want to do.

1456
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:17,751
I know.

1457
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,921
It's so... it's so Mike,
you know.

1458
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,174
You can't just go out
and get a shitty job.

1459
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:24,675
You gotta... you gotta get a...

1460
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:25,641
A dream job?

1461
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:27,011
Yeah, a dream job.

1462
01:12:27,053 --> 01:12:30,014
Well, why shouldn't your
dream guy have a dream job?

1463
01:12:30,049 --> 01:12:32,016
The ambitious plans
of many opponents

1464
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:35,020
on the County Board
of Supervisors...

1465
01:12:42,528 --> 01:12:44,863
Come here, I have a job for you.

1466
01:12:49,118 --> 01:12:52,705
? Da-da-da-da, doo-rup?

1467
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:56,292
? Da-da-da-da. Doo-rup.?

1468
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:58,461
What the fuck
is taking so long?

1469
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:00,047
I knew this shit would happen.

1470
01:13:00,082 --> 01:13:01,382
She hates my ass.

1471
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:03,717
She's not going to let him go.

1472
01:13:03,752 --> 01:13:05,553
Go knock.

1473
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:09,765
Dude, go knock.

1474
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:14,229
Bro, drag his fucking
ass out of there.

1475
01:13:21,403 --> 01:13:22,904
Yo, Miguel.

1476
01:13:25,408 --> 01:13:27,875
Hey.

1477
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:30,830
Mike, hurry up.

1478
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:33,881
Hey.

1479
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:35,751
Yo, what the fuck
are you doing?

1480
01:13:35,835 --> 01:13:37,135
Come on, dude.

1481
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:39,256
Dog, I'm tearin' it up, man.

1482
01:13:39,339 --> 01:13:41,633
I'm hittin' it, bro.
It's been a few days.

1483
01:13:41,675 --> 01:13:44,344
You guys just go ahead, man.
I'm gonna chill.

1484
01:13:44,379 --> 01:13:45,727
What?

1485
01:13:45,762 --> 01:13:48,265
I'm just gonna kick it here
with the woman.

1486
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,935
You said you'd go, man.

1487
01:13:50,977 --> 01:13:52,562
Your woman's in your head.

1488
01:13:52,597 --> 01:13:53,570
That's wrong.

1489
01:13:53,605 --> 01:13:54,939
She's got your nuts, bro.

1490
01:13:54,974 --> 01:13:56,858
Dog, dog...

1491
01:13:56,941 --> 01:13:59,861
Sylvia's all happy 'cause I
got a job, all right, dude?

1492
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:02,634
She wants us to
fuckin' chill together.

1493
01:14:02,669 --> 01:14:05,367
Man, that girl put
the zap on your head.

1494
01:14:05,451 --> 01:14:07,911
This is our last
chance to hang.

1495
01:14:07,946 --> 01:14:10,372
- You're like my brother.
- Yeah.

1496
01:14:10,456 --> 01:14:12,041
You're all I got.
You're gonna dog me like that?

1497
01:14:12,124 --> 01:14:15,593
I ain't no fucking do...
How are you, baby?

1498
01:14:15,628 --> 01:14:17,797
Hey, Sylvia, he's
going to Mexico.

1499
01:14:17,881 --> 01:14:21,176
No, he isn't, Jim. Yes, he is.

1500
01:14:21,218 --> 01:14:25,222
I'm joining the feds. I'm gone,
I'm out of here next week.

1501
01:14:25,257 --> 01:14:28,225
The least you can do
is let my best friend

1502
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,525
see me off.

1503
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,693
Baby, it's not safe.

1504
01:14:30,728 --> 01:14:32,188
All you're going
to do is drink.

1505
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:34,232
Aw, fuck, man.

1506
01:14:34,273 --> 01:14:35,948
Mike, come on.

1507
01:14:35,983 --> 01:14:37,860
Come on, fuck, man!

1508
01:14:37,902 --> 01:14:39,654
Come on, you promised.

1509
01:14:39,737 --> 01:14:41,240
You promised, man.

1510
01:14:41,323 --> 01:14:46,411
Yo... I promised, Sylvia, okay?

1511
01:14:46,495 --> 01:14:48,330
Mike, you're not
going to Mexico.

1512
01:14:48,372 --> 01:14:50,082
What?

1513
01:14:50,165 --> 01:14:51,632
You're not going.

1514
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,802
I'm not your fucking
puppet, Sylvia.

1515
01:14:54,837 --> 01:14:57,215
All right, you know what,
do what you want.

1516
01:14:57,257 --> 01:14:59,509
But I'm not going to be
here when you get back.

1517
01:14:59,592 --> 01:15:00,760
That's fucked up.

1518
01:15:00,802 --> 01:15:02,762
Why you got to lay
that bullshit on him?

1519
01:15:02,846 --> 01:15:04,681
Because I don't want him
going with you, Jim.

1520
01:15:04,764 --> 01:15:06,732
You're fucking nuts.

1521
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:09,019
You're crazy
and you're dangerous,

1522
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:11,021
and my biggest nightmare
is you with a fucking badge.

1523
01:15:11,056 --> 01:15:12,523
You're the last person
who should have one.

1524
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:13,489
Yeah? Yeah.

1525
01:15:13,524 --> 01:15:14,692
That's not bullshit,
it's the truth.

1526
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:15,985
Fuck this!

1527
01:15:16,026 --> 01:15:17,111
Whoa, wait.

1528
01:15:17,194 --> 01:15:18,612
Whatever, man.

1529
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:21,199
Fuckin' thanks, homie!

1530
01:15:21,234 --> 01:15:22,284
Yeah, laters.

1531
01:15:22,367 --> 01:15:24,703
Bye.

1532
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:26,120
Yo, yo.

1533
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:27,455
I'm going.

1534
01:15:28,874 --> 01:15:29,840
I gotta go.

1535
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,543
Get the fuck out of here, go!

1536
01:15:32,879 --> 01:15:33,629
Go!

1537
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:35,381
Fuck this shit, man.

1538
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:36,716
Good night, Sylvia.

1539
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:37,849
Kiss my ass, Jim.

1540
01:15:37,884 --> 01:15:39,927
Oh, any time, sellout.

1541
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:42,597
Oh, you going to be happy
once he's dead? Huh?

1542
01:15:51,565 --> 01:15:52,865
Hey, Toussaint.

1543
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,568
I heard the battle, man.

1544
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,904
Yo, your lady didn't
want you going, huh?

1545
01:15:56,939 --> 01:15:58,424
No, but I'm going.

1546
01:15:58,459 --> 01:15:59,908
- Hell, yeah.
- Shit.

1547
01:15:59,991 --> 01:16:01,492
- I'm a motherfucking man.
- That's right.

1548
01:16:01,576 --> 01:16:03,578
Shit. I walk the Earth at will.

1549
01:16:03,661 --> 01:16:05,538
- Damn right.
- I do whatever the fuck I want.

1550
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:06,661
You know, we're men, right?

1551
01:16:06,664 --> 01:16:07,832
- We're men, right?
- That's right.

1552
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:09,375
That's what we do, right?

1553
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:10,801
Amen. And don't worry-

1554
01:16:10,836 --> 01:16:13,088
home girl will be right there
waiting when you get back.

1555
01:16:13,123 --> 01:16:14,221
You're right. You're right.

1556
01:16:14,256 --> 01:16:15,466
She wouldn't play
that shit like that.

1557
01:16:15,507 --> 01:16:16,926
Shit, I got a fucking job
for real.

1558
01:16:16,961 --> 01:16:17,808
You did.

1559
01:16:17,843 --> 01:16:19,345
Plus you're my homie, dog.
You're my homie.

1560
01:16:19,512 --> 01:16:21,073
You're going to go fucking
do your thing

1561
01:16:21,096 --> 01:16:22,849
- and this is it.
- No, shit, dude.

1562
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:23,899
Yo, we're all dogs.

1563
01:16:23,934 --> 01:16:25,268
I got you guys back, man.

1564
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:26,353
No doubt, no doubt.

1565
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,104
It's just going to be
fucking cool, yo.

1566
01:16:28,188 --> 01:16:29,856
I got a job, you got a job.

1567
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,358
Shit, I got some bud.

1568
01:16:31,525 --> 01:16:32,741
- We got some smokes.
- We got some

1569
01:16:32,776 --> 01:16:34,493
- motherfucking money.
- We are on a mission.

1570
01:16:34,528 --> 01:16:37,532
Let's get our heads together
so we can achieve our objective

1571
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:38,664
in a timely manner.

1572
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:41,285
Let's get deployed, people.

1573
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,126
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1574
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:09,732
Rise and fucking shine.

1575
01:17:09,816 --> 01:17:12,277
Come on, ladies. Chow time.

1576
01:17:12,318 --> 01:17:13,487
Chow's getting cold.

1577
01:17:13,571 --> 01:17:16,574
Oh, what the fuck, Jim?
Chill, dude.

1578
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,675
Dude, where are we?

1579
01:17:33,758 --> 01:17:36,720
Family, man.

1580
01:17:36,761 --> 01:17:38,305
Damn! It's a shizzack...

1581
01:17:38,346 --> 01:17:40,099
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1582
01:17:40,134 --> 01:17:41,851
It's a home, all right?

1583
01:17:41,886 --> 01:17:44,061
Respect, bro.

1584
01:17:44,103 --> 01:17:45,938
Straighten up, fellas.

1585
01:17:49,358 --> 01:17:51,278
My old lady, Marta.

1586
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,244
<i>Hola.</i>

1587
01:17:52,279 --> 01:17:53,447

01:18:00,245 --> 01:18:02,206
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

1594
01:18:02,247 --> 01:18:03,505
Vicki. Vicki.

1595
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,460
<i>La prima, esa es mi prima.</i>

1596
01:18:05,543 --> 01:18:06,628
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

1597
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:07,879
<i>Mucho gusto. Mike. Vicki.</i>

01:18:07,914 --> 01:18:09,589
Toussaint.

01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:10,798
Vicki.

1600
01:18:10,882 --> 01:18:12,300
Okay.

1601
01:18:12,383 --> 01:18:14,010
Hey, grab yourselves a rock.

1602
01:18:14,045 --> 01:18:15,637
<i>Sí, por favor, sientense.</i>

1603
01:18:17,973 --> 01:18:18,939
Vicki?

1604
01:18:18,974 --> 01:18:20,643
<i>¿Café, quieren café?</i>

1605
01:18:20,726 --> 01:18:22,645
<i>Sí, café, por favor.
Vicki, andale.</i>

1606
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,897
<i>Tranquila, baby.</i>

1607
01:18:27,566 --> 01:18:29,068
¡Mama!

1608
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:31,238
Yeah, w-what's
she saying, dude?

1609
01:18:31,321 --> 01:18:33,323
Oh, they... they
think you're cool.

1610
01:18:33,406 --> 01:18:34,491
Oh, sweet.

1611
01:18:36,826 --> 01:18:38,627
<i>Aquí tienes. Gracias.</i>

1612
01:18:38,662 --> 01:18:40,997
<i>- Caliente.
- Thank you.</i>

1613
01:18:44,835 --> 01:18:47,505
Dude... Marta's
fine as fuck, bro.

1614
01:18:47,588 --> 01:18:48,714
Hey, hey, hey...

1615
01:18:48,756 --> 01:18:50,800
I'm just saying, dude.
You need to marry her, bro.

1616
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:53,177
If you don't, you're a fool.

1617
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:55,347
<i>¿Que dice?</i>

1618
01:18:55,382 --> 01:19:00,435
Oh... Oh, that shit's good, man.

1619
01:19:00,519 --> 01:19:03,021
No shit, you know they got that
good fucking weed from here.

1620
01:19:03,056 --> 01:19:05,941
That's what I want.
Some of that good shit.

1621
01:19:06,024 --> 01:19:08,361
You know where some fields
are or something, Jim?

1622
01:19:08,486 --> 01:19:10,947
Yeah, that's not... I want to
see, like, where they grow it.

1623
01:19:10,982 --> 01:19:12,115
You know, and then maybe

1624
01:19:12,156 --> 01:19:14,262
they'll let us go out
and, like, pick some.

1625
01:19:14,297 --> 01:19:16,369
You know, pick some of
that really good weed.

1626
01:19:27,047 --> 01:19:28,215
Shit.

1627
01:19:33,638 --> 01:19:34,639
Toussaint?

1628
01:19:39,477 --> 01:19:41,479
This is nice.

1629
01:19:41,563 --> 01:19:43,815
This is beautiful, man.

1630
01:19:43,899 --> 01:19:44,983
Dog, you see this?

1631
01:19:45,025 --> 01:19:47,320
Here.

1632
01:19:48,696 --> 01:19:52,158
Mmm... Beautiful... Man!

1633
01:19:52,241 --> 01:19:53,624
Mmm!

1634
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:55,745
<i>When the hell'd you get
all the pistos, dog?</i>

1635
01:19:55,828 --> 01:19:57,038
<i>Mexico, man.</i>

1636
01:19:57,079 --> 01:19:58,081
It's magic.

1637
01:20:02,336 --> 01:20:03,420
He bleed?

1638
01:20:03,503 --> 01:20:04,421
Like a stuffed pig.

1639
01:20:05,589 --> 01:20:07,424
How'd Letty know you were
tearing up her sister?

1640
01:20:07,466 --> 01:20:10,010
That fuckin' bitch Patti, right?

1641
01:20:10,052 --> 01:20:11,679
- Ah...
- I took her to dinner.

1642
01:20:11,763 --> 01:20:14,015
Took her for a cruise
up to Malibu, you know?

1643
01:20:14,098 --> 01:20:16,768
Got up all in it.
Back of my ride...

1644
01:20:16,809 --> 01:20:18,436
Pounded that fish, man.

1645
01:20:18,519 --> 01:20:19,854
Good fuckin' fish.

1646
01:20:19,896 --> 01:20:20,980
I figured the crazy broad

1647
01:20:21,022 --> 01:20:22,322
pulled out some hairs and pubes

1648
01:20:22,357 --> 01:20:24,074
and stashed it in the seat,
you know?

1649
01:20:24,109 --> 01:20:26,737
Oh, dude, you got to watch that
shit, man.

1650
01:20:26,772 --> 01:20:29,031
Chicks get treacherous.

1651
01:20:29,114 --> 01:20:31,700
Yeah, no shit.
Sibling rivalry, Jim.

1652
01:20:31,735 --> 01:20:33,083
Next day,

1653
01:20:33,118 --> 01:20:35,579
I'm driving around with Letty
all kick back and shit,

1654
01:20:35,614 --> 01:20:38,959
and she radars in
on this rat's nest, man.

1655
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:41,795
Pulls out these long-ass hairs,
she's like "What are these?"

1656
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:42,796
"Whose are these?"

1657
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:47,384
She sees all the pubes mixed in,
man... fuckin' busted.

1658
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:49,387
Busted! Busted!

1659
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:50,686
Oh!

1660
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:53,057
Dude, how'd she know
they were her sister's?

1661
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,559
Oh, come on, dude.

1662
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:56,143
Mexican chick voodoo,
right, Mike?

1663
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,693
You know, live and learn.

1664
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:00,231
Yep, next time you'll be all up
in your ride

1665
01:21:00,266 --> 01:21:02,067
with the Super Vac, dude. Treachery!

1666
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,152
Yep, treachery.

1667
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:15,206
Um... shouldn't we
be helping them?

1668
01:21:15,248 --> 01:21:16,749
You know how to hand wash?

1669
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:18,334
- No.
- Then don't sweat it.

1670
01:21:18,376 --> 01:21:19,419
Yeah, we're men.

1671
01:21:19,586 --> 01:21:21,004
They know we don't do that shit.

1672
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:22,005
That's right.

1673
01:21:22,046 --> 01:21:23,423
We're men.

1674
01:21:25,258 --> 01:21:26,594
Oh, yeah!

1675
01:21:29,805 --> 01:21:31,015
This is paradise, huh?

1676
01:21:31,098 --> 01:21:32,433
Mm-hmm.

1677
01:21:34,268 --> 01:21:35,853
Yo, Mike?

1678
01:21:35,936 --> 01:21:37,354
Yeah?

1679
01:21:37,438 --> 01:21:38,678
They're sending me to Colombia.

1680
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:47,032
Colombia.

1681
01:21:47,073 --> 01:21:48,700
Who, the man?

1682
01:21:48,783 --> 01:21:50,660
Yep.

1683
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:52,872
They're tearing shit up down
there, they need my help.

1684
01:21:52,955 --> 01:21:54,755
Doing what?

1685
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:56,583
Busting up drug labs
and drug lords

1686
01:21:56,618 --> 01:21:58,377
- and all that shit.
- You got it.

1687
01:21:58,461 --> 01:22:00,880
Gonna be an advisor, you know-
shoot him, him and him.

1688
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:03,049
Then it's back to the barracks
for bitches and beer.

1689
01:22:03,132 --> 01:22:04,933
I'm set.

1690
01:22:04,968 --> 01:22:07,137
Why do you want to do
that shit, dude?

1691
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:12,100
I mean... what about
Marta, you know?

1692
01:22:12,142 --> 01:22:15,145
I mean... Ain't gonna happen.

1693
01:22:15,187 --> 01:22:17,649
They told me not to get married.

1694
01:22:17,684 --> 01:22:19,567
That's messed.

1695
01:22:19,651 --> 01:22:20,691
They really told you that?

1696
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:22,445
Not straight up,
but I heard 'em.

1697
01:22:22,487 --> 01:22:25,323
Yo, if the feds won't let you
hook up with your old lady,

1698
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:26,991
you need to tell them
to fuck off.

1699
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,458
Yeah, I mean,

1700
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:31,163
you love her,
she loves you, right?

1701
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:33,832
Dude, you need to move
down here, marry Marta,

1702
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:35,334
you know, get a good-ass job

1703
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:38,003
working with fucking
tourists or something.

1704
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:39,386
Fuck that.

1705
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,715
Taking bucket baths
in cold-ass water?

1706
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:43,593
You know, wading around
in ankle-deep mud?

1707
01:22:43,628 --> 01:22:44,594
Outhouses, man!

1708
01:22:44,678 --> 01:22:46,596
Fuckin' outhouses!

1709
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,682
You told Marta yet?

1710
01:22:52,602 --> 01:22:54,229
You love this place.

1711
01:22:54,271 --> 01:22:57,525
It's in your eyes, man.

1712
01:22:57,608 --> 01:22:59,992
Dude, this is
what it's all about.

1713
01:23:00,027 --> 01:23:04,282
You got a woman that loves
you and a place to stay.

1714
01:23:04,365 --> 01:23:05,950
You'd be happy here,
and you know it.

1715
01:23:06,033 --> 01:23:10,289
Yeah, well,
shacking up with Marta,

1716
01:23:10,372 --> 01:23:15,460
squeezing out some puppies,
has its appeal, but...

1717
01:23:15,544 --> 01:23:18,797
this is my career.

1718
01:23:18,839 --> 01:23:20,842
I got one shot.

1719
01:23:20,884 --> 01:23:22,427
You're making a mistake.

1720
01:23:22,552 --> 01:23:27,223
You should stay right
here with your lady.

1721
01:23:27,307 --> 01:23:30,560
What the fuck you
gonna do in Colombia?

1722
01:23:32,812 --> 01:23:35,983
Whack people, program shit.

1723
01:23:36,025 --> 01:23:38,652
You ain't down, fuck you.

1724
01:23:38,736 --> 01:23:40,571
Bring in my gunships

1725
01:23:40,654 --> 01:23:43,657
and smoke your little jungle
hideaway. You know?

1726
01:23:43,741 --> 01:23:45,367
I mean, I'm a solider
of the apocalypse, man.

1727
01:23:45,402 --> 01:23:46,578
I'll be in a chopper,

1728
01:23:46,661 --> 01:23:50,332
door-gunning villagers
and shit. Fuck 'em.

1729
01:23:50,415 --> 01:23:53,209
Kill the chickens
and dogs, too, man.

1730
01:23:54,586 --> 01:23:57,088
I don't give a fuck.

1731
01:24:09,018 --> 01:24:12,104
Shh, shh... Got the chills...

1732
01:24:12,105 --> 01:24:15,105
I feel like someone dipped me in ice.

1733
01:24:21,106 --> 01:24:23,106
The devil sat on you.

1734
01:24:24,108 --> 01:24:26,108
Thank you for coming.

1735
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:30,749
Everyone misses you when you're gone.

1736
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:31,876
Yeah.

1737
01:24:33,877 --> 01:24:38,878
When you're gone, your image in my mind
sustains me.

1738
01:24:39,879 --> 01:24:41,379
Try eating.

1739
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,380
You're so romantic.

1740
01:24:59,382 --> 01:25:00,382
What is that?

1741
01:25:01,984 --> 01:25:03,884
What's it mean?

1742
01:25:04,885 --> 01:25:11,385
A poem about a deer and a rainbow
and a river in the mountains.

1743
01:25:14,887 --> 01:25:16,887
It's beautiful...

1744
01:25:17,588 --> 01:25:19,388
What does it mean?

1745
01:25:19,389 --> 01:25:21,389
I told you.

1746
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:28,391
No, what's it really mean?
The trippy deep meaning.

1747
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:34,392
I'm not telling you.

1748
01:25:36,393 --> 01:25:38,393
I'll ask your mom.

1749
01:25:38,394 --> 01:25:40,395
She won't tell you.

1750
01:25:41,396 --> 01:25:44,396
I'll ask someone at the party.

1751
01:25:45,397 --> 01:25:47,397
You'll know by then.

1752
01:25:50,398 --> 01:25:51,998
Know what?

1753
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,000
Nothing.

1754
01:26:02,224 --> 01:26:03,308
Doce años.

1755
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:04,941
Doce años. Doce años...

1756
01:26:04,976 --> 01:26:07,188
Doce... we've been
together that long.

1757
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:08,481
<i>Es muy bonita.</i>

1758
01:26:08,564 --> 01:26:09,857
Man, you're bring sand
to the beach, dumb ass.

1759
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:12,151
Cover that shit up. Jim, dude!

1760
01:26:12,186 --> 01:26:13,319
Huh?

1761
01:26:13,402 --> 01:26:15,821
How you say, um, "You're
beautiful" in Spanish?

1762
01:26:15,856 --> 01:26:17,406
<i>Huh? "Bonita." Bonita.</i>

1763
01:26:19,826 --> 01:26:22,079
Come on, you don't know
that shit, Toussaint?

1764
01:26:22,114 --> 01:26:23,872
<i>Tu... bonita.</i>

1765
01:26:23,914 --> 01:26:24,998
<i>Gracias.</i>

1766
01:26:25,082 --> 01:26:26,541
Hey, baby, see my new one?

1767
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:27,918
- Right, did I get it?
- Huh?

1768
01:26:27,953 --> 01:26:29,169
Think I got it?

1769
01:26:29,253 --> 01:26:32,340
Yeah, she got the point.

1770
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:38,930
Yo, Mike, that chick digs you.

1771
01:26:38,972 --> 01:26:40,765
What chick?

1772
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:44,353
Oh, she's good, dog.

1773
01:26:44,436 --> 01:26:46,570
Yeah, name's Lila.

1774
01:26:46,605 --> 01:26:48,691
She's a freak.
She'll fuck you, dude.

1775
01:26:50,192 --> 01:26:51,944
She's a freak, huh?

1776
01:26:51,986 --> 01:26:53,612
How you know? You fuck her?

1777
01:26:53,654 --> 01:26:55,698
No, out of respect for Marta.

1778
01:26:55,739 --> 01:26:58,868
Not that I don't want...
Hey, baby.

1779
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:02,414
Ask her to dance.

1780
01:27:02,497 --> 01:27:04,583
I'm not cheating
on Sylvia, dude.

1781
01:27:06,376 --> 01:27:09,630
There's a big gap between
dancing and fucking, man.

1782
01:27:09,665 --> 01:27:11,549
Go explore it.

1783
01:27:12,717 --> 01:27:14,385
No shit.

1784
01:27:23,562 --> 01:27:24,062
Whoo!

1785
01:28:49,473 --> 01:28:52,574
C'mon woman. I'm going crazy.

1786
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:57,541
I can't...

1787
01:28:58,436 --> 01:29:01,142
A little blood never scared me.

1788
01:29:02,643 --> 01:29:04,644
It's not that.

1789
01:29:05,645 --> 01:29:07,645
What then?

1790
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:23,147
Soon they will have milk.

1791
01:29:27,648 --> 01:29:29,149
Milk?

1792
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:41,394
Didn't you take your fuckin' injections?

1793
01:29:42,395 --> 01:29:44,395
Don't get pissed off...

1794
01:29:44,396 --> 01:29:47,396
You did your part. I can do
the rest myself.

1795
01:29:57,398 --> 01:30:02,398
You're going to the doctor and getting it
taken care of.

1796
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,944
No.

1797
01:30:05,945 --> 01:30:09,946
I love you and I want to have your child.

1798
01:30:11,947 --> 01:30:16,447
If you want to run away, go.
I don't need your help.

1799
01:30:16,498 --> 01:30:18,083
You're fucking nuts.

1800
01:30:20,685 --> 01:30:23,385
What if I punch you in the belly...?

1801
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:28,386
No one speaks to me like that.

1802
01:30:28,432 --> 01:30:31,433
Not you. Not my father.

1803
01:30:31,694 --> 01:30:34,434
Maybe I should just shoot you.

1804
01:30:34,435 --> 01:30:35,435
Go ahead.

1805
01:30:37,436 --> 01:30:38,436
Go ahead.

1806
01:30:38,937 --> 01:30:45,438
I'm going to lose my life someday.
Why not at the hands of someone I love?

1807
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:48,439
Is that true?

1808
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,940
Think I am playing?

1809
01:30:57,942 --> 01:31:00,446
You don't know what I can do.

1810
01:31:02,596 --> 01:31:05,096
Yes, I know what you can do...

1811
01:31:07,897 --> 01:31:10,098
But I still love you...

1812
01:31:10,099 --> 01:31:13,099
Because I see you, not your deeds...

1813
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,100
If you want to kill me...

1814
01:31:19,131 --> 01:31:23,133
Because I love you...
Then do it.

1815
01:31:24,905 --> 01:31:27,074
You fucked up, woman.

1816
01:31:28,743 --> 01:31:30,745
I'll do it.

1817
01:31:35,918 --> 01:31:37,419
It's easy.

1818
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:57,857
Jim!

1819
01:32:22,634 --> 01:32:24,385
What's up, man, huh?

1820
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,138
Where's Toussaint?

1821
01:32:26,222 --> 01:32:27,431
He's dancing.

1822
01:32:27,466 --> 01:32:28,554
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1823
01:32:28,589 --> 01:32:30,775
You gonna get back - to the party?
Yeah.

1824
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:33,062
Let's get back
to the party, man.

1825
01:32:34,563 --> 01:32:36,399
- Yeah.
- Hey, uh, go,

1826
01:32:36,482 --> 01:32:38,067
go tell Toussaint that

1827
01:32:38,151 --> 01:32:39,653
we're gonna get the
fuck out of here, man.

1828
01:32:39,736 --> 01:32:41,321
Just go into the party,
tell him we're gonna go.

1829
01:32:41,405 --> 01:32:42,322
We're leaving, huh?

1830
01:32:42,406 --> 01:32:43,824
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna leave.

1831
01:32:43,907 --> 01:32:45,492
Let's go, yeah?

1832
01:32:45,575 --> 01:32:46,660
Yeah, let's go.

1833
01:32:46,743 --> 01:32:48,078
Go ahead, go get
Toussaint, man.

1834
01:32:48,161 --> 01:32:49,162
Go get him.

1835
01:32:56,921 --> 01:32:58,756
Hey, we're going.

1836
01:32:58,791 --> 01:32:59,722
Come on.

1837
01:32:59,757 --> 01:33:00,723
Fuck you, dude.

1838
01:33:00,758 --> 01:33:02,760
I'm having a great time, bro.

1839
01:33:02,844 --> 01:33:04,847
Then walk back to L.A.,
motherfucker.

1840
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:06,348
You're in the car or not.

1841
01:33:10,436 --> 01:33:12,354
He's fucking crazy, man.
What the fuck!

1842
01:33:12,389 --> 01:33:15,357
All right, let's go, man.

1843
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:19,613
Hey, yo, what the fuck
is your problem, psycho?!

1844
01:33:19,648 --> 01:33:21,329
Hey, hey, homeboy's
losing it, all right?

1845
01:33:21,364 --> 01:33:24,367
Shut the fuck up and just
get in the car, all right?

1846
01:33:24,451 --> 01:33:25,452
Fucking bullshit!

1847
01:33:27,954 --> 01:33:29,290
Fucked up!

1848
01:33:58,321 --> 01:34:01,741
Dude, dude... dude, slow down.

1849
01:34:05,161 --> 01:34:06,663
Fuck, man.

1850
01:34:06,746 --> 01:34:10,299
Whoo, yeah, man.

1851
01:34:10,334 --> 01:34:12,002
Slow down,
you crazy motherfucker!

1852
01:34:12,037 --> 01:34:14,755
I want a cop to pull me over.

1853
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:18,557
Treachery.

1854
01:34:18,592 --> 01:34:20,720
Fucking treachery.

1855
01:34:20,755 --> 01:34:22,847
Jim, slow down!

1856
01:34:22,882 --> 01:34:24,015
Shut up!

1857
01:34:25,183 --> 01:34:26,601
Fuck, dude.

1858
01:34:27,352 --> 01:34:29,604
Only female I trust.

1859
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:33,526
Fuck you, God!

1860
01:34:33,609 --> 01:34:37,113
You ain't got the fucking balls
to take my ass.

1861
01:34:38,698 --> 01:34:42,201
Jim, don't say that shit, dude.

1862
01:34:57,301 --> 01:34:58,469
Jim!

1863
01:35:01,472 --> 01:35:05,059
Dude, you are getting
out of control, okay?

1864
01:35:05,143 --> 01:35:08,062
You need psychiatric help, man.

1865
01:35:08,097 --> 01:35:10,948
You're seriously
fucked up, dude.

1866
01:35:10,983 --> 01:35:16,488
All right, you need to sue
the military or something.

1867
01:35:16,523 --> 01:35:18,240
You used to be mellow.

1868
01:35:21,577 --> 01:35:22,829
Later, homie.

1869
01:35:22,912 --> 01:35:24,664
'Night, dog.

1870
01:35:24,699 --> 01:35:26,881
Laters.

1871
01:35:26,916 --> 01:35:28,918
Dude, I ain't hanging
around you anymore

1872
01:35:28,953 --> 01:35:30,253
until you get
some fucking help.

1873
01:35:30,288 --> 01:35:33,006
You can 12-step off, bitch.

1874
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,342
You're dismissed.

1875
01:35:48,105 --> 01:35:49,858
He's right, dude.

1876
01:35:49,942 --> 01:35:50,943
Yeah.

1877
01:35:53,862 --> 01:35:56,365
Georgia will get me
squared away.

1878
01:35:56,448 --> 01:35:59,249
Hope so.

1879
01:35:59,284 --> 01:36:02,789
What was that shit
with Marta, dude?

1880
01:36:02,824 --> 01:36:07,543
I don't know why that happened.

1881
01:36:09,712 --> 01:36:11,798
But I'm cool. I'm cool now.

1882
01:36:11,881 --> 01:36:13,717
Okay?

1883
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:16,970
Yeah.

1884
01:36:17,005 --> 01:36:18,305
I'm cool.

1885
01:36:29,401 --> 01:36:31,736
Look, dude, she told me
she was pregnant.

1886
01:36:31,771 --> 01:36:33,488
I had a panic attack.

1887
01:36:33,571 --> 01:36:34,739
I pulled my gun.

1888
01:36:34,774 --> 01:36:35,872
Come on, dog,

1889
01:36:35,907 --> 01:36:37,659
I thought you loved her, dude.

1890
01:36:37,742 --> 01:36:40,211
I do.

1891
01:36:40,246 --> 01:36:42,296
God, fuck.

1892
01:36:42,331 --> 01:36:45,084
Come on, man, let's
go drop off that bud.

1893
01:36:48,504 --> 01:36:49,755
What bud?

1894
01:36:49,839 --> 01:36:52,676
There's 20 kilos in the trunk.

1895
01:36:52,711 --> 01:36:53,976
Say that again?

1896
01:36:54,011 --> 01:36:56,179
There's 20 kilos
in the trunk, man.

1897
01:36:57,764 --> 01:36:59,064
- Of weed?
- Yeah.

1898
01:36:59,099 --> 01:37:00,517
Get the fuck out of here, man.

1899
01:37:00,552 --> 01:37:02,411
I picked it up at the party.

1900
01:37:02,446 --> 01:37:04,272
I'm dropping it at Casper's.

1901
01:37:04,355 --> 01:37:05,940
Casper's?

1902
01:37:06,024 --> 01:37:08,443
I get three Gs.

1903
01:37:08,478 --> 01:37:10,827
We get three Gs.

1904
01:37:10,862 --> 01:37:12,447
You drove it across the border?

1905
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:14,581
Yeah.

1906
01:37:14,616 --> 01:37:15,950
What if they would've caught us?

1907
01:37:15,985 --> 01:37:17,751
Couldn't happen, man.

1908
01:37:17,786 --> 01:37:21,373
My shit is on fire
right now, man.

1909
01:37:21,457 --> 01:37:24,043
My shit is wired
right now, man.

1910
01:37:24,126 --> 01:37:26,211
You risked my ass
without telling me?

1911
01:37:26,295 --> 01:37:29,048
That's not cool, man.
For three fucking Gs?

1912
01:37:29,131 --> 01:37:31,801
That's... that's a good rate
for transporting that.

1913
01:37:31,836 --> 01:37:33,403
Shit, if I'd told you,

1914
01:37:33,438 --> 01:37:34,971
you would have gotten

1915
01:37:35,055 --> 01:37:37,641
all fucking hinkey at the
border, man, gotten us nabbed.

1916
01:37:37,724 --> 01:37:39,643
I wouldn't have been
in the fucking car, dude!

1917
01:37:39,726 --> 01:37:42,062
I would've been on
motherfucking Greyhound.

1918
01:37:42,146 --> 01:37:44,065
That's a serious breach
of the homie code, man,

1919
01:37:44,148 --> 01:37:45,698
not fuckin' telling me.

1920
01:37:45,733 --> 01:37:48,402
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry, you know.

1921
01:37:48,569 --> 01:37:50,738
I should've had...
I should've got you guys,

1922
01:37:50,773 --> 01:37:52,298
you know,
walk across the border.

1923
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:53,789
I could've met you somewhere.

1924
01:37:53,824 --> 01:37:55,994
But, you know, I got
bills, I got shit.

1925
01:37:56,078 --> 01:37:57,329
I gotta put my shit in storage.

1926
01:37:57,412 --> 01:37:59,665
I gotta get gas out to Georgia.

1927
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:01,632
Oh, fuck your money woes, dog!

1928
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:03,752
I am not catching
a fuckin' case for you.

1929
01:38:03,835 --> 01:38:05,719
Let me out of the fucking car
right now.

1930
01:38:05,754 --> 01:38:07,339
Fuck, man. Come on, man,
let's drop this shit off.

1931
01:38:07,422 --> 01:38:08,341
Let's get paid!

1932
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:09,842
Let me out right here.

1933
01:38:09,926 --> 01:38:11,302
Mi-Mi-Mi-Mike! Listen, listen!

1934
01:38:11,337 --> 01:38:12,679
Let me out right here,
right now!

1935
01:38:12,762 --> 01:38:14,681
You will feel so much better
with a fistful of twenties.

1936
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:16,349
Huh?

1937
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:19,936
Dude, we're drunk,

1938
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:22,606
and we got a trunk full of
fuckin' weed, dude, I am not...

1939
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:25,192
Okay, fuckin', Mike,
don't bitch out on me!

1940
01:38:25,227 --> 01:38:28,327
Don't fucking bitch out on me!

1941
01:38:28,362 --> 01:38:29,863
I am still on probation,
dick head.

1942
01:38:29,947 --> 01:38:31,448
Let me out now!

1943
01:38:31,532 --> 01:38:32,700
Let me out right here
right fuckin' now, dude!

1944
01:38:32,735 --> 01:38:34,452
Let me get paid, will you?

1945
01:38:34,536 --> 01:38:35,954
Will you fuckin'
let me get paid?!

1946
01:38:36,037 --> 01:38:37,038
Oh, yo, get paid, man.

1947
01:38:37,122 --> 01:38:39,124
Fuckin' go for it, all right?

1948
01:38:39,207 --> 01:38:41,626
Just let me get the fuck out.
I don't give a fuck, dude.

1949
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:47,967
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

1950
01:38:49,218 --> 01:38:51,470
What the fuck
are you doing, Jim?

1951
01:38:51,554 --> 01:38:53,055
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1952
01:38:53,139 --> 01:38:54,223
Fuck you!

1953
01:39:01,231 --> 01:39:05,152
Fuck, I'm sorry, dude,
I'm sorry, dude.

1954
01:39:05,235 --> 01:39:07,202
Okay? I'm sorry.

1955
01:39:07,237 --> 01:39:09,573
Why the fuck did you put
a gun to my head?

1956
01:39:09,608 --> 01:39:12,327
Huh?

1957
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:13,710
You gonna shoot me?

1958
01:39:13,745 --> 01:39:16,497
No, man. I'm sorry.
I was trippin'.

1959
01:39:16,581 --> 01:39:20,717
I'd never...

1960
01:39:20,752 --> 01:39:23,922
I'd never put a fuckin' gun
to your head, dude

1961
01:39:23,957 --> 01:39:25,090
I know.

1962
01:39:25,174 --> 01:39:27,593
I know you wouldn't, man.
I'm sorry.

1963
01:39:27,676 --> 01:39:30,095
First your lady, now me, man.
What the fuck is up?

1964
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:32,062
I'm not thinking.

1965
01:39:32,097 --> 01:39:33,599
I got too much shit going on.

1966
01:39:37,354 --> 01:39:40,774
Oh, fuck, I'm just faded,
man, that's all.

1967
01:39:40,857 --> 01:39:42,776
I'm just fuckin'
fade right now, okay?

1968
01:39:42,859 --> 01:39:44,361
I'll cruise you by your pad.

1969
01:39:44,396 --> 01:39:45,528
I'll drop you off, man.

1970
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:46,696
I'm sorry.

1971
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:47,864
I'm sorry.

1972
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:50,451
Yeah. You're a fuck-up.

1973
01:39:52,787 --> 01:39:56,457
I'm going with you so you
don't fuck this shit up, too.

1974
01:39:56,540 --> 01:40:01,045
We'll go to Casper's...

1975
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,012
Yeah.

1976
01:40:02,047 --> 01:40:03,513
Then you can drop me off home,

1977
01:40:03,548 --> 01:40:06,385
you can go to Georgia fed out
and be the fuckin' man.

1978
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:09,888
Yeah, I'm gonna be
the fucking man.

1979
01:40:09,923 --> 01:40:11,473
I can drop you off, you know.

1980
01:40:11,508 --> 01:40:13,190
Take you up the hill.

1981
01:40:13,225 --> 01:40:14,644
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1982
01:40:14,679 --> 01:40:17,563
No.

1983
01:40:17,647 --> 01:40:21,150
Keep on going.

1984
01:40:28,492 --> 01:40:29,458
Looks sketchy.

1985
01:40:29,493 --> 01:40:31,578
I don't know.

1986
01:40:35,749 --> 01:40:37,918
Ho, what, you gonna
shoot their pigeons?

1987
01:40:38,002 --> 01:40:39,086
Yeah.

1988
01:40:39,169 --> 01:40:40,422
Just hurry up.

1989
01:40:53,269 --> 01:40:54,687
Yo, Casper!

1990
01:40:59,275 --> 01:41:00,776
<i>Buenos noches, señor.</i>

01:41:14,458 --> 01:41:16,126
<i>Con permiso.</i>

01:41:39,401 --> 01:41:40,402

01:41:56,337 --> 01:41:57,977
<i>Got blasted by the hulas

2007
01:41:58,005 --> 01:41:59,305
Damn.

Sorry to hear that, dog.

2009
01:42:01,425 --> 01:42:02,760
You play, you pay.

2010
01:42:02,843 --> 01:42:04,095
He knew what time it was.

2011
01:42:04,178 --> 01:42:05,811
Right.

2012
01:42:05,846 --> 01:42:07,515
Hey, we gotta bounce.

2013
01:42:07,598 --> 01:42:08,815
You got the money?

2014
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:11,186
Yeah, just let me

01:42:13,355 --> 01:42:15,524
Yo, bring the feria, homey!

2016
01:42:16,775 --> 01:42:18,408
How's your old lady?

Eh... bitch finally

01:42:21,315 --> 01:42:22,615
Oh, fuck it!

Yeah, now she can

I got all the feria

2021
01:42:25,868 --> 01:42:27,620
It's all rolled up and shit.

01:42:27,704 --> 01:42:28,544
You know what I mean?

2023
01:42:28,621 --> 01:42:30,123
Ready to go, dog.
Check this out, homes.

2024
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:31,089
Ah, hell, nah!

2025
01:42:31,124 --> 01:42:32,458
Yo, hold up, dog. Don't trip.

2026
01:42:32,542 --> 01:42:33,961
<i>I know these fools.
They're with me, ese.</i>

2027
01:42:33,996 --> 01:42:35,379
These are the fools
that jacked me, man!

2028
01:42:35,462 --> 01:42:37,715
Fuck these motherfuckers!
I'm shooting both of 'em!

2029
01:42:37,798 --> 01:42:40,050
At least give the homeboy
a pass right here, dog.

2030
01:42:40,134 --> 01:42:41,218
Yeah, yeah, let him bounce.

2031
01:42:41,253 --> 01:42:42,268
I don't give a fuck.

2032
01:42:42,303 --> 01:42:43,823
I want this white boy
in a box, though.

2033
01:42:43,839 --> 01:42:44,888
Hey, you in the ride.

2034
01:42:44,972 --> 01:42:46,558
<i>I ever see you again,

2035
01:42:46,641 --> 01:42:48,977

'cause you're a dead man.

2036
01:42:49,012 --> 01:42:50,312
Hey, just get the fuck
outta here, Mike.

2037
01:42:50,347 --> 01:42:51,813
Take off, homey.

2038
01:42:51,896 --> 01:42:53,898
I'll be cool.

2039
01:43:01,574 --> 01:43:03,242
What the fuck?

2040
01:43:04,327 --> 01:43:05,745
<i>Don't trip, ese. I'm cool.</i>

2041
01:43:08,414 --> 01:43:09,582
Chill, dog! Chill, dog!

2042
01:43:09,665 --> 01:43:11,132
I got three kids...

2043
01:43:11,167 --> 01:43:13,337
Oh, no, please, sir! Please!

2044
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,588
No, no, no, no, no! Jim, no!

2045
01:43:14,671 --> 01:43:16,673
Please, please.

2046
01:43:36,194 --> 01:43:37,529
Why the fuck did you do that?

2047
01:43:41,283 --> 01:43:42,284
Pull the door!

2048
01:44:25,497 --> 01:44:26,915
Oh, my God, Jim!

2049
01:44:26,999 --> 01:44:27,882
I'm hit bad.

2050
01:44:27,917 --> 01:44:29,384
What have we done?

2051
01:44:29,419 --> 01:44:31,671
I can't move my arm...
and I can't feel my legs!

2052
01:44:33,006 --> 01:44:35,139
I can't move shit.

2053
01:44:35,174 --> 01:44:37,427
I'm fucked up. I'm fucked up.

2054
01:44:37,462 --> 01:44:38,761
I'm fucked up.

2055
01:44:49,773 --> 01:44:54,077
Okay... Don't trip...
Don't trip, dog.

2056
01:44:54,112 --> 01:44:56,281
County Hospital's right there.

2057
01:44:56,364 --> 01:44:57,782
No! No! No! County Hospital...

2058
01:44:57,817 --> 01:44:59,200
Don't you dare take me there!

2059
01:44:59,235 --> 01:45:01,036
Don't you dare!

2060
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:02,537
I'm not going out like that.

2061
01:45:02,572 --> 01:45:03,920
No, we're going. No, no...

2062
01:45:03,955 --> 01:45:05,791
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, we're going.

2063
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:07,555
No medical treatment.
No medical treatment.

2064
01:45:07,626 --> 01:45:10,796
But, but... Mike, Mike...

2065
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,549
You gotta kill me.
You gotta kill me.

2066
01:45:13,632 --> 01:45:15,551
You gotta kill me.

2067
01:45:15,634 --> 01:45:18,888
Why? Why?

2068
01:45:18,923 --> 01:45:22,142
I fucked up.

2069
01:45:22,225 --> 01:45:23,393
Everything's shitty.

2070
01:45:23,428 --> 01:45:27,029
No, no... Mercy kill me.

2071
01:45:27,064 --> 01:45:29,900
Ah... ah, please,
mercy kill me.

2072
01:45:29,983 --> 01:45:33,071
Ah, oh, no, dude.

2073
01:45:33,154 --> 01:45:35,490
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

2074
01:45:35,525 --> 01:45:36,991
No, everything's gonna be fine.

2075
01:45:37,075 --> 01:45:38,493
Jim, shh-shh, shh-shh,
shh-shh, shh-shh.

2076
01:45:38,528 --> 01:45:39,609
Everything's gonna be fine.

2077
01:45:39,661 --> 01:45:40,877
Everything's gonna be fine.

2078
01:45:40,912 --> 01:45:43,164
Take a look at me,
you dumb fuck!

2079
01:45:43,247 --> 01:45:45,668
Everything's gonna be fine?!

2080
01:45:45,703 --> 01:45:50,471
Come on... You take my piece...

2081
01:45:50,506 --> 01:45:52,508
and you put it
to my fuckin' head...

2082
01:45:52,591 --> 01:45:55,010
and you pull the trigger.

2083
01:45:55,045 --> 01:46:00,100
You fuckin' step up...
No... and you do it.

2084
01:46:00,183 --> 01:46:01,267
No.

2085
01:46:01,351 --> 01:46:03,186
'Cause I can't.

2086
01:46:08,858 --> 01:46:10,945
Don't be a fuckin' pussy.

2087
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:13,781
Oh, my God... Don't
think about it.

2088
01:46:13,816 --> 01:46:15,175
Huh?

2089
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:16,998
Do it.

2090
01:46:17,033 --> 01:46:18,786
Please.

2091
01:46:18,869 --> 01:46:19,870
Just kill you and bail?

2092
01:46:19,954 --> 01:46:22,255
Yeah.

2093
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:23,840
Just take off.

2094
01:46:23,875 --> 01:46:27,963
And don't look back...
or you'll...

2095
01:46:28,046 --> 01:46:31,633
or you'll turn into
a pillar of salt.

2096
01:46:31,717 --> 01:46:33,969
Hey... Hey...

2097
01:46:34,052 --> 01:46:36,973
you wanted to know what it was
like to kill someone.

2098
01:46:37,008 --> 01:46:40,727
What's up, huh?

2099
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:41,978
No one's gonna know.

2100
01:46:42,061 --> 01:46:44,564
Hmm?

2101
01:46:44,647 --> 01:46:48,318
Just you... and just me.

2102
01:46:48,353 --> 01:46:50,119
And God.

2103
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,787
No fuckin' way.

2104
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,205
- Huh?

2105
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,242
You're crazy; I'm not
shootin' you, dog.

2106
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:56,493
It's mercy, dog.

2107
01:46:56,577 --> 01:46:58,662
It's mercy.

2108
01:46:58,746 --> 01:47:01,333
I deserve that.

2109
01:47:01,416 --> 01:47:03,001
I'd do it for you.

2110
01:47:04,586 --> 01:47:06,171
I'd do it for you.

2111
01:47:06,755 --> 01:47:10,008
Yeah.

Yeah, yeah... yeah...

2115
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:29,946
D-Don't, don't think about it.

2116
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:31,198
Don't think about it.

2117
01:47:33,784 --> 01:47:37,537
Yeah, yeah... Ah, yeah.

Ah... ah...

You did this to yourself,

2121
01:47:45,797 --> 01:47:47,037
You're always doing
stupid shit!

2122
01:47:47,048 --> 01:47:48,800

- Okay, okay.

2123
01:47:48,883 --> 01:47:50,123
Is that what you fuckin' want?!

2124
01:47:50,134 --> 01:47:51,220
- Yes.
- Huh?

2125
01:47:51,303 --> 01:47:52,743
You want me to fuckin'
fix your head,

2126
01:47:52,805 --> 01:47:54,306

- Come on, it's easy.

2127
01:47:54,341 --> 01:47:55,641
It's easy. No! Bullshit!

2128
01:47:55,724 --> 01:47:57,226
Bullshit! Not for me!

01:48:15,663 --> 01:48:17,748
I'm sorry.

2134
01:48:17,832 --> 01:48:19,583
- Everything's gonna be okay.

2135
01:48:19,667 --> 01:48:21,919
Yeah.
