1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,004
(ambient music)

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,949
(ambient music)

3
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,089
(slow piano music)

4
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,019
(orchestra music)

5
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,994
- [Man]
From the very beginning,
cars were designed to be

6
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,197
as powerful and
safe as possible.

7
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,400
And yet, the automobile
remains the most dangerous

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,369
vehicle on Earth.

9
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,639
With the Monolith we introduced
a whole new way of thinking.

10
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,975
A car as a completely
safe environment.

11
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,979
(guitar music)

12
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,617
Adamantine nanotech body armor,

13
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,454
ultra thin bullet proof windows.

14
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:31,424
25 different state of the
art anti-hazard sensors.

15
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,461
Our brand new
exclusive vault mode.

16
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,398
Cars are a place where
most robberies happen.

17
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,633
Where women are
subject to harassment.

18
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,902
So we decided to finally
build the Monolith,

19
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:46,773
allowing our drivers to
utterly eliminate any risk.

20
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,009
Our Monolith will feature
interactive artificial

21
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,580
intelligence, a live driving
companion and security manager.

22
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,851
Her name is Lilith, you'll
love to get to know her.

23
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,721
All these features make
Monolith quite simply

24
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,390
the safest car ever built,

25
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,260
and the safest place
for you and your family.

26
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,230
(electronic music)

27
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,053
(baby babbling)

28
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,461
- [Woman] Okay, let's find
some music for you, okay.

29
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,330
- [Car Voice] Good
evening, how can I help?

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,101
- David, look, we
have a talking car.

31
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,104
- [Car Voice] We haven't
met. My name is Lilith.

32
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,573
What would you like
me to call you?

33
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,876
- I guess just Sandra is fine.

34
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,345
- [Lilith] Justsandra, did
I pronounce that correctly.

35
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,713
(laughing)

36
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,983
- No, there's just,
my name is Sandra.

37
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,988
- [Lilith] Sandra, did I
pronounce that correctly?

38
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,724
- Yes, considering you're a car.

39
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,993
- [Lilith] Hi little
human in the backseat,

40
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,528
what's your name?.

41
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,064
- [Sandra] How do you know
there's a baby in the car?

42
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,500
- [Lilith] According to US
demographics, 30 pound person

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,735
is most usually a baby.

44
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,571
- Wow, I'm impressed.

45
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,773
That's David.

46
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,477
- [Lilith] Hello David.

47
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,947
(video game music)

48
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,016
(laughing)

49
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,320
- Hey, Lilith, do you
know how much I weigh too?

50
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,622
- [Lilith] 122.4 pounds.

51
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,458
- Okay, I got it's
that's enough.

52
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:53,399
- [Sandra] Lilith, do you
store that information

53
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,901
about the weight?

54
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,869
- [Lilith] Of course, for
safety and comfort reasons,

55
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:00,807
I customize and continuously
improve my interface.

56
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,309
- Have there ever been other
people with different weights

57
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,044
in this car?

58
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,815
- [Lilith] Displaying
latest available data.

59
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,119
- Okay, so, that must be Carl.

60
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:20,059
Then, that's T. Wayne,
and I guess his girlfriend.

61
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,331
Who's this starving bitch?

62
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,601
- [Lilith] Sandra,
I can't understand.

63
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,338
(sighing)

64
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:36,175
(car phone beeping)

65
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,711
Incoming call, Carl.

66
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,450
(car phone beeping)

67
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,593
- Look who it is.

68
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,297
- Hey buddy (laughs).

69
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,398
- Daddy.

70
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,799
- [Carl] Oh I miss you.

71
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,634
- So I called you
about a half hour ago.

72
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,436
Guess your phone was
off or something.

73
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,039
- [Carl] Yeah, my batter died.
I forgot my charger.

74
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,240
- Sandra.

75
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,175
- Shh, sweetie,
mom's on the phone.

76
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,443
- [David] Turtle.

77
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,278
- Okay, you want to
play with turtle?

78
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,214
Here's turtle.
Play with turtle, okay.

79
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,983
So how was your flight?

80
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,319
- It was alright.
A lot of turbulence.

81
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,020
They made us keep
our belts buckled

82
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,589
til we got to LA, and
there was this woman.

83
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,024
- Where are you?

84
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,128
Are staying at the hotel
near the airport again?

85
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,831
- I like planes, you're the
one that's afraid of them.

86
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,866
- You like stewardesses.

87
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:37,737
- Can we talk about the
elephant in the room here?

88
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,939
How's the new car,
do you like it?

89
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,109
- Yeah, I mean the
car is fantastic.

90
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,244
It's just I don't know,
I wasn't really expecting

91
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,080
an armored super car.

92
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,815
I feel like one of your rappers.

93
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,617
- Anything to keep
my little man safe.

94
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,920
I installed the Monolith
app on your phone.

95
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,621
It can control every
function in the car.

96
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,989
Have you tried it?

97
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,425
- I haven't really
tried it much.

98
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,994
My little co-pilot won't let me.

99
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,497
- [Carl] You really shouldn't
let him use your phone, baby.

100
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,732
(laughing)

101
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,633
- It's easy for you to
say when you're hundreds

102
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,501
of miles away.

103
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,669
(door knocking)

104
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,804
- Look, I'm really
sorry baby, I gotta go.

105
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,608
- Sorry Carl, it's just,
it just doesn't feel right.

106
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,010
You being so far
away all the time.

107
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,512
(loud knocking)

108
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,714
- [Carl] They're waiting for
me at the studio to finish the

109
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,883
mix, so I'll call you
when I get done, alright.

110
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,219
- Don't even worry about it.

111
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,821
I'll be asleep by the
time you get home.

112
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,324
- Where are you going?

113
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,159
- Your parents house.

114
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,328
- Poopy, yeah.

115
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,234
- I love you, you
know that right?

116
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,168
- I know.

117
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,840
(electronic music)

118
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,042
Please, please, baby, please.

119
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,744
Shh, it's okay, I'm almost done.

120
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,880
I know, I know.
(baby crying)

121
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,114
It's good okay.

122
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,315
- [Woman] So, you end
up going out last night.

123
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,650
- I should have not have
gone out last night.

124
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,118
- [Woman] Where
did you wonder off?

125
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,020
- [Woman] I didn't even
get that drunk though.

126
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,288
- [Woman] I can't deal with you.

127
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,723
- [Woman] Yeah, where'd you go?

128
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,426
- I hung out with that
guy I came there with,

129
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,528
what do you mean?

130
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,862
- The guy, the for the--

131
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,897
- Yeah, the guy.

132
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,964
- Did you get it done?

133
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,499
- [Woman] Yes you did.

134
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,700
- Okay, fine, wait.

135
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,968
I'll show you.

136
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,005
(laughing)

137
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,740
- What does that say,
is that his name?

138
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,974
- You guys.

139
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,709
- [Woman] Do you have any more?

140
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,178
- No, it's not his name.

141
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,446
- Do we have to check your body?

142
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,215
- No, I'm fine, it's ridiculous.

143
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,351
Let's go.
Harassment.

144
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:38,224
- God, mommy misses Venice.

145
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,327
But mommy loves her
little boy, yes she does,

146
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,229
yes she does.

147
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,800
Okay, sweetie, this is the last
time before grandmas, okay.

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,268
Come on, one, two, three.

149
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,102
(inhaler blowing)

150
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,070
Oh.

151
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,506
(pop music)

152
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,050
(child babbling)

153
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,719
Uh, see what you want.

154
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,588
- It's my marble.

155
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,555
- What?

156
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,157
- It's my marbles.

157
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,358
- You want the marbles?

158
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,194
They're kind of
dangerous, sweetie.

159
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,429
Yeah.

160
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,730
- Yes.

161
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,664
- Okay.

162
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,301
What do you say?

163
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,436
- Thank you.

164
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,571
- Thank you, yes.

165
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,006
Thank you, momma.

166
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,809
Who am I?

167
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,743
- Sandra.

168
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,579
I want this.

169
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,748
- This?

170
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:36,682
- Yes.

171
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,552
- Okay, cute, let's go.

172
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,653
Hi.

173
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,654
- Hey, how you doing?

174
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,023
Good, just these, and this.

175
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,527
- Your autograph.

176
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,682
- Thank you so much.

177
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,550
- You're welcome.

178
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,551
- Hey, babe, let's go.

179
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,552
- Hey.

180
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,486
- Hi.

181
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,955
- My friend says she knows you.

182
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,224
- I really don't think so.

183
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,093
- You from LA?

184
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,028
- I was.

185
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,597
Now, I live here.

186
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,800
Why am I even telling you this.

187
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,036
- I knew I recognized you.

188
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,737
Your hair looks different.

189
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,806
You're a singer.

190
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,342
- I was a singer, yes.

191
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,044
- Hipstars, right?

192
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,079
- You got me.

193
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,314
- No way.

194
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,782
How's that song go,
the bicycle song?

195
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,883
- Oh, please don't.

196
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,952
- Hipstars, sing with me.

197
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,887
On a bicycle made for two.

198
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,422
- Okay, okay.

199
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,224
- You know what, you should
come party with us tonight.

200
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,926
Amazing place.

201
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,027
Airport One.

202
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,332
What's wrong, are you
here with someone?

203
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,666
- Yeah, my man.

204
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,102
- Uh hmm.

205
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,572
- In the bear suit.

206
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,441
That's my little man.

207
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,542
- You have a kid?

208
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,776
- Uh hmm.

209
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,546
- So he's the one who
shut down Hipstars huh?

210
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,647
- No, I did.

211
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,384
(door bell ringing)

212
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,386
- Guess that's it then.

213
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,889
Later, Hipstars.

214
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:25,925
- Bye.

215
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,801
Alright, David, let's go.

216
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,004
David?

217
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,075
David?

218
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,480
Have you seen my son.

219
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,914
- No, I haven't.

220
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,617
- David?

221
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,389
David?
(dramatic ambient music)

222
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,556
David, David?

223
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,429
Oh boy, David?

224
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,967
David, are you in here?

225
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,140
David, David, stop.

226
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,381
David, David?

227
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,788
(dramatic ambient music)

228
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,955
David, David.

229
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,024
Oh, sweetie.

230
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,027
- There she is,
there's mom (laughs).

231
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,395
- [Sandra] Hi, sweetie.

232
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,098
- [Woman] You have
got such a cute kid.

233
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,133
- Come here, come here.

234
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,074
Hey, sweetie, you
can't run off, okay.

235
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,042
What did mommy tell you?

236
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,711
You can't go anywhere
like that, okay.

237
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,446
- He's okay, he's a
tough little buddy.

238
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,815
- You guys heard me
screaming, why didn't you

239
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,349
say something?

240
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,684
- Relax, nothing happened
to your child, thanks to us.

241
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,119
- Yeah, you're welcome.

242
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,822
- God, you guys saw me
freaking out.
Are you stupid?

243
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,390
- Yeah, you're welcome.

244
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,025
- Are you freaking stupid,
leaving your child?

245
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,326
- What is she doing?

246
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,729
- He's apparently hating
where you're taking him.

247
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,963
- [Woman] Bye, mommy.

248
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,999
- Have a great day,
dealing with your child.

249
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,601
You should have been
riled up when your child

250
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,470
was running off.

251
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,238
Unfit mother.

252
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,406
(laughing)

253
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,475
(crying)

254
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,143
- David, shut up.

255
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,846
(crying)

256
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,114
It's okay.

257
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,548
- Hey, Hipstar.

258
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,155
- [Woman] She didn't
even say thank you.

259
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,890
- [Man] Hey, Hipstar.

260
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,192
- Got to be fucking kidding me.

261
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,394
- [Lilith] All secure.
Welcome back, Sandra.

262
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,329
David.

263
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,400
(thugs babbling)

264
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,905
(engine revving)

265
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,909
- Hey, that ain't cool.

266
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,812
- [Woman] Run.

267
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,782
Hipstar sucks.

268
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,484
- What the fuck is Hipstar?

269
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,952
You guys are insane.

270
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,621
What is that?

271
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,357
- [Lilith] Would you
like me to drive, Sandra?

272
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,291
- No.

273
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,531
(electronic music)

274
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,340
We were number four on the
top 100, you know that?

275
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,277
We got lots of radio play.

276
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,312
Your mom was good.

277
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:38,083
Yeah, even though she had to
do all those silly dance moves.

278
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,685
Yeah.

279
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,720
That wasn't bad at all.

280
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,358
Thanks to that song,
I met your dad.

281
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,562
He had another wife,
but he chose me.

282
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,531
I don't regret a thing.

283
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,368
(electronic music)

284
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,480
â™Ş Love's in the air, oh oh oh â™Ş

285
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,020
â™Ş Love's in the air, yeah ah â™Ş

286
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,728
â™Ş Cold in the winter,
sunny on the inside â™Ş

287
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,863
(laughing)

288
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,031
What are you laughing at?

289
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,540
Lilith, call Jessa.

290
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,243
(phone ringing)

291
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,177
Hey, stranger.

292
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,346
- I don't believe it.

293
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,881
What on Earth?

294
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,717
- Oh cut it out, you know
what my life is like now.

295
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,318
Oh, actually you don't but.

296
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,020
- [Jessa] Yeah, sorry.

297
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,255
- Hey, guess what?

298
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,856
I just met these kids
in the middle of nowhere

299
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,258
who remember us.

300
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,959
It brought back some memories.

301
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,961
- Are you having
second thoughts?

302
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,730
- No, don't worry.

303
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,566
So how's the record
coming along?

304
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,636
- [Jessa] Amazing, actually.

305
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,371
Carl saved our asses.

306
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,538
- Carl?

307
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,773
- Don't sweat it.

308
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,308
He just gave us the
name of a guy who does

309
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,210
the arrangements,
fucking genius.

310
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,012
I couldn't even believe it.

311
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,480
I'll have to figure
out a way to thank

312
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,983
your husband properly (laughs).

313
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,919
What are you doing?

314
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,421
- Jesus, Jess,
my son is in the car.

315
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,522
- Oh my god.

316
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,260
Sorry, someone here has
some unfinished business.

317
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,162
Jesus, stop it.

318
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:34,033
- [Lilith] You have
reached your destination.

319
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,379
- [Jessa] Are you there.

320
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,314
- Yeah.

321
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,352
Hey, how much do you weigh?

322
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,354
- What kind of a
question is that?

323
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,556
- No thanks, sorry,
I was just kidding.

324
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,826
So, who's gonna do lead vocals?

325
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,194
- Who do you think?

326
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,663
Moi.
I mean someone
had to replace you

327
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,867
and it's better me than
some random chick, right?

328
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,937
- Where are you?

329
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,272
- Why?

330
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,840
- Who are you with?

331
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,442
- Why do you care?

332
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,444
- Is it Carl?

333
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,714
- Are you out of your mind?

334
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,682
- Answer me, Jessa, is it Carl?

335
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,752
- No, it's not
fucking Carl, Jesus.

336
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,854
- I know you Jessa,
I know how you are.

337
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:33,592
You think you can just steal
my life just like that.

338
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,294
- Look, I have to go.

339
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,930
And for the record, I'm not
the one screwing your husband.

340
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,431
- What do you mean?

341
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,200
What the fuck do
you mean, Jessa?

342
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,068
Who's screwing Carl?

343
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,236
Jessa, bitch.

344
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,280
(phone busy signal ringing)

345
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,324
(phone ringing)

346
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,268
- [Carl] Hi, you've
reached Carl Jenkins.

347
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,738
- Fuck, David,
stop, David, stop.

348
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,206
- [Carl] I'm locked
in the studio.

349
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,142
I'll call you back,
just leave a message.

350
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,543
(crying)

351
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,980
- Okay, sweetheart,
everything's fine.

352
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,250
Sorry, fucking marbles,
I wasn't thinking.

353
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,751
(crying)

354
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,521
Okay (exhales).

355
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,800
- [Lilith]
New destination set.

356
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:53,605
Calculating route
for new destination.

357
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,475
(engine revving)

358
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,083
- Daddy.

359
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,685
- Okay, let's try daddy again.

360
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,525
(phone ringing)

361
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,461
Pick up for fuck sake.

362
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,333
- [David] Daddy.

363
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,001
- I get it.

364
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,603
- [Carl] Hi, you've
reached Carl Jenkins.

365
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,105
- Okay, there's no daddy.

366
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,539
- [Carl] I just purposely sent
your call to your voicemail.

367
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,540
Just kidding.

368
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,708
- Play with turtle, okay.

369
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,376
- [Carl] I'm locked
in the studio.

370
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,911
I'll call you back,
leave a message.

371
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,113
- Hang in there, sweetie.

372
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,882
Daddy's gonna be really
surprised to see us.

373
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,918
(soft piano music)

374
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,458
- [Lilith] There's an
accident on the freeway.

375
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,460
Delays to be expected.

376
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,996
- No, no, no. I don't want
to get stuck on the freeway.

377
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,865
- [Lilith] Would you like
to change the itinerary?

378
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,034
- Let's just take
the quickest route.

379
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,308
- [Lilith] Left turn,
1,000 feet.

380
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,579
(soft piano music)

381
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,399
- [Sandra] Are you sure
that's the right road?

382
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,001
- [Lilith] This is the
shortest route to avoid

383
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,235
traffic jam.

384
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,372
We will resume the
freeway in 50 miles.

385
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,608
Relax and enjoy the view.

386
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,314
(electronic music)

387
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,519
Don't forget Sandra, I can
drive when you are tired.

388
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,223
- [Sandra] Lilith, thank you,
but I think I can do this

389
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,157
on my own.

390
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,998
(soft piano music)

391
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,943
(engine revving)

392
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,249
Oh, finally a sign of life.

393
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:20,519
Maybe we can stop
and get some drinks.

394
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,193
(sighing)

395
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,127
Never mind.

396
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,676
(loud howling)

397
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,515
(rock music)

398
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,375
Sorry sweetie, mommy's
just really nervous.

399
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,283
(car beeping)

400
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,853
What is going on?

401
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,655
- [Lilith] Warning,
smoke detected.

402
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,990
Park safely, and
please evacuate.

403
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,924
- Fuck.

404
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,862
Gotta be kidding me.

405
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,064
- [Lilith] Warning,
smoke detected.

406
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,533
- Yeah, because I'm smoking.

407
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,136
Can you make the noise stop?

408
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,672
- [Lilith] Sandra,
I can't understand.

409
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,607
- Turn off that noise.

410
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,144
- [Lilith] Do you want
to switch to full manual?

411
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,712
- Yes.

412
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,981
- [Lilith] This will turn
off all assisted features.

413
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,482
Do you wish to continue?

414
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,752
- It's just a stupid cigarette
and I opened the window.

415
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,388
- [Lilith] Sandra,
I can't under...

416
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,758
(car computer beeping)

417
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,599
(coughing)

418
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,534
- Shit.

419
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,170
Happy now, Lilith?

420
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,874
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

421
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:26,144
Mommy knows it's bad to smoke.

422
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,980
Today, she just
really needed it.

423
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,587
I'll never do it again, okay.

424
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,155
(loud banging)

425
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,192
(tires screeching)

426
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,864
(crickets chirping)

427
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,768
(animal moaning)

428
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,410
Are you okay?
Are you hurt, are you hurt?

429
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,580
Okay good (gasping).

430
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,651
Come on, no, sweetie, okay.

431
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:07,853
You want turtle?

432
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,687
- Yeah.

433
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:09,921
- Where is it?

434
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,825
I'll get it for you.
(child crying)

435
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:17,429
Oh please don't cry
baby, please, don't
cry, please, please.

436
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,797
Okay, it's okay.

437
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:22,167
Here look, look
it's turtle, okay.

438
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,136
Play with turtle.

439
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,972
(animal moaning)

440
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,709
Okay.

441
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,748
I'm gonna go check outside
okay, just give me a minute.

442
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,517
And then we'll get going.

443
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,785
Okay, alright.

444
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,322
(door beeping)

445
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,793
(child crying)

446
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,197
(animal moaning)

447
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,300
Holy shit, oh my god.

448
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,707
(child crying)

449
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,225
Don't be scared,
baby, mommy's here.

450
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,230
Just play with turtle, okay.

451
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,412
Give me a break.
(door shutting)

452
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:11,009
(suspenseful ambient music)

453
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,962
(doors locking)

454
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,468
(suspenseful music)

455
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,136
No, no, no, no, no.

456
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,875
Ah, ah.

457
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,745
(window closing)

458
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,883
Oh god, no, no.

459
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,120
No.

460
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,524
No, no.

461
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,127
David.

462
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,100
What did you do?

463
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,736
What did you touch,
what did you push?

464
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,505
Don't, don't, don't.

465
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,976
Be a good boy.

466
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,578
Show me the phone.

467
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,882
Good boy, good boy.

468
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,752
I'm very proud of you.

469
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,823
Sweetie, you just have to
listen to what I say, okay.

470
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:35,427
Take your finger and
do this on the phone.

471
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,030
Go like this on the phone.

472
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,535
No, like the other,
like this, like this.

473
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:50,175
David, put your finger on
the phone, and do this.

474
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,610
Like, like this.

475
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,547
Like this, no, like.

476
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,651
David, no watch me, like this.

477
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,622
Put your finger on
the phone and do this.

478
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,256
No, David, look at me.

479
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:09,694
David, look at me, watch.
Like this, like that.

480
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:10,662
Look at me.

481
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,604
David, do this with
your finger now.

482
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,274
No, David, what, what.

483
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,614
Oh my god, no.
(dramatic electronic music)

484
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,283
(loud gasping)

485
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,391
Oh my god.

486
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,325
Help!

487
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:42,560
Help!

488
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,298
Somebody help, please.

489
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:56,174
(suspenseful ambient music)

490
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,416
Hey, Lilith, it's Sandra,
can you hear me?

491
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,890
Lilith, I'm locked out.

492
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,726
My baby is locked
inside the car.

493
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,663
Lilith, it's an emergency.

494
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,801
It's an emergency.

495
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,704
You stupid fucking car.

496
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,075
Lilith, open the doors.

497
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,912
Unlock the doors.

498
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,080
Do something.

499
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,818
Uh.
(loud slapping)

500
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,320
Stay calm, you're just a car.

501
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,194
Uh.
(loud smacking)

502
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,031
(wincing)

503
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,872
(sighing)

504
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,910
(animals howling)

505
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,180
(grunting)

506
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,419
(heavy breathing)

507
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:54,993
(car alarm ringing)
(child crying)

508
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:03,067
(loud grunting)
(alarm ringing)

509
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,236

510
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,745

511
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,849
(child crying)

512
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,319
Fuck, Carl.

513
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:26,958
Fuck you.

514
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,695
(alarm ringing)

515
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,901
I have to go look for help.

516
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,138
Mommy will be right back.

517
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,544
(heavy breathing)

518
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,383
(crying)

519
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,058
Peek-a-boo.

520
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,066
Peek-a-boo.

521
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,368
(laughing)

522
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,271
(piano music)

523
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,305
Peek-a-boo.

524
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:20,678
I know you've never
been left alone before.

525
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:24,449
I'm gonna get help and
I'll be back so soon.

526
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,218
I'm gonna get you out of there.

527
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,487
This whole thing will be
over before you know it.

528
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,422
Okay.

529
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,525
(sniffing)

530
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,496
(soft piano music)

531
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,553
Is something there?

532
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:11,095
(ambient music)

533
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,733
Help.

534
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,904
Help.

535
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,007
Hello?

536
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,248
Help.
(gate rattling)

537
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,450
Hello.

538
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,322
(chain rattling)

539
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,256
Hello.

00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,735
(chain rattling)

541
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,384
Ouh.

542
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,188
(grunting)

543
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,122
Ah.

544
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,291
Uh.

545
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,226
Shit.

546
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,264
(door opening)

547
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,745
(phone ringing)

548
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,912
Hello, hello?

551
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,155
Welcome to customer assistance.

552
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,423
Hi, thank god.

553
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,194
I had an accident and my
son is locked in the car.

554
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,396
I need help.

555
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,431
- [Woman] All of our
offices are closed until

556
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,732
Tuesday, July 5th.

557
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,434
From all of us at AEP....

558
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,435
- No, what?

559
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,937
- [Woman]
...happy Independence Day.

560
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:03,341
Hello, you've reached--
Hello, you've reached--

561
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,342
- No, no.

562
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,343
Fuck.

563
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,578
(loud smacking)

564
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,448
(heavy breathing)

565
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,065
Ugh.

566
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,372
(grunting)

567
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,265
(suspenseful ambient music)

568
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,140
(animal growling)

569
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:31,162
(crickets chirping)
(ambient music)

570
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,096
- Sandra.

571
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,914
Sandra.

572
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,154
- David, it's okay.

573
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,324
(heavy breathing)

574
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:21,012
(dog barking)
(suspenseful ambient music)

575
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,754
(Sandra yelling)

576
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,559
(alarm ringing)

577
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,215
David, just stay calm, please.

578
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,583
David, breathe.

579
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,755
You can breathe on your own.

580
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,299
Mommy just worries too much.

581
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,436
Even the doctor says so.

582
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,140
Show me how good you
can breathe on your own.

583
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,079
(crying)

584
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,693
(ambient music)

585
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,532
Sleep well, baby, it'll
all be over tomorrow.

586
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:20,498
(wind blowing)
(dramatic piano music)

587
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,575
Stay calm, stay calm.

588
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,445
It's all gonna be okay.

589
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,882
Carl's gonna come find us.

590
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:15,319
I mean, he must have
called home by now.

591
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,423
Although I did tell him not to.

592
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,831
He'll call anyway.

593
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,435
He'll be worried about us and
he'll come looking for us.

594
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,037
I mean, he has to.

595
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,610
Or maybe he won't.

596
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,716
This might be the perfect
way to get rid of us.

597
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,000
David, look.

598
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,270
It's a shooting star.

599
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,242
I wish.

600
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:16,680
Oh.

601
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,716
It's just a plane.

602
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,484
(laughing)

603
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,919
Of course it is.

604
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,260
Airport One.

605
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,974
Oh my god, there's
an airport nearby.

606
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:44,909
David.

607
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:46,911
David.

608
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,148
David?

609
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,824
David, David.

610
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,665
David, where are you?

611
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,501
David?

612
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:14,772
David?

613
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,441
David, where are you?

614
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,429
David.

615
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,634
Sweetie, hi sweetheart.

616
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,737
David, it's okay,
everything's okay.

617
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,880
David, unzip your
suit, can you do that?

618
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,182
Can you unzip your
suit a little bit.

619
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,952
Sweetie, your bear suit,
try to unzip, please.

620
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,988
Just try, David.

621
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,091
It's okay, it's okay,
everything's okay.

622
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,692
I fucked up again.

623
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,329
Mommy has a gift for fucking up.

624
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,466
But I know what
I'm gonna do now.

625
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,535
There's an airport
nearby and I'm sure

626
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,537
there's someone there
that can help us.

627
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,971
Okay.

628
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,541
(heavy breathing)

629
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,475
Oh god.

630
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,019
Okay.

631
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,588
Okay.

632
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,457
Let's get you some shade, okay.

633
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,464
Okay, sweetie, mommy has
to go now, but I'm gonna

634
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,266
come back with some help.

635
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,267
- Don't go.

636
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,070
Don't go.

637
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,104
- Sweetie.

638
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,973
- I'll get the phone.

639
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,411
I get the phone.

640
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,580
- There's no use,
just stay still, please.

641
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,181
- I get the phone.

642
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,588
- I know you're scared
in there all alone.

643
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,891
(crying)

644
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:20,764
I know it's tough but
you've got to be a big boy.

645
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,868
You've got to be brave,
you've got to be strong.

646
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,571
(child crying)

647
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:39,249
(dramatic synthesizer music)

648
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,867
Oh god.

649
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:34,538
You're gonna have a story to
tell when all this is done.

650
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,541
All your friends when you
go to kindergarten are gonna

651
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:41,812
think you're so cool 'cause you
spent a night in the desert.

652
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,615
Oh my god.

653
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:48,652
I need water.

654
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:50,988
Okay.

655
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,731
If I'd been a fucking girl
scout, I'd know how to get

656
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,499
water in the desert.

657
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:09,139
When you're older, I'm gonna
make sure you go to boy scouts.

658
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,746
When you're old enough.

659
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,718
When you're old enough.

660
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,923
(heavy breathing)

661
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,638
(ambient music)

662
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,573
Water.

663
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:46,443

My love.

717
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,494
- [Carl] We shouldn't
have come here.

718
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,263
- It was a mistake.

719
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,698
- [Carl] Get up.

720
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:02,632
- No, no.

721
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:12,241
- You know what happened,
and you know when.

722
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:25,021
- I was just trying
to keep him safe.

723
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,528
Just wanted to stay calm.

724
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:37,066
- You know why he's gone?

725
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,443
- I just wanted a cigarette.

726
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:51,047
I was going crazy that
day because of you.

727
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,521
This is all your fault.

728
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,061
- Really, Sandra?

729
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:07,830
My fault.

730
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,900
You know what happened here.

731
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,569
And if there's anyone to blame,

732
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:16,239
it's you.

733
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,344

734
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,612
- Yes you did.

735
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,415
- It isn't my fault.

736
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,718
I didn't want this.

737
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:32,555
- This is all your fault,
you took my boy.

738
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:33,923
You killed him.

739
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,793
- I didn't want this,
no, I didn't want this.

740
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:37,727
- Say it.

I wanted you so badly.

749
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:55,438
It's not your fault I
messed everything up.

750
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,374
I'm going to hell,
but you're not.

751
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,377
You're an angel.

752
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:07,583
Mommy's here, like when
you were in my belly.

753
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,657
You couldn't see me,
but I was there.

755

You have every right
not to call me mommy.

772
