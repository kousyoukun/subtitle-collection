00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,613
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

2
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,614
<i>A construction foreman in Griffith Park heard the crash.</i>

3
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,847
Hey!

4
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,855
<i>He saw a cyclist cartwheel off his bike</i>

5
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,191
<i>and slam face-first into the unforgiving asphalt of Riverside Drive.</i>

6
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,694
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

7
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,665
<i>As we begin our descent into Los Angeles,</i>

8
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,898
<i>we ask that you please be sure that your seatbelts are fastened...</i>

9
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,702
<i>A 911 call brought out the troops from Fire Station 76.</i>

10
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,977
- What happened? - You had an accident.

11
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,842
- Do you know what happened? - No shit, I had an accident. What?

12
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,385
<i>I don't remember any of this, nor do I recall the cause of the spill.</i>

13
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,545
- Our batteries are off. - I've been in here six hours now, and...

14
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,089
Listen to me. Wait a minute. We're ready to go...

15
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,681
Hypochondriac.

16
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,288
OR 2.

17
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,289
<i>County-USC was the closest emergency room,</i>

18
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,355
<i>and I quickly realized</i>

19
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,695
<i>that if you find yourself there</i>

20
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,067
<i>with nothing more than a bump on the head,</i>

21
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,411
<i>you are one lucky Angeleno.</i>

22
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,249
Wow.

23
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,693
Ready.

24
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,363
I'm not entirely comfortable with this.

25
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,751
Thank you.

26
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,291
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

27
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,693
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

28
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,037
Okay.

29
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,142
Really?

30
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,418
<i>Doctors told me to expect up to four weeks of disorientation.</i>

31
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,813
Christ. All right.

32
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,952
<i>I'm not asking for sympathy. I just want you to know, I just...</i>

33
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,257
<i>I'm not asking for sympathy.</i>

34
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,127
I just want you to understand what's going on

35
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,689
if I start writing about what a bang-up job

36
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,167
Governor Schwarzenegger's doing.

37
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:07,263
S-C-H-W-A-R-Z... Scratch that.

38
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,835
Pass¨¦. Lacks context.

39
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,654
<i>Right. So the question is...</i>

40
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,958
Hey, Tommy.

41
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,499
Theoretically could I, seeing as how the Governor has retired

42
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,627
his position at the muscle magazine, could I interview him?

43
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,868
Right. And will my non-Teutonic lineage be an issue?

44
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:47,339
See, no, that's... That's... It gets to be funny. It's just an article.

45
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,745
Do I need to have been on steroids for a long time to even apply?

46
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,113
Good.

47
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,886
Gail, I like the "attention must be paid" reference.

48
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,116
I might move it down a paragraph, though.

49
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,092
Thanks. I'm getting you a new desk.

50
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,619
Good morning, gentlemen.

51
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,900
- Thanks. - Hey, guys. Check it out.

52
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,164
I got a study here that says the number of Americans under 35

53
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,639
who read a newspaper is now down to 40./...

54
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,868
- Forty? - Forty.

55
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,070
And the group we're losing mostly are college-educated women.

56
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,635
- Pull my finger. - Jesus Christ.

57
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,044
Hey, honey.

58
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,480
"Welcome back, Steve." That would have been nice.

59
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,915
Thank you. You know, when Lopez and I started out together...

60
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,078
You had to walk 20 miles to school in the snow with no shoes?

61
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,485
...people cared about what went on in the world.

62
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,352
- Am I right, Steve? I mean, Christ. - Back when people cared.

63
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,187
We're at war, and the only thing that sells papers

64
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,624
is a Lindsay Lohan cooch shot.

65
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,093
Jesus, did someone actually run that in print?

66
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,891
- I thought that was just on the Web. - All right, all right.

67
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,226
- All I am saying is... - I didn't see that.

68
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,562
...that if you run an excellent, if I do say so myself,

69
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,866
front-page piece about how corporate America is profiting from this war,

70
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,600
and the only reader response you get is on two hands...

71
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,834
- Meanwhile... - That was a good piece, by the way.

72
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,933
- Fine. Thanks. You read it? - I read that.

73
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,910
- Did you really? - I didn't read it, but I loved it, Curt.

74
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,743
Meanwhile, Lopez here scrapes his forehead,

75
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,511
and gets, what, I'm guessing about 75 e-mails

76
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,608
from readers worried about his safety?

77
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,882
- I chased this piece. - Then I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

78
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:06,118
There is something very wrong in this world.

79
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,921
Newsflash, something wrong with the world.

80
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,518
Yeah. Your face hurts my feelings, Steve.

81
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,619
That's harassment.

82
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,357
- Mary? - An environmental group studying...

83
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,490
- Please. ...chemical contaminants

84
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,658
- in people's bodies. - I literally... No.

85
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,702
- Give some blood and write about it. - Let me check my e-mails.

86
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,202
I think it would be a good idea for you.

87
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,863
I'm glad you feel that way. I just did that.

88
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,997
What do you think?

89
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,700
The thought in my mind is, "No, thank you."

90
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,369
It was funny. People love it when you bleed.

91
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,605
- Readers. - Busted.

92
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,169
What is that? What do you call that, what you just did?

93
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,839
- Transference. - Freud.

94
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,415
Freud. Thank you. No.

95
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,712
Sorry about the face.

96
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,345
- I hate needles. - So use it.

97
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,221
<i>Originally used as a camp by settlers</i>

98
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,023
<i>outside of what was then the village of Los Angeles,</i>

99
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:47,327
<i>it was called La Plaza Abaja, or the Lower Plaza.</i>

100
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,455
Stevie Wonder fan?

101
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,359
<i>My Cherie Amour is the song of my life.</i>

102
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,452
<i>Signed, Sealed, Delivered.</i>

103
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,054
But you really shouldn't write on a violin like that

104
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,565
because you have to treat a violin like a child, you have to protect it.

105
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,761
You only got two strings.

106
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,098
All I want to do is play music, and here's the problem

107
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,332
that I'm having right here.

108
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,501
This one's gone, this one's gone, this little one's out of commission.

109
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,545
But you get that in Cleveland public schools.

110
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,840
A lot of military statues in Cleveland.

111
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,643
- A very military-oriented city. - Is that where you're from?

112
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,410
You're not gonna get musicians on parade there.

113
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,078
You got Severance Hall there. You have The Music Settlement.

114
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,142
Ohio State University.

115
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,554
<i>Whereas in Los Angeles, you have Los Angeles PD, you have LA Times,</i>

116
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,057
you have Los Angeles Lakers.

117
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,924
Those are armies, too. Military regimentation, experimentation,

118
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,327
Roman gable, Roman Catholicism, Colonel Sanders,

119
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,490
- but this guy right here is... - Colonel Sanders.

120
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,692
...the quarterback with the orchestra.

121
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,530
Now the cello could back this guy with the same moves,

122
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,933
but the cello can't be concert master.

123
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,564
No. He leads out, this was Itzhak Perlman, Jascha Heifetz.

124
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,471
You can't play music in the winter in Cleveland

125
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,531
because of the ice and the snow.

126
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,601
That's why I prefer Los Angeles to Beethoven City,

127
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,271
because it never rains in Southern California,

128
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,542
and if it does, all I have to do is just go in the tunnel,

129
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,947
I could play to my heart's content.

130
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,783
I'm flabbergasted about the statue. Aren't you flabbergasted about this?

131
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,923
- Anyway, nice to meet you. - Do you have any idea how it got here?

132
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,186
- No. - Maybe they dropped it off late at night.

133
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,354
'Cause it's just astonishing to sit here for hours and just... Just gaze at it.

134
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,125
- It... It just blows me away. - No idea.

135
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,460
It really blows me away

136
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:04,594
that someone as great as Beethoven was the leader of Los Angeles.

137
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,368
Yeah.

138
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,572
<i>I'm Steve Lopez, LA Times.</i>

139
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,113
- Lopez, L-O-P-E-Z? - Yeah.

140
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,843
<i>Lopez, Los Angeles Times. Mr. Lopez.</i>

142
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,651
Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Junior.

143

A-Y-E-R-S J-U-N-l-O-R.

145
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,153
Or J-R-period.

146
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,426
I apologize for my appearance. I've had a few setbacks.

147
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,769
Me, too.

148
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,142
Who are Nancy, Paul, and Craig?

149
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,976
Those were my classmates at Juilliard.

150
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,948
<i>Good afternoon, Juilliard School.</i>

151
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,112
Registrar's office, please.

152
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,892
What's up?

153
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,395
It's highly classified. I can't tell you.

154
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,264
- How many? - More than we can afford to lose.

155
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,997
Evidently, it goes like this.

156
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,130
Stock price sinks, we lose reporters.

157
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,003
Stock price sinks more, we lose more reporters.

158
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,235
That won't produce more or less...

159
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,641
<i>Hi, this is Steve Lopez from the LA Times. I'm calling to enquire</i>

160
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,613
as to whether a Nathaniel Anthony Ayers attended your school.

161
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,616
A-Y-E-R-S. I'm sorry.

162
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,019
Freaking child lock.

163
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,355
- How is our son, by the way? - He's good.

164
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,224
He likes his classes. He likes his pre-gay roommate.

165
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,626
You should call him.

166
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,028
- I call him. - Is a lie.

167
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,656
I call him. He doesn't call me back.

168
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,030
- He calls me back. - Mary...

169
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,467
- Just try again. - Yes, Mary.

170
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,595
- Yes, Mary. - Yes. Yes, Steve.

171
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,502
- I gotta take this call. - Great.

172
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,837
- Because I don't have a story. Hello? - Call him.

173
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,536
<i>I'm sorry, we have no record</i>

174
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,135
<i>of a Nathaniel Anthony Ayers ever attending Juilliard.</i>

175
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,578
Really?

176
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,150
But then I don't have a story.

177
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,786
Thanks for checking.

178
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,388
I'm not doing the blood thing.

179
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,694
I got too many other good ideas.

180
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:22,301
My dad is gonna freak when he finds out I met you.

181
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,308
He loves your column.

182
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,003
What about you?

183
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,440
- Well, I don't really read the newspaper. - Sure.

184
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,542
But when I do...

185
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,986
Hey! Those aren't all for me, are they?

186
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,425
I'm also going to need a clump of hair and some urine.

187
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,019
That's easy.

188
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,694
- All right. - Okay.

189
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,191
Make a fist for me.

190
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,638
Come on.

191
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,243
Crap.

192
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,951
<i>- Lopez. - Mr. Lopez?</i>

193
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,420
Yeah, can you just hold on one second?

194
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,184
I'm having a little technical difficulty here.

195
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,386
<i>This is Rosie Delgado from the Juilliard School.</i>

196
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,952

197
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,827
Yes. Please continue.

198

<i>After we spoke yesterday, I realized I only checked our graduates.</i>

199
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,699
<i>So I looked in our matriculates, and there he was.</i>

200
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,208
<i>Nathaniel Anthony Ayers enrolled in 1970</i>

201
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,734
<i>and he dropped out toward the end of his second year.</i>

202
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,871
Thank you.

203
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:40,683
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez. Nathaniel was shy in our first encounter.</i>

204
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,244
<i>He stepped back... He backed away.</i>

205
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,791
<i>He... Nathaniel is... Is what?</i>

206
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,455
<i>Nathaniel is... A great column is what Nathaniel is.</i>

<i>Nathaniel is missing.</i>

208
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,921
Son of a bitch.

209
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,119
- Raccoons. - Oh, yeah?

210
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,458
- That's the culprit. - Oh, boy.

211
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,830
What are they doing? They eat the grass?

212
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,628
No, they eat the worms in the grass.

213
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,998
They eat the worms in the grass?

214
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,537
Yeah, we had them. It's a God-awful mess.

215
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,630
- Wanna know how I got rid of them? - Yes.

216
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,402
Coyote urine.

217
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,434
- Wow. Coyote urine? - Seriously. In powdered form.

218
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,810
- Remarkable. - It's a whole industry, you know.

219
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,906
Funny.

220
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,451
- Hey, I'm Neil, by the way. - Okay.

221
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:01,760
<i>Anxiety, restlessness, euphoria. If you're experiencing...</i>

<i>I would spend every night tossing and turning...</i>

223
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,159
<i>Wow. Okay, and what is the proper method of application?</i>

224
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,428
<i>Should I sprinkle it in the yard?</i>

225
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,335
<i>First, you wanna dilute the urine powder in water.</i>

226
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,670
<i>- Wait, I want to? - Well, maybe I should say "have to."</i>

227
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:21,042
<i>And then you're gonna have to hang the liquid from trees in plastic bags.</i>

228
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,479
<i>So, people are doing this all over Southern California?</i>

229
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,609
<i>Oh, yes, sir. Last month, I sold some to Paula Abdul.</i>

230
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,849
But no Simon Cowell? 'Cause that would be exciting. Figure?

231
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,060
I'm gonna call you back a little later.

232
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,470
Hey.

233
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,476
Hey, Nathaniel.

234
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,075
Remember me?

235
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,482
Sorry.

236
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,154
Maybe have a minute when you're done?

237
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,932
Let me know.

238
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,797
I just saw you, so I...

239
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,596
Nothing.

240
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,010
<i>Mr. Steve Lopez, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California.</i>

241
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,414
Hey, Nathaniel.

242
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,610
I've been searching for Mr. Beethoven,

243
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:07,709
but he's slipping away like a dream.

244
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,947
I'm trying to get back into shape, but I don't have any sheet music.

245
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,354
<i>Beethoven's String Quartet, Opus 59, Number 1,</i>

246
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,688
<i>Violin Concerto, Opus 61 in D,</i>

247
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,354
<i>Fifth Concerto, Opus 73 in E Flat, red car, green car,</i>

248
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,489
there goes a police car, and God is right on the other side of that wall.

249
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,160
I had to dig a hole to bury some human defecation.

250
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,293
But they didn't have the human decency...

251
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,393
I was looking for you.

252
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,371
...to use the proper facilities. - I noticed that you've moved.

253
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,134
Well, it's beautiful here, because you can play music

254
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,903
and have pigeons clapping as they take off,

255
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,807
and right there is The Los Angeles Times Building.

256
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,812
- Right, that's where I work. - Mr. Steve Lopez, staff writer.

257
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,869
New York, Cleveland, it doesn't matter.

258
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,972
All I have to do is look up at that building

259
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,038
and I know exactly where I am.

260
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,141
I was thinking about...

261
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,412
I'm in Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California,

262
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,544
- Los Angeles Lakers. ...writing about you

263
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,609
for the paper.

264
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,814
Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson Theaters.

265
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,323
Magic Johnson is a basketball player, but he's also a big, black man.

266
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,484
What if I were to wanna write a story about you for the newspaper?

267
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,892
<i>Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles newspaper.</i>

268
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,955
- Staff writer, Mr. Steve Lopez. - Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

269
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,968
Do you mind if I record this? And I wanna write a story about you.

270
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,129
A column about how a guy like you winds up on the street.

271
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,399
- What do you think of that? - Mr. Lopez needs to do

272
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,599
what Mr. Lopez needs to do.

273
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,733
No one could ever stop Mr. Lopez from doing what he wants to do.

274
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,937
Are you flying that plane?

275
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,614
No. No, I'm right here.

276
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,040
I don't know how God works.

277
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,143
I called Juilliard, and they said you went there, but you didn't finish.

278
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,154
I bombed right out of there. I bombed out of Juilliard.

279
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,849
- Yeah, what happened? - I just... It didn't happen.

280
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,893
I don't know. I don't know what happened.

281
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,951
Anyone I could contact? Family?

282
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,259
Family? Miss Floria Ayers, my mom.

283
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,925
She's a beautician. Beauty is art. Music is beauty.

284
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,969
I don't do hair. I do my own hair,

285
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,561
but obviously, my mom does everybody's hair in the community.

286
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,166
They would come for her. She's quite a woman.

287
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,234
But I don't know how you're gonna talk to her, though, because she passed.

288
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,507
Okay. Sorry to hear that.

289
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,973
Who could I call?

290
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,747
216-962-6746.

291
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,113
Whose number's that?

292
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,057
You know, it's a dream out here, Mr. Lopez.

293
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,287
The sun is shining. The nights are cool and serene,

294
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,298
and I notice that everyone is smiling.

295
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,262
<i>- Delivered just hours before... - Americans are asking...</i>

<i>Hi, this is Steve Lopez from the LA Times.</i>

300
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,336
<i>I spoke with your aunt, I believe, earlier. She suggested I give you a call.</i>

301
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,382
<i>- About what? - About your brother, Nathaniel.</i>

302
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,379
Is he dead?

303
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,615
What? No, no, no, he's alive.

304
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,019
<i>Is he all right?</i>

305
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:33,129
He's... Yeah. He's homeless. I don't know if you're aware of that.

306
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,826
But he seems very bright, and... May I record this?

307
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,732
And talented, obviously. Juilliard and all.

308
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,129
I'm, I'm... I'm sorry.

309
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,536
<i>- Your name again, please? - Steve Lopez.</i>

310
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,363
Mr. Lopez, why are you calling?

311
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,900
<i>I'm gonna write a column about Nathaniel.</i>

312
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,105
Why?

313
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:55,210
Because that's what I do. Everyone has a story, and it's interesting,

314
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,450
<i>you know, that a Juilliard alum is now homeless.</i>

315
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,757
But he seems smart and kind, and... And...

316
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,926
And spends his days filling the city air with violin music, and I just...

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,991
He plays the violin now?

318
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:15,505
He's... Yeah. Why? He used to play something else?

319
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,070
Bye, Mama.

320
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:41,054
- Good morning, Nathaniel. - Morning, Miss Little John.

321
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,699
So, what do you want to play for me?

322
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,111
I'm going to play some Beethoven, sir. I'm crazy about Beethoven.

323
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,206
He was younger than me when he started playing piano,

324
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,047
and I wanted to play the piano, but so many kids played it,

325
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,088
and there's only one at school, so it's hard to get practice time in.

326
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:08,456
So, I chose the cello. Hardly anyone at school wanted to play the cello.

327
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,189
And Beethoven was composing when he was only 11,

328
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,753
and I'm already older than that,

329
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,197
so I figure I got a lot of catching up to do.

330
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,132
Let's hear you play.

331
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,996
<i>He had the talent, that's for sure. I called his mother that night.</i>

332
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,336
<i>I told her that I thought he was the most gifted kid I've ever met.</i>

333
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,667
<i>I said that if he made a full commitment to music,</i>

334
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:06,514
<i>if he really, really gave it all he had, the whole world would open up to him.</i>

335
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,448
<i>And he did. He really did.</i>

336
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,820
Go see if Martha's rollers are ready. They should be on the kitchen table.

337
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,358
Okay, Mama.

338
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,556
Miss Florence, I'll be back in 10.

339
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,099
He ain't gonna get no sleep.

340
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,635
He gonna kill that little girl before he kills everybody...

341
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:29,003
$10,000! I told him he gotta buy me something real pretty. Real pretty.

342
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,693
<i>Before long, it got so that was all he did.</i>

343
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,891
<i>No more football, no more baseball. Just music.</i>

344
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,794
<i>Day in and day out.</i>

345
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,474
<i>The whole world was changing around him.</i>

346
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,038
<i>And that was all he did.</i>

347
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,439
<i>Music.</i>

348
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,763
Hey, you awake?

349
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,530
You know what I hear when you play your music?

350
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,506
I hear the voice of God coming...

351
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,470
I'm serious.

352
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,111
You got something special here, baby.

353
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,554
A way out.

354
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,120
There is a whole world waiting for you.

355

356
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,566
<i>Nathaniel was shy in our first encounter. Period.</i>

357
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,475
<i>He took a step back when I approached him to say</i>

358
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,070
<i>I liked the way his violin music</i>

359
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,879
<i>drowned out the jackhammers on Grand Street. Period.</i>

360
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,279
<i>Nathaniel's first instrument was the cello.</i>

361
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,553
<i>Strangely, he has never had any training on the violin instrument.</i>

362
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,355
<i>He has never had... Period.</i>

363
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,022
<i>He has never had any training on the violin.</i>

364
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,861
<i>He switched to the latter after winding up on the streets.</i>

365
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,032
<i>One day, I asked him about his hopes and dreams.</i>

366
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:30,165
<i>"That's easy," he said. "I'd like to get these other two strings."</i>

367
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,912
<i>Dear Mr. Lopez,</i>

368
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,575
<i>this morning I read your article about the street musician</i>

369
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,482
<i>and was deeply moved.</i>

370
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,048

371

<i>until arthritis got the better of me.</i>

372
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,322
<i>Please pass it along to Mr. Ayers</i>

373
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,627
<i>with my prayers for his health and safety.</i>

374
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,749
- Nathaniel! - All I'm trying to do

375
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,114
is work as hard as I can to clean up the tunnel.

376
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,244
- Hey! Nathaniel! - But they don't want me to help them.

377
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,447
I won't have it, you know.

378
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,615
- Don't want to have this degradation... - Are you out of your mind?

379
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,022
...because they just won't respect that Beethoven...

380
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,218
What are you doing?

381
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,557
...and I try to tell every one of them, I won't have this nastiness...

382
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,860
- Nathaniel! ...this degradation, I won't have it.

383
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,027
Don't!

384
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,598
Don't! Don't!

385
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,067
I'm not going to have this nastiness in this tunnel. This degradation.

386
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,203
Good.

387
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,544
Remember when I said I was gonna write about you?

388
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,414
Well, I did.

389
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,353
When people heard that you were just playing with two strings,

390
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,517
some of them thought you might want something better to work with.

391
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,493
No. I can't cover that.

392
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,154
You don't have to pay for it. It's a gift.

393
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,198
- I'm sure it's a very beautiful instrument. - Free and clear.

394
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,325
People are very, very generous.

395
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,561
But, look, here's the deal.

396
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,230
It's not safe for you to have something this valuable on the streets...

397
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,567
You don't have to worry about that, Mr. Lopez.

398
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,005
I've been mugged 14 times.

399
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,735
I will fight to the death to protect this instrument.

400
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,300
Right, that's my point exactly.

401
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,572
So, apparently there's a place

402
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,477
that's a couple of blocks down that's called Lamp.

403
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,038
- I can't go... No, I can't go there. - And I... Hold on.

404
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,140
I can't go... No, I can't go there.

405
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,206
- They smoke cigarettes. - I talked to the guy.

406
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,446
- He says you can keep it there. - They drop the butts on the ground.

407
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,579
They do it to torment me. They just... They do it to torment me.

408
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,420
That's the deal. You wanna play this, you gotta do it there.

409
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,790
- I can't do that. - Oh, yeah.

410
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,395
Except for this one time. Take it out and give it a test drive or whatever.

411
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,531
- So I can play it here? - For a couple minutes,

412
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,234
and then we're gonna bring it to Lamp.

413
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,455
Laying in there like a pig in a blanket.

414
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,595
Only... Only the greats. Really, only the greats.

415
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,157
Yo-Yo Ma, Jacqueline du Pr¨¦,

416
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,130
and the coolest cucumber of them all is

417
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,605
Janos Starker.

418
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:21,473
Gotta put rosin on your bow. It's just like feeding a parakeet.

419
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,277
A bow needs rosin just like a police car needs prisoners.

420
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,936
So pack it up. We'll bring it to Lamp, you can get back at it.

421
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,600
I haven't really gotten a chance to know her yet.

422
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,406
- So... - I'm not saying you can't play.

423
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,504
- You can. Just not here. - This is the perfect music environment

424
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,639
- for playing music. - This?

425
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,909
- No. - Yes.

426
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,416
This is a sidewalk, okay?

427
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,113
- That's the deal. We made a deal. - No, no, no. You'll break the bridge.

428
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,815
- You'll put water in it, you'll drown her. - That's what I'll do?

429
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,879
- It will be ruined. - Why would I damage it?

430
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,482
- I gave you the damn thing. - It won't play right ever,

431
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,288
- because, Mr. Lopez, you'll ruin it. - I'm not going to...

432
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,419
I'm not gonna see you get killed over this.

433
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,487
You don't know what you're doing. Let me put it away myself.

434
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,259
Then put it away.

435
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,460
Thank you.

436
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,968
Because when you start a relationship with somebody...

437
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,871
- Don't make a big deal of it, okay? - It is a big deal.

438
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,637
In a minute, you'll have it set up down at Lamp

439
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,474
and be playing like you never stopped.

440
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:49,638
- Right? - It's brand-new, this relationship.

441
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,739
- I don't want this relationship to end. - Do you know where it is?

442
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,943
- No, I can't do that. - Just leave that there. I'll drive you.

443
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,178
I have my cart there. I could get it in my cart.

444
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,311
What are you doing? You're gonna let go.

445
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,445
- Just let your fingers go. - Does anyone...

446
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:58,546
Does anyone see what he's doing right here?

447
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,217
- He's stealing it. - I'II... I'll meet you there.

448
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,953
San Julian and 6th.

449
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,392
All right?

450
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,394
- I'll drive. You walk. - I know where it is...

451
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,400
See you in a half hour?

452
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,187
For cash money I got speed, man.

453
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,551
I'm good.

455
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,630
Fine.

Tennis shoes.

457
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,840
Oh, boy.

461
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,707
I'm here for David.

462
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,043
- Who? - David.

463
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,084
David? I can go get him.

464
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,515
Thanks.

465
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,956
David!

00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,609
- Don't be scared. Come in. - Thanks.

470
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,611
Every staff has a key,

471
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,547
so if he does come by and I'm not here, then anybody can get it for him.

472
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,981
- Well, he'll be here. - Okay.

473
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,040
He said he was coming.

474
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,847
Can you sign in for me?

475
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,547
- Sure. - Thanks.

476
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,489
- Afternoon. - Hi. How are you?

477
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,994
I mean, it's tired. It's like they can't find the medication

478
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,497
that's right for me, you know?

479
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,430
- You know what I'm trying to say? - Yeah.

480
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,095
When they put me on lithium,

481
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,037
it was like a portion of my brain

482
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,131
was fully functional.

483
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,673
You know what I mean?

484
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,378
Because it's like when I take the lithium and everything,

485
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,848
it totally eliminates the voices in my mind

486
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,714
when they first start rising up,

487
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,380
you know, and it stops them, right there.

488
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,423
I don't like that, because they just stop them.

489
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,755
Because, see, sometimes those voices comfort me.

490
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,593
And when they comfort me, if they give me all this lithium,

491
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,292
then I no longer have the voices to comfort me.

492
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,698
You understand what I'm saying?

493
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,201
Do you feel what I'm saying to you?

494
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,972
- You mind if I sit here? - Not at all.

495
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,068
All right.

496
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,136
- I'm Steve. - I'm Steve, too.

497
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,511
Oh, boy. Hi.

498
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,881
- I knew I picked the right spot. - Yeah, you're good.

499
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,346
So are you a new Lamp staff, or...

500
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,156
- No. I'm just waiting for somebody. - Okay.

501
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,457
I just try to keep Leeann happy.

502
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,129
He is a bright spot in my life. We value the same things.

503
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,638
And we're comfortable together.

504
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,165
Thank you, Leeann. That's so nice to hear you say that.

505
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,137
I call him Piggy Boy and stuff like that,

506
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,876
but I shouldn't, because he's in a bad shape.

507
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,077
We thought his problem was cocaine.

508
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,177
- But it was pancreatic cancer. - Yeah?

509
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,587
KK's French, Egyptian, and African-American,

510
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,454
and I am a quarter French.

511
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,926
<i>I know about disease. I know how to treat it.</i>

512
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,793
Now I understand people. I can help so many people fast,

513
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:01,923
and I can comfort them.

514
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,366
They've got Italian nurses, 6'4", in the county hospital.

515
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,495
And one of them talked to me like I was trash.

516
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,735
Now, this is probably that the hour of power that the Bible speaks of,

517
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,801
somebody who speaks a harsh language, will have what the computer...

518
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,210
The computer is probably the beast.

519
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,180
My aunt ended up with 16 shock treatments

520
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,375
because she didn't want to go to bed

521
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,678
with her sex-crazed husband.

522
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,276
He was paying call girls $100 apiece,

523
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,616
going to bed with them and coming home

524
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,315
and giving my aunt all kinds of diseases.

525
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,415
I got sick. I was working over there.

526
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,893
And I got sicker than a dog one day. I got an infection in my esophagus.

527
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:35,159
The neighbor's dog was sick one day and the only thing I had on hand

528
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,996
was a packet of tetracycline for my chickens.

529
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,595
So they wouldn't... They were too busy to treat her at the moment.

530
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,105
- You're fantastic. - They'd already given her...

531
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,816
Ice cold. Ice cold.

532

<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

533
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,520
<i>I put Nathaniel's new instruments in safekeeping and waited.</i>

534
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,863
<i>Fifteen minutes. Thirty minutes. An hour.</i>

535
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,968
<i>Too long, in fact, 'cause guess what, schmuck,</i>

536
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,940
<i>you got a deadline tomorrow.</i>

537
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:22,677
<i>And the story of a guy not showing up</i>

538
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,407
<i>is not a story.</i>

539
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,774
<i>Nathaniel. Nathaniel. Nathaniel.</i>

540
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,900
Okay.

541
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,828
So, you guys are basically united by non-belief.

542
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,428
- That's right. - Yeah.

543
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,466
So, do you non-gather?

544
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,725
And non-worship?

545
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,667
We tried, but...

546
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,304
- Not a lot to talk about. - Yeah.

547
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,004
- Now we have a website. - Swell.

548
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,513
Anything else you don't believe in?

549
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,074
- Sorry. - Yeah, actually...

550
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,847
- Sorry. - Okay.

551
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,116
<i>- Lopez. - Can you hear this?</i>

552
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,315
Sorry, can't hear you.

553
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,552
<i>I said, can you hear this?</i>

554
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,567
This family thinks it can have this conversation at every step.

555
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,693
This is my apartment. This is my apartment.

556
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,930
This is my apartment.

Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Junior. N-A-T-H-A...

558
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,370
- I need Charles for the practice. ...because you're so good.

559
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,534
I am so good, but I still have to tweak things so I can win.

560
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,040
There's a fine line in performances.

561
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,547
- I mean, I can't let her beat me. - I really have to practice.

562
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,278
Half an hour is all it takes for me.

563
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,875
Half an hour.

<i>- I'm real proud of you, baby. - Thank you.</i>

574
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:21,280
It's just that I'm not always so sure I know what's going on, and...

<i>You are gonna be fine.</i>

576
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,083
It's so frightening, and...

577
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,648
And I'm having trouble differentiating certain things.

578
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,218

<i>They can hear your thoughts, Nathaniel.</i>

<i>Run away, Nathaniel.</i>

<i>They're white, heartless, aren't they?</i>

00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,366
<i>- Heartless. - Hide.</i>

605
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,736
<i>Hide for me here, Nathaniel.</i>

606
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,275
<i>We see you, Nathaniel.</i>

607

<i>You'll never hide well enough.</i>

610
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,475
<i>...turn you white... - Whiteness!</i>

611
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,643
<i>- No hiding for you, Nathaniel. - Whiteness. Whiteness.</i>

612
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,242
<i>Whiteness.</i>

613
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,479
You'll take it, because I want my out.

614
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,544
Detroit? Anger management.

615
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,146
It's amazing, right?

616
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:41,691
Does it look like I need some anger management to you?

617
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,453
Yeah. Man, I'll take him any day.

618
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,722
He quiets everybody down.

619
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:49,061
- What does he have, schizophrenia? - I don't know.

620
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,432
Well, we should hook him up with psychiatric services and find out, right?

621
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,405
Yeah, I don't get too hung up on diagnosis.

622
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,876
What do you mean?

623
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:00,932
What do I mean?

624
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:05,038
But how do you help somebody if you don't know what they have?

625
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,244
Look at these people.

626
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:10,218
Every one of them's been diagnosed more than you can imagine.

627
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,482
And as far as I can tell, it hasn't done them any good.

628
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,089
But he needs medication, right?

629
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,786
I'll tell you one thing he doesn't need.

630
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:21,024
One more person telling him he needs medication.

631
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,726
Son of a bitch.

632
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,533
- Where'd he go? - Who?

633
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,904
- Nathaniel. - Don't ask me, dude.

634
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,374
- Thanks, Steve. - You're welcome, Steve.

635
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,678
- Keep walking. Keep walking! - There's a cop over there.

636
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,450
- He'll shoot a nigga with a pop. - You got that cheese, huh?

637
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,390
- You're right about that cheese. - Hold on, hold on. Hold up.

638
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,759
Hey, wait!

639
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,364
Want to buy some candy?

640
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,121
Five-o. Five-o.

641
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,789
No way this is gonna be...

642
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,393
That boy's not the real police.

643
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,733
Oh, man. Hell, man. Where's my piece at, nigga?

644
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,579
Back up.

645
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,278
I went over to the library.

646
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,652
I thought I might pick up some sheet music.

647
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,782
<i>Sonata Number 1, F Major, Opus 5,</i>

648
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,827
<i>Sonata Number 2 in A Major, Opus 69 for String Quartet.</i>

649
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,226
What happened? Somebody get beat up?

650
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,354
Overdose, I think.

651
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,063
The other night, someone... There was a beating over here.

652
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:13,261
Someone got bones rearranged in their face. It was just crazy.

653
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:17,204
I don't understand why anybody would do something like that.

654
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,572
- This where you sleep? - I used to sleep on Wall Street,

655
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,474
but it's too dirty.

656
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,058
You know, Mr. Lopez, my vision...

657
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,656
I hate to admit it, but I'm gonna have to be like Beethoven.

658
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:47,863
Just do what he did and just die. Thank you, Mr. Lopez.

659
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,429
My vision is not far-off stuff,

660
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,941
just basically getting across the street safely.

661
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,499
Honor thy father and mother, and then, hopefully,

662
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,411
the music will take care of itself.

663
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,778
That's really all you can do.

664
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,214
I mean, when you think about it,

665
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,444
there's not much that you can do other than that.

666
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,249
- Would you care for a drink? - I'm fine.

667
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,390
Thanks.

668
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,760
Gotta tuck this guy in here, nice and safe.

669
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,431
Put that down there. Make sure this corner...

670
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,627
You can rest on this.

671
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,538
Do you think of writers often, Mr. Lopez?

672
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:31,138
Do you think of writers the way I think about musicians?

673
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,618
I write for a living,

674
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,781
and it's not like it used to be.

675
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,922
I love thinking about musicians.

676
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,624
I imagine Beethoven and Mozart in that window where the light is,

677
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,690
and they just hunger and they thirst like we do.

678
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,593
It's angelic.

679
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,137
I believe these children of God are gonna be okay tonight.

680
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,144
They're gonna sleep and dream as humans do.

681
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,337
Our Father,

682
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,637
who art in Heaven,

683
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,577
hallowed be thy name.

684
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,612
Thy kingdom come,

685
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:44,420
<i>thy will be done,</i>

686
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,758
<i>on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

687
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,006
<i>Give us this day our daily bread...</i>

688
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,667
Just keep it coming. There's plenty.

689
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,907
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

690
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:14,007
<i>as we forgive those who trespass against us.</i>

691
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,220
<i>I knew only part of his story.</i>

692
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:24,522
<i>I knew him playing the violin on a dairy crate in the morning sun,</i>

693
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,997
<i>suspended somewhere between boy genius and lost traveler.</i>

694
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,862
<i>Every night, my friend Nathaniel tucks his instruments away</i>

695
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,269
<i>and lays his head among the predators and hustlers,</i>

696
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,365
<i>among fallen drunks sprawled in the streets,</i>

697
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:44,277
<i>as rats the size of meatloaves dart out of the drains to feed off the squalor.</i>

698
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:54,321
<i>... lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</i>

699
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:58,384
<i>For thine is the kingdom,</i>

700
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,662
<i>the power and the glory,</i>

701
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,759
forever.

702
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,565
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

703
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,509
<i>I tell him this is no place for him. He says he wants to be here.</i>

704
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,308
<i>He says this is his choice.</i>

705
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:22,317
<i>Should I take him at his word, or should I try to force him inside?</i>

706
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,479
<i>Wouldn't a little arm-twisting be more humane</i>

707
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,079
<i>than leaving him here on the streets</i>

708
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:31,116
<i>in this lost colony of broken, helpless souls?</i>

709
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,930
I hope you sleep well, Mr. Lopez.

710
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,534
I hope the whole world sleeps well.

711
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,543
A-D-A-M C-R-A-N-E. He wants to meet you.

712
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,642
Who?
The guy from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Adam Crane.

713
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:01,564
Wondering if you wanna come hear a concert

714
00:56:01,638 --> 00:56:05,039
at Disney Hall some time as his guest.

715
00:56:05,108 --> 00:56:06,700
They're doing Beethoven.

716
00:56:06,776 --> 00:56:10,542
- Ludwig van? - Beethoven, all season long.

717
00:56:10,613 --> 00:56:12,205
<i>They got one coming up. The Third.</i>

718
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:15,308
<i>- Well, what's the date today? - No, the Third Symphony.</i>

719
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:19,448
I'll cause a scene. I don't wanna cause a scene.

720
00:56:19,522 --> 00:56:20,955
I don't wanna stick out or anything like that.

721
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,822
So it's just... It's impossible. It can't happen.

722
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:30,932
What if I could get us in for a rehearsal?

723
00:56:43,646 --> 00:56:45,511
Nathaniel, let's go.

724
00:56:45,582 --> 00:56:46,776
What I did with the keys right here...

725
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,044
Come on. Lock up the cart.

726
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:49,517
- No. You know what, Mr. Lopez? - Come on, we gotta go.

727
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:50,780
I can't leave my stuff here with these rascals.

728
00:56:50,854 --> 00:56:51,946
They can't be trusted. They'll do anything.

729
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:54,216
Oh, no. We have an entire orchestra waiting for us. We are gonna go.

730
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,552
They have drug addicts and cigarette smokers here,

731
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:56,819
and they will steal all of what I have.

732
00:56:56,893 --> 00:56:58,383
- No one is going to steal your shit. - I can't leave it.

733
00:56:58,461 --> 00:56:59,655
No, no. We have to get in touch with the mayor...

734
00:56:59,729 --> 00:57:01,196
- Nathaniel, it's garbage. ...Antonio Villaraigosa...

735
00:57:01,264 --> 00:57:02,925
...or the president. - No one is gonna steal this garbage.

736
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:04,364
- In the corner... - No, no, no, Mr. Lopez,

737
00:57:04,434 --> 00:57:05,901
I'm not gonna be able to make it up there.

738
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:07,095
Okay. Oh, boy.

739
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,434
<i>Fantasia. Walt Disney Hall. Donald Duck.</i>

740
00:57:09,572 --> 00:57:11,039
I have to deal with things here

741
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:13,974
because I wouldn't leave a dog with these people here.

742
00:57:14,043 --> 00:57:15,169
Right. Okay. Fine.

743
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:16,610
A cockroach does not tell a greyhound what to do.

744
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:21,275
It's fine! Do you understand? It's fine.

745
00:57:21,351 --> 00:57:25,014
I do not give a smooth fart if we go or not. Do you understand?

746
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:27,852
There are a million other things I could be doing right now.

747
00:57:27,924 --> 00:57:29,949
Obligations, things that people pay me to do.

748
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:32,790
I have a job. I'm a professional person.

749
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:48,334
- Sorry. - All right.

750
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:49,605
What?

751
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:54,376
Still not gonna leave my cart here.

752
00:57:56,986 --> 00:57:58,214
Okay.

753
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:01,448
Pick a side.

754
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:04,693
The company is offering you a very generous exit package.

755
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:05,750
Yeah.

756
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:08,457
- I understand how difficult this is. - Wait!

757
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:10,223
Right.

758
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,667
Unfortunately, this is the reality of our business.

759
00:58:16,272 --> 00:58:19,207
Nathaniel, hard left coming up right here.

760
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:38,294
Mr. Lopez, are you okay?

761
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:52,536
How long has it been since you've been in a concert hall?

762
00:58:58,748 --> 00:59:00,340
This is great.

763
00:59:02,385 --> 00:59:03,579
There's the conductor.

764
00:59:12,328 --> 00:59:15,491
- Just us. - Yeah, just us.

765
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:19,026
It's the way it should be.

766
01:01:35,004 --> 01:01:38,167
- He's in the room. - Who is?

767
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:39,606
Beethoven.

768
01:01:44,147 --> 01:01:45,273
Sing the hate out!

769
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,444
Stop.

770
01:01:48,685 --> 01:01:50,880
- All right. - Strong finish!

771
01:01:50,953 --> 01:01:51,977
Get up there.

772
01:01:55,825 --> 01:01:58,726
I'm telling you, it was such an unbelievable experience,

773
01:01:58,795 --> 01:02:01,992
the whole thing, the whole day.

774
01:02:02,065 --> 01:02:06,468
And if you had seen him, if you could have felt him...

775
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:07,833
I mean, it's the same hall.

776
01:02:07,904 --> 01:02:11,135
We're listening to the same goddamn music, but... But no.

777
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:13,141
You see him, it's one thing, but you feel him...

778
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:14,870
I'm watching him. He's watching the music.

779
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:16,639
And while they're playing, I say,

780
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:19,113
"My God, there is something higher out there.

781
01:02:19,182 --> 01:02:22,015
"Something higher out there, and he lives in it, and he's with it."

782
01:02:22,085 --> 01:02:25,577
I've never even experienced it, but I can tell...

783
01:02:25,655 --> 01:02:28,886
I don't even know what you fucking call it.

784
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:32,291
- Grace. - What? What is it?

785
01:02:32,361 --> 01:02:35,922
- Grace. - All right. That's grace?

786
01:02:35,998 --> 01:02:39,229
- Yeah. - Thank you. Yeah.

787
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,840
To be there with him like that

788
01:02:46,909 --> 01:02:50,606
and see the way that he is transported. He surrenders.

789
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:53,241
Damn it, honey.

790
01:02:53,316 --> 01:02:57,252
I mean, I've never loved anything the way that he loves music.

791
01:03:01,924 --> 01:03:06,054
Hey, come on. I'm thinking about my day.

792
01:03:06,129 --> 01:03:07,858
I'm thinking about my day. I wasn't thinking about you.

793
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:10,228
That I believe, honey.

794
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:12,765
Call the mayor. He's been trying to reach you.

795
01:03:12,835 --> 01:03:14,462
- Which mayor? - The mayor!

796
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:16,095
Okay.

797
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:29,542
Call the mayor.

798
01:03:31,554 --> 01:03:32,714
Thank you.

799

- Steve. - Yeah?

817
01:04:27,376 --> 01:04:29,571
Your boyfriend is downstairs.

818
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:34,316
Thank you.

819
01:04:35,985 --> 01:04:37,452
That's funny.

820
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:47,185
- Nathaniel? You all right? - I'm good.

821
01:04:47,263 --> 01:04:48,924
- Yeah? - Yeah.

822
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:49,987
You need something?

823
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:51,624
A man only needs what he can carry, Mr. Lopez,

824
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:53,862
and I have all I can carry right here. I have my bedding.

825
01:04:53,936 --> 01:04:55,699
- I have my drums. I have my flower. - Yeah. Okay.

826
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:58,171
- I have my water bottle. I have it all. - Hey, listen, listen. Listen.

827
01:04:58,241 --> 01:05:00,072
You can't hang out here.

828
01:05:00,142 --> 01:05:03,111
- I can't? - You can't hang out here.

829
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:05,340
You can't. Sorry.

830
01:05:05,414 --> 01:05:08,713
I don't mind that at all, Mr. Lopez. Not at all.

831
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:12,686
You understand, right? It's a... It's a thing. Policy.

832
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:19,593
- I'll be over here if you need me. - Over there?

833
01:05:20,663 --> 01:05:23,097
Okay. You all right?

834
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:28,493
Yeah, I just... You know, I... Yeah.

835
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:32,268
Sorry. I gotta...

836
01:05:35,444 --> 01:05:38,538
All right, Mr. Lopez, I completely understand that you're working.

837
01:05:38,614 --> 01:05:41,139
You're working. You have to work. People have to work.

838
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:43,412
All right, get out of the way when people are working,

839
01:05:43,486 --> 01:05:44,851
because you don't wanna stand out there

840
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:47,014
in front of people, especially not Mr. Lopez.

841
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:49,785
You stand in front of Mr. Lopez, he's gonna tell you to get out of here.

842
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:51,793
So, it's a lot of work.

843
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,489
<i>- I think he's good. You know, I really do. - I'm sure...</i>

844
01:05:55,564 --> 01:05:59,523
I mean, I just... This is great. I think... I think it'll really help.

845
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:01,536
I feel like you are exactly what he needs.

846
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:02,628
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

847
01:06:02,705 --> 01:06:04,866
<i>- Does that make sense? - Yes, it does.</i>

848
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:10,108
<i>- Graham Claydon. Thank you. - At your service.</i>

849
01:06:11,314 --> 01:06:14,408
All we need is a place for them to meet and rehearse, like an apartment.

850
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:16,508
You're asking for an apartment for Nathaniel?

851
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:19,679
- Yeah. - Does he want an apartment? Thanks.

852
01:06:19,755 --> 01:06:23,350
- Yes. - And he told you this?

853
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:26,327
- Yes. - You're so full of shit, Lopez.

854
01:06:26,796 --> 01:06:28,991
- I don't want an apartment. - Good, 'cause it's not.

855
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:30,498
It's actually a music studio

856
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:32,397
for Mr. Claydon to give you the cello lessons.

857
01:06:32,468 --> 01:06:34,368
Well, why don't we have Mr. Claydon come down here?

858
01:06:34,437 --> 01:06:35,563
This is a perfect place to play in, the tunnel.

859
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:36,627
No, Mr. Claydon doesn't like tunnels.

860
01:06:36,706 --> 01:06:38,196
We'll just have Mr. Claydon come here to do the lesson.

861
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:39,673
- He says it has to be quiet. - Well...

862
01:06:39,742 --> 01:06:41,937
It has to be quiet for the cello lessons, so your apartment...

863
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:43,035
It's not my apartment.

864
01:06:43,112 --> 01:06:45,012
I know. I know. The apartment that belongs to no one.

865
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:46,912
I don't have an apartment. I don't wanna be in an apartment.

866
01:06:46,983 --> 01:06:48,075
I don't need an apartment.

867
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:49,310
Beethoven lives out in the freshness of the air.

868
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:50,409
Nathaniel, the apartment is not the point.

869
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:51,748
He's the leader of Los Angeles.

870
01:06:51,821 --> 01:06:53,721
- It's an opportunity. - "Angeles" means "angels." You can't...

871
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:55,450
- You can't hold down angels. - Do you want the opportunity?

872
01:06:55,524 --> 01:06:56,513
- You can't clip angels. - Stop.

873
01:06:56,592 --> 01:07:00,426
- Do you want an opportunity or not? - Do you have an apartment?

874
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:07,097
No. I have a house.

875
01:07:15,745 --> 01:07:18,771
So angry. Yelling.

876
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:21,683
It doesn't make sense.

877
01:07:45,374 --> 01:07:47,865
- Do you have a family? - What?

878
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:49,911
Are you a married man?

879
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,510
- Is there a Mrs. Steve Lopez? - No.

880
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:59,583
I did. Mary. But we split up.

881
01:08:01,257 --> 01:08:04,590
We have a son, Thomas. He's in college now.

882
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:08,323
Mr. Steve Lopez, Mr. Thomas Steve Lopez, Mrs. Mary Steve Lopez.

883
01:08:08,397 --> 01:08:12,299
Not Mrs. Lopez. Mary Weston.

884
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:17,169
- Mrs. Mary Weston Steve Lopez. - No. Just Mary Weston. Period.

885
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:21,232
We were married. We're not anymore, so now she's just Mary.

886
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:25,246
You were married to Mary, but you're not married to Mary anymore.

887
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:28,283
Correct. Don't ask me how.

888
01:08:30,653 --> 01:08:34,282
Mrs. Floria Ayers, Miss Jennifer Ayers.

889
01:08:34,356 --> 01:08:37,120
And then there was Mr. Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Sr.

890
01:08:37,193 --> 01:08:39,423
He was a big man. He had big hands.

891
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:42,726
I have very small hands.

892
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:45,596
Fit around a violin, a cello.

893
01:08:48,204 --> 01:08:51,196
Mr. Ayers was a big man, but he wasn't a god.

894
01:08:53,142 --> 01:08:55,167
I have my god.

895
01:08:55,244 --> 01:08:56,643
Mr. Steve Lopez.

896
01:08:56,712 --> 01:08:57,701
Oh, boy.

897
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,270
Yeah, you're my god. Flying around high.

898
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:01,043
- You're my god. - I'm not comfortable being your god.

899
01:09:01,117 --> 01:09:02,414
Mr. Steve Lopez, staff writer, you are my god.

900
01:09:02,485 --> 01:09:04,146
- That it? I'm your god? - Yes, you are. You're my god.

901
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,552
All right. I am your god.

902
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:08,112
And as your god,

903
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:11,091
I command you to be at Lamp, 2:00 p.m., one week from today

904
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,459
for a cello lesson. Done deal.

905
01:09:17,533 --> 01:09:19,728
And it's a really sweet deal, too.

906
01:09:19,802 --> 01:09:22,134
'Cause if you show up, I will grant you eternal life.

907
01:09:22,204 --> 01:09:24,832
Hell, I might even make you a disciple.

908
01:09:24,907 --> 01:09:27,569
If you don't, you're on your own.

909
01:09:29,245 --> 01:09:30,473
<i>This is my apartment. This is my apartment.</i>

910
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:31,911
<i>This is my apartment.</i>

911
01:09:31,981 --> 01:09:33,471
<i>This is my apartment. This is my apartment.</i>

912
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:34,743
<i>This is my apartment.</i>

913
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:35,943
<i>Always number one. Always number two.</i>

914
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:37,144
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

915
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:38,846
<i>We've always been here, Nathaniel Ayers.</i>

916
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:41,253
<i>I've always been with you, Nathaniel.</i>

917
01:09:41,323 --> 01:09:44,292
<i>I'll never leave you, Nathaniel. I love you, Nathaniel.</i>

918
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,385
<i>- I love you. - No one else loves you, Nathaniel.</i>

919
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:49,192
<i>But I love you, Nathaniel. I'll protect you, Nathaniel.</i>

920
01:09:49,265 --> 01:09:52,325
<i>When you fell from Heaven, they laughed at you, Nathaniel.</i>

921
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:55,962
<i>You're my heart, Nathaniel. I do love you, Nathaniel.</i>

922
01:09:56,038 --> 01:09:58,165
<i>We'll be together forever, Nathaniel.</i>

923
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,264
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

924
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:01,241
<i>Look, I'll be here to protect you from the pain.</i>

925
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:04,370
<i>- I'll be here to protect you from the pain. - Fibber. You fibber. You fib.</i>

926
01:10:04,446 --> 01:10:05,743
<i>I'll protect you from the noise.</i>

927
01:10:05,814 --> 01:10:07,247
Fear for you. Fear for you.

928
01:10:07,316 --> 01:10:08,943
<i>I'll protect you from their beady eyes.</i>

929
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:11,077
<i>- I'll be here to obey. - I'll protect you from their eyes.</i>

930
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:15,214
<i>- Step right, Nathaniel. - No one else loves you, Nathaniel.</i>

931
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,815
<i>You're my boy, Nathaniel.</i>

932
01:10:16,892 --> 01:10:19,554
<i>- Take off the shoes. - I'll protect you. I'll protect you.</i>

933
01:10:19,628 --> 01:10:21,858
No one can kill the child. That's what the child is about.

934
01:10:21,931 --> 01:10:23,125
Forget you. Jump off!

935
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:43,440
Come on.

936
01:10:44,687 --> 01:10:46,882
Hey. Look at that.

937
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:51,392
Don't see those on the street. Quick right.

938
01:10:52,695 --> 01:10:54,356
And then, and then... And then right again, right here.

939
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:57,593
Nathaniel. Come on down.

940
01:10:57,666 --> 01:11:02,160
What are you... Come on. We go down here and then to the end and left.

941
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:03,762
I think we should do the lesson out here.

942
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:06,205
No, no, no. It's just this way. Come on.

943
01:11:06,275 --> 01:11:08,402
Mr. Lopez... Mr. Lopez.

944
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:10,468
Mr. Lopez, I really think we should do it out here.

945
01:11:10,546 --> 01:11:13,572
No, come on. Let's have a look. It's right down here.

946
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:15,116
Mr. Lopez.

947
01:11:15,517 --> 01:11:17,280
Nathaniel, come on.

948
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:19,348
It's really clean.

949
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:24,388
Come check it out.

950
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:29,659
We should do it out here. It's better. I'm more comfortable out here.

951
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:35,868
Looks nice.

952
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,405
Looks nice.

953
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,147
It's nice.

954
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:23,576
Come on. You can do it.

955
01:12:48,344 --> 01:12:49,606
Hey.

956
01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:55,309
I can't live here.

957
01:12:55,384 --> 01:12:57,784
I'll give you a hand with that.

958
01:13:00,622 --> 01:13:01,816
Got it.

959
01:13:04,026 --> 01:13:06,517
Oh, boy. Let's get this in nice.

960
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:10,623
Good.

961
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:16,962
It's great, right?

962
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:19,633
I mean, I like it. What do you think?

963
01:13:21,744 --> 01:13:25,043
It's nice. It's clean. The bathroom's better than...

964
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:28,773
Except for him.

965
01:13:28,851 --> 01:13:30,478
I don't wanna die in here.

966
01:13:30,552 --> 01:13:31,814
Don't...

967
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:32,979
Somebody could just come in here and kill me...

968
01:13:33,055 --> 01:13:34,955
- You'll be fine. Nathaniel? ...and take all of my belongings.

969
01:13:35,023 --> 01:13:36,547
- Nathaniel, the door locks. - A fly only lives 12 days.

970
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:39,219
What if in 12 days, someone walks through that door and murders me?

971
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:40,989
And I don't care about this Claydon thing, either.

972
01:13:41,063 --> 01:13:42,894
Walt Disney Hall. Disney Duck.

973
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,262
Doesn't make a difference. I don't need any of that.

974
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,392
If I'm gonna take a lesson, I should take the lesson in the tunnel

975
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:49,403
where I can hear the city sounds and not be locked off from life,

976
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:50,597
locked off from the world.

977
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:52,970
In the tunnel I can hear the music the way it's supposed to be played.

978
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:54,565
Not in this place, there's no city sounds,

979
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:57,305
there's no Beethoven, there's no Los Angeles, California.

980
01:13:57,379 --> 01:13:58,869
I don't belong here.

981
01:13:58,947 --> 01:14:00,278
I'm never coming here again.

982
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,371
Nathaniel, that's Graham Claydon.

983
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,779
Pleased to meet you, Nathaniel.

984
01:14:38,086 --> 01:14:40,816
I always love meeting a fellow musician.

985
01:14:43,392 --> 01:14:45,360
I brought you something.

986
01:14:45,561 --> 01:14:48,257
I know you're partial to Beethoven,

987
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,890
so I thought you'd enjoy this,

988
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:56,570
because, you know, without Johann Sebastian

989
01:14:56,638 --> 01:14:59,869
there would be no Ludwig van.

990
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:18,526
The A, the D, the A, the D, the A, the D.

991
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:23,057
Steady. Don't rush it. Don't rush it.

992
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:30,368
And...

993
01:15:34,776 --> 01:15:36,767
Well, for someone who hasn't had a lesson in three decades,

994
01:15:36,845 --> 01:15:38,938
you play quite beautifully.

995
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:40,575
Thank you.

996
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:41,843
- So... - Thank you.

997
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:44,475
Work on a smoother rhythm with the right hand.

998
01:15:44,553 --> 01:15:47,044
And don't stop-start.

999
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:49,613
Carry a phrase all the way through.

1000
01:15:49,858 --> 01:15:50,847
- Great. - Give you a ride uptown?

1001
01:15:50,959 --> 01:15:52,449
- Thank you. - Mr. Claydon?

1002
01:15:53,328 --> 01:15:55,228
- Yes. - Sir?

1003
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:59,623
Do you think I could be good again?

1004
01:16:01,803 --> 01:16:03,293
Yes, I do.

1005
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,733
I like your apartment, by the way.

1006
01:16:09,144 --> 01:16:10,668
- It's not my apartment. - It's not. It's just a...

1007
01:16:10,746 --> 01:16:11,906
I don't live here.

1008
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:13,543
Well, you should.

1009
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:18,814
God has blessed you with a gift, Nathaniel.

1010
01:16:18,887 --> 01:16:22,118
Nothing pains God more than when we squander his blessings.

1011
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,859
- You owe it to him to care for this... - I don't owe God.

1012
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:29,423
Mr. Steve Lopez is my god.

1013
01:16:29,731 --> 01:16:31,392
- What? - Star writer for Los Angeles.

1014
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:33,696
Higher power flying around with wings like an angel.

1015
01:16:33,769 --> 01:16:36,169
Mr. Steve Lopez is my...

1016
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:37,829
He doesn't know what he's saying.

1017
01:16:37,906 --> 01:16:40,033
Mr. Graham Claydon is going to tell me who my god is?

1018
01:16:40,108 --> 01:16:41,097
Down by the car?

1019
01:16:41,176 --> 01:16:42,404
Do you know who my god is, Mr. Claydon?

1020
01:16:42,544 --> 01:16:44,307
I know who my god is!

1021
01:16:44,379 --> 01:16:45,403
- He's a good teacher. - I know who my god is.

1022
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:46,742
You should accept his help gracefully.

1023
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:48,578
Graceful is the ballerinas at Juilliard.

1024
01:16:49,017 --> 01:16:50,382
Those girls were graceful.

1025
01:16:50,452 --> 01:16:53,080
- Tiny ballerinas just twirling round. - There's other people in this...

1026
01:16:54,022 --> 01:16:55,421
- Twirling round. Angels. - All right,

1027
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,617
- graceful as little ballerinas. - I love them flying around

1028
01:16:57,693 --> 01:17:00,059
like I love Mr. Steve Lopez flying around.

1029
01:17:00,128 --> 01:17:02,289
I love God. I love you!

1030
01:17:09,371 --> 01:17:10,702
I love you.

1031
01:17:13,976 --> 01:17:15,102
I don't want him to love me.

1032
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:17,338
Well, it looks like you might have to get over that.

1033
01:17:17,412 --> 01:17:18,674
It's a bad idea.

1034
01:17:18,747 --> 01:17:20,715
"I love you, Steve," turns into, "You failed me, Steve,"

1035
01:17:20,782 --> 01:17:22,613
turns into very bad things.

1036
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:24,845
That's my limited experience.

1037
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,545
I don't want to be on the other side of that with him. Would you?

1038
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:30,683
He doesn't know if I'm a ballerina, if I'm God, if I'm an airplane pilot.

1039
01:17:30,759 --> 01:17:33,250
He has no idea what he's saying.

1040
01:17:34,529 --> 01:17:36,656
Is there something you want from me, Lopez?

1041
01:17:36,865 --> 01:17:38,992
Or did you just come to show me your prom dress? You look nice.

1042
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:40,056
I want you to help him

1043
01:17:40,402 --> 01:17:41,926
because he's sick and he needs medication

1044
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:43,733
and you have a team of doctors here.

1045
01:17:43,805 --> 01:17:46,205
Tell them to sit down with him. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

1046
01:17:46,642 --> 01:17:49,236
Nathaniel's made it quite clear he's not ready to speak to a psychiatrist.

1047
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:50,300
Force him.

1048
01:17:50,445 --> 01:17:51,503
- Force him? - Tell him to do it.

1049
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,638
Tell him he can't play his instruments

1050
01:17:52,714 --> 01:17:53,738
until he sits down with a shrink.

1051
01:17:53,815 --> 01:17:57,307
- That's not what we do here. - What you do here is fucked.

1052
01:17:59,421 --> 01:18:00,581
It is.

1053
01:18:01,523 --> 01:18:06,722
Look, even if I did wanna cohorse Nathaniel into psychiatry...

1054
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:08,160
- Coerce. ...which... Whatever.

1055
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,993
- Coerce. - Lf I wanted to do that, which I don't,

1056
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:12,829
I couldn't force him to take medication.

1057
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:15,165
The law is the law. Unless he's an imminent danger

1058
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:17,034
to himself or someone else...

1059
01:18:17,105 --> 01:18:19,096
Are you gonna answer that, or what?

1060
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,547
I'm in the car. What if he was a danger to someone else?

1061
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:30,346
- But he's not. - Mary, I'm on the way. Relax.

1062
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:32,614
What if someone said he was?

1063
01:18:32,688 --> 01:18:34,815
What if someone dialed 911 and said Nathaniel had attacked him?

1064
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:35,914
They'd put him in psychiatric hospital.

1065
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:37,891
I know you're not thinking of lying on him, Lopez.

1066
01:18:37,959 --> 01:18:39,950
And then he would be in a 14-day psychiatric hold,

1067
01:18:40,028 --> 01:18:42,622
they'd put him on meds straight away.

1068
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:45,499
What if that's all it took for him to be well?

1069
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:47,967
What if two weeks of meds, a two-week window

1070
01:18:48,036 --> 01:18:52,666
into what his life could be, changed his life? Saved his life?

1071
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:56,067
Why wouldn't you want to be part of that?

1072
01:18:57,512 --> 01:19:02,176
Steve, Nathaniel has one thing going for him right now. A friend.

1073
01:19:03,251 --> 01:19:07,688
If you betray that friendship, you destroy the only thing he has in this world.

1074
01:19:07,756 --> 01:19:10,224
I don't want to be his only thing.

1075
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:18,764
Didn't you just tell somebody you was in your car?

1076
01:19:24,439 --> 01:19:26,270
Mary, relax. What table are we at?

1077
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:28,468
<i>This is Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, Jr., Mr. Lopez. I was calling...</i>

1078
01:19:28,543 --> 01:19:29,737
- Nathaniel. ...because you promised me

1079
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,006
a hard case for my cello and I haven't received it yet.

1080
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,911
<i>- Yeah? - And also I need sheet music</i>

1081
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:35,381
<i>for Beethoven's Second Sonata.</i>

1082
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:39,113
<i>And also Opus 131 and Septet for strings and woodwinds, and Opus 20...</i>

1083
01:19:39,187 --> 01:19:41,246
Can you just... One sec.

1084
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:44,224
<i>...and also my A string is missing... - So, we're talking about...</i>

1085
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:46,726
I need my A string replaced.

1086
01:19:46,795 --> 01:19:49,662
Nathaniel, you know, this is not...

1087
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:55,428
<i>... his series in the Times on the struggles and the triumphs</i>

1088
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:57,699
<i>of Nathaniel Anthony Ayers</i>

1089
01:19:57,773 --> 01:20:01,106
<i>has brought crucial attention to one of the most pressing issues in our city.</i>

1090
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:02,803
<i>... promises you should make good on those promises...</i>

1091
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:04,402
Get off the phone.

1092
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:07,243
<i>... to address this problem with compassion and commitment.</i>

1093
01:20:07,315 --> 01:20:08,339
<i>And in honor of this,</i>

1094
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:12,614
<i>it is my pleasure to present this year's Media Award to Steve Lopez.</i>

1095
01:20:14,256 --> 01:20:15,553
Thank you.

1096
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:21,161
<i>... you know that I can't leave my cart anywhere.</i>

1097
01:20:21,229 --> 01:20:24,824
<i>It houses my violin, my cello, and my weapons of mass destruction.</i>

1098
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,892
<i>A child needs protection. You don't want to put a baby in the trunk of a car</i>

1099
01:20:27,969 --> 01:20:30,130
<i>and have it get bashed up against the wall.</i>

1100
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:33,197
<i>Bashed up against the wall. Bashed up against the wall.</i>

1101
01:20:36,912 --> 01:20:39,938
I got a phone call from Mark Rosenthal today, remember him?

1102
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:41,106
Book editor?

1103
01:20:41,183 --> 01:20:42,616
Bob Geldof with a crew cut.

1104
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:46,142
He's been reading your Nathaniel stuff, thinks it's genius, whatever.

1105
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:50,180
- Whatever. - Anyway. He said it's a book.

1106
01:20:50,959 --> 01:20:52,483
What did he say exactly?

1107
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:56,793
"It's personal, it's political, it's timely. I can sell the shit out of it."

1108
01:20:56,865 --> 01:20:59,663
- Oh, boy. - His words, excuse me, not mine.

1109
01:20:59,734 --> 01:21:02,567
Well, it's complicated. Nathaniel's complicated.

1110
01:21:02,637 --> 01:21:05,299
Well, yeah, he's mentally ill, I mean.

1111
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:09,704
Right. But beyond that, it's endless.

1112
01:21:09,778 --> 01:21:12,008
I just... I don't want to take full responsibility.

1113
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,605
By all means, avoid full responsibility.

1114
01:21:14,683 --> 01:21:17,208
Just, you know, keep going with the partial responsibility

1115
01:21:17,285 --> 01:21:20,448
and exploiting him like you are now.

1116
01:21:20,522 --> 01:21:21,511
You should stop.

1117
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:22,682
'Cause that's a slippery slope right there,

1118
01:21:22,757 --> 01:21:23,849
Lopez.

1119
01:21:23,925 --> 01:21:25,688
- Stop. Stop. - One day, you're getting a book...

1120
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,489
- Please stop. ...from the guy. And the next,

1121
01:21:27,562 --> 01:21:28,586
he's expecting, I don't know, some sort of...

1122
01:21:28,663 --> 01:21:29,755
Mary, stop.

1123
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:32,823
...consistency in the relationship. Screw that, man.

1124
01:21:32,901 --> 01:21:36,302
Who needs that shit, right? My words.

1125
01:21:36,371 --> 01:21:38,305
- You driving? - No, I have a car.

1126
01:21:38,373 --> 01:21:39,806
And a driver?

1127
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:44,140
- Oh, my God! - Oh, shit.

1128
01:21:44,246 --> 01:21:46,339
It's Nathaniel for you.

1129
01:21:48,216 --> 01:21:50,411
<i>... as a youngster labeled mentally ill</i>

1130
01:21:50,485 --> 01:21:52,453
<i>because of the underlying cigarette habit,</i>

1131
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,283
<i>constant disturbance, constant disturbance.</i>

1132
01:21:54,356 --> 01:21:56,187
<i>You know, bigots have children, too.</i>

1133
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:58,021
<i>Pens from Steve Lopez. Many thanks.</i>

1134
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:00,527
<i>Constant disturbance, constant disturbance.</i>

1135
01:22:00,595 --> 01:22:02,620
<i>Bigots have children. Bigots have children, too.</i>

1136
01:22:02,697 --> 01:22:06,224
<i>Pens... Paper... Pens from Steve Lopez. Many thanks.</i>

1137
01:22:09,237 --> 01:22:12,866
<i>And a cello from Steve Lopez. Steve Lopez... Many thanks to that.</i>

1138
01:22:12,941 --> 01:22:16,536
<i>Without Steve Lopez, I wouldn't have any of that...</i>

1139
01:22:16,611 --> 01:22:18,238
<i>Constant disturbance.</i>

1140
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:21,282
<i>Constant disturbance. Constant disturbances.</i>

1141
01:22:21,549 --> 01:22:24,518
<i>I've had what I think is a beautiful idea.</i>

1142
01:22:24,586 --> 01:22:27,384
<i>I think Nathaniel should give a recital.</i>

1143
01:22:28,223 --> 01:22:31,818
I don't know if I can make that call. He hasn't been very lucid lately.

1144
01:22:31,893 --> 01:22:34,123
<i>- Right. When is he clearest? - I don't...</i>

1145
01:22:34,195 --> 01:22:36,629
<i>When is he most able to focus his thoughts?</i>

1146
01:22:36,698 --> 01:22:38,723
<i>- When he's playing. - Right.</i>

1147
01:22:39,234 --> 01:22:41,998
This could increase his confidence a thousand fold.

1148
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:43,867
It could be transformative.

1149
01:22:43,939 --> 01:22:46,464
<i>How can we not give him that, Steve?</i>

1150
01:22:49,544 --> 01:22:51,307
God bless you, Steve.

1151
01:22:52,781 --> 01:22:54,248
Sure he does.

1152
01:23:07,796 --> 01:23:13,632
My first concert, I was so nervous, I vomited all down my tuxedo.

1153
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:16,068
It was so embarrassing.

1154
01:23:18,473 --> 01:23:21,806
Want to know how I got over those jitters, Nathaniel?

1155
01:23:22,844 --> 01:23:24,106
I prayed.

1156
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,814
Shall we pray together, you and I?

1157
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:31,178
Heavenly Father,

1158
01:23:31,686 --> 01:23:33,950
shine your light on brother Nathaniel,

1159
01:23:34,022 --> 01:23:37,287
that he may speak with your voice tonight.

1160
01:24:34,682 --> 01:24:38,948
<i>Nathaniel, you never have been here, Nathaniel. I'm here, Nathaniel.</i>

1161
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,011
<i>- You're not there. - Nathaniel.</i>

1162
01:24:41,089 --> 01:24:44,286
<i>You never have been here. You never will be here.</i>

1163
01:24:46,694 --> 01:24:47,956
<i>My voice is all there is.</i>

1164
01:24:48,029 --> 01:24:49,587
Everything's fine.

1165
01:24:49,664 --> 01:24:50,995
<i>- Follow my voice, Nathaniel. - Tune up and play.</i>

1166
01:24:51,066 --> 01:24:52,226
<i>Run away from these people, Nathaniel.</i>

1167
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,426
<i>They'll laugh at you.</i>

1168
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:55,128
<i>- You're nothing. - Nathaniel Ayers.</i>

1169
01:25:06,214 --> 01:25:07,647
Nathaniel?

1170
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:11,779
I got some soup here for you.

1171
01:25:34,809 --> 01:25:36,174
Nathaniel?

1172
01:25:37,312 --> 01:25:39,780
You think I'm stupid. Is that what you think?

1173
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:42,976
<i>You want to kill them, Nathaniel. They'll kill you first, Nathaniel.</i>

1174
01:25:43,051 --> 01:25:44,075
No.

1175
01:25:44,152 --> 01:25:45,676
<i>They'll string you up, Nathaniel.</i>

1176
01:25:45,753 --> 01:25:48,551
No. You think I can't see everything. I see everything.

1177
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:50,523
I know who you are. I know what you're doing.

1178
01:25:50,592 --> 01:25:52,059
<i>- Dogs, biting at your feet. - Nathaniel.</i>

1179
01:25:52,127 --> 01:25:54,186
<i>- I thought you might be hungry. - Nathaniel, over there.</i>

1180
01:25:54,262 --> 01:25:57,823
<i>- The dusty open manual. - Nathaniel, come here.</i>

1181
01:25:57,899 --> 01:25:59,059
<i>The manual.</i>

1182
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:02,501
That's hydrochloric acid. If I eat that, it'll burn me up inside and kill me like a dog.

1183
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:04,435
<i>- Oh, no. - Nathaniel.</i>

1184
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:06,736
<i>- Nathaniel, I wouldn't do that. - Nathaniel.</i>

1185
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:09,008
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

1186
01:26:09,077 --> 01:26:10,738
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

1187
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,373
<i>You'll eat it, dust and all.</i>

1188
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:16,610
Okay.

1189
01:26:17,418 --> 01:26:19,079
It's good, see.

1190
01:26:28,997 --> 01:26:30,225
Shit.

1191
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,362
Don't put your hands on me!

1192
01:26:36,437 --> 01:26:38,302
- Nathaniel! - Back the hell off!

1193
01:26:38,373 --> 01:26:40,967
Don't you ever touch me! Don't ever put your hands on me!

1194
01:26:41,042 --> 01:26:43,340
Please, don't. Nathaniel.

1195
01:26:46,714 --> 01:26:47,908
Don't you ever touch me.

1196
01:26:47,982 --> 01:26:49,074
Stop.

1197
01:27:01,863 --> 01:27:03,228
Nathaniel!

1198
01:27:14,275 --> 01:27:18,234
What am I supposed to do? I should have support.

1199
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:30,214
Hi, Nathaniel.

1200
01:27:33,294 --> 01:27:36,695
It's freezing out here. Don't you wanna come home?

1201
01:27:36,764 --> 01:27:38,959
I can't go back there. It's not safe.

1202
01:27:39,033 --> 01:27:41,001
Come on, home, Nathaniel.

1203
01:27:46,274 --> 01:27:47,741
Nathaniel?

1204
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:50,778
Where are you gonna sleep?

1205
01:27:59,587 --> 01:28:03,250
David, sorry, it's Steve. Listen.

1206
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:06,483
Can you call me back when you have a second?

1207
01:28:06,561 --> 01:28:09,792
There was an incident with Nathaniel tonight. I'm a little

1208
01:28:10,765 --> 01:28:13,825
worried. Anyway, call back when you have a sec.

1209
01:28:17,605 --> 01:28:19,072
All right, let's go.

1210
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:33,884
It's my thing! I claim my right to those possessions!

1211
01:28:33,955 --> 01:28:35,684
Show me your stuff!

1212
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:40,618
- Linda! - What?

1213
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:42,788
- Hey, where's Nathaniel? - I don't know. I haven't seen him.

1214
01:28:42,864 --> 01:28:45,025
- I haven't seen him. - Hey! Hey!

1215
01:28:45,366 --> 01:28:46,890
Is it Darryl?

1216
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:48,128
Hey, stay back. Who the hell are you?

1217
01:28:48,202 --> 01:28:50,864
<i>LA Times. That's the last guy you should be arresting.</i>

1218
01:28:50,938 --> 01:28:52,997
- Come on, man! Come on. - Skid row cleanup, sir. Let's go.

1219
01:28:53,074 --> 01:28:54,166
Steve! Steve!

1220
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:57,075
This man is in illegal possession of a shopping cart and a milk crate.

1221
01:28:57,145 --> 01:28:59,079
Are you gonna arrest him for possession of a milk crate?

1222
01:28:59,147 --> 01:29:01,638
- Steve! Steve! - That's correct, sir.

1223
01:29:04,252 --> 01:29:05,719
Take it easy.

1224
01:29:06,688 --> 01:29:08,622
Help! Help!

1225
01:29:17,665 --> 01:29:19,064
<i>Come on!</i>

1226
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,090
Officer, what happened?

1227
01:29:21,169 --> 01:29:23,399
A couple of kids came out here with some baseball bats

1228
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:24,870
and beat the shit out of this poor guy.

1229
01:29:24,939 --> 01:29:27,032
- Get a name? - Negative, sir.

1230
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,007
Sorry, excuse me. I'm sorry.

1231
01:29:37,051 --> 01:29:41,647
Is this Admits? May I make an enquiry about a... Excuse me.

1232
01:29:41,989 --> 01:29:43,581
- This way? - What?

1233
01:29:43,658 --> 01:29:44,818
Yeah, down here.

1234
01:29:44,892 --> 01:29:48,157
It's usually on the... I'm sorry. It's usually on the screen.

1235
01:29:48,896 --> 01:29:52,593
Excuse me, ma'am. Recent ER admits named Ayers, A-Y-E-R-S.

1236
01:29:52,867 --> 01:29:54,664
Thank you, by the way.

1237
01:29:56,104 --> 01:29:57,230
No.

1238
01:29:58,306 --> 01:30:00,103
Hi. Thank you.

1239
01:30:00,174 --> 01:30:02,836
I'm looking for a recent admission.

1240
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:06,346
I'm hoping you have a recent admission with a man named Ayers, A-Y-E-R-S.

1241
01:30:06,748 --> 01:30:10,445
I know. Contreras was the reporting officer. He was the officer on site.

1242
01:30:12,186 --> 01:30:14,120
It's not the... It's not the...

1243
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:19,589
Mr. Ayers. A-Y-E-R-S.

1244
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:22,561
Nathaniel Anthony Ayers. 5'10" African-American.

1245
01:30:22,864 --> 01:30:24,297
Hi. It's me again.

1246
01:30:24,832 --> 01:30:26,424
It's gonna be a long shift. What's your name?

1247
01:30:26,734 --> 01:30:29,328
N-A-T-H-A-N-l-E-L A...

1248
01:30:30,605 --> 01:30:32,368
I do words for a living. It doesn't matter.

1249
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,998
Whoever has two stripes on their arm or more.

1250
01:30:34,075 --> 01:30:36,509
Ayers! A-Y-E-R-S.

1251
01:30:36,577 --> 01:30:41,776
N-A-T-H-A-N-l-E-L A-N-T-H-O-N-Y A-Y-E-R-S.

1252
01:30:41,949 --> 01:30:43,746
No! Do not put me on hold again!

1253
01:30:43,818 --> 01:30:47,379
A-Y-E-R-S!

1254
01:31:11,779 --> 01:31:13,974
<i>- Lopez. - Steve, David.</i>

1255
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,380
<i>I got your message, what's up?</i>

1256
01:31:16,451 --> 01:31:19,352
There was a beating of a homeless man on Winston Street,

1257
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:22,253
<i>- it was right in Nathaniel's spot. - It wasn't him.</i>

1258
01:31:23,357 --> 01:31:24,483
What? How do you know?

1259
01:31:24,559 --> 01:31:28,518
'Cause he's here, eating a crazy-big breakfast.

1260
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:32,795
I guess sleeping inside can give a man an appetite.

1261
01:31:33,668 --> 01:31:34,965
What?

1262
01:31:35,036 --> 01:31:37,504
<i>He spent last night in the apartment.</i>

1263
01:31:38,606 --> 01:31:40,164
<i>He came inside.</i>

1264
01:31:58,793 --> 01:32:00,021
Thank you.

1265
01:32:00,094 --> 01:32:03,427
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.

1266
01:32:03,598 --> 01:32:05,725
I thought I lost it forever.

1267
01:32:06,067 --> 01:32:07,125
Hi.

1268
01:32:08,736 --> 01:32:09,998
You good?

1269
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:17,568
I literally looked everywhere else in Los Angeles but here.

1270
01:32:19,213 --> 01:32:21,078
Not that I was worried.

1271
01:32:21,582 --> 01:32:23,573
What happened? What made you decide to sleep in here?

1272
01:32:23,651 --> 01:32:27,178
Oh, well, a body can only take so much, Mr. Lopez.

1273
01:32:27,255 --> 01:32:30,088
I'm not young anymore, I'm a middle-aged man.

1274
01:32:30,157 --> 01:32:32,182
- You know how it is. - Sure.

1275
01:32:34,161 --> 01:32:35,822
I mean, a body gets weary, a body...

1276
01:32:35,897 --> 01:32:37,626
Housewarming gift.

1277
01:32:47,975 --> 01:32:49,704
Thank you, Mr. Lopez.

1278
01:32:51,913 --> 01:32:55,144
Thank you, Mr. Lopez. Thank you.

1279
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:02,887
I've done good by you, haven't I?

1280
01:33:03,391 --> 01:33:05,882
I mean, things aren't so bad, right?

1281
01:33:10,197 --> 01:33:14,497
Say, things are set for Jennifer to become your executor.

1282
01:33:14,569 --> 01:33:18,164
I can't believe Beethoven himself is in my own apartment.

1283
01:33:18,606 --> 01:33:21,439
Are you still okay with that? Having Jennifer handle things for you?

1284
01:33:21,509 --> 01:33:23,500
It's all right with me if it's all right with Beethoven.

1285
01:33:23,578 --> 01:33:25,671
Well, you guys let me know.

1286
01:33:27,214 --> 01:33:31,173
'Cause there's papers you gotta sign. They just got back from...

1287
01:33:31,752 --> 01:33:34,448
You should read them so you know what you're signing.

1288
01:33:34,522 --> 01:33:37,116
All right, yeah, I'll just sign them Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, Jr.,

1289
01:33:37,191 --> 01:33:41,184
apartment B-116, and the B stands for

1290
01:33:42,997 --> 01:33:44,464
Beethoven.

1291
01:33:46,467 --> 01:33:48,094
- Read them and sign them. - All right.

1292
01:33:48,169 --> 01:33:49,227
- Okay. - All right.

1293
01:33:49,303 --> 01:33:50,861
What do you... You got anything to drink?

1294
01:33:50,938 --> 01:33:53,532
Yes, sir, Mr. Lopez. Absolutely, Mr. Lopez,

1295
01:33:53,608 --> 01:33:58,102
help yourself to some water, it's where the dripping sound is coming from.

1296
01:34:00,047 --> 01:34:02,174
- At your leisure. - All right.

1297
01:34:11,425 --> 01:34:12,790
Is there a...

1298
01:34:16,097 --> 01:34:18,122
What's with Neil Diamond?

1299
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:20,099
I thought that was you.

1300
01:34:28,242 --> 01:34:31,234
Well, I'm flattered. He's a good-Iooking guy.

1301
01:34:33,848 --> 01:34:35,338
What's wrong?

1302
01:34:37,251 --> 01:34:39,446
What's this business about me

1303
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:43,256
having a schizophrenic mind?

1304
01:34:45,326 --> 01:34:46,850
It's, it's... It's legal jargon.

1305
01:34:46,927 --> 01:34:50,294
It says that I have a schizophrenic mind. I do not.

1306
01:34:50,364 --> 01:34:51,524
It doesn't mean anything.

1307
01:34:51,599 --> 01:34:55,057
- I have a schizophrenic mind. - That's not what I think.

1308
01:34:55,369 --> 01:34:57,963
Nathaniel, they try to put people in a...

1309
01:34:58,039 --> 01:34:59,836
- I'm not going anywhere. - And the good news is that

1310
01:34:59,907 --> 01:35:01,841
it has nothing to do with you.

1311
01:35:01,909 --> 01:35:04,776
I don't go where you say to go. I go where I want to go.

1312
01:35:04,845 --> 01:35:06,972
You don't put me away, Mr. Lopez. You don't put me away.

1313
01:35:07,048 --> 01:35:08,447
- Okay. Okay. - You don't put me away.

1314
01:35:08,516 --> 01:35:09,540
I'm not gonna... I don't...

1315
01:35:09,617 --> 01:35:11,414
- No, no, you don't have to go... - Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

1316
01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:12,577
...to court. You don't have to go anywhere.

1317
01:35:12,653 --> 01:35:14,052
Jennifer will take care of you.

1318
01:35:14,121 --> 01:35:16,146
My sister's not coming near me. She is not coming near me.

1319
01:35:16,223 --> 01:35:18,123
- She's not coming near me. - Okay, remember when you said...

1320
01:35:18,192 --> 01:35:19,489
If I say she's not coming then she's not coming.

1321
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,721
You said... Nathaniel, you said...

1322
01:35:21,796 --> 01:35:24,230
Listen, I'm not going to have anymore... I'm not going to have anymore...

1323
01:35:24,298 --> 01:35:27,859
I will tell you. I will tell you. I'm sick of being Nathaniel and you Mr. Lopez.

1324
01:35:27,935 --> 01:35:29,095
Okay. I'm not just...

1325
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:31,866
Wait. I'm not your boy. I am not Mr. Colonel Sanders's boy.

1326
01:35:31,939 --> 01:35:34,908
You know, I'm sorry I was wrong. I'm sorry I was wrong.

1327
01:35:34,975 --> 01:35:39,036
I can take care of myself. I can take care of myself, Mr. Lopez.

1328
01:35:39,113 --> 01:35:43,948
I don't need you. I don't need this city. I despise this city and I despise you.

1329
01:35:46,954 --> 01:35:49,081
And if I ever see you again,

1330
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:51,986
I'll cut you open

1331
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,951
and gut you like a fish.

1332
01:36:05,139 --> 01:36:08,700
Because I'm Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Jr.

1333
01:36:10,111 --> 01:36:12,739
Mr. Ayers.

1334
01:36:15,449 --> 01:36:19,476
I'm Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Jr. N-A-T-H-A...

1335
01:36:24,058 --> 01:36:25,491
N-A-T-H-A...

1336
01:36:25,559 --> 01:36:31,198
<i>- N-A-T-H-A... - You're of no consequence.</i>

1337
01:36:46,147 --> 01:36:47,876
- Hi. - Hi.

1338
01:37:17,311 --> 01:37:19,575
So, that was my first mistake.

1339
01:37:24,652 --> 01:37:27,143
The Northridge Quake, '94, remember?

1340
01:37:27,755 --> 01:37:29,450
I smelled the toast.

1341
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,928
We'd been here two days.

1342
01:37:36,163 --> 01:37:38,324
All our crap still in boxes.

1343
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:40,162
And at 4:00 a.m. It hit.

1344
01:37:40,835 --> 01:37:42,496
God, that terror.

1345
01:37:46,674 --> 01:37:49,370
You, me and Thomas. What was he, nine?

1346
01:37:49,777 --> 01:37:54,476
All huddled under that bedroom door frame.

1347
01:37:54,815 --> 01:37:57,079
I told him it was a good omen.

1348
01:38:00,221 --> 01:38:02,451
Welcoming us to our new life.

1349
01:38:03,324 --> 01:38:04,723
Better life.

1350
01:38:06,427 --> 01:38:07,689
In LA.

1351
01:38:20,307 --> 01:38:24,004
I should have had us on the first flight back to Philly.

1352
01:38:35,022 --> 01:38:37,217
I thought I was helping someone.

1353
01:38:38,392 --> 01:38:40,656
And it was a guy who's got a gift.

1354
01:38:40,728 --> 01:38:43,060
He's lost his way. I'm gonna...

1355
01:38:48,335 --> 01:38:51,634
Inevitably backfired.

1356
01:38:52,306 --> 01:38:54,297
He's backlashed to the...

1357
01:38:56,377 --> 01:39:01,371
And the very person I was trying to be of some redeeming service to turns on me.

1358
01:39:02,116 --> 01:39:04,914
I'm the enemy. You know?

1359
01:39:07,855 --> 01:39:09,152
A stranger.

1360
01:39:10,557 --> 01:39:11,717
And...

1361
01:39:13,193 --> 01:39:15,821
I don't know who to fault.

1362
01:39:15,896 --> 01:39:21,095
I can't see any outcome to support.

1363
01:39:25,806 --> 01:39:28,434
Can't believe in anything worthwhile.

1364
01:39:32,313 --> 01:39:35,680
Done trying. I resign. I resign.

1365
01:39:36,617 --> 01:39:38,278
From everything.

1366
01:39:38,886 --> 01:39:40,854
It's... It's official.

1367
01:39:48,562 --> 01:39:50,962
You couldn't stop that earthquake.

1368
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:59,667
You can't fix LA in just...

1369
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:04,003
And you're never gonna cure Nathaniel.

1370
01:40:09,283 --> 01:40:11,843
Just be his friend and show up.

1371
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:35,897
Good? I'll be right here if you need me.

1372
01:41:48,315 --> 01:41:50,283
...go, next to the gold store.

1373
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:53,080
You know what I mean. He wanted to drink and everything.

1374
01:41:53,153 --> 01:41:55,348
Okay, okay, okay. Bitch, slow down.

1375
01:41:56,223 --> 01:42:00,353
Do you still love me? Like you did at the start?

1376
01:42:00,427 --> 01:42:02,156
I ain't playing with you.

1377
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:04,322
I'm saying I do.

1378
01:42:04,398 --> 01:42:07,094
It means you and me together forever.

1379
01:42:08,902 --> 01:42:12,770
So that's why I'm saying I do.

1380
01:42:14,274 --> 01:42:17,607
- I love you, Lois. - I love you, too, Darryl.

1381
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:23,907
Disguise himself now as...

1382
01:42:23,984 --> 01:42:28,751
They disguise themselves... Where is Los Angeles?

1383
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:31,020
Cleveland?

1384
01:42:34,394 --> 01:42:35,691
And...

1385
01:43:00,687 --> 01:43:02,177
We...

1386
01:43:07,828 --> 01:43:09,989
We had some life, didn't we?

1387
01:43:13,667 --> 01:43:14,998
Yeah.

1388
01:43:16,036 --> 01:43:17,264
Yeah.

1389
01:44:01,815 --> 01:44:04,409
<i>Beethoven's Triple Concerto, right?</i>

1390
01:44:04,918 --> 01:44:06,783
- Yeah. - It's a good one.

1391
01:44:09,122 --> 01:44:10,350
I liked it.

1392
01:44:10,791 --> 01:44:14,727
Mr. Ayers, I'm gonna give your sister a ride to the hotel.

1393
01:44:14,795 --> 01:44:17,320
You don't have to call me that, Mr. Lopez.

1394
01:44:17,397 --> 01:44:21,424
I know. I want to. I should have been calling you that all along.

1395
01:44:22,069 --> 01:44:24,003
I said such terrible things to you, Mr. Lopez.

1396
01:44:24,071 --> 01:44:27,837
I... I hate myself for saying those things.

1397
01:44:27,908 --> 01:44:30,399
Sometimes friends piss each other off, right?

1398
01:44:30,477 --> 01:44:32,342
It's part of the deal.

1399
01:44:32,779 --> 01:44:38,547
I can't imagine that you would want to be my friend after I said all those things.

1400
01:44:38,685 --> 01:44:39,845
I just...

1401
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,251
Mr. Ayers,

1402
01:44:43,523 --> 01:44:45,753
I'm honored to be your friend.

<i>A year ago, I met a man who was down on his luck</i>

1405
01:45:11,385 --> 01:45:14,218
<i>and thought I might be able to help him.</i>

1406
01:45:14,288 --> 01:45:16,256
<i>I don't know that I have.</i>

1407
01:45:16,623 --> 01:45:18,989
<i>Yes, my friend Mr. Ayers now sleeps inside.</i>

1408
01:45:19,059 --> 01:45:21,619
<i>He has a key. He has a bed.</i>

1409
01:45:22,763 --> 01:45:25,459
<i>But his mental state, and his well-being,</i>

1410
01:45:25,532 --> 01:45:28,763
<i>are as precarious now as they were the day we met.</i>

1411
01:45:32,172 --> 01:45:34,970
<i>There are people who tell me I've helped him.</i>

1412
01:45:35,042 --> 01:45:37,306
<i>Mental health experts who say</i>

1413
01:45:37,377 --> 01:45:41,677
<i>that the simple act of being someone's friend can change his brain chemistry,</i>

1414
01:45:41,748 --> 01:45:44,376
<i>improve his functioning in the world.</i>

1415
01:45:45,152 --> 01:45:48,053
<i>I can't speak for Mr. Ayers in that regard.</i>

1416
01:45:48,322 --> 01:45:51,587
<i>Maybe our friendship has helped him. But maybe not.</i>

1417
01:45:54,094 --> 01:45:56,528
<i>I can, however, speak for myself.</i>

1418
01:45:57,364 --> 01:46:00,800
<i>I can tell you that by witnessing Mr. Ayers's courage,</i>

1419
01:46:01,268 --> 01:46:05,204
<i>his humility, his faith in the power of his art,</i>

1420
01:46:07,341 --> 01:46:11,107
<i>I've learned the dignity of being loyal to something you believe in.</i>

1421
01:46:11,178 --> 01:46:14,477
<i>Of holding onto it, above all else.</i>

1422
01:46:14,548 --> 01:46:19,713
<i>Of believing, without question, that it will carry you home.</i>
