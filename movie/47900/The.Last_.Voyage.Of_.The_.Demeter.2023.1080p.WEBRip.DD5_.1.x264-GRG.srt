1
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:10,363
Constable, a boat's blown in
with the storm.

2
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,045
God.

3
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:25,942
Come on!

4
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:38,114
Fletcher?

5
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:44,765
I went aboard, sir,
to see if anyone was alive.

6
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,701
And?

7
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,405
What's that?

8
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:54,223
Captain's log.

9
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,080
<i>This log is a record</i>

10
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,580
<i>and a warning.</i>

11
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:04,484
<i>And if it finds you,</i>
<i>God help you,</i>

12
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,388
<i>as he has abandoned</i>
<i>the</i> Demeter.

13
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,925
<i>We tried to stop him.</i>

14
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,368
<i>If we didn't succeed,</i>

15
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,295
<i>God have mercy on your souls.</i>

16
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,637
I can't go back, sir.

17
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,473
Come on.

19
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,676
Hey!

20
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,163
Hey, mister! Sit down!
It's your turn.

21
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,032
Come on, wake up.

22
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,767
Let's go back home.

23
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:38,939
Oppa!

24
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,313
<i>Sixth of July,</i>

25
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,050
<i>made port in Varna, Bulgaria.</i>

26
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,719
Don't wander far, Toby.
We're not staying long.

27
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,755
I won't, Grandpa. I promise.

28
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,159
<i>Our crew was a few hands short.</i>

29
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,626
Captain.

30
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,661
<i>And I have tasked Mr. Wojchek</i>

31
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,799
<i>to remedy this</i>
<i>before we take on cargo.</i>

32
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:11,638
The <i>Demeter</i> is looking for
hands all the way to England.

33
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,707
I fold.

34
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,977
Open your ears, men.

35
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:20,714
<i>Demeter</i> needs
three able-bodied seamen.

36
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,117
Bound for London.
We pay in gold.

37
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,919
I'm able.

38
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,954
And strong as an ox.

39
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,363
Who are you, boy?

40
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,698
Clemens.

41
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,702
You dress like an educated man.
Where did you go to school?

42
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,938
University of Cambridge.

43
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,875
I have a steady hand
with a needle, and, uh...

44
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,344
I have supplies if you're
in need of a ship doctor.

45
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,879
I-It's been a while,

46
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,115
but I-I do know
my way around a boat, if not.

47
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,817
Learning about boats ain't
the same as keeping one afloat.

48
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:59,920
What did the sailor
ever learn from a book

49
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:02,289
that did him an ounce of good
when he was lost at sea?

50
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:04,925
Astronomy, for one.

51
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,796
Can lose a chart.
You can lose a compass.

52
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,965
But you can't lose
the stars, can you?

53
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:14,335
Never met an Englishman in such
a hurry to return to England.

54
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,237
Be gone as soon as we reach it,
no doubt.

55
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,775
We need strong crew,
not passengers.

56
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,377
Me?

57
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,046
You.

58
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,048
No, never mind you.

59
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,972
What's he saying?

60
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,441
He says they cannot stay.

61
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,976
The hell they can't.

62
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,811
We need their hands
or we lose the tide.

63
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:00,080
He says they need to leave
before the sun sinks.

64
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,983
What kind of nonsense is that?

65
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,292
For your men.

66
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,228
We go now.

67
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,041
Men!

68
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:34,415
This is more than I paid
to bring the damn cargo here.

69
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,350
What did he spit at the end?

70
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,052
"Good leave"
or "good riddance"?

71
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,287
"Good luck."

72
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:50,497
Come on, pull!

73
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,466
Pull!

74
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,934
Come on, pull!

75
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,504
Pull!

76
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,306
Come on, pull!

77
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:01,942
Pull!

78
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,157
See, let go. Let go!

79
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,167
Toby!

80
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,270
Are you all right, boy?

81
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:05,005
Toby?

82
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,108
Mr. Wojchek, hold that man!

83
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:11,145
You never said
nothing about dragons.

84
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,914
I know this mark.

85
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,916
It is a bad omen.

86
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,518
You could have killed the boy.

87
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,420
I don't give a whore's ass
about dragons!

88
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:23,557
Keep your gold,
the devil's serpent.

89
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,192
God save you all.

90
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,394
May he save the ship.

91
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:29,830
May he save the crew.

92
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,467
Are you all right?

93
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,169
-You injured?
-Mm-mm.

94
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,842
-Thank you, Mr. Clemens.
-Yeah, sure.

95
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,288
We leave port within the hour.

96
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,357
You prove to be lying about
knowing your way around a boat,

97
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,460
I'll throw you off the boat
myself, astronomer.

98
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,062
Uh, th-thank you, sir.

99
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:04,631
Larsen, get this stinking bunch
of cockroaches underway.

100
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,533
You heard Mr. Wojchek.

101
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,336
Olgaren,
get those crates stowed.

102
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,387
Come on.

103
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,989
Good boy!

104
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,501
Cast off! Ready the headsails.

105
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,670
Pull in the moorings!

106
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,139
Be quick about it!

107
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,113
Pull!

108
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:54,716
-Pull! -WOJCHEK: Give me
a way to steer.

109
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:57,518
She moves like a fat pig
with all this weight.

110
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,995
Do you see that beam up there?

111
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,298
That's where they used to hang
pirates and mutineers.

112
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,333
Have you ever seen
a real dead man, Mr. Clemens?

113
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,702
I have.

114
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,970
-Really?
-Let me show you the ship.

115
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,074
Captain's cabin's
that big door.

116
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,676
There's lots of maps
and drawings in there,

117
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,479
but captain
doesn't like me fiddling.

118
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:01,048
This here is Huckleberry.

119
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,717
-Oh.
-But we just call him Huck.

120
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,118
Hello, Huck.

121
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:07,722
That's the cargo hold.

122
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:10,524
Everything there is
headed for London.

123
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,160
You knock on wood like this
if there's any trouble.

124
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:16,663
Or to signal a change of watch
or if the sky's looking fierce.

125
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:18,665
You can hear it
all the way from the bunks

126
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,667
to the captain's
on a clear night.

127
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:22,402
-I swear.
-Mm.

128
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,504
I've heard it.

129
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,439
Yes, I believe you have.

130
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,040
This is where we eat.

131
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,776
This used to be a lumber ship,
built the old way.

132
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,712
But now everyone wants
steam ships.

133
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:33,180
Captain says there's no joy
in metal ships.

134
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,782
Well, that's the thing
about progress, innit?

135
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:38,685
It cares not for joy,
your captain's or otherwise.

136
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,555
The <i>Demeter's</i> a fine boat.
No doubt.

137
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,557
Meet my crew, Mr. Clemens.

138
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,293
The faster we eat them,

139
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,061
the less crap
I have to clean up.

140
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,731
Mm.

141
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:51,833
Ah-ah, Huck.
You know the rules.

142
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:54,702
And up here is the galley.

143
00:13:54,736 --> 00:13:56,603
-Joseph.
-Huh?

144
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,205
This here is Clemens.

145
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,340
He's a doctor. A real one.

146
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,745
We eat at six bells--
no sooner, no later.

147
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:05,479
You stay out of the galley.

148
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,148
And I won't serve any man who
takes the Lord's name in vain.

149
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,083
-He means that last one.
-I mean all of them.

150
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,820
Do you know
who Saint Nicholas is?

151
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:15,055
Patron saint of sailors.

152
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,092
Well, you're not a heathen.

153
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,295
Thank the Lord
for small favors.

154
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,298
Toby, show him to his quarters.

155
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,233
And get this mutt
out of my kitchen.

156
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,668
Huck!

157
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,169
<i>On sixth July,</i>

158
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,238
<i>we finished taking in cargo--</i>

159
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,841
<i>Turkish cotton,</i>
<i>ten barrels of petroleum</i>

160
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,677
<i>and private crates</i>
<i>marked for London--</i>

161
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,178
<i>with nine hands.</i>

162
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,447
<i>Crew of five, one ship doctor,</i>

163
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,450
<i>two mates, cook</i>
<i>and myself, captain.</i>

164
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,319

Wheel's kicking a bit,

179
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,239
I'm going to buy
a little cottage in Ireland.

180
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,375
Toby will enjoy
the countryside.

I wouldn't let the sea air

Sir, I...

You're a good seaman,

-Gonna get myself

197
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:29,549
a proper shave and one of them
waistcoats with the tails on.

198
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,919
Ooh, the English ladies
love them tails.

199
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:34,654
Almost... almost as much
as they love me.

200
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,991
If you put them
over your face, mm, maybe.

201
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:38,458
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

You're the funny ones,

will be made rich,

and he who waters
will also be watered himself."

206
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,304
Although the Lord
might not mind

207
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,808
if I just simply
watered myself.

208
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,011
Oi! 75!

209
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:58,678
Do you know
what I will do this much?

210
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:01,082
The same thing
that you always do, Petrofsky.

211
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:03,350
Find the nearest brothel
and spend the next month

212
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,418
absolutely up to
your gills in...

213
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,054
Mr. Abrams, if you please.

214
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,655
Apologies, Captain.

215
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,958
- Forgot about the lad.
- I'm almost nine.

216
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:12,794
I know
what a brothel is, anyway.

217
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:13,961
Do you, now?

218
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:15,629
Yeah.

219
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,799
It's a place we pay women
to take off their knickers.

220
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,968
Ah, I love kids!

221
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:22,804
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

222
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:23,905
Well, isn't it?

223
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,338
Oh, close enough, lad.

224
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,074
Close enough.

225
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,811
Well, Mr. Clemens,
what about you?

226
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:31,879
-Sir?
-Our charter has agreed

227
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,513
to pay a sizable bonus

228
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,083
for timely arrival
of his cargo in London.

229
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:37,551
You're part of the crew,

230
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,087
which means you earn
a crewman's share.

231
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,688
How do you plan spending it?

232
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:45,625
A new petticoat, perhaps?

233
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,460
Well, everything I desire
in this life, unfortunately,

234
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,096
coin will be of no aid.

235
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,966
And what would that be, now?

236
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:53,968
To understand this world.

237
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:57,839
The more of it I see,
the less any of it makes sense.

238
00:18:57,872 --> 00:19:01,474
The world cares little
for sense, Mr. Clemens.

239
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,578
Perhaps it is not meant
to be understood

240
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,782
but rather experienced
and accepted.

241
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:12,954
Perhaps.

242
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,824
But I need to get
to the heart of it.

243
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:19,126
And understand why

244
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,497
the world has so much goodness
inside it and yet...

245
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,905
Isn't that
what all men desire, mm?

246
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,574
Deep down.

247
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:38,145
Well, hell, he's right.

248
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:40,181
I'll have his share, then.

249
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,152
What the devil is that?

250
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:48,421
Toby. See to the livestock.

251
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,627
Toby?

252
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,069
What's gotten into them?

253
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,638
It's probably just the weather.

254
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,539
Hey, they can sense
a storm coming.

255
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,486
Toby, give me a hand with this.

256
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,522
That should put them to rest.

257
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,236
What was that, Mr. Clemens?

258
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,871
Fetch the captain, lad.

259
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,539
Tell him something fell
in the cargo hold.

260
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,727
Stay with me.

261
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:42,963
Stay with me.

262
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:45,698
Come on.

263
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:50,137
-What in the seven hells?
-She was below deck.

264
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:53,707
A stowaway.

265
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:56,343
A stowaway who is going to die

266
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:58,578
if we don't administer
proper medical care.

267
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:04,885
You want to help her?

268
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,223
Who knows what kind of diseased
rat infections she has...

269
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:10,991
-Captain.
-What do you need?

270
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,326
Her body's infected.

271
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,861
I need to attempt
a transfusion.

272
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,863
-What are you babbling?
-A blood transfusion.

273
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,966
She needs blood
to fight the infection.

274
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:20,734
You're joking.

275
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:23,670
You are of aid to me or you are
in my way and need to leave.

276
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,638
In either case,
please make yourself apparent

277
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:27,208
and fulfill your purpose.

278
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:26,000
She'll make it the
night, but I need to continue

279
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:30,070
with the transfusions until
she has no more infected blood.

280
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:33,440
We've done all we can.

281
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:35,476
Then maybe she'll
wake up in time to see us

282
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,978
toss her to the waves.

283
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:41,815
We let Poseidon deal
with stowaways-- always have.

284
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:45,319
I didn't save this girl's life
only to watch you end it.

285
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:47,321
At least let us off
at the next port.

286
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:48,889
"Us," is it?

287
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:52,493
I see where your loyalty lies,
Mr. Clemens.

288
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:55,763
We stop, then we forfeit
the bonus wage.

289
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:58,199
And I ain't
forfeiting the bonus wage

290
00:24:58,232 --> 00:25:00,067
for you or your diseased whore.

291
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,802
Mr. Wojchek, lower your voice.

292
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,137
Control your language.

293
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,506
I would prefer not to have
my final voyage

294
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,007
at the helm of the <i>Demeter</i>

295
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,076
marred by the death
of a young woman.

296
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:11,812
Stowaway or not.

297
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,017
We will repurpose
the carpenter shed

298
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:19,220
-as the young woman's quarters.
-Thank you, sir.

299
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:22,823
And you will be solely dividing
your own rations

300
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,059
with your patient, Mr. Clemens.

301
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,748
Toby.

302
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:53,387
-You'll look after her for me,
will you? -Mm-hmm.

303
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,055
Anyone tries to see her,
you come get me

304
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:57,958
-or the captain straightaway,
you understand? -Yeah.

305
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:01,262
All right, then. Go on.
That's a good lad.

306
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,379
You're making
all sorts of friends,

307
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,047
aren't you, Mr. Clemens?

308
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,018
Woman on the ship.
Bad omen. Hmm?

309
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:25,419
Bad luck.

310
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:27,087
Men won't be happy.

311
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:29,957
The men don't need to be happy,
do they, Mr. Olgaren?

312
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,359
They just need to get this boat
to London, huh?

313
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:37,431
I'm trying to help you, son.
Keep spouting words like that.

314
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,033
Maybe she'll make it
to London, but...

315
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,601
but I reckon
you'll be swimming.

316
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:44,505
Knock if you need me.

317
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:46,473
-Saves the pipes.
-Mm.

318
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:49,076
-Understand?
-Aye!

319
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,922
Islands and rocks
everywhere here.

320
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,158
So we're in the Aegean, yes?

321
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,427
It's the Mediterranean at dawn.

322
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:09,096
It's good time, innit?

323
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:13,267
Greece should be
to our starboard.

324
00:27:57,644 --> 00:27:59,179
Mr. Olgaren?

325
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,500
Mr. Olgaren?

326
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,067
Olgaren?

327
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:09,683
Jesus Christ!

328
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:11,552
Did you see it?

329
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,086
Did no one pass by?

330
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,089
See what?
There's no one on deck but us.

331
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:19,493
There is something out there.

332
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:24,398
Someone.

333
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,538
What the...

334
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:46,313
Oh, God, Huck.

335
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:14,341
All the livestock?

336
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:22,750
Any man with knowledge
of this heinous act

337
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:27,154
needs to step forward now or
find themselves in irons later.

338
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:30,324
The girl...

339
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:32,426
Was in no shape
to do anything of the sort,

340
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:35,495
and Mr. Wojchek can attest to
that, even if he'd rather not.

341
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:37,799
Aye.

342
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:39,767
He's right on this.

343
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:42,469
She didn't need to.
We all know.

344
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:45,740
Bad luck, woman on board.

345
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:48,475
Makes skies turn,
animals go mad.

346
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:49,811
The dog was ripped into.

347
00:31:49,844 --> 00:31:53,180
Perhaps he went rabid
and was gored by

348
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,916
one of the larger livestock
as it attacked it.

349
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:57,618
You think Huck did this?

350
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:59,186
Ripped apart the animals?

351
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:01,823
No. He's a good dog.

352
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:03,523
You heard the man.

353
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:05,626
Rabies. Bad luck is all.

354
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:07,694
Push on through as we always do.

355
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:13,166
If this is an outbreak,
then we'll need to make port.

356
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,335
-Captain... -No. No. -No,
we won't make our bonus, then.

357
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,237
What are you talking about?
Then we lose the bonus wage.

358
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,538
We can't make port. No.

359
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:22,209
Mr. Clemens,
a malady of this sort,

360
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,511
could a human catch it?

361
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:33,587
No.

362
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,691
Rabies, it-it can't pass to
a human without it being bit.

363
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:43,430
Dispose of the meat.

364
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:45,933
Immediately.

365
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:47,802
I guess we say
the Lord's Prayer

366
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:50,604
over cabbage and potatoes
for the rest of our voyage.

367
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,676
Have you all been struck dumb?

368
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:01,248
It's not rabies that opened up
the livestock cages.

369
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:03,250
And there is only
two people on this boat

370
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:05,218
I have not sailed with fore now:

371
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,688
the <i>cy</i> in the toolshed

372
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:11,692
and this darky savage
pretending to be doctor.

373
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:14,461
Mm?

374
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:17,397
Say it again.

375
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,208
No man did this.

376
00:33:31,713 --> 00:33:33,815
Evil is on board.

377
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:35,482
Powerful evil.

378
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:09,784
Anna.

379
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:13,721
That bloody reeks.

380
00:34:24,598 --> 00:34:26,399
Toby?

381
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:37,812
Toby?

382
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:40,848
Hey.

383
00:34:44,051 --> 00:34:46,553
Huck was a good dog, son.

384
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:49,891
I'm sorry.

385
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:53,828
It wasn't just Huckleberry.

386
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:55,595
I promised the captain I--

387
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:59,033
It was my job
to look after them.

388
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:00,902
The animals, I mean.

389
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:03,838
I-I promised the captain.

390
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,574
Hmm.

391
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:13,714
Toby...

392
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:18,318
sometimes things go wrong,
no matter what we promise.

393
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:21,521
All right?

394
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:25,392
There are things in this world
that we can't control,

395
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:28,863
but we do our best. Hmm?

396
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,397
Yeah.

397
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,465
Thanks, Mr. Clemens.

398
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:36,603
Go on.

399
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,147
The skies are angry.

400
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:22,016
The skies
feel nothing, my friend.

401
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:24,684
It's precipitation
and air pressure,

402
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,088
as knowable as
the workings of this ship.

403
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,757
I saw something last night.

404
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,893
There is something unnatural
on board with us.

405
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,694
I'm afraid I don't believe
in superstitions, Mr. Olgaren.

406
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:38,900
I believe in science
and in nature.

407
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:40,467
And in Saint Nicholas,

408
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,769
since Joseph wouldn't
give me food otherwise.

409
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:43,037
Keep your science.

410
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,639
I saw your face
in the dark last night.

411
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:47,708
Your eyes.

412
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:52,545
You saw it, same as I.

413
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:02,790
<i>16th of July.</i>

414
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:07,627
<i>Rough weather last three days</i>
<i>and all hands busy with sails.</i>

415
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,064
<i>Our ship's doctor continues</i>

416
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:13,200
<i>to administer regular</i>
<i>transfusions to our stowaway,</i>

417
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:17,038
<i>yet her condition</i>
<i>remains unchanged.</i>

418
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:19,941
<i>Food is running sparse,</i>

419
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:22,076
<i>men downcast,</i>

420
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:24,611
<i>and now past Cape Matapan,</i>

421
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:27,580
<i>we've more than two weeks</i>
<i>to travel.</i>

422
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:32,086
Her name is Anna.

423
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,188
She told you that?

424
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:35,689
Has she been awake?

425
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:37,825
Mr. Olgaren taught me
some Romani.

426
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:40,728
She speaks some English
sometimes, too.

427
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:46,801
She didn't say this one
so much, but...

428
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:49,602
I don't think
she's having very nice dreams.

429
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:54,275
She repeats a word
over and over.

430
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:57,677
"Feed."

431
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:12,960
Can't sleep?

432
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:16,797
You noticed it, too, then.

433
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:23,137
The rats.

434
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,772
Still quiet.

435
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,941
I was checking the larder.
They're all gone.

436
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:30,144
Gone? What do you mean gone?

437
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,146
I mean what I say. Gone.

438
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:35,249
Always a dozen or so
in the woodwork,

439
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:38,119
screeching, scrabbling.

440
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:39,920
Well, if... if Huck went rabid,

441
00:38:39,954 --> 00:38:42,289
perhaps, before the livestock,
he drove them off...

442
00:38:42,323 --> 00:38:46,227
You could burn this ship
to the keel, Mr. Clemens,

443
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,864
and the rats would
just nest in the ashes.

444
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:56,837
Something drove them off.

445
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:06,247
A boat without rats,

446
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,083
such a thing is against nature.

447
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:33,174
Abrams?

448
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:38,611
Playing some kind
of fool's joke.

449
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:44,617
Idiots playing games, huh?

450
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,721
Abrams?

451
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:14,041
Where the hell
did you come from?

452
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:34,188
Petrofsky?

453
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:15,429
The knife was found here?

454
00:43:15,462 --> 00:43:17,398
And the wheel was tied off?

455
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:19,300
Petrofsky must have been drunk.

456
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:22,536
Slipped on the deck
and fell overboard.

457
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:25,005
Right after he bled
all over the deck?

458
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,876
And what were you doing up
in the middle of the night?

459
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:31,345
You had his knife in your hand
when we found you.

460
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:33,914
Of course. I-I killed him.

461
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,316
And somehow managed
to keep myself

462
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:37,318
free of all the blood
you see staining the boards,

463
00:43:37,351 --> 00:43:39,486
then I rang the signal bell
to report myself.

464
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,188
It's quite brilliant,
innit, Mr. Wojchek?

465
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:42,289
Open-and-shut case.

466
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:58,038
Captain, the dog's body,
I examined it.

467
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:01,275
It wasn't killed in the larder
like the other animals.

468
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:05,245
It had bite marks on its neck.
All the animals did.

469
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:08,615
What exactly are you
suggesting, Mr. Clemens?

470
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:10,884
I don't know, sir,

471
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:12,953
but their arteries were
ripped open, and then they...

472
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,254
He's here.

473
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,991
He is here.

474
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:20,127
We have to get off this boat.
Now!

475
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,229
All of us!
We have to get off this boat!

476
00:44:22,262 --> 00:44:24,131
- Mr. Clemens, restrain
your patient. -

477
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:26,467
-Now! He will kill us all!
-Please! Anna, please!

478
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,935
-Anna, please! Please!
-Kill us all!

479
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:30,371
Get off the boat.

480
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:39,346
Captain will say a few words
from the good book,

481
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,181
and we'll get on with things.

482
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:42,983
There's not enough liquor
on board to get Petrofsky

483
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,518
-drunk enough to fall off...
-Mr. Abrams.

484
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,220
Are we not gonna listen to
the lass and what she just...

485
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:48,956
I'll spend no more time
discussing anything

486
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:52,993
but the state of this boat
and the weather.

487
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:56,230
Understood, Mr. Abrams?
Get to work.

488
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:03,570
<i>18th of July.</i>

489
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:05,239
<i>Men reported in the morning</i>

490
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:08,108
<i>that one of the crew,</i>
<i>Petrofsky, was missing.</i>

491
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:11,145
<i>I had the men do</i>
<i>a thorough search of the ship.</i>

492
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:13,046
<i>This after Olgaren confided</i>

493
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,117
<i>that he had seen something</i>
<i>strange nights before.</i>

494
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:27,594
These blood transfusions

495
00:45:27,628 --> 00:45:30,464
should keep your infection
under control.

496
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:37,237
So, what were you trying
to tell us out there?

497
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:43,310
He is here on the ship.

498
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:45,212
He has been all along.

499
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,482
He?

500
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:55,589
Okay.

501
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:58,592
I can't help you
if you don't speak to me

502
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:02,229
and tell me what happened,
why we found you below deck.

503
00:46:06,734 --> 00:46:11,171
It is spoken in my village
of an evil

504
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:14,141
that lives
in the mountains above.

505
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:18,645
A castle older than any of us.

506
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:21,582
-Evil?
-An evil that appears as a man

507
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:23,617
when it wants to hide
its true nature.

508
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,354
And at night, he feeds
on the blood of the innocent.

509
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:31,191
I have lived in the shadow
of that castle my whole life.

510
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:35,262
I knew that the elders, they...

511
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:40,100
they made bargains
for the safety of our people.

512
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:41,769
You were given to this man?

513
00:46:41,803 --> 00:46:44,404
-It is not a man.
-Then an animal?

514
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:47,441
No, it is not
some mindless animal either.

515
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,142
Do not make that mistake.

516
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:53,380
We call him Dracula.

517
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:56,617
And you-you believe
that he brought you on board?

518
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:01,555
Why?

519
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:16,270
He brought me here to feed.

520
00:47:16,303 --> 00:47:18,038
Dear God.

521
00:47:20,742 --> 00:47:23,443
He is here, Mr. Clemens.

522
00:47:24,846 --> 00:47:29,216
<i>The thing that wears</i>
<i>the skin of a man.</i>

523
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:31,552
<i>In the night,</i>
<i>it drinks our blood,</i>

524
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:33,821
and he is on this ship.

525
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:36,390
Which means
that we will never leave it.

526
00:47:47,601 --> 00:47:49,503
The woman,

527
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:52,239
she seems harmless, but...

528
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:55,409
ever since she came on board,
I wonder if...

529
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:59,112
if we would have been better
just to let the ocean have her.

530
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:03,650
But then I think about
my daughter.

531
00:48:06,353 --> 00:48:09,189
She's around her age and...

532
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:11,558
smart and-and pretty.

533
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:42,750
Olgaren?

534
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:53,193
Olgaren?

535
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:13,915
What's wrong?
I heard your knock.

536
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:15,850
My knock?

537
00:51:02,562 --> 00:51:04,631
Please, no!

538
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,646
Please, no.

539
00:51:47,507 --> 00:51:48,876
Pull, you bastards!

540
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,077
Pull!

541
00:52:02,023 --> 00:52:03,825
Abrams!

542
00:52:03,858 --> 00:52:06,359
Where the devil is Larsen?!

543
00:52:09,163 --> 00:52:11,999
-Larsen! Larsen!
-Larsen! Larsen!

544
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:14,701
-Olgaren!
-Larsen!

545
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:21,341
Larsen!

546
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:24,712
-Larsen!
-Larsen!

547
00:52:24,745 --> 00:52:27,347
Larsen!

548
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:04,451
That's it.

549
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:06,686
Olgaren, where's Larsen?

550
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:09,489
Olgaren. Hey.

551
00:53:09,522 --> 00:53:10,657
There he is.

552
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,760
Hold him!

553
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:13,761
Guys!

554
00:53:17,164 --> 00:53:19,666
<i>24th of July.</i>

555
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:23,503
<i>There seems some doom</i>
<i>over the ship,</i>

556
00:53:23,536 --> 00:53:26,573
<i>already a hand short</i>
<i>entering the Bay of Biscay</i>

557
00:53:26,606 --> 00:53:28,642
<i>with wild weather ahead.</i>

558
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:34,447
<i>And last night, a second man</i>
<i>lost and another man injured.</i>

559
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:37,051
<i>A strange injury.</i>

560
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:40,587
<i>Men all in a panic of fear.</i>

561
00:53:41,956 --> 00:53:43,958
<i>We are 18 days at sea.</i>

562
00:53:43,991 --> 00:53:46,928
<i>The closest port is England.</i>

563
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:51,933
<i>We must put our trust in God</i>
<i>and go forward.</i>

564
00:53:59,173 --> 00:54:00,775
<i>He's cold as ice.</i>

565
00:54:00,808 --> 00:54:04,544
He makes noises and he moves,
but his eyes won't open.

566
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:07,014
Like he's unable to wake
from some dream.

567
00:54:07,048 --> 00:54:08,581
But what happened to his neck?

568
00:54:08,615 --> 00:54:10,051
And what was he doing
in the rigging?

569
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:12,519
Anything could have happened.

570
00:54:12,552 --> 00:54:16,724
Perhaps some rigging
wrapped around his throat.

571
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:18,159
No. No, no, no.

572
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:19,860
This looks like a bite.

573
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:22,229
It looks like the same bites
we saw in the animals,

574
00:54:22,263 --> 00:54:24,265
the same bites that ravaged the
girl in the carpenter's shed.

575
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:26,934
You think some devil did this?

576
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:28,970
Like she says?

577
00:54:29,003 --> 00:54:30,871
I...

578
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,576
...do not.

579
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:38,980
-Good.
-But something did.

580
00:54:40,114 --> 00:54:42,283
And that is real and on board,

581
00:54:42,316 --> 00:54:45,485
whether we choose
to believe in it or not.

582
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:53,560
From now on,

583
00:54:53,593 --> 00:54:57,865
I want two men
for every watch, armed.

584
00:54:57,898 --> 00:55:00,567
No exceptions.

585
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,070
Search the ship, Mr. Wojchek.

586
00:55:04,637 --> 00:55:07,241
Not just the hold.

587
00:55:07,274 --> 00:55:08,743
Everywhere.

588
00:55:55,956 --> 00:55:57,858
All right, Toby.

589
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:01,896
You have quite the task.

590
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:08,369
A captain...

591
00:56:08,402 --> 00:56:10,905
is only as good as his spyglass.

592
00:56:11,972 --> 00:56:14,742
Can I trust you
to shine it up for me?

593
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,711
If it's too much to...

594
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:19,080
No.

595
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:23,050
I mean, no, sir.

596
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:25,953
I can do it, I swear.

597
00:56:26,954 --> 00:56:28,089
Good lad.

598
00:56:29,256 --> 00:56:31,691
I'll be back soon.

599
00:56:32,293 --> 00:56:35,595
Toby, lock the door.

600
00:56:43,437 --> 00:56:45,638
I don't like this.

601
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:48,742
Sun's going down,
and he'll be coming.

602
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:50,070
Hello?

603
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:34,949
Mr. Olgaren, you're up.

604
00:58:39,053 --> 00:58:40,955
Mister...?

605
00:59:49,189 --> 00:59:50,924
Mr. Olgaren?

606
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:02,903
Mr. Olgaren,
will you please go away?

607
01:00:46,246 --> 01:00:48,849
Please.

608
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:55,489
That's every mast.

609
01:00:55,522 --> 01:00:58,892
Any other strokes of genius,
Mr. Clemens?

610
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:16,877
Do you hear that?

611
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:19,012
What?

612
01:01:28,288 --> 01:01:30,057
Oh, my God.

613
01:01:32,593 --> 01:01:34,328
Help!

614
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:38,966
Help!

615
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,446
Toby! Toby!

616
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:31,452
Olgaren?

617
01:02:35,122 --> 01:02:36,356
Olgaren?

618
01:02:54,641 --> 01:02:56,243
Help!

619
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:05,452
Toby.

620
01:03:08,355 --> 01:03:09,389
Toby?

621
01:03:09,423 --> 01:03:12,226
- Toby.
- Open the door!

622
01:03:21,401 --> 01:03:22,669
Toby, open the door.

623
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:37,384
Toby?

624
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:38,720
Open the door!

625
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,259
Open the door.

626
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:46,159
Toby?

627
01:03:46,193 --> 01:03:48,695
Open the-- Toby! Toby!

628
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,464
Toby!

629
01:03:55,202 --> 01:03:56,270
- Toby!
- Toby!

630
01:03:56,303 --> 01:03:57,739
I can't reach the lock.

631
01:03:57,772 --> 01:03:59,573
Toby!

632
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:10,083
Toby!

633
01:04:11,585 --> 01:04:13,086
-Toby!
-Toby!

634
01:04:27,601 --> 01:04:29,837
Toby! Toby!

635
01:04:41,816 --> 01:04:43,851
Toby! Toby!

636
01:04:43,885 --> 01:04:45,285
Move!

637
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:51,124
- Toby!
- Toby!

638
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:56,463
Toby!

639
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:00,100
Toby!

640
01:05:06,808 --> 01:05:08,642
Toby?

641
01:05:08,675 --> 01:05:11,545
Toby. Toby.

642
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:12,880
Oh, my God.

643
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,583
You will be fine, my boy.

644
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:54,822
Everything will be fine.

645
01:05:54,856 --> 01:05:57,691
Mr. Clemens
will take care of us.

646
01:06:04,832 --> 01:06:06,366
<i>August 1st.</i>

647
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,670
<i>We must be past</i>
<i>the Strait of Dover.</i>

648
01:06:09,703 --> 01:06:12,673
<i>Still five days to London.</i>

649
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:16,677
<i>God seems to have deserted us,</i>

650
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:21,181
<i>and we are drifting</i>
<i>to some terrible doom.</i>

651
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:24,685
<i>Lord help us.</i>

652
01:06:27,587 --> 01:06:29,589
He's mad.

653
01:06:29,623 --> 01:06:30,958
As if possessed.

654
01:06:30,992 --> 01:06:32,960
Possessed by
that beast? -Oh, no, no.

655
01:06:32,994 --> 01:06:35,562
Not in the way you mean,
at least.

656
01:06:35,595 --> 01:06:38,498
It's like a poison or...

657
01:06:38,532 --> 01:06:39,734
an infection.

658
01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:42,302
Infection?

659
01:06:42,335 --> 01:06:45,238
Not like any I've ever seen.

660
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:50,778
I can feel it.

661
01:06:50,812 --> 01:06:52,579
Olgaren?

662
01:06:52,612 --> 01:06:54,214
Can you hear me?

663
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:58,285
I can hear everything.

664
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:03,490
The sea.

665
01:07:03,523 --> 01:07:05,358
The wind.

666
01:07:05,392 --> 01:07:07,762
The blood pumping in your veins.

667
01:07:13,034 --> 01:07:15,235
It burns.

668
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:20,373
Burn?
Maybe he needs some water.

669
01:07:21,909 --> 01:07:24,511
It burns.

670
01:07:25,378 --> 01:07:27,014
Olgaren?

671
01:07:27,048 --> 01:07:28,582
Burns.

672
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:36,490
It burns! It burns!

673
01:07:38,391 --> 01:07:40,627
It burns!

674
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,629
It burns!

675
01:08:36,017 --> 01:08:37,819
Oh, for God's sake.

676
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:40,755
Will someone say something?

677
01:08:43,456 --> 01:08:46,093
What the hell happened to him?

678
01:08:46,127 --> 01:08:48,562
I warned you.

679
01:08:48,595 --> 01:08:51,833
I warned all you, didn't I?

680
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:54,969
It is a punishment
brought down for our sins.

681
01:08:55,002 --> 01:08:56,403
Petrofsky, a criminal.

682
01:08:56,436 --> 01:08:58,906
Olgaren, gypsy heathen.

683
01:08:58,940 --> 01:08:59,974
A whoremonger, a lecher.

684
01:09:00,007 --> 01:09:01,742
And from Gomorrah herself...

685
01:09:01,776 --> 01:09:05,545
Oh, will you shut the hell up,
you bleedin' idiot!

686
01:09:09,516 --> 01:09:13,921
Abrams, take the morning watch.

687
01:09:13,955 --> 01:09:15,857
And, Joseph, you are
to relieve him when he's...

688
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:18,893
That child will be the next
to rise up from death.

689
01:09:18,926 --> 01:09:22,797
Satan's black blood pumping
corruption through his veins.

690
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:25,933
God's anger has come upon
this vessel like Jonah...

691
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:27,701
Just shut it up!

692
01:09:27,735 --> 01:09:30,670
See to the supplies.

693
01:09:35,575 --> 01:09:37,745
Whatever was in Olgaren...

694
01:09:39,814 --> 01:09:42,116
...it's fair to assume
it is in the boy.

695
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:43,784
He has all the same symptoms.

696
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:46,486
But your blood transfusions
saved the girl.

697
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:48,421
Not Toby.

698
01:09:48,455 --> 01:09:51,158
He's smaller. He's weaker.

699
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:54,896
The wound was worse,
and the blood loss is greater.

700
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:56,898
Just...

701
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:59,499
I don't know. I think, uh...

702
01:10:03,738 --> 01:10:07,008
I think we might
have to start discussing...

703
01:10:14,215 --> 01:10:15,750
Go on.

704
01:10:17,084 --> 01:10:20,520
Look him in the eye
when you do it.

705
01:10:20,553 --> 01:10:23,690
That's not what I meant.
That is not what I meant.

706
01:10:23,724 --> 01:10:25,860
It has to be hiding here.
If we can find it,

707
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,062
I think we might be able to
figure out a way to save him...

708
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,065
Are you sure the boy is
the one that's on your mind?

709
01:10:31,098 --> 01:10:32,833
Get to your bunk.

710
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:35,970
We're running out of men
for the watch at this rate.

711
01:11:01,262 --> 01:11:02,897
Anna.

712
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:11,973
You're going to open
the crates, aren't you?

713
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:13,274
Yes.

714
01:11:13,307 --> 01:11:15,743
Go back to the shed
and bolt the door.

715
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:18,079
We are all trapped
on the same ship, Mr. Clemens.

716
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:21,581
Are you forgetting it needs
to feed because you saved me?

717
01:11:21,614 --> 01:11:23,516
I'm coming with you.

718
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:26,787
This thing has killed
most the crew.

719
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:30,057
Then imagine what it will do
if we let it get to London.

720
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:34,527
Let's go.

721
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:42,702
If we do find your devil,
will bullets kill it?

722
01:11:44,604 --> 01:11:47,607
He has controlled my village
for generations.

723
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,543
Do you think I have
any notion how to kill him?

724
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,548
I never liked guns.

725
01:11:55,582 --> 01:11:57,785
I want you to have...

726
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:10,064
Let's see. Sixth of July.

727
01:12:10,097 --> 01:12:13,200
Private cargo consigned
for Carfax Abbey in London.

728
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:16,070
Doesn't say the owner.

729
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:43,663
He told Jonah,
and he was spared.

730
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:46,767
He was spared.

731
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:50,905
"I cried out to the Lord
because of my affliction,

732
01:12:50,938 --> 01:12:52,106
"and he answered me.

733
01:12:52,139 --> 01:12:54,308
"Out of the belly of Sheol
I cried,

734
01:12:54,341 --> 01:12:56,744
"and you heard my voice.

735
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:04,651
"For you cast me into the deep,

736
01:13:04,684 --> 01:13:07,855
into the heart of the seas."

737
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:13,727
- Why London?
- Because in my country,

738
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:15,162
there is no one left
to feed on.

739
01:13:41,288 --> 01:13:43,690
Let's start with this one.

740
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:15,122
Dirt.

741
01:14:15,156 --> 01:14:17,291
It's nothing but dirt.

742
01:14:32,506 --> 01:14:35,109
Nothing.

743
01:14:44,852 --> 01:14:47,087
This one looks different.

744
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:13,013
Look.

745
01:16:08,168 --> 01:16:10,337
We have found
where the devil sleeps.

746
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:46,340
"I cried,

747
01:16:46,373 --> 01:16:53,247
and you heard my voice."

748
01:16:56,216 --> 01:16:57,384
Oh, Lord...

749
01:16:57,418 --> 01:16:58,952
Oh, Lord.

750
01:16:58,986 --> 01:17:00,287
Oh, God.

751
01:17:00,321 --> 01:17:03,357
Oh, God.

752
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:15,436
Oh, God!

753
01:17:18,172 --> 01:17:21,008
Hey!
The starboard lifeboat's gone!

754
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:23,210
Abrams, do you see it?

755
01:17:23,243 --> 01:17:26,113
No. There's nothing here.

756
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,848
Nothing.

757
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:37,257
No.

758
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:48,268
Sir, not supposing you heard?

759
01:17:56,076 --> 01:17:59,179
You would have made
a good captain, Mr. Wojchek.

760
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:04,418
If we had just seen London.

761
01:18:18,232 --> 01:18:19,566
Mr. Wojchek.

762
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,436
How's Toby?
Shall I bring him some...

763
01:18:29,009 --> 01:18:32,346
What the hell is happening
on this ship?!

764
01:18:46,326 --> 01:18:48,695
Captain Eliot.

765
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:50,998
We've, uh...

766
01:18:51,031 --> 01:18:54,234
we've wrapped Toby's body
in canvas, sir.

767
01:18:57,604 --> 01:19:00,340
We're a doomed crew,
Mr. Clemens.

768
01:19:02,476 --> 01:19:05,045
On a doomed ship.

769
01:19:05,078 --> 01:19:07,648
We no longer plot our course.

770
01:19:07,681 --> 01:19:10,718
The devil below does.

771
01:19:10,752 --> 01:19:13,954
And we all know
where he plans to deliver us.

772
01:19:16,557 --> 01:19:18,959
To hell, Mr. Clemens.

773
01:19:19,794 --> 01:19:24,364
Each of us, one by one.

774
01:19:34,575 --> 01:19:35,743
Captain?

775
01:19:47,688 --> 01:19:50,023
Dear Lord...

776
01:19:52,794 --> 01:19:54,595
...take this sweet boy.

777
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:58,499
May he never again be hungry,

778
01:19:58,532 --> 01:20:00,534
never be cold...

779
01:20:01,803 --> 01:20:03,537
...never be scared.

780
01:20:05,672 --> 01:20:08,275
This world is
cruel and uncaring.

781
01:20:10,277 --> 01:20:13,413
May Toby find his next home
to be a kinder one.

782
01:20:14,816 --> 01:20:16,416
Amen.

783
01:20:17,384 --> 01:20:18,418
Amen.

784
01:20:19,419 --> 01:20:21,121
Amen.

785
01:20:23,725 --> 01:20:25,225
Wait.

786
01:20:28,128 --> 01:20:31,064
I saw him move. He's alive.

787
01:20:32,566 --> 01:20:37,304
Captain Eliot, the boy
has no breath in his body.

788
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:40,407
He has no heartbeat. He's gone.

789
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,609
Uh...

790
01:20:42,643 --> 01:20:45,178
Captain, you should sit.

791
01:20:45,212 --> 01:20:48,850
I tell you, he's alive.
He moved.

792
01:20:48,883 --> 01:20:51,218
Captain Eliot, please.

793
01:21:13,775 --> 01:21:15,542
No!

794
01:22:14,769 --> 01:22:18,672
Mr. Wojchek,
can I... can I speak with you?

795
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:23,176
We have a plan. If we can...

796
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,813
You seen what I seen
and you still want to plan.

797
01:22:25,847 --> 01:22:28,248
This ain't Cambridge,
astronomer.

798
01:22:28,281 --> 01:22:31,151
You can't think your way
out of this one.

799
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:34,321
I was one of
the first Black doctors

800
01:22:34,354 --> 01:22:35,890
to graduate from Cambridge
with medical degree.

801
01:22:35,923 --> 01:22:37,257
Have I told you that?

802
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:38,625
Well, that's very nice
for you...

803
01:22:38,659 --> 01:22:40,527
I applied to all the best
hospitals in the country.

804
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,263
Immediately, I was told there
were no positions available.

805
01:22:43,296 --> 01:22:46,934
I fought tooth and nail
for my education,

806
01:22:46,968 --> 01:22:49,569
and yet no one
would let me practice it.

807
01:22:49,603 --> 01:22:52,472
Finally, I was offered
a position by post.

808
01:22:52,506 --> 01:22:56,476
Royal physician to King Carol
the First of Romania.

809
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:59,479
My name,
it reached them somehow.

810
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:03,383
But the color of my skin,
it would later seem, had not.

811
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:15,529
Captain Eliot once asked me
over dinner

812
01:23:15,562 --> 01:23:17,497
what I most desired.

813
01:23:17,531 --> 01:23:20,634
I told him I wanted
the world to make sense.

814
01:23:22,737 --> 01:23:28,208
I need this world
to make sense, Mr. Wojchek.

815
01:23:29,777 --> 01:23:32,245
This beast--

816
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:36,383
and mark my words,
it is a beast--

817
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:38,518
deep down,
I need it to make sense, too.

818
01:23:38,552 --> 01:23:39,619
I need to know why

819
01:23:39,653 --> 01:23:41,989
it is the way it is
and why it does what it does.

820
01:23:42,023 --> 01:23:43,590
And then I will remind
the beast that it,

821
01:23:43,623 --> 01:23:46,828
like the world,
has absolutely no hold over me.

822
01:23:46,861 --> 01:23:48,730
And then?

823
01:23:49,629 --> 01:23:52,299
And then I want to kill
the cursed thing.

824
01:23:55,002 --> 01:23:57,537
If we barricade this cabin,

825
01:23:57,571 --> 01:24:00,607
we are a day from London
with this wind.

826
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,677
Can't set more sail,
crew what it is.

827
01:24:03,711 --> 01:24:05,780
What, you want us to
wait around, eyes in the dark,

828
01:24:05,813 --> 01:24:07,380
served up and ready for dinner?

829
01:24:07,414 --> 01:24:09,316
It ran
from our guns in the night.

830
01:24:09,349 --> 01:24:10,383
It won't risk
an outright attack.

831
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:12,352
- Running?
- It's...

832
01:24:12,385 --> 01:24:14,621
It was not running.

833
01:24:15,957 --> 01:24:17,491
It was rationing.

834
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:20,594
Rationing?

835
01:24:26,968 --> 01:24:28,903
One a night.

836
01:24:28,936 --> 01:24:32,807
Once we had hit open waters
and could no longer make port.

837
01:24:35,943 --> 01:24:38,478
It hid below deck,

838
01:24:38,512 --> 01:24:42,282
sustaining off Anna until then.

839
01:24:44,852 --> 01:24:47,420
But now it has us right where
it wants us, doesn't it?

840
01:24:47,454 --> 01:24:50,290
Like he said,
London's only a day away.

841
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:53,593
It no longer needs us.

842
01:24:53,627 --> 01:24:57,664
So we have to kill it
before it reaches the coast.

843
01:24:57,697 --> 01:24:59,332
Kill it?

844
01:24:59,366 --> 01:25:01,869
We can't even find it.

845
01:25:01,903 --> 01:25:04,071
No, we can't.

846
01:25:04,105 --> 01:25:06,439
It is why we're to set a trap.

847
01:25:06,473 --> 01:25:08,575
We must sink the ship.

848
01:25:08,608 --> 01:25:10,410
With him on it.

849
01:25:10,443 --> 01:25:11,813
Scuttle the <i>Demeter?</i>

850
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:13,781
Have you gone mad?!

851
01:25:13,815 --> 01:25:15,515
She's right.

852
01:25:15,549 --> 01:25:17,484
We set up an ambush and
leave it on the sinking ship.

853
01:25:17,517 --> 01:25:19,954
Then we can escape
on one of the lifeboats.

854
01:25:19,987 --> 01:25:22,890
If the course is right, we
should be able to make shore.

855
01:25:22,924 --> 01:25:24,524
This is my home.

856
01:25:24,558 --> 01:25:28,963
And I won't tear her apart
for this fucking thing!

857
01:25:28,996 --> 01:25:30,430
I grew up on a boat,
Mr. Wojchek.

858
01:25:30,463 --> 01:25:32,432
Just like this one.

859
01:25:32,465 --> 01:25:35,036
My father was a deckhand
his whole life.

860
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:37,404
He always told me that the...

861
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:41,374
the ship, the living part,

862
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:42,710
is the men on board.

863
01:25:42,743 --> 01:25:43,978
The crews.

864
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:46,147
The stories.

865
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,883
Everything else is
just timber and nails.

866
01:25:49,784 --> 01:25:51,484
No!

867
01:25:53,955 --> 01:25:55,555
This is my home.

868
01:25:57,959 --> 01:25:59,459
She's mine.

869
01:26:06,466 --> 01:26:08,803
It's going to be me.

870
01:26:09,636 --> 01:26:11,806
<i>We barricade the hold,</i>

871
01:26:11,839 --> 01:26:14,809
<i>so that he only has</i>
<i>one way out on deck.</i>

872
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:18,813
<i>As night falls,</i>
<i>Anna will be at the helm.</i>

873
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:20,748
<i>When it comes for her,</i>

874
01:26:20,781 --> 01:26:24,051
<i>we'll have a clear shot</i>
<i>from the crow's nest.</i>

875
01:26:24,085 --> 01:26:25,652
<i>We sink the ship</i>

876
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:28,588
<i>and send the wounded beast</i>
<i>to a watery grave.</i>

877
01:26:54,015 --> 01:26:55,783
21 July.

878
01:26:55,816 --> 01:26:57,118
Fourth August.

879
01:26:57,151 --> 01:26:59,754
It dare not touch--
You got to get Toby home.

880
01:26:59,787 --> 01:27:00,788
1830...

881
01:27:00,821 --> 01:27:01,923
Captain.

882
01:27:01,956 --> 01:27:03,824
No, uh, people need to know.

883
01:27:03,858 --> 01:27:06,227
Uh, logs.
There needs to be a record.

884
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,929
The <i>Demet</i> is lost, sir.

885
01:27:07,962 --> 01:27:09,764
We're abandoning ship.

886
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:12,867
Abandoning ship?

887
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,969
Aye, sir.

888
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:22,810
Mr. Wojchek's below deck making
preparations as we speak.

889
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:25,246
We'll leave the beast
a sinking ship

890
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:27,848
as a farewell gift.

891
01:27:31,986 --> 01:27:33,620
He comes to me.

892
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:38,726
He whispers to me
behind my own eyes.

893
01:27:41,896 --> 01:27:44,098
He can bring Toby back.

894
01:27:44,131 --> 01:27:45,967
He took him away.
He can bring him back.

895
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,600
Captain, come to your senses.

896
01:27:47,634 --> 01:27:49,070
You know that's not possible.

897
01:27:49,103 --> 01:27:51,806
Toby...

898
01:27:51,839 --> 01:27:53,240
Toby.

899
01:27:53,274 --> 01:27:56,210
I just need to bring
the <i>Demeter</i> to shore.

900
01:27:56,243 --> 01:27:58,212
I'm sorry, Mr. Clemens.

901
01:27:58,245 --> 01:28:00,580
No! -ANNA: Captain.

902
01:28:00,613 --> 01:28:01,749
You have seen him as I have.

903
01:28:01,782 --> 01:28:03,718
You know deep down
that is not all.

904
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:19,200
When I dream, sometimes...

905
01:28:19,233 --> 01:28:20,935
I remember who I was.

906
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:22,970
Before him.

907
01:28:23,004 --> 01:28:27,975
But most often, I think of
the box he kept me in.

908
01:28:29,176 --> 01:28:33,914
How every time he came for me
and tore into my flesh,

909
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:36,717
drank his fill,

910
01:28:36,751 --> 01:28:39,920
dirt would seep into
the fresh wound,

911
01:28:39,954 --> 01:28:41,122
filling me up.

912
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:44,125
You cannot sink the <i>Demeter.</i>

913
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:46,027
Picture Toby's face.

914
01:28:46,994 --> 01:28:50,064
His smile, his laugh.

915
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:53,167
And think of that dirt
filling him up, too,

916
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,303
because that's
what the devil does.

917
01:28:56,337 --> 01:29:00,640
He takes what is good
and what you love, and he...

918
01:29:00,673 --> 01:29:04,912
he uses it, and he twists it,
and he rots it from within.

919
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:09,316
Do not let him do that
to the memory of your boy.

920
01:29:48,122 --> 01:29:49,990
I will...

921
01:29:50,891 --> 01:29:54,627
I will sail the ship
out to sea.

922
01:29:57,164 --> 01:29:59,599
And when she finally goes...

923
01:30:02,002 --> 01:30:06,874
...the monster will never be
able to reach the home I knew.

924
01:30:08,409 --> 01:30:09,944
That Toby knew.

925
01:30:09,977 --> 01:30:11,178
Captain,

926
01:30:11,212 --> 01:30:14,148
there's no need for you
to stay on board the <i>Demeter.</i>

927
01:30:18,285 --> 01:30:20,888
Where would I go, Mr. Clemens?

928
01:30:43,344 --> 01:30:45,312
Do you think this'll work?

929
01:30:45,346 --> 01:30:47,181
It has to.

930
01:30:49,884 --> 01:30:52,119
There she is.

931
01:30:52,153 --> 01:30:54,054
The shores of England.

932
01:30:54,088 --> 01:30:56,457
And looks like
there's a storm blowing in.

933
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:58,691
Keep your eyes on the deck.

934
01:31:55,249 --> 01:31:57,851
I can't see a bloody thing.

935
01:32:00,354 --> 01:32:01,889
Quiet.

936
01:32:07,261 --> 01:32:08,996
You don't need to be here.

937
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:13,000
You could stay below deck
with Captain Eliot.

938
01:32:14,368 --> 01:32:16,203
Stay safe.

939
01:32:17,504 --> 01:32:20,407
We are connected,
the devil and I.

940
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:23,510
You are smart enough
to have noticed.

941
01:32:23,544 --> 01:32:26,080
I can sense him.

942
01:32:27,248 --> 01:32:29,283
Feel him somehow.

943
01:32:31,085 --> 01:32:33,020
He feels it, too.

944
01:32:34,922 --> 01:32:37,024
He will come for me.

945
01:32:38,192 --> 01:32:41,095
And while he's focused on me,
you know what to do.

946
01:33:14,495 --> 01:33:17,064
Where the bloody hell is it?

947
01:33:26,607 --> 01:33:28,342
What is it?

948
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:32,446
He knows, Mr. Clemens.

949
01:33:42,089 --> 01:33:44,224
Dear God. It has wings.

950
01:33:44,258 --> 01:33:46,060
It's coming!

951
01:33:48,095 --> 01:33:49,930
Please, Wojchek!
Wojchek, help me!

952
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:54,968
For God's sake, cut it!

953
01:34:03,243 --> 01:34:04,845
Wojchek!

954
01:34:14,388 --> 01:34:15,956
Wojchek!

955
01:34:15,989 --> 01:34:18,258
Wojchek!

956
01:35:12,179 --> 01:35:14,415
Wojchek!

957
01:35:14,448 --> 01:35:15,682
We're coming!

958
01:35:15,717 --> 01:35:18,285
No! Get the lifeboat ready!

959
01:35:58,025 --> 01:35:59,293
Go!

960
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:03,697
We have to hurry!
We're close to the shore!

961
01:36:03,731 --> 01:36:05,666
We need Wojchek!
And the captain!

962
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:07,167
I'll find 'em!

963
01:36:07,201 --> 01:36:08,669
Cut the ropes if you have to,
but get it free!

964
01:36:33,393 --> 01:36:35,329
Forgive me.

965
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:45,506
Wojchek!

966
01:37:00,755 --> 01:37:02,623
Wojchek!

967
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,533
Where are you?

968
01:37:15,235 --> 01:37:16,436
Wojchek.

969
01:37:25,312 --> 01:37:27,414
Anna.

970
01:37:27,447 --> 01:37:28,649
Captain.

971
01:37:41,829 --> 01:37:43,798
Captain!

972
01:37:43,831 --> 01:37:47,067
He's coming. He's coming!

973
01:38:00,614 --> 01:38:02,683
Anna!

974
01:38:02,717 --> 01:38:04,151
Captain!

975
01:38:13,928 --> 01:38:16,731
Oh, my Lord.

976
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:24,671
I renounce you, devil!

977
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,542
I renounce you...

978
01:38:58,672 --> 01:39:00,273
Captain.

979
01:39:15,555 --> 01:39:17,157
Mr. Clemens.

980
01:39:17,792 --> 01:39:19,660
Let them know, will you?

981
01:39:19,693 --> 01:39:24,598
Let them know I was true...

982
01:39:24,631 --> 01:39:26,566
to my trust.

983
01:39:27,902 --> 01:39:31,571
I will, Captain. I promise.

984
01:40:07,307 --> 01:40:10,677
You want them to believe
that you're a god!

985
01:40:11,813 --> 01:40:13,748
You and I both know
that you're not!

986
01:40:15,348 --> 01:40:18,585
You bleed like any of us!

987
01:40:18,618 --> 01:40:22,556
You sleep in dirt!

988
01:40:22,589 --> 01:40:24,357
You feed!

989
01:40:24,391 --> 01:40:26,794
Above all else, you feed!

990
01:40:26,828 --> 01:40:29,731
You want us to... to fear you!

991
01:40:29,764 --> 01:40:33,000
Underneath, you're afraid!

992
01:40:33,034 --> 01:40:35,635
You're afraid of
what lies on the other side

993
01:40:35,669 --> 01:40:38,039
as any other living thing!

994
01:41:24,451 --> 01:41:26,721
You are in my head.

995
01:41:26,754 --> 01:41:28,388
In my blood.

996
01:41:30,057 --> 01:41:31,625
You have damned me to hell!

997
01:41:45,572 --> 01:41:46,673
You bastard!

998
01:41:49,442 --> 01:41:52,079
Anna!

999
01:41:52,113 --> 01:41:53,848
Anna, get to the boat.

1000
01:42:07,028 --> 01:42:09,563
I do not...

1001
01:42:09,596 --> 01:42:11,866
f-fear you.

1002
01:42:17,604 --> 01:42:19,841
You will.

1003
01:42:34,421 --> 01:42:36,623
Die, you devil!

1004
01:43:30,711 --> 01:43:31,779
Jesus.

1005
01:43:31,812 --> 01:43:33,848
- What's wrong?
- Run and fetch the constable.

1006
01:43:33,881 --> 01:43:36,416
Tell him there's a ship trying
to get through the breakers.

1007
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:26,968
The coast...

1008
01:44:27,001 --> 01:44:29,036
so close.

1009
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:34,141
It's close.

1010
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:39,646
Mr. Clemens.

1011
01:44:42,249 --> 01:44:44,018
No.

1012
01:44:44,051 --> 01:44:47,121
No. No.

1013
01:44:47,154 --> 01:44:48,621
No.

1014
01:44:49,757 --> 01:44:53,027
I have known for days now.

1015
01:44:54,295 --> 01:44:55,997
I'm sorry.

1016
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:57,732
Another transfusion...

1017
01:44:57,765 --> 01:45:00,234
Would only delay
the inevitable.

1018
01:45:00,267 --> 01:45:01,869
We both know that.

1019
01:45:01,902 --> 01:45:03,603
But I can... I can...

1020
01:45:03,636 --> 01:45:06,007
-If I just...
-No.

1021
01:45:08,042 --> 01:45:10,011
I don't want to become...

1022
01:45:13,914 --> 01:45:15,816
My whole life...

1023
01:45:17,318 --> 01:45:19,754
...my people,

1024
01:45:19,787 --> 01:45:22,622
the devil,

1025
01:45:22,655 --> 01:45:24,792
they chose for me.

1026
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:28,162
I choose this.

1027
01:45:28,195 --> 01:45:29,997
No one else.

1028
01:45:34,035 --> 01:45:36,037
You saved me.

1029
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:38,571
And you me.

1030
01:46:49,844 --> 01:46:51,879
<i>It's all about</i>
<i>the ghost ship at Whitby.</i>

1031
01:46:51,912 --> 01:46:53,013
<i>No survivors.</i>

1032
01:46:53,047 --> 01:46:54,381
How about you, sir?

1033
01:46:54,415 --> 01:46:56,350
Would you like <i>The Dailygraph?</i>

1034
01:46:56,383 --> 01:46:58,919
Get your paper here,
only a cost of a tuppence.

1035
01:47:00,287 --> 01:47:02,389
It's all about the ghost ship
at Whitby.

1036
01:47:02,423 --> 01:47:04,225
No survivors.

1037
01:47:11,332 --> 01:47:14,135
<i>I've arrived in London.</i>

1038
01:47:14,168 --> 01:47:19,006
<i>The creature hunts for blood</i>
<i>somewhere in the city,</i>

1039
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:23,043
<i>but I know where it lays</i>
<i>to rest during the day.</i>

1040
01:47:23,077 --> 01:47:24,745
<i>Carfax Abbey?</i>

1041
01:47:24,778 --> 01:47:27,047
You the new owner?

1042
01:47:27,081 --> 01:47:29,150
No, miss. Just looking for him.

1043
01:47:29,183 --> 01:47:32,186
Oh, well, it's a couple hours
to reach the abbey

1044
01:47:32,219 --> 01:47:34,455
in a carriage from here.

1045
01:47:34,488 --> 01:47:36,790
It gets dark on the moors.

1046
01:47:36,824 --> 01:47:39,426
If I was you,
I'd wait till morning.

1047
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:42,129
You know, miss,
I was thinking the same thing.

1048
01:47:54,275 --> 01:47:56,243
<i>I have finally seen</i>
<i>the true darkness</i>

1049
01:47:56,277 --> 01:47:59,847
<i>that dwells beneath</i>
<i>the surface of this world,</i>

1050
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:04,985
<i>the evil that neither science</i>
<i>nor reason can explain.</i>

1051
01:48:05,019 --> 01:48:07,788
<i>Yet I have also seen its beauty</i>

1052
01:48:07,821 --> 01:48:11,125
<i>and those willing to give all</i>
<i>to protect it.</i>

1053
01:49:10,851 --> 01:49:14,054
<i>And so</i>
<i>I will pursue this foul beast.</i>

1054
01:49:14,088 --> 01:49:17,057
<i>And I swear by those</i>
<i>who have given their lives</i>

1055
01:49:17,091 --> 01:49:20,294
<i>that I will extinguish</i>
<i>this blight</i>

1056
01:49:20,327 --> 01:49:23,897
<i>and send it back to hell.</i>
