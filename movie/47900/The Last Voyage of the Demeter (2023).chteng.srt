1
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:28,070
1897年，一艘俄國帆船被租用來運送私人貨物，船上裝載50個木箱，從羅馬尼亞駛向英格蘭，但船隻抵達時已然殘破不堪

2
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:40,860
這艘船名為「德米特號」，本片就是其船員的故事，根據小說《德古拉》中「船長日誌」改編

3
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,210
警官，風暴吹來了一艘船
Constable, a boat’s blown in with the storm.

4
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,020
老天啊
God.

5
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,750
快點！
Come on!

6
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,640
（1897年8月6日，英格蘭・惠特比）

7
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,270
弗萊徹？
-Fletcher?

8
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,640
我登船了，長官，想查看有沒有幸存者
I went aboard, sir, to see if anyone was alive.

9
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,440
結果呢？
And?

10
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,250
那是什麼？
What’s that?

11
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,050
船長的日誌
Captain’s log.

12
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,060
這本日誌既是記錄
This log is a record

13
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,550
也是警告
and a warning.

14
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,390
如果它到了你的手裡，那只能祈禱上帝保佑你了
And if it finds you, God help you,

15
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,920
因為這意味著他拋棄了德米特
as he has abandoned Demeter.

16
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,830
我們會盡力阻止他
We tried to stop him.

17
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,530
如果我們沒能成功
If we didn’t succeed,

18
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,140
願上帝憐憫你們的靈魂
God have mercy on your souls.

19
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,310
我不能再回去了，長官
I can’t go back, sir.

20
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,090
來吧
Come on.

21
00:03:50,430 --> 00:04:01,290
《德米特號：噬血航程》

22
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,430
（四周前）

23
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,620
嘿！
Hey!

24
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,130
先生，快坐下，該你了！
Hey, mister! Sit down! It’s your turn.

25
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,900
快醒醒
Come on, wake up.

26
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,480
咱們回家吧
Let’s go back home.

27
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,320
7月6日
Sixth of July,

28
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,230
我們抵達了保加利亞瓦爾納港
made port in Varna, Bulgaria.

29
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,660
別走遠了，托比，我們不會停留太久的
Don’t wander far, Toby. We’re not staying long.

30
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,460
知道了，外公，保證不走遠
I won’t, Grandpa. I promise.

31
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,060
我們的船缺少幾個人手
Our crew was a few hands short.

32
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,540
船長
Captain.

33
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,570
我已經委託沃伊切克先生
And I have tasked Mr. Wojchek

34
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,770
在我們裝貨前解決這個問題
to remedy this before we take on cargo.

35
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,250
德米特號在招人，去英格蘭
is looking for hands all the way to England.

36
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,320
棄牌了
I fold.

37
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,080
注意了，各位
Open your ears, men.

38
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,590
德米特號需要三名身體健壯的船員
needs three able-bodied seamen.

39
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,020
去倫敦，我們用金子支付薪水
Bound for London. We pay in gold.

40
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,690
我可以
I’m able.

41
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,760
而且壯得像頭牛
And strong as an ox.

42
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,370
你叫什麼，小子？
Who are you, boy?

43
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,570
克萊門斯
Clemens.

44
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,580
你看起來像是受過教育的，你在哪裡上過學？
You dress like an educated man. Where did you go to school?

45
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,710
劍橋大學
University of Cambridge.

46
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,880
如果你們需要隨船醫生的話
I have a steady hand with a needle, and, uh...

47
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,320
我受過訓練，而且有醫療用品
I have supplies if you’re in need of a ship doctor.

48
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,920
雖然是以前的事了
I-It’s been a while,

49
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,250
但我知道不少關於船隻的知識
but I-I do know my way around a boat, if not.

50
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,790
航海可不只是讓船浮在水面
Learning about boats ain’t the same as keeping one afloat.

51
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,890
要是水手在海上迷失了方向
What did the sailor ever learn from a book

52
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,260
那從書本里學來的知識有什麼用？
that did him an ounce of good when he was lost at sea?

53
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,670
天文學就很有用
Astronomy, for one.

54
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,770
你可能會丟掉航海圖，丟掉羅盤
Can lose a chart. You can lose a compass.

55
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,970
但永遠不會丟掉星辰，不是嗎？
But you can’t lose the stars, can you?

56
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,310
從來沒見過這麼著急回英國的英國人
Never met an Englishman in such a hurry to return to England.

57
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,140
毫無疑問，一靠岸你就會消失
Be gone as soon as we reach it, no doubt.

58
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,420
我們需要強壯的船員，不要乘客
We need strong crew, not passengers.

59
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,360
我？
Me?

60
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,850
你
You.

61
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,850
還是算了
No, never mind you.

62
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,710
他說什麼？
What’s he saying?

63
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,490
他說他們不能留下
He says they cannot stay.

64
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,010
什麼叫不能留下？
The hell they can’t.

65
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,720
我們需要他們，不然就趕不上進度了
We need their hands or we lose the tide.

66
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,850
他說他們必須在日落前離開
He says they need to leave before the sun sinks.

67
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,720
這是什麼鬼話？
What kind of nonsense is that?

68
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,190
給你的人
- For your men.

69
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,070
我們走了
We go now.

70
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,080
走！
Men!

71
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,350
這比把貨運來的工錢還多
This is more than I paid to bring the damn cargo here.

72
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,250
他最後說的又是什麼？
What did he spit at the end?

73
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,830
是不是讓我們趕緊滾蛋？
"Good leave" or "good riddance"?

74
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,220
是「祝你們好運」
"Good luck."

75
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,440
快拉！
-Come on, pull!

76
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
拉！
Pull!

77
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,610
用力拉！
Come on, pull!

78
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,520
拉！
Pull!

79
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,180
用力拉
Come on, pull!

80
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,110
拉！
Pull!

81
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,960
快點！
See, let go. Let go!

82
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,240
托比！
Toby!

83
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,110
你沒事吧，孩子？
-Are you all right, boy? -

84
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,680
托比？
Toby?

85
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,110
沃伊切克先生，抓住那個人！
Mr. Wojchek, hold that man!

86
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,890
你們從來沒提過龍的事
You never said nothing about dragons.

87
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,790
我認識這個標記
I know this mark.

88
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,820
這是噩兆
It is a bad omen.

89
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,500
你差點害死那孩子
You could have killed the boy.

90
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,320
我他媽的才不在乎什麼龍！
I don’t give a whore’s ass about dragons!

91
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,540
留著你們的金子吧，惡魔的毒蛇
Keep your gold, the devil’s serpent.

92
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,970
願上帝拯救你們
God save you all.

93
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,300
願上帝拯救你們的船
May he save the ship.

94
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,370
願上帝拯救你們的船員
May he save the crew.

95
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,470
你沒事吧？
Are you all right?

96
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,910
-受傷了嗎？　-沒有
-You injured? -Mm-mm.

97
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,410
-謝謝，克萊門斯先生　-應該的
-Thank you, Mr. Clemens. -Yeah, sure.

98
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,390
我們一小時後啓航
We leave port within the hour.

99
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,540
你說過你瞭解船隻，如果我發現你撒謊
You prove to be lying about knowing your way around a boat,

100
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,360
我會親手把你扔進海裡，天文學家
I’ll throw you off the boat myself, astronomer.

101
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,000
謝謝，先生
Uh, th-thank you, sir.

102
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,680
拉爾斯，趕緊把那些臭烘烘的箱子裝好
Larsen, get this stinking bunch of cockroaches underway.

103
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,500
你們聽到沃伊切克先生的話了？
You heard Mr. Wojchek.

104
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,170
奧加侖，把箱子裝好
Olgaren, get those crates stowed.

105
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,260
來吧
Come on.

106
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,600
好孩子！
-Good boy!

107
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,400
起航！準備升帆
Cast off! Ready the headsails.

108
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,680
收緊泊船索！
Pull in the moorings!

109
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,810
動作快！
Be quick about it!

110
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,050
拉！
Pull!

111
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,760
-拉！　-給我留出轉向空間
-Pull! -WOJCHEK: Give me a way to steer.

112
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,450
載重太大了，她跟肥豬一樣笨重
She moves like a fat pig with all this weight.

113
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,900
看到上面的橫梁了嗎？
Do you see that beam up there?

114
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,300
以前就在那裡，絞死海盜和叛亂分子
That’s where they used to hang pirates and mutineers.

115
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,140
你見過死人嗎，克萊門斯先生？
Have you ever seen a real dead man, Mr. Clemens?

116
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,650
我見過
I have.

117
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,540
-真的？　-我帶你參觀船隻吧
-Really? -Let me show you the ship.

118
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,980
這扇大門後面是船長室
Captain’s cabin’s that big door.

119
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,650
那裡面有很多地圖和畫
There’s lots of maps and drawings in there,

120
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,280
但是船長不喜歡我擺弄它們
but captain doesn’t like me fiddling.

121
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,920
這是哈克貝利
This here is Huckleberry.

122
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,690
不過我們都叫他哈克
-Oh. -But we just call him Huck.

123
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,730
你好，哈克
- Hello, Huck.

124
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,700
那是貨艙
That’s the cargo hold.

125
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,700
裡面的東西都是運往倫敦的
Everything there is headed for London.

126
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,130
要是有麻煩了，就這麼敲
You knock on wood like this if there’s any trouble.

127
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,630
這也是換班信號，或者是發現了風暴預兆
Or to signal a change of watch or if the sky’s looking fierce.

128
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,630
夜裡安靜的時候
You can hear it all the way from the bunks

129
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,640
上面水手艙和船長室都能聽到
to the captain’s on a clear night.

130
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,210
真的
-I swear. -Mm.

131
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,340
我就聽見過
I’ve heard it.

132
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,280
我相信你
 Yes, I believe you have.

133
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,880
這是我們吃飯的地方
This is where we eat.

134
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,820
這是用傳統方法建造的木船
This used to be a lumber ship, built the old way.

135
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,720
但是現在所有人都想要蒸汽船
But now everyone wants steam ships.

136
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
船長說開鐵皮船一點樂趣也沒有
Captain says there’s no joy in metal ships.

137
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,790
但這就是發展啊
Well, that’s the thing about progress, innit?

138
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,700
發展不在乎樂趣，也不在乎你的船長
It cares not for joy, your captain’s or otherwise.

139
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,460
不過德米特確實是艘好船
a fine boat. No doubt.

140
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,460
來見見我的船員吧，克萊門斯先生
Meet my crew, Mr. Clemens.

141
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,300
只要我們快點吃
The faster we eat them,

142
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,970
我就能少給它們鏟屎
the less crap I have to clean up.

143
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,840
哈克，你知道規矩的
Ah-ah, Huck. You know the rules.

144
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,640
這裡是廚房
And up here is the galley.

145
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,510
約瑟夫
-Joseph. -Huh?

146
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,150
這是克萊門斯
This here is Clemens.

147
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,350
他是醫生，真正的醫生
He’s a doctor. A real one.

148
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,720
六點整開飯，不會早也不會晚
We eat at six bells-- no sooner, no later.

149
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,580
你們離廚房遠點
You stay out of the galley.

150
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,020
而且我不給異教徒做飯
And I won’t serve any man who takes the Lord’s name in vain.

151
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,930
-他說的是上一個　-我說的是所有的
-He means that last one. -I mean all of them.

152
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,860
你知道聖尼古拉斯是誰嗎？
Do you know who Saint Nicholas is?

153
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,620
水手的守護神
Patron saint of sailors.

154
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,000
看來你不是異教徒
Well, you’re not a heathen.

155
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,940
感謝主的所有恩賜
Thank the Lord for small favors.

156
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,240
托比，帶他去看他的住處
Toby, show him to his quarters.

157
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,210
把這只狗給我弄走！
And get this mutt out of my kitchen.

158
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,570
哈克！
Huck! -

159
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,080
7月6日
On sixth July,

160
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,210
我們裝貨完畢
we finished taking in cargo--

161
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,850
土耳其棉花，十桶原油
Turkish cotton, ten barrels of petroleum

162
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,580
還有要送往倫敦的私人箱子
and private crates marked for London--

163
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,050
船員共計九人
with nine hands.

164
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,450
五名船員，一名醫生
Crew of five, one ship doctor,

165
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,520
兩名副手，一名廚師，再加上我，船長
two mates, cook and myself, captain.

166
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,260
順風
-Fair wind.

167
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,130
船員情緒高漲
-Crew in high spirits. -

168
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,480
一切正常，船長
All is well, Captain.

169
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,920
東北風，時速12節
Making about 12 knots on the nor’easter.

170
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,890
舵有點吃力，不過會沒事的
Wheel’s kicking a bit, but she’ll settle down.

171
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,750
12節？
12 knots?

172
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,120
那我們8月6號前就能抵達倫敦
We’ll reach London well before August the sixth.

173
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,320
是啊，船長
Aye, sir.

174
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,420
為了船員，也該盡早抵達
For the crew’s sake, we better.

175
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,230
他們已經找到辦法花獎金了
Already finding ways to spend the bonus pay.

176
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,540
沃伊切克先生，我已經決定了，這是我的最後一趟航行
I’ve decided this is to be my final voyage, Mr. Wojchek.

177
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,110
我會在愛爾蘭買一棟小農舍
I’m going to buy a little cottage in Ireland.

178
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,310
托比肯定喜歡農村生活
Toby will enjoy the countryside.

179
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,650
而且我跟女兒保證過
And I promised my daughter I wouldn’t let the sea air

180
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,350
不會讓他的未來都在海上度過
bleach the future out of him.

181
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,450
我也想踐行諾言
I intend to keep that promise.

182
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,460
等我們一抵達倫敦
I will arrange for you to be my successor

183
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,160
我就會安排你來繼任，德米特的船長
Demeter as soon as we reach London.

184
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,660
先生，我...
Sir, I...

185
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,630
沃伊切克先生，你是優秀的水手
You’re a good seaman, Mr. Wojchek.

186
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,970
沒有比你更合適的人了
The ship couldn’t ask for a better hand to guide her crew.

187
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,440
800磅，八個人分
800 pounds eight ways,

188
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,950
減掉船長和大副的份
and minus the captain and first mate’s share,

189
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,180
每個人大概...
comes to round about...

190
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,380
75磅
75 each.

191
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,020
-75？　-我得好好梳洗一番
-75? -Gonna get myself

192
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,550
再買上一件那種帶燕尾的背心
a proper shave and one of them waistcoats with the tails on.

193
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,890
英國女士們可喜歡尾巴了
Ooh, the English ladies love them tails.

194
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,760
幾乎快趕上對我的愛了
Almost... almost as much as they love me.

195
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,970
有可能，但你得用燕尾蒙上她們的臉
If you put them over your face, mm, maybe.

196
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,400
對對對
- -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

197
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,860
你最幽默了，是吧？
You’re the funny ones, aren’t you?

198
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,800
你們打算怎麼花？
What are you lot gonna do with yours?

199
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
「慷慨待人，必然豐裕
"The generous soul will be made rich,

200
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,210
滋潤人的 自己也得滋潤」
and he who waters will also be watered himself."

201
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,110
不過上帝應該不介意
Although the Lord might not mind

202
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,710
我直接滋潤自己吧
if I just simply watered myself.

203
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,990
天吶！75磅！
Oi! 75!

204
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,750
你們知道我要怎麼花這麼多錢嗎？
Do you know what I will do this much?

205
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,120
肯定跟平時一樣，彼得羅夫斯基
 The same thing that you always do, Petrofsky.

206
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,130
找到最近的妓院，然後一整個月
Find the nearest brothel and spend the next month

207
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,330
都跟姑娘們...
absolutely up to your gills in...

208
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,100
艾布拉姆斯先生，可以了
Mr. Abrams, if you please.

209
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,760
抱歉啊，船長
Apologies, Captain.

210
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,970
-忘記有小朋友了　-我都快九歲了
-Forgot about the lad. I’m almost nine.

211
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,630
而且我知道妓院是什麼
I know what a brothel is, anyway.

212
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,930
你知道？
Do you, now?

213
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,670
嗯
Yeah.

214
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,670
是付錢給女人讓她們脫褲子的地方
It’s a place we pay women to take off their knickers.

215
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,940
我喜歡小孩子
-Ah, I love kids!

216
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
不是嗎？
Well, isn’t it?

217
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,180
差不多吧，小子
Oh, close enough, lad.

218
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,150
差不多
Close enough.

219
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,650
克萊門斯先生，你呢？
Well, Mr. Clemens, what about you?

220
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,780
-先生？　-只要貨物能按時抵達倫敦
-Sir? -Our charter has agreed

221
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,450
我們的雇主就會
to pay a sizable bonus

222
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,090
支付我們一筆很可觀的獎金
for timely arrival of his cargo in London.

223
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,590
你也是船上的一員
You’re part of the crew,

224
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,100
所以也會分到船員分成
which means you earn a crewman’s share.

225
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,490
你打算怎麼花？
How do you plan spending it?

226
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,600
買條新襯裙？
A new petticoat, perhaps?

227
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,370
很遺憾，我在這個世界上渴望的東西
Well, everything I desire in this life, unfortunately,

228
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,140
都是金錢買不到的
coin will be of no aid.

229
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,930
那是什麼？
 And what would that be, now?

230
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,180
理解這個世界
To understand this world.

231
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,940
但是我見識的越多，越覺這個世界毫無邏輯
The more of it I see, the less any of it makes sense.

232
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,450
克萊門斯先生，這個世界可不管「邏輯」
The world cares little for sense, Mr. Clemens.

233
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,620
也許世界本就不是用來理解的
Perhaps it is not meant to be understood

234
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,590
而是用來體驗和接受的
but rather experienced and accepted.

235
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,860
也許吧
Perhaps.

236
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,630
但我還是想接近它的本質
But I need to get to the heart of it.

237
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,140
然後理解為什麼
And understand why

238
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,110
哪怕世上有那麼多美好，但還是...
the world has so much goodness inside it and yet...

239
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,740
所有人在內心深處，其實…
 Isn’t that what all men desire, mm?

240
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,250
都想得到答案吧
Deep down.

241
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,160
他說的對
Well, hell, he’s right.

242
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,220
那他的那份歸我了
I’ll have his share, then.

243
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,230
怎麼回事？
What the devil is that?

244
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,260
托比，去看看牲口
Toby. See to the livestock.

245
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,300
托比？
-Toby?

246
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,040
它們怎麼了？
What’s gotten into them?

247
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,610
可能是因為天氣吧
It’s probably just the weather.

248
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,450
它們能感覺到暴風雨的到來
Hey, they can sense a storm coming.

249
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,100
托比，來搭把手
Toby, give me a hand with this.

250
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,400
這樣應該能讓它們安靜了
That should put them to rest.

251
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,250
那是什麼，克萊門斯先生？
What was that, Mr. Clemens?

252
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,970
去找船長，孩子
Fetch the captain, lad.

253
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,150
告訴他有東西掉進貨艙了
Tell him something fell in the cargo hold.

254
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,400
堅持住
-Stay with me.

255
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,770
堅持住
Stay with me.

256
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,310
快
Come on.

257
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,010
-上帝啊　-她沒有上甲板
-What in the seven hells? -She was below deck.

258
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,610
偷渡客
A stowaway.

259
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,350
如果不及時治療
A stowaway who is going to die

260
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,110
這個偷渡客會死掉的
if we don’t administer proper medical care.

261
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,890
你想幫她？
You want to help her?

262
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,190
誰知道她身上攜帶了什麼疾病，會不會傳染…
Who knows what kind of diseased rat infections she has...

263
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,800
-船長　-你需要什麼？
-Captain. -What do you need?

264
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,300
她被感染了
Her body’s infected.

265
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,900
我要嘗試輸血
I need to attempt a transfusion.

266
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
-你說什麼呢？　-輸血
-What are you babbling? -A blood transfusion.

267
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,800
她需要健康血液來對抗感染
She needs blood to fight the infection.

268
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,710
你在開玩笑吧
You’re joking.

269
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,550
你要麼幫我，要麼就離開別礙事
You are of aid to me or you are in my way and need to leave.

270
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,480
不管是哪種情況
In either case, please make yourself apparent

271
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,140
都請你快點行動
and fulfill your purpose.

272
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,000
她能撐過今晚，不過我必須
She’ll make it the night, but I need to continue

273
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,840
繼續給她輸血，直到她沒有被感染的血液
with the transfusions until she has no more infected blood.

274
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,450
我們已經盡力了
We’ve done all we can.

275
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,520
那也許她能及時醒來
Then maybe she’ll wake up in time to see us

276
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,950
親眼看著我們把她扔進海裡
toss her to the waves.

277
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,790
我們讓波塞冬決定偷渡者的命運，向來如此
We let Poseidon deal with stowaways-- always have.

278
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,290
我救她的命不是為了看著你殺了她
I didn’t save this girl’s life only to watch you end it.

279
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,220
讓我們在下個港口下船吧
At least let us off at the next port.

280
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,860
「我們」？
"Us," is it?

281
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,540
這就是你的忠誠嗎？克萊門斯先生
I see where your loyalty lies, Mr. Clemens.

282
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,640
要是在港口停靠，獎金就泡湯了
We stop, then we forfeit the bonus wage.

283
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,070
我才不會為了你，或者你那個生病的婊子
And I ain’t forfeiting the bonus wage

284
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,140
而放棄我的獎金
for you or your diseased whore.

285
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,710
沃伊切克先生，小聲點
Mr. Wojchek, lower your voice.

286
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,240
注意你的語言
Control your language.

287
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,520
這是我在德米特號的
I would prefer not to have my final voyage

288
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,010
最後一次航行了
Demeter

289
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,880
我不希望它被一個年輕女士的死亡毀掉
marred by the death of a young woman.

290
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,420
不管是不是偷渡者
Stowaway or not.

291
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,020
把木工棚改造一下
We will repurpose the carpenter shed

292
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,320
-給她當住所吧　-謝謝你，先生
-as the young woman’s quarters. -Thank you, sir.

293
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,730
至於你，克萊門斯先生，這位病人的口糧
And you will be solely dividing your own rations

294
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,800
要從你的那份里分
with your patient, Mr. Clemens.

295
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,280
托比
Toby.

296
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,350
-你能幫我照看她一下嗎？　-嗯
-You’ll look after her for me, will you? -Mm-hmm.

297
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,060
要是有人想見她，你就立刻來找我
Anyone tries to see her, you come get me

298
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,900
-或者去找船長，明白嗎？　-明白
-or the captain straightaway, you understand? -Yeah.

299
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,100
那好，過去吧，好孩子
All right, then. Go on. That’s a good lad.

300
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,280
你真是交到了各種朋友啊
You’re making all sorts of friends,

301
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,790
是不是，克萊門斯先生？
aren’t you, Mr. Clemens?

302
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,760
女人上船是噩兆
Woman on the ship. Bad omen. Hmm?

303
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,320
厄運
Bad luck.

304
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,090
男人們不會開心的
Men won’t be happy.

305
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,900
男人不需要開心，不是嗎，奧加侖先生？
The men don’t need to be happy, do they, Mr. Olgaren?

306
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,260
他們只需要把船開到倫敦就行
They just need to get this boat to London, huh?

307
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,330
小子，我是想幫你，你要是繼續這麼說話
I’m trying to help you, son. Keep spouting words like that.

308
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,000
她也許能抵達倫敦
Maybe she’ll make it to London, but...

309
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,640
但你可能要游回去了
but I reckon you’ll be swimming.

310
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,480
需要我就敲船
Knock if you need me.

311
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
煙鬥省著點抽
-Saves the pipes. -Mm.

312
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,750
-明白嗎？　-明白
-Understand? -Aye!

313
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,800
這裡到處都是島嶼和礁石
Islands and rocks everywhere here.

314
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,100
我們已經到愛琴海了？
So we’re in the Aegean, yes?

315
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,330
這是黎明時分的地中海
It’s the Mediterranean at dawn.

316
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,770
那我們時間很充裕
It’s good time, innit?

317
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,070
希臘應該在右舷方向
Greece should be to our starboard.

318
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,920
奧加侖先生？
Mr. Olgaren?

319
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,430
奧加侖先生？
Mr. Olgaren?

320
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,710
奧加侖？
Olgaren?

321
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:09,660
老天啊！
Jesus Christ!

322
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,450
你看見了嗎？
Did you see it?

323
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,990
有人經過嗎？
Did no one pass by?

324
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,730
看見什麼？甲板上除了我們沒有別人
See what? There’s no one on deck but us.

325
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,330
這裡有什麼東西
There is something out there.

326
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,200
有人
Someone.

327
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,370
什麼東西...
What the...

328
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,050
天吶，哈克
Oh, God, Huck.

329
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,080
所有牲口？
All the livestock?

330
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,020
如果有人知道這邪惡行徑的信息，立刻站出來
Any man with knowledge of this heinous act

331
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,030
不然就會被關押待審
needs to step forward now or find themselves in irons later.

332
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,560
那個女孩...
The girl...

333
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,430
根本沒有體力做出這種事
Was in no shape to do anything of the sort,

334
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,270
沃伊切克先生可以證明，雖然也許他並不願意
and Mr. Wojchek can attest to that, even if he’d rather not.

335
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,780
是的
Aye.

336
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,780
他說得對
He’s right on this.

337
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,270
她不用親自動手，我們都知道
She didn’t need to. We all know.

338
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,640
女人上船，厄運
Bad luck, woman on board.

339
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,250
暴風雨，動物發瘋
Makes skies turn, animals go mad.

340
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,790
狗被開膛了
The dog was ripped into.

341
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,050
也許他狂犬病發作，攻擊牲口
Perhaps he went rabid and was gored by

342
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,960
然後被大牲口頂死了
one of the larger livestock as it attacked it.

343
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,420
你覺得這是哈克乾的？
You think Huck did this?

344
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,060
他把牲口咬死了？
Ripped apart the animals?

345
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,760
不可能，他是好狗
No. He’s a good dog.

346
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,330
你們聽到了
You heard the man.

347
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,500
狂犬病，就是厄運
Rabies. Bad luck is all.

348
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,900
我們只能繼續前進
Push on through as we always do.

349
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:13,010
如果是狂犬病，那我們必須停靠港口
If this is an outbreak, then we’ll need to make port.

350
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,310
-船長　-不行，那就拿不到獎金了
-Captain... -No. No. -No, we won’t make our bonus, then.

351
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,140
你在說什麼？那我們的獎金就沒有了
What are you talking about? Then we lose the bonus wage.

352
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,640
不能停靠港口
We can’t make port. No.

353
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,080
克萊門斯先生，這種疾病
Mr. Clemens, a malady of this sort,

354
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,250
會傳染人類嗎？
could a human catch it?

355
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,690
不會
No.

356
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,530
只要不被咬，人就不會染上狂犬病
Rabies, it-it can’t pass to a human without it being bit.

357
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,170
處理掉屍體
Dispose of the meat.

358
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,980
快點
Immediately.

359
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,980
看來之後的旅程里
I guess we say the Lord’s Prayer

360
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,440
都只能對著土豆白菜念禱詞了
over cabbage and potatoes for the rest of our voyage.

361
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,810
你們的腦子都壞掉了嗎？
Have you all been struck dumb?

362
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:01,120
狂犬病打不開牲口籠
It’s not rabies that opened up the livestock cages.

363
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,120
這艘船上只有兩個人
And there is only two people on this boat

364
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,130
沒有跟我一起航行過
I have not sailed with fore now:

365
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,790
工具棚里的那個女人
in the toolshed

366
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,560
還有這個假裝是醫生的黑皮膚野人
and this darky savage pretending to be doctor.

367
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,070
再說一遍
Say it again.

368
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,780
這不是人類乾的
No man did this.

369
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,720
船上有邪物
Evil is on board.

370
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,160
強大的邪物
Powerful evil.

371
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,650
安娜
DRACULA Anna.

372
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,520
真他媽的臭
- -That bloody reeks.

373
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,010
托比？
Toby?

374
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,650
托比？
Toby?

375
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,720
嘿
Hey.

376
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,230
孩子，哈克是條好狗
Huck was a good dog, son.

377
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,760
我很遺憾
I’m sorry.

378
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,730
不只是因為哈克貝利
It wasn’t just Huckleberry.

379
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,630
我向船長保證過，我--
I promised the captain I--

380
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:59,010
照顧它們是我的工作
It was my job to look after them.

381
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,770
我是說那些動物
The animals, I mean.

382
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,670
我向船長保證過
I-I promised the captain.

383
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,780
托比...
Toby...

384
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,890
有時候不管我們怎麼保證，事情還是會出差錯
sometimes things go wrong, no matter what we promise.

385
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,430
知道嗎？
All right?

386
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,270
世界上的很多事我們都沒法控制
There are things in this world that we can’t control,

387
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,760
我們只要盡力就好
but we do our best. Hmm?

388
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,270
是啊
Yeah.

389
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,080
謝謝，克萊門斯先生
Thanks, Mr. Clemens.

390
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,340
去吧
Go on.

391
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,190
天空發怒了
The skies are angry.

392
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,980
天空沒有感情
The skies feel nothing, my friend.

393
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,720
這只是降雨和氣壓
It’s precipitation and air pressure,

394
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,060
與這艘船的航行一樣，都是可知的
as knowable as the workings of this ship.

395
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,830
我昨晚看到了
I saw something last night.

396
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,030
船上有非自然的東西跟我們在一起
There is something unnatural on board with us.

397
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,730
我不相信迷信的東西，奧加侖先生
I’m afraid I don’t believe in superstitions, Mr. Olgaren.

398
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,740
我相信科學和自然
I believe in science and in nature.

399
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,340
還有聖尼古拉斯
And in Saint Nicholas,

400
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,570
不然約瑟夫就不給我吃的了
since Joseph wouldn’t give me food otherwise.

401
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,040
別再提科學了
Keep your science.

402
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,380
昨晚我看到你的臉色了
I saw your face in the dark last night.

403
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,450
你的眼睛
Your eyes.

404
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,160
你也看到了，跟我一樣
You saw it, same as I.

405
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,890
7月16日
16th of July.

406
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:07,300
過去三天的天氣很惡劣，所有人都很忙
Rough weather last three days and all hands busy with sails.

407
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,310
隨船醫生繼續
Our ship’s doctor continues

408
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,240
定期給我們的偷渡者輸血
to administer regular transfusions to our stowaway,

409
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,940
但她的狀況並無好轉
yet her condition remains unchanged.

410
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,780
食物逐漸短缺
Food is running sparse,

411
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,040
船員情緒低落
men downcast,

412
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,550
我們已經駛過了馬塔潘角
and now past Cape Matapan,

413
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,190
前面還有兩周多的航程
we’ve more than two weeks to travel.

414
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,050
她叫安娜
Her name is Anna.

415
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,160
她跟你說的？
She told you that?

416
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,660
她醒過？
Has she been awake?

417
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,930
奧加侖先生教過我一些羅馬尼亞語
Mr. Olgaren taught me some Romani.

418
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,400
她有時候也會說英語
She speaks some English sometimes, too.

419
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,840
不過說的不多...
She didn’t say this one so much, but...

420
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,250
她好像一直在做噩夢
I don’t think she’s having very nice dreams.

421
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,320
她一直在重復同一個詞
She repeats a word over and over.

422
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,350
「餵養」
"Feed."

423
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,760
睡不著？
Can’t sleep?

424
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,540
看來你也注意到了
You noticed it, too, then.

425
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,040
老鼠
The rats.

426
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,710
太安靜了
Still quiet.

427
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,780
我檢查過食物櫃，它們不見了
I was checking the larder. They’re all gone.

428
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,110
不見了？什麼意思？
Gone? What do you mean gone?

429
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,010
就是這個意思，不見了
I mean what I say. Gone.

430
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,230
櫃子里總是有好多老鼠
Always a dozen or so in the woodwork,

431
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,020
細細簌簌，吱吱叫
screeching, scrabbling.

432
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,960
要是哈克發狂了
Well, if... if Huck went rabid,

433
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,300
也許他先趕走了老鼠，然後才攻擊的牲口...
perhaps, before the livestock, he drove them off...

434
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,240
克萊門斯先生，就算把這艘船燒成灰
You could burn this ship to the keel, Mr. Clemens,

435
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,600
老鼠也會在灰燼中做窩
and the rats would just nest in the ashes.

436
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,580
有什麼東西把它們嚇跑了
Something drove them off.

437
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,220
船上沒有老鼠
A boat without rats,

438
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,920
是違反自然規律的
such a thing is against nature.

439
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,070
艾布拉姆斯？
Abrams?

440
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,180
又再開什麼愚蠢的玩笑了
Playing some kind of fool’s joke.

441
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,180
蠢貨就愛玩遊戲
Idiots playing games, huh?

442
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,330
艾布拉姆斯？
Abrams?

443
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,810
你到底是從哪兒冒出來的？
Where the hell did you come from?

444
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,990
彼得羅夫斯基？
Petrofsky?

445
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,330
刀子是在這裡找到的？
The knife was found here?

446
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,300
舵輪是綁好的？
And the wheel was tied off?

447
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,430
彼得羅夫斯基肯定是喝醉了
Petrofsky must have been drunk.

448
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,580
然後滑倒掉下船了
Slipped on the deck and fell overboard.

449
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,650
灑了滿船的血然後掉下船？
Right after he bled all over the deck?

450
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,750
那你大半夜的起來幹什麼？
And what were you doing up in the middle of the night?

451
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,250
我們發現你的時候，他的刀就在你手裡
You had his knife in your hand when we found you.

452
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,790
當然是我殺了他
Of course. I-I killed him.

453
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,450
雖然到處都是血
And somehow managed to keep myself

454
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,450
但我就是有辦法一點血都沒沾上
free of all the blood you see staining the boards,

455
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,450
然後我又特意敲鐘暴露自己
then I rang the signal bell to report myself.

456
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,990
是不是很聰明，沃伊切克先生？
It’s quite brilliant, innit, Mr. Wojchek?

457
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,090
真是再清楚不過了
Open-and-shut case.

458
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,980
船長，我檢查過狗的屍體
Captain, the dog’s body, I examined it.

459
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,380
其他動物都是在儲藏室被殺的，但狗不是
It wasn’t killed in the larder like the other animals.

460
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,020
它脖子上有咬痕，所有動物都有
It had bite marks on its neck. All the animals did.

461
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,660
你到底想說什麼，克萊門斯先生？
What exactly are you suggesting, Mr. Clemens?

462
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,790
我也不知道，先生
I don’t know, sir,

463
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,860
但是它們的頸動脈都被撕裂了，而且…
but their arteries were ripped open, and then they...

464
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,030
他在這裡
He’s here.

465
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,900
他在這裡
He is here.

466
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,160
我們必須立刻下船！
We have to get off this boat. Now!

467
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,300
所有人！立刻下船！
All of us! We have to get off this boat!

468
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,130
克萊門斯先生，控制住你的病人
-Mr. Clemens, restrain your patient. -

469
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,370
-快點！他會把我們都殺掉的！　-安娜，別這樣！
-Now! He will kill us all! -Please! Anna, please!

470
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,840
-安娜！　-我們都會死！
-Anna, please! Please! -Kill us all!

471
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,210
快下船
-Get off the boat. -

472
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,180
船長會祈禱的
Captain will say a few words from the good book,

473
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,180
我們繼續工作
and we’ll get on with things.

474
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,890
船上的酒，根本不夠彼得羅夫斯基喝醉
There’s not enough liquor on board to get Petrofsky

475
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,690
-然後摔下去…　-艾布拉姆斯先生
-drunk enough to fall off... -Mr. Abrams.

476
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,220
我們為什麼不能，聽那位女士的...
Are we not gonna listen to the lass and what she just...

477
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,830
除了船的狀況和天氣
I’ll spend no more time discussing anything

478
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,870
我不會再浪費時間討論任何事
but the state of this boat and the weather.

479
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,970
明白嗎，艾布拉姆斯？，回去工作
Understood, Mr. Abrams? Get to work.

480
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,540
7月18日
18th of July.

481
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,210
船員在早上彙報
Men reported in the morning

482
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,080
彼得羅夫斯基失蹤了
that one of the crew, Petrofsky, was missing.

483
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,080
我讓手下徹底搜查了船隻
I had the men do a thorough search of the ship.

484
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,020
然後奧加侖說
This after Olgaren confided

485
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,790
他幾天前的看到了奇怪的東西
that he had seen something strange nights before.

486
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,600
給你輸的血
These blood transfusions

487
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,330
應該能控制住你的感染
should keep your infection under control.

488
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:36,980
你剛才想跟我們說什麼？
So, what were you trying to tell us out there?

489
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,110
他在這裡，在船上
He is here on the ship.

490
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,890
他一直都在這裡
He has been all along.

491
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
他？
He?

492
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,490
好吧
Okay.

493
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,770
如果你不跟我說話，不告訴我們發生了什麼
I can’t help you if you don’t speak to me

494
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,900
不說你為什麼會在船上，我就沒法幫你
and tell me what happened, why we found you below deck.

495
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,140
在我的村莊里有個傳說
It is spoken in my village of an evil

496
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,080
說有惡魔住在山上
that lives in the mountains above.

497
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,610
住在一棟比所有人都古老的城堡里
A castle older than any of us.

498
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,480
-惡魔？　-這個惡魔想掩蓋本質時
-Evil? -An evil that appears as a man

499
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,760
就會以人類的形象出現
when it wants to hide its true nature.

500
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,360
夜晚，他以無辜者的鮮血為食
And at night, he feeds on the blood of the innocent.

501
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,870
我這輩子都生活在那個城堡的陰影中
I have lived in the shadow of that castle my whole life.

502
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:35,300
村裡的長輩...
I knew that the elders, they...

503
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:40,010
為了大家的安全，跟他進行了交易
they made bargains for the safety of our people.

504
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,780
他們把你送給了那個男人？
You were given to this man?

505
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,470
-他不是人　-是野獸？
-It is not a man. -Then an animal?

506
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,280
不，也不是沒有思想的野獸
No, it is not some mindless animal either.

507
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,780
不要犯這種錯誤
Do not make that mistake.

508
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,380
我們叫他德古拉
We call him Dracula.

509
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,520
你認為他把你帶上了船？
And you-you believe that he brought you on board?

510
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,420
為什麼？
Why?

511
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,910
他帶我來餵養他
He brought me here to feed.

512
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,570
天啊
Dear God.

513
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,250
他就在這裡，克萊門斯先生
He is here, Mr. Clemens.

514
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:29,190
他是披著人皮的惡魔
The thing that wears the skin of a man.

515
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,420
會在晚上吸食我們的鮮血
In the night, it drinks our blood,

516
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,860
他就在船上
and he is on this ship.

517
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,130
也就是說他永遠不會離開
Which means that we will never leave it.

518
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,340
那個女人
The woman,

519
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,180
好像沒有什麼威脅，但是...
she seems harmless, but...

520
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,380
自從她上船...所以我想…
ever since she came on board, I wonder if...

521
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,680
把她交給大海會不會更好
if we would have been better just to let the ocean have her.

522
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,520
但我又想到了我的女兒
But then I think about my daughter.

523
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,060
她跟她差不多大...
She’s around her age and...

524
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,390
聰明又漂亮
smart and-and pretty.

525
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,620
奧加侖？
Olgaren?

526
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,760
奧加侖？
Olgaren?

527
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,890
出什麼事了？我聽到你敲船了
What’s wrong? I heard your knock.

528
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,750
我敲船？
My knock?

529
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,440
不要，求你了
Please, no!

530
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,420
不要，求你了
Please, no.

531
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,780
用力拉，混蛋
Pull, you bastards!

532
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,090
用力！
Pull!

533
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,630
艾布拉姆斯！
Abrams!

534
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,930
拉爾斯去哪兒了？
Where the devil is Larsen?!

535
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,930
拉爾斯！
-Larsen! Larsen! -Larsen! Larsen!

536
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,440
-奧加侖！　-拉爾斯！
-Olgaren! -Larsen!

537
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,910
拉爾斯！
Larsen!

538
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,520
拉爾斯！
-Larsen! -Larsen!

539
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,910
拉爾斯！
Larsen!

540
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,320
好了
-That’s it. -

541
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,430
奧加侖，拉爾斯在哪？
Olgaren, where’s Larsen?

542
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,360
奧加侖
Olgaren. Hey.

543
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,660
好了
There he is.

544
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,560
按住他！
- - Hold him!

545
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,560
快！
Guys!

546
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,700
7月24日
24th of July.

547
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,410
船隻好像被厄運籠罩了
There seems some doom over the ship,

548
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,510
駛入比斯開灣時，已經少了一個人
already a hand short entering the Bay of Biscay

549
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,610
前面還有惡劣的天氣
with wild weather ahead.

550
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:34,290
昨天晚上，又失去了一個船員，還有一個受傷了
And last night, a second man lost and another man injured.

551
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,950
很奇怪的傷
A strange injury.

552
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,260
所有人都陷入了恐慌
Men all in a panic of fear.

553
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,860
我們已經航行了18天
We are 18 days at sea.

554
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,830
最近的港口就是英格蘭
The closest port is England.

555
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,800
我們只能寄希望於上帝保佑，並繼續前進
We must put our trust in God and go forward.

556
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,780
他像冰一樣涼
He’s cold as ice.

557
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,420
他會動，會發出聲音，但就是不睜眼
He makes noises and he moves, but his eyes won’t open.

558
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,910
就像陷入了噩夢，醒不過來
Like he’s unable to wake from some dream.

559
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,550
他的脖子是怎麼回事？
But what happened to his neck?

560
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,950
他在桅桿上幹什麼？
And what was he doing in the rigging?

561
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,390
任何事都有可能
Anything could have happened.

562
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:16,460
也許他被繩索纏住了脖子
Perhaps some rigging wrapped around his throat.

563
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,090
不是
No. No, no, no.

564
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,890
這看起來像咬痕
This looks like a bite.

565
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,470
跟那些動物身上的咬痕一樣
It looks like the same bites we saw in the animals,

566
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,310
跟工具棚里那姑娘身上的咬痕一樣
the same bites that ravaged the girl in the carpenter’s shed.

567
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,770
你覺得是惡魔乾的？
You think some devil did this?

568
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,900
就像她說的？
Like she says?

569
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,640
我...
I...

570
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,450
...不這麼認為
...do not.

571
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,810
-很好　-但肯定是某種東西乾的
-Good. -But something did.

572
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,320
而且不管我們信不信
And that is real and on board,

573
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,020
那東西真實存在，就在船上
whether we choose to believe in it or not.

574
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,470
從現在開始
From now on,

575
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:57,600
每崗兩個人，帶武器
I want two men for every watch, armed.

576
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,440
沒有例外
No exceptions.

577
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,940
沃伊切克先生，搜船
Search the ship, Mr. Wojchek.

578
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,220
不只是貨艙
Not just the hold.

579
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,480
搜每個角落
Everywhere.

580
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,600
好了，托比
All right, Toby.

581
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,630
給你一個重要任務
You have quite the task.

582
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,380
一位船長...
A captain...

583
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,640
必須依賴他的望遠鏡
is only as good as his spyglass.

584
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,420
你能幫我把它擦乾淨嗎？
Can I trust you to shine it up for me?

585
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,390
如果這太難...
If it’s too much to...

586
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,910
不難
No.

587
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,890
不難，先生
I mean, no, sir.

588
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:25,690
我能做到，我發誓
I can do it, I swear.

589
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:27,920
好孩子
Good lad.

590
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,300
我馬上回來
- -I’ll be back soon.

591
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,130
托比，鎖好門
Toby, lock the door.

592
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,480
我不喜歡這樣
I don’t like this.

593
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,350
太陽要落山了，他要出來了
Sun’s going down, and he’ll be coming.

594
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,840
有人嗎？
Hello?

595
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,620
奧加侖先生，你起來了
Mr. Olgaren, you’re up.

596
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,730
先生
Mister...?

597
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,530
奧加侖先生
Mr. Olgaren?

598
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,740
奧加侖先生，你能不能走開？
Mr. Olgaren, will you please go away?

599
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,380
求你了
Please.

600
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,450
所有桅桿都弄好了
That’s every mast.

601
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,460
還有其他天才想法嗎，克萊門斯先生？
Any other strokes of genius, Mr. Clemens?

602
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,410
你們聽見了嗎？
Do you hear that?

603
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,880
什麼？
What?

604
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,730
天啊
Oh, my God.

605
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,130
救命！
Help!

606
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,570
救命！
Help!

607
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,280
托比！
Toby! Toby!

608
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,290
奧加侖？
Olgaren?

609
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,160
奧加侖？
Olgaren?

610
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,980
救命！
Help!

611
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,250
托比
Toby.

612
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,670
托比？
Toby?

613
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:11,900
托比，開門！
- Toby. - Open the door!

614
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:22,630
托比，開門
Toby, open the door.

615
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,120
托比？
Toby?

616
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,650
快開門！
Open the door!

617
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,960
快開門
-Open the door.

618
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,060
托比？
Toby?

619
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,660
開門，托比！
Open the-- Toby! Toby!

620
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,270
托比！
Toby!

621
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,310
托比！
- Toby! - Toby!

622
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:57,710
我夠不到門鎖
I can’t reach the lock.

623
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,440
托比！
Toby!

624
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,650
托比！
-Toby!

625
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:12,930
托比！
-Toby! -Toby!

626
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,880
托比！
Toby! Toby!

627
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,860
托比！
Toby! Toby!

628
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:44,960
讓開！
Move!

629
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,690
托比！
-Toby! Toby!

630
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,200
托比！
Toby!

631
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,670
托比！
Toby!

632
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,540
托比？
Toby?

633
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:11,380
托比
Toby. Toby.

634
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,890
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

635
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,390
你不會有事的，孩子
You will be fine, my boy.

636
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,790
會好起來的
Everything will be fine.

637
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:57,560
克萊門斯先生會治好你的
Mr. Clemens will take care of us.

638
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,270
8月1日
August 1st.

639
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:09,540
我們應該已經駛過了多佛海峽
We must be past the Strait of Dover.

640
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,540
還有五天才到倫敦
Still five days to London.

641
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:16,780
上帝好像已經拋棄了我們
God seems to have deserted us,

642
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,750
我們陷入了可怕的噩夢之中
and we are drifting to some terrible doom.

643
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,520
願主保佑我們
Lord help us.

644
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,390
他瘋了
He’s mad.

645
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:31,000
被控制了
As if possessed.

646
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
-被那個野獸附身了？　-不是
Possessed by that beast? -Oh, no, no.

647
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,300
不是你想的那樣
Not in the way you mean, at least.

648
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:38,240
更像是某種毒藥...
It’s like a poison or...

649
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,630
或者感染
an infection.

650
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:42,170
感染？
Infection?

651
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,800
我可沒見過這種感染
Not like any I’ve ever seen.

652
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:50,680
我能感覺到
I can feel it.

653
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,350
奧加侖？
Olgaren?

654
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,780
你能聽見我說話嗎？
Can you hear me?

655
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,890
我能聽見一切
I can hear everything.

656
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:03,200
大海
The sea.

657
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,260
風
The wind.

658
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,630
你血管中流淌的血液
The blood pumping in your veins.

659
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,770
它會燃燒
It burns.

660
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:20,010
燃燒？他可能想喝水
Burn? Maybe he needs some water.

661
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:24,280
它會燃燒
It burns.

662
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,050
奧加侖？
Olgaren?

663
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,320
燃燒
Burns.

664
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:36,200
它會燃燒
It burns! It burns!

665
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,430
它會燃燒
It burns!

666
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,430
它會燃燒
It burns!

667
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,690
上帝啊
Oh, for God’s sake.

668
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:40,560
沒有人能說點什麼嗎？
Will someone say something?

669
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:46,130
他到底是怎麼回事？
What the hell happened to him?

670
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,470
我警告過你們
I warned you.

671
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:51,960
我警告過你們所有人
I warned all you, didn’t I?

672
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,870
這是對我們罪孽的懲罰
It is a punishment brought down for our sins.

673
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:56,280
彼得羅夫斯基，罪犯
Petrofsky, a criminal.

674
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,770
奧加侖，吉普賽異教徒
Olgaren, gypsy heathen.

675
01:08:58,770 --> 01:08:59,940
嫖客，好色之徒
A whoremonger, a lecher.

676
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,780
還有從蛾摩拉城來的...，注：《聖經》中因其居民罪惡深重而被神毀滅的古城
And from Gomorrah herself...

677
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:05,220
閉嘴吧，你這個蠢貨
Oh, will you shut the hell up, you bleedin’ idiot!

678
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:14,060
艾布拉姆斯，你去站早班崗
Abrams, take the morning watch.

679
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,030
約瑟夫，等他輪班結束你去替他...
And, Joseph, you are to relieve him when he’s...

680
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:19,070
下一個從冥界回來的就是那孩子
That child will be the next to rise up from death.

681
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:22,860
撒旦的黑色血液已經玷污了他的血管
Satan’s black blood pumping corruption through his veins.

682
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,830
上帝之怒已經將臨...
God’s anger has come upon this vessel like Jonah...

683
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,470
閉嘴！
Just shut it up!

684
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:30,410
去查看補給
See to the supplies.

685
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,480
不管奧加侖到底染上了什麼...
Whatever was in Olgaren...

686
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:42,090
...那孩子估計也一樣
...it’s fair to assume it is in the boy.

687
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,850
他們的症狀完全相同
He has all the same symptoms.

688
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,390
但是你用輸血救了那個女孩
But your blood transfusions saved the girl.

689
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:48,260
托比不行
-Not Toby. -

690
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,200
他太小了，也太虛弱
He’s smaller. He’s weaker.

691
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,730
傷口更嚴重，失血更多
The wound was worse, and the blood loss is greater.

692
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:56,760
他...
Just...

693
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,110
我不知道，我覺得...
I don’t know. I think, uh...

694
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:06,910
我覺得我們應該決定是不是...
I think we might have to start discussing...

695
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,490
你去啊
Go on.

696
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:20,430
動手的時候看著他的眼睛
Look him in the eye when you do it.

697
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:23,690
我不是這個意思
That’s not what I meant. That is not what I meant.

698
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,960
它肯定就藏在這裡，如果我們能找到它
It has to be hiding here. If we can find it,

699
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,240
也許能找到辦法救他...
I think we might be able to figure out a way to save him...

700
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,960
你真的是為那孩子著想嗎？
Are you sure the boy is the one that’s on your mind?

701
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,900
回房去吧
Get to your bunk.

702
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,870
我們的人手已經不夠了
We’re running out of men for the watch at this rate.

703
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,700
安娜
Anna.

704
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,910
你是不是要去打開箱子？
You’re going to open the crates, aren’t you?

705
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,310
是的
Yes.

706
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,780
回房去吧，鎖好門
Go back to the shed and bolt the door.

707
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,250
克萊門斯先生，我們都困在同一艘船上
We are all trapped on the same ship, Mr. Clemens.

708
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,420
他需要食物是因為你救了我
Are you forgetting it needs to feed because you saved me?

709
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,360
我跟你一起去
I’m coming with you.

710
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,790
那東西已經殺了好幾個船員
This thing has killed most the crew.

711
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:29,920
那想象一下，如果讓它抵達倫敦會是什麼情形
Then imagine what it will do if we let it get to London.

712
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,090
走吧
Let’s go.

713
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,380
要是我們能找到你們那的惡魔，能用子彈殺死它嗎？
If we do find your devil, will bullets kill it?

714
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,510
他已經控制我們村莊幾個世代了
He has controlled my village for generations.

715
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:50,380
你覺得我會知道怎麼殺他嗎？
Do you think I have any notion how to kill him?

716
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,390
我一直都不喜歡槍
I never liked guns.

717
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:57,460
你應該...
I want you to have...

718
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:10,210
7月16日
Let’s see. Sixth of July.

719
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:13,160
私人貨物，運至倫敦卡法克斯修道院
Private cargo consigned for Carfax Abbey in London.

720
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,900
沒寫貨主
Doesn’t say the owner.

721
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,270
祂告訴約拿，他被寬恕了
He told Jonah, and he was spared.

722
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:46,700
他被寬恕了
He was spared.

723
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:50,670
「我遭遇患難求告耶和華」
"I cried out to the Lord because of my affliction,"

724
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,010
「祂應允我」
"and he answered me."

725
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,280
「我在魚腹中禱告」
"Out of the belly of Sheol I cried,"

726
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,680
「祂聽到了我的聲音」
"and you heard my voice."

727
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:04,520
「你將我投下深淵」
"For you cast me into the deep,"

728
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,530
「投下海的深處」
"into the heart of the seas."

729
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,630
為什麼要去倫敦？因為在我的國家
Why London? Because in my country,

730
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,090
已經沒有人能餵養他了
there is no one left to feed on.

731
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,300
從這個開始吧
Let’s start with this one.

732
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,960
泥土
Dirt.

733
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,260
只有泥土
It’s nothing but dirt.

734
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,910
不在這裡
Nothing.

735
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,860
這個好像不一樣
This one looks different.

736
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,750
快看
Look.

737
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,200
我們找到惡魔的棲身處了
We have found where the devil sleeps.

738
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:46,240
「我呼喊」
DRACULA "I cried,"

739
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:53,050
「你聽到了我的聲音」
"and you heard my voice."

740
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:57,280
主啊...
Oh, Lord...

741
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,860
主啊
Oh, Lord.

742
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:00,090
上帝啊
Oh, God.

743
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:03,190
上帝啊
Oh, God.

744
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,300
上帝啊！
Oh, God!

745
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,940
右舷的救生艇不見了！
Hey! The starboard lifeboat’s gone!

746
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,980
艾布拉姆斯，看到了嗎？
Abrams, do you see it?

747
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,850
沒有，不在這裡
No. There’s nothing here.

748
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,380
沒找到
Nothing.

749
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,060
不
No.

750
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,040
先生，你聽到沒有？
Sir, not supposing you heard?

751
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:58,920
你本來會是個很好的船長，沃伊切克先生
You would have made a good captain, Mr. Wojchek.

752
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:04,250
如果我們能抵達倫敦
 If we had just seen London.

753
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,530
沃伊切克先生
Mr. Wojchek.

754
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:22,300
托比怎麼樣了？，我要不要給他帶點...
How’s Toby? Shall I bring him some...

755
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,180
這條船他媽的到底是怎麼回事？
What the hell is happening on this ship?!

756
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,700
艾里奧特船長
Captain Eliot.

757
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,900
我們已經...
We’ve, uh...

758
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,970
我們用帆布裹好了托比的遺體，先生
we’ve wrapped Toby’s body in canvas, sir.

759
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:00,110
我們是被詛咒的船員，克萊門斯先生
We’re a doomed crew, Mr. Clemens.

760
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:04,920
在一條被詛咒的船上
On a doomed ship.

761
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,620
現在的航線不是我們設定的
We no longer plot our course.

762
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:10,720
是下面的惡魔設定的
The devil below does.

763
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,490
我們都知道他想送我們去哪兒
And we all know where he plans to deliver us.

764
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,520
是地獄，克萊門斯先生
To hell, Mr. Clemens.

765
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:24,130
所有人，一個接一個
Each of us, one by one.

766
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,750
船長？
Captain?

767
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,590
上帝...
Dear Lord...

768
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:54,490
...請帶走這個可愛的孩子
...take this sweet boy.

769
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:58,370
願他永不再飢餓
May he never again be hungry,

770
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:00,370
永不再寒冷...
never be cold...

771
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,400
...永不再恐懼
...never be scared.

772
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,010
這個世界殘忍又冷漠
This world is cruel and uncaring.

773
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:13,220
願托比的下一個家園更加溫暖美好
May Toby find his next home to be a kinder one.

774
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,190
阿門
Amen.

775
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,220
阿門
Amen.

776
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,730
阿門
Amen.

777
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:24,900
等等
Wait.

778
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:30,630
我看到他動了，他還活著
I saw him move. He’s alive.

779
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:37,310
艾里奧特船長，他已經沒有呼吸了
Captain Eliot, the boy has no breath in his body.

780
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:40,210
也沒有心跳，他已經走了
He has no heartbeat. He’s gone.

781
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,080
船長，你坐下吧
Captain, you should sit.

782
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,890
我說了，他還活著，他動了
I tell you, he’s alive. He moved.

783
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:50,890
艾里奧特船長，別這樣
Captain Eliot, please.

784
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,410
不！
-No!

785
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:18,540
沃伊切克先生，我能跟你談談嗎？
Mr. Wojchek, can I... can I speak with you?

786
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:23,020
我們有個計劃，如果我們能...
We have a plan. If we can...

787
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,780
我們經歷了同樣的事，你們居然還有計劃？
You seen what I seen and you still want to plan.

788
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:28,120
這裡不是劍橋，天文學家
This ain’t Cambridge, astronomer.

789
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,680
你解決不了這裡的事
You can’t think your way out of this one.

790
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,260
我是從劍橋拿到醫學學位的
I was one of the first Black doctors

791
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,860
第一批黑人醫生之一
to graduate from Cambridge with medical degree.

792
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:37,160
我跟你說過這個嗎？
Have I told you that?

793
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,690
你可真厲害...
Well, that’s very nice for you...

794
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:40,530
我申請了全國所有的一流醫院
I applied to all the best hospitals in the country.

795
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,170
但每次都被立刻告知沒有崗位空缺
Immediately, I was told there were no positions available.

796
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:46,940
我為了學習付出了一切
I fought tooth and nail for my education,

797
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,640
但沒人給我實踐的機會
and yet no one would let me practice it.

798
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:52,470
我最後通過郵寄申請得到了一個職位
Finally, I was offered a position by post.

799
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:56,480
羅馬尼亞國王卡羅爾一世的皇家醫師
Royal physician to King Carol the First of Romania.

800
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,220
他們認可了我的能力
My name, it reached them somehow.

801
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,060
但後來又因為我的膚色拒絕了我
But the color of my skin, it would later seem, had not.

802
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:15,300
有一次晚餐的時候，艾里奧特船長問我
Captain Eliot once asked me over dinner

803
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,500
我最渴望的是什麼
what I most desired.

804
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:20,440
我說我想讓這個世界符合邏輯
I told him I wanted the world to make sense.

805
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:27,740
沃伊切克先生，我需要這個世界符合邏輯
I need this world to make sense, Mr. Wojchek.

806
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,080
那個野獸--
This beast--

807
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,350
聽清楚我的話，它就是個野獸--
and mark my words, it is a beast--

808
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:38,260
我也需要它符合邏輯
deep down, I need it to make sense, too.

809
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,930
我需要知道
I need to know why

810
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:42,060
它為什麼是這個樣子，為什麼會這樣做
it is the way it is and why it does what it does.

811
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,690
然後我會讓那野獸知道
And then I will remind the beast that it,

812
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:46,730
它和這個世界一樣，絕對不會讓我屈服
like the world, has absolutely no hold over me.

813
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,600
然後呢？
And then?

814
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:51,910
然後我要殺了那個該死的東西
And then I want to kill the cursed thing.

815
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:57,540
如果我們封鎖這個船艙…
If we barricade this cabin,

816
01:23:57,540 --> 01:24:00,670
看風向，我們一天後就能到倫敦
we are a day from London with this wind.

817
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:03,710
現在的人手已經不能再啓航了
Can’t set more sail, crew what it is.

818
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:05,680
那你想怎麼樣？在黑暗中
What, you want us to wait around, eyes in the dark,

819
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,220
等人給我們上菜？
served up and ready for dinner?

820
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,190
那天晚上它從我們的槍口下逃跑了
It ran from our guns in the night.

821
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,290
它不會冒險直接攻擊的
It won’t risk an outright attack.

822
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:12,220
逃跑？
Running? -It’s...

823
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,420
它不是逃跑
It was not running.

824
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,160
是在節省口糧
It was rationing.

825
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:20,330
節省口糧？
Rationing?

826
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,140
每晚吃一個
One a night.

827
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:32,640
我們進入開闊水域不再停靠的時候
Once we had hit open waters and could no longer make port.

828
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,410
它一直藏在甲板下面
It hid below deck,

829
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:41,850
靠安娜為生
sustaining off Anna until then.

830
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,320
但是現在我們的位置已經符合它的要求了
But now it has us right where it wants us, doesn’t it?

831
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,850
就像他說的，離倫敦只有一天航程了
Like he said, London’s only a day away.

832
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,630
它不需要留著我們了
It no longer needs us.

833
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:57,470
所以我們必須在抵達前殺了它
So we have to kill it before it reaches the coast.

834
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:59,170
殺了它？
Kill it?

835
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,730
我們甚至都找不到它
We can’t even find it.

836
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:04,110
能找到
No, we can’t.

837
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:06,340
所以我們要設下陷阱
It is why we’re to set a trap.

838
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:08,310
必須把船沈掉
We must sink the ship.

839
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:10,280
讓它一起沈下去
With him on it.

840
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,680
沈掉德米特？
Demeter?

841
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,610
你瘋了嗎？！
Have you gone mad?!

842
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:15,450
她說得對
She’s right.

843
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:17,450
我們要設下埋伏，把它困在下沈的船上
We set up an ambush and leave it on the sinking ship.

844
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:20,130
然後我們可以坐救生艇離開
Then we can escape on one of the lifeboats.

845
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:22,760
只要航向正確，我們應該就能靠岸
If the course is right, we should be able to make shore.

846
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,430
這是我的家
This is my home.

847
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:28,860
我才不會為了那東西把她毀掉！
And I won’t tear her apart for this fucking thing!

848
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,330
我就是在船上長大的，沃伊切克先生
I grew up on a boat, Mr. Wojchek.

849
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:32,340
就像這艘船
Just like this one.

850
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:35,010
我父親當了一輩子水手
My father was a deckhand his whole life.

851
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:37,280
他經常跟我說...
He always told me that the...

852
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:41,210
船隻的生命
the ship, the living part,

853
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:42,480
在於船上的人
is the men on board.

854
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,880
在於船員
The crews.

855
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,190
在於她的故事
The stories.

856
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:48,750
除此之外就只是木頭和鐵釘
Everything else is just timber and nails.

857
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:51,120
不行！
No!

858
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,230
這是我的家
This is my home.

859
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,070
她是我的
She’s mine.

860
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,640
讓我來吧
It’s going to be me.

861
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:11,900
我們封住貨艙
We barricade the hold,

862
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,910
所以它只有一條路能來到甲板
so that he only has one way out on deck.

863
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:18,650
入夜後，安娜去船舵那裡
As night falls, Anna will be at the helm.

864
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:20,750
等它來找安娜
When it comes for her,

865
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:23,980
我們就從瞭望台射擊
we’ll have a clear shot from the crow’s nest.

866
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,690
然後沈船
We sink the ship

867
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:28,260
讓受傷的野獸葬身海底
and send the wounded beast to a watery grave.

868
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,580
7月21日
21 July.

869
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,090
8月4日
Fourth August.

870
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:59,460
它不敢碰…必須送托比回家
It dare not touch-- You got to get Toby home.

871
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:00,560
1830...
1830...

872
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,790
船長
Captain.

873
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:03,890
不行，必須讓大家知道
No, uh, people need to know.

874
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,270
日誌，要留下記錄
Uh, logs. There needs to be a record.

875
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:07,790
德米特號保不住了
is lost, sir.

876
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:09,500
我們要棄船了
We’re abandoning ship.

877
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,630
棄船？
Abandoning ship?

878
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:14,800
是的，先生
Aye, sir.

879
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:22,550
沃伊切克先生正在甲板下做準備呢
Mr. Wojchek’s below deck making preparations as we speak.

880
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,280
我們會把沈船
We’ll leave the beast a sinking ship

881
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,650
留給那野獸當告別禮
as a farewell gift.

882
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:33,290
他來找我了
He comes to me.

883
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:38,460
他在我的腦子里跟我說話了
He whispers to me behind my own eyes.

884
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:44,000
他能把托比帶回來
He can bring Toby back.

885
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,800
他把托比帶走了，也能帶回來
He took him away. He can bring him back.

886
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,500
船長，你清醒一點
Captain, come to your senses.

887
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,970
你知道這不可能
You know that’s not possible.

888
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:51,570
托比...
Toby...

889
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:53,250
托比
Toby.

890
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,180
我必須帶德米特號靠岸
I just need to bring to shore.

891
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:58,250
對不起，克萊門斯先生
I’m sorry, Mr. Clemens.

892
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,450
-不！　-船長
-No! -ANNA: Captain. -

893
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:01,780
你跟我都見過他
You have seen him as I have.

894
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:03,390
你也知道這不是真的
You know deep down that is not all.

895
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:19,170
在夢中，我有時候...
When I dream, sometimes...

896
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,770
能記起自己是誰
I remember who I was.

897
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:23,030
遇見他之前的自己
Before him.

898
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:27,780
但大部分時候，我夢到的都是他關我的那個盒子
But most often, I think of the box he kept me in.

899
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:33,720
夢到他來找我，撕裂我的皮肉
How every time he came for me and tore into my flesh,

900
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,650
暢飲我的鮮血
drank his fill,

901
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:39,720
泥土會進入新鮮的傷口
dirt would seep into the fresh wound,

902
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,020
把我填滿
filling me up.

903
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:44,020
你們不能沈掉德米特號
Demeter.

904
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,860
想想托比的臉
Picture Toby’s face.

905
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:49,900
想想他的笑容
His smile, his laugh.

906
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:53,060
再想想他被泥土填滿的樣子
And think of that dirt filling him up, too,

907
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:56,380
因為這就是惡魔的所作所為
because that’s what the devil does.

908
01:28:56,380 --> 01:29:00,540
他奪走你的所愛...
He takes what is good and what you love, and he...

909
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:04,650
利用它，扭曲它，然後讓它從內部腐爛
he uses it, and he twists it, and he rots it from within.

910
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,320
被讓他也這麼毀掉你對托比的回憶
Do not let him do that to the memory of your boy.

911
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,790
我會...
I will...

912
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:54,190
我會駕船駛向深海
I will sail the ship out to sea.

913
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:59,130
等她沈沒的時候...
And when she finally goes...

914
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:06,540
那個怪物絕不會染指我熟悉的家
...the monster will never be able to reach the home I knew.

915
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:09,650
托比熟悉的家
That Toby knew.

916
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:11,450
船長
Captain,

917
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:14,010
你沒必要留在德米特號上
there’s no need for you Demeter.

918
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:20,620
我能去哪，克萊門斯先生？
Where would I go, Mr. Clemens?

919
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:45,280
你覺得能成功嗎？
Do you think this’ll work?

920
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,050
必須成功
It has to.

921
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:51,950
看那裡
There she is. -

922
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:54,120
英格蘭海岸
The shores of England.

923
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,460
那裡好像有風暴
And looks like there’s a storm blowing in.

924
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,530
注意甲板
Keep your eyes on the deck.

925
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:57,460
什麼都看不到
I can’t see a bloody thing.

926
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,560
安靜
Quiet.

927
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:08,800
你不用待在這裡
You don’t need to be here.

928
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:12,740
你可以跟艾里奧特船長一起，留在甲板下面
You could stay below deck with Captain Eliot.

929
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,000
那樣更安全
Stay safe.

930
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,370
我和惡魔有連結
We are connected, the devil and I.

931
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:23,550
你這麼聰明，肯定已經注意到了
You are smart enough to have noticed.

932
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:25,820
我能感知到他
I can sense him.

933
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:29,120
能感覺到他
Feel him somehow.

934
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:32,690
他也能感覺到我
He feels it, too.

935
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:36,760
他會來找我的
He will come for me.

936
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:40,860
等他注意到我之後，你們知道該幹什麼呢
And while he’s focused on me, you know what to do.

937
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:16,730
那到底是什麼？
Where the bloody hell is it?

938
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:28,170
那是什麼？
What is it?

939
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:32,410
他都知道，克萊門斯先生
He knows, Mr. Clemens.

940
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:44,030
上帝啊，它有翅膀
Dear God. It has wings.

941
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:45,730
它來了！
It’s coming!

942
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,830
沃伊切克，救救我！
Please, Wojchek! Wojchek, help me!

943
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:54,870
上帝啊，快切斷吧！
For God’s sake, cut it!

944
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:04,410
沃伊切克！
Wojchek!

945
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:15,860
沃伊切克！
Wojchek!

946
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:18,030
沃伊切克！
-Wojchek!

947
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,350
沃伊切克！
-Wojchek!

948
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:15,720
我們來了！
- -We’re coming!

949
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,020
不！準備好救生艇！
No! Get the lifeboat ready!

950
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:59,060
快走！
Go!

951
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,670
快點，離海岸已經很近了！
We have to hurry! We’re close to the shore!

952
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:05,600
我們得帶上沃伊切克和船長
We need Wojchek! And the captain!

953
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,100
我去找他們！
I’ll find ’em!

954
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,680
如果有需要就切斷繩子！
Cut the ropes if you have to, but get it free!

955
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,030
原諒我
Forgive me.

956
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:45,340
沃伊切克！
Wojchek!

957
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:02,520
沃伊切克！
Wojchek!

958
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:12,370
你在哪？
Where are you?

959
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,200
沃伊切克
Wojchek.

960
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,180
安娜
Anna.

961
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:28,550
船長
Captain.

962
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:43,770
船長！
Captain!

963
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:46,600
他來了！
He’s coming. He’s coming!

964
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:02,580
安娜！
Anna!

965
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:03,760
船長！
Captain!

966
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:16,690
上帝啊
Oh, my Lord.

967
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:24,570
惡魔退散！
I renounce you, devil!

968
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:28,380
惡魔退...
I renounce you...

969
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:59,910
船長
Captain.

970
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:16,720
克萊門斯先生
Mr. Clemens.

971
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,490
告訴大家，好嗎？
Let them know, will you?

972
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:24,430
告訴大家，我...
Let them know I was true...

973
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:26,330
盡忠職守
to my trust.

974
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,370
我會的，船長，我保證
I will, Captain. I promise.

975
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:10,480
你想讓他們敬你為神？
You want them to believe that you’re a god!

976
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:13,610
你我都知道你根本不是神！
You and I both know that you’re not!

977
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:18,320
你跟我們一樣，也會流血！
You bleed like any of us!

978
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:22,320
你睡在泥土之中！
You sleep in dirt!

979
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,260
你需要食物！
You feed!

980
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:26,690
最重要的是，你需要食物！
Above all else, you feed!

981
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:29,600
你想讓我們都怕你！
You want us to... to fear you!

982
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,010
但其實你也害怕！
Underneath, you’re afraid!

983
01:40:33,010 --> 01:40:35,440
跟所有生靈一樣
You’re afraid of what lies on the other side

984
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,040
你也害怕另一個世界！
as any other living thing!

985
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,550
你在我的頭腦里
You are in my head.

986
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:27,990
在我的血液里
In my blood.

987
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,390
你已經讓我墮入了地獄！
You have damned me to hell!

988
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:46,440
混蛋！
You bastard!

989
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:52,120
安娜！
-Anna!

990
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,710
安娜，快上船
Anna, get to the boat.

991
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,300
我不...
I do not...

992
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:11,760
怕你
f-fear you.

993
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:19,670
你會怕的
You will.

994
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:36,290
去死吧，惡魔！
Die, you devil!

995
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:32,090
老天啊
Jesus.

996
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:33,940
-怎麼了？　-快去叫警官
- What’s wrong? - Run and fetch the constable.

997
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:35,950
告訴他有艘船要破浪抵岸
Tell him there’s a ship trying to get through the breakers.

998
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:26,800
海岸...
The coast...

999
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,900
很近了
so close.

1000
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:34,100
很近了
It’s close.

1001
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:39,320
克萊門斯先生
Mr. Clemens.

1002
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:43,850
不
No.

1003
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:47,020
不
No. No.

1004
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:48,230
不
No.

1005
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:52,860
我幾天前就知道了
I have known for days now.

1006
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:55,830
對不起
I’m sorry.

1007
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:57,760
我可以再給你輸血...
Another transfusion...

1008
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,210
這只是推遲不可避免的結果而已
Would only delay the inevitable.

1009
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,670
我們都清楚
We both know that.

1010
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,470
但是我可以...
But I can... I can...

1011
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:05,840
-只要…　-不
-If I just... -No.

1012
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:09,840
我不想變成...
I don’t want to become...

1013
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:15,550
我的一生...
My whole life...

1014
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,490
...我的同胞
...my people,

1015
01:45:19,490 --> 01:45:22,460
那個惡魔
the devil,

1016
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:24,460
是他們給我選的
they chose for me.

1017
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:28,120
這次，是我選的
I choose this.

1018
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,800
是我自己選的
No one else.

1019
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,900
你救了我
You saved me.

1020
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:38,130
你也救過我
And you me.

1021
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:51,610
關於惠特比的幽靈船
It’s all about the ghost ship at Whitby.

1022
01:46:51,610 --> 01:46:52,810
沒有幸存者
No survivors.

1023
01:46:52,810 --> 01:46:54,390
先生，來一份吧？
How about you, sir?

1024
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:56,320
來一份日報吧？
The Dailygraph?

1025
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,650
來份報紙吧，只要兩便士
Get your paper here, only a cost of a tuppence.

1026
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:02,390
關於惠特比的幽靈船
It’s all about the ghost ship at Whitby.

1027
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:04,120
沒有幸存者
No survivors.

1028
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:14,310
我抵達了倫敦
I’ve arrived in London.

1029
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:19,070
那個生物在這裡尋找鮮血
The creature hunts for blood somewhere in the city,

1030
01:47:19,070 --> 01:47:22,910
但我知道它白天在那裡休息
but I know where it lays to rest during the day.

1031
01:47:22,910 --> 01:47:24,650
卡法克斯修道院？
Carfax Abbey?

1032
01:47:24,650 --> 01:47:27,110
你就是新主人？
You the new owner?

1033
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:29,320
不，女士，我只是在找他
No, miss. Just looking for him.

1034
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:32,080
坐馬車也要幾個小時
Oh, well, it’s a couple hours to reach the abbey

1035
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:34,490
才能到修道院
in a carriage from here.

1036
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:36,690
野外很黑的
It gets dark on the moors.

1037
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:39,430
我要是你就等到早晨
If I was you, I’d wait till morning.

1038
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:41,930
我也是這麼想的
You know, miss, I was thinking the same thing.

1039
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:56,450
我終於看到了
I have finally seen the true darkness

1040
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:59,780
這個世界表象之下的真正黑暗
that dwells beneath the surface of this world,

1041
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:04,950
科學與理性都無法解釋的邪惡
the evil that neither science nor reason can explain.

1042
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:07,690
但我也看到了它的美好
Yet I have also seen its beauty

1043
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:10,920
以及那些願意付出一切去守護它的人
and those willing to give all to protect it.

1044
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:14,050
所以我會追捕這邪惡的野獸
And so I will pursue this foul beast.

1045
01:49:14,050 --> 01:49:17,090
我向那些付出了生命的人起誓
And I swear by those who have given their lives

1046
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:20,190
我會消滅這災星
that I will extinguish this blight

1047
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:23,570
把它送回地獄
and send it back to hell.
