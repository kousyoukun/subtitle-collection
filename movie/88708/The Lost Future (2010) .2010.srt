1
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:47,303
Savan!

2
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:55,122
Uri has ordered us to turn back.
Savan!

3
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:58,612
Age has made him too cautious.

4
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:01,911
He's my father,
I can speak of him as I wish.

5
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,870
When you're chief, you'll want respect.

6
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:06,839
It's not just a matter of respect.

7
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:08,966
Now, stay close...

8
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,334
And tonight, Yomak,

9
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:11,969
You will feast on the heart with me.

10
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:28,690
Are you deaf, Savan?

11
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:32,505
We do not separate, ever.

12
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:38,250
- You may not agree with my methods.
- We haven't had fresh meat in weeks.

13
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:40,857
Roots and berries
are not enough for us.

14
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,118
You've got a lot to learn, Savan.

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,144
I've proved myself
the best hunter in this tribe

16
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:49,947
Hunting is not just about courage.
You've got to be clever, too.

17
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:54,007
- We are not the only predators out here.
- We are tired of being hungry.

18
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,547
Let me lead this hunt,
and we will make our kill,

19
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:59,247
And tonight the village
will have reason to celebrate,

20
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,219
And the women will show their gratitude.

21
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:07,744
Very well, Savan, lead.

22
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:13,582
Follow me.
Watch for my signal.

23
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,337
Kaleb?

24
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:32,116
What's it to be then,
Roast Kaleb or boiled Kaleb?

25
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:36,525
- You belong with the women, Not with the hunt.
- It's ahead. I've tracked it.

26
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:40,230
- Tracked what, the deadly blueberry?
- Enough!

27
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:43,337
That's beyond our hunting grounds.
You know that.

28
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,937
It's out there, Right in front of us,
Only 200 paces.

29
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,888
This is as far as we go.
We already pushed our luck.

30
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:53,203
It's too dangerous.
Maybe if we're quick...

31
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:02,172
200 paces, that's it.

32
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:23,363
I tracked it!

33
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:26,363
Tracking's one thing,
Bringing it down is another.

34
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:30,025
Stay back, or you'll only get hurt.

35
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:07,631
Look out!

36
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:12,770
Get it!

37
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,360
Pull!

38
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:36,994
That's it!

39
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,262
- Evan, go cut the heart out!
- Yeah, cut it out!

40
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,139
The honor of today's hunt is Savan's
And Kaleb's.

41
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:37,804
You will share the heart tonight.

42
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,958
- It was my kill.
- Your blow brought it down,

43
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,089
But it was Kaleb's skills
that led us here. Is that not so?

44
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:48,352
Savan!

45
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:52,143
- Yomak?
- Help me.

46
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:54,137
No! Stay back, all of you!

47
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:58,148
He's been bitten!

48
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,039
Savan!

49
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:09,896
Kill me, Savan. Don't let it take me.
Please.

50
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,679
Savan...
Please!

51
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,045
Please...

52
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,351
Savan!

53
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:32,463
No!

54
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:36,308
No!
I'll kill you!

55
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:39,746
- I'll kill all of you!
- Don't do this! We can't stay here!

56
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:43,122
- I won't run!
- Do you want to kill us, too? We can't beat them!

57
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,938
They killed him!

58
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,674
Savan!

59
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:19,564
- Dorel.
- Finally. Tonight we feast.

60
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:23,916
We lost Yomak today.

61
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:26,612
He was bitten.

62
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:31,293
Kaleb!

63
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,439
- You don't stand a chance.
- What?

64
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:38,990
Oh, come on. You can't keep
secrets from your sister.

65
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:41,654
We know you like Dorel.

66
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:56,446
Well, you never know.
Maybe Dorel doesn't want to marry

67
00:09:56,752 --> 00:10:01,071
A tall, handsome
Future chief.

68
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,318
Yomak's dead.

69
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:22,604
It was my fault.

70
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:28,040
What happened?

71
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:32,054
I led them beyond
our hunting grounds.

72
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,459
He was attacked by beasts.

73
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:42,064
The beasts are here.
It's only a matter of time befores.

74
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,339
- We must leave grey rock.
- You saw them with your own eyes?

75
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,069
Yomak was bitten.
That's all I needed to see.

76
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:53,858
Uri...
We've been safe here all this time.

77
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:57,490
Did you go beyond
our hunting grounds?

78
00:10:57,797 --> 00:11:01,036
The tribe needed meat.
There was none here.

79
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:06,098
- Then we have no choice. We have to leave.
- And go where? There is nowhere else.

80
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:10,823
We are the last survivors of man.
God chose us and led us to grey rock

81
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,689
And kept us safe here for generations.
Are we to doubt him now?

82
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:18,362
We should not run,
or wait for them to come.

83
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:21,310
- We should fight.
- There are too many to fight,

84
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:25,868
And you know the consequences if we do,
Or have you forgotten about Yomak Already?

85
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:29,412
- Then we should continue to live like cowards
- Careful what you say, Savan.

86
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:36,593
If it's god's will. That they must find
us here, Then we must accept our fate.

87
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:41,207
The beasts are a judgment against us,
A punishment for the sins of our fathers.

88
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:45,384
- Was it god's will that my friend should die?
- Why can't we choose our own fate?

89
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:48,431
Hold your tongue.
You've got no business here, Kaleb.

90
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:52,272
- My father spoke of other tribes--
- Your father didn't listen to the elders

91
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:56,228
And suffered the same fate as any man
Who goes beyond our hunting grounds.

92
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,747
He went to look for a better life.
For us all.

93
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:03,848
- What kind of a man abandons his children?
- He sought the truth.

94
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:08,373
- Our laws are the only truth.
- He's right, Kaleb.

95
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:13,512
- There's nothing out there but disease and death.
- As you have seen today.

96
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,159
The elders will discuss this. Savan, for your
disrespect, You will take guard duty tonight,

97
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,268
And the two of you will forfeit
the heart of the sloth To the elders.

98
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:46,353
- Why do you get yourself into trouble On father's account?
- Should I not question them?

99
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:50,634
Kaleb, it is the elders who have kept us safe,
Not our father.

100
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:54,724
They don't like to be questioned.

101
00:12:55,716 --> 00:13:00,195
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.
He's not coming back.

102
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:04,347
- He always came back before--
- Yeah, well, not this time.

103
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:09,753
- It's been almost three years, Kaleb.
- I've had enough of living in hiding, Miru.

104
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:15,014
I want to know what's out there.

105
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:20,154
Don't leave me, Kaleb.
You're the only family I have.

106
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:25,185
- Then come with me.
- Kaleb, listen to the elders. There is no one else out there.

107
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:29,827
That's what they believe. What
about all the things he brought back?

108
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:33,571
Things from the old world. Those people died
many years ago. It doesn't prove anything.

109
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:37,440
He told me he had met others,
talked to others.

110
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:40,556
Yeah?
Well, where are they?

111
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:44,960
Why haven't they come?
Why hasn't he come?

112
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,869
Well, I will come back, Miru.

113
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,824
I promise.

114
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:30,986
Beasts!

115
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:24,694
Protect the cave!

116
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:49,288
Go to the cave!
Go to the bat cave!

117
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:42,711
No...

118
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,169
No!

119
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,351
There's too many!

120
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:10,803
Savan, what do we do?
Savan!

121
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,884
- Savan!
- Use the trees! Circle the beasts!

122
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:23,136
Go! Close the cave!

123
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,982
- Into the cave!
- Kaleb!

124
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:29,181
- Miru!
- Kaleb!

125
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:32,027
- Everybody in the cave!
- Get into the cave, Miru!

126
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:34,902
Miru! Get into the cave!

127
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,099
Everybody, get in here now!

128
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:42,833
Quickly!
That's it!

129
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:44,737
Okay!

130
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,969
Close it!

131
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,264
If you don't do it, we all die!

132
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,274
- Do it now!
- But others are still out there!

133
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:08,024
Do it!

134
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:09,002
Are you okay?

135
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,947
- How many?
- Too many.

136
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,779
We have to distract them,
Get them away from the cave.

137
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:41,895
- Then what?
- You have a better idea?

138
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,259
- Go for help.
- From where? You're ranting just like your father.

139
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:50,917
- There may be people who can help us.
- The elders never spoke of anyone else.

140
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:54,265
The elders are trapped in the cave!

141
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,619
Those beasts will not give up
until they are all dead.

142
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:03,370
We are the only chance
to survive.

143
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:07,361
- We should go to the mountains, look for other tribes.
- There are beasts in the mountains...

144
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:10,081
There are beasts right here.

145
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,306
- Shouldn't we at least try?
- I'm not going to run away.

146
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,238
What if Kaleb's right?
What if there are others?

147
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:26,195
If he is right, Then everything
we have ever been told Is a lie.

148
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:31,275
Do you really take his word Over the elders,
And the generation of elders before them?

149
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:36,638
But if we stay here and fight the beasts
alone, We will die, And so will our tribe.

150
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:40,375
And so will you.
Come on.

151
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:05,210
One day. You've got one day to find some other
people, Then Dorel and I are turning back.

152
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:25,337
Kaleb, what is this?

153
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:28,720
It's a book.

154
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,607
What do you do with it?

155
00:22:33,892 --> 00:22:39,091
It's from the past. People used to put
their thoughts and ideas In books like this.

156
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:44,634
After the disease came, Everyone was
too busy trying to survive. Books died.

157
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:50,175
- Where did you get this book?
- My father brought it back.

158
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,277
- He taught me to read.
- Read?

159
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,270
To know what the pages are saying.

160
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,318
"monday morning
Tom sawyer felt miserable..."

161
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,663
Your father has corrupted you.

162
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,383
We don't have time for this.

163
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:22,642
Which is why we kept it a secret.

164
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,308
Go.
Go!

165
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:56,277
Kill it!

166
00:24:56,517 --> 00:25:00,596
- It's my father!
- Your father's gone! That's not him!

167
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:27,791
It's all right.

168
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:33,900
This wasn't your father anymore.

169
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:37,540
Kaleb was right.

170
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:40,970
How...
How do you know my name?

171
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,829
I've been watching you
for a long time.

172
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,471
You can read.

173
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:52,840
Like your father.

174
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:57,102
- You know my father?
- I knew him.

175
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,685
What happened?

176
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:08,416
It was his wish That I made sure
no harm came to you.

177
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,769
- Were you bitten?
- What?

178
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:13,900
- Did it bite you?
- No.

179
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:17,387
- No bleeding through the nose?
- What do you mean? No...

180
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:20,606
- We're not infected if that's what you're asking.
- Oh, yes, you are.

181
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:23,854
A mutant has only to breathe on you
To infect you.

182
00:26:24,144 --> 00:26:28,223
The bite is just quicker.
There is still time,

183
00:26:28,562 --> 00:26:31,761
But there will be more of them,
So follow me.

184
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:34,181
You're lying.

185
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:36,797
There's nothing wrong with us.

186
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:42,773
Your mouth will go dry,
And your thirst will be unquenchable.

187
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:47,103
Your lungs will tighten, Your nose will bleed
and your eyes will sting,

188
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:51,395
Then your heart will race. Now, follow me.

189
00:26:57,937 --> 00:27:01,656
- If we're infected, Why did you get so close?
- I'm immune.

190
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:04,338
- What's "immune?"
-I can't catch the disease.

191
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:07,365
How is that possible?

192
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:12,335
The cure is a powder,
A yellow powder.

193
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:18,312
There wasn't much of it, And what
little is left will be hard to get.

194
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,559
We have water,
but there's no food.

195
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:49,895
- Don't worry, they can't get in.
- Yeah, but won't they leave?

196
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:55,663
They know we're here. They won't stop.
They want to kill like rabid dogs.

197
00:27:56,022 --> 00:28:00,181
Then we must pray,
Put ourselves in god's hands.

198
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:04,321
We must have faith.

199
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:08,004
Gather round
And let us pray.

200
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:16,548
Oh, lord, be with us,
Protect us from this evil...

201
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:25,991
Are you taking us
to the yellow powder?

202
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:30,507
We must first go to my home.

203
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:33,812
There are things
we need to pick up.

204
00:28:35,022 --> 00:28:38,141
How come the beasts
never found you out here?

205
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:43,157
They're frightened of water.
Helps keep them at bay.

206
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:50,840
Don't worry.
They'll never cross this water.

207
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:32,012
Did you build this?

208
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,747
It's from the old world.

209
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,863
I just patched it up.

210
00:29:40,566 --> 00:29:42,125
Neenah.

211
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,929
We have visitors.

212
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,898
Why?

213
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,659
He is Jaret's son.

214
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,099
He doesn't belong here.

215
00:29:57,357 --> 00:30:02,356
They need our help. Their village
was attacked by mutants.

216
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:05,931
You brought infected
people here, To our home?

217
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:12,760
They weren't bitten. They
still have some time. Neenah!

218
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,219
- He can read.
- I don't care! How can you be so reckless?

219
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:22,444
- Don't you see what this means?
- It means you've put us in danger.

220
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:27,732
Look at him. He's a boy.
How can he do what jaret did?

221
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:30,866
It's worth the risk.

222
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:39,917
This is our son, Persk.

223
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:42,993
It's been a while
since he's seen others.

224
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,913
- Hi. I'm Dorel...
- Persk...

225
00:31:02,358 --> 00:31:04,877
The beasts have gone.

226
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:11,887
I wouldn't be so sure.

227
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:16,411
It's so quiet.

228
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:19,857
Open it.

229
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:22,107
No... Don't touch the door.

230
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,958
There might be other survivors from
our tribe out there Who need our help.

231
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:29,516
No one else survived, And neither
will we if we open this door.

232
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:33,698
No... Kaleb is not dead.

233
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:37,583
I'm sorry, Miru.

234
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:40,538
He isn't dead!

235
00:31:55,484 --> 00:31:57,643
Neenah...

236
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:03,762
- Neenah, don't be angry.
- I'm scared, amal.

237
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:06,387
I know what you're going to do.
For what?

238
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:11,329
If Kaleb can do what his father did,
Think what that would mean.

239
00:32:13,442 --> 00:32:19,721
But for you to go back there You were
so lucky to get out the last time.

240
00:32:20,153 --> 00:32:22,432
Then think of Persk.

241
00:32:22,694 --> 00:32:26,373
Why should he have to grow up in a
world Where people live in hiding?

242
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,518
It's been good enough for us.

243
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:38,045
We're happy here, aren't we?

244
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,359
But what about his children,
And the others who are out there?

245
00:32:43,568 --> 00:32:48,447
They'll never be safe Unless we can learn
to make the powder.

246
00:32:49,694 --> 00:32:55,373
Are we going to look persk in the eye And tell
him we never took the one chance That came our way?

247
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:00,258
What did your elders teach
you about the disease?

248
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:04,725
That god created it
As punishment for man's sins.

249
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:09,708
The old world was full of greed, And men
created machines that got out of control,

250
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:14,588
And they meddled with nature,
And only god could stop them.

251
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:19,467
Men were trying to perfect
their own design.

252
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:23,217
They found a way to bring
extinct animals back to life

253
00:33:23,527 --> 00:33:26,446
Like the mammoth
and sloth that you hunt,

254
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:30,894
But their science
also brought us the disease.

255
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:34,114
It wasn't long before
the whole world was infected.

256
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:39,121
The disease ate into the human brain,
Turning men into mutants.

257
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:44,740
- How do you know all of this?
- Because I met Kaleb's father.

258
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:50,515
Jaret had the courage
To look for the old knowledge.

259
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:55,300
He found out what really happened.

260
00:33:56,485 --> 00:34:00,324
It was your father, Kaleb,
Who discovered the cure.

261
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:03,212
The yellow powder?

262
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:10,154
It took him many years To find the right mixture
of plants and fungus.

263
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:13,768
Once you inhale the powder,
You're protected.

264
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:17,750
What if you already have...
The disease?

265
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:22,509
Once you have turned,
then the powder is useless...

266
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:26,060
But if you get it in time,
then there is still hope.

267
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:31,200
- So why didn't my father bring the powder home?
- He was doing just that when he died...

268
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,289
And the secret of the powder
died with him.

269
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,769
But you kept the powder.
So you're safe, while we...

270
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:43,430
No. The powder was stolen,
And it will be hard to get it back.

271
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:46,658
But you'll help us try?

272
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:52,845
Yes. If we can keep Kaleb alive,

273
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:57,593
He will be able to carry on
his father's work.

274
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,159
They're all from the old world.

275
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,301
My father would often disappear
for months at a time.

276
00:35:19,487 --> 00:35:24,406
He told me that out there Were answers
to all our questions.

277
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:29,390
I now understand his fascination.

278
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:34,248
Your father had this on him
When he died.

279
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:46,670
He said there'd be
more adventures.

280
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:53,363
I've only read one book. How will I ever
unlock the secret of the yellow powder?

281
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:57,426
You're the only one
who can read, Kaleb.

282
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:02,616
But if we find The powder that exists.
We only need enough for our people.

283
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:08,187
Your father risked everything Teaching you
to read And leaving the safety of his tribe.

284
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:12,370
Now...
I'm risking everything.

285
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:19,136
Saving just a few people
Is not an option.

286
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:33,038
Maybe our prayers
been answered Yisir.

287
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,985
- What are we waiting for?
- That is not god's way!

288
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:47,321
- Well, shouldn't we at least try?
- We will not scurry Into the bowels of the earth
like animals As our forefathers did.

289
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:52,017
- They were punished for their sins!
- Would god punish us for trying to survive?

290
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:57,045
We must have faith And courage,
And wait for this evil to pass.

291
00:36:59,114 --> 00:37:03,433
If i'd have had enough courage,
I would have listened to Kaleb.

292
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:11,122
let me help

293
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:05,864
We should wake them.
Give them one last chance.

294
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,079
They made their choice.

295
00:39:10,283 --> 00:39:12,962
It's time to go.

296
00:39:46,992 --> 00:39:49,951
Uh, w-we're ready to leave.

297
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:56,622
Washing my hair's a simple thing,
But it makes me feel better.

298
00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:03,631
Amal expects me
to perform miracles.

299
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:08,309
- Well, you were the one Who sought the knowledge of the old world.
- Yeah, and the truth,

300
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:12,577
- And Savan still isn't convinced.
- Do not judge him.

301
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:18,627
All these things we never knew Have shattered everything
that we believe in. He finds it hard to accept.

302
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:29,278
Savan will becomes a great chief.

303
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:33,832
He is brave
and ready for the challenge.

304
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:37,157
Still not convinced, I am?

305
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:40,210
We shall know soon enough.

306
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,861
Okay, Persk,
take care of your mom.

307
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:27,240
How deep do you think it is?

308
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:31,495
The ceiling's gone. It could've blocked
the whole tunnel.

309
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:37,106
- No, it can't have. I can still feel a breeze.
- Well, you only need a small gap for that.

310
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:41,201
What are you doing?

311
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:45,852
If it's a small gap, You need a small person
to fit through it.

312
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,489
Miru!

313
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:09,977
- That will stay on top of the water?
- It will,

314
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:14,086
And as long as you stay on,
you'll be safe.

315
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:27,202
Jump.

316
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,869
Come on.
It's okay.

317
00:42:39,371 --> 00:42:43,450
- I'm walking on water.
- Yes, it floats.

318
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:50,685
This river will lead us
to the yellow powder.

319
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:54,274
That's a paddle.
Use both hands.

320
00:42:55,578 --> 00:42:58,337
Here, let me show you.

321
00:42:58,622 --> 00:43:01,021
That's it. Good.

322
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:31,392
I think she's okay.

323
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:35,222
It's okay!
There's a way through!

324
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:37,536
Give me your hand!

325
00:43:37,786 --> 00:43:41,065
- Miru!
- There's something in the water!

326
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:45,985
- There's something in the water!
- What is it?

327
00:43:47,164 --> 00:43:50,363
- Get them off me! Get them off!
- It's okay.

328
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:53,462
- Get them off...
-Miru, it's okay. I'm getting them off.

329
00:43:59,748 --> 00:44:02,227
It's all right,
It's all right...

330
00:44:02,496 --> 00:44:04,895
It's all right.
I think they're all gone.

331
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:08,482
- Do we look for another way?
- No.

332
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,339
We've come too far.

333
00:44:18,747 --> 00:44:23,626
Right. When I go through,
Just get them off me fast, okay?

334
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:12,814
- Paddle!
- Get in the middle!

335
00:45:13,082 --> 00:45:15,641
The middle!
Row to the middle!

336
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:42,832
I fear they will never leave.

337
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:49,702
Let's hope the others
aren't punished For their doubts.

338
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:19,897
There was a group of us,

339
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:25,284
A brotherhood, That was formed to help protect
each tribe from the mutants.

340
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:32,172
After Jaret discovered
the powder,

341
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:38,819
We thought if we could immunize enough tribes, People
could come out of hiding, Start to rebuild the world.

342
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:41,970
But we were betrayed.

343
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:44,608
By one of our own.

344
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:48,988
A man called Gagen
stole the powder.

345
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:53,570
But won't he help us
if he sees that we're sick?

346
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:59,075
You don't know this man.
He turned an island into a fortress,

347
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,657
His empire.

348
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:06,711
Gagen has hordes of followers

349
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:10,397
Who will kill for the chance
to inhale the yellow powder,

350
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:14,554
And kill they do.

351
00:47:17,456 --> 00:47:20,175
- You okay?
- Those leech bites really sting.

352
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:23,778
Yeah, well, not
as much as a beast bite.

353
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:26,763
If you put it that way,
I'm beginning to enjoy it.

354
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:29,322
Over here!

355
00:47:30,751 --> 00:47:34,110
Looks like we got
our miracle after all.

356
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:37,535
Half a miracle.

357
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:41,672
- We've still got to climb it.
- I'll go first.

358
00:47:47,043 --> 00:47:49,122
- Were you bitten?
- No.

359
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:52,815
- Did they claw you?
- We were fighting. I don't know!

360
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:56,484
- Maybe being close is all it takes.
- We don't know that.

361
00:47:56,793 --> 00:48:01,632
- Yeah, but if it is, then we're all infected.
- Then we're all going to turn.

362
00:48:03,374 --> 00:48:06,213
Okay, we'd better get going.

363
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,779
Right.
Let's finish what we started!

364
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:33,463
You know that Kaleb must find his father's
work. Above all else. Do you understand?

365
00:48:44,127 --> 00:48:49,406
- Kaleb. I never thanked you.
- For what?

366
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:53,633
For saving my life
back at the village, After the attack.

367
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:58,285
I haven't saved anyone yet.

368
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:01,383
Well, you saved me,
so thank you.

369
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,969
Oh, no. No...

370
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:34,881
Get down quickly!

371
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:51,684
Go on!
Leave me!

372
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,959
Leave me!

373
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:57,089
I'll carry you!

374
00:49:57,377 --> 00:50:01,656
You two can still get out of here.
I'm dead either way!

375
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:04,002
Move!

376
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,753
Go!

377
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:11,871
No

378
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:37,801
- When the old world died, how many survived?
- It's impossible to say.

379
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:41,930
Each of the brotherhood
came from a tribe of 60 or 70.

380
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:45,851
- Are they all still out there?
- Scattered, staying hidden.

381
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:51,689
We set up these beacons as a warning
system. A beacon is lit, help will come.

382
00:50:52,086 --> 00:50:54,605
That's the theory.

383
00:50:54,879 --> 00:50:58,118
Let's see who's up for the fight.

384
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,381
Run!

385
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,869
What did he say?

386
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,689
Run! Mutants!

387
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:26,797
Run!

388
00:52:35,755 --> 00:52:38,194
Run!
To the raft!

389
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:17,137
- We have to go back!
- No, he's finished!

390
00:53:17,424 --> 00:53:19,783
We can't just leave him.

391
00:53:20,046 --> 00:53:22,765
- We have to go!
- No! Come on!

392
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:26,526
- Where are you going? - Get to the raft, Dorel!
- Without Amal? Come on!

393
00:53:55,048 --> 00:53:58,567
- But what about the brotherhood?
- He lit the beacon! He said others would come!

394
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:03,281
He said they might come. Do you
want to wait along with the beasts?

395
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:06,552
The river is our only chance.

396
00:54:07,716 --> 00:54:09,515
No.

397
00:54:10,883 --> 00:54:14,602
The yellow powder's
our only chance.

398
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:33,300
If this is to be our time,
Let us leave this world together.

399
00:55:37,091 --> 00:55:39,490
We tried.

400
00:55:41,384 --> 00:55:44,743
I never understood
your father before.

401
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,169
He would be proud of you.

402
00:56:09,384 --> 00:56:12,303
- Is it just us?
- Let's hope not.

403
00:56:12,593 --> 00:56:15,352
Have you seen Amal?

404
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:18,914
Well, this is his beacon.
He must be here.

405
00:56:21,426 --> 00:56:23,745
- Who's that?
- Well, that's not him.

406
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,209
That's Garth
And his brother.

407
00:56:41,718 --> 00:56:44,277
How are you feeling?

408
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:46,750
Okay.

409
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:57,166
Have we gone too far?

410
00:56:57,426 --> 00:57:00,385
Maybe we passed it in the night.

411
00:57:00,676 --> 00:57:03,315
I don't think so.

412
00:57:39,886 --> 00:57:42,285
Here!
Over here.

413
00:57:49,009 --> 00:57:51,008
Give me a hand.

414
00:57:59,595 --> 00:58:03,354
I wonder how many people lived
In a village like this?

415
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,678
- Come on. Let's find this gagen and get the powder.
- But there's only three of us.

416
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:17,969
We won't give him a choice. If we
can't reason with him, We'll fight him.

417
00:58:18,302 --> 00:58:22,901
We can't fight him, Savan.
We don't have to.

418
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:27,460
We'll convince him
we have something he needs.

419
00:59:35,928 --> 00:59:38,167
What's the problem?

420
00:59:40,095 --> 00:59:42,774
I saw you!

421
00:59:43,053 --> 00:59:45,212
Thief!

422
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:51,070
Please, Please, I won't do it again, I promise.
I promise I won't do it again. Please?

423
00:59:51,472 --> 00:59:54,231
You won't.

424
01:00:14,472 --> 01:00:17,671
- Who are you?
- It's all right. We're not with them.

425
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:22,133
We came down the river.

426
01:00:23,305 --> 01:00:28,704
- Then you've got the disease. Leave me alone.
- We came for the yellow powder.

427
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:32,600
We all came for the yellow powder.

428
01:00:32,888 --> 01:00:36,727
- How do we find it?
- You find it...

429
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:42,805
Do you know a man called gagen?

430
01:00:45,932 --> 01:00:50,211
Gagen...

431
01:00:52,596 --> 01:00:55,515
Savan, let him go!

432
01:00:56,846 --> 01:01:00,365
Stop! I only want to ask you a question!

433
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:17,989
Jaret's son, Kaleb...
He can read.

434
01:01:18,346 --> 01:01:21,385
His village was attacked by mutants.

435
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,279
There are survivors, trapped.

436
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:28,154
Kaleb and two others have gone
to get the yellow powder.

437
01:01:28,472 --> 01:01:31,671
- Against gagen?
- They need our help.

438
01:01:31,974 --> 01:01:37,773
- Gagen's forces are too strong for us.
- This boy, He could be the savior of mankind.

439
01:01:38,182 --> 01:01:40,741
- It's too risky.
- Is that not worth the risk?

440
01:01:41,015 --> 01:01:44,174
- We are all immune, and so are our tribes.
- Not your children's children,

441
01:01:44,472 --> 01:01:48,751
And we have no powder
to give them. What about their future?

442
01:01:49,098 --> 01:01:53,217
Or the others,
way beyond our lands?

443
01:01:53,556 --> 01:01:59,515
With the yellow powder, We could come out of
hiding And join forces against the mutants.

444
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:03,130
This could be our last chance.

445
01:02:18,264 --> 01:02:20,383
Let go of me!

446
01:02:26,266 --> 01:02:28,625
Bring them.

447
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:54,269
Sir... We do not recognize them,
So we think they might be infected.

448
01:03:59,557 --> 01:04:03,956
- We've come here for the yellow powder
- I know why you're here.

449
01:04:12,976 --> 01:04:17,575
- You're wasting your time, giselle.
- She's still a human being.

450
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:20,573
Not for much longer.

451
01:04:41,976 --> 01:04:45,695
My daughter is a compassionate soul.
I'm afraid she doesn't get it from me.

452
01:04:46,018 --> 01:04:49,177
I can't help you. Get them off my island
before they turn.

453
01:04:49,477 --> 01:04:53,076
I've come to help you, Gagen.

454
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,745
I didn't know I needed help.

455
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:04,098
When you took the yellow powder,You
must've known it wouldn't last forever.

456
01:05:04,435 --> 01:05:08,194
- That powder was a gift. It was given to me.
- A gift from a dying man.

457
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:11,318
That man was my father.

458
01:05:11,602 --> 01:05:16,081
- Your father was Jaret?
- The one who discovered the yellow powder.

459
01:05:20,934 --> 01:05:25,413
His dying wish was that it benefits
everyone, Not be hoarded by one man.

460
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:30,326
- Is that true?
- No.

461
01:05:30,685 --> 01:05:35,284
My father could read.
So can i.

462
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:38,123
I don't believe you.

463
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:53,659
"for Abraham Lincoln,
"there was no satisfaction

464
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:57,259
"over his victory,

465
01:05:57,561 --> 01:06:02,240
"for he had inherited a country

466
01:06:02,603 --> 01:06:06,402
That was tearing itself apart."

467
01:06:09,104 --> 01:06:14,023
I've come to carry on my father's
work. I can make the yellow powder.

468
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:20,032
Give us some of yours so that I will live, Let us take some
to our village, Then I will make you As much as you need.

469
01:06:20,436 --> 01:06:24,915
- If I fail you, you can kill me.
- You're dying already. You'll say anything.

470
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:28,469
First, prove what you say,
and I'll give you the powder.

471
01:06:32,854 --> 01:06:36,053
- We don't have enough time.
- Well, then, you'd better be quick.

472
01:06:36,354 --> 01:06:39,713
What yellow powder remains
Is for my children's children.

473
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:44,418
Outsiders can stay on the island.
We'll protect them from the mutants,

474
01:06:44,769 --> 01:06:47,288
- But they must work.
- We've seen them work.

475
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:52,440
Unless, of course, they're infected,
And then I offer them A quick death,

476
01:06:52,812 --> 01:06:57,651
A courtesy i'll extend to you and
your friend When the time comes.

477
01:07:06,353 --> 01:07:11,512
If it wasn't for his father,We'd all be
dead. Let them have some of the powder...

478
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:16,813
Giselle, enough. Take him into the library,
And you know what to do with her.

479
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:29,402
Was he telling the truth?
Did you steal the yellow powder?

480
01:07:29,729 --> 01:07:34,128
It wasn't his father
who kept us alive. It was me.

481
01:07:34,477 --> 01:07:36,716
There just wasn't enough.

482
01:07:36,979 --> 01:07:39,098
Did you steal it?

483
01:07:39,353 --> 01:07:42,312
You think i'm a tyrant?

484
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:46,856
I kept us safe.

485
01:07:48,313 --> 01:07:51,592
One day, you will have children...

486
01:07:51,897 --> 01:07:54,896
And you will understand.

487
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:09,471
I know you want to help us.
I'm not going to hurt you. All right?

488
01:08:12,187 --> 01:08:14,586
Show me where the powder is.

489
01:08:14,855 --> 01:08:19,094
- I can't betray my father.
- How many has he betrayed?

490
01:08:20,605 --> 01:08:25,524
- Your friend said he could make more.
- Maybe, eventually, but he's just stalling.

491
01:08:25,895 --> 01:08:30,214
- I'm sorry. I can't...
- Then you're killing us,

492
01:08:30,396 --> 01:08:34,075
And all that's left of my tribe.
Is that what you want?

493
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:52,288
I've spent my entire life
Clinging to a small patch of rock,

494
01:08:52,605 --> 01:08:55,484
Thinking we were
the only ones left,

495
01:08:55,772 --> 01:08:59,651
But there may be thousands
of survivors out there.

496
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:03,259
And they deserve the chance
You've been given.

497
01:09:06,314 --> 01:09:11,113
I'll take you to where the powder is
kept, But it won't do you any good.

498
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:38,805
Where do I start?

499
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:48,439
It's in there, but we need the key,
Which is around my father's neck. Always.

500
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,039
- When is the last time he got some powder?
- Um... Yesterday.

501
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,637
Then this isn't where he keeps it.

502
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:08,138
This door hasn't been
opened in a long time.

503
01:10:09,524 --> 01:10:15,843
It doesn't make sense. Whenever he comes
out of here, He always has the powder.

504
01:10:56,774 --> 01:11:00,173
This is all my father's work.

505
01:11:06,605 --> 01:11:09,444
You really don't know
what you're doing.

506
01:11:10,606 --> 01:11:14,445
I can do this, just not quickly.

507
01:11:16,442 --> 01:11:19,201
It could take weeks.

508
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:23,802
If Gagen gives us enough powder for our tribe,
I'll come back and make him as much as he needs.

509
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:27,269
Only to find out
this has all be a ruse.

510
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:30,826
You're out of time.

511
01:11:44,317 --> 01:11:47,636
Somebody, End this!
Please...

512
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:51,941
- Remi, do something!
- He's an elder. I can't.

513
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:00,593
Miru!

514
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:30,979
When it's time, I hope
you do the same for me.

515
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:42,408
As I thought.

516
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:50,646
Give me the powder.

517
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:54,498
Where do I draw the line?

518
01:12:56,442 --> 01:13:00,121
You know how many people Have
asked me for the same thing?

519
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:03,601
You know I can do this.

520
01:13:07,026 --> 01:13:10,585
Or is that what you're afraid of?

521
01:13:11,486 --> 01:13:15,525
To lose your hold
on all these people?

522
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,824
Father!

523
01:13:19,817 --> 01:13:22,856
There's someone in the safe
room, Searching for the powder.

524
01:13:54,234 --> 01:13:56,993
Don't kill him! No!

525
01:14:01,362 --> 01:14:04,201
When I tell you,
take a deep breath.

526
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:06,486
Are you ready?

527
01:14:08,154 --> 01:14:12,033
- Give it a few minutes.
- Dorel doesn't have a few minutes.

528
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,159
Take me to her.

529
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:18,219
Open the door!

530
01:14:18,485 --> 01:14:22,964
- I wouldn't go in there. She's starting to turn.
- She needs more water.

531
01:14:29,152 --> 01:14:31,471
Hey! What are you doing?

532
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:40,648
Breathe. Dorel... Breathe!

533
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,119
Okay... Okay, come on.
Let's go, babe.

534
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:02,161
- You should come with us.
- I don't want to leave the island.

535
01:15:02,443 --> 01:15:05,882
- And your father? He'll forgive you for helping us?
- It's you he'll be after.

536
01:15:06,194 --> 01:15:08,833
This is the future
of my people, too.

537
01:15:09,112 --> 01:15:13,791
Tell Kaleb to keep his promise
and continue his father's work.

538
01:15:45,571 --> 01:15:50,250
He has to breathe it in.
Get it in front of his face!

539
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:55,669
He's not breathing.
Watch out.

540
01:16:01,946 --> 01:16:05,145
Kaleb?
Kaleb, can you hear me? Kaleb?

541
01:16:05,445 --> 01:16:10,004
Kaleb, we have the powder, But
we have to leave now. Come on.

542
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:19,226
Hey!
Stop! Stop them!

543
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:21,687
This way.

544
01:16:21,947 --> 01:16:23,986
They're getting away!

545
01:16:24,236 --> 01:16:25,795
Move it!

546
01:16:26,028 --> 01:16:30,467
Kill them!

547
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:33,619
- I'll draw them away.
- No, Savan!

548
01:16:33,904 --> 01:16:36,943
Don't worry, i'll catch up.

549
01:16:37,238 --> 01:16:38,757
After them!

550
01:17:33,824 --> 01:17:42,783
Let's go!
Go! Go!

551
01:17:44,197 --> 01:17:48,396
- Did you lose them?
- They'll want their powder back.

552
01:18:05,156 --> 01:18:09,235
- We can't go back upriver. We'll be fighting the current.
- We'll have to go inland.

553
01:18:09,571 --> 01:18:13,770
- How will we find our way back?
- We have Kaleb.

554
01:18:15,656 --> 01:18:18,135
He's a good tracker.

555
01:19:10,323 --> 01:19:15,242
They've gone overland. They're still alive.
They must have the powder.

556
01:19:18,117 --> 01:19:20,356
Over there.

557
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:07,789
Keep going.

558
01:20:16,827 --> 01:20:19,186
Gagen. Go!

559
01:20:38,117 --> 01:20:40,636
- Kaleb...
- Can you run?

560
01:20:46,493 --> 01:20:51,852
Start picking the beasts off from the tree line.
It's not much, but it might give you a chance.

561
01:20:52,241 --> 01:20:55,720
- What are you doing?
- Kaleb must survive.

562
01:20:56,033 --> 01:20:59,392
- I'm not leaving without you.
- No... I'm the chief. Do as I say.

563
01:21:03,451 --> 01:21:04,850
Savan. Savan!

564
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:09,214
Run, Dorel!

565
01:21:11,451 --> 01:21:13,370
Go back! Go back!

566
01:21:24,117 --> 01:21:26,076
No! Savan!

567
01:22:18,452 --> 01:22:20,651
We can't stop now.

568
01:22:40,493 --> 01:22:43,052
- Come on.
- Have you got the powder?

569
01:22:43,326 --> 01:22:45,045
Yeah.

570
01:22:47,077 --> 01:22:50,436
Then let's get it to your people.

571
01:23:13,077 --> 01:23:15,756
Remi, please!
Please, you have to help me.

572
01:23:16,037 --> 01:23:19,956
You have to, please!
Please end this now! Please!

573
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:23,485
- No, I can't!
- End it, Remi, Please!

574
01:23:23,788 --> 01:23:26,267
I can't take it, please...

575
01:24:22,411 --> 01:24:24,410
Let me in!

576
01:24:27,036 --> 01:24:29,435
It's dorel!

577
01:24:31,245 --> 01:24:33,724
Give them the powder.

578
01:24:36,121 --> 01:24:37,440
No!

579
01:24:37,664 --> 01:24:41,383
Please, I need you to do it!
I can't stand it, please!

580
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:43,225
Help me!

581
01:24:43,456 --> 01:24:45,615
I've got the cure.
Do it!

582
01:24:48,704 --> 01:24:49,943
Miru!

583
01:25:04,871 --> 01:25:07,510
Lift her. Sit her up.

584
01:25:08,789 --> 01:25:11,148
Okay, Miru, listen to me.

585
01:25:12,748 --> 01:25:15,107
Take-take a deep breath.

586
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:29,072
Dorel.

587
01:25:58,248 --> 01:26:00,927
- Miru?
- She's alive.

588
01:26:06,207 --> 01:26:09,246
I want my powder!

589
01:26:10,414 --> 01:26:12,773
It's not yours.

590
01:26:13,038 --> 01:26:15,797
It never was.

591
01:26:16,081 --> 01:26:18,360
It was for my people.

592
01:27:02,497 --> 01:27:05,056
Ready?
Close your mouth.

593
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,999
Good.
Okay, you can lie back.

594
01:27:12,998 --> 01:27:15,437
You're back!

595
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:21,871
I promised, didn't I?

596
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:24,966
Let's get you out of here.

597
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:52,139
- He should be returned now.
- I do not think he'll be back.

598
01:27:52,542 --> 01:27:57,781
- We must gather our people.
- No, no need to take revenge.

599
01:27:58,165 --> 01:28:03,164
- Would your father have wanted it?
- The powder was a weapon for him.

600
01:28:04,499 --> 01:28:08,298
But in reality it is a cure.

601
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:28,771
- You sure about this?
- I'm sure about this.

602
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:33,524
To continue my father's work,
I have to go back.

603
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:43,354
- Take care.
- And you.

604
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:52,075
Bye.

605
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:59,600
"b"...
What's after "b"?

606
01:28:59,916 --> 01:29:01,875
"c".
Very good. And what's after?

607
01:29:02,127 --> 01:29:04,166
"d"...

608
01:29:06,209 --> 01:29:11,408
- See you. Take care of yourself, okay?
- Yeah. You, too, brother.

609
01:29:15,459 --> 01:29:20,018
- What's this one?
- "h, i,

610
01:29:20,376 --> 01:29:23,215
j, k..."

611
