1
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,733
Savan!

2
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:52,400
Uri has ordered us to turn back.
Savan!

3
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:55,667
Age has made him too cautious.

4
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,833
He's my father,
I can speak of him as I wish.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,300
- When you're chief, you'll want respect.
- It's not just a matter of respect.

6
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:08,467
Now, stay close And tonight, Yomak,
You will feast on the heart with me.

7
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:24,533
Are you deaf, Savan?

8
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:28,200
We do not separate, ever.

9
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,767
- You may not agree with my methods.
- We haven't had fresh meat in weeks.

10
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,200
Roots and berries
are not enough for us.

11
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:40,700
- You've got a lot to learn, Savan.
- I've proved myself the best hunter in this tribe

12
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:45,000
Hunting is not just about courage.
You've got to be clever, too.

13
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:48,900
- We are not the only predators out here.
- We are tired of being hungry.

14
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:53,967
Let me lead this hunt, and we will make our kill,
And tonight the village will have reason to celebrate,

15
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:57,733
And the women will show their gratitude.

16
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:02,000
Very well, Savan, lead.

17
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:07,667
Follow me.
Watch for my signal.

18
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,433
Kaleb?

19
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,067
What's it to be then,
Roast Kaleb or boiled Kaleb?

20
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:27,267
- You belong with the women, Not with the hunt.
- It's ahead. I've tracked it.

21
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,867
- Tracked what, the deadly blueberry?
- Enough!

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,400
- That's beyond our hunting grounds. You know that.
- It's out there, Right in front of us, Only 200 paces.

23
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:40,100
This is as far as we go.
We already pushed our luck.

24
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:43,267
It's too dangerous.
Maybe if we're quick...

25
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:51,867
200 paces, that's it.

26
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,800
- I tracked it!
- Tracking's one thing, Bringing it down is another.

27
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:16,267
Stay back, or you'll only get hurt.

28
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:01,100
- Evan, go cut the heart out!
- Yeah, cut it out!

29
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:15,400
The honor of today's hunt is Savan's
And Kaleb's.

30
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,900
You will share the heart tonight.

31
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,900
- It was my kill.
- Your blow brought it down,

32
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,833
But it was Kaleb's skills
that led us here. Is that not so?

33
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,933
Savan!

34
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,633
- Yomak?
- Help me.

35
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,500
No! Stay back, all of you!

36
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:38,433
He's been bitten!

37
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,033
Savan!

38
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,767
Kill me, Savan. Don't let it take me.
Please.

39
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,167
Savan...
Please!

40
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,367
Please...

41
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,500
Savan!

42
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,333
No!

43
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,067
No!
I'll kill you!

44
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:18,367
- I'll kill all of you!
- Don't do this! We can't stay here!

45
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:21,633
- I won't run!
- Do you want to kill us, too? We can't beat them!

46
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,300
They killed him!

47
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,900
Savan!

48
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:56,600
- Dorel.
- Finally. Tonight we feast.

49
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,733
We lost Yomak today.

50
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,333
He was bitten.

51
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,767
Kaleb!

52
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,767
- You don't stand a chance.
- What?

53
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:15,267
Oh, come on. You can't keep
secrets from your sister.

54
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,767
We know you like Dorel.

55
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, you never know.
Maybe Dorel doesn't want to marry

56
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:36,467
A tall, handsome
Future chief.

57
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,033
Yomak's dead.

58
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,100
It was my fault.

59
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,300
What happened?

60
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:06,233
I led them beyond
our hunting grounds.

61
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,400
He was attacked by beasts.

62
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:15,800
The beasts are here.
It's only a matter of time befores.

63
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:19,933
- We must leave grey rock.
- You saw them with your own eyes?

64
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:23,500
Yomak was bitten.
That's all I needed to see.

65
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:27,100
Uri...
We've been safe here all this time.

66
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:30,600
Did you go beyond
our hunting grounds?

67
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:34,000
The tribe needed meat.
There was none here.

68
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:38,933
- Then we have no choice. We have to leave.
- And go where? There is nowhere else.

69
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:43,433
We are the last survivors of man.
God chose us and led us to grey rock

70
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,133
And kept us safe here for generations.
Are we to doubt him now?

71
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,633
We should not run,
or wait for them to come.

72
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,433
- We should fight.
- There are too many to fight,

73
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,867
And you know the consequences if we do,
Or have you forgotten about Yomak Already?

74
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:01,200
- Then we should continue to live like cowards
- Careful what you say, Savan.

75
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:08,267
If it's god's will. That they must find
us here, Then we must accept our fate.

76
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:12,600
The beasts are a judgment against us,
A punishment for the sins of our fathers.

77
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,633
- Was it god's will that my friend should die?
- Why can't we choose our own fate?

78
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,500
Hold your tongue.
You've got no business here, Kaleb.

79
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:23,200
- My father spoke of other tribes-
- Your father didn't listen to the elders

80
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:27,000
And suffered the same fate as any man
Who goes beyond our hunting grounds.

81
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:30,400
He went to look for a better life.
For us all.

82
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,333
- What kind of a man abandons his children?
- He sought the truth.

83
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:38,667
- Our laws are the only truth.
- He's right, Kaleb.

84
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:43,633
- There's nothing out there but disease and death.
- As you have seen today.

85
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,033
The elders will discuss this. Savan, for your
disrespect, You will take guard duty tonight,

86
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:54,933
And the two of you will forfeit
the heart of the sloth To the elders.

87
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:15,167
- Why do you get yourself into trouble On father's account?
- Should I not question them?

88
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:19,233
Kaleb, it is the elders who have kept us safe,
Not our father.

89
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,200
They don't like to be questioned.

90
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:28,400
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.
He's not coming back.

91
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:32,400
- He always came back before-
- Yeah, well, not this time.

92
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:37,633
- It's been almost three years, Kaleb.
- I've had enough of living in hiding, Miru.

93
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,600
I want to know what's out there.

94
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,567
Don't leave me, Kaleb.
You're the only family I have.

95
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:52,433
- Then come with me.
- Kaleb, listen to the elders. There is no one else out there.

96
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,900
That's what they believe. What
about all the things he brought back?

97
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,433
Things from the old world. Those people died
many years ago. It doesn't prove anything.

98
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,167
He told me he had met others,
talked to others.

99
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,133
Yeah?
Well, where are they?

100
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,400
Why haven't they come?
Why hasn't he come?

101
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:17,067
Well, I will come back, Miru.

102
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,800
I promise.

103
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,067
Beasts!

104
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,667
Protect the cave!

105
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:08,333
Go to the cave!
Go to the bat cave!

106
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,533
No...

107
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,367
No!

108
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,400
There's too many!

109
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:26,567
Savan, what do we do?
Savan!

110
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:36,267
- Savan!
- Use the trees! Circle the beasts!

111
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,400
Go! Close the cave!

112
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,100
- Into the cave!
- Kaleb!

113
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:44,167
- Miru!
- Kaleb!

114
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,933
- Everybody in the cave!
- Get into the cave, Miru!

115
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,667
Miru! Get into the cave!

116
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,767
Everybody, get in here now!

117
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:57,300
Quickly!
That's it!

118
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,067
Okay!

119
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,033
Close it!

120
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:13,100
If you don't do it, we all die!

121
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,967
- Do it now!
- But others are still out there!

122
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,433
Do it!

123
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:20,033
Are you okay?

124
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:42,033
- How many?
- Too many.

125
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:48,633
We have to distract them,
Get them away from the cave.

126
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,567
- Then what?
- You have a better idea?

127
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,833
- Go for help.
- From where? You're ranting just like your father.

128
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,300
- There may be people who can help us.
- The elders never spoke of anyone else.

129
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:03,467
The elders are trapped in the cave!

130
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:08,667
Those beasts will not give up
until they are all dead.

131
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,233
We are the only chance
to survive.

132
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,033
- We should go to the mountains, look for other tribes.
- There are beasts in the mountains...

133
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:18,667
There are beasts right here.

134
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:26,567
- Shouldn't we at least try?
- I'm not going to run away.

135
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,367
What if Kaleb's right?
What if there are others?

136
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:34,200
If he is right, Then everything
we have ever been told Is a lie.

137
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:39,067
Do you really take his word Over the elders,
And the generation of elders before them?

138
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:44,233
But if we stay here and fight the beasts
alone, We will die, And so will our tribe.

139
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,733
And so will you.
Come on.

140
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,667
One day. You've got one day to find some other
people, Then Dorel and I are turning back.

141
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,900
Kaleb, what is this?

142
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:34,133
It's a book.

143
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,867
What do you do with it?

144
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:44,200
It's from the past. People used to put
their thoughts and ideas In books like this.

145
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:49,500
After the disease came, Everyone was
too busy trying to survive. Books died.

146
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:54,800
- Where did you get this book?
- My father brought it back.

147
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:58,667
- He taught me to read.
- Read?

148
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:03,500
To know what the pages are saying.

149
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:14,167
"monday morning
Tom sawyer felt miserable... "

150
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
Your father has corrupted you.

151
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:22,800
We don't have time for this.

152
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,967
Which is why we kept it a secret.

153
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,333
Go.
Go!

154
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:50,067
Kill it!

155
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,767
Kill it!

156
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:59,967
- It's my father!
- Your father's gone! That's not him!

157
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,033
It's all right.

158
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,933
This wasn't your father anymore.

159
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:35,367
Kaleb was right.

160
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:38,700
How...
How do you know my name?

161
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:41,467
I've been watching you
for a long time.

162
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,833
You can read.

163
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,033
Like your father.

164
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,200
- You know my father?
- I knew him.

165
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
What happened?

166
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:05,133
It was his wish That I made sure
no harm came to you.

167
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
- Were you bitten?
- What?

168
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:10,333
- Did it bite you?
- No.

169
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,667
- No bleeding through the nose?
- What do you mean? No...

170
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:16,733
- We're not infected if that's what you're asking.
- Oh, yes, you are.

171
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,867
A mutant has only to breathe on you
To infect you.

172
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:24,133
The bite is just quicker.
There is still time,

173
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:27,467
But there will be more of them,
So follow me.

174
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,767
You're lying.

175
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:32,267
There's nothing wrong with us.

176
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,100
Your mouth will go dry,
And your thirst will be unquenchable.

177
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:42,233
Your lungs will tighten, Your nose will bleed
and your eyes will sting,

178
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,367
Then your heart will race. Now, follow me.

179
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,233
- If we're infected, Why did you get so close?
- I'm immune.

180
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,733
- What's "immune?"
- I can't catch the disease.

181
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,633
How is that possible?

182
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:06,433
The cure is a powder,
A yellow powder.

183
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:12,233
There wasn't much of it, And what
little is left will be hard to get.

184
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,467
We have water,
but there's no food.

185
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,500
- Don't worry, they can't get in.
- Yeah, but won't they leave?

186
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:48,100
They know we're here. They won't stop.
They want to kill like rabid dogs.

187
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:52,400
Then we must pray,
Put ourselves in god's hands.

188
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:56,300
We must have faith.

189
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:59,900
Gather round
And let us pray.

190
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:08,100
Oh, lord, be with us,
Protect us from this evil...

191
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,100
Are you taking us
to the yellow powder?

192
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,500
We must first go to my home.

193
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,600
There are things
we need to pick up.

194
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:28,800
How come the beasts
never found you out here?

195
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:33,667
They're frightened of water.
Helps keep them at bay.

196
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,033
Don't worry.
They'll never cross this water.

197
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,467
Did you build this?

198
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,100
It's from the old world.

199
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:27,100
I just patched it up.

200
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,167
Neenah.

201
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,867
We have visitors.

202
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,667
Why?

203
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:42,233
He is jaret's son.

204
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,567
He doesn't belong here.

205
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:49,700
They need our help. Their village
was attacked by mutants.

206
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:53,067
You brought infected
people here, To our home?

207
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:59,700
They weren't bitten. They
still have some time. Neenah!

208
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:04,900
- He can read.
- I don't care! How can you be so reckless?

209
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:08,967
- Don't you see what this means?
- It means you've put us in danger.

210
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:14,067
Look at him. He's a boy.
How can he do what jaret did?

211
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:16,967
It's worth the risk.

212
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:25,733
This is our son, Persk.

213
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:28,667
It's been a while
since he's seen others.

214
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,433
- Hi. I'm Dorel...
- Persk...

215
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,633
The beasts have gone.

216
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,400
I wouldn't be so sure.

217
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,733
It's so quiet.

218
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,967
Open it.

219
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:06,133
No... Don't touch the door.

220
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,933
There might be other survivors from
our tribe out there Who need our help.

221
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,300
No one else survived, And neither
will we if we open this door.

222
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:17,333
No... Kaleb is not dead.

223
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm sorry, Miru.

224
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,867
He isn't dead!

225
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:40,300
Neenah...

226
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:46,200
- Neenah, don't be angry.
- I'm scared, amal.

227
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,667
I know what you're going to do.
For what?

228
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:53,533
If Kaleb can do what his father did,
Think what that would mean.

229
00:30:55,367 --> 00:31:01,667
But for you to go back there You were
so lucky to get out the last time.

230
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,067
Then think of persk.

231
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:07,900
Why should he have to grow up in a
world Where people live in hiding?

232
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,833
It's been good enough for us.

233
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:19,167
We're happy here, aren't we?

234
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:23,233
But what about his children,
And the others who are out there?

235
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:29,167
They'll never be safe Unless we can learn
to make the powder.

236
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:35,867
Are we going to look persk in the eye And tell
him we never took the one chance That came our way?

237
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,400
What did your elders teach
you about the disease?

238
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:44,733
That god created it
As punishment for man's sins.

239
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,567
The old world was full of greed, And men
created machines that got out of control,

240
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,233
And they meddled with nature,
And only god could stop them.

241
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:58,900
Men were trying to perfect
their own design.

242
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:02,467
They found a way to bring
extinct animals back to life

243
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:05,567
Like the mammoth
and sloth that you hunt,

244
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:09,900
But their science
also brought us the disease.

245
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:12,933
It wasn't long before
the whole world was infected.

246
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,800
The disease ate into the human brain,
Turning men into mutants.

247
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:23,133
- How do you know all of this?
- Because I met Kaleb's father.

248
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:28,767
Jaret had the courage
To look for the old knowledge.

249
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,300
He found out what really happened.

250
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,133
It was your father, Kaleb,
Who discovered the cure.

251
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,833
The yellow powder?

252
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:47,600
It took him many years To find the right mixture
of plants and fungus.

253
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:51,000
Once you inhale the powder,
You're protected.

254
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:54,833
What if you already have...
The disease?

255
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,467
Once you have turned,
then the powder is useless...

256
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:02,800
But if you get it in time,
then there is still hope.

257
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,833
- So why didn't my father bring the powder home?
- He was doing just that when he died...

258
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:10,700
And the secret of the powder
died with him.

259
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:14,033
But you kept the powder.
So you're safe, while we...

260
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,567
No. The powder was stolen,
And it will be hard to get it back.

261
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,567
But you'll help us try?

262
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,533
Yes. If we can keep Kaleb alive,

263
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,167
He will be able to carry on
his father's work.

264
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,067
They're all from the old world.

265
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:52,933
My father would often disappear
for months at a time.

266
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:58,867
He told me that out there Were answers
to all our questions.

267
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:03,600
I now understand his fascination.

268
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:08,267
Your father had this on him
When he died.

269
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,233
He said there'd be
more adventures.

270
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:26,667
I've only read one book. How will I ever
unlock the secret of the yellow powder?

271
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,467
You're the only one
who can read, Kaleb.

272
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:35,567
But if we find The powder that exists.
We only need enough for our people.

273
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:40,900
Your father risked everything Teaching you
to read And leaving the safety of his tribe.

274
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:44,867
Now...
I'm risking everything.

275
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:51,433
Saving just a few people
Is not an option.

276
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:04,700
Maybe our prayers
been answered Yisir.

277
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,267
- What are we waiting for?
- That is not god's way!

278
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:18,467
- Well, shouldn't we at least try?
- We will not scurry Into the bowels of the earth like animals As our forefathers did.

279
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:22,933
- They were punished for their sins!
- Would god punish us for trying to survive?

280
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,833
We must have faith And courage,
And wait for this evil to pass.

281
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,900
If i'd have had enough courage,
I would have listened to Kaleb.

282
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:41,267
let me help

283
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,433
We should wake them.
Give them one last chance.

284
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,467
They made their choice.

285
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:38,200
It's time to go.

286
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:13,733
Uh, w-we're ready to leave.

287
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:20,133
Washing my hair's a simple thing,
But it makes me feel better.

288
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,933
Amal expects me
to perform miracles.

289
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:31,433
- Well, you were the one Who sought the knowledge of the old world.
- Yeah, and the truth,

290
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,467
- And Savan still isn't convinced.
- Do not judge him.

291
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:41,333
All these things we never knew Have shattered everything
that we believe in. He finds it hard to accept.

292
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:51,467
Savan will becomes a great chief.

293
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:55,833
He is brave
and ready for the challenge.

294
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,033
Still not convinced, I am?

295
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,967
We shall know soon enough.

296
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:17,967
Okay, persk,
take care of your mom.

297
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:47,167
How deep do you think it is?

298
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:51,233
The ceiling's gone. It could've blocked
the whole tunnel.

299
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,700
- No, it can't have. I can still feel a breeze.
- Well, you only need a small gap for that.

300
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
What are you doing?

301
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:05,033
If it's a small gap, You need a small person
to fit through it.

302
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:13,233
Miru!

303
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:28,167
- That will stay on top of the water?
- It will,

304
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,133
And as long as you stay on,
you'll be safe.

305
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:44,633
Jump.

306
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:48,167
Come on.
It's okay.

307
00:40:56,267 --> 00:41:00,333
- I'm walking on water.
- Yes, it floats.

308
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:07,267
This river will lead us
to the yellow powder.

309
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:10,667
That's a paddle.
Use both hands.

310
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,533
Here, let me show you.

311
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,133
That's it. Good.

312
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,300
I think she's okay.

313
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:50,000
It's okay!
There's a way through!

314
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:52,167
Give me your hand!

315
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,567
- Miru!
- There's something in the water!

316
00:41:57,067 --> 00:42:00,300
- There's something in the water!
- What is it?

317
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,533
- Get them off me! Get them off!
- It's okay.

318
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,467
- Get them off...
- Miru, it's okay. I'm getting them off.

319
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,867
It's all right,
It's all right...

320
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,433
It's all right.
I think they're all gone.

321
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,900
- Do we look for another way?
- No.

322
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:26,567
We've come too far.

323
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,500
Right. When I go through,
Just get them off me fast, okay?

324
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:23,633
- Paddle!
- Get in the middle!

325
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,333
The middle!
Row to the middle!

326
00:43:49,533 --> 00:43:52,500
I fear they will never leave.

327
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,100
Let's hope the others
aren't punished For their doubts.

328
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:28,033
There was a group of us,

329
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,300
A brotherhood, That was formed to help protect
each tribe from the mutants.

330
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:39,867
After jaret discovered
the powder,

331
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:46,367
We thought if we could immunize enough tribes, People
could come out of hiding, Start to rebuild the world.

332
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:49,233
But we were betrayed.

333
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,733
By one of our own.

334
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:56,000
A man called gagen
stole the powder.

335
00:44:56,167 --> 00:45:00,433
But won't he help us
if he sees that we're sick?

336
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:05,767
You don't know this man.
He turned an island into a fortress,

337
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,033
His empire.

338
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:13,000
Gagen has hordes of followers

339
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:16,533
Who will kill for the chance
to inhale the yellow powder,

340
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,533
And kill they do.

341
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,900
- You okay?
- Those leech bites really sting.

342
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:29,400
Yeah, well, not
as much as a beast bite.

343
00:45:29,567 --> 00:45:32,233
If you put it that way,
I'm beginning to enjoy it.

344
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,667
Over here!

345
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:39,367
Looks like we got
our miracle after all.

346
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:42,567
Half a miracle.

347
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:46,567
- We've still got to climb it.
- I'll go first.

348
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,700
- Were you bitten?
- No.

349
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:57,267
- Did they claw you?
- We were fighting. I don't know!

350
00:45:57,433 --> 00:46:00,800
- Maybe being close is all it takes.
- We don't know that.

351
00:46:00,933 --> 00:46:05,833
- Yeah, but if it is, then we're all infected.
- Then we're all going to turn.

352
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:10,100
Okay, we'd better get going.

353
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,567
Right.
Let's finish what we started!

354
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:36,400
You know that Kaleb must find his father's
work. Above all else. Do you understand?

355
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:51,667
- Kaleb. I never thanked you.
- For what?

356
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,667
For saving my life
back at the village, After the attack.

357
00:46:56,967 --> 00:47:00,133
I haven't saved anyone yet.

358
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,100
Well, you saved me,
so thank you.

359
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,533
Oh, no. No...

360
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:35,300
Get down quickly!

361
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:51,367
Go on!
Leave me!

362
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Leave me!

363
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:56,533
I'll carry you!

364
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:01,033
You two can still get out of here.
I'm dead either way!

365
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,200
Move!

366
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:07,733
Go!

367
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:10,733
No

368
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:35,733
- When the old world died, how many survived?
- It's impossible to say.

369
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,600
Each of the brotherhood
came from a tribe of 60 or 70.

370
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:43,400
- Are they all still out there?
- Scattered, staying hidden.

371
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:49,100
We set up these beacons as a warning
system. A beacon is lit, help will come.

372
00:48:49,233 --> 00:48:51,767
That's the theory.

373
00:48:51,933 --> 00:48:55,133
Let's see who's up for the fight.

374
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,300
Run!

375
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:11,667
What did he say?

376
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:14,367
Run! Mutants!

377
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:20,200
Run!

378
00:50:28,767 --> 00:50:31,200
Run!
To the raft!

379
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:08,600
- We have to go back!
- No, he's finished!

380
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:11,100
We can't just leave him.

381
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:14,033
- We have to go!
- No! Come on!

382
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:17,633
- Where are you going? - Get to the
raft, dorel! - Without amal? - Come on!

383
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:48,400
- But what about the brotherhood?
- He lit the beacon! He said others would come!

384
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:52,967
He said they might come. Do you
want to wait along with the beasts?

385
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:56,067
The river is our only chance.

386
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:58,833
No.

387
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:03,833
The yellow powder's
our only chance.

388
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,433
If this is to be our time,
Let us leave this world together.

389
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:25,233
We tried.

390
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,333
I never understood
your father before.

391
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,600
He would be proud of you.

392
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,733
- Is it just us?
- Let's hope not.

393
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,700
Have you seen amal?

394
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:03,133
Well, this is his beacon.
He must be here.

395
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,733
- Who's that?
- Well, that's not him.

396
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,067
That's garth
And his brother.

397
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:27,433
How are you feeling?

398
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,767
Okay.

399
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,767
Have we gone too far?

400
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:42,933
Maybe we passed it in the night.

401
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,733
I don't think so.

402
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:23,133
Here!
Over here.

403
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:31,467
Give me a hand.

404
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:43,367
I wonder how many people lived
In a village like this?

405
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:53,333
- Come on. Let's find this gagen and get the powder.
- But there's only three of us.

406
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,467
We won't give him a choice. If we
can't reason with him, We'll fight him.

407
00:55:57,633 --> 00:56:02,200
We can't fight him, Savan.
We don't have to.

408
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:06,567
We'll convince him
we have something he needs.

409
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:14,333
What's the problem?

410
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,800
I saw you!

411
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:21,100
Thief!

412
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:26,833
Please, Please, I won't do it again, I promise.
I promise I won't do it again. Please?

413
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,800
You won't.

414
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:52,300
- Who are you?
- It's all right. We're not with them.

415
00:57:53,467 --> 00:57:56,600
We came down the river.

416
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:03,000
- Then you've got the disease. Leave me alone.
- We came for the yellow powder.

417
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,667
We all came for the yellow powder.

418
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:10,667
- How do we find it?
- You find it...

419
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:16,467
Do you know a man called gagen?

420
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:23,567
Gagen...

421
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,633
Savan, let him go!

422
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,333
Stop! I only want to ask you a question!

423
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:50,267
Jaret's son, Kaleb...
He can read.

424
00:58:50,433 --> 00:58:53,467
His village was attacked by mutants.

425
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:56,233
There are survivors, trapped.

426
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,000
Kaleb and two others have gone
to get the yellow powder.

427
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:03,367
- Against gagen?
- They need our help.

428
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:09,333
- Gagen's forces are too strong for us.
- This boy, He could be the savior of mankind.

429
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,067
- It's too risky.
- Is that not worth the risk?

430
00:59:12,233 --> 00:59:15,400
- We are all immune, and so are our tribes.
- Not your children's children,

431
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:19,767
And we have no powder
to give them. What about their future?

432
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:24,100
Or the others,
way beyond our lands?

433
00:59:24,267 --> 00:59:30,167
With the yellow powder, We could come out of
hiding And join forces against the mutants.

434
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,567
This could be our last chance.

435
00:59:47,933 --> 00:59:50,100
Let go of me!

436
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,000
Bring them.

437
01:01:14,467 --> 01:01:20,367
Sir... We do not recognize them,
So we think they might be infected.

438
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,567
- We've come here for the yellow powder
- I know why you're here.

439
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,667
- You're wasting your time, giselle.
- She's still a human being.

440
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:45,467
Not for much longer.

441
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,633
My daughter is a compassionate soul.
I'm afraid she doesn't get it from me.

442
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,967
I can't help you. Get them off my island
before they turn.

443
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:16,700
I've come to help you, gagen.

444
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:23,133
I didn't know I needed help.

445
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,300
When you took the yellow powder,You
must've known it wouldn't last forever.

446
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:31,233
- That powder was a gift. It was given to me.
- A gift from a dying man.

447
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,200
That man was my father.

448
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:38,867
- Your father was jaret?
- The one who discovered the yellow powder.

449
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:47,767
His dying wish was that it benefits
everyone, Not be hoarded by one man.

450
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:52,533
- Is that true?
- No.

451
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:57,267
My father could read.
So can i.

452
01:02:57,433 --> 01:02:59,933
I don't believe you.

453
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,967
"for abraham lincoln,
"there was no satisfaction

454
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:18,300
"over his victory,

455
01:03:18,467 --> 01:03:23,133
"for he had inherited a country

456
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:27,100
That was tearing itself apart. "

457
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:34,467
I've come to carry on my father's
work. I can make the yellow powder.

458
01:03:34,633 --> 01:03:40,300
Give us some of yours so that I will live, Let us take some
to our village, Then I will make you As much as you need.

459
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:44,933
- If I fail you, you can kill me.
- You're dying already. You'll say anything.

460
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,300
First, prove what you say,
and I'll give you the powder.

461
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:55,533
- We don't have enough time.
- Well, then, you'd better be quick.

462
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:59,133
What yellow powder remains
Is for my children's children.

463
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:03,633
Outsiders can stay on the island.
We'll protect them from the mutants,

464
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,333
- But they must work.
- We've seen them work.

465
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:11,367
Unless, of course, they're infected,
And then I offer them A quick death,

466
01:04:11,533 --> 01:04:16,367
A courtesy i'll extend to you and
your friend When the time comes.

467
01:04:24,533 --> 01:04:29,667
If it wasn't for his father,We'd all be
dead. Let them have some of the powder...

468
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:34,733
Giselle, enough. Take him into the library,
And you know what to do with her.

469
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,833
Was he telling the truth?
Did you steal the yellow powder?

470
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,367
It wasn't his father
who kept us alive. It was me.

471
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:53,767
There just wasn't enough.

472
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:56,033
Did you steal it?

473
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,167
You think i'm a tyrant?

474
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:03,533
I kept us safe.

475
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:08,067
One day, you will have children...

476
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:11,233
And you will understand.

477
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:25,300
I know you want to help us. I'm
not going to hurt you. All right?

478
01:05:27,733 --> 01:05:30,133
Show me where the powder is.

479
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:34,500
- I can't betray my father.
- How many has he betrayed?

480
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:40,733
- Your friend said he could make more.
- Maybe, eventually, but he's just stalling.

481
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:45,132
- I'm sorry. I can't...
- Then you're killing us,

482
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:48,833
And all that's left of my tribe.
Is that what you want?

483
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:06,367
I've spent my entire life
Clinging to a small patch of rock,

484
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,367
Thinking we were
the only ones left,

485
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:13,433
But there may be thousands
of survivors out there.

486
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,867
And they deserve the chance
You've been given.

487
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:24,500
I'll take you to where the powder is
kept, But it won't do you any good.

488
01:06:48,733 --> 01:06:50,967
Where do I start?

489
01:06:54,333 --> 01:07:00,367
It's in there, but we need the key,
Which is around my father's neck. Always.

490
01:07:08,767 --> 01:07:13,367
- When is the last time he got some powder?
- Um... Yesterday.

491
01:07:13,533 --> 01:07:15,767
Then this isn't where he keeps it.

492
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,133
This door hasn't been
opened in a long time.

493
01:07:20,367 --> 01:07:26,667
It doesn't make sense. Whenever he comes
out of here, He always has the powder.

494
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:09,133
This is all my father's work.

495
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:18,000
You really don't know
what you're doing.

496
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,833
I can do this, just not quickly.

497
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,333
It could take weeks.

498
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,833
If gagen gives us enough powder for our tribe,
I'll come back and make him as much as he needs.

499
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,133
Only to find out
this has all be a ruse.

500
01:08:35,767 --> 01:08:38,500
You're out of time.

501
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:54,700
Somebody, End this!
Please...

502
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:58,833
- Remi, do something!
- He's an elder. I can't.

503
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,033
Miru!

504
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:36,367
When it's time, I hope
you do the same for me.

505
01:09:44,467 --> 01:09:47,233
As I thought.

506
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,133
Give me the powder.

507
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,900
Where do I draw the line?

508
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,267
You know how many people Have
asked me for the same thing?

509
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,600
You know I can do this.

510
01:10:10,767 --> 01:10:14,333
Or is that what you're afraid of?

511
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:19,067
To lose your hold
on all these people?

512
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:22,167
Father!

513
01:10:23,033 --> 01:10:26,067
There's someone in the safe
room, Searching for the powder.

514
01:10:56,067 --> 01:10:58,867
Don't kill him! No!

515
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,767
When I tell you,
take a deep breath.

516
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,900
Are you ready?

517
01:11:09,433 --> 01:11:13,333
- Give it a few minutes.
- Dorel doesn't have a few minutes.

518
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,267
Take me to her.

519
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:19,233
Open the door!

520
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,833
- I wouldn't go in there. She's starting to turn.
- She needs more water.

521
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,933
Hey! What are you doing?

522
01:11:37,733 --> 01:11:40,767
Breathe. Dorel... Breathe!

523
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,633
Okay... Okay, come on.
Let's go, babe.

524
01:11:58,633 --> 01:12:01,433
- You should come with us.
- I don't want to leave the island.

525
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,000
- And your father? He'll forgive you for helping us?
- It's you he'll be after.

526
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:07,800
This is the future
of my people, too.

527
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:12,633
Tell Kaleb to keep his promise
and continue his father's work.

528
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:47,633
He has to breathe it in.
Get it in front of his face!

529
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:52,733
He's not breathing.
Watch out.

530
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,867
Kaleb?
Kaleb, can you hear me? Kaleb?

531
01:13:02,033 --> 01:13:06,567
Kaleb, we have the powder, But
we have to leave now. Come on.

532
01:13:13,067 --> 01:13:15,367
Hey!
Stop! Stop them!

533
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:17,733
This way.

534
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,900
They're getting away!

535
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:21,667
Move it!

536
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:26,233
Kill them!

537
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,200
- I'll draw them away.
- No, Savan!

538
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:32,400
Don't worry, i'll catch up.

539
01:13:32,567 --> 01:13:34,067
After them!

540
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:35,833
Let's go!
Go! Go!

541
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:41,033
- Did you lose them?
- They'll want their powder back.

542
01:14:56,967 --> 01:15:01,033
- We can't go back upriver. We'll be fighting the current.
- We'll have to go inland.

543
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:05,400
- How will we find our way back?
- We have Kaleb.

544
01:15:07,033 --> 01:15:09,500
He's a good tracker.

545
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:04,433
They've gone overland. They're still alive.
They must have the powder.

546
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,233
Over there.

547
01:16:52,933 --> 01:16:54,767
Keep going.

548
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:05,733
Gagen. Go!

549
01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:26,333
- Kaleb...
- Can you run?

550
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:37,200
Start picking the beasts off from the tree line.
It's not much, but it might give you a chance.

551
01:17:37,367 --> 01:17:40,867
- What are you doing?
- Kaleb must survive.

552
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:44,367
- I'm not leaving without you.
- No... I'm the chief. Do as I say.

553
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,533
Savan. Savan!

554
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:53,733
Run, dorel!

555
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,733
Go back! Go back!

556
01:18:07,967 --> 01:18:09,900
No! Savan!

557
01:19:00,133 --> 01:19:02,367
We can't stop now.

558
01:19:21,267 --> 01:19:23,867
- Come on.
- Have you got the powder?

559
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,733
Yeah.

560
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,933
Then let's get it to your people.

561
01:19:52,567 --> 01:19:55,233
Remi, please!
Please, you have to help me.

562
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,300
You have to, please!
Please end this now! Please!

563
01:19:59,467 --> 01:20:02,700
- No, I can't!
- End it, Remi, Please!

564
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:05,300
I can't take it, please...

565
01:20:59,133 --> 01:21:01,133
Let me in!

566
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,967
It's dorel!

567
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:10,067
Give them the powder.

568
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:13,567
No!

569
01:21:13,733 --> 01:21:17,500
Please, I need you to do it!
I can't stand it, please!

570
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:19,200
Help me!

571
01:21:19,367 --> 01:21:21,500
I've got the cure.
Do it!

572
01:21:24,367 --> 01:21:25,567
Miru!

573
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,533
Lift her. Sit her up.

574
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:46,033
Okay, Miru, listen to me.

575
01:21:47,433 --> 01:21:49,767
Take-take a deep breath.

576
01:22:01,067 --> 01:22:03,233
Dorel.

577
01:22:31,133 --> 01:22:33,800
- Miru?
- She's alive.

578
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:41,800
I want my powder!

579
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,167
It's not yours.

580
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:48,100
It never was.

581
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:50,500
It was for my people.

582
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,333
Ready?
Close your mouth.

583
01:23:38,133 --> 01:23:41,067
Good.
Okay, you can lie back.

584
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,300
You're back!

585
01:23:48,433 --> 01:23:51,533
I promised, didn't I?

586
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,467
Let's get you out of here.

587
01:24:15,067 --> 01:24:20,667
- He should be returned now.
- I do not think he'll be back.

588
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:26,100
- We must gather our people.
- No, no need to take revenge.

589
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:31,233
- Would your father have wanted it?
- The powder was a weapon for him.

590
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:36,100
But in reality it is a cure.

591
01:24:51,367 --> 01:24:55,800
- You sure about this?
- I'm sure about this.

592
01:24:55,967 --> 01:25:00,367
To continue my father's work,
I have to go back.

593
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,767
- Take care.
- And you.

594
01:25:15,933 --> 01:25:18,067
Bye.

595
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,333
"b"...
What's after "b"?

596
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,500
"c".
Very good. And what's after?

597
01:25:27,667 --> 01:25:29,700
"d"...

598
01:25:31,567 --> 01:25:36,733
- See you. Take care of yourself, okay?
- Yeah. You, too, brother.

599
01:25:40,433 --> 01:25:45,000
- What's this one?
- "h, i,

600
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:48,000
j, k... "

601
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:50,367
Kaleb!

602
01:25:51,367 --> 01:25:53,967
Bye, Persk.
