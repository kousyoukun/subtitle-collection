1
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,009
Savan.

2
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,609
Uri has ordered us to turn back.
Savan.

3
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,929
Age has made him too cautious.

4
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:59,089
He's my father,
I can speak of him as I wish.

5
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:03,569
When you're chief, you will want respect.
It's not just a matter of respect.

6
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:08,729
Now, stay close and tonight, Yomak,
you will feast on the heart with me.

7
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,769
Are you deaf, Savan?

8
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,449
We do not separate, ever.

9
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,009
You may not agree with my methods.
We haven't had fresh meat in weeks.

10
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,449
Roots and berries
are not enough for us.

11
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:40,969
You have got a lot to learn, Savan. I have
proved myself the best hunter in this tribe.

12
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:45,249
Hunting is not just about courage.
You have got to be clever, too.

13
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:49,129
We are not the only predators out here.
We are tired of being hungry.

14
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:51,609
Let me lead this hunt,
and we will make our kill....

15
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:54,209
...and tonight the village will have
reason to celebrate...

16
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,969
...and the women will show their gratitude.

17
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,289
Very well, Savan, lead.

18
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,929
Follow me. Watch for my signal.

19
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,689
Kaleb?

20
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,289
What's it to be then,
Roast Kaleb or boiled Kaleb?

21
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,529
You belong with the women, not with
the hunt. It's ahead. I have tracked it.

22
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:31,089
Tracked what, the deadly blueberry?
Enough.

23
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:36,649
That's beyond our hunting grounds. You know that.
It's out there, right in front of us, only 200 paces.

24
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,369
This is as far as we go. We already
pushed our luck. It's too dangerous.

25
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:43,529
Maybe if we're quick...

26
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,129
200 paces, that's it.

27
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,009
I tracked it. Tracking's one thing,
bringing it down is another.

28
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,489
Stay back, or you will only get hurt.

29
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,369
Evan, go cut the heart out.
Yeah, cut it out.

30
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,649
The honor of today's hunt is Savan's
and Kaleb's.

31
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,129
You will share the heart tonight.

32
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,129
It was my kill.
Your blow brought it down,

33
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,129
But it was Kaleb's skills
that led us here. Is that not so?

34
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,209
Savan.

35
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,889
Yomak?
Help me.

36
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,769
No. Stay back, all of you.

37
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,649
He's been bitten.

38
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:42,930
Savan.

39
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,009
Kill me, Savan. Don't let it take me.
Please.

40
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,449
Savan...
Please.

41
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,649
Please...

42
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,729
Savan.

43
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,360
No.

44
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,329
No.
I will kill you.

45
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,609
I will kill all of you.
Don't do this. We can't stay here.

46
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:21,849
I won't run. Do you want to kill us,
too? We can't beat them.

47
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,529
They killed him.

48
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,129
Savan.

49
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,849
Dorel.
Finally. Tonight we feast.

50
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,009
We lost Yomak today.

51
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,569
He was bitten.

52
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,770
Kaleb.

53
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,049
You don't stand a chance. What?

54
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,489
Oh, come on.
You can't keep secrets from your sister.

55
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,009
We know you like Dorel.

56
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,249
Well, you never know.
Maybe Dorel doesn't want to marry...

57
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:36,729
...a tall, handsome future chief.

58
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,289
Yomak's dead.

59
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,329
It was my fault.

60
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,529
What happened?

61
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:06,449
I led them beyond our hunting grounds.

62
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:09,689
He was attacked by beasts.

63
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,049
The beasts are here. It's only a matter
of time before they find us.

64
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:20,169
We must leave grey rock.
You saw them with your own eyes?

65
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,729
Yomak was bitten.
That's all I needed to see.

66
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:27,369
Uri...
We have been safe here all this time.

67
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:30,849
Did you go beyond our hunting grounds?

68
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:34,249
The tribe needed meat.
There was none here.

69
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:39,169
Then we have no choice. We have to leave.
And go where? There is nowhere else.

70
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:43,689
We are the last survivors of man.
God chose us and led us to grey rock....

71
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:47,369
...and kept us safe here for generations.
Are we to doubt him now?

72
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:50,889
We should not run,
or wait for them to come.

73
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,689
We should fight.
There are too many to fight...

74
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:58,129
...and you know the consequences if we do,
or have you forgotten about Yomak already?

75
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:01,489
Then we should continue to live like
cowards careful what you say, Savan.

76
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:08,529
If it's god's will. That they must find
us here, then we must accept our fate.

77
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:12,849
The beasts are a judgment against us,
a punishment for the sins of our fathers.

78
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:16,849
Was it god's will that my friend should
die? Why can't we choose our own fate?

79
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:19,729
Hold your tongue.
You have got no business here, Kaleb.

80
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:23,449
My father spoke of other tribes--
your father didn't listen to the elders...

81
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,249
...and suffered the same fate as any man
who goes beyond our hunting grounds.

82
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:30,609
He went to look for a better life.
For us all.

83
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:34,569
What kind of a man abandons his children?
He sought the truth.

84
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,929
Our laws are the only truth.
He's right, Kaleb.

85
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:43,889
There's nothing out there but disease
and death. As you have seen today.

86
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:50,329
The elders will discuss this. Savan, for your
disrespect, you will take guard duty tonight,

87
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:55,169
And the two of you will forfeit
the heart of the sloth to the elders.

88
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:15,409
Why do you get yourself into trouble on
father's account? Should I not question them?

89
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:19,489
Kaleb, it is the elders who have kept
us safe, not our father.

90
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,409
They don't like to be questioned.

91
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,689
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.
He's not coming back.

92
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:32,649
He always came back before--
yeah, well, not this time.

93
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:37,889
It's been almost three years, Kaleb.
I have had enough of living in hiding, Miru.

94
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,849
I want to know what's out there.

95
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,809
Don't leave me, Kaleb.
You're the only family I have.

96
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:52,689
Then come with me. Kaleb, listen to the
elders. There is no one else out there.

97
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:57,129
That's what they believe.
What about all the things he brought back?

98
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:00,689
Things from the old world. Those people died
many years ago. It doesn't prove anything.

99
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:04,409
He told me he had met others,
talked to others.

100
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,369
Yeah?
Well, where are they?

101
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:11,649
Why haven't they come?
Why hasn't he come?

102
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,289
Well, I will come back, Miru.

103
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,049
I promise.

104
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,329
Beasts.

105
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,929
Protect the cave.

106
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,609
Go to the cave.
Go to the bat cave.

107
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,809
No...

108
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,160
No.

109
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,649
There's too many.

110
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,809
Savan, what do we do?
Savan.

111
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,489
Savan.
Use the trees. Circle the beasts.

112
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,609
Go. Close the cave.

113
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,329
Into the cave.
Kaleb.

114
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,409
Miru.
Kaleb.

115
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:47,169
Everybody in the cave.
Get into the cave, Miru.

116
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:49,929
Miru. Get into the cave.

117
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:52,009
Everybody, get in here now.

118
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,569
Quickly.
That's it.

119
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:59,329
Okay.

120
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,289
Close it.

121
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,329
If you don't do it, we all die.

122
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,209
Do it now.
But others are still out there.

123
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,689
Do it.

124
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,249
Are you okay?

125
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,289
How many?
Too many.

126
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,889
We have to distract them,
get them away from the cave.

127
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,849
Then what?
You have a better idea?

128
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:56,089
Go for help. From where?
You're ranting just like your father.

129
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:00,569
There may be people who can help us.
The elders never spoke of anyone else.

130
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:03,729
The elders are trapped in the cave.

131
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,889
Those beasts will not give up
until they are all dead.

132
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:12,489
We are the only chance to survive.

133
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:16,329
We should go to the mountains, look for other
tribes. There are beasts in the mountains...

134
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:18,889
There are beasts right here.

135
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,809
Shouldn't we at least try?
I am not going to run away.

136
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,609
What if Kaleb's right?
What if there are others?

137
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:34,449
If he is right, then everything
we have ever been told is a lie.

138
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:39,329
Do you really take his word over the elders,
and the generation of elders before them?

139
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:44,489
But if we stay here and fight the beasts
alone, we will die, and so will our tribe.

140
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:48,009
And so will you.
Come on.

141
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,889
One day. You have got one day to find some other
people, then Dorel and I are turning back.

142
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,129
Kaleb, what is this?

143
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,369
It's a book.

144
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,089
What do you do with it?

145
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:44,449
It's from the past. People used to put
their thoughts and ideas in books like this.

146
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:49,769
After the disease came, everyone was
too busy trying to survive. Books died.

147
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:55,089
Where did you get this book?
My father brought it back.

148
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:58,969
He taught me to read.
Read?

149
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,729
To know what the pages are saying.

150
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:14,409
"monday morning
Tom sawyer felt miserable..."

151
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,489
Your father has corrupted you.

152
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,049
We don't have time for this.

153
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:26,169
Which is why we kept it a secret.

154
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,290
Go.
Go.

155
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,289
Kill it.

156
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,009
Kill it.

157
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:00,249
It's my father.
Your father's gone. That's not him.

158
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,289
It's all right.

159
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,169
This wasn't your father anymore.

160
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,649
Kaleb was right.

161
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:38,969
How...
How do you know my name?

162
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:41,689
I have been watching you
for a long time.

163
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,089
You can read.

164
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,329
Like your father.

165
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,489
You know my father?
I knew him.

166
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,729
What happened?

167
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:05,369
It was his wish that I made sure
no harm came to you.

168
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:07,529
Were you bitten?
What?

169
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:10,569
Did it bite you?
No.

170
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:13,929
No bleeding through the nose?
What do you mean? No...

171
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,009
We're not infected if that's what
you're asking. Oh, yes, you are.

172
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:20,129
A mutant has only to breathe on you
to infect you.

173
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:24,369
The bite is just quicker.
There is still time,

174
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,729
But there will be more of them,
so follow me.

175
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:30,009
You're lying.

176
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,529
There's nothing wrong with us.

177
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,369
Your mouth will go dry,
and your thirst will be unquenchable.

178
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:42,489
Your lungs will tighten, your nose
will bleed and your eyes will sting,

179
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:46,609
Then your heart will race.
Now, follow me.

180
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,449
If we're infected, why did you get
so close? I am immune.

181
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:58,969
What's "immune?"
I can't catch the disease.

182
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:01,889
How is that possible?

183
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,689
The cure is a powder, a yellow powder.

184
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:12,489
There wasn't much of it, and what
little is left will be hard to get.

185
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,729
We have water, but there's no food.

186
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,769
Don't worry, they can't get in.
Yeah, but won't they leave?

187
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,329
They know we're here. They won't stop.
They want to kill like rabid dogs.

188
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:52,649
Then we must pray,
put ourselves in god's hands.

189
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,569
We must have faith.

190
00:26:56,569 --> 00:27:00,129
Gather round and let us pray.

191
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,369
Oh, lord, be with us,
protect us from this evil...

192
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,369
Are you taking us to the yellow powder?

193
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,729
We must first go to my home.

194
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:24,889
There are things we need to pick up.

195
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,049
How come the beasts
never found you out here?

196
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:33,929
They're frightened of water.
Helps keep them at bay.

197
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,249
Don't worry.
They will never cross this water.

198
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,729
Did you build this?

199
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,329
It's from the old world.

200
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,329
I just patched it up.

201
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,409
Neenah.

202
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,089
We have visitors.

203
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,850
Why?

204
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,489
He is jaret's son.

205
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:44,809
He doesn't belong here.

206
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:49,969
They need our help. Their village
was attacked by mutants.

207
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:53,329
You brought infected people here,
to our home?

208
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,929
They weren't bitten.
They still have some time. Neenah.

209
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,169
He can read. I don't care.
How can you be so reckless?

210
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:09,209
Don't you see what this means?
It means you have put us in danger.

211
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:14,329
Look at him. He's a boy.
How can he do what jaret did?

212
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:17,249
It's worth the risk.

213
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,969
This is our son, Persk.

214
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:28,889
It's been a while
since he's seen others.

215
00:29:28,889 --> 00:29:32,689
Hi. I am Dorel...
Persk...

216
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,889
The beasts have gone.

217
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,649
I wouldn't be so sure.

218
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,969
It's so quiet.

219
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,249
Open it.

220
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,409
No... don't touch the door.

221
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:10,169
There might be other survivors from
our tribe out there who need our help.

222
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:13,569
No one else survived, and neither
will we if we open this door.

223
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:17,609
No... Kaleb is not dead.

224
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,289
I am sorry, Miru.

225
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:24,129
He isn't dead.

226
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,529
Neenah...

227
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,489
Neenah, don't be angry.
I am scared, amal.

228
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:48,929
I know what you're going to do.
For what?

229
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:53,769
If Kaleb can do what his father did,
think what that would mean.

230
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:01,889
But for you to go back there you were
so lucky to get out the last time.

231
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:04,329
Then think of persk.

232
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:08,169
Why should he have to grow up in a
world where people live in hiding?

233
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,089
It's been good enough for us.

234
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,369
We're happy here, aren't we?

235
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:23,529
But what about his children,
and the others who are out there?

236
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:29,409
They will never be safe unless we
can learn to make the powder.

237
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,089
Are we going to look persk
in the eye and tell....

238
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:36,089
....him we never took the one
chance that came our way?

239
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,649
What did your elders teach
you about the disease?

240
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:45,009
That god created it
as punishment for man's sins.

241
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:49,809
The old world was full of greed, and men
created machines that got out of control,

242
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:54,489
And they meddled with nature,
and only god could stop them.

243
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,129
Men were trying to perfect
their own design.

244
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:02,729
They found a way to bring
extinct animals back to life

245
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:05,809
Like the mammoth
and sloth that you hunt,

246
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:10,129
But their science
also brought us the disease.

247
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:13,169
It wasn't long before
the whole world was infected.

248
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:18,049
The disease ate into the human brain,
turning men into mutants.

249
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:23,409
How do you know all of this?
Because I met Kaleb's father.

250
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,969
Jaret had the courage
to look for the old knowledge.

251
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,529
He found out what really happened.

252
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,369
It was your father, Kaleb,
who discovered the cure.

253
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:41,089
The yellow powder?

254
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,849
It took him many years to find the
right mixture of plants and fungus.

255
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:51,249
Once you inhale the powder,
you're protected.

256
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:55,089
What if you already have...
the disease?

257
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:59,689
Once you have turned,
then the powder is useless...

258
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:03,049
But if you get it in time,
then there is still hope.

259
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:08,049
So why didn't my father bring the powder
home? He was doing just that when he died...

260
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:10,929
....and the secret of the powder
died with him.

261
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:14,289
But you kept the powder.
So you're safe, while we...

262
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:19,809
No. The powder was stolen,
and it will be hard to get it back.

263
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:22,809
But you will help us try?

264
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,809
Yes. If we can keep Kaleb alive,

265
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:33,369
He will be able to carry on
his father's work.

266
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,369
They're all from the old world.

267
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,209
My father would often disappear
for months at a time.

268
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:59,129
He told me that out there were answers
to all our questions.

269
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,849
I now understand his fascination.

270
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,529
Your father had this on him
when he died.

271
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,449
He said there'd be
more adventures.

272
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:26,929
I have only read one book. How will I ever
unlock the secret of the yellow powder?

273
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,729
You're the only one
who can read, Kaleb.

274
00:34:30,729 --> 00:34:35,809
But if we find the powder that exists.
We only need enough for our people.

275
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:41,169
Your father risked everything teaching you
to read and leaving the safety of his tribe.

276
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:45,129
Now... I am risking everything.

277
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,649
Saving just a few people
is not an option.

278
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,969
Perhaps our prayers have been answered Yisir.

279
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,529
What are we waiting for?
That is not god's way.

280
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,729
Well, shouldn't we at least try?
We will not scurry into the bowels....

281
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:18,729
....of the earth like animals
as our forefathers did.

282
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:23,209
They were punished for their sins.
Would god punish us for trying to survive?

283
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:28,049
We must have faith and courage,
and wait for this evil to pass.

284
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:34,169
If I'd have had enough courage,
I would have listened to Kaleb.

285
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,689
- Here.
- Let me help.

286
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,689
We should wake them.
Give them one last chance.

287
00:37:31,689 --> 00:37:34,729
They made their choice.

288
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,449
It's time to go.

289
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,969
Uh, w-we're ready to leave.

290
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,409
Washing my hair's a simple thing,
but it makes me feel better.

291
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,129
Amal expects me
to perform miracles.

292
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:31,649
Well, you were the one who sought the knowledge
of the old world. Yeah, and the truth,

293
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:35,729
And Savan still isn't convinced.
Do not judge him.

294
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:39,609
All these things we never knew have
shattered everything that we believe in.

295
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,609
He finds it hard to accept.

296
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,729
Savan will be a good chief.

297
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,089
He is brave
and he is after the challenge.

298
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:59,289
You don't think, I am?

299
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:02,209
We soon find out.

300
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,209
Okay, persk,
take care of your mom.

301
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,369
How deep do you think it is?

302
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:51,489
The ceiling's gone. It could have blocked
the whole tunnel.

303
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:56,929
No, it can't have. I can still feel a breeze.
Well, you only need a small gap for that.

304
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,729
What are you doing?

305
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:05,289
If it's a small gap, you need a small
person to fit through it.

306
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,489
Miru.

307
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,409
That will stay on top of the water?
It will....

308
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:32,369
...as long as you stay on,
you will be safe.

309
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,889
Jump.

310
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,449
Come on.
It's okay.

311
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,569
I am walking on water.
Yes, it floats.

312
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,489
This river will lead us
to the yellow powder.

313
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:10,929
That's a paddle.
Use both hands.

314
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,809
Here, let me show you.

315
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:17,369
That's it. Good.

316
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,529
I think she's okay.

317
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:50,249
It's okay.
There's a way through.

318
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:52,409
Give me your hand.

319
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,849
Miru.
There's something in the water.

320
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,569
There's something in the water.
What is it?

321
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,769
Get them off me. Get them off.
It's okay.

322
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:07,729
Get them off...
Miru, it's okay. I am getting them off.

323
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,129
It's all right,
It's all right...

324
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:18,689
It's all right.
I think they're all gone.

325
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:22,169
Do we look for another way?
No.

326
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,809
We have come too far.

327
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,769
Right. When I go through,
just get them off me fast, okay?

328
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,889
Paddle.
Get in the middle.

329
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:26,609
The middle.
Row to the middle.

330
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,729
I fear they will never leave.

331
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,369
Let's hope the others
aren't punished for their doubts.

332
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,289
There was a group of us,

333
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:33,569
A brotherhoods, that was formed to help
protect each tribe from the mutants.

334
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,129
After jaret discovered the powder,

335
00:44:40,129 --> 00:44:42,009
We thought
if we could immunize enough tribes.....

336
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:46,609
People could come out of hiding,
start to rebuild the world.

337
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:49,489
But we were betrayed.

338
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:52,009
By one of our own.

339
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,249
A man called gagen stole the powder.

340
00:44:56,249 --> 00:45:00,689
But won't he help us
if he sees that we're sick?

341
00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:06,009
You don't know this man.
He turned an island into a fortress,

342
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,329
His empire.

343
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:13,249
Gagen has hordes of followers

344
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:16,809
Who will kill for the chance
to inhale the yellow powder,

345
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,769
And kill they do.

346
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,169
You okay?
Those leech bites really sting.

347
00:45:26,169 --> 00:45:29,649
Yeah, well, not
as much as a beast bite.

348
00:45:29,649 --> 00:45:32,489
If you put it that way,
I am beginning to enjoy it.

349
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:34,929
Over here.

350
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,569
Looks like we got
our miracle after all.

351
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:42,849
Half a miracle.

352
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:46,849
We have still got to climb it.
I will go first.

353
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,929
Were you bitten?
No.

354
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:57,529
Did they claw you?
We were fighting. I don't know.

355
00:45:57,529 --> 00:46:01,049
Maybe being close is all it takes.
We don't know that.

356
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:06,049
Yeah, but if it is, then we're all
infected. Then we're all going to turn.

357
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,369
Okay, we'd better get going.

358
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:13,809
Right.
Let's finish what we started.

359
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:36,649
You know that Kaleb must find his father's
work. Above all else. Do you understand?

360
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:51,929
Kaleb. I never thanked you.
For what?

361
00:46:51,929 --> 00:46:55,929
For saving my life back at the village,
after the attack.

362
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,369
I haven't saved anyone yet.

363
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:03,329
Well, you saved me, so thank you.

364
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,809
Oh, no. No...

365
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:35,529
Get down quickly.

366
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,609
Go on.
Leave me.

367
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:53,769
Leave me.

368
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:56,809
I will carry you.

369
00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:01,249
You two can still get out of here.
I am dead either way. Move.

370
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:01,999
Go.

371
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:06,720
Go. No.

372
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:09,310
No.

373
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:35,969
When the old world died, how many
survived? It's impossible to say.

374
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:39,889
Each of the brotherhood
came from a tribe of 60 or 70.

375
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:43,649
Are they all still out there?
Scattered, staying hidden.

376
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:49,329
We set up these beacons as a warning
system. A beacon is lit, help will come.

377
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:52,009
That's the theory.

378
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:55,409
Let's see who's up for the fight.

379
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,570
Run.

380
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,929
What did he say?

381
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:14,649
Run. Mutants.

382
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:19,490
Run.

383
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,449
Run.
To the raft.

384
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,849
We have to go back.
No, he's finished.

385
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:11,369
We can't just leave him.

386
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:14,249
We have to go.
No. Come on.

387
00:51:14,249 --> 00:51:17,889
Where are you going? Get to the
raft, dorel. Without amal? Come on.

388
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,649
But what about the brotherhood? He lit
the beacon. He said others would come.

389
00:51:48,649 --> 00:51:53,209
He said they might come. Do you
want to wait along with the beasts?

390
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:56,289
The river is our only chance.

391
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,040
No.

392
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:04,049
The yellow powder's our only chance.

393
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:19,689
If this is to be our time,
Let us leave this world together.

394
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,489
We tried.

395
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:30,569
I never understood your father before.

396
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:33,849
He would be proud of you.

397
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:57,009
Is it just us?
Let's hope not.

398
00:53:57,009 --> 00:53:59,929
Have you seen amal?

399
00:53:59,929 --> 00:54:03,369
Well, this is his beacon.
He must be here.

400
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,969
Who's that?
Well, that's not him.

401
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:10,329
That's garth and his brother.

402
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,689
How are you feeling?

403
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:28,939
Okay.

404
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:40,049
Have we gone too far?

405
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:43,169
Maybe we passed it in the night.

406
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:45,969
I don't think so.

407
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:23,369
Here.
Over here.

408
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,729
Give me a hand.

409
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:43,649
I wonder how many people lived
in a village like this?

410
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:53,569
Come on. Let's find this gagen and get
the powder. But there's only three of us.

411
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:57,689
We won't give him a choice. If we
can't reason with him, we will fight him.

412
00:55:57,689 --> 00:56:02,449
We can't fight him, Savan.
We don't have to.

413
00:56:02,449 --> 00:56:06,809
We will convince him
we have something he needs.

414
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,609
What's the problem?

415
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:19,049
I saw you.

416
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:19,769
Thief.

417
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:27,129
Please, please, I won't do it again, I promise.
I promise I won't do it again. Please?

418
00:57:27,129 --> 00:57:30,049
You won't.

419
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:52,569
Who are you?
It's all right. We're not with them.

420
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,849
We came down the river.

421
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:03,249
Then you have got the disease. Leave me
alone. We came for the yellow powder.

422
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,889
We all came for the yellow powder.

423
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:10,889
How do we find it?
You find it...

424
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,689
Do you know a man called gagen?

425
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,530
Gagen...

426
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,889
Savan, let him go.

427
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,569
Stop.
I only want to ask you a question.

428
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:50,529
Jaret's son, Kaleb...
He can read.

429
00:58:50,529 --> 00:58:53,729
His village was attacked by mutants.

430
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:56,489
There are survivors, trapped.

431
00:58:56,489 --> 00:59:00,249
Kaleb and two others have gone
to get the yellow powder.

432
00:59:00,249 --> 00:59:03,609
Against gagen?
They need our help.

433
00:59:03,609 --> 00:59:09,569
Gagen's forces are too strong for us.
This boy, he could be the savior of mankind.

434
00:59:09,569 --> 00:59:12,289
It's too risky.
Is that not worth the risk?

435
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:15,609
We are all immune, and so are our tribes.
Not your children's children,

436
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:20,049
And we have no powder to give them.
What about their future?

437
00:59:20,049 --> 00:59:24,329
Or the others, way beyond our lands?

438
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:30,449
With the yellow powder, we could come out of
hiding and join forces against the mutants.

439
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:33,809
This could be our last chance.

440
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,329
Let go of me.

441
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,249
Bring them.

442
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:20,609
Sir... we do not recognize them,
so we think they might be infected.

443
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:29,849
We have come here for the yellow powder
I know why you're here.

444
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:42,929
You're wasting your time, giselle.
She's still a human being.

445
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:45,729
Not for much longer.

446
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:09,889
My daughter is a compassionate soul.
I am afraid she doesn't get it from me.

447
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:13,209
I can't help you. Get them off my island
before they turn.

448
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:16,969
I have come to help you, gagen.

449
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:23,369
I didn't know I needed help.

450
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:27,569
When you took the yellow powder, you
must have known it wouldn't last forever.

451
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:31,489
That powder was a gift. It was given to me.
A gift from a dying man.

452
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:34,449
That man was my father.

453
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:39,089
Your father was jaret?
The one who discovered the yellow powder.

454
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:48,049
His dying wish was that it benefits
everyone, not be hoarded by one man.

455
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:52,769
- Is that true?
- No.

456
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:57,529
My father could read. So can I.

457
01:02:57,529 --> 01:03:00,169
I don't believe you.

458
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:15,209
"for abraham lincoln,
"there was no satisfaction

459
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:18,569
"over his victory,

460
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:23,409
"for he had inherited a country

461
01:03:23,409 --> 01:03:27,369
That was tearing itself apart."

462
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:34,729
I have come to carry on my father's
work. I can make the yellow powder.

463
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:36,329
Give us some of yours so that I will live....

464
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:40,529
...let us take some to our village,
then I will make you as much as you need.

465
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:45,169
If I fail you, you can kill me. You're
dying already. You will say anything.

466
01:03:45,169 --> 01:03:48,529
First, prove what you say,
and I will give you the powder.

467
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,809
We don't have enough time.
Well, then, you'd better be quick.

468
01:03:55,809 --> 01:03:59,329
What yellow powder remains
is for my children's children.

469
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:03,889
Outsiders can stay on the island.
We will protect them from the mutants,

470
01:04:03,889 --> 01:04:06,569
But they must work.
We have seen them work.

471
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:11,609
Unless, of course, they're infected,
and then I offer them a quick death,

472
01:04:11,609 --> 01:04:16,609
A courtesy I will extend to you and
your friend when the time comes.

473
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:29,929
If it wasn't for his father, we'd all be
dead. Let them have some of the powder...

474
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:35,009
Giselle, enough. Take him into the library,
and you know what to do with her.

475
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:47,049
Was he telling the truth?
Did you steal the yellow powder?

476
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:51,609
It wasn't his father
who kept us alive. It was me.

477
01:04:51,609 --> 01:04:54,009
There just wasn't enough.

478
01:04:54,009 --> 01:04:56,289
Did you steal it?

479
01:04:56,289 --> 01:04:59,409
You think I am a tyrant?

480
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,769
I kept us safe.

481
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:08,329
One day, you will have children...

482
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:11,489
and you will understand.

483
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:25,569
I know you want to help us. I am
not going to hurt you. All right?

484
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,369
Show me where the powder is.

485
01:05:30,369 --> 01:05:34,769
I can't betray my father.
How many has he betrayed?

486
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:40,969
Your friend said he could make more.
Maybe, eventually, but he's just stalling.

487
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:45,449
I am sorry. I can't...
Then you're killing us,

488
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:49,129
and all that's left of my tribe.
Is that what you want?

489
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:06,609
I have spent my entire life
clinging to a small patch of rock,

490
01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:09,649
Thinking we were
the only ones left,

491
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:13,689
But there could be thousands
of survivors out there.

492
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:17,129
And they deserve the chance
you have been given.

493
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:24,729
I will take you to where the powder is
kept, but it won't do you any good.

494
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:51,209
Where do I start?

495
01:06:54,570 --> 01:07:00,609
It's in there, but we need the key,
Which is around my father's neck. Always.

496
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:13,609
When is the last time he got some powder?
Um... yesterday.

497
01:07:13,609 --> 01:07:16,009
Then this isn't where he keeps it.

498
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:19,409
This door hasn't been
opened in a long time.

499
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:26,929
It doesn't make sense. Whenever he comes
out of here, he always has the powder.

500
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:09,369
This is all my father's work.

501
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:18,249
You really don't know
what you're doing.

502
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:23,089
I can do this, just not quickly.

503
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,609
It could take weeks.

504
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:32,089
If gagen gives us enough powder for our tribe,
I will come back and make him as much as he needs.

505
01:08:32,089 --> 01:08:35,369
Only to find out
this has all been a ruse.

506
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:38,769
You're out of time.

507
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:54,929
Somebody, end this. Please...

508
01:08:54,929 --> 01:08:59,089
Remi, do something.
He's an elder. I can't.

509
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:07,289
Miru.

510
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:36,609
When it's time,
I hope you do the same for me.

511
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:47,489
As I thought.

512
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:55,369
Give me the powder.

513
01:09:55,369 --> 01:09:59,129
Where do I draw the line?

514
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:04,529
You know how many people have
asked me for the same thing?

515
01:10:04,529 --> 01:10:07,849
You know I can do this.

516
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:14,569
Or is that what you're afraid of?

517
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:19,329
To lose your hold
on all these people?

518
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,409
Father.

519
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:26,329
There's someone in the safe
room, searching for the powder.

520
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:59,089
Don't kill him. No.

521
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:06,009
When I tell you,
take a deep breath.

522
01:11:06,009 --> 01:11:08,169
Are you ready?

523
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:13,569
Give it a few minutes.
Dorel doesn't have a few minutes.

524
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,529
Take me to her.

525
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:19,449
Open the door.

526
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:24,089
I wouldn't go in there. She's starting
to turn. She needs more water.

527
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:32,169
Hey. What are you doing?

528
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:41,009
Breathe. Dorel... breathe.

529
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:55,889
Okay... okay, come on.
Let's go, babe.

530
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:01,649
You should come with us.
I don't want to leave the island.

531
01:12:01,649 --> 01:12:05,249
And your father? He will forgive you for
helping us? It's you he will be after.

532
01:12:05,249 --> 01:12:08,049
This is the future of my people, too.

533
01:12:08,049 --> 01:12:12,889
Tell Kaleb to keep his promise
and continue his father's work.

534
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:47,889
He has to breathe it in.
Get it in front of his face.

535
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:53,009
He's not breathing.
Watch out.

536
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:02,129
Kaleb?
Kaleb, can you hear me? Kaleb?

537
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:06,849
Kaleb, we have the powder, but
we have to leave now. Come on.

538
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:15,609
- Hey.
- Stop. Stop them.

539
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:17,969
This way.

540
01:13:17,969 --> 01:13:19,569
This way.
Hurry.

541
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:21,889
- Come on.
- They are heading into the water.

542
01:13:21,889 --> 01:13:26,000
- They're getting away. Move it.
- Kill them.

543
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,449
- I will draw them away.
- No, Savan.

544
01:13:29,449 --> 01:13:32,649
Don't worry, I will catch up.

545
01:13:32,649 --> 01:13:34,329
After them.

546
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:31,430
[SAVAN]
Let's go. Go.

547
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:41,289
Go. Did you lose them?
They will want their powder back.

548
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:01,289
We can't go back upriver. We will be fighting
the current. We will have to go inland.

549
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:05,649
How will we find our way back?
We have Kaleb.

550
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:09,769
He's a good tracker.

551
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:04,689
They have gone overland. They're still
alive. They must have the powder.

552
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,489
Over there.

553
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,009
Keep going.

554
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:05,969
Gagen. Go.

555
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:26,569
- Kaleb, Kaleb...
- Can you run?

556
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:35,849
Kaleb, if you can get to grey rock start
picking the beasts off from the tree line.

557
01:17:35,849 --> 01:17:37,449
It's not much,
but it might give you a chance.

558
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:41,089
What are you doing?
Kaleb must survive.

559
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:44,609
I am not leaving without you.
No... I am the chief. Do as I say.

560
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:49,769
- Savan.
- Savan.

561
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:53,969
Run, dorel.

562
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:57,969
Go back. Go back.

563
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:10,169
No. Savan.

564
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:02,569
We can't stop now.

565
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:24,089
Amal.
Have you got the powder?

566
01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:25,969
Yeah.

567
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:31,209
Then let's get it to your people.

568
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:55,489
Remi, please.
Please, you have to help me.

569
01:19:55,489 --> 01:19:59,569
You have to, please.
Please end this now. Please.

570
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:02,929
No, I can't.
End it, Remi, please.

571
01:20:02,929 --> 01:20:05,569
I can't take it, please...

572
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:01,369
Let me in.

573
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:06,209
It's dorel.

574
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:10,329
Give them the powder.

575
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:13,849
No.

576
01:21:13,849 --> 01:21:17,729
Please, I need you to do it.
I can't stand it, please.

577
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:19,409
Help me.

578
01:21:19,409 --> 01:21:21,729
I have got the cure.
Do it.

579
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:25,849
Miru.

580
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:42,769
Lift her. Sit her up.

581
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,249
Okay, Miru, listen to me.

582
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:50,049
Take-take a deep breath.

583
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:02,010
Dorel.

584
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:34,049
Miru?
She's alive.

585
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:42,049
I want my powder.

586
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:45,409
It's not yours.

587
01:22:45,409 --> 01:22:48,329
It never was.

588
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:50,769
It was for my people.

589
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,609
Ready?
Close your mouth.

590
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:41,329
Good.
Okay, you can lie back.

591
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:45,569
You're back.

592
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,769
I promised, didn't I?

593
01:23:51,769 --> 01:23:54,729
Let's get you out of here.

594
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:20,929
He should have returned by now.
I do not think he is coming back.

595
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:26,329
We should gather our men.
No. No more "vengeance."

596
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:31,489
Would your father wanted that?
To him "The powder" was a weapon.

597
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:36,369
But in really it is a cure.

598
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:56,049
You sure about this?
I am sure about this.

599
01:24:56,049 --> 01:25:00,609
To continue my father's work,
I have to go back.

600
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:10,009
Take care. And you.

601
01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:17,170
Bye.

602
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,609
"b"...
What's after "b"?

603
01:25:25,609 --> 01:25:27,729
"c".
Very good. And what's after?

604
01:25:27,729 --> 01:25:28,449
"d"....

605
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:37,009
See you. Take care of yourself, okay?
Yeah. You, too, brother.

606
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:45,249
What's this one?
"h, i..."

607
01:25:45,249 --> 01:25:48,209
"j, k......"

608
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:49,130
Kaleb.

609
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:54,209
Bye, Persk.
