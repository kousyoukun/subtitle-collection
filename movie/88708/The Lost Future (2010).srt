savan!

4
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,451
Uri has ordered us
to turn back.

00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,586
Savan!

6
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,422
Age has made him too cautious.

7
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,657
He's my father,

8
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,526
I can speak of him as i wish.

9
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,195
When you're chief,
you'll want respect.

10
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,164
It's not just
a matter of respect.

11
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,266
Now, stay close...

12
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,634
And tonight, yomak,

13
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,269
You will feast on the heart
with me.

14
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,285
Are you deaf, savan?

15
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:32,692
We do not separate, ever.

16

You may not agree
with my methods.

17
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,829
We haven't had
fresh meat in weeks.

18
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,564
Roots and berries
are not enough for us.

19
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,734
You've got
a lot to learn, savan.

20
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,870
I've proved myself
the best hunter in this tribe.

21
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,439
Hunting is not just
about courage.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
You've got to be clever, too.

23
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,876
We are not the only
predators out here.

24
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,612
We are tired
of being hungry.

25
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,381
Let me lead this hunt,
and we will make our kill,

26
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,883
And tonight the village
will have reason to celebrate,

27
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,585
And the women will show
their gratitude.

[Laughter]

29
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,091

What's it to be then,

35
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,676
Roast kaleb or boiled kaleb?

36
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,179
You belong with the women,

37
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,080
Not with the hunt.

38
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,948
It's ahead.
I've tracked it.

39

the deadly blueberry?

pushed our luck.

Should i not
question them?

00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,133
Kaleb, it is the elders
who have kept us safe,

Not our father.

I knew him.

What happened?

355
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,709
It was his wish

That i made sure
no harm came to you.

Were you bitten?

What?

Did it bite you?

No.

No...

Oh, yes, you are.

365
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,593
A mutant has only
to breathe on you

To infect you.

367

The bite is just quicker.

There is still time,

who are out there?

That came our way?

What did your elders
teach you about the disease?

481

That god created it

482

As punishment
for man's sins.

483
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,526
The old world
was full of greed,

484
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,496
And men created machines
that got out of control,

485
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,431
And they meddled
with nature,

486

And only god
could stop them.

487

Men were trying to perfect
their own design.

They found a way to bring
extinct animals back to life

Like the mammoth
and sloth that you hunt,

490
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,016
But their science
also brought us the disease.

491
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:10,020
It wasn't long before
the whole world was infected.

492
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,057
The disease ate into
the human brain,

493

Turning men into mutants.

494
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,995
How do you know
all of this?

495
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,997
Because i met kaleb's father.

496
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,001
Jaret had the courage

497
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,070
To look for
the old knowledge.

498
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:30,508
He found out
what really happened.

499
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,043
It was your father, kaleb,

500
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,846
Who discovered
the cure.

501
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,448
The yellow powder?

502
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,219
It took him many years

503
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,956
To find the right mixture
of plants and fungus.

504
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,992
Once you inhale the powder,

505
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,226
You're protected.

506
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,529
What if you already have...

507

The disease?

508
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:56,500
Once you have turned,
then the powder is useless...

509
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,739
But if you get it in time,
then there is still hope.

510
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,608
So why didn't my father
bring the powder home?

511
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,610
He was doing just that
when he died...

512
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:10,014
And the secret of the powder
died with him.

513
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:11,148
But you kept
the powder.

514
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,250
So you're safe, while we--

No.

516

517
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,623
And it will be hard
to get it back.

Yes.

for months at a time.

He told me that out there

Were answers
to all our questions.

526

I now understand
his fascination.

Your father
had this on him

When he died.

529

How will i ever unlock
the secret of the yellow powder?

You're the only one
who can read, kaleb.

We only need enough
for our people.

537

Teaching you to read

And leaving the safety
of his tribe.

I'm risking everything.

Well, shouldn't we
at least try?

They were punished
for their sins!

Would god punish us
for trying to survive?

Or the others,
way beyond our lands?

With the yellow powder,

851
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,734
We could come out of hiding

852
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:09,705
And join forces
against the mutants.

853

This could be our last chance.

We do not recognize them,

So we think
they might be infected.

[Coughing and spluttering]

is a compassionate soul.

I'm afraid she doesn't

I didn't know i needed help.

When you took
the yellow powder,

You must've known
it wouldn't last forever.

That powder was a gift.

878
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:16,825
It was given to me.

879
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:17,860
A gift from
a dying man.

880
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:20,129
That man was my father.

Your father was jaret?

01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,601
The one who discovered
the yellow powder.

883
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,975
His dying wish was that
it benefits everyone,

884
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,244
Not be hoarded by one man.

885
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:38,380
Is that true?

No.

887
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:43,419
My father could read.

First, prove what you say,
and i'll give you the powder.

We don't have

Well, then,
you'd better be quick.

What yellow powder

Outsiders can stay
on the island.

We'll protect them
from the mutants,

We've seen them work.

they're infected,

the yellow powder?

01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:57,885
To continue
my father's work,

Yeah. You, too,
brother.

1195
