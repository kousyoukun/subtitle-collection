1
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,675
- You filthy...
- Little flirt.

2
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,739
- How much?
- Piss off!

3
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,780
God knows if you're worth it.

4
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,550
But fortunately, I can afford to find out.

5
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,227
Payment on delivery, my darling.

6
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,483
Of course it is.

7
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,810
Mind the doors.

8
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,832
Alex, help him.

9
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,864
Leave him alone, he's a drunk.

10
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,912
Patricia, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

11
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,841
- Come on.
- He might be a diabetic.

12
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,180
See if there's a card in his wallet.

13
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,261
"This card entitles James Manfred OBE...

14
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,130
"to entry and one free drink at any
of the 100 clubs listed on the back."

15
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,696
No diabetic, Patricia.

16
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,167
A drunk, but a titled one. Come on.

17
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,004
No, I don't smell any drink.

18
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,470
He's sick. He may have had a heart attack.

19
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,037
- We'll tell somebody he's here.
- We can't just leave him.

20
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,379
In New York, you walk over these guys...

21
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,318
We're not in New York.

22
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,081
All right, you stay with him,
I'll go on upstairs to get help.

23
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,660
No, I'll come.

24
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,528
Tickets, please.

25
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,997
I'm sure he was just a drunk.

26
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,440
- Please tell him, or I will.
- I don't want to get involved.

27
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,104
- He might be dying. Tell him.
- All right.

28
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,942
Excuse me.

29
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,012
There's a man collapsed
down on the platform.

30
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,111
- Will you call an ambulance?
- Please hurry, he's unconscious.

31
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,752
I couldn't use the phone, sir.

32
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,090
To do that, I'd have to stop the lift.
There's a point outside.

33
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,925
I got to get out and plug it in there.
Then you can use it.

34
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,626
I think it's best to wait till we get there.
Then we can all go down again.

35
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,364
It's the only thing to do
under the circumstances, quite honestly.

36
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,563
Excuse me, sir.

37
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,109
Constable, just a minute.

38
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,249
- Yes, sir. What seems to be the trouble?
- Alex, tell him.

39
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,479
Officer, there's a sick man down
on the platform, probably just a drunk.

40
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,855
- He's not drunk, he's unconscious.
- She thinks he's dying.

41
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,729
- Perhaps we'd better take a look.
- Yeah.

42
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,734
- Where is this man exactly?
- On the staircase.

43
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,465
- The bottom or the top of the staircase?
- The bottom.

44
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,638
Where is he? Along here?

45
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,248
Probably just a waste
of your time, Constable.

46
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,114
I'm sure he's just a drunk sleeping it off.

47
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,315
It's always best to make sure.
Better safe than sorry.

48
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,483
Yeah, I suppose so.

49
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,516
Wake up.

50
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,161
I can't wake up.

51
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,363
I can't sleep.

52
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,464
I hadn't noticed.

53
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,300
I keep thinking about him.
Do you think he's all right?

54
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,036
Of course he's all right.

55
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,977
It's horrible.

56
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,120
We saw a sick man on the subway.

57
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,289
Tried to help him.

58
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,060
What else could we do?

59
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,765
Worry.

60
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,100
Come in here, Romeo.

61
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,039
Morning, sir.

62
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,871
What have our villains
been up to during the night?

63
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,412
Nothing much.

64
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,913
Saving themselves up
for a rainy day, are they?

65
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,485
- Usual crop of petty larceny.
- Nothing else?

66
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,451
Attempted smash and grab in Bond Street.

67
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,021
A taxi driver thumped a passenger.

68
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,454
- Provocation?
- Right, sir.

69
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,457
- Marshall.
- Coming, sir,

70
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,561
Go on, Rogers.

71
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,757
There's a report of a funny incident
at Russell Square tube station.

72
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,925
- Yes, sir?
- Tea!

73
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,499
Sorry, sir, I had to get some more tea bags.

74
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,703
Tea bags? You've been using tea bags?

75
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,973
They're standard issue now, sir.

76
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,576
And I've been blaming the Indians.

77
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,309
Do you still want some, sir?

78
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,915
- Of course I want some.
- Very good, sir.

79
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,714
- What's funny about it?
- What, sir?

80
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,052
Russell Square tube station.

81
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,152
Two students, an American, Alex Campbell,
and a girl, Patricia Wilson...

82
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,357
called a constable and reported
a man unconscious on the platform.

83
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,956
When they got there, he had gone.

84
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,333
Probably he fainted,
came round and got the next train.

85
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,806
Could be, but the last train had gone.

86
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,501
They came in on it.
They said the man was dying.

87
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,311
- Tea bags?
- Yes, sir, sorry, sir.

88
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,642
Fancy her?

89
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,882
- Dying?
- So they said, sir.

90
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,783
They identified the man as well.

91
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,481
James Manfred OBE.

92
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,854
James Manfred. That rings a bell.
He's some big shit, shot...

93
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,762
at the Ministry of Defense,
or the Home Office, or something.

94
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,597
It doesn't make sense.

95
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,900
What would a geezer like Manfred
be doing in public transport?

96
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,570
Still, we'd better check up and see.

97
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,875
- Have we got addresses for the others?
- Yes, same address.

98
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,917
That's handy.
Hop round and see if he's a nutter.

99
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,512
- Russell Square tube station?
- What? Yes, sir.

100
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,585
Panovsky.

101
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,257
Sauerkraut Panovsky.

102
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,866
A grocer from Kilburn. Look him up.

103
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:56,035
- Missing person?
- No, Who's Who, twit.

104
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,002
A grocer from Kilburn
is automatically a missing person.

105
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,479
Sometimes I think
coppers should be like elephants...

106
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,177
big feet and long memories.

107
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,050
Yes, sir.

108
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,658
Or is it long feet and big...

109
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,123
Jerzy Panovsky.

110
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,098
"Last known whereabouts,
Russell Square tube station.

111
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,464
"Reported missing: December 10."

112
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,433
There's a note to refer to Cohen, Bernard.

113
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,809
December 10? That's just over a month ago.

114
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,639
"Bernard Cohen. Reported missing April 24.

115
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,979
"Last known whereabouts:
Russell Square tube station."

116
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,243
Get on to records.

117
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,288
See out what you can dig up
about James Manfred OB bloody E.

118
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,053
He's had top security screening...

119
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,493
so there's probably not much
we're allowed to know.

120
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,155
But see what you can find out.

121
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,634
There's no crime been committed.

122
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:59,568
Find out what you can
about James Manfred OBE.

123
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,435
And get him on the blower for me.

124
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,100
No crime has been committed.
This is not our case.

125
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,440
If he's so important,
we should get on to Ml5.

126
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,810
- Let them take care of it.
- First let's see if Manfred's missing.

127
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,349
Yes, that's probably a very good idea.

128
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,815
What? Manfred.
Took long enough, didn't it?

129
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,887
Put him on.

130
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,685
James Manfred, please.

131
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,494
What? You're his secretary, are you?

132
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,130
James never stops going on about you.

133
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,369
What? When do you expect him back?

134
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,944
Missed the morning meeting
with the minister?

135
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,008
Naughty.

136
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,474
Naughty boy.
That doesn't sound like James at all.

137
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,485
What? Tell him Princess Anne.

138
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,680
- Princess Anne.
- Piss off!

139
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,485
- Go bring in those students.
- Right, sir.

140
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,894
Where's my football coupon?

141
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,110
- Top floor.
- Thank you.

142
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,664
- Might you be Mr. Alex Campbell, sir?
- Yes, I am.

143
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,995
Det. Sgt. Rogers.

144
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,661
Can you come along to the station
for a few moments?

145
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,104
- What station? What for?
- An incident at Russell Square.

146
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,870
- The Holborn Police Station.
- You mean last night? The drunk?

147
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,909
Yes, sir, the drunk.

148
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,311
Would Miss Patricia Wilson
be about just now?

149
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,006
She had an early lecture.

150
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,649
- But she does normally reside here?
- From time to time.

151
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,683
Yes, if you don't mind.

152
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,281
Why do I have to go all the way down
to the station?

153
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,383
Can't you ask me
what you need to know here?

154
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,826
I wouldn't mind.
It would save me a trip, too.

155
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,023
But the Inspector would appreciate it.

156
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,034
All right.

157
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,741
Is that all?

158
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,506
Yes, sir.

159
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,547
You say you didn't even go down there
and have a look around?

160
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,081
I thought he was just a troublemaker...

161
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,676
especially when he was so reluctant
to help us.

162
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,812
- Anyway...
- What?

163
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,885
Sergeant Rogers is here with Mr. Campbell.

164
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,187
Wheel him in,

165
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,727
Rogers, keep your hands
off the policewomen,

166
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,290
This way, Mr. Campbell.

167
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,141
Go and arrest somebody, Rogers.

168
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,257
Quite an adventure you had last night.

169
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:13,961
Adventure?

170
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,433
Not everyone finds an unconscious man
on the platform of an underground station.

171
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,938
In New York, Inspector,
we call it a holiday when you don't.

172
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:27,576
- So I've heard. But you lost this one.
- I didn't lose him.

173
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,947
He just wasn't there
when we went back with the policeman.

174
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,574
Was he there the first time?

175
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,384
I wasn't drunk, he was.

176
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,422
I told the constable that.

177
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,425
- You didn't tell him more than that?
- No.

178
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,619
Didn't you tell him the man was dying?

179
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,627
I said my girlfriend thought he was.

180
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:50,259
Yes, Miss Wilson,
who resides with you from time to time.

181
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,428
We live together.

182
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,439
Very nice, too.
What made her think the man was dying?

183
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,801
The way he looked, I suppose.
Pale, frightened.

184
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,170
- But you thought he was drunk?
- Yes.

185
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,579
You're some sort of student, are you?

186
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,345
- Student of what?
- International Economics.

187
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,816
Do you think we shall profit
from the Common Market?

188
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,154
My only dispute would be
the ten-mile limit on fishing.

189
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,751
- Where did you meet him?
- Who?

190
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,889
- Manfred. You knew him well, didn't you?
- I never met him.

191
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,263
But you told Constable Pierce...

192
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,968
that his name was James Manfred OBE.

193
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,061
I did.

194
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,164
Did he have his name tattooed
on his forehead?

195
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,108
- I saw his club card.
- He gave it to you?

196
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,707
It was in his wallet.

197
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,839
He was holding it out when he fell down.

198
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,574
Bequeathing it, was he?

199
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,543
What do you want, Inspector?

200
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,818
Could it be you was having
a quick shufti through his pockets...

201
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,189
to see if there was anything worth lifting?

202
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,128
Patricia thought he was a diabetic.

203
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,995
- They carry cards, you know.
- I have heard.

204
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:02,299
He was a drunk. I looked at his card,
I put it back in his wallet.

205
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,134
- You can look...
- In his pocket?

206
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,415
We could do, if we knew where
to find Mr. Manfred, couldn't we?

207
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,453
But he sort of picked up his bed
and walked, didn't he?

208
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,716
Patricia saw me put the wallet back.

209
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,292
Why don't you ask her?

210
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,826
As a matter of fact...

211
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,296
that is precisely what we are doing
at the moment.

212
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,600
How are you getting on with Miss Wilson?

213
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,899
All straightforward, sir,
She confirms Constable Pierce's report,

214
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,701
I thought she would.

215
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,002
That's about it, isn't it?

216
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,274
Next time you find an unconscious OBE,
give us a whistle, will you?

217
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,212
Try not to lose him this time.

218
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,416
Am I free to go?

219
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,685
You haven't been arrested or charged,
have you?

220
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,620
You've been free to go all the time.

221
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:57,822
You've been assisting the police
in their enquiries, as we say here.

222
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,132
You accused me of being a thief.

223
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,396
Why don't you hurry back to your school...

224
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,763
there might be a protest march
for you to join.

225
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,212
Get your hair cut.

226
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,191
A quick cuppa. I need watering.

227
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,075
- Just put it down on the desk, Marshall.
- It's me, sir.

228
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,472
Get anything out of the bird?

229
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,676
- She was telling the truth.
- So was he.

230
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,946
Give me a good liar any time,
more to work on.

231
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,387
Is it that important?
A missing person, not even confirmed yet.

232
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,118
It's been confirmed.

233
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,686
Manfred isn't just a member of the public
to be shoved away in a file somewhere.

234
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,098
He's a geezer with a lot of stick...

235
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,668
and a lot of top-secret information
in his head.

236
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,169
All the more reason
it should be an Ml5 affair.

237
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,099
Ml5, my ass.

238
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,969
Rogers, this is my manor,
don't you forget it.

239
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,777
- So we'd better do something quick.
- Right.

240
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,647
And the first thing we're gonna do
is get some tea.

241
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,513
Alex, you don't understand anything.

242
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,081
- Will you knock it off?
- Will you get my things, please?

243
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,554
You're taking it all too seriously.

244
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,029
And my shampoo.
I only bought it yesterday.

245
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,127
- Pat, what's really bothering you?
- Your whole attitude.

246
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,666
I'm cold, callous, unfeeling.

247
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,206
I've never met anyone
who could treat a dying man...

248
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,937
as if he was a bundle of old clothes,
and I can't live with anyone who does.

249
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,941
My shampoo, please.

250
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:02,084
We tried to help. What happened?

251
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,249
We're talking to the police,
suddenly we're suspects.

252
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,915
It was our duty.

253
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,091
At Holborn?

254
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,356
That wasn't the name of the station.

255
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,824
There used to be one at British Museum,
but that closed down...

256
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,562
when London Transport
bought up the small companies.

257
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,663
Were they connected?
Holborn and British Museum?

258
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,970
I wouldn't be surprised.

259
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,405
It's like a rabbit warren down there.

260
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,642
There we are. Museum.

261
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,144
Right between them.

262
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,213
The old city and South London Company...

263
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:41,019
were tunneling down there in 1892...

264
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,351
when a whole section of the roof collapsed,
burying a number of men.

265
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,427
- Eight of them, and four women.
- Women?

266
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,493
Yes, they used to work
alongside the men in those days.

267
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,368
The men dug and the women
hauled the dirt up to the surface.

268
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,271
Just like in the coal mines.

269
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,368
Get on with it, Richardson.

270
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,141
Interestingly enough,
there was quite a scandal attached to it...

271
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,480
because the company involved
went bankrupt.

272
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,554
They couldn't afford to dig the bodies out.

273
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:13,146
So they abandoned them
and abandoned the whole line.

274
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,887
There were some old tunnelers
who believed there were air pockets there...

275
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,054
and they could have survived for some time.

276
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,691
- But the company refused to listen.
- How could they survive without food?

277
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,433
There's plenty of water and food...

278
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:29,234
because I should imagine
as each one died, the others ate him.

279
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,573
Not a bad drum.

280
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,941
Do themselves all right,
these civil servants, don't they?

281
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,976
Anything worth nicking?

282
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,517
What about this one?

283
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,856
- 17th-century Spanish, I'd say.
- Would you?

284
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,358
How much is it worth?

285
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,491
If it is original, about $5,000.

286
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,801
This geezer Manfred seems to have
a lot of money to throw away on old junk.

287
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,440
I wouldn't exactly call it junk.

288
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,707
I don't care if it's the Mona bloody Lisa,
it's the money I'm thinking of.

289
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:11,946
Suspicious bastard.

290
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,649
Where did he get it?

291
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,151
Maybe inherited it,
or somebody left it to him.

292
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:21,225
Maybe he got it from flogging state secrets.

293
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,213
Monkey nuts.

294
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:50,409
Do you know this geezer owes his tailor...

295
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,147
$620?

296
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:57,494
I've never paid more than 20 nicker
for a suit in my life.

297
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,596
Some would say you've been robbed.

298
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,727
Very funny.

299
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,173
Not while I'm on duty, sir.

300
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,780
Pompous ponce.

301
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,882
- What are you doing there?
- What?

302
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,615
Do you expect to find Manfred
pressed between the pages of a book?

303
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,621
It's not a bloody public library, you know.

304
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,489
Some of these books are false.

305
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:46,743
Hello, there.

306
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,573
I think we're getting somewhere.

307
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,547
Anything on TV?

308
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,256
The bedroom.

309
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,558
Home movies? Very tasty.

310
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:10,061
You'd certainly enjoy looking at them,
wouldn't you, Calhoun?

311
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,603
I might have known you'd turn up.

312
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,244
Just about time, I'd say.

313
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,207
The Chief Superintendent doesn't approve
of extra-mural perversions.

314
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,677
How does the Minister feel about it?

315
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,680
All this is unfortunate, most unfortunate.

316
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,082
You're a master of the understatement.

317
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,957
And you are a master of the overstatement.

318
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,156
I think it's time you were on your way.

319
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,762
This is my manor,
and the villains in it are mine.

320
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:50,465
You're welcome to them,
so just run along and arrest a few.

321
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,134
Missing persons are my concern, too.

322
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:58,045
Yes, missing dentists,
missing greengrocers.

323
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:03,286
But this particular missing person,
as far as you're concerned, Inspector...

324
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,284
is no longer missing.

325
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,256
I don't see him around anywhere.

326
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,328
Do you?

327
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,727
What a droll fellow you are.

328
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,027
The Manfred case is closed.

329
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,130
It was never opened. Clear?

330
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,874
If someone is reported missing
in my manor...

331
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,670
that's my business.

332
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,609
Your dainty little footsteps
are echoing in places...

333
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,409
where one is well advised to tread lightly.

334
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,539
Are you threatening me?

335
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,141
You're very perceptive.

336
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:41,055
Beyond even your well-known,
working-class virility.

337
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,553
Why don't you go back
to planting pot on people?

338
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,893
And mind you don't become
a missing person yourself.

339
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:57,975
Bye-bye.

340
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,371
Don't forget to close the door
on your way out.

341
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,316
- Ml5?
- No, Sergeant, he's a traffic warden.

342
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,168
Yeah, you can say that again.

343
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,246
I'm going to change a fuse. All right?

344
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,115
What did you do on your day off?

345
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:16,914
Yesterday, let me see.
Got up at 11:00, had a nice lay in.

346
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,683
Got up at 11:00, ham and eggs for breakfast.

347
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,549
In the afternoon I went to the pictures,
in the evening I saw that bird.

348
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,186
- What a performer, I tell you.
- Yeah?

349
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,290
What's the matter, Terry?

350
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,960
Who the hell do you think it is?

351
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,489
Oh, shit.

352
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,464
Do you know what time it is?

353
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,306
What?

354
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:21,507
You were quite right to call.
Send a motor round.

355
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,426
Judging from the wounds,
death was definitely...

356
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,656
Better save it for the Inspector.
He should be here quite soon.

357
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,630
I'd like to have a peek.

358
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,334
Helps to settle the cornflakes.

359
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,066
Good morning, sir.

360
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:57,105
It's getting to be an interesting place.

361
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,648
- Where?
- Russell Square underground.

362
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,678
Both men were well nourished.
All the wounds are fresh.

363
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:05,220
- How fresh?
- Not more than three or four hours.

364
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,256
The man they were working with is missing.

365
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,188
- Him I want to see.
- What for?

366
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,124
The strength he's got.

367
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,523
See this.

368
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,325
Right through, in and out the other side.

369
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,960
And you saw what that did.

370
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,866
I don't think I want to meet him.
We'll leave him to Rogers.

371
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,768
You'll find him for us, won't you?

372
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,103
- Shouldn't be too difficult.
- Good. Anything else?

373
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,769
The usual extensive bruising
on the arms and upper body.

374
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,847
Deep abrasions across the face.
Broken ribs on one.

375
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,715
Cracked vertebrae on another.
Couple of fractures.

376
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,808
- They fought hard.
- Not hard enough.

377
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,480
When do you expect some lab results?

378
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,890
I should have something
for you this evening.

379
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,857
- That's a stroke of luck, isn't it?
- Why's that, sir?

380
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,592
Murder is police business.

381
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,760
And murder, where James Manfred OBE
went missing...

382
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,100
is definitely my business, wouldn't you say?

383
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:56,773
Come on.

384
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,154
- What time is it, babe?
- 9:00.

385
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,818
- I've got a class in 15 minutes.
- Don't you want any breakfast?

386
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:21,159
No, I've got to meet Bob at the bookshop
this afternoon to give him a hand.

387
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,461
Why don't you come by after classes?

388
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,762
- You know what I want?
- What?

389
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,531
There's a book by William Frost
on poltergeists.

390
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,606
I'll ask him.

391
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,233
Maybe we can catch some dinner
at the cafe and a film.

392
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,869
- Great.
- 'Bye.

393
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,629
- Can I help you?
- I'm just browsing.

394
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,075
Do you happen to have
a copy of the Kama Sutra?

395
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,041
- Just in paperback.
- I'll take it.

396
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,549
The Inspector would like to ask you
a few more questions.

397
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:22,810
I'm working.

398
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,118
May I borrow your assistant for a while?

399
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,350
Dick Tracy wants to see me again.

400
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,061
How are you doing, Dracula?

401
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,730
You know, of course,
there were four men down there?

402
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,803
Four men?

403
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,708
The two victims.

404
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,243
And the suspect, Macdonald.
We're after him.

405
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:53,740
- This one?
- Yeah.

406
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,012
And him.

407
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:59,077
- Who is that?
- Search me.

408
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,153
Different blood group?

409
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,354
Different blood.

410
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,954
This film shows
that he's got megaloblastic anemia.

411
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,056
There are no platelets
and a total vitamin deficiency.

412
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,002
That means he's got
acute thrombocytopenia.

413
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,394
Sounds poorly.

414
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:19,603
Keep me informed.

415
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,185
Nice of you to come along so promptly.

416
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,058
I want you to take a look
at these photographs.

417
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:48,532
Is the man you saw at Russell Square
tube station in any of these?

418
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,671
Like a cup of tea?

419
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:54,474
That one there.

420
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:57,673
And there.

421
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:04,549
Good. You're sure he was alive
when you left him?

422
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,013
How many times...

423
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,648
Are you certain he didn't come up after you?

424
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,390
- Yes.
- You mean he did?

425
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:12,552
He did not.

426
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,588
- Did you see anyone else down there?
- No.

427
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,700
I should think eight miles
would be sufficient.

428
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,034
- What?
- Fishing limits.

429
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,235
Thanks for coming along.

430
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:29,679
That's all?

431
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,842
Have you got something else to tell me?

432
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:45,984
I hope he'll be back soon.
You can never tell with the police.

433
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,030
Could you give him a message?

434
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,964
Tell him I'll meet him at the restaurant.
He knows which one.

435
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,034
That's cool.

436
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,303
Everything okay with you and Alex?

437
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:56,702
Yeah. Why?

438
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,138
- Just wondered.
- 'Bye.

439
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:16,636
- Want to see The French Connection?
- No, it's too violent.

440
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,802
- Would you like a cup of coffee, sir?
- Please.

441
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,711
If Manfred were so important,
why isn't there something in the papers?

442
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,511
- Maybe they put a D Notice on it.
- What's that?

443
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,677
If the government wants
something suppressed...

444
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,483
they ask the press not to publish it.
It's a D Notice.

445
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,884
Shades of home.

446
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,788
Alex, it's very strange.

447
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:42,427
You find something
in that book on poltergeists?

448
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,927
If he was so important,
why was he on the tube?

449
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,636
He would have had a Rolls and a chauffeur.

450
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,366
If it was a heart attack,
why wasn't it in the papers?

451
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:54,841
- I'd rather talk about poltergeists.
- Haven't you got any ideas?

452
00:56:56,646 --> 00:57:00,047
If this was Chicago,
they'd probably be dragging the river...

453
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,950
for some man with a concrete bowler hat.

454
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,222
Perhaps he was a spy
and the opposition caught up with him.

455
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,059
He'd seen something pretty awful.

456
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,797
I think we were lucky.

457
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,724
Why?

458
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,969
Whatever he saw was probably watching us.

459
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:30,207
What movie would you like to see?

460
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,611
- Speak.
- Inspector Calhoun?

461
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,580
No, it's A Man Called Ironside.

462
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,915
Evening, Inspector, Bacon here,

463
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:45,356
That blood. I've isolated the organism...

464
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,056
and checked it
with the medical research boys.

465
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,059
It's a form of pasteurella pestis,

466
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:54,801
I thought it might be.

467
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:59,632
That's plague.
In this case, septicemic plague.

468
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:03,341
- Sweet Jesus!
- It's not as bad as it sounds,

469
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,812
The occasional rat gets
into the country from a ship.

470
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,816
The rat carries the organism,
but the other rats...

471
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,947
the ones you normally find
in the sewers, kill it off.

472
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:13,550
That's the end of it,

473
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:17,786
What about the man who's got it?
Can he pass it on to anyone else?

474
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,156
No, he's harmless, poor devil.

475
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,322
So lavatory seats
down in the tube are still safe?

476
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,655
Probably.

477
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,500
I think he'd have to bite you.

478
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,229
Charming.

479
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,239
I hope he hasn't got a touch
of rabies as well.

480
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,878
You sound a bit strained.

481
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,941
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

482
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:40,942
Good night.

483
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,610
Bloody idiot. Get some sleep!

484
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:51,157
You still here, sir?

485
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:54,689
- Have you ever had pasturea pelvis?
- Who?

486
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,329
Septicemic bloody plague.

487
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,307
Come on, let's get a couple of pints of beer.

488
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,493
- We should have gone to the cinema.
- Your idea.

489
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,227
At least it was cheap.

490
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,304
Come on, we'll miss the last tube.

491
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,840
Come on. I'll protect you.

492
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:41,502
We can get out at Holborn instead
and walk the rest of the way.

493
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,578
Okay?

494
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,974
As I see it, James Manfred...

495
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,520
Give over about Manfred.
I'm stuffed up to the gills with him.

496
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,919
- I appreciate that...
- Open your mouth.

497
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,116
Now perhaps you'll shut up.

498
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:00,185
How much do you pick up in a week?
30 quid?

499
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,196
Hear that? 30 quid a week,
12-hour day, six-day week.

500
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,997
That's about eight and a tanner an hour,
old money.

501
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:12,599
The way he's carrying on,
he'll make it four and three.

502
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,073
Let's get pissed.

503
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:16,608
Scotch, doubles.

504
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,712
The night before Maggie died...

505
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,470
The coast is clear.

506
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,172
Think so?

507
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:47,142
You should always guard your rear.

508
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,976
- My books!
- I'll get them.

509
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,603
Mind the doors.

510
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:57,917
See you at home.

511
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,525
I got it.

512
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:17,834
Do you know this fella?

513
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,999
- Never seen him before.
- What's wrong with you?

514
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,043
We're closed, everybody's gone.

515
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,140
I'll handle this.

516
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:28,809
- What about another large Scotch?
- He's a very important gentleman.

517
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,579
You don't want me to lose my license?

518
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,588
I don't give bugger
whether you lose your license.

519
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:37,016
Are you aware it is an offence
to sell alcoholic beverages...

520
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:40,618
- on licensed premises after 11:00 p.m.?
- I am aware.

521
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,721
Allowing 10 minutes for drinking up time.

522
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,097
You've more than gone over that already,
I'd have you know.

523
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,867
You could be assisting us in our enquiries.

524
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,874
It's not the first time it's been done
over a glass of Scotch.

525
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,238
Come on, fellas.

526
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:58,040
- I'll cover up for you.
- No, sir.

527
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,479
You carry on with the game,
I'll sort this out.

528
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:04,679
I could have you down
for six months for this, you know that?

529
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:08,314
By the powers invested in me by virtue of...

530
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:11,182
- The Queen.
- God bless her.

531
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:17,459
Indeed, God bless her.
Don't you smile when you say that, either.

532
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,170
Are you aware that
Her Gracious Majesty is over there...

533
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:25,707
overseas in the far-flung empire,
helping to keep the world safe...

534
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:30,211
slogging her pretty little guts out
so as you can live in a democracy?

535
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,611
Look at this place.
A knocking shop, isn't it?

536
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:35,341
- Where did you get that coat?
- Off the chair.

537
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,885
Do you realize that is stealing by finding?

538
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:40,114
Any rough stuff, leave him to me.

539
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,487
What do you know
about stealing by finding?

540
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,686
You could have a year for that.
Unless you've got a record.

541
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:48,928
Listen, are you quite sure about the Scotch?

542
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:57,065
Have you ever seen Dartmoor?
You want to see Dartmoor from the inside?

543
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,504
There you go, then.

544
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,476
What time do you open up in the morning?

545
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,354
Is anybody there?

546
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:32,498
- What's all that about?
- Officer, I can explain. There might be...

547
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,833
- What's the matter?
- Someone may be trapped down there.

548
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,839
Somebody might not be, too.
What are you making a fuss about?

549
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,273
There is somebody. Is anybody there?

550
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,402
Calm down. Take it easy.

551
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,673
- Get out of my way.
- Come on, don't start.

552
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:48,682
Come along, now. I'll have to arrest you.

553
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:51,878
Look, I can explain...
Just give me a chance to explain.

554
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:55,424
We're going down to the station.
Come on, take it easy.

555
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,215
Good morning, sir.

556
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,591
Mr. Campbell, will you let me finish
reading the report?

557
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,034
- Anything else, sir?
- Beards!

558
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,239
- You've got to find her.
- This isn't a lost property office.

559
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,880
- What are you going to do?
- Don't know.

560
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:04,752
Breaking and entering public premises.
That's a very serious offence.

561
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:06,883
- Christ!
- Please don't shout.

562
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:10,248
I have an awful headache. Sit down.

563
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,593
Look, I know she's in trouble.

564
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:25,671
Why do you think she's in trouble?
Did you two have a fight last night?

565
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,637
She left her books...

566
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:32,874
I am reading the report, Mr. Campbell.
Unless you've something to add...

567
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,179
I suggest you go home
and leave us to get on with it.

568
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,346
Where the hell is Rogers?

569
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:39,810
Never mind.

570
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,122
You gone drag, Rogers?

571
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,418
- Where did you get that?
- A cleaner found it in Holborn Station.

572
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,120
That's Patricia's. She was there.

573
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:50,426
- I never doubted it for one moment.
- Then do something.

574
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,926
I can't do anything
with you shouting all the time.

575
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:55,765
Be a good lad and go home.

576
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,905
We'll call you if we need you.

577
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,174
- Inspector, Patricia...
- Hop it.

578
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,736
Now!

579
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,512
- There's blood inside it, sir.
- What?

580
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:16,215
There's blood inside the bag.

581
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,128
Get that down to Bacon right away.

582
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:40,882
Put me on to Mr. Richardson,
London Transport, CID.

583
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,200
Mind the doors.

584
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,566
It can't be that bad, son.

585
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,637
You can't solve your problems
by giving them to other people.

586
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,764
You youngsters are hopeless.
We've got schedules to keep up.

587
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:42,105
People can't jump onto the tracks.
Holds up the line for hours.

588
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:45,078
Is there any way out of here
except up those stairs?

589
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,240
It's drugs, isn't it? I had a nephew...

590
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:48,611
Is there?

591
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:50,742
You tell me!

592
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,981
I've been on this job
since the beginning, 40 years.

593
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,990
I worked for the city.
It's like a rabbit warren down there.

594
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,283
Mind the doors!

595
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:38,580
Mind the doors.

596
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,262
Mind the doors.

597
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:57,634
Mind the doors!

598
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:56,597
Doors.

599
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:08,041
Mind the doors.

600
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:02,957
Pat?

601
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:04,788
Pat?

602
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,333
Alex!

603
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,959
Patricia, is that you?

604
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,050
Are you all right?

605
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:09,226
Leave him.

606
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,320
Come on, let's go.

607
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:40,692
Who's there?

608
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:52,005
Good God! What is it?

609
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,271
What the hell's going on here?

610
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:56,838
Come on, what is it?

611
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,177
Manfred?

612
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:10,218
- Where?
- Down there.

613
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:12,653
You stay here.

614
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:14,921
Two of you stay
with this lady and gentleman.

615
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,123
The rest of you, come with me.

616
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:32,207
God, does this place stink.

617
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:36,683
Not surprising really, when you consider
it's been buried since 1892.

618
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,021
What was this place?

619
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:52,099
If it hadn't been for the cave-in,
it would have been a station.

620
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,363
But at the time,
it was a storage area and work base.

621
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,769
- And they just left it like this?
- There was no money.

622
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:01,740
- Don't you remember, I told you the story...
- Yes. Come on.

623
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:04,903
People were trapped in the cave,
the company went bankrupt...

624
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:56,794
All these generations have survived.

625
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:04,862
This one's alive.

626
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:17,778
Norton, keep an eye on things.

627
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,588
In here, sir.

628
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,595
- Manfred?
- Yes, sir.

629
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:40,574
Let's get to a radio phone.
I want everyone down here.

630
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:43,337
Photographers, the medical boys,
Bacon, everyone.

631
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,470
You look after it. Keep the press out.

632
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,247
What about Ml5, sir?

633
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:49,745
Yes, inform them.

634
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:53,720
James Manfred...

635
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,280
OBE.

636
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:09,029
I think he's dead, sir.

637
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,407
What a way to live.

638
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:20,572
You stay here. All of you, stay here.

639
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:03,286
- Get those kids out of here.
- Yes, sir.

640
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:25,301
Mind the doors!
