1
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,384
With purity in our hearts...

2
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,546
...with right thinking in our minds...

3
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:34,784
...we arm ourselves
with intolerance of all evil.

4
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,594
So it is, on this glorious
Sabbath morning...

5
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,098
...in this momentous year of 1 887...

6
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,669
...we naturally turn our thoughts
towards that way of life...

7
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:50,469
...as exemplified by Victoria,
our beloved queen.

8
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:55,205
For this week begins Her Majesty's
golden jubilee.

9
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:59,579
From her heart has come
an ever-increasing flow...

10
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,516
...of virtue and moral blessing.

11
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,147
She came upon a world sadly mired
in the ways of the flesh.

12
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,656
But during her reign, the forces of good
have achieved notable....

13
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,355
Stop. Stop.

14
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,592
What's wrong, dear?

15
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,201
--nor the season...

16
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,605
...we know that in God's own time
evil shall be wiped out by good.

17
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,336
Evil wiped out, eh?

18
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,845
You wanna take all the fun out of life?

19
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,007
Good old Beelzebub,
the boy with the horn!

20
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,814
--has taken root in a new goodness,
during these decades.

21
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,858
At the family hearth,
in the shops of industry that....

22
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,053
That the world moves forward today.

23
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,355
Blasphemy, l calls it...

24
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,833
...to talk that way
about a man's best friend.

25
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,670
Blasphemy!

26
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,676
-Did Parker go for a constable?
-Yes.

27
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,405
-Hello.
-Hello, governor.

28
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,243
You let me go back in there...

29
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,477
...and l'll tell them what a grown man
really thinks about.

30
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,112
-He been like this before?
-lt's gotten worse since the explosion.

31
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,885
-Shock? l see.
-You're a full-blooded young fella.

32
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,823
-You'll tell them.
-l thought if--

33
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,862
We know, don't we?

34
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,590
What's going on in here?

35
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,861
-Drunk and disorderly.
-Now, wait a minute, constable.

36
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,404
Take him to Camden Hospital.
Would you give that to Dr. Heath?

37
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:32,876
Better take him to the station. He's always--
Oh, Dr. Jekyll. Bats, is he?

38
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,514
Right, sir.
Camden Hospital it is, Dr. Jekyll.

39
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,708
-All right, me lovely. Upsy-daisy.
-Dr. Jekyll, eh?

40
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:43,083
Well, you go on, Dr. Jekyll, and try to put
old Beelzebub in his bottomless pit.

41
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,224
He'll show you!

42
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,956
Go back and be good, Dr. Jekyll!

43
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,370
-l must go to the hospital, sir.
-On a Sunday?

44
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,439
You mean that outrageous individual.

45
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,839
Harry says that Providence dropped
the man right into his lap.

46
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:43,813
-Well, but isn't this most unusual, my boy?
-l'm sorry, but it is, sir, most unusual.

47
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,847
Don't you dare be late
for the Marley dinner tonight.

48
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,649
And let you have a free rein
with all those men? l should say not.

49
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:02,198
-That's a silly little hat you've got on.
-l knew you'd like it.

50
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,632
There isn't anything about you l like.

51
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,503
All right, Jenkins.

52
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,840
l'm sorry.

53
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,276
-My dear, please.
-Sorry, Father.

54
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,614
Beatrix, l'm a very broad-minded man
but l do wish Harry...

55
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,121
...wouldn't make such demonstrations
of affection in public...

56
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:29,921
-...even if you are going to marry him.
-Now, Father darling, don't be pompous.

57
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,791
Good heavens, nibbling your knuckles.

58
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,267
l'll tell them what a grown man
really thinks about.

59
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,202
l can't allow it.
lt's a matter of ethics, Jekyll.

60
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,639
-Please, Dr. Jekyll, may l go in?
-No, not now, Mrs. Higgins.

61
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,780
Bear up.
That's how you can help.

62
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:58,314
lt's the greatest opportunity l've ever had.
The more l see it, the more l realize it.

63
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,358
My dear Jekyll, you know how
we all admire your work...

64
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,758
...and this case does come
within the scope of your research.

65
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,627
That's why l'd like to bow
to your opinion.

66
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,258
But as head of the staff
at this hospital, l cannot....

67
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:21,703
Listen, Jekyll, tell me straight out:
What could you do for this man?

68
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,783
l might have a chance of curing him.
l've been experimenting with animals.

69
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,819
But what works with animals
may not with a human being.

70
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,082
-Your chemicals may be deadly.
-Not one animal has died.

71
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,591
lt might. lt's too dangerous,
too far outside of known medicine.

72
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,993
-But l'm no witch doctor.
-Who's called you a witch doctor?

73
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,599
You told me yourself
it still had to be proved.

74
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:45,067
l can't allow you to experiment with--
Why, after all...

75
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,503
-...the man's a human being!
-You mean he was a human being...

76
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:53,407
...and he may be again, if you'd keep ethics
out of this! Sometimes we have to gamble.

77
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,309
Or haven't you the courage to face
the most daring--

78
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:01,112
Jekyll, l wouldn't talk these experiments
around very openly if l were you.

79
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,620
You're dealing with things
it would be better not to mention.

80
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,022
-There might be trouble.
-Trouble?

81
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,957
Trouble!

82
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,768
Harry, old boy, there are rumors of....
What's the matter?

83
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,465
-Don't worry, John, l'm leaving.
-Now, it can't be as bad as that.

84
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,702
John, my good friend, l realize
your Dr. Heath is right.

85
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,745
After all, we doctors can't
experiment on human beings.

86
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:32,681
Something might go wrong, and they'd
no longer believe in our medicine.

87
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,719
-Now, look here--
-But when l get proof, ethics or no--

88
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,049
l wanna be on hand, regardless.

89
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,100
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Just in time for tea, sir.

90
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,669
l'll be bound you had no lunch, sir.

91
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,832
Now, what about some nice
hot crumpets, sir, huh?

92
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,172
Of course, we mustn't spoil
our appetite for dinner tonight.

93
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:03,474
Miss Beatrix would be after me
properly if we did that, sir.

94
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:10,111
And besides, Mrs. Marley's butler tells me
that their new cook is really first-class, sir.

95
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,253
Sir, what about your tea, sir?

96
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,358
Shall l serve it down there, sir?

97
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,696
Now, look here, sir, you must have
something, you know.

98
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,821
Mrs. Marley, my deepest apologies.

99
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,928
You doctors.
l know we can never rely on you.

100
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:01,192
You know, l don't mind being scolded
by the smartest hostess in London.

101
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,393
-Dr. Jekyll, do sit over there.
-Thank you. Good evening.

102
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,939
Giles. Colonel. My special apologies
to you, Lady Colburn.

103
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,666
Pleasurer.

104
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,474
-Behaving yourself?
-No.

105
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:16,342
-A doctor's life, huh, Harry?
-The more patients, the colder the soup.

106
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,313
Actually, l got started on something
and lost track of time.

107
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,580
Oh, yes, Jekyll.

108
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:28,022
Heath was telling me that you're still
carrying on with that research work.

109
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:32,290
-Dr. Heath isn't in sympathy, Dr. Courtland.
-That's understandable, isn't it?

110
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:37,459
After all, separating the facets of the brain.
Rather ambitious, l should call that.

111
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,097
His research goes deeper than the brain into
something more intangible than the mind.

112
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:48,110
-Then all that seems to be left is the soul.
-All right, then, call it the soul.

113
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,474
The soul?

114
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,346
Come, come, my dear doctor.
Now you're invading my territory.

115
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,352
l suppose l am, but l know
that you wouldn't object...

116
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,854
...if science could be of help
to the church.

117
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,823
The church is always grateful
for any help, doctor.

118
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,555
Harry doesn't mean a word of this.
l'm afraid he's pulling our leg.

119
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:10,225
l should hope so. l was wondering what
Jekyll would do if l asked him to elaborate.

120
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,633
l don't mind elaborating.

121
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:17,674
lf you didn't see that poor chap in church
this morning, you heard him, l'm sure.

122
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,802
Thank you for your assistance.

123
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,540
-Hopelessly insane, obviously.
-l don't think he was insane.

124
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,685
l think there was only one side of him
expressing itself.

125
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,980
-Good heavens, which side?
-His evil side.

126
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,681
The man was spiritually distorted
through shock.

127
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,822
That explosion in the gas main last month.

128
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,327
Before that, he was a fine, solid citizen...

129
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,523
...kind with his children,
deeply in love with his wife.

130
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,226
Since then, he had undergone
a complete change...

131
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:48,066
...until this afternoon l found him
completely reverted to the animal.

132
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,266
We can clearly understand a shock
to the nervous system...

133
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,412
...but how does that affect the soul?

134
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,174
l think he was shocked
from normal good into complete evil.

135
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,744
When l say he was a good man,
l don't mean he hadn't had a bad thought.

136
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,017
Or that he hadn't committed ordinary
transgressions against society.

137
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,953
But, after all, that's the problem
of civilized man's soul, isn't it?

138
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,030
That good and evil are constantly
fighting one another?

139
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,760
There's a higher source from which
good can find aid in its fight.

140
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,198
l realize that, but--

141
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,932
The colonel and l have always felt that
a person can be good if they wish to be.

142
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:28,376
-And, well, otherwise if they don't.
-Jekyll, l simply must get this straight.

143
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,538
Well, let me put it this way:

144
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,208
Good and evil are so close as to be
chained together in the soul.

145
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:38,049
Now, suppose we could break that chain,
separate those two selves...

146
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:42,661
...free the good in man, and let it go to its
higher destiny and segregate the bad.

147
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,924
But aren't you a bit presumptuous
in assuming that there's evil in all men?

148
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:51,468
But isn't that true? Wouldn't we be
hypocrites if we didn't admit that?

149
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:56,165
After all, we've all had thoughts that we
didn't want published or shouted out loud.

150
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,210
And we certainly have had desires
that are not confined to a drawing room.

151
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,314
Why, as Christians, we admit
that man is created weak.

152
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,417
That's a perfectly honest problem.
Why don't we face it?

153
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:11,420
Suppose we believe that man's soul
has not yet reached its fulfillment.

154
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,923
ls it wise--? ls it right to tamper
with the problem...

155
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:19,360
...until the Creator himself has solved it
in his own mysterious way?

156
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,023
-Sir, l--
-Really, this is very disturbing.

157
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,931
Such theories come dangerously close to....

158
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,039
l hesitate to think what the medical
council would say--

159
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:33,304
Dr. Courtland, advanced theories are always
a sore point with the medical council.

160
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,381
Or even with the queen's physician,
if there's a comfortable profit...

161
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,644
-...in those already established.
-Jekyll!

162
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,348
lf you ask my opinion, young man,
this is pure balderdash.

163
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,059
-Ladies.
-l meant to ask:

164
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,993
Has anyone read that poem
by this new chap Oscar Wilde?

165
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,149
-Getting old, l suppose.
-Well, it's pretty late.

166
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,624
-We ought to--
-No. Come in and have a nightcap, John.

167
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,922
The rest of the company won't be bored.

168
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,860
Well, thank you, sir.

169
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,366
Look.

170
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,469
lt's the waltz that he and Mama
first danced together.

171
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,049
May l have this dance, Miss Beatrix?

172
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,645
Pleasure, Dr. Jekyll.

173
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,912
-Bea, darling.
-Harry.

174
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,848
l love you so very much, Bea.

175
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,250
Oh, Harry.

176
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:08,729
Tonight at dinner, l understood what you
said about the good and evil in people...

177
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,062
...and how it's that way in all of us.

178
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,533
But....

179
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,002
Well, why isn't...?

180
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,438
Why isn't the way you and l
feel about each other?

181
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,403
l mean, there's nothing evil
in that, is there?

182
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,448
-Do you think there is?
-No. No, Harry.

183
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:29,246
-Bea, we're in love, aren't we?
-Yes, we're very much in love.

184
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,446
That's all the difference.

185
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,359
Oh, my dear, John is looking
for a piece of music...

186
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,399
...THe Banks of LocH Lomond,
will you help him find it?

187
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,662
-Yes, Father.
-Thank you.

188
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,697
Harry....

189
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:53,139
l'm not one to brood, but you must have
noticed my concern in the carriage.

190
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,472
l just thought that--

191
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:58,912
That flight of fancy you put forth at dinner,
l must confess, it startled me.

192
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,247
Although l'm broad-minded myself,
it was a bit shocking too.

193
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,289
l'm sorry to hear you say that, sir,
because it was not a flight of fancy.

194
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:10,394
-You mean, you were in earnest?
-Profoundly, sir. As a matter of fact...

195
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,588
-...l hope to spend all of my time--
-This is distressing.

196
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,028
Why?

197
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,725
ln my opinion,
the whole thing's harebrained.

198
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,770
Well, l'm sorry to hear you
say that, sir. l--

199
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,466
You're a coming man in your profession.
l'm very proud of you.

200
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:29,376
But these ridiculous experiments won't get
you anywhere. You must give them up.

201
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,913
Develop your practice, cultivate the circle
in which you and Beatrix shall move.

202
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:38,648
Harry, my boy, l've always wanted a son,
and now you're going to be that.

203
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:43,056
Now, l've had my say. Let's have
your nightcap. lt's getting late.

204
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:48,228
And by the way, l've taken a box
for the opening concert at Albert Hall.

205
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,459
You'll join us, of course.

206
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,437
-So you and the old boy cross swords?
-Yes.

207
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:04,008
Seems l must discontinue my research,
spend my life diagnosing measles...

208
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:08,142
...mumps, and whooping cough
or encounter his serious disapproval.

209
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,654
Even l was surprised when you took
a Marley dinner party into your confidence.

210
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,919
You need not agree with me,
l just have a decision to make.

211
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,495
Harry, you and l
have been friends for years.

212
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,691
l can't agree with you, but that doesn't
make a difference to our friendship.

213
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,166
Let's drop into the club.
lt'll do you good.

214
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,271
Well, l'll walk that far with you.

215
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,177
Let me go! You thug! Let me go!

216
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,211
Help me! Help me!

217
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,221
Let him go. Let him go.

218
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,360
-You get a cab. l'll see what's happened.
-Yes.

219
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:00,630
A girl can't walk out with a chap.
Who does he think he is?

220
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,740
-The big--
-Did he hurt you?

221
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,308
lt'll take more than a bloke like that to....

222
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,623
Why, l bet l look ever so untidy.

223
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,990
You sure you're not hurt?

224
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,858
Why, l....
l don't think so.

225
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,671
-What is it? Your ankle?
-Yeah. lt's twisted.

226
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,240
Do you mind?

227
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,112
No, not at all.

228
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,614
-After all, an ankle can be very painful.
-You are ever so kind.

229
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:51,022
Me side too. He hit me.

230
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,351
Well, l should have caught him.

231
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,516
No, no.

232
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,184
l'm....

233
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,660
l mean, l'm so glad you stopped.

234
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,831
lf you take my meaning.

235
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,799
My friend is getting a cab.
Perhaps we could drop you somewhere.

236
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,104
-You're ever so kind.
-Shall we try it now?

237
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,179
There. That's a girl.

238
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:20,045
Gentlemen like you shouldn't be
bothering yourself about me.

239
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,944
Now, what sort of a gentleman
doesn't like to help a pretty girl?

240
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,089
Now.

241
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,456
And me with me hat all over me head.

242
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,554
So he asks me if he can
walk me home, he does.

243
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,668
Well, l turns around
to him, and l says, ''Yes.''

244
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,829
When a girl is out late, it's nice to have
a bit of company to see her home.

245
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,634
Naturally.

246
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,574
Well, l know what's what.

247
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,445
You have to if you are a barmaid.
l like a bit of fun, as the saying goes...

248
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,917
...but when a bloke grabs you
with nasty notions in his head...

249
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,454
...it's time to put your foot down.

250
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,886
l'm....

251
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,965
l'm sorry to bother you gentlemen.

252
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,464
Well, here we are.

253
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,249
-lt hurts more now.
-Does it?

254
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,752
-Can l give a hand, Harry?
-No, l think l can manage.

255
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,085
l'm so sorry.

256
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,759
-Night.
-Night.

257
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,166
Here?

258
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,776
The light's by the door,
if you have a match.

259
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,315
Right.

260
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,398
You better let down your blouse.

261
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,899
Why?

262
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,801
Well, you want me to have
a look at you, don't you?

263
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,474
l don't know.

264
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,546
You are looking, ain't you?

265
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,316
Well, how about your side?

266
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,321
Do you want to look at my side?

267
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,117
Well, don't you want me to?

268
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,508
You aren't half a fast one, aren't you?

269
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:06,117
l forgot to mention,
my friend and l are physicians.

270
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,279
Physi-- Physicians?

271
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,284
Doctors.

272
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,652
Doctors?

273
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,423
Oh, go on!

274
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,199
l thought you were a couple of toffs.

275
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,895
No, no. Haven't the leisure.

276
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:30,235
Oh, dear me.
And here l thought....

277
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:44,253
-Well, l'm glad to see you're not really hurt.
-But l am, doctor.

278
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,017
-Really.
-Maybe l better send you to the hospital?

279
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,352
No.

280
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,587
Look. Here. Feel.

281
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,390
-Feel.
-Where? Here?

282
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,593
Just as l thought: CirrHosis pectoris.

283
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,906
What's that mean?

284
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,339
That means your eyes
are twin pools of desire.

285
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,048
Oh, doctor.

286
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,718
That's nice.

287
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,682
The things you do say.

288
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,885
That doesn't hurt anymore, huh?

289
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,221
Oh, yes.

290
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,392
-Yes. Yes.
-You'll be all right in the morning.

291
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,192
Wait!

292
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,367
Wait.

293
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,033
My ankle.

294
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,769
Don't you think you ought
to look at that?

295
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,047
No.

296
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,847
No, your ankle's all right.

297
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:53,550
But l'll tell you one thing.
You wear your garter too tight.

298
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,821
-That stops the circulation. That's bad.
-There, you see?

299
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,123
You did find something.

300
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,028
You are my doctor, aren't you?

301
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,432
l ought to pay your fee, oughtn't l?

302
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,833
l haven't presented you with a bill yet.

303
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:16,647
How about this to begin with?

304
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,806
Not that it's enough.

305
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,611
lt's fine. lt's fine.

306
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,253
lt's much more than most people pay.

307
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,454
lt doesn't seem near enough to me.

308
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,429
Harry, listen--

309
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,030
Oh, sorry.

310
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,266
Come along, will you?
lt's getting late.

311
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,631
Well....

312
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,772
But....

313
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,508
But you aren't really going
just because he says?

314
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,446
No, no, no.
But l have to go now.

315
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,143
But look here.
Don't you understand?

316
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,084
l ain't no....

317
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,885
l ain't no....

318
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,193
No, l know you're not.
You're a girl with her heart...

319
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,422
...just where it ought to be.
Maybe a little too generous.

320
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,898
Because you're a nice, pretty girl,
next time be more careful...

321
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,934
...about the company you pick, huh?

322
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,267
Well, but....

323
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,907
But you are here, ain't you?

324
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,668
Yes, but l shouldn't be.

325
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,042
And if you really knew me,
you'd know l don't wanna be.

326
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,047
Well, l....

327
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,382
l picks only them
as wants my company.

328
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:34,047
-l'm sorry. lt was my fault.
-What you sorry about?

329
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,250
l am not.

330
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,593
Then let's just say
that we were foolish...

331
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,165
...and next time we'll drink
to one another's health.

332
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,099
l suppose it was all in fun
when you kissed me.

333
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,838
Yes.

334
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,733
lt wasn't all in fun then.
l know that.

335
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,254
Well, goodbye and good luck.

336
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,216
Come on, John. Don't be stuffy.

337
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,321
After all, the lady wasn't injured,
nor was anyone else.

338
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,016
l imagine she might be a tempting
morsel in an off moment.

339
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,889
-What do you mean, ''off moment''?
-Yours, according to your theory.

340
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,928
l imagine what l just witnessed...

341
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:51,432
...was the momentary triumph of the evil
in your soul over the good, huh? Correct?

342
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:57,235
Yes, yes. l don't think it was a triumph,
but it was an attack.

343
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,370
But one which would have been repulsed
even without your help, John.

344
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:05,277
Wouldn't you run less risk if you
confined your experiments to the lab?

345
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,452
That's where you'll find me
from tonight on...

346
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,622
...until l get what l'm looking for.

347
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,577
l'm worried, John.

348
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:51,347
-He ought to have let us know.
-He'll be along.

349
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:27,253
Maybe it's all for the best, Dr. Jekyll.

350
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,017
That wasn't my son in there.

351
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,856
lt was as if the evil one
had crept into his heart.

352
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,396
My poor Sam.

353
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,358
-Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home.
-Yes, sir.

354
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,368
-l'll walk.
-Oh, thank you, Dr. Jekyll.

355
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,972
-Thank you.
-Good night, Mrs. Higgins.

356
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,201
Good night, doctor. Good night.

357
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:54,818
-Hello, Dr. Jekyll. How are you?
-Good evening, Mr. Weller.

358
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,151
Just in time, sir.

359
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,187
Just locking up.

360
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,587
Wait half a moment until l fix this thing over
here, l'll walk up to the east gate with you.

361
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,929
Wonderful nights we're having, sir.

362
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,627
And don't you believe about this here comet
and the ''world coming to an end'' business.

363
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,329
lf you ask me,
it don't amount to a row of beans.

364
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,805
Newspaper talk, that's what l calls it.
Don't you believe it.

365
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:23,346
Just step down to Lloyd's and take out an
insurance policy and it won't cost you...

366
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,972
...more than it did last week when
there was no talk of a comet...

367
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,880
...or the world running into one.

368
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:33,615
Those are fellows that know what they're
talking about, sir. You take that from me.

369
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,383
Mr. Weller, here's a point.

370
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,496
lf you had a balloon that carried a man
to Mars and the pilot you picked...

371
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:43,657
...suddenly disappeared, would you
get in the balloon yourself and cast off?

372
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,268
A balloon?

373
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,303
Well, that's a good one, sir.
l think you got me there.

374
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:52,068
l don't know though. lf l had a balloon
that would take me there...

375
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:56,111
...and back, mind you, l don't know
that l wouldn't have a go at it.

376
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,045
Might get me away
from me mother-in-law for a while.

377
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,344
How's that for an answer, Dr. Jekyll?

378
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,956
Fair enough, Mr. Weller. Fair enough.

379
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,879
Yes?

380
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,782
What?

381
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,914
Oh.

382
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,318
Oh, no.

383
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,131
Can this be evil?

384
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,710
Dr. Jekyll.

385
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,951
Dr. Jekyll?

386
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,078
-What's happening, sir? Are you all right?
-What is it? What do you want?

387
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,881
ls that you, Dr. Jekyll?

388
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,924
Now, wait a minute.

389
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,361
Wait a minute, Poole.

390
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:22,137
Dr. Jekyll, who is that in there?

391
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,974
Dr. Jekyll, answer me, sir.

392
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,780
Yes, Poole?

393
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,350
l'm sorry, sir, but l....

394
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:12,046
l heard an odd noise and a strange voice.
l thought something was happening, sir.

395
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,851
No, no, no. lt's quite all right, Poole.

396
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,359
There was someone here.
A friend of mine.

397
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,962
A Mr. Hyde.

398
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,122
l let him out the back door.

399
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,631
Oh, l see, sir. Very good, sir.

400
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,498
Miss Beatrix is here, sir.

401
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,936
l showed her into
the consulting room, sir.

402
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,200
l hope l did right, sir.

403
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,510
Yes, yes, that was quite right, Poole.

404
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,879
Tell Miss Beatrix
l'll be there immediately.

405
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,218
Very good, sir.

406
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,475
Harry.

407
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,752
What are you doing here, Bea?

408
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:53,618
-Oh, Harry, then you're not....
-Not what?

409
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,790
Oh, l don't know.

410
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,852
l had the strangest feeling.

411
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,788
-l thought--
-Yes? You thought?

412
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,794
That you were going away...

413
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,965
...without ever seeing me again.

414
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,198
Well, why would l do that, Bea?

415
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,808
-l love you. Why....
-Oh, l know.

416
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,908
But l lost you for a moment, Harry.

417
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,510
-l was afraid.
-But you're not afraid now?

418
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,246
Of course not.

419
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,750
Well, you see that everything's all right...

420
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,617
...nothing has happened,
that l'm the same as l ever was?

421
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,850
Of course.

422
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,587
-lt must have been a dream.
-Yes, yes, a dream.

423
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,525
You're not angry with me?

424
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,563
Angry?

425
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,903
Oh, l don't want you to leave me. Ever.

426
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,504
Oh, darling.

427
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,834
l love you so much.

428
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,069
-Please don't send me away.
-No.

429
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,349
Yes, Father?

430
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:07,521
lt's a good thing l was worried about your
behavior tonight. l couldn't sleep myself.

431
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:12,499
Sir Charles, l know it's strange to find
Beatrix here but l want you to believe that--

432
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,470
All l can believe is that your ideas
are not normal, Jekyll, not fit--

433
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,734
Sir Charles, l asked Beatrix
to come here tonight because--

434
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,537
No, Harry.

435
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:26,046
Father, l know my being here is difficult
to understand, but l'm not ashamed.

436
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:31,044
Then, my dear, l shall be for you,
because l do understand.

437
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,391
We leave for the Continent
tomorrow on the boat train.

438
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,718
Father, please.

439
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,920
Oh, come, Sir Charles. After all,
you could eliminate all this difficulty...

440
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,531
...if you'd set an early date
for our marriage.

441
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,261
You don't understand. We're very much
in love. We wanna be together.

442
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,871
-We don't wanna wait any longer.
-Please, Father.

443
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,566
ln view of what's happened,
the engagement should be broken off.

444
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,509
However, l'll be lenient. We shall see you
on our return. Come, my dear.

445
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,548
Father, l've never
disobeyed you in my life.

446
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,678
But, Harry,
if you don't want me to leave...

447
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,220
...l'll refuse.

448
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,723
-Beatrix.
-l mean it, Father.

449
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,858
l don't want you to go, Bea...

450
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:18,331
...and l can't agree with your
father's decision, but l know...

451
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:23,439
...he's thinking of your happiness. l can't
argue against that and l can't ask you to.

452
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,235
That's highly commendable, Harry.

453
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,838
Will you see us off at the train?

454
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:35,076
Better have two engines.
l might try to hold it back.

455
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,316
Try. Try anyway.

456
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,177
A glass of sherry wine, sir?

457
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,841
No. No, thanks.

458
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:13,115
Well, would you consider
a letter from Monte Carlo, sir?

459
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,618
-l'll take the sherry wine too.
-Yes, sir.

460
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,728
Miss Beatrix should be returning home
soon now, shouldn't she?

461
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,892
Yes. Yes, Poole.

462
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,965
Hobson was telling me
that they were expected.

463
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,555
Bad news, sir?

464
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,432
Miss Beatrix and her father
are going to Aix-les-Bains.

465
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,361
Oh, l'm sorry, sir.

466
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,472
Sir Charles' health, no doubt?

467
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,041
Yes, yes.

468
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,045
Yes, Sir Charles' health, no doubt.

469
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:21,617
lf you'll forgive me, sir,
it upsets me to see you like this.

470
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,453
lt isn't right.

471
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,460
All work, as the saying goes, sir.

472
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:31,893
They say there's a very interesting
musical show at the vanity fair, sir.

473
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,230
Very comical, you know, sir.

474
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:40,207
And very daring,
if you follow my meaning, sir.

475
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,213
Yeah, l follow your meaning, Poole.

476
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:49,682
But l don't think it would be wise,
even though it is comical.

477
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,354
Quite so, sir.

478
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,720
-l'll fetch you another glass, sir.
-Oh, never mind, Poole.

479
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:35,612
Thanks for the pay, sir.
Hey, hey, hey!

480
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,017
Here. What's the idea, governor?

481
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,885
Oh, l beg your pardon, sir.

482
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:54,636
Yes, sir?

483
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:58,105
Box F, sir. Right this way.

484
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,640
Now, all together, boys.

485
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,505
Two pints.

486
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,903
Oh, oh.

487
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,705
A tip. A tip, of course.

488
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,644
Seven shillings, sir? Why....

489
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,253
-Why not? You work hard, don't you?
-Yes, sir. Bless you, sir.

490
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:55,357
-You have a family, no doubt.
-Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you.

491
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,057
-Did you hurt yourself?
-What the--?

492
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,492
Oh, what a pity.

493
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,156
You were thinking of the children,
no doubt?

494
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,802
Now, have that barmaid
bring me some champagne.

495
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:11,202
-lvy ain't allowed to leave the bar.
-l don't think you understood what l said.

496
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,538
-What's all this here?
-This gent here wants champagne, sir.

497
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:17,145
Champagne?
All right, then, bring it, bring it.

498
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,806
-But he wants lvy to serve it.
-Of course lvy will serve it. Go on.

499
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,747
Look lively.

500
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:28,786
A gent in box F wants you to serve him,
and Old Prouty says you're to do it.

501
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,450
Oh, he does?
l'll tell him it ain't my business.

502
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,596
But he wants a bottle of the boil.

503
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:37,165
Oh, bubbly. Why didn't you say so?

504
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:41,395
Hey, lvy, me love, how about some
fish and chips after the show?

505
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:45,200
How about a dozen oysters
and a pint of stout?

506
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,275
What about a glass of champagne?

507
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,642
-Oh, hello, Marcia.
-Hello, lvy.

508
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:58,952
Watch out, lvy.

509
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,249
How's about it, lvy?

510
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,254
Over there, lvy.

511
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,622
Ain't she a bit of horseflesh?

512
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,919
Well, that'll....

513
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,793
That'll be half a quid, sir.

514
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,298
Half a quid?

515
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,894
Yes, sir.

516
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,136
Half a quid.

517
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,073
Here.

518
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,302
Here's a sovereign, my dear.
Keep the change.

519
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,770
Thank you, sir.

520
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:02,279
Oh, but you're not going?
Oh, no. No.

521
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,012
After all, you brought two glasses.

522
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,713
Two minds with but a single thought.

523
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,984
My, what a nice beginning.

524
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,152
Sit down there.
Sit right down.

525
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,389
Well, l....

526
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,999
Well, l'll just take a sip.

527
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,797
-Of course, l shouldn't stay too long.
-Oh, nonsense. Nonsense.

528
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,735
You can stay as long as you like.

529
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,705
After all, we have all evening,
haven't we?

530
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,573
Of course we have. Here.

531
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,610
There.

532
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,277
Oh, l like your singing.

533
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:38,387
Yes. You must sing again
for me sometime.

534
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,655
Where did you get such a pretty voice?

535
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,328
Well, l don't know.

536
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:53,197
-l just--
-Perhaps it's the pretty place it comes from?

537
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,870
-Well--
-Very lovely, where it comes from.

538
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,534
-Well, here's health so good luck.
-l make my own luck, my dear.

539
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:04,872
Yes, and tonight l follow the rainbow.

540
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:11,982
Oh, you don't half talk, do you?

541
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,385
Perhaps we could follow it together?

542
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:18,494
-l'll follow it right home, mister.
-To that rattrap?

543
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:22,894
-Hey, what are you calling names?
-Well, l think you deserve something better.

544
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,195
How do you know where l live?

545
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:29,169
Well, l can imagine.

546
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:33,776
Surely your wages here
don't earn you a place in Barkley Square.

547
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,247
Well, l think l'll be off.

548
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:45,412
Why? l don't confuse you, do l, lvy?

549
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,251
l believe l do confuse you, don't l?

550
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:52,224
l ain't confused by nobody.

551
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,554
Let go. Do you hear?

552
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,004
Let go.

553
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:13,739
Let go, you hear?

554
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,511
-What's he doing, lvy?
-Oh, you let go too!

555
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,654
Watch out, lvy love.

556
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,716
-Here, here. What's this all about?
-lt's him. He insulted her.

557
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,690
-He's lying, l tell you!
-He tried to break her arm.

558
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,729
-He did, did he?
-Yes, yes. Tried to break her arm.

559
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,966
You will? You want another one?

560
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:41,405
No! No! Stop it! Stop it!

561
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,102
l'll stop it, sir.

562
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,807
Hey, boys! Now, boys!
Boys, will you--?

563
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,105
l can't understand what happened.
Never a rumpus here.

564
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,263
Most orderly.

565
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:15,337
lt's that girl, lvy, that barmaid.
Pretty girls always cause trouble.

566
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:20,176
-l'd throw her out if l were you.
-What? lvy? l can't do that to lvy.

567
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,513
A great man can always
change his mind...

568
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,587
...for a reason.

569
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,189
Yes, sir. Why, certainly, sir. Yes, sir.

570
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,883
A troublemaker, that's what she is.
Out she goes.

571
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:34,030
Yes, but now,
while the evening is still young.

572
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:37,325
-Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
-Yes, certainly.

573
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:43,065
What happened? l've done nothing.
Just minding my own business.

574
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,707
-That's my decision, my girl.
-Stop pushing!

575
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,207
-Don't hang about here.
-Who's hanging about?

576
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:51,814
-Go on. Don't argue the point.
-Oh, good riddance.

577
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,848
What's happened in there?

578
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,424
-ls there some trouble, lvy?
-Trouble? l was sacked, that's what!

579
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,084
How fortunate l'm here.
l'd like to help you.

580
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:09,698
Let me back in there so l can bash him
on the nose, that's all!

581
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,929
Quite the little Tartar, aren't you?
Always ready to flare up. Oh, l like that.

582
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:21,237
Here, here. This is just to prove
that l want to help you.

583
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,325
The rainbow is wide and long, lvy.

584
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:45,701
-Oh, now wait. l better get home.
-No, no, no.

585
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:52,235
lvy, my darling,
you belong with the immortals.

586
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,138
Come with me to Mount Olympus.

587
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:58,007
Drink nectar with the gods.
Sing the ancient songs of pleasure.

588
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,241
And put Athena and Diana to shame.

589
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,950
Oh, you aren't half of one
with the words, aren't you?

590
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:10,690
And don't be frightened
of me, will you, lvy?

591
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,854
When a botanist finds a rare flower,
he shouts his triumph, doesn't he?

592
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,059
Are you one of them?

593
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:23,467
You like a man who sees a girl
and makes up his mind, don't you?

594
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,267
l don't know what you're talking about.

595
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:32,541
Oh, she doesn't know
what l'm talking about.

596
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,248
-Please, sir.
-But you'll find out, won't you?

597
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:42,516
-Please.
-You'll find out what it means.

598
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:43,748
Please, sir.

599
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,258
The London Post, Sir Charles.

600
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,992
Oh, thank you.

601
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:55,535
And one for you, mademoiselle.

602
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,624
What does Harry have to say
this morning, my dear?

603
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,990
l said, what does Harry say this morning?

604
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,394
Oh, nothing much.

605
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:26,296
l'll wager my gout hurts him
more than it does me.

606
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,967
Does he send any news l can hear?

607
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:34,633
Oh, he just says that he walked
through the East End recently.

608
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:40,282
''l have never seen such deplorable
housing conditions.

609
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,681
Surely the city fathers
should find the funds to....''

610
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,389
Well, then he just goes on to say
about the housing conditions.

611
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,355
They must be pretty dreadful.

612
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:55,360
Yes, he's quite right. They're disgraceful.
l was just saying at the club before l left.

613
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,729
Now, there's a problem
Harry could get his teeth into.

614
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,733
He's just the man to....

615
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,335
Here, here, my dear. What's wrong?

616
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,270
Nothing.
l suppose l'm just not very interested...

617
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,934
...in housing conditions at the moment.

618
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,809
You mean because a man doesn't cover
the pages with sentiment? Nonsense.

619
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,283
A woman must learn to read
between the lines, my dear.

620
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,082
Yes, l like the tone of that letter.

621
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:26,188
And what's more, my dear, l think my gout
is getting very, very much better.

622
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,520
-Oh, hello, Marcia.
-Are you here alone?

623
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,155
Yes, yes. l just made some tea.
Come and have a cup.

624
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:08,600
Not me, nor you either. We ain't got time.
Get dressed, we're going out.

625
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:13,333
Freddie's got a young brother from Oxford.
They want another girl to make it a quartet.

626
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,174
He's a bit of all right too.

627
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,144
And we're going to the Empire.

628
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:22,250
-The Empire?
-Yes. Oh, it's ever so gay there, lvy...

629
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:26,184
...and the show is grand.
lt's just where all the toffs go.

630
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:33,092
-No, l don't think so, Marcia.
-Why not?

631
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,890
l just don't feel like it. That's all.

632
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,431
You ain't afraid to go, are you?

633
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,462
Afraid?

634
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:45,436
-Why should l be afraid?
-Oh, l don't know.

635
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,132
l just thought....

636
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,005
Well, l ain't afraid of nobody.

637
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,942
But you ain't been out
for ever so long, have you?

638
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:55,414
-No, but--
-He ain't your lord and master, is he?

639
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:56,745
l should say he ain't.

640
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:59,854
Or is it because you ain't
got a nice enough dress?

641
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:04,686
Of course l have.

642
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:07,853
What are you standing there for, then?
Go and put it on.

643
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,127
All right.

644
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:18,334
What's that across your back?

645
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:21,806
What? There's nothing.

646
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,111
Did he do that to you?

647
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,547
-Let me see.
-No. No.

648
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:32,577
lt ain't nothing.

649
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,421
-l just--
-So that's your fine friend, is it?

650
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,115
The dirty, filthy brute!

651
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:40,057
lf ever a man dared lay a hand
to me like that, l'd--

652
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,763
Well....

653
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:49,998
Aren't you going to introduce
me to our charming visitor?

654
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,007
lt's Marcia.

655
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,907
This is my friend, Mr. Hyde.

656
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,547
You've heard me speak
about him, haven't you?

657
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:06,178
Oh, yes, Marcia.
l've heard a great deal about you.

658
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,653
l've never been interested.

659
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,019
Until now.

660
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,460
l've got to be toddling along now.

661
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,466
-Toodle-loo, lvy.
-Oh, no, no.

662
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,398
Don't go now, Marcia.

663
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:26,702
After all, this could be very interesting,
the three of us in friendly discussion.

664
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,840
l can't keep my friend waiting.

665
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:32,412
-l'll be dropping by, lvy.
-Yes, yes, yes.

666
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:36,675
Drop by sometime when l'm here, Marcia.

667
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,087
Your ideas differ from mine.

668
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:44,220
lt would be a charming
experience to change them.

669
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,724
lvy found it that way.
Didn't we, dear?

670
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,634
Nice material.

671
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,569
Goodbye.

672
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:15,784
Very nice material.

673
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,669
Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?

674
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,337
Oui. Yes, sir.

675
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,634
That's what frightens you, isn't it?

676
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,711
Why...

677
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,746
...no, sir, l....

678
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,052
You're afraid l'll become
interested in Marcia.

679
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,620
Why...

680
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:49,189
...well, if you--
lf you want to--

681
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:50,757
What?!

682
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:52,394
What?!

683
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,097
You're not very clear.

684
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,000
Well, sir, l....

685
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:04,161
Oh. Oh, you poor child.

686
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,470
l'm such a tease, aren't l?
Such a tease.

687
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,307
Yes, sir.

688
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:19,349
What a lucky man l am
to be loved this way.

689
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:27,653
But supposing l did have
to leave you for a while?

690
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:31,395
Leave, sir? When?

691
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:34,798
l'm not saying when,
l said ''suppose.''

692
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,099
Well....

693
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:43,236
Supposing l had to take a trip
from time to time?

694
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:44,902
You....

695
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,447
You mean...soon?

696
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,009
Well, now, l don't know.

697
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,117
Oh, you mustn't look so worried.

698
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:59,992
lt won't be for a long, long time.

699
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,495
Oh, l see.

700
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,428
So we won't think
about it now, will we?

701
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:08,763
No, sir.

702
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,435
When l do go, it will break
your heart, won't it?

703
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,269
Yes, sir.

704
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,487
Well....

705
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,622
What would my little cherub
like to do this evening?

706
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,362
Oh, sir, could we go out?

707
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:38,466
Out? You mean gad about a bit,
see the sights?

708
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,296
Yes, sir. Oh, you'd like it,
wouldn't you, sir?

709
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:45,270
Well, now, l don't know. l don't know.
That might be very charming.

710
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,772
Where would we go?

711
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,343
Oh, they say that the Empire
and such places--

712
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,309
They do? Who does?

713
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,914
Well, Marcia, sir.
She says it's ever so gay.

714
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:56,483
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

715
01:05:57,086 --> 01:05:58,815
We can go, can't we?

716
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:01,957
They say that the bill
is ever so good.

717
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:07,724
And l haven't been out for so long.

718
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:11,094
No. No, that's right.
You haven't, have you?

719
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,827
You do look a little pale.

720
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:17,632
Yes. Yes, that's true.
Not that l am complaining, you understand--

721
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,469
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. l understand.

722
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,873
You're just nervous and jumpy, that's all.

723
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,808
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, yes.

724
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,814
You have that cooped-up feeling.

725
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:30,381
Yes. You do understand, don't you?

726
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:31,747
-Yes, yes.
-Well, then--

727
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,890
Well, now, where would we go?

728
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:40,088
We might go to Albert Hall.

729
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:44,130
Yes. And hear a symphony.

730
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,228
Albert Hall, sir?

731
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,664
Well, l sort of hoped that....

732
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,038
What makes you say...?

733
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:00,241
So you'd like to go out, huh?

734
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,045
Yes, sir.

735
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:07,983
l'll go and put my things on.

736
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,586
Don't hurry.

737
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,996
Because we're not going.

738
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,556
Sir?

739
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:22,662
The bill is ever so good right here.

740
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:46,459
Now, let's see, what shall we do?

741
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,029
We could play cards.

742
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:04,744
But you're probably tired
of cards, aren't you?

743
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:14,178
You might read to me.

744
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,482
Yes.

745
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:20,217
Yes.

746
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:24,127
Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice.

747
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,337
But we haven't the book, have we?

748
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:42,049
And l don't suppose you know it
from memory, do you?

749
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:44,883
l know.

750
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:48,013
l know what we like.

751
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,297
You must sing for me.

752
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:06,704
No. Oh, no, not that.

753
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:08,036
-Why not?
-Not that.

754
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,438
Not in good voice?

755
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:12,547
-lt isn't that, sir, but--
-But it's such a pretty song.

756
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,945
-Please, not tonight.
-Yes. Sing it gaily.

757
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:18,382
-l can't! Truly, l can't!
-Sing it with deep compassion then.

758
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,681
Or loving kindness even.

759
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,518
-Sing it moodily, sing it with--
-l can't!

760
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,786
You hear me? Sing it! Sing it!

761
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:45,074
Smile when you sing! Be happy! Be gay!

762
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,511
That's it!

763
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,654
That's it! That's it! That's it!

764
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,662
That's it!

765
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:05,928
Bravo! A prima donna is born!

766
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,569
Let's shower her with orchids!

767
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,004
The world is yours, my darling.

768
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,303
The moment is mine.

769
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,119
And l says to the wife, l says:

770
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:28,154
''Look here, my girl,
if you think the world is....''

771
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,781
Good morning, sir.

772
01:10:57,419 --> 01:11:00,388
How about a nice hot cup of tea, sir?

773
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:01,955
No. No, thanks, Poole.

774
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:05,423
Would you consider a telegram
from foreign parts, sir?

775
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,225
And a nice cup of tea as well, sir, huh?

776
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:11,559
l know it's good news.

777
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:15,192
Hobson told me last night that they
were expected home today, sir.

778
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:18,465
This is a great day for us,
if you'll forgive me saying so.

779
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:22,634
Soon be back to our regular meals,
regular hours, regular ways, sir.

780
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:25,336
-Your breakfast will be ready soon, sir.
-Poole.

781
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:31,949
Put on your hat and coat and take an
envelope to the district messenger office...

782
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:35,249
-...to be delivered by hand.
-Very good, sir.

783
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:27,299
lvy. lvy, dear, it's me.

784
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:38,551
-Oh, Marcia. Hello.
-Hello, lvy.

785
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,655
l didn't hear you. Hello, Fred.

786
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,885
Hello, lvy.

787
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,661
Get yourself a drink, Fred.

788
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:51,764
-l'll make some tea.
-We don't want anything.

789
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,062
Yes, but....

790
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,577
Don't bother about us, lvy, dear.

791
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,679
-Oh, Marcia!
-Oh.

792
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,557
For Miss lvy Peterson.

793
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,896
Thanks, governor.

794
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,781
Look.

795
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,287
Fifty pounds.

796
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:53,687
There ain't no letter.
You don't suppose it's from him?

797
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,989
He must have sent it for what he's done.

798
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:59,362
No, not him. He's too mean, he is.

799
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,532
Oh, l don't know.

800
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,939
l wouldn't put it past him.

801
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,284
Yes.

802
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,319
Yes, that's it.

803
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:25,126
Hopes l'll use it to try and run away.

804
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:29,520
Oh, l can see him thinking it up, l can.

805
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:34,427
And then, then he'll follow me.

806
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:38,869
And just when l think that
l've got free, he'll....

807
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,804
l can't stand it anymore.

808
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,208
l can't stand it.

809
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:50,040
Oh, if l could only do it...

810
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:53,453
...l'd go down to the river.

811
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,959
Oh, lvy.

812
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,857
lt's her nerves, that's what.
She ought to see a doctor.

813
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:10,099
There's a copy of the Winged Victory.
The real one's in the Louvre in Paris.

814
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,069
l know because l saw it there.

815
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,301
What's the sense of being victorious
if you haven't a head?

816
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:18,935
What's the sense of my taking a trip,
acquiring art and culture...

817
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,309
...if you're not going to pay attention?

818
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:24,941
You're back here.
That's the only victory that counts.

819
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,611
That's why l was deluged
with all those letters.

820
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,381
-Bea, now look--
-Oh, l know.

821
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:33,892
But if l ever go away again and you
don't write just because you're ill....

822
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:37,992
Oh, don't you see how much more
worried that would make me?

823
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:40,724
lt all amounts to this.

824
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:45,636
But February is still a long way away,
and your father will simply have to listen....

825
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:51,972
lf you don't stop looking at me like that,
l won't be responsible for what happens.

826
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:57,641
-Aren't public places awful sometimes?
-Awful.

827
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:00,879
-May l interrupt this loud conversation?
-Oh, here you are.

828
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,514
Sir Charles, glad to see you.
Sorry you weren't in. You look fine.

829
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:07,389
lt's nice to be back.
You're looking well yourself.

830
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,498
Sorry to be late, my dear.
ln an argument at the club.

831
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:11,860
What's on the program?

832
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,730
l thought we'd go to Stewart's,
if that's agreeable.

833
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:18,270
Excellent! But, while it's
on my mind, Harry...

834
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,704
...there's something we must
straighten out.

835
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,401
l've gone through enough
with Beatrix over this.

836
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:27,543
l may be getting old and crotchety,
but l won't put up with it anymore.

837
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:31,049
l'm afraid you must take her
off my hands as soon as possible.

838
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,683
Oh, Father!

839
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,652
Well, Sir Charles, that's--

840
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:38,088
Of course, l insist on all the trimmings:

841
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,058
Wedding at St. Margaret's,
Bishop Manners, reception.

842
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,591
Yes, sir, Sir Charles. l'd--

843
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:47,633
Well, show her you're happy about it.
Do something, man.

844
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,439
Just another work of art, madam.
lt's not in your catalog.

845
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,582
We're feeling rather gay, are we, sir?

846
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:08,518
Poole, old friend, l'm going
to be married very soon.

847
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,954
Sir, you don't know how
happy that makes me.

848
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,219
l knew it would, Poole.

849
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:15,459
Thank you.

850
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:20,097
Sir, there's a patient in the
consulting room, a Miss lvy Peterson.

851
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,504
She's without an appointment.
lf you've no time, l can--

852
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:26,266
No, no, that's all right. l'll see her.

853
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:22,730
So it's you, sir.

854
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,329
So you are the famous Dr. Jekyll.

855
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,468
Well....

856
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:34,237
l'm the one you and your friend
took home that night.

857
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:36,736
-Remember?
-Well, what...

858
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,540
...what brings you here, Miss Peterson?

859
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,342
-l think....
-Are you ill?

860
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,724
There.

861
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,254
That's what.

862
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,360
Look at that.

863
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:01,864
Pretty, ain't it?

864
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,600
Did you ever see a thing
like that before?

865
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,475
l'll get you some lotion.

866
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:10,270
Lotion?

867
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:14,081
lt won't be lotion that will
do the trick, sir.

868
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:17,050
lt's more than that. l need help.

869
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:19,752
l can't stand it anymore.

870
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,258
lt's Hyde, sir.

871
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:25,949
lt's a man l know, Mr. Hyde.

872
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:29,825
lt's him that's done it and more.
More l can't tell you.

873
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,891
He ain't a human. He's a beast.

874
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,231
And he won't let me go, sir,
and l am afraid to run away.

875
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:45,777
Marcia, she's my girlfriend,
and Freddie, that's her friend, they...

876
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:49,383
...they say it's my nerves,
and that you know about such things.

877
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,415
And that you could help me.

878
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,454
Oh, l can't bear up under it no more!

879
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:05,826
lf you can't help me...

880
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,926
...give me some poison
so l can kill myself.

881
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:14,937
Why didn't you try to get help before?
Why didn't you go to the police?

882
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,475
l tell you, l'm afraid.

883
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,078
No...

884
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,508
...he ain't a man.
He's a devil, he is.

885
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:25,119
He knows what you're thinking about.

886
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:27,778
lf he knows l'm here,
who knows what he'll do.

887
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:30,652
lt won't be nothing human,
l can tell you!

888
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:38,198
Oh, please. Please help me keep him off.

889
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,465
l'll do anything you ask, sir.

890
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:51,177
l ain't as bad as you might think.

891
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:54,814
Well....

892
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,718
Men say that l....

893
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:01,752
l ain't a bad looker
when l'm more myself.

894
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:07,693
You liked me once a little, didn't you?

895
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:10,930
Really, you....

896
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:14,262
You're such a fine and kind gentleman.

897
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:18,528
Honest, that night,
when you walked out of my place...

898
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:22,576
...l made as if l didn't care.

899
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,442
l did care.

900
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:30,609
After you'd gone,
l kept wishing you'd come back.

901
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:32,218
Truly, l did.

902
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:47,360
This man, Hyde, will never
trouble you again.

903
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:50,596
l give you my word.

904
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:51,932
How do you know?

905
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:54,507
He'll come back!
He'll come back and kill me!

906
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:58,271
No. He won't come back.

907
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:00,610
l'll see to it.

908
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:04,317
Oh, you don't know him, sir.

909
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,487
Oh, you don't know him.
He ain't human, he ain't!

910
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,954
l gave you my word.

911
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,787
You'll never see Hyde again.

912
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,423
You must believe me.

913
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,865
l believe you, sir.

914
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,000
l believe you.

915
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,379
You must go now.

916
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:33,972
Yes, sir.

917
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:37,344
Yes, sir.

918
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:02,375
For a moment, l thought....

919
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:10,208
Goodbye.

920
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:22,556
l'm sorry, l shouldn't have
admitted such a person.

921
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,460
l didn't know she was hysterical.

922
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,930
That's all right.
l'm glad you admitted her.

923
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:29,866
Now, about the wedding,
we've got a lot to discuss.

924
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:32,939
-We've never been married before.
-Let's not get upset.

925
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,473
We'll manage it somehow.

926
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:39,078
-Good evening, Mr. Weller.
-Good evening, Dr. Jekyll.

927
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,647
A touch of autumn in the air.
Very seasonable.

928
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:44,341
-Wonderful, Mr. Weller, wonderful.
-Listen here.

929
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,783
Remember that comet
l was telling you about?

930
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:49,355
The blooming thing
didn't hit us after all.

931
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:50,855
-You know why?
-No. Why?

932
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,620
Because it knew at this moment,
across the park...

933
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:57,196
...Sir Emery is going to announce
the marriage of his daughter...

934
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:00,163
-...to the very man you're talking to.
-Dr. Jekyll!

935
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:03,065
And my best wishes to
the Mrs. Jekyll as is to be.

936
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:05,206
Thank you. You don't mind if l hurry?

937
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:08,274
-Godspeed, Dr. Jekyll.
-Thank you, Mr. Weller!

938
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:40,827
Oh.

939
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:03,276
Here's hoping that Hyde rots...

940
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:05,612
...wherever he is.

941
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:11,088
Burn slow when the time comes.

942
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:23,599
Here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll
thinks of his lvy...

943
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:27,868
...as l know he'd like to.

944
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,945
As his lvy thinks of him.

945
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:37,549
Because he's an angel.

946
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,384
Here's to my angel.

947
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,920
Surprised?

948
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:17,347
Couldn't be that you
didn't expect to see me?

949
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,093
No.

950
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:23,024
l've been....

951
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:24,596
l've been waiting for you.

952
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:28,591
But you've been celebrating.
ls there some new event, some change?

953
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:31,870
No.

954
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:34,969
No. l just thought--

955
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,805
You've just been drinking
to calm your nerves, huh?

956
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:42,245
lt is your nerves, isn't it?
Perhaps you should see a doctor.

957
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:46,709
No.

958
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,990
No, l don't need a doctor.

959
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:55,854
Would you like to have some wine, sir?

960
01:28:56,864 --> 01:28:59,196
l'll get you another glass.

961
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:07,366
Dr. Jekyll's a good man.
Yes, Dr. Henry Jekyll.

962
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:10,477
-ls he?
-Yes. Yes.

963
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:14,877
And a fine gentleman too.
Different than any man you might know.

964
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:17,415
Yes. Yes.

965
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:22,784
''A nice, fine gentleman like yourself, sir,
wouldn't be knowing such a person.'' No.

966
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:27,792
''l ain't such a bad looker, sir,
when l'm more myself.'' Yes.

967
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:31,363
He's the kind of man you can
get down on your knees to, isn't he?

968
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:35,491
A sweet, dear, pure man
that you can trust and believe.

969
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:38,366
He's a smug, hypocritical coward,
that's what he is!

970
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:40,973
-You couldn't know him!
-l know him intimately.

971
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:42,803
And l detest him intimately...

972
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:46,003
...from his lofty brain to
the soles of his virtuous feet!

973
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:50,082
And you, you....
''l'll do anything you ask, sir.''

974
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:53,379
Well, you saw him, didn't you?
You saw the respectable fool.

975
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:56,751
Clutched his halo and held
it straight, didn't he!

976
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:58,857
How do you know all that?

977
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:00,960
l know everything you do and think.

978
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:03,825
Dr. Jekyll wouldn't tell you.
He ain't the kind of--

979
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:07,798
And as you were leaving the room,
you turned at the door, didn't you?

980
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:11,530
And you said,
''For a moment, l thought....''

981
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:14,971
What did you think?
What did you think?

982
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:17,941
Did you think Dr. Jekyll
was falling in love with you?

983
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:21,448
You, with your cheap little dreams?

984
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:26,809
Or did you think, perhaps...

985
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:30,651
...that in him, you saw
a bit of me, Hyde?

986
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:38,564
Oh, but it confuses you, doesn't it?

987
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:41,896
lt isn't quite clear, is it?

988
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:45,033
Oh....

989
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:47,230
What are you going to do?

990
01:30:47,508 --> 01:30:50,477
Something so simple.

991
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:55,315
l'm going to put an end
to all that confusion.

992
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:09,919
Please, sir!
Oh, no!

993
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:12,497
Please, no!

994
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:16,964
Yes, dance.

995
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:19,129
Dance and dream.

996
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:22,743
Dream that you're Mrs. Henry Jekyll
of Harley Street...

997
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:26,346
...dancing with your own butler
and six footmen.

998
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:32,384
Dream they've all turned into white mice
and crawled into an eternal pumpkin.

999
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:40,785
Here, you in there!
Open this here door!

1000
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:48,902
Police!

1001
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:54,564
-lvy!
-l'm going in.

1002
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:56,403
Governor!

1003
01:31:57,879 --> 01:31:59,471
Ho, there!

1004
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:09,316
Hey, you there!

1005
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:10,650
Look here, governor.

1006
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,851
-Steady! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Police!

1007
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:16,396
Chase him, somebody!
Get a copper!

1008
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:19,829
Police! Hurry.

1009
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:06,136
Come on, open up!
Let me in. l'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.

1010
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:08,714
-Dr. Jekyll's not home.
-He told me to wait.

1011
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:11,283
-l know all Dr. Jekyll's friends.
-Let me in!

1012
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:14,751
-You'll have to come back.
-Let me in, or l'll bash this door--

1013
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:17,891
lf you don't go away,
l'll have to send for the police!

1014
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:13,272
That's him!
There he goes!

1015
01:34:13,447 --> 01:34:16,473
-This ain't no place to rob.
-But robbed it is!

1016
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,812
Help!
Police!

1017
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:26,522
-Good night, Charles.
-Good night.

1018
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:30,926
-Sorry your young man was detained, dear.
-So am l, Uncle Geoffrey.

1019
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:55,586
Good evening, sir.

1020
01:34:55,756 --> 01:34:58,156
There was a ring at the door
a while ago, sir.

1021
01:34:58,325 --> 01:35:02,386
When l answered it,
there was nobody there. l found this.

1022
01:35:31,092 --> 01:35:34,027
You don't happen to know
what Dr. Jekyll uses these for?

1023
01:35:34,195 --> 01:35:38,723
No, sir, l don't rightly know.
l don't rightly know, sir.

1024
01:35:44,205 --> 01:35:47,231
-Have you got it?
-What are you doing hiding behind that--?

1025
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:50,707
l was waiting for you, Dr. Lanyon.
l'm the man from Dr. Jekyll.

1026
01:35:50,878 --> 01:35:53,005
-The package, l'll take it.
-Step inside.

1027
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,841
No, no!
There's not time.

1028
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:58,382
As Jekyll's friend, l have the right
to ask you a few questions.

1029
01:35:58,552 --> 01:36:01,214
Come now, don't waste time
with prying questions.

1030
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:03,788
-Let me have it--
-l don't like your attitude.

1031
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:08,156
-Suppose you introduce yourself.
-Hyde. What difference does that make?

1032
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,627
-You an acquaintance of Jekyll?
-Yes.

1033
01:36:14,802 --> 01:36:17,771
Yes, of course. l'm an old friend.
Now let me have the--

1034
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,496
Where is Dr. Jekyll?

1035
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:22,608
-Don't worry, he's alive.
-What's the matter? ls he ill?

1036
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:25,610
-No! He's perfectly all right.
-Very well, then.

1037
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,011
-l'll come with you and see for myself.
-You pretentious fool!

1038
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:33,244
-You take another step with that, l'll shoot.
-Now, wait a minute, Lanyon.

1039
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:36,856
l can't let you come with me,
and l can't tell you any more.

1040
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:40,585
-Why not?
-Because. Because.

1041
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:43,592
l warn you,
don't stick your nose into this.

1042
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:46,255
You'd better let me go, Lanyon.

1043
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:50,961
-You can ask Jekyll about it tomorrow.
-You'll take me to Harry Jekyll this minute.

1044
01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:55,142
For the last time, Lanyon,
would you let me leave alone?

1045
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:59,109
-No.
-All right. All right, then.

1046
01:36:59,947 --> 01:37:02,575
Let it be on your own head.

1047
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:50,160
Now, once again, Lanyon...

1048
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:52,692
...will you let me take this glass
and go?

1049
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:55,697
No, why should l?

1050
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,235
For your own sake, Lanyon.

1051
01:37:57,404 --> 01:37:59,770
Whatever you're going to do,
get on with it!

1052
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:19,650
l warned you, John.

1053
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:22,381
Even as Hyde, l warned you.

1054
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:35,028
You see what you've done,
don't you?

1055
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:38,429
l mean, you,
you've gone beyond.

1056
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:40,436
You've tampered with....

1057
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:44,067
You've committed
the supreme blasphemy.

1058
01:39:44,845 --> 01:39:47,712
l know, John.
l know, l know.

1059
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:50,349
-You must destroy the formula.
-l've done that.

1060
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:54,385
No, l mean, you must destroy it from
your mind! You can't take this again!

1061
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:57,319
l know. l know.
l know.

1062
01:39:58,425 --> 01:39:59,915
Tonight....

1063
01:40:00,094 --> 01:40:02,927
Tonight, on my way to Sir Charles' ...

1064
01:40:03,197 --> 01:40:05,597
You see, l thought l could control....

1065
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:09,634
But tonight this change, this thing you saw,
happened without my....

1066
01:40:11,171 --> 01:40:14,038
-What about Bea?
-l'll tell her.

1067
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,774
At least l have strength
enough left for that.

1068
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,393
Darling.

1069
01:41:18,305 --> 01:41:21,968
l heard you playing...

1070
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:24,440
...and l thought we could talk in here...

1071
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:27,239
...just as well as anywhere.

1072
01:41:27,414 --> 01:41:29,507
Well, of course, dear.

1073
01:41:29,683 --> 01:41:32,584
l can't imagine how you felt last night
when l--

1074
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:34,948
You don't have to explain anything.

1075
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:37,113
l know it must have been important.

1076
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:41,819
-You know that l'd forgive anything you--
-But that's it, you mustn't forgive anymore!

1077
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:44,190
You must make up your mind to....

1078
01:41:47,534 --> 01:41:51,095
Tell me, darling, what's wrong?

1079
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:54,974
What is it, Harry?

1080
01:41:55,142 --> 01:41:57,007
Look at me.

1081
01:41:58,812 --> 01:42:00,575
Please, Bea....

1082
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:03,048
Let me begin....

1083
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:08,419
There's no way to begin
except to tell you.

1084
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,620
Tell me what?

1085
01:42:13,227 --> 01:42:14,387
You're....

1086
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:16,927
You're a brave girl, aren't you?

1087
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:19,059
Yes.

1088
01:42:19,233 --> 01:42:23,431
That's why l can tell you like this,
because you are brave and strong.

1089
01:42:23,604 --> 01:42:25,572
Always remember that.

1090
01:42:28,242 --> 01:42:32,440
Bea, we can't be married.
l must never see you again.

1091
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:34,371
Oh, you....

1092
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,844
You don't know what you....

1093
01:42:37,017 --> 01:42:39,417
Harry, what's happened?
Look at me!

1094
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:42,384
Just that. Just that.
That's all l can tell you.

1095
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:44,183
But, why?

1096
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:45,848
What...?

1097
01:42:46,026 --> 01:42:49,325
We've always said that there's nothing
we couldn't discuss.

1098
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:53,557
-Nothing secret between you and me, ever.
-Don't ask any more, please.

1099
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:56,362
lf you ever trusted me, trust me now.

1100
01:42:56,537 --> 01:43:00,940
lt's for your happiness and mine,
believe me. That's all l can say.

1101
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:03,633
Oh, my darling!

1102
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,976
Are you ill?

1103
01:43:09,149 --> 01:43:11,982
-There's something you--
-No, no.

1104
01:43:12,152 --> 01:43:15,986
Bea, don't ask me any more.
Don't try to understand. Just take my word.

1105
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:17,953
Now, please go.

1106
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:23,087
This is so wrong of me.

1107
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:27,331
To make you go through all of this.

1108
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:32,662
You're trying not to hurt me,
aren't you?

1109
01:43:33,073 --> 01:43:34,335
Harry....

1110
01:43:34,508 --> 01:43:37,306
Harry, it's all right...

1111
01:43:37,477 --> 01:43:40,105
...if you don't love me anymore.

1112
01:43:41,481 --> 01:43:45,076
-l know things like that can happen.
-Bea.

1113
01:43:47,721 --> 01:43:49,621
Oh, you do.

1114
01:43:49,856 --> 01:43:51,585
You still do.

1115
01:43:52,659 --> 01:43:55,856
-What is it, dearest?
-Bea, Bea, darling.

1116
01:43:56,029 --> 01:43:57,621
No.

1117
01:43:58,365 --> 01:44:00,697
Don't say anything more.

1118
01:44:01,168 --> 01:44:03,693
Just hold me close.

1119
01:44:09,409 --> 01:44:11,502
Goodbye, darling.

1120
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,147
Harry!

1121
01:44:16,049 --> 01:44:17,880
Harry, please!

1122
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:21,418
Please come back!
Please don't....

1123
01:44:21,888 --> 01:44:23,378
Harry!

1124
01:45:20,814 --> 01:45:23,510
You did come back.

1125
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:26,918
Oh, my darling.

1126
01:45:37,664 --> 01:45:39,188
Father!

1127
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:41,027
Father!

1128
01:45:45,272 --> 01:45:48,173
Beatrix!
Beatrix!

1129
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:49,672
Help!
Help!

1130
01:46:05,125 --> 01:46:07,525
What's the matter, sir?
What's wrong, sir?

1131
01:46:07,694 --> 01:46:11,027
-Help!
-Look! There he goes! There he goes! Look!

1132
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,291
There he goes!

1133
01:46:15,669 --> 01:46:18,103
Hey, stop there!

1134
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:32,407
Hey!

1135
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:37,455
Hey! What's going on?!

1136
01:46:56,743 --> 01:46:58,404
Hold it, you!

1137
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,330
This is the weapon, doctor.

1138
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:34,538
Yes. l....

1139
01:47:35,549 --> 01:47:39,315
lf you'll come with me, inspector.
Ward, you remain here.

1140
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:30,195
Dr. Jekyll, that frightful maniac
broke into the house.

1141
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:31,894
-Did he attack you, sir?
-Yes.

1142
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:35,337
-Which way did he go? Out here?
-Didn't know you were home, sir.

1143
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:38,569
-Are you badly hurt?
-No. No, l'll be all right.

1144
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:40,838
This here door's locked.

1145
01:48:41,948 --> 01:48:44,781
-We'd better go out that way.
-Yes.

1146
01:48:46,653 --> 01:48:48,143
Wait!

1147
01:48:56,596 --> 01:48:59,929
-There. Heaven help him.
-Dr. Lanyon...

1148
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:02,568
...but l know this gentleman.
He's Dr. Jekyll.

1149
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:05,204
l know.
Nevertheless, there's your man.

1150
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:08,705
l'm sorry, sir, but l know Dr. Jekyll.
l've known him for years.

1151
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:12,242
-This is your master, isn't it?
-Of course, sir. No doubt of it.

1152
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:15,404
-Then we must have lost him. Come, men.
-No, no. Wait.

1153
01:49:16,016 --> 01:49:18,644
Tell them, Jekyll.
Tell them.

1154
01:49:18,985 --> 01:49:21,078
lt's no use, Jekyll.

1155
01:49:22,022 --> 01:49:25,549
You know it's no use. l beg of you, Jekyll,
tell them who you are.

1156
01:49:25,725 --> 01:49:29,058
-Tell them what you've done.
-l've done nothing.

1157
01:49:29,963 --> 01:49:32,022
l'm Dr. Jekyll.

1158
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:34,830
l'm Dr. Henry Jekyll.

1159
01:49:36,136 --> 01:49:38,070
l've done nothing.

1160
01:49:38,438 --> 01:49:40,497
l'm Dr. Jekyll.

1161
01:49:41,274 --> 01:49:44,243
l'm Dr. Henry Jekyll, l tell you.

1162
01:49:45,345 --> 01:49:47,370
l've done nothing.

1163
01:49:49,282 --> 01:49:52,080
You're looking for a man named Hyde.

1164
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:53,742
Hyde!

1165
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:57,817
l'm Dr. Henry Jekyll.

1166
01:49:58,825 --> 01:50:00,952
l'm Dr. Jekyll, l tell you!

1167
01:50:01,127 --> 01:50:04,119
l tell you, l'm Dr. Jekyll!

1168
01:50:04,297 --> 01:50:06,993
l'm Dr. Henry Jekyll!

1169
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:14,407
lt's no use, Jekyll.
You'd better come quietly.

1170
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:43,595
The Lord is my shepherd,
l shall not want.

1171
01:51:43,763 --> 01:51:47,563
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1172
01:51:47,734 --> 01:51:51,067
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

1173
01:51:51,237 --> 01:51:54,138
He restoreth my soul.

1174
01:51:55,041 --> 01:52:00,343
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness,
for his name's sake.

1175
01:52:00,714 --> 01:52:05,583
Yea, though l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death....
