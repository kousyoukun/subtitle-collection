1
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:24,309
With purity in our hearts...

2
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:26,382
...with right thinking in our minds...

3
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:30,447
...we arm ourselves
with intolerance of all evil.

4
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:34,101
So it is, on this glorious
Sabbath morning...

5
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:37,462
...in this momentous year of 1887...

6
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:40,888
...we naturally turn our thoughts
towards that way of life...

7
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:45,493
...as exemplified by Victoria,
our beloved queen.

8
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,034
For this week begins Her Majesty's
golden jubilee.

9
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:54,230
From her heart has come
an ever-increasing flow...

10
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:57,048
...of virtue and moral blessing.

11
00:01:57,214 --> 00:02:00,530
She came upon a world sadly mired
in the ways of the flesh.

12
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:04,855
But during her reign, the forces of good
have achieved notable...

13
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:07,444
Stop. Stop.

14
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,589
What's wrong, dear?

15
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,133
- Nor the season...

16
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:17,276
...we know that in God's own time
evil shall be wiped out by good.

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,895
Evil wiped out, eh?

18
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:22,302
You wanna take all the fun out of life?

19
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:25,335
Good old Beelzebub,
the boy with the horn!

20
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:28,986
- Has taken root in a new goodness,
during these decades.

21
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:33,825
At the family hearth,
in the shops of industry that...

22
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,890
That the world moves forward today.

23
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:40,057
Blasphemy, I calls it...

24
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,393
...to talk that way
about a man's best friend.

25
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,992
Blasphemy!

26
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,834
- Did Parker go for a constable?
- Yes.

27
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,493
- Hello.
- Hello, governor.

28
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:56,256
You let me go back in there...

29
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:59,358
...and I'll tell them what a grown man
really thinks about.

30
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:02,844
- He been like this before?
- It's gotten worse since the explosion.

31
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,505
- Shock? I see.
- You're a full-blooded young fella.

32
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:07,364
- You'll tell them.
- I thought if...

33
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,279
We know, don't we?

34
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:11,936
What's going on in here?

35
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:15,073
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Now, wait a minute, constable.

36
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:18,471
Take him to Camden Hospital.
Would you give that to Dr. Heath?

37
00:03:18,635 --> 00:03:23,720
Better take him to the station. He's always...
Oh, Dr. Jekyll. Bats, is he?

38
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:26,251
Right, sir.
Camden Hospital it is, Dr. Jekyll.

39
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:29,314
- All right, me lovely. Upsy-daisy.
- Dr. Jekyll, eh?

40
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:33,511
Well, you go on, Dr. Jekyll, and try to put
old Beelzebub in his bottomless pit.

41
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:35,564
He'll show you!

42
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,103
Go back and be good, Dr. Jekyll!

43
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,746
- I must go to the hospital, sir.
- On a Sunday?

44
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,730
You mean that outrageous individual.

45
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,992
Harry says that Providence dropped
the man right into his lap.

46
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:31,763
- Well, but isn't this most unusual, my boy?
- I'm sorry, but it is, sir, most unusual.

47
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,673
Don't you dare be late
for the Marley dinner tonight.

48
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,319
And let you have a free rein
with all those men? I should say not.

49
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:49,397
- That's a silly little hat you've got on.
- I knew you'd like it.

50
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:51,732
There isn't anything about you I like.

51
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,404
All right, Jenkins.

52
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:59,606
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:04,819
- My dear, please.
- Sorry, Father.

54
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:08,021
Beatrix, I'm a very broad-minded man
but I do wish Harry...

55
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:11,384
...wouldn't make such demonstrations
of affection in public...

56
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:15,990
...even if you are going to marry him.
- Now, Father darling, don't be pompous.

57
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,701
Good heavens, nibbling your knuckles.

58
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:23,994
I'll tell them what a grown man
really thinks about.

59
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:26,810
I can't allow it.
It's a matter of ethics, Jekyll.

60
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:30,106
- Please, Dr. Jekyll, may I go in?
- No, not now, Mrs. Higgins.

61
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:33,119
Bear up.
That's how you can help.

62
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:43,224
It's the greatest opportunity I've ever had.
The more I see it, the more I realize it.

63
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:46,144
My dear Jekyll, you know how
we all admire your work...

64
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:49,405
...and this case does come
within the scope of your research.

65
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:52,156
That's why I'd like to bow
to your opinion.

66
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:55,639
But as head of the staff
at this hospital, I cannot...

67
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:05,659
Listen, Jekyll, tell me straight out:
What could you do for this man?

68
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:09,571
I might have a chance of curing him.
I've been experimenting with animals.

69
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:12,484
But what works with animals
may not with a human being.

70
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:15,613
- Your chemicals may be deadly.
- Not one animal has died.

71
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:18,979
It might. It's too dangerous,
too far outside of known medicine.

72
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:22,243
- But I'm no witch doctor.
- Who's called you a witch doctor?

73
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:24,742
You told me yourself
it still had to be proved.

74
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:28,069
I can't allow you to experiment with...
Why, after all...

75
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:31,364
...the man's a human being!
- You mean he was a human being...

76
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:36,068
...and he may be again, if you'd keep ethics
out of this! Sometimes we have to gamble.

77
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,852
Or haven't you the courage to face
the most daring...

78
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:43,459
Jekyll, I wouldn't talk these experiments
around very openly if I were you.

79
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:46,823
You're dealing with things
it would be better not to mention.

80
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:50,087
- There might be trouble.
- Trouble?

81
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:51,943
Trouble!

82
00:06:57,198 --> 00:07:00,394
Harry, old boy, there are rumors of...
What's the matter?

83
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:03,941
- Don't worry, John, I'm leaving.
- Now, it can't be as bad as that.

84
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:07,046
John, my good friend, I realize
your Dr. Heath is right.

85
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:09,965
After all, we doctors can't
experiment on human beings.

86
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:13,740
Something might go wrong, and they'd
no longer believe in our medicine.

87
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:16,654
- Now, look here...
- But when I get proof, ethics or no...

88
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,888
I wanna be on hand, regardless.

89
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:30,448
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Just in time for tea, sir.

90
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:32,913
I'll be bound you had no lunch, sir.

91
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:36,906
Now, what about some nice
hot crumpets, sir, huh?

92
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:40,109
Of course, we mustn't spoil
our appetite for dinner tonight.

93
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:43,276
Miss Beatrix would be after me
properly if we did that, sir.

94
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:49,643
And besides, Mrs. Marley's butler tells me
that their new cook is really first-class, sir.

95
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,615
Sir, what about your tea, sir?

96
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,472
Shall I serve it down there, sir?

97
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,673
Now, look here, sir, you must have
something, you know.

98
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:29,120
Mrs. Marley, my deepest apologies.

99
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:32,101
You doctors.
I know we can never rely on you.

100
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:36,190
You know, I don't mind being scolded
by the smartest hostess in London.

101
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:39,261
- Dr. Jekyll, do sit over there.
- Thank you. Good evening.

102
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:43,621
Giles. Colonel. My special apologies
to you, Lady Colburn.

103
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,278
Pleasurer.

104
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:47,012
- Behaving yourself?
- No.

105
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:50,723
- A doctor's life, huh, Harry?
- The more patients, the colder the soup.

106
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:55,490
Actually, I got started on something
and lost track of time.

107
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:57,665
Oh, yes, Jekyll.

108
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:01,925
Heath was telling me that you're still
carrying on with that research work.

109
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:06,019
- Dr. Heath isn't in sympathy, Dr. Courtland.
- That's understandable, isn't it?

110
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:10,978
After all, separating the facets of the brain.
Rather ambitious, I should call that.

111
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,427
His research goes deeper than the brain into
something more intangible than the mind.

112
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:21,194
- Then all that seems to be left is the soul.
- All right, then, call it the soul.

113
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:22,503
The soul?

114
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:26,217
Come, come, my dear doctor.
Now you're invading my territory.

115
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:29,100
I suppose I am, but I know
that you wouldn't object...

116
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,499
...if science could be of help
to the church.

117
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,347
The church is always grateful
for any help, doctor.

118
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:37,927
Harry doesn't mean a word of this.
I'm afraid he's pulling our leg.

119
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:42,407
I should hope so. I was wondering what
Jekyll would do if I asked him to elaborate.

120
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:44,717
I don't mind elaborating.

121
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:49,552
If you didn't see that poor chap in church
this morning, you heard him, I'm sure.

122
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:51,593
Thank you for your assistance.

123
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:55,178
- Hopelessly insane, obviously.
- I don't think he was insane.

124
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:58,195
I think there was only one side of him
expressing itself.

125
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:01,356
- Good heavens, which side?
- His evil side.

126
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:03,946
The man was spiritually distorted
through shock.

127
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:06,959
That explosion in the gas main last month.

128
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,362
Before that, he was a fine, solid citizen...

129
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:12,427
...kind with his children,
deeply in love with his wife.

130
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:15,020
Since then, he had undergone
a complete change...

131
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,703
...until this afternoon I found him
completely reverted to the animal.

132
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:21,773
We can clearly understand a shock
to the nervous system...

133
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:23,831
...but how does that affect the soul?

134
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:27,440
I think he was shocked
from normal good into complete evil.

135
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,823
When I say he was a good man,
I don't mean he hadn't had a bad thought.

136
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:35,922
Or that he hadn't committed ordinary
transgressions against society.

137
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,698
But, after all, that's the problem
of civilized man's soul, isn't it?

138
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,649
That good and evil are constantly
fighting one another?

139
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:46,226
There's a higher source from which
good can find aid in its fight.

140
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:47,606
I realize that, but...

141
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:52,146
The colonel and I have always felt that
a person can be good if they wish to be.

142
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:57,369
- And, well, otherwise if they don't.
- Jekyll, I simply must get this straight.

143
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,442
Well, let me put it this way:

144
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:02,963
Good and evil are so close as to be
chained together in the soul.

145
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:06,647
Now, suppose we could break that chain,
separate those two selves...

146
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:11,070
...free the good in man, and let it go to its
higher destiny and segregate the bad.

147
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,159
But aren't you a bit presumptuous
in assuming that there's evil in all men?

148
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:19,518
But isn't that true? Wouldn't we be
hypocrites if we didn't admit that?

149
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:24,024
After all, we've all had thoughts that we
didn't want published or shouted out loud.

150
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:27,904
And we certainly have had desires
that are not confined to a drawing room.

151
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,881
Why, as Christians, we admit
that man is created weak.

152
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,858
That's a perfectly honest problem.
Why don't we face it?

153
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,656
Suppose we believe that man's soul
has not yet reached its fulfillment.

154
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,016
Is it wise...? Is it right to tamper
with the problem...

155
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:46,272
...until the Creator himself has solved it
in his own mysterious way?

156
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:48,827
- Sir, I...
- Really, this is very disturbing.

157
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:51,616
Such theories come dangerously close to...

158
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:54,597
I hesitate to think what the medical
council would say...

159
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:59,648
Dr. Courtland, advanced theories are always
a sore point with the medical council.

160
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:03,558
Or even with the queen's physician,
if there's a comfortable profit...

161
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,687
...in those already established.
- Jekyll!

162
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:11,200
If you ask my opinion, young man,
this is pure balderdash.

163
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:13,800
- Ladies.
- I meant to ask:

164
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:17,574
Has anyone read that poem
by this new chap Oscar Wilde?

165
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,621
- Getting old, I suppose.
- Well, it's pretty late.

166
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,955
- We ought to...
- No. Come in and have a nightcap, John.

167
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,159
The rest of the company won't be bored.

168
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,018
Well, thank you, sir.

169
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,095
Look.

170
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,010
It's the waltz that he and Mama
first danced together.

171
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:40,118
May I have this dance, Miss Beatrix?

172
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:42,608
Pleasure, Dr. Jekyll.

173
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,599
- Bea, darling.
- Harry.

174
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:15,416
I love you so very much, Bea.

175
00:15:20,573 --> 00:15:22,515
Oh, Harry.

176
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:28,730
Tonight at dinner, I understood what you
said about the good and evil in people...

177
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,967
...and how it's that way in all of us.

178
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,379
But...

179
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:33,788
Well, why isn't...?

180
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:37,083
Why isn't the way you and I
feel about each other?

181
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:40,887
I mean, there's nothing evil
in that, is there?

182
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:44,767
- Do you think there is?
- No. No, Harry.

183
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:48,409
- Bea, we're in love, aren't we?
- Yes, we're very much in love.

184
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:50,520
That's all the difference.

185
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:59,069
Oh, my dear, John is looking
for a piece of music...

186
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:01,986
... The Banks of Loch Lomond,
will you help him find it?

187
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,156
- Yes, Father.
- Thank you.

188
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,108
Harry...

189
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:11,328
I'm not one to brood, but you must have
noticed my concern in the carriage.

190
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:12,606
I just thought that...

191
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:16,865
That flight of fancy you put forth at dinner,
I must confess, it startled me.

192
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:20,064
Although I'm broad-minded myself,
it was a bit shocking too.

193
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:23,941
I'm sorry to hear you say that, sir,
because it was not a flight of fancy.

194
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:27,879
- You mean, you were in earnest?
- Profoundly, sir. As a matter of fact...

195
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,942
...I hope to spend all of my time...
- This is distressing.

196
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,323
Why?

197
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,910
In my opinion,
the whole thing's harebrained.

198
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:37,832
Well, I'm sorry to hear you
say that, sir. I...

199
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:41,377
You're a coming man in your profession.
I'm very proud of you.

200
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:46,086
But these ridiculous experiments won't get
you anywhere. You must give them up.

201
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:50,438
Develop your practice, cultivate the circle
in which you and Beatrix shall move.

202
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:54,979
Harry, my boy, I've always wanted a son,
and now you're going to be that.

203
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,208
Now, I've had my say. Let's have
your nightcap. It's getting late.

204
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,169
And by the way, I've taken a box
for the opening concert at Albert Hall.

205
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,308
You'll join us, of course.

206
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,920
- So you and the old boy cross swords?
- Yes.

207
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:19,305
Seems I must discontinue my research,
spend my life diagnosing measles...

208
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:23,270
...mumps, and whooping cough
or encounter his serious disapproval.

209
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:27,598
Even I was surprised when you took
a Marley dinner party into your confidence.

210
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:30,730
You need not agree with me,
I just have a decision to make.

211
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,201
Harry, you and I
have been friends for years.

212
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:37,225
I can't agree with you, but that doesn't
make a difference to our friendship.

213
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:39,600
Let's drop into the club.
It'll do you good.

214
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:41,619
Well, I'll walk that far with you.

215
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:49,202
Let me go! You thug! Let me go!

216
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:54,030
Help me! Help me!

217
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:01,714
Let him go. Let him go.

218
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:05,683
- You get a cab. I'll see what's happened.
- Yes.

219
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:13,616
A girl can't walk out with a chap.
Who does he think he is?

220
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:15,641
- The big...
- Did he hurt you?

221
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:18,104
It’ll take more than a bloke like that to...

222
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,834
Why, I bet I look ever so untidy.

223
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:34,105
You sure you're not hurt?

224
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,815
Why, I...
I don't think so.

225
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:46,268
- What is it? Your ankle?
- Yeah. It's twisted.

226
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:49,691
Do you mind?

227
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,447
No, not at all.

228
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:56,765
- After all, an ankle can be very painful.
- You are ever so kind.

229
00:18:58,657 --> 00:19:01,952
Me side too. He hit me.

230
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:04,186
Well, I should have caught him.

231
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,262
No, no.

232
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:07,863
I'm...

233
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:10,238
I mean, I'm so glad you stopped.

234
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:13,279
If you take my meaning.

235
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:20,922
My friend is getting a cab.
Perhaps we could drop you somewhere.

236
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:24,092
- You're ever so kind.
- Shall we try it now?

237
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,082
There. That's a girl.

238
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,791
Gentlemen like you shouldn't be
bothering yourself about me.

239
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:33,531
Now, what sort of a gentleman
doesn't like to help a pretty girl?

240
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,547
Now.

241
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:39,777
And me with me hat all over me head.

242
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:43,707
So he asks me if he can
walk me home, he does.

243
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,695
Well, I turns around
to him, and I says, "Yes. "

244
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:50,686
When a girl is out late, it's nice to have
a bit of company to see her home.

245
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,417
Naturally.

246
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:56,196
Well, I know what's what.

247
00:19:56,362 --> 00:20:00,869
You have to if you are a barmaid.
I like a bit of fun, as the saying goes...

248
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:04,199
...but when a bloke grabs you
with nasty notions in his head...

249
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,632
...it's time to put your foot down.

250
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:13,761
I'm...

251
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:16,714
I'm sorry to bother you gentlemen.

252
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:21,989
Well, here we are.

253
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:34,252
- It hurts more now.
- Does it?

254
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,531
- Can I give a hand, Harry?
- No, I think I can manage.

255
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,768
I'm so sorry.

256
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:45,292
- Night.
- Night.

257
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,479
Here?

258
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,493
The light's by the door,
if you have a match.

259
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,969
Right.

260
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:21,396
You better let down your blouse.

261
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:23,795
Why?

262
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,578
Well, you want me to have
a look at you, don't you?

263
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,142
I don't know.

264
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:34,007
You are looking, ain't you?

265
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,582
Well, how about your side?

266
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:43,383
Do you want to look at my side?

267
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:46,065
Well, don't you want me to?

268
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:05,624
You aren't half a fast one, aren't you?

269
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,086
I forgot to mention,
my friend and I are physicians.

270
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,119
Physi... Physicians?

271
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:15,001
Doctors.

272
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,273
Doctors?

273
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:20,890
Oh, go on!

274
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:24,511
I thought you were a couple of toffs.

275
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:28,057
No, no. Haven't the leisure.

276
00:22:28,226 --> 00:22:32,220
Oh, dear me.
And here I thought...

277
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:45,666
- Well, I'm glad to see you're not really hurt.
- But I am, doctor.

278
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:48,317
- Really.
- Maybe I better send you to the hospital?

279
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:49,597
No.

280
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:52,701
Look. Here. Feel.

281
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,430
- Feel.
- Where? Here?

282
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:00,380
Just as I thought: Cirrhosis pectoris.

283
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,558
What's that mean?

284
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:06,850
That means your eyes
are twin pools of desire.

285
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,367
Oh, doctor.

286
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,928
That's nice.

287
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:16,771
The things you do say.

288
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,803
That doesn't hurt anymore, huh?

289
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:23,044
Oh, yes.

290
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:26,085
- Yes. Yes.
- You'll be all right in the morning.

291
00:23:26,252 --> 00:23:27,812
Wait!

292
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,898
Wait.

293
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,333
My ankle.

294
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:37,957
Don't you think you ought
to look at that?

295
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,979
No.

296
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:46,665
No, your ankle's all right.

297
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:52,135
But I'll tell you one thing.
You wear your garter too tight.

298
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:56,231
- That stops the circulation. That's bad.
- There, you see?

299
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,440
You did find something.

300
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:01,226
You are my doctor, aren't you?

301
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,491
I ought to pay your fee, oughtn't I?

302
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:07,754
I haven't presented you with a bill yet.

303
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:14,290
How about this to begin with?

304
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:16,360
Not that it's enough.

305
00:24:16,532 --> 00:24:18,092
It's fine. It's fine.

306
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,626
It's much more than most people pay.

307
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:24,655
It doesn't seem near enough to me.

308
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,346
Harry, listen...

309
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,841
Oh, sorry.

310
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,945
Come along, will you?
It's getting late.

311
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:41,132
Well...

312
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:43,185
But...

313
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,769
But you aren't really going
just because he says?

314
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:49,587
No, no, no.
But I have to go now.

315
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:52,173
But look here.
Don't you understand?

316
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:54,036
I ain't no...

317
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:56,722
I ain't no...

318
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:59,896
No, I know you're not.
You're a girl with her heart...

319
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:02,993
...just where it ought to be.
Maybe a little too generous.

320
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:06,327
Because you're a nice, pretty girl,
next time be more careful...

321
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:08,279
...about the company you pick, huh?

322
00:25:08,892 --> 00:25:10,517
Well, but...

323
00:25:10,684 --> 00:25:12,091
But you are here, ain't you?

324
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,698
Yes, but I shouldn't be.

325
00:25:15,868 --> 00:25:18,934
And if you really knew me,
you'd know I don't wanna be.

326
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:21,817
Well, I...

327
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,015
I picks only them
as wants my company.

328
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:28,531
- I'm sorry. It was my fault.
- What you sorry about?

329
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:30,644
I am not.

330
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,851
Then let's just say
that we were foolish...

331
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:37,277
...and next time we'll drink
to one another's health.

332
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:40,092
I suppose it was all in fun
when you kissed me.

333
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:42,718
Yes.

334
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:45,496
It wasn't all in fun then.
I know that.

335
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:02,301
Well, goodbye and good luck.

336
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:26,245
Come on, John. Don't be stuffy.

337
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:29,223
After all, the lady wasn't injured,
nor was anyone else.

338
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:32,768
I imagine she might be a tempting
morsel in an off moment.

339
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:36,483
- What do you mean, "off moment"?
- Yours, according to your theory.

340
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,438
I imagine what I just witnessed...

341
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:42,759
...was the momentary triumph of the evil
in your soul over the good, huh? Correct?

342
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:48,325
Yes, yes. I don't think it was a triumph,
but it was an attack.

343
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:52,291
But one which would have been repulsed
even without your help, John.

344
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,038
Wouldn't you run less risk if you
confined your experiments to the lab?

345
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:01,002
That's where you'll find me
from tonight on...

346
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:03,084
...until I get what I'm looking for.

347
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:34,164
I'm worried, John.

348
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:37,780
- He ought to have let us know.
- He'll be along.

349
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,221
Maybe it's all for the best, Dr. Jekyll.

350
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:13,913
That wasn't my son in there.

351
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,636
It was as if the evil one
had crept into his heart.

352
00:29:16,803 --> 00:29:19,072
My poor Sam.

353
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,913
- Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home.
- Yes, sir.

354
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:24,801
- I'll walk.
- Oh, thank you, Dr. Jekyll.

355
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,298
- Thank you.
- Good night, Mrs. Higgins.

356
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:30,396
Good night, doctor. Good night.

357
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:38,661
- Hello, Dr. Jekyll. How are you?
- Good evening, Mr. Weller.

358
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,898
Just in time, sir.

359
00:29:41,063 --> 00:29:42,851
Just locking up.

360
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:48,032
Wait half a moment until I fix this thing over
here, I'll walk up to the east gate with you.

361
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:51,237
Wonderful nights we're having, sir.

362
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:55,744
And don't you believe about this here comet
and the "world coming to an end" business.

363
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:58,335
If you ask me,
it don't amount to a row of beans.

364
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,669
Newspaper talk, that's what I calls it.
Don't you believe it.

365
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:06,025
Just step down to Lloyd's and take out an
insurance policy and it won't cost you...

366
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:09,503
...more than it did last week when
there was no talk of a comet...

367
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,333
...or the world running into one.

368
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,875
Those are fellows that know what they're
talking about, sir. You take that from me.

369
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:17,571
Mr. Weller, here's a point.

370
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:21,516
If you had a balloon that carried a man
to Mars and the pilot you picked...

371
00:30:21,678 --> 00:30:25,508
...suddenly disappeared, would you
get in the balloon yourself and cast off?

372
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:27,052
A balloon?

373
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:29,964
Well, that's a good one, sir.
I think you got me there.

374
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:33,575
I don't know though. If I had a balloon
that would take me there...

375
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:37,453
...and back, mind you, I don't know
that I wouldn't have a go at it.

376
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:40,268
Might get me away
from me mother-in-law for a while.

377
00:30:40,497 --> 00:30:43,432
How's that for an answer, Dr. Jekyll?

378
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:46,896
Fair enough, Mr. Weller. Fair enough.

379
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:14,639
Yes?

380
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,464
What?

381
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:20,427
Oh.

382
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:24,652
Oh, no.

383
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,434
Can this be evil?

384
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,704
Dr. Jekyll.

385
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:30,813
Dr. Jekyll?

386
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:34,771
- What's happening, sir? Are you all right?
- What is it? What do you want?

387
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,501
Is that you, Dr. Jekyll?

388
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:38,460
Now, wait a minute.

389
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:40,798
Wait a minute, Poole.

390
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:50,175
Dr. Jekyll, who is that in there?

391
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:57,692
Dr. Jekyll, answer me, sir.

392
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:31,078
Yes, Poole?

393
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,544
I'm sorry, sir, but I...

394
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:38,048
I heard an odd noise and a strange voice.
I thought something was happening, sir.

395
00:36:38,218 --> 00:36:40,738
No, no, no. It's quite all right, Poole.

396
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:44,102
There was someone here.
A friend of mine.

397
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:45,640
A Mr. Hyde.

398
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,712
I let him out the back door.

399
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:50,119
Oh, I see, sir. Very good, sir.

400
00:36:50,283 --> 00:36:52,868
Miss Beatrix is here, sir.

401
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:55,207
I showed her into
the consulting room, sir.

402
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:57,379
I hope I did right, sir.

403
00:36:57,805 --> 00:37:00,555
Yes, yes, that was quite right, Poole.

404
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,745
Tell Miss Beatrix
I'll be there immediately.

405
00:37:05,134 --> 00:37:06,989
Very good, sir.

406
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:05,746
Harry.

407
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,807
What are you doing here, Bea?

408
00:38:10,968 --> 00:38:15,475
- Oh, Harry, then you're not...
- Not what?

409
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,517
Oh, I don't know.

410
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:20,495
I had the strangest feeling.

411
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,311
- I thought...
- Yes? You thought?

412
00:38:24,122 --> 00:38:26,194
That you were going away...

413
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:29,236
...without ever seeing me again.

414
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:31,378
Well, why would I do that, Bea?

415
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,882
- I love you. Why...
- Oh, I know.

416
00:38:34,108 --> 00:38:35,896
But I lost you for a moment, Harry.

417
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:39,351
- I was afraid.
- But you're not afraid now?

418
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:41,017
Of course not.

419
00:38:41,182 --> 00:38:43,418
Well, you see that everything's all right...

420
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:47,128
...nothing has happened,
that I'm the same as I ever was?

421
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:49,269
Of course.

422
00:38:49,438 --> 00:38:52,853
- It must have been a dream.
- Yes, yes, a dream.

423
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:54,712
You're not angry with me?

424
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:56,667
Angry?

425
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,830
Oh, I don't want you to leave me. Ever.

426
00:39:00,992 --> 00:39:02,366
Oh, darling.

427
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:04,601
I love you so much.

428
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,704
- Please don't send me away.
- No.

429
00:39:14,915 --> 00:39:16,606
Yes, Father?

430
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:26,362
It's a good thing I was worried about your
behavior tonight. I couldn't sleep myself.

431
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:31,137
Sir Charles, I know it's strange to find
Beatrix here but I want you to believe that...

432
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:34,945
All I can believe is that your ideas
are not normal, Jekyll, not fit...

433
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:38,076
Sir Charles, I asked Beatrix
to come here tonight because...

434
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:39,806
No, Harry.

435
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:44,131
Father, I know my being here is difficult
to understand, but I'm not ashamed.

436
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:48,926
Then, my dear, I shall be for you,
because I do understand.

437
00:39:49,288 --> 00:39:52,135
We leave for the Continent
tomorrow on the boat train.

438
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:53,408
Father, please.

439
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:57,439
Oh, come, Sir Charles. After all,
you could eliminate all this difficulty...

440
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:59,943
...if you'd set an early date
for our marriage.

441
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,521
You don't understand. We're very much
in love. We wanna be together.

442
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:06,025
- We don't wanna wait any longer.
- Please, Father.

443
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:09,569
In view of what's happened,
the engagement should be broken off.

444
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:13,351
However, I'll be lenient. We shall see you
on our return. Come, my dear.

445
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:17,226
Father, I've never
disobeyed you in my life.

446
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:21,187
But, Harry,
if you don't want me to leave...

447
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:22,666
...I'll refuse.

448
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:26,025
- Beatrix.
- I mean it, Father.

449
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,951
I don't want you to go, Bea...

450
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,283
...and I can't agree with your
father's decision, but I know...

451
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:39,182
...he's thinking of your happiness. I can't
argue against that and I can't ask you to.

452
00:40:39,344 --> 00:40:41,864
That's highly commendable, Harry.

453
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:46,280
Will you see us off at the train?

454
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:50,344
Better have two engines.
I might try to hold it back.

455
00:40:51,378 --> 00:40:54,411
Try. Try anyway.

456
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,136
A glass of sherry wine, sir?

457
00:41:21,303 --> 00:41:22,732
No. No, thanks.

458
00:41:22,903 --> 00:41:26,831
Well, would you consider
a letter from Monte Carlo, sir?

459
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:33,068
- I'll take the sherry wine too.
- Yes, sir.

460
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:37,011
Miss Beatrix should be returning home
soon now, shouldn't she?

461
00:41:37,177 --> 00:41:39,086
Yes. Yes, Poole.

462
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,953
Hobson was telling me
that they were expected.

463
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,580
Bad news, sir?

464
00:42:07,102 --> 00:42:10,298
Miss Beatrix and her father
are going to Aix-les-Bains.

465
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,108
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

466
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:15,134
Sir Charles' health, no doubt?

467
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:17,597
Yes, yes.

468
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:20,479
Yes, Sir Charles' health, no doubt.

469
00:42:28,097 --> 00:42:32,538
If you'll forgive me, sir,
it upsets me to see you like this.

470
00:42:32,706 --> 00:42:34,299
It isn't right.

471
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:37,183
All work, as the saying goes, sir.

472
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:42,394
They say there's a very interesting
musical show at the vanity fair, sir.

473
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:44,636
Very comical, you know, sir.

474
00:42:44,804 --> 00:42:50,369
And very daring,
if you follow my meaning, sir.

475
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:55,171
Yeah, I follow your meaning, Poole.

476
00:42:55,334 --> 00:42:59,458
But I don't think it would be wise,
even though it is comical.

477
00:42:59,655 --> 00:43:01,062
Quite so, sir.

478
00:43:01,223 --> 00:43:05,249
- I'll fetch you another glass, sir.
- Oh, never mind, Poole.

479
00:45:35,104 --> 00:45:38,617
Thanks for the pay, sir.
Hey, hey, hey!

480
00:45:39,744 --> 00:45:41,883
Here. What's the idea, governor?

481
00:45:42,048 --> 00:45:44,633
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.

482
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:56,864
Yes, sir?

483
00:45:57,475 --> 00:46:00,192
Box F, sir. Right this way.

484
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,318
Now, all together, boys.

485
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,923
Two pints.

486
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:37,836
Oh, oh.

487
00:47:38,003 --> 00:47:40,523
A tip. A tip, of course.

488
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:44,302
Seven shillings, sir? Why...

489
00:47:44,468 --> 00:47:47,763
- Why not? You work hard, don't you?
- Yes, sir. Bless you, sir.

490
00:47:47,924 --> 00:47:52,659
- You have a family, no doubt.
- Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you.

491
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:56,208
- Did you hurt yourself?
- What the...?

492
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:58,544
Oh, what a pity.

493
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,099
You were thinking of the children,
no doubt?

494
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,637
Now, have that barmaid
bring me some champagne.

495
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:07,858
- Ivy ain't allowed to leave the bar.
- I don't think you understood what I said.

496
00:48:08,024 --> 00:48:11,057
- What's all this here?
- This gent here wants champagne, sir.

497
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:13,558
Champagne?
All right, then, bring it, bring it.

498
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:17,070
- But he wants Ivy to serve it.
- Of course Ivy will serve it. Go on.

499
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:18,932
Look lively.

500
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:24,724
A gent in box F wants you to serve him,
and Old Prouty says you're to do it.

501
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:27,279
Oh, he does?
I'll tell him it ain't my business.

502
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:29,338
But he wants a bottle of the boil.

503
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:32,761
Oh, bubbly. Why didn't you say so?

504
00:48:32,924 --> 00:48:36,819
Hey, Ivy, me love, how about some
fish and chips after the show?

505
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:40,468
How about a dozen oysters
and a pint of stout?

506
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:45,336
What about a glass of champagne?

507
00:48:46,558 --> 00:48:49,525
- Oh, hello, Marcia.
- Hello, Ivy.

508
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:53,659
Watch out, Ivy.

509
00:48:53,823 --> 00:48:55,863
How's about it, Ivy?

510
00:48:56,128 --> 00:48:57,786
Over there, Ivy.

511
00:48:57,952 --> 00:49:00,057
Ain't she a bit of horseflesh?

512
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:33,914
Well, that'll...

513
00:49:34,086 --> 00:49:35,711
That'll be half a quid, sir.

514
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:38,114
Half a quid?

515
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:40,604
Yes, sir.

516
00:49:40,966 --> 00:49:42,754
Half a quid.

517
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,612
Here.

518
00:49:44,775 --> 00:49:47,710
Here's a sovereign, my dear.
Keep the change.

519
00:49:48,135 --> 00:49:50,077
Thank you, sir.

520
00:49:50,856 --> 00:49:54,402
Oh, but you're not going?
Oh, no. No.

521
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:57,023
After all, you brought two glasses.

522
00:49:57,193 --> 00:49:59,614
Two minds with but a single thought.

523
00:49:59,785 --> 00:50:01,792
My, what a nice beginning.

524
00:50:01,962 --> 00:50:04,831
Sit down there.
Sit right down.

525
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,977
Well, I...

526
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:09,481
Well, I'll just take a sip.

527
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:13,123
- Of course, I shouldn't stay too long.
- Oh, nonsense. Nonsense.

528
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:14,983
You can stay as long as you like.

529
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:17,831
After all, we have all evening,
haven't we?

530
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:20,582
Of course we have. Here.

531
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:22,536
There.

532
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:25,094
Oh, I like your singing.

533
00:50:25,262 --> 00:50:29,037
Yes. You must sing again
for me sometime.

534
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:32,172
Where did you get such a pretty voice?

535
00:50:37,296 --> 00:50:38,572
Well, I don't know.

536
00:50:39,664 --> 00:50:43,242
- I just...
- Perhaps it's the pretty place it comes from?

537
00:50:44,529 --> 00:50:46,765
- Well...
- Very lovely, where it comes from.

538
00:50:46,929 --> 00:50:51,239
- Well, here's health so good luck.
- I make my own luck, my dear.

539
00:50:51,474 --> 00:50:54,441
Yes, and tonight I follow the rainbow.

540
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:01,261
Oh, you don't half talk, do you?

541
00:51:01,427 --> 00:51:03,566
Perhaps we could follow it together?

542
00:51:03,732 --> 00:51:07,507
- I'll follow it right home, mister.
- To that rattrap?

543
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:11,728
- Hey, what are you calling names?
- Well, I think you deserve something better.

544
00:51:13,334 --> 00:51:14,894
How do you know where I live?

545
00:51:15,477 --> 00:51:17,746
Well, I can imagine.

546
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:22,165
Surely your wages here
don't earn you a place in Barkley Square.

547
00:51:27,063 --> 00:51:28,372
Well, I think I'll be off.

548
00:51:29,432 --> 00:51:33,327
Why? I don't confuse you, do I, Ivy?

549
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:37,009
I believe I do confuse you, don't I?

550
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,860
I ain't confused by nobody.

551
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:43,054
Let go. Do you hear?

552
00:51:51,355 --> 00:51:53,078
Let go.

553
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:00,497
Let go, you hear?

554
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:03,157
- What's he doing, Ivy?
- Oh, you let go too!

555
00:52:03,325 --> 00:52:05,212
Watch out, Ivy love.

556
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:09,108
- Here, here. What's this all about?
- It's him. He insulted her.

557
00:52:09,278 --> 00:52:11,961
- He's lying, I tell you!
- He tried to break her arm.

558
00:52:12,126 --> 00:52:14,876
- He did, did he?
- Yes, yes. Tried to break her arm.

559
00:52:15,647 --> 00:52:17,981
You will? You want another one?

560
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:27,035
No! No! Stop it! Stop it!

561
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:28,662
I'll stop it, sir.

562
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:32,217
Hey, boys! Now, boys!
Boys, will you...?

563
00:52:50,757 --> 00:52:53,604
I can't understand what happened.
Never a rumpus here.

564
00:52:53,765 --> 00:52:55,674
Most orderly.

565
00:52:56,102 --> 00:52:59,582
It's that girl, Ivy, that barmaid.
Pretty girls always cause trouble.

566
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:04,223
- I'd throw her out if I were you.
- What? Ivy? I can't do that to Ivy.

567
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:07,424
A great man can always
change his mind...

568
00:53:07,592 --> 00:53:09,414
...for a reason.

569
00:53:09,575 --> 00:53:11,909
Yes, sir. Why, certainly, sir. Yes, sir.

570
00:53:12,072 --> 00:53:14,493
A troublemaker, that's what she is.
Out she goes.

571
00:53:14,665 --> 00:53:17,512
Yes, but now,
while the evening is still young.

572
00:53:17,673 --> 00:53:20,673
- Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
- Yes, certainly.

573
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:26,179
What happened? I've done nothing.
Just minding my own business.

574
00:53:26,346 --> 00:53:28,713
- That's my decision, my girl.
- Stop pushing!

575
00:53:28,874 --> 00:53:31,110
- Don't hang about here.
- Who's hanging about?

576
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:34,570
- Go on. Don't argue the point.
- Oh, good riddance.

577
00:53:36,204 --> 00:53:38,440
What's happened in there?

578
00:53:42,445 --> 00:53:45,707
- Is there some trouble, Ivy?
- Trouble? I was sacked, that's what!

579
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:48,258
How fortunate I'm here.
I'd like to help you.

580
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:51,724
Let me back in there so I can bash him
on the nose, that's all!

581
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:57,702
Quite the little Tartar, aren't you?
Always ready to flare up. Oh, I like that.

582
00:53:57,872 --> 00:54:02,793
Here, here. This is just to prove
that I want to help you.

583
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:21,102
The rainbow is wide and long, Ivy.

584
00:54:22,003 --> 00:54:26,258
- Oh, now wait. I better get home.
- No, no, no.

585
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,526
Ivy, my darling,
you belong with the immortals.

586
00:54:32,693 --> 00:54:34,351
Come with me to Mount Olympus.

587
00:54:34,517 --> 00:54:38,063
Drink nectar with the gods.
Sing the ancient songs of pleasure.

588
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:41,165
And put Athena and Diana to shame.

589
00:54:44,087 --> 00:54:47,600
Oh, you aren't half of one
with the words, aren't you?

590
00:54:47,959 --> 00:54:50,228
And don't be frightened
of me, will you, Ivy?

591
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:55,181
When a botanist finds a rare flower,
he shouts his triumph, doesn't he?

592
00:54:56,248 --> 00:54:58,255
Are you one of them?

593
00:54:58,425 --> 00:55:02,484
You like a man who sees a girl
and makes up his mind, don't you?

594
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:07,087
I don't know what you're talking about.

595
00:55:07,707 --> 00:55:11,187
Oh, she doesn't know
what I'm talking about.

596
00:55:15,068 --> 00:55:17,621
- Please, sir.
- But you'll find out, won't you?

597
00:55:17,788 --> 00:55:20,755
- Please.
- You'll find out what it means.

598
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:21,937
Please, sir.

599
00:55:27,614 --> 00:55:29,141
The London Post, Sir Charles.

600
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,804
Oh, thank you.

601
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:33,243
And one for you, mademoiselle.

602
00:55:51,714 --> 00:55:54,431
What does Harry have to say
this morning, my dear?

603
00:55:55,106 --> 00:55:57,659
I said, what does Harry say this morning?

604
00:55:57,827 --> 00:55:59,966
Oh, nothing much.

605
00:56:00,131 --> 00:56:02,749
I'll wager my gout hurts him
more than it does me.

606
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:06,270
Does he send any news I can hear?

607
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:10,745
Oh, he just says that he walked
through the East End recently.

608
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,164
"I have never seen such deplorable
housing conditions.

609
00:56:16,326 --> 00:56:19,425
Surely the city fathers
should find the funds to... "

610
00:56:20,231 --> 00:56:23,941
Well, then he just goes on to say
about the housing conditions.

611
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:25,826
They must be pretty dreadful.

612
00:56:26,087 --> 00:56:30,626
Yes, he's quite right. They're disgraceful.
I was just saying at the club before I left.

613
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:33,858
Now, there's a problem
Harry could get his teeth into.

614
00:56:34,025 --> 00:56:35,781
He's just the man to...

615
00:56:36,073 --> 00:56:38,277
Here, here, my dear. What's wrong?

616
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:41,092
Nothing.
I suppose I'm just not very interested...

617
00:56:41,257 --> 00:56:44,606
...in housing conditions at the moment.

618
00:56:45,354 --> 00:56:49,282
You mean because a man doesn't cover
the pages with sentiment? Nonsense.

619
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:52,614
A woman must learn to read
between the lines, my dear.

620
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:55,299
Yes, I like the tone of that letter.

621
00:56:55,724 --> 00:57:00,197
And what's more, my dear, I think my gout
is getting very, very much better.

622
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:33,128
- Oh, hello, Marcia.
- Are you here alone?

623
00:57:33,298 --> 00:57:36,614
Yes, yes. I just made some tea.
Come and have a cup.

624
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:40,878
Not me, nor you either. We ain't got time.
Get dressed, we're going out.

625
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:45,418
Freddie's got a young brother from Oxford.
They want another girl to make it a quartet.

626
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:49,103
He's a bit of all right too.

627
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:50,992
And we're going to the Empire.

628
00:57:51,156 --> 00:57:53,971
- The Empire?
- Yes. Oh, it's ever so gay there, Ivy...

629
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:57,745
...and the show is grand.
It's just where all the toffs go.

630
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:04,370
- No, I don't think so, Marcia.
- Why not?

631
00:58:04,534 --> 00:58:07,054
I just don't feel like it. That's all.

632
00:58:07,223 --> 00:58:09,492
You ain't afraid to go, are you?

633
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,440
Afraid?

634
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:16,211
- Why should I be afraid?
- Oh, I don't know.

635
00:58:16,376 --> 00:58:17,837
I just thought...

636
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:19,634
Well, I ain't afraid of nobody.

637
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:22,452
But you ain't been out
for ever so long, have you?

638
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:25,782
- No, but...
- He ain't your lord and master, is he?

639
00:58:25,946 --> 00:58:27,058
I should say he ain't.

640
00:58:27,226 --> 00:58:30,041
Or is it because you ain't
got a nice enough dress?

641
00:58:33,563 --> 00:58:34,675
Of course I have.

642
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,713
What are you standing there for, then?
Go and put it on.

643
00:58:40,253 --> 00:58:41,813
All right.

644
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:47,766
What's that across your back?

645
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:51,097
What? There's nothing.

646
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:56,186
Did he do that to you?

647
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:58,522
- Let me see.
- No. No.

648
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:01,428
It ain't nothing.

649
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,156
- I just...
- So that's your fine friend, is it?

650
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,781
The dirty, filthy brute!

651
00:59:05,952 --> 00:59:08,603
If ever a man dared lay a hand
to me like that, I'd...

652
00:59:12,353 --> 00:59:14,076
Well...

653
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:18,138
Aren't you going to introduce
me to our charming visitor?

654
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:22,943
It's Marcia.

655
00:59:24,131 --> 00:59:26,684
This is my friend, Mr. Hyde.

656
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,216
You've heard me speak
about him, haven't you?

657
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:33,659
Oh, yes, Marcia.
I've heard a great deal about you.

658
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:36,033
I've never been interested.

659
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,343
Until now.

660
00:59:37,862 --> 00:59:39,684
I've got to be toddling along now.

661
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:46,404
- Toodle-loo, Ivy.
- Oh, no, no.

662
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:48,258
Don't go now, Marcia.

663
00:59:48,424 --> 00:59:53,345
After all, this could be very interesting,
the three of us in friendly discussion.

664
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,396
I can't keep my friend waiting.

665
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,822
- I'll be dropping by, Ivy.
- Yes, yes, yes.

666
01:00:00,009 --> 01:00:02,911
Drop by sometime when I'm here, Marcia.

667
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:05,225
Your ideas differ from mine.

668
01:00:06,122 --> 01:00:10,148
It would be a charming
experience to change them.

669
01:00:10,379 --> 01:00:12,550
Ivy found it that way.
Didn't we, dear?

670
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:18,219
Nice material.

671
01:00:18,668 --> 01:00:20,075
Goodbye.

672
01:00:37,904 --> 01:00:40,424
Very nice material.

673
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:52,783
Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?

674
01:00:53,554 --> 01:00:55,342
Oui. Yes, sir.

675
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:00,423
That's what frightens you, isn't it?

676
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:02,415
Why...

677
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,367
...no, sir, I...

678
01:01:05,715 --> 01:01:08,497
You're afraid I'll become
interested in Marcia.

679
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,001
Why...

680
01:01:10,164 --> 01:01:12,466
...well, if you...
If you want to...

681
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:13,969
What?!

682
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:15,540
What?!

683
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:19,092
You're not very clear.

684
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:22,836
Well, sir, I...

685
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:26,826
Oh. Oh, you poor child.

686
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:30,960
I'm such a tease, aren't I?
Such a tease.

687
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,640
Yes, sir.

688
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:41,395
What a lucky man I am
to be loved this way.

689
01:01:45,978 --> 01:01:49,361
But supposing I did have
to leave you for a while?

690
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:52,950
Leave, sir? When?

691
01:01:53,115 --> 01:01:56,214
I'm not saying when,
I said "suppose. "

692
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,380
Well...

693
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:04,308
Supposing I had to take a trip
from time to time?

694
01:02:04,477 --> 01:02:05,906
You...

695
01:02:06,078 --> 01:02:08,347
You mean... soon?

696
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:10,803
Well, now, I don't know.

697
01:02:13,086 --> 01:02:14,744
Oh, you mustn't look so worried.

698
01:02:17,663 --> 01:02:20,380
It won't be for a long, long time.

699
01:02:23,008 --> 01:02:24,699
Oh, I see.

700
01:02:25,024 --> 01:02:27,512
So we won't think
about it now, will we?

701
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,792
No, sir.

702
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:32,314
When I do go, it will break
your heart, won't it?

703
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:34,074
Yes, sir.

704
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:46,753
Well...

705
01:02:47,588 --> 01:02:50,719
What would my little cherub
like to do this evening?

706
01:02:51,013 --> 01:02:53,347
Oh, sir, could we go out?

707
01:02:53,509 --> 01:02:57,284
Out? You mean gad about a bit,
see the sights?

708
01:02:57,445 --> 01:02:59,998
Yes, sir. Oh, you'd like it,
wouldn't you, sir?

709
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:03,810
Well, now, I don't know. I don't know.
That might be very charming.

710
01:03:03,974 --> 01:03:05,250
Where would we go?

711
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:07,717
Oh, they say that the Empire
and such places...

712
01:03:07,879 --> 01:03:09,602
They do? Who does?

713
01:03:09,767 --> 01:03:12,101
Well, Marcia, sir.
She says it's ever so gay.

714
01:03:12,264 --> 01:03:14,566
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

715
01:03:15,144 --> 01:03:16,802
We can go, can't we?

716
01:03:16,969 --> 01:03:19,816
They say that the bill
is ever so good.

717
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:25,348
And I haven't been out for so long.

718
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:28,580
No. No, that's right.
You haven't, have you?

719
01:03:28,747 --> 01:03:31,202
You do look a little pale.

720
01:03:31,371 --> 01:03:34,851
Yes. Yes, that's true.
Not that I am complaining, you understand...

721
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,573
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I understand.

722
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,879
You're just nervous and jumpy, that's all.

723
01:03:40,044 --> 01:03:41,735
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, yes.

724
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,618
You have that cooped-up feeling.

725
01:03:45,357 --> 01:03:47,080
Yes. You do understand, don't you?

726
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:48,391
- Yes, yes.
- Well, then...

727
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,405
Well, now, where would we go?

728
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:56,391
We might go to Albert Hall.

729
01:03:56,558 --> 01:04:00,268
Yes. And hear a symphony.

730
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,240
Albert Hall, sir?

731
01:04:06,064 --> 01:04:09,413
Well, I sort of hoped that...

732
01:04:11,537 --> 01:04:12,649
What makes you say...?

733
01:04:14,162 --> 01:04:15,722
So you'd like to go out, huh?

734
01:04:19,762 --> 01:04:21,289
Yes, sir.

735
01:04:21,555 --> 01:04:23,148
I'll go and put my things on.

736
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:26,604
Don't hurry.

737
01:04:27,028 --> 01:04:28,915
Because we're not going.

738
01:04:29,844 --> 01:04:31,371
Sir?

739
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:37,228
The bill is ever so good right here.

740
01:04:56,377 --> 01:05:00,054
Now, let's see, what shall we do?

741
01:05:05,786 --> 01:05:08,274
We could play cards.

742
01:05:13,883 --> 01:05:17,593
But you're probably tired
of cards, aren't you?

743
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,642
You might read to me.

744
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:28,852
Yes.

745
01:05:31,005 --> 01:05:32,434
Yes.

746
01:05:33,534 --> 01:05:36,185
Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice.

747
01:05:41,823 --> 01:05:44,059
But we haven't the book, have we?

748
01:05:48,225 --> 01:05:53,375
And I don't suppose you know it
from memory, do you?

749
01:05:54,305 --> 01:05:56,093
I know.

750
01:05:56,674 --> 01:05:59,095
I know what we like.

751
01:06:10,213 --> 01:06:11,838
You must sing for me.

752
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:17,024
No. Oh, no, not that.

753
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,302
- Why not?
- Not that.

754
01:06:18,469 --> 01:06:19,646
Not in good voice?

755
01:06:19,814 --> 01:06:22,629
- It isn't that, sir, but...
- But it's such a pretty song.

756
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,929
- Please, not tonight.
- Yes. Sing it gaily.

757
01:06:25,094 --> 01:06:28,225
- I can't! Truly, I can't!
- Sing it with deep compassion then.

758
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:30,431
Or loving kindness even.

759
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:33,152
- Sing it moodily, sing it with...
- I can't!

760
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,287
You hear me? Sing it! Sing it!

761
01:06:50,762 --> 01:06:53,828
Smile when you sing! Be happy! Be gay!

762
01:06:59,468 --> 01:07:00,962
That's it!

763
01:07:02,253 --> 01:07:04,936
That's it! That's it! That's it!

764
01:07:06,893 --> 01:07:08,780
That's it!

765
01:07:11,246 --> 01:07:13,831
Bravo! A prima donna is born!

766
01:07:13,998 --> 01:07:16,365
Let's shower her with orchids!

767
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:21,578
The world is yours, my darling.

768
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:23,783
The moment is mine.

769
01:07:29,393 --> 01:07:31,280
And I says to the wife, I says:

770
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:35,151
"Look here, my girl,
if you think the world is... "

771
01:08:00,886 --> 01:08:02,609
Good morning, sir.

772
01:08:03,222 --> 01:08:06,069
How about a nice hot cup of tea, sir?

773
01:08:06,231 --> 01:08:07,572
No. No, thanks, Poole.

774
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:10,899
Would you consider a telegram
from foreign parts, sir?

775
01:08:12,919 --> 01:08:15,504
And a nice cup of tea as well, sir, huh?

776
01:08:15,672 --> 01:08:16,784
I know it's good news.

777
01:08:16,953 --> 01:08:20,269
Hobson told me last night that they
were expected home today, sir.

778
01:08:20,441 --> 01:08:23,408
This is a great day for us,
if you'll forgive me saying so.

779
01:08:23,578 --> 01:08:27,408
Soon be back to our regular meals,
regular hours, regular ways, sir.

780
01:08:27,578 --> 01:08:29,999
- Your breakfast will be ready soon, sir.
- Poole.

781
01:08:32,251 --> 01:08:36,342
Put on your hat and coat and take an
envelope to the district messenger office...

782
01:08:36,508 --> 01:08:39,508
...to be delivered by hand.
- Very good, sir.

783
01:09:26,051 --> 01:09:29,434
Ivy. Ivy, dear, it's me.

784
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,227
- Oh, Marcia. Hello.
- Hello, Ivy.

785
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:42,245
I didn't hear you. Hello, Fred.

786
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:44,383
Hello, Ivy.

787
01:09:46,631 --> 01:09:48,965
Get yourself a drink, Fred.

788
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:52,900
- I'll make some tea.
- We don't want anything.

789
01:09:53,512 --> 01:09:55,105
Yes, but...

790
01:10:02,474 --> 01:10:05,191
Don't bother about us, Ivy, dear.

791
01:10:09,482 --> 01:10:12,002
- Oh, Marcia!
- Oh.

792
01:10:20,365 --> 01:10:22,437
For Miss Ivy Peterson.

793
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:25,640
Thanks, governor.

794
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:40,877
Look.

795
01:10:45,872 --> 01:10:48,076
Fifty pounds.

796
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:52,297
There ain't no letter.
You don't suppose it's from him?

797
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:54,505
He must have sent it for what he's done.

798
01:10:54,674 --> 01:10:57,740
No, not him. He's too mean, he is.

799
01:11:01,651 --> 01:11:03,658
Oh, I don't know.

800
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:08,845
I wouldn't put it past him.

801
01:11:13,557 --> 01:11:14,931
Yes.

802
01:11:16,053 --> 01:11:17,841
Yes, that's it.

803
01:11:19,605 --> 01:11:22,452
Hopes I'll use it to try and run away.

804
01:11:23,318 --> 01:11:26,667
Oh, I can see him thinking it up, I can.

805
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:31,374
And then, then he'll follow me.

806
01:11:32,023 --> 01:11:35,635
And just when I think that
I've got free, he'll...

807
01:11:36,856 --> 01:11:39,409
I can't stand it anymore.

808
01:11:39,577 --> 01:11:41,716
I can't stand it.

809
01:11:43,961 --> 01:11:46,350
Oh, if I could only do it...

810
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:49,624
...I'd go down to the river.

811
01:11:52,571 --> 01:11:54,905
Oh, Ivy.

812
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:59,603
It's her nerves, that's what.
She ought to see a doctor.

813
01:12:01,564 --> 01:12:05,590
There's a copy of the Winged Victory.
The real one's in the Louvre in Paris.

814
01:12:05,757 --> 01:12:07,480
I know because I saw it there.

815
01:12:07,646 --> 01:12:10,581
What's the sense of being victorious
if you haven't a head?

816
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:14,066
What's the sense of my taking a trip,
acquiring art and culture...

817
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:16,343
...if you're not going to pay attention?

818
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:19,826
You're back here.
That's the only victory that counts.

819
01:12:19,999 --> 01:12:22,388
That's why I was deluged
with all those letters.

820
01:12:22,559 --> 01:12:24,086
- Bea, now look...
- Oh, I know.

821
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:28,413
But if I ever go away again and you
don't write just because you're ill...

822
01:12:28,865 --> 01:12:32,345
Oh, don't you see how much more
worried that would make me?

823
01:12:33,537 --> 01:12:34,966
It all amounts to this.

824
01:12:35,138 --> 01:12:39,677
But February is still a long way away,
and your father will simply have to listen...

825
01:12:40,866 --> 01:12:45,755
If you don't stop looking at me like that,
I won't be responsible for what happens.

826
01:12:47,843 --> 01:12:51,192
- Aren't public places awful sometimes?
- Awful.

827
01:12:51,364 --> 01:12:54,299
- May I interrupt this loud conversation?
- Oh, here you are.

828
01:12:54,469 --> 01:12:57,785
Sir Charles, glad to see you.
Sorry you weren't in. You look fine.

829
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:00,542
It's nice to be back.
You're looking well yourself.

830
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,525
Sorry to be late, my dear.
In an argument at the club.

831
01:13:03,686 --> 01:13:04,831
What's on the program?

832
01:13:04,999 --> 01:13:07,584
I thought we'd go to Stewart's,
if that's agreeable.

833
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:10,980
Excellent! But, while it's
on my mind, Harry...

834
01:13:11,143 --> 01:13:13,314
...there's something we must
straighten out.

835
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,901
I've gone through enough
with Beatrix over this.

836
01:13:16,296 --> 01:13:19,874
I may be getting old and crotchety,
but I won't put up with it anymore.

837
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:23,237
I'm afraid you must take her
off my hands as soon as possible.

838
01:13:24,073 --> 01:13:25,764
Oh, Father!

839
01:13:25,929 --> 01:13:27,652
Well, Sir Charles, that's...

840
01:13:27,818 --> 01:13:29,989
Of course, I insist on all the trimmings:

841
01:13:30,154 --> 01:13:32,837
Wedding at St. Margaret's,
Bishop Manners, reception.

842
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:35,268
Yes, sir, Sir Charles. I'd...

843
01:13:35,435 --> 01:13:39,145
Well, show her you're happy about it.
Do something, man.

844
01:13:43,468 --> 01:13:46,632
Just another work of art, madam.
It's not in your catalog.

845
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:56,361
We're feeling rather gay, are we, sir?

846
01:13:56,527 --> 01:13:59,178
Poole, old friend, I'm going
to be married very soon.

847
01:13:59,343 --> 01:14:01,514
Sir, you don't know how
happy that makes me.

848
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,686
I knew it would, Poole.

849
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:05,835
Thank you.

850
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:10,284
Sir, there's a patient in the
consulting room, a Miss Ivy Peterson.

851
01:14:10,704 --> 01:14:13,551
She's without an appointment.
If you've no time, I can...

852
01:14:13,713 --> 01:14:16,201
No, no, that's all right. I'll see her.

853
01:15:08,954 --> 01:15:10,361
So it's you, sir.

854
01:15:10,683 --> 01:15:12,854
So you are the famous Dr. Jekyll.

855
01:15:14,491 --> 01:15:15,865
Well...

856
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:21,399
I'm the one you and your friend
took home that night.

857
01:15:21,756 --> 01:15:23,796
- Remember?
- Well, what...

858
01:15:23,965 --> 01:15:26,485
...what brings you here, Miss Peterson?

859
01:15:26,653 --> 01:15:28,213
- I think...
- Are you ill?

860
01:15:37,822 --> 01:15:39,131
There.

861
01:15:40,031 --> 01:15:41,558
That's what.

862
01:15:42,879 --> 01:15:44,537
Look at that.

863
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,898
Pretty, ain't it?

864
01:15:48,929 --> 01:15:51,482
Did you ever see a thing
like that before?

865
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:54,239
I'll get you some lotion.

866
01:15:54,401 --> 01:15:55,961
Lotion?

867
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,617
It won't be lotion that will
do the trick, sir.

868
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:02,464
It's more than that. I need help.

869
01:16:02,755 --> 01:16:05,057
I can't stand it anymore.

870
01:16:07,524 --> 01:16:09,379
It's Hyde, sir.

871
01:16:09,572 --> 01:16:11,001
It's a man I know, Mr. Hyde.

872
01:16:11,172 --> 01:16:14,718
It's him that's done it and more.
More I can't tell you.

873
01:16:15,685 --> 01:16:17,659
He ain't a human. He's a beast.

874
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:21,821
And he won't let me go, sir,
and I am afraid to run away.

875
01:16:25,863 --> 01:16:30,020
Marcia, she's my girlfriend,
and Freddie, that's her friend, they...

876
01:16:30,183 --> 01:16:33,478
...they say it's my nerves,
and that you know about such things.

877
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:35,427
And that you could help me.

878
01:16:36,584 --> 01:16:39,301
Oh, I can't bear up under it no more!

879
01:16:47,178 --> 01:16:49,250
If you can't help me...

880
01:16:49,802 --> 01:16:52,223
...give me some poison
so I can kill myself.

881
01:16:54,411 --> 01:16:57,989
Why didn't you try to get help before?
Why didn't you go to the police?

882
01:16:58,156 --> 01:16:59,465
I tell you, I'm afraid.

883
01:16:59,628 --> 01:17:01,002
No...

884
01:17:01,772 --> 01:17:04,292
...he ain't a man.
He's a devil, he is.

885
01:17:05,901 --> 01:17:07,756
He knows what you're thinking about.

886
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:10,306
If he knows I'm here,
who knows what he'll do.

887
01:17:10,478 --> 01:17:13,063
It won't be nothing human,
I can tell you!

888
01:17:16,078 --> 01:17:20,301
Oh, please. Please help me keep him off.

889
01:17:23,728 --> 01:17:25,353
I'll do anything you ask, sir.

890
01:17:29,968 --> 01:17:32,750
I ain't as bad as you might think.

891
01:17:34,865 --> 01:17:36,239
Well...

892
01:17:37,137 --> 01:17:39,024
Men say that I...

893
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:42,894
I ain't a bad looker
when I'm more myself.

894
01:17:45,843 --> 01:17:48,593
You liked me once a little, didn't you?

895
01:17:50,356 --> 01:17:51,697
Really, you...

896
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,893
You're such a fine and kind gentleman.

897
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:58,985
Honest, that night,
when you walked out of my place...

898
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:02,868
...I made as if I didn't care.

899
01:18:03,894 --> 01:18:05,617
I did care.

900
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:10,574
After you'd gone,
I kept wishing you'd come back.

901
01:18:10,743 --> 01:18:12,117
Truly, I did.

902
01:18:23,674 --> 01:18:26,641
This man, Hyde, will never
trouble you again.

903
01:18:27,738 --> 01:18:29,745
I give you my word.

904
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,026
How do you know?

905
01:18:31,195 --> 01:18:33,497
He'll come back!
He'll come back and kill me!

906
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:37,107
No. He won't come back.

907
01:18:37,627 --> 01:18:39,350
I'll see to it.

908
01:18:40,572 --> 01:18:42,906
Oh, you don't know him, sir.

909
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:45,947
Oh, you don't know him.
He ain't human, he ain't!

910
01:18:46,109 --> 01:18:48,313
I gave you my word.

911
01:18:49,469 --> 01:18:51,989
You'll never see Hyde again.

912
01:18:53,406 --> 01:18:54,518
You must believe me.

913
01:19:00,543 --> 01:19:02,615
I believe you, sir.

914
01:19:03,648 --> 01:19:05,622
I believe you.

915
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:08,863
You must go now.

916
01:19:09,857 --> 01:19:11,351
Yes, sir.

917
01:19:13,025 --> 01:19:14,585
Yes, sir.

918
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:38,595
For a moment, I thought...

919
01:19:44,582 --> 01:19:46,109
Goodbye.

920
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:57,952
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
admitted such a person.

921
01:19:58,121 --> 01:19:59,779
I didn't know she was hysterical.

922
01:19:59,944 --> 01:20:02,148
That's all right.
I'm glad you admitted her.

923
01:20:02,313 --> 01:20:04,964
Now, about the wedding,
we've got a lot to discuss.

924
01:20:05,129 --> 01:20:07,911
- We've never been married before.
- Let's not get upset.

925
01:20:08,074 --> 01:20:09,383
We'll manage it somehow.

926
01:20:11,051 --> 01:20:13,801
- Good evening, Mr. Weller.
- Good evening, Dr. Jekyll.

927
01:20:13,963 --> 01:20:16,265
A touch of autumn in the air.
Very seasonable.

928
01:20:16,427 --> 01:20:18,848
- Wonderful, Mr. Weller, wonderful.
- Listen here.

929
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,191
Remember that comet
I was telling you about?

930
01:20:21,356 --> 01:20:23,658
The blooming thing
didn't hit us after all.

931
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,096
- You know why?
- No. Why?

932
01:20:25,261 --> 01:20:27,749
Because it knew at this moment,
across the park...

933
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:31,179
...Sir Emery is going to announce
the marriage of his daughter...

934
01:20:31,341 --> 01:20:34,024
...to the very man you're talking to.
- Dr. Jekyll!

935
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:36,808
And my best wishes to
the Mrs. Jekyll as is to be.

936
01:20:36,975 --> 01:20:38,862
Thank you. You don't mind if I hurry?

937
01:20:39,023 --> 01:20:41,805
- Godspeed, Dr. Jekyll.
- Thank you, Mr. Weller!

938
01:23:06,759 --> 01:23:08,133
Oh.

939
01:23:26,218 --> 01:23:29,666
Here's hoping that Hyde rots...

940
01:23:29,834 --> 01:23:31,906
...wherever he is.

941
01:23:33,514 --> 01:23:37,158
Burn slow when the time comes.

942
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:49,159
Here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll
thinks of his Ivy...

943
01:23:50,701 --> 01:23:53,254
...as I know he'd like to.

944
01:23:55,374 --> 01:23:58,124
As his Ivy thinks of him.

945
01:24:00,271 --> 01:24:02,540
Because he's an angel.

946
01:24:03,568 --> 01:24:06,219
Here's to my angel.

947
01:24:35,605 --> 01:24:37,427
Surprised?

948
01:24:37,845 --> 01:24:40,714
Couldn't be that you
didn't expect to see me?

949
01:24:41,941 --> 01:24:43,348
No.

950
01:24:44,534 --> 01:24:46,159
I've been...

951
01:24:46,326 --> 01:24:47,667
I've been waiting for you.

952
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:51,499
But you've been celebrating.
Is there some new event, some change?

953
01:24:53,303 --> 01:24:54,644
No.

954
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,617
No. I just thought...

955
01:24:57,784 --> 01:25:00,337
You've just been drinking
to calm your nerves, huh?

956
01:25:00,505 --> 01:25:04,596
It is your nerves, isn't it?
Perhaps you should see a doctor.

957
01:25:07,449 --> 01:25:08,878
No.

958
01:25:10,202 --> 01:25:12,984
No, I don't need a doctor.

959
01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:17,650
Would you like to have some wine, sir?

960
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:20,855
I'll get you another glass.

961
01:25:25,244 --> 01:25:28,692
Dr. Jekyll's a good man.
Yes, Dr. Henry Jekyll.

962
01:25:28,861 --> 01:25:31,676
- Is he?
- Yes. Yes.

963
01:25:31,838 --> 01:25:35,897
And a fine gentleman too.
Different than any man you might know.

964
01:25:36,062 --> 01:25:38,331
Yes. Yes.

965
01:25:38,494 --> 01:25:43,480
"A nice, fine gentleman like yourself, sir,
wouldn't be knowing such a person. " No.

966
01:25:43,647 --> 01:25:48,284
"I ain't such a bad looker, sir,
when I'm more myself. " Yes.

967
01:25:48,448 --> 01:25:51,710
He's the kind of man you can
get down on your knees to, isn't he?

968
01:25:51,872 --> 01:25:55,669
A sweet, dear, pure man
that you can trust and believe.

969
01:25:55,841 --> 01:25:58,426
He's a smug, hypocritical coward,
that's what he is!

970
01:25:58,593 --> 01:26:00,927
- You couldn't know him!
- I know him intimately.

971
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,683
And I detest him intimately...

972
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:05,752
...from his lofty brain to
the soles of his virtuous feet!

973
01:26:05,923 --> 01:26:09,665
And you, you...
"I'll do anything you ask, sir. "

974
01:26:09,827 --> 01:26:12,827
Well, you saw him, didn't you?
You saw the respectable fool.

975
01:26:12,996 --> 01:26:16,062
Clutched his halo and held
it straight, didn't he!

976
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,081
How do you know all that?

977
01:26:18,244 --> 01:26:20,099
I know everything you do and think.

978
01:26:20,262 --> 01:26:22,847
Dr. Jekyll wouldn't tell you.
He ain't the kind of...

979
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:26,657
And as you were leaving the room,
you turned at the door, didn't you?

980
01:26:26,822 --> 01:26:30,237
And you said,
"For a moment, I thought... "

981
01:26:30,407 --> 01:26:33,538
What did you think?
What did you think?

982
01:26:33,704 --> 01:26:36,387
Did you think Dr. Jekyll
was falling in love with you?

983
01:26:36,936 --> 01:26:39,751
You, with your cheap little dreams?

984
01:26:42,504 --> 01:26:44,893
Or did you think, perhaps...

985
01:26:45,065 --> 01:26:48,578
...that in him, you saw
a bit of me, Hyde?

986
01:26:52,426 --> 01:26:56,168
Oh, but it confuses you, doesn't it?

987
01:26:56,331 --> 01:26:59,364
It isn't quite clear, is it?

988
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,374
Oh...

989
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,481
What are you going to do?

990
01:27:04,748 --> 01:27:07,595
Something so simple.

991
01:27:08,013 --> 01:27:12,236
I'm going to put an end
to all that confusion.

992
01:27:22,895 --> 01:27:26,244
Please, sir!
Oh, no!

993
01:27:26,415 --> 01:27:28,717
Please, no!

994
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:33,001
Yes, dance.

995
01:27:33,169 --> 01:27:35,078
Dance and dream.

996
01:27:35,249 --> 01:27:38,544
Dream that you're Mrs. Henry Jekyll
of Harley Street...

997
01:27:38,705 --> 01:27:42,000
...dancing with your own butler
and six footmen.

998
01:27:42,162 --> 01:27:47,792
Dream they've all turned into white mice
and crawled into an eternal pumpkin.

999
01:27:52,916 --> 01:27:55,851
Here, you in there!
Open this here door!

1000
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:03,637
Police!

1001
01:28:06,678 --> 01:28:09,067
- Ivy!
- I'm going in.

1002
01:28:09,238 --> 01:28:10,831
Governor!

1003
01:28:12,247 --> 01:28:13,774
Ho, there!

1004
01:28:22,072 --> 01:28:23,217
Hey, you there!

1005
01:28:23,385 --> 01:28:24,497
Look here, governor.

1006
01:28:24,665 --> 01:28:27,567
- Steady! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Police!

1007
01:28:28,154 --> 01:28:30,009
Chase him, somebody!
Get a copper!

1008
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:33,301
Police! Hurry.

1009
01:29:14,817 --> 01:29:17,719
Come on, open up!
Let me in. I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.

1010
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:20,192
- Dr. Jekyll's not home.
- He told me to wait.

1011
01:29:20,354 --> 01:29:22,656
- I know all Dr. Jekyll's friends.
- Let me in!

1012
01:29:22,818 --> 01:29:25,982
- You'll have to come back.
- Let me in, or I'll bash this door...

1013
01:29:26,147 --> 01:29:28,994
If you don't go away,
I'll have to send for the police!

1014
01:30:20,075 --> 01:30:22,115
That's him!
There he goes!

1015
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:25,185
- This ain't no place to rob.
- But robbed it is!

1016
01:30:25,357 --> 01:30:27,429
Help!
Police!

1017
01:30:33,134 --> 01:30:34,825
- Good night, Charles.
- Good night.

1018
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:39,049
- Sorry your young man was detained, dear.
- So am I, Uncle Geoffrey.

1019
01:31:01,426 --> 01:31:02,702
Good evening, sir.

1020
01:31:02,866 --> 01:31:05,168
There was a ring at the door
a while ago, sir.

1021
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:09,225
When I answered it,
there was nobody there. I found this.

1022
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:39,575
You don't happen to know
what Dr. Jekyll uses these for?

1023
01:31:39,736 --> 01:31:44,079
No, sir, I don't rightly know.
I don't rightly know, sir.

1024
01:31:49,338 --> 01:31:52,240
- Have you got it?
- What are you doing hiding behind that...?

1025
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:55,574
I was waiting for you, Dr. Lanyon.
I'm the man from Dr. Jekyll.

1026
01:31:55,739 --> 01:31:57,779
- The package, I'll take it.
- Step inside.

1027
01:31:57,947 --> 01:31:59,540
No, no!
There's not time.

1028
01:31:59,707 --> 01:32:02,936
As Jekyll's friend, I have the right
to ask you a few questions.

1029
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,653
Come now, don't waste time
with prying questions.

1030
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,122
- Let me have it...
- I don't like your attitude.

1031
01:32:08,285 --> 01:32:12,311
- Suppose you introduce yourself.
- Hyde. What difference does that make?

1032
01:32:16,478 --> 01:32:18,518
- You an acquaintance of Jekyll?
- Yes.

1033
01:32:18,686 --> 01:32:21,533
Yes, of course. I'm an old friend.
Now let me have the...

1034
01:32:21,694 --> 01:32:23,188
Where is Dr. Jekyll?

1035
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:26,174
- Don't worry, he's alive.
- What's the matter? Is he ill?

1036
01:32:26,336 --> 01:32:29,053
- No! He's perfectly all right.
- Very well, then.

1037
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:32,315
- I'll come with you and see for myself.
- You pretentious fool!

1038
01:32:32,481 --> 01:32:36,376
- You take another step with that, I'll shoot.
- Now, wait a minute, Lanyon.

1039
01:32:36,545 --> 01:32:39,840
I can't let you come with me,
and I can't tell you any more.

1040
01:32:40,002 --> 01:32:43,417
- Why not?
- Because. Because.

1041
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,301
I warn you,
don't stick your nose into this.

1042
01:32:46,467 --> 01:32:48,856
You'd better let me go, Lanyon.

1043
01:32:49,027 --> 01:32:53,370
- You can ask Jekyll about it tomorrow.
- You'll take me to Harry Jekyll this minute.

1044
01:32:54,532 --> 01:32:57,379
For the last time, Lanyon,
would you let me leave alone?

1045
01:32:57,541 --> 01:33:01,185
- No.
- All right. All right, then.

1046
01:33:01,989 --> 01:33:04,509
Let it be on your own head.

1047
01:33:47,949 --> 01:33:50,153
Now, once again, Lanyon...

1048
01:33:50,477 --> 01:33:52,582
...will you let me take this glass
and go?

1049
01:33:53,325 --> 01:33:55,464
No, why should I?

1050
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,939
For your own sake, Lanyon.

1051
01:33:57,102 --> 01:33:59,371
Whatever you're going to do,
get on with it!

1052
01:35:13,722 --> 01:35:15,991
I warned you, John.

1053
01:35:16,571 --> 01:35:18,611
Even as Hyde, I warned you.

1054
01:35:28,637 --> 01:35:30,742
You see what you've done,
don't you?

1055
01:35:31,069 --> 01:35:34,004
I mean, you,
you've gone beyond.

1056
01:35:34,173 --> 01:35:35,929
You've tampered with...

1057
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:39,412
You've committed
the supreme blasphemy.

1058
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:42,908
I know, John.
I know, I know.

1059
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:45,438
- You must destroy the formula.
- I've done that.

1060
01:35:45,599 --> 01:35:49,309
No, I mean, you must destroy it from
your mind! You can't take this again!

1061
01:35:49,472 --> 01:35:52,123
I know. I know.
I know.

1062
01:35:53,184 --> 01:35:54,613
Tonight...

1063
01:35:54,785 --> 01:35:57,502
Tonight, on my way to Sir Charles'...

1064
01:35:57,762 --> 01:36:00,064
You see, I thought I could control...

1065
01:36:00,226 --> 01:36:03,936
But tonight this change, this thing you saw,
happened without my...

1066
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:08,160
- What about Bea?
- I'll tell her.

1067
01:36:10,052 --> 01:36:12,703
At least I have strength
enough left for that.

1068
01:37:07,501 --> 01:37:08,930
Darling.

1069
01:37:09,805 --> 01:37:13,318
I heard you playing...

1070
01:37:13,485 --> 01:37:15,689
...and I thought we could talk in here...

1071
01:37:15,853 --> 01:37:18,373
...just as well as anywhere.

1072
01:37:18,542 --> 01:37:20,549
Well, of course, dear.

1073
01:37:20,718 --> 01:37:23,500
I can't imagine how you felt last night
when I...

1074
01:37:23,663 --> 01:37:25,768
You don't have to explain anything.

1075
01:37:25,935 --> 01:37:27,844
I know it must have been important.

1076
01:37:28,016 --> 01:37:32,359
- You know that I'd forgive anything you...
- But that's it, you mustn't forgive anymore!

1077
01:37:32,528 --> 01:37:34,633
You must make up your mind to...

1078
01:37:37,841 --> 01:37:41,256
Tell me, darling, what's wrong?

1079
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:44,977
What is it, Harry?

1080
01:37:45,139 --> 01:37:46,927
Look at me.

1081
01:37:48,659 --> 01:37:50,350
Please, Bea...

1082
01:37:50,899 --> 01:37:52,721
Let me begin...

1083
01:37:55,124 --> 01:37:57,874
There's no way to begin
except to tell you.

1084
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:59,985
Tell me what?

1085
01:38:02,486 --> 01:38:03,598
You're...

1086
01:38:03,765 --> 01:38:06,034
You're a brave girl, aren't you?

1087
01:38:06,934 --> 01:38:08,079
Yes.

1088
01:38:08,246 --> 01:38:12,272
That's why I can tell you like this,
because you are brave and strong.

1089
01:38:12,439 --> 01:38:14,326
Always remember that.

1090
01:38:16,888 --> 01:38:20,914
Bea, we can't be married.
I must never see you again.

1091
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,767
Oh, you...

1092
01:38:23,513 --> 01:38:25,138
You don't know what you...

1093
01:38:25,305 --> 01:38:27,607
Harry, what's happened?
Look at me!

1094
01:38:27,769 --> 01:38:30,452
Just that. Just that.
That's all I can tell you.

1095
01:38:30,618 --> 01:38:32,178
But, why?

1096
01:38:32,346 --> 01:38:33,775
What...?

1097
01:38:33,946 --> 01:38:37,110
We've always said that there's nothing
we couldn't discuss.

1098
01:38:37,275 --> 01:38:41,170
- Nothing secret between you and me, ever.
- Don't ask any more, please.

1099
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,860
If you ever trusted me, trust me now.

1100
01:38:44,028 --> 01:38:48,251
It's for your happiness and mine,
believe me. That's all I can say.

1101
01:38:48,413 --> 01:38:50,834
Oh, my darling!

1102
01:38:54,334 --> 01:38:55,959
Are you ill?

1103
01:38:56,126 --> 01:38:58,843
- There's something you...
- No, no.

1104
01:38:59,006 --> 01:39:02,683
Bea, don't ask me any more.
Don't try to understand. Just take my word.

1105
01:39:02,847 --> 01:39:04,570
Now, please go.

1106
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:09,494
This is so wrong of me.

1107
01:39:10,848 --> 01:39:13,565
To make you go through all of this.

1108
01:39:15,809 --> 01:39:18,678
You're trying not to hurt me,
aren't you?

1109
01:39:19,073 --> 01:39:20,283
Harry...

1110
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:23,133
Harry, it's all right...

1111
01:39:23,298 --> 01:39:25,818
...if you don't love me anymore.

1112
01:39:27,138 --> 01:39:30,586
- I know things like that can happen.
- Bea.

1113
01:39:33,124 --> 01:39:34,946
Oh, you do.

1114
01:39:35,171 --> 01:39:36,829
You still do.

1115
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,926
- What is it, dearest?
- Bea, Bea, darling.

1116
01:39:41,093 --> 01:39:42,620
No.

1117
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:45,569
Don't say anything more.

1118
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:48,443
Just hold me close.

1119
01:39:53,927 --> 01:39:55,934
Goodbye, darling.

1120
01:39:58,023 --> 01:39:59,430
Harry!

1121
01:40:00,296 --> 01:40:02,052
Harry, please!

1122
01:40:02,216 --> 01:40:05,445
Please come back!
Please don't...

1123
01:40:05,896 --> 01:40:07,325
Harry!

1124
01:41:02,418 --> 01:41:05,003
You did come back.

1125
01:41:05,938 --> 01:41:08,272
Oh, my darling.

1126
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,041
Father!

1127
01:41:20,213 --> 01:41:21,806
Father!

1128
01:41:25,878 --> 01:41:28,660
Beatrix!
Beatrix!

1129
01:41:28,854 --> 01:41:30,098
Help!
Help!

1130
01:41:44,921 --> 01:41:47,223
What's the matter, sir?
What's wrong, sir?

1131
01:41:47,385 --> 01:41:50,581
- Help!
- Look! There he goes! There he goes! Look!

1132
01:41:50,746 --> 01:41:52,753
There he goes!

1133
01:41:55,034 --> 01:41:57,368
Hey, stop there!

1134
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:11,089
Hey!

1135
01:42:13,629 --> 01:42:15,931
Hey! What's going on?!

1136
01:42:34,432 --> 01:42:36,025
Hold it, you!

1137
01:43:00,837 --> 01:43:02,811
This is the weapon, doctor.

1138
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:10,684
Yes. I...

1139
01:43:11,655 --> 01:43:15,267
If you'll come with me, inspector.
Ward, you remain here.

1140
01:44:01,071 --> 01:44:04,071
Dr. Jekyll, that frightful maniac
broke into the house.

1141
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:05,700
- Did he attack you, sir?
- Yes.

1142
01:44:05,871 --> 01:44:09,002
- Which way did he go? Out here?
- Didn't know you were home, sir.

1143
01:44:09,168 --> 01:44:12,103
- Are you badly hurt?
- No. No, I'll be all right.

1144
01:44:12,272 --> 01:44:14,279
This here door's locked.

1145
01:44:15,344 --> 01:44:18,061
- We'd better go out that way.
- Yes.

1146
01:44:19,857 --> 01:44:21,286
Wait!

1147
01:44:29,395 --> 01:44:32,591
- There. Heaven help him.
- Dr. Lanyon...

1148
01:44:32,756 --> 01:44:35,123
...but I know this gentleman.
He's Dr. Jekyll.

1149
01:44:35,284 --> 01:44:37,651
I know.
Nevertheless, there's your man.

1150
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:41,009
I'm sorry, sir, but I know Dr. Jekyll.
I've known him for years.

1151
01:44:41,173 --> 01:44:44,402
- This is your master, isn't it?
- Of course, sir. No doubt of it.

1152
01:44:44,565 --> 01:44:47,434
- Then we must have lost him. Come, men.
- No, no. Wait.

1153
01:44:48,022 --> 01:44:50,542
Tell them, Jekyll.
Tell them.

1154
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:52,877
It's no use, Jekyll.

1155
01:44:53,783 --> 01:44:57,166
You know it's no use. I beg of you, Jekyll,
tell them who you are.

1156
01:44:57,335 --> 01:45:00,531
- Tell them what you've done.
- I've done nothing.

1157
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,374
I'm Dr. Jekyll.

1158
01:45:03,897 --> 01:45:06,068
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll.

1159
01:45:07,321 --> 01:45:09,176
I've done nothing.

1160
01:45:09,529 --> 01:45:11,503
I'm Dr. Jekyll.

1161
01:45:12,249 --> 01:45:15,096
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll, I tell you.

1162
01:45:16,154 --> 01:45:18,096
I've done nothing.

1163
01:45:19,931 --> 01:45:22,614
You're looking for a man named Hyde.

1164
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:24,209
Hyde!

1165
01:45:25,531 --> 01:45:28,116
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll.

1166
01:45:29,084 --> 01:45:31,124
I'm Dr. Jekyll, I tell you!

1167
01:45:31,292 --> 01:45:34,161
I tell you, I'm Dr. Jekyll!

1168
01:45:34,333 --> 01:45:36,918
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll!

1169
01:45:41,183 --> 01:45:44,030
It's no use, Jekyll.
You'd better come quietly.

1170
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:09,578
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1171
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:13,384
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1172
01:47:13,549 --> 01:47:16,745
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

1173
01:47:16,909 --> 01:47:19,691
He restoreth my soul.

1174
01:47:20,558 --> 01:47:25,643
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness,
for his name's sake.

1175
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,670
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

1176
